The yuan rose toward a 17-year high
on speculation  China  will favor currency gains as part of
efforts to tame the fastest inflation since 2008.  The People’s Bank of China set the  reference rate  for yuan
trading 0.1 percent stronger at 6.3883 per dollar today, the
strongest level since July 2005. The central bank broadened the
base of reserves it requires commercial lenders to deposit with
it to control liquidity, economists said late last week.
Fighting inflation will remain the top priority in the second
half of 2011 and monetary policy will remain “prudent,” the
central bank said in a quarterly report on Aug. 12.  “The latest move on banks’ reserves confirms the fact that
China will continue to tighten monetary policy to ease
inflationary pressure,” said Daniel Chan, Hong Kong-based
economist at BWC Capital Markets. “It also implies the
government is going to allow a stronger currency to lower
imported food and material costs.”  The yuan rose 0.05 percent to 6.3837 per dollar as of 10:13
a.m. in  Shanghai , according to the China Foreign Exchange Trade
System. The currency touched 6.3820 on Aug. 16, the strongest
level since the country unified the official and market exchange
rates at the end of 1993. In Hong Kong’s offshore market, the
currency strengthened 0.09 percent to 6.3690.  Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards gained 0.08 percent
to 6.2876 in Hong Kong, a 1.5 percent premium to the onshore
spot rate, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Reserve requirements are being extended to customers’
margin deposits, a move that may drain 900 billion yuan ($140
billion) from the banking system over six months, Bank of
America Merrill Lynch economist Lu Ting said in an e-mailed note
on Aug. 26. Mizuho Securities Asia Ltd. cited similar
information.  China has already raised major lenders’ reserve-requirement
ratios six times this year, lifting them to a record 21.5
percent. Consumer prices climbed 6.5 percent from a year earlier
in July, the most in three years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
