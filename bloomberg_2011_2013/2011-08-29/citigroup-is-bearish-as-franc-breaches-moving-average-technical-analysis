The Swiss franc may decline to a
level against the dollar last seen in May if it ends the day
weaker than a key technical level, according to Citigroup Inc.  A daily close weaker than the 55-day moving average of
80.99 centimes per dollar would indicate the franc will slump to
the 200-day moving average, wrote  Tom Fitzpatrick , chief
technical analyst at Citigroup Inc. in New York, in a research
note to clients today. The franc last broke 89.29 centimes, now
the 200-day moving average, in mid-May.  The franc depreciated 1.7 percent to 82.05 centimes per
dollar at 10:45 a.m. in New York, from 80.63 on Aug. 26. It
touched 82.41, the weakest level since July 22.  The Swiss currency touched a level weaker than the 55-day
moving average versus the dollar for a second day after last
breaking that level in February.  The franc should also retreat to 1.24 per euro after
closing weaker than the 55-day moving average on Aug. 26.
 Switzerland â€™s currency tumbled 2 percent today to 1.1922 against
the 17-nation currency, from 1.1690.  To contact the reporter on this story:
