OAO Rosneft,  Russia â€™s biggest oil
producer, surged by the most in 15 months as crude climbed and
investors bet new tax changes will bolster revenue.  The shares surged 7.4 percent to 220.93 rubles by the 6:45
p.m. close in Moscow, the most since May 2010.  Crude for October delivery rose $1.89, or 2.2 percent, to
$87.26 a barrel in New York. Futures have fallen 4.5 percent
this year.  Prime Minister Vladimir Putin approved last week raising
export duties on heavy oil products, such as  fuel oil , while
lowering the rate for lighter products including diesel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
