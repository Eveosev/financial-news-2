Italy may increase its value-added
tax to 21 percent from 20 percent, Il Sole 24 Ore reported,
without saying where it got the information.  Higher VAT may generate 4.9 billion euros ($7 billion) over
an unspecified period, the daily said, citing its own research.  Prime Minister  Silvio Berlusconi  and  Umberto Bossi , the
leader of Italy’s Northern League party and the premier’s
closest political ally, are scheduled to meet today to reach
agreement on austerity measures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
