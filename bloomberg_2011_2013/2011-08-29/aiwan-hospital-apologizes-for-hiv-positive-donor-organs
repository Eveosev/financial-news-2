A  Taiwan  hospital apologized for
accidentally transplanting organs from an HIV-positive donor
into recipient patients.  National Taiwan University Hospital workers made the error
because they didn’t properly confirm HIV test results, the
Taipei-based hospital said in an Aug. 27 statement on its
 Website . Five patients received organs from the HIV-positive
donor, Taiwan’s official  Central News Agency  reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
