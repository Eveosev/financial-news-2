Soybeans climbed to the highest in
almost five months and corn gained for a third day on mounting
concerns the hottest July since 1955 in the largest U.S.
producing states may curb harvests.  Soybeans for November delivery rose as much as 0.6
percent to $14.3175 a bushel, the highest price for a most-
active contract on the Chicago Board of Trade since March 31.
It was at $14.30 at 12:32 p.m. Singapore time.  Iowa  and  Illinois , the biggest corn- and soybean-growing
states, had their hottest July since 1955, according to state
climatology departments. Areas of western Iowa, central
Illinois, southern  Minnesota  and western  Indiana  had a quarter
of normal rainfall this month, according to the  National
Weather Service .  “Markets rise on yield worries,” as declining U.S.
production may widen the global shortfall forecast by the U.S.
Department of Agriculture, intensifying competition among
importers for supplies,  Hiroyuki Kikukawa , general manager for
research at IDO Securities Co. in  Tokyo , said in an e-mail
today.  Global production of soybeans will drop 2.5 percent from
a year earlier to 257.5 million metric tons in the 2011-2012
season, trailing demand estimated at 262.3 million tons and
draining stockpiles, according to the  U.S. Department of
Agriculture  forecast on Aug. 11.  The U.S., the largest soybean grower and exporter, will
likely produce 3.025 billion bushels of the oilseed, 1 percent
smaller than the USDA forecast on Aug. 11, Rabobank
International said in a report issued Aug. 26, when it
correctly predicted that the risk of yield losses could push
the price above $14 a bushel. A metric ton of soybeans is
about 36.7  bushels .  Still, Rabobank said supply will remain adequate, even as
the U.S. harvest shrinks and prices are unlikely to trade
above $14 for an extended period, it said, without being more
specific. It forecast soybeans will average $13.75 this
quarter.  Corn Gains  December-delivery corn gained as much as 1.2 percent to
$7.765 a bushel, the highest level for a most-active contract
since June 9. It traded 1.1 percent higher at $7.7525 a bushel.  U.S. farmers will probably collect 12.484 billion bushels
of corn this year, less than the 12.914 billion bushel
forecast by the USDA on Aug. 11, according to an estimate by
the Professional Farmers of America. A metric ton of corn is
about 39.4 bushels.  Expectations of lower corn yields in the U.S. prompted
Rabobank to raise its price forecast for the grain this
quarter by 5 cents to $7.05 a bushel on Aug. 26. Tighter
global corn supplies may encourage increased use of wheat in
livestock and hog feeds, Rabobank said. About 350 million
bushels of wheat may be used in animal feeds in the U.S.,
higher than the USDA  forecast  of 240 million bushels, it said.  Wheat for December delivery advanced as much as 1 percent
to $8.05 a bushel, the highest for a most-active contract
since May 31, before trading at $7.995 a bushel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
