Barcelona opened the defense of its
Spanish soccer title by beating Champions League qualifier
Villarreal 5-0.  Lionel Messi  got two goals last night at Barcelona’s Camp
Nou stadium, while off-season signingsCesc Fabregas and  Alexis
Sanchez  each scored on their league debuts after Thiago
Alcantara opened the scoring in the 25th minute.  European champion Barcelona, seeking its fourth straight La
Liga title, already started its season by winning the Spanish
and European Super Cup trophies, the latter victory coming
against Europa League winner Porto in Monaco four days ago.  “Coming from where we came, from the effort of two Super
Cups, the team has responded very well,” Barcelona coach Josep Guardiola told his team’s website. “This gives us extra
confidence.”  Real Madrid routed Real Zaragoza 6-0 in its league opener
two days ago as  Cristiano Ronaldo  scored a hat trick.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
