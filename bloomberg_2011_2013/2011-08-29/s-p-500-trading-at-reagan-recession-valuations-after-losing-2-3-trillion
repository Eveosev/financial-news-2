Investors are paying less for
equities than they have during every recession since  Ronald Reagan  was president amid growing concern that the economy is on
the edge of another recession.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index has lost 13 percent in the
past five weeks, sending its price-earnings ratio down to 12.9.
That’s 3.5 percent less than the average multiple during the 10
contractions since 1949 and a level last reached in 1982,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Bears say valuations show the U.S. remains in the slowdown
that began in 2007. Unlike under Reagan, when U.S. Federal
Reserve Chairman  Paul Volcker  raised borrowing costs as high as
20 percent to combat inflation, interest rates are already near
zero, leaving policy makers fewer tools to boost the economy,
they say. Bulls say the ratios are so low because they reflect
indiscriminate selling by investors convinced that any slowdown
will turn into a repeat of the 2008 credit crisis.  “There are truly some terrific values out there in
companies, but it’s a question of timing,”  John Massey , a
 Jersey City , New Jersey-based fund manager who helps oversee $13
billion at SunAmerica Asset Management, said in a telephone
interview on Aug. 26. “Right now, the market is very short-term
sighted. Every day the market is up or down, and it’s much more
of a macro call than anything else.”  $2.3 Trillion Drop  About $2.3 trillion has been erased from the market value
of U.S. equities since the S&P 500’s recent high on July 22
after reports on housing and manufacturing trailed estimates,
 Europe ’s debt crisis worsened and S&P stripped the U.S. of its
AAA credit rating. The last time stocks in the index were
cheaper on average during a recession was the early 1980s, a
decade when the index surged 227 percent, or 403 percent
including reinvested dividends.  At the Aug. 26 close of 1,176.80, the  S&P 500  traded at
10.8 times analysts’ forecast for profits in the next 12 months
of $109.12 a share. For the P/E ratio to reach its five-decade
average of 16.4 without shares appreciating, earnings would have
to fall to about $71.76 a share, 22 percent below the last 12
months, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Should companies meet analysts’ profit estimates, the S&P
500 must advance to about 1,790 to trade at the average multiple
of 16.4 since 1954, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
That’s more than 50 percent above its last close. The S&P 500
gained 2.8 percent at 4 p.m. in  New York  today.  Worst Performers  Energy, financial and industrial companies have performed
worst out of 10 groups in the S&P 500 in the past month, falling
more than 16 percent, as investors fled so-called cyclical
stocks that are most tied to economic growth. Utilities and
makers of household products posted the smallest losses.  The index rallied 1.5 percent on Aug. 26, for the first
weekly gain since July, after Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said
Aug. 26 during a speech in  Jackson Hole ,  Wyoming , that the
economy isn’t deteriorating enough to warrant any immediate
stimulus. Optimism the U.S. will avoid a recession helped offset
a Commerce Department report showing gross domestic product
climbed at 1 percent in the second quarter, down from a 1.3
percent estimate.  The economy grew at a 0.4 percent annual pace in the first
quarter of 2011, the slowest since the second quarter of 2009,
when the recession had yet to end, according to data compiled by
the  National Bureau of Economic Research .  Reagan Inflation  Runaway inflation at the start of Reagan’s presidency in
1981 spurred Volcker to lift the Fed funds rate, pushing the
 U.S. economy  into a recession until November 1982. The S&P 500’s
multiple sank to an average of 8 times earnings as record-high
 interest rates  and 10-year Treasury yields above 15 percent
reduced the appeal of equities. Rates dropped through the
decade, helping fuel the equity rally.  Bernanke has held the target rate for overnight loans
between banks near zero since December 2008 and pledged this
month to keep it there through mid-2013.  “The Fed’s used up a lot of their big ammunition
already,” Bruce Bittles, who helps oversee $85 billion as chief
investment strategist at Milwaukee-based Robert W. Baird & Co.,
said in an Aug. 26 phone interview. “With earnings expectations
coming down, P/E ratios are likely to remain lower than
anticipated as well.”  Cheaper Valuations  During the credit crisis, the world’s largest economy
shrank the most in any recession since the 1930s, according to
the Commerce Department. Quarterly earnings among S&P 500
companies have almost doubled since ending an eight-period
decline in September 2009. Valuations declined as the stock
prices advanced at a slower rate, with the index climbing 11
percent since Sept. 30, 2009, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  For TCW Group Inc.’s Komal Sri-Kumar, valuations must be
lower to be attractive because the economy is stagnating. The
S&P 500 has declined 10 percent since the start of June, the
last month of the Fed’s second program of quantitative easing,
known as QE2, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  “Stocks have been at very high levels compared with a very
weak economy,” Sri-Kumar, the chief global strategist at TCW,
which oversees about $120 billion, said in a phone interview on
Aug. 24. “When QE2 was introduced last August, you got a rally
in equities prices for several months, but you didn’t get a big
push up in economic growth.”  Sri-Kumar recommended defensive stocks in the consumer
staples, utility and health-care industries.  Consumer Products  Procter & Gamble Co. (PG) , the Cincinnati-based maker of
Gillette razors, has slipped 2.6 percent since July 26, compared
with a 13 percent decline by the S&P 500. This month, the
world’s largest consumer-products company said 2011 revenue
topped analysts’ estimates and reported a 15 percent increase in
fourth-quarter profit on sales from emerging markets.  For Blackstone Group LP’s  Byron Wien  and Gamco Investors
Inc.’s Howard Ward, the decline in valuations will prove
temporary as investors buy back shares they sold in a panic
after the U.S. lost its AAA credit rating at S&P.  General Electric Co. (GE)  has fallen 15 percent this year even
after reporting profits that topped analysts’ estimates in the
first two quarters. CEO Jeff Immelt said last month that
industrial earnings and sales should increase in the second half
of 2011 and accelerate into 2012. While analysts estimate profit
at the Fairfield, Connecticut-based company will jump 21 percent
this year, shares are trading at their lowest valuation since
2009.  Market Decline  “Too much has been read into the stock market’s decline,”
Ward, who helps oversee $35 billion in Rye, New York, wrote in
an Aug. 24 e-mail.  Corporate earnings are growing fast enough to boost
equities, he said. Per-share profit at S&P 500 companies will
rise 13 percent in 2012, the fourth straight year of increases,
according to analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Alcoa Inc. (AA) , the country’s largest aluminum producer, and
 Caterpillar Inc. (CAT) , the world’s biggest maker of construction and
mining equipment, were among the worst performers in the  Dow
Jones Industrial Average  in the last month, falling 25 percent
and 19 percent through Aug. 26, respectively. Analysts estimate
earnings will jump 21 percent in 2012 at New York-based Alcoa
and 33 percent at Peoria, Illinois-based Caterpillar.  “The market’s anticipating economic growth will slow and
earnings estimates are going to have to come lower,”  Mark Bronzo , who helps manage $26 billion at Security Global
Investors in Irvington, New York, said in a telephone interview
on Aug. 24. “My gut is the stock market is attractive at these
levels and we won’t go into a recession. We’ll be in a sluggish
growth environment and eventually stocks will do better.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
