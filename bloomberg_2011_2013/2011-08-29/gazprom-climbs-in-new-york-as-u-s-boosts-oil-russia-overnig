OAO Gazprom shares traded in  New
York  advanced to the highest level in more than three weeks as
oil gained amid speculation the U.S. economic recovery will gain
traction in the second half of the year.  American depositary receipts of Gazprom, the world’s
largest gas producer, rose 2.7 percent yesterday to $12.31, the
highest since Aug. 5. The company is due to publish first-
quarter earnings after 10 a.m. in Moscow. OAO Lukoil,  Russia ’s
second-biggest oil producer, advanced 2.7 percent to $60.15 in
U.S. trading, also the highest in three weeks. Futures contracts
on OAO Sberbank, the country’s largest lender, gained 0.5
percent. The bank is scheduled to post its second-quarter
earnings today.  Russia’s RTS stock-index futures, contracts on the nation’s
dollar-denominated stock index expiring in September, were
unchanged at 165,695. Moscow’s 30-stock  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  jumped 3.7
percent to 1,512.36 yesterday, its largest one-day advance in
three months. The RTS index gained 4.5 percent to 1,667.66
yesterday in the Russian capital. The Micex may climb 0.3
percent at the start of trading, according to  Alfa Bank .  “You’re starting to see some money coming back to Russia,
which has partly to do with oil strengthening and also with
investors becoming more comfortable with a risk trade, which
Russia is,” Ilya Kravets, a research analyst at ED Capital LLC
in New York, said in a phone interview.  Crude in New York added 0.4 percent after a 2.2 percent
gain yesterday when it settled at $87.27 a barrel, after the
U.S. Commerce Department said  consumer spending  increased the
most since February last month. Urals crude, Russia’s chief
export oil blend, rose 0.8 percent to $112.53 today.  Fed Tools  The  Federal Reserve  still has tools to stimulate the
economy, which will probably revive in the second half, Chairman
 Ben S. Bernanke  said in an Aug. 26 speech in  Jackson Hole ,
 Wyoming . The Fed chief said data isn’t pointing to a recession.  “The fact that the Fed isn’t jumping in right away says
that there are signs of an improving picture in the U.S.,”
Kravets said.  The Market Vectors Russia ETF, a U.S.-traded fund that
holds Russian shares, gained 3.3 percent to $32.70 while the
Bank of New York Mellon Russia ADR Index rose 1.9 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Futures contracts on OAO Rosneft, Russia’s biggest oil
producer, rose 0.2 percent. Contracts on Lukoil fell 0.2
percent, snapping two days of gains.  The Micex has dropped 10 percent since the end of 2010 and
trades at 5.9 times analysts’ earnings estimates. That compares
with a 21 percent slide for  Brazil ’s Bovespa Index, which trades
at 9.1 times earnings, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The
Shanghai Composite Index trades at 11.8 times estimated
earnings, and  India ’s Sensex has a ratio of 13.7.  The euro was little changed at 1.4511 per dollar yesterday,
while the  S&P 500 Index (SPX)  climbed 2.8 percent to 1,210.08, led by
