Dallas Cowboys  center Andre Gurode
will be cut today after five Pro Bowl seasons in nine years with
the team, the Cowboys announced on their  website .  Gurode, 32, was the National Football League team’s
longest-tenured player, and a Pro Bowl selection in each of the
last five seasons. The team was unable to trade Gurode, and will
save about $5.5 million on this year’s salary cap, according to
the website.  Gurode is the third starting offensive lineman from last
season that the team has cut since the league’s lockout ended in
July, joining Marc Colombo and Leonard Davis. The Cowboys
allowed 31 sacks last year and finished 6-10, their worst
regular-season record in six seasons.  Gurode was selected by the Cowboys in the second round of
the 2002  NFL Draft . He started 122 games in nine seasons with
the team.  -- Editor: Rob Gloster  To contact the reporter on this story:
