OAO Lukoil and OAO  Tatneft (TATN)  are
seeking to nullify export duties for high-viscosity oil, a
proposal now under review by the government,  Vedomosti  said,
citing an unidentified Economy Ministry official.  Lukoil may save $900 million a year at current heavy-oil
output levels and as much as $1.8 billion a year as production
climbs, Vedomosti reported. Tatneft may save about $133 million
a year, the newspaper said.  Tatarstan, the Russian region where Tatneft is based, may
hold from 1.5 billion to 7 billion metric tons of oil that would
qualify for the tax break, Vedomosti said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
