Duncan Niederauer, the chief
executive officer of  NYSE Euronext (NYX) , spoke after he was dropped
off today at  Wall Street  and Broadway in Manhattan at about 6
a.m. New York time, a day after Hurricane Irene struck the city.
He lives in Somerset County,  New Jersey .  U.S. stock markets, including the New York Stock Exchange,
said yesterday they plan to run a normal trading session today.  “The hardest part of getting to work this morning was the
two blocks getting out of our street because there are trees
down and a lot of flooding in New Jersey.”  “We told most of our people to stay home and be with their
families, except people who are responsible for the floor
operations because we thought it was important to open the
exchange and have business as usual.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
