China Citic Bank Corp., the banking
unit of the nation’s largest state-owned investment firm, said
first-half profit rose 40 percent as lending and fee income
climbed.  Net income rose to 15 billion yuan ($2.4 billion), or 0.38
yuan a share, from 10.7 billion yuan, or 0.27 yuan a share, from
the same period a year earlier, the lender said in a filing to
the  Shanghai  stock exchange.  Citic Bank’s provision coverage ratio increased to 238.23
percent of bad loans from 213.51 percent at the end of last
year, while the non-performing loan ratio narrowed to 0.62
percent from 0.67 percent.  Citic Bank, which is backed by Banco Bilbao Vizcaya
Argentaria SA, completed a $4 billion rights offer in Shanghai
and  Hong Kong  in July. Its core capital adequacy ratio increased
to 8.87 percent from 8.45 percent at the end of last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
