Fondiaria-Sai SpA (FSA) ,  Italy ’s second-
biggest insurer, said its first-half loss narrowed on lower
claims in the non-life segment and a return to profit at its
real-estate business.  The net loss decreased to 61.9 million euros ($90 million)
from a 144.8 million-euro loss a year earlier, the Florence-
based insurer said in a statement today. That missed the average
estimate for a loss of 48 million euros by four analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg.  Fondiaria, which gets most of its revenue from its property
and casualty businesses, is selling assets including a 1.1
percent stake in Assicurazioni Generali SpA and real estate to
strengthen finances and meet targets. The firm, led by Chief
Executive Officer Emanuele Erbetta, raised about 450 million
euros through a share sale in July.  Fondiaria rose 3.2 cents, or 2.3 percent, to 1.42 euros in
Milan, giving the company a market value of 630 million euros.  The company’s combined ratio, or claims and expenses as a
proportion of premiums, fell to 101.9 percent in the six months
ended in June from 105.4 percent a year earlier. A figure above
100 percent means an insurer’s claims and costs exceed premium
income, giving it a loss from underwriting.  The real-estate unit swung to a profit of 8 million euros
in the first half. The insurer’s life premiums declined 31
percent to 2.6 billion euros in the period, while the non-life
premiums fell 1.2 percent to 3.7 billion euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
