All Blacks forwards Kieran Read and
Adam Thompson should be fit to take part at a later stage of the
 Rugby World Cup  after missing New Zealand’s opener against Tonga
because of injuries.  The back-rowers are unavailable for the Sept. 9 game in
Auckland after getting hurt in the 25-20 loss to Australia three
days ago, team doctor Deb Robinson said today in a statement.  No. 8 Read has a torn ankle ligament that will keep him out
of action for most of the group matches. Flanker Thompson should
recover from an elbow injury in time for New Zealand’s second
game against  Japan  on Sept. 16.  “Both of them were dreading the scan and the result,” All
Blacks assistant coach Steve Hansen told reporters. “So for us
and for them this is more positive in that they’ll get to play
in the tournament at some point.”  Captain  Richie McCaw ,  Jerome Kaino  and Victor Vito will
fill the back-row positions with Sam Whitelock providing backup,
Hansen added.  Read and Thomson will remain with the squad as they undergo
their rehabilitation. After opening the 20-team  World Cup 
against Tonga, tournament favorite New Zealand faces Japan,
France and Canada in its other pool matches.  “We don’t want either one of those players to be out of
the tournament,” Hansen said. “If you replace them, they can’t
come back so they will be at training, just watching for a
while.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
