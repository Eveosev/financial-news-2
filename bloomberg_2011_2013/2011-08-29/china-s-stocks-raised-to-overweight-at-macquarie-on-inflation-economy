China ’s stocks were raised to
“overweight” from “neutral” at Macquarie Bank Ltd. as data
signal inflation is being contained and there’s no risk of a so-
called hard landing for the economy.  “China’s policymakers are likely shifting back to a more
balanced emphasis on both growth and inflation,”  Michael Kurtz ,
Hong Kong-based head of Asian strategy at Macquarie, said in a
report distributed on Aug. 27. “The mere fact that inflation is
now better contained substantially reduces risks of policy
oversteps and unwelcome growth downside, going forward.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
