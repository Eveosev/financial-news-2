     Aug. 29 (Bloomberg) -- Sohu.com Inc. (SOHU) , operator of China’s
fifth-most visited website, soared to the highest level in two

of its online game unit.  Sohu’s American depositary receipts gained 5.7 percent to
$79.49 at 10:47 a.m. New York time. It jumped as much as 6.2

outstanding ADRs in one year’s time starting from Sept. 1, the
parent company said in a statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
