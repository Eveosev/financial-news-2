Oil extended its gain in  New York 
after a report that showed U.S. consumer spending climbed more
than forecast in July, spurring speculation of recovering demand
in the worldâ€™s biggest crude consumer.  Futures climbed as much as 1.8 percent after the Commerce
Department said purchases last month had their biggest gain
since February. Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said
Aug. 26 growth is safe in the long run and the central bank can
still aid the recovery. Refineries along the East Coast were
operating at or near normal levels after Irene weakened.  Crude for October delivery on the New York Mercantile
Exchange rose as much as $1.55 to $86.92 and was at $86.70 at
1:40 p.m. London time.  Consumer purchases rose 0.8 percent after a 0.1 percent
decline the prior month, Commerce Department figures showed
today in  Washington . The median estimate of 74 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News called for a 0.5 percent increase.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
