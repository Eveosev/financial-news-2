Libya’s opposition National
Transitional Council has “won” its battle to oust Muammar Qaddafi from power, said  Jean Ping , the chairman of the  African
Union ’s commission.  “It’s a necessity to stop fighting today because it’s
over,” Ping told reporters today in the Ethiopian capital, Addis
Ababa. Continued conflict is “prolonging the suffering of the
Libyan people.”  Ping made his announcement three days after the African
Union decided to withhold its support for the Libyan rebels,
calling instead for an “all-inclusive” interim government. The
54-member AU couldn’t give its backing to the council because
fighting was continuing, South African President Jacob Zuma told
reporters on Aug. 26.  The African Union never said that Qaddafi should be
included in a transitional administration, Ping said, and the
group will recognize a new government if it is “inclusive and
consensual” and “reflects  Libya .”  Nigeria and Ethiopia broke ranks with the AU last week by
recognizing the rebel group, joining France, Italy, U.K., U.S.,
Germany and the Arab League.  To contact the reporter on this story:
