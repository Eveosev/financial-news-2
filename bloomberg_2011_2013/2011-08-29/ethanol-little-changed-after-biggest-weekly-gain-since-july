Ethanol futures were little changed
in  Chicago  after the fuel’s biggest weekly gain since July
erased its discount to gasoline.  Futures were steady as ethanol settled higher than gasoline
for the sixth time this year. Gasoline’s premium reached 86.68
cents on April 28. A smaller discount gives refiners less
incentive to blend ethanol into gasoline.  “Ethanol looked pretty quiet,” said Matt Janney, a trader
at Citigroup Global Markets Inc. in Chicago. It’s taking a
breather. It may be just a short-term, one-day breather.’’  Denatured ethanol for September delivery fell 0.3 cent to
$2.926 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade, 1.96 cents more
than the September gasoline contract. Ethanol has gained 23
percent this year to gasoline’s 18 percent.  In cash market trading ethanol in Chicago jumped 2.5 cents,
or 0.9 percent, to $2.925 a gallon and on the West Coast the
additive increased 2 cents, or 0.7 percent, to $3.08, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in the U.S. Gulf added 0.5 cent to $3.025.  The biofuel last week traded at a 2.86-cent premium to
gasoline, the biggest since Nov. 11. That compares to an average
20.23-cent discount over the past year. Refiners receive a 45-
cent tax credit for each gallon of ethanol blended into
gasoline, in addition to being able to capture the spread
between the two when ethanol is cheaper.  The profit from turning a bushel of corn into 2.75 gallons
of ethanol, or the so-called crush margin, was 18 cents today,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
