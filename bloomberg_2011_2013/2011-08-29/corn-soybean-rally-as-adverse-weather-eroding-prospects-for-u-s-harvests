Corn rallied to an 11-week high and
soybeans touched the highest price since February on speculation
that dry weather during the next two weeks will erode yields in
the U.S., after a July heat wave damaged plants.  The next two weeks will have less rain than normal from
 Nebraska  to  Indiana , leaving about a third of the main growing
areas in the Midwest too dry, Bethesda, Maryland-based  Commodity
Weather Group LLC  said today in today in a report. Average
temperatures in July were as much as 8 degrees Fahrenheit above
normal, expanding drought conditions from the Great Plains to
the Midwest,  government data show .  “The fear is that supply is falling faster than demand,”
 Don Roose , the president of U.S. Commodities Inc. in  West Des
Moines ,  Iowa , said in a telephone interview. “Oppressive heat
in July damaged crops, and now the dry weather is further
reducing yields.”  Corn futures for December delivery rose 3 cents, or 0.4
percent, to settle at $7.70 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the Chicago
Board of Trade, after touching $7.79, the highest for the most-
active contract since June 9. Prices are up 77 percent in the
past year, including 15 percent this month.  Soybean futures for November delivery climbed 23.5 cents,
or 1.7 percent, to $14.47 a bushel on the CBOT, after touching
$14.54, the highest for a most-active contract since Feb. 10.  Morgan Stanley lowered its estimates for corn and soybean
yields in the U.S., citing unfavorable weather and poor crop
conditions.  Smaller Crops  U.S. farmers will harvest a smaller corn crop than forecast
by the government this month, the Professional Farmers of
America newsletter said after sponsoring the 19th annual tour of
Midwest fields in seven states last week.  About 12.484 billion bushels of corn will be harvested,
less than the 12.914 billion forecast by the  U.S. Department of
Agriculture  on Aug. 11, Pro Farmer said on Aug. 26. Soybean
output will be 3.083 billion bushels, above the USDA’s
projection of 3.056 billion, the group said, noting that the
forecast was dependent on the crop getting rain in the next two
weeks to finish filling beans in pods.  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $66.7 billion in
2010, followed by soybeans at $38.9 billion, USDA data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
