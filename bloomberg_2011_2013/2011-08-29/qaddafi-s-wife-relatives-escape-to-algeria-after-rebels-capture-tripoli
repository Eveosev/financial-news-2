(Corrects spelling of Qaddafi’s wife in second paragraph.
See EXTRA for more on the conflict.)  Members of  Muammar Qaddafi ’s family
have arrived in  Algeria  less than a week after rebels gained
control of Tripoli and the National Transitional Council moved
its headquarters to the capital.  The family members include his wife Safia, his daughter
Aisha, and two sons, Hannibal and Mohammad, with their wives and
children, state-run Algérie Presse Service  reported today ,
citing a statement by the country’s foreign ministry. NTC Prime
Minister Mahmoud Jibril and UN Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon
have been informed of their arrival, the statement said.  Rebels have been trying to find Muammar Qaddafi,
consolidate gains and bring stability to the country since
entering Tripoli last week, backed by airstrikes from the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization. The rebel council moved its
headquarters to the capital from Benghazi on Aug. 24.  Qaddafi is still in  Libya , Moussa Ibrahim, his chief
spokesman, said in a phone call to the Associated Press in  New
York  yesterday from Tripoli, without saying where the Libyan
leader was located.  Algeria has adhered to a policy of “strict neutrality”
throughout the Libya crisis and respects “the decision of every
person under its sovereignty,” Foreign Minister Amar Belan said
in a statement published on the  ministry website Aug. 27 .
Algeria has no intention to “interfere in any manner whatsoever
in the internal affairs” of Libya.  To contact the reporters on this story:
