The lira rose to the strongest level
against the dollar in more than three weeks as traders viewed
recent declines as excessive.  “Turkish lira weakness is somewhat overdone and further
weakness is capped,” Henza Tukel, a currency trader at Turk
Ekonomi Bankasi AS in Istanbul wrote by instant message today.
“Last Thursday and Friday the lira gained strength very
significantly, so in case there’s bad news flow, a retracement”
is possible.  The lira climbed as much as 1.1 percent to 1.7308 per
dollar, its highest intraday level since Aug. 5. The currency
advanced 1 percent to 1.7336 at 6 p.m.  The lira has been the world’s worst-performer among 31
major currencies, losing 12 percent this year as concerns about
 Turkey ’s expanding current-account deficit drove the currency
lower. The central bank says the current account will begin to
improve in the second half of the year, driven in part by a
weaker currency that makes Turkish exports relatively less
expensive and imports relatively more expensive.  Governor Erdem Basci said Aug. 15 the currency was
undervalued, when the lira was trading at around 1.77 per
dollar.  Trading in the lira was subdued as a three-and-a-half-day
vacation to mark the end of the Ramadan holy month of fasting
began at lunchtime today. Markets are due to reopen on Sept. 2.  “Price action is really one way, and there’s not much
depth to it,” Tukel said. “The major players are all absent.”  Yields on two-year benchmark lira bonds were unchanged at
7.97 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
