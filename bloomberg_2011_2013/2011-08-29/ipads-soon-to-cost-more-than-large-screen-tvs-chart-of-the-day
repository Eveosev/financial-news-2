Television prices have fallen so
much that a typical set will soon cost less than an  Apple Inc. (AAPL) 
iPad that’s less than a tenth the size.  The CHART OF THE DAY shows average prices of 42-inch
liquid-crystal-display TVs in the U.S. will probably fall 10
percent to $599 this quarter from a year earlier, and slip to
$578 by the end of the year, according to  Santa Clara ,
California-based research firm DisplaySearch. IPad tablet
computers are sold for $499 to $829 in the U.S., with Apple
offering the Wi-Fi only, 32-gigabyte version for $599.  The price drop illustrates why none of the industry’s five-
largest producers, including Samsung Electronics Co. and  Sony
Corp. (6758) , have managed to generate even a nickel of profit for
every dollar in sales from their TV divisions since last year.
Falling prices will likely continue pressuring earnings, said
Jeff Loff, a Tokyo-based analyst at Macquarie Group Ltd.  “The value consumers ascribe to a TV set is lower than
most manufacturers’ costs,” Loff said in a phone interview.
“Even incremental features like 3-D, Internet connectivity and
enhanced motion processing do not generate enough of a price
lift to turn TV sets profitable.”  In the U.S., the first color RCA-brand TV with 12-inch
screen was offered at $1,000 in 1954. Suwon, South Korea-based
Samsung, now the largest TV maker, began offering 40-inch LCD
sets for about $8,000 in 2002. Sharp Corp.,  Japan ’s largest LCD
maker, retailed the company’s first 45-inch sets in 2004 at
997,500 yen ($13,000).  Apple, whose co-founder  Steve Jobs  resigned last week as
chief executive officer, has kept iPad prices unchanged since it
introduced the first model in January 2010.  To contact the reporters on this story:
