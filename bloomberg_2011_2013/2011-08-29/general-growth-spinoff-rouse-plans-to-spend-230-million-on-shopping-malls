Rouse Properties Inc., the mall
owner that will be spun off from  General Growth Properties Inc. (GGP) ,
plans to spend $230 million on improvements to its malls through
2015 as rents and occupancies fall.  Rouse expects the investment will lift its occupancy rate
to 93 percent and annual net operating income to more than $200
million, the Chicago-based company said in a regulatory filing
today. The occupancy rate was 87.7 percent at the end of June,
down from 88.2 percent at the end of 2010. Average rent fell to
$39.09 a square foot from $39.74.  General Growth, which left bankruptcy protection in
November, said Aug. 1 it planned a spinoff of 30 malls to
shareholders through a special dividend. They will be
transferred to a new publicly traded REIT, Rouse. General Growth
spent $11.3 billion to buy commercial-property developer Rouse
Co. in 2004.  “Our mission is to own and manage dominant Class B
regional malls in secondary and tertiary markets, and to
reposition Class B regional malls in primary markets,” Rouse
said in the filing. “We plan to increase the value of our
properties by executing tailored business plans designed to
improve their operating performance.”  Some of the malls that will be included in the Rouse
portfolio need to be redeveloped to attract tenants, according
to the filing. Some are in one-mall markets in smaller U.S.
cities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
