Former International Monetary Fund
chief  Dominique Strauss-Kahn , who had sexual-assault charges
dismissed in New York last week, met with his successor and said
goodbye to the IMF staff at the fund headquarters today.  William Murray , spokesman for the IMF, said that Strauss-
Kahn met with Managing Director  Christine Lagarde  and with
employees, while he did not disclose the content of the talks.  Strauss-Kahn, who resigned in May, “has indicated that, on
a personal visit to the Fund later today, he would like to have
the opportunity to say goodbye to staff,” according to an e-
mail sent to employees earlier today and obtained by Bloomberg.
“All staff who would like to do so can meet with him this
afternoon.”  Reporters saw the former IMF leader driving into the
institution’s parking garage shortly after 3:30 p.m. today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
