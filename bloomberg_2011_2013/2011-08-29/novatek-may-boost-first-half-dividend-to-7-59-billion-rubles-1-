OAO Novatek,  Russia ’s second-biggest
natural-gas producer, may increase its first-half dividend by 67
percent to 7.59 billion rubles ($263 million) after profit rose.  Novatek may pay 2.5 rubles per ordinary share, the Tarko-
Sale-based company said today in an e-mailed statement. That
compares with a payout of 1.5 rubles a share, or a total of 4.55
billion rubles, a year earlier.  The dividend, recommended by the board yesterday, would be
Novatek’s highest interim payout, beating a Bloomberg analyst
estimate of 1.87 rubles a share, according to  data  compiled by
Bloomberg. Novatek reported an 82 percent increase in net income
in the first half as higher output and prices pushed up sales.  “It is positive and deserves investor interest,” Pavel Sorokin, an oil and gas analyst at Alfa Bank, said by telephone.
While the proposed dividend increase is less than the jump in
profit, “that’s not worrying because the company is undergoing
intensive growth.”  Novatek rose 4.1 percent to 353.94 rubles at the 6:45 p.m.
close of trade in Moscow, the biggest one-day gain in five
weeks. The stock has advanced 64 percent in 12 months.  Russia’s largest gas producer is OAO Gazprom.  To contact the reporters on this story:
