Eskom Holdings SOC Ltd., South
Africa’s state-owned energy utility, should raise electricity
prices by the rate of inflation after 2012, according to the
Energy Intensive Users Group, which represents companies
including  Xstrata Plc (XTA)  and  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP)   Eskom earlier indicated that it will need to raise prices
by 25 percent in both 2013 and 2014, according to the group’s
head, Mike Rossouw. Such increases would threaten ferrochrome
and other metals operations in South Africa, he told reporters
in Johannesburg today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
