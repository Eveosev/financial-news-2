Japan must take fiscal measures to
shrink its  budget deficit , said  Thomas Byrne , a vice president
at Moody’s Investors Service in Singapore, when asked to comment
on Yoshihiko Noda’s selection today as incoming prime minister.  The “stable” outlook Moody’s has on Japan’s debt rating,
lowered to Aa3 last week, means the company expects “some sort
of progress on deficit reduction in the immediate years ahead,”
Byrne said in a telephone interview. The developed world’s most
indebted nation cannot rely on economic growth alone to contain
its expanding obligations, making it essential for the new
administration to unveil more details on a plan that outlines
measures to reform its tax and social security systems, he said.  Byrne added that the task for Noda, who was elected by
 Democratic Party  of Japan lawmakers to succeed Prime Minister
 Naoto Kan  as party chief, would be to stay in office for long
enough to oversee the implementation of measures to mend its
finances. Noda said at a press conference he plans for the Diet
to vote tomorrow for him to become prime minister.  To contact the reporter on this story:
