Olam International Ltd. (OLAM) , a
commodities supplier partly owned by Singapore’s Temasek
Holdings Pte, reported a 38 percent gain in fourth-quarter
profit as trading volumes increased.  Net income climbed to S$127.4 million ($106 million) in the
three months ended June 30 from S$92.3 million a year ago,
Singapore-based Olam said today in a statement. Excluding one-
time gains, profit grew 4.9 percent to S$106 million. Sales
increased 44 percent to S$4.52 billion as trading volumes across
all four of Olam’s main business areas rose.  Olam, one of the world’s top three suppliers of rice, cocoa
and coffee, is expanding in cotton in  Ghana  and funding new rice
field irrigation systems in Mozambique as it seeks to secure
more sources of the commodities it trades and boost production.
The company aims to more than triple its annual profit after tax
to $1 billion in 2016, it said.  Net income grew 24 percent to S$430 million in the year
ended in June 30, beating the $368.9 million mean forecast of 20
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Temasek Holdings’s deemed stake in Olam fell below 13
percent after the commodity supplier sold new shares and because
of “dealings” by associate companies of the  Singapore  state-
owned investment fund, Olam said July 7.  Share Decline  Olam has slumped 17 percent in Singapore since March 31,
more than the benchmark’s 10 percent, as concern about U.S.
economic growth and  Europe ’s debt crisis curbed prices. The
stock became one of the cheapest in the top 30 companies covered
by Credit Suisse Group AG in Singapore, based on share price-to-
book value,  Switzerland ’s second-biggest bank said in an Aug. 23
note.  Olam’s raising of $740 million from share sales and almost
S$1.5 billion through debt over the last year helped it move
into a “a very strong position to navigate through the current
dislocation in the capital markets and take advantage of
opportunities as they emerge in the markets that are consistent
with our long-term strategies,” Chief Financial Officer Krishnan Ravikumar said today in the statement.  The company is open to more acquisitions and is interested
in investing in the Brazilian sugar industry, Chief Executive
Officer Sunny Verghese said today at an earnings conference in
Singapore. Sugar prices will continue to rise, he said. Raw
sugar has gained 57 percent in the past year on ICE Futures U.S.
in  New York .  Cashews, Spices  Olam, which is building a $1.3 billion fertilizer plant in
the Republic of Gabon, is expanding its assets with palm-oil
plantations, sugar refineries and wheat milling to meet African
and Asian demand. Olam has said it plans to move into farming of
cashews, spices, grains and sugar by 2015.  The company plans to add farming assets to its trading
business to capture the higher margins certain commodities offer
if produced rather than processed or traded, Verghese said in an
interview in February.  The basket of commodities Olam trades in jumped 32.3
percent in value from June 1, 2010, to June 30 this year, the
company said. The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Agriculture Index
jumped 48.4 percent in the same period, Olam said.  Sales volume grew 21 percent to 8.5 million metric tons
over the fiscal 2011 ending June 30, the company said. Revenue
gained 50.5 percent in the period to S$15.73 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
