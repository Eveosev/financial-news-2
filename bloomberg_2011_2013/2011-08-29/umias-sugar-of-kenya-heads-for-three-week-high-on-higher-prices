Mumias Sugar Co.,  Kenya ’s biggest
miller of the sweetener, rose to the strongest in almost three
weeks on expectations that higher prices for the commodity will
boost its earnings in the current financial year.  The shares climbed 1.6 percent to 6.40 shillings as of the
3 p.m. close in the capital, Nairobi. This is the strongest
level since Aug. 11.  “What is supporting the share price is the prices both in
the domestic and international markets,” Wycliffe Masinde, an
analyst at Nairobi-based Kestrel Capital East Africa Ltd., said
by phone. Sugar prices in Kenya will likely remain “relatively
high in the medium term” because local processors are unable to
meet increasing demand, Mumias said Aug. 26.  World sugar prices are $700 and $800 per metric ton due to
reduced supply, Mumias said today in a statement in Nairobi-
based Business Daily. The prices are expected to retreat to $700
to $730 from March, the company said.  “The region is experiencing even higher sugar prices
attributed to production-consumption deficit,” it said.  Sugar prices have climbed 23 percent this year, with the
contract for delivery in October adding 1.9 percent to 30.22
cents on Aug. 26.  To contact the reporter on this story:
