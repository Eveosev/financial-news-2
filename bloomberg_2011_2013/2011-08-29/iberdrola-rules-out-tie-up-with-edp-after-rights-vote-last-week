Iberdrola SA (IBE)  said it’s not
considering an acquisition of EDP-Energias de Portugal SA, that
country’s largest electricity company, after an EDP
shareholders’ meeting failed to change Iberdrola’s stance.  Iberdrola,  Spain ’s biggest power utility, hasn’t altered
plans for its holding in EDP following the Aug. 25 meeting, said
an official at the Bilbao, Spain-based utility, declining to be
identified in line with company policy. Iberdrola is EDP’s
largest shareholder after the Portuguese state, with about 6.8
percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  EDP ended the government’s “golden share” veto rights and
changed the limits on voting at the meeting, as it seeks to
attract new investment amid Portugal’s plans to sell its stake.
Individual investors can now vote as much as 20 percent of the
company’s stock, up from 5 percent previously.  Portugal ’s government intends to sell 20.9 percent in EDP
by the end of the year. Iberdrola Chairman Ignacio Sanchez Galan
has said in recent weeks that the company will focus on organic
growth rather than acquisitions.  Iberdrola’s average return on equity over the past three
years is 9.8 percent, compared with 14.7 percent at EDP,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
