Nordea AB, the Nordic region’s
biggest bank, said it plans to cut a total of 2,000 workers and
has started talks with unions on the reductions to trim costs
and boost profits.  “To increase efficiency is never easy,” Chief Executive
Officer Christian Clausen said today in a statement. “But we
will act early and from a position of strength. By initiating
measures to increase profitability early, we safeguard our good
rating, competitive funding and thus our ability to offer
products and services at the right price to our customers. The
alternative - to wait and see - is not an option,” he said.  In order to meet its financial targets, including a 15
percent return on equity, the lender plans to cut a total of
2,000 workers this year and in 2012. It said between 500 and 600
workers would be reduced in  Denmark , Finland and in  Sweden 
respectively, while up to 300 workers would go in  Norway . The
company now has some 34,000 employees, it said.  European banks are slashing jobs this year six times faster
than their U.S. peers, according to data compiled by Bloomberg,
as concerns about the creditworthiness of  Italy ,  Spain  and
 France  roil financial markets and reduce income from fixed-
income trading, stock and bond underwriting as well as mergers
and acquisitions. Financial firms are also cutting costs as
regulators force banks to hold more and better quality capital
to withstand future shocks.  Nordea shares, which have fallen 23 percent so far this
year, were trading up 1 percent at 56.1 kronor at 12:00 p.m. in
 Stockholm , level with the Bloomberg Europe Banks and Financial
Services Index.  Nordea said its ambition is to reach a “large share” of the
reduction in staff cost through natural turnover and voluntary
agreements. The lender will continue to make other cost and
efficiency steps in the autumn and give savings and cost
estimates later this year, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
