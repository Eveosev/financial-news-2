German  Chancellor Angela Merkel ’s
ruling bloc of  Christian Democrats  and Free Democrats may lack a
majority to secure passage of a bill to expand the euro’s
temporary rescue fund, the  Handelsblatt  reported.  As many as 23 coalition lawmakers may reject the bill
that’s due in parliament next month, said the newspaper, without
citing names. That underscores her dependence on the oppostion
to ensure ratification.  To gain passage of the bill on the coalition’s own
strength, Merkel needs 311 votes in favor of the changes among
the  620  lawmakers sitting in parliament’s lower chamber in
Berlin. Her bloc comprises 330 lawmakers, implying that the
German chancellor may lack 4 votes to achieve a coalition
majority if 23 vote against the bill, Handelsblatt said.  Euro-region leaders have pressed parliaments to secure
fast-track approval to revamp the fund, called the European
Financial Stability Facility, relieving or partly relieving the
 European Central Bank ’s emergency debt purchase program.  To contact the reporter on this story:
