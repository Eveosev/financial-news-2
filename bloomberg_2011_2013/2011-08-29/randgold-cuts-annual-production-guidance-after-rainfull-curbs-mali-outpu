Randgold Resources Ltd. (RRS) , a miner of
the precious metal in  Africa , reduced its full-year production
guidance by as much as 3.8 percent as rain cut output in Mali.  Randgold lowered its forecast to 740,000 to 760,000 ounces
from 750,000 to 790,000 ounces, the St. Helier, Jersey-based
company said today in an e-mailed statement.  The reduction in guidance comes less than a month after
Randgold said it was on schedule to meet its full-year target.
“Abnormal” rainfall has since swamped the pumping capacity at
the company’s Gara and Gounkoto pits and affected the mining
schedule, Chief Executive Officer  Mark Bristow  said today.  Revising its third-quarter forecast, Randgold said it aims
to exceed the 80,000 ounces it produced at the Loulo-Gounkoto
complex in the last quarter, scrapping an earlier 100,000-ounce
target. “Provided the Loulo mining schedule and supply routes
get back to normal during September, fourth-quarter production
is expected to get back to planned levels,” Bristow said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
