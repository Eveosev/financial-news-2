Trans Hex Group Ltd. (TSX) ,  Africa ’s
biggest publicly traded diamond producer, said it plans to exit
the Fucauma and Luarica projects in  Angola  as talks over funding
new exploration at the sites failed to reached an agreement.  “Exit discussions are underway” between the partners
about the projects the Cape Town-based company said in an e-
mailed response to questions today. The two mines halted
production in May 2009 when Trans Hex and its partner, Endiama
EP, mothballed the operations in response to the global
financial crisis, which led to a slump in diamond demand.  Endiama, Angola’s state-owned gem company, now plans new
exploration at the sites with a view to restarting production,
Chairman Antonio Carlos Sumbula told reporters in the northern
town of Dundo on Aug. 27. The group also plans more exploration
at Lucapa, which it operates with  Portugal ’s Sociedade
Portuguesa de Empreendimentos SPE, he said.  “We have many new investors with whom we have had contact
to replace” Endiama’s existing partners at the sites, Sumbula
said, declining to comment further.  Shares in Trans Hex, which owns about 35 percent of Luarica
and 32 percent of Fucauma, were unchanged at 3.20 rand as of 4
p.m. in Johannesburg, having fallen 18 percent during the last
12 months.  -- Editors: Alastair Reed,  Gordon Bell .  To contact the reporters on this story:
