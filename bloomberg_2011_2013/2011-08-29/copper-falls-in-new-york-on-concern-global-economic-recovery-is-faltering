Copper fell for the first time in
five sessions on concern that the global economic recovery is
faltering.  World economic expansion will slow to 3 percent this year
from 4.2 percent in 2010, and growth will remain subdued until
2015, the Centre for Economics and Business Research said today
in an e-mailed statement. Copper has fallen 8.3 percent in
August, heading for the biggest monthly drop since January 2010,
amid escalating debt woes in Europe and the U.S.  “We are so depressed right now,” Phil Streible, a senior
strategist at MF Global Holdings Ltd., said today in a telephone
interview from  Chicago . “The housing market is going nowhere,
the job market is slower than anticipated, and global growth is
so fractured. People would be happy with a lollipop.”  Copper futures for December delivery fell 0.8 cent, or 0.2
percent, to close at $4.1095 a pound at 1:12 p.m. on the Comex
in New York. The price climbed 2.9 percent last week, the most
since July 1, as Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke 
indicated growth isn’t weak enough to warrant immediate
stimulus.  The U.S. is the world’s largest consumer of copper after
 China . The London Metal Exchange is closed for a holiday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
