Shareholders of  Brasil Ecodiesel
Industria e Comercio de Biocombustiveis e Oleos Vegetais SA (ECOD3) , the
Brazilian biodiesel maker, will vote on merging with Vanguarda
do Brasil SA on Sept. 6.  Brasil Ecodiesel plans to issue new shares and swap them
with those of Vanguarda, an agribusiness, Sao Paulo-based Brasil
Ecodiesel said today in a regulatory filing.  The vote was originally scheduled for Aug. 26. It had to be
postponed because too few shareholders were present, a spokesman
for Veremonte Participacoes SA said in an e-mail that same day.
Veremonte’s chief executive officer is chairman of Brasil
Ecodiesel’s board.  To contact the reporter on this story:
