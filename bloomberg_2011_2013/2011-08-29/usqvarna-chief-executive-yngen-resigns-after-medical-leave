Husqvarna AB (HUSQB)  Chief Executive Officer
Magnus Yngen, who took a medical leave of absence in June,
resigned and the company said it’s looking for a new CEO.  Yngen and the board of the world’s largest garden power-
equipment company “agreed that Husqvarna is better served by a
new CEO and president” following his leave of absence, the
Huskvarna, Sweden-based company said in a statement.  Hans Linnarson, who took over when Yngen left in June, will
continue to serve as acting CEO until a permanent replacement is
found, the company said.  The stock rose as much as 4.1 percent and was up 4 percent
at 31.25 kronor as of 3:13 p.m. in  Stockholm  trading. Husqvarna
has plunged 44 percent this year as production problems at its
biggest plant in  North America  dragged down the company’s sales
and operating profit.  The North America production issue “is still on the agenda
but appears to be fairly under control now,”  said Carl Holmquist, a Danske Bank analyst in Stockholm who recommends
investors buy Husqvarna shares. The company’s biggest challenges
include moving production to low-cost countries, he said.  Yngen also resigned from Husqvarna’s board.  To contact the reporter on this story:
