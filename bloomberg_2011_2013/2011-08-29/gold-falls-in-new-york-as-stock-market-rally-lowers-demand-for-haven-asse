Gold fell in New York after equities
rallied, eroding the appeal of the precious metal as a haven
asset.  Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  on Aug. 25 said
the central bank has tools to stimulate the economy, without
signaling whether policy makers will embark on a third round of
so-called quantitative easing. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
rose 4.7 percent last week after dropping 16 percent in the
previous four weeks. Gold fell 3 percent last week after surging
to a record $1,917.90 an ounce on Aug. 23 in New York.  “With Bernanke sitting on the sideline, investors see more
upside in equities,” Matt Zeman, a strategist at Kingsview
Financial in  Chicago , said in a telephone interview. “Gold is
falling because people are chasing equities. The risk trade is
back on.”  Gold futures for December delivery fell $5.70, or 0.3
percent, to settle at $1,791.60 at 1:48 p.m. on the Comex in  New
York . Earlier, the price rose as much as 2.5 percent and fell as
much as 0.9 percent.  “Gold’s run isn’t over yet,” said Zeman. “People have
been chasing this market so any sizable dip is going to be met
with buying.”  Prices have surged 26 percent this year as escalating U.S.
and European debt woes, sliding equity markets and declining
prospects for global growth boosted the appeal of bullion as an
alternative asset.  Silver futures for December delivery lost 40 cents, or 1
percent, to $40.601 an ounce on the Comex.  Platinum futures for October delivery dropped $1.90, or 0.1
percent, to $1,825 an ounce on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .
Palladium futures for December delivery fell $2.35, or 0.3
percent, to $755.75 an ounce on the Nymex.  To contact the reporter on this story:
