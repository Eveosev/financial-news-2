Japanese stocks rose for a fourth
day, the longest winning streak since July, with carmakers
advancing as U.S. consumer spending rose more than forecast.
Japan’s parliament today confirmed Finance Minister  Yoshihiko Noda  as the next prime minister.  Honda Motor Co., which gets 40 percent of its revenue from
 North America , climbed 1 percent after U.S. auto sales increased
and  Federal Reserve  Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  last week indicated
the  U.S. economy  may not need more stimulus.  Sony Corp. (6758)  gained
3.5 percent after the Yomiuri newspaper reported it will form a
venture to produce liquid-crystal displays with  Toshiba Corp. (6502) 
and  Hitachi Ltd. (6501)   The  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average rose 1.2 percent to 8,953.90
as of the 3 p.m. trading close in Tokyo. The broader Topix index
advanced 1.1 percent to 767.30. For the month through yesterday,
the Nikkei fell 8.9 percent, set for the biggest monthly loss
since May 2010, while the Topix was down 8.8 percent.  “U.S. economic data have lifted the mood,” said  Ayako Sera , a market strategist at Sumitomo Trust & Banking Co., which
manages the equivalent of $325 billion. “The market is
regaining confidence after Bernanke tried to not stoke pessimism
in his speech.”  New Premier  The lower house of parliament elected Noda prime minister
after the ruling Democratic Party of  Japan  yesterday chose him
to succeed Naoto Kan. As Kan’s finance minister, Noda advocated
an increase in levies to help finance disaster reconstruction,
something opposed by his challengers in the race.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 0.1 percent
today. In  New York , the index rose 2.8 percent yesterday after
the reports showing rising consumer spending and incomes
overshadowed a drop in pending home sales, easing concern the
U.S. is slipping into a recession.  Purchases rose 0.8 percent, the biggest gain since February,
Commerce Department figures showed. Incomes grew 0.3 percent and
the savings rate dropped to a four-month low as Americans dipped
into their savings to buy cars and home appliances. The number
of contracts to purchase previously owned homes fell in July for
the first time in three months.  “Japan is ready to tackle various tasks such as
reconstruction at least for the next year,” said Takashi Hiroki,
chief strategist at Monex Securities in Tokyo. “The U.S.
economy isn’t as bad as people had worried. The market has hit
the bottom on speculation the economy can avoid the worst kind
of recession due to the Federal Reserve’s policy.”  Automakers advanced with Honda rising 1 percent to 2,438
yen.  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , the world’s biggest carmaker, advanced
0.2 percent to 2,721 yen.  Exporters  Exporters rose and the electric appliances sector gave the
biggest support to the Topix index.  Canon Inc. (7751) , the world’s
biggest camera maker, climbed 0.9 percent to 3,575 yen. Sony,
Japan’s No. 1 exporter of consumer electronics, gained 3.5
percent to 1,695 yen.  Sony also rose after the Yomiuri newspaper reported that it
will form a venture to produce liquid-crystal displays with
Toshiba Corp. and Hitachi Ltd. Toshiba advanced 2.1 percent to
339 yen. Hitachi rose 1.2 percent to 411 yen.  Banks were the second-biggest contributor to the Topix
index’s advance after EFG Eurobank Ergasias SA and Alpha Bank SA
agreed to merge and create Greece’s biggest bank, driving the
ASE Index to the largest gain in 21 years. Alpha Bank will
acquire Eurobank as they seek to ride out a deepening recession
and the country’s sovereign debt crisis.  Konami Gains  Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group rose 1.8 percent to 340 yen.
 Mizuho Financial Group Inc. (8411) , Japan’s third-largest bank by
market value, rose 0.9 percent to 114 yen.  Konami Corp. (9766) , a video-game developer, jumped 7.2 percent to
2,818 yen, the highest close since September 2008. Konami’s
first-quarter earnings were boosted by sales of its social-
network games and the business will probably continue to grow,
