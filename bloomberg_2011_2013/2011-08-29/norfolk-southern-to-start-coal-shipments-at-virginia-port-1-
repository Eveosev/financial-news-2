Norfolk Southern Corp. (NSC) , the second-
biggest eastern U.S. railroad, said it plans to resume coal
exports from its Lamberts Point Terminal in Norfolk, Virginia,
later today.  The company halted operations at the port over the weekend
as Hurricane Irene marched up the U.S. East Coast. Lamberts
Point has the capacity to ship 36 million tons of coal annually,
Robin Chapman, a company spokesman, said today in a telephone
interview.  “We’re starting to load at Lamberts Point this
afternoon,” Chapman said.  The railroad serves mines from Illinois to  Pennsylvania  and
the port typically operates 24 hours, seven days a week,
according to the company’s website.  To contact the reporters on this story:
