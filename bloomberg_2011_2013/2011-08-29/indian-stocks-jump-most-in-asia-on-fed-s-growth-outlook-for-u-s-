Indian equities were  Asia ’s biggest
gainers after Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said the
world’s biggest economy is gradually recovering and didn’t
extend steps that may stoke commodity prices and fan inflation.  Reliance Industries Ltd. (RIL) , owner of the world’s largest
refinery complex, rose the most in 22 months.  Hindalco
Industries Ltd. (HNDL) , the aluminum producer that controls U.S.-based
Novelis Inc., climbed the most in a week. Infosys Ltd., a
software exporter, paced gains among peers. Five out of the 30
stocks on the benchmark index surged more than 5 percent.  The Bombay Stock Exchange Sensitive Index, or Sensex,
gained 604.39, or 3.8 percent, to 16,453.22, according to
preliminary closing prices at 3:30 p.m. in Mumbai, its steepest
rally since May 2009. The gauge dropped for a fifth week last
week, its longest such run of losses since October 2008 when the
collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. froze credit markets.
The S&P CNX Nifty Index rose 3.6 percent to 4,919.60. Its
September futures settled at 4,939.55.  To contact the reporters on this story:
