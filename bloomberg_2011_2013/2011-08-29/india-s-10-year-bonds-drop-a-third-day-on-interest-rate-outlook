India ’s 10-year bonds dropped for a
third day on speculation the central bank will boost borrowing
costs for the sixth time this year to curb inflation.  Yields rose to a three-week high after a government report
showed last week food inflation quickened to 9.8 percent in the
week ended Aug. 13 from from 9.03 percent in the previous such
period. The  Reserve Bank  of India raised its repurchase rate by
1.75 percentage points this year to 8 percent to slow price
increases. Policy makers are due to review rates on Sept. 16.  “There is still an upward bias to bond yields,” said
Krishnamurthy Harihar, a Mumbai-based treasurer at FirstRand
Ltd. “Inflation concerns persist and you can expect a rate hike
in the next policy review.”  The yield on the 7.8 percent bonds due April 2021 rose two
basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 8.33 percent as of
the 5 p.m. close in Mumbai, according to the central bank’s
trading system. That is the highest level since Aug. 4.  The cost of one-year interest-rate swaps, or derivative
contracts used to guard against fluctuations in borrowing costs,
increased seven basis points to 7.82 percent, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
