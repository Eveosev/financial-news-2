Producers of construction materials
and builders rose after tropical storm Irene hit the U.S.,
leaving a trail of damage from  North Carolina  to Maine.  Masco Corp. (MAS) , an insulation installer, gained 9.9 percent to
$8.85 for the second-biggest advance in the Standard & Poor’s
500 Index. U.S. Steel Corp., the largest U.S. steelmaker by
volume, increased 9 percent to $30.04 and  AK Steel Holding
Corp. (AKS) , the third-largest U.S. steelmaker, added 6.1 percent to
$9.10. The five-member S&P 500 Steel Index surged 5.6 percent
while a gauge of 12 homebuilders across S&P indexes for U.S.
equities advanced 4.4 percent.  Irene struck  New York  City yesterday at around 9 a.m. local
time as a tropical storm with winds of 65 miles (105 kilometers)
per hour, before pushing into New England. The storm caused
rivers to surge and knocked out power to more than 6 million
customers in 12 states and the District of Columbia. At least 18
people died from  Puerto Rico  to Connecticut.  Hurricane Irene’s estimated cost to insurers fell to about
$2.6 billion, according to Kinetic Analysis Corp. That compares
with a projection last week from the Silver Spring, Maryland-
based company of as much as $14 billion when Irene was forecast
to make landfall in New York as a Category 2 hurricane. Total
economic losses, including those that aren’t insured, may be
about $7 billion.  Alcoa Inc. (AA) , the world’s second-largest aluminum producer,
climbed 4.7 percent to $12.42, while  Reliance Steel & Aluminum
Co. (RS) , a U.S. metals distributor, jumped 5.1 percent to $40.87 and
 Titanium Metals Corp. (TIE)  rose 8.9 percent to $15.41. PulteGroup
Inc., the nation’s biggest homebuilder, rose 3.1 percent to
$4.62, while  KB Home (KBH)  rallied 6.6 percent to $6.26.  To contact the reporter on this story:
