Following is the text of the Chicago Fed’s Midwest
Economic Activity Index from the Federal  Reserve Bank  of Chicago.  The Midwest Economy Index (MEI) decreased to +0.03 in July from +0.36 in June,
and approached its historical trend for the first time in 17 months. However,
Midwest growth continued to outperform its historical deviation with respect to
national growth, even as the relative MEI decreased to +0.85 in July from +1.05 in
the previous month.  Manufacturing’s contribution to the MEI decreased to +0.42 in July from +0.58
in June.  Illinois ,  Iowa , Michigan, and Wisconsin all saw a decrease in the pace of
manufacturing activity in July, while the pace of July’s manufacturing activity was
steady in  Indiana . Manufacturing’s contribution to the relative MEI also decreased,
edging lower to +0.90 in July from +0.96 in the previous month.  The construction and mining sector’s contribution to the MEI ticked up to -0.14
in July from -0.15 in June. The pace of construction and mining activity in July
increased only in  Michigan . Construction and mining’s contribution to the relative
MEI improved in July, moving up to +0.03 from - 0.03 in June.  The service sector contributed -0.17 to the MEI in July, down from -0.08 in
June. The pace of service sector activity in Iowa was steady in July, while the pace
in the other Seventh District states was down. The service sector’s contribution to
the relative MEI decreased, declining to    -0.07 in July from +0.04 in the previous
month.  The contribution from  consumer spending  to the MEI was -0.08 in July, down from
+0.01 in June. Consumer spending indicators for Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, and
 Wisconsin  decreased in July, while Iowa’s held steady. Consumer spending’s
contribution to the relative MEI decreased to -0.01 in July from +0.07 in June.  Notes: Both the MEI and the CFNAI-MA3 have been standardized to have a zero mean and
are expressed in standard deviation units. MEI values greater than zero indicate
growth in Midwest economic activity above its historical trend, and CFNAI-MA3 values
greater than zero indicate growth in national economic activity above its historical
trend; negative values indicate the opposite. Shading indicates official periods of
recession as identified by the National Bureau of Economic Research.  Notes: Both the relative MEI and the CFNAI-MA3 have been standardized to have a zero
mean and are expressed in standard deviation units. The relative MEI is constructed
from the standardized residuals from linear regressions of each of the 134 MEI
indicators on the CFNAI-MA3. Relative MEI values greater than zero indicate that
growth in Midwest economic activity is higher on average than would typically be
suggested based on the CFNAI-MA3; negative values indicate the opposite. Shading
indicates official periods of recession as identified by the  National Bureau of
Economic Research .  2011 MEI Release Dates
