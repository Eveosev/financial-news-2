A Nigerian court in the northern
city of Kano today ordered the release of Sheikh Rabiu
Abdulkadir, a Muslim cleric, quashing charges linking him to
violent attacks by militants, according to court proceedings.  Judge Usman Na’Abba of the Kano High Court ruled that the
prosecution failed to provide evidence proving that Abdulkadir
was an accomplice in incidences, including bombings, by a
militant sect known as Boko Haram, which draws inspiration from
 Afghanistan ’s Taliban movement.  Abdulkadir is a leader of the Jammatul Wa’azi Wal’irshad
religious group. He was arrested on Aug. 1, amid allegations he
was linked to Boko Haram. The sect has been blamed by officials
for a spate of gun attacks and bombings targeting government
institutions and security personnel. He denied the claims.  Africa ’s top oil producer is almost evenly divided between
a mainly Muslim north and a predominantly Christian south. More
than 14,000 people died in ethnic and religious clashes between
1999 and 2009 in Nigeria, according to the Brussels-based
 International Crisis Group .  A suicide car-bomber crashed into the United Nations
compound in the Nigerian capital, Abuja, on Aug. 26, killing 23
people and injuring 71, the agency said. The BBC and local
newspapers reported Boko Haram as claiming responsibility for
the attack.  To contact the reporter on this story:
