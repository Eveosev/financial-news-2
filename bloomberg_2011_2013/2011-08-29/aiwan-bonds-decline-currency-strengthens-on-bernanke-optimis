Taiwan ’s government bonds dropped,
pushing benchmark five-year yields to the highest in a week, and
the currency strengthened after Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S.
Bernanke  said the  U.S. economy  is slowly recovering.  The Taiwan dollar snapped a three-day decline and the Taiex
Index of shares rallied after Bernanke said in  Jackson Hole ,
Wyoming, this weekend he is “more optimistic” about the long-
term prospects of the U.S. economy. The island’s dollar has
weakened 0.4 percent this month, set for the biggest retreat
since February, on speculation a slowing global economic
recovery will hurt demand for Taiwan’s exports.  “Stocks are rallying today so investors aren’t very
interested in buying bonds,” said Ivy Leung, a Taipei-based
fixed-income trader at Polaris Securities Co. “Traders are
still concerned about the global economic recovery. Looking
forward, yields might continue to fall.”  The yield on the 2 percent notes due July 2016, the most-
traded  government securities , rose one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 1.037 percent as of 9:35 a.m. local time,
prices from Gretai Securities Market show. The rate dropped to
0.974 percent on Aug. 19, the lowest for benchmark five-year
debt since December.  Taiwan’s dollar strengthened 0.1 percent to NT$29.019
against its U.S. counterpart, according to Taipei Forex Inc. The
currency gained 0.1 percent last week.  The overnight money-market rate, which measures interbank
funding availability, was little changed at 0.387 percent,
according to a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan Interbank
Money Center.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
