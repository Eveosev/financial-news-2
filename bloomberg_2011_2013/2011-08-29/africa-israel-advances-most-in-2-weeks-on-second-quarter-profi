Africa-Israel Investments Ltd. (AFIL) 
climbed the most in two weeks after Lev Leviev’s holding company
reported second-quarter net income of 32 million shekels ($8.9
million) as revenue increased 37 percent.  The shares jumped 4.9 percent, the most since Aug. 14, to
14.43 shekels at 12:11 p.m. in Tel Aviv. The stock has dropped
23 percent over the past year.  Net income declined from 1.21 billion shekels a year
earlier, the Yehud, Israel-based company said today in an e-
mailed statement. Revenue climbed to 1.69 billion shekels in the
quarter from 1.23 billion shekels.  The results aren’t directly comparable because the company
reached a settlement with bondholders last year, said Noam Pincu, an analyst at Psagot Investment House Ltd. in  Tel Aviv .
Africa-Israel exchanged about 7.5 billion shekels of fixed-
income securities for new bonds, cash and equity in May 2010
after the value of its real-estate portfolio tumbled amid the
global credit crisis.  “As long as Africa-Israel has a profit after the problems
it had in the past it’s good,” Pincu said by telephone.
“Profit at Africa-Israel like many holding companies,
especially in real estate, is very volatile.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
