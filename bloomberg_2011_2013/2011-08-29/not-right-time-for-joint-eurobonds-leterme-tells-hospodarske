Belgium â€™s Prime Minister  Yves Leterme  said now is not the right time to sell joint Eurobonds
because yields on bonds sold by euro-area countries differ,
 Hospodarske Noviny  reported.  Leterme added in an interview that it would be too
expensive for some member countries if the monetary union began
joint debt issuance, the newspaper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
