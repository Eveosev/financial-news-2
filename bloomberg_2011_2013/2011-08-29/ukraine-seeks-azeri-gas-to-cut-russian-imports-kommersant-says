Ukraine is seeking to buy natural
gas from  Azerbaijan  and boost its own output to cut Russian fuel
imports in five years,  Kommersant-Ukraine  reported, citing an
unidentified official from the Energy and Coal Ministry.  The country may buy 5 billion cubic meters of natural gas a
year from Azerbaijan that would be shipped via a planned
liquefied natural gas terminal, the newspaper said.  Gas produced on the sea shelf will help reduce imports by 7
billion cubic meters a year, according to Kommersant. Shale gas
will help reduce imports by 5 billion cubic meters and coal-bed
methane by 4 billion cubic meters, the newspaper said.  The power and steel industries will cut gas imports by 8
billion cubic meters a year by switching to coal, according to
Kommersant.  Ukraine plans to cut Russian gas imports to 12 billion
cubic meters a year by 2017, the newspaper reported on Aug. 23.
That compares with about 40 billion cubic meters this year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
