Mauritius Union Assurance Ltd., the
country’s largest insurer by market value, expects its insurance
premiums to increase as much as 27 percent this year, Chief
Executive Officer Kris Lutchmenarraidoo said.  “We aim to collect 1.7 billion rupees ($61 million) of
premiums from our general insurance activities this year,”
Lutchmenarraidoo said in an interview in  Port Louis , the
capital, yesterday. “We are on target.”  Gross premiums for the six months through June rose 35
percent to 806 million rupees compared with a year earlier,
while net income declined to 90.2 million rupees, Mauritius
Union said on Aug. 4. General insurance includes motor vehicles,
health and travel policies, according to the company.  The increase in premiums “will be achieved through a wider
client base, new products and rigorous management,”
Lutchmenarraidoo said.  Mauritius Union Assurance, which estimates it has a 26
percent market share of the country’s general insurance
industry, is diversifying its products, the company said in an
analyst presentation yesterday.  The stock has declined 15 percent this year to 124 rupees
compared with a 1 percent drop in the Port Louis-based stock
exchange’s 38-member Semdex index. It was unchanged as of 12:49
p.m. local time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
