A storm system off West Africa
formed into a tropical depression today, the U.S. National
Hurricane Center said in an advisory.  The storm about 395 miles (635 kilometers) south-southwest
of the Cape Verde Islands has 35 mph winds and is moving
westward at about 15 miles per hour, the center said this
morning on its website. Itâ€™s forecast to strengthen and could
become a named tropical storm later today, the NHC said.  Tropical Storm Jose with 40 mph winds about 340 miles north
of  Bermuda  will probably bring squalls to the island as it moves
northward at 23 mph over cooler waters and weakens later today,
the center said in a separate report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
