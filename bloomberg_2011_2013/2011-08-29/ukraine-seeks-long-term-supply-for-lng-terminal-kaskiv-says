Ukraine is seeking a supplier this
year to provide natural gas for a liquefied natural gas terminal
on the  Black Sea , said Vladyslav Kaskiv, head of Ukraine’s
 National Projects  group.  “Ukraine is prepared to guarantee a long-term contract for
gas purchase,” Kaskiv told reporters today in Kiev. The
contract may be for 10 to 15 years, he said, adding that talks
are being held with Azerbaijan. A winner will be announced by
Sept. 20 in a tender to conduct a technical feasibility study of
the project, Kaskiv said.  -- Editors:  John Buckley , Torrey Clark  To contact the reporter on this story:
