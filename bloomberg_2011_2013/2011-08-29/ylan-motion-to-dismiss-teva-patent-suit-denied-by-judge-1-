Mylan Inc.’s motion to dismiss a
patent lawsuit by  Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (TEVA)  over the
multiple-sclerosis drug Copaxone was dismissed by a federal
judge.  U.S. District Judge Barbara Jones dismissed Mylan’s claim
that Teva’s patent for the drug was invalid, according to a
filing today in federal court. A trial on the patent
infringement case in  Manhattan  is set to begin Sept. 7.  Teva, which licensed patents from Yeda Research and
Development Co. for Copaxone, sued  Novartis AG (NOVN) ’s Sandoz in 2008
and Mylan in 2009 after they separately tried to win approvals
from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to market generic
versions of the drug before its patents expired in 2014.  Jones consolidated the cases. An earlier motion by Sandoz
to dismiss the patent claim as invalid was also rejected.  The Sandoz case is Teva Phamaceutical Industries Ltd. v.
Sandoz Inc., 08-7611, U.S. District Court, Southern District of
 New York  (Manhattan). The Mylan case is Teva Pharmaceuticals
Industries Ltd. v. Mylan Inc., 09-8824, U.S. District Court,
Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
