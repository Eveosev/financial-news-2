Units of Telemar Participacoes SA
rose after their boards approved a plan to merge into a single
entity that will be  Brazil ’s largest fixed-line telephone
service provider.  Brasil Telecom SA (BRTO4)  gained 5.3 percent to 11.66 reais at 2:25
p.m. New York time, the most since Aug. 9.  Tele Norte Leste
Participacoes SA (TNLP3)  rose 3.6 percent to 19.97 reais.  Telemar Norte
Leste SA (TMAR5)  increased 2.8 percent to 44.61 reais.  Parent company Telemar Participacoes said May 24 it plans
to merge the units into one entity that will trade under the
name Oi SA. The companies’ boards approved the plan on Aug. 26,
according to separate regulatory filings today from each of the
units.  “It’s positive news,” Rosangela Ribeiro, an analyst at
SLW Corretora brokerage, said in a telephone interview from Sao
Paulo. “It shows the company is one step closer to the merger.
Having only one company trading in the exchange will make things
easier to everyone, from investors to the company itself.”  Shareholders still need to approve the merger, according to
the filings released today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
