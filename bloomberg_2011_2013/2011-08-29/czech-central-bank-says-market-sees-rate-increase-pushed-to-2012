Czech inflation will be slower in
one year than the central bank forecasts and policy makers are
unlikely to raise interest rates until 2012, a financial markets
survey conducted by the Ceska Narodni Banka showed.  Policy makers in  Prague  have expressed differing views on
inflation risks as they debate when to start raising the
benchmark  interest rate  from a record low. Five out of seven
board members voted to leave the two-week repurchase rate at
0.75 percent on Aug. 4, keeping borrowing costs at half the
 European Central Bank ’s main rate. Two Czech policy makers
wanted a quarter-point increase.  “Analysts expect an increase in the main interest rates in
November at the earliest, when the central bank will debate new
forecasts, but a higher probability is placed on the first
quarter of next year,” the bank said in its monthly survey of
market forecasts published on its website today. The market’s
inflation expectations have “an important place” in its
inflation-targeting policy regime, it said.  The August survey, consisting of 10 institutions, showed an
average forecast for an inflation rate of 2.8 percent in 12
months, compared with the central bank’s expectation of price
growth at 3.1 percent in the third quarter of next year. The
economy will expand 2.2 percent in 2012, matching the central
bank’s estimate, according to the average of the survey.  The inflation rate dropped to 1.7 percent in July from 1.8
percent in the previous month. Price growth is expected to
accelerate above the central bank’s 2 percent target next year
because of a planned increase in the value-added  tax rate .  To contact the reporter on this story:
