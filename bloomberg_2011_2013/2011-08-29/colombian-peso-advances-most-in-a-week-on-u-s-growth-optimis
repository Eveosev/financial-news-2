Colombia ’s peso rose the most in
more than a week as optimism the  U.S. economy  will continue to
expand led to boosted appetite for higher-yielding, emerging-
market assets.  The peso gained the most on a closing basis since Aug. 17,
rising 0.4 percent to 1,786.91 per dollar at 2:09 p.m. New York
time, from 1,794.50 on Aug. 26. The peso is up 7.3 percent in
the past six months, the best performance among 25 emerging-
market currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  Data today showed U.S. consumer spending climbed more than
forecast in July as Americans dipped into savings to buy cars
and cool their homes, a sign that the world’s biggest economy is
holding up. Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said on
Aug. 26 in  Jackson Hole ,  Wyoming , that the U.S. economy isn’t
deteriorating enough to warrant any immediate additional
stimulus.  “External markets are positive today as better-than-
expected consumer spending data sends a positive signal
regarding U.S. demand in the third quarter,” said Patricia Gonzalez, an analyst at Banco de Bogota SA, Colombia’s second-
biggest bank. “Today’s reduced risk aversion is helping gains
in U.S. stocks as well as Latin American currencies including
the Colombian peso.”  The yield on Colombia’s 10 percent bonds due in July 2024
fell three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 7.39
percent. The price rose 0.288 centavo to 121.236 centavos per
peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
