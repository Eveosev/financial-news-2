Euro-area governments will need to
transfer additional sovereign functions to the European Union if
they want to establish a European economic government,  Germany ’s
ZDF television reported, citing an interview with Luxembourg
Prime Minister  Jean-Claude Juncker .  Daily cooperation among finance ministers is needed if
euro-zone governments don’t want to lag behind developments in
financial markets, Juncker, who chairs euro-area finance
meetings, was cited as saying.  Regional leaders won’t be able to sidestep the issue of
joint euro-area bonds indefinitely, he said, according to the
report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
