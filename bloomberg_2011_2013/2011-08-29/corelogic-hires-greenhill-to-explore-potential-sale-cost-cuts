CoreLogic Inc. (CLGX) , the Santa Ana,
California-based seller of property and credit data, hired
Greenhill & Co. to help consider options including a sale.  The “challenging economic environment and current market
conditions” prompted CoreLogic to consider the moves, the firm
said in a statement today. The company also may pursue cost
cuts, changes in  capital structure , repurchases of debt or stock
and selling businesses, CoreLogic said.  CoreLogic, led by Chief Executive Officer Anand Nallathambi, plunged 39 percent since Aug. 4, when it said that
second-half profit would be lower than previously estimated. The
shares advanced 4.4 percent to $8.79 today in New York, giving
the company a market capitalization of $935.4 million.  “As a long-standing shareholder, we are convinced that the
best possible way to serve the interests of all shareholders is
through a sale of the company,” Jonathon Jacobson, CEO of
Boston-based hedge-fund manager Highfields Capital Management
LP, said in a separate statement.  Highfields is CoreLogic’s biggest shareholder with a 7.7
percent stake as of June 30, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  CoreLogic was spun off from title insurer  First American
Financial Corp. (FAF)  in 2010. Competitors include  Lender Processing
Services Inc. (LPS) ,  Equifax Inc. (EFX)  and  Experian Plc (EXPN) , according to a
regulatory filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
