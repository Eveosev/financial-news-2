Senegal  is planning to start a per-
minute tax of 49.20  CFA francs  ($0.11) on calls made from
outside the country to mobile phones in the West African nation,
Seneweb.com  reported , citing a decree from President Abdoulaye Wade.  International calls to fixed lines would incur a 75.45 CFA-
franc tariff, the news website reported, without saying how it
obtained the document. The funds would be used to construct
public housing and internet cafes, according to the decree.  To contact the reporter on this story:
