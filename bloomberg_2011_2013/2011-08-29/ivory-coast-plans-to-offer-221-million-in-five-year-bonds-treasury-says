Ivory Coast , the world’s biggest
cocoa producer, began offering today 100 billion CFA francs
($220 million) in five-year bonds with a yield of 6.5 percent,
according to the country’s Treasury.  The debt will be offered until Sept. 12, according to the
statement from the Abidjan-based Treasury that was published in
newspapers including le Patriote. It didn’t say what the funds
raised in the sale will be used for.  The West African nation is rebuilding its economy after
almost five months of a violent political crisis that followed a
disputed November presidential election.  Damage to the economy caused by the impasse forced Ivory
Coast to ask for a reassessment of $2.3 billion of Eurobonds,
Finance Minister Charles Koffi Diby said July 12. The government
missed coupon payments on the bonds, due 2032, in January and
June.  The country approved a 3.05 trillion CFA-franc budget for
this year on June 23 on the assumption that the economy will
shrink 6.3 percent. On Aug. 5, Diby said Ivory Coast would make
an immediate payment of 144 billion  CFA francs  to reduce arrears
on its internal debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
