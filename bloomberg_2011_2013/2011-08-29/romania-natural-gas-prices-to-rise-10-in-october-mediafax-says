Romanian prices of natural gas for
industrial consumers such as chemical and steel plants will rise
10 percent in October,  Mediafax  reported, citing unidentified
government officials.  Prices of the commodity will probably rise for the second
time this year after a 10 percent increase in July, according to
the news service. The Romanian government approved in June a
measure to keep natural gas prices for households unchanged from
July until March next year, and to raise tariffs for industrial
consumers by 30 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
