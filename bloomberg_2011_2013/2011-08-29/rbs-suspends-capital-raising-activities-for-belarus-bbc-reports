Royal Bank of Scotland Plc,
Britain’s biggest government-owned lender, said it “has ceased
capital-raising on behalf of  Belarus ,” the British Broadcasting
Corp. reported, citing an RBS statement.  “Given sanctions, the deteriorating political situation in
Belarus and the fact that it has reneged on key elements of the
IMF program,” the bank has “no plans to change that position
until these issues have been resolved” the statement said,
according to the BBC.  To contact the reporter on this story:
