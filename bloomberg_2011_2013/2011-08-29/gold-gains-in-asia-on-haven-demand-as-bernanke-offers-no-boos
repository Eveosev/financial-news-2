Gold rose in New York on speculation
that the  Federal Reserve  will ease monetary policy further to
stimulate the economy, boosting the appeal of the precious metal
as an alternative asset.  “We need to do more,” Chicago Fed President  Charles Evans 
said today in a CNBC interview. Gold has rallied 12 percent this
month, touching a record $1,917.90 an ounce on Aug. 23. Prices
extended gains in electronic trading today after a statement
showed some Fed policy makers favored more aggressive action to
stimulate the economy during their meeting on Aug. 9.  “The Fed is telling us they are willing to provide more
support for the economy,”  Frank Lesh , a trader at FuturePath
Trading in Chicago said in a telephone interview. “More free
money, the fear of a slowing economy, and a weaker dollar are
driving more people into gold.”  Gold futures for December delivery gained $38.20, or 2.1
percent, to settle at $1,829.80 at 2:01 p.m. on the Comex in  New
York .  Prices gained as much as 2.7 percent in electronic trading
after the Fed released minutes of its meeting. A few members of
the rate-setting committee “felt that recent economic
developments justified a more substantial move” beyond the
central bank’s Aug. 9 pledge to keep borrowing costs at a record
low until mid-2013.  11 Years  Bullion is in the 11th year of a bull market, the longest
winning streak since at least 1920 in  London , as investors seek
to diversify away from equities and some currencies. The metal
is up 29 percent this year, outperforming global stocks,
commodities and Treasuries.  The Fed has kept borrowing costs at a record low since
December 2008 to stimulate the economy. Residential real-estate
prices fell 4.5 percent in the 12 months through June, according
to the S&P/Case-Shiller index of property values released today.  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  refrained from announcing
additional stimulus last week at a meeting of central bankers in
 Jackson Hole , Wyoming.  Gold is not a ‘‘safe harbor,’’  Dennis Gartman , an economist
and the editor of the Suffolk, Virginia-based Gartman Letter,
said in a report to clients.  ‘‘This is hardly a place for frightened capital to flee
to,’’ Gartman wrote. ‘‘This is a place where only risk capital
should be deployed.’’  Prices had a trading range of more than $300 this month.
The metal’s 10-day historical volatility is at 41 percent, the
highest since March 2009.  Silver futures for December delivery rose 86.3 cents, or
2.1 percent, to $41.464 an ounce on the Comex.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , platinum futures for
October delivery advanced $28.10, or 1.5 percent, to $1,853.10
an ounce, while palladium futures for December delivery gained
$23.55, or 3.1 percent, to $779.30 an ounce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
