Bidvest Group Ltd. (BVT) , an industrial
holding company with interests from grain-handling to car
retailing, said fiscal full-year profit rose 8.6 percent,
falling short of analyst estimates.  Earnings a share before one-time items increased to 11.54
rand a share from 10.63 rand, Johannesburg-based Bidvest said in
a statement today. That missed the median estimate of eight
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg for adjusted earnings per share
of 11.75 rand. Sales climbed 8 percent to 118.5 billion rand
($16.6 billion) beating the 115.6 billion-rand median estimate.  Bidvest’s food service division will benefit in fiscal 2012
from “buoyant” demand in the Asia Pacific region and
particularly  China  for delivered wholesale food products, the
company said. European markets in which Bidvest operates are
also “slowly improving,” it said.  The food business, which was the subject of unsolicited
buy-out offers, is the group’s largest revenue earner,
accounting for 59.6 billion rand of its sales. The unit will
grow on its own and expand with acquisitions in  Egypt , the
Baltic region and in  Chile , Bidvest said on Aug. 18.  A reorganization of Bidvest’s South African business means
the unit is better positioned for the “pursuit of new
opportunities that will take these businesses to the next level
of growth,” Bidvest said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
