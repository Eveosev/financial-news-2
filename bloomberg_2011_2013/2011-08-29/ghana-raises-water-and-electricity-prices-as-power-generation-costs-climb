Ghana  raised tariffs for water and
electricity as higher crude prices and reduced supplies of
natural gas from Nigeria pushed up productions costs, according
to the Public Utilities Regulatory Commission.  The price for water was increased by 6.7 percent and for
electricity by 7 percent for customers who use more than 50
kilowatt hours a month, Samuel Sarpong, commissioner of the
Accra-based PURC, told reporters today. The changes take effect
Sept. 1.  The increases could affect Ghana’s producer-price inflation
rate as companies seek to remain competitive by absorbing the
costs, instead of raising prices, said Sampson Akligoh, an
economist with Databank Financial Services Ltd., in Accra.  “It will be seen in reduced profits for some” companies he
said by phone today. Factory-gate prices accelerated 14 percent
in July, the first rate increase since April, as manufacturing
and mining costs climbed.  Ghana wants  Nigeria  to provide a more reliable rate of
natural gas through a regional pipeline, said Stephen Adu,
executive secretary of the PURC.  “If Nigeria will consistently supply the 123 million
standard cubic feet of natural gas per day as promised, tariffs
could be reduced by the next review,” he said in an interview.
About 40 percent of Ghana’s power comes from thermal generation
plants, which are fueled by light crude and natural gas.  Higher electricity prices also raise the treatment and
operating costs of Ghana’s water utility, said Sarpong. The next
review with be held Nov. 30, he said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
