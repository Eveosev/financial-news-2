South Korean Finance Minister Bahk
Jae Wan indicated that the government may cut its growth
forecast for this year amid signs of a global slowdown.   “I see downside risks growing and so we may have to revise
our growth forecast,” Bahk told reporters after a speech at a
local forum in  Seoul  today. “We maintain our 4.5 percent
estimate for now.” He cited the threat from weaker expansions
in major economies.   Turbulence in financial markets this month has highlighted
the risk of another global slump as Europe grapples to contain a
sovereign-debt crisis and U.S. growth falters. International
Monetary Fund Managing Director  Christine Lagarde  told a forum
of central bankers in  Jackson Hole , Wyoming, that the world
economy is in a “dangerous new phase.”  In an intervew in Jackson Hole on Aug. 26, Bank of Korea
Governor Kim Choong Soo said that  South Korea  can achieve an
“original forecast” of 4.3 percent growth “unless something
dramatic happens.” He said that the central bank will continue
to “normalize”  interest rates  so long as the world doesn’t
face a so called double-dip or recession.  South Korea had a $4.94 billion current-account surplus in
July, the biggest in nine months, a goverment report showed
today. The won advanced 0.3 percent to 1,078.18 per dollar as of
9:22 a.m. in Seoul, after gaining 0.5 percent on Aug. 26,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Yoon Yeo Sam, a fixed-income analyst at Daewoo Securities
Co. in Seoul, said that the surplus may narrow “in coming
months” as exports slow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
