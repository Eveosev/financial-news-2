Peyton Manning  will participate in
practice on a limited basis after the  Indianapolis Colts 
activated the four-time National Football League most-valuable
player from the physically unable to perform list.  Manning’s practice “will be scripted and on a controlled
basis,” the Colts said in a statement. The Super Bowl-winning
quarterback, 35, has started 227 consecutive games since joining
the NFL in 1998. Brett Favre holds the league record for
consecutive starts at the position with 321.  Manning is attempting to recover from May neck surgery in
time for the team’s Sept. 11 season opener against the Houston
Texans.  Manning’s Colts beat the Chicago Bears for the NFL title
after the 2006 season.  To contact the reporter on this story:
