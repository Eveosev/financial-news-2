Hartford Financial Services Group
Inc. (HIG)  led U.S. property insurers higher after loss estimates for
Hurricane Irene were reduced as the storm weakened en route to
 New York .  Hartford, based in the Connecticut city of the same name,
rose 74 cents, or 4.3 percent, too $17.93 at 9:37 a.m. in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading. Travelers Cos. climbed
3.4 percent to $49.96. Allstate, the largest publicly traded
U.S. home and auto insurer, advanced 3.8 percent to $25.39 and
 Chubb Corp. (CB)  increased 3.8 percent to $61.62.  Irene’s estimated cost to insurers fell to about $2.6
billion in the U.S. as the Hurricane was downgraded to a
tropical storm as it approached New York, according to Kinetic
Analysis Corp., a firm that predicts the effects of disasters.
That compares with a projection last week from the  Silver
Spring , Maryland-based company of as much as $14 billion when
Irene was forecast to make landfall in New York as a Category 2
hurricane. Total economic losses, including those that aren’t
insured, may be about $7 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
