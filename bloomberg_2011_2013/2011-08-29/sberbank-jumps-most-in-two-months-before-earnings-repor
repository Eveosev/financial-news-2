OAO Sberbank,  Russia ’s largest bank,
advanced by its most in 10 months before the company reports
second-quarter earnings tomorrow.  The shares climbed 5.2 percent, the biggest gain since Oct.
21, to 81.61 rubles by the 6:45 p.m. close in Moscow. The stock
has tumbled 20 percent in August, headed for the worst month
since January 2009. The benchmark Micex Index has lost 11
percent in the period.  Net income probably jumped fourfold in the second quarter
to 88.2 billion rubles ($3.1 billion) from 20.7 billion rubles a
year earlier, according to 10 estimates in a Bloomberg survey of
analysts. Sberbank reported profit doubled in the first quarter
to 86.8 billion rubles, beating forecasts.  “The results should underscore the bank’s solid
fundamentals and support our upbeat view,” analysts led by
Leonid Slipchenko at UralSib wrote in a report today. UralSib,
which has a “buy” recommendation on the stock, forecast profit
of 87.2 billion rubles.  Improvement in Sberbank’s core business and release of
reserves probably supported earnings growth in the quarter,
analysts led by Rustam Botashev at UniCredit said in a report
today. “We expect strong net income to help Sberbank” rebound
from its losses this month, they wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
