Bidvest Group Ltd. (BVT)  Finance Director
David Cleasby said his company offered to buy 50 million shares
in  Capespan Group Ltd. , South Africa’s biggest fruit exporter,
at 2.40 rand apiece, topping a bid by  Zeder Investments Ltd. (ZED)   Bidvest’s proposal to buy 15 percent of Capespan, submitted
via the logistics company’s website, is still tentative at this
point and “time will tell if we put in a formal offer,”
Cleasby said in a mobile-phone interview today. “We have to do
our homework first and we’re in the process of doing some work
on Capespan.”  Zeder, an  investment company  that specializes in
agricultural assets, is already Cape Town-based Capespan’s
biggest shareholder. It offered 2.25 rand a share for the stock
it doesn’t already own on June 14. Bidvest’s proposal values the
fruit exporter at 795 million rand ($112 million), 50 million
rand more than Zeder’s plan.  Bidvest Chief Executive Officer Brian Joffe said today that
his company, whose businesses include cosmetics manufacturing,
car retailing and grain handling, is in the process of
concluding “one or two” acquisitions in  South Africa . He
didn’t specify any transactions.  Zeder’s Growing Stake  Zeder, which is based in Stellenbosch, South Africa, said
on Aug. 24 that it held 27.7 percent of Capespan, an increase
from the 19.7 percent reported in the fruit exporter’s 2010
 annual report , and had acceptances enabling it to raise the
stake to almost 40 percent.  An unlisted company whose shares trade over the counter,
Capespan has operations in Asia,  Europe  and the Americas and
generated 2.6 billion rand in revenue in 2010. In addition to
fruit exports and logistics businesses, Capespan also operates
port terminals.  Bidvest rose as much as 6.11 rand, or 4.3 percent, to
149.60 rand, the highest intraday price since July 6, and was up
3.8 percent as of 1:32 p.m. in Johannesburg trading. Zeder fell
0.4 percent to 2.39 rand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
