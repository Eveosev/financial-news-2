K.K. Mital, a  fund manager  at Globe
Capital Market Ltd., comments on the outlook for Indian stocks.  The benchmark Bombay Stock Exchange Sensitive Index jumped
3.1 percent to 16,341.11 at 1:53 p.m. in Mumbai, the steepest
gain in six months, after Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S.
Bernanke  said the  U.S. economy  is gradually recovering.  Mital spoke by telephone from  New Delhi .  On global growth outlook:  “The concern about global slowdown is not over. It is
diluting. Markets have corrected across the globe. A slowdown in
the U.S. is an issue and views are divergent. We can’t say
whether there’s a recession or not.”  On stimulus measures:  “If QE3 will happen is uncertain. If things deteriorate,
then financial packages may come up,” Mital said, refering to
Fed’s asset-purchase program known as quantitative easing. “We
will have to wait for Obama’s announcement on Sept. 5.”  On investment strategy:  “We’re still buying but at lower levels. We invest when
markets are down. The rupee is under pressure. It’s positive for
top software companies. Sectors sensitive to  interest rates  are
suffering. These are also the companies where there’s foreign
exposure.”  On inflation:  “There is moderation in demand, as per economic
indicators. The RBI stance is still hawkish as far as interest
rates are concerned. There could be a rate hike of 25 basis
points.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
