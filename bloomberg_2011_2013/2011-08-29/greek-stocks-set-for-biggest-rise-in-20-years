Greek stocks rallied, with the
benchmark ASE Index climbing the most in more than 21 years, as
 EFG Eurobank Ergasias SA (EUROB)  and Alpha Bank SA announced a merger.  Eurobank and Alpha Bank each jumped by the allowed daily
limit of 30 percent after saying they will combine and sell new
equity to strengthen their capital in an attempt to weather the
debt crisis. Larger rival  National Bank of Greece SA (ETE)  gained the
most on record while  Piraeus Bank SA (TPEIR)  had the steepest advance in
almost 18 years.  The ASE soared 14 percent to 1,006.59 at the 5 p.m. close
in  Athens , the best daily performance since April 1990. The
benchmark gauge has still slumped 81 percent since October 2007
and is the worst performer in 2011 among 24 developed-markets
indexes tracked by Bloomberg News as the global financial crisis
and  Greece ’s debt woes eroded the value of the country’s banking
assets. The 22-member Cyprus General Market Index surged a
record 18 percent today.  “Consolidation in the domestic sector makes economic sense
given the fragmentation of the market,” Deutsche Bank AG
analysts Dimitris Giannoulis and Carlos Berastain Gonzalez wrote
in a report to investors dated today. “We would expect the
market to react with enthusiasm following the recent pressure on
the sector but we maintain our cautious stance ahead of the
necessary re-capitalization of the new group.”  Bonds Plunge  Greek government bonds have plummeted, pushing the two-year
note yield as high as 46 percent, after the country was bailed
out twice by European Union partners as it struggled to service
its debt.  Alpha Bank rose 30 percent to 2.47 euros today and Eurobank
gained 29 percent to 2.24 euros. Futures on Alpha expiring Sept.
21 and giving the right to one share each rose 57 percent to
3.02 euros.  Alpha, the southern European country’s third-largest bank,
will acquire Eurobank, the second-biggest, to create the
nation’s biggest lender as the firms seek to ride out a
deepening recession and the country’s sovereign debt crisis.  The combined bank will strengthen capital by 3.9 billion
euros ($5.7 billion), including a 1.25 billion-euro rights
offer, a 500 million-euro convertible note to be taken up by
Qatari-backed Paramount Services Holding Ltd. and 2.1 billion
euros of internal measures, the two companies said today.  National Bank  National Bank, Greece’s largest lender, closed 29 percent
higher at 3.59 euros, the biggest gain since trading started in
1992, after earlier rising 30 percent. Piraeus Bank gained 29
percent to 72 cents, the steepest advance since December 1993.
 Marfin Investment Group SA (MIG) , southeast  Europe ’s biggest buyout
fund, surged 30 percent to 39 cents. Stocks may rise a maximum
of 30 percent in a day or the closest that a 1-euro cent move
allows, according to exchange rules.  Bank of Cyprus jumped 29 percent to 1.50 euros in Athens
and 20 percent to 1.38 euros in Nicosia. Marfin Popular Bank
Pcl, Cyprus’s second-biggest lender, gained 17 percent to 34
euro cents.  Today’s gains pared the Athens index’s loss this year to 29
percent. The measure closed at the lowest level since 1996 last
week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
