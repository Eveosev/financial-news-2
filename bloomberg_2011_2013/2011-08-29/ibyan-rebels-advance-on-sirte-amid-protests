While  Muammar Qaddafi  may still be
holed up somewhere in Libya, much of his family is now gone.  Some of Qaddafi’s immediate family fled to neighboring
 Algeria , while his youngest son, a military commander, was
reported yesterday to have been killed in battle.  Qaddafi’s wife, Safia, daughter Aisha and two sons,
Hannibal and Mohammad, with their wives and children, crossed
the border from Libya into Algeria early yesterday morning, the
Algeria Press Service reported, citing a statement by the
country’s foreign ministry.  The Libyan rebels want them sent back. Ahmed Jibril, an
aide to National Transitional Council Chairman Mustafa Abdel
Jalil, was quoted by the  Associated Press  as saying rebel
leadership will demand Algeria “hand them over to Libya to be
tried before Libyan courts.”  Khamis Qaddafi, the military commander, was killed in a
NATO air strike southeast of Tripoli,  Sky News  reported, citing
a man claiming to have been Khamis’s bodyguard. A rebel
official, speaking on the condition he not be named, said the
deaths of Khamis and of Qaddafi’s top security adviser, Abdullah
al-Senussi, hadn’t been fully confirmed.  Members of the Khamis Brigade, the Qaddafi son’s military
force, allegedly executed detainees in a now burned-down
warehouse near Tripoli on Aug. 23,  Human Rights Watch  said in a
report on its website yesterday. An investigator from the group
counted charred remains of 45 detainees and was told by a
survivor that the building, used as a prison, held 153 people,
mostly civilians, the New York-based group said.  Hunted Man  The rebels have been trying to find Muammar Qaddafi and his
closest aides including son Saif al-Islam, consolidate their
gains and bring stability to the North African nation since
entering Tripoli last week.  The group expects to announce a new interim government, led
by current prime minister Mahmoud Jibril, in the first week of
September, NTC member Fathi Baja said by telephone yesterday.  U.S. Secretary of State  Hillary Clinton  will travel to
Paris this week for a Sept. 1 meeting of the so-called Libya
Contact Group, State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland
announced yesterday. Clinton and her foreign counterparts will
“further coordinate our financial and political support” for
the rebel council, Nuland said at a press briefing.  ‘First Priority’  Nuland played down the option of holding a donors’
conference to raise money for the new Libyan government, saying
“the first priority” for the U.S. is to unfreeze Libya’s
assets and revive the country’s oil sector.  “Let’s start with getting their money back to them,” she
said.  As anti-Qaddafi forces waited for the  North Atlantic Treaty
Organization  to bomb Scud missile sites so they can move toward
Sirte, about 500 protesters in the rebel-held city of Misrata
this week chanted the “blood of the martyrs” would be betrayed
by the expected appointment of former army general Albarrani
Shkal as head of security in the capital, Tripoli.  Sirte is a haven for Qaddafi loyalists, according to the
rebel command and NATO. Qaddafi’s chief spokesman, Moussa
Ibrahim, said Aug. 27 that Qaddafi remains in Libya and wants to
negotiate with the rebels to form a transitional government, an
offer that opposition leaders have rejected.  According to Baja, Qaddafi loyalists in Sirte have two
options: “To speed up the negotiations process and accept the
liberation of Sirte, or to face the military solution.” Salim
Miftah, one of the rebel commanders, told  Al Jazeera  the rebels
need about 10 days to capture Sirte if talks fail.  Fight for Sirte  Rebel units pushed toward Sirte from east and west along
the coastal highway on Aug. 28, Commander Ali Ahmed of the rebel
Sidra Brigade said in an interview.  “The people of Sirte will not be happy losing their
patronage and corruption networks to a new group who will
develop their own,” said  Paul Sullivan , a North Africa expert
and professor at the Washington-based National Defense
University. “The rebels need to bring the people of Sirte to
their side and this seems near-impossible.”  NATO targeted 20 surface-to-air missile canisters and two
surface-to-air missile systems in Sirte overnight, as well as
five multiple-rocket launchers in Ras Lanuf, home to one of
Libya’s biggest refineries, NATO said in statement yesterday.  “Fierce clashes” have also erupted in Sabha, Baja said
yesterday. A group of tribal leaders from Bani Walid asked to
start talks with the rebels to “surrender and recognize the
revolutionaries and the revolution,” Baja added.  Pan Am Bomber  Abdel-Baset al-Megrahi, who was convicted of the 1988
Lockerbie bombing, was found lying in a comatose state and close
to death in his Tripoli home,  CNN  reported. The Libyan rebel
government won’t deport al-Megrahi, its justice minister said,
according to the AP. U.S. Senator  Charles Schumer , Democrat of
 New York , had encouraged the rebel council to hold al-Megrahi
fully accountable for the bombing of Pan Am flight 103, which
killed 270 people.  Al-Megrahi spent almost nine years in prison in  Scotland 
until he was released in 2009 for health reasons. The Scottish
municipality responsible for monitoring al-Megrahi said in a
statement yesterday that officials are in contact with his
family and there is “no evidence of a breach of his license
condition.”  ‘Behind Bars’  The U.S. State Department has asked the rebel council to
take “a hard look” at what should be done with al-Megrahi and
the terms under which he was allowed back into  Libya , Nuland
said yesterday.  “We believe he should still be behind bars,” she said.  With Tripoli under their control, the rebel leaders are
turning to domestic concerns including a water shortage and
spread of disease.  “This could turn into an unprecedented health epidemic,”
Christian Balslev-Olesen, head of the Unicef office in Libya,
said.  Amnesty International  said yesterday that key prison
records and other documentation -- vital for possible war crimes
trials -- are at risk of being lost as sites remain unsecured
and documents are destroyed or looted.  The conflict has all but halted oil exports from Libya,
which has the largest proven reserves of any African country.
Output dropped to 100,000 barrels a day in July, down from the
1.6 million barrels pumped before the uprising started.  Crude oil for October delivery rose $1.90 to $87.27 a
barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the highest
settlement since Aug. 17 on positive economic data. Prices have
fallen 4.5 percent this year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
