The  New York Giants  are offering
free parking to fans who attend tonight’s  National Football
League  preseason game against the Jets because of road closures
and mass transit slowdowns in the wake of Hurricane Irene.  Ticketholders who’ve already paid for parking can have a
refund or credit the cost to their season ticket accounts, the
team said in a statement. Those with permits can park in their
usual lots. Others will be handled on a first-come, first-served
basis.  Parking for Giants games at the $1.6 billion stadium, which
is shared with the Jets, cost an average of $25 last season,
team spokesman Pat Hanlon said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
