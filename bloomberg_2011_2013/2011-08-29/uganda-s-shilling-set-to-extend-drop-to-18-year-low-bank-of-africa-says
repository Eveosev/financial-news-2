Uganda’s shilling, the world’s
worst-performing currency in 2011, is set to extend its decline
to the lowest in 18 years by the end of the week against the
dollar as companies buy the currency to pay for imports,
according to Bank of Africa Uganda Ltd.  There is “substantial” demand for the greenback and
interbank borrowing rates climbed as high as 28 percent last
week, Ahmed Kalule, the head of  currency trading  at the lender,
said by phone from the capital, Kampala. “We are seeing orders
for the dollar coming from the energy and some from the
telecommunication sector,” he said.  The currency of  East Africa ’s third-biggest economy may
trade as low as 2,850 shillings by Sept. 2, he said. That would
be the weakest level since at least 1993, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The shilling was unchanged at 2,825 by 3
p.m. in Kampala.  The shilling has slumped 18 percent this year against the
dollar, making it the world’s worst-performing currency during
the period. A surge in food and fuel prices pushed inflation to
a more than 18-year high of 18.7 percent in July from 15.7
percent in June.  To contact the reporter on this story:
