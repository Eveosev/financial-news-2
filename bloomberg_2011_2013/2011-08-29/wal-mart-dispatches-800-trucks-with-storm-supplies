Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) , the worldâ€™s
largest retailer, deployed 800 trucks filled with storm-related
supplies to stores in the path of Irene, the storm that rumbled
up the Eastern Seaboard over the weekend.  Wal-Mart dispatched batteries, generators, canned goods and
other necessities that customers sought, Lorenzo Lopez, a
spokesman for the Bentonville, Arkansas-based merchant, said
today in a telephone interview.  Wal-Mart said it had no significant damage reports from any
of its 600 East Coast stores. As of noon New York time today, it
had reopened 263 of 298 stores closed during the storm, the
company said on its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
