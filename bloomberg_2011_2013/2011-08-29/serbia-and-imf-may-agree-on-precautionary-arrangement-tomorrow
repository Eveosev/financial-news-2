Serbia  and the International
Monetary Fund International will probably wrap up talks on a
precautionary arrangement tomorrow, the economy minister said.  An agreement is expected on the last day of scheduled talks
with a visiting IMF delegation in Belgrade, Nebojsa Ciric told
reporters today in Belgrade. The IMF delegation led by Albert
Jaeger arrived in Serbia on Aug. 18 to discuss the 18-month,
precautionary loan accord with Serbia worth around 1 billion
euros ($1.45 billion), or twice the country’s quota with the
multinational lender.  Serbia’s government has said it doesn’t want to draw on the
amount unless it is faced with a sudden fall in short-term
capital inflows, soaring commodity prices or a contagion from
the highly indebted countries of the euro area.  Central bank Governor Dejan Soskic has called for “prudent
and responsible moves” in the talks with the IMF in order to
secure the precautionary arrangement as a necessary shield
against a new wave of problems from the global economic crisis,
Privredni Pregled business newspaper reported.  Having a standing arrangement with the IMF can “control
risk for our country on the international markets” and help
Serbia keep its financial system stable, Soskic was quoted as
saying in the interview published  today .  To contact the reporter on this story:
