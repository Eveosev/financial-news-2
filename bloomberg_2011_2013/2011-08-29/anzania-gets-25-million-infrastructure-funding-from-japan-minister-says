Japan  has given  Tanzania  two grants
worth a combined 40 billion shillings ($24.7 million) for
infrastructure development in the East African nation, Finance
MinisterMustafa Mkulo said.  About 39 billion shillings will be used to build a bridge
between Tanzania and Rwanda while some of funding will also be
used to set up a joint border-post between the countries, Mkulo
told reporters today in Tanzania’s commercial capital, Dar es
Salaam. A further 769 million will be used to conduct a detailed
transport study of Dar es Salaam, he said.  “Construction of the Rusumo international bridge is
expected to be complete in a period of two years,” Mkulo said.
“The completion of the project will contribute substantially to
economic activities and reduce the transport burden between
Tanzania and Rwanda, and its surrounding areas.”  The current bridging connecting Tanzania to Rwanda was
built 40 years ago, and has an axle-load restriction of eight
tons, according to Hiroshi Nakagawa, the Japanese ambassador to
Tanzania.  To contact the reporter on this story:
