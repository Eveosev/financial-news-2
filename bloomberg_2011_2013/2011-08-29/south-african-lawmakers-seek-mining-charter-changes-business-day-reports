South African lawmakers are pushing
for amendments to the country’s Mining Charter to ensure that
black people are given an increased role in the industry,
Business Day said, citing Fred Gona, the chairman of
Parliament’s mining committee.  The Mining Charter has failed to transform the industry,
the Johannesburg-based newspaper cited Gona as saying. The
committee proposed that talks between the industry, labor
unions, the government and some communitities be held to discuss
the changes, it said.  Changes to the Mining Charter feed into the debate on the
nationalization of the country’s mines and may help ward off
more state intervention in the industry, Business Day said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
