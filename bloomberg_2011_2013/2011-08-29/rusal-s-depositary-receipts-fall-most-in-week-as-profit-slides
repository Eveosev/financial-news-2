OAO Rusal’s Russian depositary
receipts dropped in Moscow trading after the world’s biggest
aluminum producer reported a 70 percent decline in second-
quarter profit.  The RDRs lost as much as 2.9 percent before closing 1.4
percent lower at 311.22 rubles by 6:45 p.m. local time. A Rusal
spokeswoman, who declined to be named citing company policy,
said the decline in the depositary receipts was “a logical
correction” following an 8.4 percent gain on Aug. 26. Earlier
in  Hong Kong , the stock closed 3.6 percent higher at HK$8.29.  Net income was $339 million in the quarter, compared with
$1.12 billion a year earlier, the Moscow-based company said
today in a statement. That missed the $436 million median
estimate of six analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Adjusted net
income fell to $243 million from $352 million.  “The cost side remains a concern” for Rusal due to higher
 oil prices  and ruble appreciation, VTB Capital analyst Alexander Pukhaev wrote in a report today. “Rusal is likely to see some
pressure, resulting in weaker margins and more downside risk”
for full-year earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortization, or Ebitda, he said.  Adjusted Ebitda dropped 12 percent to $743 million, while
sales rose 11 percent to $3.33 billion. Ebitda as a percentage
of revenue dropped to 22.3 percent from 28.1 percent a year
earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
