More than 1,000 mayors of Italian
towns and cities protested in Milan against an austerity plan
that aims to slash 9.5 billion euros ($13.8 billion) of funding
to regional and local governments in the next two years.  Prime Minister  Silvio Berlusconi  and the leader of Italy’s
Northern League Party,  Umberto Bossi , who opposes the cuts to
local administrations, are scheduled to meet today to discuss
differences within the ruling coalition over the austerity plan.
The package must still be approved by the parliament and can be
amended before the vote.  About 1,500 local chiefs marched through Milan’s streets
toward the main cathedral, according to the national association
of local governments.  To contact the reporter on this story:
