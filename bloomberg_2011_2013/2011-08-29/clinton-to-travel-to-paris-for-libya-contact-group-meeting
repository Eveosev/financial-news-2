Secretary of State  Hillary Clinton 
will travel to Paris for a Sept. 1 meeting of the so-called
Libya Contact Group, the State Department announced today.  This will be the fifth such meeting that Clinton has
attended, said spokeswoman Victoria Nuland.  Members of the group will “further coordinate our
financial and political support for the TNC,” Nuland said,
referring to the rebel’s opposition Transition National Council.
“The days and weeks ahead will be critical for the Libyan
people.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
