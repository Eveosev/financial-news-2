Fed funds, the U.S. overnight inter-
bank lending rate, opened at 0.12, within the  Federal Reserve ’s
target of zero to 0.25 percent.  Fed funds closed at 0.09 percent on Aug. 26 after trading
from 0.04 percent to 0.14 percent and averaging 0.1 percent,
ICAP Plc, the world’s largest inter-dealer broker, said in an e-
mailed statement.  The central bank will acquire Treasuries maturing from
November 2018 to August 2021. The purchases are part of the
Fed’s policy to continue to reinvest the proceeds of maturing
assets on its balance sheet to prevent a tightening of monetary
policy.  The central bank plans to purchase between $2.75 and $3.5
billion securities today, according to the Federal Reserve Bank
of New York’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
