A benchmark gauge of U.S. corporate
credit risk fell by the most in two weeks after Federal Reserve
Chairman Ben. S. Bernanke said the world’s biggest economy is
gradually recovering.  The Markit CDX North America Investment Grade Index, which
investors use to hedge against losses on corporate debt or to
speculate on creditworthiness, decreased 6 basis points to a
mid-price of 120.3 basis points as of 4:55 p.m. in  New York ,
according to index administrator Markit Group Ltd.  The index soared to 126.8 basis points on Aug. 22 from 96.3
at the end of July, signaling deterioration in company
creditworthiness, as concern mounted that unemployment holding
above 9 percent would derail the economic recovery. Bernanke
said on Aug. 26 in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, that the U.S. economy
isn’t deteriorating enough to warrant any immediate additional
stimulus.  Credit swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails
to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A
basis point equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10
million of debt.  Credit-default swaps on  Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  dropped after
the largest U.S. lender agreed to sell about half its stake in
 China Construction Bank Corp. (939)  for a $3.3 billion gain as it
bolsters capital ahead of new international standards.  The cost to protect debt issued by the firm fell for a
fourth straight day, dropping 42.7 basis points to 290.4 basis
points, the biggest one-day decline since September 2009, as of
4:30 p.m. in New York, according to data provider CMA.  JPMorgan
Chase & Co. (JPM)  data show the contracts have fallen from a record
445 basis points on Aug. 23, after Warren Buffett’s Berkshire
Hathaway Inc. agreed on Aug. 25 to invest $5 billion in Bank of
America.  Credit-default swaps on  Citigroup Inc. (C)  and  Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. (GS)  also eased, declining to 208.3 basis points and 213.9
basis points respectively, CMA data show. Contracts on  MBIA Inc. (MBI) 
unit MBIA Insurance Corp. fell 2 percentage points to 46.5
percent upfront, That’s in addition to 5 percent a year, meaning
it would cost $4.65 million initially and $500,000 annually to
protect $10 million of MBIA Insurance Corp.’s debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
