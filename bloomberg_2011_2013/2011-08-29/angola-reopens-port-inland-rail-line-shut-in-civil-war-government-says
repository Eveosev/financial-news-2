Angola  will reopen the railway line
between the coastal town of Benguela and Huambo, about 340
kilometers (211 miles) inland, today, Desiderio Bambi, spokesman
for the Governor of Benguela, said by phone.  The line was shut down 27 years ago during the civil war in
the southern African nation that ended in 2002.  Angola, sub-Saharan Africaâ€™s second-biggest oil producer,
has announced plans to rebuild a 1,344-kilometer line linking
the copper mines in  Democratic Republic  of Congo and Zambia to
the Angolan port of Lobito, south of Luanda.  To contact the reporter on this story:
