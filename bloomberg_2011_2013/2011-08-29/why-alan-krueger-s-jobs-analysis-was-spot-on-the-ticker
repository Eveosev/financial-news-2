In a March 31 Bloomberg News  op-ed , Princeton University economist Alan Krueger predicted that the  unemployment rate , then at 8.9 percent, would keep falling. He was wrong -- it rose, and five months later it's still higher at 9.1 percent. President Barack Obama today nominated Krueger to lead the  Council of Economic Advisers , replacing  Austan Goolsbee . Did the president choose someone who doesn't understand labor markets? To the contrary. In the same op-ed, Krueger's analysis was spot on when he wrote about the employment-to-population ratio, which may offer a better window on job-market trends. As Krueger explained, the unemployment rate can be illusory because it only counts people who have actively looked for a job in the last month. He wrote: He was right: The employment-to-population ratio kept on slipping in subsequent months, reaching 58.2 percent in the June payrolls report and 58.1 percent in July. As my colleague Mark Whitehouse wrote in an Aug. 5 Ticker post, that's the lowest point since the 1983 recession. We'll see if it dips below that, to 58 or even lower, when the August employment figures are released on Friday. (Paula Dwyer is a member of the Bloomberg View editorial board.)
