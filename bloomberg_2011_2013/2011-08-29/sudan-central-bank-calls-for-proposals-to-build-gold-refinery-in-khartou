Sudan  called for tenders to build a
gold refinery in the capital, Khartoum, the African nationâ€™s
central bank said.  Interested parties should submit their proposals by Sept.
4, the central bank said in a statement published in the
Alintibaha newspaper today.  Sudan produced 36.8 metric tons of gold in the year through
May as it boosts mining to compensate for a loss of oil revenue
following the secession of Southern Sudan on July 9, Mines
Minister Abdel Baqi al-Jailani said in an interview on July 20.  The refinery is expected to start operating in January,
state-run Sudanese Media Center reported in July 18.  To contact the reporter on this story:
