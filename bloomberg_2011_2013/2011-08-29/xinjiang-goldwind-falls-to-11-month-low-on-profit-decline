Xinjiang Goldwind Science &
Technology Co.,  China ’s second-biggest wind-turbine maker, fell
to the lowest since its initial public offering in Hong Kong
trading after saying first-half profit declined 45 percent.  The shares dropped 12.8 percent, the biggest intra-period
decrease since Oct. 8, to HK$3.97, and traded at HK$4.02 as of
14:25 p.m. That compares with the benchmark Hang Seng Index’s
1.5 percent gain.  The company’s net income for the six months ended Jun. 30
was 424.6 million yuan ($66 million), compared with 772.8
million yuan a year earlier, Goldwind said in an Aug. 26 filing
to the Hong Kong stock exchange.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
