Canadian natural gas fell after
Tropical Storm Irene brought cooler weather to U.S. Northeast,
paring demand for power to run air conditioners in the second-
biggest market for Canada’s gas exports.  High temperatures in  New York , which trailed normal through
the weekend, will reach the historical average of 80 degrees
Fahrenheit (27 Celsius) Sept. 1, according to AccuWeather Inc.
Utilities are working to restore power to almost 6 million U.S.
homes and businesses from North Carolina to Maine after Irene
moved through the region.  “Irene was pretty bearish,” said Kyle Cooper, director of
research with IAF Advisors in Houston. Heat in other parts of
the U.S. may temper the price decline, he said.  Alberta gas for September fell 3.25 cents to C$3.40 per
gigajoule ($3.29 per million British thermal units) as of 3:30
p.m. New York time, according to  NGX,  a Canadian Internet
market. Gas traded on the exchange is shipped to users in  Canada 
and the U.S., and is priced on TransCanada Corp.’s Alberta
system.  October gas on NGX fell 3.25 cents to C$3.385 per
gigagoule. Gas for October delivery on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  fell 7.4 cents to settle at $3.857 per million Btu.  Gas at the Alliance Pipeline delivery point near  Chicago 
rose 0.22 cent to $3.9882 per million Btu on the
 Intercontinental Exchange . Alliance is an express line that can
carry about 1.5 billion cubic feet a day to the Midwest from
western Canada.  Spot Prices  At the Kingsgate point on the border of  Idaho  and British
Columbia, gas was down 2.49 cents to $3.7741, according to ICE.
At Malin,  Oregon , where Canadian gas is traded for California
markets, gas fell 1.16 cents to $3.8669.  Volume on  TransCanada’s   Alberta  system, which collects the
output of most of the nation’s gas wells, was 15.4 billion cubic
feet, 348 million below target.  Gas was flowing at a daily rate of 2.87 billion cubic feet
at Empress, Alberta, where the fuel is transferred to
TransCanada’s main line.  At McNeil, Saskatchewan, where gas is transferred to the
Northern Border Pipeline for shipment to the Chicago area, the
daily flow rate was 1.75 billion cubic feet.  Available capacity on TransCanada’s British Columbia system
at Kingsgate was 1.31 billion cubic feet. The system was
forecast to carry 1.45 billion cubic feet today, about 53
percent of its capacity of 2.76 billion.  The volume on  Spectra Energy’s  British Columbia system,
which gathers the fuel in northeastern British Columbia for
delivery to Vancouver and the Pacific Northwest, totaled 2.89
billion cubic feet at 2:50 p.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
