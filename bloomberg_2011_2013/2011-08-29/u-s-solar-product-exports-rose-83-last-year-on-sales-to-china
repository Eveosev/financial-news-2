U.S. exports of solar products
climbed 83 percent last year to $5.63 billion as increasing
production in  China  drove up sales of manufacturing equipment
and raw materials, according to the  Solar Energy Industries
Association .  Polysilicon producers including  MEMC Electronic Materials
Inc. (WFR)  and Hemlock Semiconductor Corp. exported $2.52 billion of
the basic material used to make solar cells and exports of
capital equipment were $1.4 billion, according to a report
released today by the Washington-based trade group and GTM
Research. Those were the two largest export categories.  The top solar import was photovoltaic modules, worth $2.4
billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
