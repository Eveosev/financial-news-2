Deutsche Lufthansa AG (LHA)  was sued by
Verband Sozialer Wettbewerb e.V. over allegation it forces large
clients to disclose rebates they get from other airlines,
Financial Times Deutschland reported, without saying where it
got the information.  German antitrust-regulators are also looking at the issue,
the newspaper said. The Verband Sozialer Wettbewerb is an
interest group working for fair business practices,  according  to
the FT Deutschland.  Lufthansa spokesman Boris Ogursky said the company won’t
comment on the suit. Its terms and conditions comply with legal
requirements and its contracts have no clause requiring
customers to disclose rebates they get from Lufthansa’s
competitors, he said.  Bloomberg was unable to contact the Verband Sozialer
Wettbewerb by phone before office hours. The Federal Cartel
Office’s press department didn’t immediately reply to an e-mail
seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
