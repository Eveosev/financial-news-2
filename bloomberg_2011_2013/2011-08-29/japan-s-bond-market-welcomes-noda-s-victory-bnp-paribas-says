Koji Shimamoto, chief strategist at
BNP Paribas in  Tokyo , comments on Japan’s bond market and the
election of Finance Minister  Yoshihiko Noda  as head of the
nation’s ruling party.  Ten-year yields will trade in a range of 0.95 percent to
1.05 percent in the near term, Shimamoto said. The yield fell
1.5 basis points to 1.02 percent as of 4:14 p.m. in Tokyo.  “The outcome was unexpected because it had been projected
to be in this order -- Trade Minister Banri Kaieda, former
foreign minister  Seiji Maehara  and then Noda.”  “Bonds were bought on the victory of Noda, who is regarded
as an advocate of fiscal tightening.”  Party unity is key to the new leader’s fiscal policy,
Shimamoto said. It will be difficult to implement fiscal
tightening immediately because  Ichiro Ozawa , a former party
leader, and other candidates for the leadership election are
opposed to tax increases, Shimamoto said.  The president of the Democratic Party of Japan will become
the nation’s premier because of its strength in parliament.  To contact the reporter on this story:
