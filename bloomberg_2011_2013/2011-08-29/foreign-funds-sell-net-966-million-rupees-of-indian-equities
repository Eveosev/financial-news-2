Overseas investors sold a net 966
million rupees ($21 million) of Indian stocks on Aug. 26,
increasing their outflows from equities this year to 6.2 billion
rupees, the nation’s market regulator said.  Foreigners bought 21.61 billion rupees of shares and sold
22.58 billion rupees, the  Securities and Exchange Board of India 
said  today . They bought a net 10.3 billion rupees of bonds,
taking total flows into debt to 192 billion rupees.  Overseas investors bought a record 1.33 trillion rupees of
shares in 2010, helping fuel a 17 percent rally in the Bombay
Stock Exchange’s Sensitive Index, the best performer among the
world’s 10 biggest equity markets last year. They invested 464
billion rupees in bonds last year.  The previous record was in 2009 when flows reached 834.2
billion rupees, sparking the biggest rally in 18 years. Funds
pulled out a record 530 billion rupees from equities in 2008,
setting off the worst annual slump. Foreign funds have placed
4.465 trillion rupees in stocks and 978.7 billion rupees in
bonds since they were allowed into the country in 1993.  The regulator provides data on shares bought and sold by
large investors, including trades in the primary and secondary
markets, with a delay of at least a day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
