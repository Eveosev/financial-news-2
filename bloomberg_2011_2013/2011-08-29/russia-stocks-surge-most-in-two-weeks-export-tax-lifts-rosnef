Russian stocks climbed the most in
more than three months, led by the country’s biggest oil
producers, as investors bet new tax changes will bolster
revenue.  The  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  jumped 3.7 percent to 1,512.36 by the 6:45
p.m. close in Moscow, the biggest gain since May 26 and paring a
11 percent loss this month. OAO Rosneft, Russia’s largest oil
producer, added 7.4 percent, while OAO Lukoil, the second-
biggest, advanced 3.7 percent. OAO Aeroflot, the nation’s
largest airline, soared 8.1 percent. The dollar-denominated RTS
Index climbed 4.5 percent to 1,667.66.  Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin  approved last week raising
export duties on heavy oil products, such as  fuel oil , while
lowering the rate for lighter products including diesel.
Emerging-market stocks rose for a second day after the  Federal
Reserve  said the  U.S. economy  is gradually recovering and it has
the tools to spur growth. A report today showed U.S.  consumer
spending  increased more than forecast.  “The oil product tax news is providing a kicker in the
context of low valuations for these stocks,” Tom Mundy, a
strategist at Otkritie Capital in Moscow, said by phone today.  Rosneft added the most since May 2010, while Lukoil had its
strongest advance since May 31. The companies trade at 5.9 and
4.4 times earnings, respectively, compared with 6.3 times
earnings for Brazil’s state-controlled oil producer Petroleo
Brasileiro SA, Bloomberg data show. The Micex is valued at 4.4
times earnings versus 8.4 times for Brazil’s Bovespa benchmark
measure.  Urals crude, Russia’s chief export blend, gained 0.2
percent to $111.66. Crude for October delivery climbed 2.6
percent, to $87.62 a barrel in  New York .  U.S. Spending  Stocks gained globally after consumer spending climbed more
than forecast in July as Americans dipped into savings to buy
cars and cool their homes, showing the biggest part of the
economy is holding up. Purchases rose 0.8 percent, the biggest
gain since February, after a 0.1 percent decline the prior
month, Commerce Department figures showed today in  Washington .  OAO Sberbank, Russia’s biggest lender, advanced 5.2 percent
to 81.61 rubles, the most in 10 months.  The bank is due to report second-quarter earnings tomorrow.
Net income probably jumped fourfold in the second quarter to
88.2 billion rubles ($3.1 billion), from 20.7 billion rubles a
year earlier, according to 10 estimates in a Bloomberg survey of
analysts. Sberbank reported profit doubled in the first quarter
to 86.8 billion rubles, beating forecasts.  The Micex has dropped 10 percent this year. That compares
with a 21 percent slide for  Brazil ’s Bovespa Index. The Shanghai
Composite Index trades at 13.8 times estimated earnings, and
India’s Sensex trades at 14.7 times.  To contact the reporter on this story:
