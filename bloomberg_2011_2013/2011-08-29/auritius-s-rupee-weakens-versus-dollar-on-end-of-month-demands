Mauritius’s rupee is heading for its
lowest level in a week against the dollar as companies bought
the greenback to pay for goods.  The currency depreciated as much as 1 percent to 28.05 per
dollar and traded 0.6 percent down at 27.95 by 12:15 p.m. in
 Port Louis , the capital. A close at this level would be the
weakest since Aug. 22, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Versus the euro, the rupee weakened for a third day, its longest
streak since June 29, retreating 1.1 percent to 40.582.  “Exporters and importers seem to be more active at bank
treasury desks to cater for their end-of-month commitments in
rupees,” Fabien Gebert, treasurer at  GML , which describes
itself as Mauritius’s largest investment company by assets, said
by phone today. “Sellers, already active during the previous
trading sessions, are currently looking for a better rate,
contributing therefore to a temporary, slight depreciation of
the local currency.”  Mauritius, with a population of 1.3 million people, is a
net importer of food commodities and fuels, with 67 percent of
imports bills denominated in dollars, according to Bank of
Mauritius.  Buying prices for the dollar were from 27.1257 to 27.291
rupees, while the selling price was 28.583 per dollar, compared
with 28.6446 on Aug. 26, according to  indicative exchange rates 
published today on the Bank of Mauritius’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
