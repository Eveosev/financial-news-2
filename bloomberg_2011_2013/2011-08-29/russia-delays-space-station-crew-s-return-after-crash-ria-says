Russia  is postponing the return of
three of six astronauts currently on board the International
 Space Station  after a cargo spacecraft crashed last week, RIA
Novosti reported, citing a Russian official.  Two Russians and an American, who were due to come back to
Earth on Sept. 8 on a Soyuz TMA-21 craft, may leave the space
station on Sept. 16, RIA cited Alexei Krasnov, head of piloted
programs at Roskosmos, the Russian space agency, as saying.  If a further postponement is required, there are enough
supplies to last the six astronauts on board the station for
three months, the state news service reported, citing Krasnov.  Russia will also delay a manned flight planned for Sept. 22
from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in  Kazakhstan  to late October or
early November as the cause of the crash is investigated,
Krasnov said, according to RIA. The flight was to bring three
new astronauts to inhabit the station.  To contact the reporter on this story:
