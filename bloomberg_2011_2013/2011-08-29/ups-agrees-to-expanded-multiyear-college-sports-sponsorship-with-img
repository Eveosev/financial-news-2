United Parcel Service Inc. (UPS) , the
world’s biggest package-delivery company, expanded its college
sports sponsorship program with an additional 68 schools.  In an agreement reached with IMG College, a division of
management and marketing agency IMG Worldwide, UPS will have
branding and promotional rights with the Big Ten and Pac-12
conferences.  The deal gives Atlanta-based UPS access to many of the
U.S.’s top football and basketball schools and their fans, UPS
said in a statement. The partnership includes on-campus, in-
stadium, and licensing, broadcast, print and web sponsorship.  IMG College, which has acquired and consolidated collegiate
media rights over the past several years, called the agreement
the “largest non-network TV sponsorship in the history of
college sports.”  Terms of the agreement weren’t disclosed by IMG College,
based in Winston-Salem,  North Carolina , or UPS.  To contact the reporter on this story: Michael Buteau in Atlanta
