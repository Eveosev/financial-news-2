South Korean manufacturers’
confidence fell to a 21-month low as concerns over  Europe ’s debt
crisis and a faltering U.S. recovery roiled financial markets
and damped the outlook for exports.  An index measuring expectations for September dropped to 86
from 91 for August, the Bank of Korea said in a statement in
 Seoul  today. That’s the lowest level since December 2009. A
measure of expectations at non-manufacturing companies was
unchanged from August at 83.  The survey, conducted from Aug. 16 to Aug. 23, was based on
responses from 1,643 manufacturers and 898 non-manufacturers.  To contact the reporters on this story:
