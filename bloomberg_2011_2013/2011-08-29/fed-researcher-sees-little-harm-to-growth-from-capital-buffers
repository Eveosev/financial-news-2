Tougher capital requirements aimed
at offsetting future financial crises may protect banks with
little harm to the economy, a Federal Reserve Bank of  San
Francisco  economist said.  “These buffers raise the classic regulatory dilemma of
safety versus economic growth, but may provide protection
against financial calamity at an acceptable cost,” Oscar Jorda,
a research adviser at the regional Fed bank, said in a paper
released today.  Policy makers are trying to design regulations that account
for swings in the economy and financial markets and avoid a
repeat of the financial panic that began with the collapse of
subprime mortgage market in 2007. The Basel Committee on Bank
Supervision, made up of representatives from more than two dozen
countries, last year proposed requiring banks to increase their
quantity and quality of capital.  Under an agreement known as Basel III, the idea of variable
or countercyclical buffers was introduced, which would require
institutions to boost capital amid lending booms to strengthen
balance sheets and slow any credit bubbles. International,
systemically important firms would be asked to hold extra
equity.  Jorda cited studies of the economic impact, including one
from the New York Fed estimating lost output of 0.08 percent to
0.09 percent for each percentage point increase in  capital
requirements . “These estimates should be woven into the
regulatory decision-making process,” Jorda said in the bank’s
Economic Letter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
