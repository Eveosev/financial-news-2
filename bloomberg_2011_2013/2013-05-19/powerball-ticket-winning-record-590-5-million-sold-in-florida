A single ticket sold in  Florida 
matched all six numbers drawn in the  Powerball  lottery to win
the game’s largest-ever jackpot of $590.5 million.  Yesterday’s prize eclipses the previous Powerball record of
$587 million, won Nov. 28, the organization said in an e-mailed
statement released by the Massachusetts  state lottery .  The winner, who wasn’t identified, has the option to
receive the money in annual payments over 29 years or as a $371
million lump sum. The winning ticket was sold at a Publix
supermarket in the city of Zephyrhills, the Associated Press
reported, citing Florida Lottery executive Cindy O’Connell.  The game’s jackpot had been increasing since the previous
winner took the top prize on March 30, Powerball said. Since
then, total Powerball sales have exceeded $1.24 billion,
according to the group, which includes the lotteries of 43
states, the District of Columbia and the U.S. Virgin Islands.
The top prize has been reset at $40 million for the May 22 draw.  To contact the reporter on this story:
