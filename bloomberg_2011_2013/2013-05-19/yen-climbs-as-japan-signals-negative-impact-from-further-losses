The yen gained the most in three
weeks against the dollar as Japanese Economy Minister Akira
Amari said further losses in the currency would have negative
effects after it fell to the lowest since 2008 last week.  Japan ’s currency rose versus 15 of its 16 most-traded peers
after Amari said yesterday there’s speculation its past strength
has “been corrected a lot.”  New Zealand ’s dollar climbed as
Finance Minister  Bill English  said  home prices  will pressure the
central bank to raise interest rates. South Africa’s rand slid
to a four-year low amid bets slowing inflation will give the
nation’s central bank room to cut rates.  Amari’s comments “were partially designed to at the very
least slow the pace of the yen’s fall in recent sessions,”  Joe Manimbo , a market analyst at Western Union Business Solutions, a
unit of Western Union Co., said in a phone interview from
 Washington . “That was the catalyst for investors to pare back
on some of their dollar enthusiasm.”  The yen advanced 0.9 percent to 102.27 per dollar at 5 p.m.
 New York  time, after gaining as much as 1.2 percent, the most
since April 26. It touched 103.31 on May 17, the weakest level
since Oct. 6, 2008. Japan’s currency strengthened 0.6 percent to
131.75 per euro. The dollar weakened 0.3 percent to $1.2882 per
euro after appreciating to $1.2797 on May 17, the strongest
level since April 4.  Options Trading  Trading in over-the-counter foreign-exchange options
totaled $28 billion, compared with $45 billion on May 17,
according to data reported by U.S. banks to the Depository Trust
Clearing Corp. and tracked by Bloomberg. Volume in options on
the dollar-yen  exchange rate  amounted to $6.1 billion, the
largest share of trades at 22 percent. Euro-dollar options were
the second most-actively traded, at $5.1 billion, or 18 percent.  Euro-dollar options trading was 120 percent above the
average for the past five Mondays at a similar time in the day,
according to Bloomberg analysis. Dollar-yen options trading was
26 percent below average.  New Zealand’s dollar, nicknamed the kiwi, climbed versus
all of its 16 most-traded counterparts.  “These households heading into quite high debt to buy
highly priced houses need to be aware at some stage the RBNZ
will increase interest rates, particularly if the housing market
keeps growing at rapid rates,” English said yesterday in an
interview broadcast on  Television New Zealand , referring to the
 Reserve Bank  of New Zealand.  The kiwi rose 1.3 percent to 81.73 U.S. cents after falling
to 80.61 cents on May 17, the weakest since Nov. 16.  Rand Slides  The rand dropped for an eighth day against the dollar, the
longest losing stretch in a year, before the Monetary Policy
Committee announces its interest-rate decision on May 23.  The South African Reserve Bank has left its benchmark
repurchase rate at 5 percent since an unexpected reduction in
July to support growth in Africa’s biggest economy. Lower
commodity prices and slowing consumer demand are reducing
pressure on inflation.  The rand sank 0.4 percent to 9.4432 per dollar and reached
9.4872, the weakest since April 2009.  The Czech koruna fell to a three-year low versus the euro
after the Prague-based newspaper  Hospodarske Noviny  reported
central-bank board member Lubomir Lizal as saying currency
intervention is “much faster and more effective” than further
lowering  interest rates .  The koruna declined 0.5 percent to 26.161 per euro and
touched 26.191, the weakest since May 2010.  Yen’s Drop  The yen has slumped 19 percent in the past six months, the
worst performer of 10 developed-nation currencies tracked by
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes, as Prime Minister Shinzo
Abe pledged to beat deflation and the  Bank of Japan  doubled
monthly bond purchases. The dollar gained 3.2 percent in the
same period and the euro advanced 3.7 percent.  Japanese Economy Minister Amari said yesterday further yen
weakness may hurt “people’s lives.” It’s government’s job to
minimize that, he said on public broadcaster NHK.  “People still want to be short yen, but are just waiting
for better levels,”  Geoffrey Yu , a senior currency strategist
in London at UBS AG, said in a telephone interview. “The market
right now is somewhat inclined to look for reasons to sell
dollar-yen rather than buy anything back.” Short positions are
bets a currency will weaken.  Key Level  The yen may decline to its weakest level against the dollar
in more than four and a half years after breaking a key level of
support, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.  The Japanese currency will face a test at 103.50 per dollar
after breaching the 103-to-103.10 area on May 17, according to
Niall O’Connor, a technical analyst at JPMorgan in New York. If
the yen declines past that support level, it may target 105.50,
the 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement of the currency’s 2007
high, O’Connor said. That would be its weakest level since Oct.
3, 2008.  The  Dollar Index (DXY) , which IntercontinentalExchange Inc. uses
to track the greenback against currencies of six U.S. trading
partners, fell 0.5 percent to 83.809 after rising to 84.371 on
May 17, the highest since July 13, 2010.  The gauge has rallied 5 percent this year amid speculation
the  Federal Reserve  will reduce the pace of its monthly bond
purchases as the economy improves.  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  will testify to the Joint
Economic Committee of Congress on May 22, and the  Federal Open
Market Committee  will release the minutes of its April 30-May 1
meeting the same day.  To contact the reporters on this story:
