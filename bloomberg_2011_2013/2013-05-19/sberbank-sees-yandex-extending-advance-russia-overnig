Yandex NV (YNDX)  will extend gains from a
20-month high as Russia’s biggest Internet company boosts its
dominance of the search market, according to Sberbank Investment
Research’s  Anna Lepetukhina , the most accurate analyst covering
the stock.  Shares of Yandex, which owns Russia’s most-used web search
engine, surged 8.6 percent to $29.01 in  New York  last week, the
highest level since Sept. 19, 2011. The Hague-based company had
the biggest gain on the Bloomberg Russia-US Equity Index of the
most-traded Russian companies in the U.S., which fell for a
second week. RTS Index futures were unchanged in U.S. hours May
17.  Yandex, which gets most of its  revenue  from online ads,
lifted its share of Russian searches to an average 61.9 percent
in the three months through April, the most since August 2011,
according to LiveInternet.ru data. Of the 20 Yandex  analysts , 75
percent recommend buying its shares, with the average 12-month
target price of $30.95 implying a 6.7 percent jump from current
levels, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  “Yandex dominates the Russian search market and is
steadily increasing its market share,” Lepetukhina, who has a
buy rating on the stock, said by phone from Moscow May 17.
“Consumers are very comfortable with it and have no intention
to migrate to other  search engines , such as Google.”  Lepetukhina is ranked first among analysts covering Yandex
after her recommendations delivered the best total returns over
the past year, data compiled by Bloomberg show. She has a price
target of $31.58 on the stock, representing a 8.9 percent jump
by February 2014.  RTS Futures  Futures expiring in June on the RTS held at 140,490 May 17
as the Bloomberg Russia-US gauge added 1.6 percent, paring a 1.1
percent slump in the week. The  Market Vectors Russia ETF (RSX) ,  the
largest dedicated Russian exchange-traded fund, advanced 1.4
percent to $26.92 in New York, trimming its weekly drop to 2.5
percent. The RTS Volatility Index, which measures expected
swings in the stock  futures (VEA) , dropped 0.5 percent to 20.66.  Yandex’s share of the Russian search market is 2.4 times as
large as  Mountain View , California-based  Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s 26
percent, according to the LiveInternet data. Web advertising in
Russia rose 35 percent in 2012 to $1.87 billion, according to
the Association of Communication Agencies of Russia, or AKAR.
The segment will grow 32 percent in 2013, according to UBS AG.  Shares of Yandex have surged 16 percent since April 25,
when the company boosted its 2013 sales target on growth in
online advertising. Yandex posted a 79 percent  increase  in
first-quarter profit last month and said revenue may rise 30
percent to 35 percent this year, up from a February forecast of
28 percent to 32 percent growth.  Share Buyback  The company buying back shares will also boost the stock,
said Sergei Osipov, analyst at UBS in Moscow, said by phone May
17. Yandex announced plans in March to repurchase as much as 12
million shares, and has already bought 2 million, according to
the company’s April 25 conference call.  UBS reiterated its buy rating on Yandex and increased its
12-month price target by 26 percent to $33, according to an e-mailed report dated May 17.  “More buybacks should be expected as the company has sent
a clear signal to the market on how it plans to distribute its
profit,” he said.  Yandex May 17 surge capped a four-day rally. The shares
advanced for a fourth week, gaining 44 percent in the longest
stretch of weekly advances since Feb. 15.  Russia’s  economy  grew 1.6 percent in the first quarter, the
weakest pace since 2009, as the euro area’s longest recession
hurt demand for commodity exports. That compares with a median
estimate of 1.2 percent in a Bloomberg  survey  of 23 economists
and a 1.1 percent increase projected by the  Economy Ministry .  Mechel’s Ouster  OAO Mechel (MTL) , Russia’s biggest producer of coking coal, fell
the most on the Bloomberg Russia-US gauge last week, slumping 15
percent to $3.65. MSCI Inc. said May 15 that it will remove the
stock from its Russia index as of June 3, a decision that may
spur funds that track the index to excise  Mechel (MTLR)  from their
portfolios.  Moscow’s core stock market halted trading for 16 minutes
May 17, following an error during routine procedures, according
to a  statement  posted on the Moscow Exchange’s website. Trading
