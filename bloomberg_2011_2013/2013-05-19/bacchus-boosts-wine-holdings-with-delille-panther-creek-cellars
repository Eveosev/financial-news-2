Bacchus Capital Management LLC said
it’s expanding its wine holdings through the investment of
capital in Woodinville, Washington-based DeLille Cellars and the
acquisition of  Oregon  winery Panther Creek Cellars.  DeLille is a winery founded in 1992 with a 20-acre (8-hectare) vineyard in  Washington ’s Red Mountain region and other
sites in the Yakima Valley, according to a statement on the
website of Bacchus, a San Francisco-based private equity firm.
Panther Creek is based in Oregon’s Willamette Valley.  The moves come as demand from wine collectors and investors
has contributed to a rally in prices this year on the Liv-ex
Fine Wine 50 Index. The index, while slipping back since late
March after posting four straight monthly gains, is still up 5
percent so far in 2013.  “We invest in businesses and winemakers we believe in,”
Peter Kaufman, Bacchus co-founder and managing partner, said in
the statement. “For DeLille Cellars, we have provided growth
capital and in Panther’s case, it’s an outright acquisition.”  DeLille makes Bordeaux-style wines, along with other reds
similar to those of the  Rhone Valley  and other parts of southern
 France , under winemaker Chris Upchurch, according to the
statement. Panther Creek produces Pinot Noir, Pinot Gris and
Chardonnay wines.  To contact the reporter on this story:
