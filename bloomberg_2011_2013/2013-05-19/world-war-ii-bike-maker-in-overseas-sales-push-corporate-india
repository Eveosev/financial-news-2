The Indian maker of  Royal Enfield ,
the World War II-era British motorcycle owned by stars including
 Brad Pitt , plans to export the vehicles to  Southeast Asia  and
 Latin America  as it builds on record sales at home.  Eicher Motors Ltd. (EIM)  is predicting more demand in  emerging
markets  for mid-sized bikes with an engine capacity of 250 to
650 cubic centimeters as people become more affluent, Managing
Director Siddhartha Lal said in an interview. Eicher, which
acquired control of Enfield  India  in 1993 and revived the
almost-bankrupt unit, is seeking to increase the share of
revenue from two-wheelers from 16 percent of the $1.2 billion it
 reported  in the year to Dec. 31, 2012, he said.  “Mid-sized bikes are ideal for these markets as they are
reasonably fuel-efficient, maneuverable and not too much more
expensive,” Lal said in his office located in Eicher’s glass
and steel headquarters in Gurgaon near  New Delhi . “There are
markets that aren’t conducive to big bikes and the mid-sized
market is underserved.”  The company is planning to expand the  motorcycle business 
after reporting the best quarter at its Enfield unit, where
sales rose 45 percent in the three months ended March 31.
Eicher, which earns the remaining 84 percent of its revenue from
trucks it makes in partnership with  Volvo AB (VOLVB) , said a key gauge
of its profitability beat all local rivals in 2012 amid the
slowest pace of economic growth in a decade.  ‘Flying Flea’  ‘Tonight Show’ host  Jay Leno  and musician  Billy Joel  are
also among the owners of Royal Enfield, according to their
official websites. The British military used the bikes,
including the ‘Flying Flea’ designed for parachute drops with
airborne troops during the Second World War.  Royal Enfield, which makes the 150,000 rupee ($2,733) 500cc
Classic and the 350cc Thunderbird, saw sales jump 52 percent
last year fueled by demand from a rising middle class in India’s
biggest cities.  Exports, catering to custom orders from buyers seeking to
“ own a piece of history ” in countries such as the U.S., U.K.
and Australia, accounted for 2.9 percent of the motorcycle
maker’s 124,270 unit sales in the year ended March 31, according
to data from the  Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers .  “There’s a gap in this segment as vehicles like BMW and
Harley Davidson are all above 600cc,” said Mukesh Saraf, an
analyst at Spark Capital Advisors in the southern city of
 Chennai . “If other Indian manufacturers like Bajaj are able to
export, then Royal Enfield can do as well. There’s no way to
gauge the potential of the mid-size segment both abroad and in
India.”  ‘Like a Gun’  Bajaj Auto Ltd. (BJAUT) , India’s second-biggest maker of
motorcycles exported 1.29 million motorcycles, or more than 33
percent of the 4.78 million it produced in the year ended March
31. The Pune-based company sells motorcycles ranging from the
100 cc Discover to the 220 cc Pulsar.  With its heritage as a weapons maker and ‘Made like a gun’
as tag line, Royal Enfield started in the 1890s making bicycles,
lawn mowers and motorcycles in England. Since the 1940s, the
company hasn’t much altered the technology in the single-cylinder engined two-wheelers except for modern features such as
direct fuel injection and switch ignition.  The bike maker will introduce a new model, a 535cc ’cafe
racer’ called the Continental GT this year, while planning two
more platforms for future variants, Lal said, without
elaborating.  Waiting Lists  The company last month opened its first new motorcycle
factory in almost six decades, that can build 150,000 units
annually. That capacity will be expanded to 250,000 in 2014, as
Eicher looks to pare waiting lists that average 8 months, Lal
said. Lal expects deliveries to jump 39 percent to 175,000 units
in 2013.  The Enfield motorcycles are more for enthusiasts than for
people who need vehicles to do their daily chores, which means
 Harley-Davidson Inc. (HOG) ’s lower-end bikes could pose a challenge
for the Indian maker in these markets, said  Mahantesh Sabarad ,
an analyst at Fortune Financial Services India Ltd. in Mumbai.  “There’s a potential in these markets, but it will take a
long time for them to build their brand,” he said.  Commercial Vehicles  Eicher depends on its commercial-vehicle business for its
profitability. Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortization was 8.7 percent in 2012, compared with 7.2 percent
for  Ashok Leyland Ltd. (AL)  in the year ended March 31, and 7.7
percent for  Tata Motors Ltd. (TATA) ’s local business in the 12 months
through March 2012.  VE Commercial Vehicles Ltd., an equal venture with Volvo,
sold 44,790 units in India in the year ended March 31, making it
the nation’s fourth-largest commercial vehicle maker. Ashok
Leyland delivered 105,711 vehicles, Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd.
sold 142,796 trucks and buses. Tata, which controls 56 percent
of the market, reported sales of 444,791 units, according to
Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers data.  Eicher’s  shares  have rallied 20 percent this year and
traded at 3,495.70 rupees today in Mumbai. That compares with a
3.4 percent decline for Tata Motors, a 13 percent  slump  for
Bajaj and a 4 percent gain in the benchmark S&P BSE  Sensex (SENSEX) 
index.  Royal Enfield, whose Classic fitted with a sidecar featured
in the movie ‘ Harry Potter  and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1,’
says its masterplan involves eventually building 500,000
motorcycles annually.  The company has its products planned for the next 10 years,
Lal said without elaborating, as Eicher targets more customers
beyond Delhi, Mumbai and Bangalore.  “Now, we’re firing on all cylinders,” says Lal. “To me,
what’s relevant is that in the top mid-size motorcycle markets
in the world, we must be No. 1 or No. 2.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
