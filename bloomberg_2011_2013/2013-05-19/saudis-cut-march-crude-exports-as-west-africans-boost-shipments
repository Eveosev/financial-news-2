Saudi Arabia , Kuwait, and  Venezuela 
reduced crude oil exports in March from the previous month while
West African members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries increased shipments, according to official data.  OPEC’s biggest producer, Saudi Arabia, shipped 7.42 million
barrels a day, down 30,000 barrels a day from February, figures
published today by the Joint Organisations Data Initiative
showed. The kingdom kept its output little changed at 9.14
million barrels a day in March, or 10,000 barrels less than in
the previous month, according to the data posted on the
initiative’s website.  Kuwait, OPEC’s fourth-largest producer, trimmed March
exports by 6 percent to 1.85 million barrels a day, and the
Persian Gulf state shipped less crude than in any month since
July 2011, statistics from the initiative known as JODI showed.
Venezuelan exports dropped to the lowest level in a year at 1.55
million barrels a day, the data showed.  Angola  and Nigeria both increased shipments in March, with
Angola exporting 1.74 million barrels a day, up from 1.59
million, to the highest in three years, according to the data.
Nigeria exported 2.04 million barrels a day, up from 1.87
million in February, the figured showed.  Demand for crude from OPEC, which supplies about 40 percent
of the world’s oil, will average 29.8 million barrels a day in
2013, the group estimated in its monthly oil report published on
May 10. OPEC forecast a decrease of 400,000 barrels a day from
last year, while making an upward adjustment of 100,000 barrels
a day from its previous estimate in April.  Iraq , OPEC’s second-largest producer, shipped 2.42 million
barrels a day in March, the data showed. The country didn’t
submit comparative data for February.  Iran ,  Libya  and the  United
Arab Emirates  didn’t provide data for March.  JODI, supervised by the Riyadh-based International Energy
Forum, uses statistics supplied by national governments to
compile data on imports, exports and output for oil-producing
and consuming nations. The data include crude oil and
condensates and exclude natural-gas liquids.  To contact the reporter on this story:
