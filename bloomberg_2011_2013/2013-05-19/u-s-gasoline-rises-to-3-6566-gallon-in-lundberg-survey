The average price for regular
gasoline at U.S. pumps rose 11.19 cents a gallon in the past two
weeks to $3.6566 a gallon, according to Lundberg Survey Inc.  The survey covers the period ended May 17 and is based on
information obtained at about 2,500 filling stations by the
Camarillo, California-based company.  The average, which reached a year-to-date peak of $3.795 in
the period ended Feb. 22, is 12.67 cents below the year-earlier
price of $3.7833 a gallon.  The recent increase is “one of the exceptions to the rule
that most likely crude oil will be the mover and shaker for
change in the direction of gasoline prices at retail,” Trilby Lundberg, president of Lundberg Survey, said yesterday in a
telephone interview. “It was driven by infrastructure problems
downstream at the refinery level.”  Wholesale price increases related to refinery issues
haven’t been passed fully along to consumers, and some
retailers’ profit margins have been squeezed, Lundberg said.
Drivers in the U.S. West and Midwest have been among the most
affected by higher prices so far, she said. U.S. prices may rise
4 cents to 7 cents in coming days, Lundberg said, and increases
may pause before the Memorial Day holiday next week.  Gasoline futures  on the New York Mercantile Exchange rose
8.15 cents, or 2.9 percent, to $2.0969 a gallon in the two weeks
ended May 17. It was the highest settlement since April 9.  WTI Crude  U.S. gasoline stockpiles  rose 2.59 million barrels in the
week ended May 10 to 217.7 million, the first increase in five
weeks, according to data from the Energy Information
Administration, the statistical arm of the Energy Department.  West Texas Intermediate oil on the Nymex rose 41 cents, or
0.4 percent, to $96.02 a barrel in the two weeks to May 17.
Prices have advanced 11 percent since April 17, when they
reached $86.68, the lowest settlement of the year.  Crude  inventories  fell 624,000 barrels in the week ended
May 10 to 394.9 million, the first decline in four weeks,
according to EIA data. Supplies at Cushing,  Oklahoma , the
delivery point for the Nymex futures contract, increased 575,000
barrels to 49.7 million.  Crude futures probably will fall this week on concern that
weaker economic growth will reduce fuel demand, a Bloomberg
survey showed.  Eighteen of 35 analysts, or 51 percent, forecast crude will
drop through May 24. Seven respondents, or 20 percent, predicted
a gain. Ten said there would be little change.  The highest price for gasoline in the lower 48 U.S. states
among the markets surveyed was in  Minneapolis , where the average
was $4.27 a gallon, Lundberg said. The lowest price was in
Tucson,  Arizona , where customers paid an average of $3.18 a
gallon.  Regular gasoline averaged $3.77 a gallon on Long Island,
New York, and $4.05 in Los Angeles.  To contact the reporters on this story:
