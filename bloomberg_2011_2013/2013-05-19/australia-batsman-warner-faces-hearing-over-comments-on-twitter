Australia batsman  David Warner  will
face a Cricket Australia code of behavior hearing May 22 after
abusive comments were posted on his Twitter account.  The governing body said today that Warner’s case will be
heard via teleconference by Senior Code of Behavior Commissioner
Gordon Lewis and the results communicated following his
adjudication. Warner was yesterday reported for alleged
“ unbecoming behavior ” after abusive messages to journalists,
some containing obscene language, appeared on his Twitter feed.  Warner, a member of Australia’s 16-man squad for the Ashes
series in  England  starting July 10, is alleged to have breached
Rule 6, which states: “Players and officials must not at
anytime engage in behavior unbecoming to a representative player
or official that could (a) bring them or the game of cricket
into disrepute or (b) be harmful to the interests of cricket.
This rule applies at all times where the unbecoming behavior
involves the player being involved in public comment or comment
to or in the media.”  Opening batsman Warner, 26, has played 19 Tests for
 Australia , scoring 1,263 runs, including three centuries, at an
average of 39.46.  To contact the reporter on this story:
