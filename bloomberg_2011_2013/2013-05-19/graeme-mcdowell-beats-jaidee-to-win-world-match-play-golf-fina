Graeme McDowell of  Northern Ireland 
came back to beat Thongchai Jaidee in the final of the World
Match Play Championship in Kavarna, Bulgaria.  McDowell was two down after four holes before coming back
against the Thai to win 2-and-1. In the semifinals, McDowell
beat South Africa’s Branden Grace 3-and-2, and Jaidee defeated
Thomas Aiken by the same margin.  The Northern Irish golfer made last year’s final, but lost
to Nicolas Colsaerts of  Belgium . McDowell defeated Colsaerts
yesterday in the quarterfinal, and then advanced to the final
with a semifinal victory earlier today. He clinched the title
against Jaidee by halving the par-3 17th hole.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
