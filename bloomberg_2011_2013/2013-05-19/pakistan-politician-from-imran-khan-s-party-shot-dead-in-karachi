The vice president of former Pakistan
cricketer Imran Khan’sTehreek-e-Insaf party was shot dead
outside her home in Karachi yesterday.  Zara Shahid Hussain was killed by three men as she parked
her car after arriving home yesterday evening, Nasir Aftab, a
senior superintendent of police in Karachi in the southern Sindh
province, said by phone today.  “The police are investigating whether this was a case of
pure assassination or resisting an armed robbery,” Aftab said.
‘We are still waiting for all the evidence to be collected and
investigated.’’  The killing came before a re-vote today at several polling
stations in a Karachi constituency, after the initial results of
the May 11 national elections were disputed by Khan’s party,
which alleged that the outcome was rigged.  To contact the reporters on this story:
