Yanzhou Coal Mining Co. (1171)  plans to meet
with bond investors from today to discuss a possible sale of
dollar-denominated subordinated notes with no fixed maturity.  The Shandong-based miner’s securities will be issued by a
wholly-owned unit and guaranteed by  Yanzhou Coal , it said in a
 statement  to the Hong Kong stock exchange yesterday. Proceeds
will be used for debt repayment, capital expenditure, working
capital and general corporate purposes, the miner said.  Moody’s Investors Service assigned a provisional Ba2 rating
to Yanzhou Coal’s possible offering, two steps below investment
grade, according to an e-mailed statement today.  Fitch Ratings 
expects to give the securities an equivalent BB grade, it said
separately.  The perpetual securities “will provide additional funding
to Yanzhou Coal for the purposes of managing its business in a
down-cycle,” Alan Gao, a senior analyst at Moody’s, said in the
statement.  Yanzhou Coal hired Barclays Plc, Citigroup Inc., Deutsche
Bank AG, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and  UBS AG (UBSN)  to arrange the
proposed issue, according to its stock exchange filing. The sale
amount, terms and conditions haven’t been set, the company said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
