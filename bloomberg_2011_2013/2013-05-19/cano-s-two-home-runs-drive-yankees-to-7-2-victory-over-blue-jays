Robinson Cano blasted two home runs
to lead the  New York  Yankees to a 7-2 victory over the Toronto
Blue Jays in a Major League Baseball game.  The Yankees (27-16) won their second straight game,
extending their first-place lead to 1 ½ games over the Boston
Red Sox in the American League East.  Brett Gardner singled home a run in the third inning last
night, then scored on Cano’s first homer to give the team a 3-0
lead at Yankee Stadium.  Cano hit another two-run homer in the fifth and Travis Hafner hit one in the eighth inning.  Colby Rasmus drove in a run in the fourth inning and Edwin Encarnacion had a solo homer in the eighth for the Blue Jays
(17-26), who are last in the AL East, 10 games behind the
Yankees.  David Phelps (2-2) allowed one run on six hits and struck
out eight in seven innings for the Yankees. Brandon Morrow (1-3)
surrendered five runs on seven hits while striking out one in
five innings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
