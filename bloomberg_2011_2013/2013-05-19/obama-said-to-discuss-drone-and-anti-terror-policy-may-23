President  Barack Obama  plans to
address his administration’s counterterrorism policies,
including the legality of drone attacks and his efforts to close
the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, in a speech next week,
according to an administration official.  The president will review threats the country faces and
legality of using drones to take actions against those threats,
said the official, who requested anonymity to preview the
president’s schedule. The speech, originally scheduled for
earlier this month, is slated for May 23, said the official.  Plans for the speech were reported earlier by the
Washington Post.  To contact the reporters on this story:
