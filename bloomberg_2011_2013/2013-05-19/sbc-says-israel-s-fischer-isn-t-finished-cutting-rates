Bank of Israel Governor Stanley Fischer, who last week unexpectedly cut the benchmark interest
rate to a three-year low, may not be done yet, according to
Jonathan Katz, an economist at  HSBC Holdings Plc. (HSBA)   The monetary policy committee may surprise investors again
as soon as next week with another another cut of 25 basis points
to 1.25 percent to drive home the message that they are
determined not to let the shekel appreciate excessively,
Jerusalem-based Katz said in a phone interview. Policy makers
next scheduled meeting is on May 27.  “There are no concerns regarding inflationary pressures,”
Katz said. “The global environment is looking soft, and we’ve
had a global loosening cycle. And if they don’t cut, the shekel
will react.”  Central banks overseeing about a quarter of the world’s
gross domestic product have cut interest rates this month,
spanning the globe from the euro area and  Australia  to Kenya and
 Turkey . Fischer, who is stepping down next month after eight-years, has gradually lowered the benchmark rate from 3.25
percent in 2011 to help spur growth in the export-driven
economy.  The shekel closed at 3.6670 against the dollar on May 17,
the last day it traded, compared with 3.5711 a week earlier,
before the Bank of Israel rate cut.  To contact the reporter on this story:
