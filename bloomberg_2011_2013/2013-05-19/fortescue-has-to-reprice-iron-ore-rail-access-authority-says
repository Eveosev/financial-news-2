Western  Australia ’s Economic
Regulation Authority asked  Fortescue Metals Group Ltd. (FMG) ,
Australia’s third-biggest iron ore exporter, to change its
pricing system after a company applied to use part of its rail.  Brockman Resources Ltd., developing the Marillana iron ore
deposit, last week applied to use the Perth-based company’s line
under a state third-party rail access code. Brockman’s ability
to ship ore along the rail is subject to availability and
commercial negotiations.  Fortescue has by today to define six pricing sections along
its more than 300 kilometers (186 mile) of rail in  Western
Australia ’s Pilbara region, the authority said in a May 17
statement on its website.  Iron ore companies in Australia’s sparsely populated
Pilbara region depend on access to rail and port facilities to
bring their product to market. BHP Billiton Ltd. and Rio Tinto
Group, Australia’s two biggest exporters, don’t allow other
groups to use their infrastructure. Under a Western Australia
state rail access code, companies can seek to ship on railways
built after 2000.  Brockman plans to use a section of Fortescue’s rail from
2016 to ship 20 million metric tons annually through the
proposed North West Infrastructure facilities at  Port Hedland ,
it said last week in a statement.  Fortescue last week said it welcomed talks for third-party
access on a commercial basis. Separately, the company is in
talks to sell non-controlling stakes in its port and rail assets
to cut debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
