Zimbabwe’s Movement for Democratic
Change party will reverse a law forcing foreign and white-owned
companies to sell 51 percent of their shares to black
Zimbabweans if it wins this year’s election, Prime Minister
 Morgan Tsvangirai  said.  “We will reverse indigenization laws and create new
empowerment laws for the majority of the people of Zimbabwe,”
Tsvangirai told party supporters at a rally held in the capital,
Harare, today.  Zimbabweans can’t “all share a small cake, so we’ll have
to create a bigger cake,” Tsvangirai said, referring to the
country’s economy.  Zimbabwe’s indigenization law has forced miners like  Anglo
American Platinum Ltd. (AMS)  and  Aquarius Platinum Ltd. (AQP)  to show how
they’ll sell or cede control to black Zimbabweans or the state’s
National Indigenization and Economic Empowerment Board. Banks
such as Barclays Plc,  Standard Chartered Plc (STAN)  and South Africa’s
Standard Bank Group Ltd. are also affected by the law.  The southern African nation is due to hold elections this
year, ending a five-year power-sharing agreement between
Tsvangirai’s MDC and President  Robert Mugabe ’s Zimbabwe African
National Union-Patriotic Front.  That agreement was brokered by the regional Southern
African Development Community after elections in 2008 were
marred by violence, mainly against MDC supporters.  To contact the reporter on this story:
