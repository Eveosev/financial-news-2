The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX) 
retreated from a record amid concern the Federal Reserve will
scale back its stimulus efforts. Gold and silver advanced as
Moody’s Investors Service warned the U.S. rating may be cut. The
yen rebounded from the weakest level since 2008.  The S&P 500 lost less than 0.1 percent to 1,666.29 as of 4
p.m. in New York after rising as much as 0.3 percent. The Stoxx
Europe 600 Index reached an almost five-year high and the U.K.’s
FTSE 100 Index closed at the strongest level since 2000. Silver
and gold reversed early losses as Moody’s said the U.S. may face
a downgrade in 2013 if a  federal budget  deal isn’t reached. The
yen added 0.9 percent to 102.27 per dollar.  Chicago  Fed President Charles Evans said today the U.S.
economy is “improving quite a lot” and growth should be self-sustaining in 2014. His remarks in a speech in Chicago triggered
speculation that the Fed will consider tapering its $85 billion
in monthly purchases of mortgage and Treasury securities.  “Keep in mind we are at all-time highs so even a moderate
cautious comment will be met with some selling,”  Larry Peruzzi ,
senior equity trader at Cabrera Capital Markets LLC in Boston,
wrote in an e-mail. “The markets have priced in employment
gains now and not in the future,” he said. “Investors are
looking for a reason to take profits.”  Global Rally  Global stocks have rallied in the past four weeks, boosting
market  capitalization  by $2.3 trillion and pushing the MSCI All-Country World Index to the highest level since 2008.  The S&P 500 reached records in 10 of the previous 12
sessions, extending its 2013 rally to 17 percent. The index has
jumped more than 146 percent from its bear-market low in 2009
amid the Fed’s bond purchases and earnings growth.  Investors will watch for clues to when the central bank may
begin tapering its asset purchases when Fed Chairman Ben S.
Bernanke testifies to a congressional committee on May 22, the
same day minutes from the Fed’s last meeting are released.  “The fundamentals are good enough that the market is going
to continue to go higher over the balance of the year,” Margie Patel, a senior fund manager at Wells Capital Management in
 Boston  who oversees about $1.5 billion, said in a telephone
interview. “Even talks about tapering last week didn’t cause
any wobble in the marketplace. That tells me that if we do see a
push-up in rates over the course of this year, when the Fed
reduces their purchases, it’s not going to have a material
effect.”  U.S. Stocks  Among U.S. stocks moving today, Cisco Systems Inc., Merck &
Co. and Coca-Cola Co. lost at least 1.2 percent to lead the Dow
Jones Industrial Average down 19.12 points to 15,335.28.  Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO)  rose 0.2 percent after agreeing to buy blogging
network Tumblr Inc. for about $1.1 billion. Actavis Inc. rallied
1.3 percent as it reached a deal to acquire  Warner Chilcott Plc ,
sending the target’s shares up 2 percent. Websense Inc. jumped
29, the most since 2003, to an almost two-year high after
agreeing to be bought by private-equity firm Vista Equity
Partners. Red Hat Inc. slipped 4.3 percent following an analyst
downgrade.  The most-indebted U.S. companies are gaining more than any
time in almost four years compared with the rest of the stock
market amid the broadest rally since at least 1995.  Fed  interest rates near zero  and the expanding economy are
allowing S&P 500 companies with the lowest working capital,
smallest earnings and highest debt ratios to reduce borrowing
costs and avoid default. The stocks surged 27 percent this year,
almost double the gains for businesses with the most cash and
least borrowing, according to data compiled by Bloomberg and
Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  Moody’s Warning  U.S. Treasuries were little changed, with the yield on the
10-year note up one basis point at 1.96 percent. U.S. policy
makers must address debt loads projected to rise later this
decade to avoid a 2013 downgrade, even as the latest budget
projections are “credit positive,” according to Moody’s.  The U.S. budget deficit will drop to $378 billion in 2015
from a record $1.4 trillion in 2009, according Congressional
Budget Office data. The federal government will post a $642
billion deficit this year, the first time in five years that the
shortfall has been less than $1 trillion. Moody’s said Sept. 11
that the U.S.’s top Aaa rating would likely be cut to Aa1 if an
agreement on the debt ratio isn’t reached.  “The fact that it showed much lower debt levels going
forward, we view as a positive development,” Steven Hess,
senior vice-president at Moody’s and based in New York, said
today in a telephone interview of the CBO forecast. “More needs
to be done on the policy front to address this rising debt
ratio.”  European Markets  The Stoxx 600 closed at the highest level since June 2008
as automobile and media companies led gains. Ryanair Holdings
Plc, Europe’s biggest discount airline, jumped 6.9 percent as
annual profit excluding one-time items climbed 13 percent to 569
million euros ($731 million), surpassing analyst estimates.
EasyJet Plc, Ryanair’s smaller rival, advanced 4 percent.  FirstGroup Plc plunged a record 30 percent after the U.K.
rail operator said it will raise about 615 million pounds ($935
million) in a rights offer to cut debt. The company said it
won’t pay a final dividend and Martin Gilbert will stand down as
chairman.  Italy’s 10-year bonds yielded 252 basis points more than
German bunds after the spread reached as little as 250 basis
points, the narrowest gap since Jan. 30.  Germany ’s 10-year bond
yield climbed five basis points to 1.38 percent. Spanish 10-year
bond yields were little changed at 4.20 percent. Markets in
Switzerland,  Austria ,  Denmark ,  Norway , Iceland and Luxembourg
were closed for the Whit Monday holiday.  Silver Reverses  Silver for July delivery added 1 percent to close at
$22.582 an ounce in New York after falling as much as 9.4
percent to $20.25, the least since September 2010. Gold futures
rose 1.4 percent to settle at $1,384.10 an ounce, halting a
seven-day slump and reversing an earlier loss of more than 2
percent.  “The Moody’s headline seems to have brought buyers to
precious metals,” Dave Lutz, the head of exchange-traded fund
trading and strategy at Stifel Nicolaus & Co. in Baltimore, said
in a telephone interview. “There was also massive short-covering after prices started rising” as traders unwound bets
on a slump, he said.  Hedge-fund managers are making the biggest ever bet against
gold as billionaire  George Soros  sold holdings last quarter and
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. predicted more declines after the
longest slump in four years.  The funds and other large speculators held 74,432 so-called
short  contracts  on May 14, U.S. Commodity Futures Trading
Commission data show. That’s the highest since the data begins
in June 2006 and compares with 67,374 a week earlier. The net-long position dropped 20 percent to 39,216 futures and options,
the lowest since July 2007. Net-bullish wagers across 18 U.S.-
traded raw materials rose 1.1 percent to 588,482, led by gains
in hogs, corn and cotton.  Natural Gas  Natural gas climbed 0.9 percent to $4.09 per million
British thermal units, the highest in almost three weeks, on
forecasts for above-normal temperatures that would boost demand
from power plants. The fuel also climbed after the U.S. last
week conditionally approved liquefied natural gas exports to
countries that don’t have free-trade agreements with the U.S.
from the Freeport project in  Texas .  The MSCI  Emerging Markets  Index added 0.2 percent and has
risen 5 percent from a five-month low on April 18. A report on
May 18 showed new home prices climbed in 68 out of 70 Chinese
cities tracked by the government.  China Resources Land Ltd. (1109)  and
 Guangzhou R&F Properties Co. (2777)  rallied in Hong Kong.  China ’s new
home prices rose in 68 of 70 cities in April with Beijing,
 Shanghai  and Guangzhou showing the biggest yearly gains.  Yen Climbs  The yen strengthened against all but two of its 16 major
peers, climbing most versus South Africa’s rand with a gain of
more than 1 percent. It added 0.6 percent to 131.77 per euro.
Europe’s 17-nation shared currency rose 0.5 percent to $1.2887,
snapping a seven-day drop.  Japan ’s Cabinet Office said the
domestic economy was picking up slowly and raised its assessment
of Europe for the first time since September 2010 after Economy
Minister Akira Amari said further yen weakness may hurt people’s
lives.  “It’s being said excessive yen gains have been corrected a
lot,” Amari said yesterday on public broadcaster NHK. “If the
yen extends losses a lot, people’s lives will be negatively
affected. It’s our job to minimize that.”  South Africa’s rand depreciated 0.3 percent against the
dollar, weakening for an eighth straight day, amid speculation
slowing inflation will give the nation’s Reserve Bank room to
lower borrowing costs, reducing the currency’s yield advantage.
New Zealand’s dollar climbed 1.4 percent to 81.74 U.S. cents
after the nation’s finance minister said home price gains will
pressure the central bank to raise interest rates.  The British pound strengthened 0.6 percent to $1.5259. U.K.
home sellers raised asking prices by 2.1 percent in May,
property-website operator Rightmove said today. That’s the fifth
month of gains and giving the market its best start to a year
since 2004.  To contact the reporters on this story:
