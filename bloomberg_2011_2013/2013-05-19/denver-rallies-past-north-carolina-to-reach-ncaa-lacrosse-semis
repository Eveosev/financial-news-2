The University of Denver overcame an
early six-goal deficit to beat the University of  North Carolina 
12-11 and reach the semifinals of the menâ€™s national college
lacrosse tournament.  The fourth-seeded Pioneers scored two goals in the last two
minutes to set up a meeting with No. 1 seed Syracuse on May 25.
The championship game is scheduled for two days later at Lincoln
Financial Field in Philadelphia.  Denver is in the semifinals for the second time in three
years as it chases a first National Collegiate Athletic
Association tournament win. Syracuse has claimed the title 10
times since 1983, most recently in 2008 and 2009.  Denver trailed 6-0 in the first quarter and 9-4 at halftime
against the fifth-seeded Tar Heels at Lucas Oil Stadium in
Indianapolis.  The Pioneers then outscored North Carolina 8-2 in the
second half. A goal by Eric Adamson tied it at 11-11 with one
minute, 31 seconds remaining in the fourth and Eric Law scored
with 13 seconds remaining to give Denver its only lead of the
game. Law scored three goals for the Pioneers and Wesley Berg
added four.  In the last quarterfinal matchup today, second-seeded  Notre
Dame  meets No. 7 Duke for the right to play Cornell.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
