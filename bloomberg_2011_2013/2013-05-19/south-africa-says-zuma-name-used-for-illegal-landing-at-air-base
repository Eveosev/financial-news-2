South Africa ’s government said
President  Jacob Zuma ’s name was used to illegally obtain rights
for a civilian Airbus plane to land at a military air base.  A government probe found South Africa’s head of state
protocol Bruce Koloane “colluded” with officials at the Indian
High Commission to grant the April 30 landing at the Waterkloof
Air Force base near Pretoria, Justice Minister  Jeff Radebe  told
reporters in the city today.  Zuma, whose son Duduzane is a director at the Guptas’
Sahara Computers and  Shiva Uranium , has said he had no role in
approving the use of the military facility and lower level
officials were to blame.  Authorities arrested 11 police officers and reservists, and
suspended five officials, including Koloane, three senior
military officers and a police major general.  To contact the reporter on this story:
