Keegan Bradley finished 54 holes at
13-under par 197 to lead by one stroke over  South Korea ’s Sang-Moon Bae going into the final round of the Byron Nelson
Championship.  Bradley carded a 2-under 68 yesterday at TPC Four Seasons
Resort in Irving, Texas, while Bae recorded a 4-under 66. Tom
Gillis is two off the lead after shooting a 3-under 67.  “I played really solid today, one of the most solid rounds
of the year, so I’m really excited,” Bradley told reporters.  If Bradley can stay atop the leaderboard through today’s
round, the 2011 champion will join  Tom Watson  (1980) and Mark
Hayes (1976) as the third wire-to-wire winner at this event.  A secondary cut after the third round reduced the field to
72 players, eliminating Chad Campbell, Pat Perez,  Vijay Singh 
and Tim Herron.  To contact the reporter on this story:
