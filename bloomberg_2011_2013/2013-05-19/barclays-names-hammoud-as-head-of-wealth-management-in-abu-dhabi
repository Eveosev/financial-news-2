Barclays Plc (BARC)  named Haidar Hammoud
head of wealth and investment management in Abu Dhabi as
Britain’s second-biggest lender seeks to tap high net-worth
individuals in the emirate, holder of about 6 percent of the
world’s oil.  Hammoud, previously at Deutsche Bank AG, Citibank, Standard
Chartered and BNP Paribas, will be in charge of wealth
management business in Abu Dhabi and provide advice to the so-called ultra-high net-worth market and large family offices,
Barclays said today in an e-mailed statement.  Banks such as Barclays consider the United Arab Emirates
and the wider Middle East as a long-term growth market where
economic expansion and high oil prices are driving prosperity.
Abu Dhabi is home to Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, one of the
world’s richest sovereign wealth funds. The emirate has Standard
& Poor’s third-highest investment grade.  Barclays may double the number of private bankers it has
across the Middle East and North Africa region, Rory Gilbert,
head of Middle East and North Africa at Barclays’s wealth
management unit, said in an interview last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
