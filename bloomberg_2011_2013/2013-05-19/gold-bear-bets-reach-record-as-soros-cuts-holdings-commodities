Hedge-fund managers are making the
biggest ever bet against gold as billionaire  George Soros  sold
holdings last quarter and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. predicted
more declines after the longest slump in four years.  The funds and other large speculators held 74,432 so-called
short  contracts  on May 14, U.S. Commodity Futures Trading
Commission data show. That’s the highest since the data begins
in June 2006 and compares with 67,374 a week earlier. The net-long position dropped 20 percent to 39,216 futures and options,
the lowest since July 2007. Net-bullish  wagers  across 18 U.S.-
traded  raw materials  rose 1.1 percent to 588,482, led by gains
in hogs, corn and cotton.  Gold prices that surged sixfold in the past 12 years fell
17 percent in 2013, including a seven-session slump through May
17 that was the longest since March 2009. Soros joined funds
managed by Northern Trust Corp. and BlackRock Inc. in cutting
holdings of exchange-traded products in the first quarter. ETP
assets are now at the lowest since July 2011 after some
investors lost faith in gold as a store of value amid improving
economic growth, low inflation and a rally in  equities .  “Gold has faced disappointment after disappointment,”
said  John Stephenson , a senior vice president and  fund manager 
who helps oversee about C$2.7 billion ($2.65 billion) at First
Asset Investment Management Inc. in Toronto. “It’s had a 12-year run, but the whole fear-mongering that the world is going
to end is just not working. So, I think that any last vestige of
an investment thesis for gold has been stripped.”  Prices Slump  Gold futures fell 5 percent to $1,364.70 an ounce on Comex
in  New York  last week. Prices slumped as Federal Reserve
regional bank presidents including  Richard Fisher  of  Dallas  and
 Charles Plosser  of Philadelphia called for a reduction of U.S.
monetary stimulus. Fisher and Plosser don’t hold a policy vote
this year. Seventeen analysts surveyed by Bloomberg expect
bullion to fall this week, with eight bullish and three neutral.  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot Index of 24 commodities
climbed 0.4 percent last week, and the MSCI All-Country World of
equities gained 1 percent. The dollar rallied 1.3 against a
basket of six major currencies. A Bank of America Corp. Index
shows Treasuries lost 0.2 percent. Gold futures for June
delivery climbed 1.4 percent to settle at $1,384.10 today.  Soros, Paulson  Soros Fund Management LLC lowered its  investment  in the
SPDR Gold Trust, the biggest bullion ETP, by 12 percent to
530,900 shares as of March 31, compared with three months
earlier, a Securities and Exchange Commission filing showed May
15. The reduction followed a 55 percent cut in the fourth
quarter last year. Paulson & Co., the top investor in the SPDR
fund, maintained a stake of 21.8 million shares, now valued at
$2.86 billion. Global ETP  holdings  slid 16 percent to 2,198.3
metric tons this year, valued at $95.7 billion.  Gold’s slump “has been faster than we expected,” Goldman
analysts led by  Jeffrey Currie  wrote in a May 14 report. A
further drop in ETP holdings would “continue to precipitate
this decline,” said the analysts, who forecast prices at $1,390
in 12 months. The metal will get “crushed” and trade at $1,100
in a year and below $1,000 in five years as inflation fails to
accelerate, Ric Deverell, the head of commodities research at
Credit Suisse Group AG, said in  London  on May 16.  Physical buying will help to support prices, said Paul Dietrich, the chief executive officer of Middleburg, Virginia-based Fairfax Global Markets, which oversees about $120 million.  India Premiums  Gold premiums in  India , the world’s biggest buyer, more
than doubled to $40 an ounce May 15 from $17 to $18 a day
earlier, according to Bachhraj Bamalwa, a director at the All
India Gems & Jewellery Trade Federation.  China ’s bullion demand
jumped to a record 294.3 tons in the first quarter, the World
Gold Council said in a report May 16.  Prices surged 53 percent since the end of 2008 as central
banks printed money on an unprecedented scale to boost growth.
The  Federal Reserve  is buying $85 billion of assets a month to
stimulate the world’s biggest economy, while  Japan  is making
monthly bond purchases of more than 7 trillion yen ($67.8
billion).  “The case for gold is still there,” Dietrich said. “All
the central banks are joining in a massive printing of money.
Physical demand may be helping provide a floor on prices, and
while there’s not a lot of downside risk right now to gold,
there is a lot of upside potential.”  Record Equities  Bullion fell in six of the past seven months. The  S&P 500
Index (SPX)  of equities reached a record May 17 as the dollar climbed
to the highest since July 2010 against six major currencies. The
U.S. consumer-price index fell for a second month in April,
government data showed May 16, and expectations for cost
increases, as measured by the break-even rate for 10-year
Treasury Inflation Protected Securities, reached the lowest
since August the next day.  Money managers withdrew $883 million from gold funds in the
week ended May 15, according to  Cameron Brandt , the director of
research for Cambridge, Massachusetts-based EPFR Global, which
tracks money flows. Total outflows from commodity funds were
$1.15 billion, according to EPFR.  Raw materials are returning to a “normal state” from a
“super cycle” for prices that saw “abnormal strength” in
returns, Goldman said in the May 14 report. Returns for
commodities as gauged by the S&P GSCI Enhanced Index will be 1.6
percent over 12 months. That’s down from an April 23 forecast of
2.5 percent.  Copper, Silver  Investors increased their bets on a rally for crude oil for
a third week to 205,140 futures and options, the CFTC data show.
The funds decreased wagers on declines for copper to 13,115
short contracts from 16,798 a week earlier. Silver  holdings 
tumbled 72 percent to 1,413, the lowest since speculators were
net-short on April 9.  A measure of speculative  positions  across 11 agricultural
products jumped 15 percent to 270,486 contracts, the highest
since March. Wagers on a corn rally increased 23 percent to
75,632 futures and options, a third straight gain. Cotton
holdings rose the most since January.  Cotton prices climbed 15 percent this year, the biggest
gain after natural gas among the 24 commodities tracked by S&P.
Dry weather will extend a drought pattern through May 22 in West
Texas, the top U.S. growing region, MDA Information Systems Inc.
said May 17. U.S. production will fall 19 percent this year, the
Department of Agriculture said May 10.  “Everything in the agricultural space depends on
weather,” said Paul Christopher, the chief international
strategist at Wells Fargo Advisors LLC in  St. Louis , which helps
manage $1.3 trillion. “There’s definitely a high probability of
more pain to come in gold. If the dollar can continue to gain on
the yen, I think we’ll continue to see people sell out of gold
and look for the dollar or U.S. stocks.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
