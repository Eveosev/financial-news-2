Duke University  and the University of
Denver both pulled out 12-11 wins to reach the semifinals of the
men’s national college lacrosse tournament.  Duke scored three straight fourth-quarter goals to upset
second-seeded  Notre Dame  yesterday, while Denver erased a 6-0
first-quarter deficit to beat North Carolina.  Seventh-seeded Duke (14-5) advances to play  Cornell
University  (14-3) in the first semifinal on May 25 in
Philadelphia. Fourth-seeded Denver (14-4) meets top-ranked
Syracuse (15-3) later that day for the second spot in the
national championship game, which is scheduled for May 27.  Duke is in the final four for the seventh straight year and
won its sole National Collegiate Athletic Association title in
2010. Cornell has won the tournament three times, most recently
in 1977, and Syracuse has been champion 11 times since 1983,
most recently in 2009. Denver is in the semifinals for the
second time in three years as it chases a first title.  Duke trailed 11-9 with nine minutes, 29 seconds left
yesterday before advancing on goals by Christian Walsh, Josh
Dionne and David Lawson, who scored the winner with 2:16 to
play. It was Lawson’s fifth goal of the game.  Denver trailed 6-0 in the first quarter and 9-4 at halftime
against fifth-seeded  North Carolina  before outscoring the Tar
Heels 8-2 in the second half.  The Pioneers scored twice in the last 91 seconds, including
Eric Law’s goal with 13 seconds to play to give Denver its only
lead of the game. Law scored three goals for the Pioneers and
Wesley Berg added four.  Cornell routed third-seeded Ohio State 16-6 and Syracuse
topped Yale 7-6 in the other quarterfinal games on May 18.  To contact the reporter on this story:
