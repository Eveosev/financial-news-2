Stuart Broad took seven wickets as
 England  won the first Test against New Zealand by 170 runs at
Lord’s Cricket Ground.  New Zealand collapsed for 68 runs in its second innings as
Broad, who claimed 7-44, and  James Anderson , who took 2-23, were
responsible for all the wickets. Neil Wagner was the visitors’
leading batsman with 17 runs.  It was the first time England only used two bowlers to bowl
out opposition since the 1930s. Broad was named man of the match
after his career-best performance.  “When he gets it right, like today, he’s a nightmare to
face,” England captain  Alastair Cook  said.  New Zealand was chasing 239 after bowling out England at
lunch for 213. Broad cut through the lineup, leaving the
visitors on 21-4 after 9.4 overs.  “The way England bowled and  Stuart Broad  bowled this
morning put a sense of panic in us,” New Zealand captain said.
Brendon McCullum said.  The visitors were trying to win their first Test series in
England since 1999, which is also the last time they won at
Lord’s. The two-match series continues at Leeds on May 24. The
teams drew 0-0 in their three-match series in New Zealand. They
also will play three one-day Internationals.  “I’m confident that we’ll find a way to play better than
today,” McCullum said. “We let ourselves down today.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
