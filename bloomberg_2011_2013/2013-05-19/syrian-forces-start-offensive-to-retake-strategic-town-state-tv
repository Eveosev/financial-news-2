Syrian government forces started an
offensive to retake the city of al-Qusair in Homs province from
rebels, state television reported today.  Government forces have entered the city, the official state
broadcaster said. Clashes continued on the outskirts of the
city, the Coventry, England-based Syrian Observatory for  Human
Rights  said on its Facebook page. The fighting killed 30 people,
including 16 rebel fighters, the group said.  Al-Qusair is located in Homs province near the highway
linking Damascus to the coast and has been a conduit for weapons
coming from Lebanon to rebels battling to topple President Bashar al-Assad. Government forces started seizing villages near
the city last month to regain control of territory along the
Lebanese border.  The army has built up its forces on three fronts around al-Qusair while leaving one clear for safe passage for fleeing
civilians and fighters who want to surrender, the  Associated
Press  said, citing an unidentified government official.
Government forces advanced into the town, taking over the
municipality building, AP said, citing the official.  Fighters from Lebanonâ€™s Shiite militia Hezbollah are
backing the government in the fight for al-Qusair, the Syrian
Observatory said today. Hezbollah and government forces have
suffered casualties, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
