The San Antonio Spurs rolled past the
 Memphis  Grizzlies 105-83 in the opening game of the National
Basketball Association’s Western Conference finals by setting a
postseason team-record with 14 three-pointers while limiting
Zach Randolph to two points.  Tony Parker scored 20 points and Kawhi Leonard added 18 for
the Spurs, who jumped out to a 17-point first-quarter lead
yesterday at the AT&T Center in San Antonio.  It’s the third straight Game 1 victory by the Spurs this
postseason, while the Grizzlies lost their third series-opener
in a row. Memphis beat the Los Angeles Clippers in the first
round after losing the first two games and then rallied to
defeat the Oklahoma City Thunder after a Game 1 loss.  “We shot the ball very well, but it’s just one game and
we’ll try to do the same thing in Game 2,” Parker said at a
news conference. “I’m sure they’ll make some adjustments.”  The Spurs will host Game 2 in the best-of-seven series
tomorrow. The Western Conference champion will play the
defending-champion Miami Heat or the Indiana Pacers in the NBA
Finals. The Eastern Conference finals start May 22 in Miami.  San Antonio hit 52.6 percent of its shots against Memphis,
including 14 of 29 three-point attempts. The Spurs outscored the
Grizzlies 42-15 from three-point range.  “When we shoot the ball like that, we’re pretty hard to
stop,” said Parker, who added nine assists.  Daniel Green added 16 points for the Spurs, hitting 3-of-6
three-point attempts, while Matt Bonner hit four three-point
shots for 12 points off the bench.  Quincy Pondexter had 17 points for the Grizzlies, who
trailed 31-14 after one quarter, and Marc Gasol added 15.
Randolph, who had 28 points and 14 rebounds on May 15 as Memphis
eliminated Oklahoma City, hit 1-of-8 shots and made his only
basket with 9 minutes, 26 seconds remaining.  “It was just one of those nights,” Randolph said. “A lot
of my shots were off. I didn’t get as good a look as I wanted
to. It was just the rhythm of the game. I’ve got to be better.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
