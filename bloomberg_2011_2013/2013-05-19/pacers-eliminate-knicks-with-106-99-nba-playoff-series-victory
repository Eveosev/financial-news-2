The  Indiana Pacers  beat the New York
Knicks 106-99 to advance to the conference finals against the
defending National Basketball Association champion Miami Heat.  The Pacers will open the best-of-seven Eastern Conference
series in Miami on May 22. The Western Conference finals between
the  Memphis Grizzlies  and  San Antonio Spurs  begin tonight.  “We’re down for another challenge,” Pacers Paul George

going to take this effort times two. We know how tough they are
in their house.”  Lance Stephenson scored 25 points and George added 23 for
the Pacers who reached the conference finals for the first time
in nine years.  “We have to stick to our principles -- defense first,”
George said.  Ahead 55-47 at the half, the Pacers surged to a 12-point
