Dubai’s benchmark stock  index (ADSMI)  rose
for a ninth day in its longest winning streak in more than two
years on investor optimism the emirate is recovering from a
property crash and restructuring debt. Abu Dhabi’s gauge gained.  Emaar Properties PJSC (EMAAR) , the developer of the world’s tallest
building, climbed the most since Feb. 24.  Dubai Islamic Bank
PJSC (DIB)  rose to the highest level since November 2008. The DFM
General  Index (TA-25)  advanced 2.5 percent to 2,352.21, the highest
close since October 2009. Today’s gain brought the surge this
quarter to 29 percent, making it the second best-performing

benchmark added 1.4 percent, led by real-estate companies.  Banks and property companies in Dubai, which is recovering
from the 2008 property crash, are rallying after a series of
debt restructurings. Dubai Group LLC, an investment company
owned by the emirate’s ruler, agreed this month on final terms
with its main creditors to restructure $6 billion. Islamic
mortgage provider  Amlak Finance PJSC (AMLAK)  is proposing to extend the
maturity on more than $2 billion of loans to creditors, two
people familiar with the plan said last week.  “It’s the growing good sentiment about Dubai in general
that is generating market momentum,” said Montasser Khelifi, a
Dubai-based senior manager for global markets at Quantum
Investment Bank Ltd. “We have seen also restructuring deals
that are about to be closed for Amlak and Dubai Group so that
adds to this good sentiment.”  Record Jump  Dubai’s economy is set to expand 4.6 percent annually, on
average, between 2012 and 2015, more than twice the growth of
the previous four years, according to government forecasts.  Dubai Islamic, the United Arab Emirates’ largest Shariah-compliant lender, gained 4.1 percent to 3.30 dirhams as trading
volume climbed to 3.5 times the three-month daily average. The
shares have surged  64 percent  this year.  Emaar rose 3.5 percent to 5.97 dirhams, bringing the
advance for the year to 59 percent. Emaar and Dubai Holding are
to resume work on Al Khiran, a project that was halted amid the
2008 crisis, Al Bayan newspaper reported today.  Abu Dhabi ’s ADX General Index increased to the highest
level since October 2008 as Sorouh Real Estate and  Aldar
Properties PJSC (ALDAR)  jumped 15 percent. Sorouh soared the most on
record as trading volumes surged to almost six times the three-month daily average. Aldar climbed the most since September
2005.  Saudi Arabia’s  Tadawul All Share Index (SASEIDX)  rose 1 percent at
