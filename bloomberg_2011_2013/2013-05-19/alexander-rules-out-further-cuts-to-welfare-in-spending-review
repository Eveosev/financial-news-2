Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny
Alexander has ruled out further cuts to welfare in the U.K.
government’s Spending Review next month.  “In the autumn statement last year we made 3.6 billion
pounds ($5.5 billion) of further reductions in welfare in
2015-16,” he told the  BBC ’s “Sunday Politics” program. “But
in the spending round that is now being conducted we’re looking
for a further 11.5 billion pounds of savings. That will come
from departmental expenditure. We’ve made welfare savings for
that year already, an extra 3.5 billion pounds just a few months
ago and we said then, and I say again now, that those were the
welfare decisions for 2015-16, the departmental spending
decisions are the ones that we’re now going to be making.”  He said the government was in a “better position than I
expected at this stage” in the process of cutting departmental
spending. “What I want to do in this spending round is deliver
better public services for less money, and that’s what we’re
working to achieve,” he said.  On the economy, Alexander said the U.K. was facing a
“very, very hard road.”  “It’s going to continue to be hard for a while, but at a
time when we’re seeing signs of progress that would be entirely
the wrong time to go back to scratch, to start again with an
economic strategy from scratch.  ‘‘Instead we’re going to stick to the plans that we’ve set
out, deliver the deficit reduction as we’ve set out, but also
reform our economy to help businesses grow and create jobs.’’  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
