Gold and silver futures rebounded
after Moody’s Investors Service said U.S. policy makers must
address debt woes to avoid a credit-rating downgrade this year,
boosting the appeal of the metals as a haven.  “More needs to be done on the policy front to address this
rising debt ratio,” said  Steven Hess , a senior vice president
at New York-based Moody’s. The ratio of debt to gross domestic
product will increase in the long term, according to the
 Congressional Budget Office . Earlier, gold fell as much as 2.1
percent, while silver plunged 9.4 percent.  “The Moody’s headline seems to have brought buyers to
precious metals,”  Dave Lutz , the head of exchange-traded fund
trading and strategy at Stifel Nicolaus & Co. in Baltimore, said
in a telephone interview. “There was also massive short-covering after prices started rising” as traders unwound bets
on a slump, he said.  Gold futures for June delivery gained 1.4 percent to settle
at $1,384.10 an ounce at 1:43 p.m. on the Comex in  New York .
Earlier, the price touched $1,336.30, the lowest for a most-active contract since April 18. The metal dropped in the
previous session sessions, the longest slump in four years.  On Aug. 8, 2011, gold rose 3.7 percent to a record at the
time after  Standard & Poor’s  cut the U.S. credit rating that
month.  Holdings in exchange-trade products backed by the precious
metal surged by $1.7 billion in 10 minutes today as futures
rallied. Assets at 2,198.3 metric tons on May 17 were the lowest
since July 2011.  Mideast Tensions  Escalating tensions in the  Middle East , a drop by the
dollar against major currencies and “barging hunting” boosted
gold and silver,  David Meger , the director of metal trading at
Vision Financial Markets in  Chicago , said in a telephone
interview.  Silver futures for July delivery advanced 1 percent to
close at $22.582 an ounce on the Comex. Earlier, the price
touched $20.25, the lowest since Sept. 14, 2010. Trading was 70
percent higher than the 100-day average, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Electronic trading in the July contract, the most-active,
was halted four times in 20-second increments between 5:07 p.m.
and 5:10 p.m. Chicago time yesterday after prices “sold off
sharply,” Damon Leavell, a spokesman for CME Group Inc.’s
Comex, said today in an e-mail.  This year, silver has slumped 25 percent and gold dropped
17 percent this year as some investors have lost faith in
precious metals as a store of value amid improving economic
growth, low inflation and the rally in equities.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , palladium futures for
June delivery rose 1.4 percent to $750.75 an ounce. Earlier, the
price reached $754.95, the highest since April 3. Trading more
than doubled compared with the 100-day average.  Platinum futures for July delivery advanced 1.1 percent to
$1,484.60 an ounce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
