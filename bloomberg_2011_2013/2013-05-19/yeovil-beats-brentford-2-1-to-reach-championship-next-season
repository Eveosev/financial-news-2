Yeovil won promotion to English
soccer’s Championship for the first time with a 2-1 defeat of
Brentford in the League One playoff final at Wembley Stadium.  Yeovil got first-half goals from Paddy Madden and Dan Burn
yesterday and held off Brentford, which got a goal back in the
first six minutes of the second half from Harlee Dean. Yeovil
goalkeeper Marek Stech was named man of the match after denying
Brentford as it pushed for a tying goal.  Yeovil finished fourth in League One, two points behind
Brentford in third. London-based Brentford missed a penalty kick
in the final match against Doncaster that would have locked up
second place and automatic promotion. Yeovil beat Brentford
twice in the league this season.  “It’s a great achievement,” Yeovil manager Gary Johnson
said. “This is a small club with a small budget, but this is
what you can do with high ambitions.”  Johnson led the Somerset club to automatic promotion to
League Two and League One when he ran Yeovil between 2001 and
2005. He then moved to Bristol City and returned to Yeovil in
January 2012, when the club was facing relegation.  Doncaster and Bournemouth won automatic promotion from
League One this season and will join the Championship, one level
below the Premier League.  To contact the reporter on this story:
