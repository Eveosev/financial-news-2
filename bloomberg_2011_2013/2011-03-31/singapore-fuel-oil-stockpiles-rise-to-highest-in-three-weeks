Singaporeâ€™s stockpiles of residues,
or  fuel oil , rose to the highest in three weeks, data from a
unit of the Ministry of Trade and Industry show.  Onshore inventories of residues, including fuel oil and
low-sulfur waxy residue and excluding bitumen, gained 0.7
percent to 18.6 million barrels in the seven days to March 30,
 International Enterprise Singapore  said in an e-mailed statement
today. Supplies were at 18.9 million in the week to March 9.  Stockpiles of middle distillates, including gasoil and
kerosene, rose 5.4 percent to 13.4 million barrels. Inventories
of light distillates such as naphtha, reformate and gasoline
gained 2.1 percent to 12.1 million barrels.  Inventories of all categories fell from a month earlier
after refiners shut units for repairs. Exxon Mobil Corp. is
resuming maintenance at most of the units at its Jurong refinery
in  Singapore  after a one-day stoppage at the complex because of
the death of a worker, the company said March 29. The company
shut the facility on March 9 for a planned turnaround.  Royal Dutch Shell Plc declared force majeure on some
Singapore chemical deliveries because of unplanned operational
issues at its Pulau Bukom ethylene plant, the company said in an
e-mailed statement on March 21. Force majeure is a legal clause
allowing companies to miss deliveries because of circumstances
beyond their control.  The trade ministry surveys refiners,  oil companies  and
storage terminals on a voluntary basis. The results may exclude
some offshore storage capacity, International Enterprise said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
