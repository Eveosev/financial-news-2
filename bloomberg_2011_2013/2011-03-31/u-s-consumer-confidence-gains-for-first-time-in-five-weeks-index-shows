Consumer confidence  in the U.S.
rose for the first time in five weeks as Americans said their
finances were in better shape.  The Bloomberg Consumer  Comfort Index  improved to minus 46.9
in the period ended March 27 from a seven-month low of minus
48.9 the prior week. Readings this low are historically seen
during recessions, according to  Gary Langer , president of Langer
Research Associates LLC in New York, which compiles the index
for Bloomberg.  A strengthening job market may help consumers overcome
strains from the highest gasoline prices in more than two years
and rising grocery bills. At the same time, sentiment soured for
a fourth consecutive week among those making more than $100,000
a year, indicating continued drops in home values and swings in
stock prices are rattling wealthier households.  “It’s a mixed bag out there,” said George Mokrzan, senior
economist at Huntington National Bank in Columbus,  Ohio , “The
income rises and job growth are the major drivers at this point,
so in general the consumer can withstand some higher prices.”  Another report today showed business activity expanded at a
faster pace than forecast in March, signaling manufacturing
remains a driver of growth in the world’s largest economy. The
Institute for Supply Management-Chicago Inc. said its business
barometer fell to 70.6 this month from February’s 71.2 reading
that was the highest since July 1988.  2010 Average  The Bloomberg Comfort Index, with records dating back to
December 1985, fell to a record low of minus 54 in November
2008, while the peak of 38 was reached in January 2000. Readings
averaged minus 45.7 last year.  Last week’s results reflected gains for two of the three
components.  The measure of personal finances rose to minus 1.1 from
minus 5.5, the report showed. Fifty percent of those polled held
positive views on their financial situation, up from 47 percent
the previous week. Last week was the second time the share has
been at 50 percent or higher since January 2010.  The buying-climate index increased to minus 53.1 from minus
55.1. Those saying it was a good time to buy needed items held
at 23 percent.  Consumers’ views on the economy turned more grim as that
component fell to minus 86.5 last week, the lowest level since
April 2009, from minus 86 the prior week. The share of
households with a positive view of the economy held at 7
percent.  Gasoline’s Influence  “With gasoline prices continuing to surge, public ratings
of economic conditions remain well below the levels typically
associated with growth,” Langer said in a statement.
“Consumers may be questioning the recovery’s strength and
durability alike.”  As home values recede toward the lowest levels since the
last expansion began at the end of 2001, the drop in wealth may
cause  consumer spending , which accounts for 70 percent of the
economy, to cool.  Residential real estate prices dropped in the 12 months
ended January by the most in more than a year. The S&P/Case-
Shiller index of property values in 20 cities fell 3.1 percent
from January 2010, the group said this week. Eighteen of the 20
cities in the index showed a year-over-year decline, and prices
in 11 markets dropped to fresh lows from their 2006, 2007 peaks,
the same as in December.  Share Prices  Swings in the stock market may also weigh on the outlooks
of those earning more than $100,000 a year in income. The
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 6.4 percent from Feb. 18 to
March 16 and has since climbed 5.7 percent to close yesterday in
 New York  at 1,328.26.  The comfort reading for those making $100,000 dropped to
minus 14 last week, the lowest level since October, from minus
13.8.  Today’s report showed the strengthening labor market is
doing little to lift the moods of those with jobs. The
confidence index for Americans working full time fell to minus
39.8 last week, the lowest level since August, from 38.4, while
it increased for those who were unemployed.  A report from the Labor Department today showed the number
of Americans applying for  unemployment insurance  fell by 6,000
to 388,000 in the week ended March 26. The number of people
continuing to receive benefits dropped to the lowest level since
October 2008.  More Jobs  Economists project a Labor Department report tomorrow will
show employers added 190,000 workers to payrolls in March and
the jobless rate held at 8.9 percent.  While the labor market improves and incomes gain, Americans
are paying more for staples, and costs may climb further in the
next few months. The average price of regular gasoline at the
pump was $3.61 a gallon on March 29, the highest since September
2008, according to AAA, the nation’s biggest motoring
organization.  Price increases have not yet offset demand for  consumer
goods . Same-store sales at  Macy’s Inc. (M) , the second-largest U.S.
department to chain, rose 5.8 percent in February, compared with
the 3.7 percent average gain from analysts’ estimates compiled
by Retail Metrics Inc.  Still, retailers are watching how inflation affects sales,
according to  Terry Lundgren , Macy’s chairman, president and
chief executive officer.  Inflation Pressures  “There’s just no question about it, and there’s no way
around” inflation pressures, Lundgren said during a March 29
conference call with analysts. “If we get by 2 percent or 3
percent inflation, it’s not a bad thing. As long as the product
has demand to it, the price impact so far has not been
negative.”  The Bloomberg Consumer Comfort Index is based on responses
to telephone interviews with a random sample of 1,000 consumers
aged 18 and over. Each week, 250 respondents are asked for their
views on the economy, personal finances and buying climate; the
percentage of negative responses is subtracted from the share of
positive views and divided by three. The most recent reading is
based on the average of responses over the previous four weeks.  Field work for the index is done by SSRS/Social Science
Research Solutions in Media,  Pennsylvania .  To contact the reporter on this story:
