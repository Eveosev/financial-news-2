Southern African Development
Community nations are “hungry” for foreign direct investment
as the region seeks to lift economic growth and ultimately
improve the lives of its people, South African Deputy President
Kgalema Motlanthesaid.  South Africa , the continent’s largest economy, is “only
too happy to welcome” investment into the country, he said at
Sustaining South Africa’s Growth, a conference hosted by The
Chicago Council on Global Affairs, in the city today.
“Mutually beneficial partnerships with strategic partners, like
the  United States ,” will help improve the country’s prosperity,
he said.  While the economy has been expanding, it has not been
enough to “make a serious dent on the problem of
unemployment,” Motlanthe said. South Africa has set aside a
trillion rand for investment in infrastructure, he said in the
speech, without saying over what period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
