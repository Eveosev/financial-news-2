Finland’s Treasury said the gross
borrowing need for this year will remain at “just below” 28
billion euros ($40.5 billion), according to a statement.  “As of today, 67 percent of the estimated long-term
borrowing has been completed,” the Treasury said in a quarterly
review today. “The slight front-loading of funding activities
is due to the redemption profile of Finnish government debt this
year.”  Finland is planning to arrange what is “likely” to be new
five-year benchmark bond in the second half of the year, the
Treasury said. The country will also hold one more euro
benchmark bond auction in the third or fourth quarter, the
agency said.  The Treasury said it will not issue bills in July due to
the “holiday season.”  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
