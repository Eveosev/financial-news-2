Research In Motion Ltd. (RIMM) , whose
BlackBerry smartphone first caught on with corporate customers,
is drawing interest for its PlayBook tablet from developers of
consumer applications, including games and magazines.  The device will come preloaded with programs such as
“Tetris,” the building-block puzzle game, and the Kobo e-book
reader. Sports fans will also be able to browse an online
version of  Pro Football Weekly  magazine.  RIM, which hasn’t had as much success as  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  or
 Google Inc. (GOOG)  in drawing independent developers to create consumer
apps for the BlackBerry, is trying to gain ground with the
PlayBook, which goes on sale April 19. The tablet will have a
new operating system, a dual-core processor, and the capability
to play applications for Google’s Android platform.  “It’s one of the fastest devices out there,” said Travis
Boatman, senior vice president at  Electronic Arts Inc. (ERTS) , the
second-largest video-game publisher. “You take a good software
environment and great hardware, you’ve got a device that
designers and developers can create great content on.”  The  Redwood City , California-based company will release
“Tetris” and “Need for Speed Undercover,” a car racing game,
on the PlayBook.  RIM is debuting the PlayBook as it tries to combat market
share losses in the smartphone business to Apple and companies
that use Android, including Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc. RIM
may sell 250,000 PlayBooks in its fiscal first quarter which
began Feb. 27, and 5.4 million over the fiscal year, said Alkesh Shah, an analyst with Evercore Partners Inc.  Android Initiative  While RIM shares have climbed 17 percent since the PlayBook
was unveiled Sept. 27, the stock slid 11 percent Mar. 25 after
the company said it will spend more to develop and market the
PlayBook, a lower-margin device than the company’s overall
product range. RIM fell 49 cents to $56.54 at 4 p.m.  New York 
time in Nasdaq Stock Market trading.  RIM is opening the PlayBook to Android apps to give
customers a wider range of choices. There are more than 150,000
apps in the Android Market, compared with more than 25,000 in
BlackBerry App World and more than 350,000 in Apple’s  App Store .  Software tools for making Android apps work on the PlayBook
will be available this summer, said Tyler Lessard, who heads up
RIM’s developer relations.  “We wanted to make sure as quickly as possible that
customers would have access to a huge catalog of apps,” Lessard
said in an interview.  ‘More Compelling Tablet’  Android is the world’s fastest-growing smartphone platform
and is also gaining tablet market share. Android tablets
captured 22 percent of global shipments in the three months to
Dec. 31, up from 2.3 percent in the preceding quarter, according
to  Strategy Analytics . The iPad’s share dropped to 75 percent of
shipments from about 95 percent three months earlier, it said.  Android compatibility, the new operating system and steps
RIM has taken to speed up app development will attract more
developers and lift the PlayBook’s appeal, said Shah.  “Developers really struggled to create apps for
BlackBerrys” before, said Shah, who is based in New York. He
rates RIM “overweight.” “The ability for developers to port
Android makes it a more compelling tablet.”  Developers should still create programs for the PlayBook to
make the most of its multimedia performance and ensure their
apps work as well as possible, Lessard said.  “We’re still very focused on working closely with
developers on building specifically for the BlackBerry
PlayBook,” he said. “However if they have existing  Android
apps  and if that helps as a stepping stone to getting an app out
there on the PlayBook then that’s great.”  Late to Game  “Dozens” of games for the PlayBook will be released this
year through Unity Technologies’s Union game development tool,
said Brett Seyler, Union’s general manager.  “RIM knows it’s late to the game but they’re doing some
really smart things in terms of building multimedia capability
and adding Android” to the PlayBook, said Seyler. The San
Francisco-based company hadn’t previously developed for the
BlackBerry platform, which was “pretty handicapping” for game
developers, he said.  While there may be a temptation for developers of simpler
apps to just port from Android, “pretty much all game
developers” will build their apps natively because games are so
taxing on device hardware, he said.  Cultivating PlayBook apps for consumers is a priority for
RIM even if the device appears a natural fit for lawyers,
bankers and other BlackBerry users, said Lessard.  Targeting the Consumer  “We are absolutely targeting the consumer, personal apps
market as much if not more because there is such a vast market
out there,” said Lessard. “Whether you’re a business
professional or individual consumer, the personal aspect of
these devices is apparent.”  Polar Mobile , a Toronto-based developer of apps for
magazines including Time, GQ and Sports Illustrated, is building
over 100 PlayBook apps including Pro Football Weekly, that will
be ready in July, said Polar CEO Kunal Gupta.  RIM wants to prove wrong Apple CEO  Steve Jobs , who said
last year that smaller devices like the seven-inch (18-
centimeter) PlayBook will be “dead on arrival” as they don’t
have the screen size to compete with the 9.7-inch iPad.  PlayBook’s size and usage makes it a compelling alternative
to the iPad to develop for, said Gupta.  “Portability is higher so people are pulling it out more
often and referencing apps, and that drives consumer
engagement,” said Gupta. “It’s a huge advantage.”  Apple has sold more than 15 million iPads in the past year,
and shipped about 500,000 of the new edition iPad 2, over its
March 11 debut weekend, analysts estimated.  That leaves RIM with a lot of catching up to do in building
a tablet ecosystem, said Brian O’Connor, director of technology
for  Universal Mind , a San Francisco-based company that built the
Fantasy Football game for the PlayBook.  “Keeping up with developer demands will be one of their
biggest challenges,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
