Kazakhstan  plans to boost output of
fertilizer almost 12-fold through 2014, the government said.  Production will expand to 3 million metric tons in 2014
from 257,000 tons this year, according to Industry and New
Technologies Ministry plans published today in  Kazakhstanskaya
Pravda , the official state newspaper. Output will be 1 million
tons in 2013, and rise to 3.01 million tons in 2015, it said.  EuroChem,  Russia â€™s largest mineral fertilizer producer,
said in 2008 it planned to spend $2.5 billion on a phosphorus
mine and three plants in Kazakhstan to expand fertilizer output.  To contact the reporter on this story:
