David Sokol , who resigned from
 Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A)  yesterday amid disclosures about his
stock trading in a company he identified as a takeover target,
said he had no authority over Berkshire’s investments.  Sokol said today in an interview on CNBC television that he
had “no authority whatsoever.” “I couldn’t spend a dollar of
Berkshire’s money buying a security,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
