Security forces loyal to  Ivory Coast ’s
incumbent leader Laurent Gbagbo have lifted the blockade of the
Golf Hotel in the commercial capital, Abidjan, headquarters of
internationally recognized President-elect Alassane Ouattara,

United Nations mission in the West African country.  Forces loyal to Gbagbo remained near the presidential
palace and Gbagbo’s residence, AFP said.  To contact the reporter on this story: Jason McLure in Accra on
