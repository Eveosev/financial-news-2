PT Pertamina,  Indonesia ’s state-
owned oil and gas company, will increase imports of subsidized
gasoline to meet rising demand during the holiday season
starting in June.  Imports of RON 88 gasoline will rise to 6 million barrels
in June from 5 million planned in April, Marketing Director
Djaelani Sutomo told reporters in Jakarta today. Diesel imports
may reach 4 million barrels next month, he said, without
providing a figure for June.  Fuel demand typically rises at the start of June through
July, coinciding with the mid-year school break in the world’s
fourth-most populous country. Consumption will increase because
“many people will be traveling during the holiday season,”
Sutomo said.  Indonesia,  Southeast Asia ’s largest crude producer, turned
into net importer after declining output at aging fields led to
the country’s withdrawal from the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries in 2008.  Java island accounts for about 70 percent of the country’s
subsidized fuel consumption, according to Evita Legowo, director
general of oil and gas at the energy ministry.  In March, Pertamina imported 5 million barrels of RON 88
gasoline and 4 million barrels of diesel, Sutomo said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
