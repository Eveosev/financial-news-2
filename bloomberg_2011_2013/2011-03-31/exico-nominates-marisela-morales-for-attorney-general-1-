Mexican President Felipe Calderon
nominated Marisela Morales as attorney general to replace Arturo Chavez Chavez, who resigned today.  The appointment of Morales, who was head of the organized
crime unit of the federal attorney general’s office, will be
subject to the Senate’s approval, Calderon said to reporters in
Mexico City. Deputy Attorney General Jorge Alberto Lara will be
in charge of the government agency until the Senate approves
Morales’ nomination, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
