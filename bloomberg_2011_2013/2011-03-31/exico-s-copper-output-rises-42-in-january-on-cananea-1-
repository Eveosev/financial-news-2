Mexico ’s copper production rose 42
percent from a year earlier to 26,891 metric tons in January
after Grupo Mexico SAB, the country’s largest mining company,
ramped up output at its Cananea mine.  Silver output rose 16 percent to 268,612 kilograms (9.48
million ounces) in January, the National Statistics Agency said
today in a statement in its website. Gold production jumped 25
percent to 5,614 kilograms, the agency said.  Union workers at Cananea, the world’s largest deposit of
copper, were striking on and off for about three years. Grupo
Mexico resumed operations at the mine last summer. The company
aims to produce as much as 450,000 tons of copper annually at
Cananea after five years.  To contact the reporters on this story: Carlos M. Rodriguez in
