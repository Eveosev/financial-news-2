Millicom International Cellular
SA (MICC) ’s Rwandan unit was offered a license to operate a money-
transfer service, the Daily Nation reported, citing Tongai
Maramba, the company’s product manager.  The company, known as Tigo Rwanda, will be the second
mobile operator to start the service after  MTN Group Ltd. (MTN) ’s
subsidiary in the the East African nation began offering it in
February 2010, the Nairobi-based newspaper said.  A license application by Rwandatel, a Libyan-owned company,
is still pending, the newspaper said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
