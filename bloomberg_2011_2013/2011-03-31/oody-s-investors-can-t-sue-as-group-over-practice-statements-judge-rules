Moody’s Corp. (MCO)  investors can’t sue
as a class over claims the company made false statements to
investors about its credit-rating practices, a judge ruled.  U.S. District Judge George B. Daniels in New York today
said that the question of whether investors relied on allegedly
false statements by Moody’s involves too many individual issues
to try all the claims in one case.  “Plaintiffs are unable to satisfy their burden of proving
that common questions of reliance predominate and class
certification must be denied,” Daniels wrote.  The investors claim Moody’s misled them about a conflict of
interest in the company’s “issuer-pays” business model,
causing their shares to drop in value when claims of
artificially inflated ratings became public.  The lead plaintiffs in the case, Teamsters Local 282
Pension & Trust Fund and two individual investors, had asked
Daniels to certify as a class all purchasers of Moody’s common
stock from Feb. 3, 2006, to Oct. 24, 2007.  “We don’t agree with it,” Peter Binkow, one of the
lawyers representing Moody’s investors, said of today’s
decision. He declined to comment further, saying he and his co-
counsel are reviewing the ruling.  The case is In re Moody’s Corp. Securities Litigation,
07-cv-08375, U.S. District Court, Southern District of  New York 
( Manhattan ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
