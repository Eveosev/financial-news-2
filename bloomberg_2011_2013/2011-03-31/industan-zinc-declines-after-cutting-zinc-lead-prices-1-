Hindustan Zinc Ltd. (HZ) ,  India ’s
largest producer of the metal, fell to its lowest level in a
week in Mumbai trading after cutting prices.  The shares fell as much as 2 percent to 135.1 rupees, the
lowest since March 24, and traded at 136.45 rupees as of 12.01
p.m. The benchmark Sensitive Index of the Bombay Stock Exchange
gained 1.1 percent.  Hindustan Zinc lowered zinc prices by 1 percent to 120,400
rupees a metric ton and lead prices by 1.2 percent to 137,900
rupees a ton from today, according to the
company’s website.  “The share prices are adjusting to the changes in the base
metal prices,” said  Niraj Shah , a senior vice-president
at Fortune Equity Brokers Ltd. in Mumbai. “Zinc prices may
remain weak as demand for steel will be subdued.” Shah has a
“buy” rating for Hindustan Zinc shares.  Prices of zinc, used to protect steel from rusting, have
fallen 3.6 percent in the past week on the  London  Metal Exchange.
The metal traded 0.3 percent down at $2,332 a ton as of 6:55 a.m.
in London.  India’s steel consumption fell for the second consecutive
month in December and increased 1.2 percent in January, data
from the ministry showed. Demand grew 7.2 percent in the April-
to-January period, compared with a government forecast of 10
percent for the year ending today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
