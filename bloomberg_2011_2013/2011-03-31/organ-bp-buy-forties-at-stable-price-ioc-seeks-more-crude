BP Plc and Morgan Stanley bought
 North Sea  Forties crude at prices little changed from yesterday.
India Bharat Petroleum Corp. bought Nigerian Qua Iboe oil from
Morgan Stanley, and Indian Oil Corp. is seeking more crude.  North Sea  BP bought one shipment of Forties for loading April 12 to
April 14 from Total SA at 20 cents above benchmark Dated Brent,
according to a survey of traders and brokers monitoring the
daily Platts trading window. Morgan Stanley bought another cargo
for April 17 to April 19 from Trafigura Beheer BV at the same
premium, the survey showed.  Reported North Sea market activity typically occurs during
the Platts window that ends at 4:30 p.m. in London. Prior to the
window, Forties loading 10 to 21 days in the future cost 19
cents more than Dated Brent yesterday, compared with a premium
of 22 cents March 29, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Brent for May settlement traded at $116.87 a barrel on the
London-based ICE Futures  Europe  exchange at the close of the
window, up from $115.23 yesterday. The June contract was at
$116.75, 12 cents below May.  No bids or offers were placed for Russian Urals in
northwest Europe for the third day. The grade was assessed at
$3.91 a barrel below Dated Brent today, unchanged from
yesterday, the Bloomberg data showed.  BG Group Plc, the U.K’s third-largest natural gas producer,
said its North Sea Everest and Lomond fields will resume output
“within a few weeks.”  The share of North Sea Buzzard crude in the Forties oil
blend fell to 26 percent in the week to March 27, from 31
percent a week earlier, BP Plc said today on its website.  Mediterranean  Petraco Oil Co. failed to sell 140,000 metric tons of Urals
loading for April 17 to April 21 in the Mediterranean even after
it lowered the offer by 10 cents to $3.20 a barrel less than
Dated Brent, the survey showed.  Eni SpA sought to buy 80,000 tons of Urals for April 14 to
April 18 at $3.40 below Dated Brent without success, while Vitol
Group withdrew its earlier offer for the same volume for April
17 to April 21 at a discount of $3.10 to the benchmark,
according to the survey.  OAO Surgutneftegaz sold 100,000 tons of Urals crude for
loading April 13 to April 14 from the Baltic Sea port Primorsk
to Repsol YPF SA through a spot tender, according to three
traders who participate in the market.  West Africa  Bharat Petroleum,  India ’s second-largest state-run oil
refiner, bought about 2 million barrels of  Nigeria ’s Qua Iboe
crude for loading in May from Morgan Stanley, three people who
participate in the market said today.  Indian Oil Corp., the country’s biggest refiner, issued its
fourth spot tender for May-loading crude and the first one for
June, official documents obtained by Bloomberg News show. Both
tenders will be awarded April 7.  Two Congo’s N’Kossa shipments for May loading and one Djeno
cargo for May 9 to May 10 were sold at unknown prices, according
to traders involved in the transactions of the region’s oil.  For Angola crude, only Dalia and Kissanje shipments are
available, and the rest were sold, they said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
