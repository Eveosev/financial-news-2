European stocks declined, halting a
six-day winning streak, as the European Union’s statistics
office reported that inflation unexpectedly accelerated to the
fastest pace in more than two years in March. Asian shares
rallied, while U.S. futures were little changed.  Hennes & Mauritz AB slumped 3.6 percent after saying first-
quarter profit fell.  Taylor Wimpey Plc  rose 2.8 percent after
agreeing to sell its North American units for $955 million to
cut debt and buy U.K. land. Tate & Lyle Plc jumped 3.6 percent
to the highest price in a month.  The benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 Index slid 0.5 percent to
277.14 at 11:10 a.m. in  London . Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
futures expiring in June climbed less than 0.1 percent to
1,324.1. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index jumped 0.7 percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
