Avusa Ltd. (AVU)  unit Universal Hirt &
Carter may be one of three shareholders backing a takeover bid
led by Capitau Holdings Ltd., Business Day said, citing a person
familiar with the transaction.  UHC, which holds a 16.5 percent stake in Avusa after being
bought by the South African media company last year, joins
 Coronation Fund Managers Ltd. (CML)  and  Mvelaphanda Group Ltd. (MVG)  in
supporting the transaction, the Johannesburg-based newspaper
said. A statement may be issued by the company later today, it
said.  Kagiso Fund Managers, which has a 12.5 percent stake in
Avusa, is not backing Capitau’s bid because it isn’t high
enough, Business Day said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
