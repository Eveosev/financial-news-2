Nippon Yusen K.K., Asia’s largest
listed shipping line, has been hit by production halts at quake-
stricken Japanese automakers including Toyota Motor Corp.,
Nissan Motor Co. and Honda Motor Co.  “There’s been an extremely sharp drop in shipments,”
Yasumi Kudo, the Tokyo-based line’s president, told reporters in
 Tokyo  today. “We’re probably going to see further declines for
the near future.”  Nippon Yusen has forecast a return to profit in the year
ending today, partly driven by a 30 percent jump in vehicle
shipment volume to 3.1 million.  Japan ’s three largest carmakers
have cut production by about 242,000 units, according to figures
from the companies, after a March 11 earthquake and tsunami
triggered shortages in power, parts and raw materials.  Kudo said the company isn’t predicting a change in earnings
from the plunge in car shipments and business disruptions caused
by the earthquake. The company has forecast profit will be 50
billion yen ($600 million) in the year starting tomorrow.  Nippon Yusen will boost its car carrier fleet to 130 ships
over the next six years, from a predicted 115 vessels currently,
as it forecasts demand for car shipments will increase 5 percent
annually, according to a statement from the company.  Nippon Yusen rose 0.3 percent to 325 yen at the 3 p.m.
close of trading on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. It has fallen 9.7
percent this year compared with a 4.6 percent decline in the
Nikkei 225 Stock Average.  To contact the reporters on this story:
