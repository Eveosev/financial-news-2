Wachovia Corp., the bank later
acquired by  Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC) , carried a $29 billion balance at
the  Federal Reserve ’s discount window over two days in October
2008 as the industry’s use of the program hit a record.  As clients withdrew money and investors refused to lend,
Wachovia borrowed $29 billion on Oct. 6 and then on Oct. 8
repaid $11 billion and took out another $7 billion, according to
Fed documents released today in response to a Freedom of
Information Act request. Borrowing from the Fed’s discount
window, its oldest lending program, rose to a record $111
billion in the week ended Oct. 29, 2008.  “During the financial crisis and prior to the Wells Fargo
merger while still an independent company, Wachovia borrowed and
repaid funds from the discount window,”  Mary Eshet , spokeswoman
for San Francisco-based Wells Fargo, said in a phone interview.  The documents provide the most detailed view yet of banks
that relied on the Fed’s primary lending program as markets and
funding seized up after Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. failed.
Wachovia agreed in principle to sell itself to  Citigroup Inc. (C)  on
Sept. 29, before deciding less than a week later to be acquired
instead by Wells Fargo in a deal that created the fourth-largest
U.S. bank. Wells Fargo completed the Wachovia purchase on Dec.
31, 2008.  The Oct. 6 borrowing included $23 billion in loans set to
mature Jan. 2, 2009, and $6 billion that would mature Nov. 4,
2008, according to the documents. The Oct. 8 loan was set to
mature Nov. 4, the Fed data show.  Outstanding Loans  On Oct. 29, $15 billion of the loans were still
outstanding, the Fed documents show. Wachovia held $3 billion
set to mature Nov. 4, and another $12 billion set to mature Jan.
2, 2009. By the end of November, Wachovia had repaid all the
loans, Fed documents show.  Earlier this year, the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission
released a previously secret November 2008 presentation by
regulators showing that  Charlotte , North Carolina-based Wachovia
borrowed $29 billion from the discount window on Oct. 6.  Wachovia, New York-based  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  and
Charlotte-based  Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  said in a statement in
August 2007 that each had borrowed $500 million from the Fed’s
discount window “to display the effectiveness of the
facility.” Citigroup Inc., based in  New York , also borrowed
$500 million, the New York-based bank said in a separate
statement.  Bank of America  Bank of America tapped the Fed’s discount window two more
times in August 2007 than previously disclosed, going to the Fed
on Aug. 23 and Aug. 24 for $500 million each day, according to
Fed documents. JPMorgan borrowed at least $5.9 billion from the
discount window over six months during the height of the
financial crisis, documents show.  The regulator had never revealed who used the discount
window since it began lending in 1914. Bloomberg News is posting
