A letter bomb was found and defused
at the Korydallos Prison in western Athens,  police  said.  The bomb, sent to the prison’s governor in a padded
envelope, was detected by a scanning device during checking of
mail items sent to the facility, according to a  statement  today
on the website of the Greek police force.  The envelope bore Italian postage stamps while the sender’s
address was listed as the Florence, Italy-based  Eurofor  rapid
reaction peace-keeping force, which comprises units from France,
Italy, Portugal and  Spain , according to the statement.  Italian police on Dec. 27 defused a package bomb at the
Greek embassy in Rome. Suspected members of Greek urban
guerrilla group Conspiracy of the Cells of Fire are being tried
at a special facility at the prison for their alleged
involvement in a series of parcel bombs that caused explosions
at embassies in  Athens  in November.  To contact the reporter on this story:
