Mexico ’s peso posted the biggest
quarterly gain in a year on improved economic prospects and
slowing inflation.  The peso rose 3.7 percent this quarter to 11.90478 per  U.S.
dollar  at 5 p.m. New York time, from 12.34005 on Dec. 31. The
quarterly gain was the biggest since the first three months of
last year, when the currency increased 5.9 percent. The peso has
advanced in five of the last six quarters and rose 0.1 percent
today.  “The improving economic outlook for Mexico has drawn lots
of funds and investors back to the peso,” said  Ramon Cordova , a
currency trader at Base Internacional Casa de Bolsa in
Monterrey. “Inflation concerns are distorting some currencies
as banks prepare to act.”  Mexico’s economy may grow as much as 5 percent this year
after expanding 5.5 percent last year, the fastest pace in 10
years, Finance Minister  Ernesto Cordero  said last week. Annual
inflation slowed to 3.1 percent in mid-March, within the central
bank’s target range of 2 percent to 4 percent.  Mexico’s expansion this year has been better than expected
and growth prospects for the rest of the year are good, central
bank Governor Agustin Carstens said today.  The yield on Mexico’s 10 percent peso bond due 2024 rose 1
basis points, or 0.01 percentage point, to 7.84 percent today,
according to Banco Santander SA. The price of the security fell
0.12 centavo to 118.04 centavos per peso.  Traders bought $600 million in dollar options today that
can be executed in April, the bank said on its website. The bank
has been buying $600 million monthly since March 2010 through
the options, boosting foreign reserves and curbing the peso’s
gain. Foreign reserves fell to $121.9 billion in the week ending
March 25, the central bank said this week in an e-mail. The
reserves rose to a record earlier this month.  Mexico is prepared to deal with the effects of capital
outflows as investors seek safer havens, Carstens said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
