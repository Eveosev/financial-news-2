BP Plc (BP/)  is planning additional work
during a turnaround that will include the shutdown of crude and
a coking unit at its Cherry Point refinery in Washington state.  The additional work “addresses corrosion problems and
increases reliability of the system without increasing crude
unit throughput,” according to a filing with the Northwest
Clean Air Agency dated March 29. Workers will replace heavy
vacuum gas oil pump around pump impellers and modify exchange
circuits.  BP is planning maintenance during a spring turnaround on
the crude and coker units, the company said in a May letter sent
to the agency. The London-based company hasn’t provided more
specific dates, Dan Mahar, an air quality engineer with the
agency, said in an e-mail yesterday.  The Cherry Point refinery has a capacity of 234,000 barrels
a day, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
