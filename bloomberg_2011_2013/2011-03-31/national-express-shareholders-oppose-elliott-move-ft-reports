Institutions with stakes in
 National Express Group Plc (NEX)  expressed support for the transport
company’s management, which is under attack by Elliott Advisors,
the British arm of U.S. hedge-fund firm Elliott Associates LP,
the Financial Times reported.  Elliott is urging a boardroom shake-up and there’s
speculation that it wants  National Express  broken up, the
newspaper said.  M&G Investment Management Ltd., which owns 13 percent of
National Express, is satisfied with progress made by Chief
Executive Officer Dean Finch and Chairman John Devaney and is
unlikely to support Elliott, the FT said, without saying where
it got the information.  Other, unidentified, shareholders described Elliott’s
campaign as unhelpful and as conceived on a very short
timescale, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
