Venezuelan Oil Minister  Rafael Ramirez  said the nation estimates that an international court
will award  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  and  ConocoPhillips (COP)  less than $2.5
billion for assets nationalized by President Hugo Chavez,
Reuters  reported .  Ramirez said at an event that he expects a World Bank
arbitration tribunal to issue rulings on the cases against
Venezuela this year, Reuters reported.  Exxon, the largest U.S. oil company, last year cut the
amount it is seeking through international arbitration to $7
billion from $12 billion plus interest, Reuters reported.  -- Editors: Jessica Brice, Robin Saponar  To contact the reporter on this story:
