Japanese stocks rose for a second
day as some companies reported improved earnings and on optimism
signs of a strengthening recovery in the U.S. will boost
exporters.  Toyota Motor Corp., the world’s No. 1 carmaker, gained 0.6
percent after a U.S. report showed companies added more workers
this month. Advantest Corp., the world’s biggest maker of
machines used to test memory chips, climbed 3.8 percent.
Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma Co., a drugmaker, jumped 6.2 percent
after boosting its profit outlook.  The  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average rose 0.5 percent to 9,755.1 at
the 3 p.m. market close in Tokyo, the highest since March 11,
when the nation’s record earthquake and tsunami hit the country.
The broader Topix index increased 0.4 percent to 869.38 with
about twice as many stocks advancing as falling. The fiscal year
ends today in  Japan .  “Now that the damage from the disaster has been factored
in, there’s no big downside risks for stocks,” said Mutsuhiko Tsuzaka, a  fund manager  in Tokyo at Meiji Yasuda Life Insurance
Co., which has $310 billion in total assets. “Economic figures
in the U.S. including employment are at good levels.”  The 7 percent drop of the Nikkei and the Topix from the day
before the March 11 quake to yesterday made them the worst
performers among indexes for the world’s largest markets this
year. The temblor and tsunami killed more than 10,000 people,
razed homes and factories and crippled the Fukushima Dai-Ichi
plant northeast of  Tokyo .  Quarterly Performance  The Nikkei 225 declined 12 percent during the Japanese
fiscal year that finishes today. The measure had a 4.6 percent
loss for the quarter. Among the 33 industry groups in the Topix,
 utility companies  including Tokyo Electric Power Co., the
operator of the nuclear plant crippled by the March 11
earthquake and tsunami, were the worst performers this year,
followed by brokerages, while oil refiners had the biggest
return.  Toyota gained 0.6 percent to 3,350 yen. Advantest climbed
3.8 percent to 1,498 yen. Fanuc Corp., an industrial-robot
manufacturer which gets about 20 percent of its revenue in  North
America , advanced 1.5 percent to 12,590 yen, and was the biggest
single support for the Nikkei’s gain.  A report from ADP Employer Services showed U.S. companies
hired 201,000 workers in March, marking the third time in four
months that the nation added more than 200,000 jobs. A Labor
Department report tomorrow may show total U.S. non-farm payrolls
rose 190,000 in March and the  unemployment rate  held at 8.9
percent, economists predict. The jobless rate fell below 9
percent in February for the first time in 22 months.  ‘Strong Expectations’  “The market had strong expectations for the U.S. job
numbers, and they were borne out by the results,” said
Mitsushige Akino, who oversees about $450 million in Tokyo at
Ichiyoshi Investment Management Co.  Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma jumped 6.2 percent to 775 yen,
the second-biggest increase in the Nikkei 225. The drugmaker
raised its full-year net income outlook 36 percent to 15 billion
yen ($181.5 million). It also signed an agreement to license an
antipsychosis drug in Europe to Takeda Pharmaceutical Co.  Shimamura Co. , an apparel retailer, climbed 5.6 percent to
7,330 yen. The company said full-year net income rose 8.2
percent to a record of 23.5 billion yen.  Kuraray Co., a fiber maker, leapt 5 percent to 1,072 yen.
The company may post a gain of about 70 percent in operating
profit to slightly more than 52 billion yen for this fiscal year
ending March, buoyed by demand of polarizer materials for liquid
crystal displays, the Nikkei newspaper reported.  To contact the reporters on this story:
