Austria ’s budget deficit widened to
4.6 percent of gross domestic product last year, more than
previously announced, after debt of government-owned companies
including the railway and a nationalized bank was reclassified.  The Austrian Statistics Office in Vienna partially included
OeBB Infrastruktur AG, which builds and maintains the country’s
railroad infrastructure, in the government’s deficit and debt,
it said in a  statement  today. It also included debts of public
hospitals and of KA Finanz AG, a nationalized bank.  The changes increased the 2010 deficit by 2.9 billion euros
($4.1 billion), or 1 percent of GDP, and boosted the Alpine
country’s total debt level by 9.5 billion euros to 205 billion
euros, or 72.3 percent of GDP, at the end of last year. The
 Finance Ministry  had announced a preliminary budget deficit of
4.1 percent of GDP on Jan. 31.  The reclassification was triggered by new rules for
government-debt accounting issued by the European statistics
office Eurostat last year, Austria’s statistics agency said. It
also revised  past deficit and debt levels  according to the new
rules as far back as 1995.  To contact the reporter on this story:
