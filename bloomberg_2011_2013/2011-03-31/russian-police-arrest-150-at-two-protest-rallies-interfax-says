Russian police arrested more than
100 protesters at an anti-government rally in  St. Petersburg  and
54 at one in Moscow, Interfax reported.  The St. Petersburg charges included taking part in
unsanctioned protests and violating traffic rules, Interfax
said, citing police officials. Among those detained were Eduard
Limonov and Konstantin Kosyakin, leaders of anti-government
organizations, according to the  news agency .  Opposition supporters gather across the country on the last
day of every month that has 31 days to protest against what they
call the governmentâ€™s violation of Article 31 of the Russian
constitution, which guarantees the freedom of peaceful assembly.  To contact the reporter on this story:
