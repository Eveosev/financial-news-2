Sappi Ltd. (SAP) , the world’s largest
maker of glossy paper, said it’s considering closing its
Biberist mill in  Switzerland  as increased raw material and
energy costs make the operation unprofitable.  “Despite our best efforts to curb costs and gain better
margins, Biberist mill has been unable to generate acceptable
returns,” the Johanesburg-based company said in statement
today. The plant accounts for about  12 percent  of Sappi’s
European fine paper production, according to its website.  Papermakers including Sappi, Mondi Ltd., Stora Enso Oyj and
UPM Kymmene Oyj have closed mills as falling demand led to a
glut in supply. Increased raw material costs and “excessive
local energy prices” have put additional pressure on Sappi’s
Biberist plant, it said today.  The company will now start talks with labor unions and
other stakeholders to find the best way of improving the mill’s
profitability, it said, adding that options to be considered
include a full closure of Biberist. The plant’s closure may
result in as many as 550 job losses, Sappi said.  The papermaker currently operates nine  mills  in  Europe ,
producing a combined 4.2 million metric tons of paper a year.
Closing Biberist would reduce Sappi’s coated fine paper capacity
by 435,000 tons and uncoated fine paper volumes by 65,000 tons,
it said.  Shares in Sappi rose 1.6 percent to 35.79 rand, extending
the gain during the last 12 months to 10 percent and giving the
company a value of 19.2 billion rand ($2.8 billion.)  To contact the reporter on this story:
