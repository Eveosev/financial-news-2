A  Google Inc (GOOG) .-backed effort to
build a $5 billion undersea power line to support wind energy
from  New Jersey  to Virginia is seeking approval from the U.S.
Interior Department.  Atlantic Wind Connection  filed an application today with
the  Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and
Enforcement  for the right to build the transmission line on the
Outer Continental Shelf in the Atlantic.  The project “would enhance the competitive regional
electric market by increasing supply options and reducing
congestion on existing facilities,”  Markian Melnyk , president
of Atlantic Grid Development, which is developing the project,
said in a statement.  Atlantic Wind Connection’s 300-mile power line, buried
under the sea floor, would connect to wind turbines off the mid-
Atlantic coast. Maryland regulators and regional utilities have
opposed the project’s request for incentives, including a
guaranteed 13.58 percent return on equity, to build the line.  Google of  Mountain View ,  California , operator of the
world’s most popular Internet search engine, owns 42 percent of
the project. Backers include Tokyo-based trading company
Marubeni Corp. and Good Energies, a clean-energy investment firm
based in Zug, Switzerland.  To contact the reporter on this story:
