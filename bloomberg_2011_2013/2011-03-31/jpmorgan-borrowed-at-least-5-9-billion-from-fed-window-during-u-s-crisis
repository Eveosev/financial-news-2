JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) , the second-
largest  U.S. bank  by assets, borrowed at least $5.9 billion from
the Federal Reserve’s discount window over six months during the
height of the financial crisis.  JPMorgan had previously disclosed it borrowed $500 million
on Aug. 22, 2007, as similar loans were made to  Bank of America
Corp. (BAC)  and Wachovia Corp. “to display the effectiveness of the
facility,” according to a joint statement at the time. JPMorgan
accessed the program at least four more times through April
2008, according to documents released today under a Freedom of
Information Act request by Bloomberg News and Fox News.  Chief Executive Officer  Jamie Dimon  told reporters in
 Washington  yesterday that the release of the data “will make it
harder for people to use the discount window in the future.” At
JPMorgan, he said, “we never intend to use the discount
window” in the future. Howard Opinsky, a JPMorgan spokesman,
declined to comment today.  JPMorgan took a $625 million overnight loan from the Fed on
Oct. 16, 2007, the day before the New York-based bank reported a
third-quarter profit of $3.4 billion, according to the Fed
documents. Dimon told analysts on an Oct. 17 conference call
that he was working with executives at  Citigroup Inc. (C)  and Bank
of America to set up an $80 billion fund to buy bad assets from
structured investment vehicles, a plan later abandoned.  Tapping Discount Window  JPMorgan later borrowed $3.5 billion from the Fed’s
discount window, secured by $83.8 billion in mortgage, consumer
and commercial loans, on Jan. 16, 2008, the documents show. The
bank reported that day a 34 percent drop in net income to $2.97
billion for the fourth quarter of 2007.  The bank accessed the Fed window again on March 7, 2008,
for a $175 million overnight loan and on April 4, 2008, for
$1.13 billion. The bank announced April 3 that it paid
$140.7 million for 11.5 million shares of Bear Stearns Cos.
about a week earlier to help close that acquisition.  JPMorgan had previously reported that it borrowed from the
 Federal Reserve  discount window as well as from other central
banks. The amount, timing and terms had never been disclosed.  “Although considered as a source of available liquidity,
the firm does not view borrowing capacity at the Federal Reserve
Bank discount window and various other central banks as a
primary source of funding,” the lender said in a recent filing
with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  JPMorgan accepted $25 billion from the U.S. Troubled Asset
Relief Program during the financial crisis and repaid the funds
in June 2009.  To contact the reporters on this story:
