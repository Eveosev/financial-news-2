Oil may fall as a “bearish
trifecta” of technical indicators leave the market vulnerable,
according to an analysis by  Auerbach Grayson .  Futures are “overbought” after surging 27 percent from a
low of $83.85 on Feb. 15 to a high of $106.95 on the armed
conflict in  Libya , said  Richard Ross , an analyst at Auerbach
Grayson, a New York brokerage.  The Relative Strength Index for crude oil formed a
“negative divergence” pattern, Ross said, where prices rose to
new highs during the same period that the RSI formed a lower
high. “While prices appear firm ‘on the screen,’ underlying
momentum has ebbed and the technicals may be eroding,” Ross
said.  A final bearish indicator is that oil tested an area of
$106 to $107 a barrel on Feb. 7 to Feb. 9, and again beginning
on March 23, a so-called double-top formation, according to
Ross.  “While prices appear strong, the technicals suggest
otherwise,” Ross said in a telephone interview. “In our
experience, buying crude oil against this litany of bearish
evidence which we have outlined is not a strong play.”  Crude oil for May delivery fell 52 cents, or 0.5 percent,
to settle at $104.27 a barrel yesterday on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange .  “Should crude fail around current levels as our analysis
suggests, we would expect an initial downside test of $98 in
short order,” Ross said. “From there a test of $92 must be
considered.”  A settlement above $106 a barrel would invalidate the
analysis and set futures up to test the next target of $109,
Ross said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
