The Australian dollar was little
changed after government reports showed retail sales rose in
February and building approvals dropped.  The so-called Aussie traded at $1.3024 as of 11:32 a.m. in
Sydney from $1.0322 before the reports were released and $1.0329
in  New York  yesterday.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
