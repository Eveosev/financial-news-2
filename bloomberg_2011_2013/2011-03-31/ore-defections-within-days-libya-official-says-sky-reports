Libya’s former deputy ambassador to
the  United Nations ,  Ibrahim Dabbashi , said more diplomats and
senior-ranking Libyans are likely to defect from the Qaddafi
regime “within days,” Sky News reported.  Some high-ranking officials who want to defect are being
prevented from leaving the country by tight security, Sky  cited
Dabbashi as saying.  Dabbashi said the Libyan mission to the UN had been
anticipating the defection of the country’s Foreign Minister
Moussa Koussa, according to Sky. “His defection exposes the
lies that the regime are putting out,” Sky cited Dabbashi as
saying. “Koussa knows that Colonel Qaddafi is finished,”
Dabbashi said, Sky reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
