The  New York  Mets placed outfielder
 Jason Bay  on the 15-day disabled list to open the Major League
Baseball season.  The decision on Bay, who strained a muscle in his ribcage
two days ago, is retroactive to March 25, the Mets said in a
statement. Outfielder Lucas Duda will take Bay’s spot on the
team’s active roster.  Bay, who signed a four-year contract worth $66 million in
January 2010, missed the final two months of last season after
suffering a concussion on July 23. The former All-Star played in
95 games, batting .259 with 6 home runs and 47 runs batted in.  To contact the reporter on this story:
