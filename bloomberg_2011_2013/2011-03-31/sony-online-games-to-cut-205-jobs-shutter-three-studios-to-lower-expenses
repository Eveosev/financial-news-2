Sony Online Entertainment, the unit
that makes online role-playing games, will cut 205 jobs and
close three studios in a cost-cutting move.  The San Diego-based producer of massive multiplayer online
games such as “EverQuest” and “DC Universe Online” will
consolidate there and in Austin,  Texas , after shutting its
Denver, Seattle and Tuscon,  Arizona , studios, the company said
today in an e-mailed statement.  As part of the restructuring, the  Sony Corp. (6758)  unit is
discontinuing production of “The Agency,” a spy shooter title
in development since 2007 for Windows computers and the
PlayStation 3 game console.  Like other game studios, Sony Online Entertainment
President John Smedley has said the company will develop more
free-to-play games to take advantage of the growing popularity
of casual games on social networking sites such as Facebook Inc.
Those games require less money and time, Smedley has said.  “This strategic alignment of development resources better
positions SOE to remain a global leader in online gaming and
deliver on its promise of creating entertaining games for
players of all ages,” Taina Rodriguez, a spokeswoman, said in
the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
