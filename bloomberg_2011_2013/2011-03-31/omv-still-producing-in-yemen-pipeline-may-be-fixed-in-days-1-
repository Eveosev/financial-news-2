OMV AG (OMV) , central  Europe ’s biggest
oil company, still is producing in Yemen, according to Gerhard Roiss, the company’s designated chief executive officer.  While flow at a pipeline has been disrupted, the pipe may
be fixed in “coming days,” Roiss told reporters in Vienna
today, adding that this wasn’t the first time the pipeline had
been halted.  The Safer Export Pipeline in the country, which transports
OMV oil, was damaged in an explosion two weeks ago. OMV last
week decided to withdraw all 60 of its expatriate staff in Yemen
and has implemented travel restrictions.  Production in Yemen now is being managed out of Dubai, said
Roiss, who takes over as CEO tomorrow. Yemen was responsible for
about 2.1 percent of OMV’s production last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
