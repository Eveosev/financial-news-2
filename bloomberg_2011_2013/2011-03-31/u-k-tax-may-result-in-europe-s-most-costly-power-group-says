The U.K. may be left with  Europe ’s
most-expensive power as a result of plans to introduce in 2013 a
carbon tax designed to reduce emissions blamed for  climate
change , the Association of U.K. Coal Importers said.  The U.K. intends to impose a tax on fossil-fueled power
producers of 4.94 pounds ($7.97) a metric ton of carbon-dioxide
in 2013, on top of the expense of European Union permits. U.K.
Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne  announced the plan as
part of his annual budget presentation last week. The government
said the tax may rise to 7.28 pounds in 2014 and 9.86 pounds in
2015.  “Unless this policy is followed across Europe, it will
mean the U.K. has the most expensive electricity” across the
continent, Nigel Yaxley, the group’s managing director, told a
Coaltrans conference in Geneva today.  Britain’s power-station emissions are already covered under
the European Union’s cap-and-trade program. EU permits for
delivery in December, the benchmark contract, have risen 21
percent this year to 17.19 euros ($24.46) a metric ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
