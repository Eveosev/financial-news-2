Dutch grass was found to be free of
radioactive contamination from a leaking nuclear plant in  Japan ,
according to testing done this week, the Netherlands’ Wageningen
University said.  Measurements by the National Monitoring Network for
Radioactivity in Food found no radioactive iodine or cesium in
grass samples, Wageningen said in a  statement  on its website
dated March 29.  Japan was hit by its strongest earthquake on record on
March 11, followed by a tsunami that crippled the Fukushima Dai-
Ichi nuclear plant north of  Tokyo . Because the situation at the
stricken facility isn’t yet under control, new measurements will
be made in several weeks, Wageningen said.  “This result confirms the expectation that the Dutch food-
production chain hasn’t been contaminated with radio isotopes
from Japan,” Wageningen said.  The Netherlands’ National Institute for  Public Health  and
the Environment, known by its Dutch acronym of RIVM, said March
25 it had found  radioactive particles  in an atmospheric sample
at a “negligible” concentration 10,000 times lower than after
the accident at the Chernobyl nuclear plant in  Ukraine .  To contact the reporter on this story:
