U.S. stock futures fell, signaling
the market may trim its biggest first-quarter rally in 13 years,
after jobless claims topped estimates and investors awaited data
to gauge the health of manufacturing industries.  Futures on the  S&P 500  expiring in June fell 0.2 percent to
1,321.7 at 8:39 a.m. in  New York . Dow Jones Industrial Average
futures slipped 0.1 percent to 12,279 and Nasdaq-100 Index
futures lost 0.2 percent to 2,330.5.  The S&P 500 has advanced 5.6 percent so far this quarter
and is heading for its biggest gain in the January-March period
since 1998, when the index surged 14 percent. An earthquake and
subsequent tsunami in  Japan  and concern that revolts in the
Middle East and North Africa will curb global growth as energy
prices rise dragged the S&P 500 as much as 6.4 percent lower
from Feb. 18 through March 16.  The S&P 500 usually climbs further following first-quarter
gains similar to those this year, according to Birinyi
Associates Inc. The index rises about 7.1 percent in the final
three quarters of years following January-March gains of 5
percent to 7 percent, Birinyi data dating back to 1928 show.  The benchmark gauge of U.S. stocks is trading for about
13.6 times its companies’ estimated operating earnings, compared
with an average multiple of 18.1 times reported profits over the
last decade, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Jobless claims fell by 6,000 to 388,000 in the week ended
March 26, Labor Department figures showed today in  Washington ,
topping the median estimate of 380,000 in a Bloomberg survey of
economists. The government also issued its annual revisions to
the seasonal-adjustment factors, which caused a “mild upward
shift” in the number of applications, an agency spokesman said
as the figures were released to reporters.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
