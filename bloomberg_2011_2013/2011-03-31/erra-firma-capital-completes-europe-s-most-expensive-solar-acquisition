Terra Firma Capital Partners Ltd.,
a U.K. private equity firm, purchased Rete Rinnovabile Srl for
641 million euros ($909.8 million), the most expensive
acquisition of a solar company in  Europe .  Rete was a unit of  Italy ’s national power-grid operator
Terna SpA, which received net proceeds of 204 million euros from
the sale, it said today in a  statement . Rete Rinnovabile owns 62
solar photovoltaic plants in 11 regions in Italy.  The deal was first announced in October and was funded by
debt and equity, according to Terra Firma. The Guernsey, Channel
Islands-based company  said  the deal was the biggest to date for
a solar power generator in Europe.  Terra Firma owns the U.K.-based renewable energy companies
Infinis Plc and Novera Energy Plc and U.S.-based EverPower Wind
Holdings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
