The state-owned Asset Management
Corp. of  Nigeria  bought 1 trillion naira ($6.5 billion) of non-
performing loans under the second phase of its program to rid
the country’s lenders of bad debts, Managing Director Mustapha
Chike-Obi said.  “We have bought all the eligible non-performing loans
offered to us by the banks,” he said in a phone interview today
from Abuja, the capital.  Amcon, as the company is known, will issue 1.7 trillion
naira of bonds on April 6, Chike-Obi said. Amcon delayed issuing
1.5 trillion naira of bonds on Jan. 31 because it had not
obtained all regulatory approvals, Foluke Dosumu, executive
director for finance, said that day. Part of the debt will
replace the so-called consideration bonds which it issued to
banks that sold 1.04 trillion naira of debts to it on Dec.31.  The latest debt purchases have a face value of “about 500
billion naira,” Chike-Obi said.  The  Central Bank of Nigeria  in 2009 bailed out the banking
industry with 620 billion naira and fired eight bank chiefs
after a debt crisis threatened it with collapse.  The Nigerian Stock Exchange All Share Index fell for a
second day, losing 0.3 percent to 24,621.38 by the 2:30 p.m.
