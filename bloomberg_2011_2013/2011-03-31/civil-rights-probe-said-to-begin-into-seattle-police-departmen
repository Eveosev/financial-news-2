The U.S.  Justice Department  is
opening a civil rights investigation into the  Seattle  police
department, according to a U.S. official who spoke on condition
of anonymity.  Thomas Perez, the assistant attorney general for the
department’s civil rights division, plans to announce the probe
today, according to the official, who wasn’t authorized to
publicly discuss the matter.  A Justice Department news release said Perez would announce
a “pattern or practice investigation in Seattle” without
giving specifics.  To contact the reporter on this story:
