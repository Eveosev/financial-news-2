Nigerian police arrested seven
members of a militant Islamic group after a clash in Damaturu,
capital of the northeastern state of Yobe.  “They engaged my men in a gun battle before finally
running away after bombing the house,” Police Commissioner
Mohamed Abubakar told reporters today in the city.  Authorities in the region have blamed a group known as Boko
Haram, which draws inspiration from  Afghanistan ’s Taliban
movement, for a spate of killings targeting government officials
and the security forces in recent months.  Nigeria ,  Africa ’s top oil producer and most populous
country, with more than 140 million people, is roughly split
between a mainly Muslim north and a predominantly Christian
south. More than 14,000 people died in ethnic and religious
clashes in the West African nation between 1999 and 2009,
according to the Brussels-based  International Crisis Group .  To contact the reporter on this story:
