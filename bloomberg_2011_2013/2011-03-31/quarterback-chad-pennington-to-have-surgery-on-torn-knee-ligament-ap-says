Quarterback Chad Pennington will
have surgery April 7 on a knee ligament he tore during a
basketball game, the  Associated Press  reported.  Orthopedic surgeon James Andrews will perform the procedure
on the 34-year-old’s anterior cruciate ligament,  AP said , citing
Creative Artists, Pennington’s representation agency.  A National Football League free agent, Pennington played 10
games last season for the Miami Dolphins before undergoing his
fourth right shoulder surgery.  The two-time AP Comeback Player of the Year was in his
third season in Miami after spending his first eight years in
the NFL with the  New York Jets .  To contact the reporter on this story:
