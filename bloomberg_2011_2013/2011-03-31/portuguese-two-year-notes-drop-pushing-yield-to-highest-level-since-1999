Portuguese two-year notes dropped
for a ninth day, pushing the yield to the highest since before
the introduction of the euro.  The yield rose four basis points to 8.07 percent, the most
since 1996, as of 8:37 a.m. in  London . The 10-year yield was
unchanged at 8.10 percent.  Irish two-year notes were little changed, with the yield at
9.53 percent, while the 10-year yield dropped two basis points
to 10.08 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
