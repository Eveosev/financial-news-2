Israel Discount Bank Ltd. (DSCT)  fell the
most in more than two weeks after the country’s third-largest
lender by assets, said fourth-quarter profit dropped 12 percent
and DS Brokerage Ltd. lowered the shares to “market perform.”  The shares slid 3.3 percent, the biggest intraday decline
since March 15, to 7.25 shekels at 12:44 p.m. in Tel Aviv,
bringing the drop this quarter to 10 percent.  Fourth-quarter net income fell to 135 million shekels
($38.7 million) from 154 million year-earlier period, the Tel
Aviv-based bank said.  “Discount is expected to continue to post relatively weak
earnings,” Meir Slater, an analyst at Tel Aviv-based DS
Brokerage, said by telephone.  Slater, who lowered his recommendation from “market
outperform” cut the price estimate for the shares to 8 shekels
from 8.7 shekels.  To contact the reporter on this story:
