BKS Bank AG (BKUS) , Niederosterreichische
Landesbank-Hypothekenbank AG, UniCredit Bank Austria AG and
Kaerntner Sparkasse AG are interested in Hypo Alpe-Adria-Bank
International AG’s Austrian unit, Format reported, without
saying where it got the information.  The banks will “shortly” be able to examine the unit’s
books and non-binding offers are due in April, the Vienna-based
magazine said. Hypo Alpe will decide which of the bidders will
be allowed to examine the “red” dataroom with sensitive data
in late April, the magazine said.     To contact the reporter on this story:
