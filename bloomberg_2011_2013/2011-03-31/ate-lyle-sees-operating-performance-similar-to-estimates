Tate & Lyle Plc (TATE) , maker of the low-
calorie sweetener Splenda, said higher food-ingredients volume
and improved profitability at its industrial starches unit means
it will meet analysts’ estimates in the year that ends today.  The company’s operating performance was “similar to market
expectations,” the London-based company said in a statement
today. The median estimate of seven analysts compiled by
Bloomberg is for operating profit of 309 million pounds ($498
million). Increases in corn prices drove a further rise in so-
called co-product income in the final quarter, Tate said.  The manufacturer said today it sold its Fort Dodge, Iowa,
ethanol plant to grain distributer Cargill Inc. for $57 million
and will book a one-time gain of 11 million pounds. Tate said in
May last year it would book an exceptional charge on the plant
as it refocused its strategy on the speciality food unit.  Tate, led by Chief Executive Officer Javed Ahmed, has sold
sugar refineries in the European Union and its molasses unit to
concentrate on more profitable divisions including its global
additives and food business. The company expects net debt at the
end of the year to be lower than the 540 million pounds reported
at Sept. 30, 2010. Tate will announce full-year results May 27.  The shares rose 14 pence, or 2.5 percent, to 573.5 pence as
of 8:32 a.m. in  London . They’re gained 12 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
