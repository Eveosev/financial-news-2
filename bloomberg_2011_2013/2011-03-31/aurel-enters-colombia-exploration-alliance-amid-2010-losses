Etablissements Maurel & Prom SA, a
French oil explorer, said losses widended in 2010 and pledged to
raise output from Gabon, Nigeria and  Colombia .  Maurel, based in Paris, had a 2010 loss of 139 million
euros ($197 million) compared with a loss of 51 million euros
the previous year, according to a statement. The company took a
charge on exploration costs of 135 million euros and another for
76 million euros on Tanzania operations.  The French  oil company  recommended a dividend of 25 cents a
share.  Maurel & Prom, which started in 1813 as a trading company
between Bordeaux and French colonies in West Africa, has
struggled to raise oil production since selling Congolese fields
to Eni SpA in 2007. At the time, Chief Executive Officer Jean-
Francois Henin said output would be halved after the disposal
and returned to pre-sale levels within two years, helped by new
wells in Gabon. He has so far failed to reach this target. The
company had production of about 30,000 barrels a day before the
sale of the Congo wells.  Maurel today said output from onshore Gabon and Nigeria
fields accounted for about three quarters of total revenue of
346 million euros and was 14,618 barrels a day from Gabon and
3,570 barrels a day from Nigerian fields.  Maurel also announced today the sale of 50 percent of its
stakes in five Colombian permits to Pacific Rubiales Energy,
which will help pay for exploration and development at the
sites, according to a separate statement.  The alliance will allow “faster monetization” of
hydrocarbons already found in the blocks, especially Sabanero,
according to the company.  “The alliance should be favorable for Maurel to share
future exploration costs as well as being reimbursed for part of
past expenses,” Aurel BGC analyst Julien Guez said in a note to
clients today. He recommends buying the shares.  Maurel reiterated it plans to farm out its interests in
Tanzania.  To contact the reporter on this story:
