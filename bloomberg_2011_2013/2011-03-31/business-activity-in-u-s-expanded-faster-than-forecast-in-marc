Business activity in the U.S.
expanded at a faster pace than forecast in March, signaling
manufacturing remains a driver of growth in the world’s largest
economy.  The Institute for Supply Management-Chicago Inc. said today
its business barometer fell to 70.6 this month from February’s
71.2 reading that was the highest since July 1988. The index
exceeded the 69.9 median forecast of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News. Figures greater than 50 signal expansion.  Strengthening sales in the U.S. and faster growth in
overseas markets is helping manufacturers like  United
Technologies Corp. (UTX)  to boost profit. In addition, many businesses
are still rebuilding the stockpiles they slashed during the
recession and controlled in the early stage of the recovery.  “Continued strength in manufacturing is the bottom line
here,” said  Jim O’Sullivan , chief economist at MF Global Inc.
in New York, who had forecast a reading of 70. “We’ve had
strong domestic demand and exports driving the gains.”  Other reports today showed  consumer confidence  rose for the
first time in five weeks as Americans said their finances were
in better shape, and applications for jobless benefits fell.  The Bloomberg Consumer  Comfort Index  improved to minus 46.9
in the period ended March 27 from a seven-month low of minus
48.9 the prior week. Readings this low are historically seen
during recessions, according to  Gary Langer , president of Langer
Research Associates LLC in New York, which compiles the index
for Bloomberg.  Fewer Claims  The number of Americans applying for  unemployment insurance 
fell by 6,000 to 388,000 in the week ended March 26, according
to data from the Labor Department. They were projected to fall
to 380,000 from 382,000 initially reported for the prior week,
according to the median forecast of 42 economists in a Bloomberg
survey. Estimates ranged from 370,000 to 390,000.  Stocks swung between gains and losses, depressed by the
higher than projected number of claims. The Standard & Poor’s
500 Index was little changed at 1,328.38 at 10:22 a.m. in New
York.  The median forecast for the Chicago group’s factory gauge
was based on projections from 54 economists. Estimates ranged
from 64 to 73.9.  The employment measure climbed to 65.6, the highest level
since 1983, from 59.8 in the prior month, and the production
gauge decreased to 74.2 from 78.2.  Growing Backlogs  The gauge of new orders fell to 74.5 from 75.9. The index
of backlogs increased to 69.6, the highest since 1974, from
61.8.  The report also showed the cost of raw materials continues
to climb. The group’s prices paid index rose to 83.4 from 81.2.  United Technologies, the maker of Pratt & Whitney jet-
engines and Otis elevators, is among companies benefiting from
growth in the so-called BRIC countries that cover  Brazil ,
 Russia ,  India  and  China . The Hartford, Connecticut-based company
this month boosted the low end of its 2011 earnings forecast
amid improving markets across its divisions.  “We see a lot of momentum and growth in emerging markets
that have outpaced really developed markets,” Louis Chenevert,
chairman and chief executive officer, said on a conference call
with investors on March 23. “I’m confident that the momentum
will continue.”  Economists watch the Chicago index and other regional
manufacturing reports for an early reading on the national
outlook. The Chicago group says its membership includes both
manufacturers and service providers, making the gauge a measure
of overall growth. Its members have operations across the U.S.
and abroad.  Regional Strength  Other regional factory reports showed manufacturing is
accelerating. The  Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia ’s index
indicated factories expanded in March at the fastest pace since
1984, while the  New York  Fed’s measure rose to a nine-month
high.  The ISM’s national factory index may be little-changed at
61 this month after February’s 61.4 reading that was the highest
level since May 2004, according to the median forecast of
economists surveyed. The Tempe, Arizona-based group’s figures
are due tomorrow.  Federal Reserve policy makers have said the economy is on a
“firmer footing,” helped by growth in household spending and
business investment in equipment and software, according to a
statement after their March 15 meeting.  To contact the reporter on this story:
