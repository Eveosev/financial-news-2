Kenya, East Africa’s largest
economy, said it plans to increase its strategic grain reserves
almost threefold to improve  food security .  The country will boost reserves to 8 million 90-kilogram
(198-pound) bags by December, from 3.1 million bags now, Prime
Minister  Raila Odinga ’soffice said in a statement handed to
reporters today in Nairobi, the capital. Kenya had stocks of 2.1
million bags this time last year, it said.  “The Ministry of Agriculture has rolled out an ambitious
irrigation program to enhance food security,” the government
said in the statement. As part of the program, 40,000 acres
(16,187 hectares) will be irrigated, rising to 1 million acres
within five years, it said.  In January,  Kenya’s Red Cross Society  said it’s seeking
1.43 billion shillings ($17.2 million) in aid to fight the
effects of a drought which had already affected 1.86 million
people and more than 20 million livestock.  Corn is a staple food in  Kenya .  To contact the reporter on this story:
