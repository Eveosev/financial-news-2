The U.K. government awarded
contracts to run three prisons to  G4S Plc (GFS)  and  Serco Group Plc (SRP) ,
Justice Minister Kenneth Clarke said.  G4S will run Birmingham Prison and a new facility,
Featherstone 2, near Wolverhampton in the West Midlands, Clarke
told lawmakers in the House of Commons in London today. Serco
will run Doncaster Prison in Yorkshire, while Buckley Hall, near
Manchester, will be run by the government’s prison service after
competitive bidding.  “This  process  shows that competition can deliver
innovation, efficiency and better value for money for the
taxpayer but also that it can do so without compromising
standards,” Clarke said. “Over the spending review period, the
new contracts will deliver savings of over 21 million pounds
($34 million) for the three existing prisons.”  Clarke said Featherstone 2 will cost 31 million pounds less
than agreed on by the previous government and, over the lifetime
of the contracts for the three existing prisons, the government
will save 216 million pounds. Serco said in a statement that its
contract was valued at about 250 million pounds over 15 years.  The contracts for Birmingham, Doncaster and Buckley Hall
are effective from October 2011, Clarke said, while Featherstone
2 will start in April 2012. Wellingborough Prison in
Northamptonshire was removed from the list during the bidding
process, the department said in an e-mailed statement.  To contact the reporters on this story:
