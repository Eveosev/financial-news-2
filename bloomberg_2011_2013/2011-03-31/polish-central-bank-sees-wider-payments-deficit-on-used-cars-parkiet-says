Poland ’s current account deficit
may be wider by about 1 percentage point of gross domestic
product due to unregistered imports of used cars, Jozef Sobota,
the head of the central bank’s statistics department, was quoted
today as saying by the newspaper  Parkiet .  Sobota said a team of central bank researchers is examining
errors and omissions in the payments data, which amount to about
4 percentage points of GDP, Parkiet reported. The team’s
findings may lead to a revision of current account figures for
the first quarter of 2011, which will be published in about
three months, according to the newspaper.  Discrepancies between Polish and German trade figures, in
which German statistics show greater exports to Poland, may be
due to the so-called Rotterdam effect, in which goods landed in
ports in  Germany  and shipped to Poland are treated as imports
from their country of origin in Polish statistics and exports
from Germany in German figures, Sobota said, Parkiet reported.  Other possible contributors to the balance of errors, which
Sobota said was not atypical for other countries in the European
Union, may be unregistered foreign investments of Poles, changes
in money transfers from Poles working abroad or from foreigners
working in Poland, and unregistered tourism, Sobota said,
according to the newspaper.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
