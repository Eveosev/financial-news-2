Scheduled natural gas deliveries to
U.S. households fell for a fourth day on forecasts for higher
temperatures in the  Rocky Mountains  and the West that may reduce
demand for the heating fuel.  A sample of scheduled deliveries to homes in the U.S. and
Canada shows shipments fell 3.5 percent to 33.7 million
dekatherms (32.8 billion cubic feet), according to data compiled
by Bloomberg as of 9:50 a.m. in  New York .  Residences in the West and Rockies region were to receive
3.16 million dekatherms, down more than 20 percent for the
second time this week, Bloomberg data show.  Scheduled shipments for U.S. power plants dropped 4.5
percent to 12.9 million dekatherms.  The low temperature in Denver early today was 48 degrees
Fahrenheit (9 Celsius), 18 above normal, according to  Weather
Underground  in  Ann Arbor , Michigan. The overnight low may be 43
degrees, 14 above normal.  Wholesale gas delivered into CIG-Mainline, part of the
Colorado Interstate Gas Company pipeline system in the Rocky
Mountains and the pricing point for Denver, fell 0.76 cent
yesterday, or 0.2 percent, to $3.9923 per million British
thermal units on the Intercontinental Exchange.  Gas at the  Henry Hub  in Erath, Louisiana, the delivery
point for futures traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange ,
dropped 1.44 cents yesterday, or 0.3 percent, to $4.2531 per
million Btu.  To contact the reporters on this story:
