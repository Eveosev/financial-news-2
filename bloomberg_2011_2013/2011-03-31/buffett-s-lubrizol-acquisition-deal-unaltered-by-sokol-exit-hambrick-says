Lubrizol Corp. (LZ)  said its sale to
 Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A)  will be completed “as quickly as
possible” and is unaltered by the resignation of a senior
executive who helped  Warren Buffett  negotiate the takeover.  David Sokol’s departure from Omaha, Nebraska-based
Berkshire doesn’t “in any way alter the terms or the timing of
our proposed transaction,” Lubrizol Chief Executive Officer
James Hambrick said today in a regulatory filing. “We are
continuing to work with Berkshire Hathaway to complete the
merger as quickly as possible.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
