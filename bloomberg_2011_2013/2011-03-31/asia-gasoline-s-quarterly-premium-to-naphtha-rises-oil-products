Asia gasoline’s premium to naphtha
more than doubled in the three months to March amid refinery
outages in  Japan  and as U.S. motor fuel demand recovered. Prices
of fuel oil, gasoil and jet fuel posted a third quarterly gain.  Light Distillates  Gasoline’s premium to naphtha has surged to $12.10 a barrel
compared with $5.50 a barrel on Dec. 31. A wider reforming
margin means the profit from making gasoline over naphtha is
increasing.  Open-specification naphtha for delivery to Japan rose 0.8
percent from yesterday to $994.50 a metric ton, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Benchmark 92-RON gasoline climbed
0.8 percent to $120.85 a barrel, Bloomberg data showed. Both
products gained for the third consecutive quarter.  The premium of Japan-delivered naphtha to Brent, or the
crack spread, fell to $119.88 from $122.32 at the end of Asian
trading yesterday.  In  Singapore , Cargill Inc. and Noble Group agreed to swap a
first-half May naphtha cargo with a second-half May lot at a
premium of $3 a ton to prices for the later period, traders
said.  U.S. gasoline inventories slipped 2.68 million barrels to
217 million, the lowest level since December, the Energy
Department said yesterday.  Middle Distillates  Gasoil with 0.5 percent sulfur, gained 65 cents to $132.30
a barrel, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The diesel
grade rose 27 percent this quarter.  Jet fuel climbed 40 cents, or 0.3 percent, to $133.35 a
barrel.  Aviation fuel  prices gained 28 percent in the three
months to March, the most among oil products.  Jet fuel ’s premium to gasoil declined to 85 cents compared
with 90 cents on Dec. 31, data from PVM Oil Associates showed.
This regrade has narrowed, indicating it’s less profitable to
produce aviation fuel over diesel.  In Singapore, Glencore International AG bought 100,000
barrels of jet fuel loading April 15 to April 19 from Vitol
Group at a premium of 20 cents over benchmark prices. Royal
Dutch Shell Plc sold 150,000 barrels loading the same period to
BP Plc at a premium of 30 cents.  China International United Petroleum & Chemical Corp., or
Unipec, bought 150,000 barrels of gasoil with 0.5 percent sulfur
from Shell at a premium of 10 cents over benchmark prices for
the grade. The cargo was for loading April 18 to April 22.  Gasoil’s premium to Asian benchmark Dubai crude rose 11
cents to $22.83 a barrel, Bloomberg data showed. This crack
spread has gained 48 percent this quarter, the biggest increase
in a year.  Fuel Oil   Benchmark 180-centistoke fuel oil rose 0.8 percent to
$656.75 a ton, according to Bloomberg data. The price of 380-
centistoke fuel oil, mainly used as marine fuel, gained 0.9
percent to $647.50. Both grades jumped 28 percent this quarter.  Fuel oil’s discount to Dubai crude shrank 24 cents to $7.65
a barrel, Bloomberg data showed. Losses have narrowed 13 percent
this quarter.  Refinery News  JX Nippon Oil & Energy Corp., Japan’s largest refiner,
which is owned by JX Holdings Inc., will reduce crude oil
processing in April by 19 percent from a year earlier to 4.83
million kiloliters after the March 11 earthquake caused refinery
shutdowns, a company official said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
