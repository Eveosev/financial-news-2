Indonesia ’s rupiah led Asian
currencies to a third quarterly gain as regional central banks
raised interest rates and allowed appreciation in their
currencies to curb inflation.  Taiwan’s central bank lifted its benchmark rate by 0.125
percentage point to 1.75 percent today, as predicted by 17 of 18
economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The Philippines,  China ,  India ,
South Korea, Thailand and Indonesia have all tightened policy
this year. Overseas investors bought $2 billion more Indian,
South Korean and Thai equities than they sold this month,
exchange data show, as signs the U.S. economic recovery is
gaining momentum brightened prospects for export growth.  “The rate outlook is one of the drivers of the
currencies,” said Zulkiflee Nidzam, head of foreign-exchange
trading at Asian Finance Bank Bhd. in  Kuala Lumpur . “Investors
are attracted to this region because of economic and political
stability.”  The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia Dollar Index, which tracks the
region’s 10 most-traded currencies, advanced 0.7 percent this
quarter and added 0.2 percent from yesterday to 117.32 as of
4:22 p.m. in  Hong Kong . The rupiah gained 3.2 percent this year
to 8,703 per dollar, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The currency rose 0.1 percent today and touched 8,701 yesterday,
the strongest level since May 2007.  Bank of Thailand Governor Prasarn Trairatvorakul told
Bloomberg Television this week that “you can expect further
adjustments” in interest rates.  Malaysia  will likely raise
borrowing costs in the second quarter, according to a report
from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. today.  Tolerating Appreciation  Indonesia last boosted its benchmark interest rate by a
quarter of a percentage point to 6.75 percent on Feb. 4, the
first increase since October 2008. Policy makers next meet on
April 12 to review the rate. Perry Warjiyo, director of economic
research at the central bank, said March 25 that Bank Indonesia
aims to reduce import costs by allowing the rupiah to strengthen.  South Korea ’s won rose 2.7 percent this year. The currency
climbed to a 30-month high today as overseas investors increased
their holdings of Korean shares for an 11th day, the longest run
of net purchases this year, after a report showed U.S. companies
hired more workers in March. Korean manufacturers’ confidence
fell from a five-month high amid concern a record earthquake in
 Japan  will damp demand in the world’s third-largest economy, a
central bank report showed today.  The Bank of Korea said in a monetary policy report
submitted to the National Assembly today it will adjust
“appropriately” the degree of its easing policy while looking
at developments in the global economy.  ‘Lingering Concerns’  “Anticipation for an economic recovery in the U.S. and
elsewhere is prompting foreigners to buy more stocks, supporting
the won,” said Yun Se Min, a currency dealer at Busan Bank in
 Seoul . “Still, there are lingering concerns about global risks
including those in the Middle East and Japan.”  The won rose 0.7 percent to 1,096.93 per dollar today,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It touched 1,094.80
earlier, the strongest level since September 2008.  Elsewhere,  Taiwan ’s dollar advanced 3.2 percent this year
to NT$29.418 against its U.S. counterpart, according to Taipei
Forex Inc. The  Singapore  dollar gained 1.8 percent to S$1.2601
and Malaysia’s ringgit rose 1.3 percent to 3.0250. The
Philippine peso climbed 0.9 percent to 43.403 and China’s yuan
strengthened 0.6 percent to 6.5485. India’s rupee added 0.2
percent this year to 44.61, while Thailand’s baht weakened 0.9
percent to 30.25.  To contact the reporter on this story:
