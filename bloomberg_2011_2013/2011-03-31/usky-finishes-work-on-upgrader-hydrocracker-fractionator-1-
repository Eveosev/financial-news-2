Husky Energy Inc. (HSE)  has completed
repairs on a hydrocracker fractionation unit associated with its
Lloydminster oil-sands upgrader in Saskatchewan.  “We are preparing for startup mode this weekend,”  Graham White , a company spokesman based in Calgary, said in an e-mail.
The hydrocracker fractionator supplies product to the main coker
unit.  The company operated the upgrader at 40 percent to 50
percent of capacity after a Feb. 2 fire at the fractionator,
according to White.  To contact the reporter on this story:
