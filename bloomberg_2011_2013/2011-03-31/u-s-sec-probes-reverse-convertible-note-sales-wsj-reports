The U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission is investigating whether investors were fully advised
of drawbacks when they were sold a bond known as a “fully
reversible note,” the Wall Street Journal reported, citing
people familiar with the matter.  The SEC is checking to see if Wall Street banks which
developed the bonds and then sold them to individual investors
fully explained the risks and fees involved; the regulator is
also investigating possible conflicts of interest, the newspaper
said.  The industry’s self-regulating body, the Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority, is preparing to impose a large fine on a
brokerage for improperly selling the bonds, the WSJ said, citing
people familiar with the matter.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
