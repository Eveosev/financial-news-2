Bulgaria will increase natural-gas
prices 4.47 percent tomorrow reflecting higher global fuel
prices.  The State Commission for Energy & Water Regulation decided
to raise prices for households and industry to 539.86 lev ($392)
per 1,000 cubic meters, the regulator said today in a statement
in Sofia. The increase is less than the 6.6 percent requested by
the country’s dominant gas trader,  Bulgargaz AD , which buys the
fuel from  Russia ’s OAO Gazprom.  The change will affect mostly fertilizer plants and heating
utilities, which account for 80 percent of Bulgaria’s gas
consumption.  To contact the reporter on this story:
