The Bank of  Spain  is seeking to
sell Spanish savings bank  Caja de Ahorros del Mediterraneo (CAM)  to
one of the nationâ€™s largest lenders after three savings banks
voted against a merger with the entity,  El Confidencial  said.  The regulator has sent a sales prospectus for the bank,
known as CAM, to five lenders, including  Banco Santander SA (SAN) ,  La
Caixa  and Banco Popular SA, El Confidencial said, citing
unidentified people with knowledge of the matter.  Banco Santander  is the favourite as it is the only bank
that would be prepared to take on CAM without asking for
guarantees against any future losses the savings bank may incur,
El Confidencial added.  To contact the reporters on this story:
