Irish regulators instructed four
banks to raise 24 billion euros ($34 billion) in additional
capital following stress tests on the nation’s lenders.  Allied Irish Banks Plc (ALBK) , the biggest lender during the
decade-long economic boom, requires 13.3 billion euros, the
central bank in Dublin said today after publishing the results
for four banks. Bank of Ireland Plc must get 5.2 billion euros,
while Irish Life & Permanent Plc and EBS Building Society make
up the remainder, the central bank said.  “Banks will be capitalized as the additional  capital
requirements  announced today provide for future loan losses over
the course of the three years on a scale that is unlikely to
occur and an additional buffer for subsequent events,” Governor
 Patrick Honohan  said in the statement.  Ireland’s authorities are trying to show investors, its
taxpayers and the rest of the euro region that the nation has
plugged all the holes in the banking system, whose collapse so
far cost 46.3 billion euros in capital and crippled what was
once  Europe ’s most dynamic economy.  Ireland’s banks were reliant on the  European Central Bank 
for 88.7 billion euros of funding at the end of last month, the
Irish central bank said today. They may have borrowed as much as
an additional 70.1 billion euros in exceptional liquidity from
the Irish central bank, according to figures on March 11.  The country was expected to have to inject 27.5 billion
euros extra into the banks in total, according to a survey of 10
analysts and economists by Bloomberg News before the results.  The government controls four of the six domestic lenders,
including Anglo Irish Bank Corp., which epitomized Ireland’s
building boom and collapsed with the bursting of the property
bubble and 15 percent decline in gross domestic product. Anglo
Irish said today its final pretax loss was 17.7 billion euros
for 2010, a record for an Irish company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
