Peru ’s central bank raised  reserve
requirements  for a third straight month as it seeks to contain
inflation expectations amid rising food prices and surging
domestic demand.  The central bank increased the average reserve requirement
by 0.5 percentage point for deposits in soles and foreign
currency, it said in an e-mailed statement today. The measure
takes effect tomorrow.  “These adjustments in monetary policy are aimed at
preventing the increases in international food and energy prices
from raising inflation expectations in a context of strong
domestic demand,” the bank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
