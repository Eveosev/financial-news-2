Eircom Group Ltd. workers backed a
plan by the company, which is seeking to reduce debt, to cut
costs by 90 million euros ($128 million).  “We hope and expect that these further sacrifices of the
workforce will be recognized by other stakeholders,” the
 Communication Workers’ Union  said in an e-mailed statement
today. The plan got the backing of 1,908 of those balloted, with
1,388 voting against it.  Eircom, Ireland’s largest phone company, which had debt of
3.75 billion euros at the end of 2010, has a “significant”
risk of breaching senior debt covenants within the next six
months, Chief Financial Officer  Mark Wilson  said on March 1. The
company’s short to medium debt is “comfortably covered,” he
said then.  As many as 75,000 people could leave the mobile-phone
market in Ireland this year due to emigration,  Paul Donovan ,
Eircom’s chief executive officer, said this month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
