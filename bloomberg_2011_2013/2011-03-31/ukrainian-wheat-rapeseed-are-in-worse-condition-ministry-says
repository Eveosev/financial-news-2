The condition of Ukraine’s winter
wheat and rapeseed crops deteriorated in this month’s final
week, the Agriculture Ministry said, without giving a reason.  Winter wheat was weak and damaged on 6.1 percent of the
6.55 million hectares (16.2 million acres) planted with the
grain, the Kiev-based ministry said in a statement on its
website today. That compares with 5.8 percent a week earlier.
Plants failed to survive the winter on 0.2 percent of sown
areas.  Rapeseed was in weak and poor condition on 10 percent of
seeded areas, compared with 8.7 percent a week ago. Plants were
completely ruined on 0.3 percent of sown areas.  Winter wheat classified as being in good condition slipped
to 56.3 percent of planted areas from 56.9 percent a week
earlier. Rapeseed in the same category declined to 49.8 percent
from 51.4 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
