UniCredit SpA (UCG) ,  Italy ’s biggest
bank, cut its forecast for Bulgarian gross domestic product
growth this year on concerns that rising inflation will erode
household consumption.  The economy will expand 2.6 percent this year, compared
with a Dec. 14 estimate of 2.8 percent, UniCredit said in an e-
mailed statement today. The government forecasts a 3.6 percent
rise in GDP this year after 0.2 percent in 2010 and a 5.1
percent contraction in 2009. UniCredit forecast 3.3 percent
growth for next year.  “A slow recovery of the jobs market and rising inflation
will hinder household consumption and impede economic growth,”
UniCredit said. “Rising prices of fuels and foods will put most
Bulgarian households under serious pressure, given that half of
the income of an average family is spent on food and energy
payments.”  Bulgaria, the European Union’s poorest country in terms of
per-capita GDP, is recovering from its worst recession in more
than a decade after a three-year lending boom stalled and
foreign investment dried up during the global credit crisis. The
country is depending on public spending and demand for its
exports in metals, machinery, textiles and furniture to boost
the economy.  Bulgaria’s inflation rate rose to 5.2 percent in February,
the highest in 23 months, while producer prices grew 12.5
percent, the fastest since September 2008, according to
Bloomberg data.  Individual consumption, which accounted for 69.8 percent of
fourth-quarter GDP, advanced 1.2 percent from the previous three
months, according to the statistics office. Exports, which
accounted for 57.8 percent of GDP, rose 16 percent from a year
ago after an 18.5 percent increase in the previous three months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
