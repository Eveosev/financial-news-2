AccessKenya (ACCESS)  Group Ltd., the
country’s only publicly traded Internet company, advanced from a
record low reached yesterday as the share price trades below a
technical indicator that signals the stock may climb.  The shares gained as much as 45 cents, or 6.4 percent, to
7.5 shillings before trading 3.6 percent higher at 7.3 shillings
by 1:07 p.m. in Nairobi. AccessKenya’s 14-day relative strength
index has traded below 30 since March 21, a level some traders
use as a signal to buy the stock.  “There was the bad news but it had over-corrected,” Eric Musau, an analyst at Nairobi-based African Alliance Securities
Kenya Ltd., said by phone today.  AccessKenya on March 23 posted a loss of 7.95 million
shillings ($95,000) for the year ended Dec. 31 compared to a
profit of 155.5 million shillings a year earlier. The stock has
slumped 46 percent this year, making it the worst performer on
 Kenya ’s bourse.  To contact the reporter on this story:
