Black Caviar became the first
Australian racehorse to be rated No. 1 in the World Thoroughbred
Rankings.  The four-year-old mare, who has won all 11 career starts
including four victories at Group 1 level, was given a rating of
130 in the  latest rankings  published today by the Paris-based
International Federation of Horseracing Authorities.  “This is a landmark day for Australian racing,” Greg
Carpenter,  Australia ’s representative on the World Thoroughbred
Rankings Committee, said in a statement.  Breeders’ Cup Classic winner Blame, the only horse to
defeat champion U.S. mare Zenyatta, is ranked second on 129,
with Prix de l’Arc de Triomphe winner Workforce and runner-up
Nakayama Festa next on 128 and 127, respectively.  The ratings, which started in 2002, are based on the
performances of horses in all global racing jurisdictions.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
