The  Asian Development Bank  approved
$650 million in loans to  Pakistan  and a $100 million loan to
 China , the lender said yesterday.  The loans to  Pakistan  will be used to help rebuild more
than 790 kilometers (491 miles) of national highways and 800
kilometers of provincial roads and bridges damaged by floods
last year, the ADB said.  China ’s loan will be used to plant
thousands of hectares of fruit and nut trees to help reforest
damaged land, it said.  Pakistan’s aid-dependent $162 billion economy has been
further set back by floods last year, the worst in the nation’s
more than six-decade history. The ADB and  World Bank  estimate
the inundations caused damage of about $10 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
