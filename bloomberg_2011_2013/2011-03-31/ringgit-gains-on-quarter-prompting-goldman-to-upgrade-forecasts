Malaysia ’s ringgit rose toward the
strongest level in 13 years on speculation the central bank will
raise  interest rates  and allow the currency to appreciate to
temper inflation.  The currency advanced for an eighth straight quarter, the
longest winning streak since at least 1971, as overseas
investors bought a record amount of Malaysian debt. Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. increased forecasts for the country’s gross
domestic product, inflation and the ringgit today.  “The rate outlook is one of the drivers for the currency’s
strength,” said Zulkiflee Nidzam, head of foreign-exchange
trading in Kuala Lumpur at Asian Finance Bank Bhd. “Investors
are attracted to this region because of economic and political
stability.”  The ringgit climbed 1.3 percent this quarter to 3.0268 per
dollar as of 10 a.m. in  Kuala Lumpur , according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. It was little changed from 3.0255 yesterday and
reached 3.0210 on March 25, the strongest level since October
1997.  Goldman Sachs’ Singapore-based economist Mark Tan forecast
 Southeast Asia ’s third-largest economy will expand 5.5 percent
this year versus a previous estimate of 5.2 percent, according
to a research note. Consumer prices may increase 3.6 percent
compared with 1.7 percent in 2010, the report showed.  The ringgit will strengthen to 2.98 against the dollar in
three months, 2.90 in six months and 2.85 in 12 months, Tan
wrote. The bank’s previous predictions were 3.00, 2.95 and 2.90,
respectively.  Bond Holdings  Inflation picked up to 2.9 percent in February from a year
earlier versus a 2.4 percent pace in January, the statistics
department said on March 25. Last month’s rate was the fastest
since April 2009 after the government raised prices of retail
fuel and sugar.  Bank Negara Malaysia  has kept the overnight benchmark
interest rate at 2.75 percent since July, after raising it three
times earlier in 2010. Its next policy meeting is on May 5. The
central bank told lenders on March 11 to set aside more cash as
reserves to help soak up liquidity and damp inflation. The
measure takes effect tomorrow.  “We still expect rate hikes to re-commence in the second
quarter, totaling 50 basis points this year,” according to the
report from Goldman Sachs. “We believe a stronger ringgit over
time also sits very well with the various economic objectives in
place.”  Overseas investors held 129.2 billion ringgit ($42.7
billion) of Malaysia’s local-currency debt in January, a 76
percent increase from a year earlier, according to data
published by  Bank Negara . The holdings included a record 75.2
billion ringgit of  government bonds .  To contact the reporter on this story:
