The Nairobi Coffee Exchange
canceled a trading session on March 29 amid a shortage of beans,
Business Daily reported, citing Daniel Mbithi, an official at
the exchange.  The marketing season will also end early this year, with
sales being halted on April 19, the Nairobi-based newspaper
said. Auctions will resume on June 7, it said.  Volumes declined after the industry experienced an early
crop following heavy rains in early 2010 that affected the
flowering of coffee trees, the newspaper said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
