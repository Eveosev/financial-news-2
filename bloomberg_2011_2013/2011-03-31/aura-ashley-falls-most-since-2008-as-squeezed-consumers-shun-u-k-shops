Laura Ashley Holdings Plc (ALY) , the
furnishings and clothing chain known for its floral designs,
plunged in London trading after saying same-store U.K. sales
fell in February and March as  consumer spending  slowed.  Same store sales dropped 4.2 percent in the eight weeks
since Jan. 29, the company said today in a statement. The stock
fell as much as 18 percent, the biggest intraday decline since
June 2008, and traded down 3.3 pence, or 13 percent, at 22 pence
at 10:41 a.m., making it the worst performer among the 626
companies in the  FTSE All-Share Index. (ASX)   Consumer spending is under pressure in Britain as
government budget cuts and an increase in value-added tax to 20
percent from 17.5 percent at the start of the year undermined
household confidence. February inflation accelerated to its
highest pace since October 2008, according to figures released
by the  Office for National Statistics .  “It’s too early to judge because it is only eight weeks
into the financial year,” Chief Executive Officer Lillian Tan
said today in a telephone interview. “You will get a clearer
picture at the half year.”  The decline in sales is a “general consumer sentiment”
issue rather than specific to Laura Ashley, Tan said. Its e-
commerce business, which represents 12 percent of U.K. sales,
will account for an increasing proportion of revenue, she said.  Laura Ashley posted record profit for the fiscal year ended
Jan. 29. Net income more than tripled to 19.8 million pounds, or
2.65 pence a share, from 5.8 million pounds, or 0.8 pence, Laura
Ashley said in the statement. Revenue rose 6.2 percent to 285
million pounds ($459 million).  The impact of the 9-Magnitude earthquake and subsequent
tsunami on its business in  Japan , where it has 80 stores, will
be “quite minimal,” Tan said. Laura Ashley has 240 stores
outside the U.K., which accounts for 90 percent of all revenue.  To contact the reporter on this story:
