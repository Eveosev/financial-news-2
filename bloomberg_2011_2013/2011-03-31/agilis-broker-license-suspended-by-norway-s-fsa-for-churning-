Agilis Securities had its license
revoked by  Norway ’s Financial Supervisory Authority for advising
retail clients to engage in too-frequent day-trading.  Breaches were uncovered during a June inspection and were
considered to be “serious and systematic” and to have
“weakened the clients confidence in the  securities market 
generally and the brokerage specifically” the Oslo-based agency
said today in a  report .  Henrik Seland, Agilis’ managing director, said the Oslo-
based broker has appealed the decision to the  Finance Ministry 
and will be able to continue operating while it’s being
considered.  “There has been a strategic evaluation of brokers in the
last nine months, which has resulted in both sanctions and that
these brokers aren’t working at the company anymore,” Seland
said by phone today. Seland said he joined the broker this year,
and the company also hired a new head of compliance.  To contact the reporter on this story:
