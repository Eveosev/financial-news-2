The economic recovery in the euro
region stabilized in March as the performance of equity markets
offset progress in output and trade, the  Eurocoin index  showed.  The index measuring economic expansion in the 17-nation
region was unchanged at 0.57 percent, the London-based  Centre
for Economic Policy Research  and the  Bank of Italy , which co-
produce the index, said in an e-mailed report today.  “The result reflects the improved performance of foreign
trade and industrial production,” according to the report. The
improvements were “partly offset by stock market trends during
March.”  The index, which includes price figures and stock-market
performances, industrial production and business and consumer
confidence readings, aims to provide a real-time estimate of
economic growth.  -- Editors: Jennifer M. Freedman, Andrew Atkinson  To contact the reporter on this story:
