Coffee planting is expanding,
allowing for “quite a bit” more supplies of beans in three
years, according to Darcy Willson-Rymer, managing director of
Starbucks Corp. for the U.K. and Ireland. Willson-Rymer spoke at
a conference in  London  today.  The difference between the price of coffee and the cost of
production is at the highest in at least 13 years, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
