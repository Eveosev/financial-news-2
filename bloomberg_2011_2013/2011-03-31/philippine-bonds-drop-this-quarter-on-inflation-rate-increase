Philippine five-year bonds fell
this quarter after the central bank raised  interest rates  for
the first time in more than two years to temper rising prices
and said it will take further measures to curb inflation.  “Inflation and rate-hike expectations dominated the
quarter,” said Bunny Bernardo-Recto, vice president for
treasury at Chinatrust Philippines Commercial Bank Corp. in
Manila.  A government report on April 5 may show consumer prices
rose 4.5 percent in March from a year earlier, the fastest pace
since April 2009, according to the median estimate of 11
economists in a Bloomberg survey. Inflation may exceed 5 percent
in some months this year and may peak in the second or third
quarter, central bank Governor Amando Tetangco said on March 29.  The yield on the 7 percent peso bond maturing January 2016
jumped 107 basis points, or 1.07 percentage points, for the
quarter to 5.7 percent, as of 4:31 p.m. in  Manila , according to
prices from Tradition Financial Services Inc. It was the first
quarterly decline in terms of the security’s price since the
debt was sold in January 2009.  Cap Losses  “Ample liquidity in the financial system will cap further
losses and even set the stage for a recovery of bonds,”
Bernardo-Recto said.  The yield on the benchmark five-year debt fell today and
this month.  Deposits  in the central bank’s overnight and special
accounts, a gauge of excess cash, climbed to 1.73 trillion pesos
($40 billion) as of March 11 from 1.72 trillion a week earlier.  Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas raised the rate it pays lenders
for overnight deposits to 4.25 percent on March 24. The next
policy meeting is on May 5. The government may need to raise the
minimum wage if inflation breaches 5 percent, President  Benigno
Aquino  said today in Batangas province.  The peso was little changed today at 43.403 per dollar,
according to Tullett Prebon Plc. The currency appreciated 0.9
percent for a third quarterly gain and reached this year’s high
of 43.268 on March 4.  To contact the reporter for this story:
