Ukraine’s government will convince
grain traders to finance the nation’s cereal harvest and make
forward purchases for exports, Agriculture Minister Mykola Prysyazhnyuk said.  “We will persuade grain traders to grow grains together
with grain producers” and to make advance payments for half of
requested outbound shipments, Prysyazhnyuk said in a statement
on the Agriculture Ministry’s  website .  The government will “confirm on the legislative level”
that no limits will apply to trading grain paid for in advance,
the minister said.  The cabinet last month drafted a bill stipulating that only
grain producers themselves and traders who make advance payments
would be allowed to sell cereals on international markets. The
government also wants to appoint so-called state agents to carry
out exports. Legislators have yet to vote on the measure.  To contact the reporter on this story:
