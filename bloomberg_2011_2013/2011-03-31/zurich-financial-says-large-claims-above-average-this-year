Zurich Financial Services AG (ZURN) ,
Switzerland’s biggest insurer, said there have been an above-
average number of large claims this year.  “In 2010, there was an above-average number of large
claims, and this year would appear to be developing along the
same lines,” Chief Executive Officer Martin Senn said today at
the company’s annual general shareholders’ meeting in Zurich.  Zurich Financial estimates total claims of about $500
million from the five natural disasters that hit the Asia-
Pacific region this year. That preliminary assessment, net of
reinsurance and before tax, is for the Brisbane floods, the
Victoria storms and cyclone Yasi in Australia, the Christchurch
earthquake in  New Zealand  and the earthquake and tsunami in
 Japan , the Zurich-based insurer said earlier today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
