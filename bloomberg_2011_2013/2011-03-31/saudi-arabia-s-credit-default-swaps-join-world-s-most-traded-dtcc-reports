Trading of credit-default swaps
linked to  Saudi Arabia  is increasing, boosting the nation to the
ranks of the world’s most active contracts for the first time,
according to the  Depository Trust & Clearing Corp.   Saudi Arabia was the 93rd most traded entity last week,
when 65 contracts changed hands, after previously being outside
of the top 1,000 tracked by DTCC. A total of 215 contracts on
the kingdom are outstanding, covering a net notional value of
$511 million, DTCC data show.  Trading is increasing even though Saudi Arabia has no
international debt, as investors seek to protect against the
risk of political turmoil in the world’s biggest oil supplier.
Swaps are being used to speculate on contagion from upheavals in
neighboring countries, as a proxy for government-controlled
companies such as petrochemical maker Saudi Basic Industries
Corp., and to hedge debt the nation may sell in future.  Swaps on  Spain  were the most active contracts last week,
with 556 trades covering a gross notional value of $9.99
billion, DTCC data show. Italy, France and  Germany  were the next
most traded by notional value. Credit-default swaps pay the
buyer face value in exchange for the underlying securities or
the cash equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
