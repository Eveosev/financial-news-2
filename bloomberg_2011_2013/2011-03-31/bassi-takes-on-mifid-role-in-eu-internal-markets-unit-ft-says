Ugo Bassi, who has headed the
asset-management group at the European Union’s internal markets
department, is assuming responsibility for securities markets,
the Financial Times reported.  That means he will take over from Maria Velentza much of
the work on the Mifid directive on markets in financial
instruments; Velentza will head a new financial stability group,
covering matters such as  crisis management , the newspaper said.  Tilman Lueder moves from the department’s intellectual
property group to take over Bassi’s old job, the FT said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
