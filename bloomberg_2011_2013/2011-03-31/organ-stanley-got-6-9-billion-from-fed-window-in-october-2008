Morgan Stanley (MS) , the securities firm
that became a  bank holding company  in 2008, borrowed as much as
$6.9 billion from the  Federal Reserve ’s discount window that
October as it leaned on U.S. aid to avoid insolvency.  Morgan Stanley borrowed $3.63 billion through  Morgan
Stanley & Co . and $3.25 billion through its Morgan Stanley Bank
N.A. subsidiary on Oct. 9, 2008, according to Fed documents
released today in response to a Freedom of Information Act
request. The firm’s borrowing from the discount window dropped
to $1.25 billion on Oct. 27, and Morgan Stanley didn’t have any
outstanding borrowings starting on Oct. 29, the data show.  The documents provide the most detailed view yet of lenders
that relied most heavily on the Fed’s primary lending program as
markets and funding seized up after Lehman Brothers Holdings
Inc. failed. The Fed agreed Sept. 21, 2008, to let Morgan
Stanley and rival  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  become bank holding
companies, giving them access to the discount window, a cheap
borrowing source traditionally reserved for commercial banks.  Morgan Stanley, the sixth-largest U.S. bank by assets,
borrowed as much as $100.5 billion at its peak on Sept. 29,
2008, from two other Fed programs, according to data the central
bank released in December of last year. That includes $61.3
billion from the Primary Dealer Credit Facility and $39.2
billion from the Term Securities Lending Facility, the data
show.  The borrowing occurred “during a time of immense financial
turmoil throughout the banking sector and the broader market,”
Morgan Stanley said in a statement on Dec. 1. Mark Lake, a
spokesman for New York-based Morgan Stanley, declined to
comment.  Total borrowing by banks using the discount window, the
Fed’s oldest lending program, rose to a record $110.7 billion in
the week ended Oct. 29, 2008, according to previously released
data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
