Demetrio Carceller, chairman of
Disa Corp. Petrolifera SA, wants to buy the 7 percent stake in
 Sacyr Vallehermoso SA (SYV) , owned by Galician savings banks known as
cajas, and become chairman of the company,  El Economista 
reported, citing unidentified people with knowledge of the
matter.  Disa, an oil-products distributor based in  Spain â€™s Canary
Islands, owns 12.9 percent of Sacyr directly and another 3
percent through its association with Grupo Satocan SA, the
newspaper said.  Carceller has the support of Juan Abello, the Spanish
investor who controls 9.6 percent of Sacyr, the newspaper added.  To contact the reporters on this story:
