New England  and the U.S. from the
Rocky Mountains to the West Coast will probably be cooler than
normal next week, the U.S.  Climate Prediction Center  said.  The center’s 6- to 10-day outlook calls for above-average
warmth in the South centered in Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama
and Georgia. Above-average rainfall is expected across the upper
Great Plains and along the southern Eastern Seaboard.  Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and Louisiana may all receive
less rain, along with the southern tip of Florida.  The center’s 8- to 14-day outlook shows a greater
probability of cooling in the Pacific Northwest, in northern
Minnesota and Wisconsin and in the six New England states.
Heavier-than-normal rain is forecast for the Pacific Northwest,
across the Great Lakes and into  New York  during the period.  The area from  Louisiana  and Texas to Nebraska and west to
the Rockies may receive less rain, according to the center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
