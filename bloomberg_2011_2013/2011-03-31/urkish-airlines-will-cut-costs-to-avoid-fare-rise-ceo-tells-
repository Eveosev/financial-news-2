Turk Hava Yollari (THYAO)  AO,  Turkey ’s
national airline, will reduce costs to avoid the need to pass on
higher fuel costs in passenger fares,  Haberturk  newspaper quoted
Chief Executive Officer Temel Kotil as saying.  Kotil didn’t specify where costs would be cut. Turkish
Airlines has allocated $100 million for advertising in 2011,
making it the biggest promoter of Turkey behind the Culture
Ministry, he said, according to the newspaper.  Turkish Airlines shares have dropped 22 percent since the
beginning of the year amid rising oil prices and turmoil across
the Middle East.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
