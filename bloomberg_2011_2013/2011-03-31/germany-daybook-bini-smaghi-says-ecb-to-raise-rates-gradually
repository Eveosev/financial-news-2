European Central Bank executive
board member Lorenzo Bini Smaghi said the central bank is
seeking to raise its benchmark interest rate gradually, another
sign borrowing costs will be increased next week.  “We are raising interest rates in a gradual way, first,”
Bini Smaghi said yesterday in an interview with Russian state-
run English-language television channel RT. “Maintaining
interest rates where they are now would mean basically becoming
more and more expansionary, which is not appropriate.”  WHAT TO WATCH:
