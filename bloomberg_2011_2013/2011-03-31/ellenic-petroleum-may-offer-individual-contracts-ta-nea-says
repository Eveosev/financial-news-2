Hellenic Petroleum SA (ELPE)  may introduce
individual work contracts by June after failing to reach new
collective work agreements with unions,  Ta Nea  said.  The company’s labor group asked for 18 percent wage
increases, compared with an offer of 4.7 percent, Ta Nea said.  Salaries at Hellenic Petroleum are already as much as 91
percent higher, and days worked lower, than at rival companies
in  Greece  and elsewhere in Europe, the newspaper said, citing
unidentified company officials.  The unions may strike for 10 days from Αpril 3, Ta Nea
reported.  To contact the reporters on this story:
