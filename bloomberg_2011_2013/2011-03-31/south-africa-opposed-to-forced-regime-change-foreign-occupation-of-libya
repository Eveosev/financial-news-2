South Africa  said there should be
no forced regime change or foreign occupation in  Libya  as it
called for an immediate ceasefire in the North African country.  “As South Africa we say ‘no’ to the killing of civilians,
‘no’ to the regime change doctrines, and ‘no’ to the foreign
occupation of Libya,” South Africa’s government spokesman,
Jimmy Manyi, told reporters in  Pretoria  today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
