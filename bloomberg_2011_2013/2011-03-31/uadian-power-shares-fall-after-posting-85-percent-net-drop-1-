Huadian Power International Co. (600027) ,
 China ’s fourth-biggest electricity producer, fell in  Hong Kong 
trading after posting an 85 percent decline in its 2010 net
profit because of higher fuel costs.  The shares dropped as much as 1.8 percent to HK$1.62 in
Hong Kong and were at $1.63 at 9:44 a.m. local time. The
benchmark  Hang Seng Index  gained 0.6 percent.  The average benchmark price for power-station coal for
immediate delivery at Qinhuangdao, China’s largest port for the
fuel, rose 25 percent last year. The government controls
electricity tariffs to contain inflation and last increased
power prices in November 2009.  “For 2011, we expect Huadian’s earnings to remain low at
287 million yuan even after factoring in a 7 percent tariff hike
from April 1 in our model, as rising fuel costs and  interest
rates  will cause significant earnings pressure given its high
operating and financial leverages,” Michael Tong, a Hong Kong-
based analyst at Deutsche Bank AG, said in a research note today.  Net income slumped to 169.9 million yuan ($25.9 million)
from 1.2 billion yuan in 2009, Huadian said in a statement
yesterday. Sales rose 24 percent to 45.2 billion yuan.  “A material increase in coal prices led to growth in
operating costs, significantly outpacing growth in operating
revenue,” Huadian said.  About 73 percent of China’s power is produced by coal-fired
generators, according to the China Electricity Council.  To contact the reporter on this story:
