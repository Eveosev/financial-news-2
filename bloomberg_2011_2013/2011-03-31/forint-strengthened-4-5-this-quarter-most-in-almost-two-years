The Hungarian forint strengthened,
extending the biggest quarterly gain for emerging-market
currencies worldwide as  Hungary ’s government planned spending
cuts to reach deficit targets.  The currency has gained 4.8 percent against the euro this
year, the most among more than 20 emerging-market currencies
tracked by Bloomberg and headed for the biggest quarterly rally
since the three months to June 2009. The forint strengthened 0.2
percent to 265.92 per euro at 11:17 a.m. in Budapest.  The currency of the European Union’s most-indebted eastern
member gained after the government on March 1 announced a three-
year plan to cut costs after relying on private pension funds
and special industry taxes to meet budget-gap targets in 2010
and 2011. Hungary, which was the first European Union member to
obtain an international bailout during the credit crisis, sold
$3.75 billion of dollar-denominated bonds last week, its largest
foreign-debt sale ever.  “The region’s assessment is quite positive and Hungary in
particular seems more and more attractive to investors,
especially because of the good yields on Hungarian  government
bonds ,” Peter Karsai and Imre Kerekgyarto, Budapest-based
traders at Commerzbank AG, said in an e-mail today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
