Non-performing loans at  SG-SSB
Ltd. (SGSSB) , the Ghanaian unit of  Societe Generale , more than doubled
to 8.5 percent of total credit last year, the bank said in a
statement today at its annual shareholder meeting in Accra.  Bad loans rose from 3.8 percent in 2009 due to the
lingering effects of the global financial crisis, Gilbert Hie,
the bank’s managing director, told the meeting.  Net income increased 9.1 percent from the previous year to
21.1 million cedis ($13.9 million) in 2010. The bank’s shares on
the Ghana Stock Exchange were unchanged at 70 pesewas as of
12:15 p.m. in Accra.  To contact the reporter on this story:
