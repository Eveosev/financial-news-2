A court in  Chile , the world’s
biggest copper-producing nation, revoked an order to close the
Ventanas copper smelter operated by state-owned Codelco.  An order issued yesterday by an appeals court in the
coastal city of Valparaiso was reversed because there isn’t
enough information that supports the decision, Chile’s judicial
authority said today in an e-mailed statement.  The halt on operations, at the request of a group of
citizens and environmentalists after a gas leak, was
“unjustified,” Codelco said in a  statement yesterday . The
company was scheduled to present legal arguments late yesterday
in a bid to resolve the case, it said.  Today’s court decision clears Codelco to stop its
preparations for shutting down Ventanas, which in 2009 produced
384,819 metric tons of copper. Codelco’s own production accounts
for 55 percent of Ventanas’ processing volume while the
remainder comes from small external producers.  Calls to Codelco’s press department in Santiago went
unanswered.  To contact the reporter on this story:
