The U.S. Export-Import Bank will
provide $49 million in financing for two solar energy projects
in  India  that will use systems from U.S. companies.  The bank authorized a $30 million loan to Dalmiapuram,
India-based project developer Dalmia Solar Power Ltd. for a 10-
megawatt  project  using solar-thermal systems from Infinia Corp.,
it said yesterday in a  statement .  Export-Import Bank, of  Washington , also will provide a $19
million loan for ACME Solar Technology (Gujarat) Pvt. to install
15 megawatts of Tempe, Arizona-based  First Solar Inc. (FSLR) â€™s thin-
film photovoltaic modules at a plant in the state of Gujarat.  The bank authorized $24.5 billion in loans, guarantees and
insurance in fiscal 2010. The bank has a mandate from Congress
to support renewable energy and has been directed to route 10
percent of its financings to clean power and environmentally
beneficial transactions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
