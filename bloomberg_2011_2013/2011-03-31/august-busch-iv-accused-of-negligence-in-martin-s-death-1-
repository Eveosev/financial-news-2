August Busch IV, the former
chairman of Anheuser-Busch Inc., was accused in a lawsuit of
carelessness and negligence in the death of Adrienne Martin, who
died while a guest at Busch’s home on Dec. 19.  The complaint was filed today in  Missouri  state court in St.
Louis County on behalf of her son, 8-year-old Blake A. Martin,
by the boy’s father, Kevin Martin.  Busch, in court papers also filed today, said Adrienne
Martin, 27, was a guest in his home the day she died. He denied
that he was careless or negligent, as well as claims that he
contributed to her death.  Maurice Graham, Busch’s attorney, couldn’t immediately be
reached by phone for comment.  John Heisserer, an attorney for the Martin family, declined
to comment.  In 2008, InBev NV bought Budweiser-maker Anheuser-Busch
Cos., based in St. Louis, for $52 billion.  Anheuser-Busch InBev
NV (ABI) , based in Leuven, Belgium, is the world’s biggest brewer.  The case is Martin v. Busch, 11SL-001294, Circuit Court of
 St. Louis  County, Missouri, 21st Judicial Circuit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
