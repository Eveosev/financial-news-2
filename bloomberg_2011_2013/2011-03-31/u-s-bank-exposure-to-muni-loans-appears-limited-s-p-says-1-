The exposure of U.S. banks to
municipal credit risk “appears limited” because loans to local
governments account for only 1 percent of their lending,
 Standard & Poor’s  said today.  “We believe that because of their limited exposure to
municipals in the overall loan book, rated U.S. banks will see a
relatively minor impact from a credit-risk perspective,” S&P
said in a report written by Rodrigo Quintanilla, a credit
analyst.  Municipal bonds account for a “significantly higher”
share of banks’ securities portfolios, ranging from 7 percent
for banks with more than $10 billion in assets to 18 percent for
smaller institutions with $1 billion to $3 billion of assets,
S&P said.  “Smaller regional banks are therefore more susceptible to
losses in their municipal portfolios in times of municipal
budgetary distress and market volatility than are the larger
banks,” S&P wrote.  To contact the reporters on this story:
