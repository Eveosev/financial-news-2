Oral arguments are set for June 8
in the Obama administration’s federal-court appeal of a ruling
in a lawsuit filed by 26 states that struck down the president’s
health-care legislation.  The Atlanta-based appeals court, in a ruling published
today, denied the states’ request for a full-panel review of
U.S. District Judge Roger Vinson’s Jan. 31 decision and said a
randomly selected three-judge panel would hear the challenge.  Vinson said the Patient Protection and Affordable Care
Act’s requirement that almost all Americans obtain medical
insurance starting in 2014 violated the U.S. Constitution.
Finding the mandate inseparable from the rest of the act, he
declared the entire measure invalid.  Signed into law by President Barack Obama a year ago, the
act is intended to create the first almost-universal U.S.
health-insurance program.  Thirteen states, led by  Florida , challenged the legislation
before Vinson in  Pensacola , Florida, federal court. Thirteen
more states later joined that effort. All 26 have appealed to
the Atlanta panel rulings by Vinson that narrowed their claims.  Stand-alone lawsuits seeking to invalidate the legislation
were filed by Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt and
Virginia Attorney General Kenneth Cuccinelli.  The 26-state case is State of Florida v U.S. Department of
Health and Human Services, 11-11021 and 11-11067, U.S. 11th
Circuit Court of Appeals (Atlanta).  To contact the reporter on this story:
