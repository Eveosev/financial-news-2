Two groups set up to monitor
 Northern Ireland ’s paramilitary organizations and oversee the
decommissioning of their arsenals have been dissolved today, the
British government said.  The Independent Monitoring Commission, which reported on
the activities of the U.K. region’s paramilitaries, and the
Independent International Commission on Decommissioning, will be
wound down, Northern Ireland Secretary of State Owen Paterson
said in an e-mailed statement.  “The time is now right to bring the commissions to a close
and the necessary arrangements have been put in place to wind
down both,” Paterson said. Both “played a crucial part in
supporting and enabling historic changes over the years.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
