Gold One International Ltd. (GDO) , the
miner of the precious metal, said it’s assessing a possible
acquisition and considering a transaction that could lead to an
offer to buy out minority shareholders.  “No binding arrangements have been entered into in
relation to the potential transactions” and no assurance can be
given the deals will proceed, the Johannesburg-based company
said in a statement today. The transactions, for which
unidentified advisers have been appointed, don’t yet warrant
disclosure as they are “incomplete” and confidential.  Gold One’s statement followed a query from  ASX Ltd. (ASX) , the
operator of  Australia ’s stock exchange, relating to a 31 percent
surge in the company’s stock between March 16 and yesterday.
Almost 8.6 million shares traded in Sydney today, the highest
this year, and 7.9 million yesterday, compared with average
daily trades over the past six months of 2.2 million.  The company cited a March 14 announcement that it will beat
first-quarter output targets, and a good response to an
international marketing campaign, among possible reasons for the
gains. The creation of Goliath Gold Mining Ltd. and Gold One’s
“low” valuation versus its peers may also have contributed, it
said, adding the potential acquisition and minority buyout are
examples of deals it evaluates from “time to time.”  Gold One’s stock traded on the Johannesburg exchange gained
14 percent to 2.90 rand in the three days to March 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
