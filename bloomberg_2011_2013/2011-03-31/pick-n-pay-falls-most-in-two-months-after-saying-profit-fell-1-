Pick n Pay Stores Ltd. (PIK) , South
Africa’s second-biggest grocer, dropped the most in two months
after saying earnings per share excluding one-time items fell as
much as 30 percent in the year through February.  The stock retreated 1.93 rand, or 4 percent, to 46.37 rand
by 10:18 a.m. in Johannesburg, the biggest drop since Jan. 31.  “Trading conditions in the second half of the year were
particularly tough due to the adverse effect of a Pick n Pay
national labor strike during our peak trading period and cost
inflation exceeding internal selling-price inflation,” the Cape
Town-based company said in a statement today.  A United Nations index of world food prices jumped to a
record last month, contributing to riots across northern  Africa 
and the Middle East that already toppled leaders in Egypt and
 Tunisia . Arabica coffee traded on ICE Futures U.S. in  New York 
almost doubled in the past year and traded at $2.648 a pound
yesterday. Raw-sugar futures advanced 64 percent to 27.23 cents
a pound in the past 12 months.  South Africa’s central bank won’t be “soft” on inflation
and will try to prevent rising oil and food costs from driving
consumer prices above the upper end of its 3 percent to 6
percent target margin, Governor Gill Marcus said March 29.  The bank said on March 24 that inflation will probably
average 4.7 percent in 2011, up from a previous estimate of 4.6
percent, and reach 5.7 percent in 2012, compared with an earlier
projection of 5.3 percent. Inflation was unchanged at 3.7
percent in February.  The company is in the process of exiting its Franklins
Australia business and sold its Score Supermarkets in  South
Africa , both of which are now disclosed as discontinued
operations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
