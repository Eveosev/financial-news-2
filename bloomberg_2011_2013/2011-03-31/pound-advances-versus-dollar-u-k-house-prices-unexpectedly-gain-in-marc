The pound slid versus the euro as
U.K. banks reported an unexpected increase in mortgage defaults
and euro-region inflation data stoked bets the  European Central
Bank  will raise  interest rates  before the Bank of England.  Sterling also fell versus the dollar as Bank of England
policy maker  David Miles  predicted a “painful transition” for
the housing market. U.K. gilts were little changed, erasing an
earlier advance.  “Defaults have risen and may continue to do so, so that
obviously might affect their decision as far as rates are
concerned,”  Elisabeth Afseth , an analyst at Evolution
Securities Ltd. in London.  The pound depreciated 0.5 percent to 88.36 pence per euro
as of 4:58 p.m. in London. It earlier reached 88.53, the weakest
level since Oct. 26. Sterling fell 0.1 percent to $1.6052, after
appreciating to $1.6152, the strongest since March 24, boosted
by data that showed  house prices  unexpectedly increased.  Sterling has fluctuated between $1.60 and $1.64 for two
months as  Bank of England  policy makers have disagreed on
whether the economy is strong enough to sustain higher borrowing
costs. The U.K.’s currency has gained about 2.9 percent against
the dollar this year and weakened 3.1 percent versus the euro.  A net 11.5 percent of respondents to the Bank of England
credit-conditions survey said the default rate on secured loans
to households rose in the first quarter, the first reading above
zero in seven quarters. A gauge for the second quarter was at
14.3, indicating lenders expect accelerating defaults.  Pound Declines  “It is not at all clear how this will play out and over
what horizon,” Miles said in a speech in  London  today,
referring to the housing market. “The link between the
decisions the Monetary Policy Committee make each month on  bank
rate  and the impact on the economy will change.”  Inflation in the 17-nation euro region quickened to 2.6
percent from 2.4 percent in February, the European Union’s
statistics office in Luxembourg said today in an initial
estimate. That’s the fastest since October 2008 and exceeds the
ECB’s 2 percent limit for a fourth month.  The yield on U.K. 10-year government bonds rose two basis
points to 3.69 percent after sliding to 3.63 percent earlier.
The 3.75 percent bond due September 2020 fell 0.165, or 1.65
pence per 1,000-pound face amount, to 100.48.  Gilts lost investors 0.8 percent this year, compared with
losses of 2.2 percent on German bonds and zero return on U.S.
Treasuries, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
