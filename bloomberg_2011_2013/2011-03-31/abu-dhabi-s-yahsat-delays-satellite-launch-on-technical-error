Yahsat, a subsidiary of Abu Dhabi
government-owned Mubadala Development Co., postponed yesterday’s
launch of satellite Y1A to a “later date” due to a technical
event, the company said.  The Ariane 5 rocket scheduled to carry the satellite into
orbit wasn’t able to launch from French Guiana, Yahsat said in
an e-mailed statement today, adding it was conducting a
technical evaluation.  The satellite is one of two the company plans to launch
this year for government, commercial and consumer satellite
communication services.  To contact the reporter on this story:
