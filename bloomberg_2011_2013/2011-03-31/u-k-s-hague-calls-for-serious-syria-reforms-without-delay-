U.K. Foreign Secretary  William Hague  said today he is watching events in  Syria  “closely” and
is “deeply concerned” by the deaths and violence in Deraa and
Latakia,’’ the U.K. Foreign and Commonwealth Office said in an
e-mailed statement.  The statement said Hague urged the Syrian government to
protect the Syrian people and respect their right to protest
peacefully, to exercise restraint, particularly by the Syrian
security forces, and for “serious political reforms to be
brought forward and implemented without delay.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
