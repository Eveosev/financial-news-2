The Dutch central bank currently
has 612 metric tons of gold and has no plans to sell, said  Nout Wellink , the bank’s president.  “We have a substantial amount in our basement and at the
moment we’re not selling and don’t have plans to sell,” Wellink
said at a press conference in Amsterdam today. “I won’t say it
will never happen again. At a certain point the policy will be
evaluated and it is connected to policy in other countries, as
we have agreements on this.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
