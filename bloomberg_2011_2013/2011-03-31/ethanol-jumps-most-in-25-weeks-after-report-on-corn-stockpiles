Ethanol jumped the most in almost
six months to cap its third quarterly gain after the U.S.
government reported corn stockpiles fell to the lowest level in
three years, signaling higher production costs for the fuel.  The grain-based gasoline additive climbed 7.3 percent on
the  Chicago  Board of Trade after the Agriculture Department said
corn inventories at the beginning of March slipped to 6.52
billion bushels, down 15 percent from a year earlier. Corn is
the main ingredient in U.S.-made ethanol.  “The big picture here was the corn stocks,” said  Dan Flynn , a trader at PFGBest in Chicago. “That’s extremely
bullish. That’s really going to be driving the ethanol.”  Denatured ethanol for April delivery advanced 18 cents to
$2.656 a gallon, the biggest one-day gain since Oct. 8 and the
highest price since July 14, 2008. Prices increased 12 percent
from January through March and have risen 72 percent in the past
year.  Futures were also boosted by a Labor Department report that
showed jobless claims declined, by a weaker dollar and by
speculation that the Libyan conflict will extend crude oil
production cuts.  A weaker dollar increases the appeal of commodities as an
alternative investment. Ethanol is part of U.S. plans to reduce
dependence on foreign oil.  Corn for May delivery jumped the exchange limit 30 cents,
or 4.5 percent, to $6.9325 a bushel in Chicago. One bushel makes
about 2.75 gallons of ethanol.  Crude for May delivery climbed $2.45 to $106.72 a barrel,
the highest settlement since Sept. 26, 2008, on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . Futures rose 17 percent in the quarter.  Gasoline for April delivery added 4.36 cents, or 1.4
percent, to settle at $3.1076 a gallon.  To contact the reporter on this story:
