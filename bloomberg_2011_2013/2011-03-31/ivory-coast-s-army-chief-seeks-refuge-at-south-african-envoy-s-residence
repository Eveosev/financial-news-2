The head of  Ivory Coast ’s army and
a key backer of incumbent leader Laurent Gbagbo asked  South
Africa  for sanctuary as fighters loyal to Alassane Ouattara, the
internationally recognized winner of last year’s elections,
closed in on the commercial capital, Abidjan.  Army Chief of Staff General Phillippe Mangou last night
sought refuge at the official residence of South Africa’s
ambassador in Ivory Coast, Zodwa Lallie, the Pretoria-based
Department of International Relations and Cooperation said.  “The general is in company of his wife and five
children,” the department said an e-mailed statement today.
“The South African government is in consultation with the
relevant parties in the Ivory Coast, Economic Community of West
African States, the African Union and the  United Nations 
regarding this matter.”  Mangou had pledged his loyalty and that of the army to
Gbagbo, even after the UN recognized Ouattara as the winner of a
Nov. 28 vote. Forces loyal to Ouattara have overrun most of the
country over the past few weeks, meeting with little resistance
from Gbagbo’s troops.  To contact the reporter on this story:
