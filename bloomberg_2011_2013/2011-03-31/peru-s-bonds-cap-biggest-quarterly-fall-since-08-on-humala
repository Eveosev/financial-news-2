Peru’s sol bonds had their biggest
quarterly decline since 2008 after  Ollanta Humala , head of the
Andean country’s Nationalist Party, surged in polls before the
first round of presidential elections.  The nation’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-denominated bond
due August 2020 fell 7.04 centimos in the past three months to
106.71 centimos per sol, the steepest drop since the quarter
ended September 2008. The yield rose 93 basis points, or 0.93
percentage point, to 6.87 percent, according to Citigroup Inc.’s
local unit. The bond’s price was unchanged today.  Rising support for Humala, an ally of Venezuela’s  Hugo
Chavez  who has pledged to increase state control of the $153
billion economy should he win election, surprised investors, who
have added a higher risk premium to Peruvian debt, said  Eduardo Suarez , a strategist at  RBC Capital Markets  in Toronto.  “Humala had almost been discounted up until the second
week of March,” Suarez said. “Most people viewed the chances
of Humala winning as much lower given how well the Peruvian
economy has been performing over the past few years. Now he’s
gaining so much going into the first round, people are just
being more cautious.”  The first round of elections is scheduled for April 10. A
runoff between the top two candidates will be held June 5 if no-
one gets more than 50 percent support in initial balloting.  The cost to protect Peruvian debt against non-payment for
five years rose 25 basis points this quarter to 139 today, 34
basis points above  Mexico . That’s the biggest difference since
October 2008. Peruvian credit default swaps were priced lower
than Mexico’s as recently as March 4.  The sol rose 0.1 percent to 2.8045 per  U.S. dollar , from
2.8075 yesterday. The currency rose 0.1 percent in the quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
