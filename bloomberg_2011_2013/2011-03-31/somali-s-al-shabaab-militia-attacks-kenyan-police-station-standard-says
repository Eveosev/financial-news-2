Members of Somalia’s al-Shabaab
militia crossed into  Kenya  and attacked a police station using a
rocket-propelled grenade, the Standard reported, citing an
unidentified police officer.  The incident occured at Liboi, about 550 kilometers (342
miles) northeast of the capital, Nairobi, the newspaper said.
Police repelled the attack and injured an unknown number of the
militia members, the Standard said.  Last week, 12 al-Shabaab militants were killed in a clash
in the border region, the newspaper said. Security has been
increased in the area, it said, citing Leo Nyongesa, the local
chief of police.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
