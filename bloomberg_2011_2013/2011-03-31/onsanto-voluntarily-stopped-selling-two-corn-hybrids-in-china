Monsanto Co. (MON) , the world’s biggest
seed company, said it voluntarily ended registration of a pair
of corn-seed hybrids in  China  because the products are no longer
sold in the country.  Removing dormant products from the seed registry is
“normal practice” and has no business impact, Kelli Powers, a
spokeswoman for St. Louis-based Monsanto, said today in a
telephone interview.  The Economic Observer reported today that China ordered a
halt to production and marketing of the Monsanto corn seeds
along with 25 local types of corn seed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
