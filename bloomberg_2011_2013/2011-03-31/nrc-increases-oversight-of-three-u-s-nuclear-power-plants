The  Nuclear Regulatory Commission 
increased oversight of three U.S. nuclear  power plants , in
Kansas, Nebraska and  South Carolina , as part of a regular safety
review.  The regulator found that the plants “required significant
additional oversight, but continue to operate safely,” said
Scott Burnell, a commission spokesman. Chairman Gregory Jaczko
told a House panel today that the plants are operating safely.  The plants are Fort Calhoun Nuclear Generating Station near
Omaha, Nebraska, the Robinson Nuclear Plant in Hartsville, South
Carolina, and Wolf Creek nuclear plant in Burlington, Kansas.
Three unidentified reactors targeted for stepped up oversight
were removed from the NRC list.  Power plants warrant additional oversight when safety
issues identified by the regulator haven’t been resolved within
a reasonable amount of time or if the underlying issue is of
“somewhat higher significance,” the NRC said in a news
release.  To contact the reporter on this story:
