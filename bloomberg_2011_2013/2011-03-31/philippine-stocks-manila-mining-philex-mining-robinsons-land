Shares of the following companies
had unusual moves in Philippine trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of 11 a.m. local time.  The Philippine Stock Exchange Index rose 21.04, or 0.5
percent, to 4,044.78. The measure is bound for a 3.7 percent
loss this quarter, ending eight quarters of gains.  Philex Mining Corp. (PX)  , the nation’s biggest producer
of metals, increased 1.8 percent to 15.08 pesos, set for the
highest close since Feb. 25. ABS-CBN reported the company is
close to reaching a joint venture agreement with  Manila Mining
Corp. (MA)  , citing Philex Chairman Manuel Pangilinan.  Manila Mining Class A shares, which are reserved for
Filipinos, gained 3.1 percent to 3.3 centavos. Pangilinan wasn’t
available to comment because he was in a meeting, an official in
his office said.  Robinsons Land Corp. (RLC)  , the nation’s second-largest
shopping mall operator, increased 1.1 percent to 11.58 pesos,
snapping a 6.7 percent, six-day loss. Robinsons will spend 41
percent of the 13.6 billion pesos ($313 million) it will raise
from a rights offer on land acquisitions, a stock exchange
filing showed. The developer will use 44 percent of the proceeds,
or about 5.96 billion pesos, to build malls, homes and
apartments, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
