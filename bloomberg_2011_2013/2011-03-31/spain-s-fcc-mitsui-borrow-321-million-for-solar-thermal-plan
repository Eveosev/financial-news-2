The Spanish construction company
 Fomento de Construcciones y Contratas SA (FCC)  and Mitsui & Co.
obtained a 226 million-euro ($321 million) loan to help finance
a solar-thermal power plant in southern Spain.  Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA (BBVA)  of Spain and the
Japanese bank Mizuho arranged the project finance loan,
Barcelona-based FCC said today in a statement.  The 50-megawatt Guzman en Palma del Rio facility began
construction in July near Cordoba and is the first joint project
for the companies using solar-thermal gear, which generates
electricity by concentrating sunlight with mirrors. The plant is
set to begin service in December 2012.  The project is 30 percent owned by Mitsui Renewable Energy
 Europe  with the rest belonging to FCC’s Energia unit, which has
421 megawatts of wind farms and 22 megawatts of solar
photovoltaic capacity.  To contact the reporter on this story:
