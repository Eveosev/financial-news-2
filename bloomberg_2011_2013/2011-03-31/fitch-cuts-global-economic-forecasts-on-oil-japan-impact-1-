Fitch Ratings  cut its global
economic growth forecasts for this year and next due to the
impact of rising  oil prices  and the earthquake and tsunami in
Japan.  The ratings company lowered its projections for growth in
the U.S., Japan and the euro area for 2011 and said global
expansion will slow to 3.2 percent from 3.8 percent in 2010,
according to a report published in  London  today.  Crude oil prices have surged about 32 percent in the past
six months, squeezing companies’ profits and undermining demand.
At the same time, the resulting surge in inflation from higher
energy costs is likely to prompt an “earlier policy response”
from central banks than previously forecast, Fitch said.  “Inflationary pressures have increased in both advanced
economies and emerging markets, exacerbating the policy dilemma
faced by many monetary policy authorities,” said Maria Malas-
Mroueh, a director in Fitch’s sovereign team.  Fitch sees the  U.S. economy , the world’s largest, growing 3
percent in 2011 and 2.8 percent in 2012, lower than the
previously forecast rates of 3.2 percent and 3.3 percent. For
Japan, Fitch cut its 2011 projection to 1 percent from 1.5
percent and raised its 2012 outlook to 2.2 percent from 1.7
percent, reflecting an increase in reconstruction spending after
the March 11 earthquake.  The euro-area economy will expand 1.2 percent this year and
1.8 percent in 2012, according to Fitch, lower than the 1.6
percent and 2.1 percent rates it projected previously.  Fitch also cut its forecasts for Brazil, China and India,
while the increase in oil prices led to a ‘small upward
revision” to  Russia ’s forecast.  To contact the reporter on this story:
