Zimbabwean Prime Minister  Morgan Tsvangirai  will today meet with regional leaders in Livingstone,
Zambia, to discuss what he describes as Zimbabwe’s
“dysfunctional” political situation.  Tsvangirai is travelling from Tanzania’s commercial
capital, Dar es Salaam, after meeting President Jakaya Kikwete.
In the last 10 days, he has met with the leaders of  South
Africa , Democratic Republic of Congo, Swaziland, Zambia,  Namibia 
and Mozambique.  The meetings were “to brief leaders in the  Southern
African Development Community  about the status of cooperation in
Zimbabwe’s unity government,” Tsvangirai’s spokesman, Nelson Chamisa, said in a phone interview from Harare yesterday.  Tsvangirai’s Movement for Democratic Change governs
Zimbabwe in a coalition with President Robert Mugabe’s Zimbabwe
African National Union-Patriotic Front. The MDC has repeatedly
accused Zanu-PF of breaking agreements and instigating violence,
charges the party denies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
