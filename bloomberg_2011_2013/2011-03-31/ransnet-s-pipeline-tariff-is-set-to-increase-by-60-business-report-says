South Africa ’s energy regulator is
expected to give Transnet Ltd. a 60 percent tariff increase for
its pipelines business, Business Report said, citing Sipho
Maseko, chief executive officer of  BP Plc (BP/) ’s Southern Africa
unit.  The increase will make local prices 400 percent higher than
the global average, the Johannesburg-based newspaper cited
Maseko as saying. Transnet first asked for a 69.2 percent rise
before revising that to 128 percent to cover higher costs, it
said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
