U.S. corn acreage this year will be
the second largest since 1944, as farm profits rise while
increasing demand for food and fuel cuts world stockpiles.
Soybean acres are forecast to drop while wheat will climb.  About 92.178 million acres (37.3 million hectares) will be
planted with corn, up 4.5 percent from 88.192 million last year
and exceeding the 91.751 million expected by analysts, the  U.S.
Department of Agriculture  said today in a report based on a
farmer survey. Futures have doubled in the past year in Chicago
as the USDA said adverse weather and rising demand would slash
world inventories to the lowest in four years.  “Even with the increase in acres projected this year, the
demand is growing fast enough that we can’t have any weather
problems,” said Charles Ring, who farms 7,000 acres in Sinton,
 Texas . Ring, 57, said he’ll raise more corn and cotton this year
because of the higher prices, while cutting acres in sorghum.  Corn futures for May delivery jumped 30 cents, the most
allowed by the Chicago Board of Trade, to close at $6.9325 a
bushel at 1:15 p.m. local time after a separate USDA report
showed lower-than-expected inventories. The 4.5 percent gain was
the most in two weeks.  Stockpiles at the start of the month totaled 6.523 billion
bushels, down 15 percent from a year earlier and less than the
6.688 billion expected by analysts, the USDA said.  Soybean Acreage  Farmers will cut soybean acres by 1 percent to 76.609
million, the USDA said, close to analysts’ expectations. Total
wheat acres may climb 8.2 percent from last year to 58.021
million compared with analysts’ expectations of 57.239 million.
About 14.427 million acres will be planted with spring wheat, up
5.3 percent from last year, the department said.  Rising crop prices will lift U.S. farm income to $94.7
billion this year, the highest ever, the USDA said on Feb. 14.
Global food costs reached a record last month, according to the
 United Nations . High food prices and corruption have spurred
unrest in northern  Africa  and the Middle East, ousting leaders
in Tunisia and  Egypt , the world’s biggest wheat importer.  Soybean futures for May delivery jumped 38.25 cents, or 2.8
percent, to $14.1025 a bushel in Chicago. Wheat futures for May
delivery climbed 36 cents, or 5 percent, to $7.6325 a bushel.  Soybean prices have advanced 50 percent in the past year,
while wheat jumped 64 percent.  Stockpiles of soybeans as of March 1 dropped 1.7 percent
from a year earlier to 1.249 billion bushels, the lowest for the
date since 2003, the USDA said today. Wheat inventories
increased 5.1 percent to 1.425 billion bushels.  Profitable Corn  Farmers are planting more corn because price gains for that
crop have outpaced increases for soybeans and wheat, said Darrel Good, an agricultural economist at the  University of Illinois  at
Urbana-Champaign. Growers in central  Illinois  can make about
$189 more per acre on corn than soybeans on high-productivity
farmland, the university’s data show.  This year’s corn acreage will be the second highest in 67
years, trailing 2007, USDA data show. Acres may increase the
most in  South Dakota ,  Iowa  and  North Dakota , the department
said. Parts of North Dakota and South Dakota have more than 9
inches (23 centimeters) of  snow  on the ground, threatening to
delay planting, according to the  National Weather Service .  Watching Weather  “If the weather is sour in the Dakotas, and that corn
acreage doesn’t get planted, it may go to beans or maybe
something else,” said  Hussein Allidina , the head of commodity
research at Morgan Stanley in  New York .  Farmers will plant 3.018 million acres with rice, down 17
percent from 2010, the department said. Oats acreage may fall
9.5 percent to a record low 2.839 million.  The USDA acreage estimates were based on a nationwide
survey of 85,000 farmers taken in the first two weeks of March.  The amount of corn used to make  ethanol  may climb this year
to a record 4.95 million bushels, about 40 percent of the 2010
crop, and demand from food processors and livestock producers
also is growing, USDA data show.  “We’ve pulled down our safety stocks, so we’re dependent
upon a good crop,” said Kelly Wiesbrock, a portfolio manager
with San Francisco-based hedge fund Harvest Capital Strategies,
which manages about $1.3 billion. “I don’t want to sound alarm
bells, but we’re definitely more susceptible to supply-side
shocks, if we have a bad corn crop this year in the U.S.”  Overseas purchases of agricultural products from the U.S.,
the largest exporter of corn, soybeans, wheat and cotton, jumped
18 percent to a record $115.81 billion in 2010, the government
said earlier this month.  China  became the largest market for
U.S. farm goods for the first time, as shipments increased by 34
percent to $17.5 billion, the data show.  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $66.7 billion in
2010, government figures show. Soybeans ranked second at $38.9
billion, and wheat was fourth at $13 billion, behind hay. The
U.S. is the largest exporter of corn, wheat and soybeans.  To contact the reporter on this story:
