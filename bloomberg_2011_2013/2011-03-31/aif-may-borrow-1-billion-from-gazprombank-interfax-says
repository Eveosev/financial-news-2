TAIF, an investment group based in
 Russia ’s Tatarstan region, may borrow as much as 30 billion
rubles ($1.06 billion) from OAO Gazprombank to refinance loans,
Interfax said, citing an identified person familiar with the
deal.  The funds will be used to refinance credit lines from OAO
Sberbank in 2009 to restructure debts at TAIF’s Kazanorgsintez
petrochemicals plant, Interfax said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
