Endesa SA (ELE) , the Spanish utility
thatâ€™s controlled by  Enel SpA (ENEL) , said it agreed to sell its
systems and telecommunications business to an Enel unit for 250
million euros ($356 million).  The sale to Enel Energy Europe SRL will generate a gross
capital gain of 170 million euros for Endesa, the Madrid-based
company said today in a regulatory filing.  Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA advised Endesa on the
deal, providing a valuation of the assets, according to a
spokeswoman for the bank who asked not to be named in line with
company policy.  To contact the reporters on this story:
