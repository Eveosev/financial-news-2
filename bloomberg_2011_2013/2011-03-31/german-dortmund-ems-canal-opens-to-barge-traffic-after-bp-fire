Germany ’s Dortmund-Ems canal, which
connects the port of Bremen to the Rhine River, is open to barge
traffic following an accident earlier this week at BP Plc’s
Lingen oil refinery that closed the waterway for two days.  The canal opened at 4 p.m. local time today, Bernhard
Hermes, a spokesman for the local shipping office, said by phone
from Meppen, Germany. The canal was closed after a barge being
filled with gasoline from Lingen caught fire and sank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
