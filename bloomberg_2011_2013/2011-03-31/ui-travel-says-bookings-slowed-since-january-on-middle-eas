TUI Travel Plc,  Europe ’s largest
tour operator, said summer bookings remain higher than last year
and that growth has slowed since January as the company canceled
flights to the Middle East.  Cumulative bookings as of March 27 rose 2 percent in the
U.K. compared with a year earlier, Crawley, England-based TUI
Travel said today in a statement. They were up 8 percent as of
Jan. 16. Bookings rose 11 percent in  Germany , compared with a 16
percent increase as of Jan. 16.  “Since our last update, trading has been in line with our
expectations against a tough comparative period,” Chief
Executive Officer Peter Long said in the statement.  TUI Travel and smaller competitor  Thomas Cook Group Plc (TCG) 
canceled flights to Egypt and Tunisia and excursions within
those countries amid political unrest. TUI reiterated today that
the cost of cutting trips to the two countries and of
repatriating customers may cut profit by as much as 30 million
pounds ($48 million) in the second quarter.  TUI Travel, which is controlled by German parent  TUI AG (TUI1) ,
has slipped 7 percent this year in London trading, giving the
company a market value of 2.6 billion pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
