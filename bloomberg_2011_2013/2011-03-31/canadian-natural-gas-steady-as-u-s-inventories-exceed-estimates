Canadian natural gas prices were
little changed after a U.S. Energy Department report showed
inventories increased last week.  U.S. stockpiles of the fuel rose 12 billion cubic feet, or
0.7 percent, to 1.624 trillion, about 68 billion above the five-
year average, the Energy Department reported in  Washington .
Analysts in a Bloomberg survey estimated stocks would fall 2
billion cubic feet.  Demand for heat in the U.S. will average 3 percent above
normal for the next week, according to Weather Derivatives.
Temperatures will be 1 degree Fahrenheit (0.6 Celsius) warmer
than normal from April 7 to April 11, the Belton, Missouri-based
forecaster said.  Alberta  gas for May delivery fell 0.75 cents, or 0.2
percent, to C$3.59 per gigajoule ($3.51 per million British
thermal units) as of 3:11 p.m. New York time, according to  NGX, 
a Canadian Internet market. Gas traded on the exchange is
shipped to users in  Canada  and the U.S., and is priced on
TransCanada’s Alberta system.  Natural gas for May delivery on the  New York  Mercantile
Exchange rose 3.4 cents, or 0.8 percent, to settle at $4.389 per
million Btu.  Volume on  TransCanada Corp.’s  Alberta system, which
collects the output of most of the nation’s gas wells, was 16.3
billion cubic feet as of 2 p.m. in New York, about 46 million
below target. Volume on the system, or linepack, fell 62 million
cubic feet in the past four hours.  Empress, McNeil  Gas was flowing at a daily rate of 3.42 billion cubic feet
at Empress, Alberta, where the fuel is transferred to
TransCanada’s main line.  At McNeil, Saskatchewan, where gas is transferred to the
Northern Border Pipeline for shipment to the Chicago area, the
daily flow rate was 1.68 billion cubic feet.  Available capacity on TransCanada’s British Columbia system
at Kingsgate was 518 million cubic feet. The system was forecast
to carry 1.68 billion cubic feet today, about 76 percent of its
capacity of 2.2 billion.  The volume on  Spectra Energy’s  British Columbia system,
which gathers the fuel in northeastern British Columbia for
delivery to  Vancouver  and the Pacific Northwest, totaled 2.95
billion cubic feet at 10:20 a.m. High linepack prompted Spectra
to warn shippers not to add more gas to the system than their
contracts allow.  To contact the reporters on this story:
