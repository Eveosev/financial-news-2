Mauritius’s statistics office
raised its forecast for economic growth this year to 4.5
percent, led by expansion in the textile industry and financial
services, the agency said.  The estimate compares with the 4.2 percent forecast in
December and growth of 4.4 percent last year, the Port Louis-
based  Central Statistics Office  said in a statement on its
website today.  Investment in the Indian Ocean island nation’s economy will
probably climb to 81.5 billion rupees ($2.9 billion) this year
from 74.4 billion rupees in 2010 on new road infrastructure and
airport expansion, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
