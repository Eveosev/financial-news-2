Newron Pharmaceuticals SpA (NWRN)  will
develop two of  Merck KGaA (MRK) ’s neurological compounds, broadening
the companies’ collaboration.  Bresso, Italy-based Newron now holds the rights to develop
pruvanserin and sarizotan, two drugs that act on
neurotransmitters in the brain, the companies said in a
statement today. Darmstadt, Germany-based Merck has the right to
reclaim the drugs, with Newron keeping a co-development option,
the companies said. No further details were given.  Merck and Newron are already collaborating on the
experimental Parkinson’s drug safinamide.  To contact the reporter on this story:
