Radiation levels in the U.K. are
normal and extra testing isn’t needed to protect the  food
supply , the  Food Standards Agency  said, as concern spreads about
the Japanese nuclear crisis.  Shipments from  Japan , which account for only 0.1 percent of
all food imports, are being screened for radioactive material,
Terry Donohoe, a food-safety expert at the agency, said today in
an e-mail. U.K. importers buy mostly fish and shellfish from
Japan, he said.  Radiation levels that were higher than normal were found in
Japanese soil and milk after the country’s worst-recorded
earthquake caused a nuclear plant to leak radioactive material.
California officials said today they found trace amounts of
radioactive iodine 131 from Japan in a milk sample. The levels
detected pose no threat to humans, the Department of  Public
Health  said.  “Background levels of radiation are monitored routinely in
this country and this has not picked up any levels that require
additional testing of U.K.-produced food,” Donohoe said in the
e-mail. “The Food Standards Agency is working with port health
authorities and other government departments to ensure that food
imports from Japan, mainly fish and shellfish, are screened for
the presence of radioactive material.”  The magnitude-9.0 earthquake struck on March 11, crippling
the Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear power plant, which is operated by
Tokyo Electric Power Co. The quake and subsequent tsunami has
left 28,000 people dead or missing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
