Polish employers are more
pessimistic about economic growth than they were at the end of
last year, with 32 percent of transport and logistics companies
planning to cut jobs, a poll showed.  Twenty percent of the 300 companies surveyed by  Randstad
Holding NV (RAND)  and Warsaw-based pollster TNS OBOP expect a recession
within six months, while 47 percent predict stagnation and 24
percent foresee growth. In November last year only 13 percent
saw a recession in the next two quarters, while 37 percent
thought the economy would expand.  According to the survey, 62 percent of companies are
expecting to keep their staff count unchanged, while 24 percent
said they would increase employment over the next six months.
That compares with an increase in hiring at 30 percent of the
surveyed companies in the previous six months.  The poll of companies employing more than 10 staff was
conducted Feb. 9-17. The margin of error was given at 5.6
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
