The Irish government is considering
combining EBS Building Society, the country’s fifth-biggest
lender, with  Allied Irish Banks Plc (ALBK) , the second largest, as part
of a restructuring of the country’s banks, according to two
people with knowledge of the situation.  An announcement may come as soon as today after Irish
authorities publish the results of bank stress tests, said the
people, who declined to be identified because the matter isn’t
yet public.  Irish Finance Minister  Michael Noonan  decided yesterday to
scrap the sale of state-owned EBS to a group including U.S.
billionaire Wilbur Ross’s leveraged-buyout firm and Dublin-based
 Cardinal Capital Group . The government said in December it was
taking a 93 percent stake in Allied Irish, while it seized full
control of EBS in May.  The Irish  Central Bank  will publish results at 4:30 p.m. of
the stress tests, which may require the government to inject
another 27.5 billion euros ($39.1 billion) of capital into the
banks, according to the median estimate of 10 analysts surveyed 
by Bloomberg News.  Officials from Allied Irish, EBS and the  Finance Ministry 
in Dublin declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
