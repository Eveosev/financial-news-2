Ethiopia ’s main opposition group
listed the names of 68 people detained in the Oromia region over
the past month.  The majority of the arrests took place on March 13 and 14,
Medrek, a six-member coalition of opposition groups, said in a
statement handed to reporters today in the capital, Addis Ababa.
Those arrested in towns mostly in the West Shoa and East Wollega
areas were either opposition activists or sympathizers,
spokesman Beyene Petros said.  Police arrested 121 people in the Oromia region this month,
all of whom were members of the banned, Eritrea-based Oromo
Liberation Front, government spokesman  Shimeles Kemal  said in a
phone interview yesterday, revising downward a figure of 200
arrests he gave a day earlier.  Medrek said the detentions may be related to government
fears of unrest, though the opposition group isn’t advocating
anti-government protests, Beyene said.  “The fact that it was directed at politically related
people is a basis for suspicion this is pre-emptive,” Beyene
said.  Oromos are the largest ethnic group in Ethiopia. The
OLF has waged a 38-year campaign for autonomy in Oromia, the
largest of Ethiopia’s nine federal states.  To contact the reporter on this story:
