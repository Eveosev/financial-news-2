The Spanish region of Catalonia
won’t step up spending cuts to meet central-government demands
to reach its  budget-deficit  goal, said Catalan finance chief,
Andreu Mas-Colell.  Catalonia, which exceeded the deficit goal last year with a
shortfall equivalent to 3.9 percent of its gross domestic
product, has pledged to cut non-financial spending 10 percent
this year.  The regional government, which took office after elections
in November, won’t accelerate that, Mas-Colell said in an
interview with Catalan broadcaster  RAC1  yesterday. The comments
were published on RAC1’s website and confirmed by Mas-Colell’s
department in Barcelona.  Catalonia is the biggest of  Spain ’s 17 semi-autonomous
regions, which control health and education spending and hire
half of all public workers. Its budget deficit was the fourth
largest last year after the new government said the shortfall
would be larger than the previous administration had expected.  A finance ministry official in  Madrid  said all regions had
committed to the deficit target of 1.3 percent of GDP for 2011
after a target of 2.4 percent in 2010. Spain targets an overall
budget deficit of 6 percent this year, compared with 9.2 percent
last year, when the central government’s better-than-expected
result offset slippage in the regions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
