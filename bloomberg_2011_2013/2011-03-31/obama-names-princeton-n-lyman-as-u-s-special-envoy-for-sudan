President Barack Obama appointed
Princeton Lyman, a former ambassador to Nigeria and  South
Africa , as his special envoy for  Sudan .  Lyman is replacing  Scott Gration , who is being nominated as
the U.S. ambassador to Kenya, the White House said in a news
release.  Lyman has been the State Department’s senior adviser on
Sudan North-South negotiations since August. He worked with
Gration as part of the U.S. diplomatic effort before an
independence referendum for South Sudan in January.  Lyman will oversee U.S. support for implementation of
Sudan’s 2005 peace agreement, reduced tensions between north and
south over the status of the disputed border region of Abyei,
the independence of South Sudan set for July, and an end to the
conflict in Darfur, the White House statement said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
