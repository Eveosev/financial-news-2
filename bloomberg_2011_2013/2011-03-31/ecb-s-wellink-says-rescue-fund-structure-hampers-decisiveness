The permanent European rescue fund
may find it hard to act decisively as measures must be adopted
unanimously, according to European Central Bank Governing
Council member Nout Wellink.  The European Stability Mechanism “will depend on
intergovernmental decision making, meaning unanimity is
required,” he said at a press conference in Amsterdam today.
“When there’s a difficult case on the table, one country is
enough to block any resolution. That is a mechanism that doesn’t
work well in crisis circumstances.”  The fund, or ESM, will replace the temporary European
Financial Stability Facility, which forms the bulk of the 750
billion euro ($1.1 trillion) bailout pool agreed by European
leaders nearly a year ago. The ESM will take effect in 2013.  Portugal  and  Greece  were downgraded on March 29 by  Standard
& Poor’s , which said new European Union bailout rules may mean
that both nations eventually renege on their debt obligations.  Wellink, who also heads the Dutch central bank, said
Portugal is “a difficult case” following the resignation of
Prime Minister  Jose Socrates  on March 23. “The situation got
even more complicated as it may take a while before new
elections can take place.”  While Portuguese bond yields have soared this week, Wellink
said it’s encouraging that Spanish yields have not risen. “That
leaves the impression that this country’s credibility for the
financial market has become a lot more positive than a year
ago,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
