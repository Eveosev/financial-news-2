Middle East crude for sale to  Asia 
rose a second day on concern that prolonged production losses in
Libya will reduce spare production capacity in the region.  Oman oil for immediate loading advanced 0.5 percent, or 54
cents, to $109.85 a barrel at 6:01 p.m. in Singapore, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. Dubai crude for loading in May
gained 0.5 percent to $109.47 and Murban crude was up the same
amount at $113.06.  Prices rose after troops loyal to leader  Muammar Qaddafi 
forced rebels to retreat and as the U.S. and U.K. said they may
arm opposition forces. The conflict has reduced oil exports from
the country,  Africa ’s third largest producer, to a “trickle”
according to the  International Energy Agency .  Qatar Marine for May loading was at a discount of 9 cents a
barrel to its official selling price, unchanged from yesterday.
Murban, produced by Abu Dhabi National Oil Co., was also
unchanged at a premium of 23 cents to its OSP.  Spare production capacity in  Saudi Arabia , the biggest
producer in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries,
will fall below 2 million barrels a day from about 3.25 million
earlier this year as the conflict in Libya disrupts supplies,
Deutsche Bank AG said in a report yesterday.  Oman futures for May delivery increased 54 cents to $109.64
a barrel on the  Dubai Mercantile Exchange  at 5:41 p.m.  Singapore 
time, with 517 contracts traded. The settlement price was set at
$109.64 a barrel at 12:30 p.m. in Dubai.  The Brent-Dubai exchange of futures for swaps, or EFS, for
May widened 2 cents to $6.52 a barrel, according to data from
PVM Oil Associates, a London-based broker.  To contact the reporter on this story:
