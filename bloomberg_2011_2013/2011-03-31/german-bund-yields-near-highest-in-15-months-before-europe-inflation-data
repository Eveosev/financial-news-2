Portuguese bonds sank, driving the
yields on two-, five- and 10-year securities to records as the
country’s president prepared to call early elections amid
concern it will need a financial bailout.  Irish debt slid, pushing the 10-year yield to the highest
since the introduction of the euro as regulators said four banks
need to raise an extra 24 billion euros ($34 billion) in
capital. Losses on the Portuguese two-year note pushed the yield
above that on 10-year securities for the first time since 2006,
signaling increased concern that the nation will default on its
debt. German bunds fell after data showed European inflation
unexpectedly rose to the fastest pace in more than two years.  “Concern about the sovereign-risk factor is reflected more
in the widening yield spreads,” said  Orlando Green , assistant
director of capital-markets strategy at Credit Agricole
Corporate & Investment Bank in London.  Stress tests “are a
potential driver for sentiment in the near term. There’s still
the unresolved political situation in Portugal.”  Portugal’s two-year yield surged 75 basis points to 8.78
percent as of 4:42 p.m. in London, the most since 1996,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The 10-year yield rose
for the eighth straight day, climbing 30 basis points to 8.4
percent. Irish two-year note yields climbed 34 basis points to
9.87 percent, while the 10-year yield was at 10.18 percent after
earlier rising to 10.32 percent.  Default Swaps  The extra yield, or spread, investors demand to hold Irish
10-year bonds instead of similar maturity German bunds climbed
to a record. The spread widened six basis points to 682 basis
points, after being as high as 699 basis points, the most since
Bloomberg started collecting the data in 1991.  The premium investors demand to hold Portuguese 10-year
 government bonds  instead of benchmark German bunds climbed 27
basis points to 5.03 percentage points, after reaching 5.08
percentage points, the most since before the introduction of the
euro in 1999.  Portuguese President Anibal Cavaco Silva is scheduled to
consult former leaders today, the last hurdle to calling early
elections. The country’s bonds have slumped since Prime Minister
 Jose Socrates  resigned on March 23 after opposition parties
rejected his deficit-cutting plan.  Portuguese bonds stayed lower after the nation reported a
budget deficit of 8.6 percent of gross domestic product last
year, missing a government target of about 7 percent.  Credit-Default Swaps  Finance Minister Fernando Teixeira Dos Santos signaled last
week that the deficit might be higher than forecast after the
European Union’s statistics office imposed region-wide
accounting changes that prompted  Portugal  to add some costs
related to a 2008 bank failure to last year’s accounts. The
shortfall for 2009 was revised to 10 percent from 9.3 percent.  The cost of insuring Portuguese sovereign debt jumped as
much as 13 basis points to a record 579, according to CMA prices
for credit-default swaps.  Inflation in the 17-nation euro region quickened to 2.6
percent in March from 2.4 percent in February, European Union
estimates showed today. That’s the fastest since October 2008
and exceeds the ECB’s 2 percent limit for a fourth month.
Economists forecast inflation to hold steady, the median of 32
estimates in a Bloomberg survey showed.  The German 10-year bund yield rose two basis points to 3.36
percent after falling to as low as 3.32 percent before the
inflation data. The yield reached 3.37 percent earlier, the most
since Jan. 11, 2010. German two-year yields gained four basis
points to 1.78 percent after jumping to 1.80 percent, the
highest since March 4.  German Notes Fall  ECB President  Jean-Claude Trichet  signaled earlier this
month that the bank may raise its key interest rate next month
to tame inflation.  Euribor futures dropped, sending the yield on the contract
expiring in December up five basis points to 2.10 percent,
indicating traders are adding to bets for higher borrowing costs
from the Frankfurt-based central bank. The rate rose earlier to
as much as 2.115 percent, the highest since March 10.  German government bonds have handed investors a loss of 2.2
percent this year, indexes compiled by the European Federation
of Financial Analysts Societies and Bloomberg show. Portuguese
debt is the worst performer among the euro-region nations,
dropping 7.7 percent this year, while Irish securities have lost
4.9 percent. Spanish debt is the best performing, returning a
profit of 2.7 percent through March 30.  To contact the reporters on this story:
