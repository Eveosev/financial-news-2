Crude oil , gasoline and heating oil
rose to the highest levels since 2008 after troops loyal to
Libyan leader  Muammar Qaddafi  retook control of the oil port of
Ras Lanuf, adding to concern that production from the North
African country wouldn’t resume soon. Ethanol advanced after
corn stockpiles fell to the lowest level in three years.  Crude Oil  Crude oil for May delivery rose $2.45, or 2.3 percent, to
$106.72 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, finishing
the quarter with a gain of 17 percent. Crude has gained 27
percent in the past year.  Gasoline  Gasoline for April delivery rose 4.36 cents, or 1.4
percent, to $3.1076 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange , the highest settlement since July 2008. The more
actively traded May contract added 5.04 cents, or 1.7 percent,
to $3.1077 a gallon. April contracts for gasoline and heating
oil expired today.  “This Libyan situation just guarantees us $4 gasoline,”
said  James Cordier , portfolio manager at OptionSellers.com in
Tampa, Florida. “We’re not putting a high in the market at all.
Speculators just have nothing to fear. Just go long.”  Heating Oil  Heating oil for April delivery added 5.02 cents, or 1.7
percent, to $3.0898 a gallon on the exchange, the highest
settlement since Aug. 28, 2008. Heating oil rose 21 percent in
the three months ended today, its third consecutive quarterly
increase. The May contract advanced 5.91 cents, or 1.9 percent,
to $3.1125.  Ethanol  Denatured ethanol for April delivery soared 18 cents, or
7.3 percent, to $2.656 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade
after the Agriculture Department said corn inventories at the
beginning of March slipped to 6.52 billion bushels, down 15
percent from a year earlier. Ethanol has increased 72 percent in
the past year.  Refineries and Transport  Enbridge Inc. (ENB)  shut a section of its 12-inch Stingray
offshore pipeline after a barge hit the pipeline and declared
force majeure “until the issue is resolved,” the company said
on its website.  Valero Energy Corp. (VLO)  shut a hydrocracker at its Port Arthur
refinery in Texas to repair a compressor seal leak, Bill Day, a
company spokesman, said in a telephone interview.  BP Plc is restarting a hydrotreater at its Carson refinery
in  California , according to a person with knowledge of the
situation. The unit was shut earlier this month for repairs.  Chevron Corp. (CVX)  plans to flare gases at its El Segundo,
California, refinery starting tomorrow through April 5,
according to a filing with regulators.  To contact the reporter on this story:
