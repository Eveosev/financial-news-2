Banque Privée Edmond de Rothschild
SA, the Geneva-based wealth manager founded in 1953, said full-
year profit rose 9.6 percent as net new money inflows offset the
Swiss franc’s strength against the euro and the dollar.  Net income rose to 149.9 million Swiss francs ($163.4
million) from 136.8 million francs in 2009, the bank said in a
statement today. The wealth manager attracted 6.5 billion francs
of net inflows while client assets advanced to 92.7 billion
francs from 92.2 billion francs.  The bank is chaired by Baron Benjamin de Rothschild, the
sixth generation since Mayer Amschel Rothschild and his five
sons bankrolled European governments in the 19th century.
Rothschild has hired wealth managers in Latin America,  Asia  and
its home town to build client assets.  Last year “brought continuing pressure on banking secrecy
and heavier regulation of  wealth management ,” the bank said in
the statement. “We were able to continue growing thanks to a
prudent investment policy.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
