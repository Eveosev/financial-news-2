Stuttgart prosecutors are
investigating a Landesbank Baden-Wuerttemberg trader for
possible market manipulation, the office’s spokeswoman Claudia
Krauth said in an interview today.  Krauth declined to comment further. The man, who worked in
the “Equity Derivatives” section allegedly caused a low
single-digit million euros loss for the bank,  Handelsblatt 
reported earlier, citing unidentified people in the bank. The
trader was fired at the end of last year, according to
Handelsblatt.  LBBW spokesman Bernd Wagner declined to comment when
contacted by Bloomberg News.  To contact the reporter on this story:
