U.K. greenhouse gas emissions rose
2.84 percent in 2010, the biggest gain in at least two decades,
as homes used more heating fuel in a year with record cold.  Preliminary data show output of the six  greenhouse gases 
covered by the 1997  Kyoto Protocol  climate protection treaty
rose to 582.4 million metric tons of carbon-dioxide equivalent
from 566.3 million tons in 2009, the U.K. Department for Energy
and Climate Change  said today  in an e-mailed statement. That was
the biggest percentage gain in a series starting in 1990.  Emissions from British homes rose 13 percent as they burned
more natural gas for heating last year, the department said. The
U.K. had its coolest year since 1986, and 2010 ended with the
coldest December since at 1910, when record started.
Temperatures averaging minus 1 degree Celsius (30 degrees
Fahrenheit), according to the  Met Office , the government weather
service.  “Britain is blighted by inefficient and draughty homes,”
U.K. Energy and Climate Secretary  Chris Huhne  said in an e-
mailed statement. “We want to help people waste less energy
through the Green Deal and install new cleaner technologies to
heat their homes,” he said, referring to government plans to
incentivize housing insulation.  Last year’s emissions gain exceeded the increase of 2.82
percent in 1996. The data published doesn’t extend beyond 1990,
the base year for the Kyoto Protocol. It followed the biggest
decline in emissions on record in 2009 as the economic downturn
crimped output and production.  Last year’s emissions increase also reflected the closure
for maintenance of nuclear plants, forcing utilities to use more
fossil-fuels for power generation, the government said.  ‘Should be Falling’  “Climate-changing pollution should be falling, not going
up,” Doug Parr, chief scientist for Greenpeace, the
environmental lobby group, said in an e-mailed statement. “What
these figures show is that the U.K. is moving in the wrong
direction. Politicians can’t blame it on the beginnings of the
economic recovery because whilst the economy has grown slowly,
 carbon emissions  have grown faster.”  European Union carbon permits for December rose as much as
1.6 percent today to 17.33 euros ($25) a ton, near the highest
price in two years, on the ICE Futures Europe exchange in
 London .  To contact the reporters on this story:
