U.K. mothers are more likely to
work full time than they were 15 years ago, according to the
 Office for National Statistics.   A gap in employment rates between mothers and women who
don’t have dependent children has almost closed, the department
said in a statement on its website.  By the end of 2010, 66 percent of mothers and 67 percent of
women without children or teenagers were employed, the ONS said.
That compares with 61 percent for mothers and 67 percent for
women with children in 1996, it said.  “Over 15 years, the proportion of mothers working part-
time hasn’t changed much, but the number of full-timers has
risen markedly, which is what’s driving the increase in working
mothers,” Jamie Jenkins, an ONS statistician, said in the
statement.  By the end of last year, 29 percent of mothers worked full-
time, up from 23 percent in 1996, the agency said.  Mothers with partners are more likely to work. Sixty-three
percent of those with children four years of age or less worked
if they had partners, while only 36 percent of single mothers
with small children worked, the ONS said.  Mothers with partners are more likely to work outside the
home because they can share child-care, Jenkins said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
