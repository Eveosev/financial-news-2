AS Tallinna Vesi (TVEAT) ,  Estonia â€™s biggest
water utility, said it lodged a complaint with the European
Commission about measures by Estonian authorities which,
according to the company, violate the terms of its sale to
investors.  The commission has sent a request for information about the
complaint to the Estonian authorities, setting the deadline for
a reply at the beginning of May, the Tallinn-based company said
in a regulatory statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
