U.S.  Gulf Coast  crude premiums
strengthened against West Texas Intermediate as Brent oil’s
differential to the U.S. benchmark was little changed.  The gap between May-delivery WTI futures and Brent, its
European counterpart, widened 8 cents to $10.97 a barrel at 1:33
p.m. in  New York . A wider gap between Brent and WTI strengthens
the value of low-sulfur U.S. grades that compete with West
African oil priced against Brent.  Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium to WTI widened 50 cents to
$13.25 a barrel at 11:46 a.m. in New York, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Light Louisiana Sweet gained 65 cents to
$13.75 over the benchmark.  Mars Blend’s premium widened 15 cents to $7 a barrel over
WTI. Poseidon’s premium gained 5 cents to $7.20. Southern Green
Canyon’s premium strengthened 60 cents to $6.60. Thunder Horse
was unchanged at $10.75 above WTI.  West  Texas  Sour’s discount narrowed 10 cents to $3.15 a
barrel. It has tracked more closely to its historical average
discount versus WTI because it’s delivered in Midland, Texas,
away from the Gulf Coast and close to Cushing.  Canadian Syncrude’s premium gained 65 cents to $12.40 a
barrel. The discount for Western Canada Select widened 70 cents
to $16.45 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
