U.K. Business Minister Ed Davey may
announce changes to so-called “pre-pack administrations”
today as part of proposed insolvency-law revisions, the
Financial Times reported, citing remarks by Davey.  The changes would require administrators of insolvent
companies to give creditors three days notice before selling off
significant portions of the companies’ assets to a connected
party, meaning creditors could block the sale in certain cases,
the FT said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
