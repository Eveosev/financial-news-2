Australia’s dollar rose to a record
versus its U.S. counterpart and  New Zealand ’s dollar gained
against most major peers as investors bought higher-yielding
currencies on speculation economic growth is improving.  The two South Pacific currencies advanced as U.S. payrolls
rose more than forecast, burnishing investor appetite for
riskier assets. They also strengthened amid signs Japan will
keep monetary policy loose to spur the economy and after data
showed China’s manufacturing grew at a faster pace last month.
Commodities rose.  “The Aussie is strong because of the commodity picture,”
said Alex Sinton, a senior dealer at ANZ National Bank Ltd. in
Auckland, New Zealand.  The Australian dollar gained 0.5 percent to $1.0375 at
12:36 p.m. in  New York , from $1.0329 yesterday. It touched
$1.0389, the highest level since it was first freely traded in
1983.  Australia ’s dollar climbed as much as 2 percent to 87.60
yen, the strongest level since May 4, before trading at 87.42,
from 85.87 yen yesterday.  The kiwi, as the  New Zealand dollar  is nicknamed,
appreciated 0.6 percent to 76.60 U.S. cents, from 76.15 cents.
New Zealand’s dollar rose 1.9 percent to 64.52 yen from 63.31
yen. It earlier climbed 2.1 percent to 64.66 yen, the highest
level since Nov. 22.  The Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of raw materials increased
as much as 0.5 percent today. It has gained 8.2 percent this
year on prospects that strengthening growth worldwide will boost
demand for commodities, which account for a majority of
Australia and New Zealand’s shipments.  China  Index  China’s Purchasing Managers Index rose to 53.4 in March
from 52.2 in February, the China Federation of Logistics and
Purchasing said. China is Australia’s largest trading partner
and New Zealand’s second-biggest export destination.  U.S. employers added 216,000 jobs last month after a
revised 194,000 gain in February, Labor Department data showed
today in  Washington . Economists forecast a gain of 190,000,
according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey.  Australia’s dollar rose 1.1 percent against the greenback
this week and yesterday completed a third straight quarter of
gains, advancing 0.9 percent. The kiwi climbed 1.7 percent since
March 25. It dropped 2.4 percent in the first quarter.  Benchmark interest rates are 4.75 percent in Australia and
2.5 percent in New Zealand, compared with as low as zero in the
U.S. and  Japan , attracting investors to the South Pacific
nations’ higher-yielding assets. The risk in such trades is that
currency market moves will erase profits.  To contact the reporters on this story:
