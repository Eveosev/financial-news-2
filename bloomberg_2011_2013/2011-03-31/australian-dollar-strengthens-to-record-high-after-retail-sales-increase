(Corrects level of Australian dollar in second paragraph.)  The Australian dollar rose to a
record versus the greenback after government reports showed
retail sales rose in February and building approvals dropped.  The so-called Aussie climbed to $1.0342 as of 11:55 a.m. in
Sydney, the strongest since the currency was freely floated in
1983, from $1.0329 in  New York  yesterday.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
