U.K. Prime Minister  David Cameron 
said Libyan Foreign Minister Moussa Koussa has not been offered
immunity, as the Scottish prosecutor said it wanted to interview
him over the 1988 bombing of a U.S. airliner over Lockerbie.  Koussa, who quit Muammar Qaddafi’s regime and flew to
Britain yesterday, “has not been granted immunity,” Cameron
told reporters in  London  today. “There’s no deal of that
kind.”  Cameron said Scottish police and prosecutors are “entirely
independent of government. They should follow their evidence
wherever it leads. The government will assist them in any way
possible.”  The bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over the town of Lockerbie
killed 270 people. Only one man, Libyan intelligence agent Abdel Basset al-Megrahi, has been convicted of the attack. He was
freed by the Scottish government in 2009 because doctors judged
he would die from prostate cancer within months. He returned to
his native country to a hero’s welcome and remains alive.  “The investigation into the Lockerbie bombing remains open
and we will pursue all relevant lines of inquiry,”  Scotland ’s
Crown Office said in an e-mailed statement today.  East Renfrewshire council in Scotland confirmed today that
al-Megrahi, 58, is still alive and in Tripoli. As part of the
conditions of his release from Greenock prison, al-Megrahi has
to make himself available for regular conversations with an
official at the council by telephone or video link.  To contact the reporters on this story:
