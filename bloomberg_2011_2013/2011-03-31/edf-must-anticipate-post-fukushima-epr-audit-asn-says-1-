Electricite de France SA, the
biggest operator of nuclear reactors, is in talks with the
French safety regulator on measures to prevent an accident
similar to  Japan ’s Fukushima plant.  “We have started discussions about what can be done in the
near term,” Olivier Gupta, a deputy head of the Autorite de
Surete Nucleaire, said at a briefing in Paris. “It’s up to the
operators to learn the lessons.”  EDF may study the development of mobile diesel generator
back up units that could be moved to reactors where power
systems and back-up generators have failed, Gupta said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
