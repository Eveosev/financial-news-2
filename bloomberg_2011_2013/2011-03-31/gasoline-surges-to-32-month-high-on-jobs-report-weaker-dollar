Gasoline surged to the highest
level since July 2008 after a government report indicated the
labor market is improving as the first quarter ends.  Futures rose as much as 2 percent after the Labor
Department reported that jobless claims declined by 6,000 to
388,000 in the week ended March 26. The investment appeal of
commodities also increased as the dollar slipped against the
euro after European inflation advanced at the fastest pace in
more than two years.  “The big reason we’re up is the inflation numbers in
 Europe  and we saw the euro rally and the dollar break,” said
 Phil Flynn , vice president of research at PFGBest in  Chicago .
“Jobless claims were a pretty good number and there’s a
perception the economy is getting better in the short term.”  Gasoline for April delivery rose 4.36 cents, or 1.4
percent, to settle at $3.1076 a gallon on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . The more actively traded May contract added
5.04 cents, or 1.7 percent, to $3.1077 a gallon. April contracts
for gasoline and heating oil expired today.  Gasoline has surged 27 percent since the start of the year,
its second consecutive quarterly gain and the largest since the
second quarter of 2009. The 14 percent increase in March was the
largest monthly rise since May 2009.  Companies probably added 210,000 jobs in March, while the
 unemployment rate  held at 8.9 percent, economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News projected a Labor Department report will show
tomorrow.  Consumer Comfort  The Bloomberg Consumer  Comfort Index  rose to minus 46.9
last week from a seven-month low of minus 48.9. Business
activity expanded in March at close to the fastest pace in two
decades, a report from members of a Chicago purchasing managers
group also showed.  Inflation in the 17-nation euro region quickened to 2.6
percent from 2.4 percent in February, the European Union’s
 statistics office  in Luxembourg said today in an initial
estimate. That’s the fastest since October 2008 and exceeds the
ECB’s 2 percent limit for a fourth month. The euro rose 0.5
percent against the dollar at 3:25 p.m. in  New York .  Gasoline and crude oil advanced on concern the political
strife in Libya will be extended, disrupting fuel supplies and
spreading unrest in the region. Government troops loyal to
Muammar Qaddafi have retaken the oil port of Ras Lanuf and are
shelling Brega, another energy hub.  Brent crude  for May settlement advanced $2.23 to $117.36 a
barrel on  London ’s ICE Futures Europe exchange. Nymex May-
delivery crude gained $2.45 to $106.72 a barrel, the highest
settlement since September 2008.  ‘Libyan Situation’  “This Libyan situation just guarantees us $4 gasoline,”
said  James Cordier , portfolio manager at OptionSellers.com in
Tampa,  Florida . “We’re not putting a high in the market at all.
Speculators just have nothing to fear. Just go long.”  Regular gasoline at the pump, averaged nationwide,
increased 1.1 cents to $3.606 a gallon yesterday, AAA said on
its website. That’s the highest price since Sept. 30, 2008.  Heating oil for April delivery added 5.02 cents, or 1.7
percent, to $3.0898 a gallon on the exchange, the highest
settlement since Aug. 28, 2008. Heating oil rose 21 percent in
the three months ended today, its third consecutive quarterly
increase. The May contract advanced 5.91 cents, or 1.9 percent,
to $3.1125.  To contact the reporter on this story:
