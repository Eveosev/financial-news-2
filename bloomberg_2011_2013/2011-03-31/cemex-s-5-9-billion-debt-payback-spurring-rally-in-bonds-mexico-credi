Cemex SAB, the largest cement maker
in the Americas, is trouncing Mexican peers in the  bond market 
after cutting debt by 25 percent in the past two years to
reverse declines in its  credit rating .  The 6.9 percent return this year on Cemex’s dollar bonds
due in 2016 compares with a 1.2 percent gain for debt sold by
Mexican companies and a 3.8 percent advance for U.S. corporate
notes rated below Baa3 by Moody’s Investors Service and BBB- by
 Standard & Poor’s , according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Bank of
America Merrill Lynch. The yield on Monterrey-based Cemex’s
bonds, whose B rating is five levels below investment grade,
sank 101 basis points this year to 7.78 percent.  Cemex is rebounding after the U.S. housing market collapse
reduced demand for building materials in its biggest foreign
market by sales and forced the company to refinance $15 billion
of bank debt in 2009. Its rating was cut seven levels by S&P in
a 10-month span ending August 2009 after Cemex boosted debt
levels to pay for the $14.2 billion acquisition of Rinker Group
Ltd. in 2007. Cemex cut $5.9 billion of debt since June 2009 to
$17.7 billion last year.  “They’re doing a good job to create confidence in the
market,”  Alonso Madero , who helps manage about $5.5 billion of
debt, including Cemex bonds, at Corp. Actinver SAB in Mexico
City, said in a telephone interview. “It’s a big opportunity.”  Cemex’s bonds yield 438 basis points, or 4.38 percentage
points, more than similar-maturity notes sold by the Mexican
government, the smallest gap since April 2010 and down from 769
in May, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The average
yield on dollar bonds sold by Mexican companies climbed 33 basis
points this year to 6.37 percent, or 141 less than Cemex bonds,
according to JPMorgan.  U.S. Recovery  Similar-maturity dollar bonds issued by Paris-based Lafarge
SA, the world’s biggest cement maker, returned 2.1 percent this
year. Euro-denominated notes sold by Holcim Ltd., a cement maker
in Jona,  Switzerland , advanced 4 percent in the same period.  The economic recovery in the U.S. will boost Cemex’s cash
flow and its ability to pay down debt, said Carlos Legaspy, who
manages about $300 million of emerging-market debt, including
Cemex bonds, at  San Diego , California-based Precise Investment
Management.  The  U.S. economy , where Cemex got 19 percent of its revenue
in 2009, may grow 3.1 percent this year after expanding 2.9
percent in 2010, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg
survey of 68 economists.  “We believe in the story and we believe in the global
recovery,” Legaspy said in a telephone interview.  Bond Sale  Jorge Perez, a Cemex spokesman in the Monterrey suburb of
San Pedro Garza Garcia, declined to comment on the performance
of the company’s bonds.  Cemex sold $800 million of floating-rate debt due in
September 2015 on March 29 to yield 500 basis points more than
the three-month London interbank offered rate, or LIBOR.  The cost to protect Mexican debt against non-payment for
five years dropped 1 basis point to 105, according to CMA.
Credit-default swaps pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities or cash equivalent if the issuer fails
to comply with debt agreements.  The extra yield investors demand to hold Mexican dollar
bonds instead of U.S. Treasuries was unchanged at 128 at 5 p.m.
 New York  time, according to JPMorgan.  The peso rose 0.1 percent to 11.90477 per dollar and is up
3.7 percent this year. The currency posted its best quarterly
performance in a year.  Cemex’s stock fell 1.2 percent to 10.63 pesos.  ‘Pain’  Cemex’s shares are down 16 percent this year and touched a
four-month low on March 17 on concern the company’s $1.67
billion sale of convertible bonds will dilute the stock. The
offering is part of an effort to meet debt-reduction targets
under the refinancing agreement it negotiated with banks to
avoid default. The company said March 29 it has about $7.5
billion left of bank debt, down from the original $15 billion.  “The shareholders took the brunt of the pain,” James Harper, director of corporate research at BCP Securities in
Greenwich,  Connecticut , said in a telephone interview. “There’s
not a cent of accrued interest or principal that has been taken
away from creditors. It would be hard to point to any other
company headquartered in Mexico that would make such a big
effort to avoid a major restructuring.”  Vitro SAB, a Monterrey-based glassmaker, defaulted on $1.2
billion of bonds in 2009. Supermarket chain Controladora
Comercial Mexicana SAB, based in Mexico City, defaulted in 2008.  Cemex is scheduled to make $8.1 billion in debt payments in
2014, the most in a single year for the company. The redemptions
may be more than it’s able to pay, said Jorge Lagunas, who
manages $200 million of equities at  Mexico  City-based Grupo
Financiero Interacciones SA.  Default Swaps  “I’m worried about 2014,” he said in a telephone
interview. “If the company comes out with a restructuring plan,
then we’ll evaluate the benefits and see if it should be on my
list of favorites. Until that day, it’s off the list.”  While Cemex’s five-year credit-default swaps tumbled 143
basis points this year to 590, the cost of protecting its debt
against default is higher than  Portugal ’s, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Portuguese  government bonds  declined
yesterday amid speculation the Iberian nation will need
financial assistance.  Chief Executive Officer Lorenzo Zambrano, whose grandfather
founded the 105-year-old company, boosted Cemex’s debt levels
after making $29 billion in global acquisitions over two
decades. Investors demanded a record 2,330 basis points to
insure Cemex debt against non-payment in December 2009.  Debt Ratios  “I saw them in the thick of the crisis when they had taken
on all this debt, and they were literally like a deer in
headlights,” Harper said.  S&P cut Cemex’s rating from BBB, the second-lowest
investment grade, to BBB- in October 2008, to BB+ in January
2009 and B- in August of that year before receiving an upgrade
to B two months later.  The company’s debt to earnings before interest, tax,
depreciation and amortization, or Ebitda, ratio -- a measure of
leverage versus the cash available to make payments -- will
decline to 5.8 times this year from 7.4 in 2010 and to 4.3 in
2012, according to Eric Ollom, an analyst at Jeffries & Co. in
New York. Cemex said it reduced debt, including perpetual bonds,
by 8 percent last year.  “In 2012, it starts to look better,” Ollom said. “The
assumption is that we’re in a more robust recovery. What is
important is the trend is clearly improving and should continue
to improve provided that the economy improves.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
