Gold demand in  India , the world’s
largest user of the bullion, may increase to more than 1,200
metric tons by 2020 as economic growth boosts incomes and
household savings, the World Gold Council said.  The South Asian nation’s consumer demand was 963.1 tons in
2010, the council said in a statement issued in Bangalore today.  “India already occupies a unique position in the world
gold market and as private wealth in India surges over the next
10 years, so will Indian demand for gold,” said Ajay Mitra, the
council’s managing director for India and the Middle East.
“India’s demand for gold continues to be robust.”  Gold for immediate delivery rose in  London , heading for the
longest streak of quarterly gains in three decades, as fighting
in Libya and concerns about European debt spurred demand for an
alternative investment.  Bullion rose $11.30, or 0.8 percent, to $1,434.32 an ounce
by 1:57 p.m. in London. Prices are up 0.6 percent this quarter.
A 10th quarterly increase would be the best streak of gains
since 1979. Gold for June delivery was 0.7 percent higher at
$1,435.50 an ounce on the Comex in  New York .  Troops loyal to  Muammar Qaddafi  forced Libyan rebels to
retreat as the U.S. and U.K. said they would consider arming
opposition forces. Gold reached a record $1,447.82 an ounce in
London on March 24 as fighting in  Libya , the Japanese nuclear
crisis and concerns about European debt boosted demand for a
protection of wealth.  “Global prices will likely remain higher in 2011” on
geopolitical tensions, Mitra said.  Indian households hold more than 18,000 tons of gold, the
largest stockpile of bullion in the world, the WGC said. Gold
purchases by India accounted for 32 percent of total global
sales in 2010, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
