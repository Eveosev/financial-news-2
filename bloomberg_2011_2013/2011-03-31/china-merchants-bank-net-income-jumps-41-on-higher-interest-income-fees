China  Merchants Bank  Co., the
nation’s sixth-largest lender, said profit rose 41 percent in
2010 as lending margins widened and income grew from loans and
fee-based services such as credit cards.  Net income climbed to 25.8 billion yuan ($3.9 billion), or
1.23 yuan a share, from 18.235 billion yuan, or 0.95 yuan a
share, a year earlier, the Shenzhen-based company said in a
statement to the Hong Kong stock exchange today. That missed the
26.35 billion yuan average estimate of 19 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg News.  Merchants Bank expanded outstanding loans by 21 percent
last year to 1.43 trillion yuan, increasing pressure on
President Ma Weihua to raise funds to sustain growth. The
lender’s core capital adequacy ratio, a key measure of financial
strength, stood at 8.04 percent by the end of December, near the
minimum it aims to maintain until 2012.  Net interest income rose 41 percent 57.1 billion yuan last
year and non-interest income rose 27 percent to 14.7 yuan, the
bank said. Net interest margin expanded 0.42 percentage points
to 2.65 percent, according to today’s statement.  Merchants Bank rose 1.2 percent to close at HK$21.55 in
 Hong Kong  before today’s earnings announcement.  --Luo Jun, Eva Woo. Editors: James Gunsalus  To contact Bloomberg News staff of this story:
