LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA (MC) 
Chief Executive Officer  Bernard Arnault  said the luxury-goods
maker’s Tokyo stores are “less full” than usual following this
month’s tsunami and amid the ongoing nuclear crisis in Japan.  “Our Tokyo stores are less full than usual but the whole
western part of Japan is unaffected,” Arnault told reporters
after the company’s annual general meeting today in Paris.  Japan, which accounts for about 9 percent of LVMH sales, is
struggling after the earthquake and tsunami left almost 28,000
people dead or missing and triggered the world’s worst nuclear
crisis in a quarter-century at the Fukushima power plant.  Arnault said he’s confident that Japan will recover from
the disaster over time.  “I’m optimistic for  Japan  in the medium-term,” Arnault
told LVMH shareholders. “I have confidence in the capacity of
the Japanese to face this situation and perhaps even come back
stronger.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
