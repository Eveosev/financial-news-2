As Ireland’s bill to clean up
 Europe ’s worst banking crisis reaches as much as 100 billion
euros ($142 billion), the country’s authorities are counting on
their latest financing plan to be enough.  The central bank instructed four lenders yesterday to raise
24 billion euros and announced plans to merge two of them. The
government already injected 46.3 billion euros into the
financial services industry and set up an agency that paid more
than 30 billion euros for banks’ risky property loans in the
past year. The total equates to about two-thirds the size of the
Irish economy.  “This is the scale of the legacy that we have now
inherited,” Prime Minister  Enda Kenny  told reporters in Dublin
yesterday after the results of the latest stress tests were
released. “I can only hope this is the final scale of it.”  Bank of Ireland Plc, the country’s largest lender, rose 23
percent to 27 euro cents in Dublin trading, as it outlined plans
to avoid majority state control after being order to raise 5.2
billion euros.  “Only Bank of Ireland retains a reasonable prospect of
recreating” a case for investors “in the near term,” said
analysts, including Emer Lang and  Stephen Lyons  at Dublin-based
securities firm Davy, in a note to clients today.  Ireland is trying to convince investors at home and abroad
that it’s finally plugged all the holes in the banking system,
whose collapse crippled what was once Europe’s most dynamic
economy. Central bank Governor  Patrick Honohan  said he expects
the two of the country’s six domestic banks not already owned by
the government to fall under state control.  ‘Initial Impression’  “Our initial impression is that the question of whether
this is enough will continue to linger,” said Marchel Alexandrovich, an economist at Jefferies International in London.
“The figure is credible enough for now and buys time to see how
economic growth unfolds over the next year.”  Allied Irish Banks Plc (ALBK) , the largest lender during the
decade-long economic boom, requires 13.3 billion euros of
additional capital after its stress test, the central bank said
yesterday. Bank of Ireland Plc needs 5.2 billion euros, while
Irish Life & Permanent Plc must raise 4 billion euros and EBS
Building Society has to find 1.5 billion euros. Irish Life’s
stock plunged 51 percent, as it prepared to spin off its life
assurance and asset management unit through a share sale.  EBS, the fifth-largest bank, will be merged into Allied
Irish, while Bank of Ireland will focus on being a stronger
domestic bank, Finance Minister  Michael Noonan  told parliament
in Dublin. The total bailout cost for Allied Irish almost equals
its peak stock market value of 21 billion euros in 2007.  Asset Sale  Irish banks have to sell 77 billion euros of assets, with
most to be offloaded by the end of 2013, a Finance Ministry
official told reporters yesterday.  “None of it came as a big surprise,” Ralph Silva, a
strategist at London-based Silva Research Network, said after
the results yesterday. “They put a stress test out there that
shows the banking industry in Ireland is dead.”  Ireland’s new government took office last month after Prime
Minister Kenny’s Fine Gael party prevailed in elections and
ousted Fianna Fail, which had run the country since 1997.  The state currently controls four of the six domestic
lenders, including Anglo Irish Bank Corp., which epitomized
Ireland’s building boom and collapsed with the bursting of the
property bubble and a 15 percent decline in gross domestic
product. Anglo Irish said yesterday its final pretax loss was
17.7 billion euros for 2010, a record for an Irish company.  State Control  “I wish that our bad banks were allowed to go down the
tube as well instead of the Irish taxpayers paying to sort out
their problems,” Mick Wallace, a real-estate developer who won
a seat in parliament, told Bloomberg Television. “That is one
of the craziest decisions in the history of this state.”  The government also will “in all likelihood” end up with
a majority of Irish Life, the only government-guaranteed bank to
avoid a bailout before yesterday, Noonan said.  Ireland set aside 35 billion euros of funds for its banks
last year as part of the country’s rescue package by the
European Union and  International Monetary Fund . The money
includes 17.5 billion euros from Ireland’s own resources.  The banks were reliant on the  European Central Bank  for
88.7 billion euros of funding at the end of last month, the
Irish central bank said. They may have borrowed as much as an
additional 70.1 billion euros in exceptional liquidity from the
Irish central bank, according to figures on March 11.  Budapest Meeting  Ireland will now seek to reopen terms of the country’s 85
billion-euro EU and IMF bailout agreement that was reached in
November. Noonan will bring the results to a meeting of European
finance ministers in Budapest starting on April 8 as he pushes
for a reduction in the 5.8 percent interest rate on the loans.  Honohan said yesterday there’s no imminent prospect of
obtaining a longer-term financing facility from the ECB. He also
opposes forcing senior bank bondholders to take a loss.  The yield on 10-year Irish bonds narrowed 1 basis point
from yesterday to 10.2 percent at 8:15 a.m. The extra yield
investors demand to hold the securities rather than German bunds
of similar maturity more narrowed 6 basis points from yesterday
to 681 basis points, having more than quadrupled in the past
year. The spread over German debt is more than nine times the
average of the past decade, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  “People may stop worrying about banks and senior
haircuts,” Ivan Zubo, a banking analyst at BNP Paribas in
 London , said in an interview. “But they may start worrying
about the sustainability of the sovereign.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
