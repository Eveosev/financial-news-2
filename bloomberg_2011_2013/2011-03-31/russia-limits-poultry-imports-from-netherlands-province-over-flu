Russia imposed temporary
restrictions on imports of poultry, eggs, live birds, feed and
poultry-industry equipment from the Zeeland province of the
Netherlands on flu risks, the government’s food safety service
Rosselkhoznadzor said on its  website .  The limitations were put in place yesterday and will run
until further notice in response to an outbreak of the H7N1 bird
flu virus in Zeeland, according to the statement, which didn’t
elaborate on the restrictions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
