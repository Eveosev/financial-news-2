China   completed  its first
horizontal shale gas well, after 11 months of drilling, as the
world’s biggest energy consumer seeks to tap its reserves of the
cleaner-burning fuel.  The Wei 201-H1 well at the Weiyuan formation in the Sichuan
Basin has a 1-kilometer (0.6-mile) horizontal section at a depth
of about 3 kilometers, according to  China National Petroleum
Corp. ’s online newsletter today.  Producers face “unique” geological, technical and
commercial challenges, according to consultant Wood Mackenzie.
China may hold as much as 380 trillion cubic meters of
unconventional gas, about 10 times the potential conventional
reserves, CNPC said in November.  Chuanqing Drilling Engineering Co., a unit of CNPC,
conducted the operation, the newsletter said. Liu Weijiang,
Beijing-based spokesman for CNPC, didn’t answer three calls
during office hours. Mao Zefeng, Beijing-based spokesman for
Hong Kong-listed unit PetroChina Co., also couldn’t be reached
in three calls to his office and mobile phone.  No foreign venture partner was mentioned in the report.
Chinese  oil companies  are joining with producers including  Royal
Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  and  Chevron Corp. (CVX)  to tap their expertise in
extracting unconventional gas resources.  CNPC is working with Shell to explore Sichuan’s Fushun-
Yongchuan shale gas block and with Chevron on the Chuandongbei
project, also in Sichuan.  China plans to triple the use of natural gas to about 10
percent of energy consumption by 2020 to help cut reliance on
more-polluting oil and coal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
