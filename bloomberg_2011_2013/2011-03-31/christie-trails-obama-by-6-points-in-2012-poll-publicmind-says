Chris Christie , the first-term New
Jersey governor who says he won’t run for the White House in
2012, trailed President  Barack Obama  by six percentage points in
a head-to-head matchup, according to a nationwide survey.  Obama led Christie, 46 percent to 40 percent, among
registered voters queried by Fairleigh Dickinson University’s
 PublicMind  Poll, released today. Two former Republican governors
fared better.  Mike Huckabee  of Arkansas matched Obama, at 46
percent each, while  Massachusetts ’s Mitt Romney was just behind,
with 43 percent to the president’s 44 percent.  “Christie has now, without running, the kind of support
among Republicans that some others have taken years to
cultivate,”  Peter Woolley , director of the polling center in
Madison, New Jersey, said in a statement with the results. The
poll said Christie beat Sarah Palin, the 2008 Republican vice
presidential nominee, as well as  Newt Gingrich  and  Tim Pawlenty .  Christie, 48, has become a national Republican star after
battling government unions and slashing spending to close a
$10.7 billion deficit without raising taxes. In an  interview 
posted this month on the National Review magazine’s website,
Christie said he has been asked to run for president and knows
he could win, while insisting he won’t make a bid in 2012.  The governor was the main attraction at a $1,000-a-person
annual  National Republican Congressional Committee  fundraising
dinner in  Washington  yesterday. The event raised more than $10
million, surpassing an $8 million goal, according to Joanna
Burgos, a spokeswoman. Last year’s gathering, featuring talk-
show host Sean Hannity, raised $7 million, according to Burgos.  Not Running  “I’m not running for president of the  United States ,”
Christie told  New Jersey  residents at a March 29 public meeting
in Hammonton. “I’m the governor of New Jersey, why would I ever
want a job that’s less powerful?”  Republicans named Christie in 10 percent of responses when
asked about their preference for the party’s 2012 nominee for
president, the PublicMind poll said. Huckabee was picked by 21
percent while Romney was the choice of 20 percent.  “Huckabee and Romney have a huge advantage since they’ve
run before for the presidency and are more familiar to voters
than Christie,” Woolley said.  Huckabee also matched Obama, 46 percent to 46 percent, in a
Newsweek/Daily Beast  survey  of likely voters conducted Feb. 12-
15, while Romney trailed the president 47 percent to 49 percent.
A Democracy Corps poll Feb. 7-9 showed Huckabee and Obama at 47
percent each, while Romney trailed, 46 percent to 48 percent.  In the PublicMind poll, Obama trounced Palin, 54 percent to
34 percent, and Pawlenty, a former Minnesota governor, 48
percent to 34 percent. Gingrich, the former speaker of the U.S.
House of Representatives who led a Republican surge in 1994,
trailed Obama 52 percent to 37 percent, the survey said.  PublicMind polled 800 registered voters nationwide by
telephone from March 21-28. The results have a margin of error
of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
