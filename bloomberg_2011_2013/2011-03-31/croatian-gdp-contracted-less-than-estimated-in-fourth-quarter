Croatia’s economy shrank less than
previously estimated in the third and fourth quarters of last
year, improving the full year contraction to 1.2 percent.  Gross domestic product fell an annual 0.6 percent, less
than a 0.7 percent preliminary estimate released on Feb. 25, the
 statistics office  said today on its website.  The Adriatic Sea nation is struggling to support the
economy after cash flows from abroad dried up and foreign direct
investment dropped 30 percent in the first nine months of 2010.
GDP slumped 5.8 percent in 2009 during the global slowdown,
after growth averaged 4.6 percent a year between 2000 and 2007.  Croatia had its long-term sovereign  credit rating  reduced
in December to BBB-, one step above junk at  Standard & Poor’s ,
which cited the country’s deteriorating “fiscal position and
continuously weak external financing.”  Third-quarter growth was revised to 0.3 percent annually,
the first gain since 2008, from a previous estimate of a 0.2
percent rise. The economy was previously estimated to have
contracted 1.4 percent last year.  To contact the reporter on this story: Jasmina Kuzmanovic at
