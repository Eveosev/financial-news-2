Hanwha Chemical Corp., the fourth-
best performer in  South Korea â€™s Kospi 200 index during the past
year, is considering building a polysilicon plant in South Korea
as it pursues a goal of more than doubling sales.  Constructing the plant in South Korea may make it easier to
operate and staff, and open new customer bases, Kwon Hyuk Bum, a
Hanwha spokesman, said by phone today. He was responding to a
Korea Economic Daily report that the plant may be built in the
U.S. or  Canada  to gain from lower power costs.  Hanwha is among South Korean companies betting orders for
solar-power equipment will rise as governments take steps to cut
 carbon emissions  blamed for global warming. Hanwha acquired
almost half of Solarfun Power Holdings Co., a Chinese maker of
solar components, in 2010. Polysilicon is a material used in
solar cells.  Chief Executive Hong Ki Joon aims to increase sales to 4.2
trillion won ($3.8 billion) this year, and to 9 trillion won in
2015, compared with 3.6 trillion won in 2010.  Hanwha has more than tripled in Seoul trading in the past
year, trailing only Korea Kumho Petrochemical Co., Honam
Petrochemical Corp. and KP Chemical Corp. among  Kospi 200 Index (KOSPI2) 
members.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
