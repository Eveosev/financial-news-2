Uganda ’s inflation accelerated to
11.1 percent in March after prices for staple foods, fuel and
transport rose, the Uganda Bureau of Statistics said.  The inflation rate in East Africa’s third-biggest economy
rose from the revised 6.4 percent in February, the statistics
office said today in a statement handed to reporters in the
capital, Kampala. Prices rose by 4.1 percent in the month.  Food costs, which account for 27.2 percent of the inflation
basket, leaped 11.9 percent in the month after a prolonged dry
season in parts of the country cut supplies, the bureau said.
Prices for fuel also increased because of a rise in global
prices, while a depreciation of the local currency pushed up
import costs, it said.  The underlying inflation rate, which excludes food, fuel,
electricity and metered water, rose to 7.8 percent from a
revised 6 percent in February, the statistics office said.  Uganda, with a population of more than 30 million, is
 Africa ’s largest producer of robusta coffee.  To contact the reporter on this story:
