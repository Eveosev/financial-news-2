The rebound in the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index isn’t over because when pessimism about the
market was this high in August, equities rose in five of the
next six months, said Bay Crest Partners LLC.  The benchmark index for U.S. equities slipped as low as
1,249.05 on March 16 amid concern rising energy costs will hurt
global economic growth and  Japan ’s 9.0-magnitude earthquake may
tip the world’s third-biggest economy into recession. The next
day, the weekly survey from the  American Association  of
Individual Investors showed the ratio of bulls to bears fell to
0.71, the lowest since Aug. 26, Bloomberg data shows.  Christian Bendixen, director of technical research at Bay
Crest, said the increase in pessimism may reverse and help the
S&P 500 climb to 1,425, or 7.3 percent above yesterday’s close
of 1,328.26. Technical analysts regard investor sentiment as a
contrarian indicator, with pessimism signaling investors may
have more cash available.  “It’s a positive thing that this negative sentiment has
returned,” Bendixen said in an interview. “The last seller got
out of the market and that’s how markets reverse, when there is
an exhaustion of sellers.”  The bearish sentiment on Aug. 26 coincided with a bottom
for the  S&P 500 . The benchmark rose in five out of the following
six months, rallying 28 percent to a 32-month high on Feb. 18.
Since its 2011 low on March 16, the S&P 500 has climbed 6.3
percent.  Technical analysts study charts of trading patterns and
