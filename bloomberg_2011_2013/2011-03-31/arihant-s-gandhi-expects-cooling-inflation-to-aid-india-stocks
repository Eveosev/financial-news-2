Anita Gandhi, a director at Arihant
Capital Market Ltd., comments on the outlook for Indian equities.
She spoke in a phone interview today.  The Bombay Stock Exchange Sensitive Index gained 0.7
percent to 19,417.21 as of 10:40 a.m. local time, rising for an
eighth day and extending the biggest weekly rally in 20 months.
The S&P CNX Nifty Index on the National Stock Exchange climbed
0.6 percent to 5,823.05.  On the market’s gains:  “The Nifty continues to rally on renewed interest from
foreign institutional investors, who have turned net buyers from
net sellers. We expect  interest rates  to not go up by more than
50-75 basis points in 2011. Moderate interest rate hikes and
cooling inflation is driving investor interest, highlighted by
the strong appetite seen for the recent  State Bank  of India bond
issue. Also, the risks from global uncertainties, including the
tsunami in  Japan , are diminishing.”  On buying momentum:  “The Nifty is likely to expire with solid gains as funds
continue their year-end buying to prop up their net asset value.
We also expect buying momentum to continue into the start of the
April derivatives contract series. However, fund flows during
the later part will be influenced by quarterly earnings.  “We expect to see further buying in technology and bank
stocks before the expiry of the March derivatives contracts
today.”  On stock recommendations:  “We advise investors to buy  Bank of Baroda (BOB) , Bajaj Auto,
Tata Consultancy Services and KPIT Cummins.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
