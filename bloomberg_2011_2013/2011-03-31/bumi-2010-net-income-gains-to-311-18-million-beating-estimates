PT Bumi Resources,  Indonesia ’s
largest coal producer by volume, said net income jumped 63
percent last year, beating analyst estimates, as prices of the
fuel increased.  Profit climbed to $311 million from $191 million, the
Jakarta-based company said in a statement published today in
Suara Pembaruan newspaper. Revenue rose to $4.4 billion from
$3.7 billion. That compares with a mean estimate of $276 million
in profit and $4.1 billion in revenue from a Bloomberg News
survey of 17 analysts.  Coal producers in Indonesia, the world’s second-largest
exporter of the fuel, are benefiting from gains in prices and
demand after floods in  Australia , the largest shipper, disrupted
output. The Indonesian coal reference price rose 18 percent to
$103.41 a metric ton in December compared with February 2010,
when the government started the benchmark index.  The unit of PT Bakrie & Brothers sold a “little over” 60
million tons of coal last year at an average $70 a ton compared
with 58 million tons at $63 a ton in 2009, Director Dileep Srivastava said Jan. 21. Bumi expects sales and prices to
increase by at least 10 percent this year, assuming reasonable
weather conditions, he said then.  Analysts expect Bumi, which has a market value of 69.6
trillion rupiah ($8 billion), to report $515 million in profit
and $5.3 billion in sales this year.  Bumi was unchanged at 3,350 rupiah at the 4 p.m. close in
Jakarta trading. The stock has risen 11 percent this year
compared with the 0.7 percent drop in the benchmark  Jakarta
Composite Index. (JCI)   To contact the reporter on this story:
