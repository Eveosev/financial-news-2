Euroclear SA’s U.K. and Ireland
chief executive officer Yannic Weber said the proposed merger
between  Deutsche Boerse AG (DB1)  and  NYSE Euronext (NYX)  could inhibit
competition for settlement services, the Financial Times
reported, citing remarks by Weber at a conference in  London .  The merger could also reinforce the “vertical silo”
model, in which an exchange controls both trading of derivatives
and post-trade services such as clearing and settlement, the FT
cited Weber as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
