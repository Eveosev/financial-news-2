The extra yield investors demand to
hold Dubai’s 6.396 percent dollar Islamic bond over Abu Dhabi
state-owned Tourism Development & Investment Co.’s 4.949 percent
sukuk traded near a 16-month low after  Dubai World  signed a
final accord to restructure its debt.  The spread narrowed 35 basis points to 213.3 after state-
owned Dubai World signed the deal with creditors March 23, the
data show. On March 29, the gap was 208 basis points, or 2.08
percentage points, the smallest since November 2009, when the
company announced it would seek a "standstill" accord on its
debt payments.  “The Dubai World debt deal has ebbed fears that Dubai may
default on its repayments and has brought much needed comfort to
the emirate’s market,” Louis Najem, a fixed-income sales trader
in Dubai at Rasmala Investment Bank Ltd., said by telephone
today. “Since Dubai names usually yield the highest, the
emirate’s sukuk has seen the highest demand from clients that
are looking to re-enter the market following the sell-off
earlier this year.”  Dubai World, the state-owned holding company that sought to
alter the terms on about $25 billion of debt, signed a final
accord with lenders last week. The emirate ran up debt of at
least $129.3 billion after it spent billions transforming itself
into a tourism, trade and financial services hub, estimates by
Credit Suisse Group AG show. The emirate received a $20 billion
bailout from the Abu Dhabi government and the U.A.E.’s central
bank in 2009.  The yield on Dubai’s sukuk maturing November 2014 has
dropped 38 basis points to 5.47 percent since the announcement
was made, according to prices on Bloomberg. The rate on TDIC’s
Shariah-compliant bond maturing October 2014 fell 3 basis points
to 3.34 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
