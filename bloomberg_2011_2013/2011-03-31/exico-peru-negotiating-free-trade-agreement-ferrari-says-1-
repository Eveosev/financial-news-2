Mexican Economy Minister Bruno
Ferrari said his country, Latin America’s second-biggest
economy, is close to signing a free trade agreement with  Peru .  “The  Economy Ministry  has a delegation in Peru that is
making progress on negotiations for a new treaty,” Ferrari told
reporters in Mexico City today.  Mexico will exclude 193 products from the deal with Peru in
order to protect its domestic market, including coffee, sugar,
beef, chicken, dairy products and rice, Ferrari said.  Mexico currently exports $974 million a year to Peru, which
represents 0.3 percent of Mexican exports and accounts for 3.4
percent of Peru’s imports, according to the Economy Ministry.  Mexican exports to Peru would increase to $2.7 billion
under a free-trade agreement, the ministry says.  Mexico’s Senate must ratify trade agreements reached by the
government, according to Mexican law.  To contact the reporter on this story:
