Standard & Poor’s  cut the credit
ratings of four Greek banks and put the country’s banking system
as a whole into a higher risk category on “heightened economic
and industry risks for the Greek financial system.”  National Bank of Greece SA (ETE) ,  EFG Eurobank Ergasias SA (EUROB) , Alpha
Bank SA and  Piraeus Bank SA (TPEIR)  all had their long-term counterparty
credit ratings lowered to B+, S&P said in a statement today. The
country’s banking industry risk assessment was downgraded two
notches to the fourth-lowest, the same level as Romania,
Bulgaria, Lithuania and Hungary.  The cut comes two days after S&P lowered the rating on
Greece’s sovereign debt to BB- from BB+ on concern that a
European debt crisis resolution mechanism would incur losses on
private creditors.  Greek banks have large holdings of government bonds,
leaving them dependent on the European Central Bank for
liquidity, while the country’s recession has led to falling
deposits and more non-performing loans.  “We expect  Greece ’s tough economic and operating
environment to adversely affect the Greek financial system,”
S&P said in the statement. “We anticipate further deterioration
in banks’ domestic loan books in 2011, amid Greece’s still-sharp
economic recession.”  S&P kept the banks on CreditWatch negative today, meaning
further deterioration in their ratings is more likely than an
improvement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
