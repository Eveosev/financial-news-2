Germany ’s data protection
commissioner for Berlin, Alexander Dix, said  Facebook Inc 
“can’t be trusted”  because it changes how it handles data
from one day to the next,  Berliner Morgenpost  reported.  Dix said each user should have the power to determine what
is done with his data and the reality is that one relinquishes
control to Facebook, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
