Norske Skogindustrier ASA (NSG)  may close
its Norwegian plants should the legislation tied to the joint
green certificate system in  Sweden  and Norway be approved,
Teknisk Ukeblad reported, citing spokesman Carsten Dybevig.  Norske Skog may face costs of as much as 3 billion kroner
($543 million) between 2012 and 2035 unless it is given the same
certificate exemptions as it will in Sweden, the Oslo-based
magazine reported.  Under the proposed Norwegian legislation, only companies
that have dispensation from electricity duties are exempt from
buying the certificates, while in Sweden exceptions are made
according to the importance of power to the manufacturing
process of the company, the magazine said.   The green certificate system is scheduled to be introduced
in January 2012. The Norwegian government is finalizing a
proposal for the legislation of it.  Click here for web link  To contact the reporter on this story:
