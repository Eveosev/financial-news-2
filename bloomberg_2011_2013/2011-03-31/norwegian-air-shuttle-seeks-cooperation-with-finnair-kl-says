Norwegian Air Shuttle ASA is still
seeking cooperation with  Finnair Oyj (FIA1S)  on feeder routes, the
Finnish business daily Kauppalehti reported, citing Chief
Executive Officer Bjoern Kos.           “It would be wonderful if Norwegian could fly customers to
Helsinki and they could continue on Finnair flights to  Asia ,”
Kos said, adding that the airline does not currently have a
separate agreement on feeder traffic with Finnair, Kauppalehti
said.   Norwegian Air Shuttle began domestic flights in Finland
today with routes from Helsinki to Oulu and Rovaniemi, staffed
by cabin crew and pilots from flight personnel contracting
firms, the enwspaper reported.   Click here for the Related Stories in Finnish:
