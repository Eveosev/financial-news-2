Nykredit A/S says policy makers
should reduce loan-to-value ratios on mortgages from the current
80 percent instead of phasing out interest-only loans if the
goal is to reduce risk in  Denmark ’s housing market, Borsen
reported, citing Nykredit Chief Executive Officer Peter Engberg
Jensen.  Central bank Governor Nils Bernstein, who has called for a
rethink of interest-only and adjustable-rate loans, said he
would support Engberg Jensen’s idea, according to the
Copenhagen-based newspaper.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
