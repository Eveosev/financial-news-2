Tesla Motors Inc. (TSLA)  rose the most in
more than four months after a Morgan Stanley analyst said the
unprofitable electric-car maker will benefit from a shift away
from internal-combustion engines.  Tesla surged $4.04, or 17 percent, to $27.75 at 4 p.m.  New
York  time in Nasdaq Stock Market composite trading, the biggest
gain since Nov. 10.  Electric vehicles may rise to 5.5 percent of global sales
by 2020 and more than 15 percent of deliveries by 2025, Adam Jonas, a Morgan Stanley analyst based in New York, wrote in a
note today. Tesla, which makes the $109,000 Roadster and will
begin selling the lower-priced Model S sedan next year, may sell
500,000 vehicles by 2025, Jonas said.  “Tesla has a viable opportunity to be a significant volume
player in the global  auto industry ,” Jonas wrote. “The
transformation from  California  startup to global auto player may
require well more than a decade to achieve -- not unlike the
genesis of many of today’s established automotive companies.”  Tesla said earlier this week it has delivered more than
1,500 of the Roadster since the model was introduced in 2008.
The company aims to produce as many as 20,000 Model S sedans a
year by 2013.  Jonas upgraded the company’s rating to “overweight” from
“equal-weight” and said the shares may rise to $70.  Tesla’s Obstacles  Morgan Stanley’s expectations for electric-vehicle demand
may be “a stretch,” Mike Omotoso, senior manager of the global
powertrain section of consultant J.D. Power & Associates, said
in an interview. Electric vehicles will make up 2 percent of the
global market by 2020, J.D. Power estimates.  “The obstacles are high up-front costs of the vehicle, the
limited driving range, and the lack of infrastructure,” said
Omotoso, who’s based in Troy,  Michigan . “All those obstacles
are going to take 10 years or more to overcome, and there are a
lot of other alternatives consumers have to reduce gas
consumption.”  Morgan Stanley’s Jonas called Tesla “a highly speculative
investment” due to the risks of slow electric vehicle adoption,
model-introduction delays and balance sheet “difficulties.”  Tesla, which is backed by  Daimler AG (DAI)  and  Toyota Motor
Corp. (7203) , may need to raise additional capital because liquidity
could fall to $146 million by the end of 2013, Jonas wrote.  ‘Room for Error’  “Will Tesla run out of money?” he wrote. “We don’t think
so. But there’s also not much room for error.”  Tesla, based in  Palo Alto , California, in February said its
fourth-quarter net loss widened to $51.4 million from $24.2
million a year earlier as it increased investment in the Model S
sedan, its next all-electric model that will start at about
$57,400. The Model S will be profitable even on the base model,
J.B. Straubel, Tesla’s chief technology officer, said March 17.  Tesla posted revenue of $116.7 million for 2010 and has
said sales may increase to $160 million to $175 million this
year. Morgan Stanley’s Jonas wrote that revenue may climb to
$9.5 billion by 2020 with a 3.6 percent share of the global
electric vehicle market by that time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
