The population of the  United Arab
Emirates  grew 65 percent to 8.26 million people in the first
half of 2010 compared with the same period in 2006, the U.A.E.
Statistics Bureau said on  its website today.   Emirati nationals accounted for 11.5 percent of the
population at the end of June, or about 948,000 people, the data
showed. The country’s expatriate population rose 75 percent from
2006 to the end of June, to 7.3 million people.  The majority of U.A.E. nationals, more than 42 percent,
lived in Abu Dhabi, the U.A.E. capital, at the end of June. The
data doesn’t provide a breakdown of expatriates in Abu Dhabi or
the other emirates in the federation, which includes Dubai,
Sharjah, Ajman, Ras al Khaimah, Fujairah and Umm al-Quwain.  The U.A.E., led by Dubai and  Abu Dhabi , has relied heavily
on foreigners to expand its economy through the development of
various industries, including infrastructure and real estate,
financial services and tourism.  To contact the reporter on this story:
