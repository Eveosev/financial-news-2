David Sokol , who resigned yesterday
as a top manager at  Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A) , said that he didn’t
do anything “wrong” when he bought stock in  Lubrizol Corp. (LZ) , a
takeover target.  “I don’t believe that I did anything wrong,” Sokol told
CNBC television today in an interview. “I can understand the
appearance issue and that’s why we made it public.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
