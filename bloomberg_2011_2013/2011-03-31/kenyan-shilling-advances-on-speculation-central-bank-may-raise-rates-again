Kenya ’s shilling gained for a sixth
day against the dollar on speculation that the nation’s central
bank will raise interest rates after inflation surged.  The currency of East Africa’s biggest economy strengthened
as much as 0.3 percent to 82.93 per dollar, and was trading at
83.00 as of 5:02 p.m. in Nairobi, the capital. It closed at
83.18 yesterday.  “Today the currency was aided by the higher inflation
number yesterday,” Dickson Magecha, a currency trader with
Standard Chartered Bank Kenya Ltd., said in a phone interview
from Nairobi. “People imagine with inflation going up the
central bank is more likely to increase the interest rate, which
would add to the yield of the Kenyan shilling.”  Kenyan inflation accelerated for the fifth straight month
in March to 9.2 percent, from 6.5 percent in February, the Kenya
National Bureau of Statistics said yesterday. The central bank
unexpectedly increased its key lending rate by a quarter of a
percentage point to 6 percent on March 22, reversing a cut
announced two months ago, and warned that inflation may
accelerate in coming months because of reduced agricultural
production.  To contact the reporter on this story:
