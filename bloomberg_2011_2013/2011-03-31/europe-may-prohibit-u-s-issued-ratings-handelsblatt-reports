Europe  may decide not to recognize
credit ratings on financial securities if the ratings have been
issued in the U.S.,  Handelsblatt  reported, citing unidentified
European Commission officials.  All ratings need to be comparable in quality and this isn’t
guaranteed for ratings from the U.S. or third countries, the
newspaper said. Such a policy would have consequences for
European banks, which would be required to provide more of a
capital backstop for financial products from the U.S. that don’t
have a European rating, Handelsblatt said.  The European Commission acknowledges the role of U.S.
credit rating agencies in the industry and is consulting with
all stakeholders before introducing legislation for a new
regulatory framework “by summer,”  Amadeu Altafaj , a spokesman
for the commission, said by telephone from Brussels today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
