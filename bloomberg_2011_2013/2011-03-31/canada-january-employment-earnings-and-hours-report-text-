The following is the text of
 Canada 's employment, earnings, and hours report for
January
released by Statistics Canada.  Between January 2010 and January 2011, average weekly
earnings of non-farm payroll employees rose 4.2% to
$870.33. This was the sixth consecutive month with year-
over-year growth at around 4.0%.  In comparison, average weekly earnings between January
2009 and January 2010 increased by 2.2%.  A 1.3% increase in the average workweek contributed to
the 4.2% advance in weekly earnings between January 2010
and January 2011. In comparison, average hours declined by
0.4% between January 2009 and January 2010. The remainder
of the year-over-year earnings increase in January 2011
reflects a number of other factors, including wage growth,
changes in the composition of employment by industry, by
occupation and by level of job experience.  Average weekly earnings increased in every province
between January 2010 and January 2011. Growth was above
the national average in Prince  Edward Island ,  Alberta ,
Newfoundland and Labrador and British Columbia. Nova
Scotia had the slowest growth.  Average weekly earnings by industry  Between January 2010 and January 2011, growth in
average weekly earnings was above the national average of
4.2% in 6 of the 10 industries with over 700,000
employees, led by administrative and support services. The
slowest growth in earnings occurred in retail and
wholesale trade.  Average weekly earnings in administrative and support
services increased by 8.5% to $721.27 in the 12 months to
January. Year-over-year growth was high across the sector.  Earnings were up by 4.7% to $804.40 in health care and
social assistance in the 12 months to January. Although
average weekly earnings have been increasing in a number
of industries in this sector, gains were particularly high
in general medical and surgical hospitals.  Manufacturing earnings increased by 4.6% to $989.18 in
the 12 months to January. Growth was notable in beverage
and tobacco products; machinery; primary metals; petroleum
and coal products; fabricated metal products; chemical;
and furniture and related products.  Earnings in professional, scientific and technical
services continued on a long-term upward trend, rising
4.4% to $1,211.09 from January 2010 to January 2011.
Growth was particularly high in advertising and public
relations; specialized design; management, scientific and
technical consulting; as well as in architectural,
engineering and related services.  Growth in average weekly earnings was also strong in
some smaller industries. From January 2010 to January
2011, the fastest growth among all sectors was in arts,
entertainment and recreation, where earnings increased by
9.3% to $591.58. Growth has been robust since September
2010 for spectator sports; gambling; independent artists,
writers and performers; as well as promoters (presenters)
of performing arts, sports and similar events.  Average weekly earnings in transportation and
warehousing have been on a steady upward trend since
January 2010. From January 2010 to January 2011, average
weekly earnings in this sector grew by 8.4% to $912.97.
The growth was most notable in postal service; couriers;
urban transit systems; and rail transportation.  Non-farm payroll employment by industry  On a month-over-month basis, non-farm payroll
employment edged down by 5,700 from December to January,
following four months of job gains averaging 24,100.
Between January 2010 and January 2011, the number of
payroll employees increased by 270,400 (+1.9%).  The drop in payroll employment in January was driven by
declines in the services sector, most notably in public
administration; real estate and rental and leasing; and
transportation and warehousing.  In public administration, payroll jobs declined by
4,300 (-0.4%) in January, with losses in both provincial
and municipal public administration. Payroll jobs in
public administration were mostly unchanged over the year.  There were smaller declines in real estate and rental
and leasing (-1,900) and transportation and warehousing 
(-1,400). While job growth in transportation and warehousing
has been relatively flat since September 2009, jobs have
been increasing in real estate and rental and leasing
since June 2010.  The goods-producing sector posted gains in January. The
largest increase was in construction (+8,200), bringing
total gains in this industry over the 12-month period to
32,300 (+4.0%). With January's increase, the construction
sector has regained all the jobs lost during the labour
market downturn.  In manufacturing, payroll employment increased by 4,700
(+0.3%) from December to January. Compared with 12 months
earlier, payroll jobs in this industry were up by 21,700
(+1.5%). Most of the gains were in machinery; fabricated
metal products; food; primary metal; and electrical
equipment, appliance and component manufacturing.  Payroll employment in mining, quarrying and oil and gas
extraction was mostly unchanged in January. However, this
sector led the way in year-over-year growth at 26,700
(+15.2%).  Hours worked and average hours worked by hourly and
salaried employees  Total hours worked by hourly and salaried employees
were unchanged in January compared with December. In the
12 months to January, total hours increased by 2.9%.  Average weekly hours worked by hourly and salaried
employees amounted to 33.2 hours in January, up 0.2% from
the previous month and up 1.3% or approximately half an
hour more compared with January 2010.  Note to readers  Every March 31, as part of the regularly scheduled year-
end review of the Survey of Employment, Payrolls and Hours
(SEPH), seasonally adjusted data are revised using the
latest seasonal factors. On March 31, a new seasonal
adjustment model (X-12-ARIMA) has been introduced.  In addition, as part of the annual review, there were
revisions to a small number of industries for the 2001 to
2010 period.  As a result, all seasonally adjusted estimates have
been revised historically back to 2001 and are available
on CANSIM (tables 281-0023 to 281-0046). To facilitate
access to the revised data, these CANSIM tables will be
free from March 31 to April 6, 2011.  The SEPH is a business census of non-farm payroll
employees.  Statistics Canada  also produces employment
estimates from its monthly Labour Force Survey (LFS). As a
result of conceptual and methodological differences,
estimates of changes from SEPH and LFS do differ from time
to time. However, the trends in the data are quite
similar.  Unless otherwise stated, this release presents
seasonally adjusted data, which facilitates comparisons by
removing the effects of seasonal variations.  All earnings data include overtime pay and exclude
businesses which could not be classified to a North
American Industrial Classification System code.  Average weekly earnings are derived by dividing total
weekly earnings by the number of employees.  Changes in average earnings can be influenced by a
number of factors. Changes in the level of earnings, the
number of payroll employees, and the number of hours
worked can have an impact. Other factors could include
compositional changes over time, such as changes in the
proportions of full-time and part-time work; proportions
of casual, senior and junior employees; the occupational
distribution within and across industries; and in the
distribution of employment between industries. Such
effects may apply differently within different provinces
and territories, and over time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
