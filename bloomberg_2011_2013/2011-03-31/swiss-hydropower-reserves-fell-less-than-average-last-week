Swiss hydroelectric reserves fell
less than average last week, slowing the decline of water used
to generate power in the Alpine country.  Reservoir levels slid 1.1 percentage point to 15.2 percent
full in the week through March 28, the Bern, Switzerland-based
Swiss Federal Energy Office said today in an e-mailed statement.
They typically drop 2.1 points in the week.  Water levels in  Switzerland  are 4.6 percentage points below
the long-term average, the data show. Switzerland relies on
hydropower for more than half its annual electricity consumption
of about 55 terawatt-hours. Water supplies typically fall from
October to April during the winter season and are replenished
from May to September by rain and melting snow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
