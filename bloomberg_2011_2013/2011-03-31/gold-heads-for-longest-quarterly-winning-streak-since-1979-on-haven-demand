Gold futures rose, capping the
longest streak of quarterly gains in more than three decades, as
fighting in Libya and European-debt concerns spurred demand for
the metal as an alternative investment. Silver also gained.  Gold futures for June delivery advanced $15, or 1.1
percent, to close at $1,439.90 an ounce at 1:53 p.m. on the
Comex in  New York , a record settlement. This quarter, the metal
climbed 1.3 percent, marking the 10th straight gain, the longest
rally since at least 1975. On March 24, the commodity reached
$1,448.60, the highest intraday price ever.  The defection of a top aide to  Muammar Qaddafi  shows that
the regime is disintegrating, U.K. Prime Minister  David Cameron 
said. The western Libyan city of Misrata faced “heavy shelling
and heavy artillery fire by Qaddafi forces throughout the
night,” a rebel spokesman told BBC World Service radio. Irish
regulators instructed four banks to raise $34 billion in
additional capital following stress tests.  “Given the unrest in the Middle East and North Africa
region, increasing debt issues in the euro zone and the
environment of historically low  interest rates , gold and silver
should continue to remain underpinned and test toward recent
highs,”  James Moore , an analyst at TheBullionDesk.com in
London, said in a report.  European inflation unexpectedly accelerated to 2.6 percent
in March, the fastest in more than two years, the European
Union’s statistics office said today.  Gold and silver are being supported by “inflation,
geopolitical and  euro zone  debt concerns,”  GoldCore Ltd.  in
Dublin said in a report.  U.S. Economy   Gains in gold were limited this quarter on signs that the
U.S. economy is improving, boosting investor appetite for
equities.  Silver futures for May delivery rose 37.7 cents, or 1
percent, to $37.888 an ounce. This quarter, the price gained 22
percent, marking the ninth straight gain, the longest rally
since at least 1975.  On March 24, the price reached $38.18, the highest since
February 1980. In that year, the metal climbed to a record of
$50.35. In the past 12 months, the commodity has more than
doubled.  “Increasing global investment and industrial demand in the
very small and finite silver-bullion market is a recipe for
higher prices,” GoldCore said. With gold near a record,
“silver is the cheap alternative and an attractive store of
value,” the company said.  Palladium futures for June delivery rose $9.80, or 1.3
percent, to $767.90 an ounce. This quarter, the metal dropped
4.4 percent after almost doubling in 2010.  Platinum futures for July delivery gained $9.10, or 0.5
percent, to $1,783.20 an ounce. This quarter, the price rose 0.3
percent after climbing 16 percent in the second half of 2010.  To contact the reporters on this story:
