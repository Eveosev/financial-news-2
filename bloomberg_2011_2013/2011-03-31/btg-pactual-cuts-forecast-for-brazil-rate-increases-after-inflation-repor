Banco BTG Pactual SA cut its
forecast for increases in  Brazil â€™s benchmark interest rate,
known as Selic, after the central bank published its quarterly
inflation report yesterday.  Policymakers are likely to raise rates by 0.25 percentage
point at their April meeting and 0.25 percentage point in June,
leading the Selic to 12.25 percent, Eduardo Loyo andClaudio Ferraz, economists at BTG Pactual in  Rio de Janeiro , wrote in a
March 30 report. BTG Pactual had previously forecast increases
of 0.5 percentage point at each meeting.  To contact the reporter on this story:
