The  Internal Revenue Service  is
extending the filing deadline of a form needed to help determine
the taxes on estates of people who died in 2010, the agency said
in a statement today.  The IRS said  Form 8939  won’t be due on April 18. It will
issue more guidance at a future date and set the new deadline at
“a reasonable period of time” after that, according to a
statement.  “It’s good news,” said Robert Romanoff, a partner at law
firm  Levenfeld Pearlstein  in Chicago. “The real question is
when it’s really going to be due.”  The estate tax disappeared in 2010 due to a phase-out
approved in 2001 during the presidency of  George W. Bush . Under
the tax-cut compromise enacted by Congress in December, the tax
was reinstated at a top rate of 35 percent with a $5 million
threshold for individuals. Under a substitute system in the
bill, heirs can choose to pay  capital gains  taxes of between 15
percent and 28 percent on inherited assets they sell.  The form is required for heirs who decide to opt out of the
estate tax for 2010, said Romanoff, who has a family that is
choosing that route because the estate is worth about $30
million.  The extension is a help to executors of estates choosing to
pay capital gains because determining the cost basis of
property, including stock held for decades, or a family
business, may require extensive research to determine the
original purchase price, said Richard Behrendt, a senior estate
planner at  Robert W. Baird & Co.  in  Milwaukee .  To contact the reporter on this story:
