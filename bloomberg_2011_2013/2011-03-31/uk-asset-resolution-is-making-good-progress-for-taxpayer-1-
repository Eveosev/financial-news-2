UK Asset Resolution, the holding
company for state-owned lenders Bradford & Bingley Plc and
Northern Rock Plc, said it’s making “good progress for the
taxpayer.”  Bradford & Bingley posted pretax profit of 200.1 million
pounds ($322 million) for 2010, compared with a loss of 166.5
million pounds a year earlier, according to a statement from
UKAR today. Costs fell 8 percent as the number of properties in
possession and accounts more than three months in arrears
dropped.  Northern Rock had underlying pretax profit of 277.4 million
pounds, compared with a loss of 313.4 million pounds in 2009,
according to the statement. Costs dropped 10 percent, while the
number of accounts more than three months in arrears rose 3
percent. The bank repaid 1.1 billion pounds of a government loan
during 2010.  “We achieved all our business objectives in 2010,” Chief
Executive Officer Richard Banks said in the statement. “The
combined business is now better placed to move forward in
2011.”  The two companies are operated separately under a single
board and management structure, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
