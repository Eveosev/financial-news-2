Ukraine’s economy expanded faster
in the fourth quarter last year than previously estimated,
driven by exports and industrial production, the state
statistics committee said.  Gross domestic product grew 3.3 percent in 2010 last
quarter, compared with the 3 percent rate reported by the Kiev-
based committee on Feb. 15. The committee left its 2010 growth
estimation unchanged at 4.2 percent, according to a statement on
its  website  today.  Ukraine’s economy returned to growth in 2010 as prices for
metals, a main driver of exports, rose. That followed a 14.8
percent slump in the previous year, the deepest recession since
1994. The economy may expand as much as 5 percent this year on
higher exports, the central bank said on March 24.  Industrial production increased 10.5 percent in the first
two months of 2011, up from 9.4 percent a year earlier, the
state statistics data shows.  To contact the reporters on this story:
