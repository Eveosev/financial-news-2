Ted Kaufman, the former Democratic
senator from  Delaware , turned down an approach from the Obama
administration about heading the U.S. Consumer Financial
Protection Bureau, two people briefed on the process said.  Kaufman is the second former elected official to rebuff an
overture to run the new agency. Jennifer Granholm, the former
governor of  Michigan , also turned it down, Bloomberg News
reported on March 22, citing two people with knowledge of the
discussions.  The people spoke on condition of anonymity because the
discussions aren’t public.  Kaufman, 72, heads the Congressional Oversight Panel on the
U.S. government’s bank bailout program. The panel’s work
officially ends April 3. He did not return a phone message
seeking comment.  At the congressional panel, Kaufman succeeded  Elizabeth Warren , the White House and Treasury Department adviser tasked
with setting up the consumer bureau. The Obama administration
has not publicly ruled out Warren as a nominee for the
director’s job.  The bureau is scheduled to start work on July 21. It will
not assume full authority until the Senate confirms a director.  To contact the reporter on this story:
