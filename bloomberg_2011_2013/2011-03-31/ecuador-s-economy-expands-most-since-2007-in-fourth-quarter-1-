Ecuador ’s economy,  South America ’s
seventh-biggest, expanded at the fastest pace in the fourth
quarter since 2007, led by construction and fishing, the central
bank said in a report today.  Gross domestic product expanded 2.64 percent in the fourth
quarter from the previous quarter, its steepest increase since
the three months ending in December 2007, the central bank said
today in a report on its  website . GDP rose 6.98 percent in the
fourth quarter over the same period a year earlier and 3.58
percent for the whole year, the central bank said.  Economic growth in Ecuador, the slowest last year after
 Venezuela  among major South American nations, was hampered by a
renegotiation of oil contracts with private producers, leading
to a 2.7 percent decline in output and refining of oil, the
country’s biggest export, according to central bank data.  The Andean country will probably grow faster than the 5.06
percent forecast in this year’s budget as conflict in the Middle
East and expected energy shortages in  Japan  following an
earthquake and tsunami boost demand for the nation’s crude,
Economic Policy Minister Katiuska King said March 24.  To contact the reporter on this story:
