Carmelo Anthony  scored 39 points
for the second straight game as the  New York  Knicks rallied from
a 16-point deficit to beat the New Jersey Nets 120-116 in the
National Basketball Association.  Anthony scored with an 11-foot shot with one minute, seven
seconds left to break a 114-114 tie at Madison Square Garden in
New York last night. Toney Douglas and Chauncey Billups each hit
two free throws in the final 42 seconds to seal the victory.  Billups had 33 points and Amarâ€™e Stoudemire scored 23 for
the Knicks (37-38), who won their second straight game. The
Knicks are seventh in the Eastern Conference while the Nets (23-
51) are 12th.  The Philadelphia 76ers moved within a win of the playoffs
with a 108-97 win over the  Houston Rockets . Another victory for
sixth-placed Philadelphia or a loss for the Charlotte Bobcats in
ninth place will ensure the 76ers advance to the postseason. The
Bobcats edged past the Cleveland Cavaliers 98-97 last night.  The Indiana Pacers kept a hold on eighth place and the
final playoff spot in the Eastern Conference with a 111-101
victory against the  Detroit Pistons .  The  Chicago Bulls , Boston Celtics,  Miami Heat , Orlando
Magic and Atlanta Hawks have already advanced to the postseason
from the Eastern Conference.  In the Western Conference, the Denver Nuggets strengthened
their grip on fifth place with a 104-90 win over the Sacramento
Kings.  The Nuggets won their fourth straight game to increase
their lead over the  Portland  Trail Blazers to 2 1/2 games. The
New Orleans Hornets moved ahead of the Trail Blazers into sixth
place with a 95-91 win over Portland.  The Memphis Grizzlies beat the Golden State Warriors 110-91
to remain eighth, three games ahead of the ninth-place Rockets
in the race for the final playoff place.  The San Antonio Spurs, NBA champion Los Angeles Lakers,
 Dallas Mavericks  and Oklahoma City Thunder have booked
postseason places in the Western Conference.  To contact the reporter on this story:
