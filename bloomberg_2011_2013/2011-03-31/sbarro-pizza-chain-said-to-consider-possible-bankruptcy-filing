Sbarro Inc., the pizza chain owned
by buyout firm MidOcean Partners, may seek bankruptcy protection
after missing interest payments on its debt, said a person
familiar with the process.  The filing may come as early as next week, said the person,
who declined to be identified because the deliberations are
private. New York-based MidOcean bought the pizza chain in 2007,
according to Sbarro’s  website . The company is still examining
options on how to restructure debt.  Sbarro, led by interim Chief Executive Officer Nicholas McGrane, owns or franchises more than 1,000 fast-food Italian
restaurants. On March 3, Sbarro obtained its third forbearance
agreement with senior lenders, allowing it to keep operating
even though it’s in breach of its debt covenants, according to a
regulatory filing.  The company failed to make interest payments on debt due in
February. Its third forbearance agreement expires April 1. The
possibility of a Sbarro bankruptcy filing was reported earlier
by the Wall Street Journal.  The Melville, New York-based chain hired law firm Kirkland
& Ellis LLP to advise on restructuring options, two people with
knowledge of the situation said in January. The company has
about $350 million in bonds and loans, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  The Sbarro family founded the company as a single Italian
delicatessen more than half a century ago in  Brooklyn ,  New York ,
according to its website. The family opened its first mall
location about a decade later.  To contact the reporter on this story:
