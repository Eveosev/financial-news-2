Ireland probably won’t need more
bailout money to help its banks, Klaus Regling, head of the
rescue fund for debt-laden euro countries, was cited as saying
in an interview with German newspaper  Sueddeutsche Zeitung .  The 35 billion euros ($49.6 billion) set aside for Irish
banks should be enough, Regling said before Ireland publishes
the results of stress tests on its banks today, according to the
newspaper. Regling said he didn’t know the test results in
advance.  The fund is big enough to aid  Portugal  if that country asks
for a bailout, while the risk of contagion for  Spain  has
declined,  Sueddeutsche  quoted Regling as saying in today’s
edition. He declined to speculate on whether the fund will
rescue Portugal, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
