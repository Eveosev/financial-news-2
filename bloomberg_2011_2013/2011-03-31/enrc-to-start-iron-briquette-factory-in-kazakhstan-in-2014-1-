Eurasian Natural Resources Corp., a
metals producer in  Kazakhstan , plans to start production at an
iron-briquette plant in the country’s northern Kostanai region
in 2014, the government said.  The facility will produce 1.4 million metric tons a year,
according to a government plan published today in
 Kazakhstanskaya Pravda , the official state newspaper. Hot-
briquetted iron is a form of compacted iron used to make steel
in blast furnaces.  Charlotte Kirkham, a spokeswoman for ENRC, put the plant’s
annual output capacity at 1.8 million tons. The facility remains
subject to board approval, she said today in an e-mail.  The London-based company also intends to boost ferrochrome
production by adding 440,000 tons of capacity at its facilities
in the Aktyubinsk region in 2012, the government said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
