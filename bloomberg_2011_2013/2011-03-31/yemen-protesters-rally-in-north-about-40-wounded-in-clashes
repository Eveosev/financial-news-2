Tens of thousands of protesters
rallied in Yemen, and about 40 were wounded in clashes with
security forces and pro-government demonstrators, a protest
leader said.  Several demonstrators in the northwestern governorate of
Hajja were hit by bullets today and five were in critical
condition, Ibrahim al-Shami, a protest organizer, said in a
telephone interview.  The opposition has repeatedly said it will not end protests
until President Ali Abdullah Saleh, who has ruled for 32-years,
steps down. Demonstrators have called for rallies tomorrow
following Friday prayers. Anti-government protests in Yemen have
been taking place for more than two months, inspired by revolts
that overthrew the presidents of Tunisia and  Egypt . A crackdown
in the capital, Sana’a, earlier this month killed as many as 46
protesters.  The U.S. has backed the government’s fight against al-Qaeda
in the Arabian Peninsula and U.S. Defense Secretary  Robert Gates 
said this week that he sees the possible fall of Saleh as a
“real problem.” Saleh’s government blamed al-Qaeda for an
explosion at a weapons factory in Abyan province on March 28. At
least 100 people were killed in the blast, according to an e-
mailed statement from the Joint Parties Meeting, the country’s
six-party opposition coalition.  To contact the reporter on this story:
