U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk
said the U.S. was “vindicated” by a World Trade Organization
ruling regarding subsidies to  Boeing Co. (BA)  and Airbus SAS.  “The WTO has vindicated the view that the United States
has taken for the last 20 years -- that the subsidies the
Europeans give to Airbus dwarf anything that the U.S. government
does for Boeing,” Kirk told reporters today in  Washington .  “The only recommendation the panel made to the United
States was to withdraw programs and tax measures worth $2.7
billion, while the recommendation for the EU affects financing
and other measures worth $20 billion,” Kirk said. “The panel
rejected most of the arguments advanced by the EU.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
