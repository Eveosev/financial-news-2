Taiwan ’s dollar strengthened to a
three-week high after the central bank raised borrowing costs to
tame inflation.  The Central Bank of the Republic of China (Taiwan) lifted
its discount rate on 10-day loans by 0.125 percentage point to
1.75 percent, as predicted by 17 of 18 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg. The increase in consumer prices accelerated to a
three-month high of 1.33 percent in February and the government
forecast last month inflation will double to 2 percent this year.  “Taiwan’s dollar rose today because of interest-rate
increase expectations,” said  Henry Lin , a Taipei-based foreign-
exchange trader at Taiwan Shin Kong Commercial Bank. “Investors
are looking forward to hearing from the central bank governor at
the meeting.”  The  Taiwan dollar  appreciated 0.3 percent to NT$29.418 as
of the 4 p.m. close, according to Taipei Forex Inc., the
strongest level since March 9. The currency advanced 3.2 percent
this quarter.  Government bonds  were little changed. The yield on the
1.375 percent note due March 2021, the most-traded government
security, was at 1.357 percent, according to Gretai Securities
Market, the island’s biggest exchange for debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
