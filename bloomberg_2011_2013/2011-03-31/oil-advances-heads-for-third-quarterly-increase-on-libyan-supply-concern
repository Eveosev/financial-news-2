Oil rose to the highest in 30 months
in  New York  on concern the conflict in  Libya ,  Africa ’s third-
largest exporter, will prolong production cuts and spread to
Middle East producers.  Futures advanced as much as 0.9 percent, extending the
biggest quarterly rally since 2009, as troops loyal to Libyan
leader  Muammar Qaddafi  retook control of the oil port of Ras
Lanuf and shelled Brega, another energy hub. Libyan oil output
fell 72 percent to a 49-year low and OPEC production slid 1.2
percent in March, a Bloomberg News survey showed.  “Libya is the key,” said  Jonathan Barratt , managing
director of Commodity Broking Services Pty in Sydney. “The
market tends to flow with what the rebel forces are doing. When
the rebels are getting on top of things, crude oil starts to
come under pressure, and as Qaddafi tries to gain control,
there’s more concern for the region.”  Crude for May delivery rose as much as 93 cents to $107.65
a barrel in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange , the highest since Sept. 26, 2008. It was at $107.24 at
8:35 p.m. London time. The contract climbed $2.45 yesterday to
$106.72 a barrel and is heading for its second weekly gain.  Futures surged 17 percent from January through March, the
strongest quarterly gain since the period ended June 2009.
Prices advanced 10 percent in March for a seventh straight
monthly gain, the longest consecutive number of increases since
the contract started trading in 1983.  Market ‘Catalyst’  New York crude outpaced London’s Brent oil futures, which
traded up 39 cents at $117.75 a barrel on the ICE Futures Europe
exchange, narrowing the gap between the benchmark contracts.
Brent traded at a $10.48 premium to WTI today, compared with a
record $19.54 on Feb. 21 and an average $11.82 last month.  Brent rallied 24 percent in the first quarter and 5 percent
last month. The contract is up 1.9 percent this week.  Libyan oil production tumbled by 995,000 barrels in March
to 390,000 barrels a day, according to the survey of  oil
companies , producers and analysts. Libya was the third-largest
oil producer in Africa before the conflict, pumping 1.59 million
barrels a day in January, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries’ crude
output dropped 363,000 barrels in March to an average 29.022
million barrels a day, the lowest level since September, as
increases from Saudi Arabia failed to make up for the decline in
Libyan production. Saudi output rose by 300,000 barrels a day to
9 million, the survey showed.  Qatar and Libya  Qatar has offered to facilitate oil sales from Libya and
use the proceeds for humanitarian aid, the British government
said in a statement released March 29 after an international
conference about Libya in  London .  The plan is likely to be stymied by port constraints and
payment restrictions, JPMorgan Chase & Co. analysts led by
 Lawrence Eagles  said in an e-mailed note today.  “After weighing all the barriers and pitfalls that might
frustrate such a well-intentioned initiative, we count ourselves
among the skeptics,” the analysts said. “We continue to
forecast a meaningful increase in spot Brent prices and price
volatility in the second quarter.”  Rebels  withdrew from Ras Lanuf in the face of artillery and
rocket attacks after advancing toward Qaddafi’s hometown of
Sirte. Many insurgents retreated from Brega, east of Ras Lanuf,
to regroup in Ajdabiya farther along the coast, about 100 miles
(160 kilometers) from the rebel stronghold of Benghazi, the
 Associated Press  said.  The strife in Libya, holder of Africa’s largest oil
reserves, is the bloodiest in a wave of uprisings that has
toppled the leaders of Tunisia and  Egypt  and spread to Algeria,
 Bahrain ,  Iran , Oman, Syria and Yemen.  Prices also advanced as the U.K urged its citizens to leave
Yemen ahead of possible violent protests today. Yemen, which
borders  Saudi Arabia , pumped 298,000 barrels a day in 2009,
according to BP Plc’s Statistical Review of World Energy.  To contact the reporters on this story:
