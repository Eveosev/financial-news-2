Home-buyers would be guaranteed the
right to repay  mortgage loans  early and receive mandatory
warnings about the dangers of borrowing money in foreign
currencies, under draft rules to be announced by European Union
officials today, the Financial Times reported.  The proposed measures would establish cross-Europe
standards for advertising mortgage credit, aim to ensure that
lenders are adequately supervised and regulated, and allow
mortgage brokers to operate anywhere in the EU once they have
been authorized, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
