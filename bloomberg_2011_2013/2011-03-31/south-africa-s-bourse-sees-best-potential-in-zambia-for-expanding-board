South Africa ’s stock exchange
operator said it sees the best potential for listings on its
 Africa  board from companies in Botswana, Zambia and Zimbabwe.  “The southern Africa region is our best opportunity,”
Maureen Dlamini, head of the Johannesburg Stock Exchange’s
Africa Board division, said in an interview at her office
yesterday.  Southern Africa is home to the world’s largest platinum
deposits, with South Africa having about 80 percent of reserves,
followed by Zimbabwe. Botswana produces more diamonds than any
other country and Zambia has 10 percent of global copper
reserves.  JSE Ltd. (JSE) , which operates Africa’s largest stock exchange,
has had two listings since creating its Africa board in 2009.
 Trustco Group Holdings Ltd. (TTO) , a property development and
financial services group, gained 20 percent on the Johannesburg
exchange since its offering in February 2009.  Wilderness Holdings Ltd. (WIL) , a Botswana-based ecotourism
company with operations in seven countries in the region, has
climbed 8.7 percent since it listed on the JSE in April 2010.  Both companies have primary listings in their home markets.  The JSE will hold the first meeting of its advisory
committee of 10 business people from South Africa, Ghana,
 Nigeria , Senegal and Sudan next week in the Ghanaian capital
Accra, Dlamini said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
