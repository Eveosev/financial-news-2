Copper in  London  headed for its
first quarterly decline since the three months ended June 2010
on speculation global growth may slow as  Japan  struggles to
contain a nuclear crisis and  China  extends its tightening
measures.  The metal for three-month delivery on the London Metal
Exchange traded little changed at $9,390 a metric ton by 8:04
a.m. Singapore time, down 2.1 percent this year. It fell 2.1
percent yesterday, the most in three weeks.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
