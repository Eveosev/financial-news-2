Quotas for grain exports imposed by
Ukraine’s government in October helped to steady domestic cereal
prices, Agriculture Minister Mykola Prysyazhnyuk said.  “We have managed to stabilize and to maintain domestic
prices for bread, wheat and feed grain,” he said in a statement
on the ministry’s website today. The “grain quota procedure was
justified,” Prysyazhnyuk said.  Legislators will vote April 5 to hold an open auction to
sell grain-export quotas, the minister said.  The cabinet yesterday approved an extension of the curbs on
outbound corn, wheat and barley shipments to July 1. The limits
had been scheduled to expire today. The government also
increased the allowance for corn by 2 million metric tons,
raising the total grain export quota through the end of the
marketing year on June 30 to 6.2 million tons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
