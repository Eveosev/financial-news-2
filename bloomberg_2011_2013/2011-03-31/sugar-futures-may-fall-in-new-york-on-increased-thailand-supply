Sugar may fall next week on bets
that output will rise in  Thailand , the world’s largest exporter
after  Brazil .  Five of 11 traders, analysts and brokers surveyed by
Bloomberg News said raw sugar traded in New York will decline,
while four said it will gain. Two were neutral. Before today,
the commodity fell 2.7 percent this week to 27.11 cents a pound.  Four of 11 survey respondents said refined sugar on
 London ’s NYSE Liffe exchange will slump, and three said it will
rise. Four were neutral.  Refined sugar’s premium over raw sweetener may be little
changed next week, according to five respondents. Three said it
will narrow, and three expect it to widen.  To contact the reporters on this story:
