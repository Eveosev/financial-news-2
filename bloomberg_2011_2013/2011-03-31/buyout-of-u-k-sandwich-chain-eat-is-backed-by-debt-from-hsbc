Lyceum Capital Partners LLP hired
HSBC Holdings Plc to provide debt for the management buyout of
sandwich and salad chain  Eat Ltd .  Lyceum Capital agreed to buy a controlling stake in Eat
from Penta Capital LLP, investing alongside Eat founders and
management, the London-based private-equity firm said in a
 statement  March 29. It didn’t disclose the value of the deal.  Cheaper food outlets are benefiting as consumers’ spending
is squeezed by rising food prices, increased value-added tax and
the deepest government spending cuts since World War II.
Discounters Lidl and Aldi Group increased their share of the
U.K. grocery market in the last three months as shoppers sought
out less expensive food products, according to research company
Kantar Worldpanel. U.K. retail sales growth was subdued in
March, according to the  Confederation of British Industry .  Eat’s sales exceeded 85 million pounds ($137 million) over
the past twelve months, compared with 68 million pounds in 2008,
according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
