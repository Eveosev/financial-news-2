(Corrects story first published March 31 to show  China 
Eastern Airlines shares fell.)  Hong Kong stocks rose, keeping the
Hang Seng Index at its highest level in three weeks, as Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. recommended buying banking and property shares,
and amid signs a U.S. economic recovery is strengthening.  China Resources Land Ltd. (1109) , a state-controlled developer,
climbed 3.4 percent. Bank of Communications Ltd. gained 1.9
percent after saying full-year profit rose 30 percent last year.
 Techtronic Industries Co. (669) , which got 76 percent of its 2009
revenue from  North America , added 2.7 percent as a report showed
U.S. companies added more workers in March.  Foxconn
International Holdings Ltd. (2038) , the No. 1 contract manufacturer of
mobile phones, sank 4.5 percent after posting a wider-than-
estimated full-year net loss.  The Hang Seng Index rose for a second straight day, gaining
0.3 percent to 23,527.52 at the 4 p.m. close of Hong Kong
trading, the highest level since the March 10 close, the day
before an earthquake and tsunami struck  Japan . Property and
banking stocks led gains. The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index
of Chinese companies’ H shares advanced 1.2 percent to 13,315.84.  “The U.S. jobs numbers were quite strong, and point to a
sustainable recovery in employment,” said Nader Naeimi, a
Sydney-based strategist at AMP Capital Investors Ltd., which
manages about $98 billion worldwide.  China Resources  climbed 3.1 percent to HK$14.56.  China
Overseas Land & Investment Ltd. (688) , controlled by the nation’s
construction ministry, advanced 0.5 percent to HK$15.82.  Goldman Sachs  Goldman Sachs raised its rating on Chinese stocks to
“overweight” from “market weight” on signs monetary policy
tightening may ease. It maintained a 12-month forecast of 16,500
for the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index, according to a report
by analysts led by Helen Zhu and Timothy Moe.  “We favor banks and property” the report’s authors said.  Hong Kong stocks gained even as stocks in mainland China
fell for a third day, the longest losing streak this year, on
speculation this quarter’s rally may be excessive given the
prospect the central bank will keep increasing  interest rates  to
slow inflation.  “Fighting against inflation is the focus of the
government’s work this year,” said Liu Jianwei, who manages
about $214 million at Bosera Asset Management Co. “Given the
uncertainty at home and overseas, including the unrest in North
Africa and Japan, investors will keep cautious.”  U.S. Jobs  Bank of Communications gained 2.9 percent to HK$8.56.
China’s fifth-largest lender said full-year profit rose 30
percent last year to 39 billion yuan ($5.9 billion), compared
with the 38 billion yuan average estimate of 17 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg. Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd.
advanced 1.3 percent to HK$6.46.  China Eastern Airlines Corp., the nation’s second-largest
carrier, fell 0.7 percent to HK$2.99 after the company said
profit surged about 29-fold last year to 4.96 billion yuan from
a year earlier.  Techtronic, a maker of Hoover vacuum cleaners, advanced 3.7
percent to HK$10.80. Yue Yuen Industries Holdings Ltd., a
supplier of athletic shoes for Adidas AG and Nike Inc., climbed
2.5 percent to HK$24.75.  A report from ADP Employer Services showed U.S. companies
hired 201,000 workers in March, marking the third time in four
months the nation added more than 200,000 jobs.  PetroChina Co., the nation’s biggest oil producer, advanced
0.9 percent to HK$11.78 as oil headed for a third quarterly gain
in  New York  as investors weighed rising supplies in the U.S.,
the world’s largest crude consumer, against concern the Libyan
conflict will escalate.  Among stocks that fell today, Foxconn International plunged
4.5 percent to HK$4.67. The Hong Kong-listed unit of the Foxconn
Technology Group posted a full-year net loss that was wider than
analysts estimated as costs increased and sales shrank.  The net loss was $218.3 million, compared with net income
of $38.6 million in 2009, Foxconn said in a Hong Kong stock
exchange filing yesterday. The mean estimate of seven analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg was for a net loss of $202 million.  Futures on the  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  gained 0.3 percent to 23,515.  To contact the reporter on this story:
