Kuwait will deport three Iranian
diplomats who, a court ruled, were involved with a spy network,
 Al-Qabas  reported, citing Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed al- Sabah.  The court, which sentenced two Iranians and a Kuwaiti to
death for alleged involvement with the spy network, “proved
this cell’s direct links to  Iran , and precisely Iran’s
Revolutionary Guard,” Al-Qabas cited Sheikh Mohammed as saying.  Kuwait recalled its ambassador to Tehran for talks, the
foreign minister said yesterday in an interview. The Persian
Gulf state will also summon the Iranian charge d’affaires to
express its displeasure, according to Al-Qabas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
