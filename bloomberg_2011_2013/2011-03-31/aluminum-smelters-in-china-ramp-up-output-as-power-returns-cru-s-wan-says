Most of the aluminum-production
capacity in  China  that was halted on power curbs last year has
been restarted, according to researcher CRU International Ltd.,
boosting output in the world’s largest consumer of the metal.  About 1 million metric tons of annual smelting capacity has
resumed output and a further 200,000 tons may return soon, said
Wan Ling, a Beijing-based aluminum analyst. Some 400,000 tons of
capacity may not be restarted, she said.  China’s production of aluminum slumped last September to
the lowest level since July 2009 as local governments reduced
electricity supplies to power-intensive industries to meet an
energy-efficiency target. Wan said in January about 1.6 million
tons of capacity had been shut since July.  “Output in March may rise by 3 percent to 5 percent from
February,”  Eric Zhang , an analyst at data provider  Shanghai 
Metals Market, said by phone today. The output data will be
released by the National Bureau of Statistics next month.  Aluminum output in February increased to 1.31 million tons
from January’s 1.30 million, according to statistics bureau
figures. Over the first two months of 2011, production fell 1.6
percent compared with the year-ago period. Output last September
dropped to 1.17 million tons, statistics bureau figures show.  Three-month aluminum on the London Metal Exchange has
gained 7.1 percent this year, and climbed 0.6 percent to $2,645
per ton at 3:51 p.m. in Shanghai today. The metal for June
delivery on the Shanghai Futures Exchange, or SHFE, closed 0.4
percent lower at 16,775 yuan ($2,561) per ton.  Half the Cost  Energy accounts for as much as half the cost of making
aluminum, which is used in window frames and beverage cans.
China’s efficiency drive aimed to reduce energy consumption per
unit of gross domestic product, cutting so-called  energy
intensity  by 20 percent in the five years to December 2010.  Aluminum stockpiles in SHFE-monitored warehouses declined
to 411,438 tons last week, the lowest level since April 2, 2010,
data from the bourse show. The reserves have dropped 17 percent
since reaching 498,068 tons in the week to June 11, 2010 as
users drew down inventories as monthly production declined.  Aluminum “consumption is quite good now, matching the
seasonal peak in November,” Wan said.  China’s so-called actual aluminum demand may expand 8.7
percent to 18.21 million tons in 2011, down from growth of 20
percent last year because of a slowdown in the construction and
automobile sectors, according to CRU.  The price of the metal may climb to as high as $2,800 a ton
as a shortfall drains SHFE stockpiles, Macquarie Bank Ltd. said
in a research report on March 7. “Even a strong ramp up in
supply is set to see the Chinese market in deficit through at
least March and April,” said the analysts led by Max Layton.  -- Helen Sun . With assistance from Glenys Sim in  Singapore .
