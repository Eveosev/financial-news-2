Indonesia ’s rupiah traded near the
strongest level in almost four years after the central bank said
it will tolerate gains to contain rising prices.  A government report tomorrow will show consumer prices rose
6.99 percent this month from a year earlier, after a 6.84
percent gain in February, according to the median estimate of
economists surveyed by Bloomberg. Perry Warjiyo, director of
economic research at the central bank, said March 25 that  Bank
Indonesia  aims to reduce import costs by allowing the rupiah to
strengthen.  “The central bank has taken a comfortable approach and is
allowing the rupiah to appreciate to fight inflation instead of
increasing interest rates,” said Gundy Cahyadi, a Singapore-
based economist at Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp. “Higher
inflation may be positive for the rupiah in a way.”  The rupiah was little changed at 8,710 against the dollar
as of 8:33 a.m. in Jakarta today, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It touched 8,701 yesterday, the strongest level since
May 2007. The currency has advanced 3.1 percent this year, the
second-best performance among  Asia ’s 10 most-traded currencies
and the biggest quarterly rise in a year.  The central bank sees  core inflation  possibly increasing in
March due to rising commodity prices, Warjiyo said. Indonesia
last raised its benchmark interest rate by a quarter of a
percentage point to 6.75 percent on Feb. 4, the first increase
since October 2008. Policy makers next meet on April 12 to
review the  reference rate .  To contact the reporter on this story:
