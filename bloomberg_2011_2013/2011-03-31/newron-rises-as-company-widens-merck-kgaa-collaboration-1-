Newron Pharmaceuticals SpA (NWRN)  rose in
Zurich trading after saying it will develop two of  Merck KGaA (MRK) ’s
neurological compounds, broadening the companies’ collaboration.  Newron gained 25 centimes, or 3.9 percent, to 6.70 Swiss
francs at the 5:30 p.m. close of trading, after advancing as
much as 7.6 percent earlier, the biggest intraday gain since
Feb. 15. The stock has increased 18 percent this year, giving
Newron a market value of 48.7 million francs ($53.2 million).  The manufacturer, which has its headquarters in Bresso,
 Italy , now holds the rights to develop pruvanserin and
sarizotan, two drugs that act on neurotransmitters in the brain,
the companies said today in a statement. Darmstadt, Germany-
based Merck has the right to reclaim the drugs, with Newron
keeping a co-development option.  To contact the reporter on this story:
