Korea Resources Corp. said the $5.3
billion Ambatovy nickel project in Madagascar will begin initial
production in the second half and is set to become one of the
top three nickel mines in the world by capacity.  The mine will produce 60,000 metric tons a year from 2013,
accounting for 5 percent of global output, the Seoul-based state
explorer said in an e-mailed statement today. A South Korean
group led by Korea Resources plans to ship 30,000 tons of nickel
a year, about a quarter of the nation’s needs, to the domestic
market for 15 years, the company said.  The Korean group owns a combined 27.5 percent stake in the
project, including 17.5 percent by Korea Resources, 4 percent by
 Daewoo International Corp. (047050)  and 3 percent by  Samsung C&T Corp. (000830) ,
the statement said. The rest is owned by Hyundai Heavy
Industries Co. and STX Corp. and  Hyundai Corp. (011760) , it said.  Other partners include  Canada ’s  Sherritt International
Corp. (S) , which owns 40 percent, and  Japan ’s  Sumitomo Corp. (8053)  with
27.5 percent, Korea Resources said.  Nickel, a key raw material used to make stainless steel,
has risen about 4.2 percent on the London Metal Exchange in the
past year. The metal for delivery in three months was little
changed at $26,050 a ton at 7:06 p.m.  Seoul  time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
