Japan ’s earthquake and tsunami, the
European debt crisis and turmoil in the Middle East are adding
uncertainty to the global economic recovery, China’s Vice
Premier Wang Qishan said at a Group of 20 Nations seminar today.  Excessive global liquidity and volatile commodity markets
are also clouding the outlook, Wang said at the beginning of the
day-long conference in the southern Chinese city of Nanjing
where leaders including French President Nicolas Sarkozy and U.S.
Treasury Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner  are debating how to
reform the international monetary system.  An overhaul of the system “will help promote the sound
development of global trade and orderly capital flows, and
prevent drastic fluctuations in exchange rates and commodity
prices,” Wang said.  --Mike Forsythe, Bonnie Cao. Editors: Nerys Avery,  John Liu   To contact the Bloomberg News staff on this story:
