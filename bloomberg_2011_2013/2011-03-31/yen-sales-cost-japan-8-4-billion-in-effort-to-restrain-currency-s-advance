Japan ’s Ministry of Finance said
692.5 billion yen ($8.4 billion) was  sold  last month, showing
the government’s efforts to bring the currency down from a
postwar high that threatened a recovery from its biggest-ever
earthquake.  The sales occurred from Feb. 25 to March 29, the ministry
said yesterday in Tokyo. The currency strengthened to a record
76.25 per dollar on March 17, prompting the Group of Seven
nations to jointly intervene in foreign-exchange markets the
next day for the first time in more than a decade. The yen had
risen on prospects Japanese investors would repatriate assets to
pay for rebuilding.  “The currency movements after the joint intervention show
this was an unusually effective intervention,” said  Masafumi Yamamoto , chief currency strategist at Barclays Bank Plc in
Tokyo. “It was effective because it halted the yen’s advance
with smaller amounts of money than the one in last autumn.  The yen traded at 82.83 per dollar at 4:57 p.m. yesterday
in  London , from 82.89 in  New York  a day earlier, and compared
with 82.98 on March 10, a day before the magnitude-9 temblor
struck. The currency was at 117.49 per euro from 117.10, having
weakened from 114.49 on March 10.  G-7 finance chiefs said in a joint statement on March 18
they will “provide any needed cooperation” with Japan. “We
will monitor exchange markets closely and will cooperate as
appropriate,” the statement also said. The G-7 members hadn’t
stepped in the market together since September 2000 when they
sought to support the euro as it tumbled in its second year of
existence.  September Intervention  Japan unilaterally sold 2.12 trillion yen in foreign-
exchange markets from Aug. 28 through Sept. 28 in its first
intervention since 2004 to keep the yen from reaching its
previous postwar high of 79.75 per dollar reached in April 1995.  The  Bank of Japan  pumped 40 trillion yen into the banking
system in successive one-day emergency cash operations from
March 14 to March 22 to try to settle financial markets after
the quake. The Japanese government said there’s no evidence
insurance companies were repatriating assets from abroad due to
the risk of radiation leaks from a quake-crippled nuclear plant.  Totan Research Co. had estimated that the BOJ may have
spent about 690 billion yen when it intervened in the  currency
markets  on March 18, based on the central bank’s holdings of
 government securities . The BOJ’s debt assets temporarily
increase when Japan intervenes because the government sells
bills to the bank to obtain funds for intervention, said Izuru Kato, chief market economist at Totan Research in  Tokyo .  To contact the reporters on this story:
