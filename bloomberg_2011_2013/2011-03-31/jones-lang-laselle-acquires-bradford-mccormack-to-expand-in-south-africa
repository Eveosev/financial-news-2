Jones Lang LaSalle Inc. (JLL) , the
world’s second-biggest publicly traded commercial-property
broker, bought South Africa’s  Bradford McCormack & Associates 
for an undisclosed sum to enter Africa’s largest economy.  “This new combination will provide a powerful springboard
to our growth aspirations in South Africa and its near
neighbors,” Christian Ulbrich, Jones Lang LaSalle’s head of
Europe, Middle East and Africa, said in a statement distributed
in Johannesburg today. Bradford McCormack’s clients include  Absa
Group Ltd. (ASA) , South Africa’s largest retail bank,  Nestle SA (NESN)  and
JSE Ltd., operator of Johannesburg’s stock and bond exchanges.  Jones Lang, which was started in 1997, has operations in
the U.S., Asia and Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Like
lenders such as Standard Bank Group Ltd., Africa’s largest bank,
it wants to capture growing financial and economic ties between
 Asia  and Africa. The growth in many African economies is
expected to outpace that of developed countries in the next five
years according to reports from the International Monetary Fund.  “With Asian economies spearheading a strong influx of
foreign direct investment into sub-Saharan Africa, we see
important synergies rapidly developing between our new
Johannesburg office and our clients in China and India,”
Vincent Lottefier, head of Jones Lang’s corporate solutions unit
in Europe, Middle East and Africa, said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
