The discount on United Nations
emission credits widened to a record as Camco International Ltd.
and Huaneng Renewables Corp. agreed to develop 20 windfarms in
 China , boosting supply.  The 2012 discount on Certified Emission Reduction credits
compared with European Union carbon allowances widened 1.8
percent to 5.16 euros ($7.33) a metric ton on the ICE Futures
Europe exchange in London. EU allowances for December, the
benchmark contract, advanced 1.4 percent today to close at 17.28
euros a ton. The EU contract rose 21 percent this quarter, the
biggest jump since June 2008, after  Germany  closed reactors.  The Camco agreement is designed to generate 7.5 million
tons of credits through 2015, boosting supply, according to a
statement distributed by Regulatory News Service. Camco jumped
3.7 percent in London trading to close at 17.75 pence, the
highest price since Sept. 30.  EU factories and power stations can use credits from China
after 2012, assuming those emitters have not used their so-
called credit import limits and the projects are registered by
UN-overseen regulators by the end of 2012,  according to the
rules  of the blocâ€™s program.  Supply of new UN credits more than tripled to 23 million
tons this month and will probably jump another 25 million next
month, according to UN data.  To contact the reporters on this story:
