John Nacos, the global head of
commercial real estate at  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) , has left the lender,
according to people with knowledge of the matter.  Nacos helped Deutsche Bank AG partner with  UBS AG (UBSN)  to
arrange $2.2 billion of bonds tied to commercial mortgages last
month in the largest deal of its type since 2007. He joined the
Frankfurt-based bank in 2001 and was previously head of its
commercial real-estate group in  Europe . Jonathan Pollack, who’s
been with the bank for 12 years, will be assuming responsibility
for commercial real estate in the Americas, said the people, who
declined to be identified as the moves haven’t been made public.  Amanda Williams, a Deutsche Bank spokeswoman, declined to
comment. Nacos couldn’t be reached for comment.  The exit follows the departure of Adam Behlman, head of
U.S. real estate finance and commercial mortgage-backed
securities at UBS, who left  Switzerland ’s largest bank last
week. The moves are occurring as banks compete for a projected
$45 billion of sales this year, according to JPMorgan Chase &
Co., after $3.4 billion of offerings in 2009. They’ve arranged
about $8 billion in commercial-mortgage backed bonds this year,
compared with $11.5 billion in all of 2010, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
