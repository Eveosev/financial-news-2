Tencent Holdings Ltd. (700)  said Chief
Executive Officer Ma Huateng disposed some of his shares in
China’s biggest Internet company by revenue at a discount,
having agreed to a sale price two years ago.  Ma sold 2 million Tencent shares at an average price of
HK$67.81 apiece on March 28, according to a  Hong Kong  stock
exchange filing yesterday. That is a more than 65 percent less
than the stock’s closing price of HK$195.20 yesterday.  The sale price has “no relevance to the current price and
outlook,” Catherine Chan, a spokeswoman at Tencent, said by
phone today.  Tencent dropped the most in two weeks in Hong Kong trading
today while the benchmark  Hang Seng Index  gained. The so-called
“caller transaction” agreement required the billionaire
executive to sell the securities at a pre-determined price when
the contract is due, she said.  The stock fell 2.9 percent to HK$189.50, the biggest
decline since March 17. Hong Kong’s benchmark Hang Seng Index
rose 0.3 percent.  Ma’s holdings in Tencent dropped to 11.05 percent from
11.16 percent after this week’s sale, the filing showed. Chan
declined to say if Ma is under contract for further share
disposals.  To contact the reporter on this story:
