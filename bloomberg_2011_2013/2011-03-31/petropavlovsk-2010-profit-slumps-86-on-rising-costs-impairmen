Petropavlovsk Plc (POG) , a miner of gold
in  Russia , said full-year profit slumped 86 percent after costs
rose and it wrote down the value of a joint venture.  Net income fell to $19.8 million in 2010 from $143.2
million a year earlier, London-based Petropavlovsk said today in
a statement. Sales advanced 30 percent to $612 million.  Gold producers are battling with increasing costs even as
gold prices are buoyed by rising demand for precious metals amid
 Europe â€™s sovereign-debt woes. Petropavlovsk said cash costs at
its hard-rock mines climbed 84 percent to $558 an ounce.  The company, which produced 506,800 ounces of gold last
year, said the average selling price rose 29 percent to $1,253
an ounce. Gold for immediate delivery gained 30 percent in 2010
and jumped to a record $1,432.50 in December.  Petropavlovsk wrote down the value of its titanium sponge
joint venture in the first half of the year. The company
declared a final dividend of 7 pence a share.  To contact the reporter on this story:
