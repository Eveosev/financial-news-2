U.K. coffee sales may climb 7.9
percent this year to 2.1 billion pounds ($3.37 billion),
according to Jeffrey Young, managing director of Allegra
Strategies Ltd., a London-based research company.  “High prices won’t dent demand,” Young said in an
interview at a conference in  London  today. Coffee shops in the
U.K. owned by chains such as Starbucks Corp. will number 14,842
this year, up 5.8 percent from last year, he said. Prices will
remain higher than the 10-year average because of demand, he
said. Arabica coffee futures traded in  New York  are $2.6395 a
pound, more than double the 10-year average of $1.0658 a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
