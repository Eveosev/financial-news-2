India’s 11-year bonds completed a
second quarterly decline as the central bank boosted borrowing
costs twice this year to help counter accelerating inflation.  Yields were at a one-week high on speculation the
resumption of debt sales at the start of the new financial year
next week, following a two-month hiatus, will depress demand for
existing notes. The  finance ministry  will sell 120 billion
rupees ($2.7 billion) of debt before April 8, according to an
issuance calendar published by the central bank on March 25.  “Inflation concerns persist and that is reducing
appetite,” said Debendra Kumar Dash, a fixed-income trader at
Development Credit Bank in Mumbai. “Bonds are lower as
investors are probably making room for new debt.”  The yield on the 8.08 percent note due August 2022, India’s
most-traded government security, rose four basis points this
quarter to 8.09 percent at the 5 p.m. close in Mumbai, according
to the central bank’s trading system. The rate was little
changed today.
      Inflation unexpectedly quickened to 8.3 percent in
February from 8.2 percent the previous month, official data
showed on March 14.  India ’s benchmark interest rate, the
repurchase auction rate at which lenders borrow from the central
bank, has been raised eight times since March 2010 to 6.75
percent.  The government plans to borrow 4.17 trillion rupees through
debt sales in the fiscal year through March 2012.  The cost of one-year interest-rate swaps, or derivative
contracts used to guard against fluctuations in borrowing costs,
rose 27 basis points this quarter to 7.41 percent. A basis point
is the equivalent of 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
