U.S. derivatives rules being
crafted under the Dodd-Frank Act will fail if they let buyers
and sellers trade in markets without price transparency,
 Commodity Futures Trading Commission  member  Scott O’Malia  said.  “I will not view the commissions’ efforts as a success if
we create a market structure that fractures liquidity and
creates an incentive to utilize dark pools, simply because our
rules do not provide the flexibility necessary to facilitate on-
exchange transactions,” O’Malia said today in remarks prepared
for a meeting on swap execution facilities. Dark pools are
private venues that allow stock trades without publicly
displaying bids and offers.  The CFTC and the  Securities and Exchange Commission  are
writing rules to govern derivatives markets after largely
unregulated trades exacerbated the subprime mortgage crisis in
2008. Dodd-Frank, the financial-regulation overhaul enacted in
July, requires the two agencies to define new swap execution
facilities as an alternative to exchanges.  O’Malia, one of two Republicans on the five-member
commission, is leading today’s meeting, billed as a “SEF
Showcase” to explore attributes necessary to make the
facilities successful. Representatives from  BlackRock Inc. (BLK) ,
Pacific Investment Management Co.,  CME Group Inc. (CME)  and  GFI Group
Inc. (GFIG) , among financial firms, are scheduled to attend.  To contact the reporter on this story:
