The U.S. government is being urged
to provide more cash for the regulator that issues permits for
deep-water drilling in the  Gulf of Mexico , to ensure that oil
production isn’t held up, the Financial Times reported.  The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and
Enforcement stopped granting permits after BP Plc’s Gulf oil
spill last year; issuance was resumed last month, the FT said.  Michael Bromwich , who heads the bureau, told the newspaper
that one of the main difficulties over the decades has been
“the starvation diet this agency has been on.”  The bureau has 60 inspectors to monitor 4,000 facilities,
the newspaper said.  Bromwich pointed out that a request by President Barack
Obama for an extra $100 million for the agency in the 2011
financial year has yet to be approved by Congress, the FT added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
