Militias loyal to  Ivory Coast ’s
incumbent President Laurent Gbagbo killed at least 37 immigrants
near the country’s western border with Liberia on March 22,
 Human Rights Watch  said in a release today.  Men armed with automatic weapons, rocket-propelled grenades
and machetes entered the village of Bedi-Gouzan, 32 kilometers
(20 miles) from the western town of Guiglo, and killed immigrant
workers from Mali and Burkina Faso, many of whom worked on
nearby cocoa plantations, the New York-based rights group said,
citing witnesses.  The workers were targeted on suspicion of being supporters
of  Alassane Ouattara , the internationally recognized winner of
Ivory Coast’s Nov. 28 presidential election.  The United Nations Security Council voted yesterday to
freeze the foreign assets and bar travel for Gbagbo, his wife,
and three aides.  To contact the reporters on this story:
