Copper in  London  rebounded from the
biggest drop in three weeks as expectations that supplies will
lag behind demand outweighed concerns that global economic
growth may slow.  Three-month-delivery copper on the London Metal Exchange
gained as much as 0.7 percent to $9,450 a metric ton, and traded
at $9,435 at 2:56 p.m. in Singapore. It dropped 2.1 percent
yesterday, the most since March 9, and is headed for its first
quarterly decline since the three months to June 30, 2010.  “There’s been a tug-of-war between the bulls and bears in
the past few weeks, resulting in volatile trading in a rather
wide range,” said Liu Biyuan, an analyst at GF Futures Co.
“Any news of supply-side disruptions will support those who are
already expecting a tight market this year.”  Codelco, the largest copper producer, said it started
planning for the shutdown of its Ventanas smelter in  Chile  after
receiving a court order to halt operations after a gas leak.
Ventanas produced 384,819 tons of electrolytic copper in 2009.  Global refined-copper usage is expected to grow 4.5 percent
to 19.7 million tons, while output may gain 1.1 percent to about
19.3 million tons this year, resulting in a 435,000-ton
shortfall, according to the International Copper Study Group.  Copper futures on the Comex in  New York  rose as much as 0.6
percent to $4.2985 a pound, while the metal for June delivery on
the Shanghai Futures Exchange fell as much as 1.5 percent to
70,230 yuan ($10,721) a ton.  Economic Recovery  “We’re still positive on the economic recovery,” said
Yingxi Yu, Barclays Capital’s commodities analyst in  Singapore .
“We don’t think the events in the Middle East and  Japan  will
derail the global economic recovery so anything that’s leveraged
to economic recovery will still be relatively attractive.”  Copper in London, which reached a record $10,190 on Feb. 15,
has dropped 1.7 percent this quarter on speculation that global
economic growth may be hampered by Japan’s worst earthquake on
record and China’s monetary-tightening measures.  Japan’s manufacturing deteriorated at the fastest pace in
at least nine years this month, as the March 11 earthquake and
tsunami shut factories and crippled a nuclear plant. The  United
Nations ’s nuclear watchdog agency warned that a potential
uncontrolled chain reaction could cause further radiation leaks.  In  China , the central bank has boosted banks’ reserve-
requirement ratio eight times and raised  interest rates  three
times since the start of 2010 to cool the economy and tame
inflation. The People’s Bank of China may raise interest rates
again in early April, Citigroup Inc. said.  Aluminum in London rose 0.2 percent to $2,633.50 a ton, and
lead gained 0.3 percent to $2,662 a ton. Zinc was little changed
at $2,335 a ton, while nickel climbed 0.3 percent to $26,099 a
ton. Tin fell 0.2 percent to $31,200 a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
