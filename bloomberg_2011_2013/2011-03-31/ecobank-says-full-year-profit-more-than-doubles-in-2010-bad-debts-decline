Ecobank Transnational Inc. (ETI) ,
 Africa ’s largest lender by geographical spread, said full-year
profit more than doubled as net interest income rose and bad
loans dropped.  Net income for th year through December increased to $112.7
million from $51.1 million a year earlier, the Togo-based
banking group said in a statement published on its  website 
today. Net interest income climbed to $474.8 million from $459
million, it said.  Ecobank, which is listed in Ghana, Nigeria and on West
Africa’s regional bourse, posted a decline in profit in 2009
after 10 of Nigeria’s banks failed a central bank audit. Ecobank
continued to grow last year, buying a financial services company
in  Zimbabwe , and plans to slow down its expansion this year to
consolidate its position across Africa. In  South Africa , the
lender already has an alliance with  Nedbank Group Ltd. (NED)   Ecobank’s non-performing loans ratio was 15.2 percent
compared with 16 percent a year earlier, the lender said, adding
that $330 million of those loans in Nigeria were sold to that
country’s Asset Management Corporation this year.  “If this sale had taken place before 31 December 2010, the
non-performing loan ratio would have been 9.4 percent,” Ecobank
said.  In Nigeria, Ecobank rose 5 kobo, or 3.2 percent, to 16
naira at the 2:30 p.m. close in Lagos, Nigeria’s commercial
capital. The stock gained 1 pesewa, or 7.1 percent, to 15
pesewas in Accra, Ghana’s capital.  “The banking group embarked on an aggressive expansion
drive across the continent in 2008 and 2009,” Doris Yaa Ahiati,
an analyst with Accra-based Databank Financial Services Ltd.’s
stock market research unit, said by phone from  Accra  today. “It
continues to entrench its position in the market and we expect
to see even higher profit from them.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
