Kosovo, the Balkan nation that
became an independent country in 2008, adopted this year’s
budget, which takes into account the sale of the state phone
company.  Lawmakers approved the budget in a 66-25 vote, with revenue
estimated at 1.26 billion euros ($1.79 billion) and spending at
1.43 billion euros, according to public broadcaster
 Radiotelevizioni i Kosoves .  The shortfall will be covered by the planned sale of 75
percent of phone company  Posta dhe Telekomunikacioni i Kosoves
Sh.A. , which may fetch as much as 600 million euros, according
to the Kosovo Economy and  Finance Ministry .  Kosovo, the predominantly Albanian nation of 2 million
people, in July agreed on 110 million euros in aid from the
 International Monetary Fund  to keep its economy afloat. The IMF
delegation held talks with officials from Prime Minister Hashim
Thaci’s government earlier this month to persuade them not to
increase public-sector salaries 50 percent as Thaci promised
before the December vote.  The Bonn-based  Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE) ,  Croatia ’s T-Hrvatski
Telekom d.d. and Istanbul-based Turkcell Iletisim Hizmetleri AS
are considering bids for PTK, according to former Finance and
Economy Minister Ahmet Shala.  To contact the reporters on this story:
