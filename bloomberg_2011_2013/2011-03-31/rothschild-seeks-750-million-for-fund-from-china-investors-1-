RIT Capital Partners Plc (RCP)  is helping
raise $750 million from Chinese wanting to invest in private
equity deals overseas, Chairman  Jacob Rothschild  said.  The London-based investment trust is working with Chinese
industrial group  Creat Group  and Beijing-based investment-
advisory boutique Quercus Ventures to create J. Rothschild Creat
Partners, the parties said in a statement today. The newly
formed fund manager will buy “significant” minority stakes in
closely held firms outside of China, excluding Japan, they said.  “This unique venture will allow China’s private sector to
invest in Western companies, whilst providing opportunities for
Western companies to enter China’s rapidly growing and vibrant
economy,” Jacob Rothschild said in the statement.  RIT and Creat will commit  seed capital  to the fund and
other investors will primarily come from the China International
Chamber of Commerce, whose mandate is to help Chinese companies
invest overseas, according to the statement. Creat’s founder,
Dr. Zheng, is chairman of the Chinese chamber.  “Increased integration through overseas investment by the
Chinese private sector and further participation in China’s
growth by Western companies is an important step for the global
economy,” Zheng said in the statement.  Creat was founded in 1992 and has interests in banks,
pharmaceutical companies, electricity-equipment manufacturing
and juice-concentrate production, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
