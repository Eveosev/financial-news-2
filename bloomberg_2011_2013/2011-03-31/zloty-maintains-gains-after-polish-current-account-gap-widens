Poland’s zloty maintained gains
against the euro after the nation’s central bank said the
current-account deficit widened.  The zloty advanced 0.3 percent to 4.0062 per euro as of
2:09 p.m. in Warsaw.  The deficit grew to 5.28 billion euros, the Warsaw-
based Narodowy Bank Polski said today. The gap was wider than
the 4.99 billion-euro median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of
20 economists and compares with a revised shortfall of 3.72
billion euros in the third quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
