AES Corp. (AES) , the U.S. power producer
with operations in more than two dozen countries, will put into
operation at the end of April its 1.3 billion-euro ($1.8
billion) power plant at Galabovo in southeastern  Bulgaria .  The plant, part of the Maritsa East mining and power
generation complex, has two units which will operate at part of
their capacity, at 210 megawatts each, Roy Reed, chief executive
officer of AES Galabovo, told reporters in Sofia today. They
will reach their full capacity of 235 megawatts each by the end
of the year, he said.  The two units were scheduled to be operational in October
and November 2010 and their start was delayed by technical
problems, Reed said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
