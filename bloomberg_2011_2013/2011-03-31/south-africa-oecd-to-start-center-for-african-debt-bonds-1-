South Africa ’s government and the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development plan to
set up a center that will help develop  Africa ’s debt markets.  “A memorandum of understanding will be signed soon between
the minister of finance and the secretary-general of the OECD”
to establish the center, which is expected to come into
operation in June, Jabulani Sikhakhane, a spokesman for South
Africa’s National Treasury, said in e-mailed comments today.
“This is an African initiative, where African countries and
relevant stakeholders will work together towards better markets
and practices in Africa.”  The new institution will also seek to encourage cooperation
between African countries on public debt-management issues,
publish an African bond monitor and compile African debt data.  The centre will be staffed by a managing director, a bond
analyst and an administrator, and be based at the  Development
Bank  of Southern Africa’s office in Midrand, near Johannesburg
