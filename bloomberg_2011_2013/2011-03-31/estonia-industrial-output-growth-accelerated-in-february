Estonian industrial production
increased in February at a faster annual pace than in the
previous month as exports improved and domestic demand rose.  Production increased 31.4 percent from a year earlier,
compared with a revised 29.1 percent the previous month, the
Tallinn-based statistics office said today on its website.  Rising demand for  Estonia â€™s goods and services at its key
Nordic trading partners, Finland and  Sweden , helped the $19
billion economy expand 6.7 percent in the fourth quarter, the
fastest pace in 3 1/2 years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
