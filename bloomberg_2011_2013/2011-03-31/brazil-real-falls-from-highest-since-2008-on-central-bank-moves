Brazil ’s real retreated from the
highest level since August 2008 after the central bank
intervened five times today to slow the currency’s advance.  The real fell 0.2 percent to 1.6318 per dollar, from 1.6288
yesterday. The real has gained 42 percent since the end of 2008,
the biggest advance among 25 emerging-market currencies tracked
by Bloomberg. Brazil’s currency strengthened 1.8 percent in the
first quarter of this year.  The central bank said it bought dollars for immediate
delivery three times today, the first time for 1.6262 reais each
the second for 1.6285 each, and a third time for 1.6300. The
bank also auctioned reverse currency swaps, placing 6,600
contracts of 30,000 offered, after rejecting all bids in an
earlier auction.  “There’s a clash between the central bank and the
market,” said  Francisco Carvalho , currency director at Sao
Paulo-based BGC Liquidez, the second-biggest currency brokerage
on the BM&FBovespa SA exchange.  Central bank President Alexandre Tombini told lawmakers
today that it’s hard to prevent the real from appreciating given
the attractiveness of the economy as an investment destination,
lower house representative Claudio Puty said after meeting with
Tombini.  The yield on interest-rate futures contracts due in
January, the most traded today, were unchanged at 12.12 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
