Electricite de France SA,  Europe ’s
largest power producer, pulled out of talks to buy Poland’s
third-largest utility  Enea SA (ENA)  from the country’s government,
said a person familiar with the situation, who asked not to be
named because the matter isn’t public.  The person confirmed an earlier report by Reuters that EDF
had withdrawn from the negotiations.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
