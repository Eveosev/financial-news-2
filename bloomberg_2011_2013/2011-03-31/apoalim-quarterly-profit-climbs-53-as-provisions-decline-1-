Bank Hapoalim Ltd.,  Israel ’s
second-largest lender by market value, reported a 53 percent
gain in fourth-quarter profit after net interest income
increased and provisions for risky loans declined.  Net income rose to 713 million shekels ($204 million) from
467 million shekels in the year-earlier period, the Tel Aviv-
based lender said today in a statement. Net interest income
advanced 6 percent to 2.1 billion shekels.  The  Bank of Israel  raised its benchmark interest rate for a
third consecutive month on March 28 after economic growth
accelerated to a four-year high of 7.7 percent in the last
quarter of 2010. That helped Hapoalim to cut provisions for
doubtful debt to 100 million shekels from 536 million shekels.  “Excellent results for Hapoalim,” Adi Scop, an analyst at
Tel Aviv-based IBI-Israel Brokerage & Investments Ltd., said by
telephone. “The bank is once again back to lead the banking
system by improving its results from quarter to quarter.” Scop
has a “buy” recommendation on the shares.  Hapoalim fell 0.2 percent to 17.86 shekels in  Tel Aviv 
trading yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
