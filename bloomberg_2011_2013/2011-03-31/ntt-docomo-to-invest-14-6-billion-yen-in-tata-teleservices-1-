NTT DoCoMo Inc. (9437) ,  Japan ’s largest
mobile-phone operator, will invest 14.6 billion yen ($176
million) in Tata Teleservices Ltd. as part of a rights offering
by the Indian partner.  The purchase will allow DoCoMo to maintain its 26 percent
stake in the closely held Indian company, the Tokyo-based phone
carrier said in a statement today. Part of the payment has
already been completed and the remainder will be made in May,
the company said.  Tata Teleservices will use the proceeds to help upgrade its
third-generation wireless network in India, the world’s second
largest market for mobile services. Tata was among nine
operators including  Vodafone Group Plc (VOD) ’s Indian unit that spent
677.2 billion rupees ($15 billion) on next-generation wireless
permits in a an auction held by the Indian government last year.  DoCoMo, which completed a 250 billion yen investment in
Tata Teleservices in March 2009, fell 1.8 percent to close at
146,200 yen in  Tokyo , narrowing its gain this year to 3.1
percent.  Tata Teleservices Maharashtra Ltd. (TTLS) , the listed unit
that provides mobile-phone services in Mumbai and the western
states of Maharashtra and Goa, surged 6.4 percent to 17.40
rupees at 11:57 a.m. local time.  Temasek Holdings Pte, Singapore’s state-owned investment
company, bought 9.9 percent of the Tata Group unit in March
2006. Tata  units  generated combined revenue about $70 billion
last year, according to its website.  To contact the reporters on this story:
