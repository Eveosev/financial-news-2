French President  Nicolas Sarkozy 
cut France’s budget deficit faster than forecast in 2010 as
 Europe ’s sovereign debt crisis increased pressure on governments
across the region to limit borrowing.  The shortfall last year amounted to 136.5 billion euros
($194 billion), or 7 percent of gross domestic product, the
Paris-based national statistics office, Insee, said in a
statement today. That compares with the 7.5 percent of GDP the
government expected in February and the 8.5 percent originally
planned. The deficit was 7.5 percent of GDP in 2009.  Sarkozy, who faces an election in April 2012, has sought to
balance investor pressure for  deficit reduction  with the need to
foster growth and counter joblessness that’s stuck near a seven-
year high. Restraint on health-care and pension payouts slowed
spending growth in 2010 even as Sarkozy initiated his “grand
loan” investment plan to spur French competitiveness. He vowed
again today to slash the deficit to the European Union limit of
3 percent of GDP by 2013.  “This shows how serious the government is about reducing
the deficit,”  Dominique Barbet , an economist at BNP Paribas in
Paris, said in a note to investors. “It is now likely that the
2011 deficit will also be lower than the official target” of 6
percent.  The U.K. deficit will be about 9.9 percent of output in the
year ending today, according to the  Office for Budget
Responsibility .  Germany ’s budget shortfall was about 3.3 percent
of GDP in 2010, the Federal Statistics Office said Feb. 24.  France’s gross debt rose to 1.59 trillion euros or 81.7
percent of GDP in 2010 from 1.49 trillion euros or 78.3 percent
in 2009. Net debt rose to 75.9 percent of output from 71.3
percent, Insee said today.  “ France  is not only meeting its deficit commitments, it’s
going beyond them,” Finance Minister  Christine Lagarde  said
today on Radio Classique. “It proves all of our reforms are
beginning to bear fruit. We outperformed in 2010. I hope we’ll
be able to continue to do better.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
