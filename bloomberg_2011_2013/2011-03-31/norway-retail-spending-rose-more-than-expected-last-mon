Norwegian retail spending grew at a
faster pace last month than economists expected, underpinned by
continued borrowing growth, as consumers in the worldâ€™s second-
richest country per capita drive an economic expansion.  Retail sales, excluding motor vehicles and petrol, rose a
seasonally-adjusted 0.7 percent in February from the previous
month, the Oslo-based statistics office said today in a
statement on its website. Sales were expected to rise a monthly
0.5 percent, according to a Bloomberg survey of eight
economists. In the year retail sales rose 2.7 percent.  The krone jumped 0.3 percent against the euro to 7.8522 at
10:26 a.m. and was trading 0.7 percent higher against the dollar
at 5.5361.  The central bank has signaled it will resume interest-rate
increases in the middle of this year as it tries to steer a
recovery in domestic demand. The mainland economy, which
excludes income from oil and shipping, will grow 3.25 percent
this year after expanding 2.2 percent in 2010, the central bank
estimates.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
