Sweden’s economy will grow 4.2
percent this year as employment reaches the highest level in two
decades, underpinning consumer demand in the largest Nordic
economy, the National Institute for Economic Research said.  Gross domestic product will expand 3.2 percent in 2012,
forcing the central bank to raise the benchmark interest rate to
3 percent by the end of next year, the Stockholm-based institute
said in a statement on its website today.  Sweden is delivering the biggest economic rebound in the
European Union as an export-led expansion creates jobs and
underpins consumer spending. The central bank has raised rates
five times since July, bringing the repo to 1.5 percent, and
signaled more increases are needed to steer the recovery and
offset inflationary pressures.  Inflation will exceed the central bank’s 2 percent target
through next year as it averages 3.2 percent in 2011 and 2.2
percent in 2012, the institute said.  The krona was little changed against the euro and trading
at 8.9307 at 9:33 a.m. in  Stockholm . Against the dollar, the
krona gained 0.4 percent to 6.3004.  To contact the reporters responsible for this story
