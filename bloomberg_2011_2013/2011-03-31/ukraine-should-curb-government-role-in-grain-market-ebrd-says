Ukraine’s government should reduce
its role in the country’s grain market to encourage private
investment and spur growth, according to the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development.  “The government interference goes way too far,” country
director Andre Kuusvek said today at Dragon Capital’s 7th Annual
Ukraine Investor Conference in Kiev. “What is happening in the
grain sector is appalling,” he said, calling the distribution
of quotas for cereal exports “anything but transparent.”  The quotas, imposed in October, are an “exceedingly ill-
targeted tool” for trying to curb food-price inflation, the
American Chamber of Commerce in Ukraine said last week. The
government also has drafted legislation that would require grain
traders to make partial advance payments for exports while
exempting so-called state market operators.  “The government should not be talking about creating grain
export monopolies,” Kuusvek said.  Ukraine should revise the quota system because it is “not
efficient,” Martin Raiser, the  World Bank ’s director for
Ukraine, Belarus and Moldova, said at the conference. Allotment
of the quotas “is not transparent,” which is “not a very good
signal if Ukraine wants to attract investments,” he said.  The government yesterday approved an extension of the
quotas, which had been scheduled to expire today, to July 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
