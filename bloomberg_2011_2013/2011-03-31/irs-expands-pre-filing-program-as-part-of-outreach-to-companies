An  Internal Revenue Service  program
that encourages large corporations to collaborate with the
agency as they prepare tax filings is being expanded and
extended permanently, the IRS said.  The program, known as the  compliance assurance process ,
started in 2005 with 17 companies. It has grown to include 140
companies and demonstrates the agency’s effort to work more
cooperatively with businesses, the IRS said today in announcing
the expansion.  “This marks another important step in our evolving
relationship with corporate taxpayers,” IRS Commissioner Doug Shulman said in a press release.  The IRS is expanding the program by developing a “clear
road map” of the requirements a company must meet to
participate. Companies that have a successful record in the
program and don’t face complex tax issues will be allowed to
enter a “maintenance phase” in which the agency would reduce
the intensity of its reviews.  The program is restricted to companies with more than $10
million in assets that aren’t being investigated by the IRS.  Shulman was on  Capitol Hill  this morning to testify at a
House Ways and Means subcommittee on the April 18 filing
deadline. He fielded questions from lawmakers about whether the
IRS is too heavy-handed in its investigations and audits of
businesses.  “We look at burdening quite a bit,” Shulman told the
panel. “We try to do our job in the least burdensome manner
possible.”  To contact the reporter on this story: Steven Sloan in
