The  Bank of Korea  said it will
adjust “appropriately” the degree of its eased policy while
looking at developments in downside and upside risks to the
global economy.  The central bank also said in a monetary policy report
submitted to the National Assembly today that authorities will
be on the alert for a possible deepening of financial and
economic imbalances driven by increases in  household debt  and
asset prices following an extended period of low interest rates.  Authorities will enhance measures to guard against volatile
international capital flows if needed, and will act “swiftly” if
they detect any signs of market instability, the bank said.  The bank provides a report on its monetary policy to
lawmakers at least twice a year, according to the law.  To contact the reporter on this story:
