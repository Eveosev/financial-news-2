Mercator Poslovni Sistem (MELR)  d.d.
called on shareholders to form a group to sell a majority stake
in the largest publicly traded retail chain in the Balkans.  The retailer, based in Ljubljana, has retained  Societe
Generale (GLE)  SA to coordinate the possible sale of a majority stake
of as much as 75 percent, Tanja Durin, Mercator’s spokeswoman,
said in a phone interview today.  “This is the first time that Mercator said it wants its
investors to work together and consider an international tender
to sell a majority holding,” Durin said. A sale may be
concluded by the end of the year, she said.  Mercator is battling its rival Agrokor d.d. for control of
the retail market in the Balkans as economies in the region
improve and consumer confidence climbs. Agrokor, which owns
Konzum d.d., the biggest retail chain in Croatia, submitted a
separate bid to buy a 23 percent stake in Mercator, which is
being sold by  Pivovarna Lasko (PILR)  Group d.d.  Agrokor, as well as Warburg Pincus LLC and Mid Europa
Partners Ltd.. on March 10 placed bids for the 23 percent stake
in Mercator. A decision may be announced today, according to
Pivovarna spokesman Jure Struc.  Pivovarna Lasko is the single largest shareholder in
Mercator, followed by Nova Ljubljanska Banka d.d.,  UniCredit
SpA (UCG) ’s unit in Slovenia, Nova Kreditna Banka Maribor d.d. and
others.  To contact the reporter on this story:
