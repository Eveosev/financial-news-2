U.S. nuclear-power output was
little changed as  Public Service Enterprise Group Inc. (PEG)  increased
production at the Salem 1 and 2 reactors in New Jersey, the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission said.  Power generation nationwide increased by 86 megawatts from
yesterday to 83,762 megawatts, or 82 percent of capacity,
according to a report today from the NRC and data compiled by
Bloomberg. Eighteen of the nation’s 104 reactors were offline.  Public Service increased output at the 1,174-megawatt Salem
1 to full power from 90 percent of capacity yesterday. The
1,130-megawatt Salem 2 was boosted to 90 percent of capacity
from 86 percent yesterday.  The plant is about 18 miles (29 kilometers) south of
Wilmington,  Delaware .  Exelon Corp. (EXC)  determined more repairs are needed on the
reactor vessel head of the 1,164-megawatt  Byron 1 unit  in
 Illinois , the NRC said in a report.  The reactor, which has been shut for refueling and
maintenance since March 14, is 85 miles west of  Chicago . The
1,136-megawatt Byron 2 is operating at 96 percent of capacity.  Exelon is also reviewing an auxiliary feedwater system
configuration on both units that “significantly degrades plant
safety,” according to an NRC report.  A similar condition was being examined at Exelon’s
Braidwood plant, which has two reactors about 54 miles southwest
of Chicago, the agency said. Both units are operating at full
power, together producing about 2,300 megawatts.  A control rod malfunction occurred during a test at  Duke
Energy Corp. (DUK) ’s McGuire 2 reactor in  North Carolina , the NRC
reported.  The unit will remain in cold shutdown until troubleshooting
and repairs are completed, the agency said. The 1,100-megawatt
unit has been closed for refueling and maintenance since Feb.
28.  The 1,100-megawatt McGuire 1 is operating at full power.
The plant is 15 miles north of Charlotte.  Some reactors close for maintenance and refueling during
the spring and fall in the U.S., when demand for heating and
cooling is lower. The outages can increase consumption of
natural gas and coal to generate electricity.  The average U.S. reactor  refueling outage  lasted 41 days in
2009, according to the Nuclear Energy Institute.  To contact the reporter on this story:
