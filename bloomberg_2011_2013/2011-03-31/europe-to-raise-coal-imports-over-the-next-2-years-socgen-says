Paris-based Societe Generale
analyst Emmanuel Fages comments on European coal imports at a
Coaltrans conference in Geneva today.  “For the two years to come, we see a slight increase
because of the end of the recession, driving higher power
consumption and the higher price of gas, making coal as a fuel
of choice for generation.”  He also cited  Germany ’s decision to shut down the oldest
seven of 17 nuclear plants as part of a three-month moratorium
on an extension of their lifespans as experts review safety
standards.  To contact the reporter on this story:
