TNK-BP, the oil venture half owned
by  BP Plc (BP/) , said its Linik refinery in Ukraine remains at risk of
closure while calling for the government to fend off imports of
cheap oil products.  The Moscow-based company is seeking the introduction of
quotas or duties on imported fuels, TNK-BP said today in an e-
mailed statement. Linik, located in the city of Lisichansk, will
continue to operate pending a decision by the Ukrainian energy
authorities.  “TNK-BP has developed plans to close the Lisichansk
refinery, and fully intends to follow through with these plans,
if the current market conditions continue,” the company said in
a statement.  TNK-BP and OAO Lukoil’s refining operations in the Ukraine
are suffering because of cheap imports from Belarus and
 Kazakhstan , the  International Energy Agency  said last month.
TNK-BP said in February it expects to lose $150 million this
year on the Linik facility if conditions remain the same and
threatened to close the plant at the end of this month. Lukoil’s
Odessa refinery is closed.  “If a fair competitive environment prevails, the company
will continue to develop the refinery, will increase refining
volumes and in 2012 will start to produce Euro-5 quality fuel,”
the statement said. Euro-5 gasoline and diesel are among the
cleanest in  Europe , containing no more than 10 parts per million
of sulfur.  To contact the reporter on this story:
