Asian stocks rose, with the
benchmark regional index erasing losses since Japan’s March 11
earthquake, as a jobs report boosted optimism in the  U.S.
economy  and Chinese companies posted earnings that beat analyst
estimates.  HTC Corp. (2498) , the Taiwanese maker of mobile phones that gets
about half of its sales from America, and Yue Yuen Industrial
(Holdings) Ltd., the world’s biggest supplier of athletic shoes,
rose at least 2.5 percent after a report showed U.S. companies
added more workers in March. Industrial & Commercial Bank of
China Ltd., the world’s largest lender by market value, and
rival Bank of Communications Ltd. gained at least 1.3 percent in
 Hong Kong  after 2010 earnings that surpassed analyst estimates.  “There’s been solid earnings from Chinese companies and
U.S. data has also been encouraging,” said Ng Soo Nam, the
Singapore-based chief investment officer at Nikko Asset
Management Co., which oversees about $126 billion. “The worst
of the nuclear crisis in  Japan  could be behind us.”  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index rose 0.7 percent to 135.81 as
of 7:44 p.m. in Tokyo, heading for its highest close since March
10, the day before Japan’s strongest  earthquake  on record struck
the nation. Almost two stocks advanced for each that declined in
the measure, which is set for a 1.2 percent decline this month.  Gains today helped trim the index’s loss this quarter to
1.4 percent. The gauge, which was trading around 135.10 on March
11 before the earthquake and the ensuing tsunami struck, tumbled
to as low as 121.69 on March 15.  Economic Impact  The Asia-Pacific gauge last week had its biggest weekly
gain since November as Japan moved to stabilize nuclear reactors
damaged by the earthquake, and as companies from Cnooc Ltd. to
Bank of China Ltd. reported earnings that surpassed estimates.  Japan’s  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average rose 0.5 percent, paring
earlier gains of as much as 0.6 percent after a report showed
the nation’s manufacturing deteriorated at the fastest pace in
at least nine years in March, underscoring forecasts the economy
will shrink in the aftermath of the earthquake.  “It’ll take more time for the impact of the earthquake on
the economy to be clear,” said Mitsushige Akino, who oversees
about $450 million in Tokyo at Ichiyoshi Investment Management
Co.  Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index increased 0.3 percent.  South
Korea ’s Kospi Index climbed 0.7 percent and  Australia ’s S&P/ASX
200 Index gained 0.3 percent.  New Zealand ’s NZX 50 Index rose
0.2 percent, gaining for a 12th day to complete its longest
winning streak since April 2006.  China ’s Shanghai Composite
Index declined 0.9 percent.  U.S. Employment  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index were little
changed today. The index rose 0.7 percent yesterday, extending
its biggest first-quarter rally in 13 years, as a report from
ADP Employer Services showed U.S. companies hired 201,000
workers in March, marking the third time in four months that the
nation added more than 200,000 jobs.  A Labor Department report tomorrow may show total U.S. non-
farm payrolls rose 190,000 in March and the  unemployment rate 
held at 8.9 percent, economists predict. The jobless rate fell
below 9 percent in February for the first time in 22 months.  HTC, which counts America as its biggest market, climbed 5
percent to NT$1,150 in Taipei. Yue Yuen, the maker of shoes for
Nike Inc. that gets about 29 percent of sales from the U.S.,
gained 2.5 percent to HK$24.75 in Hong Kong. Techtronic
Industries Co., the maker of Hoover vacuum cleaners and Ryobi
power tools, advanced 3.7 percent to HK$10.80.  Year-to-Date Loss  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index lost 2.1 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with gains of 5.6 percent by the S&P
500 and 1 percent by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Stocks in the
Asian benchmark are valued at 13.6 times estimated earnings on
average, compared with 13.7 times for the S&P 500 and 11.2 times
for the Stoxx 600.  A gauge of finance companies posted the biggest advance
among the 10 industry groups in the MSCI Asia Pacific Index, all
which gained.  Industrial & Commercial Bank of China (601398) , the nation’s biggest
lender, rose 1.3 percent to HK$6.46 in Hong Kong. The company
said full-year net income increased 28 percent to 165.2 billion
yuan ($25.2 billion) from a year earlier. That exceeded the
163.8 billion yuan average estimate of 19 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg.  Bank of Communications, China’s fifth-largest lender,
climbed 2.9 percent to HK$8.56 after saying full-year net income
rose 30 percent to 39 billion yuan from a year earlier. That
beat the 38 billion yuan average estimate of 17 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg.  Bank Rakyat  PT Bank Rakyat  Indonesia , the nation’s No. 2 bank by assets,
surged 6.5 percent to 5,750 rupiah in Jakarta after saying its
2010 net income increased 58 percent. United Co. Rusal, the
world’s largest aluminum maker, jumped 4.4 percent to HK$13.44
after it more than tripled profit last year.  China Communications Services Corp., which provides
engineering services to phone companies, slumped 16 percent to
HK$4.73 in Hong Kong, the worst performer on the MSCI Asia
Pacific Index. The company said yesterday it plans to sell as
many as 2.3 billion shares to existing shareholders in a rights
offering.  To contact the reporters on this story:
