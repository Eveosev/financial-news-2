The euro stayed stronger against
the dollar after a report showed euro-region inflation
accelerated, remaining above the  European Central Bank ’s 2
percent limit in March.      The euro strengthened 0.7 percent percent against the
dollar to $1.4219 as of 10:04 a.m. in  London . It appreciated 0.5
percent to 117.71 yen.   Inflation in the 17-nation euro region quickened to 2.6
percent from 2.4 percent in February, the European Union’s
statistics office in Luxembourg said today in an initial
estimate. That’s the fastest since October 2008 and exceeds the
ECB’s limit for a fourth month. Economists forecast inflation to
hold at 2.4 percent, the median of 32 estimates in a Bloomberg
News survey showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
