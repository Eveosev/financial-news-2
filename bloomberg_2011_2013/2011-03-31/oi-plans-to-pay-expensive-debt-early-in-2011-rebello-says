Tele Norte Leste Participacoes SA (TNLP3) ,
the holding company that controls  Brazil ’s largest fixed-line
telephone carrier, plans to make early payments on some of its
debt in the first half of 2011 after refinancing $607 million of
dollar bonds last year at cheaper rates.  “We still have some 5 billion reais ($3.1 billion) in
maturities this year, plus we’re going to prepay some of our
more expensive debt,” Treasurer Tarso Rebello said yesterday in
an interview in Sao Paulo. “We have loads of cash at the
moment. So what we’re focusing on is really a liability
management exercise.”  Rabello declined to specify which bonds the company may pay
down prematurely.  Oi, as the company is known, bought back $607 million of
its 9.5 percent bonds due in 2019 last September after borrowing
$1 billion at 5.5 percent by selling securities due in 2020,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The Rio de Janeiro-
based company sold another 750 million euros of bonds at 5.125
percent in December.  The yield on the 5.5 percent bonds has declined 22 basis
points this year to 5.76 percent on March 30.  “We have some 30 billion reais in debt, so we’ve got
plenty to work on,” Rabello said.  Oi reduced net debt to 18.7 billion reais in the fourth
quarter of 2010, from 21.9 billion reais a year earlier. The
ratio of net debt to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation
and amortization fell to 1.8 percent from 2.2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
