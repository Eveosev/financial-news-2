U.S. stocks fell, trimming the
biggest first-quarter rally for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
since 1998, as a Federal Reserve official said  interest rates 
may need to rise and concern about  Europe ’s debt crisis grew.  Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A)  lost 2.1 percent as  David Sokol ,
once a candidate to succeed  Warren Buffett  as the head of the
investment firm, resigned.  CarMax Inc. (KMX)  slumped 7.2 percent after

12,319.73 today. Stocks extended losses late in the session as
Fed Bank of Minneapolis President Narayana Kocherlakota told the
Wall Street Journal that policy makers may have to lift rates to
fight inflation.  “That kind of brought the market back to reality,”  Michael Nasto , senior trader at U.S. Global Investors Inc., which
manages $3 billion in  San Antonio , Texas, said of Kocherlakota’s
comments. “We had a negative tone set. It’s another example of
people being a little bit timid about going to the market simply
because of what they’re hearing.”  Equities fell earlier after Irish regulators instructed
four banks to raise 24 billion euros ($34 billion) in additional
capital following a stress test on the nation’s lenders.

gains similar to this year’s, according to Birinyi Associates
Inc. The index has risen about 7.1 percent in the final three
quarters of years following January-March gains of 5 percent to
7 percent, Birinyi data dating back to 1928 show.  The benchmark gauge of U.S. stocks is trading for about

$83.63. Sokol bought about 96,000 Lubrizol Corp. shares in
January before recommending the company as a takeover target,

credit-card issuer by purchases, slid 1.6 percent to $45.20.  Intel Corp. (INTC) , the world’s largest chipmaker, fell 1.4
percent to $20.18 after FBR Capital Markets said in a note to
clients the world’s largest chipmaker faces slower-than-expected
growth in the personal-computer market during the second quarter
and its Sandy Bridge products are not stimulating as much demand
as anticipated.  American International Group Inc. (AIG)  fell 2.5 percent to
$35.14 after the Federal Reserve Bank of New York said it has
declined the insurer’s $15.7 billion offer to purchase the
residential-mortgage backed securities owned by the central
bank’s Maiden Lane II LLC rescue fund.  U.S. Steel, Rowan  U.S. Steel Corp. declined 4.2 percent to $53.94 after the

year will be the second largest since 1944 as increasing demand
for food and fuel cuts stockpiles worldwide.  XL Group Plc (XL)  added 4 percent to $24.60 after Egan-Jones
Ratings Co. said the insurer stands good chance of a takeover by
Berkshire Hathaway or other stronger peers.  The rebound in the S&P 500 isn’t over, according to Bay
Crest Partners LLC. When the S&P 500 slipped to 1,249.05 on
March 16, the weekly survey from the  American Association  of
Individual Investors showed the next day that the ratio of bulls
to bears fell to 0.71, the lowest since Aug. 26, Bloomberg data
show. Christian Bendixen, director of technical research at Bay
Crest, said the increase in pessimism may reverse and help the
S&P 500 climb to 1,425, or 7.3 percent above yesterday’s close.  “We have some good reasons to want to own stocks,” said
Perry Piazza, director of investment strategy at Contango
Capital Advisors in  San Francisco , who helps oversee about $3.3
billion of assets. “We know the energy and materials sectors
are doing really well, we know the dollar is weak, we know that
individual investors are interested again in coming back to the
stock market. I don’t think it’s time to take your chips off the
table yet.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
