The cost of protecting Japanese
corporate bonds from non-payment rose, according to traders of
credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx  Japan  added three basis points 143 basis
points as of 9:28 a.m. in  Tokyo , according to Citigroup Inc. The
benchmark rose to a nine-month high of 147 basis points on March
16, according to data provider CMA in  New York .  The Markit iTraxx Australia index added 0.5 basis point to
106 basis points as of 11:20 a.m. in Sydney, Credit Agricole SA
prices show. The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 50 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan was little changed at 106.5 as of 8:20
a.m. in Hong Kong, according to Credit Agricole.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
credit quality. A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
