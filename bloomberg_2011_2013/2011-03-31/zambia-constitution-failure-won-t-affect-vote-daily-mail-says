Te failure of Zambia’s parliament
to approve a new constitution this week won’t disrupt elections
to be held by October, President Rupiah Banda said in a
statement published in the state-run  Daily Mail  of Zambia.  “Zambia will hold presidential and parliamentary elections
this year as per the current constitution and I am committed to
ensuring that the polls are held in a transparent and fair
manner,” Banda said. “There is no crisis.”  Opposition parties have called for the immediate
dissolution of parliament and early elections after the new
constitution failed to win the two-thirds majority required in
parliament. The constitution would have introduced a second
round of voting if no presidential candidate won an outright
majority in the first round.  To contact the reporter on this story:
