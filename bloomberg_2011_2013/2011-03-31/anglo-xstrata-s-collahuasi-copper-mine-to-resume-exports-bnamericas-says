Anglo American Plc (AAL)  and  Xstrata
Plc (XTA) ’s Collahuasi copper mine in northern Chile plans to ramp up
concentrate shipments by the end of April after the collapse of
a shiploader stalled deliveries,  Business News Americas  said.  The mine will lift so-called force majeure on sales as its
Punta Patache port resumes operations, Bernardita Fernandez, a
Collahuasi spokeswoman, told the Santiago-based  news agency .
Force majeure is a legal clause allowing a company to miss the
terms of a contract because of circumstances beyond its control.  Collahuasi has been shipping output from ports at Arica,
Antofagasta and Iquique, and boosted sales to Xstrata’s Chilean
copper unit, according to the report. The mine’s copper exports
declined 81 percent to 8,100 metric tons in January, from 42,200
tons a year earlier, BNAmericas said, citing government figures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
