Japan ’s biggest business lobby
faulted the government’s response to the March 11 earthquake and
tsunami in a sign criticism of Prime Minister  Naoto Kan  may
increase as rescue operations subside.  “The government’s first moves were slow,” Masahiro
Sakane, vice-chairman of Nippon Keidanren, a Tokyo-based group
that represents more than 1,200 companies, said today at a quake
reconstruction panel meeting. “Keidanren will do its best to
make appeals to the government to avoid a top-down
reconstruction effort and to act swiftly.”  Japan’s self-defense forces had aircraft in the air  within
minutes  of the earthquake to assess damage and coordinate a
response. Still, the record 9.0 earthquake and subsequent
tsunami has left 27,690 people  dead or missing  and some of the
country’s largest companies have been forced to curtail or stop
production.  “The quake left a lot of damage,” Takehiro Sato, chief
Japan economist at Morgan Stanley MUFG Securities Co. in Tokyo,
said by telephone today. “The state is going to be criticized
no matter how they may have acted.”  Delayed Production  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , the world’s largest automaker, may
delay the production of at least 500,000 vehicles in Japan
because of a shortage of parts and electricity, said analyst
Koji Endo at Advanced Research Japan. Nissan Motor Co. estimates
it lost about 55,000 units of vehicle production this month.  So far, Kan’s popularity has risen, with a Kyodo News poll
released on March 27 showing 67.5 percent of the public supports
higher levies to fund reconstruction, and his approval rating
increasing 8.4 percentage points to 28.3 percent.  Kan told lawmakers two days ago that a debate will be
needed on all options to pay for rebuilding. The initial
spending package is likely to be around 3 trillion yen ($36
billion), about the same as after the 1995 Kobe quake, according
to Takuji Aida, senior Japan economist at UBS AG in  Tokyo .  The disaster was compounded by damage to reactors at Tokyo
Electric Power Co.’s Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear plant, which has
leaked radioactive material into the air and sea. Sakane’s
comments follows criticism from Fukushima’s governor and a local
mayor over poor communication and lack of essential supplies
from the central government.  Take Control  Masamitsu Sakurai, head of the Japan Association of
Corporate Executives, the country’s second-largest business
group, criticized the government response on March 29.
Authorities should have acted earlier to avert the crisis at the
Fukushima plant and they need to take greater control of the
situation, he said.  Keidanren today called on local financial institutions to
increase their lending, and said the  Bank of Japan (8301)  should
continue with its low-interest rate policy to aid rebuilding
efforts. The quake shut factories of companies including  Sony
Corp. (6758)  and Tokyo Steel Manufacturing Co.  A report today showed manufacturing in March deteriorated
at the fastest pace in at least nine years, reinforcing
expectations that the quake will cut Japan’s economic growth.
The Nikkei 225 Stock Average has fallen 6.8 percent since the
quake, as of 1:51 p.m. local time.  For Related News and Information:  To contact the reporter on this story:
