Acegas-APS SpA, the municipal
utility for the northern Italian cities of Trieste and Padua,
will invest 55.8 million euros ($80 million) in the next three
years to build a gas distribution grid in western  Bulgaria .  The company, through its Bulgarian unit Rila Gas AD, plans
to build a 372-kilometer (231-mile) natural gas pipeline network
to service 150,000 potential customers in seven cities, Cesare Pillon, chief executive officer of Acegas-APS, told reporters in
Sofia today.  “Our investments in Bulgaria are part of our company’s
overall development strategy,” Pillon said. Acegas-APS is also
building a gas grid in  Serbia , he said.  Acegas-APS has already invested 25 million euros to build a
134-kilometer grid in the cities of Dupnitsa, Sandanski, Vratsa
and Pernik, which will be operational by the end of the year.
The company’s gas network in Blagoevgrad has supplied fuel since
2010, Pillon said.  Rila Gas won a permit in 2006 to distribute natural gas to
western Bulgaria over the next 35 years. The total investment
project involves 130 million euros to build 850 kilometers of
gas pipeline network, said Sergio Pantano, executive director of
Rila Gas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
