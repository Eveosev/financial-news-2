The  Memphis  Grizzlies advanced to
round two of the National Basketball Association playoffs in six
games after beating the top-seeded  San Antonio  Spurs 99-91.  San Antonio, which had the NBA Western Conference’s best
record during the regular season, became the second No. 1 seed
after the 2006-07  Dallas Mavericks  to lose a best-of-seven
playoff series to an eighth-ranked team.  “Not a lot of people knew about us coming in, but we
certainly have made some noise and turned some heads and got
some attention that probably wouldn’t have been given to us if
we’d lost this series,” Memphis coach Lionel Hollins told
reporters. “We’d just be another eight seed losing to the No. 1
seed.”  The Grizzlies begin their Western Conference semifinal
tomorrow by traveling to the Oklahoma City Thunder, who beat the
Denver Nuggets four games to one.  At FedEx Forum in Memphis, Zach Randolph had 31 points and
11 rebounds last night for the Grizzlies.  Tony Parker  led the
Spurs with 23 points.  In the Eastern Conference, the Boston Celtics travel to
Miami tomorrow to open their semifinal series against the Heat.  To contact the reporter on this story:
