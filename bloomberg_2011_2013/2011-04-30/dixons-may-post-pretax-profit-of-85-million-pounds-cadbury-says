Dixons Retail Plc (DXNS)  will probably
report annual pretax earnings of about 85 million pounds ($142
million) in June, Nick Cadbury, the U.K. electronics retailer’s
finance director, said in an interview with the Financial Times.  The company won’t breach debt covenants unless pretax
profit falls to about 15 million pounds to 20 million pounds,
Cadbury told the London-based newspaper. Dixons reduced the
number of U.K. stores to 600 from 720 and Cadbury wants to shut
another 150 outlets to cut rent expenses, the FT said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
