Arsenal manager  Arsene Wenger  fears
the club’s failure to win this season may fuel Cesc Fabregas’s
desire to leave for Barcelona, the Daily Mail said.  Wenger admits the 23-year-old midfielder is feeling the
strain of a sixth straight season without a trophy, the Mail
said.  Barcelona, which Fabregas left for Arsenal as a 16-year-
old, plans another bid for him after the season, the Mail said.
Fabregas rejected a move back to the Spanish champ prior to this
campaign.  Arsenal is third in the Premier League with four games to
play, nine points behind  Manchester United , which it hosts
tomorrow.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
