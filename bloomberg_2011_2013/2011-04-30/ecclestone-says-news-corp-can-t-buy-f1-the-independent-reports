News Corp. (NWSA)  would be unable to buy
Formula One because of a promise to the European Commission to
keep the racing competition on free-to-air television, Formula
One Chief Executive Officer  Bernie Ecclestone  said, according to
The Independent.  “I’m sure the European Commission wouldn’t let it go
through because our agreement with them was to keep it on free-
to-air television,” Ecclestone told the newspaper, adding that
he thought Formula One was worth "$6 billion to $7 billion.’’  News Corp., owner of cable-television channels including
Speed, may make a bid with partners for motor racing’s most
popular series, a person familiar with the matter said
yesterday. Sky News, which is controlled by News Corp., reported
the company had talked to Slim.  Editors:  To contact the reporter on this story:
