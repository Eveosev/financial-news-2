Everton manager David Moyes has
distanced himself from media reports that he’s wanted by  Aston
Villa , the Sun said.  Villa is looking at Moyes and Fulham’s Mark Hughes as
possible candidates should  Gerard Houllier  step down over health
concerns, the Sun said. Houllier was released from the hospital
yesterday after being treated for chest pains.  “It’s nothing to do with me is it?” the Sun quoted Moyes
as saying. “I’m at a great club in a great job. I don’t know
what to say.”  Moyes is in his ninth season at Everton and has the Toffees
in seventh place in the Premier League.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
