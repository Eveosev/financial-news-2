Argentinaâ€™s pensions agency named a
second representative to the board of energy company
 Transportadora de Gas del Sur SA (TGS)  yesterday, newspaper La Nacion
reported.  Maria Belen Franchini, a former advisor in the Senate to
President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, will join lawyer
Miguel Eduardo Mirmi in representing the pensions agency on the
board of the company, the Buenos Aires-based daily reported.   The move by the pensions agency, known as Anses, comes after
Fernandez decreed April 13 that the government would exercise
its full  voting rights  on companies in which it owns shares. The
government previously had a 5 percent limit on voting rights.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
