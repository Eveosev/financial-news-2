Danisco A/S’ Chief Executive
Officer Tom Knutzen said he welcomed the raised takeover bid by
DuPont Co., Boersen reported, citing the executive.  It is “extremely positive” that DuPont has raised the
offer, Knutzen told the Danish newspaper. It is a “strong
signal of commitment” from the Americans, Boersen cited the CEO
as saying.
DuPont, the third-biggest U.S. chemical maker, yesterday
increased its offer for Danisco by 5.3 percent to 33.4 billion
kroner ($6.63 billion) after failing to win enough investor
support for its initial takeover bid.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
