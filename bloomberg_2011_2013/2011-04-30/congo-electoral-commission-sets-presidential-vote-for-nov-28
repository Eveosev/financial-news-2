The Democratic Republic of Congo
will hold presidential and parliamentary elections on Nov. 28,
said Pastor Daniel Ngoy Mulunda, head of the Central African
country’s electoral commission.  Campaigning for Congo’s second presidential vote after
nearly a decade of war ended in 2003 will begin on Oct. 28,
Mulunda told reporters today in Kinshasa, the capital.
Provisional results will be announced on Dec. 6, he said.  President Joseph Kabila will seek re-election after winning
a runoff vote in 2006 against former rebel leader Jean-Pierre Bemba, who is now on trial at the  International Criminal Court 
in  The Hague  for  war crimes  allegedly committed in neighboring
Central African Republic in 2002 and 2003.  With Bemba sidelined, Kabila’s main opposition will
probably be Etienne Tshisekedi, head of the Union for Democracy
and Social Progress party. Vital Kamerhe, the architect of
Kabila’s first campaign and former president of the National
Assembly, may also run.  The elections will take place in one round after the
government changed the constitution in January, allowing a
candidate to win with a simple majority.  Armed conflicts and extreme poverty continue to plague the
mineral-rich country, which is struggling to overcome four
decades of dictatorship and war.  To contact the reporter on this story:
