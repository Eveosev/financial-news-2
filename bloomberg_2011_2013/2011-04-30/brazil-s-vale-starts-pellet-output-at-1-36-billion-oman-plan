Brazil’s  Vale SA (VALE3) , the world’s
second-largest miner by market value, starts production today at
its $1.36 billion pelletizing plant in Oman, the company  said  in
a press release published on its website.  The plant’s two units each have a capacity of 4.5 million
metric tons of direct reduction pellets per year, and will meet
demand for iron ore products in the Middle East, North Africa
and  India , the company said.  Vale fell 43 centavos, or 0.9 percent, to 46.07 reais in
Sao Paulo trading last week.  To contact the reporters on this story:
