Saudi Arabian shares dropped for
the first time in six days, reversing earlier gains, amid
speculation that comments by officials from the world’s largest
oil producer may lead to lower crude prices.  Saudi Basic Industries Corp. (SABIC) , the world’s biggest
petrochemicals maker, and  Al Rajhi Bank (RJHI) , the kingdom’s largest
publicly traded lender by market value, led the losses.  The 146-member  Tadawul All Share Index (SASEIDX)  declined 0.2
percent, the gauge’s largest loss in almost two weeks, to
6,710.56 at the 3:30 p.m. close in Riyadh. Three shares dropped
for every two stocks that gained. The measure had advanced as
much as 0.5 percent in intraday trading.  “The discomfort expressed at elevated crude prices by both
the Saudi oil minister and Saudi Aramco chief last week is
weighing down sentiment,” said Asim Bukhtiar, an equity analyst
at Riyad Capital.  On April 26, Khalid al-Falih, chief executive officer of
Saudi Arabian Oil Co., said his country, holder of one-fifth of
the world’s proven oil reserves, isn’t “comfortable with  oil
prices  where they are today,” and that it is “concerned about
the impact it could have on the global economic growth.” On
April 19, Saudi Oil Minister Ali al-Naimi said the current rise
in the price of oil is “unjustified.”  Crude for June delivery rose 1 percent to $113.93 a barrel,
the highest settlement since Sept. 22, 2008, on the New York
Mercantile Exchange yesterday. Prices climbed 1.5 percent this
week and 34 percent in the past year.  Sabic declined 0.2 percent, the biggest drop since April
24, to 111.50 riyals and Al Rajhi tumbled 0.7 percent to 76.75
riyals, the largest loss since April 19.  Banque Saudi Fransi (BSFR) ,
the kingdom’s fifth-largest lender by market value, weakened 0.9
percent to 46.4 riyals.  Saudi Arabia ’s stock exchange is the only Gulf Arab bourse
open on Saturdays.  To contact the reporter on this story:
