(Corrects dollar conversion in second paragraph.)  Sheffield FC, the world’s oldest
soccer club, will auction off one of the sport’s earliest known
rulebooks, handwritten in 1858, the Financial Times reported
today.  The set of rules, which introduced laws used today
including the corner kick and use of a crossbar, is part of club
archives to be sold by  Sotheby’s (BID)  in London in July and should
fetch up to 1.2 million pounds ($2 million), the Financial Times
said.  Sotheby’s has shown the archives to potential bidders in
Paris,  New York  and Doha, according to the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
