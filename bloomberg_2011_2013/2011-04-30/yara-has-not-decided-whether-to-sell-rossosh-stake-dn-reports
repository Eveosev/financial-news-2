Yara International ASA (YAR)  has not
decided whether it will sell its stake in Rossosh, Dagens
Naeringsliv reported, citing Yara spokesman Asle Skredderberget.  In case of a sale “it’s likely to be a handsome profit,”
Skredderberget told the Oslo-based newspaper.  EuroChem,  Russia ’s largest maker of nitrogen fertilizers,
is leading a group of investors who are willing to buy Yaibera
Holdings Ltd., which owns 79.6 percent of OAO Minudobreniya, or
Rossosh. The offer was circulated on April 28 to Yara, a 37.7
percent shareholder in Yaibera, according to an April 28
statement by EuroChem spokesman Vladimir Torin.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
