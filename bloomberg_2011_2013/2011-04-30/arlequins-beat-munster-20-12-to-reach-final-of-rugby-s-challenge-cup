Harlequins defeated Munster 20-12
to move into the final of rugby’s Amlin Challenge Cup for the
third time.  George Robson and Danny Care scored tries at Thomond Park
in Limerick, Ireland, for Harlequins, which won  Europe ’s second-
tier club competition in 2001 and 2004. Rory Clegg also kicked
two penalties after coming on for injured Nick Evans.  London-based Harlequins will face Stade  France  Paris in the
May 20 final in Cardiff. Stade France beat Clermont Auvergne
29-25 yesterday in an all-French semifinal.  Felix Jones and Doug Howlett touched down for Munster,
which lost just its second European home match in 16 years.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
