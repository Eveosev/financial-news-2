Libyan leader  Muammar Qaddafi  said
he’ll stay in the North African nation, where his people want
“martyrdom or victory” in the face of a rebel insurgency that
began in mid-February.  “I don’t have a post to leave,” Qaddafi said in a speech
on Libyan state television, broadcast by Al Arabiya television
early today. “If I had a post I would have ended like Mubarak
or Ben Ali,” he said in a reference to Egyptian President  Hosni
Mubarak  and Tunisian President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, who were
forced to step down in the face of popular uprisings earlier
this year.  Qaddafi said no one can force him to leave the country and
said outsiders won’t control the nation’s oil.  Libya  has
Africa’s biggest proven oil reserves.  The Libyan leader blamed terrorists for leading the fight
against his regime, adding that he would agree to a cease-fire
if the extremists can be convinced to introduce a truce.  Qaddafi called for the western town of Ajdabiya to be a
neutral zone and said the  African Union  should oversee a
handover of weapons there. Qaddafi also praised countries that
have stood by Libya.  To contact the reporter on this story:
