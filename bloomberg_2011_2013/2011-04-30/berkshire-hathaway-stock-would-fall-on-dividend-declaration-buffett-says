Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A)  shares
would decline if the company declared a dividend, Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer  Warren Buffett  said.  The 80-year-old billionaire said declaring a dividend would
be an admission that he can’t fully invest the company’s
profits. Buffett spoke today at Berkshire’s annual meeting in
Omaha,  Nebraska .  Buffett has shunned payouts and share buybacks, preferring
to use the firm’s profits to make acquisitions and buy
securities instead. With a cash hoard of about $38 billion, it
may be harder to effectively invest the proceeds, Buffett said.  “Every dollar that’s been reinvested in Berkshire has
created more than a dollar of market value,” said Buffett, who
is Berkshire’s largest shareholder. “There will come a time,
and who knows how soon because the numbers are getting big,”
that the company won’t be able to use profits in a way that
serves shareholders, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
