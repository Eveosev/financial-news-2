Spain â€™s competition regulator is
planning to publish a report on gasoline refiners including
 Repsol YPF SA (REP)  and Cia Espanola de Petroleos SA after pump prices
rose faster than crude,  El Economista  reported, citing senior
officials at the regulator without naming them.  Prices at Spanish gas stations touched a record $1.31 euros
per liter this year, exceeding the highs reached during the 2008
crude rally prompting the investigation, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
