China released a human rights
lawyer, Teng Biao, after he was detained by the police, the
 Associated Press  reported, citing his wife.  Teng returned home yesterday after he was held by police
two months ago in a security crackdown aimed at preventing
Middle East-inspired unrest, AP reported, citing Tengâ€™s wife
Wang Ling.  16 other lawyers and activities are missing after the
recent crackdown, AP reported, citing Phelim Kine, a researcher
with the New York-based Human Rights Watch.  --Winnie Zhu. Editors: Paul Tighe  To contact the reporter on this story:
