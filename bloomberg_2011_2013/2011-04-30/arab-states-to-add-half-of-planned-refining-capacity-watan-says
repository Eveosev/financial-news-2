Arab crude oil-producing countries
will only add half of the 4 million barrels a day in refining
capacity projects they announced over the past five years, al-
Watan daily reported, citing Abbas Ali Naqi, the secretary-
general of the  Organization for Arab Petroleum Exporting
Countries .  Arab countries will only add 2 million barrels a day in
refining capacity between 2011 and 2015, with 1.6 million
barrels coming from three new refineries Saudi Aramco is
building in  Saudi Arabia . Another 400,000 barrels will come from
al-Ruwais refinery in the  United Arab Emirates , he told the
Abha, Saudi Arabia-based  newspaper .  Kuwait is still considering going ahead with the al-Zour
refinery that it planned to build to process 615,000 barrels a
day of crude, al-Watan cited Naqi as saying.  The members of Oapec are Algeria, Egypt, Bahrain, Iraq,
Kuwait, Qatar, Libya, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Tunisia and the
United Arab Emirates. Seven of those are also members of the 13-
nation Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
