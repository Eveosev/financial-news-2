Bahrain wants to host the Formula
One race in the “very near future” after a wave of political
unrest forced the government to cancel the event, the Bahrain
News Agency said.  Bahrain “looks forward to welcoming the teams and drivers
and everyone involved in Formula One back to Bahrain,” the news
service said, citing a statement from the Bahrain International
Circuit.  Bahraini Crown Prince Salman bin Hamad Al Khalifa said on
Feb. 21 that the government cancelled the March 13 season
opening. The event was halted a week after pro-democracy
protests started in the Persian Gulf country.  The F1 opening event was the Australian Grand Prix on March
27 in  Melbourne . Bahrain has hosted Formula One since 2004 at a
purpose-built $150 million racetrack in the desert south of
Manama.  Bahrain’s commitment “has been clear from the very
outset” and restoring the Gulf Air Bahrain Grand Prix “has
been of paramount importance,”  Bernie Ecclestone , Formula One
chief executive officer, was also cited as saying the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
