A gasoline-making unit at  BP Plc (BP/) â€™s
Texas City, Texas, oil refinery is returning to service after a
power outage, the company said in a filing to state regulators.  The Ultraformer No. 3 is resuming operations from today
until May 4 and may release emissions, BP said in the statement
with the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality.  The 475,000 barrel-a-day refinery shut on April 25 during a
 power failure  affecting nearby plants owned by Valero Energy
Corp. and Marathon Oil Corp.  To contact the reporter on this story:
