Prime Minister  Naoto Kan ’s
Democratic Party of  Japan  agreed with two opposition groups
yesterday to review child subsidies and expressway tolls, to win
support for disaster-relief plans and secure funding for this
year’s budget.  “Each party will seriously consider passage of bills to
issue deficit-covering bonds,” according to a  statement  on the
DPJ website.  The agreement will probably help Kan move forward on
efforts to rebuild from last month’s record earthquake and
tsunami, and increase his chances of winning approval to fund
spending with 44 trillion yen ($541 billion) of  government
bonds . Parliament last month approved Kan’s 92.4 trillion yen
budget.  Kan has said Japan will need multiple spending programs to
recover from disaster damages estimated at as much as 25
trillion yen.  DPJ policy chief Koichiro Gemba also agreed with
counterparts in the  Liberal Democratic Party  and New Komeito
party that reconstruction bonds will be issued for additional
relief packages and will be managed separately from conventional
government bonds.  The LDP and New Komeito want further reductions in the
monthly subsidy paid to families with children, and restoration
of highway tolls that were cut under the DPJ government.  Kan last month abandoned efforts to raise the child subsidy
to 20,000 yen from 13,000 yen, as he needs to generate disaster
relief funds.  To contact the reporters on this story:
