Frank McCourt , the  Los Angeles 
Dodgers baseball team owner, will appeal a judge’s decision
invalidating the postnuptial agreement that he claimed excluded
his ex-wife from ownership of team.  Lawyers for McCourt filed a notice of appeal yesterday in
California state court in Los Angeles.  Superior Court Judge Scott M. Gordon last year decided that
the 2004 agreement that McCourt and his ex-wife made when they
bought the Dodgers and moved to California couldn’t be enforced.
The judge said there was no “meeting of the minds” between the
two when they made the agreement and that it isn’t valid under
California law.  The judge hasn’t set a trial date to decide on the division
of the couple’s assets, including the Major League Baseball
team.  Dennis Wasser , a lawyer representing Jamie McCourt, didn’t
immediately return a call to his office seeking comment after
regular business hours yesterday.  The case is McCourt v. McCourt, BD514309, Los Angeles
County Superior Court.  To contact the reporter on this story:
