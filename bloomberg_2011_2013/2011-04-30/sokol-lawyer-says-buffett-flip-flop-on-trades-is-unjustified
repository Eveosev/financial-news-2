David Sokol  did nothing wrong by
buying Lubrizol Corp. shares as he pushed for a takeover of the
company by  Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A) , and Chairman Warren Buffett’s criticism of the stock purchases was unjustified,
Sokol’s lawyer said.  “It is alarming that Mr. Buffett would be advised to so
completely flip-flop” and criticize Sokol today after praising
him March 30 when Berkshire announced his resignation, said the
lawyer, Barry Levine, in an e-mailed statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
