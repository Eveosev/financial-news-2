Borussia Dortmund won its first
German Bundesliga championship in nine years after beating
Nurnberg 2-0.  The victory, combined with  Bayer Leverkusen ’s 2-0 loss at
Cologne, gives Dortmund an unbeateable eight-point lead with two
matches remaining in the season.  First-half goals from Lucas Barrios and Robert Lewandowski
gave Dortmund the home victory at Signal Indua Park. It’s the
club’s fourth Bundesliga title overall and first since 2002.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
