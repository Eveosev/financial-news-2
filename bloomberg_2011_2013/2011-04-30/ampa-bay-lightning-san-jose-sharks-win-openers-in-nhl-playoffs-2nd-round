The  Tampa Bay  Lightning and the  San
Jose Sharks  won their opening games in the second round of the
National Hockey League playoffs.  The Lightning defeated the  Washington  Capitals 4-2 and the
Sharks beat the Detroit  Red Wings  2-1 in overtime in their best-
of-seven series.  At the Verizon Center in Washington, Sean Bergenheim scored
2 minutes, 12 seconds into the game to give the Lightning a
short-lived lead before Alexander Semin got a goal two minutes
later for the Capitals.  Eric Fehr’s goal early in the second period gave the
Capitals their only lead before Steve Downie and Steven Stamkos
gave Tampa Bay a 3-2 advantage at the end of the second period.
Dominic Moore added an empty net goal for the Lightning with 40
seconds left in the game.  At HP Pavilion in  San Jose , California, Benn Ferriero
scored 7:03 into overtime to give the Sharks a one-game lead
over the Red Wings. Niklas Lidstrom scored the Red Wings’ goal
midway through the first period, and Joe Pavelski tied the score
for the Sharks on a power play midway through the third period.  In today’s games, the Boston Bruins travel to Philadelphia
to meet the Flyers in the first game of their series, while the
Nashville Predators seek to tie their series against the host
Vancouver Canucks at one game each.  To contact the reporter on this story:
