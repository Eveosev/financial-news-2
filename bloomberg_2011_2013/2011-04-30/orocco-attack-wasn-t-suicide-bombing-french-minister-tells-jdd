The deadly April 28 attack on a
restaurant in Marrakesh,  Morocco  was not the work of a suicide
bomber, French Interior Minister Claude Gueant was quoted as
saying in an interview with Le  Journal du Dimanche .  “Somebody had left a bag on the floor and there was a
remote detonation,” Gueant said in the interview published
today.  The bomb, which contained nails and left traces of ammonium
nitrate and explosives TATP and PETN, “reminds me of the Paris
bombings of 1995,” the minister was quoted as saying.  -- Editor: Douglas Lytle  To contact the reporter on this story:
