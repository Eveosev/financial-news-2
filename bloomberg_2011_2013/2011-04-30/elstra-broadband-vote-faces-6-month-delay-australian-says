Telstra Corp Ltd. (TLS)  may delay a
shareholder vote on its $A13.8 billion ($15) agreement with the
government’s national broadband network until November --six
months later than hoped -- The Australian reported.  The vote will probably coincide with Telstra’s annual
general meeting, the  Sydney-based newspaper  said, citing company
investors. The telecoms group and state-owned NBN Co. are still
negotiating terms relating to Telstra’s structural split,
according to the paper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
