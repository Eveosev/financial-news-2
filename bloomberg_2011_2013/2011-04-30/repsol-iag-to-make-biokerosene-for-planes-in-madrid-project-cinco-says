Repsol YPF SA (REP) , International
Consolidated Airlines Group SA and Spanish airport operator Aena
will make biofuel for airplanes in Madrid to reduce carbon
emissions in a pilot project,  Cinco Dias  reported.  Algaenergy, backed by Repsol and  Iberdrola SA (IBE) , will set up
a testing center at Madrid’s Barajas Airport on land ceded by
Aena to produce biokerosene from algae fed with the carbon
dioxide produced by IAG’s operations at the terminal, the
newspaper said.  IAG will test the fuel in its planes in a project that also
seeks to curb exposure to oil prices, Cinco Dias added.  The European Union aims to see airplanes meeting 40 percent
of their propulsion needs from biofuels by 2050, the newspaper
added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
