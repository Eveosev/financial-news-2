Bahrain accused Iranian computer
hackers of breaching the Housing Ministry’s website in an
attempt to access data, which lists the names of people
receiving housing services, the  Bahrain News Agency  said.  The hackers failed to “carry out this criminal act, which
testifies to their latent rancor,” the state-owned news service
said, citing a statement from the ministry. The government
denied that the data had been leaked, it said.  Bahrain’s Sunni-led monarchy declared on March 15 a three-
month state of emergency after Saudi-led Gulf troops arrived to
help quell mainly Shiite demands for democracy and civil rights.
The government has accused Iran of interfering in its internal
affairs since the protests started in the Persian Gulf country.  On April 25, Bahrain asked Iranian diplomat Heget Elah
Rahmani to leave the country in 72 hours over alleged ties with
a spy network operating in  Kuwait , according to the  news agency .  To contact the reporter on this story:
