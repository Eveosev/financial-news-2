Munich prosecutors plan to file
embezzlement charges against all members of Bayerische
Landesbankâ€™s former board,  Sueddeutsche Zeitung  said, citing
people close to legal circles.  The state-owned lender lost 3.7 billion euros ($5.5
billion) in its 2007 acquisition of Austrian Hypo Alpe Adria
bank, the newspaper said. Matthias Priwitzer, a spokesman for
BayernLB, declined to comment in a telephone interview today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
