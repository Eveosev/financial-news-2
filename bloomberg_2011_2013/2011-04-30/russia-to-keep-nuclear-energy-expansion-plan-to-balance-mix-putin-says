Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin  said
Russia is keeping its plans to increase the share of nuclear
power to have a “balanced” energy industry.  “We need to produce as many units, I mean big units, as in
the entire Soviet period,” Putin said at a meeting with trade
unions in Penza, central Russia, yesterday. “Our energy should
be balanced; it should be based on several sources: nuclear,
hydrocarbon, hydro power, wind, solar panels.”  Russia is seeking to increase the share of nuclear power in
total electricity generation to about 25 percent within 10 to 15
years, up from 16 percent now, Putin said.  A devastating earthquake and tsunami last month in Japan
forced some countries, including  Germany , to revise their
nuclear power programs. Putin ordered an inspection of all
Russian reactors after the Japanese disaster, he said yesterday.  Russia’s reactors are “the safest in the world,” Putin
said, citing data of the  International Atomic Energy Agency . “I
can say that with pride and full responsibility.”  Russia drafted proposals to help develop new safety
standards for global nuclear energy after the Japanese nuclear
crisis, President  Dmitry Medvedev  said on Apr. 26, the 25th
anniversary of the nuclear accident in Chernobyl, Ukraine.  To contact the reporters on this story:
