The U.S. Financial Accounting
Standards Board changed its rule on the way it determines
whether repurchase transactions can be considered a sale after
“financial statement users” voiced concerns.  The transferor of assets in a repurchase transaction no
longer has to show an “ability to repurchase or redeem” the
assets to determine effective control, according to the
statement by the Norwalk, Connecticut-based accounting board.
Under accounting rules, the transaction may or may not be
determined a sale depending on whether the entity holds
effective control over the assets.  The change was in response “to concerns from financial
statement users who felt the criteria for determining effective
control for such transactions should be improved,” Chairman
Leslie F. Seidman said in the statement. “The new guidance
improves transparency by eliminating consideration of the
transferor’s ability to fulfill its contractual rights and
obligations from the criteria in determining effective
control.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
