Billionaire  Warren Buffett  said it
would be “most asinine” if U.S. lawmakers keep the debt
ceiling, rather than lift it to allow more borrowing.  “We’re a growing country, and we’re going to have a
growing debt capacity,” Buffett said today at the annual
meeting of his  Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A)  “In my view, there’s no
chance that they don’t increase the debt ceiling.”  Congress is facing a vote as early as next month on raising
the $14.3 trillion ceiling. Republicans are demanding spending
cuts as the price of their vote to allow the U.S. to go further
into debt. Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner has said
inaction on the ceiling would be “irresponsible” and raise
questions about the country’s commitment to meeting obligations
to bondholders.  Buffett, 80, is Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire’s chairman,
chief executive officer and largest shareholder and was a
supporter and adviser to President  Barack Obama , a Democrat,
during his campaign for the White House.  To contact the reporter on this story:
