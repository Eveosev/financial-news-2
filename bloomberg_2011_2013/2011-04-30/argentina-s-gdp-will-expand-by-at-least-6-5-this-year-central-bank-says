Argentina ’s economy may expand by
6.5 percent or more this year, and unemployment may hover at the
lowest level in two decades, the central bank said.  “Internal demand has returned to lead economic growth,”
the central bank report published last night, which cited first
quarter growth in industrial production and the  construction
industry .  The central bank joins analysts at companies including
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. in raising its forecast for growth in
South America’s second-biggest economy. Goldman said last month
that Argentina’s gross domestic product may expand 6.8 percent
this year, up from an earlier estimate of 5.6 percent. The
government had forecast 4.3 percent growth in its 2011 budget.  Argentine unemployment fell to 7.3 percent in the fourth
quarter, the lowest in at least nine years, the government
reported in February. Sales of central bank notes absorbed 80
percent of the growth in the country’s money supply resulting
from the purchase of dollars in the first quarter, the bank
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
