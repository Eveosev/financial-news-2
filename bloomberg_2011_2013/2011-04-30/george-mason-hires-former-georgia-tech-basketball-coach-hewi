George Mason University  hired Paul
Hewitt as its basketball coach, the school said on its website.  Hewitt, 47, replaces Jim Larranaga, who was hired as coach
at the University of Miami on April 22. Heâ€™ll be introduced at a
press conference in two days, the school said.  Hewitt was fired by Georgia Tech last month after a 13-18
season. He posted a 190-162 record in 11 seasons at Tech,
leading the Yellow Jackets to the Final Four in 2004, but was
just 72-104 in the Atlantic Coast Conference.  George Mason went 27-7 last season, losing to Ohio State in
the third round of the NCAA tournament.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
