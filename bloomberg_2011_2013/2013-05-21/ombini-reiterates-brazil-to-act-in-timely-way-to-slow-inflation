Brazil ’s central bank President
Alexandre Tombini reiterated today that policy makers will do
what’s needed in a timely way to ensure inflation slows in the
second half of this year.  “The central bank is vigilant and will do what’s necessary
in a timely fashion to make inflation decline in the second half
and to ensure this trend will last in the coming years,” he
told members of Congress in Brasilia, repeating language used
last week in  Rio de Janeiro .  The central bank last month raised its benchmark rate for
the first time since July 2011 amid signs that price increases
are undermining Brazil’s economic recovery by curbing demand and
investors’ confidence. Policy makers are scheduled to decide
again on rates in a May 28-29 meeting.  Inflation in the world’s biggest emerging market after
 China  is near the 6.5 percent upper limit of the central bank’s
target range even after growth slowed for two straight years.
President  Dilma Rousseff ’s administration is trying to rein in
consumer prices without jeopardizing faster economic growth.  Swap rates on the January 2014 contract reversed earlier
drops and rose as much as 2 basis points to 8.15 percent. The
contract was unchanged at 8.13 percent at 4:16 p.m. local time.  To contact the reporters on this story:
