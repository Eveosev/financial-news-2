Marks & Spencer Group Plc (MKS) , the U.K.’s
largest clothing retailer, said annual profit fell 5.8 percent
as consumers spent less on its fashion goods, even as food sales
increased.  So-called underlying profit before tax fell to 665.2
million pounds ($1.01 billion) in the year ended March 30, the
London-based retailer said today in a  statement . That compares
with the average estimate of 663.3 million pounds from 16
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  The retailer unveiled its new autumn-winter fashion range
last week, which Chief Executive Officer  Marc Bolland  said was a
“step in the right direction” with its emphasis on improved
quality and styles, and has opened a new e-commerce distribution
center to speed up delivery times. The company aims to boost its
general merchandise margin over the next three years, it said
today.  “We are working hard to get the general merchandise
performance back on track,” Bolland said in the statement.  M&S shares reached a five-year high last week after
analysts reacted positively to the revamped fashion range and a
new general-merchandise management team. Underlying profit
excludes gains and losses on property disposals, impairment
charges and one-time pension costs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
