MetLife Inc. said continued low
interest rates could cost the company about $2.5 billion after
three-to-five years in the U.S. variable annuity business.  The projection for the so-called deferred acquisition cost
is based on Treasury rates holding at levels from September of
last year, according to a regulatory filing today from New York-based MetLife, the largest U.S. life insurer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
