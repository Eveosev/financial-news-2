South African corn decreased the most
in more than two weeks as prices in the U.S., the biggest
producer of the grain, dropped after farmers made progress with
their planting amid drier weather.  Yellow corn for delivery in July, the most active contract,
fell 2.4 percent 2,126 rand ($223) a metric ton, the most since
May 6, by the close on the South African Futures Exchange. White
corn for delivery in the same month slumped 2.3 percent to 2,141
rand a ton.  Corn for July delivery dropped as much as 2.5 percent in
 Chicago  and headed for the biggest retreat since May 6. About 71
percent of the crop had been  sown  as of May 19, from 28 percent
a week earlier, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said
yesterday. Much of  Illinois ,  Indiana ,  Ohio  and eastern Missouri
had below-normal rain in the past week, National Weather Service
data show.  “Chicago prices went down heavily as planting figures came
out indicating that they will be able to plant more,” Brink van Wyk, a trader at BVG (Pty) Ltd., said by phone from  Pretoria .  South Africa is the continent’s largest producer of corn.
White corn is mainly used as a staple food, while the yellow
variety is used as animal feed.  Wheat for July delivery gained for the first time in four
days, adding 0.5 percent to 3,504 rand a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
