Saks Inc. (SKS)  surged today after posting
revenue that exceeded analysts’ estimates and later on a report
that the luxury retail chain hired Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to
help it explore alternatives including a possible sale.  Saks  jumped  as much as 21 percent to $16.58 at 4:18 p.m. in
New York, after the New York Post reported the hiring of
Goldman, citing an unidentified person with knowledge of the
situation. The shares had closed at $13.67, an 11 percent
increase and the biggest one-day gain since Aug. 31, 2010.  Possible bidders for Saks include private-equity firms such
as KKR & Co. and Leonard Green & Partners LP, the Post said.  Julia Bentley, a Saks spokeswoman, didn’t immediately
return a phone call seeking comment.  Luxury shoppers’ concerns about higher taxes and the fiscal
budget appeared to have abated, Chief Executive Officer Stephen Sadove said on a conference call today. Sales were strong in
women’s apparel, shoes and handbags, the retailer said in a
statement today. Still, the luxury market is not as robust as
the stock market’s advances would suggest, he said.  Revenue advanced 5.2 percent to $793.2 million, Saks said
in a statement today. Analysts projected $778.1 million, the
average of 11 estimates. Sales at stores open at least a year
climbed 5.9 percent, the company said. Saks generated sales by
increasing the discount on its friends and family promotional
event to 25 percent from 20 percent, Sadove said on the call.  Saks forecast that sales at stores open at least a year
would advance 4 percent to 6 percent for the rest of the year.  Net income in the quarter ended May 4 fell 38 percent to
$20 million, or 13 cents a share, from $32.1 million, or 28
cents, a year earlier, Saks said. Saks spent more integrating
its store and online inventories into a so-called omni-channel.  Excluding some items, profit totaled 19 cents. Analysts
projected 18 cents, the average of 13 estimates compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
