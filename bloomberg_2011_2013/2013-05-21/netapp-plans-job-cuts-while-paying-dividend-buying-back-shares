NetApp Inc. (NTAP) , the data-storage company
under pressure from an activist investor to boost shareholder
value, said it’s cutting jobs and planning to return cash
through stock buybacks and dividends.  The company increased its stock-repurchase program by $1.6
billion, bringing the total to $3 billion over three years.
NetApp initiated a quarterly dividend of 15 cents a share, the
Sunnyvale, California-based company said yesterday in a
statement. It’s also eliminating 900 jobs.  Elliott Management Corp. took a significant stake in NetApp
and is pressing the company to change its board and study ways
to boost shareholder value, people familiar with the situation
said last week. While NetApp is positioned to benefit as
businesses store and manage more data on the Web, the company’s
technology hasn’t kept up with that of larger rivals.  “We commend the positive steps taken by NetApp today to
improve both the capital and cost structure at the company,”
Jesse Cohn, portfolio manager at New York-based Elliott
Management, said yesterday in an e-mailed statement. “As a
significant shareholder, Elliott believes NetApp is a highly
valuable and strategic company and we look forward to the
company’s continued commitment to creating  shareholder value .”  Elliott owns about 16 million NetApp shares, according to
Cohn.  NetApp’s forecasts for results in the current quarter, also
released yesterday, underscored the company’s challenges. Sales
will be $1.48 billion to $1.58 billion in the fiscal first
quarter, NetApp said. Analysts were predicting on average $1.60
billion, according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg. Profit
excluding certain items will be 45 cents to 50 cents a share,
shy of the 53-cent average estimate of analysts.  The shares advanced 1.8 percent to $37.28 at the close in
 New York , leaving them  up  11 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
