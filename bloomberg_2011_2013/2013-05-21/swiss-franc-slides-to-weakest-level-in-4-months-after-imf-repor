The Swiss franc fell to a four-month
low against the euro after the International Monetary Fund said
introducing negative interest rates on banks’ excess deposits
could help cool the country’s real-estate market.  Switzerland’s currency depreciated as much as 0.6 percent
against the euro to 1.2529 per euro, the weakest level since
Jan. 18, and was 0.5 percent lower at 1.25175 as of 3:39 p.m.
London time. It slid 0.6 percent to 97.35 centimes per dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
