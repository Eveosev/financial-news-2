exports of its Zafiro crude unchanged in July at three cargoes
of 1 million barrels each, according to a loading program
obtained by Bloomberg News.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
