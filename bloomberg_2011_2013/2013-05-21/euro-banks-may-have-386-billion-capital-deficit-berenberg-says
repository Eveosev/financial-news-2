A review of asset quality by euro
zone’s banking regulators of the region’s banks may show a
capital shortfall of 300 billion euros ($386 billion) to 400
billion euros led by  France  and  Germany , according to analysts
at Berenberg Bank.  The European Banking Authority and the  European Central
Bank  are under “huge pressure” to curb concern that asset
quality is inadequate, Berenberg analysts in  London  including
 Nick Anderson  wrote to clients yesterday. The largest deficits
may be in France and Germany followed by the Netherlands,
Berenberg said.  “The EBA, the universal butt of criticism after the 2011
 stress test , will be desperate not to be made a fool of again,
especially with the ECB breathing down its neck,” the analysts
said in the note. “The stakes could not be higher.”  The EBA last week postponed stress tests until 2014,
allowing time for an ECB-led review into the assets held by some
lenders in the debt-laden bloc. The EBA said the ECB asset check
will “help dispel concerns over the deterioration of asset
quality due to macroeconomic conditions in  Europe .”  The EBA carried out the last formal EU stress tests in
2011, which were criticized for not catching shortfalls at the
lenders. Eight banks failed the exams with a combined capital
shortage of 2.5 billion euros.  Dexia SA (DEXB) , the French-Belgian
lender, received a clean bill of health and then failed after a
bank run three months later.  To contact the reporter on this story:
