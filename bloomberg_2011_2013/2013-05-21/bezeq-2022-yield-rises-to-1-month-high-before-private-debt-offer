Bezeq Israeli Telecommunication Corp. (BEZQ) 
2022 bonds fell, lifting the yield to the highest in more than a
month, as the country’s largest phone service provider today
plans to sell debt in a private placement.  The yield on Bezeq’s 958 million shekels ($261 million) of
3.7 percent notes maturing December 2022 rose eight basis
points, or 0.08 percentage point, to 2.353 percent, the highest
since April 11, at 1:47 p.m. in Tel Aviv. The yield dropped to a
record low on May 19. The shares gained for the first time this
week, adding 0.8 percent to 4.54 shekels. Bezeq this month  paid
out dividends  totaling 1.36 billion shekels.  Bezeq seeks to raise as much as 600 million shekels from a
sale of its Series 6 and 7 notes, which are rated ilAA, the
third-highest investment grade at  Standard & Poor’s . The fixed-line and wireless services provider, which last sold bonds to
the public in 2011, had total debt of 9.4 billion shekels at the
end of March. It expects free cash flow of 2.7 billion shekels
in 2013, according to a company statement on May 13.  “Under the current low interest-rate conditions it makes
sense for Bezeq to raise money to refinance debt and to be able
to continue to pay out  high dividends ,” Ori Licht, head of
research at IBI- Israel  Brokerage & Investments Ltd. in Tel Aviv,
said by phone. “The company may continue to try and raise money
in the near future in this attractive environment.”  The  Bank of Israel  has gradually cut its borrowing rate to
1.5 percent, a three-year low, from 3.25 percent in 2011 to
boost economic growth.  Bezeq said May 13  profit  in the first quarter fell 15
percent to 497 million shekels amid an increase in competition.  To contact the reporter on this story:
