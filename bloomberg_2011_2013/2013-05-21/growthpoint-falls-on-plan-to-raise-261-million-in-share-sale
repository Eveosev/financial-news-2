Growthpoint Properties Ltd. (GRT) ,  South
Africa ’s biggest real-estate company by market value, plans to
raise 2.5 billion rand ($261 million) by selling shares to fund
acquisitions and development. The stock fell the most in more
than two years.  “Growthpoint currently has a significant pipeline of
identified acquisition opportunities, of which a number are well
advanced, and in excess of 1.2 billion rand of development
opportunities within it’s existing portfolio,” the company said
in a statement today.  The shares fell  4.3 percent , the biggest decline since
March 2011, to 28.95 rand. More than 15 million shares traded,
or four times the three-month daily average. The stock had
gained 23 percent this year through yesterday’s close.  Growthpoint, based in Johannesburg, manages a portfolio of
commercial and office properties and joins a growing list of
developers tapping the equity market to fund projects.  Redefine
Properties Ltd (RDF) , the second-biggest property company by value in
South Africa, raised 800 million rand in April, 23 percent more
than it targeted.  “It’s a good time for them to raise capital because there
is a strong demand in the market for property equity papers,”
Leon Allison, property equity analyst at Macquarie First South
Securities, said in a phone interview.  Deutsche Bank AG and Investec are the bookrunners on the
issue. Growthpoint’s comments on its acquisition pipeline don’t
include its bid for  Fountainhead Property Trust (FPT) , the company
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
