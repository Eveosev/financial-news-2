China ’s soybean imports, the world’s
largest, may jump 17 percent in the next season as the country
rebuilds stockpiles, Oil World said.  China may import 68 million metric tons of soybeans in the
2013-14 marketing year that begins Aug. 1, up from 58.2 million
in the previous season, the Hamburg-based researcher said today
in an e-mailed report. Soybean purchases will “start increasing
sizably” from this month onward, it said. China’s soybean
inventories on July 31 may drop to 8.2 million tons, down 30
percent from a year earlier, before rebounding to 9.5 million
tons at the end of the 2013-14 season, according to the report.  “It must be one of the top priorities to replenish soybean
stocks from the current very low level,” Oil World said.
“Soybean imports will have to be raised to a high level not
only during the remainder of this season but also next season.”  China’s soybean  harvest  in the 2013-14 season may total
11.9 million tons, the lowest in at least five years and down
from 12.6 million tons the previous season, Oil World said.  Soybean prices rallied to a record $17.89 a bushel in
September on the Chicago Board of Trade as U.S. crops were hurt
by drought. Logistical problems in Brazil, set to overtake the
U.S. as the world’s biggest exporter, have supported prices in
recent months as shipments to importers including China were
delayed.  Port Hours  Soybean exports from South America are accelerating as new
regulations in Brazil extended working hours at major ports, Oil
World said. The country’s shipments may top 8.3 million tons in
May, a record monthly total, it said. Exports from four major
South American shippers may climb to a record 42.2 million tons
from April through August, including 29.2 million tons from
 Brazil .  Global soybean output in the 2012-13 season may be 265.67
million tons, up 11 percent from a year earlier, Oil World said.
Brazil’s crop may be 81.51 million tons, while  Argentina , the
third-biggest exporter, produces 48.5 million tons. World
soybean crushing in 2012-13 may be smaller than previously
expected at 225.5 million tons, while stockpiles at the end of
the season may exceed expectations at 61 million tons.  Shrinking U.S. supplies before the next harvest mean
exports may total 3.4 million tons from April through August, 64
percent less than a year earlier, Oil World said. The country’s
soybean crushing will drop 15 percent from a year earlier to
16.2 million tons. The U.S. probably will import 870,000 tons of
soybeans in the 2012-13 season, with supplies coming from  Canada 
and  South America , according to the report.  “There is concern about a lack of soybeans in July and
August” in the U.S., Oil World said. “Soybean exports and
crushings are currently plummeting.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
