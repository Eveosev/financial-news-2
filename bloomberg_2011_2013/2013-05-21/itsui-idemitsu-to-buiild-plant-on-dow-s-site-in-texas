Japanese companies  Idemitsu Kosan Co. (5019) 
and  Mitsui & Co. (8031)  applied to build a Texas chemical plant at  Dow
Chemical Co. (DOW) â€™s largest production site as more foreign companies
try to benefit from cheap U.S. natural gas.  The factory would use ethylene to make alpha olefins, which
are added to polyethylene plastics and other resins, on land
owned by Midland, Michigan-based Dow at its site in Freeport on
the U.S. Gulf Coast, the companies said in an application for
air emissions filed May 17 with federal and state regulators.  The companies in March disclosed plans to produce alpha
olefins in the U.S. without saying where the plant would be
built. Construction would begin in a year with production
starting in the second half of 2016, according to the
application.  To contact the reporter on this story:
