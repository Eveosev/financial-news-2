National Football League owners
approved $200 million in financing for part of the  Atlanta
Falcons ’ share of a new $1 billion downtown stadium.  Home Depot Inc. (HD)  co-founder Arthur Blank, the team’s owner,
called the loan from the league’s G-4 financing program “an
important milestone” in advancing the stadium project in a news
release sent by the team.  “The NFL has supported new stadium construction through
various means for decades,” Blank said. “Our club owners
understand that investments such as G-4 financing are important
to the long-term strength of the league.”  The stadium plan includes a $200 million public
contribution raised through the sale of bonds. Blank said design
and construction will take about four years. The team plans to
open the 2017 season in the new building.  To contact the reporter on this story:
