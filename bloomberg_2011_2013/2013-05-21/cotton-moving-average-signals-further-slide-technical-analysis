Cotton futures already headed for
their biggest monthly drop since September will fall further to
the lowest price since late January, according to  technical
analysis  by Michael T. Sweeney at broker Marex Spectron.  After a five-month rally that sent cotton to an 11-month
high of 93.93 cents a pound on March 15, prices on ICE Futures
U.S. fell below a 50-day moving average of 85.47 cents on April
8. The commodity slid 1.1 percent last month and was down 4.1
percent in May as of yesterday, when it closed at 83.86 cents,
the first settlement this year below the 100-day moving average.  “A close below the 100-day moving average could signal a
breakdown” for prices, with “the next downside target at 81.25
cents,” Sweeney, who is based in New York, said by e-mail
yesterday. “Speculators are long in a major way,” after the
rally in March, which means prices probably will drop as low as
78.75 cents, the cheapest since Jan. 22, he said.  Cotton rallied as much as 25 percent this year on prospects
for a drop in global production, including from the U.S., the
world’s largest exporter. Prices are down 11 percent from the
peak partly because of lower imports projected for  China , the
top user. As of May 14, money managers held a net-long position,
or bets on higher prices, in 62,386 futures and options
contracts, compared with a net-short position of 19,327
contracts in mid-November, government data show.  While U.S. farmers as of May 19 planted 39 percent of
intended acres, below the five-year average of 52 percent, the
total was up from 23 percent a week earlier, government data
show. “At 23 percent, it seemed the plantings were not going to
get there,” Sweeney said in a telephone interview. “Now, it
feels that they are going to get it done.”  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to predict changes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
