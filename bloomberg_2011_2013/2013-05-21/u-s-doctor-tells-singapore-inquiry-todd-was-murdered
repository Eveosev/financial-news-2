Shane Todd, a U.S. research engineer
found hanged in his Singapore apartment, was murdered and may
have been shot by a taser gun, a doctor engaged by Todd’s family
told a coroner’s inquest.  “This is my speculation,” Edward Adelstein, a deputy
medical examiner of  Boone  and Callaway counties in  Missouri ,
told the inquiry by video link today. He said his opinion was
based on photographs of Todd’s body.  Todd, 31 when he died, may have been killed because of his
sensitive work at the Institute of Microelectronics and possible
technology transfers to  China , his father Rick has said.
Singapore opened the inquiry after Todd’s family disputed a
finding by police and four pathologists that the engineer
committed suicide by hanging.  Marks on Todd’s knuckles were bruises from a fight,
Adelstein said. He disputes findings by other pathologists that
the marks were caused by the gravitational movement of blood
after death.  “People who know how to kill you will kill you in a way
that makes it difficult to detect,” Adelstein said in response
to a question by a lawyer for  Singapore  who asked what evidence
he had for his theories. “Maybe I’m more conspiratorial than
you are.”  The Coroner’s Inquiry is Shane Truman Todd. CI002014 of
2012. Singapore Subordinate Courts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
