Copper futures fell from a one-week
high as imports dropped to the lowest in 22 months in China, the
world’s biggest user of industrial metals, while speculation
emerged that the  Federal Reserve  may scale back U.S. stimulus.  April shipments of refined metal into China tumbled 33
percent to 183,023 metric tons, the lowest since June 2011, from
a year earlier, government data showed today. Fed Chairman  Ben
S. Bernanke  testifies on the economic outlook look tomorrow
before the Joint Economic Committee of Congress. The bank buys
$85 billion of Treasury and mortgage debt a month.  “The Chinese data wasn’t overly encouraging, and none of
the metals seem capable of anything more than consolidation
now,”  Bill O’Neill , a partner at Logic Advisors in  Upper Saddle
River , New Jersey, said in a telephone interview. “There’s a
pall over industrial commodities.”  Copper futures for July delivery slid 0.5 percent to settle
at $3.3435 a pound at 1:14 p.m. on the Comex in  New York .
Earlier, the price reached $3.3815, the highest since May 10.  The metal rose as much as 0.6 percent after a deadly mine
accident fueled supply concerns. Operations will remain
suspended at Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc.’s Grasberg
complex in  Indonesia  until an investigation of a tunnel collapse
is concluded, the nation’s government said today. The death toll
has climbed to 28.  BHP Billiton Ltd.’s Escondida mine in Chile is the world’s
biggest, followed by Grasberg.  Copper for delivery in three months declined 0.4 percent to
$7,370 a ton ($3.34 a pound) on the London Metal Exchange.
Nickel, tin, zinc and lead dropped, while aluminum rose less
than 0.1 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
