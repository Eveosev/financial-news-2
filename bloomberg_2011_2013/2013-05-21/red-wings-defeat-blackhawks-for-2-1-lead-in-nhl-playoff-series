The  Detroit   Red Wings  scored a pair
of goals 31 seconds apart to beat the Chicago Blackhawks 3-1 in
Game 3 of their National Hockey League playoff series.  The Red Wings won their second straight game to take a two-games-to-one lead over the Blackhawks, the top seed in the
Western Conference. Gustav Nyquist scored the game’s first goal
7 minutes, 49 seconds into the second period last night and Drew Miller followed with his first goal of the postseason to put the
seventh-seeded Red Wings ahead 2-0 in Detroit.  The Blackhawks pulled within 2-1 on  Patrick Kane ’s goal
4:35 into the third period, and had a potential tying goal waved
off 67 seconds later because Chicago center Andrew Shaw was
ruled to be in the crease.  Pavel Datsyuk then scored the Red Wings’ third goal at the
6:46 mark, helping send the Blackhawks to consecutive losses in
regulation for the third time this season.  “Datsyuk’s goal was the turning point,” Red Wings forward
Daniel Cleary said in a televised interview. “That was a
backbreaker for them.”  The Red Wings will also host Game 4 in the best-of-seven
Western Conference semifinal on May 23.  San Jose  hosts the Stanley Cup-champion Los Angeles Kings
today in the other West semifinal, with the Sharks trailing 2-1
in the series. The  New York  Rangers are home to the Boston
Bruins tonight after losing the first two games of their Eastern
Conference series on the road.  To contact the reporter on this story:
