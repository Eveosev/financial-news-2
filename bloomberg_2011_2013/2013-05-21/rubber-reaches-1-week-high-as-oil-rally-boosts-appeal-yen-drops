Rubber climbed for a third day to the
highest level in a week as crude oil gains boosted the appeal of
the commodity as an alternative to synthetic products.  The contract for delivery in October gained as much as 1.7
percent to 294.4 yen a kilogram ($2,868 a metric ton), the
highest level since May 13. The most-active contract traded at
290.9 yen on the  Tokyo  Commodity Exchange at 10:32 a.m., paring
this year’s loss to 3.8 percent.  Oil in New York traded near the highest level in almost two
months before government data that will probably show U.S.
stockpiles dropped for a second week, the longest run of
declines this year.  Japan ’s currency weakened to 102.77 per
dollar, nearing a four-year low of 103.31 reached May 17 and
making yen-denominated futures more attractive to investors.  “Rubber chased a rally in oil amid optimism about the
global economic recovery,” Takaki Shigemoto, an analyst at
research company JSC Corp. in Tokyo, said by phone today.  Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Charles Evans
said the U.S. economy has improved “quite a lot” as the
central bank maintains record stimulus and expressed confidence
policy makers have tools needed to monitor markets for excesses.  Thai rubber free-on-board rose 1.1 percent to 89.85 baht
($3.01) a kilogram yesterday, according to the Rubber Research
Institute of  Thailand .  Rubber for delivery in September on the  Shanghai  Futures
Exchange added 0.6 percent to 20,630  yuan  ($3,365) a ton.
Natural-rubber inventories dropped for a second week by 930 tons
to 120,160 tons, the bourse said on May 17 based on a survey of
nine warehouses in Shanghai, Shandong, Yunnan, Hainan and
Tianjin.  To contact the reporter on this story:
