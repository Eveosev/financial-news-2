Novartis AG (NOVN) ’s Head of Development Tim Wright said the collaboration with  MorphoSys AG (MOR)  on the BYM338
antibody for diseases that lead to muscle atrophy is one of two
projects in mid-stage trials that he’s most excited about.  Wright named the treatment, along with Novartis’s LDK378
cancer therapy, during a conference call when asked about
compounds in mid-stage testing that may gain a higher profile.
BYM338 blocks a substance named myostatin that is linked to
muscle growth, the executive of Europe’s biggest drugmaker said
on the call arranged by Tim Anderson, an analyst at Sanford C.
Bernstein & Co.  “This is an enormous opportunity,” Simon Moroney, chief
executive officer of German biotechnology company MorphoSys,
said in an interview last week.  BYM338 is being  tested  for ailments such as  cachexia , the
weight and muscle loss that is often found in patients with
diseases such as cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease.  “Imagine the equivalent of eight or 10 weeks of exercise
in one injection,” Wright said on the call.  The drug is also in testing for a rare inherited disease
called  sporadic inclusion body myositis , and Basel, Switzerland-based Novartis plans to expand trials for complaints such as
age-related muscle wasting, Wright said. The treatment may be
filed for regulatory approval in 2016, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
