South Africa ’s rand is set to extend
its decline to a four-year low as falling commodity prices and
slowing global growth cut exports, Societe Generale SA said.  SocGen raised its target for the rand to 9.70 per dollar
from a previous estimate of 9.50, strategists including London-based Gaelle Blanchard, said in an e-mailed note today.
Investors should take a long position on the dollar versus the
rand, or a bet that the dollar will strengthen against the rand,
on May 2, when the  exchange rate  was 9.0340 rand per dollar, the
analysts said.  “The dollar could accelerate even higher against the rand
than we initially anticipated,” the SocGen strategists said,
citing weak data from European countries that share the currency
and soft commodity prices.  The rand’s slide, the longest losing streak in a year, was
sparked by concern labor disruptions and a decline in commodity
prices will lower mining profits and slow economic growth. The
currency weakened as much as 1.9 percent to 9.6264 per dollar,
the worst level since April 2009. It was trading at 9.5961 by
12:38 p.m. in Johannesburg, the world’s worst performing
currency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
