JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) ’s risk committee
could undergo changes in its membership, said Lee R. Raymond,
the bank’s lead director.  “In terms of the composition of the risk committee, you
should stay tuned,” Raymond said today at the firm’s annual
meeting in Tampa, Florida. He was responding to a question from
Mike Mayo, an analyst at CLSA Ltd., on why the board didn’t
overhaul the committee following last year’s risk-management
failures in the chief investment office.  Shareholders are scheduled to vote on three members of the
risk committee, including Ellen Futter, 63, David Cote, 60, and
 James Crown , 59. Futter, president of the American Museum of
Natural History in New York, wasn’t able to attend the
shareholder meeting, Chief Executive Officer  Jamie Dimon  said.  A majority of preliminary ballots supported the three risk-committee members, according to the New York Times. Among them,
Futter received the least support, the newspaper said.  Futter didn’t immediately respond to phone and e-mail
messages seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
