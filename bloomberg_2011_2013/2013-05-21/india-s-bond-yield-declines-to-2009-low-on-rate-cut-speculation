Indian bonds rose, pushing the 10-year yield to the lowest level since 2009, on speculation easing
inflation will make room for the central bank to add to this
year’s three interest-rate reductions.  The wholesale-price  index  climbed 4.89 percent from a year
earlier in April, the smallest increase in 41 months, official
data showed last week.  Reserve Bank  of India Governor Duvvuri Subbarao said the data will be factored into decisions at the
next meeting. The RBI, which last lowered its  repurchase  rate by
25 basis points to 7.25 percent on May 3, is scheduled to review
policy next on June 17.  “Recent macroeconomic data have reinforced our expectation
of monetary easing by the RBI,” analysts at Barclays Plc
including Singapore-based Rohit Arora wrote in a research note
today. “We remain bullish on  government bonds  as key catalysts
for the recent rally still stay intact.”  The yield on the 8.15 percent notes due June 2022 fell one
basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 7.33 percent as of
9:32 a.m. in Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading
system. That’s the lowest level for a benchmark 10-year bond
since November 2009, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Barclays predicts the 10-year yield will decline to as low
as 6.80 percent in the next six months.  The one-year interest-rate swap, a derivative contract used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, fell two basis
points to 7.06 percent, the lowest level since January 2011,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
