  Bank of Nova Scotia (BNS)  Chief Executive
Officer  Richard Waugh  said he was too optimistic about the swift
completion of a deal to buy a stake in a Chinese lender.  Scotiabank has been awaiting regulatory approval from China
on a deal announced in 2011 to buy a 20 percent stake in Bank of
Guangzhou Co. for C$719 million ($700 million).  “We were a little too optimistic on that first
announcement,” Waugh, 65, said today at the Bloomberg Link
conference in Toronto. “I’m not going to make the same mistake
twice and be optimistic again. We are still seriously trying to
move this along. We’ll have to wait and see what develops.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
