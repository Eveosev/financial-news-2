Crude oil options volatility fell
along with the underlying futures as the dollar advanced against
the currencies of U.S. trading partners.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
June, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 20.4 percent at 3:25 p.m. on the  New York 
Mercantile Exchange, down from 20.72 percent yesterday.  West Texas Intermediate for June delivery fell 55 cents to
settle at $96.16 a barrel on the Nymex, the first decline in
five days. The volume of all futures traded was 7.2 percent
below the 100-day average for the time of day. WTI for July fell
75 cents, or 0.8 percent, to $96.18.  Futures dropped as the Dollar Index increased, reducing the
appeal of raw materials prices in dollars. The Dollar Index
tracks the currency against six others.  The most active options in electronic trading today were
July $85 puts on volume of 2,496 lots. They rose 1 cent to 19
cents a barrel at 3:28 p.m. August $120 calls were the second-most active as they gained 1 cent to 7 cents a barrel on volume
of 1,517.  Puts accounted for 60 percent of electronic trading volume
today. Bearish bets made up 54 percent of yesterdayâ€™s volume of
107,236 contracts.  July $90 puts were the most active options traded in the
previous session after falling 14 cents to 52 cents a barrel on
volume of 12,187 lots. July $100 calls increased 10 cents to 89
cents a barrel as 4,333 lots changed hands.  Open interest was highest for July $90 puts on volume of
42,237 contracts. Next were December $105 calls with 38,324 lots
and July $110 calls with 34,496.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on open-outcry volume, where the bulk of options activity occurs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
