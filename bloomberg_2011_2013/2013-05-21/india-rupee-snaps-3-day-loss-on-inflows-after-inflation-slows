India ’s rupee snapped a three-day
decline after foreign investors pumped money into the nation’s
assets as inflation eased to a 41-month low.  Global funds bought a net $883 million of Indian shares
last week and foreign  holdings  of local debt rose to a record
$38 billion on May 17, exchange data show. An auction of 55.33
billion rupees ($1 billion) of sovereign debt-purchase permits
was oversubscribed yesterday, according to two people with
knowledge of the matter who asked not to be identified as they
aren’t authorized to speak to the media. The central bank
lowered the benchmark repurchase rate to 7.25 percent on May 3,
the third cut this year.  The rupee advanced 0.2 percent to 55.03 per dollar as of
10:02 a.m. in Mumbai, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
It touched 55.1350 yesterday, the weakest level since March 4.
One-month implied volatility, a gauge of expected moves in the
 exchange rate  used to price options, fell five basis points, or
0.05 percentage point, to 8.43 percent.  “Further  Reserve Bank  of India easing and lower inflation
will likely boost portfolio flows and the rupee,” analysts at
Barclays Plc, including Mumbai-based Siddhartha Sanyal, wrote in
a research report today. “But over the medium term, a still-wide current-account gap and likely dollar strength in the
second half of 2013 could temper rupee strength.”  Bernanke Testimony  The shortfall in India’s current account, the broadest
measure of trade, widened to a record of around 5 percent of
gross domestic product in the year through March 2013, the
government estimates. Wholesale prices climbed 4.89 percent in
April, the slowest pace since 2009, official data showed May 14.  Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  testifies tomorrow
on the U.S. economic outlook before a Joint Economic Committee
of Congress, less than a month before the policy-setting  Federal
Open Market Committee  meets. The FOMC said May 1 that it will
keep buying $85 billion in bonds per month to bolster growth,
and that it would increase or decrease the pace of purchases in
response to the labor market and inflation.  Three-month onshore rupee forwards traded at 55.95 per
dollar, compared with 56.04 yesterday, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Offshore non-deliverable contracts were
at 55.82 versus 55.88. Forwards are agreements to buy or sell
assets at a set price and date. Non-deliverable contracts are
settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
