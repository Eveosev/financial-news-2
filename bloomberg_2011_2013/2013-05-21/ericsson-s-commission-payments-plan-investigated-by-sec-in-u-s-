The U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission has started an investigation into  Ericsson AB (ERICB) ’s
payment system used to win contracts in the 1990s, including
orders in  Romania .  Ericsson got a request for information in March after media
reports on its system for paying trade agents in Romania in the
late 1990s and early 2000s, Fredrik Hallstan, a spokesman for
Ericsson, said today. The request related to three former
employees who are suspected to have embezzled almost 150 million
kronor ($23 million) while they had access to cash meant for
paying contacts with access to local telecommunications
carriers, he said. Ericsson no longer uses such third-party
agents.  Ericsson is cooperating with the U.S. and is providing the
information requested, Hallstan said in a phone interview.  “This isn’t about corruption, it’s about these three
guys,” who are alleged to have embezzled money from Stockholm-based Ericsson, Hallstan said, without identifying the people.  Ericsson  shares  slipped 1.3 percent to 78.35 kronor at
11:29 a.m. in  Stockholm , declining for the fourth day. That
pared the advance to 20 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
