The cost of insuring Asia-Pacific
corporate and sovereign bonds from default was little changed
today, according to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index held at 99 basis points
as of 10:25 a.m. in Sydney, according to Westpac Banking Corp.
The index fell yesterday for the fourth consecutive trading day
after reaching a near two-week high on May 14, according to data
provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  was trading at 101 basis points as of
8:24 a.m. in Hong Kong, also little changed from yesterday,
Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. prices show. The
gauge has fallen 21.3 basis points this quarter, according to
ANZ and CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles
prices quoted by dealers in the privately negotiated market.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index was little changed at 77.5
basis points as of 9:25 a.m. in  Tokyo , Citigroup Inc. prices
show. The index closed at 74.3 on May 13, its lowest level in
almost five years, according to CMA.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
credit quality. A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
