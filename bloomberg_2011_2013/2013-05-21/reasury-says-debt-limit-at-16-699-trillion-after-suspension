The U.S. debt ceiling as of yesterday
was $16.699 trillion, the first number released by the Treasury
Department since the limit was suspended in early February.  The  U.S. Congress  voted at the end of January to suspend
the limit, which was then $16.394 trillion, through May 18
before President  Barack Obama  signed it into law in early
February. The Treasury can continue borrowing for several months
by shifting money among government accounts.  Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew said last week that those
so-called extraordinary measures and a one-time payment from
 Fannie Mae  will allow the U.S. to stay under the debt limit at
least until September.  As of yesterday, the total amount of debt subject to the
limit was $25 million under the ceiling, according to the
Treasuryâ€™s figures.  The cap increased to account for deficits that accrued
during the suspension period.  To contact the reporters on this story:
