BlackBerry founder  Mike Lazaridis 
said he’s confident that users of iPhones and other devices will
embrace the company’s BlackBerry Messenger platform, which will
be offered on rival phones later this year.  “BBM is by far the most compelling wireless experience and
wireless social-networking environment,” Lazaridis, who stepped
down as co-chief executive officer in early 2012, said yesterday
at the  Bloomberg Canada Economic Summit  in Toronto.  BlackBerry, based in Waterloo, Ontario, announced last week
it will bring BBM to the iPhone and Google Inc.’s Android
operating system in the next few months. The free service is
currently used by 60 million BlackBerry customers, who rely on
it to send more than 10 billion messages a day.  The move is seen as a gamble because  BlackBerry (BBRY)  will lose
control over one of its most valuable services. It’s also not
clear how the company will make money from the application. New
BBM channels -- essentially chat rooms focused on specific
themes -- may eventually create opportunities for advertisers to
target users by sponsoring posts, the company said last week.  The decision by current CEO Thorsten Heins to turn the
messaging service into a stand-alone application shows that the
new BlackBerry 10 platform is thriving and can lure users
without the exclusivity of BBM, Lazaridis said.  CEO’s Confidence  “He’s speaking to the confidence he has in the platform,”
Lazaridis said. “Not only is BlackBerry back in a big way with
BB10, he’s also showing he can expand that vision to other
platforms.”  Shares of BlackBerry have more than doubled since September
on optimism that a new lineup of BlackBerry 10 phones can help
claw back market share lost to Apple and Android. Still,
analysts have raised concerns about the company losing its
ability to wring profit from its customers.  Alexander Peterc , an analyst at Exane BNP Paribas, cut his
rating on BlackBerry to the equivalent of a sell yesterday,
citing the threat to BlackBerry’s most lucrative source of
revenue -- the service fees it charges customers. That business
generated $964 million, or 36 percent of sales, last quarter. As
competition mounts, Heins said in December that the company may
get little or no service revenue from lower-end users in the
future.  “Software and services are a vital profit pool for
BlackBerry,” Peterc said in a report. “Threatening signs of
disappearing legacy profit pools are already visible.”  BlackBerry shares  fell 2.1 percent to $14.46 at the close
in  New York .  Earlier Jump  Asked if he would have done something differently in his
last two years at the helm of BlackBerry, Lazaridis said he
should have jumped much earlier to buy QNX Software Systems, the
software maker BlackBerry acquired for $200 million in 2010 and
used as the basis for the BlackBerry 10 platform.  “Earlier, that’s the key,” he said.  Since quitting the top job at BlackBerry and then leaving
its board in March, Lazaridis has focused his attention on
quantum-computing and nanotechnology, the science and technology
of things approaching the size of an atom.  “After nearly 30 years at the helm, I think it’s time for
me to start something new,” he said.  Backed by his $100 million donation, the Mike & Ophelia
Lazaridis Quantum-Nano Centre opened in September in Waterloo.
In March, he started a C$100 million ($97 million) fund called
Quantum Valley Investments with Doug Fregin, an old friend and
co-founder of BlackBerry, previously known as  Research In Motion
Ltd. (BB)  The goal is to commercialize technologies from a cluster of
research centers.  The fund has already invested in a couple of companies,
Lazaridis said yesterday at the summit, declining to elaborate.  “We effectively missed the first quantum revolution, which
was the silicon revolution,” he said, referring to  Canada ’s
technology industry. “We just cannot afford to sit this one
out.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
