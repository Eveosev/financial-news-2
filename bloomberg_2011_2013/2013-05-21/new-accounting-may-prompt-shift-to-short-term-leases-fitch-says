Accounting changes that would require
companies to report more of their leases as assets and
liabilities may encourage businesses to structure shorter-term
rental agreements that could hamper the ability of lessors to
predict cash flows, according to Fitch Ratings.  “Companies may push for more short-term leases to avoid
putting them into the accounts,” John Boulton, an analyst at
Fitch in  London , wrote today in a report. While any ratings
impact would probably be “minimal” because analysts already
treat off-balance-sheet leases largely as debt obligations, a
shift to short-term contracts “would be credit negative for
lessors,” he wrote.  The International Accounting Standards Board and the
Financial Accounting Standards Board last week proposed rule
changes in an effort to improve transparency for a company’s
leverage, assets and risks to which it is exposed from entering
into leasing transactions. Most leases aren’t currently reported
on a lessee’s balance sheet, a system that has been criticized
for not fully reflecting a company’s finances.  The new standard, which is open for public comment until
Sept. 13, would require a lessee to recognize assets and
liabilities for leases of more than 12 months, IASB and FASB
said in the May 16 statement.  “The global move to a single leasing model and additional
disclosures should enhance comparability, and would be positive
for credit analysis,” Boulton said in the report. “Extra
information about the leased assets can help analysts better
understand the economic substance of the arrangement.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
