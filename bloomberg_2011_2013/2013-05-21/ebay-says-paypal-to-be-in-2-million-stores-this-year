EBay Inc. (EBAY)  said PayPal will be
available in 2 million retail stores this year as it takes on
Square Inc. and  Intuit Inc. (INTU)  in the market for mobile payments.  PayPal has signed up  RadioShack Corp. (RSH)  and was in 250,000
stores in April, David Marcus, the president of the division,
said at a press event at EBay’s San Jose, California,
headquarters. More in-store partnerships will be announced soon,
he said.  EBay is trying to keep PayPal’s growth on track after the
unit’s sales decelerated to 18 percent in the first quarter from
32 percent a year earlier. By promoting a credit-card reader,
PayPal is moving the payments service beyond e-mail transactions
for online goods and services and fending off rivals seeking to
lure merchants that want to offer customers a way to pay for
goods and services via smartphones.  “We had to learn the hard way that offline and getting
global acceptance, starting with the U.S. of course, is actually
going to take a lot of time and a lot of effort,” Marcus said
at the event.  PayPal gained 5 million registered users in the first
quarter, bringing the total to 128 million.  Appointed by EBay Chief Executive Officer  John Donahoe  in
April 2012, Marcus is seeking to cut back PayPal’s bureaucracy,
revamp a website deemed boring by users and fix software that
makes it hard for merchants to collect payments. Visa Inc. and
Google Inc. are also elbowing into the $170 billion market for
mobile payments.  Shares in EBay declined 1.1 percent to $55.35 at 2:18 p.m.
in  New York . The stock had climbed 9.7 percent this year through
yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
