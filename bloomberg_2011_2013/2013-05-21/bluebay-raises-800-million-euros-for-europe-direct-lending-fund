BlueBay Asset Management Ltd., a
 money manager  owned by  Royal Bank of Canada (RY) , raised more than
800 million euros ($1 billion) for a fund to lend to small and
medium-sized companies.  The BlueBay Direct Lending Fund had a final closing
exceeding the original target to raise 500 million euros,
according to an e-mailed statement. It will provide 20 million
euros to 100 million euros of financing to companies in the U.K.
and northern  Europe  valued at less than 500 million euros.  BlueBay is among a growing array of fixed-income investment
managers providing direct lending in Europe as banks cut
financing to small companies in order to meet stricter capital
rules. Small and medium-sized companies in Europe require an
estimated 100 billion euros of debt funding a year, according to
a Societe Generale SA research report last month.  “The growth in direct lending funds is providing a real
financing alternative to companies and private-equity firms in
an environment of continued retrenchment by banks from mid-market lending and we are seeing a large number of exciting
investment opportunities,” Anthony Fobel, partner and head of
private lending at London-based BlueBay, said in the statement.  Direct-lending funds typically seek to deliver returns
higher than investment-grade debt by providing high-yield
financing to sub-investment-grade companies.  More than 20 percent of the fund has been invested, BlueBay
said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
