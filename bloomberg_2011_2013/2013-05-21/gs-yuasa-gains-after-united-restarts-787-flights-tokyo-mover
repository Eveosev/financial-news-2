GS Yuasa Corp. (6674) , the maker of  lithium-ion batteries  for Boeing Co.’s 787 Dreamliner, rose by the most
in more than four years after  United Airlines (UAL) , the only U.S.
operator of the plane, resumed flights yesterday.  The Kyoto-based company  climbed  17 percent, its daily limit
and the most since November 2008, to 558 yen as of the close of
trading in  Tokyo .  ANA Holdings Inc. (9202) , the biggest operator of
Dreamliners, rose 2.3 percent to 223 yen.  United became the fourth carrier to resume flights of the
787 after a more than three-month grounding of the aircraft
after two lithium-ion battery malfunctions. ANA and Japan
Airlines Co., the second-largest operator of the planes, are set
to restart flights on June 1 after the cell overheating
incidents caused the first grounding of an entire fleet type
since 1979.  “Concerns about responsibility for the battery problems
are fading,” said Hideki Yasuda, an analyst at Ace Securities
Co. “It’s not going to turn into a blame game. With the restart
of flights by ANA and JAL, given their strict safety measures,
there’s a chance GS Yuasa shares could rise more.”  U.S. Dreamliner service gives Boeing a chance to promote
the 787’s reputation in the world’s biggest aviation market.
Qatar Airways Ltd., Ethiopian Airlines Enterprise and Air India
Ltd. have also restarted 787 flights.  The 787 returned to service on United Flight 1 from Houston
to  Chicago , with Boeing Chief Executive Officer Jim McNerney and
 Jeff Smisek , CEO of airline parent United Continental Holdings
Inc., sitting next to each other in coach. They were seen
chatting during the two-hour flight, which landed about 1:15
p.m. local time.  To contact the reporters on this story:
