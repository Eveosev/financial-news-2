Reunert Ltd. (RLO) , a supplier to state-controlled fixed-line operator Telkom South Africa Ltd., said
first-half profit fell 14 percent as a slowing economy curbed
revenue.  Net income for the six months through March fell to 421
million rand ($44.5 million) from 492 million rand a year ago,
the Johannesburg-based company said in a statement today.
Revenue declined 8 percent to 5.27 billion rand.  A weak rand, slower mining activities and a decline in
mobile interconnect rates is hurting the company’s sales and
profitability, according to the company.  The decline in profit “was experienced across all segments
and is attributable primarily to the prevailing difficult
business environment,” Reunert said.  Sales at Reunert’s Nashua unit, accounting for 63 percent
of revenue, declined to 3.3 billion rand from 3.6 billion rand.
Operating profit at the division fell 23 percent to 311 million
rand.  Reunert  shares  declined for a fifth day yesterday, falling
1 percent to 68.65 rand, giving the company a market value of
13.8 billion rand. The stock has retreated 8.9 percent this
year, compared with a 4.7 percent gain in the 166-member
 FTSE/JSE Africa All Shares Index. (JALSH)   The company will pay an interim dividend of 95 cents for
the period, unchanged from a year ago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
