Egyptian security forces killed one
gunman and captured three others in north Sinai, as the military
boosted its presence in the largely lawless region following the
kidnapping of seven security personnel.  The clash erupted as military and police forces were
conducting an operation in a village in the peninsula, the
state-run Ahram Gate reported, citing state television.  The May 16 kidnapping of the seven security personnel --
six members of the  Interior Ministry  and an army conscript --
was the latest challenge for President Mohamed Mursi. The
Islamist is grappling with mounting criticism over his
stewardship of the economy amid growing political polarization.  Mursi has ruled out negotiating with what the presidency
has described as “criminals” and officials have said all
options are available to resolve the matter. The kidnapping
represented the most serious security breaches in the Sinai
since the August killing of 16 Egyptian border guards at the
hands of militants, and spotlighted the rising lawlessness in
the strategic peninsula since the 2011 ouster of  Hosni Mubarak .  Following the abduction, the military and police boosted
their presence in north Sinai, deploying dozens of items of
heavy equipment, as well as sending in additional troops
including elite commandos, state media reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
