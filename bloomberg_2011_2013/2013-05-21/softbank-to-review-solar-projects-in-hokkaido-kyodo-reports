SoftBank Corp. (9984)  will review solar
projects it’s planning for Japan’s northernmost island because
 Hokkaido Electric Power Co. (9509)  hasn’t approved applications for
power sales, Kyodo News agency reported today.  SoftBank may even consider halting plans for three solar
stations, two in Abira Town and one in Yakumo, Kyodo said. The
three plants were to have a combined capacity of more than 180
megawatts, the agency reported, citing unidentified officials.  The company is considering what to do in the future,
Kenichi Yuasa, a spokesman, said by phone today, adding that
SoftBank isn’t the source of the Kyodo report. SoftBank has
announced two projects in Hokkaido, a 110-megawatt plant in
Abira and a 2.7 megawatt station in Shiraoi, the spokesman said.  Hokkaido, with its availability of cheap land, has drawn
more applications for solar projects than its grid can handle
after  Japan  began an incentive program for clean energy in July.  Hokkaido Electric has said that it may become difficult to
provide grid connections once connected capacity for solar
plants 2 megawatts or larger reaches about 400 megawatts,
according to a company  statement  on April 17.  To contact the reporter on this story:
