Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd. (7270) ’s Subaru
Forester compact sport utility vehicle beat  Honda Motor Co. (7267) ’s
CR-V and other rivals in testing by Consumer Reports, which
ranked the model as its top pick in that segment.  The revamped 2014 model light truck from Tokyo-based Fuji
Heavy won praise from the non-profit magazine for “space-efficient design, large windows, and big square doors.” Those
and other features helped it outscore CR-V,  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) ’s
RAV4 and  Mazda Motor Corp. (7261) ’s CX-5, Consumer Reports said.  “If you’re looking for a small SUV that’s very functional
and fuel-efficient, the Forester is hard to beat,” Jake Fisher,
director of auto testing at Consumer Reports, said in an e-mailed statement. The magazine also said the Subaru model has
quicker acceleration and leads competitors in fuel economy.  Praise from the influential publication comes after Fuji
Heavy this month said it will invest $400 million to boost U.S.
capacity by the end of 2016 as demand rises for its vehicles
including the Forester SUV. U.S. Subaru sales for Toyota-affiliated Fuji Heavy rose 17 percent this year through April,
the biggest increase among Asia-based carmakers. Compact SUV and
sport wagon sales are up 15 percent to 1.05  million units in
the first four months, according to Autodata Corp.  Consumer Reports  said its review of the Forester will
appear in the magazine’s July edition. Subaru’s U.S. sales unit
is based in  Cherry Hill , New Jersey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
