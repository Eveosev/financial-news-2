Seven people were injured in clashes
between workers and security personnel at  Lanxess AG (LXS) ’s chrome
unit in South Africa today amid a wildcat strike over pay.  Security guards shot at employees with rubber bullets,
hitting two, Sibonile Dube, a Johannesburg-based spokeswoman for
the company, said in an e-mail. Two guards were hit by stones
thrown by the workers who have been on a wildcat strike since
May 16, she said. Three other employees were hurt.  “Our security guards were acting in self-defense as the
strikers started throwing stones at them,” Dube said.  Mining companies in South Africa, which has the world’s
biggest known reserves of chrome and platinum, are bracing for
wage talks, with one union demanding increases of as much as 61
percent. The local chrome operation of Lanxess, a Leverkusen,
Germany-based synthetic rubber maker and chemicals company, is
in Rustenburg, where  platinum producers  are contending with
union rivalry and where at least 46 people were killed in unrest
last year.  About 470 workers at Lanxess’s local unit started an
unprotected strike last week, demanding annual performance-related payments in addition to an existing wage agreement.  Employees in  South Africa  may strike legally, with their
jobs protected, if an independent mediator agrees to a stoppage
and after talks between unions and companies fail.  More than 15 Lanxess South Africa workers were shot at the
mine, Johannesburg-based SAFM radio reported, without saying
where it got the information.  To contact the reporter on this story:
