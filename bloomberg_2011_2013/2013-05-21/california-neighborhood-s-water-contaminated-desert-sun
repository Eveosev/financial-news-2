The discovery of contaminated water
in samples from a Southern California neighborhood prompted the
Indio Water Authority to provide alternative supplies to more
than 115 households, the Desert Sun said, citing the utility.  Water samples tested last week in Indio, home of the annual
Coachella Valley Arts and Music Festival, showed more than 7
parts per billion of perchlorate, above the safe 6-ppb
threshold. Source of the high levels of perchlorate, used in
rocket fuel and explosives, is unclear, the Riverside County
Department of Environmental Health told the newspaper.  Water to the neighborhood is being provided by a temporary,
above-ground pipe after contaminants were found in nearby well
samples, the Palm Springs-based paper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
