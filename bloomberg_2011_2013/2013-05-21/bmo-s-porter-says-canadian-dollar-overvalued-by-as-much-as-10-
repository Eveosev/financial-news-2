Doug Porter , chief economist at the
Bank of Montreal, said the Canadian dollar is overvalued by 5
percent to 10 percent given levels of commodity prices.  Porter, speaking in an interview today at Bloomberg’s
Canada Economic Summit in Toronto, said the Canadian dollar will
continue to be supported by safe-haven flows in the next couple
of years, keeping it trading near parity with the U.S. dollar
before weakening in the “medium-term.”  There is also no urgency for the Bank of Canada to raise
 interest rates , Porter said, adding there is a case for the
country’s central bank to drop its tightening bias because the
housing market has cooled.  To contact the reporter on this story:
