Andrea Horwath, leader of Ontario’s
opposition  New Democratic Party , says she’s agreed to support
the governing  Liberal party ’s budget, meaning  Canada ’s most
populous province won’t face an early election.  “We are prepared to support this budget,” Horwath said in
a news conference in Toronto.  With 51 seats in the 107-seat legislature and two seats
vacant, the Liberal Party needs support from opposition parties
to pass their budget and avoid an election. While the
Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario pledged to oppose the
fiscal plan, NDP demands to lower car insurance premiums,
introduce initiatives on youth unemployment and boost home
healthcare spending were included in the Liberal budget.  In further negotiations after the budget was presented May
2, the government accepted an NDP demand for a Financial
Accountability Officer to monitor spending.  To contact the reporter on this story:
