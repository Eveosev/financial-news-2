Dallas  Cowboys quarterback  Tony Romo 
will probably miss offseason training activities over the next
three weeks after having surgery last month to remove a cyst
from his back, the team said on its  website .  Romo had the procedure a month after signing a six-year
contract extension that ESPN reported was worth $108 million and
made him the highest-paid player in franchise history.  The surgery may also prevent Romo from participating in a
three-day minicamp in June, though the Cowboys expect him to be
ready for the start of training camp on July 19. He hasn’t been
participating in the bi-weekly throwing sessions that began last
month, according to the team’s website.  Romo has spent his entire nine-year National Football
League career in Dallas, compiling a 55-38 record as a starter
while passing for 25,737 yards, 177 touchdowns and 91
interceptions. The Cowboys haven’t had a winning season since
2009, when they went 11-5.  To contact the reporter on this story:
