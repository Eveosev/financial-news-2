GlassPoint Solar Inc. ’s completion of
the first Middle Eastern solar plant that makes steam to extract
crude from aging oilfields, on time and under budget, will help
encourage orders in the region for the producer’s technology.  The California-based company said today it commissioned the
7-megawatt enhanced oil-recovery plant, producing 50 metric tons
of steam a day to be injected into the Amal oilfield in Southern
Oman. The plant is a venture with Petroleum Development Oman.  “We spoke to every national and international oil company
in the region on developing similar plants,” Chief Executive
Officer Rod Macgregor said. “Everyone was waiting to see the
results of Oman’s pilot plant and with this completed we have
better chances to apply this technology in other countries.”  While natural gas is traditionally used to heat steam,
countries are considering solar as an alternative, Macgregor
said. Oman uses 22 percent of its total natural gas output to
generate steam and pump more oil from the ground, he said.  Macgregor said the new plant is producing 10 percent more
steam than agreed. The company is also in talks with PDO to
develop more projects on a larger scale, he said.  GlassPoint said in December it gained funding to expand in
places such as the  Middle East  from a group including  Royal
Dutch Shell Plc. (RDSA)  Kuwait and Bahrain, where  Chevron Corp. (CVX)  and
 Occidental Petroleum Corp. (OXY)  are trying to extract heavy crude
from deposits, are targets for Glasspoint, Macgregor said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
