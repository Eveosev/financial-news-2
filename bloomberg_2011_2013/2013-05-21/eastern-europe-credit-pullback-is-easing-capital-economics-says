Eastern  Europe ’s credit shortage is
easing, though conditions will remain tight as lenders in the
continent’s west pull back, according to Capital Economics Ltd.  About 12 billion euros ($15.4 billion) of foreign funding
has left the region since mid-2011, equivalent to about 9
percent of liabilities,  William Jackson , emerging-market
economist at London-based Capital, said today. While withdrawals
have slowed this year, nations including Poland, Hungary and
 Romania , remain at risk of a new credit crunch from an
“external shock,” he wrote in an e-mailed note.  “The risk of a painful banking crisis is much lower now
than it was just a year ago,” Jackson said. “Even so, the fact
that deleveraging is ongoing, coupled with high levels of non-performing loans, a legacy of the pre-crisis lending boom, means
that credit conditions are set to remain tight in the region for
some time.”  The so-called “deleveraging” process is abating in
eastern Europe, where western lenders control three quarters of
banking assets, according to  the Vienna Initiative , a group of
banks, regulators and policy makers that helped prevent an
eastern European financial collapse in 2008 and 2009. Still, bad
loans and sluggish demand from recession-hit borrowers are
curbing credit growth, the group said May 2 in a report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
