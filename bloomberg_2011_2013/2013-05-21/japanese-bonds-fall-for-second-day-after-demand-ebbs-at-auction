Japanese bonds fell for a second day,
with yields set for their highest close in almost a year, as
demand waned at a 40-year debt auction today.  Investors at the 399.9 billion yen ($3.9 billion) sale  bid 
for 2.64 times the amount of debt offered, the lowest level
since August 2011. The bonds sold at a 1.955 percent yield.
Traders expected 1.93 percent, based on a Bloomberg News survey.  “Some people had expected higher yields to draw demand
from investors and thus a better auction result,” said  Akito Fukunaga , the chief rates strategist in  Tokyo  at Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc’s RBS Securities unit, one of the 24 primary
dealers that underwrite the government debt. “Bad auction
results” drove the market down, he said.  Japan  10-year yields increased four basis points to 0.88
percent as of 3:49 p.m. in Tokyo, according to Japan Bond
Trading Co. The price of the 0.6 percent note due in March 2023
fell 0.353 yen, or 353 yen per 100,000 yen face amount, to
97.468 yen. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point. The last
time the market closed at this yield was in June 2012.  Japanese government bonds have fallen 1.5 percent this
month as of yesterday, according to Bank of America Merrill
Lynch indexes. The Topix index of stocks returned 9 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg, curbing demand for the
haven of debt.  ‘Narrow Line’  Komal Sri-Kumar, the founder of  Sri-Kumar Global Strategies
Inc. , an economic consulting company in Santa Monica,
 California , said Japan’s debt is so large that it threatens to
undermine the bond market.  Japan’s borrowings are equal to 214 percent of the nation’s
gross domestic product, the most in the world, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The 10-year yield climbed as high as 0.92
percent this month.  “If suddenly it goes to 1.5 or 2 percent, you have people
who are exiting Japan government bonds,” Sri-Kumar said on
Bloomberg Television’s “Asia Edge” with  Susan Li  and  Rishaad
Salamat . “You have some amount of rotation” from bonds to
stocks. “The rotation can become a flight. The distinction
between rotation and completely fleeing the yen, fleeing the
Japan government bonds, is a very narrow line.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
