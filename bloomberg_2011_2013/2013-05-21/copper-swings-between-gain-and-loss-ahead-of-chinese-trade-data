Copper swung between gains and losses
ahead of Chinese trade data to be released today as mine-supply
concerns weighed against speculation that the U.S. Federal
Reserve will scale back stimulus.  The metal for delivery in three months on the London Metal
Exchange was little changed at $7,397 a metric ton at 11:19 a.m.
in  Tokyo  after trading between $7,360 and $7,415.25. Futures for
delivery in July on the Comex were also little changed at $3.357
per pound.  An accident at  Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. (FCX) ’s
Grasberg site in  Indonesia  triggered supply concerns. Chicago
Fed President  Charles Evans  said yesterday that the  U.S. economy 
is “improving quite a lot” and growth should be self-sustaining in 2014, stoking speculation the Fed may taper its
$85 billion in monthly purchases of securities. China will
release trade data for April around 2:30 p.m. local time.  “Freeport’s accident at its Indonesian mine has lent
support to the copper market,” said Chae Un Soo, a metals
trader at Korea Exchange Bank Futures Co. in Seoul.  Work has been halted at Grasberg, the world’s second-biggest copper mine, since a tunnel collapsed on May 14, and the
death toll has climbed to 17.  Freeport, based in Phoenix, was shipping concentrate, a
semi-processed ore, as of May 17, its Indonesian unit said last
week. Of 38 workers who had been in a classroom in an
underground training facility at the time of the accident, 10
have been rescued and 11 still may be buried under the rubble.  The contract for September delivery on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange climbed 1.4 percent to 53,250  yuan  ($8,682) a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
