Hong Kong’s stock exchange opened for
afternoon trading after a storm dumped as much as 200
millimeters (8 inches) of rain on the city and forced most
services to shut down for the morning.  The stock exchange canceled morning trading after the  Hong
Kong Observatory  issued its highest-level rainstorm warning at
4:10 a.m. The black warning was in effect for about five hours
before being lifted as the rain eased.  China Galaxy Securities
Co. (6881) , which made its debut in Hong Kong today, postponed its
listing ceremony to tomorrow.  Hong Kong police received reports of landslides in several
neighborhoods, according to statements on the government’s
website.  MTR Corp. (66)  said some trains were delayed as the bad
weather affected signal operation. Schools suspended classes,
while court and tribunal hearings were adjourned for the
morning, according to a government statement.  Hong Kong issues the black signal when rainfall is expected
to exceed 70 millimeters in an hour, according to the
observatory. Banks were closed in the morning and opened after
the storm signal was lowered, the Hong Kong Association of Banks
said in a statement.  The city said employers shouldn’t require staff to report
for work unless previous arrangements have been made, and those
working outdoors should stop immediately, according to a
statement on its website.  To contact the reporters on this story:
