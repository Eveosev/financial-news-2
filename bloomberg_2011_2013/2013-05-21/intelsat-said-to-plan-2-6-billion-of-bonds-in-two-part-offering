Intelsat SA (I) , the commercial satellite
operator, plans to offer $2 billion of new 10-year bonds and
$635 million added to its December 2022 notes sold last year.  The company may issue the senior notes through its Intelsat
Jackson Holdings unit as soon as today, according to a person
familiar with the transaction. The $640 million of 6.625 percent
securities the Luxembourg-based company is adding to, initially
sold in September, yielded 5.42 percent yesterday, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Intelsat last sold debt in March, issuing $3.5 billion in a
deal that included $2 billion of 7.75 percent, eight-year notes,
Bloomberg data show. The securities were quoted yesterday at
106.5 cents on the dollar for a yield of 6.68 percent, Bloomberg
data show.  Proceeds will be used to pay existing debt, said the
person, who asked not to be identified because terms arenâ€™t set.
Bank of America Corp., Barclays Plc, Credit Suisse Group AG,
Deutsche Bank AG, Goldman Sachs Group Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co.
and Morgan Stanley are managing the offering, the person said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
