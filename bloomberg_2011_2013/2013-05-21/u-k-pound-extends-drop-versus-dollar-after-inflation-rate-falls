The pound extended a decline against
the dollar and weakened versus the euro after a report showed
U.K. inflation slowed more than economists forecast in April to
a seven-month low.  Sterling slid 0.4 percent to $1.5188 at 9:32 a.m. London
time and declined 0.3 percent to 84.67 pence per euro.  To contact the reporter on this story:
