Transnational Corp. of Nigeria Plc ,
which invests in hotels, agriculture and energy, fell the most
in more than a month after profit for 2012 retreated 58 percent.  The stock declined for a second day, losing 7 percent to
1.20 naira by 2:20 p.m. in Lagos, Nigeria’s commercial capital,
the biggest drop since April 17, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. About 20 million shares, or 94 percent of the three-month daily average volume, were traded.  Transcorp’s profit for the full year through December
slipped to 2.5 billion naira ($16 million) from 5.9 billion
naira a year earlier, it said today in Nigerian Stock Exchange
filing. Revenue was 13.2 billion naira from 13.9 billion naira.  “Investors that held the shares, anticipating better
performance, were disappointed,” Raheem Mohammed, chief
executive officer of the Lagos-based Kundila Finance Ltd., said
by phone. “The company didn’t declare a dividend, contrary to
expectations.”  Transcorp began a sale of shares to existing investors this
month as part of plans to raise 15 billion naira to refinance a
power project and expand investments in oil exploration and
hotels.  The stock has risen 14 percent this year, underperforming
the 31 percent gain in the Nigerian Stock Exchange All-Share
 Index. (NGSEINDX)   To contact the reporter on this story:
