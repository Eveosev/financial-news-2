Scotland  focused an 18-million pound
($27 million) fund for marine energy on wave power as it seeks
to get all its power from renewables by the end of the decade.  The Marine Renewables Commercialization Fund, started in
May last year to support wave and tidal energy, will now be used
for wave projects only after tidal plans won other funding, the
Scottish government said today in a statement.  “The need for differentiated funding for wave and tidal
technologies has been debated for a while now within industry
circles,” Energy Minister Fergus Ewing said. “Scotland needs
both wave and tidal stream technologies to help decarbonize our
electricity system, increase  energy security , and reduce
dependence on imported fossil fuels.”  Applications for funding can be made on June 3 with first
awards expected in summer, according to the statement.  Scotland got more than a third of its power from renewable sources in
2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
