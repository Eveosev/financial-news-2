Yingli Green Energy Holding Co. (YGE) , the
largest solar-panel maker, rose the most in six weeks after
saying first-quarter shipments will exceed its previous
forecast.  Yingli’s American depository receipts gained 15 percent to
$3.55 at the close in New York, the most intraday since April 9.
Each ADR is worth one ordinary share.  Shipments for the quarter will decline about 6 percent to 7
percent from the fourth quarter, compared with a March forecast
for a slump in the “low to mid-teen percentage,” Baoding,
China-based Yingli said today in a statement.  The company reaffirmed quarterly gross margins will be 4
percent to 4.2 percent. Yingli is scheduled to report first-quarter earnings on May 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
