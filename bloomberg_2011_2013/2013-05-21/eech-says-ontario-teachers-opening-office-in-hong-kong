Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan 
received its full licensing in  Hong Kong  today and the fund will
open an office there, according to Chief Executive Officer James
Leech.  “Today we received notification that we have our full
licensing in Hong Kong and we will be opening a Hong Kong office
in the next couple of months with some feet on the street now,”
Leech, 65, said at the Bloomberg Canada Summit in Toronto. “I
think that signals what we are doing.”  Leech said 70 percent to 80 percent of world trade will be
among Asian economies.  “That’s where wealth will be created and where we have to
be to take advantage of that,” said Leech.  To contact the reporter on this story:
