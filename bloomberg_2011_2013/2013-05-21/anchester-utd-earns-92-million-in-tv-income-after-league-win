Manchester United  earned 60.8 million
pounds ($92.1 million) in broadcast payments as it won its 20th
English championship this season.  United’s total included 15.1 million pounds in “merit
payment” for finishing atop the league and 13.0 million from
its games being shown on domestic television, according to a
 statement  from the Premier League. It’s the highest total ever
awarded to the title winner.  Manchester City  earned 58.1 million pounds as runner-up in
the 20-team league. Arsenal received 57.1 million pounds and
Tottenham got 55.9 million pounds for finishing fourth and fifth
respectively, more than third-place Chelsea, which earned 55.0
million pounds.  Queens Park Rangers, relegated to the second-tier
Championship after finishing in last place, was the lowest-earning club at 39.8 million pounds. Reading, which finished in
19th place, received 40.0 million pounds and Wigan, the other
demoted team, got 40.8 million pounds.  In addition to money based on their position in the
standings and number of appearances made on domestic television,
each club’s total included 13.8 million pounds from U.K.
broadcast rights and 18.9 million pounds from overseas
television.  To contact the reporter on this story:
