Sonova Holding AG (SOON)  forecast that
profit growth will slow this year because of government
reimbursement changes in the Netherlands and Scandinavia and
weakening sales in  Europe .  Earnings before interest, taxes and acquisition-related
amortization and impairments will rise 9 percent to 13 percent
in local currencies compared with a 15 percent jump in the 12
months ended March, the Staefa, Switzerland-based company said
in a  statement  today. Sales on that basis will rise 6 percent to
8 percent, versus a 7.4 percent gain in fiscal 2013.  “The real disappointment is the outlook, especially on the
back of recent product launches,” Oliver Metzger, an analyst
with Commerzbank AG, said in a phone interview today. “It
indicates a slowdown in momentum.”  Full-year Ebita fell to 182.8 million Swiss francs ($189
million) from 315.2 million francs in fiscal 2012 after Sonova
increased product-liability provisions by 197.8 million francs
to cover claims related to a 2006 recall of cochlear implants
made by its Advanced Bionics unit. Excluding the one-time
charges and currency effects, Ebita increased to 386.4 million
francs.  Sonova  fell  as much as 4.8 percent to 99.60 francs, the
steepest intraday drop since April 18, and was trading down 4.3
percent at 9:14 a.m. in Zurich. That propelled the stock to a
1.3 percent decline this year.  Sales increased 11 percent to 1.8 billion francs, in line
with the 1.82 billion-franc average of 17 analyst estimates
compiled by Bloomberg. The company plans a dividend of 1.60
francs a share.  To contact the reporter on this story:
