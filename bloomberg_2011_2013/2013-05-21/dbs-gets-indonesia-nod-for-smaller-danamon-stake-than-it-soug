DBS Group Holdings Ltd. (DBS) , Southeast
Asia’s largest lender, won approval from  Indonesia ’s central
bank to acquire a smaller stake in PT Bank Danamon Indonesia
than it had sought more than a year ago.  DBS, which in April 2012 proposed buying all of Danamon,
will be allowed to buy 40 percent, Bank Indonesia Governor
Darmin Nasution said in parliament today in Jakarta. DBS
spokeswoman Edna Koh declined to immediately comment on the
Singapore-based bank’s plans.  The decision may jeopardize DBS’s proposed $6.8 billion
acquisition of Bank Danamon in what would have been Southeast
Asia’s biggest banking takeover. Approval for the deal has been
delayed as Indonesian authorities pushed Singapore to provide
more access for that country’s lenders.  The central bank is seeking reciprocity for the three
biggest state-owned Indonesian lenders’ operations in  Singapore ,
Nasution said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
