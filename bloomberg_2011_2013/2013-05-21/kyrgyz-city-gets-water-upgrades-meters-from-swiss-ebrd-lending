Kant, an industrial city east of the
Kyrgyzstan capital that houses an air base and brewery, is
getting 7.7 million euros ($9.8 million) in grants and loans
from the Swiss government and European Bank for Reconstruction
and Development for water and wastewater upgrades.  The EBRD said today in a statement that Kant is the first
Kyrgyz city where local water and sewage services are operated
by a private company, resulting in a round-the-clock water
supply. New pipes will be installed, water pressure improved and
losses from leaks reduced with the introduction of a city-wide
metering system from the new funds, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
