At a time when diminishing faith in
gold is spurring investors to sell record amounts of the metal,
demand for platinum and palladium is strengthening as mining
companies curb supply.  Gold owned through exchange-traded products fell 17 percent
this year as platinum holdings rose 31 percent and those in
palladium 17 percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Platinum
will end the year at $1,690 an ounce, or 16 percent more than
now, while palladium will gain 7.5 percent to $800 an ounce,
according to the medians of 15 analyst estimates compiled by
Bloomberg. The majority of 38 analysts surveyed last month said
gold would post an annual drop, ending a 12-year winning streak.  The divergence underscores the waning trust in gold as a
store of value after prices tumbled into a  bear market  in April.
Strengthening investor demand for platinum-group metals, used in
catalytic converters, reflects a second year of shortages that
are outweighing concerns about slowing economic growth. Global
car sales will expand to a record this year and next, according
to LMC Automotive Ltd., a research company in Oxford,  England .  “Anybody who wants to participate in precious metals,
that’s getting whipsawed like on gold, is looking at much
smaller precious-metals markets as being attractive,” said
Jeffrey Sica, who helps oversee more than $1 billion of assets
as president of SICA Wealth in Morristown,  New Jersey . “If you
look at platinum and palladium, even with an economic slowdown,
they’re able to maintain healthy levels of demand.”  Industrial Applications  Platinum fell 5.2 percent to $1,460.50 in  London  this year
as palladium rose 6.2 percent to $747.60. Gold retreated 18
percent to $1,376.65 an ounce and silver plunged 26 percent to
$22.4602 an ounce. The Standard & Poor’s GSCI gauge of 24
commodities declined 2.5 percent since the start of January and
the MSCI All-Country World Index of equities rose 12 percent. A
Bank of America Corp. index shows Treasuries lost 0.4 percent.  Industrial applications account for about 10 percent of
gold consumption, compared with 60 percent for platinum and 91
percent for palladium, data from the World Gold Council and
Johnson Matthey Plc show. Palladium demand advanced 16 percent
to a record 9.9 million ounces last year and while platinum
usage dropped 0.6 percent to 8.05 million ounces, it was still
the third-highest level ever, according to Johnson Matthey,
which has made one in three of the world’s autocatalysts.  Disrupted Mining  Demand for both metals is exceeding supply for a second
consecutive year and will do so again in 2014, Barclays Plc
estimates. The shortages emerged as strikes disrupted mining and
stockpiles dwindled, resulting in a 10 percent drop in platinum
output and 11 percent retreat in palladium production last year,
according to Morgan Stanley.  While the mining slump boosted prices, it also hurt
producers, with  Anglo American Platinum Ltd. (AMS) , the biggest,
reporting a record loss of 6.7 billion rand ($705 million) in
2012. Shares of the Johannesburg-based company fell as much as
39 percent to an almost eight-year low of 273.18 rand this year.  The strength of economies is the greatest threat to the
projected gains in prices because central banks are still
printing money on an unprecedented scale to bolster growth. Bank
of America says policy makers cut  interest rates  more than 500
times since June 2007 and the  International Monetary Fund 
lowered its 2013 global outlook four times since July.  Platinum tumbled 39 percent in 2008, the most in at least
two decades, and palladium declined 49 percent as the global
economy endured its worst recession since World War II. Platinum
demand still hasn’t rebounded to its level in 2007 and for
palladium it took three years to recover.  Global Growth  “They’re both a precious metal and an industrial metal,”
said Walter “Bucky” Hellwig, who helps manage $17 billion of
assets at BB&T Wealth Management in Birmingham,  Alabama . “Gold
and silver, which are also precious metals, are breaking down,
which is a headwind, but if we get continued slowing of global
growth it’s going to be the key driver in the price.”  Hedge funds  and other large speculators are getting less
bullish. They cut bets on higher platinum prices by 44 percent
since mid-February and those in palladium by 27 percent in the
past six weeks, U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission data
show. The net-long position in both metals is still above the
average of the past three years at a time when money managers
hold a record 74,432 so-called short contracts for gold futures.  Platinum and palladium mining is concentrated in two
nations, increasing the potential scale of disruptions during
labor protests.  South Africa  and  Russia  account for 86 percent
of platinum output and 80 percent of palladium supply, Barclays
estimates. Strikes cost South African mining companies as much
as 15 billion rand in revenue last year, according to the
National Treasury.  Restore Profit  Anglo American Platinum said May 10 it would idle three
shafts and cut 6,000 jobs to help restore profit. Platinum
production capacity will be reduced by as much as 350,000
ounces. That implies a drop of 165,000 to 170,000 ounces in
palladium and 40,000 to 45,000 ounces of  rhodium , both of which
are found in the same ores, the company said in an e-mail.
Rhodium is also used in catalytic converters.  Rising labor and energy costs may mean more mines closing
and companies’ efforts to preserve capital means significant
gains in supply are unlikely, Commerzbank AG said in a May 7
report. The industry is in a “very tough place,”  Lonmin Plc (LMI) 
Acting Chief Executive Officer Simon Scott said in an interview
with Bloomberg Television May 13. The company is the third-largest platinum producer and its Marikana mine in South Africa
shut the following day because of a strike.  State Secret  Palladium supply is also being constrained by declining
state stockpiles in Russia, with Johnson Matthey projecting
sales of about 100,000 ounces in 2013, the last year of
“substantial shipments.” The reserves, which are a state
secret, provided 1 million ounces to consumers as recently as
2010, according to data compiled by Johnson Matthey.  European Union car sales rose in April for the first time
in 19 months, the Brussels-based European Automobile
Manufacturers’ Association said May 17. Global sales will rise
3.4 percent to 83.8 million units this year and climb another 6
percent in 2014, according to LMC Automotive. Autocatalysts are
canisters with honeycomb-like surfaces that convert car
emissions into less harmful substances.  Holdings of platinum in ETPs tracked by Bloomberg advanced
to 61.2 metric tons valued at $2.9 billion this year, as of May
20, as the amount of palladium increased to 67.2 tons valued at
$1.6 billion. Gold investment through the products dropped to
2,187.4 tons valued at $97.2 billion. The metal will close the
year at $1,550, 7.5 percent less than at the end of 2012,
according to the median of Bloomberg’s survey last month.  “There is a legitimate argument to say that PGMs offer
some value relative to gold,” said  Charles Morris , who oversees
about $2.5 billion at HSBC Global Asset Management in London.
“If you do want to be in precious metals then this is the best
risk-reward you can get.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
