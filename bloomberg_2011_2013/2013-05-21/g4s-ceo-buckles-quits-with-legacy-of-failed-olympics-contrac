G4S Plc (GFS)  said Nick Buckles will step
down as chief executive officer after a six-year period at the
helm that soured after the company’s failure to provide
sufficient security at London’s Olympic Games last year.  Buckles will retire on May 31 and be succeeded by Chief
Financial Officer Ashley Almanza, the Crawley, England-based
company said in a statement today. Almanza was hired at the
start of this month.  “The board is extremely pleased to have attracted Ashley
Almanza to the group,” G4S said in the statement. “He brings a
wealth of experience from working across international borders
in complex businesses and we are confident he will provide
strong strategic and operational leadership to the group.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
