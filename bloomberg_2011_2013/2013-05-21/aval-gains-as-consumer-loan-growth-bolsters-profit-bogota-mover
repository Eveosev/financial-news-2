Grupo Aval Acciones y Valores SA 
jumped to a record after posting a 33 percent quarterly profit
increase on what Credicorp Capital called a “good performance”
in  consumer lending .  Preferred shares in the banking group controlled by
billionaire  Luis Carlos Sarmiento  Angulo gained 3.5 percent to
1,345 pesos at the close in Bogota, the highest since they
started trading in May 2011. The stock was the best performer on
Colombia’s benchmark  Colcap index , which rose 0.5 percent.  Net income rose to 505.3 billion pesos ($274 million),
according to a May 20  report  on its website. The company’s
return on average equity was 18.7 percent, compared with 15.6
percent for Bancolombia SA and 13.7 percent for Banco Davivienda
SA, according to Credicorp Capital.  The first quarter results confirm Aval “as the most
profitable financial conglomerate in our banking coverage,”
Juan C. Dominguez, an analyst at Credicorp Capital’s  Colombia 
unit, wrote today in a note to clients. He rates the shares
“attractive” with a year-end target price of 1,505 pesos.  Consumer loans grew 19.4 percent from a year earlier,
financial leases rose by 19 percent and mortgages increased 14.7
percent, according to Aval.  To contact the reporter on this story:
