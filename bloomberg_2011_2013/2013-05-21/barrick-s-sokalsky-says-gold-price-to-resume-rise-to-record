Barrick Gold Corp. (ABX)  chief executive
officer Jamie Sokalsky said gold prices can resume their gains
toward the $1,700 to $1,800-an-ounce range.  Factors for “a continued rise in the gold price are still
there,” Sokalsky said today at the Bloomberg Canada Summit in
Toronto.  Central bank buying, world economic conditions and high
debt levels will push gold to a record “in the long-term.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
