 Sherutei Bar Grains Import Ltd., an
Israeli importer, is seeking 80,000 metric tons of corn and
60,000 tons of feed wheat, according to three people familiar
with the tender.  The company is also seeking 20,000 tons of barley, said the
people, who asked not to be identified because the tender hasnâ€™t
been publicly announced. The bids are due by May 23, they said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
