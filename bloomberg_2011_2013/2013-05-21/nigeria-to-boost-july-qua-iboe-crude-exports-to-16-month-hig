Nigeria ,  Africa ’s largest oil
producer, is set to increase exports of its benchmark Qua Iboe
crude in July to the highest in 16 months, according to a
loading program obtained by  Bloomberg News .  The country will ship 13 cargoes of 950,000 barrels each,
or 398,387 barrels a day, the plan showed. That compares with
daily exports of 316,667 barrels in June and matches the March
2012 figure, according to data compiled by Bloomberg News.  Qua Iboe’s  premium  to Dated Brent fell today by 3 cents to
$2.87 a barrel, the lowest since Feb. 27, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  Shipments of Nigeria’s Yoho grade will double to two
950,000-barrel consignments in July, a separate plan showed.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
