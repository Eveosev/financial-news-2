Michael Wilson, a former Canadian
finance minister and ambassador to the U.S., said Bank of Canada
Governor Mark Carney faces a “big, big management challenge”

deputies, Wilson, 75, chairman of Barclays Capital Canada, said
today at the Bloomberg Canada Economic Summit in Toronto.  To contact the reporter on this story:
