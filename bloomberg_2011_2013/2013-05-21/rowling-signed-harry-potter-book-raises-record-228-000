A first-edition copy of “ Harry Potter  and the Philosopher’s Stone” with handwritten notes by author  J.K. Rowling  sold for 150,000 pounds ($228,000) at a charity auction in  London  last night.  The  Sotheby’s (BID)  copy, sold to an anonymous phone bidder, also contained illustrations by Rowling. The event was organized with the English PEN writers’ association, which campaigns for freedom of expression.  There was a round of applause for the price, which was a record for a printed book by Rowling. A total of 50 authors including Kazuo Ishiguro, Ian McEwan and Seamus Heaney contributed books to the “First Editions, Second Thoughts” event, which raised a total of 439,200 pounds.  The second-highest price was the 30,000 pounds paid for “Matilda” by Roald Dahl, with new illustrations by Quentin Blake.
