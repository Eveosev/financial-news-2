A rising dollar may help push U.S.
stocks higher by giving international investors more incentive
to buy, according to  Michael Shaoul , chief executive officer of
Marketfield Asset Management.  The CHART OF THE DAY displays the performance of the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and the Dollar Index since 1994 in
the top panel. The correlation between the gauges, based on the
most recent 200 weeks of trading, appears in the bottom panel.  March marked the first time since 2005 that the Dollar
Index, which IntercontinentalExchange Inc. uses to track the
currency’s value against the currencies of six of the largest
U.S. trading partners, had a positive correlation with the S&P
500. Since then, the relationship has grown stronger each week.  “Foreign capital flows are starting to be attracted to the
U.S. equity market” in a way last seen when the Internet bubble
sent stocks surging in the 1990s, Shaoul wrote. The New York-based analyst added that he expects the dollar and share prices
to rise together for the next few months.  Last week’s correlation reading was 0.14, well above a low
of minus 0.77 in November 2011. The figures can be as high as 1
when prices of two assets rise and fall in lockstep, or as low
as minus 1 when they go in exactly opposite directions.  The Dollar Index fell 0.5 percent yesterday after ending
last week at 84.252, its highest close since July 2010. Through
yesterday, the index was 5.1 percent higher for the year. The
 S&P 500  had climbed 17 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
