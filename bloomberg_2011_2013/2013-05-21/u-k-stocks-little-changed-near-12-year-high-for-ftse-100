U.K. stocks  climbed to a 13-year high
as mining companies and retailers rallied and as Federal Reserve
Bank of St. Louis President  James Bullard  said the U.S. central
bank should continue its bond-buying program.  Antofagasta Plc (ANTO)  and Glencore Xstrata Plc both advanced more
than 3 percent, leading a  gauge of metal producers  higher.
 Burberry Group Plc (BRBY)  and  Marks & Spencer Group Plc (MKS)  gained at least
5 percent after the retailers reported earnings that topped
analyst estimates.  Carnival Corp. (CCL)  dropped 5.9 percent after the
world’s largest cruise operator cut its profit forecast.  The FTSE 100 rose 48.24 points, or 0.7 percent, to 6,803.87
at the close in London, its highest level since Dec. 30, 1999.
The gauge has  gained 15 percent  so far this year, boosted by
central-bank stimulus. The broader FTSE All-Share Index also
added 0.7 percent today for its eighth straight record, while
Ireland’s ISEQ Index fell less than 0.1 percent today.  “It’s a sweet spot for equity markets because monetary
policy is still very easy and is set to remain so,” said Thomas Moore, who manages about 150 million pounds ($228 million) as
investment director at Standard Life Investments Ltd in
Edinburgh. “I don’t see tapering as a threat, I see it as just
passing the baton from monetary policy to real economic
recovery. Signs of economic recovery are still tentative.”  U.S. Outlook  Bullard, speaking in  Frankfurt  as European equity markets
closed, said the Fed should continue its bond purchases because
markets indicate they are improving financial conditions. The
program can be adjusted based on how the economy changes, said
Bullard, who votes on the policy-setting  Federal Open Market
Committee  this year.  Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  will testify on
the outlook for the  U.S. economy  before the Joint Economic
Committee of Congress tomorrow. The Federal Open Market
Committee will also release the minutes of its April 30-May 1
meeting. Policy makers said after their last meeting that they
will keep buying $85 billion of bonds every month, while
standing ready to raise or lower purchases as conditions evolve.  The  Bank of England  will release tomorrow minutes showing
how officials voted at its May 9 policy meeting. The nine-member
Monetary Policy Committee kept the target for asset purchases
unchanged at 375 billion pounds and its key  interest rate  at a
record low of 0.5 percent.  The volume of shares changing hands in companies on the
 FTSE 100 (UKX)  was 8.8 percent greater than the average of the past 30
days, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Commodity Producers  A gauge of London-listed mining stocks gained 3.2 percent,
its sharpest increase since May 3, as copper advanced for a
fourth day. Antofagasta added 4.1 percent to 964 pence, Glencore
Xstrata rose 3.3 percent to 346 pence and Anglo American Plc
climbed 4.4 percent to 1,621.5 pence.  Burberry advanced 5.3 percent to 1,541 pence, its highest
price in a year, after the U.K.’s largest luxury-goods maker
reported a 14 percent increase in adjusted full year pretax
profit to 427.8 million pounds. That beat the 417.5 million-pound median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey.  The retailer also announced  a dividend  of 29 pence a share,
higher than the 27.8 pence average projection.  Marks and Spencer rallied 6.2 percent to 467.9 pence, its
highest price since January 2008. The U.K.’s largest clothing
retailer reported a 5.8 percent decline in so-called underlying
profit before tax to 665.2 million pounds. That still beat the
663.3 million-pound estimate of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Homeserve, Carnival  Homeserve Plc (HSV)  rallied 10 percent to 250.2 pence, its
biggest increase in six months, after the the repair-service
provider said it’s confident it will return to “modest growth”
in 2015 and set aside 6 million pounds for costs related to an
investigation from the Financial Conduct Authority. Panmure
Gordon & Co. upgraded the shares to hold, saying the FCA
provision removed a major uncertainty for the company.  Carnival dropped 5.9 percent to 2,267 pence in London, the
biggest slide in five months, after the company lowered its
earnings forecast. Full-year profit will be $1.45 to $1.65 a
share, down from a previous forecast of $1.80 to $2.10. Carnival
said that lower ticket prices will hurt margins after a series
of incidents at sea prompted the company to cut fares to fill
cabins.  Bwin.Party Digital Entertainment Plc lost 2.9 percent to
139.2 pence after the online-betting company posted a 17 percent
drop in first-quarter revenue to 180 million euros ($232
million).  To contact the reporters on this story:
