Georgia  arrested ex-Prime Minister
Vano Merabishvili for alleged embezzlement and misuse of public
funds, the latest ally of President Mikheil Saakashvili to be
detained since elections brought about a change of government.  Merabishvili, who’s also served as interior minister and
led a revamp of the police, was arrested today along with former
Health Minister Zurab Tchiaberashvili, who’s now governor of the
Kakheti region, according to an e-mailed statement from the
Prosecutor’s Office. Other charges may follow, the office said.  Saakashvili’s party was unexpectedly defeated by
billionaire Bidzina Ivanishvili’s Georgian Dream coalition in
elections last October. The tycoon, now prime minister, has
since faced criticism from the European Union and U.S. after
police arrested officials from the former administration
including ex-Interior and Defense Minister Bacho Akhalaia.  Davit Bakradze, a lawmaker from the president’s party,
called the allegations “pathetic” in a televised speech on the
Rustavi 2 channel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
