Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s  bonds  have lost $280.6
million of market value since buyers snapped up $17 billion of
the iPhone maker’s debt last month, declining as yields climb
from record lows.  The  iPhone maker ’s $3 billion of 30-year, 3.85 percent
bonds, issued at 99.418 cents on the dollar, dropped 4.3 cents
through yesterday to 95.145 cents on the dollar since the April
30 offering, creating a loss of $128.2 million and pushing the
yield on the bonds to 4.1 percent, according to data from Trace,
the bond-price reporting system of the Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority.  Buyers of the biggest corporate-bond offering ever are
losing as speculation the  Federal Reserve  may start scaling back
its unprecedented stimulus efforts triggers the biggest increase
in 10-year Treasury yields in 12 months. Average yields on
dollar-denominated investment-grade bonds have climbed to 2.78
percent from 2.68 percent since Apple’s April 30 debt sale, the
Bank of America Merrill Lynch U.S. Corporate Index shows.  The company’s $5.5 billion of senior unsecured 2.4 percent
notes due in 2023, which were issued at 99.867 cents on the
dollar, have sunk to 97.377 cents through yesterday, Trace data
show. That implies a loss of $137 million from issuance,
Bloomberg data show. The yield climbed to 2.7 percent and the
extra yield investors demand to hold the debt instead of
similar-maturity Treasuries widened to 76.5 basis points from 75
at issuance.  The only bonds sold last month by Apple that gained were
those that pay floating-rate coupons. The securities have
increased $6.7 million in market value since the offering,
Bloomberg data show.  Apple’s $2 billion of floating-rate securities due in May
2018, which pay 25 basis points more than the London interbank
offered rate, climbed 0.3 cent to 100.3 cents on the dollar from
their issuance price, Trace data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
