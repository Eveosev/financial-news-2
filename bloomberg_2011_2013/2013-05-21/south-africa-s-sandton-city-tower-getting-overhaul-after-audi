The Sandton City Office Tower, which
rises above the Southern Hemisphere’s largest mall in
Johannesburg, will undergo preventive maintenance following an
independent audit by two structural engineering firms.  The 20-story building, opened four decades ago, will go
through 18 months of upgrades, including new electrical and
mechanical works, according to  Liberty Holdings Ltd. (LBH) , which owns
75 percent of the building.  “The reports found that the building is structurally
sound,” Maurice Mdlolo, chief operating officer at Liberty said
by e-mail. “However, given the age of the building, routine
restorative and preventative maintenance was recommended.”  The tower is connected to Nelson Mandela Square in South
Africa’s commercial capital and is home to about 290 stores,
including luxury brands like Kurt Geiger, Louis Vuitton and
Montblanc. In 2012, the mall partially flooded, causing the
closure of  Nike Inc. (NKE)  and Haagen Dazs outlets and a distributor
of Apple Inc. products. The building also houses the offices of
Bloomberg News.  To contact the reporter on this story:
