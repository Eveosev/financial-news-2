Public spending per student on U.S.
education fell in fiscal 2011, the first annual decline since at
least 1977, as  tax revenue  dried up.  The U.S. spent an average $10,560 per student in public
schools in 2011, down 0.4 percent from 2010, the  Census Bureau 
said today. It calculated the spending of all 15,345 U.S. public
school systems. Total school spending was $595.1 billion, down
1.1 percent.  Most school systems are funded through state and local
property taxes, and tax collections fell 2 percent from the
third quarter of 2010 through the third quarter of 2011,
according to census data. The decline in per-student school
spending is the first since the Census records began in 1977.  Illinois had a 7.4 percent decline in per pupil spending,
the largest drop in the U.S., followed by Maine’s 6.7 percent
decline and  New Jersey ’s 5.2 percent. The biggest increase in
spending was in New Hampshire, where it climbed 6.8 percent per
student, followed by 5.6 percent in Alaska and 4.7 percent in
Connecticut.  New York  spent $19,076 per student, the most of any state,
followed by the  District of Columbia  with $18,475, Alaska with
$16,674, New Jersey with $15,968 and Vermont with $15,925. The
New York City School District, the largest in the country with
995,336 pupils, spent $19,770 per student, the most among the
100 largest school districts and almost twice as much as the
$10,804 spent by the  Los Angeles Unified School District , the
second largest.  To contact the reporter on this story:
