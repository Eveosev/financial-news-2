Saudi Arabia arrested 10 people,
including eight Saudi nationals, it says were spying for Iran,
the official  Saudi Press Agency  said, citing an unidentified
Interior Ministry spokesman.  A Lebanese and Turkish national were also detained, the
Riyadh-based news service said. The arrests were linked to the
discovery in March of an Iranian spy ring by Saudi authorities,
SPA said.  The six-country Gulf Cooperation Council has accused
Shiite-led Iran of interfering in the internal affairs of Arab
countries in the Persian Gulf, home to three-fifths of the
world’s oil reserves.  Saudi Arabia in November submitted a letter to the United
Nations stating that Iranian aircraft strayed over the kingdom’s
territorial waters near oil and gas fields, Okaz newspaper said,
citing Abdallah al-Mouallimi, the Saudi ambassador to the UN.  Saudi Arabian authorities arrested 18 people, including 16
of its nationals, for gathering material “for the benefit of a
foreign country,” SPA reported on March 19. A week later, the
government said the spy cell received Iranian funds in exchange
for “important documents.”  Iran  has denied the allegations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
