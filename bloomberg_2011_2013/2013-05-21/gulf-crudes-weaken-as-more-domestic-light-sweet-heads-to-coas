Gulf Coast crudes weakened on the
spot market as increasing supplies of light, sweet domestic oils
made their way to Texas refineries.  Magellan Midstream Partners LP (MMP) ’s Longhorn pipeline began
shipping as much as 75,000 barrels a day to Houston from West
Texas in mid-April and expects to reach 225,000 in the third
quarter.  Sunoco Logistics Partners LP (SXL) ’s Permian Express pipeline
to the Gulf from West Texas is scheduled to start transporting
90,000 barrels a day next month.  Light Louisiana Sweet oil weakened by $1.05 to a $9.55
premium to West Texas Intermediate oil as of 2:09 p.m. New York
time, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Heavy Louisiana
Sweet’s premium shrank by 90 cents to $8.80.  “The expectation that more light sweet is going to be
moving to the Gulf Coast is becoming a reality, with Longhorn
online and the Permian Express coming right behind it,”  Andrew
Lebow , a senior vice president at Jefferies Bache LLC, said in a
phone interview from New York.  The new pipelines have been built to carry light oil from
shale basins unlocked by horizontal fracturing drilling
technology.  Texas oil production  increased 28 percent to 2.3
million barrels a day in the 12 months ended Feb. 28, according
to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.  Other Gulf Coast oils also weakened. Southern Green Canyon
lost 50 cents a barrel to a $1.50 premium over WTI. Poseidon’s
premium fell $1.60 to $3.25. Mars Blend fell $1.10 to a premium
of $3.50. Thunder Horse slipped 75 cents to a premium of $6.25.  In  Canada , grades were unchanged with no trades outside of
the index period, according to Calgary oil broker Net Energy
Inc. Western Canada Select last traded May 17 at a $21 discount
to WTI, while Syncrude was unchanged at a 25-cent discount. The
majority of the trading volume for June Canadian crude shipments
occurred from May 1 to May 16, when the average price for next
month’s delivery was set.  To contact the reporter on this story:
