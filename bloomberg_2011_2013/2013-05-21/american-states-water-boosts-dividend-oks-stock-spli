American States Water Co. (AWR) , a
California-based water service and electricity provider,
approved a 14 percent increase to its quarterly dividend and
plans a two-for-one stock split.  The third-quarter dividend will rise to 40.5 cents a share
from 35.5 cents payable on Sept. 3, the San Dimas-based utility
said today in a statement. The higher dividend will be applied
prior to the Aug. 15 stock split, when holders of each share
will get an additional share, the company said.  American States Water is the parent of Golden State Water
and American States Utility Services. Its  shares  have increased
48 percent over the past year to $54.42.  To contact the reporter on this story:
