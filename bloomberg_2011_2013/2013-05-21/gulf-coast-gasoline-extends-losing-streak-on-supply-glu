U.S.  Gulf Coast  gasoline weakened for
a fifth day, falling to the lowest level versus futures in six
weeks, on speculation that refinery  run rates  are contributing
to a glut.  Refiners on the U.S. Gulf Coast, referred to as PADD 3,
processed  8.41 million barrels a day  of crude and other
feedstock in the week ended May 10, the highest level since Dec.
14, according to U.S. Energy Information Administration data.
Stockpiles of motor fuel were  74.4 million  barrels during the
same time period, the data showed.  “It seems like there is a big supply glut,” Carl Larry,
Houston-based president of Oil Outlooks & Opinions LLC, said in
an electronic message.  Conventional, 85-octane gasoline, or CBOB, on the Gulf
Coast fell 2.5 cents to a discount of  24.75 cents  a gallon
versus New York Mercantile Exchange futures at 2:08 p.m., the
lowest level since April 5, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Reformulated, 84-octane gasoline, or RBOB, fell 2
cents to 2.75 cents below futures.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel  advanced 0.5 cent to a discount of
4.75 cents to Nymex futures.  Valero Energy Corp. (VLO) ’s 145,000-barrel-a-day Houston refinery
reported flaring today after an issue with a fluid catalytic
cracker,  Bill Day , a company spokesman based in  San Antonio ,
said in an e-mail. Production wasn’t affected, he said.  The  3-2-1 crack spread  on the Gulf Coast, a rough measure
of refining margins based on West Texas Intermediate in Cushing,
 Oklahoma , slipped $1.71 to $19.80 a barrel. The same spread for
Light Louisiana Sweet oil dropped $1.60 to $7.52 a barrel, a
fifth consecutive decline.  The 3-2-1 crack spread in New York, measured using
benchmark Brent oil in  Europe , narrowed 43 cents to $17.67 a
barrel. Reformulated, 87-octane gasoline, or RBOB in the region,
strengthened 0.02 cent to a discount of 0.23 cent a gallon.
Ultra-low-sulfur diesel fuel also advanced, increasing 0.1 cent
to 0.1 cent a gallon.  To contact the reporter on this story:
