Indian (SENSEX)  stock-index futures swung
between gains and losses in Singapore as foreign funds capped
the biggest weekly purchase of the nation’s shares since
February.  SGX CNX Nifty Index futures  for May delivery was unchanged
at 6,170 at 10:17 a.m. in Singapore. The underlying CNX  Nifty (NIFTY) 
Index lost 0.5 percent to 6,156.90 yesterday, after closing on
May 17 at its highest level since Nov. 11, 2010. The S&P BSE
Sensex slid 0.3 percent, the first loss in five days. The Bank
of  New York  Mellon  India  ADR Index of U.S.-traded shares
declined 0.9 percent.  Overseas investors bought the most Indian stocks in 14
weeks in the five days through May 17, extending this year’s
record equity  purchases  amid easing by central banks from India
to  Europe . U.S. Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  will testify on the
economic outlook before the Joint Economic Committee of Congress
tomorrow amid speculation the central bank may taper its $85
billion in monthly purchases of securities.  “The amount of money that has come into India puts us in a
precarious situation ahead of the Fed event,” Sharmila Joshi,
head of institutional and corporate sales and research at
Peerless Securities Ltd., told Bloomberg TV India yesterday.
“It’s good to be a little cautious and light on the markets
before the event.”  Earnings Estimates  Foreign funds bought a net $172.9 million of Indian stocks
on May 17, taking this year’s net investment to $13.5 billion, a
record for the period, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Overseas investors purchased a net $878 million of shares in the
week ended May 17.  The Sensex has rebounded 11 percent since sinking to a
seven-month low on April 9 and trades at 13.9 times  projected
12-month profits , near the highest level in seven months. That
compares with the MSCI  Emerging Markets  Index’s 10.7 times.  Profit at just two of the 17 Sensex companies that have
reported March-quarter results so far has  trailed  analyst
estimates, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Net income at about
43 percent of the 30 index companies missed forecasts in the
three months ended Dec. 31, compared with 40 percent in the
previous two quarters.  To contact the reporter on this story:
