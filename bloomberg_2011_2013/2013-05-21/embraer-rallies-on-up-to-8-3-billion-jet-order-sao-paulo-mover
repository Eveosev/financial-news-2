Embraer SA (EMBR3)  rose the most among the
world’s largest  airplane manufacturers  after an agreement to
sell as many as 200 planes for as much as $8.3 billion to
 SkyWest Inc. (SKYW)   Shares advanced 2.6 percent to 19.39 reais at 10:58 a.m. in
Sao Paulo. A close at that price would be the highest since
February 2008. Embraer was the best performer on the  Ibovespa (IBOV) 
stock benchmark, which dropped 0.2 percent.  Today’s advance extends Embraer’s gain this year to 35
percent while the Ibovespa has declined 8.9 percent during the
same period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
