Most Brazilian stocks  dropped  as a
report forecast to show that job growth stalled last month added
to concern that the recovery in  Latin America ’s biggest economy
is faltering.  Gafisa SA (GFSA3)  led losses by homebuilders, and  Banco Santander
Brasil SA (SANB11)  was the worst performer among banks. Planemaker
 Embraer SA (EMBR3)  rallied after saying it received an order for jets
that could be worth as much as $8.3 billion.  The Ibovespa was little changed at 55,697.41 at 12:47 p.m.
in Sao Paulo. Thirty-seven stocks dropped on the index while 32
climbed. The real added 0.1 percent to 2.0365 per dollar.
Brazil’s Labor Ministry will report today that the nation added
210,000 government-registered jobs in April, according to the
median forecast of 15 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. That
 compares  with 216,974 jobs added a year earlier.  “We hear government officials saying that growth will
speed up in the second half of the year, but we can’t be sure
that this will happen,” Marc Sauerman, who helps oversee 650
million reais at Curitiba, Brazil-based J. Malucelli
Investimentos, said in a telephone interview. “There are too
many uncertainties.”  Gafisa fell 0.8 percent to 3.75 reais. Santander Brasil
lost 1 percent to 14.90 reais. Embraer rose 1.9 percent to 19.25
reais after saying in a regulatory filing that SkyWest Inc.
agreed to buy as many as 200 jets. Shares earlier jumped as much
as 4.8 percent.  HRT Plunges  Oil company  HRT Participacoes em Petroleo SA  plunged 19
percent to a record low 2.67 reais after saying in a regulatory
filing that a well drilled in  Brazil ’s Solimoes basin is dry and
another in  Namibia  has no commercial volume of crude.  The Ibovespa has declined 8.6 percent this year, the worst
performer after  Colombia ’s IGBC index among 19 major  emerging
markets , data compiled by Bloomberg show. Brazil’s benchmark
equity index  trades  at 12.3 times analysts’ earnings estimates
for the next four quarters, compared with a multiple of 10.9 for
the MSCI Emerging Markets Index of 21 developing nations’
equities, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Trading volume for stocks in Sao Paulo was 10.7 billion
reais yesterday, compared with a daily average of 7.71 billion
reais this year through May 17, according to data compiled by
the exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
