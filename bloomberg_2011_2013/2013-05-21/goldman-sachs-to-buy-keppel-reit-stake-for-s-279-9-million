(Corrects story published May 21 to show Goldman is acting
as placement agent in second paragraph.)  Keppel (KREIT)  Corp., the world’s largest
oil-rig maker, said its subsidiary has placed a 6.7 percent
stake worth S$279.9 million ($223 million) with Goldman Sachs
Group Inc.  Goldman Sachs (Singapore) Pte, which is acting as the
placement agent, will purchase 180 million units of the real
estate investment trust for S$1.555 per unit, according to a
statement to the Singapore stock exchange yesterday.  Prime-office rents in Singapore may climb 13 percent per
annum in the two years to 2016, according to a May 3 report by
Standard Chartered Plc. Keppel REIT is the largest landlord of
office assets in the island city, the bank said.  Keppel REIT owns the highest-quality office portfolio among
office SREITs,  Standard Chartered ’s analysts Kai Yip and Regina
Lim wrote in the note. Prime-office buildings, such as Ocean
Financial Centre, One Raffles Quay and Marina Bay Financial
Centre Towers 1 and 2, make up 80 percent of its portfolio’s
2.37 million square feet (220,180 square meters) of net leasable
area, according to the note.  With the sale, Keppel Corp. will cut its stake in the REIT
to 51.5 percent, according to the statement. The sale will be
completed by May 27, the company said.  Keppel REIT shares dropped as much as 3.4 percent to
S$1.550, and traded at S$1.555 at 9:02 a.m. local time, heading
for the biggest drop since July 20. The trust has gained 20
percent this year compared with the 13 percent advance in the
