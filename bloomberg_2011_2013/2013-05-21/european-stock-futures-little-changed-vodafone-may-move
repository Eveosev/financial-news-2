European stocks  erased losses in the
final minutes of trading as Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis
President  James Bullard  said the U.S. central bank should
continue its bond-buying program.  Marks & Spencer Group Plc rallied the most in two months
after saying it will reduce  capital spending  to boost profit
margins. Burberry Group Plc climbed to a one-year high as the
U.K.’s largest luxury-goods maker reported earnings that beat
estimates. Carnival Corp., the world’s largest cruise operator,
slid the most this year after cutting its forecasts.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index rose less than 0.1 percent to
309.99 at the close, having earlier lost as much as 0.7 percent.
The gauge has  rallied  96 percent since March 2009 as European
Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  pledged to preserve the euro
and the Fed embarked on three rounds of stimulus. The equity
benchmark has climbed to the highest level since June 2008 and
is on course for a 12th straight month of gains, the longest
winning streak since 1997.  Investors want to “know when the quantitative easing will
run its course,”  Tim Harris , who oversees about $25 billion as
chief investment officer at Lloyds TSB Private Banking in
London, said on Bloomberg Television before Bullard’s comments.
“Not too hot and not too cold is what we’ll be hoping for from
the Fed. It’s language as much as anything else that markets
will be looking for.”  Bond Buying  Bullard, speaking in  Frankfurt  as European equity markets
closed, said the Fed should continue its bond purchases because
markets indicate they are improving financial conditions. The
program can be adjusted based on how the economy changes, said
Bullard, who votes on the policy-setting  Federal Open Market
Committee  this year.  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  will discuss the economic
outlook in congressional testimony tomorrow, as the bank also
publishes minutes of its last policy meeting.  National benchmark indexes increased in 11 of the 18
western European markets.  France ’s CAC 40 rose 0.3 percent and
 Germany ’s DAX advanced 0.2 percent. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 climbed
0.7 percent to the highest close since 1999.  Greece ’s  ASE Index (ASE)  retreated 4 percent today, pulled down
by shares of lenders. National Bank of Greece SA tumbled 27
percent to 1.15 euros after announcing details of a share sale.
Piraeus Bank SA slid 21 percent to 36 euro cents.  M&S Gains  Marks & Spencer advanced 6.2 percent to 467.9 pence, the
highest since January 2008. The U.K.’s biggest clothing retailer
said it will reduce capital spending to 775 million pounds ($1.2
billion) this year and 550 million pounds next year.  Burberry jumped 5.3 percent to 1,541 pence, the highest
since April 2012. The company reported full-year profit that
beat estimates, boosted by strong demand in  China  and  Hong Kong ,
and increased the dividend by more than analysts expected.  Capita Plc rallied 5.9 percent to 1,005 pence, the highest
price since at least 1989, as the company said Telefonica SA’s
O2 mobile-phone unit selected it as the preferred bidder for a
10-year customer-services contract worth about 1.2 billion
pounds. The provider of criminal-records services for the U.K.
Home Office raised its forecast for so-called organic-revenue
growth in 2013.  A gauge of mining shares was the best performer among the
19  industry groups  in the Stoxx 600, rising 2.3 percent.  BHP Billiton Ltd., the world’s biggest mining company,
advanced 3 percent to 1,982 pence. Rio Tinto Group, the second-largest, climbed 2.6 percent to 2,979 pence. Polymetal
International Plc, Russian gold and silver producer, jumped 8.4
percent to 669 pence for the biggest gain since the shares
started trading in  London  in 2011.  Carnival Drops  Carnival dropped 5.9 percent to 2,267 pence in London after
the cruise operator lowered its profit forecast for the second
half of 2013, saying price cuts undertaken after a series of
mishaps will hurt margins.  Sonova Holding AG, the world’s largest maker of hearing
aids, retreated 1,1 percent to 103.50 Swiss francs after saying
profit growth will slow. Earnings before interest, taxes and
acquisition-related amortization and impairments will rise by 9
percent to 13 percent in local currencies this fiscal year,
compared with a 15 percent jump in the 12 months ended March,
the company said.  United Internet AG tumbled 7.2 percent to 21.57 euros as
the German broadband provider reported first-quarter sales of
629.7 million euros ($810 million),  trailing  the average analyst
forecast of 635 million euros. The shares had climbed 23 percent
this quarter before today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
