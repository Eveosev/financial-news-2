Serbia’s current-account deficit
narrowed 47.7 percent in the first quarter as exports continued
to expand and foreign investments and remittances picked up.  The three-month gap of 615.2 million euros ($790.4 million)
shrank from 1.17 billion euros a year earlier, according to the
balance of payments report published by the Belgrade-based
Narodna Banka Srbije today.  Exports grew 22.2 percent and imports 0.2 percent in the
first three months from a year earlier. Remittances jumped 26.8
percent to a three-month total of 469.6 million euros and net
foreign direct investments rose to 155.3 million euros, compared
with three-month outflows of 361.6 million euros in the first
quarter of 2012.  On a monthly basis, the deficit more than doubled to 324.2
million euros in March from a revised 115 million euros in
February, the data published on the bank’s website show.  Serbia last had a sharp contraction in its current-account
deficit in 2009, when the collapse Lehman Brothers Inc. sparked
a global economic crisis. The deficit narrowed 73 percent on
year in 2009 when the economy contracted 3.5 percent and the
dinar weakened 7.3 percent against the euro. It fell 1.2 percent
in 2010 along with economic growth of 1 percent, while the dinar
depreciated 9.4 percent.  The central bank sees the gap below 8 percent of GDP in
2013, down from 10.7 percent or 3.15 billion euros in 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
