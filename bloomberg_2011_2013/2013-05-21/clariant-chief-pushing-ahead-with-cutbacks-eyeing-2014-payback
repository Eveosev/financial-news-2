Clariant AG (CLN)  will begin making cuts in
support services such as administration and human resources in
the coming months, Chief Executive Officer Hariolf Kottmann said
in a letter to employees.  “We will shortly begin implementing specific projects,
which will be directed by the Executive Committee,” Kottmann
wrote in the letter, saying that Clariant will see the benefits
of the measures in 2014.  “We will only succeed in avoiding remnant costs and
reducing corporate costs if we intensify our efforts,” the CEO
added.  Clariant is nearing the end of a revamp which will see it
exit five commodity chemicals units making up one-fifth of sales
to focus on more profitable care chemicals and catalyst
businesses. In a next phase, Kottmann is turning to finetuning
and lowering costs in areas such as human resources to reflect
the scaled back size of the company.  Kottmann also pledged to cut costs such as fees paid to
advisers associated with restructuring.  Clariant spokesman Kai Rolker declined to comment on how
the corporate and remnant cost cuts will affect headcount. The
measures do not constitute a corporate restructuring program and
Clariant has no announcement about job cuts planned, he added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
