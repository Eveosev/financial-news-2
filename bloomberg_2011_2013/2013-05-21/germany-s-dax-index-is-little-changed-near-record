German stocks  rose for an 11th day,
their longest winning streak since July 2005, as Federal Reserve
Bank of St. Louis President  James Bullard  said the central bank
should continue its bond buying program.  Bayer AG (BAYN)  and BASF SE gained, following their European peers
higher.  Commerzbank AG (CBK) , the country’s second-biggest lender,
slid 3.7 percent.  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  dropped the most in more than
a month after JPMorgan Chase & Co. downgraded the shares.  The  DAX (DAX)  climbed 0.2 percent to a record 8,472.2 at the
close in  Frankfurt . The benchmark gauge has rallied 11 percent
this year as central banks around the world maintained monetary
stimulus. The broader HDAX Index also rose 0.2 percent today.  The Fed’s bond-purchasing plan, known as quantitative
easing, should be maintained because markets indicate that it is
improving financial conditions and can be adjusted based on how
the economy changes, Bullard, who votes on the policy-setting
 Federal Open Market Committee  this year, said in Frankfurt as
European equity markets closed.  Bayer, the maker of drugs and agricultural chemicals, added
0.6 percent to 84.65 euros after saying its experimental
riociguat pill for hypertension produced positive data from a
patent-2 trial. Shares earlier rose as much as 1.4 percent.  BASF, the world’s biggest chemical maker, advanced 1.9
percent to 75.35 euros.  A measure of chemical stocks rose the most since May 10 on
the Stoxx  Europe  600 Index.  Wacker Chemie AG (WCH) , the fourth-largest producer of
polysilicon, jumped 9 percent to 56.22 euros, its largest
increase since December.  Banks Decline  Commerzbank slumped 3.7 percent to 8.18 euros, for the
biggest loss on the benchmark index.  Deutsche Bank dropped 2.3 percent to 36.66 euros after
JPMorgan downgraded its rating on the shares to neutral from
overweight, saying tighter Basel Committee regulations threaten
the lender’s capital levels.  Daimler AG (DAI) , the world’s third-largest maker of luxury cars,
lost 1.4 percent to 49.65 euros, falling for the first time in
seven days.  Volkswagen AG (VOW) , Europe’s biggest automaker, slipped
1.3 percent to 171.60 euros.  United Internet AG retreated 7.2 percent to 21.57 euros,
its biggest decline since December. The German broadband
provider reported first-quarter sales of 630 million euros ($811
million), missing analyst forecasts for 635 million euros.  The volume of shares changing hands on DAX-listed companies
was 0.8 percent lower than the average of the past 30 days, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
