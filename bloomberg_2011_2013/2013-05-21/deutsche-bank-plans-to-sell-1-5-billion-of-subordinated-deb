Deutsche Bank AG (DB)  sold $1.5 billion of
subordinated, dollar-denominated debt.  Continental  Europe ’s biggest bank issued 15-year, 4.296
percent notes that yield 237.5 basis points more than similar-maturity Treasuries, according to a regulatory  filing . The debt
is callable on May 24, 2023, when the coupon resets to 224.75
basis points more than the five-year mid-swap rate, the filing
said. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  Proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes and to
strengthen the Frankfurt-based lender’s regulatory capital base,
according to a company filing.  The new notes may be rated Baa3 by Moody’s Investors
Service, said a person with knowledge of the offering who asked
not to be identified because terms weren’t set at the time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
