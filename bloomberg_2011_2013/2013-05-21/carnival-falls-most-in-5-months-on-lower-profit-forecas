Carnival Corp. (CCL)  fell the most in five
months after the world’s largest cruise operator lowered its
forecast for the rest of the year, saying price cuts undertaken
following a series of mishaps will hurt margins.  Carnival  dropped  4.3 percent to $33.81 at the close in New
York, the most since Dec. 20, after delivering the lower view
for the second half of 2013 yesterday. The shares have fallen
8.1 percent this year while the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index has
 added  17 percent. Competitor  Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. (RCL) , also
based in Miami, fell 2.4 percent to $36.89.  The lower forecast demonstrates continuing fallout from
several incidents at sea that attracted news coverage of Miami-based Carnival. They included an engine-room fire on the Triumph
in February that left 3,100 passengers with limited food and
toilet service for several days.  Full-year profit will total $1.45 to $1.65 a share,
Carnival said yesterday in a statement. That’s down from a
previous forecast of $1.80 to $2.10. Analysts were projecting
$1.99, the average of 27 estimates  compiled  by Bloomberg.  The company began cutting prices to fill cabins, dropping
the fare for some trips in April to as little as $38 a night per
person. While bookings increased, the amount of revenue captured
from each customer has declined, Carnival said yesterday.
Cancellations were also higher than expected, the company said.  Higher fuel and marketing costs, as well as less-favorable
exchange rates, will also crimp profit, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
