China’s proposed ban on lower-quality
coal imports is likely to boost domestic benchmark prices by as
much as 8 percent as supplies drop, according to Fenwei Energy
Consulting Corp.  Spot cargoes at the port of Qinhuangdao, a benchmark for
the nation’s power station coal, may increase by as much as 50
 yuan  ($8) per metric ton, Luther Lu, a chief market analyst at
the consultancy in Taiyuan, said by phone yesterday. Domestic
 power plants  may buy more coal from Newcastle in  Australia  or
 South Africa  if prices rise, he said.  China is considering a ban on imports of some lower-quality
thermal coal grades, the Economic Information Daily reported May
16, citing an announcement at a conference held by the National
Development and Reform Commission and the NEA this month. Nobody
answered three calls and a fax to the NEA’s press office in
Beijing today.  “Such draft regulation, if carried out, will ban China
from getting at least 60 million to 70 million tons of coal
imports, mostly lignite,” said Lu.  The benchmark price of Qinhuangdao coal with energy value
of 5,500 kcal/kg was at 605 to 615 yuan a ton as of May 19,
unchanged from a week earlier, according to data from the China
Coal Transport and Distribution Association yesterday. The price
has been unchanged in the past three weeks after dropping on
April 21 to the lowest since October 2009, data compiled by
Bloomberg shows.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
