Imports of refined  copper  by  China ,
the biggest user, declined in April to the lowest level since
June 2011, while exports fell for the first time in eight months.  Inbound shipments were 183,023 metric tons last month, data
from the General Administration of Customs showed today. That
compared with 218,823 tons in March and 272,903 tons a year ago,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Exports tumbled 52
percent to 29,072 tons from 60,642 tons a month earlier, the
data showed.  The drop in arrivals has helped draw down  inventories 
tallied by the  Shanghai  Futures Exchange, which were at the
lowest level in seven months last week. Imports may find support
in coming months as arbitrage trade by buying the metal in
 London  and selling in Shanghai has become more profitable, while
exports may be curbed for the same reason.  “In a relatively normal liquidity environment, the
arbitrage ratio is still the main factor in deciding imports and
exports,” Liang Lijuan, an analyst at Cofco Futures Co., said
by phone from Beijing. “I expect imports to gain in coming
months, as exports may be curbed.”  Metal for delivery in September on the SHFE rose 1.7
percent to close at 53,420  yuan  ($8,713) a ton, $43 higher than
the three-month contract on the London Metal Exchange at $7,410
a ton, including a 17 percent value-added tax.  The pick-up in copper demand in the second quarter may turn
out to be little more than an opportunistic buying spree by
under-stocked fabricators in China and won’t last into the
summer, Standard Bank Plc said in its monthly research report on
base metals on May 17.  Copper-concentrate  imports  by China surged to 842,838 tons
last month, according to customs. That compared with 777,838
tons in March and 474,903 tons a year earlier. Total arrivals in
the first four months this year jumped 37 percent to 3.06
million tons, the data showed.  Scrap-copper imports fell 9 percent from a year ago to
336,634 tons in April, and inbound shipments in the January-to-April period dropped 4.7 percent to 1.37 million tons. Imports
from the U.S. declined 13 percent in April to 72,413 tons,
according to today’s data.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
