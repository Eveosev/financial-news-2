Steel reinforcement-bar futures
dropped for the second day as increasing output and cheaper  iron
ore  prices outweighed a reduction in inventories.  Rebar for delivery in October on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange fell 1 percent to 3,570  yuan  ($582) a metric ton by
11:20 a.m. local time. The most active contract has lost 10
percent this year.  Rebar inventory in  China  tracked by Shanghai Steelhome
Information Technology Co. fell to 8.64 million tons on May 17,
the sixth weekly decline and the lowest level since Feb. 8.  “There are both positive and negative signs in the market,
with declining inventory a good sign for demand while rising
output and lower iron ore prices weighing on rebar prices,”
Wang Yongliang, analyst at Beijing CIFCO Futures Co., said by
phone from Tianjin today.  Iron ore  with 62 percent iron content for immediate
delivery to the Tianjin port in China was little changed at $123
a yesterday, the lowest since Dec. 7, according to an index
compiled by The Steel Index Ltd.  China’s daily crude steel output nationwide in early May
was estimated to rise 3 percent to 2.19 million tons, compared
with daily output in late-April, according to Custeel.com
analyst Hu Yanping on May 17, citing data from the China Iron &
Steel Association.  The average  spot price  for rebar was little changed at
3,559 yuan a ton yesterday, according to Beijing Antaike
