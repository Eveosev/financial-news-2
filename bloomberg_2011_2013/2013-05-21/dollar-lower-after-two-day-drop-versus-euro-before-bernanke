The dollar rose against most major
counterparts as Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said
the central bank could taper its monthly bond purchases at its
next few meetings if it can be confident of sustained gains in
the economy.  The greenback earlier touched a one-week low versus the
euro as Bernanke told Congress the  U.S. economy  remains hampered
by high unemployment and government spending cuts, and
tightening policy too soon would endanger the recovery. The yen
slid against the dollar and euro after the  Bank of Japan 
affirmed a plan to double the monetary base over two years and
its statement showed no concern about rising bond yields.  Bernanke’s comment “is what the U.S. dollar bulls will
latch onto,” said Brad Bechtel, managing director at Faros
Trading LLC in  Stamford ,  Connecticut .  The dollar gained 0.2 percent to $1.2886 per euro at 11:09
a.m. in New York after falling earlier to $1.2998, the weakest
level since May 14. The yen slid 0.8 percent to 133.32 per euro
and reached 133.80, the least since January 2010. Against the
dollar, the yen declined 0.9 percent to 103.41 and touched
103.61, the weakest since October 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
