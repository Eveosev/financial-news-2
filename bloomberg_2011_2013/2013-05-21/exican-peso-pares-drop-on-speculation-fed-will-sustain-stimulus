Mexico ’s peso fell as concern that
growth is slowing trimmed demand for some of the nation’s
securities amid speculation the Federal Reserve will reduce
stimulus.  The currency fell 0.3 percent to 12.3355 per  U.S. dollar  at
4 p.m. in Mexico City. The peso has risen 4.2 percent in 2013,
the biggest gain among major currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  Mexican stocks plummeted today amid growing concern about a
May 17 report that showed gross domestic product rose 0.8
percent in the first quarter from a year earlier, the slowest
since the fourth quarter of 2009. The benchmark IPC index lost
1.3 percent, the biggest drop among the world’s major stock
benchmarks.  The peso briefly erased losses on remarks by St. Louis Fed
President  James Bullard . He said in the text of remarks prepared
for delivery in Frankfurt that the U.S. central bank should
continue its program of bond buying, because it’s the best
available option for policy makers to boost lower-than-expected
growth. Bullard votes on the policy-setting Federal Open Market
Committee this year.  The yield on peso bonds due in 2024 rose one basis point,
or 0.01 percentage point, to 4.77 percent, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The price fell 0.04 centavo to 146.52
centavos per peso.  To contact the reporters on this story:
