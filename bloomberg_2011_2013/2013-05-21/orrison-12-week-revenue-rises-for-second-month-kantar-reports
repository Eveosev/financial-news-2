  William Morrison Supermarkets Plc (MRW) ’s
12-week sales advanced for a second consecutive month, as the
U.K. grocer fought back from six straight periods of decline
with revamped stores and a high-profile advertising campaign.  Sales in the 12 weeks to May 12 rose 1.2 percent, following
a 0.3 percent gain in the 12 weeks to April 14, according to
researcher  Kantar Worldpanel . Morrison’s market share fell to
11.6 percent in the period ended May 12 from 11.9 percent a year
earlier.  “Although Morrisons shows a share loss, it is worth noting
that the retailer returned to growth in 2013 and continues this
upward trend in the latest period,” said Edward Garner, a
director at Kantar Worldpanel. “With its plans for online and
accelerated convenience-store coverage now in place, the
retailer will hope that successful implementation will return it
to share growth.”  Morrison last week entered into a 170 million-pound ($257.5
million) deal with online supermarket  Ocado Group plc (OCDO)  for a
belated entry to the Web grocery market in the U.K. Morrison is
also ramping up convenience-store openings to regain market
share from competitors such as Aldi and Lidl.  J Sainsbury Plc (SBRY)  was the only one of the four biggest U.K.
grocers to win market share on an annual basis, the Kantar data
showed, while Waitrose, Aldi and fellow discounter Lidl all had
record market share. Spending at Sainsbury increased 5.6 percent
in the 12-week period and market share rose to 16.8 percent from
16.5 percent a year earlier, Kantar said.  The U.K.’s largest supermarket  Tesco Plc (TSCO) ’s share fell to
30.2 percent from 30.8 percent, with sales up 1.7 percent.  Waitrose’s 12-week sales climbed 12 percent, while its
market share rose to 4.9 percent from 4.5 percent. Aldi’s
revenue jumped by 31.5 percent and market share advanced to 3.5
percent from 2.8 percent.  Market share at  Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) ’s Asda chain weakened
to 17.2 percent from 17.4 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
