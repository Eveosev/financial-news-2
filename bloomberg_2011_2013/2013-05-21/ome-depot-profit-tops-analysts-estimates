Home Depot Inc. (HD) , the largest U.S.
home-improvement retailer, posted first-quarter profit that
topped analysts’ estimates and raised its forecast for earnings
this year as the housing rebound boosts renovation spending.  Net income in the quarter ended May 5 rose 18 percent to
$1.23 billion, or 83 cents a share, from $1.04 billion, or 68
cents, a year earlier, the Atlanta-based company said today in a
statement. Analysts projected 76 cents, the  average  of 25
estimates in a Bloomberg survey.  Home Depot is benefiting from rising U.S. home prices that
are giving homeowners the confidence to start projects and spend
more. Revenue rose 7.4 percent to $19.1 billion, topping
analysts’ $18.6 billion estimate, as the average customer
purchase increased 5 percent to $57.24.  Spending rose on “consumers’ confidence to invest in
higher ticket projects,” John Tomlinson, an analyst at ITG
Investment Research in New York, said today in an e-mail. His
company doesn’t rate shares.  Profit this year will be $3.52 a share, up from a previous
estimate of $3.37, the company said today. The guidance includes
the effect of share repurchases the company already has made and
plans to make this year. Analysts estimated $3.54, on average.  Residential real-estate prices rose in February by the most
since May 2006, with the  S&P/Case-Shiller (SPCS20)  index of house values
in 20 cities up 9.3 percent from a year ago.  Home Depot  rose  2.5 percent to $78.71 at the close in New
York. The shares have advanced 27 percent this year, compared
with a 17 percent  gain  by the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  Transactions Increase  The retailer had about 337.1 million customer transactions
in the quarter, up 2.5 percent from a year earlier. Sales at
stores open longer than a year rose 4.3 percent, including a 4.8
percent gain in the U.S.  Home sales in the U.S. probably rose in April to the
highest level in more than three years, economists said before
reports this week. Combined purchases of new and existing
residences climbed to a 5.41 million annualized rate last month,
the highest since November 2009, according to the median
forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg ahead of figures
from the National Association of Realtors and the Commerce
Department.  The projected pace of total home sales last month would be
the highest since a tax credit for first-time homebuyers first
expired in November 2009. It would be the third-highest since
August 2007, four months before the start of the last recession.  Lowe’s Cos. (LOW) , the second-largest home improvement retailer,
is scheduled to report quarterly results tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
