Investors should avoid inflation-linked  government bonds  in the U.K. and the U.S. as they’re “over-hyped” and “over-owned,” according to Alan Higgins, chief investment officer at Coutts & Co. in  London .  Treasury Inflation Protected Securities are underperforming their conventional peers this year, according to indexes compiled by Bank of America Merrill Lynch. The U.K. 10-year break-even rate, an index of inflation expectations that measures the yield difference between gilts and index-linked securities, is sliding after it climbed to a 4 1/2-year high last month.  “They’re overpriced, break-evens are too high and you’ve got to buy them when inflation expectations are relatively low,” Higgins said in an interview on Bloomberg Television’s “Countdown” with  Mark Barton . “Don’t go anywhere near inflation linked.”  The U.K. 10-year  break-even rate  narrowed five basis points to 3.08 percentage points at 12:21 p.m. London time, after a report showed Britain’s inflation slowed more than economists forecast. It surged to as high as 3.39 percentage points on April 11, the most since September 2008  U.S. index-linked debt has handed investors a loss of 2.19 percent this year, the Merrill Lynch indexes show. That compares with a 0.35 percent decline in regular Treasuries. U.K. inflation-linked bonds have returned 5.61 percent in the same period.  “We’ve seen a big collapse in break-evens in the  United States , for example, which means index-linked are really underperforming conventionals,” Higgins said. “In the U.S. definitively you wanted to be in conventionals. There’s big negative returns from TIPS.”  To contact the reporter on this story: Lucy Meakin in London at  lmeakin1@bloomberg.net .
