A gauge of U.S. corporate credit risk
held before Federal Reserve ChairmanBen S. Bernanke’s
congressional testimony tomorrow on the outlook of the world’s
biggest economy.  The Markit CDX North American Investment Grade Index, a
credit-default swaps benchmark that investors use to hedge
against losses or to speculate on creditworthiness, increased
0.2 basis point to a mid-price of 71.2 basis points at 8:08 a.m.
in  New York , according to prices compiled by Bloomberg.  Investors are awaiting both Bernanke’s statement and
minutes from the  Federal Open Market Committee ’s April 30-May 1
meeting tomorrow as they try to gauge when the central bank will
taper its $85 billion monthly bond-buying program. St. Louis Fed
President  James Bullard  is  scheduled  to speak on monetary policy
at the Institute for Monetary and Financial Stability at 5:30
p.m. today in  Frankfurt .  The credit-swaps index typically rises as investor
confidence deteriorates and falls as it improves. The contracts
pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails to meet its
obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A basis point
equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10 million of
debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
