Philip Morris  International Inc.
agreed to acquire the remaining 20 percent stake in its Mexican
tobacco business from billionaire  Carlos Slim ’s Grupo Carso SAB
for about $700 million.  The deal, which the companies expect to complete by Sept.
30, will add to earnings per share in the fourth quarter, New
York-based Philip Morris said today in a statement. The final
purchase price will be determined by a pre-agreed formula that
is subject to adjustment by the target’s performance.  Chief Executive Officer Andre Calantzopoulos, who took over
from Louis Camilleri earlier this month, is developing new
products and expanding in  emerging markets  after Philip Morris’s
share of global tobacco sales rose to a record 28.8 percent last
year, excluding the U.S. and China.  “The Mexican market is attractive,”  Jack Russo , an
analyst for Edward Jones & Co. in  St. Louis , said by telephone.
“They can go out and acquire other businesses. While they take
on debt to do that,  interest rates  are very low now and these
businesses generate a lot of cash so they can pay off the debt
quickly.”  Philip Morris  fell  1.2 percent to $93.89 at 11:30 a.m. in
New York. The shares have advanced 14 percent this year,
compared with a 17 percent gain for the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index.  Slim Partnership  The agreement ends a partnership dating back more than 30
years, Grupo Carso said in a filing to Mexico’s stock exchange.
Slim has been selling off his stake in the Mexican cigarette
maker for decades as he narrowed Carso’s focus to retail,
industrial materials and construction. Slim sold 21.2 percent of
Philip Morris  Mexico  in 1997 for $400 million and 30 percent in
2007 for $1.1 billion.  The Mexican unit produced 33.6 billion cigarettes last
year, almost three-quarters of which were Marlboros, Carso said.
The company has a market share of 53.6 percent, Carso said.  Grupo Carso rose 1.1 percent to 67.59 pesos at 10:29 a.m.
in Mexico City. The shares had gained 6.8 percent this year
through yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
