China’s stocks  rose for a fifth day,
sending the benchmark index to its longest winning streak in
three months, as technology and solar companies climbed on
improving earnings prospects.  GoerTek Inc. (002241) , an Apple Inc. supplier that reported a 66
percent increase in first-quarter earnings, surged 10 percent to
lead a gauge of technology stocks to the steepest gain among
industry groups.  Xi’an LONGi Silicon Materials Co. (601012)  jumped 10
percent after people familiar with the discussions said the U.S.
is engaged in talks with  China  to resolve a trade row over
solar-energy equipment.  ZTE Corp. (000063)  lost 1.9 percent on concern a
month-long rally for telecom stocks was excessive.  “Investors are buying technology stocks as they believe
these stocks can sustain faster earnings growth amid a
lackluster economy,”  Li Jun , a strategist at Central China
Securities Co. in Shanghai, said by phone today. “As long as
liquidity is ample, smaller stocks will carry on a rally.”  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  gained 0.2 percent to 2,305.11
at the close, the highest since March 25. The five-day streak is
the longest since an eight-day rally that ended Feb. 6.  The Shanghai index has rebounded 6 percent since May 2 on
speculation the government is accelerating economic reform after
saying investment projects for airports and gas fields won’t
need pre-approval any more. The index trades at 10 times
estimated earnings, the highest since March 21, according to
 data  compiled by Bloomberg. Trading volumes were 41 percent
higher than the 30-day average, while 30-day  volatility  was at
16, compared with this year’s average of 19.6, data showed.  Technology Rally  The CSI 300 Index added 0.2 percent to 2,614.85 today,
while the  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  dropped 1.1 percent.
The CSI Smallcap 500 Index rose 1.3 percent. The ChiNext index,
dominated by technology companies, jumped 2.1 percent, adding to
a 50 percent gain for this year. The Bloomberg China-US 55 Index
added 1.7 percent yesterday.  A gauge of technology stocks in the CSI 300 surged 4.7
percent today, the highest close since November 2011. GoerTek
jumped 10 percent to a record high of 71.34 yuan.  Hangzhou HIK-Vision Digital Technology Co. (002415) , a maker of video surveillance,
climbed 6.8 percent to 41.78 yuan.  China International Fund Management’s Du Meng is bullish on
the technology, media and alternative energy companies that
dominate the nation’s small-cap stock indexes, saying they will
benefit most from government efforts to boost consumption and to
invest in “emerging” industries.  Du, whose China International Emerging Momentum Fund has
climbed 41 percent this year for the best performance among 785
China funds, said in an April 23 e-mail that the companies still
have higher growth potential than industries that rely on
exports and fixed-asset investment.  ‘Crowded Trade’  Hao Hong, the chief China strategist at Bank of
Communications Co., who predicted in a Bloomberg Television
interview on Jan. 2 that smaller companies would outperform. He
now says ChiNext stocks are a “crowded trade” that may unwind.  Xi’an LONGi, a maker of silicon wafers, surged by the daily
limit to 9.70  yuan .  Hareon Solar Technology Co. (600401)  added 8.1
percent to 7.88 yuan.  The preliminary negotiations focus on setting a quota on
Chinese exports and a minimum price for solar-energy equipment,
in exchange for suspending U.S. duties on the goods, according
to two people familiar with the U.S. position who asked not to
be identified to discuss private discussions.  A gauge of phone stocks in the CSI 300 lost 1 percent. This
trimmed its gain to 18 percent this month, the biggest advance
among 10 industry groups. Its 14-day relative strength index,
measuring how rapidly prices have advanced or dropped during a
specified time period, was at 78 yesterday. Readings above 70
indicate a price may be poised to fall.  UBS Cut  ZTE, China’s second-biggest phone-equipment maker, slid 1.9
percent to 12.99 yuan.  Fiberhome Telecommunication Technologies
Co. (600498)  retreated 1.4 percent to 34.68 yuan.  UBS AG today cut its China economic growth forecast for
this year to 7.7 percent from 8 percent and lowered next year’s
estimate to 7.8 percent.  “With rising corporate and local government leverage,
little labor market pressure and existence of excess capacity in
some sectors, the government seems to be less focused on
cyclical growth boosters and more on structural reforms, which
would take time to implement and bear fruit,”  Wang Tao , an
economist at UBS, wrote in a report.  HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics are due to release a
preliminary reading for manufacturing this month on May 23. The
index was probably at 50.4, unchanged from 50.4 a month earlier,
according to the median estimate of 12 analysts in a Bloomberg
survey. A reading above 50 indicates expansion.  “The market needs consolidation at this level after the
recent run-up,” said Dai Ming, a  fund manager  at Hengsheng
Hongding Asset Management Co. in Shanghai, which manages $190
million. “Investors’ confidence is gradually picking up on
expectations the economy will stabilize.”  --Zhang Shidong. Editors: Allen Wan, Richard Frost  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
