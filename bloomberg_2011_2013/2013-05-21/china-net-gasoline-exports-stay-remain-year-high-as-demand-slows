China ’s net exports of gasoline
remained near the highest level in a year amid the nation’s
weakest domestic oil demand in eight months.  Overseas sales of gasoline exceeded imports by 468,553
metric tons in April, according to data e-mailed by the General
Administration of Customs in Beijing today. That’s equivalent to
132,360 barrels a day. In March, net gasoline exports were
506,110 tons, the most in a year.  Fuel consumption in China, which uses more oil than any
country except the U.S., has declined as its economic expansion
slowed. Apparent oil demand, or domestic refinery throughput
plus net imports, was 9.66 million barrels a day last month, the
weakest since August, customs data showed May 13. Gross domestic
product increased 7.7 percent in the first quarter, compared
with 7.9 percent in the three months ended December.  “April’s fuel supply has a reasonable surplus because of
sluggish domestic demand,” Jean Zou, an oil analyst at ICIS C1
Energy, a commodities researcher, said by phone from Guangzhou.
“Gasoline exports in May will advance from April’s level.”  Gasoline demand will increase 12 percent in the second
quarter from a year earlier to 22.93 million tons, China Oil,
Gas & Petrochemicals reported May 1. The newsletter, published
by the official Xinhua News agency, cited research by China
National Petroleum Corp., the country’s largest oil company.  Diesel Sales  China’s net diesel exports were 289,013 tons in April, or
about 72,400 barrels a day, today’s data show. That’s a 27
percent drop from March, when it was at the highest level since
July 2010.  China Petroleum & Chemical Corp. (386) ,  Asia ’s biggest oil
refiner, known as Sinopec, will cut overseas sales of diesel by
as much as 90 percent in May compared with the average in the
first quarter, according to ICIS C1. The Guangzhou and Maoming
refineries will be the only plants to export diesel this month,
the Shanghai-based commodities researcher said on its website on
May 16.  China’s fuel oil imports rose 6.5 percent from a year
earlier to 2.37 million tons in April, today’s customs data
show. Purchases rebounded from 2.06 million tons in March, an
eight-month low.  Russia was the largest fuel oil supplier to China last
month and shipped 835,536 tons of the residual product, up 15
percent from last year, according to the data.  Venezuela  was the
second-biggest with 405,389 tons and  Singapore  ranked in third
place with 289,564 tons.  China imported 1.56 million tons of liquefied natural gas
in April, up 48 percent from the same period last year, the data
show. The nation’s coal imports, including lignite, climbed 15
percent to 28.7 million tons last month.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
