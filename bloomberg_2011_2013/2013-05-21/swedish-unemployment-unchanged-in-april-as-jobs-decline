Swedish  unemployment  stayed unchanged
last month as companies have cut jobs to cope with a
strengthening krona and faltering demand from the recession-burdened euro area.  Seasonally adjusted unemployment  was unchanged at 8.4
percent from the previous month, Stockholm-based Statistics
 Sweden  said today. The rate  was predicted  to fall to 8.3
percent, according to the median estimate of nine economists
surveyed by Bloomberg. The  non-seasonally adjusted rate  fell to
8.7 percent from 8.8 percent.  Sweden’s government should continue to “inject energy”
into the Swedish economy next year and probably also in 2015 to
fight unemployment caused by faltering demand from Europe,
Finance Minister Anders Borg said last week. The central bank
last month delayed the timing of a planned  rate  increase, citing
a strengthening currency and an inability by companies to raise
prices.  Sweden sells about half of its output abroad, of which
about 70 percent goes to Europe.  Ericsson AB (ERICB) , the world’s
largest maker of mobile phone networks, and truck maker Volvo
AB, are among exporters who have announced they will cut jobs.  The number of employed, seasonally adjusted, fell to 4.683
million from 4.690 million in March.  To contact the reporter on this story:
