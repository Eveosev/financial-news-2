Corn fell for a second day after U.S.
farmers accelerated planting on warmer weather, boosting
optimism that production in the biggest grower will reach a
record. Soybeans gained to the highest level in almost 10 weeks.  Corn for July delivery slumped as much as 1 percent to
$6.43 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade and was at $6.4675
at 9:38 a.m. in  Singapore . Corn for delivery in December, after
the harvest, slumped as much as 1.6 percent to $5.12 a bushel.  About 71 percent of the crop was  sown  as of May 19, from 28
percent a week earlier, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said
yesterday. Eastern regions of the Midwest saw drier weekend
weather, while parts of the northern Great Plains, Iowa and
 Minnesota  had more than 4 inches (10 centimeters) of rain,
according to QT Weather. The USDA estimates that output will
rise to an all-time high of 359.2 metric million tons as crops
recover from the worst drought since the 1930s.  “Whilst planting still lags the five-year average of 79
percent, the gap has closed considerably,”  Luke Mathews , a
commodity strategist at Commonwealth Bank of  Australia , wrote in
a report today. “The record pace of U.S. corn planting is
likely to weigh on new-crop prices today.”  Wheat for July delivery dropped as much as 1 percent to
$6.785 a bushel and traded at $6.82. About 67 percent of the
spring-wheat crop was sown compared with 43 percent a week
earlier, according to the USDA.  Soybeans for July delivery gained as much as 0.2 percent to
$14.6775 a bushel, the highest for a most-active contract since
March 13, and were at $14.6725.  To contact the reporter on this story:
