Transfield Services Ltd. (TSE) , an
Australian engineering and maintenance company, trimmed its
full-year profit forecast by almost a third and cut 113 jobs as
the mining boom slows and customers delay projects.  Net profit after tax and before amortization and one-time
items may be A$62 million ($60.85 million) to A$65 million in
the 12 months to June 30, the Sydney-based company said today in
a statement. That compares with its previous estimate of A$85
million to A$90 million and 2012 pre-amortization profit of
A$106 million.  A slowdown is continuing in the mining and process
industries and customers are “showing increasing cost and
capital discipline,” Chief Executive Officer Graeme Hunt said
today in a presentation to investors.  UGL Ltd. (UGL) , an Australian infrastructure and engineering
contractor, tumbled the most in five years in Sydney trading on
May 15 after it also downgraded its profit forecast as customers
cut spending and halt major projects. BHP Billiton Ltd., the
world’s largest mining company, and Vale SA are among companies
deferring projects as commodity prices fall and costs rise.  For Related News and Information:  To contact the reporter on this story:
