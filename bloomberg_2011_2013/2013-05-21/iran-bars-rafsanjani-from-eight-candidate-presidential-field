Iran ’s election watchdog barred
former President Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani and a close aide
to incumbent Mahmoud Ahmadinejad from next month’s presidential
vote, limiting the field to mostly loyalist candidates.  Rafsanjani, one of the Islamic republic’s founders and its
president from 1989 to 1997, failed to receive approval from the
Guardian Council, which screens presidential candidates for
their skills and loyalty to the political system, according to a
list published by the Interior Ministry on state television’s
 website  late today. Ahmadinejad’s ally, Esfandiar Rahim Mashaei,
was also barred from the race, according to the report.  Among those on the eight-person shortlist for the June 14
vote are Ali Akbar Velayati, a foreign policy adviser to Supreme
Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei; nuclear negotiator Saeed Jalili;
and Tehran Mayor Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf, according to the
report. Former Parliamentary Speaker Gholam-Ali Haddad Adel and
former nuclear negotiator Hassan Rohani were also approved, it
showed.  Iran’s Guardian Council vetted 650 applications to produce
its shortlist. Approved candidates may start official
campaigning from May 24.  To contact the reporter on this story:
