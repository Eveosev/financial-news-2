Hall of Fame goaltender Patrick Roy
will be the next coach of the  National Hockey League ’s Colorado
Avalanche, the  Denver Post  reported on its  website , citing Roy’s
younger brother Stephane.  Roy, 47, played 18 full seasons in the NHL from 1985,
including his final 7 1/2 with the Avalanche, and won four
Stanley Cup championships. He’s coached in the Quebec Major
Junior Hockey League since 2005, compiling a 307-128-32 record
with the Quebec Remparts, the Post said.  Roy turned down the Avalanche’s coaching job in 2009
because of family reasons, saying he wanted to be able to spend
more time in Quebec with his three children. His sons, Jonathan
and Frederick, are no longer playing under him with the
Remparts, the Post added.  Roy was an 11-time NHL All-Star who had a career record of
551 wins and 315 losses. The Avalanche went 16-25-7 this season
and finished with the second-worst point total in the NHL.
