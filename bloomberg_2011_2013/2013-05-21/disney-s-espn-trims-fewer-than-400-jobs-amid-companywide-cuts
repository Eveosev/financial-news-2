Walt Disney Co. (DIS) ’s ESPN sports
television division fired several hundred workers today, part of
a companywide drive to improve profitability.  The firings number fewer than 400 and include unfilled
positions, according to a person with knowledge of the situation
who wasn’t authorized to speak publicly and asked not to be
named. ESPN, based in Bristol,  Connecticut , announced the cuts
in an e-mailed statement.  “We are implementing changes across the company to enhance
our continued growth while smartly managing costs,” ESPN said
in the statement. “While difficult, we are confident that it
will make us more competitive, innovative and productive.”  The cuts amount to less than 6 percent of ESPN’s 7,000
employees worldwide. Disney, the world’s largest entertainment
company, has made an ongoing review of costs a crucial part of
its strategy, along with growth at its parks, media networks and
consumer products unit, to increase profit margins.  The company eliminated 150 jobs from its film studio in
April and shut down video-game development in Austin,  Texas , and
at the recently acquired Lucasfilm Ltd., as part of broad
efficiency effort this year. The company said May 7 that fiscal
second-quarter profit rose 32 percent to $1.51 billion.  The cuts were previously reported by the sports news
website Deadspin.com.  Disney, based in  Burbank ,  California ,  fell  0.4 percent to
$65.83 at the close in New York. The stock has risen 32 percent
this year, compared with 17 percent for the Standard & Poor’s
500 Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
