Cattle futures rallied, heading for
the biggest gain in more than two weeks, on signs of increasing
demand for U.S. beef. Hog prices also gained.  Meatpackers processed 125,000 cattle yesterday, up 1.6
percent from a week earlier, U.S. Department of Agriculture data
show. Wholesale  beef  added 0.2 percent today to $2.1046 a pound,
the highest since at least January 2004, government data show.
Memorial Day, which is May 27 this year, is the most popular day
for grilling after the Fourth of July holiday, according to the
Hearth, Patio & Barbecue Association.  “Packers will be buying for a short kill week next week,
but they still have beef orders to fill for last-minute Memorial
Day and Father’s Day delivery,” Troy Vetterkind, the owner of
Vetterkind Cattle Brokerage LLC in Thorp,  Wisconsin , said in an
e-mailed report.  Cattle futures for August delivery rose 0.9 percent to
$1.20225 a pound at 11:53 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, heading for the biggest gain since May 2. Prices were
down 9.9 percent this year through yesterday.  Feeder-cattle futures for August settlement added 1.4
percent to $1.46475 a pound.  Hog futures for July settlement advanced 0.3 percent to
