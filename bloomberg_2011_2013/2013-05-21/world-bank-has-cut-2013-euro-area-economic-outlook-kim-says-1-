World Bank  President Jim Yong Kim
said the lender cut its forecast for the euro-area economy this
year and now sees a larger contraction.  The World Bank lowered its projection to “a little more
negative” than previously, Kim said in an interview in Geneva
today. It now sees the economy shrinking 0.6 percent, rather
than the 0.2 percent previously forecast, the lender said in a
e-mailed statement after the interview. It expects the 17-nation
economy to resume expansion in 2014.  The  euro-area economy  shrank 0.2 percent in the first
quarter, more than economists forecast, extending a recession to
a record sixth quarter.  Germany ’s economy, the region’s largest,
expanded less than forecast in the period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
