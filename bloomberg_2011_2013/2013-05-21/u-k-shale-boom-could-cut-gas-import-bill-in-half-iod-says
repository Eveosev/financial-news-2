Developing U.K. shale could cut the
nation’s gas import bill in half and create thousands of jobs,
according to a report by the  Institute of Directors .  Shale gas output could reduce imports to 37 percent in
2030, costing 7.5 billion pounds ($11 billion), the IoD said
today. Without shale, 76 percent of the nation’s gas would
probably have to be imported by that date, at a cost of 15.6
billion pounds, it said. Investment in shale could peak at 3.7
billion pounds a year, supporting 74,000 jobs, the business
group said in the report sponsored by Cuadrilla Resources Ltd.  The U.K. government, which lifted a moratorium on shale
exploration at the end of last year, is preparing tax breaks for
drillers as it seeks to diversify energy supplies as
conventional oil and gas production from the North Sea declines.
Cuadrilla Resources said earlier this month it plans to drill an
exploratory well in Balcombe, southern  England .  To contact the reporter on this story:
