Prime Minister  David Cameron  won
passage through the House of Commons of a bill legalizing gay
marriage in England and Wales. It must next be approved by the
upper unelected House of Lords before becoming law.  Lawmakers voted 366 to 161 in London today to pass the
 Marriage (Same-Sex Couples) Bill  after an attempt by opponents
in Cameron’s Tory party to amend the proposal failed yesterday.  Amendments to the bill that would have watered it down or
extended the “civil partnerships” now open to gay couples to
heterosexuals were rejected by lawmakers as the opposition  Labor
Party  backed Cameron’s position.  Activists say the prime minister’s backing of gay marriage
is driving Conservative voters toward the U.K. Independence
Party, which made gains in local elections this month at the
expense of the ruling parties.  To contact the reporter on this story:
