Gold and silver futures resumed
slumps on speculation that the  Federal Reserve  may scale back
U.S. debt purchases, curbing demand for the precious metals as a
store of value.  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  will discuss the economic
outlook in congressional testimony and the central bank will
publish minutes of its latest meeting tomorrow. The bank buys
$85 billion of Treasury and mortgage debt a month. The dollar
advanced as much as 0.6 percent against a basket of currencies.
Yesterday, gold gained 1.4 percent, snapping the longest skid in
four years.  “Tomorrow’s minutes are very important as there is some
concern that the Fed may want to cut back on the stimulus,”
 Michael Smith , the president of T&K Futures & Options in Port
St. Lucie, Florida, said in a telephone interview. “Also, the
dollar’s strength is working against gold.”  Gold futures for June delivery fell 0.5 percent to settle
at $1,377.60 an ounce at 1:43 p.m. on the Comex in  New York .
Trading was 30 percent above the average in the past 100 days
for this time, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Yesterday, the price rebounded after touching $1,336.30,
the lowest for a most-active contract since April 18. That
snapped a seven-session slump, the longest since March 2009.  Bear Market  Gold has tumbled 18 percent this year, falling into a  bear
market  last month as some investors lost faith in the metal
after equities rallied. Fed Bank of Chicago President  Charles
Evans  said yesterday the economy has improved “quite a lot.”  Yesterday,  holdings  in exchange-traded products dropped
10.9 metric tons to 2,187.4 tons, the lowest since July 2011.
They have tumbled 17 percent this year, according to the latest
Bloomberg data.  Sales from ETPs “will put downward pressure on prices,”
said  David Lennox , a resource analyst at Fat Prophets in Sydney.  Silver futures for July delivery fell 0.6 percent to
$22.455 an ounce on the Comex. Yesterday, the price touched
