U.S. stocks gained as Federal Reserve
Bank of St. Louis President  James Bullard  said the central bank
should continue its bond buying because it’s the best available
option to boost growth.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index added 0.1 percent to
1,668.30 at 11:35 a.m. in New York and the  Dow Jones Industrial
Average  increased 35.63 points to 15,370.91.  The purchases known as quantitative easing should be
maintained because financial markets indicate that they are
improving financial conditions and can be adjusted based on how
the economy changes, Bullard, who votes on the policy-setting
 Federal Open Market Committee  this year, said today according to
the text of remarks prepared for delivery in Frankfurt.  “Quantitative easing is closest to standard monetary
policy, involves clear action and has been effective,” Bullard
said. The panel should continue the program while “adjusting
the rate of purchases appropriately in view of incoming data on
both real economic performance and inflation.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
