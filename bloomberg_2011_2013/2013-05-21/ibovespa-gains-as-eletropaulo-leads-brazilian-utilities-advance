The Ibovespa equity benchmark rose to
a two-week high as Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras SA led gains
by Brazilian electrical utilities amid speculation that recent
losses may have been excessive.  Water company  Cia. de Saneamento Basico do Estado de Sao
Paulo  also rose as the MSCI  Brazil /Utilities Index jumped the
most among 10 industry groups. Planemaker  Embraer SA (EMBR3)  rallied
after saying it received an order for jets that may be worth as
much as $8.3 billion.  The Ibovespa gained 1 percent to 56,265.32 at the close of
trading in Sao Paulo, the highest since May 7. Fifty-three
stocks advanced on the index while 17 retreated. The real
depreciated 0.1 percent to 2.0404 per dollar. Eletrobras gained
7 percent to 10.09 reais, paring the slump in the past 12 months
to 45 percent.  “There are signs that the worst is over for utilities,”
Marc Sauerman, who helps oversee 650 million reais at Curitiba,
Brazil-based J. Malucelli Investimentos, said in a telephone
interview. “Obviously, we can’t say they’re going into a  bull
market , but I think in the past few weeks investors started to
regain interest in this sector.”  The Bovespa Electric Energy Index of 16 power companies has
tumbled 15 percent in the past 12 months as the Brazilian
government ordered utilities applying for license renewals to
reduce rates.  Sabesp, as Cia. de Saneamento de Sao Paulo is also known,
advanced 3.4 percent to 27.30 reais.  HRT Plunges  Oil company  HRT Participacoes em Petroleo SA  plunged 13
percent to a record low 2.85 reais after saying in a regulatory
filing that a well drilled in Brazil’s Solimoes basin is dry and
another in  Namibia  has no commercial volume of crude.  The Ibovespa has declined 7.7 percent this year, the worst
performer after  Colombia ’s IGBC index among 19 major  emerging
markets , data compiled by Bloomberg show. Brazil’s benchmark
equity index  trades  at 12.5 times analysts’ earnings estimates
for the next four quarters, compared with a multiple of 10.9 for
the MSCI Emerging Markets Index of 21 developing nations’
equities, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Trading volume for stocks in  Sao Paulo  was 6.87 billion
reais today, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That
compares with a daily average of 7.71 billion reais this year
through May 17, according to data compiled by the exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
