Grupo Isolux Corsan SA’s task of laying  power lines  across the Amazon jungle ran into an unexpected obstacle last year when Brazil took more than six months to grant visas for 200 specialized Chinese workers.  The red tape increased costs and brought delays for the 1,200 kilometers (746 miles) of transmission cables on one of the most important energy projects in the world’s second-biggest emerging economy, Gilvan Righetti, human resources director of the Madrid-based company, said last month as the project neared completion.  “If we are in a hurry to launch new technology and have to wait for five months, we lose time and money and so does  Brazil ,” said Antonio Roberto Cortes, chief executive of the Latin American unit of Munich-based vehicle and equipment manufacturer  MAN SE (MAN) .  The obstacles to immigration resulting from bureaucratic slowness and protection of jobs for native Brazilians are hindering the country’s development by delaying infrastructure projects, increasing costs and stifling innovation. From oil and gas to construction and manufacturing, companies throughout Brazil face impediments to hiring foreigners to overcome a shortage of skilled local workers, said Edmar Perfetto, a partner at PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP in Sao Paulo, who advises foreign corporations on tax and labor issues.  Last year MAN brought a dozen engineers from  Germany  to help implement new technology and sent nine Brazilians there. “Obtaining the same permit in Germany takes 30 to 40 days,” Cortes said, compared with three to five months in Brazil. The company plans to bring in more foreign workers, who typically stay two to three years, its press office said in an e-mailed statement.  Bureaucratic Hurdles  Bureaucratic hurdles can deter qualified people who want to work in Brazil, said Anabel Guzman, whose five years of studies in  Spain  toward becoming an orthodontist weren’t recognized by authorities in Brasilia in 2006. The native Spaniard said she lost hope and turned to teaching Spanish language classes, which required less initial training.  “I faced a lot of resistance, it was horrible,” Guzman said in a telephone interview. “I thought it would be much easier.” Guzman since obtained a degree in linguistics and teaches at a local university.  To overcome such bottlenecks, President  Dilma Rousseff  plans to ease restrictions, leading to as much as a seven-fold increase in the number of immigrant workers to about half a million annually, according to the Strategic Affairs Ministry.  No Threat  “Foreigners should not be seen as a threat but as an opportunity,” Under-secretary for Strategic Affairs Ricardo Paes de Barros told a seminar on global mobility in Sao Paulo state on April 11, according to a ministry press release. It was one of several public events this year at which government officials discussed the intention to ease immigration policies. “We’re surveying entrepreneurs’ demand for skilled workers and presenting proposals to improve Brazil’s immigration policy,” Paes de Barros said.  Nearly three-quarters of Brazil’s economic growth over the past decade resulted from an increase of its own workforce rather than employee productivity, the  Boston Consulting Group  said in a January report.  Gross domestic product  expanded an average 3.6 percent over 10 years, including 0.9 percent growth in 2012. Importing skilled labor could help boost productivity and innovation, said Paes de Barros.  “This approach is not sustainable, and the country will need to improve productivity significantly to meet its aspiration of growing GDP by more than 4 percent per year,” Boston-based BCG said.  Speeding up the work-visa process is part of Rousseff’s plan to lower production costs and increase the competitiveness of Brazilian manufacturers, whose trade surplus of $8.7 billion in 2005 turned into a $94.1 billion deficit by last year.  Energy Costs  The administration has also cut energy costs, lowered  interest rates  to record lows, and reduced payroll taxes to help reverse a two-year economic slowdown.  The number of permanent immigrants to Brazil in 2010 equaled 0.01 percent of the population, compared with 0.24 percent in  Argentina  and 0.34 percent in the U.S., according to the  Organization of American States .  The number of foreign work permits increased to 73,022 last year from 70,524 in 2011 and 56,006 in 2010, according to the labor ministry. Still, immigrants make up only 0.4 percent of Brazil’s 195 million population, compared with 1.3 percent in  Latin America , 9.5 percent in  Europe  and 14.2 percent in  North America , according to 2010 data published by the  United Nations .  A tight labor market and lack of training have led to shortages of skilled labor, particularly engineers, doctors and scientists, said Joao Marques, head of Sao Paulo-based  EMDOC , a relocation and immigration consultant.  ‘Extremely Closed’  Andre, a 51-year-old ear, nose and throat doctor who practiced medicine for 20 years in Cuba, could help overcome Brazil’s shortage of physicians. He says that before he can get his medical license, which itself can take more than a year, he will have to wait as long as two years for his immigration and work papers. Meanwhile he sells beach wraps in  Rio de Janeiro .  “If in two years I haven’t resolved the situation here, I’ll leave,” said Andre, who spoke on condition of not mentioning his family name for fear of jeopardizing his application. “I’ll go to another country where I can work.”  Brazil is a country that’s “extremely” closed to foreign labor, Marques said by telephone from  Sao Paulo . “Unfortunately, it’s easier to bring in an unqualified worker than a PhD in sciences.”  Yearlong Process  A government bill, which may be presented to congress this year, would cut red tape, including the often yearlong process of certifying foreign university diplomas. It may also ease requirements that Brazilians make up at least two-thirds of a company’s workforce and restrictions on transferring foreigners who have work permits to other corporate locations within the country.  “It causes my clients big headaches,” PricewaterhouseCooper’s Perfetto said in a telephone interview. “It’s a widespread problem.”  The government’s plans to ease immigration laws face opposition from legislators and labor unions, particularly in the oil and gas sector.  “This proposal is a mistake, we reject it,” Joao Antonio de Moraes, general coordinator of the  union of petroleum worker s, said by phone from Rio de Janeiro. “It’s no use increasing oil production quickly if that means importing foreign labor.”  Jungles, Swamps  The setback in bringing Chinese engineers to erect  high-tension transmission towers  through dense jungle, swamps, and across the 2.5 kilometer-wide Amazon river threw off Isolux’s timetable and prolonged delays due to the onset of the rainy season, Righetti said in a telephone interview from Sao Paulo.  “It cost us dearly,” he said.  Brazil plans to bring on line at least 16 electricity generators through 2016 to help meet energy demand forecast to grow by 4.6 percent annually over the next decade.  Until now, Rousseff has attempted to overcome the shortage of skilled labor with targeted education and professional training programs, including stipends for 100,000 students to attend universities abroad. Such measures do little to meet the economy’s immediate demands, which include more than 20,000 new engineers a year, said Wellington Moreira Franco, who stepped down as strategic affairs minister in March.  “Education doesn’t provide the short-term results we need,” Moreira Franco said in a January interview in Brasilia.  The shift in the government’s attitude follows years of import-substitution policies and domestic content requirements designed to create more jobs in Brazil.  With the economy now facing serious infrastructure and workforce bottlenecks, the time has come to change restrictions, said Gilson Coelho, executive secretary of  Abespetro , an association of oil service companies.  “It’s a welcome change,” Coelho said in a telephone interview from Rio de Janeiro. “Brazil is in a hurry and we can’t forgo much-needed international expertise.”  To contact the reporter on this story: Raymond Colitt in Brasilia Newsroom at  rcolitt@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story: Andre Soliani at  asoliani@bloomberg.net
