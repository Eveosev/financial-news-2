Juhl Energy Inc. (JUHL) , the Pipestone,
Minnesota-based renewable-energy developer, acquired two 1.65-megawatt wind farms in Canada, its first projects outside the
U.S.  The wind farms are being developed under an NB Power
program that lets independent energy producers sell electricity
to the provincial utility through long-term contracts, Juhl said
in a statement today.  Juhl purchased the TerraRidge and TerraVista projects in
western New Brunswick from Terravis Wind. Terms weren’t
disclosed. Financing for both wind farms is expected to be
completed by the third quarter and construction will start in
the fourth quarter, according to the statement.  Juhl “is actively seeking to partner with or acquire mid-stage wind project developments” that fit the company’s growth
strategy in  North America , Corey Juhl, vice president of
development, said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
