MetLife Inc., the largest U.S. life
insurer, said it is merging an offshore captive reinsurance unit
into a U.S. regulated entity as the company addresses
“regulatory concerns.”  The merging of three U.S. subsidiaries and a foreign
reinsurer, expected to be completed in 2014, will help the
company be in a “better position to deal with Dodd-Frank
derivative collateral requirements,” the New York-based company
said today in a regulatory filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
