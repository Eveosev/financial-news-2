Michael Wilson , a former Canadian
finance minister and ambassador to the U.S., said bond yields
have fallen so low they are no longer compensating for risks.  “The fixed-income market itself is a risky market with the
level of yields as they are today,” Wilson, 75, chairman of
Barclays Capital Canada, said today at the Bloomberg Canada
Economic Summit in Toronto. “Investors and particularly
insurance funds have to be careful as so much of their funds are
in yield-based products.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
