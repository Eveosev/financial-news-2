EdX, the online education consortium
founded by  Harvard University  and the  Massachusetts Institute of
Technology , has expanded to add 15 universities, including
schools in China, Korea and Japan.  EdX will offer online courses from 27 universities with the
additions of  Peking University , Hong Kong University of Science
& Technology, Seoul National University and Kyoto University,
among others, according to a statement from EdX, based in
Cambridge, Massachusetts.  Cornell University  and the University
of Washington also signed up, EdX said.  “We are moving forward with our mission to reimagine
education,” Anant Agarwal, president of EdX and an MIT
professor, said in the statement.  EdX, which started last year with $60 million, is one of a
number of providers of massive open online courses, or MOOCs,
that are sweeping across higher education. Coursera, a for-profit company founded by two Stanford University professors,
has signed up more than 60 universities and is offering courses
to more than 3.5 million students. While some colleges have
embraced MOOCs as a way to spread the best of their teaching,
faculty at some schools have objected that it will be used to
replace classroom instruction.  To contact the reporter on this story:
