A majority of euro-area companies
would prefer to have more guidance from government authorities
on how to comply with tax rules, even if it reduces their scope
to avoid cross-border payments, according to a study from
London-based  Grant Thornton  International Ltd.  About 75 percent of firms within the 17-nation currency
bloc would welcome more information on what is and isn’t
acceptable tax planning, as would 68 percent worldwide and 54
percent in  North America , according to the study, based on a
quarterly survey of 3,000 businesses in 44 countries. The
survey’s release today coincides with a summit in Brussels,
where EU leaders will discuss how to regulate “aggressive” tax
strategies and other anti-tax-evasion issues.  “In the U.K., recent high-profile cases involving Amazon,
Google and Starbucks have certainly sharpened public opinion as
to what is acceptable tax planning,” Francesca Lagerberg,
incoming global tax leader at accounting and advisory firm Grant Thornton, said in a statement. “It seems the majority of
business leaders would also welcome more transparency.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
