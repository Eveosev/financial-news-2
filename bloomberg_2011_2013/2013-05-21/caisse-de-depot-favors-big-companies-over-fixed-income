Caisse de Depot et Placement du
Quebec is “significantly” reducing its weighting of bond
assets and favoring stocks of large, global companies such as
 Nestle SA (NESN)  and  Colgate-Palmolive Co. (CL) , said Chief Executive
Officer  Michael Sabia .  “To me, there’s less risk sitting in that portfolio than
sitting in a  fixed-income  portfolio,” Sabia said at the
Bloomberg Economic Summit today in Toronto.  The Caisse posted a 9.6 percent investment return last year
with the help of gains in real estate, public and private
equity. Investment income amounted to C$14.9 billion ($14.5
billion) and depositors made net contributions of C$2.3 billion,
the Montreal-based fund manager said in February. Net assets
rose to C$176.2 billion as of Dec. 31, overtaking the C$172.6
billion managed by the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board.  Sabia, 59, is planning to increase investments in assets
such as real estate, infrastructure and private equity to reduce
volatility in its returns. He told reporters in January that the
Caisse plans to add C$10 billion to C$12 billion in what it
calls less-liquid investments in the next two years because the
markets “are no longer a good gauge of value.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
