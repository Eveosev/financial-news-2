All-Pro tight end  Rob Gronkowski  of
the  New England Patriots  had a fourth surgery yesterday to
repair the left forearm he broke twice during the 2012 National
Football League season, the  Boston Globe reported .  Gronkowski, 24, had a plate in his forearm replaced after
developing an infection in the area, the paper said, citing an
unidentified person familiar with the situation. It will take
several days to determine whether the infection is cleared, at
which time Gronkowski could begin an eight- to 10-week
rehabilitation program for his forearm, the Globe said.  Gronkowski missed five games last season, when he broke his
forearm on Nov. 18. He returned on Dec. 30 -- the last week of
the regular season -- and then broke his arm again in a
divisional playoff game against the Houston Texans on Jan. 13.  The Globe also said Gronkowski might need surgery this
offseason to repair a disk in his back, a procedure that might
take place during his recovery from forearm surgery and probably
wouldn’t prevent him from missing training camp.  To contact the reporter on this story:
