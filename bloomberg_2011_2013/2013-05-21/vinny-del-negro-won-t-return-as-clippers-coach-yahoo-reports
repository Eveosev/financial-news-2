Vinny Del Negro won’t be back as
coach of the  Los Angeles Clippers  for a fourth season after
leading the team to 56 wins and a division title for the first
time in its 42-year history.  The Clippers today opted not to offer Del Negro a new
contract after being eliminated by the  Memphis Grizzlies  in the
first round of the National Basketball Association playoffs.  “We greatly appreciate all that he and his staff helped us
accomplish,” Clippers Vice President of Basketball Operations
Gary Sacks said of Del Negro in a statement. “This was a
difficult decision, but we feel this is the best decision for
our franchise.”  The Clippers had a 56-26 record this season and won the
Western Conference’s Pacific division title before losing to the
Grizzlies in the postseason.  Sacks didn’t comment further in the Clippers’ statement
about the reasons for Del Negro’s exit. Clippers point guard
 Chris Paul , who is set to become a free agent, wanted a
different coach, Yahoo Sports reported.  Del Negro, 46, has a 210-184 coaching record over five NBA
seasons with the Clippers and Chicago Bulls.  To contact the reporter on this story:
