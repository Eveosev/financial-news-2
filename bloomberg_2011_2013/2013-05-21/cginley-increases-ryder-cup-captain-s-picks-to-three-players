European Ryder Cup captain Paul McGinley will select three wild-card players for his 2014 team,
one more than Jose Maria Olazabal used last year.  McGinley’s three picks put him in line with U.S. captain
 Tom Watson , who announced in March he’ll choose three wild cards
instead of the four used by the Americans in the past two
biennial golf matches.  “You only need to look at the record books to see that we
haven’t done too badly of late so I didn’t see the need to make
sweeping changes,” McGinley said in a statement released by the
European Tour.  The 40th Ryder Cup matches will be played Sept. 26-28,
2014, at Gleneagles in Perthshire,  Scotland . The European
qualifying system will begin with the  Wales  Open this September.  The first four qualifiers for McGinley’s team will come
from the Ryder Cup European points list and the remaining five
from the Ryder Cup world points list. Olazabal selected five off
each list for last year’s matches at Medinah Country Club
outside  Chicago .  “I’ve kept the qualification list order the same as Olly
had it for Medinah, the only difference being that I’ve
increased the number of picks from two to three,” McGinley
said. “I’ve done that to give myself a little bit of extra
flexibility when it comes to making my selections.”  Europe has won five of the past six Ryder Cups, including
equaling the biggest comeback in competition history last year
by rallying from a 10-6 deficit beginning the last session to
win 14 1/2 to 13 1/2.  To contact the reporter on this story:
