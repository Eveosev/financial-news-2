HRT Participacoes em Petroleo SA 
tumbled to a record low in  Sao Paulo  after the oil and gas
explorer abandoned wells in  Brazil  and Namibia.  The Rio de Janeiro-based company’s shares sank 17 percent
to 2.71 reais at 11:10 a.m. local time after plunging to 2.52
reais, the lowest price since its October 2010 initial public
offering. Trading volume today was 3.1 times the three-month
daily average. The Ibovespa stock benchmark slid 0.3 percent.  HRT is abandoning a well that turned up dry in northern
Brazil’s Solimoes Basin and another one in Namibia, where it
found non-commercial oil volumes, according to a regulatory
filing. The company will continue drilling three additional
offshore wells in the African country, Nilo Azambuja, the
company’s exploration and production head, said today in an
interview.  HRT has declined 44 percent this year while the  Ibovespa (IBOV) 
has fallen  8.9 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
