Spain  met its upper goal at a sale of
bills today as borrowing costs rose ahead of a meeting of
European Union leaders.  The Madrid-based Treasury sold 3.51 billion euros ($4.52
billion) of bills, compared with an upper target of 3.5 billion
euros. It sold three-month bills at an average 0.331 percent
today, compared with 0.12 percent on April 23. It sold nine-month debt at 0.789 percent, compared with 0.787 percent at the
previous auction.  Demand for three-month debt was 4.29 times the amount sold,
up from 3.76 last month. The ratio fell to 2.16 from 2.37 on the
longer-dated securities, the Bank of Spain said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
