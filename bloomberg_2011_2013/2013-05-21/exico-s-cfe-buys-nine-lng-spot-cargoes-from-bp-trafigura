Comision Federal de Electricidad,
Mexico’s state utility, is scheduled to receive nine spot
cargoes of liquefied natural gas over the next 19 months from BP
Gas Marketing Ltd., a subsidiary of  BP Plc (BP/) , and Trafigura AG.  The utility awarded eight shipments on May 17 to BP and one
cargo to Trafigura for delivery to the Manzanillo terminal on
the country’s west coast, CFE said in an e-mailed statement
yesterday. All nine cargoes will have average volume of 110
billion cubic feet and come from Qatar,  Norway , Trinidad &
Tobago, Brunei or Nigeria, according to CFE.  Trafigura will deliver its shipment around June 18, and CFE
will decide soon to buy two more cargoes, according to the
statement. The utility last week bought 18 LNG shipments from
the Swiss trader at an average price of $15.84 per million
British thermal units from its recent tender in April, which
sought 30 LNG cargoes for delivery to Manzanillo.  Trafigura’s latest shipment was awarded at less than $15.84
per million Btu, and 12 companies participated in the bidding
process, according to CFE.  The price of LNG spot cargoes for delivery to Northeast
Asia during the next four to eight weeks was $14.30 per million
Btu, Energy Intelligence Group said on the website of its World
Gas Intelligence publication May 15. The price in Southwest
Europe was $11.55 per million Btu, the website shows.  The LNG will be regasified and sent into the Manzanillo-Guadalajara gas pipeline.  Latin America  Latin America’s LNG import capacity will increase to 49.2
million metric tons a year in 2020 from 30 million in 2013,
Anton Safronov,  Total SA’s (FP)  LNG origination director, said May 9
in  Singapore .  Manzanillo, with a capacity of 3.8 million tons a year,
started operations in May 2012, according to the website of
 Samsung C&T Corp. (000830)   Korea Gas Corp. (036460) , the world’s biggest LNG
