Ericsson AB (ERICB) , the world’s biggest
maker of wireless  network equipment , said it plans to close its
telecom cable manufacturing operations as demand for copper
cable declines.  Ericsson said the closing would mainly impact facilities in
Stockholm and in Hudiksvall, a city on the east coast of Sweden,
with a total of 354 workers to be made redundant. The company,
based in the Swedish capital, said global production has shifted
toward  Asia , where the majority of the business volume for fiber
cable are found. In Europe, there is more output than demand for
copper and fiber cables, Ericsson said.  “There is overproduction on the cable market in Europe,”
Tomas Qvist, Ericsson’s head of special products in the networks
business and head of human resources in  Sweden , said in a
statement. “Unfortunately, our production has not been
operating at full capacity for a long time and has struggled
with profitability.”  Ericsson said net sales for its telecom cables was about 1
billion kronor ($150 million) last year. The restructuring
charges related to the closure will be about 500 million kronor
and will be split between this quarter and the third quarter.  The manufacturer said in November it would cut 1,550 jobs
in Sweden to make up for weak equipment spending from
telecommunication operators.  Ericsson  shares  slipped 0.6 percent to 78.90 kronor at 3:26
p.m. in Stockholm, declining for the fourth day. That pared the
advance to 21 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
