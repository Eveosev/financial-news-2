Cocoa rebounded as a weakening pound
helped the futures traded in  London , while the dollar-denominated beans traded in New York advanced at a slower pace.
Sugar retreated.  The pound fell toward a six-week low against the dollar
after a report showed U.K. inflation slowed more in April than
economists forecast. Consumer prices climbed 2.4 percent from a
year earlier, compared with 2.8 percent in March, the  Office for
National Statistics  said in London. The median forecast of 35
economists in a Bloomberg News survey was 2.6 percent. The pound
fell 0.5 percent to $1.5179, after sliding to as low as $1.5158
on May 17, the lowest since April 4.  “London cocoa is gaining some support from a weakening
pound, but volumes are very light so far,” Jerome Jourquin,
head of agricultural commodity derivatives at brokerage Aurel
BGC in Paris, said by e-mail today. “There is some support from
the industry also, but it’s also not that big.”  Cocoa for delivery in July gained 0.6 percent to 1,547
pounds ($2,348) a ton by 11:06 a.m. on NYSE Liffe in London. It

percent to $2,303 a ton on ICE Futures U.S. in New York.  Sterling dropped versus all except one of its 16 major
counterparts before the  Bank of England  releases minutes of it
May 8-9 meeting tomorrow, which will reveal how many policy
makers voted to boost asset purchases that tend to weaken a
currency. A weaker pound makes sales of the commodity cheaper.  Ghana  Cocoa purchases in  Ghana , the world’s second-biggest
producer, fell 9.9 percent from the start of the season through
to May 9, according to data on KnowledgeCharts, a unit of
Commodities Risk Analysis in Bethlehem,  Pennsylvania . Purchases,
an indication of output, totaled 679,000 tons, down from 754,000
