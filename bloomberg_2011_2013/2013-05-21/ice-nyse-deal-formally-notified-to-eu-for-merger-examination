IntercontinentalExchange Inc. (ICE) 
formally sought European Union approval for its plans to buy
NYSE Euronext 15 months after regulators blocked  Deutsche
Boerse (DB1)  AG’s acquisition of the  New York  Stock Exchange operator.  The EU regulator said last month it would review the
exchange’s plans after national regulators didn’t object to it
taking the lead. The formal  filing  by ICE was made on May 17 and
triggered an initial deadline of June 24 for the EU to rule on
the deal, the European Commission said on its website today.  ICE agreed on Dec. 21 to acquire NYSE Euronext for cash and
stock totaling $8.2 billion at the time. EU regulators vetoed
Deutsche Boerse’s purchase of NYSE last year, citing concern
over competition in derivatives and clearing.  ICE, the energy and commodity futures bourse, said in March
that it sought an EU review of its acquisition to avoid separate
probes in the U.K., Spain and Portugal.  Brookly McLaughlin, a spokeswoman for Atlanta-based ICE,
and Caroline Tourrier, a spokeswoman for  NYSE Euronext (NYX)  in Paris,
didn’t immediately respond to a call and e-mail seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
