A unit of  Nippon Steel (5401)  & Sumitomo
Metal Corp.,  Japan ’s largest steelmaker, expects annual sales of
5 billion yen ($49 million) from its geothermal business as
early as 2015.  Nippon Steel & Sumikin Engineering Co. plans to expand its
business in Japan and in countries such as  Indonesia , Ryuichi
Kageyama, general manager for the geothermal power business,
said at a briefing today. It also plans to enter plant
operation, maintenance services and power retailing, he said.  The company doesn’t have a comparative figure for current
geothermal sales as there has been little development in Japan
over the past several years, he said. The country’s last
commercial geothermal plant was built in 1999 on Hachijo island,
about 287 kilometers (178 miles) south of  Tokyo .  Nippon Steel & Sumikin, based in Tokyo, has supplied steam
production equipment and pipelines for nine of the 17 geothermal
stations currently running in Japan, including the Hachijo
island plant, according to the company.  Japanese companies are renewing their interest in
geothermal energy after the March 2011 nuclear crisis shut down
reactors for safety checks and the introduction of an incentive
program for clean energy encouraged investment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
