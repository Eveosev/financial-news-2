Dubai shares declined the most in
more than a month on investor bets gains this year are overdone
and as stocks in Europe and Asia retreated from a five-year
high.  Abu Dhabi ’s gauge also decreased.  Emaar Properties PJSC (EMAAR) , the developer of the world’s tallest
building, slid the most in more than four weeks.  Emirates NBD
PJSC (EMIRATES) , the United Arab Emirates’ second-biggest bank by assets,
lost 1.6 percent. Dubai’s benchmark DFM General Index dropped
0.9 percent, the most since April 18, to 2,319.35 at the close
in the emirate. The measure is still up 43 percent this year and
two days ago closed at the highest since October 2009. Abu
Dhabi’s  benchmark  declined 0.4 percent, trimming the gain for
the year to 33 percent.  Shares on Dubai’s benchmark trade at an average price-to-book value of 0.94, the highest since 2009, and compared with
0.69 at the end of last year. In Europe, the Stoxx Europe 600
 Index (DFMGI)  slipped 0.5 percent at 12:24 p.m. in London, as remarks by
a Federal Reserve official fueled concern the central bank may
reduce stimulus measures.  “The pullback stems from a combination of profit taking
and a generally heightened sense of risk aversion on the back of
the decline we’ve seen in global equity markets,” said Gus Chehayeb, director of  Middle East  and North Africa research at
investment bank Exotix Ltd.  Emaar fell 1.7 percent to 5.87 dirhams and Emirates NBD
declined to 5.70 dirhams. The shares this year surged 57 percent
and doubled, respectively.  Arabtec Holding Co. (ARTC)  lost for a second day, decreasing 0.8
percent to 2.37 dirhams after a group of the company’s
construction workers striked this week. Arabtec said today the
walkout won’t affect project delivery time lines and that it’s
working with the U.A.E. Ministry of Labour, Dubai Police and
security authorities to resolve it.  In Abu Dhabi,  Sorouh Real Estate Co. (SOROUH)  dropped 0.4 percent
and  First Gulf Bank PJSC (FGB)  fell 1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
