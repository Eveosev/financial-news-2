       May 21 (Bloomberg) - Blake Morgan, an indie recording 
artist, says he is challenging internet radio service Pandora 
Media Inc because the company has dishonestly claimed to empower
musicians at the same time it pays royalties that are lower than
other radio companies and is seeking to lower them further.  
Morgan speaks with Bloomberg's  Kathleen Hays  and Vonnie Quinn on
Bloomberg Radio's "The Hays Advantage."   (Source: Bloomberg)  Running time 09:15
