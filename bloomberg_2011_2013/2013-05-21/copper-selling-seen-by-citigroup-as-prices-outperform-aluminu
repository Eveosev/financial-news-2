Investors may sell copper as the
metal used in pipes and wiring outperforms aluminum, widening
the gap between their prices, according to Citigroup Inc.  Copper for delivery in three months traded at 3.97 times
the price of the equivalent aluminum contract by 3:11 p.m. on
the  London  Metal Exchange. The ratio reached 3.62, the lowest
since January 2012, on April 23. Investors may sell copper when
the gap widens to 4.0 to capitalize on the movement, according
to  David Wilson , an analyst at Citigroup in London.  “Everybody and their dog are just playing the RV game in
the absence of any good underlying stories,” Wilson said by e-mail today, referring to relative value.  Copper has climbed 8 percent from the April 23 close and
today reached $7,450 a metric ton, the highest since May 8,
while aluminum has dropped 1.3 percent. Some investors have been
short-covering, or buying copper to close out bets on falling
prices, according to Citigroup.  To contact the reporter on this story:
