Energy Development Corp. (EDC) , a
Philippines geothermal-energy developer, has formed a venture
with Alterra Power Corp. to develop four South America projects.  EDC will take a 70 percent stake in the venture in exchange
for providing $58.3 million for the Mariposa project in Chile
and $8 million for another three early-stage Peru projects,
Vancouver-based Alterra Power said today in a statement.  The Mariposa project is 300 kilometers (186 miles) south of
Santiago and exploration wells indicate that the site may
produce 320 megawatts of capacity, according to the statement.  Exploration activities at the Peru projects suggest they
contain “large geothermal resources,” Alterra Power said.  The venture was first announced on Oct. 16 and initially
included five Peru geothermal projects.  To contact the reporter on this story:
