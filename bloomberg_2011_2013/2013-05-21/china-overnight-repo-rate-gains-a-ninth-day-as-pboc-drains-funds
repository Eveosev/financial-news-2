China ’s overnight money-market rate
rose for a ninth day, the longest stretch since March, as the
central bank drained funds from the financial system.  The People’s Bank of China sold 10 billion  yuan  ($1.6
billion) of 91-day bills today at a yield of 2.9089 percent,
said a trader at a primary dealer required to bid at the
auctions. The PBOC also offered 9 billion yuan of 28-day
 repurchase agreements  at 2.75 percent, according to a statement
on its website. The central bank withdrew 35 billion yuan last
week after recommencing sales of the short-term securities on
May 9 for the first time since December 2011.  The  one-day  repurchase rate, a gauge of funding
availability, climbed 34 basis points to 3.38 percent as of
11:36 a.m. in Shanghai, according to the National Interbank
Funding Center. That’s the highest level since April 25.  “Tight liquidity will stay into month-end ahead” of the
three-day holiday for the Dragon Boat Day festival starting June
10, according to Wee-Khoon Chong, a Societe Generale SA
strategist in  Hong Kong .  A total of 158 billion yuan of repurchase agreements and
central bank bills are set to mature this week, which will
temper gains in market rates, according to  Frances Cheung , a
strategist at Credit Agricole CIB in Hong Kong.  “The drainage from open-market operations wasn’t much,
compared with the huge amount of maturing bills,” Cheung said.
“The repo rate is not too tight.”  The seven-day repo rate rose one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 4.39 percent. The one-year interest-rate
swap, the fixed cost to receive the seven-day repurchase rate,
climbed one basis point to 3.28 percent, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
