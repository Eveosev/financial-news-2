Technical colleges mustn’t lose sight
of their role in educating young people to get work, said Irish
Education Minister Ruairi Quinn.  “Part of your primary mission is to give young people a
set of skills that are appropriate for today’s modern work
place. They haven’t been doing that,” Quinn said in an
interview with Francine Lacqua and Manus Cranny on Bloomberg
Television’s “The Pulse” today. “You will know that there are
some people in our country who would regard that as a kind
prostitution” of education, he said.  Quinn, speaking from  Madrid , said that Ireland and southern
European countries should look to education systems in Germany
and  Austria  where youth unemployment is lower. Technical
colleges have drifted more toward liberal arts and university-type institutes, which is a “betrayal of their primary
mission,” he said.  Quinn said for some students there should be less of a
focus on academic education and more emphasis on technical
training to get a job.  To contact the reporter on this story:
