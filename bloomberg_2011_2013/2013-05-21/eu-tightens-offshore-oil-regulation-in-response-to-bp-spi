The European Union tightened safety
rules for offshore oil and natural-gas exploration to curb the
risk of a major accident after  BP Plc’s (BP/)  2010 spill in the Gulf
of Mexico, the largest in U.S. history.  The European Parliament approved legislation that forces
oil and gas companies to submit special hazard reports and
emergency-response plans before offshore operations can start.
The law also requires operators of offshore platforms to prove
their ability to cover potential liabilities and extends the
zone in which businesses would be liable for damage to 370
kilometers (230 miles) off the coast from the current 22
kilometers.  “The rules we are currently coming up with can be used as
a template at international level,” said Ivo Belet, a Belgian
member who steered the legislation through the 27-nation EU
assembly today in Strasbourg, France. EU governments have
already signaled support for the law, making their final
approval a formality in the coming weeks or months.  The tighter regulation marks the EU’s effort to improve
safety and bolster the “polluter pays” principle in the  energy
industry  following the  Gulf of Mexico  spill three years ago.
Eleven rig workers died and more than 4.1 million barrels of
crude gushed into the Gulf after the Deepwater Horizon rig
exploded and sank while drilling BP’s Macondo well off the
Louisiana coast.  The EU has almost 1,000 offshore oil installations,
including 486 in the U.K., 181 in the Netherlands and 61 in
 Denmark , the European Commission, the bloc’s regulatory arm in
Brussels, said when proposing the new rules in October 2011. The
average cost of offshore oil and gas accidents in the EU ranges
from 205 million euros ($264 million) to 915 million euros a
year, the commission said at the time.  Representatives of the  International Association of Oil and
Gas Producers  weren’t immediately reachable by telephone at the
group’s London and Brussels offices to comment on the new EU
legislation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
