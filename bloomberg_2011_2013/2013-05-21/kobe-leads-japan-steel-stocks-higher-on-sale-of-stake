Kobe Steel Ltd. (5406) , Japan’s third-biggest steelmaker, jumped 16 percent in Tokyo trading, leading
domestic rivals higher and extending yesterday’s gain after
saying it planned to sell its voting right stake in hydraulic
equipment maker  Nabtesco Corp. (6268)   Kobe Steel gained 23 yen to 171 yen at the 11:30 a.m.
trading break on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, heading for its
biggest gain since Oct. 14, 2008.  Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal
Corp. (5401)  rose 6.9 percent to 296 yen, while  JFE Holdings Inc. (5411) 
climbed 8.1 percent to 2,511 yen. The Topix Iron & Steel Index
was the biggest gainer by industry groups.  Kobe Steel plans to cut the holding in Tokyo-based Nabtesco
to zero from 11.8 percent with the price to be set as early as
May 27, Nabtesco said on May 17. Kobe Steel could book a 38
billion yen ($370 million) extraordinary gain in the year to
March 31, Jefferies  Japan  Ltd. analyst Thanh Ha Pham, said in a
report. Kobe in the 12 months ending March 31 is targeting its
 first annual profit  in three years by paring labor and materials
costs and selling assets.　  The share  gains  among Japanese steel companies also reflect
a broader move by foreign investors to buy laggard stocks as the
industry has underperformed the benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock
Average, said Shinya Yamada, an analyst at Credit Suisse
Securities Japan Ltd.  Nippon Steel & Sumitomo, Japan’s biggest steelmaker, has
risen 19 percent in the past three months, lagging the 36
percent increase for the Nikkei 225 index. 　  To contact the reporter on this story:
