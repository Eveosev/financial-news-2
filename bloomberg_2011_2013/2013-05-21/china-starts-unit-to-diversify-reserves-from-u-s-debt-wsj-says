China’s State Administration of
Foreign Exchange has set up an operation in New York to make
alternative investments in the U.S., the Wall Street Journal
reported, citing people it didn’t identify.  The new operation, which will focus on private equity, real
estate and other assets, is an effort by China’s  foreign-exchange reserves  manager to diversify away from  U.S. government
debt , the newspaper reported.  SAFE has sought to vary its portfolio in the past year by
buying European assets and Japanese stocks, the newspaper
reported, citing the unnamed people. Officials in recent weeks
met with Wall Street banks about potential investment
opportunities, according to the report. It’s not clear if any
deals have been signed, the publication said.  The agency, which also regulates the Chinese currency,
didn’t immediately reply to faxed questions today from  Bloomberg
News  seeking comment on the report.  China’s foreign-exchange reserves rose to $3.4 trillion at
the end of March. China Investment Corp., the nation’s sovereign
wealth fund set up in 2007 to seek higher returns on part of the
reserves, is adding stable-return assets including
infrastructure and real estate as it cuts an “over-reliance”
on  U.S. debt , then-Chairman  Lou Jiwei  told a forum in Hong Kong
in January. Lou was named finance minister in March.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
