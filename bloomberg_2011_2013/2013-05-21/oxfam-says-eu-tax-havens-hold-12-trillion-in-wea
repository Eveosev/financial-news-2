Tax havens under European Union
jurisdiction hold 9.5 trillion euros ($12 trillion) in global
offshore wealth that translates into $100 billion in lost
government revenue each year, according to a study released
today by Oxfam International.  The U.K. and its dependencies, such as the Cayman Islands
and Bermuda, account for about half of the total, Oxfam said in
a study released today to coincide with a meeting of EU leaders
in Brussels. The U.K.-based aid group cited Luxembourg, Andorra
and Malta as examples of the jurisdictions in its study.  “European leaders have absolutely no excuse not to act
when you see what proportion of this money is stashed right
under their noses in tax havens for which they are responsible,
Client ” said Natalia Alonso, head of Oxfam’s EU office, in a
statement.  Oxfam estimates that at least $18.5 trillion is hidden by
wealthy individuals in worldwide tax havens, based on its
analysis of data from the Bank of International Settlements, the
International Monetary Fund and national authorities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
