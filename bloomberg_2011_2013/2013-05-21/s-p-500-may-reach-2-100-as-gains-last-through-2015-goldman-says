Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said the
U.S. stock-market rally may last at least another 2 1/2 years,
sending the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  up 26 percent to 2,100.  David Kostin , the bank’s New York-based chief U.S. equity
strategist, raised forecasts for the U.S. equity benchmark,
predicting it will finish 2013 at 1,750 and 2014 at 1,900 as
stock valuations increase, according to a research report dated
yesterday. The  S&P 500   trades at  16.3 times reported operating
profit, 16 percent below the average since 1998, data compiled
by Bloomberg show.  “Our positive 2013 outlook for S&P 500 has played out much
faster than we expected,” Kostin wrote. “Reasons for a higher
multiple include increased confidence in the medium-term outlook
for U.S. economic growth, improving investor risk appetite and
the wide gap between equity and bond yields that we now assume
will be closed more by stocks than bonds.”  Goldman Sachs’s increase comes after  Thomas Lee , JPMorgan
Chase & Co.’s chief U.S. equity strategist, lifted his estimate
to 1,715 from 1,580 last week. The S&P 500 has surged 17 percent
in 2013 as companies  beat  earnings estimates and the Federal
Reserve continued its unprecedented bond-buying program known as
quantitative easing.  The equity benchmark gained 0.2 percent to 1,669.16 at 4
p.m. New York time today. The index has rallied 128 days without
a retreat exceeding 5 percent or more, the longest stretch since
the 173 days ending Feb. 20, 2007, data compiled by Bloomberg
show.  Dividend Growth  S&P 500 companies from Apple Inc. to Clorox Co. raised
dividends this year, giving the index a higher dividend increase
than earnings expansion for the first quarter, according to
Kostin. Dividends will rise 30 percent by 2015, with an 11
percent increase this year, adding about 150 points to the S&P
500, he said.  “Dividend growth has been pretty robust,” Kostin said in
a phone interview today. “A lot of companies with these super
high margins are distributing more cash to shareholders with
high dividends.”  Excess Returns  U.S. stocks are poised to gain during the next five years
thanks to record-low  interest rates  on  government bonds ,
according to researchers at the  Federal Reserve  Bank of New
York. A survey of 29 models for the equity risk premium -- the
expected future return of stocks over the risk-free rate offered
by Treasuries -- shows “we will enjoy historically high excess
returns for the S&P 500,” Fed economists Fernando Duarte and
Carlo Rosa said in a paper released on May 8. The premium rose
to a record 5.4 percent in December, they said.  The S&P 500 added 2.1 percent  last week , its fourth
straight weekly gain, as gauges of leading economic indicators
and consumer sentiment beat estimates. The U.S. bull market has
entered its fifth year, adding about $11.5 trillion in market
value, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “It’s certainly been a substantial and powerful move in
equity prices in a short period of time, there’s no question,”
Kostin said today. “This year, basically all that market move
has been valuation-driven,” he said. “The economy’s re-accelerating from a multi-year period of stagnation to an above-trend growth rate, and that would be consistent with P/E
expansion.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
