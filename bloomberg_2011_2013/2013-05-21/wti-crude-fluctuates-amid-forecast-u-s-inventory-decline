West Texas Intermediate declined for
the first time in five days as the dollar advanced against the
currencies of U.S. trading partners.  Futures dropped 0.6 percent as the  Dollar Index (DXY) , which
tracks the currency against six others, rose for the seventh
time in nine days, reducing the appeal of raw materials priced
in dollars. The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index of 24 commodities
fell 0.6 percent. Traders awaited a report on inventories and
Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke ’s testimony before
Congress, both scheduled for tomorrow.  “The stronger dollar is hitting commodities across the
board,” said Bill O’Grady, chief market strategist at
Confluence Investment Management in  St. Louis , which oversees
$1.4 billion. “We should continue to see commodities come under
pressure as the dollar climbs.”  WTI oil for June delivery fell 55 cents to settle at $96.16
a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . The contract,
which expired today, rose to $96.71 yesterday, the highest close
since April 2. The more active July WTI futures slipped 75
cents, or 0.8 percent, to $96.18. Volume for all contracts was
12 percent below the 100-day average for the time of day.  Prices were little changed after the  American Petroleum
Institute  reported that U.S. inventories gained 532,000 barrels
to 390.7 million. The July contract fell 98 cents to $95.95 a
barrel in electronic trading at 4:36 p.m. The contract traded at
$95.98 before the report was released at 4:30 p.m.  Brent Futures  Brent crude  for July settlement declined 89 cents, or 0.8
percent, to end the session at $103.91 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. Volume for all contracts was
39 percent lower than the 100-day average.  The European benchmark grade was at a premium of $7.73 to
WTI for the same month, down from $7.87 yesterday. The spread
was a record $25.53 on Nov. 15.  The Dollar Index rose as much as 0.6 percent to 84.20. On
May 17, the index reached 84.371, the most since July 2010. The
U.S. currency climbed as much as 0.4 percent against the euro.  “The market is being weighed down by the strong dollar,”
said  Addison Armstrong , director of market research at Tradition
Energy in Stamford,  Connecticut .  The Fed said May 1 it will keep buying bonds at the monthly
pace of $85 billion, while standing ready to raise or lower
purchases as conditions evolve. The  Bank of Japan  and  Bank of
England  have also purchased assets to bolster economic growth
while the  European Central Bank  cut  interest rates  to a record
low on May 2.  Fed Views  Federal Reserve Bank of New York President William C. Dudley said in prepared remarks for a speech today in New York
that he has not decided whether the Fed’s next move should be to
enlarge or shrink its bond buying program. Earlier today, St.
Louis Fed President  James Bullard  said the central bank should
continue bond buying because it’s the best available option for
policy makers to boost growth.  “The Fed was the first central bank to implement
unconventional stimulus and now others are catching up,”
O’Grady said. “The dollar weakened first and now other
currencies are following.”  Bernanke will speak before a congressional committee
tomorrow, the same day that minutes from the Fed’s last meeting
are released.  The Energy Information Administration may report tomorrow
that U.S. crude inventories fell by  1 million barrels  last week,
according to the median of 11 analyst estimates in a Bloomberg
survey. Stockpiles climbed to 395.5 million in the week ended
May 3, the most since 1931.  Fuel Stockpiles  Supplies of gasoline probably fell by  300,000 barrels  while
stockpiles of distillate fuel, a category that includes heating
oil and diesel, gained 1 million barrels, the survey showed.  Gasoline for June delivery dropped 5.98 cents, or 2.1
percent, to settle at $2.8458 a gallon on the Nymex. Volume was
21 percent above the 100-day average for the time of day.  The EIA, the Energy Department’s statistical arm, is
scheduled to release its weekly petroleum report at 10:30 a.m.
tomorrow in Washington.  “The market is balancing a lot of factors right now,”
said  Phil Flynn , a senior market analyst for Price Futures Group
in  Chicago . “We have both inventories and  Ben Bernanke  tomorrow
and it’s impossible to know what will be more important. We will
have to wait and see what produces the bigger surprise.”  Implied volatility for at-the-money WTI options expiring in
July was 20.6 percent, compared with 20.7 yesterday, data
compiled by Bloomberg showed.  Electronic trading volume on the Nymex was 456,218
contracts as of 4:35 p.m. It totaled 632,229 contracts in the
previous session, 8.4 percent above the three-month average.
Open interest was 1.74 million contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
