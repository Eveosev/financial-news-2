Ethanol strengthened against gasoline
amid record-low seasonal inventories and tumbling prices for the
motor fuel.  The spread, or price difference, narrowed 2.48 cents to
21.38 cents, as the most recent Energy Information
Administration supply report showed ethanol  stockpiles  at 16.4
million barrels in the week ended May 10, the lowest level since
December 2010.  “It’s pretty tight,” said Mike Blackford, a consultant at
INTL FCStone in  Des Moines ,  Iowa . “You get that low and you
compound that problem with logistical constraints.”  Denatured ethanol for June delivery fell 3.5 cents, or 1.3
percent, to $2.632 a gallon on the  Chicago  Board of Trade.
Futures have gained 20 percent this year.  Gasoline for June delivery dropped 5.98 cents, or 2.1
percent, to $2.8458 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The contract covers reformulated gasoline, made to be
blended with ethanol before delivery to filling stations.  Production of ethanol is also at below-average levels for
this time of year, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Output averaged 857,000 barrels a day in the week ended May
10, down 5.2 percent from a year earlier and 11 percent off the
record in December 2011, data from the Energy Department’s
analytical arm show.  A 2007 law requires refiners to use 13.8 billion gallons of
ethanol this year and 14.4 billion in 2014. Compliance with the
mandate is tracked by certificates known as RINs attached to
each gallon of biofuel. After blending with petroleum, companies
can keep the credit or trade it.  Ethanol Certificates  Corn-based ethanol Renewable Identification Numbers  for
2013, or RINs, added 3.5 percent to 89.5 cents as of 3:55 p.m.
 New York  time, data compiled by Bloomberg show, up from 7 cents
on Jan. 3. Advanced RINs, which cover biodiesel and Brazilian
sugarcane-based ethanol, climbed 3.2 percent to 97 cents, up
from 37 cents on Jan. 7.  Ethanol-blended gasoline made up 95 percent of the total
U.S. gasoline pool in the week ended May 10, down from a record
97 percent the previous week, according to EIA.  The department is scheduled to release the latest figures
tomorrow at 10:30 a.m. in  Washington .  Corn for July delivery fell 9.5 cents, or 1.5 percent, to
$6.40 a bushel in Chicago.  The corn crush spread for July was 17 cents, down from 18
cents yesterday. The spread was minus 35 cents on Dec. 31. The
amount doesn’t include revenue from the sale of dried
distillers’ grains, a byproduct of ethanol production, which can
be fed to livestock.  In cash market trading, ethanol decreased 4.5 cents to
$2.76 a gallon in New York, 1.5 cents to $2.64 in Chicago, 1
cent to $2.76 on the  Gulf Coast  and 2 cents to $2.785 on the
West Coast, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  West Coast ethanol’s premium to the Gulf narrowed 1 cent to
2.5 cents, while Chicago’s discount to New York Harbor narrowed
3 cents to 12 cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
