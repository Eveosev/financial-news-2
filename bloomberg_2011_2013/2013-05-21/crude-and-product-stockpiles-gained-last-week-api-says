also increased, gaining 3.03 million to 219.5 million.  Crude at Cushing, Oklahoma , the delivery point for futures
traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange, rose 471,000 barrels
to 50.1 million.  The Energy Information Administration, the Energy
Department’s statistical arm, is scheduled to release its
inventory report at 10:30 a.m. tomorrow in  Washington .  The government report may show supplies of oil decreased 1
million barrels last week, according to the median of 11
responses in a Bloomberg survey of analysts. Gasoline stockpiles
dropped 300,000 barrels and distillate inventories gained 1

from operators of refineries, bulk terminals and pipelines. The
government requires that reports be filed with the EIA for its
weekly survey.  Crude oil for July delivery fell $1, or 1 percent, to
