The U.S. pair of Phil Mickelson and
Keegan Bradley secured the first point in golf’s Ryder Cup
matches, defeating the European team of Luke Donald and Sergio Garcia.  Bradley and Mickelson rebounded from a 1-down deficit
through six holes to close out the match with a 4 and 3 score,
meaning they had an insurmountable four-hole lead with three
remaining at Medinah Country Club outside  Chicago .  It was the first loss for both Donald and Garcia in
foursomes play, where teammates play alternate shots.  “It was one of the most memorable days of my life so
far,” Bradley said in a televised interview.  The afternoon session will feature fourballs, in which each
golfer in the two-man teams plays his own ball, with the lowest
individual score winning the hole. The competition continues
through Sunday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
