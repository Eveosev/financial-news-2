Yields on Colombia’s peso bonds
fell to a record low amid speculation policy makers will lower
benchmark borrowing costs as soon as today to support growth in
the Andean economy.  The yield on the government’s 10 percent peso-denominated
bonds due in July 2024 fell one basis point, or 0.01 percentage
point, to 6.33 percent at 9:51 a.m. in Bogota, according to the
central bank, the lowest closing level since the debt was first
sold in 2009. The price rose 0.072 centavo to 129.863 centavos
per peso.  Colombia’s central bank will reduce the  overnight lending
rate  by a quarter-percentage point to 4.5 percent by year-end,
according to the median estimate of 29 analysts in a Citigroup
Inc. survey published Sept. 26. While 12 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg forecast a 25 basis-point cut at today’s meeting, 22
expect borrowing costs to remain unchanged.  “The market is seeing more rate cuts this year,” said Ana
Milena Franco, an analyst at Acciones y Valores brokerage in
Bogota. “The economy is showing signs of slowing and that
probably has the central bank worried.” She forecasts two
additional cuts this year, including one today, with the key
rate ending 2012 at 4.25 percent.  Banco de la Republica lowered the target lending rate in
August for a second straight month, reducing it by a quarter-
percentage point to 4.75 percent.  The peso fell 0.1 percent to 1,800.75 per U.S. dollar. The
currency has fallen 0.9 percent in the third quarter and rallied
7.6 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
