Overseas  investors  bought a net
 6.31 billion rupees  of Indian stocks yesterday, raising their
investment in the equities this year to 823.3 billion rupees, or
$15.9 billion, according to the nation’s market regulator.  Foreigners bought 55.1 billion rupees of shares and sold
48.8 billion rupees, the Securities & Exchange Board of India
said on its  website  today. They bought a net 1.09 billion rupees
of bonds, taking total inflow into debt this year to 251.4
billion rupees, the data  show .  The benchmark  BSE India Sensitive Index (SENSEX)  has increased 21.4
percent this year, helped by the biggest overseas equity flows
among 10 Asian markets tracked by Bloomberg, excluding  China .
Funds bought shares worth $3.6 billion this month, the highest
inflows since February, amid a burst of policy announcements
aimed at reviving an economy growing at near its slowest pace in
three years.  Foreigners have invested 5.267 trillion rupees in stocks
and 1.459 trillion rupees in bonds since they were allowed into
the country in 1993. Flows surged to a record in 2010, making
the Sensex the best performer among the world’s top 10 markets.
The largest-ever outflow in 2008 led the biggest annual slump of
52 percent.  The regulator provides data on shares bought and sold by
large investors, including trades in the primary and secondary
markets, with a delay of at least a day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
