Asian currencies had the best
quarter in two years after global policy makers announced plans
to pump money into financial markets to support growth, spurring
capital flows into higher-yielding assets.  The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia Dollar Index, which tracks the
region’s most-active currencies, rose 1.8 percent since June 30
as the Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the  Bank
of Japan (8301)  expanded bond-purchases programs to lower borrowing
costs.  China  will use “preemptive policy” to bolster growth in
Asia’s biggest economy, Premier Wen Jiabao said this month.
 India ’s rupee led gains, reaching a five-month high, and China’s
yuan surged to the highest since 1993.  “The underlying trend is still favorable for emerging
currencies going into 2013, due to interest-rate and growth
advantage over developed economies,” said Roy Teo, a senior
currency strategist in Singapore at ABN Amro Bank NV. “China’s
growth is slowing and further monetary stimulus including
interest-rate cuts can be expected.”  The rupee strengthened 5.3 percent this quarter to 52.86
per dollar in Mumbai, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Malaysia’s ringgit climbed 3.5 percent to 3.0620 and the won
closed 3.1 percent stronger at 1,111.38, near an 11-month high.
The  yuan  rose 1.1 percent to 6.2849 for its best quarter in
2012.  Fund Inflows  Investors pumped $9 billion into the stock markets of
India,  Indonesia , South  Korea  and  Taiwan  this month, exchange
data show. The Asia Dollar Index hit 117.35 yesterday, the
highest since March 9. The gauge’s 60-day  historical volatility 
fell to 2.70 percent from 3.46 percent on June 29. The MSCI  Asia
Pacific Index (MXAP)  of shares added 4.6 percent this quarter.  “With  Europe  and the U.S. taking a monetary-easing stance,
funds tend to move to bonds and stocks in Asia that offer higher
yields,” said Shigehisa Shiroki, chief trader on the Asian and
emerging-markets team at Mizuho Corporate Bank Ltd. in  Tokyo .  Asian currencies gained yesterday after Spain approved its
austerity budget, boosting optimism Europe is moving toward
resolving its debt crisis. Other reports showed factory
production in  Japan  and South Korea shrank in August from July.  “There were doubts on the progress of Europe’s debt
crisis, and Spain’s austerity budget news is a relief,” said
Jude Noh, Seoul-based chief currency trader at Suhyup Bank.  Won, Ringgit  The won rebounded from last quarter’s 1.1 percent slide as
Standard & Poor’s this month raised South Korea’s long-term
foreign-currency debt rating by one step to A+, the fifth-
highest level. Moody’s Investors Service and Fitch Ratings also
raised their rankings for Korea this quarter.  The yuan rallied before a weeklong National Day holiday
starting Oct. 1. The  Shanghai Composite (SHCOMP)  Index of shares jumped
4.1 percent in the past two days, on optimism policy makers plan
to unveil measures to boost growth and the equity market.  “Funds are flowing back into the market as people bet
China will soon act more aggressively to revive growth,” said
Kenix Lai, a Hong Kong-based foreign-exchange analyst at  Bank of
East Asia Ltd. (23)  “There’s always expectations the government will
announce important polices before or at the end of a long
holiday. The stock market is also rallying on stimulus bets.”  The ringgit gained as Prime Minister Najib Razak unveiled
Malaysia’s budget for 2013 in parliament yesterday.  Malaysian Budget  The $279 billion economy will expand between 4.5 percent
and 5.5 percent in 2013, compared with a projected 4.5 percent
to 5 percent this year, the Finance Ministry said in an annual
report released in Kuala Lumpur yesterday. It estimated the
budget deficit will narrow to 4 percent of gross domestic
product from 4.5 percent this year.  “Any attempt to streamline the Malaysian budget will be
seen to be positive for the ringgit and government bonds,” said
Vishnu Varathan, a Singapore-based economist at Mizuho Corporate
Bank Ltd.  Elsewhere, Thailand’s baht gained 3.1 percent this quarter
to 30.80 per dollar and Taiwan’s dollar advanced 1.9 percent to
NT$29.342. The Philippine peso rose 1.1 percent to 41.71 and
Indonesia’s rupiah weakened 1.7 percent to 9,589. Vietnam’s dong
weakened to 20,890 from 20,878.  To contact the reporter on this story:
