Russia started a criminal case
against Mirax Group managers for allegedly stealing 3.2 billion
rubles ($103 million) during construction of a housing complex,
 Kommersant  reported, citing the Russian police press service.  Mirax, which started building what was to be  Europe ’s
tallest skyscraper before the global financial crisis in 2008,
was dissolved in 2011 after defaulting on $442 million of debt.  Property developer Sergei Polonsky, the company’s
billionaire founder, fought with another billionaire,  Alexander Lebedev , during a television show last year. Lebedev faces a
possible prison sentence for the incident.  To contact the reporter on this story:
