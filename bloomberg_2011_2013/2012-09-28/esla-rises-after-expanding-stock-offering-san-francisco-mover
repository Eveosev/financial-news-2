Tesla Motors Inc., the electric-car
maker led by  Elon Musk , gained 2.8 percent after expanding a
stock offering.  Tesla rose to $29.28 at the close in  New York  after
reaching $29.89 earlier. The company, based in  Palo Alto ,
California, said in a regulatory filing today that it expects to
sell 6.93 million additional shares at $28.25 each, an increase
of 2.58 million from what it reported in a Sept. 25 filing. The
earlier filing didn’t list a price.  The company said it expects to receive net proceeds of
$192.7 million, or $221.6 million if the underwriter,  Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. (GS) , exercises its option to purchase additional
shares in full. Chief Executive Officer Musk, who this week
lowered the output forecast for the Model S sedan, said he will
purchase as many as 35,398 shares at a price of about $1
million.  “The quality and reviews of the Model S, the existence of
a multiple stage product plan beyond the Model S and Model X,
and the quality of the operation is behind the support for the
stock,” said Alan Baum, principal of auto-industry forecaster
Baum & Associates in West Bloomfield, Michigan.  Tesla (TSLA)  expects to deliver 200 to 225 Model S cars in the
third quarter and 2,500 to 3,000 in the fourth. The company’s
previous forecast was for 5,000 Model S deliveries this year.
Tesla is counting on demand for the Model S, which has a
starting price of $57,400, to help the automaker earn its first
quarterly profit. The Model X is a sport-utility vehicle planned
for 2014.  To contact the reporters on this story:
