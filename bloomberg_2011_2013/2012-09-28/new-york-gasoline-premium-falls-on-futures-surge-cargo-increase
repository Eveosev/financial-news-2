New York  gasoline fell to the
smallest premium to futures this month as October futures jumped
to a record gap over November, and on speculation cargo
shipments from  Europe  to the U.S. will increase.  October futures settled at a record 42.19 cents a gallon
over November as East Coast inventories were at at four-year
low, according to Energy Department data.  Traders and oil companies booked 16 tankers to carry
gasoline from Europe to the U.S. for the two weeks to Oct. 10,
up seven from last week’s total and the most shipments since
Sept. 12, according to Bloomberg surveys of shipbrokers and
traders.  The premium for reformulated, 87-octane  gasoline  in New
York Harbor dropped 18.5 cents to 6 cents a gallon versus
futures traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 3:22 p.m.,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt delivery for the
fuel gained 1.27 cents to 3.402 a barrel.  East Coast  stocks  of reformulated gasoline, or RBOB,
dropped to 13.7 million barrels last week, the lowest level
since Oct. 3, 2008.  East Coast inventories may rise from a four-year low as
Europe increase and as Delta Air Lines Inc.’s Trainer refinery
in  Pennsylvania  starts to produce fuel.  Delta’s Trainer refinery has restarted boilers and is “on
schedule” to restart, Trebor Banstetter, a company spokesman,
said in an e-mail responding to questions today.  Gulf Coast conventional 87-octane gasoline slipped 3.62
cents to 10.63 cents over November futures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
