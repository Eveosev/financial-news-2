Whirlpool Corp., the world’s
largest appliance maker, and  LG Electronics Inc. (066570)  agreed to
settle patent-infringement cases over refrigerator icemakers for
an undisclosed amount.  The settlement resolves three patent lawsuits filed in
federal courts in New Jersey and Delaware,  Benton Harbor ,
Michigan-based Whirlpool and Seoul-based LG said today in a
statement.  “This agreement, which concludes years of patent
litigation between LG and Whirlpool, will result in the
dismissal” of the cases, the companies said.  A Delaware jury found in 2010 that LG infringed a Whirlpool
icemaker patent and awarded $1.78 million in damages. U.S.
District Judge Gregory M. Sleet in Wilmington questioned the
jury’s calculations and ordered a new trial. Whirlpool had
sought more than $22 million in damages.  Last year, Whirlpool said it won a six-month stay of patent
litigation over refrigerator technology while it challenged the
validity of LG’s patents at the U.S. Patent and Trademark
Office.  Whirlpool fell 25 cents to $83.23 in  New York  Stock
Exchange composite trading at 2:27 p.m. LG dropped 300 won to
69,000 won in Seoul.  One case resolved by the settlement is LG Electronics v.
 Whirlpool Corp. (WHR) , 08-cv-234, U.S. District Court, District of
Delaware (Wilmington).  To see the patent, click: 6,082,130.  To contact the reporter on this story:
