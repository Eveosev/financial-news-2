DKSH Holding AG (DKSH)  may consider paying
a special dividend if the company accumulates too much cash,
Chief Executive Officer Joerg Wolle told  Finanz und Wirtschaft 
in an interview to be published tomorrow.  The company expects 2012 to be a record year with profit of
at least 10 percent, the newspaper cited Wolle as saying. DKSH
also aims to grow at least 8 percent annually until 2015, while
profit may post double-digit growth rates, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
