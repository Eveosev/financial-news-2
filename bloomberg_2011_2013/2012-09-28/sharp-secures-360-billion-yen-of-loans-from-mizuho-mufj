Sharp Corp. (6753) , the Japanese TV maker
cutting more than 10,000 jobs as it tries to return to profit,
secured 360 billion yen ($4.6 billion) of funding, according to
a statement to the Tokyo Stock Exchange today.  Sharp will get a 180 billion yen loan from Mizuho Corporate
Bank Ltd. and the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd., according
to the statement. Another 180 billion yen in the form of a
revolving credit facility due in June will also be extended to
Osaka-based Sharp, the statement said.  Reeling from record losses and in talks to sell a stake to
 Taiwan ’s Foxconn Technology Group, the maker of Aquos
televisions submitted cost-cutting proposals to the banks on
Sept. 24, two people with knowledge of the matter told Bloomberg
earlier this week. The company had 706 billion yen of short-term
debt and 314 billion yen in long-term debt with cash and near-
cash of 218 billion yen at the end of June.  Both loans have a claim on Sharp’s assets and the revolver
replaces a 150 billion yen credit arrangement put in place last
month, a person familiar with the matter said yesterday. Sharp
used a stake in  Pioneer Corp. (6773)  and its company headquarters as
collateral for the 150 billion yen loan, Tokyo-based spokeswoman
 Miyuki Nakayama  said by telephone yesterday.  Japan ’s biggest maker of liquid-crystal panels has already
put up its Osaka headquarters and some factories as debt
collateral, Sharp said Sept. 6. Its  credit rating  has been cut
to junk by  Standard & Poor’s  and Moody’s Investors Service.  Pledged Shares  Sharp reduced its stake in Pioneer to 9.2 percent from 14.3
percent and pledged 15 million Pioneer shares each to Mizuho and
Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ as collateral, according to a Sept.
3 filing to Japan’s  Finance Ministry .  Falling demand for televisions and Japan’s stronger yen
prompted Japan’s largest maker of liquid-crystal displays in
August to widen its projected loss for the year ending March
2013 eightfold to 250 billion yen, compared with a 30 billion
yen loss estimate three months earlier.  That projection has helped push the stock 71 percent lower
for the year. The shares fell 0.5 percent to 198 yen as of 9:52
a.m. in Tokyo trading today. Sharp’s 200 billion yen of
convertible bonds  due Sept. 30 next year rose 1.5 percent to 70
yen for 100 yen face value.  To contact the reporters on this story:
