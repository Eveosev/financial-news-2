U.K. exports of food and non-
alcoholic beverages rose 2.2 percent in the first half, helped
by gains outside the European Union, the Food and Drink
Federation said.  Shipments climbed to 5.96 billion pounds ($9.7 billion)
from 5.84 billion pounds a year earlier, the London-based trade
group said today in a  report  on its website. Exports increased
7.2 percent for countries outside the EU and rose 0.7 percent
within the bloc, which buys 76 percent of total shipments.  The smaller increase in sales to the EU was “largely due
to the euro-zone debt crisis, which has resulted in sharp falls
in exports to some key markets, namely France and  Italy ,” the
federation said.  U.K. shipments of cereal and bakery products increased 6.3
percent to 1.05 billion pounds, and sales of other prepared
foods rose 1.6 percent to 1.46 billion pounds, the group said.
Sales of meat products dropped 0.4 percent to 819 million pounds
as exports of sugar and sugar confectionery goods fell 3.3
percent to 184 million pounds.  Exports to Ireland, the biggest buyer of U.K. food and
beverage products, rose 0.9 percent and shipments to  France , the
second-largest, slid 7.1 percent. Sales to Italy, which ranks
eighth, dropped 13 percent.  The industry group represents food and beverage producers
from Twinings, the tea brand owned by Associated British Foods
Plc, to United Biscuits Holdings Plc, the maker of  Carr’s  and
Jacob’s crackers, according to its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
