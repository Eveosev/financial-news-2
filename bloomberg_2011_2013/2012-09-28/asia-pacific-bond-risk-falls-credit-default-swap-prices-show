The cost of insuring Asia-Pacific
corporate and sovereign bonds from default decreased, according
to traders of credit-default swaps.  The  Markit iTraxx Asia  index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan declined 1 basis point to 137 basis
points as of 8:13 a.m. in  Hong Kong ,  Credit Agricole SA (ACA)  prices
show. The gauge has dropped 16 basis points this month, 33 since
June 30, and 69 since the start of the year, CMA prices show.  The  Markit iTraxx Australia  index fell 2 to 158 as of 10:13
a.m. in Sydney, according to  Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC)  The measure
has retreated 11.5 basis points this month, 27.6 this quarter
and 22.5 this year, according to data provider CMA, which is
owned by CME Group Inc. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in
the privately negotiated market.  The  Markit iTraxx Japan  index decreased 2 to 219 as of 9:52
a.m. in Tokyo, Citigroup Inc. prices show. The benchmark has
climbed 8 this month, extending the increase this quarter to 41
and this year to 32, CMA prices show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
