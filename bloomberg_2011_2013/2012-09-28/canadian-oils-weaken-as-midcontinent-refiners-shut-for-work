Canadian oils weakened as U.S.
Midcontinent refiners began shutting units for maintenance,
reducing demand.  Phillips 66 (PSX)  was closing units including a 64,000-barrel-a-
day crude plant at its Wood River  refinery  in Illinois Sept. 25,
according to  Genscape Inc ., an energy information provider.  CVR
Energy Inc. (CVI)  started work at its Wynnewood  refinery  in  Oklahoma ,
Bud Ramming, Garvin County emergency management director, said
in a telephone interview Sept. 26.  The discount to West Texas Intermediate for Western Canada
Select, a heavy oil blend from  Alberta , narrowed $1.50 to $11.50
a barrel at 3:58 p.m. in  New York , according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Syncrude’s premium to the U.S. benchmark narrowed $1
to $9 a barrel.  Bakken oil’s premium gained $2.50 to $4.75 a barrel.  On the U.S. Gulf Coast, Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium
added 95 cents to $21.15 a barrel. Light Louisiana Sweet
increased 10 cents to $20 over WTI.  Poseidon’s  premium  gained 55 cents to $14.55. Mars Blend
added 35 cents to $14.75 a barrel over WTI and Southern Green
Canyon was unchanged at $12.75.  The premium for  Thunder Horse , a sour crude with lower
sulfur content than Mars, Poseidon and Southern Green Canyon,
widened 90 cents to $18.25 above WTI.  To contact the reporter on this story:
