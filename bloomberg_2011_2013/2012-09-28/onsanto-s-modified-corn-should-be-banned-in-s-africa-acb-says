Monsanto Co. (MON) ’s genetically
engineered NK603 corn is hazardous to the health, said  South
Africa ’s  African Centre for Biosafety , which called on the
authorities to ban its cultivation, import and export.  “We urge the South African government to take the
necessary steps to protect its citizens,” the ACB said in a
letter to the minister of agriculture, forestry and fisheries.
The modified corn has been shown to cause tumors as well as
liver and kidney damage in laboratory rats, it said.  White corn is a staple food in South Africa, where
genetically modified plants accounted for 80 percent of the
harvest last year, according to the International Grains
Council. Monsanto’s NK603 corn has been the subject of a two-
year French study, which found that rats fed on it developed
tumors and organ deficiencies, a  draft  shows.  The study “does not meet minimum acceptable standards for
this type of scientific research,” Thomas Helscher, a spokesman
for St. Louis-based Monsanto, said in an e-mail. The methods
used don’t conform to Organization for Economic Co-Operation and
Development standards, the source and quality of the corn are
unclear and details on dietary intake absent, he said.  France  asked its national food-security agency, Anses, to
examine the study last week. In  Russia , the government has
suspended sales of NK603 corn pending further information,
consumer watchdog Rospotrebnadzor said Sept. 24.  South Africa’s health and agricultural ministries didn’t
respond to requests for comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
