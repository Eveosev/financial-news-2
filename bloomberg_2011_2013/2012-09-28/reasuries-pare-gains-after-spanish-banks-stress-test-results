Treasuries pared gains after a
report showed Spainâ€™s banks have a combined capital shortfall of
59.3 billion euros, less than some traders speculated.  ``It's the realization that it wasn't as bad as expected,'' said Jason
Rogan, director of U.S. government trading at Guggenheim Partners LLC,
a New York-based brokerage for institutional investors, ``There were
early rumors circulating that it could be as much as 150 billion euros.''  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
