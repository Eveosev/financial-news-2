The U.S. pair of  Phil Mickelson  and
Keegan Bradley won for the second time today at golf’s Ryder
Cup, defeating Northern Irishmen Rory McIlroy and Graeme McDowell in an afternoon foursomes match.  Bradley and Mickelson won 2 and 1, meaning they had an
insurmountable two-hole lead with one hole remaining at Medinah
Country Club outside Chicago.  The U.S. leads the matches 4-2.  In fourballs, each of the two men on the teams plays his
own ball -- with the lowest individual score winning the hole
for the team.  The U.S. duo beat the European team of England’s Luke Donald and Spain’s  Sergio Garcia  in their morning foursomes
match, in which players alternate shots using the same ball. It
was the first time Donald or Garcia lost a foursomes match.  The U.S. and  Europe  were tied 2-2 after this morning’s
matches. The competition continues through Sept. 30, when there
will be 12 singles matches.  To contact the reporter on this story:
