Lightning sparked a fire at a power
station in  Azerbaijan  today, knocking out supply throughout the
Caspian Sea nation and halting the operation of Baku’s
refineries for two hours.  The lightning struck the power plant in the city of
Mingacevir at 6:55 a.m. local time, Azerenerji, the local
utility, said on its website. Power supply has been fully
restored across the country, it said.  State Oil Co. of Azerbaijan halted its two Baku refineries
during the  power failure , while oil production wasn’t affected,
company spokesman Nizamaddin Quliyev said by phone.  Socar operates the Baku and New Baku refineries in the
Azeri capital, with capacities of 230,000 barrels a day and
212,000 barrels a day, respectively, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
