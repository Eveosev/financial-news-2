Senator  Richard Lugar , the leading
Republican foreign-policy expert in Congress, said in an
interview with Bloomberg Television’s “Political Capital with
 Al Hunt ,” airing this weekend, that President  Barack Obama  is
following the right policy in Iran and warned of the dangers of
war.  (This is not a legal transcript. Bloomberg LP cannot

Indiana. Thank you so much for joining us, Senator.  RICHARD LUGAR: Thank you, Al.  HUNT: Senator, the courageous ambassador to Libya, Chris
Stevens, who was killed two weeks ago, is a former staffer of
yours. Was this a security lapse?  Should we have known about
this attack?  LUGAR: I don’t think it was a lapse. It just wasn’t very
much security there in Benghazi, which I think is evident now as
they’re making longer studies of it. But I think Chris Stevens
was aware there was not much security, from at least the diary
that they have uncovered.  I think that’s the problem, however, really throughout our
situation in  Libya . It’s a situation of attempting to build
security and trying to work with the Libyans on their security.
In fairness, they have been trying to do a much job of it, too.  HUNT: But shouldn’t we have done more?  LUGAR: Of course. When it finally comes down to it, all of
our embassies and consulates should be secure. This particular
situation, it looked like it was almost an improvised building,
along with the other four that were to be associated with it and
just sort of getting under way in terms of our representation
there.  HUNT: Senator, do you think al-Qaeda was involved in this
attack?  LUGAR: It appears that there were some members of al-Qaeda
who were informing one of the militias. I don’t know whether the
count of 18 militias in Libya is correct, but most Americans
don’t understand that even though there is a new government
there, it’s not been accepted maybe by these 18 groups of people
who are armed.  Now, afterwards, to the credit of the Libyan people, I
understand that Benghazi, Libyan citizens overwhelmed two of the
militias, took their arms away, terminated two maybe of the 18,
but I hope the Libyan government is going to proceed in this
way. They apparently are trying to do so.  HUNT: And they’re cooperating with the FBI and us?  LUGAR: Yes, they are. But at the same time, after that war
or whatever with Qaddafi, a lot of arms got away.  HUNT: Right.  LUGAR: We’ve had people in Libya ever since trying to track
down all sorts of armament that were a part of that situation
that fell into the hands either of militia or, worse, other
countries.  HUNT: Senator, let me switch the subject. Did President
Obama make a mistake by not meeting with world leaders at the UN
this week?  LUGAR: I think he did. I understand, as a campaigner in
various elections that I’ve had, the pressures that are on you
for - the appearances around the country, the fundraisers, all
the party functions and so forth. And he is a candidate for re-
election, and it’s a close election.  At the same time, you’re president of the  United States .
It’s almost the same burden if you were a senator. And the
Congress keeps meeting, and you’ve got people back home who are
saying, where are you?  We haven’t seen you.  LUGAR: And it’s a question of many - most of us sort of do
our duty. We’re there for the roll call votes and for the
meetings with foreign leaders and all the rest. I think when the
UN meets - but I think there may be another factor here, and I’m
not trying to impugn motives. The difficulty of the president
meeting with these leaders is each one of them comes filled with
various controversies.  And so, for example, if he had met with  Benjamin Netanyahu 
or - not certainly whatever - meet with the Libyan president,
but with any of these folks, then this raises all sorts of
questions in the campaign. And he might count upon his opponent,
Mitt Romney, to point out how badly he handled the meeting or
how badly our relations are or what have you.  HUNT: Speaking of that, the drumbeats of war are sounding
again. This time, it’s Iran. And Mitt Romney says that this
president has been soft, he hasn’t been nearly tough enough and
nearly supportive enough of  Israel  - of the Israelis.  LUGAR: Well, and Benjamin Netanyahu would agree, as he went
-  HUNT: What is - what is -  LUGAR:  -  before the U.N. and -  HUNT: What if Senator Lugar -  LUGAR:  -  had his chart. I think that the idea of moving
with our allies, as many as we can find, on effective sanctions
on the country has been the right move. This doesn’t obviate for
a moment our intelligence services keeping track, really, of how
far the centrifuges are going and how much enrichment is
occurring. It doesn’t really detract - and I’m not ascribing
either praise or blame to anybody - for people using cyber
warfare to slow it down altogether in means that we would not
have thought of.  HUNT: So you think the policy is about right?  LUGAR: Yes.  HUNT: You do?  LUGAR: I think it’s very important that we understand that,
because very clearly, I understand we want to draw red lines.  HUNT: Right.  LUGAR: I understand even some wanting to go to war
immediately to stop it where it is and so forth. But even within
Israel, the reports are that the debate with Netanyahu is very
intense. The military is saying, hang on here. You know, leaving
aside a unilateral attack without American approval or support,
the fact is, we’re really going to have hell to pay. They will
come back on us, and the implications for the Israeli people
here are very severe.  HUNT: Let me switch to  China .  Mitt Romney  said, if he’s
elected, on day one, he’ll declare China a currency manipulator
and get tough and force them to back down on their trade
policies. Is that a good approach?  LUGAR: Well, I think it’s a very broadside situation which
is shared by many people in manufacturing industries or others
who always have felt the Chinese currency has been too
competitively valued arbitrarily by them. At the same time, the
Chinese right now are very unhappy over Chairman Bernanke’s
views at the QE3 program, the United States pouring more and
more currency into our banking system, because they claim that
is undermining the Chinese competitive situation. So we’re
getting protests from the Chinese that we’re undercutting their
currency in the process.  HUNT: So would it be a productive or a non-productive
policy to declare them a currency manipulator?  LUGAR: Oh, I think it’s a campaign mode -  HUNT: As opposed to a serious policy?  LUGAR: Yeah. And if you had a serious policy - after all,
people have been condemning the Chinese for their arbitrary
situation for a long time. So it’s not a new argument, but it’s
one that has some fervor with people who believe this gives a
competitive disadvantage to us. And it does, in some industries,
without any doubt. All I’m saying is that, whatever the
disadvantage is, it’s being narrowed bit by bit, and in some
cases, a big way by Bernanke presently.  HUNT: Senator, you are the Republican’s foremost foreign
policy expert in the Congress.  LUGAR: That’s a very generous assessment.  HUNT: I think most people agree. And yet it seems to me, on
a lot of big issues, you really fundamentally disagree with your
party’s nominee. You disagree with him, what he said about
Russia being our main adversary. You disagree with him on  Iran ,
saying the administration ought to get tougher, disagree on
China currency. It seems the so-called neocons, the old Cheney-
Rumsfeld people, are really his top advisers. Does that worry
you?  LUGAR: Well, some of the neocons are there, but there are
other persons, as I understand, that are not neocons.  HUNT: But they tend to be dominant. The neocons tend to be
dominant.  LUGAR: Well, perhaps, but I just look at this way, and that
is that  Governor Romney  has not had a great chance to study all
of these issues. He is trying to pick up advice on the fly,
trying to pick up campaign slogans or something that might sell
in a particular state or situation. I have much greater faith in
his overall intelligence, his comprehension of the world, once
he actually has the responsibility.  HUNT: Will you stay out of the  Indiana  Senate race?  LUGAR: Yes.  HUNT: You will?  You’re not going to change your mind on
that?  LUGAR: No, I’m not - not a factor.  HUNT: Senator, an extraordinary 36 years’ service in the
Senate. Thank you so much for joining us, and I hope -  LUGAR: Thank you, Al.  ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***  THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN
