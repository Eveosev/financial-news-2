U.K. government bonds rose, posting
a second weekly gain, as speculation the Spanish government’s
fifth austerity package will fail to resolve the nation’s debt
crisis boosted demand for safer assets.  Ten-year  yields  fell to the lowest level in more than two
weeks before  Spain  reveals the results of stress tests on its
banks. The pound weakened against all of its 16 major
counterparts tracked by Bloomberg. Sterling fell for the first
time this week against the euro on speculation its four-day
advance was excessive.  “Nervousness about the situation in Spain remains pretty
close to the surface, even after the budget” released
yesterday, said  John Wraith , a fixed-income strategist at Bank
of America Merrill Lynch in  London . That “typically knocks onto
lower yields for gilts because of safe-haven flows.”  The 10-year gilt yield dropped two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 1.72 percent at 4:19 p.m. London time after
falling to 1.68 percent, the lowest since Sept. 10. The 1.75
percent bond due in September 2022 rose 0.14, or 1.40 pounds per
1,000-pound ($1,620) face amount, to 100.31. The yield has
fallen 12 basis points this week.  Gilts returned 1 percent this quarter through yesterday,
according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. German bunds gained
1.1 percent and U.S. Treasuries rose 0.5 percent.  Spain Budget  Spanish Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy ’s government yesterday
announced a 13 billion-euro ($16.8 billion) package of spending
cuts, and a new tax on lottery winnings in an effort to shrink
the euro area’s third-largest budget deficit.  The Bank of Spain said this week early indicators suggest
gross domestic product is still falling at a “significant
pace” after the recession deepened in the second quarter.  The release of the results of the independent  stress test 
conducted by consulting firm  Oliver Wyman  will reveal the size
of the hole in the Spanish banking system, which is reeling from
a property crash, prompting the country to agree a 100 billion-
euro bailout in July.  Sterling has gained 2.7 percent versus the dollar this
quarter, its biggest advance since the three months ended March.  The pound dropped 0.2 percent to 79.68 pence per euro after
appreciating to 79.24 pence yesterday, the strongest level since
Sept. 6. The currency fell 0.7 percent to $1.6113, the weakest
since Sept. 13.  U.K. Data  The pound weakened today even as GfK said its  index of U.K.
 consumer confidence  rose one point in September to minus 28, a
15-month high. The gauge had held at minus 29 for the previous
four months.  A separate report showed Britain’s  services  industry
expanded at its fastest pace for more than a year in July,
adding to evidence that the economy returned to growth in the
third quarter.  Services, which account for about three quarters of the
economy, grew 1.1 percent from June, when the sector fell 1.5
percent, the  Office for National Statistics  said in London
today. It was the biggest increase since May 2011.  The pound is little changed in the past three months,
according to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes, which track
10 developed-market currencies. The euro fell 0.7 percent and
the dollar slumped 4.1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
