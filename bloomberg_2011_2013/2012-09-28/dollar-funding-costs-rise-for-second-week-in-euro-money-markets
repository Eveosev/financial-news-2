The cost for European banks to
borrow in dollars is heading for the second weekly increase
since July, according to a money-markets indicator.  The three-month cross-currency  basis swap , the rate banks
pay to convert euro interest payments into dollars, was 25 basis
points below the euro interbank offered rate at 8:20 a.m. in
 London  compared with minus 21 on Sept. 21, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The cost reached a 15-month low of minus
17 on Sept. 13 after 10 weeks of declines.  The one-year basis swap was 25 basis points, or 0.25
percentage point, below Euribor from minus 27 yesterday.  A measure of European banks’ reluctance to make unsecured
loans to one another held at the lowest since March 2011. The
difference between Euribor and overnight index swaps, the
Euribor-OIS spread, was little changed at 13.9 basis points.  The European Banking Federation’s euro overnight index
average, or Eonia, of unsecured lending deals was set at 0.095
percent yesterday from 0.096 percent the day before. The Eonia
swap, an estimate of average overnight borrowing costs over the
next three months, was 8.5 basis points from 8.7 yesterday.  Lenders cut  overnight deposits  at the European Central Bank
yesterday to the lowest since Aug. 8. Banks placed 289 billion
euros ($374 billion) with the Frankfurt-based central bank from
308 billion euros the day before.  To contact the reporter on this story:
