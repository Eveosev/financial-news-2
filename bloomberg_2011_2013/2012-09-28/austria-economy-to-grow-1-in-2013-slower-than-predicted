Austria’s economy is expected to
expand 1 percent next year, slower than the 1.3 percent
predicted in June, the state-supported Wifo research institute
said today.  This is Wifo’s second consecutive reduction of its 2013
forecast, with the institute initially having predicted 1.4
percent growth.  Wifo left its forecast for gross-domestic-product growth
unchanged at 0.6 percent for this year, according to an e-mailed
statement today.  Even after cutting its guidance for 2013, “Austria’s 1
percent growth rate still will be one of the driving forces in
the euro area,” Wifo said in the statement. The country’s
“economy can’t quite decouple itself from the international
dynamics and this is reflected in the stagnation of exports
since mid-2011,” it said. “However, unlike the 2009 crisis,
domestic demand has remained relatively stable.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
