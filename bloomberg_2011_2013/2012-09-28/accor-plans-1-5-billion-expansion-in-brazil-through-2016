Accor SA (AC) , Europe’s largest hotel
operator, plans a $1.5 billion expansion in Brazil to lift the
number of properties run under its brands there to 250 in the
next four years.  Accor will open about 25 hotels a year to take advantage of
Brazil’s growing middle class and increased tourism as the
country hosts soccer’s World Cup in two years and the 2016
 Olympic Games , the Paris-based company said in an e-mailed
statement today.  The company agreed in July to acquire hotel operator Grupo
Posadas for $275 million, an acquisition that would add 19
existing or planned hotels to the 153 that it already operates
directly or through franchises in Brazil. Accor has opened 11
hotels in the Latin American nation this year and another 11 are
scheduled to open before the end of 2012, adding a total of
3,068 rooms.  Chief Executive Officer  Denis Hennequin  is accelerating
Accor’s expansion in Latin America and the Asia-Pacific region
by offering franchises of the group’s Sofitel, Novotel and Ibis
brands. He has sold buildings and leased them back, allowing
Accor to pay debt and avoid tying up capital in property.
Management and franchise fees rose 20 percent to 233 million
euros in the first half, the company  reported  in July.  To contact the reporter on this story:
