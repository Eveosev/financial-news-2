Energetix Group Plc (EGX) , a U.K. maker
of energy efficiency products run by a former Dyson Ltd.
executive, raised 12 million pounds ($19.4 million) issuing
shares as it seeks to start sales of its boilers next year.  Energetix issued 42.86 million shares at 28 pence each to
existing and new investors, the Chester, England-based company
said today in a statement. The company also plans to raise a
further 2 million pounds by selling 7.09 million shares through
an “open offer” to private investors.  Energetix will use the funds to develop its micro-combined
 heat-and-power  boilers ready for sale in the second half of next
year. Britain’s government encourages so-called distributed
generation, where power is produced by small-scale generators,
with feed-in tariffs as it seeks to curb emissions.  Energetix, whose chief executive officer  Peter Richardson 
joined from Dyson, plans to sell its Kingston boiler model for
800 pounds when produced at high volume, according to the
statement. The U.K. is  Europe ’s largest gas boiler market with
about 1.4 million installed each year, according to Energetix.  Energetix, with three business units, today posted a loss
before tax of 2.46 million pounds for the first half compared
with a 1.66 million-pound loss for the same period last year.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
