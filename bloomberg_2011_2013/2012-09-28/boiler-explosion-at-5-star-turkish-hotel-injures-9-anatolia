A heating boiler explosion at a
five-star Mediterranean hotel injured nine Turkish citizens
today, Anatolia reported, without citing anyone.  The blast, which occurred during the installation of a
laundry machine, knocked down at least two walls in the basement
of the hotel in the resort town of Kemer in the Antalya
province, the state-run  news agency  said.  The injured included five hotel staff and four workers who
were installing the machine, Anatolia said. Three of the injured
were in serious condition, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
