Zouk Capital LLP, a London-based
private equity firm, invested in  Lighting Science Group Corp. (LSCG)  as
the Florida-based maker of energy-efficient lighting seeks to
reach profitability and boost sales.  An unspecified sovereign wealth fund from the Middle East
also added to the $49 million equity investment, Lighting
Science, based in Satellite Beach, said in a  statement .  LED lighting uses light-emitting diodes which are more
efficient than traditional fluorescent and incandescent lamps.
Energy efficiency equipment is attracting private equity
investors such as  Italy ’s Ambienta SGR SpA and London-based
Impax Asset Management Group Plc as power demand rises on the
back of increased affluence in  emerging markets .  The latest financing, the last portion of a $168 million
equity program, will help Lighting Science “achieve
profitability” and speed up new product sales, according to the
statement. California-based Riverwood Capital LLC and Lighting
Science’s major shareholder Pegasus Capital Advisors LP, based
in New York, contributed to the previous funding rounds.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
