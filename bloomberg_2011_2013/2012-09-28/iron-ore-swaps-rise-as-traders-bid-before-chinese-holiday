Iron-ore swaps rose as traders
sought to secure contracts before next week’s holidays in  China ,
according to Clarkson Securities Ltd., a unit of the world’s
largest shipbroker.  Fourth-quarter contracts increased 1.4 percent to $106.50 a
metric ton as of 2 p.m. in  London , Clarkson data show. That’s
the highest since Sept. 19.  Traders are bidding before markets in China, the world’s
largest importer of the commodity used to make steel, close for
the Golden Week holiday, said Alex Gray, chief executive officer
of Clarkson Securities in London. Speculation of further
government stimulus is also supporting prices, he said by phone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
