Malaysia’s ringgit rose toward a
four-month high as Prime Minister Najib Razak pledged to reduce
the budget deficit next year.  The government forecasts the shortfall will narrow to 4
percent of gross domestic product in 2013 from 4.5 percent, with
spending expected at 249.7 billion ringgit ($81.6 billion),
according to the Ministry of Finance’s 2012/2013 economic report
released today.  Spain  announced yesterday a 13 billion euro
($16.8 billion) austerity package to tackle the euro area’s
third-biggest budget deficit.  “Any attempt to streamline the Malaysian budget will be
seen to be positive for the ringgit and government bonds,” said
 Vishnu Varathan , a Singapore-based economist at Mizuho Corporate
Bank Ltd. “People are hoping Spain’s budget rationalization for
2013 is a warm-up toward the  European Central Bank  buying
Spanish bonds and will lead to Spain asking for a bailout.”  The ringgit climbed 0.5 percent to 3.0570 per dollar as of
5:10 p.m. in  Kuala Lumpur , the biggest gain in a week, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. It touched 3.0565 earlier, near
the 3.0333 reached Sept. 14 that was the strongest since May 4.  The currency declined 0.2 percent this week, paring its
monthly advance to 2 percent and its quarterly gain to 3.7
percent. One-month implied volatility, a measure of exchange-
rate swings used to price options, dropped 20 basis points, or
0.20 percentage point, to 7.10 percent.  Gross domestic product may expand 4.5 percent to 5.5
percent next year after rising as much as 5 percent in 2012, the
ministry said in its report.  The yield on the 3.314 percent notes due October 2017 rose
two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 3.32 percent,
according to Bursa Malaysia. The yield climbed two basis points
for the week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
