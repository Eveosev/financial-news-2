Great Portland Estates Plc’s (GPOR) 
venture with  Capital & Counties Properties Plc (CAPC)  sold two
properties on Regent Street,  London ’s second-most expensive
shopping strip, for 112.6 million pounds ($183 million).  Great Capital Partnership, focused on the West End district
in central London, sold Regent Arcade House to Stenham Property
Ltd. for 48 million pounds, according to a statement today.
Hermes Real Estate Investment Management agreed to buy 100
Regent Street for 64.6 million pounds.  The partnership, formed when Capital & Counties was the
London arm of Liberty International, owned properties valued at
540 million pounds at the end of the first half of 2010. CapCo
became a separate company in the breakup of Liberty that year
and the partnership has been selling assets to take advantage of
demand for central London real estate.  The  West End  is central London’s hub for restaurants,
theaters and fashion retail. The attraction of its location and
a shortage of space through planning constraints mean that prime
office rents are the most expensive in the capital, attracting
investors from home and overseas seeking a secure, regular
income.  To contact the reporter on this story:
