Ben Mogil, entertainment analyst at
Stifel Nicolaus & Co., cut his estimate for fourth-quarter box-
office sales, saying cinemas will have trouble exceeding last
year’s numbers.  “While there remains the chance to have a stronger box
office should there be some sleeper hits, given the current
malaise at the box office it is difficult to feel comfortable
with that view,” Mogil wrote today in a note to investors.  Mogil forecasts a 3 percent rise for the period, down from
5 percent to 6 percent previously, led by “The Hobbit: An
Unexpected Journey,” and said others expect a mid-to-high
single-digit percentage gain. Studios and  theater operators  have
struggled to stay ahead of last year’s pace, when attendance
shrank to a 16-year low. Through Sept. 23, ticket sales at U.S.
and Canadian cinemas are up 2.5 percent to $7.92 billion while
attendance is ahead 1.3 percent.  Sales in last year’s fourth quarter declined 5.4 percent,
Mogil wrote. There were seven films that collected more than $85
million in the period. Among cinema operators, Mogil recommends
investors buy  Imax Corp. (IMAX)  and  Regal Entertainment Group. (RGC)  He has
hold ratings on  Cinemark Holdings Inc. (CNK) ,  Cineplex Inc. (CGX)  and  RealD
Inc. (RLD) , the supplier of 3-D equipment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
