Mexico  had a budget deficit of
167.1 billion pesos from the beginning of the year through
August, the  Finance Ministry  said in an e-mailed statement
today.  Excluding investment in state oil company Petroleos
Mexicanos, the nation posted a surplus over the period of 1.1
billion pesos.  Mexico’s government debt will equal 42.9 percent of its
gross domestic product this year, versus 90 percent for the euro
area, according to International Monetary Fund projections.  Latin America’s second-biggest economy will expand 3.8
percent this year, compared with 1.7 percent for Brazil and 2.2
percent for the U.S., according to the median estimates of
economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
