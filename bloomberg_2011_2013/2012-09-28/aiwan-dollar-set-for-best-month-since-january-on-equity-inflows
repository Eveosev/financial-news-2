Taiwan’s dollar completed the
biggest monthly gain since January after a Federal Reserve plan
to boost asset purchases spurred demand for the island’s stocks.  The local currency gained 2.1 percent this month, the
second-best performer in Asia, as global funds bought $1.9
billion more Taiwanese stocks than they sold, exchange data
showed. Central bank Governor Perng Fai-nan said Sept. 26
inflows triggered by the Fed’s latest quantitative easing will
be less than those the previous two programs fueled, and that
the monetary authority’s mandate is to keep relative exchange-
rate stability and to intervene in the event of abnormal moves.  “Money is flowing into emerging markets following the QE3
announcement,” said Samson Tu, a Taipei-based fund manager at
Uni-President Assets Management Corp., who helps manage $1.6
billion of fixed-income assets. “But Taiwan’s central bank has
made it clear it’ll maintain its currency at a more stable
level. We might see the appreciation slowing.”  The Taiwan dollar rose 0.3 percent today to NT$29.342
against its U.S. counterpart, according to Taipei Forex Inc. It
reached NT$29.198 on Sept. 17, the strongest level since May 3,
and has appreciated 1.9 percent this quarter.  One-month non-deliverable forwards in the currency advanced
0.3 percent to NT$29.295 today, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. One-month implied volatility, a measure of exchange-
rate swings used to price options, dropped five basis points, or
0.05 percent, to 3.7 percent.  The Fed said on Sept. 13 it will start open-ended purchases
of $40 billion of mortgage debt per month, and hold interest
rates near zero at least through mid-2015.  Government bonds were little changed today. The yield on
Taiwan’s 1.125 percent bonds due September 2022 was at 1.169
percent, according to Gretai Securities Market. The  overnight
money-market rate  slipped one basis point to 0.388 percent, a
weighted average compiled by the Taiwan Interbank Money Center
shows.  To contact the reporter on this story:
