Beijing began to release real-time
air quality data that measures pollutants of 2.5 micrometers in
size, Xinhua News Agency said, citing an unidentified official
at the Beijing Environmental Protection Monitoring Center.  The city plans to have 35 monitoring stations to collect
the data, with 20 now in operation, the official news service
said. The center will announce an assessment of the capitalâ€™s
air quality in January, based on the national Ambient Air
Quality Standard.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
