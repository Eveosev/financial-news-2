Revenue this year from  Manila  Water
Co., which supplies water to half of the Philippine capital,
will probably be better than a year earlier, Chief Financial
Officer Luis Juan Oreta said today.  Second-half sales will increase from a year earlier even if
revenue won’t be as strong as in the first half, he said in
Manila. The shares gained 0.8 percent today, raising the stock’s
advance this year to 39 percent, almost twice as much as the 18-
member Bloomberg World Water Index’s 20 percent gain.   Manila Water’s first-half net income increased 31 percent
to 2.63 billion pesos ($63 million) from a year earlier on
higher billing volume, it said on Aug. 8. Revenue rose 24
percent as the total billed water volume increased 36
percent, the utility said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
