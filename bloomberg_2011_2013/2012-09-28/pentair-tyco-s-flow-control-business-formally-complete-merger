Pentair Inc. (PNR)  and  Tyco International
Ltd. (TYC) ’s flow control business formally combined to create Pentair
Ltd., which will specialize in water and fluid solutions as well
as industrial valves and pumps.  The company is incorporated in Switzerland from its
Schaffhausen base near the German border for tax reasons with
its main offices remaining in Minneapolis. Effective today,
Pentair will be included in the  S&P 500 Index , it said.  Completion of the merger announced in March of the water
filtration firm and Tyco’s flow control business valued the flow
unit at about $4.9 billion including debt. Chief Executive
Officer Randall Hogan heads Pentair Ltd., which he said then
would be the largest flow, filtration and equipment-protection
company.  “We have significantly increased our global presence,”
Hogan said in today’s statement. “Looking forward, we believe
Pentair is uniquely positioned to benefit from the increased
demands on energy, water, infrastructure and agriculture
resulting from the growing population and wealth of the world.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
