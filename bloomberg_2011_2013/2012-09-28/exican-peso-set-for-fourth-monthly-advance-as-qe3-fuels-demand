Mexico’s peso strengthened for the
fourth straight month after the  Federal Reserve  said it would
buy assets to stimulate growth, adding to demand for higher-
yielding emerging-market assets.  The peso climbed 2.6 percent this month as of 4 p.m. in
Mexico City, the most among major Latin American currencies
tracked by Bloomberg, as it benefited from its ties to the U.S.,
where it sends about 80 percent of its exports. The peso
weakened 0.2 percent today to 12.8585 per U.S. dollar.  The Fed announced a third round of asset purchases, known
as quantitative easing, on Sept. 13, and pledged to keep
 interest rates  near zero through at least mid-2015. A week
earlier on Sept. 6, the European Central Bank unveiled plans for
unlimited bond purchases to stem its region’s crisis.  “We keep seeing a very significant flow of foreign
investors coming into Mexican markets,”  Rafael Camarena , an
economist at  Banco Santander SA (SAN) , said by phone from Mexico City.
“The new monetary stimulus from the Federal Reserve is a
factor.”  The ECB’s efforts to ease its crisis also contributed to
the peso’s gain, Camarena said.  The peso depreciated today as Spain’s banks showed a
combined capital shortfall of 59.3 billion euros ($76.3
billion), according to a stress test designed to remove doubts
about a financial industry pummeled by real estate losses.  Yields on peso-denominated bonds due in 2024 rose two basis
points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 5.40 percent, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The price fell 0.28 centavo to
141.01 centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
