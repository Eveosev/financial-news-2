Lewis Hamilton  will announce today
that he’s leaving the McLaren Formula One team to join Mercedes
on a three-year contract said to be worth $100 million, the
Daily Telegraph reported.  Hamilton’s decision to join Mercedes is almost certain to
end the career of record seven-time world champion  Michael Schumacher , who may be offered an ambassadorial or management
role with the Brackley, England-based team, the Telegraph added.  Daimler AG (DAI) ’s Mercedes team is waiting for its board in
Stuttgart to sign off on new terms tying it to Formula One
before making an official announcement regarding Hamilton, the
newspaper said, without saying where it got the information.  Hamilton, 27, has been at Woking, England-based McLaren all
his racing career and won the 2008 F-1 world championship with
the team.  To contact the reporter on this story:
