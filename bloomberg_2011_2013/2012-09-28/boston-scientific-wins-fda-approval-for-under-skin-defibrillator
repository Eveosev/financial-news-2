Boston Scientific Corp. (BSX) ’s Cameron
Health unit won U.S. approval to sell the first defibrillator
with wires that can be implanted under the skin instead of
connected directly into the heart.  The  Food and Drug Administration  cleared the Cameron S-ICD
system for use, saying in a  statement  today that the device
provides a less invasive option for patients. Defibrillators
regulate heart rhythms with an electric shock when the device
detects the heart beating dangerously fast or chaotically.  Boston Scientific paid $150 million to buy Cameron in June,
primarily to gain access to the new type of defibrillator, which
may bolster a shrinking market for devices used to shock stopped
hearts. Natick, Massachusetts-based Boston Scientific will make
another $150 million payment because of the FDA approval, and
the value of the acquisition to Cameron may reach $1.35 billion
if certain revenue targets for the device are met.  “Some patients with anatomy that makes it challenging to
place one of the implantable defibrillators currently on the
market may especially benefit from this device,” Christy Foreman, director of the Office of Device Evaluation at FDA’s
Center for Devices and Radiological Health, said in the
statement.  Other implantable defibrillators require physicians to
insert wires, called leads, into a vein in the upper chest and
guide them into the patient’s heart.  Boston Scientific  increased  1.4 percent to $5.74 at 4 p.m.
