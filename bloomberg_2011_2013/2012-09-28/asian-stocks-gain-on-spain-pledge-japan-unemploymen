 Europe , the U.S. and Japan took action to boost economic growth.  “Spain’s position on austerity cuts is positive because it
may prevent the country from falling into a vicious cycle,”
said Juichi Wako, a senior strategist at Tokyo-based Nomura

will be able to push these cuts because local governments are
powerful in Spain.”  Asia’s equity benchmark advanced 7.8 percent this year
compared with a 15 percent gain on the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index and an 11 percent advance on the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.

Jiabao  to step up measures to support the world’s second-largest
economy.  Deficit Target  Futures on the S&P 500 slid less than 0.1 percent today.
The gauge advanced 1 percent yesterday, halting a five-day
slump, as U.S. stocks joined a global rally amid speculation
that China’s government will do more to boost growth. The
optimism outweighed U.S. data signaling a slowdown in business
spending and weaker-than-estimated second-quarter economic
growth.  Exporters to Europe gained, with Makita Corp., a Japanese
