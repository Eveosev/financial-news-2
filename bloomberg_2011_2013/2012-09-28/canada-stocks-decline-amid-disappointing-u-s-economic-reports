to be growing quickly and that weighs on the marketplace. With
Europe, it’s one step forward and two steps back. The issues are
not being solved, so people are constantly worried.”  The Institute for Supply Management-Chicago Inc. said today
its  business barometer  fell to 49.7 this month from 53 in
August. A reading of 50 is the dividing line between expansion
and contraction.  Consumer spending  in the U.S. barely rose in
August after adjusting for inflation, showing the economic
expansion is struggling to gain momentum.  Spain’s banks have a combined capital shortfall of 59.3
billion euros ($76.3 billion), less than previously estimated,
according to a stress test designed to remove doubts about a
financial industry pummeled by real estate losses. Spain

management consultants  Oliver Wyman , as part of the conditions
agreed in July for a European bailout of as much as 100 billion
euros for its banking system.  Financials Slump  The S&P/TSX Energy Index retreated 0.4 percent as six of 10

price target.  RIM Soars  RIM soared 8.1 percent to C$7.52 on the Toronto Stock
Exchange after the BlackBerry smartphone maker beat analyst
