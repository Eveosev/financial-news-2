The controversial call that gave
the Seattle Seahawks a win over the Green Bay Packers reinforced
the public’s belief about the presence of replacement referees,
according to a Seton Hall University poll.  A survey of 688 randomly selected people showed that on
Sept. 24, before the National Football League game, 41 percent
said games had suffered from the use of replacements. After the
game, the number jumped to 65 percent.  The referees missed a pushing violation in the end zone on
the final play and called a simultaneous catch, which gave
Seattle a game-winning touchdown as time expired.  The NFL and the referees reached an agreement two days
after the game to end the three-month lockout. The referees
returned to the field last night for the Ravens’ 23-16 victory
over the Cleveland Browns at M&T Stadium in Baltimore.  “The NFL felt the shift in mood of its public,” said Rick Gentile, director of the poll, which is conducted by the Sharkey
Institute. “The game changed the mood of the American public
and these are the numbers that prove it.”  Forty-seven percent of respondents didn’t know if the
replacements were affecting games before the Seahawks’ incident,
the poll showed. The number fell to 26 percent afterwards.  The margin of error is plus or minus 3.8 percentage points,
the South Orange, New Jersey-based school said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
