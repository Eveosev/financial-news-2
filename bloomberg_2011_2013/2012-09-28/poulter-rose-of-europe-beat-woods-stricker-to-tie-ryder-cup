Europeans Ian Poulter and  Justin Rose  defeated the U.S. team of Tiger Woods and  Steve Stricker  to
tie golf’s Ryder Cup matches 2-2 after the morning foursomes.  Poulter and Rose secured the win 2 and 1, or by two holes
with one to play, with a par on the 17th hole at Medinah Country
Club outside Chicago.  In other morning matches in the alternate-shot format, the
U.S. pair of  Phil Mickelson  and Keegan Bradley defeated the
European team of Luke Donald and Sergio Garcia 4 and 3; Rory McIlroy and Graeme McDowell beat Americans Jim Furyk and Brandt Snedeker on the final hole; and Jason Dufner and Zach Johnson
topped Europe’s Lee Westwood and Francisco Molinari 3 and 2.  The afternoon session will feature fourballs, in which each
golfer in the two-man teams plays his own ball, with the lowest
individual score winning the hole. The competition continues
through Sunday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
