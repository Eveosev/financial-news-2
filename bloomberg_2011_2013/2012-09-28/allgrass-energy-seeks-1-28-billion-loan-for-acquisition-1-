Tallgrass Energy Partners LP will
host a lender meeting Oct. 2 in  New York  to discuss $1.28
billion in loans the company is seeking to acquire  Kinder Morgan 
Inc.’s interstate gas pipeline system, according to a person
with knowledge of the transaction.  Barclays Plc is arranging the financing, which consists of
an $875 million, six-year  term loan , a six-year $250 million
delayed-draw term loan that will be available for 18 months and
a $150 million revolving line of credit maturing in five years,
said the person, who asked not to be identified because the
information is private.  Proceeds will also be used to acquire 50 percent of the
Rockies Express Pipeline as well as other pipeline assets from
Kinder Morgan, the person said. Leverage, or debt to earnings
before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, will be
3.2 times, the person said.  Tallgrass, based in  Overland Park , Kansas, is  owned  by its
management as well as private-equity firm Kelso & Co. and a
group of investors led by the Energy & Minerals Group. Tallgrass
Chief Executive Officer David G. Dehaemers Jr. is a former chief
financial officer at Kinder Morgan. John T. Raymond, the founder
of Houston-based Energy & Minerals Group, served as a vice
president at Kinder Morgan.  Doug Johnson , a spokesman for Tallgrass Energy Partners,
didn’t immediately respond to an e-mail seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
