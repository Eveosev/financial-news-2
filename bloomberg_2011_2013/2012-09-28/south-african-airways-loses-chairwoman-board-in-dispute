South African Airways,  Africa 's
biggest airline, had its chairwoman and six other board members
resign because of a disagreement with the government.  Directors of the state-owned carrier had a breakdown in the
relationship with its shareholder, represented by the Minister
of Public Enterprises Malusi Gigaba, ahead of the planned
release of its financial results this week, former Chairwoman
Cheryl Carolus said in an interview with Johannesburg’s SAFM
radio station today. The release of the company’s annual report
was delayed by Gigaba.  Carolus said the board submitted Johannesburg-based
SAA’s financial statements to the ministry on time and was
awaiting confirmation of one outstanding issue relating to the
“unpredictability” of the oil price. The board had to get a
credit facility from a commercial bank or ask National Treasury
for a guarantee. Gigaba has previously said he is seeking
financial assistance from the National Treasury for SAA.  “It is something I am very sad about,” Carolus said. “I
love the airline and I respect it,” she said. The board members
couldn’t stand by “like battered women” while the ministry
didn’t defend them.  Mayihlome Tshwete, spokesman for the minister, said in an
interview with SAFM that there was “constant communication”
from the minister to the board surrounding the postponement of
the release.  Richard Mantu, a spokesman for Gigaba, declined to comment
when called by Bloomberg. Prior to the resignations the board
had 14 members, according to Johannesburg’s Business Day
newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
