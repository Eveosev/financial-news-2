Japanese government bonds with
maturities from 12 to 16 years look attractive after the  Bank of
Japan (8301) ’s monetary easing lowered yields on shorter-dated debt,
Prudential Investment Management Japan Co. said.  The BOJ on Sept. 19 unexpectedly expanded its asset
purchase fund by 10 trillion yen ($129 billion) to 55 trillion
yen, seeking to counter an increasing danger of contraction in
the world’s third-largest economy. Yields on debt with up to
three years of maturity have fallen to about 0.1 percent,
matching the upper limit of the central bank’s target rate.  “The BOJ’s monetary easing is keeping the short to middle
term bond yields at low levels,” said Kenji Sakaguchi, who
oversees 7.6 trillion yen of debt as chief investment officer at
Prudential in Tokyo. “Investors may look at the 15-year JGBs
that are relatively cheap.”  Yields on bonds with 15 years to maturity rose two basis
points from yesterday to 1.27 percent at 2:27 p.m. in Tokyo,
according to  Japan  Bond Trading Co., the nation’s largest
interdealer debt broker. The debt offers a 50 basis-point
 premium  over 10-year bonds at 0.77 percent, compared with the
average over the past decade of 33 basis points. Ten-year rates
touched 0.72 percent on July 23, the lowest since June 2003.  The yield curve has been steepening since the start of this
year partly because Japan’s life insurers, the biggest buyers of
the nation’s longer-term bonds, shifted to foreign debt and
started selling fewer products, Sakaguchi said. Nippon Life
Insurance Co., Japan’s biggest life insurer, said in April that
it would reduce the amount of new money it allocates to domestic
bonds by 30 percent this fiscal year.  “It’s possible investors who think the 10-year yields are
too low will start buying longer securities,” said Sakaguchi,
who expects the 10-year rate to remain in a range between 0.7
percent to 1 percent in the next six months.  To contact the reporters on this story:
