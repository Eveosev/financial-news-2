Tropical Storm Norman will probably
go ashore late today or early tomorrow on the western coast of
Mexico, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said.  A storm warning was posted from  La Cruz  to Huatabampo,
north of the resort city of Mazatlan. Norman, with maximum
sustained winds of 40 miles (64 kilometers) per hour, was 165
miles west-northwest of Mazatlan as of 5 p.m. New York time and
moving north at 16 mph, the center said.  Moisture from the storm may contribute to patterns that are
expected to cause heavy rain and possible flooding over the
weekend in Texas, including Austin, Houston and San Antonio,
according to AccuWeather Inc. in  State College , Pennsylvania.  Norman isnâ€™t expected to strengthen before going ashore
near Los Mochis, the center said. Eight inches (20 centimeters)
or more of rain may fall in some areas.  Editors:  To contact the reporter on this story:
