A man masquerading as a Central
Intelligence Agency officer recruited people to rob three
 Virginia  banks on behalf of the U.S. government, federal
prosecutors said.  Joshua Brady, 28, of Petersburg, Virginia, was charged with
one count of impersonating a government official and three
counts of attempted bank robbery, according to an indictment
filed yesterday in federal court in Alexandria, Virginia. Each
count carries a maximum prison sentence of 20 years.  In June, Brady attempted to extort money from a Capital One
bank in Fairfax County and a BB&T bank and a SunTrust bank in
Alexandria, according to the indictment.  Brady pretended to be a CIA employee and used that guise to
solicit others to rob the banks, prosecutors said in an e-mailed
statement.  Peter Carr , a spokesman for U.S. Attorney  Neil MacBride , said no more details of the alleged scheme are public.  Brady has been in federal custody since Aug. 17, according
to a court filing.  The case is U.S. v. Brady, 12-cr-00424, U.S. District
Court, Eastern District of Virginia (Alexandria).  To contact the reporter on this story:
