Corn extended a slide to an 11-week
low before a U.S. government report today that may show larger
domestic stockpiles. Wheat fell.  U.S. corn inventories on Sept. 1 probably totaled 1.145
billion bushels, up 1.6 percent from a year earlier, as farmers
harvested crops earlier this year because of dry weather,
according to a Bloomberg survey. The Department of Agriculture
will release supply estimates at 8:30 a.m. in  Washington . The
worst U.S. drought in half a century sent corn to a record $8.49
a bushel last month, encouraging  speculators  to boost bullish
long positions to a 16-month high, government data show.  “People have been hesitant to extend long positions or get
back into the market ahead of the stocks report,” Erin FitzPatrick, an analyst at Rabobank International, said by phone
from London. “This report is probably going to set the tone for
the following few weeks.”  Corn for December delivery fell 1.2 percent to $7.0775 a
bushel on the  Chicago  Board of Trade by 12:11 p.m. London time,
and earlier touched $7.05, the lowest price for a most active
contract since July 12. The price was set for a monthly decline
of 12 percent, the biggest drop since May, and a third-quarter
drop of 12 percent.  Hedge funds  have cut bullish bets in corn futures and
options by 21 percent since a high in the week ended Aug. 21,
Commodity Futures Trading Commission data show. U.S. export
sales tumbled to 368 metric tons in the week ended Sept. 20,
compared with 69,578 tons a week earlier, the USDA said
yesterday.  Soybeans for November delivery fell 0.2 percent to $15.68 a
bushel, after rising as much as 0.9 percent. The oilseed, which
reached a record $17.89 on Sept. 4, headed toward an 11 percent
decline this month.  Wheat for December declined 0.5 percent to $8.5125 a bushel
in Chicago, heading for a 4.3 percent monthly drop. In Paris,
November-delivery milling wheat fell 0.6 percent to 256.50 euros
($331.45) a ton on NYSE Liffe.  To contact the reporter on this story:
