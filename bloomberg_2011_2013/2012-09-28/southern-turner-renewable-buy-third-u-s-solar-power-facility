Southern Co. (SO) , the second-largest
U.S. power company by market value, bought its third solar farm
in partnership with billionaire Ted Turner’s renewable-energy
business.  Southern and Turner Renewable Energy purchased the 30-
megawatt Spectrum Solar project in Clark County, Nevada, from
 MEMC Electronic Materials Inc. (WFR) , the Atlanta-based power company
today in a statement. Terms weren’t disclosed.  The deal extends the relationship between two companies
that have been collaborating on renewable-energy projects since
January 2010. They teamed up in June to buy MEMC’s 20-megawatt
Apex project in Nevada, and in March 2010 acquired from  First
Solar Inc. (FSLR)  the 30-megawatt Cimarron project on land next to
Turner’s Vermejo Park Ranch near Raton, New Mexico.  MEMC’s SunEdison unit will begin construction on the
Spectrum plant in October and is expected to finish in the
second quarter, according to the statement.  NV Energy Inc. will buy Spectrum’s electricity under a 25-
year agreement.  Turner Renewable Energy is a unit of Turner Enterprises
Inc., a closely held company that manages the investments and
land holdings of Ted Turner, including more than 2 million acres
in the U.S. and Argentina.  To contact the reporter on this story:
