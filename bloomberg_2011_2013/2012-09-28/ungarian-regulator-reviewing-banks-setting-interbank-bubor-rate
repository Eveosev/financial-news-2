Hungary’s financial regulator PSZAF
is conducting a review of banks which help set the Budapest
Interbank Offered Rate, or Bubor, PSZAF spokesman Istvan Binder
said today.  “The regulator has no preconceptions when starting an
investigation” and “the mere fact there is an investigation at
a company doesn’t mean it has any sort of problem,” Binder said
by phone from Budapest.  He declined to say which banks are being investigated and
didn’t provide an more details.  To contact the reporter on this story:
