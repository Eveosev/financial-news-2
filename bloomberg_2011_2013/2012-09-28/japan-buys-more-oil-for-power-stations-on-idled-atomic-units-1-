Japan ’s  imports  of oil for
electricity generation rose 35 percent in August as the country
continued to replace lost nuclear capacity with thermal power.  Japan bought 1.27 million kiloliters of oil, or about
257,000 barrels a day, to produce electricity last month,
according to  data  today from the Ministry of Economy, Trade and
Industry. That’s up from 938,258 kiloliters a year earlier.  Crude shipments last month were 17.8 million kiloliters, up
2.9 percent from a year ago, the report showed. Purchases for
electricity plants accounted for about 7 percent of the intake.  Japan, the world’s third-largest crude user after the U.S.
and  China , is seeking replacement energy sources after losing
nearly all of its nuclear output following the March 2011
earthquake and tsunami, which caused the meltdown of three
reactors at  Tokyo Electric Power Co. (9501) ’s Fukushima atomic station.  Only two of Japan’s 50 functioning reactors, all of which
were idled for safety checks since the disaster, have been
permitted to resume operation. Japan’s nuclear utilization rate
was 5.1 percent in August, down from 26.4 percent a year
earlier, according to data released Sept. 14 by the  Federation
of Electric Power Companies .  Iran Imports  Crude imports from  Vietnam , which produces grades that some
Japanese generators can burn, increased 37 percent to 457,478
kiloliters from 333,812 in August 2011.  Russia , which sells East
Siberian Pacific Ocean pipeline crude to JX Nippon Oil & Energy
Corp., shipped 728,409 kiloliters, overtaking Oman as Japan’s
fifth-biggest supplier.  Oil purchases from  Iran  dropped 67 percent to 497,961
kiloliters as buyers turned to alternative oil sources following
Western sanctions targeting the Middle East country’s nuclear
program.  Statistics based on custom-clearance  data  yesterday by the
Ministry of Finance showed a similar decline in crude imports
from Iran. Today’s trade ministry statistics are based on data
collected from buyers via questionnaire and include fuel in so-
called bonded  storage tanks  that haven’t passed customs.  Japan’s oil-product imports declined 13 percent to 3.08
million kiloliters, while exports fell 6.6 percent to 2.58
million, today’s data showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
