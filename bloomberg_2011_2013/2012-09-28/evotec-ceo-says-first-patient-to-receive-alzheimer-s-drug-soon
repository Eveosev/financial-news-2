Evotec AG (EVT)  Chief Executive Officer
Werner Lanthaler said the first patient will soon start a mid-
stage trial of the company’s experimental  Alzheimer ’s drug.  “This is really our most exciting project right now,”
Lanthaler said in a telephone interview today. The patient will
begin receiving EVT 302 in a few weeks, Lanthaler said.  Roche Holding AG (ROG)  bought the rights to EVT 302 last year.
Hamburg, Germany-based Evotec initially received $10 million and
is in line for an additional $820 million if development and
sales goals are met. The next milestone, completion of this
trial, entails a payout of a high double-digit million dollar
sum to Evotec, Lanthaler said.  “This is a great asset to have,” Lanthaler said.  The compound  targets  monoamine oxidase type B, or MAO-B, an
enzyme that breaks down dopamine in the brain and contributes to
the production of free radicals, which may contribute to the
spread of the disease.  The drug could reach the market in 2018, and generate $5
billion in peak sales annually, Lanthaler said, of which Evotec
is slated to receive royalties in the double-digit million
dollar range.  To contact the reporter on this story:
