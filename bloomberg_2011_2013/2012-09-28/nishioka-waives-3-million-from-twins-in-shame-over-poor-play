Infielder Tsuyoshi Nishioka gave up $3.25 million in future pay and was granted his release from the  Minnesota  Twins after saying he was ashamed of his poor performance.  Nishioka will forgo the $3 million he was owed in 2013 on the final year of a three-year deal, and a $250,000 buyout, according to a statement released yesterday by the Major League Baseball team. The 28-year-old had asked to be released and is now a free agent.  Nishioka said in the statement that he refused the money because he was disappointed in the way he has performed in his two major-league seasons, both in Minnesota.  “I take full responsibility for my performance, which was below my own expectations,” he said. “At this time, I have made the decision that it is time to part ways. I have no regrets and know that only through struggle can a person grow stronger.”  Nishioka played in three games for the Twins this season, going 0-for-12 and committing two errors. He spent the majority of the season with the  Rochester Red Wings , the Twins’ Triple-A affiliate, where he hit .258 in 101 games with 42 runs scored, 53 strikeouts and a team-high 12 errors. In 2011, he hit .226 with five extra-base hits in 68 games.  Nishioka was the 2010  Nippon Professional Baseball  batting champion in his native  Japan . He also won the league’s equivalent of the Gold Glove award, given each season to the best fielder at each position.  Meche Retires  Nishioka isn’t the first major-league player to give up guaranteed money that he felt was undeserved. Kansas City Royals pitcher Gil Meche retired after the 2010 season, forgoing his 2011 salary of $12 million, which was three times higher than anyone else on the team.  “When I signed my contract, my main goal was to earn it,” Meche told the  New York Times . “Once I started to realize I wasn’t earning my money, I felt bad. I was making a crazy amount of money for not even pitching. Honestly, I didn’t feel like I deserved it. I didn’t want to have those feelings again.”  To contact the reporter on this story: Eben Novy-Williams in  New York  at   enovywilliam@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story: Michael Sillup at   msillup@bloomberg.net
