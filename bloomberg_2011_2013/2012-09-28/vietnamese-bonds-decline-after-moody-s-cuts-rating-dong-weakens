Vietnam’s government bonds dropped,
pushing the three-year yield to a two-month high, after Moody’s
Investors Service cut the country’s credit rating for the first
time since 2010. The dong weakened.  The foreign- and local-currency government debt ratings
were lowered to B2 from B1, with a stable outlook, Moody’s said
in a statement today, citing lower growth prospects and risks to
the state balance sheet from “weaknesses” in the banking
system. That is five steps below investment grade and the same
as Egypt and Cambodia.  “The cut put some negative effects on bond prices and may
also make government debt less attractive to foreigners,” said
Nguyen Duy Phong, a Ho Chi Minh City-based analyst at Viet
Capital Securities.  The yield on the three-year notes rose three basis points,
or 0.03 percentage point, to 9.91 percent, according to a daily
fixing from banks compiled by Bloomberg. That was the highest
level since July 19. The yield advanced 18 basis points this
week, 33 basis points this month and 28 basis points since the
end of June.  The dong weakened 0.1 percent to 20,885 per dollar as of
3:41 p.m. in Hanoi, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
central bank set its reference rate at 20,828, unchanged since
Dec. 26, according to its website. The currency is allowed to
trade as much as 1 percent on either side of the fixing.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
