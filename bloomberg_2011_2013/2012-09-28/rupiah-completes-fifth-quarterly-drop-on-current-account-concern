Indonesia ’s rupiah completed its
fifth quarterly drop, the longest losing streak since 2001, as
four months of trade deficits and a record current-account
shortfall damped investor confidence.  Government bonds  advanced.  The currency was  Asia ’s worst performer in the past three
months as official data showed imports exceeded exports by $177
million in July, from a record $1.3 billion in June. The
current-account deficit reached  $6.9 billion  in the second
quarter, the most since Bloomberg began collecting the data in
1997.  Bank Indonesia  will strengthen  coordination  with the
government to narrow the gap, it said in a Sept. 13 statement.  “The risk is still in the current-account deficit,” said
Rully Nova, a currency analyst at PT Bank Himpunan Saudara 1906
in Jakarta. “Investors are waiting on the sidelines for the
current account to improve next quarter.”  The rupiah weakened 1.6 percent in the last three months to
9,582 per dollar as of 3:58 p.m. in Jakarta, according to prices
from local banks compiled by Bloomberg. The currency was little
changed today and fell 0.3 percent this week. The rupiah will
probably trade at 9,300 by year-end, Nova forecast.  One-month implied volatility, which measures exchange-rate
swings used to price options, declined 175 basis points, or 1.75
percentage points, this quarter to 6.75 percent, data compiled
by Bloomberg show. It was unchanged today.  The yield on the 7 percent bonds due May 2022 dropped 13
basis points, or 0.13 percentage point, this quarter to 6.02
percent, prices from the Inter Dealer Market Association show.
The yield fell 24 basis points in September and lost one basis
point today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
