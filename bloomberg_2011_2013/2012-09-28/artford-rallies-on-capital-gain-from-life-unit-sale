Hartford Financial Services Group
Inc. (HIG)  advanced the most on the 22-company Standard & Poor’s 500
Insurance Index after the firm agreed to sell a life unit to
 Prudential Financial Inc. (PRU)   Hartford rose 0.7 percent to $19.44 at 4 p.m. in New York
and has climbed 20 percent this year. The insurer will get a
statutory capital benefit of about $1.5 billion in the deal,
more than the $1.1 billion expected by  Randy Binner , an analyst
at FBR Capital Markets. The sum includes a $615 million cash
payment, according to a statement yesterday from Hartford, which
is based in the Connecticut city of the same name.  Chief Executive Officer  Liam McGee  is divesting units and
focusing on property-casualty coverage, such as commercial
insurance and auto policies. McGee, 58, reached deals this year
to sell assets including the Woodbury Financial Services broker-
dealer and a retirement-plans business.  “HIG shares are likely the bigger beneficiary, given a
total of $2.2 billion of freed-up capital from this and the
retirement plans and Woodbury transactions that could be used
for highly accretive share buybacks and debt pay-downs,” Binner
said in a note today, using Hartford’s ticker symbol.  Prudential, the second-largest U.S. life insurer, slid 0.6
percent to $54.51. The  Newark , New Jersey-based company has
gained 8.8 percent this year.  Binner has an  outperform rating  on both Hartford and
Prudential.  To contact the reporter on this story:
