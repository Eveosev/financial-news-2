Portugal ’s  budget deficit  will
widen to 5 percent of gross domestic product this year after the
government narrowed it to 4.4 percent in 2011, the country’s
statistics institute said.  Debt will increase to 119.1 percent of GDP this year from
108.1 percent in 2011, the Lisbon-based National Statistics
Institute said today in an e-mailed statement on the excessive-
deficit procedure.  Portugal’s debt, which will  peak  below 124 percent of GDP,
“remains sustainable and will be on a firm downward trajectory
after 2014,” the IMF, the European Commission and the  European
Central Bank  said in a joint statement on Sept. 11. The IMF in
July said it projected Portugal’s debt would peak at about 118.5
percent of GDP in 2013.  Prime Minister  Pedro Passos Coelho  is battling rising
joblessness and a deepening recession as he cuts spending and
raises taxes to meet the terms of a 78 billion-euro ($100
billion) aid plan from the European Union and the IMF. Portugal
has been given more time to narrow its budget shortfall after
 tax revenue  missed forecasts and the economy heads for a third
year of contraction in 2013.  Deficit Target  Portugal aims to reach a deficit of 5 percent in 2012
instead of the previous goal of 4.5 percent, Finance Minister
Vitor Gaspar said on Sept. 11 after EU and IMF officials agreed
on the new targets. It aims for a gap of 4.5 percent in 2013
rather than 3 percent. It will only cut the deficit below the
EU’s 3 percent limit in 2014, when it targets a 2.5 percent gap.  The government had earlier said it narrowed the budget
shortfall to 4.2 percent of GDP last year from 9.8 percent in
2010 after the transfer of banks’ pension funds to the state.  The  budget  deficit narrowed to 3.7 percent of GDP in the 12
months through the second quarter from 4.5 percent in the 12
months through March, the statistics institute said today in a
separate statement.  The government projects GDP will shrink 1 percent in 2013
after a contraction of 3 percent this year. It forecasts the
 unemployment rate  will rise to about 16 percent in 2013 from
15.5 percent this year. Economic growth has averaged less than 1
percent a year for the past decade, placing Portugal among
 Europe ’s weakest performers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
