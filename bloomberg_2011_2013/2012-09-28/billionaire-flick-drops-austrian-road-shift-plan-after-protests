Ingrid Flick, widow of late German-
Austrian billionaire Friedrich Karl Flick, abandoned plans to
shift a road along the Woerthersee lake for as much as 5.5
million euros (7.1 million) after local objections.  Flick decided yesterday to put “all further steps for the
Woerthersee project on hold until it can be assured that all
affected residents and the population is behind such a
project,” her family office said in a statement today.  Flick in July agreed to buy the land where the road is
located from the Province of Carinthia in southern  Austria 
for 1.5 million euros and pay as much as 4 million euros for the
construction of a new road 900 meters (984 yards) further from
the shore, according to state broadcaster  ORF . This triggered
local protests with more than 1,000 people, including fellow
billionaire Heidi Horten, signing a petition opposing the
project, ORF said.  The road relocation would have increased Flick’s property
by 6,000 square meters (65,000), lifting its value, ORF said.  Flick said in the statement that the proposed project would
have included the financing of a cycling path, an observation
deck and public access to the lake.  The Flick family is worth about 5.9 billion euros, while
Horten is worth about 2.8 billion euros, according to Trend
magazine.  To contact the reporter on this story:
