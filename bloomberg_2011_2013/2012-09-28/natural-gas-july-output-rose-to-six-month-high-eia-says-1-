U.S. natural gas production rose to
a six-month high in July as new wells in New  Mexico  were
completed and  Gulf of Mexico  platforms returned to service after
a tropical storm, the Energy Department said.  Output increased 0.4 percent, to 72.58 billion cubic feet a
day in the lower 48 states, the most since January, from a
revised 72.29 billion in June, the department’s Energy
Information Administration said in the monthly  EIA-914 report ,
released today in Washington. Production in the contiguous
states gained for the third time in four months.  “New Mexico had the largest percentage increase,” driven
by the completion of new wells and maintenance projects, the
department said. Gulf of Mexico production gained as more wells
were put back into service after Tropical Storm Debby, the
department said. Output rose 2.6 percent to 3.61 billion cubic
feet a day in  New Mexico , and 1.8 percent to 4.06 billion a day
in the Gulf.  U.S. production, including Alaska, dropped 1.8 percent to
79.25 billion cubic feet a day.  Marcellus Gas  Production from the “other states” category, including
supplies from the Marcellus field and  Colorado , rose 0.4 percent
to 22.68 billion cubic feet a day in July, the fourth
consecutive gain.  Output in  Texas , the biggest producing state, rose 0.4
percent to 22.13 billion cubic feet a day. Oklahoma output rose
0.4 percent to 5.5 billion, Louisiana’s increased 0.1 percent to
8.5 billion and Wyoming’s declined 1.1 percent to 6.1 billion.  Natural gas futures in July gained 38.5 cents, or 14
percent, to $3.209 per million British thermal units on the  New
York  Mercantile Exchange. November futures today fell 1.4 cents,
or 0.4 percent, to $3.283 per million British thermal units.  The EIA-914 report covers gross gas withdrawals, which
include gas used for pressuring, quantities vented and flared,
and non-hydrocarbon gas removed in treating or processing
operations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
