The Italian, Greek and Albanian
governments agreed to provide political support to the Trans
Adriatic pipeline project to deliver Caspian natural gas to the
European Union.  A memorandum of understanding was signed late yesterday on
the sidelines of the  United Nations General Assembly  in  New
York , TAP said in an e-mailed statement.  The EU is seeking a link to the Caspian to cut dependence
on gas supplies from  Russia , which provides a quarter of the
region’s demand. By May, the BP Plc-led companies developing the
Shah Deniz gas project in Azerbaijan’s part of the Caspian Sea
plan to choose between the Trans Adriatic, or TAP, project and
 Nabucco (NABUCCO)  West, led by  OMV AG. (OMV)   TAP is being developed by Norway’s  Statoil ASA (STL) ,
Switzerland’s EGL AG and Germany’s E.ON Ruhrgas AG and plans to
transport as much as 20 billion cubic meters of gas a year from
the Turkish border to southern  Italy  through Greece and Albania
and across the  Adriatic Sea .  To contact the reporter on this story:
