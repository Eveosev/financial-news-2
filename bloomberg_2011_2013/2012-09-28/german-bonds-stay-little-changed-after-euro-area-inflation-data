German government bonds stayed
little changed after a report showed euro-area inflation
unexpectedly accelerated in September.  The nation’s  10-year yield  was little changed at 1.45
percent as of 10:04 a.m. London time.  Consumer prices in the 17-nation euro region increased 2.7
percent from a year earlier after a 2.6 percent gain in August,
the European Union’s statistics office in Luxembourg said in a
flash estimate today. The median forecast of 40 economists in a
Bloomberg News survey was for an increase of 2.4 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
