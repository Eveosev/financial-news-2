The San Diego County Water
Authority released a proposed water purchase agreement for a
planned seawater desalination plant in Carlsbad that’s designed
to reduce the area’s dependence on water sources vulnerable to
drought.  That opens a public review period of the agreement that
includes meetings for area residents on Oct. 2 and Oct. 10 to
deliberate on the proposed deal. If approved, the desalination
project would account for about 7 percent of regional supplies
and one-third of locally generated water in San Diego County.  The water authority’s board has investigated desalinated
water as a supply source for almost 20 years. It said the extra
costs from the new water source, including improvements to the
authority’s pipelines and treatment plant to accommodate the new
supply, would add about $5 to $7 a month to the average
household’s water bill by 2016.  To contact the reporter on this story:
