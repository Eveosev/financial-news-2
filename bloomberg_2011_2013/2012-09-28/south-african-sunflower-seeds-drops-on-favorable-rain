South African sunflower seeds fell
1.5 percent as favorable rain in the Free State, which accounts
for two-fifths of the nation’s crops, boosted expectations for
the country’s harvest of the oilseed.  Sunflower for the December delivery, the most active
contract on the South African Futures Exchange, declined 90 rand
to 6,070 rand ($737) a metric ton by the midday close in
Johannesburg.  “The market is reluctant to buy and that is why we see a
drop in prices,” Thys Grobbelaar, an analyst at Klerksdorp-
based Senwes (Pty) Ltd., said by phone today.  South Africa  is the continent’s biggest producer of
sunflower seeds, according to the U.S. department of
Agriculture. The country is forecast by the government to reap
about 527,000 metric tons of the seed this year.  Demand for the seeds is also being pushed down by
speculation that  Malaysia , the world’s second-largest producer
of palmoil, will this year match its record crop.  Palm oil  has
many of the same uses as oil made from sunflower seeds.  South African wheat for December delivery dropped 0.8
percent to 3,419 rand a ton. White corn for delivery in the same
month declined 0.6 percent to 2,275 rand a a ton, while the
yellow variety decreased 1.4 percent to 2,237 rand a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
