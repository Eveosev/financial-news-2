Grupo Aval Acciones y Valores (AVAL)  SA,
the banking group controlled by Colombian billionaire  Luis
Carlos Sarmiento  Angulo, is likely to sell American depositary
receipts before issuing bonds abroad again, said Chief Executive
Officer Luis Carlos Sarmiento Gutierrez.  “If we were to issue abroad again, it would more likely be
stock than debt,” he told reporters today in Bogota. “We’re
ready and have been ready for more than a year to issue ADRs.
We’re waiting for the best timing.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
