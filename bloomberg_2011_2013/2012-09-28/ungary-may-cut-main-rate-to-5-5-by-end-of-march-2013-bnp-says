Hungary ’s central bank may cut its
benchmark  interest rate  by one percentage point by the end of
March 2013 provided the government obtains an International
Monetary Fund bailout by year-end,  BNP Paribas SA (BNP)  said.  The absence of international aid would prevent rate
reductions from the current 6.5 percent, Michal Dybula, an
emerging-market strategist at BNP Paribas in Warsaw, said today
in a research note. Hungary lowered borrowing costs for the
second time in as many months this week with a “tight
majority” over a proposal to leave the main rate unchanged.  Hungary requested aid in November as its  credit rating  was
cut to junk. The latest round of IMF talks stalled after Orban
on Sept. 6 rejected cutting pensions and scrapping an
extraordinary bank tax as well as other measures to reduce the
budget gap, which the government said were the IMF’s conditions.  “We continue to expect Hungary to reach an agreement with
the IMF and the European Union on financial aid before the end
of the year,” Dybula wrote. “However, the talks will not be
easy as the differences in opinion about the structure of public
finances are sizable.”  Hungary needs a loan agreement for “a sustainable”
reduction in its  risk premium , Dybula wrote. The economy will
grow 0.4 percent next year after a 1.1 contraction in 2012, BNP
forecast.  To contact the reporter on this story:
