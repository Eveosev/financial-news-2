European Union carbon permits had
the biggest weekly gain in three months as  oil prices  rose,
spurring demand for emission rights.  EU permits for delivery in December advanced 1.5 percent to
7.98 euros ($10.28) a metric ton on the ICE Futures  Europe 
exchange today, extending this week’s gain to 7 percent. That’s
the biggest advance since the five days ended June 22. The
contract lost 3.6 percent in the quarter.  Brent crude  for November settlement was poised for the
biggest quarterly gain this year. Oil can affect prices of
carbon permits because it’s linked to economic production and to
cleaner-burning natural gas costs in Europe.  United Nations credits for December, which can be used for
compliance in the EU emissions-trading program, fell 0.9 percent
to 2.19 euros today. They had a 47.6 percent decline this
quarter, the worst this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
