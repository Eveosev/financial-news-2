BlackRock Inc. (BLK) , the world’s biggest
asset manager, bought a stake in the Moscow Exchange from the
Russia Direct Investment Fund, a government-backed private-
equity fund,  Vedomosti  reported, citing two unidentified people
close to the bourse’s shareholders.  The RDIF owns 2.7 percent of the bourse. The newspaper
didn’t identify the size of the stake BlackRock bought.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc., BlackRock and Templeton Asset
Management Ltd. signed an accord with RDIF on June 21 to invest
in Russian companies preparing for initial public offerings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
