California Governor  Jerry Brown 
signed a law that permits as many as 6.3 million private workers
without a  pension plan  to set aside retirement money for
management by the state.  It is the first state-run pension program for nongovernment
employees and may add as much as $6.6 billion to funds managed
by the  California Public Employees’ Retirement System , the
biggest U.S. pension. Calpers, as the fund is known, has assets
of $242 billion.  The law is aimed at businesses with five or more employees
that don’t offer pensions or 401(k) savings programs. The  law 
requires companies to contribute 3 percent of a worker’s salary
to a retirement account. Workers will be enrolled in the program
unless they choose to opt out.  About 6.3 million Californians, most of them making less
than $46,420 a year, aren’t covered by an employer-provided
 retirement plan , according to a June 2012 study by the Labor
Center of the  University of California , Berkeley.  The measure was opposed by the California Chamber of
Commerce and Republican lawmakers.  The law won’t automatically entrust the new retirement
accounts to Calpers. Rather, the  fund , which manages benefits
for 1.6 million public employees, retirees and beneficiaries,
will bid for the asset-management business in a process to be
overseen by an investment board headed by the state treasurer.
Private firms may compete to manage all or part of the money.  To contact the reporter on this story:
