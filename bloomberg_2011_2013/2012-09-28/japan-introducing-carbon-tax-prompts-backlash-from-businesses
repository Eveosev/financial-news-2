Japan ’s biggest business lobbyist
attacked plans by the government to introduce a tax on  carbon
emissions  next week, saying it will add billions of yen to
industry’s energy costs and slow economic growth.  The tax, aimed at helping reduce greenhouse gas emissions,
will start Oct. 1 at 289 yen ($3.7) a metric ton of carbon
emissions. The levy is about one-sixth the A$23 a ton  Australia 
set for 300 of its largest polluters in the year started July 1.  Japan may be forced to spend 22.6 trillion yen ($289
billion) on fossil fuels, such as natural gas, crude oil and
coal, to replace nuclear  power plants  shut for safety checks
after the Fukushima disaster, the Institute of Energy Economics
said in a July 2 report. These rising costs may cause a trade
deficit for the second straight year through March 2013, the
institute said.  “We urge the government to reconsider the carbon tax,
including the possibility of killing it,” Masami Hasegawa,
senior manager of environmental policy at the  Japan Business
Federation  known as Keidanren, said by phone on Sept. 26.
“Higher power prices would push Japanese companies offshore and
lead to job losses,” he said.  Keidanren is headed by Sumitomo Chemical Co. Chairman
Hiromasa Yonekura and counts executives from Toyota Motor Corp.,
Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd. and  Nippon Steel Corp. (5401)  among
its leaders.  The Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry said in a
statement in July it’s “concerned about the carbon tax’s impact
on small and mid-sized businesses.”  Limited Impact  The tax will be raised in stages until April 2016 to 780
yen ($10) per ton for liquefied petroleum and natural gases, 760
yen per kiloliter for crude oil and oil products, and 670 yen
per ton for coal, according to  the environment ministry .  Japan’s measure will have a limited impact on efforts to
cut emissions, said  Yugo Nakamura , a Tokyo-based analyst for
Bloomberg New Energy Finance.  “The tax translates to a gasoline price hike of less than
1 yen per liter,” he said. “There is little effect on
suppressing demand,” he said on Sept. 26.  The revenue from the tax on fossil fuels is estimated to be
39.1 billion yen for the year ending in March and 262.3 billion
yen once the tax is raised to the full amount.  The government plans to spend the revenue on clean energy
and energy saving projects, according to the environment
ministry.  An average household is expected to pay an additional 1,200
yen per year by 2016 if all added energy costs are passed on to
consumers, according to an estimate posted on the ministry’s
website.  The carbon tax was approved by Japan’s cabinet in December
as part of a broader tax package and won parliamentary approval
in March. In July, Japan began an incentive program requiring
utilities to pay above-market rates to companies producing power
from renewable energy, with the added cost passed on to
consumers as surcharges.  -- With assistance from Yuji Okada in  Tokyo . Editor: Peter
