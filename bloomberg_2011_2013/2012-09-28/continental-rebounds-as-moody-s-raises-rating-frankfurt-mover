Continental AG (CON) ,  Europe ’s second-
largest auto-parts maker, snapped four days of losses in
Frankfurt trading as Moody’s Investors Service upgraded its
ratings on the company’s debt one level to Ba2 from Ba3.  Continental shares  rose  as much 1.8 percent and were up 1.7
percent at 77.04 euros as of 11:38 a.m. local time after
retreating 9.4 percent in the first four days of trading this
week. The stock has gained 60 percent this year, valuing
Hanover, Germany-based Continental at 17 billion euros ($21.9
billion.)  The move reflected the “continued improvement” of
Continental’s financial metrics during the course of this year
and the one-level upgrade today of Continental’s major
shareholder, Schaeffler AG, to a B1 corporate family rating,
Moody’s said in a statement.  Continental, Europe’s second-largest tiremaker, raised its
2012 revenue and profit outlook in August after second-quarter
profit jumped on lower raw material costs. Stronger earnings and
a 1.1 billion-euro share sale in 2010 helped Continental reduce
debt to 6.88 billion euros in June from a peak of 10.9 billion
euros in 2007.  Continental returned to  Germany ’s benchmark  DAX index  on
Sept. 6 after a 45-month absence in a sign of its recovery from
debt woes that invited a takeover bid from Schaeffler.  Continental’s outlook was changed to positive from stable
by Moody’s, reflecting the credit rating company’s expectation
that Continental “will continue to generate positive free  cash
flow  in the coming years and apply this to debt reduction” and
that operations will improve “mainly as a result of a material
turnaround in the powertrain division.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
