Heeter Construction Inc., a closely
held construction and engineering company, received a $94.8
million federal contract to upgrade the Bluestone Dam in West
Virginia.  The company will receive $55 million from the U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers in the 2012 fiscal year, which runs through
September, and the balance through 2015, Tony Rathbun, a
spokesman for Spencer, West Virginia-based Heeter, said in a
telephone interview today. The contract was awarded Sept. 26.  The company will install about 115 anchors, which will
reinforce the dam’s foundation, Rathbun said.  “We’re installing the anchors to stabilize the dam for
what’s called a ‘probable maximum flood,’” Rathbun said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
