MGIC Investment Corp. (MTG) , the U.S.
mortgage insurer that breached regulators’ capital limits, said
it cut in half to $100 million the amount it must put into an
underwriting subsidiary to continue writing policies nationwide.  The deadline for the capital contribution, originally set
for the end of this month, was extended to Dec. 1, Milwaukee-
based MGIC said today in a statement distributed by PR Newswire.  MGIC’s eight straight losses on costs tied to soured home
loans pushed the firm’s ratio of risk relative to capital above
limits set by some state regulators. Falling capital levels
could impair the firm’s ability to sell new policies that
protect lenders when mortgage borrowers default and foreclosures
fail to recoup costs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
