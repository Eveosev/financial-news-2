The leu weakened to the lowest in
more than a month as  Romania ’s  Finance Ministry  increased the
size of its monthly borrowing program.  The currency depreciated 0.5 percent to 4.5389 per euro by
5 p.m. in Bucharest, the lowest intraday level since Aug. 14,
bringing the quarterly loss to 2 percent. Yields on the 2018
euro-denominated bonds increased two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 4.847 percent.  The ministry said it will borrow 4.15 billion lei ($1.2
billion) and 150 million euro ($194 billion) in October,
compared with 3.3 billion lei in September and 2.4 billion lei
in August. Romania, which has been embroiled in a power struggle
between President Traian Basescu and Prime Minister Victor Ponta
over the past three months, has sold less debt than planned on
the domestic market in June, July and August.  “The leu is driven by politics and the state’s financing
needs,” Monica Croitoru, a Bucharest-based economist at Societe
Generale SA wrote in note today.  The ministry raised more local debt than planned in
September for the first time since April, adding 4.54 billion
lei. It also sold 750 million euros of euro-denominated bonds
maturing in 2018 on Sept. 4.  Banca Nationala a Romaniei kept its  interest rate  unchanged
at 5.25 percent at a policy meeting this week, matching all 18
economists’ estimates  in a Bloomberg  survey. Inflation rose to
3.9 percent in August, the highest in a year, as a drought
pushed up food prices in Romania.  The political struggle led to Basescu’s impeachment vote in
July, which was subsequently invalidated by the country’s
 Constitutional Court  due to lower than required turnout. The
president returned to office at the end of August.  “The volatility could increase in the next few months,”
as the country plans to hold parliamentary elections on Dec. 9,
Croitoru said, referring to the currency.
