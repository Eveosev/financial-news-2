AMR Corp.’s unrestricted cash and
short-term investments fell by $535 million in August, the
parent of American Airlines Inc. said in an operating report.  The net loss for the month was $82 million, according to
the report filed yesterday in  U.S. Bankruptcy Court  in
Manhattan. Contributing to the loss were $53 million of interest
expenses and $86 million in reorganization items, including $18
million in professional fees. Operating income was $55 million
on operating revenue of $2.19 billion.  Revenue in August declined 6 percent from July’s
$2.33 billion. In July, operating income was $240 million.  Operating activities consumed $304 million in cash in
August, according to the consolidated cash flow statement in the
operating report. Cash and short-term investments of
$4.84 billion at the end of July declined to $4.3 billion by
Aug. 31. AMR had another $846 million in restricted cash.  AMR, based in  Fort Worth ,  Texas , has used bankruptcy powers
to shed 32 aircraft in the mainline fleet. With negotiating
leverage provided by Chapter 11, the company said it “revised
economic terms” for 155 planes. It agreed to retain 340 in the
mainline fleet.  AMR listed assets of $24.7 billion and debt totaling
$29.6 billion in the reorganization begun in November.  The case is In re AMR Corp., 11-15463, U.S. Bankruptcy
