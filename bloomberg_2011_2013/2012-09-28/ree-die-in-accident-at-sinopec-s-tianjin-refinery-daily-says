Three people have been killed in an
accident at  China Petroleum & Chemical Corp. (600028) ’s refinery in
Tianjin city, according to the official People’s Daily.  Falling cement caused by strong wind broke a platform which
buried the workers during maintenance of a catalytic unit at the
plant yesterday afternoon, the newspaper  said  on its website
today, citing local authorities. Lv Dapeng, the Beijing-based
spokesman for  China  Petroleum, or Sinopec, didn’t answer three
calls to his office during working hours.  The Tianjin refinery in northern China has been shut for
maintenance since Aug. 15 and will resume operations by early
October, a company official said last month. The People’s Daily
didn’t say whether the schedule will be affected by the
accident. The plant has a crude-processing capacity of about
300,000 barrels a day, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Separately, China Petrochemical Corp., Sinopec’s parent
company, said yesterday that it will ask two refineries with a
total capacity of 370,000 barrels a day and a chemical facility
to suspend production after the state television station
reported criticism of the plants by the Ministry of
Environmental Protection.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
