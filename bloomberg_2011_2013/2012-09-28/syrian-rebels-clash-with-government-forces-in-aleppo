Syrian troops loyal to President
Bashar al-Assad clashed with rebels in the commercial hub of
Aleppo as the insurgents started what they called a “decisive
battle” to take over the nation’s largest city.  The main insurgent force in the northern city of 3 million
people, the Tawheed Brigade, said on its Facebook page that its
fighters entered the Sheikh Maqsoud neighborhood.  Syria ’s state-
run TV said four civilians, including two children, were killed
today by rebel mortar rounds. Government forces killed large
numbers of “terrorists” in several neighborhoods, it said.  Syrian rebels have been fighting to overthrow Assad since
March last year in a conflict that has left at least 30,000
people dead, according to estimates by the Syrian Observatory
for Human Rights, an opposition group.  Syrian TV also reported fighting on the outskirts of
Damascus. The U.K.-based observatory said government forces
stormed several suburbs of the capital, destroying homes and
arresting civilians.  At least 81 people have been killed in Syria today,
including 46 in Aleppo, according to the Local Coordination
Committees in Syria.  The United Nations  Human Rights  Council today approved
extending the mission of its independent commission of inquiry.
An EU statement called on Syrian authorities to “immediately
put an end to the violence and condemned in the strongest terms
the gross human-rights violations by the Syrian authorities
which may amount to crimes against humanity.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
