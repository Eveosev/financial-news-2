The euro area’s economic slump
probably eased in September as investors grew more optimistic
about the outcome of the region’s debt crisis, the  Eurocoin
index  showed.  The gauge measuring economic activity in the 17-nation
region rose to minus 0.32 from minus 0.33 in August, the London-
based  Centre for Economic Policy Research  and the  Bank of Italy ,
which co-produce the index, said today in an e-mailed report.  The rise was due to “the improvement in share prices and
the easing of sovereign debt tensions,” according to the
report. Still, the index “was held down by the slightly worse
results of opinion surveys of firms and households.”  The indicator, which includes price developments, stock-
market performance, industrial production and business and
consumer confidence readings, seeks to provide a real-time
estimate of economic growth.  The next update will be published on Oct. 26.  To contact the reporter on this story:
