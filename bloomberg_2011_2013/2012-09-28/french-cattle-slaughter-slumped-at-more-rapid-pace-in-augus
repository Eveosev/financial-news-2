more rapid pace in August compared with the prior month, the

percent from the prior period to 3.26 million head, according to
the ministry.  The number of butchered hogs fell 4.7 percent to 1.99
million last month after dropping 3.9 percent to 1.95 million
animals in July, the data showed. Lamb slaughtering declined 6.8
percent in August to 314,301 animals after falling 8.7 percent
