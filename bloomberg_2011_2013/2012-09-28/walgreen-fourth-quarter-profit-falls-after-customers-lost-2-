Walgreen Co. (WAG) , the largest U.S.
drugstore retailer, said fiscal fourth-quarter profit dropped 55
percent after the loss of customers to rivals hurt sales.  Net income in the quarter ended Aug. 31 fell to $353
million, or 39 cents a share, from $792 million, or 87 cents, a
year earlier, the Deerfield, Illinois-based company said today
in a statement. Sales declined 5 percent to $17.1 billion.  The end of Walgreen’s agreement to provide prescriptions
for  Express Scripts  Holding Co. customers reduced quarterly
profit by 6 cents a share as traffic shifted to  CVS Caremark
Corp. (CVS)  and  Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT)  Walgreen and Express Scripts
renewed that contract in July, making the drugstore chain part
of the benefits provider’s network again Sept. 15.  Walgreen is “encouraged” by the return of former Express
Scripts customers, Chief Executive Officer Greg Wasson told
analysts today on a conference call. He declined to say how many
customers had returned.  Excluding some items, profit in the quarter was 63 cents a
share. Analysts projected 56 cents, the average of estimates
compiled by Bloomberg.  Profit trailed analysts’ estimates after adjusting for an
additional 15 cents per share of charges, according to  Ross Muken , an analyst at International Strategy & Investment Group
in New York. He rates Walgreen underweight, the equivalent of a
sell.  The shares fell 0.4 percent to $36.44 at the close in New
York. Walgreen has advanced 10 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
