A European Union-mandated expert
group will next week publish its blueprint on internal firewalls
that banks should put in place to protect taxpayers and
customers.  The group, led by European Central Bank council member
 Erkki Liikanen , will hand over its report to  Michel Barnier ,
the EU’s financial services chief, on Oct. 2, said Stefaan De
Rynck, a spokesman for Barnier.  Liikanen’s team has weighed options including forcing
lenders to ringfence their retail operations, so shielding them
from losses incurred from  investment banking , according to
documents published on the EU’s website.  Lenders including  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) ,  JPMorgan Chase
& Co. (JPM)  and  Bank of America Corp. (BAC) , have criticized plans by U.S
regulators to ban commercial banks from proprietary trading,
saying the draft measures would increase risk, raise costs for
investors and be vulnerable to legal challenge.  The U.K. is already moving ahead with plans to force the
largest lenders to insulate consumer units from investment
banking, following recommendations last year by a government-
sponsored panel led by  John Vickers .  To contact the reporter on this story:
