The U.S. Treasury said it imposed
sanctions on Japan’s second-biggest yakuza gang for its
involvement in weapons and drug trafficking, prostitution, fraud
and money laundering.  The Tokyo-based Sumiyoshi-kai was targeted under an
executive order to combat transnational criminal organizations,
the Treasury said in a statement yesterday in Washington. Also
sanctioned were the group’s leader Shigeo Nishiguchi and his
deputy Hareaki Fukuda.  “Through this action, we will continue to work toward
disrupting the criminal activities of the Yakuza and dismantling
its financial network,”  David Cohen , Treasury undersecretary
for terrorism and financial intelligence, said in the statement.  President  Barack Obama  identified the yakuza syndicates as
transnational criminal organizations in July 2011 and the
Treasury has already imposed sanctions on the Yamaguchi-gumi,
Japan’s largest gang.  To contact the reporter on this story:
