India ’s 10-year bonds advanced,
pushing yields to a seven-week low, as the government kept its
borrowing target for the second half of the fiscal year
unchanged.  The Finance Ministry plans to raise 2 trillion rupees ($38
billion) in the six months to March, Economic Affairs Secretary
Arvind Mayaram told reporters yesterday. The debt sales will
take the total borrowing for the year to a record 5.69 trillion
rupees, as budgeted. The government cut diesel subsidies this
month and announced plans to revive asset sales to lift revenue.  “The government’s resolve to stick to its borrowing
program is positive for bonds,” said Srinivasa Raghavan, an
executive vice president of treasury at  Dhanlaxmi Bank Ltd. (DHLBK)  in
Mumbai. “Efforts to increase revenue and control the fiscal
deficit is triggering some buying.”  The yield on the 8.15 percent notes due June 2022 fell one
basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 8.15 percent in
Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading system. The rate
has dropped three basis point this quarter.  The finance ministry targets reducing the fiscal  deficit  to
5.1 percent of gross domestic product in the current fiscal year
that began April 1 from 5.8 percent last year.  One-year  interest-rate swaps , or derivative contracts used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, fell three basis
points to 7.63 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The rate fell 18 basis points this quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
