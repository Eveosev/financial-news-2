The Slovak unit of  PSA Peugeot
Citroen (UG)  will suspend production for 21 days in the fourth
quarter as the economic slowdown in western Europe reduces
demand for vehicles, spokesman Peter Svec said.  The move will increase the number of vacation days this
year in Peugeot’s factory in Trnava, western Slovakia, to 33 and
it won’t have any impact on employment, Svec said in an e-mailed
statement today. In 2011, the company suspended production for
39 days.  The carmaker is responding to reduced demand for cars in
western Europe, where consumers are defering purchases amid
concern about the region’s economy. European car registrations
fell 8.5 percent from a year earlier in August, while PSA
Peugeot Citroen’s sales declined 12 percent.  Europe’s second-biggest carmaker assembles Peugeot-brand
207 and 208 models and Citroen C3 Picasso vehicles in Trnava.
Peugeot had planned to produce 240,000 cars in Slovakia this
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
