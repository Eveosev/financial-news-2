Australia  routed  India  by nine
wickets in their Super Eight game at cricket’s World Twenty20
championship, while Pakistan defeated top-ranked South Africa.  Shane Watson and David Warner shared an opening 133-run
stand as Australia reached its total of 141 with 6.1 overs
remaining in the Group 2 game in  Colombo , Sri Lanka.  Watson scored 72, with seven sixes, from 42 balls before
being caught off Yuvraj Singh. Watson was 63 not out with three
sixes among his 10 boundaries.  “That’s the absolute beauty of those two players, when
they’re on, there no two better batters in the world,”
Australian captain George Bailey said in the post-match
presentation.  Earlier, Watson took 3-34 as India was limited to 140-7
after winning the toss and choosing to bat. Irfan Pathan scored
31 for India, which stumbled to 74-5 after losing three wickets
in seven balls.  Pakistan  beat South Africa by two wickets in today’s
opening game. Umar Akmal scored 43 runs and Umar Gul had 32 as
Pakistan finished 136-8 to South Africa’s 133-6.  Pakistan was 76-6 in the 15th over before Umar Akmal and
Umar Gul put it back on track. The two shared a 49-run stand in
just 4.3 overs before Gul was caught by Robin Peterson off Dale Steyn.  Akmal, who top-scored with 43, then hit a six with the
second ball of the final over and clinched the victory with a
four two balls later. Gul scored 32 off 17 balls.  South Africa won the toss and elected to bat. Pakistan’s
spin bowlers took advantage of a slow wicket, with Mohammad Hafeez taking 2-23 and Yasir Arafat 2-25. JP Duminy scored 48

Council’s Twenty20 ranking.  The World Twenty20, generally held every two years, is the
