(Corrects to say Summit has taken stake in special-purpose
company in second paragraph.)  Summit Energy Corp., a unit of
Japanese trading company  Sumitomo Corp. (8053) , will develop a 29-
megawatt wind farm in northern  Japan .  Summit has taken a 95 percent stake in a special-purpose
company to be set up for the project, it said in a  statement 
today. Construction of the plant, to be built in Oga, Akita
prefecture, will start in October and operations are scheduled
to start in December 2014, according to the statement, which
didnâ€™t give a cost estimate for the plant.  The Nikkei newspaper, which first reported on the project
today, said the plant is expected to cost about 7 billion yen
($90 million).  The wind farm will use 12 turbines, made by  Mitsubishi
Heavy Industries Ltd. (7011) , according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
