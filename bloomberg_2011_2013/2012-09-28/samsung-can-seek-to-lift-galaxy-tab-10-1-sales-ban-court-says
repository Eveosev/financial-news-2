Samsung Electronics Co. (005930)  can pursue
its efforts to rescind a ban on U.S. sales of the Galaxy Tab
10.1 tablet computer that’s part of a dispute with  Apple Inc. (AAPL) , a
U.S. appeals court said.  The court said today that U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh in
 San Jose , California, can have jurisdiction to consider whether
to lift the ban, which had been imposed before a patent-
infringement trial that ended last month. The jury found that
Samsung didn’t infringe a design patent that had been the basis
for blocking sales in the U.S.  Apple contends the ban should remain in place because the
jury found the Galaxy Tab infringed other patents. Koh had
refused to act because the ban was on appeal before the  U.S.
Court of Appeals  for the Federal Circuit. She said she might
permit sales if granted jurisdiction.  The Federal Circuit said it isn’t taking a position on how
Koh should decide the issue.  After the Federal Circuit posted its order, Samsung renewed
its request with Koh to lift the sales ban and Apple filed
opposition to the request, according to court filings today.  The case is Apple Inc. v. Samsung Electronics Co., 12-1506,
U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Washington). The
lower court case is Apple Inc. v. Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd.,
11-cv-01846, U.S. District Court, Northern District of
California (San Jose).  To contact the reporter on this story:
