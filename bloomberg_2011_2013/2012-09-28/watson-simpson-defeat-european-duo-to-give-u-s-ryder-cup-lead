Americans Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson defeated Europeans  Paul Lawrie  and  Peter Hanson  in a
fourballs match to give the U.S. a 3-2 lead in golf’s Ryder Cup.  Watson, the reigning Masters Tournament winner, and
Simpson, the U.S. Open champion, beat Lawrie of Scotland and
Hanson of Sweden 5 and 4, meaning they had an insurmountable
five-hole lead with four holes remaining at Medinah Country Club
outside Chicago.  In fourballs, each of the two men on the teams play their
own ball -- with the lowest individual score winning the hole
for the team.  The U.S. and Europe were tied 2-2 after this morning’s
matches. The competition continues through Sept. 30, when there
will be 12 singles matches.  To contact the reporter on this story:
