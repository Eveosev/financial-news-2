Serbiaâ€™s gross domestic product
shrank by 0.8 percent in the second quarter compared with the
comparable period of 2011, as declines in electricity output,
agriculture and mining led the economy down.  It was the second consecutive quarterly contraction and was
bigger than the preliminary estimate of 0.6 percent, the
Statistics Office said today.  The decline in farm output was the steepest, with activity
contracting 17.2 percent, after a 19 percent drop in the first
quarter. Mining activity fell by 7.7 percent, after shrinking
0.6 percent in the first quarter. The decline in electricity
output widened to 14.6 percent, from 3.4 percent.  Financial services rose by 4.2 percent, the biggest
expansion in five quarters.  The first-quarter figures were also revised down; GDP
shrank by 2.5 percent, almost double the 1.3 percent reported
earlier.  Serbia is trying to avoid a second recession in three years
and the government, sworn in on July 27, has prepared anti-
crisis measures to stop the economic decline and bring down
unemployment, which reached 25.5 percent in April.  The slowdown has increased the  budget deficit , the current-
account gap and public debt, which have all exceeded targets
agreed with the  International Monetary Fund  in 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
