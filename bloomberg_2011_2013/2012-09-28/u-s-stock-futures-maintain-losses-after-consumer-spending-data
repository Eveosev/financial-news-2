U.S. stock futures maintained
losses as a report showed consumer spending barely rose in
August after adjusting for inflation.  Standard & Poorâ€™s 500 Index stock futures expiring in
December fell 0.5 percent to 1,433.30 at 8:33 a.m. in New York.  Household purchases rose 0.5 percent, matching the median
estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg and the biggest
gain since February, according to data from the Commerce
Department issued in  Washington  today. The gain mainly reflected
a 0.4 percent jump in prices, the biggest since March 2011,
leaving so-called real spending up 0.1 percent.  A slack job market and higher gasoline prices are squeezing
households, whose spending accounts for 70 percent of the
economy. At the same time, rising stock prices and an improving
housing market are lifting  consumer confidence , which may help
underpin demand.  The S&P 500 has risen 2.9 percent in September and is on
pace for its fourth monthly advance, the longest streak since
March. The index is heading for a 6.2 percent gain this quarter.
Investors bought stocks amid better-than-estimated earnings and
government measures to stimulate the economy.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
