Nigeria  has protested to Saudi
Arabia’s authorities over the detention of more than 1,000
female pilgrims who arrived in the kingdom for the annual Hajj
pilgrimage without male guardians, state-run Radio Nigeria said.  Radio Nigeria said the country has suspended the airlifting
of pilgrims until the matter is resolved. Hatem Qadi, a
spokesman for the Saudi Hajj Ministry, said the rules stipulate
that women below 45 must be accompanied by a male guardian, and
that the condition has been applied for years and is spelled out
on hajj visas.  Saudi Arabia has repatriated more than 1,000 of the
pilgrims, including 508 Nigerian women as well as one man who
arrived back in the country yesterday, the News Agency of
Nigeria said.  Saudi Arabia  enforces restrictions that are interpreted
from the Wahhabi version of Sunni Islam. Women can’t travel or
get an education without male approval or mix with unrelated men
in public places.  To contact the reporter on this story:
