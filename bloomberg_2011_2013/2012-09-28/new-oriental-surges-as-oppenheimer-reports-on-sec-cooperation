New Oriental Education & Technology
Group Inc. (EDU) , a Chinese education service provider, climbed in New
York after Oppenheimer & Co. said the company is cooperating
with regulators in a probe of its financial statements.  American depositary receipts of New Oriental surged 7.2
percent to $16.67, the highest since July 16, at the close of
trading in New York. Shares have climbed 21 percent since Sept.
20. The Beijing-based company fell 34 percent on July 17 after
saying the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission was
investigating the consolidation of its units.  New Oriental Education “has been cooperating with the SEC
closely, and the investigation appears to be entering the Q&A
session,” Ella Ji, an analyst at Oppenheimer in New York, wrote
in an e-mailed report today. A favorable resolution to the SEC
investigation could boost New Oriental shares as much as 61
percent from yesterday’s closing price, she said.  New Oriental said in July that the SEC is investigating
“whether there is a sufficient basis for the consolidation of
Beijing New Oriental Education & Technology (Group) Co., a
variable interest entity of the Company, and its wholly-owned
subsidiaries, into the Company’s consolidated financial
statements.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
