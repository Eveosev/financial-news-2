The New York Yankees lost 6-0 to
the Toronto Blue Jays, cutting their lead over the Baltimore
Orioles in the American League East to one game.  The Yankees’ third defeat in five games leaves them with a
90-66 record as the Major League Baseball season nears its end
Oct. 3. The Orioles (89-67), who were idle last night, have one
spot in the AL wild-card race. The other is held by the Oakland
Athletics (88-68), who lost 9-7 to the Texas Rangers last night.  “We know what’s at stake right now and we’ve just got to
go out there and keep picking up wins,” Nick Swisher told
reporters. “We’ve got a little six-game playoff race.”  Brett Lawrie hit a two-run homer in the third inning for
Toronto, Edwin Encarnacion drove in two runs on a fifth-inning
double and another with a  ground-out in the seventh, and J.P. Arencibia hit a solo home run in the eighth.  Brandon Morrow (9-7) allowed four hits in seven innings for
the win. Ivan Nova dropped to 12-8 after giving up four runs on
six hits in 4 2/3 innings.  “We stayed with a good mix of everything all night, tried
to keep them off balance and not fall into any patterns,”
Morrow told reporters.  Detroit (84-72) widened its lead in the AL Central to two
games as it beat the Kansas City Royals 5-4 and the Chicago
White Sox (82-74) lost 3-2 to the Tampa Bay Rays.  Texas (92-64) is four games ahead of Oakland in the AL West.  The Washington Nationals took their major league-best
record to 95-61 with a 7-3 win over the Philadelphia Phillies.
In the race for the National League East title, the Nationals
are four games ahead of the Atlanta Braves (91-65), who defeated
the Miami Marlins 6-2.  The Braves and the St. Louis Cardinals (84-72), who were
off last night, hold the two NL wild-card places.  To contact the reporter on this story:
