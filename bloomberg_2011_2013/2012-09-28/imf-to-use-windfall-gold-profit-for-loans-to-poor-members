The  International Monetary Fund 
said today it agreed to distribute $2.7 billion in windfall
profits from gold sales to subsidize loans to poor countries.  The IMF’s 188 members will receive a payment in proportion
to their weight within the institution, the IMF said in an e-
mailed statement today. As a pre-condition, countries must give
assurances that they’ll make at least 90 percent of the $2.7
billion available to a  trust fund  that lends to low-income
countries at zero percent interest rates.  “The strategy endorsed today by the executive board
ensures the IMF is better positioned to help our low-income
members absorb future shocks and underpin their efforts to
achieve stronger and sustainable economic growth,” IMF Managing
Director  Christine Lagarde  said in the statement.  The gold sales took place in 2009-2010 as part of the
fund’s plan to shore up its finances. It brought in about $3.8
billion more than expected because of higher than anticipated
gold prices.  The IMF already agreed to use about $1.1 billion of
windfall profit through the same process, and member countries
are close to giving assurances they will distribute 90 percent
from that round to poor countries, according to the statement.  To contact the reporters on this story:
