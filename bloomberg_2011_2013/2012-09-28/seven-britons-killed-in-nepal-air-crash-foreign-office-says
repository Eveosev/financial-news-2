Seven British nationals were among
19 people killed in an  airplane crash  in Nepal today, the
Foreign Office said in a  statement  posted on its website.  Prime Minister  David Cameron , who is on a trade visit to
 Brazil , said the U.K. government is doing everything it can to
help the families of those who died.  “It is an absolutely horrific incident and obviously I
feel for the families concerned,” Cameron told reporters in Rio
de Janeiro. “We will have to find out exactly what happened. It
is a deeply, deeply tragic case.”  The Sita Air plane was on a flight to the Everest region
when it crashed shortly after taking off from Kathmandu. The
aircraft got into difficulty after hitting a vulture,  the BBC
reported , citing airport officials.  John Tucknott, the British ambassador to Nepal, said his
staff is offering consular assistance to the bereaved and that
he has visited the Tribhuvan University hospital, where the
casualties were taken.  “We’ve had excellent cooperation from the Nepalese
authorities and the Nepali police and have been in touch with
the local tour company who were arranging the tour,” Tucknott
said in a statement. “Our thoughts at the moment are with the
friends and families of those who lost their lives this
morning.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
