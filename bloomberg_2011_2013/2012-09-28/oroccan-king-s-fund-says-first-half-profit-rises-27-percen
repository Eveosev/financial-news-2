Societe Nationale d’Investissement,
a Moroccan investment fund controlled by King Mohammed VI, said
its profit rose 27 percent in the first half of this year,
according to the financial statement published by the company in
Le Matin newspaper.  Net income increased to 2.8 billion Moroccan dirhams ($326
million) in six months to June from 2.2 billion a year ago,
according to the statement.  The increase in income is due to “the sale of  Lesieur
Cristal (LES)  and the capital increase of  Attijariwafa Bank (ATW)  announced
in the first half of 2012,” Karim Chbani, an investment manager
at the fund, said in an e-mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
