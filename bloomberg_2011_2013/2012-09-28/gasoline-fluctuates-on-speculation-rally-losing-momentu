Gasoline rose to a five-month high
as refinery maintenance in the Atlantic Basin stoked concerns
about supplies in  New York  Harbor.  Prices rose as refineries in Canada,  Wales  and the
Netherlands that supply the U.S. East Coast reduced fuel
production. Supplies in the region, which includes New York
Harbor, the delivery point for futures contracts, are the lowest
in almost four years, Energy Department data show.  “The underlying reason for the gasoline rally is the
refinery maintenance program,” said  Gene McGillian , an analyst
and broker at Tradition Energy in Stamford,  Connecticut .
“Concerns about really tight supplies are going to hang over
the market for the next couple months.”  Gasoline for October delivery rose 6.74 cents, or 2.1
percent, to $3.2117 a gallon at 1:01 p.m. on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . Prices touched $3.25, the highest intraday
level since April 17.  Futures are up 3.4 percent for the month and 18 percent
this quarter.  The more actively traded November contract gained 1.19
cents, or 0.4 percent, to $2.9091. October gasoline and heating
oil contracts will expire at the end of floor trading today. The
premium of October over November increased to 30.26 cents a
gallon, the widest gap between the front two contracts since
Aug. 31, 2005.  Turnaround Period  U.S. gasoline  inventories  fell 481,000 barrels to 195.8
million barrels last week, the ninth consecutive decline and the
lowest level since October 2008, according to department data.
Output slid 2.1 percent to the lowest level in 10 weeks.  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) ’s 400,000-barrel-a-day Pernis plant
in the Netherlands is conducting maintenance until early
November. Irving Oil Corp. is performing maintenance on sections
of the 298,800-barrel-a-day Saint John refinery in  New
Brunswick , which exports more than half of its output to the
U.S. East Coast.  Valero Energy Corp. (VLO)  shut all the main
production units at its Pembroke refinery in Wales while the
plant’s only crude unit undergoes an eight-week turnaround.  October-delivery heating oil rose 0.67 cent to $3.164 a
gallon on the exchange. Prices are down 0.2 percent this month
and have gained 17 percent since June. The November contract
gained 0.28 cent to $3.1536.  Regular gasoline  at the pump, averaged nationwide, fell 0.8
cent to $3.787 a gallon yesterday, AAA data show. Prices have
fallen 13 of the past 14 days, declining 2.2 percent in that
span. Prices reached a 2012 high of $3.936 on April 4.  To contact the reporter on this story:
