The forint headed for a second week
of declines after  Hungary ’s central bank cut its benchmark rate
for the second month in a row and announced a  current-account
surplus  below investors’ expectations.  The forint weakened 0.7 percent to 286.12 per euro by 4:26
p.m. in Budapest, bringing its five-day depreciation to 1.4
percent, the most among more than 20 emerging-market currencies
tracked by Bloomberg. It has advanced less than 0.1 percent
since the end of June, the third consecutive quarter of gains,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The yield on Hungary’s
benchmark five-year bonds rose one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 6.82 percent, the data show.  The Magyar Nemzeti Bank reduced its benchmark two-week
 deposit rate  on Sept. 25 by 25 basis points to 6.5 percent,
still the highest in the 27-member European Union, to help
Hungary emerge from a recession. It cut the  base rate  by the
same amount in August. Hungary’s current-account surplus was
smaller than estimated in the second quarter, the bank said
today, while revised data showed a deficit in the previous three
months.  “We see upward risks to our euro-forint forecasts” of
282.5 on Dec. 31, 2012 and 275 at the end of 2013 because of the
weaker current-account balance as well as rate cuts, Zoltan Arokszallasi and Orsolya Nyeste, Budapest-based economists at
Erste Group Bank AG, wrote in an e-mailed report today.  The surplus was 519 million euros ($671 million), compared
with a revised 7 million-euro shortfall in the first quarter and
a surplus of 398 million euros a year earlier, the bank said.
The median projection in a Bloomberg survey of seven economists
was for a 550 million-euro surplus. The seasonally-adjusted
current-account surplus was 367 million euros, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
