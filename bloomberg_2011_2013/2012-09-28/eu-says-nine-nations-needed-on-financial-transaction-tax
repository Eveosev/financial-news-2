The European Commission responded
to a letter from German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble and
his French counterpart Pierre Moscovici urging action on a
financial-transaction tax by reiterating that nine countries
must submit formal requests for the plan to move forward.  In June, European Union finance ministers cleared the way
for a smaller group of countries to proceed after it became
clear there would not be unanimous support for an agreement
among all 27 countries in the bloc.  “Even if implemented among a more limited group of member
states, this tax offers real benefits,” EU Tax Commissioner
Algirdas Semeta said today in an e-mailed statement. “We’d urge
the other interested member states to now submit their requests
as quickly as they can.”  Schaeuble and Moscovici today wrote the EU urging a push to
design a tax under “enhanced cooperation” procedures. They
also called on other nations to support the measure. Seven more
states must submit requests.  “With this joint move, Germany and  France  are
demonstrating the necessity of an integrated European approach
to the taxation of financial markets and to combatting the
effects of the financial crisis,” the German Finance Ministry
said in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
