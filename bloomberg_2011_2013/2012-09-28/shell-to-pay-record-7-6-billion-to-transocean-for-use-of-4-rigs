Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) , Europe’s
largest oil company, agreed to pay a record $7.6 billion to
Transocean Ltd. for use of four new offshore drilling rigs over
a period of 10 years.  Transocean, the world’s largest offshore drilling company,
will invest about $3 billion, excluding interest, to build the
ultra-deepwater drillships, the Vernier, Switzerland-based
company said today in a statement. The first vessel will be
supplied in mid-2015 with the remaining three  expected to be
delivered at approximately six-month intervals thereafter.  “These four contracts, at 10 years a piece, or 40 rig
years, are a record for the company,”  Guy Cantwell , a spokesman
at Transocean said by phone. Shell payments don’t include
mobilization costs.  The rigs will be able to operate in water as deep as 12,000
feet (3,650 meters) and drill wells to 40,000 feet, Transocean
said. They will be constructed at the Daewoo Shipbuilding &
Marine Engineering Co. facility in South Korea.  To contact the reporters on this story:
