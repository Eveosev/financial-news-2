Ethanol rose the most in 18 months,
capping the best quarter since March 2011, following a
government report showing an unexpected drop in corn inventories
that may lead to higher production costs.  Prices surged after the Agriculture Department said corn
stockpiles left from last year’s U.S. harvest totaled 988
million bushels on Sept. 1, down 12 percent from 1.128 billion a
year earlier and below the 1.145 billion forecast in a Bloomberg
survey. The grain is used to make ethanol in the U.S.  “The trade got caught off guard,” said Mike Blackford, a
consultant at INTL FCStone Group in Des Moines,  Iowa . “Ethanol
followed. It’s kind of a big circle when you get down to it.”  Denatured ethanol for October delivery climbed 12.1 cents,
or 5.4 percent, to settle at $2.344 a gallon on the  Chicago 
Board of Trade, the biggest gain since March 31, 2011. The
futures jumped 5 percent during the third quarter, the most
since the first three months of 2011.  In cash market trading, ethanol on the West Coast surged 15
cents, or 6.5 percent, to $2.455 a gallon and in the U.S. Gulf
the additive increased 10 cents, or 4.3 percent, to $2.405, data
compiled by Bloomberg shows.  Ethanol in Chicago added 9.5 cents, or 4.3 percent, to
$2.315 a gallon and in New York the biofuel rose 9.5 cents, or
4.1 percent, to $2.395.  Corn for December delivery advanced the exchange-limit 40
cents, or 5.6 percent, to $7.5625 a bushel in Chicago. One
bushel makes at least 2.75 gallons of ethanol.  Gasoline for October delivery jumped 19.77 cents, or 6.3
percent, to $3.342 a gallon in New York. The contract covers
reformulated gasoline, which is made to be blended with ethanol
before delivery to filling stations.  The motor fuel widened its  premium  to ethanol to 99.8 cents
from 92.13 yesterday, the highest since April 27, on concern
that lower output from refineries in  Canada ,  Wales  and the
Netherlands will tighten supply of the fuel on the U.S. East
Coast.  To contact the reporter on this story:
