Slovakia’s government approved
higher income-tax rates, abolishing the current flat-rate
regime, as the east euro-region member seeks to boost revenue to
cut its budget  deficit .  If approved by parliament, the corporate income-tax rate
will rise 4 percentage points to 23 percent, effective next
year. The Cabinet in capital Bratislava also decided to impose a
top rate for the highest earning individuals of 25 percent,
compared with the current flat 19 percent rate, according to the
government’s website.  The administration of  Robert Fico  is striving to cut the
 budget deficit  below the European Union’s limit of 3 percent of
gross domestic product next year to prevent contagion from the
euro-area’s debt crisis. By focusing on wealthy individuals and
companies, Fico seeks to meet his election pledge to minimize
the impact of fiscal measures on the poorest citizens at a time
when the economy is slowing.  The government, in power since April, has already adopted
revenue-boosting measures worth 1.5 billion euros ($1.9 billion)
by 2013. The tax increase, combined with some other planned
moves, shall raise an additional 500 million euros next year,
according to the  Finance Ministry .  To contact the reporter on this story:
