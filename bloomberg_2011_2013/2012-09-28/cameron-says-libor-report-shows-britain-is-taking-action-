Prime Minister  David Cameron  said
today’s report proposing an overhaul of the Libor regime showed
Britain is “taking action” to boost confidence in the finance
industry.  “Financial services are a key industry for Britain and
something we are respected for round the world,” Cameron told
 Sky News  in  Rio de Janeiro , Brazil, where he leading a trade
delegation. “Let’s make sure we have a strong, safe and
properly regulated financial services industry, but there is
much more we can do to grow our manufacturing, our technology,
our aerospace and that is what this government is doing.”  Oversight of Libor will be handed to the U.K.’s financial
regulator, and dozens of the currencies and maturities that make
up the benchmark axed, under proposals published by Financial
Services Authority Managing Director Martin Wheatley today. The
overhaul is designed to revive confidence in a rate tarnished by
scandal.  Cameron said Britain needs to develop commercial ties with
leading  emerging markets  as the country reduces its reliance of
state spending and financial services.  “What I’m doing is what is vital for Britain which is
linking us to the fastest growing economies in the world,” he
said. “We have taken difficult decisions, we have had to make
tough cuts to get our deficit down.”  In an interview with the newspaper Folha de  Sao Paulo 
published yesterday, Cameron pointed out that the U.K. accounts
for only 1.5 percent of Brazil’s imports while  Germany  accounts
for 6.4 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
