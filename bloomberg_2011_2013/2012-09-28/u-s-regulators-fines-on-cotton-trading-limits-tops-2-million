U.S. regulators imposed more than
$2 million in fines this week involving excessive speculation in
the cotton market during 2010 and 2011, when prices more than
tripled on their way to a record high before plunging.  JPMorgan (JPM)  Chase Bank, a unit of JPMorgan Chase & Co., agreed
to pay a  penalty  of $600,000 and  Australia & New Zealand Banking
Group Ltd. (ANZ)  was also  ordered  to pay $350,000, the U.S. Commodity
Futures Trading Commission said yesterday in separate
statements. On Sept. 25, the  agency  said Sheenson Investments
Ltd. and its founder Ge Weidong, based in Shanghai,  China ,
agreed to pay $1.5 million.  Cotton surged to an all-time high of $2.197 a pound on ICE
Futures U.S. in  New York  on March 7, 2011, from 66.55 cents on
Feb. 5, 2010, amid rising demand from China. The commodity then
plunged to less than $1 by July 2011, and closed yesterday at
71.53 cents. Volatility led to a tripling of disputes over
supply contracts in the first quarter of 2012 from a year
earlier, the International Cotton Association estimates.  “The penalties are long overdue,” Jordan Lea, the
chairman of Eastern Trading Co., a cotton exporter in
Greenville,  South Carolina , said in an e-mail. “They may
actually give market participants a bit of confidence as we all
knew there were untoward things going on. We just did not know
who or whom to hold accountable.”  In 2010, New York-based JPMorgan exceeded held net-short
position in New York cotton futures in excess of CFTC
speculative position limits on several days between Sept. 16 and
Oct. 5, the CFTC said in a statement. The limit is 3,500
contracts in a single month and 5,000 contracts in all months
combined. The bank declined to comment through  Jennifer
Zuccarelli , a spokeswoman in New York.  Cotton, Wheat  ANZ, based in  Melbourne , exceeded the cotton limit on one
day in February 2011 and those for wheat on the Chicago Board of
Trade in August 2010, the CFTC said.  “These breaches of CFTC regulations were inadvertent,
technical in nature and confined to a small number of
transactions,” ANZ Chief Risk Officer Nigel Williams said in an
e-mailed statement. “Ensuring we are compliant with regulations
is a key priority in every part of ANZ.”  Sheenson Investments agreed to pay a “disgorgement” fine
of $1 million for ill-gotten gains and a $500,000 civil penalty
to settle the charges that they exceeded speculative position
limits in soybean-oil and cotton futures, the CFTC said in a
Sept. 25 statement. Seven calls to Sheenson from Bloomberg in
 Shanghai  were not answered.  To contact the reporter on this story:
