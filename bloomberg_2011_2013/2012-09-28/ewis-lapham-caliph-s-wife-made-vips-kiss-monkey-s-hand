When he ascended the throne in 786
A.D., Caliph Harun al-Rashid oversaw an Islamic empire
stretching from the Atlantic to  India , and his court in Baghdad
was suitably magnificent.  (To listen to the podcast, click  here .)  Harun married six times and fathered 25 children with his
wives and concubines, but he never put aside Zubaidah, his first
consort.  She built herself a palace of ivory and gold, had a large
bodyguard of Koran-reciting slave girls and often wore so many
jewels she needed aides to hold her up.  Zubaidah had a favorite pet monkey: It was dressed in a
cavalry uniform and had 30 servants to attend to every need.
Anyone wishing to speak with the Caliph’s wife -- generals
included -- had to kiss the monkey’s hand.  I spoke with Benson Bobrick, author of “The Caliph’s
Splendor: Islam and the West in the Golden Age of Baghdad,” on
the following topics:  1. Harun al-Rashid  2. Islamic Armies  3. Baghdad Shines  4. Wives & Concubines  5. Knowledge Saved  To buy this book in North America, click  here .  ( Lewis Lapham  is the founder of  Lapham’s Quarterly  and the
