European Union carbon permits
erased gains after the blocâ€™s regulatory arm and member states
agreed a preliminary calendar for sales of allowances for the
next phase of the emissions trading system.  EU permits for December dropped as much as 1.3 percent to
7.76 euros ($9.97) a metric ton and were at 7.84 euros on the
ICE Futures Europe exchange as of 4:20 p.m. in  London .  To contact the reporters on this story:
