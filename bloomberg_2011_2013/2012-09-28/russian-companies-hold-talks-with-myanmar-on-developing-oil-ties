Russian companies are seeking a
role in Myanmar’s oil and gas industry as the Southeast Asian
nation prepares natural-resource auctions after the removal of
U.S. sanctions, the Russian embassy in Yangon said.  Companies are in talks with Myanmar’s Energy Ministry and
state oil producer to gather information on available resources
and are studying terms for foreign participation, the embassy
said in an e-mail, without identifying any of the companies.  The U.S. dropped economic sanctions in July following
Myanmar’s elections. Russia, which hadn’t supported the
imposition of sanctions outside the mandate of the  United
Nations , welcomed their cancellation, according to the embassy.  OAO Gazprom (OGZD) , Russia’s gas-export monopoly, is one company
seeking to develop relations with Myanmar, according to
information on its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
