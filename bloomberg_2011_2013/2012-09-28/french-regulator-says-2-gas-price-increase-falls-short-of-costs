French natural-gas suppliers are
taking the government to court over its decision to cap an
increase in regulated rates at 2 percent, a year after they won
a legal victory against the previous administration.  “The government has decided to continue to politicize the
setting of gas rates,” the group known as Anode, which
represents competitors to the former  GDF Suez (GSZ)  SA monopoly, said
today in a statement.  GDF Suez, which is 35 percent owned by the state, was
allowed to raise gas prices for households by 2 percent from
October, less than it had requested. The government said at the
time its decision was based on the need to safeguard the
interests of consumers.  France ’s regulator has ruled the latest increase should
have been 6.1 percent for households in order for distributors
to cover their costs of supply.  “The opening of the market is seriously threatened,”
according to Anode, which includes companies such as Direct
Energie. The financial health of the distributors is at risk and
the fact the increase comes at the start of winter adds impetus
to their case, it said.  Regulated rates that are too low are an entry barrier to
alternative suppliers to the market and a “lack of visibility”
on rates won’t encourage new market participants, the regulator
said last month.  Anode and GDF Suez took the former government to court last
year after being prevented from passing on supply costs to
consumers. The court ruled in favor of Anode and the utility.  To contact the reporter on this story:
