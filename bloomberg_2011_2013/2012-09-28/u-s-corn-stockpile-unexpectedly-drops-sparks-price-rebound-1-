-- Corn prices surged the most in
three months after the U.S. reported an unexpected plunge in
domestic inventories to an eight-year low, signaling stronger
demand for the grain.  Stockpiles left from last year’s harvest in the U.S., the
world’s biggest grower and exporter, totaled 988 million bushels
on Sept. 1, down 12 percent from 1.128 billion a year earlier,
the U.S. Department of Agriculture said today in a  report .
Analysts in a Bloomberg survey expected 1.145 billion, on
average. Wheat inventories fell to a four-year low, and sorghum
 reserves  were the smallest since 1996, the agency said.  Grain supplies were tightening as record Midwest heat in
June and July sparked the worst drought since 1956, causing crop
damage that insurers estimate may double payouts to U.S. farmers
this year to more than $20 billion. Corn prices have surged 49
percent since mid-June, boosting costs that already are forcing
output cuts by meat companies including  Sanderson Farms Inc. (SAFM)  and
ethanol makers including  Valero Energy Corp. (VLO)   “With corn inventories less than a billion bushels and
wheat and sorghum stocks also shrinking, the grain trade is
looking at a very tight supply situation,” Mark Schultz, the
chief analyst for Northstar Commodity Investment Co. in
 Minneapolis , said in a telephone interview. “This report
signals that demand has not slowed, shifting the focus to the
smaller harvest expected this year.”  Price Rally  Corn futures for December delivery rose by the 40-cent
limit on the Chicago Board of Trade to close at $7.5625 a bushel
at 2 p.m. That 5.6 percent gain was the biggest for the most-
active contract since June 25. Before the report, the price
slipped to $7.05, the lowest since July 12 and 17 percent below
the record of $8.49 reached on Aug. 10.  The USDA this month predicted a harvest of 10.727 billion
bushels, a drop of 13 percent from last year and down from
10.779 billion forecast in August. The agency, which had been
predicting a record crop in June, before the drought, will
update its projections for major crops on Oct. 11.  Today’s stockpile tally showed a decline from the USDA’s
Sept. 12 report, when the agency predicted an increase to 1.181
billion bushels because some of this year’s  harvest  may have
been consumed in place of the 2011 crop. Dry weather allowed
farmers before Sept. 1 to collect grain that normally isn’t
ready until October. The government said that 1.2 billion
bushels of this year’s crop were available for consumption
before Sept. 1, about 700 million more than a year earlier.  Less Output  Rabobank  said in an e-mailed report today that the
inventory estimate probably includes some grain from the 2012
crop, suggesting feed demand was larger than implied in the
government report. Production this year probably will drop to
10.2 billion bushels, or 4.9 percent less than the USDA
forecast, the bank said.  The government probably will boost its price forecast,
which would “be bullish for CBOT corn futures,” Rabobank
analysts including Luke Chandler said in the report today.  Declining U.S. output will reduce global supplies by 4.9
percent from a year earlier, the International Grains Council
said today. World growers will harvest 833 million metric tons
in the 2012-2013 crop year, down from 875 million the previous
year, the London-based council said. World inventories before
next year’s harvest will fall to 118 million tons from 135
million estimated this year, the council said.  Soybeans  U.S.  soybean inventories  on Sept. 1 totaled 169 million
bushels, down from 215 million a year earlier, the USDA said.
The average analyst estimate was 130 million bushels. The
department raised its 2011 production figure to 3.094 billion
bushels, up 39 million bushels, or 1.2 percent, from its Sept.
12 estimate.  Soybean consumption in the final quarter of the year ended
Aug. 31 rose to 498 million bushels from 405 million a year
earlier, the USDA said.  “Soybean supplies will be tight for the next six months,”
Dave Marshall, a farm marketing adviser for Toay Commodity
Futures Group LLC in Nashville,  Illinois , said before the
report. “Supplies in South America are headed for a record, and
people are shifting their focus to the start of the planting
season this month in Argentina and  Brazil .”  Soybean futures for November delivery rose 1.9 percent to
settle at $16.01 a bushel in Chicago, paring this week’s decline
to 1.3 percent. The price fell 8.9 percent in September, after
reaching a record $17.89 on Sept. 4 on speculation that August
rains boosted Midwest yields this year.  About 2.634 billion bushels are expected to be harvested
this year, the USDA said in a Sept. 12 report. The figure is 15
percent smaller than today’s revised estimate for 2011.  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $76.5 billion in
2011, followed by soybeans at $35.8 billion, government figures
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
