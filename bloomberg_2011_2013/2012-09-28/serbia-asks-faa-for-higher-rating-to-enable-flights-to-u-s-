Serbia  asked the U.S. Federal
Aviation Administration to “verify” it deserves Category 1
rating that would help open direct flights between the Balkan
country and the U.S.  The procedure may take three to six months to complete and
involves a visit by FAA officials to the Balkan nation to
inspect safety and other aviation standards, Serbia’s  Civil
Aviation Directorate  said today in an e-mailed statement.  The country was downgraded by the FAA in 2004 on
“regulatory shortcomings” and for failing to meet FAA
criteria, “although we did comply with European norms,”
Directorate’s spokeswoman Katarina Andric-Milosavljevic said in
a phone interview.  The upgrade will encourage U.S. carriers to open flights to
Serbia, whereas Serbia’s unprofitable flag carrier, state-owned
JAT Airways AD is not likely to start transatlantic flights
soon, she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
