Federal Reserve Bank of  Dallas 
President Richard Fisher said the U.S. central bank shouldn’t be
faulted for using every tool available to bolster growth, even
if monetary policy on its own can’t revive the job market.  “I don’t think anybody could fault the chairman or the
FOMC for using every tool at its disposal to get the economy up
and running again,” Fisher said to reporters today after a
speech in Dallas, referring to the policy-setting Federal Open
Market Committee and Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke.  The FOMC announced a third round of quantitative easing
this month, saying it will buy $40 billion of mortgage bonds
every month until the employment outlook improves. Policy makers
have a duty to keep prices stable as well as to achieve maximum
employment, and the Fed shouldn’t let inflation rise to support
the labor market, Fisher said.  Inflation isn’t a short-term risk, Fisher said after
speaking at the University of Texas at Dallas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
