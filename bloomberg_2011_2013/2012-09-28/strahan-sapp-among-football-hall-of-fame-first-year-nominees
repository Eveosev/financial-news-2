Defensive linemen Michael Strahan
and Warren Sapp were among 13 National Football League players
named first-year nominees for the Pro Football Hall of Fame.  With eligibility requiring that players be retired for five
seasons, kicker Morten Andersen and quarterback Steve McNair,
who died in 2009, also were among those nominated for the first
time, the Canton, Ohio-based Hall said on its  website .  Other new nominees include guard  Larry Allen , a six-time
All-Pro; running back Priest Holmes; defensive linemen Sam
Adams, Ted Washington and Bryant Young; safety  John Lynch ;
offensive tackle Jonathan Ogden; wide receiver Keenan McCardell;
and center Tom Nalen.  There are a total of 127 nominees for the Hall’s 2013
class, including 89 players, 14 coaches and 24 contributors. The
group will be trimmed to 25 semifinalists in November and 15
finalists in January. Between four and seven new members of the
Hall will be selected on Feb. 2, the day before the  Super Bowl 
in New Orleans.  Strahan, 40, was a four-time All-Pro who played his entire
career with the  New York Giants . His 141.5 sacks are fifth since
the statistic was first kept in 1982. He had a record 22.5 sacks
in 2001, when he was named the Associated Press Defensive Player
of the Year.  Sapp, who played his first nine years with the  Tampa Bay
Buccaneers  and final four with the  Oakland Raiders , retired in
2007 with 96.5 sacks. He was a four-time All-Pro.  Andersen, 52, played from 1982 to 2007, including his first
13 seasons with the New Orleans Saints and eight with the
Atlanta Falcons. A three-time All-Pro, Andersen’s 2,544 points
and 382 games are the most in NFL history.  McNair, who played from 1995 to 2007, was killed by his
girlfriend in what police said was a murder-suicide in July
2009. A three-time Pro Bowl player, he was named the Most
Valuable Player by AP in 2003 while a member of the Tennessee
Titans.  Defensive tackle Curley Culp and linebacker Dave Robinson
were nominated by the Hall’s Seniors Committee in August.  To contact the reporter on this story:
