Wolf Theiss Rechtsanwaelte GmbH, a
Vienna-based  law firm  specializing in central and eastern
 Europe , agreed to buy the Polish unit of  Beiten Burkhardt
Rechtsanwaltsgesellschaft mbH , marking the Austrian firm’s
biggest acquisition as it expands in the region.  Wolf Theiss will add about 37 lawyers including 6 partners
by acquiring the Warsaw office with effect from Jan. 1, the firm
said in an e-mailed statement. Under the agreement, the two
firms will cooperate in Poland on a project-by-project basis,
according to the statement. A price wasn’t disclosed.  Wolf Theiss will have 14 offices and 340 lawyers in
central, eastern and south eastern Europe after the acquisition,
making it the largest integrated law firm in the region,
Managing Partner Erik Steger said. The law firm aims tap rising
demand for legal advice on takeovers and initial public
offerings in  Poland , which was the only country in the European
Union to avoid a recession in 2009.  “We see Warsaw as a strategic location given the growth
prospects of the Polish economy and believe it will provide
significant opportunities and services,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
