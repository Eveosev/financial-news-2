Turkey ’s Deputy Prime Minister
Bulent Arinc said the leadership of the governing Islamist-
rooted party is “open to anyone,” fueling speculation that the
search for a successor to Recep Tayyip Erdogan is on as the
premier prepares for a presidential bid.  The comment came as Erdogan’s  Justice and Development Party 
prepares for a Sept. 30 Congress in Ankara at which the prime
minister is set to be re-elected for what must be his final term
as chairman under current party rules. Erdogan is widely
expected to run for the country’s presidency, an above-party
post, in 2014.  Erdogan told NTV television in an interview late yesterday
that he plans to overhaul the party’s administration at the
congress. A number of regional leaders including  Egypt ’s Mohamed Mursi have been invited to the event, the party has said.  Asked whether Suleyman Soylu or Numan Kurtulmus, two
veteran politicians who recently joined Justice and Development,
might replace Erdogan, Arinc said positions in the party are
open to anyone as long as they are loyal to its principles, the
state-run Anatolia agency reported. Erdogan and Kurtulmus
attended Friday prayers together in Ankara today, Hurriyet
newspaper said.  Erdogan is seeking people “who he can trust and
influence” after his departure, said Fadi Hakura, an analyst at
Chatham House research institute in  London . Seventy-three party
lawmakers, including Erdogan and Arinc, will not be eligible to
stand for parliament again in 2015 because the party’s rules
limit lawmakers to three terms, Hakura said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
