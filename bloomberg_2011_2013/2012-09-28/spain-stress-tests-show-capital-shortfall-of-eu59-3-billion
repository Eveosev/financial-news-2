Spain’s banks have a combined
capital shortfall of 59.3 billion euros, according to a  stress
test  the Spanish government commissioned consultants  Oliver
Wyman  to carry out.  That figure doesn’t include impact of mergers underway or
differed tax assets. Including those two elements, the shortfall
declines to 53.7 billion euros.  Banco Popular Espanol SA (POP)  needs 3.22 billion euros in an
adverse scenario, after the tax impact.  Banco Santander SA (SAN) ,
 Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA (BBVA) ,  CaixaBank (CABK)  SA, Banco Sabadell
SA, Kutxabank,  Bankinter SA (BKT)  and Unicaja need no additional
capital, the Bank of Spain said in a statement.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
