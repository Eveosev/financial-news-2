Jason Varitek was named special
assistant to Red Sox General Manager Ben Cherington, seven
months after he announced the end of a 15-season Major League
Baseball career spent entirely as a catcher with Boston.  “Jason was one of the most respected players of his era
and will be a key voice as we move forward,” Cherington said
yesterday in a statement. “He will be involved in a number of
areas, including major league personnel decisions, evaluations
and mentorship, and instruction of young players.”  Varitek, 40, won the World Series with Boston in 2004 and
2007 and was catcher in a franchise record 1,488 games.  During his career, the switch-hitter and three-time All-
Star batted .256 with 306 doubles, 14 triples, 193 home runs,
757 runs batted in, 614 walks and 664 runs.  In 2005, he received a Gold Glove Award for defense and
became the first Boston catcher to win a Silver Slugger Award.  Varitek is the only player in MLB history to catch four no-
hitters.  To contact the reporter on this story:
