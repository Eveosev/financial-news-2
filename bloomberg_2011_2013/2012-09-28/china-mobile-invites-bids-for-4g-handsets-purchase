China Mobile Ltd. (941) , the world’s
biggest phone company by subscribers, said it has invited bids
for the first large-scale purchase of handsets for its trial
fourth-generation network.  The company met with suppliers at the China Mobile Terminal
Industry Chain Summit in Beijing yesterday to discuss
development of the 3G market and trials of the new 4G system,
Rainie Lei, a Hong Kong-based spokeswoman for the carrier, said
in an e-mail today. The China Daily today reported the carrier
will seek 200,000 4G handsets and data cards in the fourth
quarter, a figure Lei said she couldn’t confirm.  The company is counting on the move to a 4G network, based
on technology known as TD-LTE, to stem the decline in its market
share of users who watch videos and play games on their phones.
Its homegrown 3G network left it unable to offer popular
handsets, including  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s iPhone, which is now available
from both China Unicom ( Hong Kong ) Ltd. and China Telecom Corp.  In the second half of this year, China Mobile will expand
its 4G trial to 20,000 base stations in 13 cities, from seven
cities in the first half, according to a  presentation  posted on
the carrier’s website. That expansion will provide 90 percent
coverage in key areas of Hangzhou, Shenzhen and Guangzhou, the
company said at the time.  By next year, the carrier plans to expand the trial to
200,000 4G base stations.  While China Mobile’s total mobile subscriber base of 693
million users in August represented 65 percent of the market,
its 72 million users of high-speed 3G networks accounted for
just 38 percent of that market, according to data the company
released last week.  China Mobile fell 0.3 percent to HK$85.95 in Hong Kong
trading, paring the stock’s gains this year to 13 percent.  China Mobile already operates a 4G network in Hong Kong,
and offers smartphones there including  ZTE Corp. (000063) ’s Grand X LTE
(T82); Samsung Electronics Co. Galaxy SII;  HTC Corp. (2498) ’s One XL;
and  LG Electronics Inc. (066570) ’s Optimus True.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
