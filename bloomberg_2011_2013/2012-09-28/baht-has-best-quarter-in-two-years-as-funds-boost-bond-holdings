Thailand ’s baht had its biggest
quarterly advance in two years and bonds rose after foreign
investors pumped money into the nation’s sovereign debt.  International funds  purchased  $7.6 billion more government
notes than they sold this quarter through yesterday, according
to data from the Thai Bond Market Association. Southeast Asia’s
second-largest economy grew 4.2 percent in the second quarter,
following a 0.4 percent expansion in the previous three months,
official data show. The  European Central Bank  and the  Federal
Reserve  have announced measures this month to spur growth.  “With Europe and the U.S. taking a monetary-easing stance,
funds tend to move to bonds and stocks in Asia that offer higher
yields,” said Shigehisa Shiroki, chief trader on the Asian and
emerging-markets team at Mizuho Corporate Bank Ltd. in  Tokyo .
“Thailand has solid domestic demand and can probably withstand
some weakening of external demand.”  The baht climbed 3.2 percent this quarter and 1.9 percent
this month to 30.77 per dollar as of 3:17 p.m. in Bangkok,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The currency rose 0.7
percent today and reached 30.66 on Sept. 17, the strongest level
since March 27.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate
swings used to price options, dropped 25 basis points, or 0.25
percentage point, from the end of June to 4.27 percent. The rate
was unchanged today.  The yield on the 3.625 percent bonds due May 2015 dropped
five basis points this quarter to 3.19 percent, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The rate was steady today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
