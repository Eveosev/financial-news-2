Mexican banks’ net outstanding
loans rose 9.6 percent in real terms in August from a year
earlier, according to the central bank.  Net outstanding loans to the private sector rose to 2.18
trillion pesos ($170 billion), the bank said in a report
released today on its website. Outstanding consumer loans
increased 17.3 percent from August last year to 553.8 billion
pesos, the report showed.  Mexican banks’ outstanding loans are likely to grow by at
least 15 percent this year, according to the head of the
nation’s banking and securities regulatory agency. “We expect a
relatively good year,” Guillermo Babatz, president of the
National Banking and Securities Commission, said in an interview
at Bloomberg’s  Mexico  City office Aug. 21 “They’re going to be
growing all across the board.”  In  July , net outstanding loans to the private sector grew
10.2 percent and consumer loans increased 17.5 percent in real
terms from a year earlier, according to the previous lending
report.  Mexico’s central bank kept the overnight lending rate at
4.5 percent for a 29th consecutive meeting on Sept. 7, the only
Group of 20 nation to leave the borrowing cost unchanged and not
step up asset purchases in the past three years. Banxico, as the
central bank is known, will wait until at least 2014 to adjust
rates, according to a Bloomberg survey.  To contact the reporters on this story:
