France  is maintaining its budget
deficit and growth targets for 2013 by increasing taxes on the
wealthiest 10 percent of the population and big companies, Prime
Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault said at a press conference in Paris.  The 2013 budget plans for a deficit equivalent to 3 percent
of gross domestic product and economic growth of 0.8 percent,
Ayrault said following a meeting of President  Francois
Hollande ’s cabinet.  “It’s true we’re asking for an effort of the richest, the
top 10 percent and the top 1 percent in particular,” Ayrault
said. “Big companies of the CAC 40 pay less than the small
companies and sometimes don’t pay at all. So we’re asking them
for an effort.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
