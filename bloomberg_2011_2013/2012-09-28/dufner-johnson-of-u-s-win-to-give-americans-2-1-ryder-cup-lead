The U.S. team of  Jason Dufner  and
 Zach Johnson  defeated Europeans Lee Westwood and Francisco
Molinari in their foursomes match at golfâ€™s Ryder Cup to put the
American squad back into the lead.  Dufner and Johnson secured the win 3 and 2, meaning they
had an insurmountable three-hole lead with two remaining at
Medinah Country Club outside Chicago.  The U.S. leads the matches 2-1.  Phil Mickelson  and Keegan Bradley beat the European team of Luke Donald and Sergio Garcia
4 and 3, before Europe tied the score when Rory McIlroy and
Graeme McDowell beat Americans Jim Furyk and Brandt Snedeker 1-
up on the final hole.  Teammates in foursomes hit alternate shots.  The afternoon session will feature fourballs, in which each
golfer in the two-man teams plays his own ball, with the lowest
individual score winning the hole. The competition continues
through Sunday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
