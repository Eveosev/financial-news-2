Japan ’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  may
rebound if it closes lower than it did four sessions earlier for
a ninth straight day tomorrow, according to a technical
strategist at BBSP SAS in Paris.  The pattern would signal a rally starting in the next one
to four days, Jean-Charles Gand, a senior market strategist at
the research company, said in a phone interview today, citing
indicators developed by Tom DeMark of Market Studies LLC.  The Nikkei sank 3.7 percent to 13,261.82 today, the lowest
since April 18. The measure closed at 14,311.98 four days ago,
meaning it would have to jump at least 7.9 percent to stop the
so-called TD Buy Setup pattern from being triggered, according
to Gand. The Gauge of Japanese stocks has fallen 15 percent from
its May 22 high.  “We ended a cycle of gains in May,” Gand said. “Now
we’re engaged in a three-wave correction.” The strategist said
he is “neutral” on the Nikkei this month, while rating it a
“buy” in the longer term.  A rebound would be the beginning of an advancing phase, to
be followed by a series of losses, Gand said. The Nikkei may
fall to the support level 13,145 this month, he said. That level
represents the 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement of the move
from the low in November to the high last month.  Gand used DeMark indicators to predict on Oct. 3, 2011,
that the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index would rally as much as 20
or 30 percent before resuming losses. The benchmark gauge for
U.S. shares climbed 29 percent through April 2, 2012.  Japanese equities are still the best performing among the
major developed markets this year, with the Topix index and
Nikkei up more than 27 percent. Shares have rallied since mid-November amid speculation that stimulus measures from the
government of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and the  Bank of Japan 
will beat 15 years of deflation.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
