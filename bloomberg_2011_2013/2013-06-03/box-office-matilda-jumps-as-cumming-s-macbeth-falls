In the last full week before
Broadway’s Tony Awards, the musical “Matilda” made a run at
the box office against its main rival, “Kinky Boots.”  “Matilda” sales jumped 5 percent to a best-ever $1.2
million, according to figures released by the trade association
the  Broadway League . “Kinky Boots” dropped 2 percent to $1.3
million.  Many on Broadway regard the Tony race for new musical as
too close to call.  Overall, Broadway sold $23.3 million of tickets in the week
June 2. That’s down 9 percent from the previous week, which
included Memorial Day weekend.  The revival of “Annie” dipped 18 percent to $800,000, its
worst week since  Jane Lynch  stepped into evil Miss Hannigan’s
shoes on May 14. She leaves the show on July 14. Producers were
hoping sales would spike with the celebrity in the role.  Still going strong,  Matt Stone , Robert Lopez and  Trey Parker ’s “The Book of Mormon” sold $1.7 million.  Critically unloved one-person plays dropped to new lows.
Holland Taylor’s “Ann,” about Texas Governor Ann Richards,
fell 19 percent to $195,000. “Macbeth” with  Alan Cumming  lost
18 percent to $287,000. Either would benefit from a cameo by
musical Mormons.  Standing-room only “Lucky Guy” with Tom Hanks grossed
$1.3 million. Likewise, “Motown” sold $1.4 million. Bette Midler continued packing them in as agent Sue Mengers. “I’ll
Eat You Last” sold $748,000.  Other shows playing to near capacity included “Pippin,”
“The  Lion King ,” “Wicked” and “The Phantom of the Opera,”
still thriving after 25 years.  The Tonys are on Sunday night at Radio City  Music Hall ,
broadcast by CBS. Neil Patrick Harris hosts.  Muse highlights include Richard Vines on  dining  and Amanda
Gordon’s  Scene .  To contact the reporter on this story:
