Euro-area manufacturing output contracted less than initially estimated in May and a  U.K. factory index  surged, underscoring  Mario Draghi ’s view that the European economy is stabilizing.  A gauge of manufacturing in the 17-nation euro area increased to 48.3 last month from 46.7 in April, London-based Markit Economics said today. That’s above an initial estimate of 47.8 on May 23. The gauge has been below 50, indicating contraction, since July 2011. In the U.K., a separate report by Markit and the  Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply  showed a factory index climbed to a 14-month high of 51.3 from a revised 50.2 in April.  European Central Bank President Draghi said in  Shanghai  today that while the economic outlook in the euro area is challenging, he still expects a recovery this year and that “there are a few signs of a possible stabilization.” That assessment was paralleled by Bank of England Governor  Mervyn King , who said in comments broadcast yesterday that there are signs the U.K. economy is recovering, though output is not expanding “as fast as we’d like it to.”  “Both the euro zone and the U.K. look in better shape than a couple of months ago,” said Richard Barwell, senior European economist at  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc  in London. In the euro region “there’s been a huge improvement in confidence and financial markets. That confidence that the world isn’t going to fall apart hopefully should now start to filter through to the average household and company.”  Rate Decisions  The PMI reports precede monetary policy decisions by the ECB and BOE on June 6. Both institutions will keep interest rates on hold at a record low, and the U.K. central bank will refrain from expanding stimulus, according to Bloomberg News surveys of economists.  The European data today followed  euro-zone  industrial confidence and trade data released last month that showed the region is on a path to recovery. An 18-month recession will end in the second quarter, as the economy stagnates before returning to growth in the following three months, according to a Bloomberg News survey of economists.  In  Asia , by contrast, Chinese manufacturing indexes showed small businesses struggling, sapping momentum in the economy and underscoring the need for the government to shift support away from larger, state-backed companies. Declines in manufacturing gauges today in India, South Korea, Vietnam and Taiwan add to risks that Asian and global expansion will slow.  China Index  China’s official  Purchasing Managers ’ Index for smaller companies fell to 47.3 in May from 47.6 the previous month, even as the broader gauge rose to 50.8 from 50.6, the government said June 1. A private manufacturing index today that includes small enterprises fell more than forecast to 49.2, an eight-month low, from 50.4. Levels below 50 signal contraction.  In the U.S., manufacturing probably made little progress in May, indicating the industry will provide scant support for the world’s largest economy, economists said before a report today. The  Institute for Supply Management ’s factory index held at 50.7 during the month, matching the weakest this year, according to the median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of 71 economists.  Improvement in Europe’s PMI data wasn’t limited to the U.K. and euro region. Indexes in  Sweden , Switzerland,  Norway ,  Denmark ,  Poland  and the  Czech Republic  all rose from April.  ECB Policy  ECB officials meeting in  Frankfurt  this week will refrain from cutting the benchmark  interest rate  again after they reduced it to a record low of 0.5 percent last month, according to a Bloomberg News survey of economists. Aside from trimming rates further and charging to hold  bank deposits , policy makers might also consider measures to aid lending to small businesses and rekindle the market for asset-backed securities.  “I see the risk that what’s concentrated on now is shunting the problems down the road and going the Japanese way, into stagnation,” Clemens Fuest, president of the ZEW Center for European Economic Research in Mannheim, said in an interview last week. “The ECB has done its part to solve the crisis. The central bank has used up most of its ammunition.”  In the U.K., the British Chambers of Commerce raised its economic forecasts through 2015 last week, and separate data showed  consumer confidence  increased to a six-month high in May. Nevertheless, some data still point to a fragile recovery. Retail sales fell the most in 16 months in May, while unemployment rose in the first quarter.  The BOE’s Monetary Policy Committee will keep quantitative easing at 375 billion pounds ($572 billion), according to the median of 43 economists in a Bloomberg News poll. The MPC will also keep its key rate at 0.5 percent, another survey showed.  Banco Santander SA (SAN)  and  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS)  led a drop in U.K. lending in the first quarter as overall credit declined, the  Bank of England  said in a report today. Lending by the banks fell a combined 3.9 billion pounds ($6 billion) from the fourth quarter, the BOE said in a statement on usage of its Funding for Lending Scheme.
