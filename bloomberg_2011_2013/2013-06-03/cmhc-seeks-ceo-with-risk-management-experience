Canada’s housing agency said it’s
seeking a president and chief executive officer with risk
management experience to oversee its C$563 billion ($544
billion) mortgage insurance portfolio.  The next CEO should have “knowledge of the financial
management requirements, particularly risk management, of a
large financial services organization,” Canada Mortgage &
Housing Corp. said today in an advertisement in the Globe and
Mail newspaper.  Finance Minister  Jim Flaherty  said last month the Office of
the Superintendent of Financial Institutions will continue to
monitor CMHC “very closely,” because it must operate like the
country’s largest lenders. The government-backed agency, which
had C$563 billion of insurance in force at the end of March,
covers most Canadian mortgages and helps commercial lenders
securitize home loans.  The new appointee should be a “dynamic and visionary”
executive who preferably speaks English and French and has
knowledge of the role of housing and financial markets in
macroeconomic policy and CMHC’s activities, the agency said.  Karen Kinsley said last month she wouldn’t seek another
term as CEO after her term ends June 17.  Robert Kelly , former
 Bank of New York Mellon  Corp. CEO, was named CMHC’s chairman
last week in the government’s latest move to bolster oversight
of the federal agency.  CMHC said separately today that Douglas Stewart, its vice
president of regional operations and assisted housing, will
serve as interim president and CEO.  To contact the reporter on this story:
