Ericsson AB will set up an
information technology and data center in the  Montreal  area with
help from the Quebec government, provincial Premier Pauline
Marois said.  Quebec will provide C$10 million ($9.7 million) in non-reimbursable assistance to the Stockholm-based wireless network
maker, Marois said at a news conference in Montreal. The
project, which is valued at more than C$1.2 billion, will create
about 60 engineering and research jobs, Marois said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
