Gemfields Plc (GEM) , the biggest emerald
producer, was barred from sending Zambian stones to Singapore
for auction on concern the sale would shift revenues overseas.  Selling the gems outside Zambia isn’t permitted, Mines,
Energy and Water Development Minister Yamfwa Mukanga said June 1
by telephone. The government blocked Gemfields from exporting
the emeralds last week, he said.  The southern African nation in April said it wanted all
gemstones to be auctioned in the country and any exports should
first be sold in Zambia. That may curb revenue from Gemfields’
Kagem emerald mine, the world’s largest, as the company has
previously been able to sell the stones in India and Singapore.  The London-based producer had intended to hold an auction
in  Singapore  on June 10 to 14, before the end of its financial
year this month. Director Sean Gilbertson said May 31 that
Gemfields was in talks with the government over the sale.  “We do not believe that there is any law that makes it
illegal to hold an auction offshore,” he said in an interview
in Lusaka, the capital. “We are literally in the process now of
working on that export process and I hope we get that export
sorted out imminently.”  Gemfields agreed in March to hold an April sale in Lusaka.
It held the auction from April 15 to 19, selling $15.2 million
of stones.  To contact the reporter on this story:
