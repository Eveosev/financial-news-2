Spot gasoline in  Los Angeles  weakened
for a second straight day as  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  restored
operations at the Torrance refinery following a  power failure 
last week and a maintenance turnaround.  Exxon’s 150,000-barrel-a-day Torrance plant near Los
Angeles was scheduled to flare gases through June 5 as it
restarted units, Gesuina Paras, a spokeswoman at the refinery,
said by e-mail. The refinery is “working to normalize”
operations after a power failure May 30.  The Torrance complex also began a turnaround on equipment,
including crude, alkylation and coker units, around May 3 that
was expected to last several weeks.  California-blend gasoline, or Carbob, in Los Angeles
dropped 3.25 cents to a premium of 4.25 cents a gallon against
futures traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 3:23 p.m.
New York time, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Prompt delivery
there slipped 0.23 cent to $2.8276 a gallon.  Carbob in  San Francisco  declined 3.25 cents to a premium of
6.25 cents a gallon. Prompt-delivery dropped 0.23 cent to
$2.8476 a gallon.  The  premium  for San Francisco Carbob versus the same fuel
in Los Angeles was unchanged at 2 cents a gallon.  Retail gasoline  in the state, which typically trails the
 spot market , fell 0.5 cent to $3.987 a gallon, Heathrow,
Florida-based AAA, the nation’s largest motoring organization,
said today on its website. Prices at the pump are down 5.8
percent from a year ago.  CARB Diesel  California-blend, or CARB, diesel in San Francisco was
unchanged versus ultra-low-sulfur diesel futures on the Nymex at
a discount of 1.5 cents a gallon. The same fuel in Los Angeles
gained 2 cents to a premium of 3 cents a gallon, the largest
since April 12.  BP Plc (BP/) ’s 266,000-barrel-a-day Carson refinery in Southern
California was scheduled to shut a coker this week for planned
repairs, according to two people familiar with the schedule.  The oil-products tanker Nave Bellatrix, anchored off the
coast of  Panama , was scheduled to load clean products June 9 on
the U.S. West Coast for delivery to Chile, ship-fixture data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  The U.S. West exported 73,000 barrels of distillate  fuel
oil  a day in March, up 22 percent from a year earlier, according
to  data  from the Energy Information Administration, the Energy
Department’s statistical arm.  Portland Gasoline  In  Portland ,  Oregon ,  conventional, 84-octane gasoline 
climbed 0.5 cent to a discount of 0.5 cent a gallon. Low-sulfur
diesel there dropped 3 cents to 8 cents a gallon under ULSD
futures.  Portland gasoline’s discount to Los Angeles Carbob narrowed
3.75 cents to 4.75 cents a gallon versus Los Angeles Carbob,
after the gap stretched to the widest in a month last week.  The  3-2-1 crack spread  of Alaska North Slope crude, Carbob
in Los Angeles and CARB diesel in Los Angeles widened a third
day, gaining 1.4 cents to $18.76 a barrel at 4:24 p.m.  New York 
time. The spread, a rough measure of refining margins, is at the
highest level in more than two weeks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
