The costs of outpatient hospital care
vary widely for typical services such as an MRI, according to
data released by the U.S. government.  In  New York , for example, hospitals charge $474 to $7,332
for a magnetic resonance imaging test of blood vessels,
according to the data released today covering charges and
Medicare payments for 30 common procedures that don’t require
hospital admittance. The government released data in May showing
similar variation in prices for in-patient services.  Medicare, the government’s health-insurance program for the
elderly and disabled, pays a fraction of the costs, called
chargemaster prices, as do most commercial insurers such as
 UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH)  For example, Medicare paid hospitals in
New York no more than $441 on average for an MRI of blood
vessels, regardless of the list price, according to the data.  “A more data driven and transparent health-care
marketplace can help consumers and their families make important
decisions about their care,”  Kathleen Sebelius , the U.S. health
secretary, said in a statement.  The pricing data was released in conjunction with the Obama
administration’s fourth annual “Datapalooza” event, a
conference at which the government encourages technology
companies to make use of its health data.  The cheapest average list price for an MRI in New York was
the $474 at Bronx-Lebanon Hospital Center, while the most
expensive was the $7,332 at Good Samaritan Hospital of Suffern,
according to the data. Medicare paid Good Samaritan in Suffern
about $4 more than Bronx-Lebanon for the procedure.  To contact the reporter on this story:
