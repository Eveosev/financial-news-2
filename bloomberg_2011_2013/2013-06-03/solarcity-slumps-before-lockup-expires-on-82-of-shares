  SolarCity Corp. (SCTY) , the owner of
rooftop solar plants that’s quintupled since its initial public
offering, fell the most in almost two weeks before trading
restrictions are lifted for 82 percent of its shares.  SolarCity slumped 9.9 percent to $40.77 at the close in New
York, the most since May 21. The San Mateo, California-based
company’s shares began trading Dec. 13 at $8.  Almost 61.6 million shares are held under trading
restrictions and can’t be sold until June 10, according to a
SolarCity filing with the Securities & Exchange Commission.
That’s about 82 percent of the total shares outstanding,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Investors will probably sell a portion of the restricted
shares as soon as they are eligible, said Alex Morris, an
analyst at Raymond James & Associates in Houston. Other
stockholders may start selling this week, on concerns that
millions of shares flooding the market next week may drive down
the price.  “The floodgates are about to open,” Morris said in an
interview today. He has the equivalent of a hold rating on the
shares. “The shares have been really frothy on the theory that
anything Elon Musk touches turns to gold, but the gains over the
past few months just aren’t rational.”  Billionaire Musk, 41, is SolarCity’s chairman and largest
shareholder with about 28 percent. He is also chief executive
officer of  Tesla Motors Inc. (TSLA) , the electric car company that’s
more than doubled in value this year. SolarCity CEO  Lyndon Rive ,
Musk’s cousin, holds about 3.5 percent of his company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
