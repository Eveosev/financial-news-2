The rand gained the most in 11 months
as technical indicators signaled the currency’s slump to a four-year low in May was overdone and after the nation’s purchasing
managers’ index topped estimates.  The  exchange rate  slid 11 percent against the dollar last
month, pushing its 14-day relative strength index to as high as
86. The RSI had been above 70, the threshold that signals a
currency is oversold, since May 20 before dropping to 67 today.
The rand, which was the world’s most oversold major currency in
May, appreciated 2.5 percent to 9.8443 per dollar as of 5:56
p.m. in Johannesburg, the most on a closing basis since June 29.  “The rand has been oversold for quite some time, and we’re
certainly hoping for some consolidation,” Mohammed Nalla, head
of strategic research at  Nedbank Group Ltd. (NED) , said by phone from
Johannesburg. South Africa’s currency may extend gains if it
breaches 9.85 per dollar, seen as a significant resistance level
to further gains, he added.  Yields on benchmark 10.5 percent bonds due December 2026
declined 14 basis points, or 0.14 percentage point, to 7.46
percent, stemming five days of increases.  South Africa ’s PMI
dropped to 50.4 percent in May from 50.5 percent in the previous
month, remaining above the 50 level that indicates an expansion.
The median estimate of economists in a Bloomberg survey was
49.9. Automobile sales rose 7.5 percent, beating the 5.8 percent
median estimate of three economists on Bloomberg.  South Africa’s currency pared gains after a shooting at
 Lonmin Plc (LON) ’s Marikana mine, and as Glencore Xstrata Plc  fired 
about 1,000 workers who participated in an unauthorized strike
at three South African chrome mines, Nalla said.  The rand has slumped 14 percent since this year on concern
the labor disruptions will cut output in the  mining industry ,
which accounts for more than 50 percent of the nation’s exports.  To contact the reporter on this story:
