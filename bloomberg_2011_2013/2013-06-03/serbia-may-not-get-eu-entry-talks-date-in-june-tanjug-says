The European Union probably won’t set
a start date for entry talks with  Serbia  on June 28, as
initially planned, Blic newspaper reported, citing Milan
Pajevic, the head of Serbia’s  European Integration Office .  Serbia must first implement an EU-brokered agreement with
its breakaway Kosovo province and the European Commission will
start consultations with the government in July, the Belgrade-based newspaper said. An intergovernmental conference will be
held by early November to formalize the start of the accession
process, then the commission will assess Serbia’s compliance
with EU criteria and open talks, according to the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
