Brent crude  rose, returning prices to
the level prior to OPEC’s May 31 meeting.  Hedge funds  and other
money managers increased bullish bets on Brent last week to the
most in more than three months, a report showed.  Brent advanced as much as 1.9 percent to $102.30 a barrel.
Speculative bets that prices will rise, in futures and options
combined, outnumbered short positions by 161,550 lots in the
week ended May 28, according to data from ICE Futures  Europe .
Chinese manufacturing indexes showed small businesses
struggling, sapping momentum in the economy of the world’s
second-biggest consumer of oil.  “We are back at where we were left at the start of
Friday” before OPEC met, Torbjoern Kjus, a senior oil analyst
at  DNB ASA (DNB)  in Oslo, said by phone. “Chinese numbers were taken
negatively, but there are other arguments, such as refineries
coming back from maintenance, and there’s heavy oil field
maintenance going on.”  Brent for July settlement was at $101.72 a barrel, up $1.33
on the ICE Futures Europe exchange at 1:40 p.m. London time.
Earlier in the same session prices had traded less than $100 for
the first time in a month. Brent slid 2.2 percent last week and
1.9 percent in May.  West Texas Intermediate for July delivery was at $92.67 a
barrel, up 70 cents, in electronic trading on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange , after falling 1.6 percent last month. Brent
was at a premium of $9 to WTI futures, compared with $8.42 on
May 31.  The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries kept its
output ceiling of 30 million barrels a day at a meeting in
Vienna on May 31. OPEC members collectively exceeded that target
by about 1 million barrels a day last month, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  JPMorgan Chase & Co. cut its forecast for Brent to an
average of $113 a barrel in the third quarter, from $120
previously, according to a May 31 report received by e-mail
today. The bank reduced its outlook for the three months ended
December to $117, from $120, and for 2014 to $117.50, from
$122.50. JPMorgan cited demand weakness in Europe and  emerging
markets  and growing non-OPEC supply.  To contact the reporter on this story:
