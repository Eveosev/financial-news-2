President  Dennis Lockhart  said the  Federal Open Market Committee 
may consider slowing the pace of its $85 billion in monthly bond
purchases after this month.  “I think we are approaching a period in which it can be
considered,” Lockhart said in a Fox Business Network interview
broadcast today. “That’s not to say June meeting, but we are
approaching a period in which it can be seriously considered
based upon sort of the momentum of the economy which is not
great but nonetheless is moving forward,” said Lockhart, who
doesn’t vote on policy this year.  San Francisco Fed President  John Williams  said today in
 Stockholm  that policy makers may start reducing the pace of bond
purchases over the next three months and potentially end
quantitative easing by year-end.  With continued “good signs” on jobs and confidence in a
“substantial improvement” I could see as “early as this
summer some adjustment, maybe modest adjustment downward, in our
purchase program,” Williams said. The program “is doing this
great job of helping the economy gain momentum, and I would want
to see that continue well into the second half of this year, but
if things, again if they go well, you could imagine ending the
program by the end of the year.”  The FOMC is scheduled to meet June 18-19.  To contact the reporters on this story:
