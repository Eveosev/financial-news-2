Former professional basketball player
Mookie Blaylock will be charged with vehicular homicide after a
car crash that left an occupant of another vehicle dead, a
 Georgia  prosecutor said.  Blaylock will face five misdemeanor charges: vehicular
homicide in the second degree, driving on a suspended license,
failure to maintain a lane, driving on wrong side of the road,
and crossing a median, Clayton County State Solicitor Tasha
Mosely said in a phone interview today.  Blaylock was critically injured in a May 31 head-on
collision that left a woman dead in Jonesboro, Georgia, 12 miles
south of Atlanta.  He is in the hospital and hasn’t yet been arrested, Mosely
said, adding that officials from nearby Spaulding County have
previous, outstanding warrants for Blaylock and seek to charge
him with driving under the influence and failure to appear in
court. Mosely said her office hasn’t yet learned the name of
Blaylock’s lawyer.  “The investigation is still in its infancy,” Mosely said.
The results of a toxicology report aren’t complete, according to
a statement from police in Jonesboro.  Blaylock, a point guard, played 13 seasons in the NBA,
ending his career with averages of 13.5 points, 4.1 rebounds,
6.7 assists and 2.3 steals per game. He played for the  New
Jersey Nets  from 1989 to 1992 when he joined the  Atlanta Hawks 
until 1999. He was traded to the  Golden State Warriors  in
Oakland, California, where he played for three seasons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
