A gauge of U.S. corporate credit risk
fell before a report showing manufacturing activity in the
world’s largest economy.  The Markit CDX North American Investment Grade Index, a
credit-default swaps benchmark that investors use to hedge
against losses or to speculate on creditworthiness, decreased
0.5 basis points to a mid-price of 78.6 basis points at 8:09
a.m. in New York, according to prices compiled by Bloomberg.  A report at 10 a.m. in New York will probably show that
manufacturing made little progress in May, economists predicted.
The Institute for Supply Management’s factory index held at 50.7
last month, matching its weakest performance this year,
according to the median forecast in a survey of 71 economists.  The credit-swaps index typically falls as investor
confidence improves and rises as it deteriorates. The contracts
pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails to meet its
obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A basis point
equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10 million of
debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
