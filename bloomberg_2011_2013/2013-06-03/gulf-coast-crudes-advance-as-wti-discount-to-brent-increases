Crudes produced on the U.S. Gulf
Coast strengthened against West Texas Intermediate as the
domestic benchmark weakened versus Brent.  WTI’s discount to Brent widened 19 cents to $8.61 a barrel.
When WTI loses ground to Brent, it typically strengthens the
value of U.S. grades that compete with foreign crudes priced
against the international benchmark.  Light Louisiana Sweet gained 40 cents to $8.90 a barrel
over WTI at 2:01 p.m.  New York  time, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium to WTI rose 45
cents to $8.70 a barrel.  Mars Blend gained 35 cents to $4.35 a barrel over WTI,
while Poseidon rose 45 cents to $4.10 over the benchmark. The
premium for  Thunder Horse , which has a lower sulfur content than
Mars and Poseidon, increased by 20 cents to $6.70.  Bakken crude delivered at Clearbrook,  Minnesota , weakened
50 cents a barrel to a $5-a-barrel discount to WTI.  In  Canada , Western Canada Select gained 65 cents to an
$18.60-a-barrel discount to WTI. Syncrude, a light oil produced
from oil-sands upgraders, strengthened by 20 cents to a discount
of 20 cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
