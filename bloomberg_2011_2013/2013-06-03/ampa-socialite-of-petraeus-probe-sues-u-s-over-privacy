Jill Kelley, a Tampa, Florida,
socialite whose e-mails surfaced as part of an investigation
into former CIA Director David Petraeus, sued the federal
government over claims it violated her privacy.  Kelley claims the U.S. Department of Defense and  Federal
Bureau  of Investigation violated her constitutional due process
rights and protections against unreasonable search and seizure,
according to a complaint filed today in federal court in
Washington.  The case is Kelley v. Federal Bureau of Investigation, 13-cv-00825, U.S. District Court,  District of Columbia 
(Washington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
