The  finance ministry  in Baden-Wuerttemberg knows of at least one case of fraud in the German
power market and last year investigated another potential case
in the natural gas market.  “One case has become known in Baden-Wuerttemberg in the
power market which led to a tax loss of about 2.8 million euros
($3.6 million),” Frank Kupferschmidt, a spokesman for the
Federal State’s  finance ministry , said today in an e-mail.  The German Federal Tax Office last month said it found
signs of fraud in  Europe ’s biggest energy market that may be
similar to the value-added-tax scam that roiled carbon permit
markets in 2009 and 2010. The authority warned traders of the
cases and the risks of engaging in illegal trading activities.  “The case of fraud in the power market was revealed after
a company made a report to the national grid regulator last
year,” Kupferschmidt said. “The number of unrevealed cases is
probably very high.”  Also last year, the Baden-Wuerttemberg finance ministry
identified a Swiss-based company that “with a very high
probability” was involved in plans for value-added  tax fraud  in
the gas market, Kupferschmidt said. He declined to give further
details on the case when contacted by telephone.  Under German tax law, the finance ministries in the federal
states are responsible for collecting taxes and investigating
cases of fraud. Last week the Hamburg finance ministry said it
was probing possible fraud in the German power and gas market.  To contact the reporter on this story:
