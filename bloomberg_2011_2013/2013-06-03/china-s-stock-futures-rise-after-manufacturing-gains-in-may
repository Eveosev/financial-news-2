Most  Chinese stocks  fell after
manufacturing indexes signaled small businesses are struggling.
Losses for technology companies and retailers overshadowed gains
for property developers.  Beijing Originwater Technology Co., which has the biggest
weighting on the ChiNext index of small companies, plunged 5.3
percent.  Chongqing Department Store (600729)  Co. declined 3.1 percent,
dragging down a gauge of commercial enterprises including
retailers that trade in  Shanghai .  Gemdale Corp. (600383)  rose for the
first time in three days, leading property stocks higher after
new home prices jumped last month.  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  slipped 0.1 percent to
2,299.25 at the close, as five shares dropped for every four
that advanced. The ChiNext index slid 2 percent. The official
 Purchasing Managers ’ Index for smaller companies fell to 47.3 in
May, even as the broader gauge rose to 50.8. Another PMI index
from HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics that includes small
enterprises fell more than forecast to 49.2, an eight-month low.  “The government’s PMI is geared towards bigger companies
and the HSBC one comprises smaller businesses,” said Mao Sheng,
an analyst for Huaxi Securities Co. in Chengdu. “The fact that
the HSBC PMI is lower also points to the possible weakness of
small-company stocks.”  The Shanghai Composite gained 5.6 percent last month, the
most since December, after interest-rate cuts by central banks
around the world spurred capital inflows and policymakers
accelerated reforms of the economy by allowing private
investment in industries such as telecommunications.  Inflection Point  The CSI 300 Index retreated 0.2 percent to 2,602.62 today,
while the CSI Smallcap 500 Index dropped 0.7 percent and the
Hang Seng  China  Enterprises lost 0.5 percent. The Bloomberg
China-US Equity Index sank 2.6 percent on May 31.  China’s one-year  interest-rate swaps  climbed to the highest
level in more than four months after a report showing a jump in
new  home prices  fueled speculation the central bank will reduce
cash in the financial system.  “We are at or near an inflection point of liquidity growth
that has been supporting the modest run-up in May,” Hao Hong,
the chief China strategist at Bank of Communications Co., said
in an e-mailed note today. “Sectors sensitive to liquidity
conditions, such as the ChiNext, will be vulnerable.”  Beijing Originwater plunged 5.3 percent to 37 yuan, the
biggest decline since January. The ChiNext has gained 47 percent
this year, compared with a 1.3 percent advance for the Shanghai
index and a 3.2 percent gain for the CSI 300.  A gauge of commercial companies in the Shanghai measure
slipped 0.5 percent, the most among five industry groups.
Chongqing Department Store fell 3.1 percent to 22.46  yuan .
Shanghai Friendship Group Inc. slid 1.6 percent to 8.65 yuan.  PMI Data  The Purchasing Managers’ Index climbed from 50.6 in April,
the National Bureau of Statistics and China Federation of
Logistics and Purchasing said on June 1. HSBC gave the final May
reading of its manufacturing index, showing a decline from 50.4
in April. The gauge had a preliminary figure of 49.6 released
May 23. A government gauge of  service industries  today showed
the slowest expansion since September. Levels below 50 signal
contraction.  A gauge of  property stocks  in the Shanghai Composite rose
0.3 percent, the most among the groups. Gemdale increased 1.6
percent to 7.87 yuan. Poly Real Estate Group Co., the second-largest developer, gained 0.9 percent to 12.35 yuan.  The nation’s new home prices jumped in May as government
efforts to tighten property curbs this year failed to deter
buyers. Prices surged 6.9 percent from a year earlier to 10,180
yuan ($1,660) per square meter (10.76 square feet), Soufun
Holdings Ltd., the country’s biggest real estate website owner,
said in a statement today after a survey of 100 cities.  Property Concerns  “Rising property prices are definitely a concern,” said
 Frances Cheung , a strategist at Credit Agricole CIB in  Hong
Kong . “People in the market think the central bank may have to
drain liquidity to control prices.”  Trading volumes in Shanghai index were 3.2 percent below
the 30-day average today, while 30-day  volatility  was at 16.2,
compared with this year’s average of 19.3, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. The benchmark index trades at 9.4 times 12-month
estimated earnings, compared with a seven-year average of 15.5
times, according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg.  The  iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund (FXI) , the largest Chinese
 exchange-traded fund  in the U.S., slid 2 percent on May 31,
taking its May slump to 4.6 percent.  PetroChina Co. (PTR)  lost 9.5
percent in its fifth monthly decline, while  China Eastern
Airlines Corp. (CEA)  tumbled 18 percent for the steepest slump since
2011. Huaneng Power International Inc., China’s largest
electricity producer, lost the most in 14 months in May.  -- With assistance from Belinda Cao in  New York . Editors: Allen
