Canadian  stocks  dropped for a second
day after U.S. manufacturing unexpectedly contracted in May and
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. advised selling shares of  Canadian
Natural Resources (CNQ)  Ltd.  China Gold International Resources Corp. and Dream
Unlimited Corp. led losses in the  Standard & Poor’s/TSX
Composite Index. (SPTSX)  Canadian Natural Resources slumped for a third
day, losing 2.7 percent. Copper Mountain Mining Corp. gained 6.7
percent as the price of the metal increased the most in almost
four weeks. Centerra Gold Inc. and Premier Gold Mines Ltd.
advanced at least 4.2 percent as gold rose.  The S&P/TSX fell 73.80 points, or 0.6 percent, to 12,576.62
at 2:59 p.m. in Toronto. The index has climbed 1.1 percent this
year. Trading volume was 8.1 percent lower than the 30-day
average at this time of the day.  “After the very good first couple of quarters in the U.S.
and  Canada , people are taking a bit of a pause before seeing
where to go from here,” said Brian Huen, managing partner with
Red Sky Capital Management Ltd. in Toronto. He helps manage
C$220 million ($213 million). “There’s still lots of chatter
around the Fed and whether stimulus gets taken out of the market
sooner rather than later. Gold is rallying a little bit here as
people are looking for protection against the risk-off trade.”  Data today fueled concern that growth in the U.S., the
world’s largest economy and Canada’s biggest trading partner,
could slow, as a report from the  Institute for Supply Management 
showed manufacturing unexpectedly contracted in May at the
fastest pace in four years.  Fed Stimulus  U.S. equities reversed earlier losses after a Federal
Reserve official said the central bank remains committed to
unprecedented levels of stimulus that have helped fuel a five-year market rally.  Eight out of 10 industries in the S&P/TSX retreated, led by
health-care and energy stocks.  Canadian Natural Resources sank 2.7 percent to C$30.08

stock’s rating to sell from neutral. The company has 19 buys,
five holds and two sell ratings, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Materials stocks fell 0.5 percent, even as the price of

$1,411.90 an ounce in  New York . China Gold International dropped
8.1 percent to C$3.12. Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc. plunged
2.6 percent to C$1.16.  A separate index of gold producers rallied 0.3 percent, on
its way to a seven-week high. Centerra Gold jumped 8.1 percent
to C$4.13 and Premier Gold Mines rallied 5 percent to C$2.31.  Copper Mountain (CUM)  surged 6.7 percent to C$1.68. Copper
