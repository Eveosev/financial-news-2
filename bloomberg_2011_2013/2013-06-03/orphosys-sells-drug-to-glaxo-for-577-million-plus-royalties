MorphoSys AG (MOR)  said it sold rights to
its experimental MOR103 treatment to  GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK)  for as
much as 445 million euros ($577 million) as well as royalties on
potential sales. The company raised its revenue forecast.  Shares of the Martinsried, Germany-based company  jumped  as
much as 6.6 percent after the announcement, and traded 1.3
percent higher at 37.80 euros as of 3:43 p.m. in  Frankfurt 
today. The stock has  gained  almost 29 percent this year.  The deal comes with an upfront payment of 22.5 million
euros, prompting the company to forecast full-year revenue of 68
million euros to 72 million euros, compared with a previous
outlook for 48 million euros to 52 million euros. MorphoSys will
also receive success-based payments of as much as 423 million
euros, and a double-digit cut of future sales. MOR103 is
currently in mid-stage clinical trials in rheumatoid arthritis
and in early stage trials in multiple sclerosis.  “This transaction is a major milestone for MorphoSys,”
Chief Executive Officer Simon Moroney said in the statement.“We
hope this alliance will result in a significant return on
investment for the MOR103 program and to become a major value
driver for MorphoSys.”  MorphoSys gave a new forecast for earnings before interest
and tax with a range from a loss of 2 million euros to earnings
of 2 million euros at that level.  This is the first proprietary drug for MorphoSys, which
develops biological drugs for partners such as  Roche Holding AG (ROG) 
and  Novartis AG. (NOVN)   To contact the reporter on this story:
