The  International Monetary Fund 
lowered its 2013 economic growth forecast for  Germany  to about
0.3 percent, saying uncertainty and recession in the rest of the
euro area are holding German companies back from investing.  Risks to  Europe ’s biggest economy are “tilted to the
downside” as global growth slows and financial stress in Europe
risks feeding through to Germany, the Washington-based IMF said
in a report published today. The IMF forecast 0.6 percent growth
for Germany in its global outlook on April 16.  While renewing calls for structural reforms such as
boosting the productivity of services, the report lauded the
German economy as “an anchor of stability” in Europe and
“marginal” fiscal easing this year by  Chancellor Angela Merkel ’s government as “appropriate.”  Merkel is running for a third term in Sept. 22 elections on
an economic record that includes the nation’s  lowest
unemployment  in two decades and her handling of the euro-area
debt crisis, which led to international bailouts in for Greece,
Ireland,  Portugal ,  Spain  and Cyprus and austerity policies
across much of southern Europe.  Germany should avoid excessive fiscal tightening and can
help forge “the longer-term shared vision for close economic
and financial integration” of the euro area, which provide “a
crucial anchor to the expectations of households, firms and the
financial system,” according to the report, which is part of
the fund’s regular reviews of member countries’ economies.  Vulnerabilities remains in the German banking system’s
exposure to areas such as shipping, international commercial
real estate and some foreign-asset holdings, the IMF said.
Boosting the capital buffers, profitability and efficiency of
German banks and adjusting business models to impending
regulatory changes “would help consolidate financial
strength,” the IMF said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
