Treasuries rose, pushing 10-year
yields down from almost a 14-month high, as an unexpected drop
in U.S. manufacturing in May damped bets the  Federal Reserve 
will slow bond purchases under its quantitative-easing stimulus.  Bonds fell earlier after Fed Bank of San Francisco
President  John Williams  said the central bank’s asset buying may
end this year. Ten-year yields climbed last month by the most
since December 2010 on bets the Fed would scale the program
back. The  Institute for Supply Management ’s factory index showed
manufacturing shrank at the fastest rate since June 2009.  “This is a sign of contraction instead of expansion,”
 Michael Franzese , senior vice president of fixed-income trading
at ED&F Man Capital Markets in  New York , said in a telephone
interview. “We just broke out.”  Benchmark 10-year note  yields  dropped four basis points, or
0.04 percentage point, to 2.09 percent at 12:05 p.m. New York
time, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader data. The yields
climbed on May 29 to 2.23 percent, the highest since April 2012.
The price of the 1.75 percent security due in May 2023 gained
3/8, or $3.75 per $1,000 face amount, to 97.  The yield on  30-year bonds  decreased three basis points to
3.25 percent.  The ISM’s factory index fell to a reading of 49, from the
prior month’s 50.7, the Tempe, Arizona-based group’s report
showed today. Fifty is the dividing line between growth and
contraction. The median forecast of 81 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg was for an advance to 51.  Surprise Number  “Guys got caught by surprise on the manufacturing
number,” said  Thomas Tucci , managing director and head of
Treasury trading in New York at CIBC World Markets Corp.
“There’s a better bid in the market.”  Yields rose earlier after the Fed’s Williams, who doesn’t
vote on monetary policy this year, told reporters in  Stockholm 
the U.S. central bank may start reducing its bond buying by the
summer and potentially conclude it by year-end. Williams was one
of the first Fed officials to advocate that the Fed buy bonds
without setting a limit on the duration or total for such
purchases.  “Williams’s comments created a stir because he was seen by
some as a dove,” said  David Keeble , head of fixed-income
strategy at Credit Agricole Corporate & Investment Bank in New
York.  The Fed is buying $85 billion of Treasury and mortgage debt
a month to support the economy by putting downward pressure on
 interest rates . The central bank today purchased $1.46 billion
of Treasuries maturing between February 2036 and February 2043.  Timing Debate  Ten-year yields climbed in May by 46 basis points, the most
since December 2010, amid debate on the Fed’s timing in
curtailing the monetary stimulus amid stronger-than-forecast
economic data.  A Labor Department report on May 3 showed the  unemployment 
rate unexpectedly fell in April to a four-year low of 7.5
percent and  U.S. employers added 165,000 jobs, more than
projected. Nonfarm payrolls increased by 167,000 jobs in May,
economists forecast before a June 7 Labor Department report.  May’s bond rout has still left global yields short of the
tipping point that would signal a  bear market .  Yields on U.S. Treasuries, German bunds and Japanese
 government bonds  are about one standard deviation above their
historical norm. Treasury 10-year rates have reached two
standard deviations above the average twice since 2009, and each
time the notes rallied.  While sovereign yields at 1.39 percent are above the record
low of 1.14 percent set May 2, they are about half the 3.64
percent average of the past 20 years, based on Bank of America
Merrill Lynch’s Global Government Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
