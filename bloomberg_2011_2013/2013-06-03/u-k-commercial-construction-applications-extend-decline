U.K. building-permit applications for
commercial-property developments fell for a second year in 2012,
bringing the decline since 2008 to 23 percent, legal firm EMW
Law LLP said.  The number of applications dropped 3.5 percent to 38,600,
London-based EMW said in a statement today. The permits sought
for retail, warehouse or office-building projects with floor
space of at least 1,000 square meters (10,800 square feet)
dropped 9 percent to 2,100 last year, according to the firm.  The U.K. government has been trying to stimulate
construction and property development to help spur economic
growth. Credit availability for commercial real estate, however,
was little changed in the first quarter and was predicted to
remain that way through June, according to a survey published by
the  Bank of England  in April.  There have been more tower cranes for building construction
erected in  London  in the last three years than in the rest of
the U.K. combined, EMW said, citing data from the Health &
Safety Executive.  The value of income-producing properties in areas outside
of London fell 7.2 percent from September 2011 through March,
while rising 7.4 percent in the cityâ€™s center, according to
Investment Property Databank Ltd.  To contact the reporter on this story:
