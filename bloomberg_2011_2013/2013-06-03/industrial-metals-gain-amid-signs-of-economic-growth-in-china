Copper advanced amid signs of
stabilizing growth in  China , the world’s biggest user, while
nickel gained to the highest level in six weeks after a report
said that China’s State Reserve Bureau bought the metal.  Copper for delivery in three months rose as much as 1.2
percent to $7,397.75 a ton on the London Metal Exchange and was
at $7,383 at 5:12 p.m. in Seoul. Prices advanced in May for the
first month in four, gaining 3.6 percent. Futures for delivery
in July rose 1.6 percent to $3.345 a pound on the Comex.  An official manufacturing index for China released on June
1 showed a pickup in growth a day after President Xi Jinping
said that the expansion is on a more stable footing. China’s
State Reserve Bureau bought about 30,000 tons of nickel,
equivalent to one sixth of stocks in LME warehouses, the
Financial Times said today, citing people familiar with the deal.
The purchase happened several months ago, the report said.  “We had a good official manufacturing number and the FT
report is also helping,” said Hwang Il Doo, a senior metals
trader at Seoul-based Korea Exchange Bank Futures Co., using the
paper’s initials “China’s demand for metals will continue.”  Three-month nickel gained as much as 5.2 percent to $15,600
a ton, the most expensive since April 17, and at $15,210. Prices
dropped for a second month in May and have declined 11 percent
in 2013.  Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. (FCX) ’s production in
 Indonesia  will be shut for a government probe into accidents at
its Grasberg mine that may take as long as three months,
boosting concern over global supply. A tunnel collapsed on May
14, killing 28 workers.  Stockpiles of copper monitored by the LME fell to 608,450
tons on May 31, marking the first  monthly decline  since
September. The holdings have still increased 90 percent this
year, touching the highest level in a decade.  Copper for September delivery rose 0.6 percent to close at
53,010  yuan  ($8,645) a ton on the Shanghai Futures Exchange. On
the LME, aluminum, lead, zinc and tin also gained.  To contact the reporter on this story:
