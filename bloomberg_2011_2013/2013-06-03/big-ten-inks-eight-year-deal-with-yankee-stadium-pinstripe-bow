The  Big Ten  and the Pinstripe Bowl,
held annually at Yankee Stadium, signed an eight-year agreement
that marks the expanding conference’s first college football
playoff tie-in on the East Coast.  The Big Ten will send a team to the game for eight years
starting in 2014, the conference said today in an e-mailed
release. Since the first Pinstripe Bowl in 2010, the game has
featured a team from the Big East versus a team from the Big 12.  “Once we saw the success of the new era Pinstripe Bowl, it
became obvious -- especially with the Big Ten’s growing East
Coast footprint -- that being in the media capital of the world
at one of sports’ most renowned venues was a natural pairing,”
Big Ten Commissioner James Delany said in the release.  The Big Ten is adding the University of  Maryland  and
Rutgers University, both East Coast schools, starting with the
2014-15 academic year. The announcement comes the same day that
the Park Ridge, Illinois-based conference announced it will add
lacrosse, long considered an East Coast pastime, to its list of
official sports.  As part of the agreement, the Big Ten will have a
“significant branding presence” in the stadium at all Yankees
home games starting in 2014, the release said. That includes a
fixed sign along the first-base line and a rotating sign behind
home plate.  The 2013 Pinstripe Bowl, the final game before today’s
announcement takes effect, will be held Dec. 28 in the Bronx,
New York, stadium.  To contact the reporters on this story:
