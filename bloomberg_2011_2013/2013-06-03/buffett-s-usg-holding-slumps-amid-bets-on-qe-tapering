USG Corp. (USG) , the building supplier
whose largest investor is  Warren Buffett ’s Berkshire Hathaway
Inc., slumped amid concern that construction would slow if the
Federal Reserve begins to curb bond purchases designed to
stimulate the economy.  The drop at USG to the lowest price in a month joined
declines at  Vulcan Materials Co. (VMC) , a sand and gravel producer,
and  Martin Marietta Materials Inc. (MLM)  The SPDR S&P Homebuilders
exchange-traded fund slipped to the lowest level since May 2.  The Fed may slow its $85 billion in monthly bond purchases,
known as quantitative easing, this summer, Federal Reserve Bank
of San Francisco President John Williams said today in
Stockholm. Speculation that the Fed would begin phasing out the
program helped push global bond markets to their biggest loss
since 2004 in May.  “Rising interest rates will annihilate the real estate
industry,” Jeffrey Sica, who helps oversee $1 billion as
president of Sica Wealth Management LLC in Morristown, New
Jersey, said by telephone. “If developers know they can’t get
buyers, they’re going to hold off on purchasing building
material.”  USG dropped 4 percent to $26.23, the lowest closing price
for the Chicago-based company since May 2. Birmingham, Alabama-based Vulcan Materials fell 0.7 percent to $53.21 and Raleigh,
North Carolina-based Martin Marietta declined 0.3 percent to
$108.69.  To contact the reporter on this story:
