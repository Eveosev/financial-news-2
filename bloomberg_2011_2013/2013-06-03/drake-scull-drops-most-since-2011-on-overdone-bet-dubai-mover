Drake & Scull International PJSC (DSI)  fell
the most in more than two years on investor bets gains of 40
percent this quarter are overdone.  Drake & Scull, which supplies engineering services to the
 construction industry , declined 6.4 percent, the steepest slump
since February 2011, to 1.02 dirhams at the close in Dubai. The
stock was the biggest decliner by index points on Dubai’s
benchmark  DFM General Index (DFMGI) , which lost 0.3 percent. About 115
million Drake & Scull shares traded, or 3.2 times the three-month daily average.  The quarter’s rally pushed the shares’ estimated price-to-earnings ratio to 16.5 yesterday. The ratio declined to 15.5
times today, compared with multiples of 13.6 and 10.7 for
Dubai’s benchmark and the MSCI Emerging Markets Index. Drake &
Scull said on May 21 it won a 1.73 billion-riyal ($461 million)
contract in  Saudi Arabia . In April the company said it won
projects worth 1.1 billion dirhams ($299 million) in Saudi
Arabia, Qatar and  Abu Dhabi  in the first-quarter.  “Shares have gained much over the last month and now there
is profit taking after all the positive news regarding winning
contracts,” said Montasser Khelifi, a Dubai-based senior
manager for global markets at Quantum Investment Bank Ltd.  The stock’s 14-day  relative strength index  rose to 76.3
yesterday, signaling to some investors that the security was
poised to decline. The measure fell to 58.8 today. Three
analysts recommend investors buy the stock, six  say hold  and
three sell, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Dubai’s benchmark index has gained 32 percent this quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
