Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN)  workers in  Germany 
consider extending their strikes to span several days after the
company’s local management refused to negotiate over collective
bargaining agreements and higher pay.  “We’re considering moving from single-day strikes to
walkouts lasting multiple days,” Joerg Lauenroth-Mago, lead
negotiator for the Ver.di union, said by phone today.  The union today called employees at the Bad Hersfeld and
Leipzig sites to go on strike for the third time since May 14,
increasing pressure on the Seattle-based retailer, which drew
scrutiny in Germany this year after a documentary aired on ARD
television accusing it of exploiting migrant workers. About half
of Amazon’s 5,300 staff in the two cities are participating in
today’s walkouts, Lauenroth-Mago said.  Ver.di’s demands include raising minimum pay to 10.66 euros
($13.88) an hour from 9.30 euros in Leipzig and to 12.18 euros
from 9.83 euros in Bad Hersfeld, and to pay extra for night
shifts starting before midnight. A Munich-based Amazon
spokeswoman declined to immediately comment and a written
request to the press office wasn’t immediately answered.  To contact the reporter on this story:
