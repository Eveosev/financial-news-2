U.S. Representative Carolyn McCarthy
of New York announced she has “a treatable form” of  lung
cancer .  “A treatment plan will begin soon and I look forward to
its successful completion,” the nine-term Democrat said in a
statement today that asked for privacy “while I undergo my
treatment.”  McCarthy, 69, said she will be treated at  Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center  in New York and will be absent from the
 House of Representatives  during that time.  “I am a fighter, as many people know, and I am committed
to beating this latest challenge in my life,” she said.  A nurse before her election to the House in 1996, McCarthy
has been one of Congress’s staunchest supporters of gun control
legislation. Her husband was killed and her son was wounded in a
mass shooting on the Long Island Rail Road in 1993.  To contact the reporter on this story:
