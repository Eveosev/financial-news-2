Bank of America Corp.  sold $131.7
million of 14-month notes tied to the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index, the largest such offering in almost two years.  The securities, issued May 30, yield three times the gains
of the benchmark up to 11.85 percent with all capital at risk,
according to a  prospectus  filed with the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission. The bank, which valued the notes at 97
cents on the dollar, charged 2 percent in distribution fees.  The offering is the largest tied to the benchmark since
Sept. 29, 2011, when the  Charlotte , North Carolina-based bank
sold $151.2 million of two-year notes. Those securities yield at
least 30.15 percent as long as the index doesn’t fall more than
10 percent with 90 percent of capital at risk, according to a
 filing  with the SEC.  Banks have sold $3.13 billion of notes tied to the stock
benchmark this year, making it the most popular underlying
asset, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Bank of America
leads with $1 billion of issuance linked to the  S&P 500 .  The index  rose  15 percent this year to 1,640.42 as of the
close of trading today.  Matt Card, a spokesman for Bank of America, didn’t return
an e-mail seeking comment on the security or the index.  Banks create structured notes by packaging debt with
derivatives to offer customized bets to retail investors while
earning fees and raising money. Derivatives are contracts whose
value is derived from stocks, bonds, commodities and currencies,
or events such as changes in  interest rates  or the weather.  To contact the reporter on this story:
