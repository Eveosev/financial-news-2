Caisse de Depot et Placement du
 Quebec ’s Ivanhoe Cambridge real estate unit bought the 47-story
Wells Fargo Center in  Seattle  for $390 million as the company
increases its holdings of top-tier office buildings in the city.  The tower has 983,600 square feet (91,400 square meters) of
leasable space, Montreal-based Ivanhoe Cambridge said in a
statement today. Wells Fargo Center, located at 999 Third Ave.,
is one of downtown Seattle’s tallest buildings. The seller was
Boston-based Beacon  Capital Partners , said Michele Meier, an
Ivanhoe Cambridge spokeswoman.  The acquisition of the skyscraper, which has views of
Elliott Bay and the city, brings the Canadian investor’s share
of Class A space in Seattle’s financial district to almost 8
percent, Ivanhoe Cambridge said. It has a 50 percent stake in
the 943,600-square-foot U.S. Bank Centre, also in the district.  “Wells Fargo Center provides the opportunity to create
significant value, while enabling us to grow our presence in the
financial district of a city that serves as a major continental
gateway,” Adam Adamakakis, executive vice president for
investments at Ivanhoe Cambridge, said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
