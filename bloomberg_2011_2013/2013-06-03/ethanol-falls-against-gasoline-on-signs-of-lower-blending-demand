Ethanol weakened against gasoline
after the spread between the two futures contracts shrank to the
narrowest level since 2011 last week, reducing the biofuel’s
appeal to refiners.  The spread, or price difference, expanded 3.52 cents to
22.21 cents a gallon. Ethanol’s discount to gasoline on May 31
touched the least since December 2011. Ethanol is used to
stretch gasoline supplies and meet federal mandates.  “It’s just time for a little bit of a breather,” said Jim Damask, a manager at StarFuels Inc., in Jupiter,  Florida . “For
a while it’s been going straight up. If you’re an ethanol
producer, you want that spread to be wide, so they want to blend
a lot.”  Denatured ethanol for July delivery fell 0.5 cent $2.563 a
gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade. The June contract, which
expires June 5, slipped 3.4 cents to $2.71. Prices have gained
37 percent in the past year.  Gasoline for July delivery advanced 3.02 cents, or 1.1
percent, to $2.7851 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The contract covers reformulated gasoline, made to be
blended with ethanol before delivery to filling stations.  A 2007 energy law requires the U.S. to use 13.8 billion
gallons of ethanol this year and 14.4 billion in 2014.
Compliance with the law is tracked by certificates attached to
each gallon of biofuel, known as Renewable Identification
Numbers, or RINs.  RINs  The RINs can be traded among refiners once they’ve blended
ethanol with petroleum or they can keep them to submit to the
government. Damask said if the price of ethanol becomes too
costly and not economical to refiners, they may choose buy RINs
instead of satisfying the blending requirements.  Corn-based ethanol RINs for 2013  rose 4 cents to 95 cents
at 3:52 p.m.  New York  time. Advanced RINs, which cover biodiesel
and Brazilian sugarcane-based ethanol, jumped 2 cents to $1.06,
the highest level since March 11.  Corn for July delivery slumped 6.25 cents to $6.5575 a
bushel in Chicago. The corn crush spread, or the cost difference
between a gallon of ethanol and the corn needed to make it, was
18 cents, up from 16 cents May 31, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Ethanol-blended gasoline made up about 96 percent of the
total U.S. gasoline pool in the week ended May 24, the Energy
Information Administration said in a May 30 report.  Stockpiles of the fuel that week sank 0.8 percent to 16
million barrels, the lowest since October 2010, the Energy
Department’s analytical arm said.  Production of the biofuel declined 1.4 percent to 863,000
barrels a day, down 4.3 percent from a year earlier, EIA said.  Spot Prices  In cash market trading, ethanol in  Chicago  decreased 6
cents to $2.70 a gallon, data compiled by Bloomberg show. In the
U.S. Gulf, prices sank 4.5 cents to $2.765. On the West Coast,
they decreased 3.5 cents to $2.825. In New York Harbor, the
additive gained 2 cents to $2.81 a gallon.  West Coast ethanol’s premium to the U.S. Gulf widened 1
cent to 6 cents, while Chicago’s discount to New York Harbor
expanded 8 cents to 11 cents, the widest level since May 22.  The U.S.  imported  27,000 barrels a day of ethanol in the
week ended May 24, EIA said, the first time it has made foreign
purchases of the biofuel since April 19.  To contact the reporter on this story:
