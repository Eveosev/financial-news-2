Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , the world’s
biggest carmaker, reported a monthly sales increase in  China  for
the first time since January as the carmaker ramped up
production in the country.  Deliveries in the world’s biggest vehicle market climbed
0.4 percent to 79,000 units last month, from 78,700 a year
earlier, the Toyota City, Japan-based carmaker said in a
statement today. For the January-to-May period, sales were 8.6
percent short of last year’s level.  The gain in May deliveries follows Japanese carmakers’
production increase in China a month earlier, signaling a
consumer backlash is fading following a territorial dispute
between Asia’s two largest economies in 2012. Toyota last year
reported its first sales decline since at least 2002 and pushed
back a plan to make the country its third million-unit market.  Toyota’s output in China rose 8.7 percent to 72,955 units
in April. Production at  Nissan Motor Co. (7201) , the largest Japanese
carmaker in the market by volume, gained 7.1 percent, and  Honda
Motor Co. (7267)  posted a 5.9 percent increase, according to figures
from the companies last month.  Toyota doesn’t expect sales in the country to fully recover
before autumn this year, Hiroji Onishi, its China chief, said in
April. The maker of the Corolla and Camry sedans is targeting
deliveries of 900,000 in the market this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
