Rising global production of wheat,
soybeans and corn will decrease the U.S. share of world
agriculture trade and may reduce the value of  farmland ,
according to a study by  Ohio State University .  “A declining competitive advantage for U.S. crops will
ultimately reduce the relative advantage of U.S. farmland and
thus the price it can command,” Carl Zulauf and Nick Rettig,
economists at Ohio State, said in a  report  May 31. Revenue per
acre may drop amid falling prices and because of “relative
yield declines. In short, the U.S. crop sector may be as
vulnerable as it was in the late 1970s.”  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Agriculture Index of eight
commodities has jumped 57 percent since the end of 2006 as
global droughts and extreme weather hampered crops. U.S.
farmland values rose to a record in 2012, the government said in
August. Rising crop prices spurred global farmers to increase
production, and the expansion in world acreage and yields from
2007 to 2011 exceeded gains in the U.S., the Ohio State
economists said.  “The yield advantage of U.S. crops has been in a long-term
decline,” which is also magnified by rising global acreage,
Zulauf and Rettig said. “This advantage has declined
substantially since the late 1960s and has disappeared for
wheat. In addition, average soybean yield over 2007-2011 was
slightly higher in Brazil than the U.S.”  U.S. wheat yields fell 3 percent below the rest of the
world from 2007 to 2011, the report showed. That compares with a
44 percent advantage from 1968 to 1972. U.S. soybean yields were
about 24 percent higher from 2007 to 2011, down from 86 percent.
Corn yields averaged 2.43 times higher, down from 3.04 times.  From 2007 to 2011, U.S. farmers produced 8.9 percent of the
global wheat crop, 35 percent of soybeans and 38 percent of
corn. That’s down from 13 percent, 72 percent and 44 percent
respectively from 1968 to 1972.  To contact the reporters on this story:
