Mauro Santambrogio, who won a
mountainous stage of this year’s Giro d’Italia cycling race, is
provisionally suspended for testing positive for doping, the
sport’s ruling body said today.  A urine sample provided by the Italian on May 4 tested
positive for blood-boosting erythropoietin, or EPO, the  Union
Cycliste Internationale  said today in a statement on its
website. Santambrogio can appeal and attend testing of his
second sample.  The Vini Fantini rider finished ninth in the Giro,
cycling’s biggest stage race after the  Tour de France , and won
the 14th stage on May 18. Vincenzo Nibali won the race.  Danilo Di Luca, who won the Giro in 2007, was suspended
last month for testing positive for EPO.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
