Laos and its colonial gem of a city, Luang Prabang, is well worth a visit if you're heading to Southeast Asia. Here's how to do it: Where to Stay The Splurge:  The elegant, hushed  Amantaka  is built on the grounds of a colonial-era hospital and has a terrific pool, though the afternoon tea alone—with fresh cookies, fruit chips, cakes, and bael-fruit iced tea—is worth the stay (856-71-860-333; doubles from $800). The Steal:  Sweet little  3 Nagas , right off the main drag, has large, rustic rooms. The staff are laid-back and friendly, and the neighborhood roosters will wake you nice and early. It's the perfect upscale guesthouse for people who want to relive their backpacker days but with some additional comfort (856-71-253-888; doubles from $220). What to Do Go to the Night Market:  Yes, yes, everyone does it, but that doesn't mean it's not terrific. Every night, the main drag shuts down to vehicular traffic so the mostly Hmong women can sell their crafts. There's some real ingenuity on display here, and although you should avoid anyone claiming they sell antiques, it's a great place to buy souvenirs: cloth bags, bangles, and dolls. And don't forget to pick up some fresh spring rolls,  an avocado sandwich, or a lime-and-mint fruit drink from the street vendors—all perfectly safe, all  irresistible. Explore the Town:  It sounds obvious, but it should still be said: LP, with its boutique- and café-lined main street, Sakkaline Road, and little arteries leading down to the river and tiny guesthouses, is one of the most charming towns in Southeast Asia, and one where you can happily spend a few days doing nothing. Or you could… Hike to a Waterfall:  The more ambitious among you can take the 45-minute drive to Kuang Si Falls, where an easy (though muddy) hike leads you to a tumbling waterfall spilling into an eerily blue lake. The walk back down is once again easy—but also justifies a refreshing watermelon juice back in town. Where to Eat Our Top Three:  Everyone who's anyone in Luang Prabang  (whatever that means!) heads to  L'Eléphant , where you can choose from a French or Lao menu (Ban Vat Nong; 856-71-252-482; entrées from $10). Its sister restaurant next door, the chic Green Elephant,  is Laos's first vegan eatery (no phone; set menu, $21). And even if you're not staying at the hotel itself, the  3 Nagas café —with extra-fresh Lao court cuisine—is worth  a visit. The shady patio makes for  a great lunchtime spot (856-71-253-888; entrées from $5). More from  Condé Nast Traveler :
