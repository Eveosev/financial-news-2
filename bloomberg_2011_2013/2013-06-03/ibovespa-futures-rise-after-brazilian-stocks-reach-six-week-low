The  Ibovespa (IBOV)  rebounded from a six-week low as mining company Vale SA led Brazilian raw-material
producers higher amid a rally in commodities, outweighing
declines in bank stocks.  MMX Mineracao & Metalicos SA, the iron-ore producer
controlled by billionaire  Eike Batista , rose from a record low.
The MSCI  Brazil /Materials Index was the best performer among 10
industry groups. Banco Bradesco SA sank after economists lowered
their 2013 economic growth forecasts for a third week.  The Ibovespa gained 0.3 percent to 53,656.39 at 4:03 p.m.
in Sao Paulo. Thirty-four stocks rose while an equal number
fell. The real climbed 0.6 percent to 2.1283 per dollar. The
Standard & Poor’s GSCI  index  of 24 raw materials rose 1.2
percent. Brazil’s benchmark equity gauge sank 2.1 percent on May
31 after policy makers increased their target lending rate more
than most analysts had forecast to curb inflation.  “The market reaction on Friday to the increase in  interest
rates  was exaggerated,” Marcio Cardoso, a partner at brokerage
Titulo Corretora de Valores SA, said by phone. “The signal the
central bank sent was good. We should see a rebound today. It
was a good buying opportunity.”  Vale jumped 3.2 percent to 29.56 reais. MMX rose 2.4
percent to 1.72 reais.  Bradesco slid 3.2 percent to 33.25 reais. The MSCI
Brazil/Financials Index fell 1.5 percent, set for the lowest
closing level since Dec. 18.  Growth Forecast  Gross domestic product will expand 2.77 percent this year,
down from the previous week’s forecast of 2.93 percent,
according to a May 31 central bank survey of about 100
economists published today. Analysts also cut their 2014 growth
outlook to 3.4 percent from 3.5 percent.  “The short term for the Brazilian economy is bad and that
reflects on stocks,” Felipe Rocha, an analyst at brokerage Omar
Camargo, said in a telephone interview from Curitiba, Brazil.
“The market is redoing the math on growth forecasts. For banks,
it brings the prospect of less demand for credit and an overall
slower market.”  Banco Itau BBA joined analysts from Bradesco BBI to
JPMorgan Chase & Co and cut its 2013 growth forecast for Brazil
after first-quarter expansion trailed estimates. Itau predicts
 Latin America ’s largest economy will grow 2.4 percent this year,
according to a research report today, down from a previous
estimate of 2.8 percent.  Gol Sinks  Airline Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes SA, which got 93
percent of its revenue from Brazil in 2012, slumped 4.2 percent
to 8.92 reais. A close at that level would be the lowest since
July 26.  Brazil’s benchmark equity gauge fell 4.3 percent in May,
the steepest monthly drop in a year and its  fifth  straight month
of declines. The index has fallen 12 percent in 2013,
underperforming  emerging markets  including China, Russia and
 India , amid concern quickening inflation will curb the nation’s
economic recovery.  The Ibovespa trades at 12.7 times analyst earnings
estimates for the next four quarters, compared with a multiple
of 10.6 for the MSCI Emerging Markets Index of 21 developing
nations’ equities, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Trading volume for stocks in  Sao Paulo  was 12.6 billion
reais on  May 31 . That compares with a daily average of 7.67
billion reais this year through May 29, according to data
compiled by the exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
