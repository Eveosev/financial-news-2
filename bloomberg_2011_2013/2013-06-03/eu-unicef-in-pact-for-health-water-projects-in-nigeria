The European Union and United Nations
Children’s Fund agreed to contribute 44.75 million euros ($59
million) for water and health projects in Nigeria.  The EU and Unicef, as the UN agency is known, will provide
30 million euros over four years to help improve maternal and
child health in the northern Adamawa and Kebbi states, the EU
delegation to Nigeria said today in a statement from Abuja, the
capital. Plateau, Ekiti and Adamawa states will also get 14.75
million euros for water supply and sanitation projects.  More than 2,000 children under age 5 and 75 pregnant women
die daily in Nigeria from preventable diseases including malaria
and diarrhea, according to Unicef’s 2011 Multiple Indicator
Cluster Survey. Africa’s most-populous country contributes about
10 percent of the world’s maternal deaths. Some 118 million
people in the nation of 160 million lack access to improved
sanitation while 70 million don’t have access to safe water,
according to the report.  At least 1.5 million children and 380,000 pregnant women
will benefit annually from the health project in Adamawa and
Kebbi while about 80 percent of rural dwellers in Plateau, Ekiti
and Adamawa will get improved water supplies and sanitation. The
EU from 2012 to 2017 plans to invest about 200 million euros to
improve water and sanitation in the West African country,
according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
