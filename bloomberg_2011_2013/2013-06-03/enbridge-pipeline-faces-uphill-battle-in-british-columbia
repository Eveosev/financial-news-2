Enbridge Inc. (ENB)  faces an “uphill
battle” getting regulatory approval from the federal government
for its Northern Gateway pipeline in British Columbia, said the
province’s environment minister.  “The federal government really isn’t interested in forcing
something down the throat of a province that has legitimate
objections to it,” British Columbia Environment Minister Terry Lake said in an interview today.  Calgary-based Enbridge has proposed the C$6 billion ($5.8
billion) Northern Gateway pipeline to carry oil-sands crude from
 Alberta  to Canada’s Pacific Coast. The government of British
Columbia, environmental and some aboriginal groups oppose the
1,177-kilometer (731-mile) project because of the risk of spills
on land and in the ocean.  Enbridge has “come up short” in providing details on
protecting land and the marine environment from heavy oil
spills, said Lake. The province could halt the pipeline, if it’s
approved by federal regulators, through more than 60 permits
required from provincial authorities, the minister said.  “It wouldn’t be an easy path,” Lake said. “This company
has not been very successful in bringing First Nations
communities and other parties alongside with them.”  Canada ’s National Energy Board regulator has until the end
of the year to make a recommendation on Gateway.  To contact the editors responsible for this story:
