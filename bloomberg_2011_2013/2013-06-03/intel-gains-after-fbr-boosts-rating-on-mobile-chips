Intel Corp. (INTC)  rose the most in more
than 18 months after FBR Capital Markets raised its  rating  on
the stock to the equivalent of buy, saying the world’s largest
chipmaker’s development of mobile technology gives it “enough
new avenues of growth.”  Intel  advanced  4 percent to $25.24 at the close in New
York, for the biggest jump since Nov. 30, 2011. The shares have
risen 22 percent this year, while the Standard & Poor’s 500 has
added 15 percent.  Intel has redesigned one of its marquee chips to better
compete in the market for mobile devices and the new growth path
is enough to outweigh challenges in the personal-computer
market, Christopher Rolland, an FBR analyst, wrote in an
investor note. There is “strong buzz” for the new chip design,
known as Silvermont, he wrote in the note, where he upgraded the
shares from the equivalent of hold. He also increased his price
target to $28 from $23.  Additionally, Barron’s said in a June 1 article that
Intel’s shares may double within five years as early data
suggests the Santa Clara, California-based company’s chips are
poised to grab market share in tablet and smartphones.  To contact the reporter on this story:
