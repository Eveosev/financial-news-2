Russia’s dollar-denominated index
entered a  bear market  as OAO  Mechel (MTLR)  plunged after a report
signaled slowdown in the nation’s manufacturing sector and oil
slid on  China  growth concerns.  The RTS Index fell as much as 2.1 percent before trading
down 1.8 percent to 1,307.12 by 10:50 a.m. in Moscow, a 20
percent drop from this year’s high reached on Jan. 28. The  Micex
Index (INDEXCF)  slipped 1.5 percent to 1,330.65 in Moscow, the lowest
intraday level since April 23. Mechel, Russia’s steelmaker and
coking coal producer, lost as much as 8 percent, trading down
4.4 percent at 104.40 rubles, the biggest decliner.  Crude, Russia’s main export earner, declined 0.4 percent to
$91.59 a barrel in  New York , as signs of a slowing Chinese
economy and OPEC’s decision to maintain production boosted
speculation supply will outstrip demand. Chinese manufacturing
indexes showed small businesses struggling, sapping momentum in
the economy of the world’s second-biggest oil user. Russia’s
manufacturing gauge dropped to 50.4 in May, retreating for the
third straight month, showing “loss of growth momentum in the
Russian manufacturing sector,” HSBC Holdings Plc said in a
statement today.  “Russia is falling on concerns of lower commodity demand
from China, since it’s a key energy user,” Oleg Popov, who
manages $1 billion in assets for Allianz Investments, the asset-management arm of  Europe ’s biggest insurer, said by phone from
Moscow. “Energy companies have a major weighting in the  RTS
Index (RTSI$)  and since Russia has such a high dependency on
commodities, it’s taking a tumble today.”  Chinese Impact  HSBC and Markit Economics said their Chinese manufacturing
index, released today, fell to 49.2 in May from 50.4 in April. A
reading below 50 signals contraction. MSCI Inc. cut Mechel’s
American depositary receipts and  OAO Novolipetsk Steel (NLMK) ’s global
depositary receipts and OAO Russian Grids from its Russia Index,
effective today. NLMK retreated 2.4 percent to 43.70 rubles. The
Micex dropped 2.6 percent last month, a fourth monthly retreat.  Russia’s economy will probably expand 2.3 percent in the
second quarter, according to the median estimate of 9 economists
in a Bloomberg survey. That’s less than the 2.5 percent forecast
a month earlier.  Total fund outflows from Russia in the week ending May 29
reached $267 million, compared with $652 million from  Brazil ,
Sberbank CIB said in an e-mailed note on May 31.  Economic Growth  Russia’s economy grew at the weakest pace since 2009 in the
first quarter as the euro area’s longest recession hurt demand
for commodity exports, federal data showed on May 17. Russia’s
central bank kept its  main interest rates  on hold for an eighth
month in May.  The Micex tumbled the most in a year on May 23, the day
after U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said the
central bank could reduce the pace of its asset purchases if
officials see signs of sustained improvement in growth. The Fed
buys $85 billion of debt a month to support the economy by
putting downward pressure on  interest rates .  The Bloomberg Russia-US Equity Index slumped 7 percent in
May, capping a fourth monthly decline and extending this year’s
drop to 11 percent. OAO Lukoil, which has the second-biggest
weighting on the measure after  OAO Mobile TeleSystems (MBT) , capped
the longest stretch of monthly losses since 2011. OAO GMK
 Norilsk Nickel , the world’s biggest producer of the nickel,
slumped to the lowest price since May 16.  Magnit Falls  OAO Magnit,  Russia ’s biggest food retailer and the best
performer on the Micex this year, dropped 3.1 percent to
6,924.10 rubles. MSCI lifted Magnit’s global depositary receipts
to 9 percent from 4.7 percent in its Russia 10/40 Index last
week. Magnit is up 43 percent in Moscow this year and 37 percent
in  London .  “Even strong stocks, like Magnit, can’t hold up to today’s
retreat,” Aleksei Belkin, who helps manage about $6.8 billion
in assets as chief investment officer at Kapital Asset
Management LLC in Moscow, said by phone.  The volume of shares traded on the Micex was 19 percent
below the gauge’s 30-day average, while 10-day price swings
subsided to 28.257. The Micex’s Relative Strength Index was at
35.5, with the value below 30 signaling a measure has been
oversold.  Russian equities have the cheapest valuations among 21
 emerging markets  tracked by Bloomberg. The Micex trades at 4.9
times its 12-month estimated earnings and has dropped 9.9
percent this year, compared with a 10.2 multiple for the MSCI
Emerging Markets Index, which has retreated 5.1 percent.  The Russian Volatility Index surged 11 percent to 28.07.
The Bloomberg Russia-US Equity Index of the most-traded Russian
companies in the U.S. lost 2.5 percent to 87.61 on May 31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
