Surfing the news this morning, I was treated to a double dip of sludge, clicking from a Politico  story  on Representative Darrell Issa over to a Daily Beast  article  on Al Sharpton.  Issa's love of political theater and his penchant for wild accusations have rendered the House Oversight Committee he chairs completely ineffective. His investigations have been a joke. His hearings are models of partisan hackery. Yesterday he called White House press secretary Jay Carney a "paid liar" -- the kind of language that someone with Issa's  record  of  falsehoods  should probably avoid. But in the annals of cheap demagogy, the California Republican is a footnote compared with the Reverend Sharpton. I've never gotten over MSNBC's appalling decision to hire Sharpton as a host. Apparently Stuart Stevens hasn't either. In his Daily Beast article, he dredges up the Tawana Brawley affair, a hoax so personally vicious and socially destructive that Sharpton's central role in it should have permanently disqualified him from any position of responsibility anywhere in American society.  In 1987, Brawley was a 15-year-old found in her hometown of Wappingers Falls, New York, with racial and sexist epithets scrawled on her body and feces in her hair. She said she had been abducted and raped by white men. "He offered no proof."  That's the tie that binds Issa and Sharpton. Yet one of them has the gavel of an important House committee. The other has a national television show. Both are disgraceful. So are their employers.  (Francis Wilkinson is a member of the Bloomberg View editorial board.  Follow him  on Twitter.)
