Nestle SA (NESN) , the world’s biggest food
company, has room to spend more than 5 billion Swiss francs
($5.2 billion) on acquisitions under its current  credit rating ,
according to  Standard & Poor’s .  Debt-financed purchases beyond that amount could put the
Vevey, Switzerland-based company’s AA long-term debt rating at
risk, S&P said today, though it expects the DiGiorno pizza maker
to spend only about 2 billion francs a year on acquisitions.  Nestle is “highly cash-generative” and has a
“conservative financial policy,” said S&P, which assesses the
outlook for the debt rating to be stable.  The maker of Nescafe soluble coffee last year bought Pfizer
Inc.’s baby-food business for $11.9 billion.  AA is the third-highest  credit rating  on S&P’s scale, and
Moody’s Investors Service rates Nestle debt Aa2.  To contact the reporter on this story:
