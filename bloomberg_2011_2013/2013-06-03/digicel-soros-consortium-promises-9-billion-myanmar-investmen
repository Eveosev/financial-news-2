A consortium lead by Digicel Group
Ltd, billionaire  George Soros  and Myanmar property developer YSH
Finance Ltd promised to invest $9 billion in Myanmar’s new
mobile-phone network if it’s granted a license.  The companies will roll out a high-speed, fourth-generation
mobile-phone network across the country by Dec. 1, and its
wireless service will reach 96 percent of Myanmar’s population
by 2016, the group said in a statement today.  The group is one of 12 that made it onto a shortlist to bid
for the rights to two licenses that will allow carriers to build
and operate a nationwide wireless network in the Asian country
for 15 years. The government plans to announce the two winning
bids on June 27.  The other shortlisted companies or groups are Airtel
Consortium; Axiata Group; France Telecom-Orange and Marubeni;
KDDI, Sumitomo, Myanmar Information and Communication Technology
Development Corp. and A1 Construction; Millicom International
Cellular; MTN Consortium;  Qatar Telecom ; Singtel, KBZ and
Myanmar Telephone Co; Telenor; and Viettel Group.  Vodafone Group Plc (VOD)  and  China Mobile Ltd. (941) , the two biggest
mobile-phone companies, withdrew their bid on May 31, saying the
returns wouldn’t justify the investment required.  To contact the reporter on this story:
