Japan Post  Co. will install solar
panels on the rooftops of its post offices with an aim to sell
electricity to utilities as it takes advantage of higher rates
charged for clean energy.  Japan Post plans to set up panels at 286 facilities for a
total capacity of 11 megawatts, it said in a statement today.
The company plans to start selling electricity in March.  Solar Frontier K.K., a unit of Japanese refiner Showa Shell
Sekiyu K.K., will supply solar panels, the panel maker said in a
separate statement.  Solar Frontier makes thin-film panels using copper, indium,
gallium and selenium, known as CIGS.  To contact the reporter on this story:
