India , the world’s largest bullion
consumer, plans to review import policy after shipments surged
in the past two months, threatening to widen a record current-account deficit.  The country can’t afford high levels of imports and
policies will be reassessed if needed to curb purchases, Finance
Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram told reporters in New Delhi
today. He didn’t specify what changes could be made. Imports may
have been as high as 262 metric tons in May, he said.  India tripled tax on imports since January last year to 6
percent and placed curbs on purchases by banks after bullion
slumped the most in three decades in April, sparking a buying
frenzy for jewelry, coins and bars. The  Reserve Bank of India 
may ban all importers from shipping the metal on a consignment
basis, a finance ministry official told reporters in  New Delhi 
today, asking not to be identified citing government rules.  Gold and silver imports more than doubled to $7.5 billion
in April, according to the Commerce Ministry. Chidambaram’s
estimate of shipments for May seemed too high, Haresh Soni,
chairman of the All India Gems & Jewellery Trade Federation,
said by phone from New Delhi.  The  current-account deficit , the broadest measure of trade,
widened to an all-time high of $32.6 billion in the last quarter
of 2012, according to the central bank.  To contact the reporters on this story:
