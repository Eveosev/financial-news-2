Brent crude  fell below $100 a barrel
for the first time in a month as signs of a slowing Chinese
economy and OPEC’s decision to maintain production boosted
speculation that supply will outstrip demand.  Brent was little changed after dropping as much as 0.7
percent to $99.66 a barrel. Chinese manufacturing indexes showed
small businesses struggling, sapping momentum in the economy of
the world’s second-biggest consumer of oil. The Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries kept its output ceiling of 30
million barrels a day at a meeting in Vienna on May 31. JPMorgan
Chase & Co. reduced its Brent price forecast.  “There’s a fear that there could be oversupply given the
weakening signs from  China ,” Thina Saltvedt, an Oslo-based
analyst at Nordea Bank AB, said by phone. “OPEC basically said
with its quota decision that it is betting demand picks up
during the summer driving season.”  Brent for July settlement was at $100.86 a barrel, up 47
cents, on the ICE Futures Europe exchange at 10:43 a.m. London
time. It last traded below $100 on May 2. Prices slid 2.2
percent last week and 1.9 percent in May.  West Texas Intermediate for July delivery was at $92.07 a
barrel, up 10 cents, in electronic trading on the  New York 
Mercantile Exchange. Prices dropped 2.3 percent last week and
1.6 percent in May. Brent was at a premium of $8.81 to WTI
futures, compared with $8.42 on May 31.  Reduced Forecast  JPMorgan cut its forecast for Brent to an average of $113 a
barrel in the third quarter, from $120 previously, according to
a report e-mailed today. The bank reduced its outlook for the
three months ended December to $117 from $120, and for 2014 to
$117.50 from $122.50.  WTI is poised to extend losses after failing to breach
chart resistance for a second day, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Futures on May 31 halted an intraday advance below
the middle Bollinger Band, around $94 today, signaling where
sell orders may be clustered. Crude’s moving average
convergence-divergence indicator also fell below zero for the
first time in a month, showing a loss of technical momentum.  China’s official  Purchasing Managers ’ Index for smaller
companies fell to 47.3 in May from 47.6 the previous month, even
as the broader gauge rose to 50.8 from 50.6, the government said
June 1. A private manufacturing index today that includes small
enterprises fell more than forecast to 49.2, an eight-month low,
from 50.4. Levels below 50 signal contraction.  Rhine Closing  Barge traffic for the shipment of refined oil products
along the upper Rhine River will be halted until at least
Wednesday after heavy rains, Joachim Hessler, an operations
manager at Maintank Schiffahrtsgesellschaft in  Germany , said
today by phone.  Most OPEC member states expressed their support for crude
at about $100 a barrel last week. Some, including  Venezuela ,
voiced concern that excessive production by other members will
curb prices. The group, which supplies about 40 percent of the
world’s oil, is pumping about 1 million barrels a day more than
the target.  OPEC will next gather on Dec. 4. The 12-nation group’s
production has fluctuated from 30.6 million to 32.4 million
barrels a day since its current target was introduced in
December 2011, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Daily output was
31.03 million in May, the most in six months, with  Saudi Arabia 
 pumping  9.35 million, according to the data.  “The fact remains that OPEC is producing too much crude,”
Bjarne Schieldrop, chief commodity analyst at SEB AB, said by
phone from  Stockholm . “As long as they don’t cut production, it
will pull down prices.”  Hedge funds  reduced bullish WTI crude bets by the most in
six weeks, according to the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission’s May 31 Commitments of Traders report. Money
managers cut net-long positions, or wagers on higher prices, by
6.2 percent in the week ended May 28. It was the largest drop
since the seven days ended April 16.  To contact the reporter on this story:
