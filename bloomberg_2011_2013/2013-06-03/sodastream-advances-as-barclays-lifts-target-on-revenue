SodaStream International Ltd. (SODA) , the
Israeli home soda-machine maker, rallied to the highest level in
almost two years after Barclays Plc boosted its price estimate
by 82 percent on prospects that sales will increase.  Shares of SodaStream climbed 8.2 percent to $69.06, the
highest level since August 2011. The Airport City, Israel-based
manufacturer rose the most on the Bloomberg Israel-US Equity
Index of the largest Israeli companies traded in New York.  Barclays raised its share-price  estimate  for SodaStream to
$100, or 34 percent above the average projection of eight
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg and 48 percent above current
levels. The company will post earnings per share of $2.55 this
year and $3.28 in 2014,  David Kaplan , an analyst at Barclays,
wrote in a report to clients today, raising his profit
projections by at least 3.7 percent. Sales will increase 28
percent and 20 percent, respectively, in those years, he wrote.  “Conservative estimates for 20 percent top line growth are
not priced in,” Kaplan, who has the equivalent of a buy rating
for SodaStream, wrote.  Sales for the company, which makes devices that carbonate
water and sells flavor packets, will reach $1 billion by 2016,
from $436 million last year, Chief Executive Officer Daniel Birnbaum said at a shareholder meeting May 13. Since then, the
stock has surged 21 percent, compared with a 0.7 percent gain in
the Bloomberg Israel-US gauge. The rally has pushed the stock to
trade at 21.4 times estimated earnings, the highest since
February 2012, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
