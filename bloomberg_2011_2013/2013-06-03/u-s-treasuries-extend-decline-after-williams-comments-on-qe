U.S. Treasuries extended a decline,
pushing 10-year yields up four basis points, or 0.04 percentage
point, to 2.17 percent at 6:51 a.m. New York time after Federal
Reserve Bank of San Francisco President  John Williams  said the
nation’s asset-purchase stimulus program has potential to end
this year. The yield on 30-year bonds also rose four basis
points, to 3.32 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
