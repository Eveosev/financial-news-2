German bonds fell, with 10-year
yields rising to the most in three months, after Federal Reserve
Bank of San Francisco President  John Williams  said the U.S.
asset-purchase stimulus program might end this year.  The securities pared declines after a U.S. report showed
manufacturing unexpectedly contracted in May at the fastest pace
in four years.  Spain ’s 10-year yields climbed to the highest in
six weeks before the nation sells four billion euros ($5.2
billion) of debt this week. Global bonds declined 1.5 percent in
May, the steepest loss since 2004, as Fed policy makers sent
mixed signals about whether they would slow the pace of their
$85 billion monthly debt purchases this year.  “If the Fed tapers, it’s inevitable that bund yields are
going to be dragged higher,” said Gianluca Ziglio, executive
director of fixed-income research at Sunrise Brokers LLP in
 London . “The trend for lower yields is over. If German rates
rise then it’s going to be very difficult for peripheral spreads
to compress.”  Germany ’s 10-year bund yield climbed two basis points, or
0.02 percentage point, to 1.52 percent at 4:39 p.m. London time
after reaching 1.57 percent, the  highest  since Feb. 25. The 1.5
percent bond due May 2023 fell 0.15, or 1.50 euros per 1,000-euro face amount, to 99.81. The nation’s two-year note yield
added three basis points to 0.1 percent.  Spanish Auctions  Williams, who doesn’t vote on monetary policy this year,
told reporters in  Stockholm  that the Fed may start reducing the
purchases by the summer and potentially end the quantitative-easing plan by year end.  The  Institute for Supply Management ’s factory index fell to
49 from the prior month’s 50.7, the Tempe, Arizona-based group’s
report showed today. A level below 50 indicates contraction. The
median forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg was 51.  Spain is scheduled to auction bonds due in 2015, 2016 and
2023 on Thursday, the same day that European Central Bank policy
makers meet to set monetary policy. The ECB will maintain the
benchmark interest  rate  at a record-low 0.5 percent, according
to 57 of the 59 economists in a Bloomberg News  survey  before the
announcement on June 6. The remaining two forecast a reduction
to 0.25 percent.  “Risk appetite is waning,” said  Nick Stamenkovic , a
fixed-income strategist at RIA Capital Markets Ltd. in
Edinburgh. “Supply is looming in Spain, pressuring
peripherals.”  The Spanish 10-year bond yield climbed two basis points to
4.46 percent. It earlier touched 4.53 percent, the highest since
April 22.  Tender Offer  An index based on a survey of purchasing managers in
 manufacturing  industries in the 17-nation region was 48.3 last
month, up from an initial estimate of 47.8 on May 23, London-based Markit Economics said today.  Greek bonds advanced as Japonica Partners announced a
tender offer for as much as 2.9 billion euros of the securities.  The yield on  Greece ’s securities due in February 2023 fell
four basis points to 9.34 percent.  The market for Greek bonds doesn’t reflect their intrinsic
value, due to volatility and illiquidity, Japonica said in an e-mailed statement.  Volatility on Belgian bonds was the highest in euro-area
markets today followed by those of Ireland and Portugal,
according to measures of 10-year debt, the yield spread between
two- and 10-year securities, and credit-default swaps.  German securities handed investors a loss of 0.7 percent
this year through May 31, according to the Bloomberg Germany
Sovereign Bond  Index. (BGER)  Spanish  government bonds  gained 6.5
percent, a separate index shows.  To contact the reporter on this story:
