Mitsubishi Corp. (8058)  will take control of
grain supplier Los Grobo Ceagro do  Brazil  S.A. as Japan’s
biggest trading company seeks to boost corn and soybean supplies
to meet Asian demand.  A Brazilian unit of Mitsubishi will purchase 60 percent of
Goiania-based Ceagro to raise the Japanese company’s stake to 80
percent, it said today in a  statement . The Japanese company will
spend 50 billion yen ($497 million) to raise its stake in
Ceagro, the Nikkei reported June 1, without saying where it got
the information.  Ceagro trades 1 million metric tons of grain a year, and
also supplies seeds, fertilizer and agricultural chemicals.
Mitsubishi’s Brazilian unit currently trades about 2 million
tons of grain a year, according to the statement.  The purchase will help Mitsubishi improve grain handling
logistics in Brazil and bolster supply as it seeks to increase
grain trading to 20 million tons annually by 2020, the Tokyo-based company said, without giving a comparative figure for
current volume. Mitsubishi is targeting grain producers in North
and South America and  Australia  to help meet demand in Japan,
China and southeast Asia, it said in the statement.  Japanese traders have spent more than $4 billion buying
grain-supply firms in the last three years led by  Marubeni
Corp. (8002) ’s $3.6 billion purchase of Gavilon Group LLC in the U.S.
 Mitsui & Co. (8031)  invested about $459 million to take control of
Brazil’s Multigrain SA in 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
