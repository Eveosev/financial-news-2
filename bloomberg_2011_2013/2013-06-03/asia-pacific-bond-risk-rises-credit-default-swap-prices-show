The cost of insuring corporate and
sovereign bonds against non-payment increased in the Asia-Pacific region, according to credit-default swap traders.  The Markit iTraxx  Japan  index rose 4 basis points to 100.5
basis points as of 9:11 a.m. in  Tokyo , Citigroup Inc. prices
show. The gauge, which advanced last month for the first time
since September, is set for its highest close since April 4,
according to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index climbed 3 basis points to
113 as of 10:23 a.m. in Sydney, according to National Australia
Bank Ltd. prices. The benchmark, which has ranged from 96.1 to
127.5 this year, is headed for its highest level since April 22,
CMA data show.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan rose 1.5 basis points to 117 as of 8:33
a.m. in  Singapore , Westpac Banking Corp. prices show. The
measure is set for its fourth consecutive daily increase to its
highest since April 10, according to CMA, which is owned by
McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the
private market.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . An increase signals deteriorating perceptions of
creditworthiness, while a drop suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
