Vale SA, the world’s largest  iron-ore 
producer, gained the most in two weeks and beat metals and
mining peers as prices for the steelmaking material rebound.  Vale, based in  Rio de Janeiro ,  advanced  3.3 percent to
29.58 reais at 1:49 p.m. in  Sao Paulo , the biggest increase
since May 20. The stock, which traded at 55 percent its three-month daily average volume, was the best performer in the MSCI
Brazil/Materials  index , which rose 2.1 percent.  Iron ore for  immediate delivery  rose 1.4 percent to $111.90
a ton today, the first increase in eight days, according to data
compiled by The Steel Index Ltd. The recovery is driving up the
share price of Vale, which is increasingly delivering its iron
ore at spot prices, said Rodrigo Garcilazo, an equity analyst at
GBM Grupo Bursatil Mexicano SA.  “The share price is every time more impacted by iron ore
spot prices,” he said in a telephone interview from Santiago,
Chile, today. “At current prices, shares are attractive.”  MMX Mineracao & Metalicos SA, the iron-ore producer of
Brazilian billionaire  Eike Batista , rose 2.4 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
