The ruble weakened to the lowest in
11 months against the Russian central bank’s target basket as a
slump in oil and a decline in manufacturing damped investor
appetite for assets in the world’s biggest energy exporter.  The ruble retreated 0.5 percent against Bank Rossii’s
dollar-euro basket to 36.4458 and declined 0.4 percent versus
the dollar to 32.0655 by 11:55 a.m. in Moscow. The yield on
benchmark OFZ bonds due February 2027 rose six basis points, or
0.06 percentage point, to 7.60 percent, the highest since
November.  Brent crude dropped as much as 0.7 percent to $99.66 per
barrel today, extending a 1.8 percent decline on May 31. Oil and
natural-gas industries contribute about half of  Russia ’s budget
revenue. Russian manufacturing PMI declined to 50.4 in May from
50.6 in April, HSBC Holdings Plc reported, citing data compiled
by  Markit Economics .  The decline “points to persistent sluggish growth in the
manufacturing sector,” Dmitry Polevoy, an economist for Russia
and the Commonwealth of Independent States at ING Groep NV in
Moscow, said in an e-mailed note.  The Federal Statistics Service is scheduled to report
consumer-price data for May either tomorrow or on June 5.
Inflation accelerated to 7.3 percent from 7.2 percent in April,
according to economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  Bank Rossii is due to discuss the cost of borrowing in the
first half of June after leaving its main interest rates
unchanged last month because inflation was more than 100 basis
points above its 5 percent to 6 percent target range for the
year.  The situation “hardly supports a rate cut, as the central
bank was adamant in a similar situation in May,” Polevoy said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
