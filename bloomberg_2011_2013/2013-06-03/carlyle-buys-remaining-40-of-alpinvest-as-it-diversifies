Carlyle Group LP (CG) , the world’s second-biggest private-equity firm, agreed to buy the remaining 40
percent of AlpInvest Partners NV, a Dutch investment manager in
which it took a 60 percent stake in 2011.  Carlyle will pay for the deal using 2.8 million shares and
4 million euros ($5.2 million) in cash, the Washington-based
firm said in a regulatory filing today. That would translate
into about $88 million based on Carlyle’s closing share price of
$29.16 on May 31. Carlyle bought the initial stake in AlpInvest,
which invests money in private-equity vehicles through funds-of-funds, for an undisclosed price.  Carlyle is taking full control of AlpInvest as part of its
broader effort to diversify beyond leveraged buyouts, which
produce volatile earnings. AlpInvest, which oversees 37 billion
euros ($48 billion) invested in private-equity funds and other
deals, is part of Carlyle’s Solutions business, run by Jacques Chappuis, who joined last month.  AlpInvest has about 150 employees, who will continue to
make investment decisions independently of Carlyle, according to
the filing. The deal is expected to close next month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
