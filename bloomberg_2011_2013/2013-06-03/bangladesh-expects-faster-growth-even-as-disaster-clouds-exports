Bangladesh ’s finance minister said
economic growth will accelerate next fiscal year, signaling he
expects the garment-export industry to weather safety concerns
sparked by a factory collapse that killed over 1,000 workers.  The economy will expand 7.2 percent in the 12 months
through June 2014, Abul Maal Abdul Muhith, who is scheduled to
present the budget on June 6, said in an interview on May 31.
That compares with a provisional estimate of 6.03 percent for
2012-2013 from the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics.  “The main challenge in the next budget is political
instability,” Muhith said, referring to frequent protests and
strikes ahead of a general election due in the  $123 billion
economy  by early next year.  Europe and the U.S. have called for better safety after the
April 24 collapse of the Rana Plaza factory, the worst
industrial accident in Bangladesh’s history. The nation depends
on export earnings from clothing sales to retailers such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc. to sustain growth and cut poverty.  About  77 percent  of the population lives on less than $2
per day, according to the latest available data from the World
Bank. A legacy of political volatility and corruption are among
the obstacles to faster development in the South Asian country.  To contact the reporter on this story:
