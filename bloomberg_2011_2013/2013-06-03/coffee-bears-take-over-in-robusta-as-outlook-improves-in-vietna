Money managers are the most bearish
on robusta coffee in 15 months as speculation about increased
supplies from  Vietnam  sent futures heading for the worst second
quarter since 2009.  Managers were net-short, or betting on lower prices, by
2,209 futures and options as of May 28, the most since Feb. 7,
2012, NYSE Liffe data today showed. They had been net-long, or
betting on higher prices, since Dec. 25.  The harvest in Vietnam, the world’s largest grower of
robusta used in instant coffee and espresso, may climb 4.9
percent to 1.5 million metric tons in the 12 months starting
Oct. 1 as rain last month ended a drought in the nation’s main
growing region, a Bloomberg survey in May showed. Robusta
futures fell 7.9 percent this quarter, heading for the biggest
drop for the April to June period since 2009.  “The trigger has been the continually strong flow of
exports from Vietnam,” said  Andrea Thompson , head of research
and analysis at CoffeeNetwork, a unit of INTL FCStone Inc., in
 Belfast ,  Northern Ireland . “Fundamentally, there’s no support
for the market.”  Futures dropped 1.8 percent this year to $1,889 a ton after
climbing 6.3 percent last year. Prices may fall to $1,700 a ton,
FCSTone said in a report today, without giving a timeframe. The
Standard & Poor’s GSCI gauge of 24 commodities is down 4 percent
and the MSCI All-Country World of equities climbed 7.8 percent.
A Bank of America Corp. Index shows Treasuries lost 1.2 percent.  Eight-Year Low  Robusta coffee gained 6.6 percent in the first three months
of the year as drought in Vietnam threatened to cut output. The
beans led gains among the four agricultural commodities traded
in London. In a March 15 Bloomberg survey, traders and shippers
forecast Vietnam’s coffee harvest would drop next season to 1
million tons, the lowest in eight years.  Since then, rain returned to  Dak Lak , the country’s main
growing region, easing drought concerns. Most areas in the
province will receive 50 millimeters (2 inches) to 90
millimeters of rain in the first 10 days of the month, the
Meteorology and Hydrology Department said in e mailed report on
June 1. In the first 10 days of 2012, rainfall recorded at the
10 stations monitored by the province’s weather office average
39.33 millimeters.  In white sugar, money managers boosted bets on lower prices
by 14 percent to 8,787 futures and options in the week ended May
28, NYSE Liffe data showed. They also reduced bets on higher
cocoa prices by 4.2 percent to 41,105 contracts and trimmed bets
on falling feed-wheat prices by 14 futures and options to 364
contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
