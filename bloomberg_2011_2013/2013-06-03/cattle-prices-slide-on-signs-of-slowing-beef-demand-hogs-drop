Cattle futures fell as a slump in
U.S. beef prices from a record high last month signaled slowing
demand. Hogs also declined.  U.S. meatpackers processed 594,000 head of cattle last
week, down 0.7 percent from the same period a year earlier, U.S.
Department of Agriculture data show. Wholesale  beef  dropped 1.1
percent last week to $2.0665, the biggest weekly slump since
March, government data show. Prices rallied as much as 8.9
percent this year to $2.1137 on May 23, the highest on record
going back to at least January 2004.  “Beef markets began to run out of steam last week as
buyers balked at sharply higher asking levels from packers,”
Troy Vetterkind, the owner of Vetterkind Cattle Brokerage LLC in
Thorp,  Wisconsin , said in an e-mailed report. “We could likely
see some early week fill-in business, but once that gets done, I
would look for beef prices to move lower.”  Cattle futures for August delivery fell 0.9 percent to
$1.1935 a pound at 10:36 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange. The commodity lost 1.2 percent in May, the fourth
straight monthly decline for the most-active contract.  Feeder-cattle futures for August settlement rose less than
0.1 percent to $1.4435 a pound.  Hog futures for July settlement declined 0.4 percent to
93.45 cents a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
