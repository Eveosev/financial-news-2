Shares in Swiss cantonal banks
plummeted on anticipation parliament will approve a bill that
would allow Swiss banks to cooperate with U.S. authorities in
their bid to catch tax evaders.  Basler Kantonalbank stock declined 8.7 percent, the most
since at least 1989, to 86.75 francs at 2:41 p.m. in Zurich.
Fellow regional lender  St. Galler Kantonalbank (SGKN)  was down 3.8
percent at 359.25 francs, its lowest intraday level since Oct.
10, while  Banque Cantonale Vaudoise (BCVN)  declined 3 percent to 483.25
francs.  The economics committee of the Swiss parliament’s upper
house meets today for an initial closed-door hearing on the
plan, the details of which have not been made public. Both
houses are due to debate the measure in the current session,
which runs through June 21.  “The U.S. is putting a lot of pressure on  Switzerland , as
they want the cantonal banks to be treated the same way as the
other Swiss banks,” said John Plassard, who helps oversee $28
billion as vice president at Mirabaud Securities LLP in Geneva.
“Investors are nervous.”  Switzerland has been in talks with the U.S. for more than
two years to resolve a Justice Department investigation of at
least 14 financial institutions, including  Basler Kantonalbank (BSKP) ,
that allegedly helped Americans hide money from the  Internal
Revenue Service . An agreement could lead to total fines of as
much as 10 billion Swiss francs ($10.4 billion), the Tages-Anzeiger reported.  To contact the reporters on this story:
