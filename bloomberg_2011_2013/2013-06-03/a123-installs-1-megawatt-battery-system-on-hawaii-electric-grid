A123 Energy Solutions, a unit of
China’s Wanxiang Group Corp. that produces energy-storage
devices, installed a 1-megawatt battery system that will
stabilize the  power grid  on the Hawaiian island of Maui.  The batteries installed at a Maui Electric Co. substation
can store electricity for one hour, A123 said today in a
statement. The system regulates voltage on the grid, shifts peak
loads and retains excess power generated by  wind turbines .  The company installed in December another battery system at
a Maui wind farm that has 11 megawatts of storage capacity and
holds power for about 25 minutes, Roger Lin, A123’s director of
product marketing, said today in an e-mail. Power storage is
becoming a more important part of renewable-energy projects
because they produce electricity intermittently, depending on
the weather.  Wanxiang received court approval to acquire the assets of
 A123 Systems Inc. (AONEQ)  in December, almost two months after the
Waltham, Massachusetts-based company filed for bankruptcy.
China’s biggest auto-parts maker formed the A123 Energy
Solutions unit last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
