Deutsche Lufthansa AG (LHA)  Chief Executive
Officer Christoph Franz said  Europe ’s second-l;argest airline
may replace its residual fleet of  Boeing Co. (BA)  747-400 jumbos with
twin-engine jets as it looks to cut fuel costs.  The replacement of about 13 747-400s would take place next
decade when it would make sense to buy twin-engine jets that are
more fuel efficient, Franz said. Lufthansa is a buyer of the
four-engined Airbus SAS A380 superjumbo and Boeing 747-8s.  The Boeing 777-9X the U.S. manufacturer is considering
building from the end of the decade would have almost the seat-count as a jumbo and would be a candidate, Franz said.  Lufthansa already is in advanced talks with Airbus and
Boeing to buy about 50 long-haul planes to replace its A340
fleet, with a selection due by year’s end, Franz told reporters
at the  International Air Transport Association ’s annual general
meeting in  Cape Town . The planes will span 250 to 350 seats, he
said.  The airline is considering buying the Boeing 787-10X, which
 Singapore Airlines Ltd. (SIA)  last week said it would buy if the
Chicago-based aircraft maker commits to building the plane,
Franz said. The 787-9 is also a candidate along with the
A350-900 and larger -1000 from rival Airbus, he said.  Franz said the aircraft makers shouldn’t over-design their
planes to appeal to Middle East carriers at the cost of others.  “We are seeing that the airplanes are very highly powered
and are being designed for long-range that is longer than the
established U.S. and European carriers would require,” Franz
said.  Lufthansa is replacing older, less fuel efficient planes as
it also implements the “score” efficiency program, a cost
cutting initiative to lift operating profit to a record 2.3
billion euros ($2.99 billion) by 2015. That program is showing
“good progress,” he said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
