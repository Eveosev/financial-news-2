Exelon Corp. (EXC)  returned its 619-megawatt Oyster Creek 1 reactor to full power in  New Jersey ,
boosting U.S. Northeastern generation to a  seven-week high  and
helping  nationwide  production climb for a second day.  Total  U.S. output  increased 0.7 percent to 87,942
megawatts, or 86 percent of capacity, according to Nuclear
Regulatory Commission data compiled by Bloomberg. Generation was
5.7 percent higher than a  year ago  with 12 of 104 reactors shut.  Oyster Creek 1, 33 miles (53 kilometers) north of  Atlantic
City , returned to full power late yesterday after completing
repairs to a water flow regulator valve, said Suzanne D’Ambrosio, a company spokeswoman based at the plant. The unit
operated at 70 percent of capacity when the commission compiled
its report  early yesterday .  The increase led nuclear output higher by 1.8 percent to
 22,020 megawatts  in the Northeast, the highest since April 14,
according to commission data compiled by Bloomberg. Plants
operated by  Entergy Corp. (ETR)  and  PPL (PPL)  Corp. also aided the gain.  Pilgrim 1, an Entergy-operated reactor with the capacity to
generate 685 megawatts near Plymouth,  Massachusetts , increased
to 100 percent of power for the first time since completing
refueling and maintenance that began in April. The plant ran at
85 percent of capacity yesterday.  Susquehanna Reactors  PPL raised power to 14 percent at the 1,149-megawatt
Susquehanna 1 reactor after shutting the unit in early May to
complete turbine modifications. Susquehanna Unit 2, which also
operated at 14 percent of capacity, is returning from refueling.
The reactors are 50 miles northwest of Allentown, Pennsylvania.  “Both units are in the startup process,” Joe Scopelliti,
a spokesman based in Berwick, Pennsylvania, said in an e-mail.
“We will continue to monitor the turbines on both units to
confirm the modifications that were made.”  Reactor maintenance shutdowns, usually undertaken in the
U.S. spring or fall when energy use is lowest, may increase
consumption of natural gas and coal to generate electricity. The
average refueling down time was 46 days in 2012, according to
the  Nuclear Energy Institute .  To contact the reporter on this story:
