The  Boston Red Sox  beat the New York
Yankees 3-0 behind solo home runs from  David Ortiz  and Jose Iglesias in a Major League Baseball game that was called due to
rain after the top of the sixth inning.  The Red Sox snapped a scoreless tie in the fourth inning
last night as  Dustin Pedroia  scored on a groundout, while
Iglesias and Ortiz added homers off New York starting pitcher
Hiroki Kuroda the next two innings at Yankee Stadium.  Clay Buchholz  allowed two hits over five innings to get the
win for the Red Sox, who improved their record to 35-23 and hold
a 2 1/2-game lead over the Baltimore Orioles (32-25) atop the
American League Eastern Division. The Yankees fell to 31-25 and
are now tied with the Tampa Bay Rays for third place after their
seventh loss in eight games.  The start of last nightâ€™s game was delayed 45 minutes.
There was another 37-minute halt with one out in the top of the
sixth inning, after which the players returned for four minutes
before the field was covered again by the tarp. The game was
stopped for good 45 minutes later.  The Orioles beat the Detroit Tigers 4-2 yesterday as Chris Davis hit his 20th home run of the season, while the Rays rolled
past the Cleveland Indians 11-3.  The  New York Mets  were swept in their three-game series in
Miami, losing to the Marlins 11-6 yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
