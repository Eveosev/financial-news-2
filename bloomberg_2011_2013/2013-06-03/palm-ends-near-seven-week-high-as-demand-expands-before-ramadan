Palm oil  closed near the highest
level in seven weeks on speculation that food demand will
rebound before the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan.  The contract for August delivery ended at 2,396 ringgit
($773) a metric ton on the Bursa Malaysia Derivatives. Futures
rose 4.9 percent in May, and finished at 2,399 ringgit on May
29, the costliest for the most-active contract since April 8.
Palm for  physical  delivery in June was at 2,360 ringgit,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Consumption typically expands during Ramadan, which falls
in July this year, as observers break day-long fasts with
communal meals. Malaysia’s  reserves  have dropped 27 percent to
1.93 million tons in April from a record in December, according
to data from the nation’s palm oil board.  “We should see pretty healthy demand for crude palm oil,”
said  Carey Wong , an analyst at OCBC Investment Research Pte.
“That should keep the stockpiles coming off further.”  Soybean oil for July delivery climbed 0.5 percent to 48.61
cents a pound on the Chicago Board of Trade, while soybeans
advanced 1.8 percent to $15.375 a bushel. Refined palm oil for
September delivery increased 0.9 percent to close at 6,192  yuan 
($1,010) a ton on the Dalian Commodity Exchange, while soybean
oil gained 0.6 percent to end at 7,522 yuan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
