South African yellow corn futures
declined the most in four weeks on speculation that an increase
to a more than five-month high was overdone.  Yellow corn for delivery in July, the most active contract,
fell 2.5 percent to 2,290.80 rand ($230) a metric ton, the most
since May 6, by the midday close in Johannesburg. On May 31 it
rose to 2,350 rand, the highest since Dec. 5. Earlier today it
stretched gains to as high as 2,360 rand, the highest since Dec.
3 before retreating. On May 31 it rose to 2,350 rand, the
highest since Dec. 6. The white variety for delivery in the same
month lost 2.3 percent to 2,315 rand a ton.  On May 31, the 14-day relative strength index for yellow
corn, also called maize, reached 70.1. A reading above 70 is an
indication to technical analysts that the price is poised to
drop. The relative strength index for the white variety reached
70.6. The South African rand fell to a four-year low on that
day.  “The market must have corrected itself from the high
prices experienced last week, Brink van Wyk, a trader at BVG
(Pty) Ltd., said by phone from  Pretoria .  The country is  Africa ’s largest producer of corn. Meal from
the white variety is a staple food while yellow is mainly used
as animal feed.  Wheat for delivery in July dropped 1.6 percent, the most
since April 2, to close at 3,649 rand a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
