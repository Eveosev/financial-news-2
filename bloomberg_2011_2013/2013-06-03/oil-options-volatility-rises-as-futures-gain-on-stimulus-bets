 Crude oil options volatility
increased as the underlying futures rose the most in four weeks.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
July, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 23.49 percent on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  at 3:15 p.m., versus 22.4 percent May 31.  West Texas Intermediate crude for July delivery gained
$1.48, or 1.6 percent, to settle at $93.45 a barrel on the
Nymex. The Dollar Index, a weighing of the U.S. greenback
against a basket of major currencies, fell 0.9 percent, fueling
bets that the  Federal Reserve  will maintain its pace of
stimulus.  The most-active options in electronic trading today were
July $87 puts, which declined 20 cents to 20 cents a barrel on
volume of 3,072 contracts on the Nymex. July $100 calls were the
second-most active, rising 4 cents to 9 cents on 2,995 lots.  Puts accounted for 51 percent of electronic trading volume
today and 56 percent of the prior trading dayâ€™s volume of 93,143
contracts.  July $83 puts were the most-active options traded in the
previous session, with 4,377 contracts changing hands. They rose
3 cents to 9 cents a barrel. July $85 puts gained 7 cents to 19
cents a barrel on 4,224 lots.  Open interest was highest for December $105 calls with
39,301 contracts. Next were September $85 puts with 38,324 lots
and July $110 calls with 35,936.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on open-outcry volume, where the bulk of options activity occurs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
