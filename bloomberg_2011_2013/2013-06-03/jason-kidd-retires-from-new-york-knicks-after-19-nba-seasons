Point guard  Jason Kidd  retired from
the  National Basketball Association , ending a 19-season career
ranked second in both assists and steals.  Kidd, 40, retired after playing his final season for the
 New York Knicks , averaging career lows of six points and 3.3
assists per game, the team said in a statement.  A 10-time All-Star, he also played for the  Dallas
Mavericks , Phoenix Suns and  New Jersey Nets , with 12,091 assists
and 2,684 steals trailing only Hall of Fame member John Stockton
in each category.  “My time in professional basketball has been an incredible
journey, but one that must come to an end after 19 years,” Kidd
said. “As I reflect on my time with the four teams I
represented in the NBA, I look back fondly at every season and
thank each and every one of my teammates and coaches that joined
me on the court.”  Kidd was the No. 2 pick in the 1994 NBA draft, behind Glenn Robinson. He exits professional basketball with career averages
of 12.6 points, 8.7 assists, 6.3 rebounds and 1.9 steals per
game.  Dallas traded Kidd to the Suns during his third season in
the league and he played four more years in Phoenix. He joined
the New Jersey Nets in 2001, helping the team to two appearances
in the NBA Finals. After being traded back to the Mavericks
during the 2007-08 season, Kidd won his only NBA title in 2011.  No Points  Kidd joined the Knicks this season. He didn’t score a point
in New York’s final 10 playoff games, going 0-17 from the floor
in that stretch. His playing time dipped as a result -- he
averaged 26.3 minutes per game against the  Boston Celtics  in the
first round and 14.7 minutes against the  Indiana Pacers , who
eliminated the Knicks in six games.  A two-time Olympic gold medalist, Kidd also was named an
All-NBA First Team selection five times and an All-Defensive
First Team pick after four seasons.  Kidd pleaded guilty to a 2001 misdemeanor assault charge
after he was arrested for hitting his then-wife. He was ordered
to undergo counseling.  To contact the reporter on this story:
