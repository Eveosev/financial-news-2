About 60 percent of teenagers would
vote against independence for  Scotland  in next year’s
referendum, according to a study by Edinburgh University.  Twenty-one percent of respondents were in favor of
independence, while 19 percent were undecided, according to the
poll of people aged 14 to 17 for the Economic and Social
Research Council and published in the  Herald  newspaper today.
Two-thirds of the 1,000 teenagers asked said they wanted more
information before making a final decision.  First Minister  Alex Salmond  demanded that the franchise be
extended to over-16s as part of negotiations with parliament in
 London  over the terms of the referendum set for Sept. 18, 2014,
predicting they would be more inclined to back independence.  The findings also showed that teenagers were engaged in the
debate and likely to vote. The survey found 94 percent of
teenagers were aware of the referendum and only 11 percent had
not discussed it with friends, family or classmates.  The survey also found that 17.3 percent of girls planned to
vote for independence compared with 25 percent of boys.  To contact the reporter on this story:
