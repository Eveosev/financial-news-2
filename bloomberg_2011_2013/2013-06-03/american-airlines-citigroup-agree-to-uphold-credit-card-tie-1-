Citigroup Inc. (C)  and  American Airlines 
agreed that the airline would retain the bank’s partnership in
its loyalty credit-card and mileage program, according to a
court filing.  “For the avoidance of doubt, the Debtors irrevocably and
as of the date hereof waive any right to seek to reject the
Citibank Agreements unless the Plan is withdrawn or the Court
refuses to enter the Confirmation Order,” lawyers for the
airlines said in court papers.  American’s AAdvantage loyalty program has about 69 million
members and will regain its ranking as the industry’s largest
when the Fort Worth, Texas-based airline merges with US Airways
Group Inc. The two carriers have been negotiating with banks
including New York-based Citigroup and Barclays Plc to provide a
branded  credit card  once they combine.  “This filing is a step toward final assumption of Citi’s
existing contracts with American Airlines. We look forward to
continuing our productive relationship with American and serving
our shared customers during this exciting phase of growth,”
Emily Collins, a Citigroup spokeswoman, said in an e-mailed
statement. She declined to comment on what could happen in the
future regarding Barclays’ involvement.  AMR Corp. (AAMRQ) , the parent of American Airlines, filed for
bankruptcy on Nov. 29, 2011, and expects to exit court
protection in this year’s third quarter.  The case is In re AMR Corp., 11-15463, U.S. Bankruptcy
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
