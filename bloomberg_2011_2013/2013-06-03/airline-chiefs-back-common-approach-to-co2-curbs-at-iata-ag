IATA airline association members
meeting in Cape Town approved proposals for compliance with a
commitment requiring carbon-neutral growth after 2020.  The resolution urges the adoption of a single global
standard that will neither require airlines to fund each others’
emissions nor stiffle growth at emerging carriers.  The International Air Transport Association produced the
proposal ahead of the 38th ICAO general assembly, where
governments will consider measures to curb aircraft carbon
emissions associated with global wamring.  While the measure was backed by an “overwhelming”
majority of executives voting at the meeting, according to IATA
Chairman and Qantas Airways Ltd. chief Alan Joyce, Air India and
Air China both voiced concerns regarding the issue.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
