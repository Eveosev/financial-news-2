Severn Trent Plc (SVT) , the U.K.’s second-largest publicly traded water company, rejected a sweetened
takeover offer from a group led by Borealis Infrastructure
Management Inc., saying the proposal for 2,125 pence a share
undervalues its stock.  The proposal from LongRiver Partners, which is a group that
also includes the Kuwait Investment Office and Universities
Superannuation Scheme Ltd., was detailed in a statement from
Severn Trent today. The group’s offer assumes the final dividend
of 45.51 pence wasn’t yet paid to shareholders.  The proposal “fails to reflect the significant long term
value of Severn Trent or to recognize its future potential,” it
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
