Natural gas futures in the U.S. fell
for a sixth day, the longest losing streak since January, on
forecasts for milder weather in June that would reduce demand
for electricity to power air conditioners.  Gas for July delivery slid as much as 0.8 percent to $3.951
per million British thermal units in electronic trading on the
 New York Mercantile Exchange , its second straight day below $4.
Futures were at $3.969 at 2:21 p.m. in Singapore. The contract
dropped 1 percent to $3.984 per million Btu on May 31.  Heat in the eastern U.S. will be replaced by milder weather
from June 5 through June 9, the MDA Weather Services in
Gaithersburg,  Maryland , said last week. The West Coast will have
hotter-than-normal weather from June 5 through June 14 while the
Midwest and Northeast may see a return to above-normal readings
heading into the middle of the month.  Power plants  will account for 32 percent of U.S. gas
consumption this year, according to the Energy Information
Administration.  To contact the reporter on this story:
