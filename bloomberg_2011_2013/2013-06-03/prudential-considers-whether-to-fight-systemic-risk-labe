Prudential Financial Inc. (PRU) , the No. 2
U.S. life insurer, said itâ€™s considering whether to contest

named as systemically important.  The Financial Stability Oversight Council told Prudential

the Newark, New Jersey-based insurer said today in an e-mailed
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
