Gasoline advanced as  Brent crude 
strengthened, increasing the cost of oil imports priced off the
London benchmark. The crack spread widened.  Futures advanced as much as 2.5 percent when Brent climbed
after  China ’s manufacturing unexpectedly  rose  in May and euro-area factory output contracted less than expected. July’s  crack
spread  versus West Texas Intermediate grew 88 cents to $24.62,
the first gain in six days. Gasoline’s  premium  over Brent added
30 cents to $15.62 a barrel.  “Products are pretty much following Brent,” said Dominick Chirichella, senior partner at the Energy Management Institute
in  New York . “It started this morning. The PMI in China wasn’t
so bad.”  Gasoline for July delivery rose 2.95 cents, or 1.1 percent,
to $2.7844 a gallon at 9:48 a.m. on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . Trading volume for all contracts was 6 percent above
the 100-day average for the time of day.  Prices fell 2.1 percent last week and 0.8 percent in May,
the second straight monthly decline.  ULSD for July delivery rose 3.56 cents, or 1.3 percent, to
$2.817 a gallon on trading volume that was 28 percent above the
100-day average. Futures slipped 2.3 percent last week and 2.8
percent in May, the fourth consecutive monthly decline.  The July ULSD contract’s  crack spread  versus West Texas
Intermediate crude oil widened $1.02 to $25.87 a barrel, while
the  premium over Brent  gained 47 cents to $16.90 a barrel.  Gasoline at the  pump , averaged nationwide, rose 0.6 cent to
$3.623 a gallon, Heathrow, Florida-based AAA, the nation’s
largest motoring organization, said today on its website. Prices
are 3.3 cents above a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
