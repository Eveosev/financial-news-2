The pound climbed to the highest
level in three weeks versus the dollar as a report showed U.K.
manufacturing expanded more than economists forecast in May.  Sterling strengthened for a second day against the euro.
The yield on 10-year gilts rose to the highest level in 12 weeks
as analysts predicted the  Bank of England  will leave its asset-purchase stimulus program unchanged when Governor Mervyn King
chairs his final policy-setting meeting on June 5-6. His
successor,  Mark Carney , takes over on July 1.  “The strong manufacturing data helps the pound but equally
we’re all waiting to see what Carney brings,” said  Simon Derrick , London-based chief currency strategist at Bank of  New
York  Mellon Corp. “Until we’ve got a clearer sense on that I
don’t think sterling will do anything particularly dramatic. The
manufacturing data helps the idea that maybe we don’t need to be
quite so accommodative in monetary policy.”  The pound rose 1 percent to $1.5354 at 4:34 p.m.  London 
time after reaching $1.5376, the most since May 13. Sterling
strengthened 0.3 percent to 85.25 pence per euro.  The currency will probably trade in a range of $1.50 to
$1.53 for the foreseeable future, Derrick said.  The pound has fallen 2.4 percent this year, the worst
performer after the yen and Australian dollar among the 10
developed-market currencies tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The U.S. currency gained 4 percent and the
euro strengthened 3 percent.  Manufacturing Data  A gauge based on a survey of purchasing managers in
 manufacturing  industries rose to 51.3 from a revised 50.2 in
April, Markit Economics and the  Chartered Institute of
Purchasing and Supply  said today. The median estimate of 33
analysts in a Bloomberg News survey was for an increase to 50.3.
A reading above 50 indicates expansion.  The U.K. central bank will leave its bond-purchase  target 
at 375 billion pounds, according to the median of 43 estimates
compiled by Bloomberg. Policy makers will keep the key  interest
rate  at a  record-low  0.5 percent, a separate survey of
economists shows.  The 10-year  gilt yield  was little changed at 1.99 percent
after rising to 2.06 percent, the most since March 8. The price
of the 1.75 percent bond due in September 2022 was at 97.975.  Trading in U.K. gilt futures rose to a record last month.
Volumes of the so-called front contracts on the NYSE Liffe
exchange in London climbed to 4.19 million, the most since
Bloomberg started collecting the data in 1982. Futures allow
investors to bet on the value of an underlying security at a
fixed point in time.  U.K. gilts lost 2.8 percent last month, according to the
 Bloomberg British Sovereign Bond Index. (BRIT)  German bonds dropped 1.5
percent and U.S. Treasuries declined 1.9 percent, separate
indexes show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
