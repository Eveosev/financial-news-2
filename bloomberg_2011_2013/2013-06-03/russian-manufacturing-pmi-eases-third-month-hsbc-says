Russian manufacturing weakened for a
third month in May as output growth slowed and companies cut
jobs, according to HSBC Holdings Plc.  The HSBC Purchasing Manager’s Index fell to 50.4 last month
from 50.6 in April, HSBC said in an e-mailed  statement , citing
data compiled by London-based Markit Economics. That matched the
median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of six economists.
Readings above 50 indicate expansion.  Stagnant manufacturing suggests sluggish growth is
extending into the second quarter after the economy of the
world’s biggest energy exporter expanded in the first three
months at the weakest pace since a contraction ended in 2009.
The figures add to April data showing industrial-output growth
slowed and retail sales rose less than economists estimated as a
recession deepened in  Europe ,  Russia ’s biggest trading partner.  “Manufacturing has continued gradually losing growth
momentum,”  Alexander Morozov , chief economist for Russia at
HSBC in Moscow, said in the statement. “Intakes of new orders
were getting weaker, laying down the ground for preservation of
conservative business expectations and restrained output
growth.”  The  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  of 50 stocks fell 1.5 percent to 1,329.62
as of 10:14 a.m. in Moscow. A close at that level would be the
weakest since June 6, 2012. The ruble weakened for a sixth day
against the dollar, tumbling 0.3 percent to 32.0450.  Manufacturers cut jobs in Russia for a seventh month, as
output growth slowed to a “fractional rate” in May, according
to HSBC.  To contact the reporter on this story:
