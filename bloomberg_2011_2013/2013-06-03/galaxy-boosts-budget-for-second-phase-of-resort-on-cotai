Galaxy Entertainment Group Ltd. (27) , the
Macau casino operator founded by billionaire Lui Che Woo, said
it will boost the budget for the second construction phase of
its Cotai resort by HK$3.6 billion ($464 million).  The company is increasing the phase 2 budget for the Galaxy
Macau to HK$19.6 billion from HK$16 billion as it fine tunes
plans, Deputy Chairman Francis Lui told reporters in Hong Kong
today.  Galaxy is  competing  with companies such as  Sands China Ltd. (1928) 
to expand in Cotai, Asia’s equivalent of the Las Vegas strip. It
agreed to buy the Grand Waldo casino hotel in the increasingly
popular area last month to widen its footprint there as new
attractions, hotel rooms and an improved rail connection are
drawing more mainland Chinese visitors to the world’s biggest
gambling hub.  Casino revenue in Macau, the only place in  China  where
casino gambling is legal, rose 14 percent to a record of 304
billion patacas ($38 billion) in 2012.  Galaxy had HK$14.4 billion of cash, cash equivalents and
short-term investments as of Dec. 31, according to  data  compiled
by Bloomberg. The casino operator said on May 5 that it will pay
HK$3.25 billion for Grand Waldo which includes a spa, casino and
hotel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
