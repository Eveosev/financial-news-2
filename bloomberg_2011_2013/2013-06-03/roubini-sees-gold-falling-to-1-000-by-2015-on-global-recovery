Gold may fall toward $1,000 an ounce
by 2015 as the economic recovery curbs demand for bullion that
rallied the past 12 years, said  Nouriel Roubini , professor of
economics and international business at  New York  University.  A lack of inflation and better returns from other assets
such as equities are two of six reasons why prices will trend
lower, according to an article written by Roubini and published
June 1 on the commentary website  Project Syndicate . The metal
fell 16 percent to $1,403.62 in  London  this year and is trading
27 percent below the record $1,921.15 set in September 2011.  Prices that rallied as much as sevenfold since 2000 entered
a  bear market  in April after some investors lost faith in gold
as a store of value. Unprecedented money printing by central
banks to bolster economic growth helped send U.S. equities to
records while failing to spur inflation. This year’s sales from
gold-backed exchange-traded products now exceed additions in the
previous two years amid speculation that the U.S. Federal
Reserve will curb its debt-buying program.  “All investors should have a very modest share of gold in
their portfolios as a hedge against extreme tail risks,” wrote
Roubini, known as Dr. Doom for predicting hard times before the
global financial crisis began in 2008. “Other real assets can
provide a similar hedge, and those tail risks, while not
eliminated, are certainly lower today than at the peak of the
global financial crisis.”  Gold’s Performance  Gold is the second-worst performer this year in the
Standard & Poor’s GSCI gauge of 24 commodities, after silver.
The S&P GSCI fell 3.9 percent since the start of January and the
MSCI All-Country World Index of equities rose 7.7 percent.
Treasuries lost 1.2 percent, a Bank of America Corp. index
shows.  Expectations for increases in consumer prices, as measured
by the break-even  rate  for 10-year Treasury Inflation Protected
Securities, fell 11 percent this year, reaching a 10-month low
on May 30.  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said last month that the pace
of bond purchases could be reduced if the jobless rate keeps
dropping. He also said that ending the central bank’s stimulus
program prematurely could endanger the recovery.  Gold prices may still climb temporarily in the next few
years and will remain volatile, according to the article
published by Project Syndicate. The metal’s 100-day historical
volatility was at 23.2 percent today, up from 10.5 percent in
February, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
