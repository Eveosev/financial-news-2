TDC A/S (TDC)  fell for a fifth day in
 Copenhagen trading , marking its longest losing streak since
February, as Svenska Handelsbanken AB said speculation that  KKR
& Co LP (KKR)  may sell its stake is pushing the stock down.  TDC, Denmark’s biggest phone company,  fell  as much as 1.6
percent to 44.36 kroner, the lowest since April 23. The stock
declined 1.5 percent to 44.44 kroner at 11:03 a.m. in the Danish
capital, with trading volume at 14 percent of the three-month
daily average.  “Rumors and worries are weighing on the share,”
Handelsbanken said today in a note to clients. A KKR sale “will
create massive short-term pressure and push the TDC stocks in
the short term.”  KKR, led by billionaires Henry Kravis and  George Roberts ,
is the last of the five private-equity firms still holding a
stake in the Copenhagen-based phone company after a 2005
takeover, according to TDC’s website. KKR holds about 11
percent, Handelsbanken said.  Handelsbanken maintained its accumulate recommendation and
a target price of 48 kroner. The bank said it expects shares to
recuperate following a pattern seen after Permira Advisers LLP,
Providence Equity Partners Inc., Apax Partners LLP and
Blackstone Group LP sold stakes.  Of the 30  analysts  tracking TDC, 14 recommend clients to
buy the shares. Ten are neutral while six advises selling.  To contact the reporter on this story:
