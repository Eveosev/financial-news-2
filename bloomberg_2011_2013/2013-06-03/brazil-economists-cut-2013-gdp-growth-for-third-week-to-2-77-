  Brazil  economists cut their 2013
economic growth forecast for the third consecutive week after
the central bank accelerated the pace of monetary tightening.  Gross domestic product will expand 2.77 percent this year
from the previous week’s forecast of 2.93 percent, according to
a May 31 central bank survey of about 100 economists published
today. That compares with the central bank’s forecast of 3.1
percent growth. Analysts also cut their 2014 growth outlook to
3.4 percent from 3.5 percent previously.  The slower growth forecast follows a weaker-than-projected
GDP expansion in the first quarter and the central bank’s 50
basis point increase of its  benchmark Selic rate  on May 29.
 Latin America ’s largest economy has been struggling to recover
from a two-year slowdown as inflation has helped erode a decade-long consumption boom and manufacturers lost ground to cheaper
foreign rivals.  Economists increased their 2013 year-end benchmark interest
rate forecast to 8.5 percent from 8.25 percent, as they see
policy makers intensifying the monetary tightening cycle. The
central bank will hold the rate at 8.5 percent through the end
of 2014, the survey showed.  President  Dilma Rousseff ’s administration is seeking to
cool inflation without sacrificing economic growth. Still,
analysts today raised their 12-month inflation forecast to 5.67
percent from last week’s 5.66 percent. Consumer prices will
increase by 5.8 percent this year from a previous forecast of
5.81 percent.  Brazil’s annual inflation through mid-May reached 6.46
percent. The central bank targets annual inflation at 4.5
percent, plus or minus two percentage points. Economists kept
their 2014 inflation forecast at 5.8 percent for 2014.  GDP expanded 0.55 percent in the first quarter, less than
the 0.9 percent median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of 45
economists.  To contact the reporter on this story:
