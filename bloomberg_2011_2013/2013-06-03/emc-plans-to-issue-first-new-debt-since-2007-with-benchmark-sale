EMC Corp. (EMC) , the world’s biggest maker
of storage computers, sold $5.5 billion of bonds in its first
offering since 2007.  EMC issued $2.5 billion of 1.875 percent, five-year notes
that yield 85 basis points more than similar-maturity
Treasuries, $2 billion of 2.65 percent, seven-year securities
with a 115 basis-point spread and $1 billion of 3.375 percent
bonds due 2023 that pay an extra 125, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  The spread on the 10-year securities is wider than an
initial estimate of between 115 basis points and 120 basis
points made earlier today by a person with knowledge of the
transaction who asked not to be identified, citing lack of
authorization to speak publicly.  Proceeds will be used to repay its $1.71 billion of 1.75
percent convertible debt maturing in December, as well as to
fund general corporate purposes including stock buybacks,
Hopkinton, Massachusetts-based EMC said today in a regulatory
filing.  The new bonds are EMC’s first since issuing the
convertibles in February 2007, Bloomberg data show. Those
securities, which EMC can repay with cash or common stock at a
conversion price of $16.08 per share, ended last week at 155.2
cents on the dollar, according to Trace, the bond-price
reporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.
EMC  shares  closed at $24.74.  To contact the reporter on this story:
