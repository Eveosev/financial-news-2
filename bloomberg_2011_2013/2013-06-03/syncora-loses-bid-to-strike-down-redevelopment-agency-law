Syncora Guarantee Inc.’s claims that
a  California  law diverting redevelopment agency funds to the
state jeopardizes bond payments are premature, a state judge
ruled, saying no redevelopment agency bonds are in default.  Judge Michael Kenny in Sacramento denied bond insurer
Syncora any relief on claims in a lawsuit it filed last year
that bond contracts were impaired by a California law that
abolished redevelopment agencies and channeled their funds
toward education, road and fire departments.  Four hundred redevelopment agencies in California were
dissolved under the law, passed to avoid a shortfall in money
for schools and other projects. Taxes going to the agencies were
blended in caretaker funds run by local governments that pay
investors.  Syncora claimed that the contracts  irrevocably pledged  tax
revenue  to bondholders. More than $11 billion in redevelopment
agency bonds were cut to junk status because of uncertainty
about repayment caused by the law, company lawyers said in court
filings.  Kenny ruled that Syncora could present evidence that it’s
suffering damages and losses even though no bonds have
defaulted.  Michael Corbally, a spokesman for Bermuda-based  Syncora
Holdings Ltd. (SYCRF) , parent of Syncora Guarantee, didn’t immediately
respond to an e-mail seeking comment on the ruling after regular
business hours.  The case is Syncora Guarantee Inc. v. State of California,
2-80001215, California Superior Court, Sacramento.  To contact the reporter on this story:
