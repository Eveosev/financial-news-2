General Motors Co. (GM)  will replace H.J.
Heinz Co. in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index after the close of
trading on June 6, S&P said in a statement today.  The automaker is rejoining the S&P 500 after it was dropped
following the company’s bankruptcy in June 2009. Heinz is being
taken private by Warren Buffett’s  Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A)  and
 Jorge Paulo Lemann ’s 3G Capital in a $23 billion buyout.  “The GM team has been working very hard to earn the
business of customers around the world and to win the confidence
of investors, and rejoining the S&P 500 shows we’re very much on
track,” Chief Executive Officer Dan Akerson said in an e-mail.  The revisions in the S&P 500 may prompt money managers to
shift holdings to match the index. About $5.58 trillion is
benchmarked to the gauge, according to S&P’s website.  American International Group Inc. will take the spot of
 Baker Hughes Inc. (BHI)  in the S&P 100, the index provider said in a
statement. Detroit-based GM will also become part of the S&P
100, the statement said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
