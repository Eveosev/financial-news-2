The  Lululemon Athletica Inc. (LULU)  yoga pants that revealed more than muscle tone are back.  The company is restocking its Luon black yoga pants in stores and online this month after they were pulled in March for being too sheer, Lululemon said yesterday in a  note  on its website. The company raised the standards of the Luon fabric and put the material through 15 tests of specific components including colorfastness and burst strength, the Vancouver-based company said in the statement.  Lululemon could see a surge in sales as consumers act on pent-up demand for the pants, which are central to the brand, Camilo Lyon, a New York-based analyst for Canaccord Genuity Corp., said yesterday in an interview.  “This is a core product of theirs, and if there’s an ability for the product to be purchased, it will be,” said Lyon, who has a buy rating on the stock. “They needed to make sure the communication with the consumer was perfect, and for the most part they did a good job.”  The company disclosed on March 18 that some of the Luon garments didn’t meet its standards because they became too sheer when wearers bent over. Lululemon offered full refunds or exchanges to customers who bought the pants after March 1. The issue was a potential blow to the retailer, which is able to sell yoga pants for $98 and tank tops for $64 because of its carefully cultivated reputation for quality.  Pants Educators  Customers buying a new pair of the yoga pants can consult an “educator” to be sure their pants are the correct size and “perform the way they were intended,” according to yesterday’s statement. Lululemon has adjusted the shape of the garment pattern to ensure the pants won’t stretch beyond their ability while still fitting the body.  “We know that our guests want their Wunder Unders to be form fitting, and provide the appropriate amount of coverage,” the statement said. “Maintaining the integrity of the style and fit is a big priority for us, and making sure that our guests are in the right size pant is an important part of the equation.”  Lululemon  rose  1.5 percent to $80.48 in New York at the close. The stock has added 5.6 percent this year, compared with a 19 percent gain for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Retailing Index.  The retailer said it expects to lose $57 million to $67 million in sales from the recall. Lyon estimated a loss of $45 million in an April note to clients. The recall of the black Luon garment, which accounted for about 17 percent of all women’s pants the company sells, caused Lululemon to forecast profit this year that was less than analysts estimated, sending the shares to their biggest decline in two months.  The company reports first-quarter results June 10. Adjusted profit in the period will be about 30 cents per share, according to the average of 25 analysts’  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  ‘Incredible Publicity’  “The incredible publicity from the media actually helped them -- they spent exactly $0 on all that advertising,” Lyon said. “What we saw was an uptick in traffic into the stores right around the recall. When you have more traffic in your stores, even if you don’t have core pant in stock, chances are that that consumer is going to buy something else.”  Lululemon, with more than 200 locations, has been expanding into men’s and girls’ active-wear and opening more stores internationally.  The recall led the company to restructure its internal product-testing protocols. Lululemon’s Chief Product Officer Sheree Waterson stepped down on April 15, and the company said it was assessing all of its Luon garments in production and stationing company employees in factories to monitor manufacturing.
