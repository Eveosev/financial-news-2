Sampo Oyj (SAMAS)  fell to its lowest price in
almost a month in Helsinki after Danske Bank A/S said the owner
of the Nordic region’s largest property and casualty insurer
isn’t paying enough dividends to justify its stock price.  Sampo fell as much as 1.4 percent to 31.05 euros, the
lowest price since May 8. The stock declined 0.9 percent at 1:16
p.m. in the Finnish capital with trading volume at 16 percent of
the three-month average.  Sampo, which owns Solna, Sweden-based insurer If, has
traded above its average 12-month  price estimate  all year,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The Finnish company
failed to provide new insights to merit the premium at its
capital markets day in  London  last week, Danske Bank said in a
note to clients today.  The meeting’s “key message was that Sampo is a dividend
stock - the challenge is that it does not deliver an attractive
yield versus its peers,” Danske said. “The event didn’t
provide us with any news and we continue to view Sampo as
overvalued.” The bank reiterated its recommendation to sell,
which it has had for more than two years.  The Helsinki-based company, which has increased dividend
payments four years straight, has added 28 percent in market
value this year compared with a 7.1 percent gain in the Stoxx
Europe 600 Index. The company will increase dividend payments
next year to 1.4 euros a share from 1.35 euros a share this year
and then keep investor returns unchanged in 2015 and 2016,
according to  Bloomberg dividend projections .  To contact the reporter on this story:
