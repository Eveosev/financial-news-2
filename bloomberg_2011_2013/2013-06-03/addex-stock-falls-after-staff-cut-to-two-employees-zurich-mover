Addex Therapeutics Ltd. (ADXN)  fell the most
in almost two months after the Swiss biotechnology company cut
its staff to two employees.  Addex  stock  declined 11 percent, the biggest intraday fall
since April 17, to 5.75 Swiss francs at 12:32 p.m. in Zurich,
giving the company a market value of about 52 million Swiss
francs ($54 million). More than 88,000 shares exchanged hands,
more than five times the average three-month daily volume.  The company said on May 31 after markets closed that it had
fired 17 of its 19 employees including Chief Executive Officer
Bharatt Chowrira and all executive managers as it aims to
reducing operating costs. Staff is working through their notice
periods and Addex is seeking investment, grants and partners to
advance its pipeline and technology platform assets, the Geneva-based company said in a statement.  “In the coming months, we will work diligently to secure
the resources necessary to advance our pipeline and monetize our
assets to capture potential upside for our shareholders,”
Chairman Andre J. Mueller said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
