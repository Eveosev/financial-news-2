SSE Plc (SSE) , the U.K.’s second-biggest
energy supplier, and Forth Ports Ltd. won Scottish government
approval to build a 465 million-pound ($710 million) plant to
generate electricity and heat from wood.  The facility in the Port of Grangemouth, central  Scotland ,
will be the largest of its kind in the country, Forth Energy, a
joint venture between SSE and Forth Ports, said in a  statement 
on its website. It will have capacity of 120 megawatts of power
and 200 megawatts of heat using imported wood.  The project will help Scotland in obtaining a target for
all of its electricity to come from clean sources by 2020, from
about 39 percent now. Only biomass facilities of more than 15
megawatts that produce both electricity as well as heat  are
eligible  for subsidy support from the region’s government.  Construction of the plant will take three years and create
about 300 jobs. It’s expected to start working in 2017 and is
forecast to deliver about 26 million pounds of economic growth a
year to the area, according to the statement. Electricity will
be fed into the grid and heat supplied to industry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
