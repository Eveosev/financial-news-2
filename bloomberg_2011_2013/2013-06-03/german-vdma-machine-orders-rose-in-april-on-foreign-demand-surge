German plant and machinery orders
rose for the first time since December as foreign demand showed
signs of recovery, the VDMA machine-makers’ association said.  Orders, adjusted for inflation, climbed 8 percent from a
year ago after falling 4 percent in March, VDMA said in an e-mailed statement today. Orders from abroad jumped 10 percent,
while domestic orders increased 6 percent. In the three months
through April, orders rose 1 percent compared to a year earlier.  European Central Bank President Mario Draghi today said he
sees signs of stabilization in the economy even as unemployment
in the 17-nation euro area rose to a record in April and
recession deepened in the first three months of the year. The
Bundesbank, which in December predicted growth for the German
economy of 0.4 percent this year and 1.9 percent in 2014, will
publish new forecasts next month.  “This is finally a plus after a rather disappointing first
quarter,” VDMA chief economist  Ralph Wiechers  said in the
statement. “In particular, foreign demand gives hope that
customers for machinery are giving up their reluctance to buy.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
