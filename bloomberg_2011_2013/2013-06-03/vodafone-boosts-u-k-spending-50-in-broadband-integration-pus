Vodafone Group Plc (VOD) , the second-largest wireless company, will increase U.K. investment by 50
percent to 900 million pounds ($1.37 billion) as it upgrades its
network for faster speeds and services for businesses.  Vodafone is increasing spending for the fiscal year ending
in March as it prepares to release its faster, fourth-generation
mobile network “by the late summer,” the Newbury, England-based company said in a statement.  The company will use the funds to integrate newly acquired
fixed-line assets from the 1.3 billion-pound deal for Cable &
Wireless Worldwide last year, Vodafone said. The deal increased
the size of Vodafone’s enterprise unit, allowing it to offer
bundles of computer networking and phone services to business
customers, and gave it additional infrastructure to offload
wireless data.  “We’re bringing together the best of mobile and fixed
communications to help our business customers make their
communications work for them,” Vodafone U.K. Chief Executive
Officer Guy Laurence said in the statement. “For consumers,
it’s another important step toward the arrival of our ultra-fast
4G service later this year.”  Vodafone is pursuing a similar strategy across Europe and
has announced network sharing deals with  Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE)  and
 Telefonica SA (TEF)  to give customers in Germany and Spain access to
high-speed  Internet service .  Vodafone fell 1.8 percent to 188.6 pence at 9:17 a.m. in
London trading, paring the gain this year to 22 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
