Gold rallied as an unexpected
contraction in U.S. manufacturing boosted speculation that the
 Federal Reserve  will maintain the pace of its stimulus to
sustain the recovery. Platinum surged the most in eight months.  The  Institute for Supply Management ’s factory index
decreased to 49 in May from the prior month’s 50.7, the Tempe,
Arizona-based group said today. Fifty is the dividing line
between growth and contraction. The median forecast of
economists surveyed by Bloomberg was 51.  “The concern for the precious-metals markets right now is
all about when the Fed will begin tapering stimulus,”  David Meger , the director of metal trading at Vision Financial Markets
in Chicago, said in a telephone interview. “Anything that tilts
that expectation one way or the other is going to have a big
impact on gold.”  Gold futures for August delivery gained 1.4 percent to
settle at $1,411.90 an ounce at 1:48 p.m. on the Comex in New
York.  The precious metal earlier fell as much as 0.3 percent
after Fed Bank of San Francisco President  John Williams  said
policy makers may start reducing a bond-purchasing program over
the next three months, curbing demand for the metal as a store
of value.  Bullion slid 16 percent this year as equities rose and on
speculation the Fed may scale back quantitative-easing measures
that helped gold to a 12-year bull run through 2012. Holdings in
exchange-traded products backed by the metal fell to 2,148.2
metric tons on May 31, the lowest since May 2011, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Silver Climbs  Silver futures for July delivery climbed 2.1 percent to
$22.721 an ounce on the Comex, the biggest gain since April 25.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , platinum futures for
July delivery jumped 2.4 percent to $1,497.40 an ounce, the
biggest increase since Sept. 12, 2012, amid concern that
supplies may be disrupted from  South Africa , the world’s largest
producer.  A local organizer for the  National Union of Mineworkers  was
killed and a second wounded in a shooting near  Lonmin Plc (LMI) ’s
Marikana mine in northwestern South Africa, today. Lonmin is the
world’s the third-largest platinum producer.  Palladium futures for September delivery advanced 0.7
percent to $759.05 an ounce. The metal, along with platinum, is
used in jewelry and pollution-control devices in vehicles.  To contact the reporter on this story:
