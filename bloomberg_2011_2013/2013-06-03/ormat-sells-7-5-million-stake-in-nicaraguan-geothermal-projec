Ormat Technologies Inc. (ORA) , a U.S.
renewable-energy developer, sold for $7.5 million its stake in
Momotombo Power Company, a geothermal plant operator in
 Nicaragua , to an undisclosed buyer.  The sum amounts to the earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization the plant will generate through
the remainder of its concession contract which will terminate in
about a year, Reno, Nevada-based Ormat Technologies said today
in a statement.  The 22-megawatt plant sells power to two utilities under a
15-year contract, according to the statement. The company
expects to record a capital gain of about $2.5 million in the
second quarter of 2013 from the sale.  “With the expected expiration of the concession and off
take agreements and the determination that it is unlikely to
extend the concession, we concluded that selling our stake in
the plant early, maximizes the value of the asset,” Dita Bronicki, chief executive officer of Ormat Technologies, said in
the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
