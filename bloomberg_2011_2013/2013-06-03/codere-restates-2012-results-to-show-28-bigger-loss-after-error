Codere SA (CDR) , the Madrid-based gaming
company that has lost more than half its value since February,
restated its 2012 earning to show a 28 percent wider net loss
after detecting accounting errors.  Last year’s net loss was 134 million euros ($175 million)
instead of the 104.7 million-euro loss reported Feb. 28, Codere
said in a  regulatory filing  yesterday.  One of the errors related to the 2007 acquisition of a 49
percent stake in  Mexico ’s ICELA and was detected following an
enquiry from  Spain ’s market regulator, the company said. Last
year, Codere sold bonds to help finance the purchase of 36
percent more of ICELA, owner of Mexican racetrack Hipodromo de
Las Americas, bringing its stake to 85 percent.  Investors have dumped Codere’s stock over the past three
weeks after its losses increased in first quarter and the El
Confidencial website reported the company was considering
defaulting on a  credit line  which comes due this month. Moody’s
Investors Service, which last month cut Codere’s credit rating
to Caa3, nine steps below investment grade, said the company
will probably have to restructure debt because its  capital
structure  is “unsustainable.”  Italo Durazzo, a Codere spokesman, said last month the
company had never indicated that it was considering defaulting.  The change in the 2012 earnings doesn’t affect Codere’s
cash position, the company said yesterday. Codere had 103
million euros of cash on its balance sheet at the end of the
first quarter, up from 85 million euros three months earlier,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Codere has dropped 9.8 percent to 1.85 euros a share since
May 14, driving the market value to 101.8 million euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
