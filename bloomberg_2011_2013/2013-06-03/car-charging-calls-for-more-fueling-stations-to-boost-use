Car Charging Group Inc. (CCGI) , the operator
of 1,100 charging stations across the U.S., said a lack of such
facilities is the “biggest hole” in the electric-vehicle
market and millions more are needed.  “This is a chicken and egg situation -- you need
infrastructure for people to feel comfortable enough to buy
these cars,” Chief Executive Officer Michael Farkas said in a
Bloomberg Television interview with  Tom Keene  and Scarlet Fu.  Car Charging, based in Miami Beach, Florida, and U.S. peers
ChargePoint Inc. and  Ecotality Inc. (ECTY)  are helping drive a nascent
public charging system in places such as store parking lots. The
plea for more stations echoes  Tesla Motors Inc. (TSLA) ’s view that a
wider network is needed to boost electric vehicle, or EV, use.  “The biggest hole in the whole EV market is the
infrastructure -- being able to charge that car once you’re
beyond your home,” Farkas said today.  Car Charging, which has already bought three competitors
and is looking to expand further, is focusing on urban areas
where not everyone has their own garage. “It’s not only serving
people who have single family homes,” he said. Charging must be
provided “where you live, work or play.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
