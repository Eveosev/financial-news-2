The British Bankers’ Association
ceased quoting Libor for eight maturities and stopped all quotes
for two currencies, in line with its plan to cut the number of
benchmarks following the rate-rigging scandal.  The London-based lobby group ceased publishing Libor for
the Canadian and Australian dollars at the end of last month,
according to its website. It discontinued maturities such as the
two-week, five-month and 11-month tenors for all remaining
currencies. That brings the number of quoted rates to 37,
according to the BBA. Rebecca Park, a spokeswoman for the BBA,
declined to comment on the process, first announced in November.  The move follows a regulator’s review of the London
interbank offered rate after  Barclays Plc (BARC)  was fined a record 290
million pounds ($445 million) last year for rigging the
benchmark. Martin Wheatley, a managing director at the Financial
Services Authority, recommended cutting the number of quoted
rates to as few as 20 from 150, because the lack of trades in
some currencies and maturities makes it almost impossible for
the banks that contribute to the rate to state their borrowing
costs accurately.  Libor is calculated by a poll carried out daily by Thomson
Reuters Corp. on behalf of the BBA that asks firms to estimate
how much it would cost to borrow from each other for different
periods and in different currencies. The top and bottom
quartiles of quotes are excluded, and those left are averaged
and published for individual currencies before noon in  London .  To contact the reporter on this story:
