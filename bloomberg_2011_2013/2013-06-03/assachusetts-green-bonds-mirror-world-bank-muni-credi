Massachusetts , taking a cue from the
 World Bank , is selling $100 million in debt called Green Bonds,
saying it’s the first U.S. state to issue such securities to
fund environmental projects.  The tax-exempt general obligations are modeled after ones
from the Washington-based development lender, which has sold
more than $3 billion in green securities since 2008 to help
combat climate change. Endowments and pension funds that are
required to invest in environmental ventures may be attracted to
the issue, state Treasurer Steven Grossman said. Proceeds of
this week’s sale will be used for improving  energy efficiency  in
state buildings, river revitalization and land acquisition,
according to bond documents.  “Since we are engaged in a whole series of green projects,
why not let people invest directly in those projects and allow
people to have a new asset choice,” Grossman, a 67-year-old
Democrat, said by telephone from  Boston .  The Green Bonds will be part of a $1.1 billion general-obligation issue that also includes $640.3 million for refunding
debt. The state has $18.9 billion in general obligations,
according to securities documents.  Moody’s Investors Service rates the new issue Aa1, second-highest. Debt from Massachusetts borrowers was the worst
performer among the 27 states in  Standard & Poor’s  municipal
indexes, losing 0.19 percent through May 30, compared with a
return of 0.56 percent for the $3.7 trillion market.  To contact the reporter on this story:
