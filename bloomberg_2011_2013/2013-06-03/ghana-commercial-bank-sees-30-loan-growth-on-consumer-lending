Ghana  Commercial Bank Ltd., the
nation’s biggest bank by branches, plans to increase lending by
30 percent this year as it focuses on loans to consumers.  “Our  consumer banking  is doing very well,” Simon Dornoo,
managing director at the bank, said in an interview in the
capital, Accra, on May 31. “We are pushing investments into
personal loans because we see growth coming from that area.”  Ghana’s economy, the second-biggest in West Africa after
 Nigeria , is forecast by the government to expand 8 percent this
year, faster than the 5.3 percent average growth in sub-Saharan
Africa estimated by the  International Monetary Fund .  Ghana Commercial Bank’s net income jumped to 143 million
cedis ($71.5 million) in 2012 from 18 million cedis in the year-earlier period, the bank said in March. Lending rose 78 percent
to 847.9 million cedis.  “We are on course with our plans to deliver a good
performance,” Dornoo said, declining to give a forecast for
profit. “After expanding the loan book at that rate last year,
we want to go more gradually this year.”  Shares of the company, which have risen 143 percent this
year, were unchanged at 5.1 cedis as of 11:52 a.m. in Accra.
That compares with the 57 percent gain in the 35-member  Ghana
Stock Exchange Composite Index. (GGSECI)   To contact the reporters on this story:
