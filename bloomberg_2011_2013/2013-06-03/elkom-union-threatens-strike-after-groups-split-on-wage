The largest labor union at  Telkom SA
SOC Ltd. (TKG) , Africa’s biggest fixed-line operator, plans to go on
strike if its demand for an 11.5 percent pay increase isn’t met,
the Communications Workers Union said.  “We only expect them to give us what we deserve,” CWU
spokesman Matankana Mothapo, who says the group represents about
10,000 Telkom workers, said by mobile phone today.  The company, based in  Pretoria , will meet with unions
tomorrow after offering to raise wages by 6 percent. The
Solidarity union has asked for an 8.8 percent increase, while
the South African Communications Union is considering the Telkom
offer, according to spokesman Karriem Abrahams.  Inflation in Africa’s biggest economy was unchanged at 5.9
percent in April, according to the statistics agency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
