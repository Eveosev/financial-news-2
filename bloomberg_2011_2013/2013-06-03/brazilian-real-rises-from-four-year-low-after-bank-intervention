Brazil ’s real climbed from its
weakest level in four years after the central bank intervened
last week for the first time since March.  The real appreciated 0.3 percent to 2.1351 per  U.S. dollar 
at 10:26 a.m. in Sao Paulo after closing on May 31 at 2.1411,
its weakest level since May 2009. Swap rates on the contract due
in January 2015 rose five basis points, or 0.05 percentage
point, to 8.99 percent today.  “We had a strong dollar rally abroad and the market is
having a bit of relief,” Flavia Cattan-Naslausky, a markets
strategist at Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc, said in a
telephone interview from Stamford,  Connecticut . “There’s not a
scarcity of dollars in Brazil. For this reason, there wasn’t
huge demand for the  currency swap .”  The central bank sold 17,600 out of 30,000 currency swap
contracts worth $877 million on May 31 to stem the real’s
decline in its first intervention in the foreign-exchange market
since March 27.  The 14-day relative strength index of the dollar valued in
reais dropped today to 77.9 after increasing to 85 on May 31,
the highest level since May 2012. A level above 70 implies that
the U.S. currency will reverse its rally.  The real rose today along with most of the dollar’s major
counterparts after tumbling 6.5 percent in May, the biggest
monthly decline since September 2011.  To contact the reporters on this story:
