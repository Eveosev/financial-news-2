Steel reinforcement-bar futures in
 Shanghai  rose for the first time in six days after  China ’s
official manufacturing index unexpectedly accelerated in May.  Rebar for delivery in October on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange rose as much as 1.9 percent to 3,480  yuan  ($568) a
metric ton and was at 3,450 at 10:15 a.m. local time. Futures
fell for a fourth month in May, dropping 5.1 percent.  A  Purchasing Managers ’ Index rose to 50.8 from 50.6 in
April, the National Bureau of Statistics and China Federation of
Logistics and Purchasing said on June 1. That was higher than
all estimates in a Bloomberg News survey of 30 analysts and
compares with the median projection of 50, which marks the
dividing line between expansion and contraction.  “Rebar’s rally today is a response to the better-than-expected economic number,” Xia Caijun, an analyst at GF Futures
Co., said by phone from Guangzhou today.  A separate gauge released today by HSBC Holdings Plc and
Markit Economics showed a reading of 49.2, compared with a
preliminary reading of 49.6 on May 23.  Iron ore  for immediate delivery at the Tianjin port in
China fell 1.1 percent to $110.40 a dry ton on May 31, the
lowest since October, according to the Steel Index Ltd.  Iron ore prices will be supported around $110 a ton on
expectations the market balance will remain tight over the next
18 months, CIMB Group Holdings Bhd said in a May 31 report.  The average  spot price  for rebar fell 0.4 percent to 3,469
yuan a ton on May 31, the lowest since September, according to
data from Beijing Antaike Information Development Co.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
