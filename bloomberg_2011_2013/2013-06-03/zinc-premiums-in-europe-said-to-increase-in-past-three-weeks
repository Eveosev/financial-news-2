Premiums for zinc in northern  Europe 
rose in the past three weeks, according to four people who trade
the metal.  The surcharge is about $145 a metric ton, based on the
median of midpoints from the ranges given by the people, who
asked not to be identified because they arenâ€™t authorized to
speak to the media. That compares with $137.50 as of May 10 and
$120 by March 22.  The premium is added to the price of metal for immediate
delivery on the London Metal Exchange and is for special high-grade zinc loaded in Rotterdam. Premiums ranged from $135 to
$150 a ton, according to the people, compared with $120 to $150
at the beginning of May, $105 to $130 at the end of March and
$100 to $120 in early February.  One person gave a range of $140 to $145 a ton, while two
quoted a range of $145 to $150 and one said $135. Premiums rose
in northern Europe as some traders were shipping zinc from the
region to southern Europe to take advantage of higher prices,
the people said. The surcharge in  Italy  was cited at $210 to
$230 by one person and $220 to $230 by another.  The traders also cited limited spot availability of the
metal and increased demand from  Asia .  To contact the reporter on this story:
