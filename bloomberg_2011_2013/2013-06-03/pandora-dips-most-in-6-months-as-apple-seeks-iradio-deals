Pandora Inc. (P) , the biggest online
radio provider, fell the most in almost six months after CNET
and the New York Times reported  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  aims to unveil a
competing service as early as next week.  Pandora  fell  11 percent to $15.22 at the close in New York,
the biggest one-day decline since Dec. 5. The Oakland,
California-based company’s stock had almost doubled this year
through May 31.  Apple is pressing to sign music licensing deals in time to
announce the service at its annual developer conference starting
June 10 in  San Francisco , The New York Times reported yesterday,
citing people briefed on the matter. CNET yesterday reported
Apple had reached agreements with  Warner Music  and its
publishing arm.  The service, called iRadio, has clinched deals with
Universal Music Group’s record labels, though not for its music-publishing rights, the newspaper reported. The Times also
reported Cupertino, California-based Apple’s pact with Warner
Music, citing people who spoke anonymously.  Record labels and music publishers have been seeking higher
royalty rates and guaranteed minimum payments, the Times said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
