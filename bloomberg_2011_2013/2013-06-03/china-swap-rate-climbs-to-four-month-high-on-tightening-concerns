China’s one-year  interest-rate swaps 
climbed to the highest level in more than four months after a
report showing a jump in new home prices fueled speculation the
central bank will reduce cash in the financial system.  Property prices surged 6.9 percent in May from a year
earlier to 10,180  yuan  ($1,659) per square meter (10.76 square
feet),  SouFun Holdings Ltd. (SFUN) , China’s biggest real estate website
owner, said in a statement today after a survey of 100 cities.
That’s the biggest increase since they reversed declines in
December. The People’s Bank of China drained a net 17 billion
yuan of funds last week, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  “Rising property prices are definitely a concern,” said
 Frances Cheung , a strategist at Credit Agricole CIB in Hong
Kong. “People in the market think the central bank may have to
drain liquidity to control prices.”  The one-year swap contract, the fixed cost needed to
receive the floating seven-day repurchase rate, climbed three
basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 3.34 percent as of
10:45 a.m. in Shanghai, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
That matched the level reached on Jan. 15.  The seven-day  repurchase rate , which measures interbank
funding availability, slipped 17 basis points to 4.63 percent,
according to a weighted average rate compiled by the National
Interbank Funding Center. It reached 4.81 percent on May 31, the
highest level since April 25.  The yield on the 2.62 percent government bond due April
2014 dropped one basis point to 2.88 percent, according to the
Interbank Funding Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
