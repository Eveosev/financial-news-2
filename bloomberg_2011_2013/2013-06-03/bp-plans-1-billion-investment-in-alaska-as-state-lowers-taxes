BP Plc (BP/)  will add $1 billion to Alaska
investment after the state changed its oil tax policy in April.  Europe’s second-biggest oil company will increase drilling,
upgrade activities and add 200 jobs in the state, BP said in a
statement today. The London-based company will also start
evaluating an additional $3 billion in new development projects
with companies.  Alaska Governor Sean Parnell and the state legislature
lowered effective oil tax rates with a bill passed April 16. The
state now taxes profits at a flat 35 percent and eliminated a
system in which taxes rose as high as 75 percent when oil prices
went up.  “With this new tax law, the  Alaska  legislature and
Governor Parnell have taken an important step toward improving
Alaska’s long-term economic future,” said Janet Weiss, head of
BP in Alaska. “Our announcement today should make abundantly
clear that BP is committed to being a part of that future.”  BP-operated fields account for two-thirds of Alaska’s
production and include Prudhoe Bay, the largest oilfield in
North America, BP said. The company employs 2,300 people in the
state.  To contact the reporter on this story:
