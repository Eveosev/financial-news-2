Executives at  ATP Oil & Gas Corp. (ATPAQ) ,
the bankrupt energy producer that was auctioned last month to
lenders led by  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) , were sued by Macquarie
Investments LLC for about $32 million.  Sydney-based Macquarie accused ATP executives including
Chief Financial Officer Albert Reese Jr. and board chairman T.
Paul Bulmahn of misrepresenting Macquarie’s $110 million
purchase of royalty interests from ATP, deeming the transaction
to be a “disguised” loan that breached the defunct firm’s
agreements with lenders. The executives “caused ATP” to take
that position, injuring Macquarie, according to the lawsuit
filed May 31 in federal court in Texas.  Macquarie has been “injured as a result of their reliance
on the intentional misrepresentations and fraudulent inducements
by ATP and the management team,” it said in the lawsuit.  Reese didn’t immediately respond to an e-mail seeking
comment
on the suit. Bulmahn couldn’t be reached through a call to ATP,
whose offices were closed.  ATP, based in Houston, filed for bankruptcy last year,
blaming the 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster and the subsequent
drilling moratorium in the  Gulf of Mexico . Macquarie sued the
company in August over royalties claims as well.  The bankruptcy case is In re ATP Oil & Gas Corp., 12-36187,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of Texas (Houston).  To contact the reporter on this story:
