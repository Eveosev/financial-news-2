The Markit Economics final  index  of
U.S. manufacturing increased to 52.3 in May from 52.1 a month
earlier, the London-based group said today.  A reading greater than 50 for the purchasing managers’
measure indicates expansion. The median forecast in a Bloomberg
survey of 10 economists was 52, with estimates ranging from 51.5
to 52.5. The preliminary reading was 51.9.  Markit’s purchasers figure is based on replies from about
85 percent to 90 percent of companies in a poll of more than 600
American manufacturers.  Euro-area manufacturing output contracted less than
initially estimated in May and a U.K. factory index surged,
other reports showed today.  A gauge of manufacturing in the 17-nation euro area
increased to 48.3 last month from 46.7 in April, Markit
Economics said. That’s above an initial estimate of 47.8 on May
23. The gauge has been lower than 50 since July 2011.  In the U.K., a separate report by Markit and the  Chartered
Institute of Purchasing and Supply  showed a factory index
climbed to a 14-month high of 51.3 from a revised 50.2 in April.  To contact the reporter on this story:
