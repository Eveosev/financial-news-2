time and the fall below 100 yen was the key support and this is
now broken,” said Stan Shamu, a Melbourne-based market
strategist at IG Markets Ltd., a provider of trading services in
currencies, stocks and commodities. “Officials are starting to
worry a little bit. The chances are the  Bank of Japan  is not
going to increase its asset purchases from the current level.
They are in a situation where they need to talk it up.”  The Topix, Japan’s broadest equity gauge, has slumped 14

0.6 percent yesterday, reversing earlier losses, after Federal
Reserve Bank of Atlanta President  Dennis Lockhart  said central-bank officials are committed to record stimulus measures.  “There certainly seems to be an acute fixation on the
timing of any adjustment to the asset purchase program, and I
guess I would just encourage everyone to not lose sight of the
bigger picture,” Lockhart said Bloomberg Television in New
York. “Any adjustment is not a major policy shift. The high
level of accommodation will stay in place.”  The yen rose to 99.60 per dollar as of 8:02 a.m. in Tokyo,
