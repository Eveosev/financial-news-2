West Texas Intermediate crude rose as
the U.S. dollar weakened the most since January against a basket
of major currencies after a report showed U.S. manufacturing
shrank last month.  Crude gained 1.6 percent as the dollar slipped after a
report that  manufacturing  contracted at the fastest pace in four
years, fueling bets that the Federal Reserve will maintain its
pace of stimulus. Oil, which slipped 1.8 percent on May 31, also
gained as a European factory gauge climbed and production was
delayed at a North Sea field.  “Oil is moving with currencies,” said Bill Baruch, a
senior market strategist at commodities trading firm
Iitrader.com in  Chicago . “People are betting that the Fed will
keep its stimulus. Prices are stabilizing after Friday’s drop.”  WTI crude for July delivery gained $1.48 to settle at
$93.45 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The volume
of all futures traded was 13 percent above the 100-day average
for the time of day at 2:42 p.m. The futures ended at $91.97 on
May 31, the lowest settlement since May 1. Prices slid 1.6
percent in May.  Brent oil for July settlement rose $1.67, or 1.7 percent,
to end at $102.06 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe exchange after closing May 31 at the lowest settlement
since May 1. Volume for all contracts was 0.5 percent above the
100-day average. Brent’s premium over WTI rose to $8.61 from the
previous day’s $8.42.  The Dollar Index fell to 82.428 in intraday trading, a
three-week low, and reached 82.64 at 2:57 p.m. The decline was
the largest since Jan. 10. A weaker U.S. currency increases the
appeal of oil as an investment alternative.  Manufacturing Contracts  The Institute for Supply Management’s factory index fell to
49 in May from the prior month’s 50.7, the Tempe, Arizona-based
group’s report showed today. Fifty is the dividing line between
growth and contraction, and last month’s reading was the lowest
since June 2009. The  median  forecast of 81 economists surveyed
by Bloomberg was 51.  Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said on May 22 that the
central bank is trying to assess whether it has seen “real and
sustainable progress in the labor market outlook.” If it has,
the Fed could “take a step down” in its pace of purchases in
the “next few meetings,” he said. The bank has expanded its
balance sheet to a record $3.4 trillion with $85 billion of
asset purchases a month to spur growth and reduce unemployment.  “Bad news is good news,” said Phil Flynn, senior market
analyst at the Price Futures Group in Chicago. “People are
betting that the Fed will keep its plans to stimulate the
economy.”  Equities Gain  Oil also rose with equities. The Dow Jones Industrial
Average rose 0.9 percent today after falling 1.4 percent on May
31. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gained 0.6 percent.  The U.S. used 21 percent of the world’s oil in 2011, more
than any other country, according to  BP Plc (BP/) ’s Statistical Review
of World Energy.  “Oil seems to want to head right back to $94,” said  Gene McGillian , an analyst and broker at Tradition Energy in
 Stamford ,  Connecticut .  Oil also gained as a gauge of manufacturing in the 17-nation euro area increased to 48.3 last month from 46.7 in
April, London-based Markit Economics said today. The gauge has
been below 50, indicating contraction, since July 2011.  “The European data was pretty good,” Flynn said.  Buzzard Field  The Buzzard oil field in the North Sea will resume output
in the middle of this week after equipment failure caused
production to be halted, according to Nexen Inc., the platform’s
operator.  Supply from the 200,000-barrel-a-day Buzzard field accounts
for about half of the Forties crude stream. Forties is one of
four grades that make up Dated Brent, helping set the benchmark
that is used to price more than half of the world’s oil.  “There are some problems at the Buzzard field and we are
probably getting some support,” McGillian said.  JPMorgan cut its forecast for Brent to an average of $113 a
barrel in the third quarter, from $120 previously, according to
a May 31 report received by e-mail today. The bank reduced its
outlook for the three months ended December to $117, from $120,
and for 2014 to $117.50, from $122.50. JPMorgan cited demand
weakness in Europe and  emerging markets  and growing non-OPEC
supply.  Hedge funds reduced bullish crude bets by the most in six
weeks in the week ended May 28, according to the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission’s May 31 Commitments of Traders
report. Money managers cut net-long positions, or  wagers  on
higher prices, by 6.2 percent, the largest drop since the seven
days ended April 16.  Implied volatility for at-the-money WTI options expiring in
July was 23.6 percent, compared with 22.4 percent on May 31,
data compiled by Bloomberg showed.  Electronic trading volume on the Nymex was 569,013
contracts as of 3:04 p.m. It totaled 638,865 contracts on May
31, 8.9 percent above the three-month average. Open interest was
1.74 million contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
