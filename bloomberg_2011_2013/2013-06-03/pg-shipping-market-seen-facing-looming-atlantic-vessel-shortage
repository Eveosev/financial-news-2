The liquefied petroleum gas shipping
market faces a looming vessel shortage in the Atlantic Ocean,
according to  Clarkson Plc (CKN) , the world’s largest shipbroker.  “The situation is becoming potentially dramatic in the
Atlantic and the real issue is whether charterers have fully
grasped this,” London-based Clarkson’s research unit said in a
May 31 report. “Looking at the anticipated requirements out of
West Africa and Houston through June and July, unless ships are
ballasted from Asia, we could very soon see a real shortage.”  Ballasting refers to sailing without cargo, often to get to
regions where rates are higher. Costs for transporting the fuel
or petrochemical feedstock advanced 67 percent to $67.88 a
metric ton this year, according to data from the Baltic Exchange
in London. Demand is rising amid record U.S. exports.  To contact the reporter on this story:
