Mexico’s local bonds yields rose for
a 12th day, the longest losing streak in  two years, on bets the
U.S. Federal Reserve will curtail stimulus and as analysts cut
growth forecasts for  Latin America ’s second-biggest economy.  Yields on peso-denominated debt due in December 2024, known
as Mbonos, climbed one basis points, or 0.01 percentage point,
to 5.47 percent at 9:21 a.m. in Mexico City, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The streak of consecutive yield increases
is the longest since the period ended Nov. 18, 2010. The peso
fell 0.3 percent to 12.8479.  The Mbonos have slumped as U.S. Federal Reserve officials
led by Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said last month the central bank
may cut its pace of debt purchases if officials are confident
that the U.S. recovery will be sustained. Foreign investors had
boosted their holdings of benchmark debt to a record this year
on speculation lawmakers would push through legal changes to
boost tax collection and open the state-controlled  energy
industry  to more private investment.  “The Mbono market is fairly well owned by foreigners and
as such has some vulnerability in times of  risk aversion ,”
Andrew Stanners, a dealer and analyst at Aberdeen Asset
Management Plc, which oversees $12 billion in emerging-market
assets, said in an e-mailed response to questions.  Mexico’s economy will expand by 2.96 percent this year,
according to the median estimate of analysts in a central bank
survey released today. Last month analysts forecast an expansion
of 3.35 percent. The country’s gross domestic product rose 0.8
percent in the first quarter from a year earlier, the slowest
pace since 2009, the government reported May 17.  To contact the reporter on this story:
