Ltd., said by phone from Mumbai. “Weak local as well as global
macros may crimp further overseas fund flows into India.”  Foreigners sold $88 million of local stocks May 31, ending
four days of net purchases, and contributing to the 2.3 percent

a net $15.1 billion of  Indian (SENSEX)  shares in 2013 as easing by global

Concerns about the U.S. authority tapering asset purchases that
have spurred fund flows into emerging markets, including India,
pushed down the rupee to an 11-month low today.  ‘Rupee Concern’  The currency weakened 0.5 percent to 56.7650 at the close.
It earlier touched 56.8250, the weakest level since June 28,
2012. A weaker currency worsens inflation and makes imports
costlier for a nation whose current-account gap is at a record.  “Some uncertainty you are viewing in the market might be
reflective of the” rupee’s move over 56, Sunil Singhania, head
of equities at Reliance Capital Asset Management Ltd., said in
an interview to Bloomberg TV today. “The rupee has not
depreciated to that extent against other currencies, but still
anything above 56 definitely causes a bit of concern.”  The Sensex has risen 1 percent this year and is valued at
13.5 times  projected 12-month profits , higher than the MSCI
Emerging Markets Index’s 10.2 times.  The CNX  Nifty (NIFTY)  Index on the National Stock Exchange of India
