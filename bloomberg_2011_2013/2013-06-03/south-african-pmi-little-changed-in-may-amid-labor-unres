South Africa ’s purchasing managers’
 index  was little changed in May, as growth in its inventory and
employment components countered a drop in new sales orders and
business activity, Kagiso Tiso Holdings said.  The seasonally adjusted index fell to 50.4 from 50.5 in
April, Johannesburg-based  Kagiso  said in an e-mailed statement
today. A number above 50 indicates growth in factory output. The
Bureau for  Economic Research , based at the University of
Stellenbosch near  Cape Town , conducts the PMI survey for Kagiso.  Manufacturing and mining, which account for about 20
percent of the economy, have been weakened by waves of strikes
at mines and slumping demand from  Europe . Gross domestic product
expanded an annualized 0.9 percent in the first quarter, its
slowest pace since a 2009 recession, according to the statistics
agency.  “The outcome of the current round of wage negotiations in
a number of manufacturing sub-sectors will be an important
factor in determining the outlook for employment growth in the
second half of this year,” Abdul Davids, head of research at
Kagiso, said.  The sub-index measuring employment jumped 5.1 points to
47.2, while the inventory index advanced 8 points to 54.7,
Kagiso said. Business activity dropped 1.6 points to 50.6 and
new sales fell 2.6 points to 51.1, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
