GMO Internet Inc. (9449)  rose in Tokyo
trading after Barclays Plc recommended buying the shares as a
bet that growth in use of social-media networks and smartphones
in  Japan  will boost profit.  The Internet-related services provider jumped 3 percent to
1,008 yen as of the close, compared with a 3.4 percent decline
in the broader Topix. The Tokyo-based company earlier rose by as
much as 9.2 percent, the biggest increase since April 22.  GMO Internet, which also provides online securities and
foreign-exchange trading services, introduced a soccer game with
real names and images of top players from around the world last
month that can be played on smartphones. Barclays raised its
rating to “overweight,” the equivalent of buy, from “equal
weight,” citing a steady increase in games revenue.  The “next catalyst is a profit in the games business: The
most likely source of income change is reaching a profit in the
games (social and smartphone) business,” wrote Keiichi Yoneshima and Kenji Wakasa, analysts at Barclays in  Tokyo , in a
note to clients dated May 31.  GMO Internet forecasts a 6.2 percent gain in  net income  to
4.8 billion yen ($48 million) this year, as sales climb 12
percent to 83 billion yen, the Tokyo-based company said May 7.  To contact the reporter on this story:
