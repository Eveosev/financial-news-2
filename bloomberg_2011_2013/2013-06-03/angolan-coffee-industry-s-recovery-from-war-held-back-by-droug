Angola , the world’s third-largest
coffee producer before independence from  Portugal  in 1975, will
produce the same amount of beans this year as in 2012 after a
drought restrained output, the National Coffee Institute said.  The southwest African nation may produce 15,000 metric
tons, Casimiro Cardoso, deputy director of the institute, said
in a May 29 interview in Luanda, the capital. A lack of rain in
southern provinces such as Huila limited crops and forced people
to seek government food aid. Angola’s largest coffee crop was
235,200 tons in 1967, according to data on the website of the
 United Nations ’  Food and Agriculture Organization .  A 27-year civil war that ended in 2002 decimated Angola’s
economy, infrastructure and coffee industry. Subsistence farmers
make up 90 percent of the growers compared with 70 percent in
1975, according to government figures. The country is striving
to diversify its economy, which the  International Monetary Fund 
says depends on oil for 40 percent of its output.  “Angola produced a large quantity of coffee, but now only
families are producing,” Cardoso said. “We need more
investments.”  The roads linking farms to towns aren’t yet being
reconstructed while training and research facilities need to be
rebuilt, Cardoso said.  To boost production, Angola and Thai Hoa Viet Nam Group of
 Vietnam , the world’s biggest grower of the robusta variety used
in espressos and instant coffee, signed a contract in July 2012
to revamp 100,000 hectares (247,105 acres) of plantations within
10 years with the help of a $250 million  credit line  from
 Brazil , state news agency Agencia Angola Press reported in
March.  Growth Project  The United Nations-backed Common Fund for Commodities, or
CFC, is helping families rehabilitate coffee plantations in
Amboim, Kwanza Sul province, Cardoso said. The project that
comprises 13 farmer co-operatives and more than 100 associations
in an area of 4,000 hectares. The CFC lent $2.8 million for the
$8.5 million project, according to the  fund’s website .  “This project is a success story because despite being in
the market for four years only, they managed to sell 2,000 tons
of coffee in the domestic market last year with a ton of coffee
selling for $2,000,” Cardoso said.  The southern African country grows coffee in 10 of its 18
provinces. Robusta coffee for July delivery fell 0.4 percent to
$1,886 per metric ton by 2:04 p.m. on NYSE Liffe in  London .  “Angola has the necessary ecological conditions and human
capital for foreign investors to be successful,” Cardoso said.
“Angolan coffee is well known and appreciated
internationally.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
