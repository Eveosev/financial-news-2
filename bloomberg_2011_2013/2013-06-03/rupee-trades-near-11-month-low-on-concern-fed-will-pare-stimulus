India’s rupee traded within 0.5
percent of an 11-month low on concern the  Federal Reserve  will
scale back asset purchases that have spurred fund flows into
 emerging markets .  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said last month the central
bank may reduce asset purchases if there are signs of sustained
improvement in the world’s largest economy. A report last week
showed U.S.  consumer confidence  at a five-year high. India’s
 economy  expanded less than 5 percent for a second quarter, data
showed on May 31, a day after central bank Governor Duvvuri Subbarao said the nation’s balance of payments is under stress.  “Right now, there is still debate on about the outlook for
policy in India and abroad, and investors will be cautious,”
said Vikas Babu, a trader at state-run  Andhra Bank (ANDB)  in Mumbai.
“We will see exporters selling dollars as well, so there should
be some respite for the rupee.”  The rupee was little changed at 56.5050 per dollar as of
10:30 a.m. in Mumbai, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
It touched 56.76 on May 31, the weakest level since June 28,
2012. One-month implied volatility, a gauge of expected moves in
the  exchange rate  used to price options, fell one basis point,
or 0.01 percentage point, to 9.22 percent.  International investors poured almost $20 billion into
India’s stocks and bonds this year, exchange data show.  Central Bank  The shortfall in India’s current account, the broadest
measure of trade, probably widened to 5 percent of gross
domestic product in the year ended March 31, Subbarao said on
May 30. India’s gross domestic product  increased  4.8 percent in
the three months ended March 31 from a year earlier.  The  Reserve Bank  of India may have sold dollars around the
56.75 per dollar level last week to curb the rupee’s drop, J. Moses Harding, executive vice president at IndusInd Bank Ltd. in
Mumbai, said on May 31. That should encourage exporters to
convert overseas earnings, he said.  Three-month onshore rupee forwards traded at 57.41 per
dollar, compared with 57.42 on May 31, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Offshore non-deliverable contracts were
at 57.44 versus 57.60 a month ago. Forwards are agreements to
buy or sell assets at a set price and date. Non-deliverable
contracts are settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
