Japanese government bonds rose,
climbing from their steepest loss in May in five years, as
domestic shares plunged and the central bank announced its first
debt purchases for this month.  Sovereign debt gained the most in almost two months as the
Topix index sank 3.4 percent to the lowest level since April 5.
Data showed spending at companies on plant and equipment fell
3.9 percent in the first quarter from a year earlier, helping
drive demand for the relative safety of government securities.  “Bonds are being bought as mid- to long-term yields have
started to stabilize,” said  Takafumi Yamawaki , the Tokyo-based
chief rates strategist at JPMorgan Chase & Co., one of the 24
primary dealers obliged to bid at government debt auctions.
“Investors such as mutual funds bought after the BOJ’s buying
operation as risk appetite abates.”  Japan ’s 10-year yields declined 5 1/2 basis points to 0.805
percent as of 4:12 p.m. in  Tokyo , according to Japan Bond
Trading Co. The price of the 0.6 percent note due in March 2023
rose 0.488 yen, or 488 yen per 100,000 yen face amount, to
98.139 yen. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point. The yield
dropped the most since April 4.  The Topix  index  has fallen 14 percent from a 4 1/2-year
high set May 22, based on closing levels.  The BOJ in May announced plans to increase the number of
its monthly government bond purchases after market participants
asked for the move to curb volatility in debt prices. The
central bank said it will buy bonds about 8 to 10 times a month
starting June, compared with 8 purchases previously.  Japanese company spending excluding software fell 5.2
percent in the first quarter from a year earlier, the government
report showed.  Sovereign bonds in the nation dropped 1.2 percent in May,
the most since April 2008, according to Bank of America Merrill
Lynch indexes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
