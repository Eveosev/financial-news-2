McGraw Hill Financial Inc. (MHFI) , owner of
 Standard & Poor’s , offered $334 million to boost its stake in
Indian credit rater  Crisil Ltd. (CRISIL)  to 75 percent, sending Crisil’s
shares soaring by the most in more than eight years.  The Mumbai grader climbed 20 percent to a record 1,129.9
rupees, the biggest daily gain since February 2005. McGraw Hill
is seeking to buy as many as 15.67 million shares of Crisil at
1,210 rupees ($21.37) each, 29 percent more than the stock’s May
31 close, according to a company statement distributed by
PRNewswire.  Crisil competes with  ICRA Ltd. (ICRA) , in which Moody’s Corp.
holds a 28.5 percent stake, to provide ratings to borrowers in
Asia’s third-biggest economy. Crisil’s revenue has increased at
an average rate of 19.3 percent in the last five years, the New
York-based firm said today.  “In 10 years, the rating business will be a booming market
in  India ,” A.K. Prabhakar, senior vice president of equity
research at Mumbai-based Anand Rathi Financial Services Ltd.,
said today. “Financial regulation will be stricter, there will
be more banks and financial products then.”  Shares of McGraw Hill were little changed at $54.65 as of
10:48 a.m. in  New York  trading. The deal would increase the
company’s stake in Crisil from 52.8 percent. The tender offer to
shareholders is expected to start next month and end in August,
according to the statement. McGraw Hill will finance the deal
using cash.  Staying Public  McGraw Hill plans to keep Crisil “a listed, public,
independent company,” Chief Executive Officer Harold “Terry” McGraw III said in the statement. The offer “represents a vote
of confidence in the growth prospects of India and the other
markets that Crisil serves.”  Crisil, India’s  first  credit-rating company, was set up in
1987 by financial institutions including ICICI Ltd. and Unit
Trust of India, according to its website. S&P, the world’s
largest credit rater, bought a controlling stake in Crisil in
2005.  McGraw Hill, which changed its name from McGraw-Hill Cos.
last month, sold its education unit to Apollo Global Management
LLC for $2.4 billion in March.  To contact the reporters on this story:
