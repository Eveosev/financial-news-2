Fairfax Financial Holdings Ltd., the
Canadian insurer led by  Prem Watsa , agreed to buy  American
Safety Insurance Holdings Ltd. (ASI)  for $306 million in an all-cash
deal.  American Safety shareholders will receive $29.25 per share,
a 22 percent premium to the Bermuda-based insurer’s May 31
closing price, Toronto-based Fairfax said in a statement today.
 Tower Group International Ltd. (TWGP)  will buy American Safety’s
reinsurance unit from Fairfax for $59 million once the deal is
completed, Bermuda-based Tower said today in a separate
statement.  The acquisition gives Watsa $480 million of assets to
invest, according to the statement. The 62-year-old chief
executive officer has built the company through acquisitions,
including the $300 million purchase of Brit Insurance Ltd., a
London-based property-and-casualty insurer, in 2012 and a $34
million deal this year for  Hartville Group Inc. (HVLL) , a U.S. pet
insurer.  “We expect to enhance our insurance operations in certain
specialty lines of business with American Safety’s expertise,”
Watsa said in the release.  American Safety gained 21 percent to $28.89 in New York
trading, the most intraday since December 2008. Fairfax declined
declined 0.2 percent to C$418 in Toronto.  The acquisition will be financed using internal resources
and won’t require cash from the holding company, Fairfax said in
the release. The deal is expected to be completed in the fourth
quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
