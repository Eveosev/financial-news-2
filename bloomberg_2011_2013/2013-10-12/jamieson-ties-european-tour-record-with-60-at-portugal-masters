Scott Jamieson of  Scotland  tied the
European Tour record by shooting 60 in today’s third round of
the Portugal Masters.  Jamieson made 11 birdies and no bogeys at Oceanico Victoria
Golf Course in Algarve, missing a 15-foot birdie putt on the
final hole which would have given him a 59. It was the 18th
score of 60 in European Tour history and the second of the
season after Peter Uihlein’s final-round total at last month’s
Dunhill Links Championship.  Jamieson is tied for second place with three other golfers
at 14-under par, two strokes behind leader Paul Waring of
 England . Waring shot 67 today to reach 16 under.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
