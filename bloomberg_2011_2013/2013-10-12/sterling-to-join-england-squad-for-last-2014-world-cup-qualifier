Liverpool striker Raheem Sterling
will join the England soccer squad for its final qualifying
match for the 2014 World Cup, the Football Association said on
its website.  England manager  Roy Hodgson  called Sterling up after Tom
Cleverly was injured before yesterdayâ€™s 4-1 win over Montenegro
and  Kyle Walker  picked up a yellow card which caused his
suspension for the Oct. 15 match against Poland at Wembley
Stadium in London.  England leads Ukraine by a point in its qualifying group
and will claim a place at the World Cup in Brazil by beating
Poland.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
