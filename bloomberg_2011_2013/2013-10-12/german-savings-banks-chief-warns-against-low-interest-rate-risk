Low interest rates for too long risk
undermining  Germany ’s private pension system and damping the
resolve in euro region crisis countries to carry out economic
policy changes, the president of Germany’s association of
savings banks said.  Artificially low interest rates lead to erroneous pricing
of risks and mis-allocation of capital, said Georg Fahrenschon,
head of the DSGV lobby, urging central banks not to wait too
long before returning to higher borrowing costs and setting
incentives for governments to bring spending under control.  “No one should believe that supposedly soft instruments
such as a very low interest rates are risk-free and don’t come
at significant costs,” Fahrenschon said in an e-mailed speech
text for delivery in  Washington . “One can’t fight the problem
of too high debt with even more cheap money.”  The European Central Bank offered in July to keep official
 interest rates  at or below current levels for “an extended
period.” Mario Draghi, the bank’s president, yesterday said the
pledge to keep interest rates low explicitly allows for cuts in
borrowing costs if market volatility resumes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
