China ’s daily oil imports rose to a
record in September as the world’s second-largest economy
expanded and demand for energy grew.  China imported a net 25.61 million metric tons of crude oil
last month, according to figures on the website of the General
Administration of Customs today. That’s equivalent to an average
6.26 million barrels a day, 25 percent more than in August and 2
percent greater than the previous record of 6.13 million barrels
a day in July, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  China may increase its net crude imports to 6.45 million
barrels a day by October, surpassing an estimated 6.23 million
for the U.S., according to a forecast published on Aug. 9 by the
Washington-based Energy Information Administration. A government
report due on Oct. 18 may show that China’s  gross domestic
product  grew 7.8 percent from a year earlier in the third
quarter, according to a Bloomberg News survey of economists.
Growth in the second quarter was 7.5 percent.  Oil imports into China have risen “as a result of
expansion in the economy and its growing demand for resources,”
customs spokesman Zheng Yuesheng said at a briefing in Beijing
today. “It’s hard to predict how much oil China will import in
the future, which will depend on the macro-economy.”  The EIA, the U.S. Energy Department’s statistical arm,
predicted that Chinese net imports will reach 6.57 million
barrels a day next year, with the rate for the U.S. dropping to
5.71 million.  To contact  Bloomberg News  staff for this story:
