Thousands of opposition supporters
demonstrated in Azerbaijan’s capital, Baku, to protest against
the results of the Oct. 9 presidential election, which gave
 Ilham Aliyev  another five-year term.  “The election was stolen from us,” opposition candidate
Camil Hasanli told a crowd in a stadium in Baku’s Yasamal
district. “We demand a repeat election.”  Aliyev, 51, won a third term in office with 84.6 percent of
the votes, according to the Central Electoral Commission.
Hasanli, 61, received 5.5 percent, with eight other candidates
dividing up the remaining votes.  The 57-member Organization for Security and Cooperation in
 Europe  and the U.S. Department of State said the election fell
short of international standards and was marred by serious
shortcomings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
