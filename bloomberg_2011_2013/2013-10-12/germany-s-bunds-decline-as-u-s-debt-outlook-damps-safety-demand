Germany ’s  10-year (USGG10YR)  government bonds
fell for a second week as speculation U.S. lawmakers would reach
an agreement on raising the nation’s debt limit boosted stocks
and curbed demand for the safest fixed-income assets.  The German 10-year  yield  climbed to the highest level in
two weeks as benchmark U.S. Treasury yields also rose amid signs
a U.S. default would be averted.  Spain ’s bonds declined in the
week as the nation sold 4 billion euros ($5.4 billion) of a new
30-year security via banks, its first offering of the maturity
since March. The European Stability Mechanism, the region’s
permanent rescue fund, sold its first bonds on Oct. 8.  “We’ve seen a relief rally on risk markets after the hint
that we might be moving towards a short-term solution in the
U.S.,” said  Nick Stamenkovic , a fixed-income strategist at
broker RIA Capital Markets Ltd. in Edinburgh. “The announcement
of the syndicated  Spanish (GSPG10YR)  auction caught the market by surprise
and Spanish bonds corrected accordingly. We see value in Spanish
bonds.”  Germany’s 10-year bund yield increased two basis points, or
0.02 percentage point, this week to 1.86 percent as of 5 p.m.
London time yesterday after rising to 1.88 percent, the highest
since Sept. 24. The 2 percent security due in August 2023 fell
0.21, or 2.10 euros per 1,000-euro face amount, to 101.21.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index of shares snapped a two-week
decline, adding 0.6 percent.  Debt Ceiling  President  Barack Obama  and House Republican leaders were
moving toward an agreement to extend the nation’s borrowing
authority even as they remained at odds over terms for ending
the partial government shutdown. House Speaker  John Boehner  said
he would offer a measure to postpone a potential U.S. default to
Nov. 22 from Oct. 17, a step back from the brink that was enough
to trigger the biggest rise in U.S. stocks in nine months,
damping demand for core assets.  Benchmark Treasury 10-year note yields reached 2.72 percent
on Oct. 10, the highest since Sept. 23.  Spain is seeking to reverse a shortening in the average
maturity of its debt after the limited  market access  it suffered
during the sovereign-debt crisis made it more attractive to
issue lower-yielding, shorter-dated notes.  The Madrid-based Treasury sold 4 billion euros of 2044
bonds this week at an average yield of 5.213 percent, compared
with a rate of 5.432 percent at an auction of bonds maturing in
2041 in March.  Spanish 10-year yields rose nine basis points in the week
to 4.29 percent. The rate on the nation’s 30-year debt increased
four basis points to 5.06 percent.  The ESM sold 7 billion euros of five-year debt, while  Italy 
allotted 5 billion euros of seven-year bonds via banks.  German Confidence  A report on Oct. 15 will show German investor confidence
remained at the highest level in more than three years this
month, according to the median of 40 economist estimates in a
Bloomberg News survey.  The ZEW Center for European Economic Research in Mannheim
will say its index of investor and analyst expectations, which
aims to predict economic developments six months in advance,
held at 49.6, unchanged from September, which was the highest
level since April 2010.  Germany is scheduled to auction 5 billion euros of two-year
notes on Oct. 16.  France  plans to sell securities due between
2016 and 2040 the following day, when Spain will also offer debt
maturing in 2016 and 2018.  German bonds lost 2 percent this year through Oct. 10,
according to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes. Spanish securities
returned 9.1 percent and Italy’s gained 5.1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
