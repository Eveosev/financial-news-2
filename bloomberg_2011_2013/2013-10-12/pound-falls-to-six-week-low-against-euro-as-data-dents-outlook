The pound fell to a six-week low
against the euro as reports showed industrial and construction
output unexpectedly declined in August, casting doubt on the
strength of the U.K. recovery.  Sterling dropped against the dollar for a second week even
as a separate report showed house prices rose to a record. The
Bank of England kept its benchmark  interest rate  at a record-low
0.5 percent and maintained its bond-buying stimulus  target  at
375 billion pounds ($600 billion) at its latest policy meeting.
Construction slipped 0.1 percent from July compared with a 0.8
percent gain forecast by economists. Gilts were little changed.  “We have a bearish view on the pound as we think the best
of the data is probably behind us,” said Eimear Daly, head of
market analysis at Monex Europe Ltd. in London. “The pound has
come a long way and further gains may be limited.”  Sterling lost 0.4 percent to 85.05 pence per euro at 4:55
p.m. London time yesterday, when it reached 85.10 pence, the
weakest since Sept. 2. The pound slid 0.4 percent to $1.5946. It
fell to $1.5914 on Oct. 10, the lowest since Sept. 18.  The U.K. currency advanced 5.3 percent in the past six
months, the best performer among 10 developed-nation currencies
tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The dollar
rose 1.2 percent and the euro added 5.1 percent.  Industrial Production  U.K. industrial production unexpectedly fell 1.1 percent in
August, the steepest drop in almost a year, the Office for
National Statistics said on Oct. 9. Factory production fell 1.2
percent, while a separate report showed the trade gap narrowed
less than economists forecast in the three months through
August.  U.K.  home values  increased 0.5 percent from August to an
average 235,534 pounds, London-based real-estate researcher
Acadametrics and  LSL Property Services Plc (LSL)  said yesterday.  The Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee, led by
Governor Mark Carney, said in August it would keep interest
rates low until  unemployment , currently at 7.7 percent, falls
below 7 percent.  The 10-year gilt yield was little changed since Oct. 4, at
2.73 percent. The price of the 2.25 percent bond due in
September 2023 was 95.835.  Inflation slowed in September, according to economist
forecasts before the data on Oct. 15. Consumer prices rose 2.6
percent from a year ago in August when they increased 2.7
percent, according to the median forecast of 34 economists in a
Bloomberg News survey.  Gilts lost 3.1 percent this year through Oct. 10, according
to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes. German bonds dropped 2 percent
and U.S. Treasuries declined 2.6 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
