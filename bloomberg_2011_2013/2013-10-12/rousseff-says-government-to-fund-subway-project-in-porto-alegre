President  Dilma Rousseff  said her
government will help fund a subway project in southern  Brazil ,
part of $23 billion dedicated to transportation-spending
projects spurred earlier this year by angry Brazilians.  Rousseff said today the government will contribute 1.8
billion reais ($827.2 million) toward a 4.8 billion reais subway
in the city of Porto Alegre. The government also has earmarked
funds for a 2.6 billion reais subway line in Rio de Janeiro
state, and 5.2 billion reais for a project in  Sao Paulo  which
includes a bus line.  Rousseff first promised the new expenditures in June as she
sought to calm protests that began over a bus-fare increase. The
demonstrations grew in size and scope, with more than 1 million
people participating, and their demands increasing to include
more funding for health care and education, as well as public
transportation, in addition to an end to corruption.  “Brazil didn’t invest in urban mobility in an adequate way
for 30 to 40 years,” Rousseff said in a speech to  Porto
Alegre ’s legislative assembly today.  “The federal government opened up new investment of 50
billon reais following manifestations in June,” she said. “The
pact for urban mobility takes into account that people want
quality public services after Brazil grew frighteningly in
recent years.”  The 11.7-kilometer (7.25-mile) subway project will have two
lines to move 325,000 passengers between 10 stations daily, she
said, without providing further details.  To contact the reporter on this story:
