Real  Madrid  denied a Spanish
newspaper report that Gareth Bale has a slipped disc, saying the
record signing has a slight disc bulge that won’t affect his
ability to play normally.  Madrid sports newspaper  Marca today reported  the problem
was diagnosed when Bale underwent his medical examination at the
club and said the Welsh midfielder may require surgery. Real
refuted the claim in a  statement  on its website.  “The information published, claiming that the player has a
slipped disc on the L5-S1 vertebrae and a bulge on two others,
is completely false,” the club said. “The player Gareth Bale
has a small chronic disc bulge, which is extremely common among
football players and by no means prevents him from carrying out
his professional activity normally.”  Bale has played in only three matches because of injuries
since moving from Tottenham for a reported world-record fee of
about 80 million pounds ($128 million) last month. He scored his
only goal in his first match, a 2-2 draw with Villarreal on
Sept. 14.  To contact the reporter on this story:
