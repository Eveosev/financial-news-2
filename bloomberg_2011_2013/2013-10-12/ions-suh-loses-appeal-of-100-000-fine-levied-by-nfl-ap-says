Detroit Lions defensive tackle
 Ndamukong Suh  lost his appeal of a $100,000 fine, tied for the
largest ever levied by the National Football League for on-field
conduct, the Associated Press said, citing his agent.  Suh, 26, was fined Sept. 10, two days after making an
illegal block on Minnesota Vikings center John Sullivan. An
appeal officer’s decision to uphold the fine was confirmed
yesterday by Roosevelt Barnes, Suh’s agent, AP reported.  The $100,000 fine, the sixth in Suh’s four-year career, was
matched by a similar fine given Sept. 18 to Tampa Bay Buccaneers
safety Dashon Goldson.  Suh also has been suspended for two games during his NFL
career.  To contact the reporter on this story:
