The largest developing nations are
concerned that the impasse among U.S. lawmakers about raising
the country’s debt limit and capital market volatility may slow
the global economy,  China  said, citing discussions during the
meeting of BRICS nations in Washington.  BRICS nations, which include Brazil, Russia, India, China
and  South Africa , urged global policy makers to enhance
cooperation to promote economic growth, the People’s Bank of
China and Ministry of Finance said in a joint statement on both
websites.  To contact the reporter on this story:
