Rates on Treasury bills maturing
through the end of the year rose as officials in  Washington 
sought a short-term budget agreement that may push back the
deadline for a potential default by at least six weeks.  Rates on securities due in October fell from highs reached
earlier in the week as those maturing in November and December
rose on speculation that prolonged negotiations may put those
securities at risk of default. The government has been partially
shutdown since Sept. 30. Unless a deal is reached, the
government’s authority to borrow will reach its limit on Oct.
17, according to the Treasury Department.  “The market is reevaluating the risks associated with
short-term Treasury bills,” said Aaron Kohli, an interest-rate
strategist in New York at BNP Paribas SA, one of 21 primary
dealers that trade with the  Federal Reserve . “People are happy
to get out of these securities.”  Rates on debt due on Nov. 29 rose 12 basis points, or 0.12
percentage point, to 0.16 percent this week, according to
Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. They were negative as recently as
Sept. 30.  Yields on benchmark Treasury 10-year notes rose four basis
points on the week to 2.69 percent. The price of the 2.5 percent
security maturing August 2023 fell 11/32, or $3.44 per $1,000
face amount, to 98 12/32.  Treasury Auctions  The U.S. sold $64 billion of notes and bonds this week in
the last offerings of debt with fixed coupon payments before its
borrowing authority was projected to expire.  The $13 billion of 30-year bonds sold Oct. 10 drew the
highest demand since February, after lackluster $13 billion
three- and $21 billion 10-year note offerings, as lawmakers
appeared to move closer to a budget deal.  The 21 primary dealers that serve counterparties to the Fed
in its open market operations cut their holdings of Treasury
bills to $16.2 bill for the week ended Oct. 2, the lowest since
October 2012.  The cumulative short-term bill position of the dealers,
including JPMorgan Chase & Co., Goldman Sachs Group Inc., and
Barclays Plc, fell by $3.4 billion, or 17 percent, from a week
earlier, central-bank data show. The  holdings  are down from
$53.5 billion as of Sept. 11 and are at the lowest level since
Oct. 31, 2012, the data show.  Historically Low  Rates on securities due in October fell from the highest
levels this week as default speculation was pushed back into
November.  The rate on $120 billion in bills due Oct. 17 dropped to
0.20 percent yesterday after touching 0.51 percent the day
before. The rate on $93 billion in bills due Oct. 24 fell to
0.26 percent after climbing as high as 0.50 percent.  Although rates on bills have risen, they pale by historical
measures. Treasury one-month  bill rates  have averaged 1.5
percent in the past 10 years. During that time the rate touched
a high of 5.26 percent in November 2006 and dropped to a low of
negative 0.09 percent in December 2008.  President  Barack Obama  and House Republican leaders were
moving toward an agreement to extend the nation’s borrowing
authority through Nov. 22, even as they remained at odds over
terms for ending a partial shutdown of the government. They met
for 90 minutes at the White House on Nov. 10, and Obama hosted
Senate Republicans yesterday.  ‘Political Game’  “This is a political game right now,” said  Michael Franzese , senior vice president of fixed-income trading at ED&F
Man Capital Markets in New York. “It’s a good proposal and the
sense is that it gets them to the table to talk. People think
they are not going to default, and if they are not going to
default, then they put their money into bills.”  The  extra yield  investors get for buying one-month
securities instead of 91-day securities reached 28.9 basis
points on Oct. 8, the biggest difference since March 2008,
according to closing-market data.  The longer-dated bills usually yield more than their one-month counterparts. In 2013, investors have been able to earn
almost one basis point on average by buying the longer-dated
security.  Two years ago,  one-month bill rates  climbed to 0.17 percent
in the days before the Aug. 2, 2011, deadline set by the
Treasury to avoid a default. They were at 0.015 percent in
December 2012 before a year-end trigger of automatic spending
cuts and tax increases.  The  three-month rate  climbed to 0.09 percent before the
August 2011 deadline, and it rose as high as 0.081 percent in
the week before Dec. 31, 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
