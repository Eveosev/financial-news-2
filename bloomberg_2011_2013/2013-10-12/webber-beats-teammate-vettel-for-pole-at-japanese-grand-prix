Mark Webber  beat teammate and world
champion Sebastian Vettel to claim pole position for tomorrow’s
Japanese Grand Prix.  Webber posted a time of 1 minute, 30.915 seconds around the
Suzuka course to earn his first pole since the 2012 British
Grand Prix.  “I’m happy to be on pole” Webber told reporters. “You’ve
got to grab the opportunities when you can. In the end, we did
the laps when it counted and that’s what was important.”  Vettel was second-fastest, 0.174 seconds behind his Red
Bull teammate. He leads Ferrari’s  Fernando Alonso  by 77 points
with five races remaining and can clinch his fourth-straight
Formula One championship by winning and having the Spaniard not
finish in the top eight.  Even with another title looming, the German was solely
focused on tomorrow’s race.  “To speak now about a result, and what it could mean, is
not my thing,” Vettel said. “I want to do a good race on one
of my favorite tracks and give the fans a good show. Everything
else, we will see.”  Mercedes’s Lewis Hamilton, Lotus’s  Romain Grosjean  and
Ferrari’s Felipe Massa rounded out the top five qualifiers.
Alonso will start in the eighth position after finishing 0.74
seconds behind Webber.  To contact the reporter on this story:
