The International Monetary Fund’s
steering committee reiterated that the U.S. needs to take
“urgent action” to resolve “short-term fiscal
uncertainties.”  In a statement issued following a meeting of the
International Monetary and Financial Committee, the group
reiterated the message sent to the U.S. yesterday by finance
officials from the Group of 20 largest economies.  “There are encouraging signs of improving activity in
advanced economies,” the IMFC said in the statement. “Growth
in many emerging market economies has moderated.”  “Recent volatility in capital flows and financial markets
has created new challenges” for some emerging market economies,
according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
