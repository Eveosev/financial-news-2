Brazil ’s central bank may extend
into next year a program of currency swaps and credit line
auctions that has caused the real to appreciate at the fastest
pace worldwide, central bank President Alexandre Tombini said.  “The program has proved successful in curbing volatility
and could be extended beyond year end if necessary,” he said in
prepared remarks for an Oct. 12 speech before the International
Monetary and Financial Committee.  The central bank said Aug. 22 it would carry out currency
swap auctions of $500 million a day on Mondays, Tuesdays,
Wednesdays and Thursdays, as well as credit line auctions of $1
billion a day on Fridays. The $60 billion program was scheduled
to run through Dec. 31.  The real, which weakened to almost a five-year low before
the intervention started, has gained 11.9 percent since Aug. 22,
the best performance among global currencies tracked by
Bloomberg. The real rose 0.2 percent to 2.1761 per dollar
yesterday.  The seven major Latin American currencies tracked by
Bloomberg have depreciated this year as investors exit  emerging
markets  in anticipation of a U.S. Federal Reserve decision to
curtail monetary stimulus. Most U.S. policy makers said the
central bank was likely to reduce the pace of bond purchases
this year, according to minutes of the September meeting
released this week.  ‘Avert Panic’  “This is a message designed to avert panic among segments
that require hedging,”  Jankiel Santos , chief economist at Banco
Espirito Santo, said by phone about Tombini’s speech.  The central bank board also is using  monetary policy  to
ensure a weaker real doesn’t fan inflation, Tombini said in the
transcript of the speech, which was  posted in English  on the
central bank website yesterday. Policy makers have raised the
benchmark Selic rate in the past five meetings to 9.5 percent.  “Monetary policy responded firmly to inflationary
pressures since the beginning of 2013, first through
communication and then raising the policy rate since April,”
according to the speech. “Monetary policy is contributing to
making inflation retreat and limiting FX pass-through.”  Annual inflation  slowed to 5.86 percent in September from
6.09 percent the prior month. Policy makers target 4.5 percent
inflation, plus or minus two percentage points.  Tombini’s speech is on behalf of Brazil, Cape Verde,
 Dominican Republic , Ecuador, Guyana,  Haiti ,  Nicaragua , Panama,
Suriname, Timor-Leste and  Trinidad and Tobago .  To contact the reporter on this story:
