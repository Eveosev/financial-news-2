Arsenal faces a challenge from
Liverpool and Fenerbahce in its pursuit of Paris Saint-Germain
midfielder Javier Pastore, the Daily Star reported.  Arsenal unsuccessfully tried to sign Pastore, who’s scored
24 goals in 90 appearances for PSG, before the transfer period
ended last month and manager  Arsene Wenger  has renewed his
interest in the Argentine, the Star said.  Liverpool manager  Brendan Rodgers  has identified Pastore as
one of his main targets in the January transfer period, the Star
said. Fenerbahce coach Ersun Yanal also told Turkish newspaper
Fotomac he’d like to speak to PSG about Pastore.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
