Australian soccer’s governing body
fired Holger Osieck, the head coach of its national team,
following 6-0 losses to France and Brazil.  Assistant coach Aurelio Vidmar was named as caretaker head
coach of the Socceroos, Football Federation Australia said today
in an e-mailed statement. The team’s defeat yesterday in Paris
followed a loss in Brasilia on Sept. 7.  “The decision is based on the longer term issues of the
rejuvenation of the Socceroos team and the preparations for the
 World Cup  and the Asian Cup,”  Frank Lowy , the billionaire
chairman of FFA, said in the statement. “FFA has set a
strategic objective of having a highly competitive team in
Brazil and then handing over a team capable of winning the Asian
Cup on home soil in January 2015.”  German-born Osieck was put in charge of the Australian
soccer team in 2010 after the Socceroos’ World Cup campaign in
 South Africa , taking over from Pim Verbeek. While the team has
qualified for the 2014 World Cup finals in Brazil under Osieck’s
guidance, it has also seen its world ranking fall to 53 from 26
at the end of 2010.  Australia is set to host the Asian Cup tournament for the
first time in 2015. The Socceroos are scheduled to play their
next match against  Canada  in London on Oct. 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
