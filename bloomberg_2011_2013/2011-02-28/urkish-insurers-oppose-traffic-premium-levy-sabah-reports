  Turkey ’s insurance industry argues
that new legislation that takes a 15 percent levy on traffic
insurance premiums is illegal, Sabah newspaper reported.  Legislation approved in Ankara takes the 15 percent tax to
pay for healthcare costs at the state-run social security
institution, the newspaper reported.  That means that drivers who have clean accident records are
paying for the accidents of others, Milliyet said. That’s
against the law and contrary to insurance priciples, the
newspaper said, citing Recep Kocak, head of Isik Insurance. It
said Kocak’s views reflected those of others in the industry.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
