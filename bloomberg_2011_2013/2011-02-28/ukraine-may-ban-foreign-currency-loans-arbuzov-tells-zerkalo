Ukraine’s central bank wants the
parliament to adopt a law banning loans denominated in foreign
currencies for individuals and companies without foreign-
currency income, weekly newspaper  Zerkalo Nedeli  reported.  The regulator won’t allow “sharp” hryvnia fluctuations
even as it reduces its interventions on the currency market,
Zerkalo said, citing Central Bank Governor Serhiy Arbuzov.  Arbuzov also said he is against a freely convertible
hryvnia because the country’s balance of payments is
“unstable” and inflation too high, Zerkalo reported.  To contact the reporters on this story:
