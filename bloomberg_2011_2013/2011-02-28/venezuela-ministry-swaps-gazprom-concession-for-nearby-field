Venezuela  changed the terms of two
offshore gas licenses awarded to  Gazprom OAO (GAZP)  in 2005 and ordered
the  oil company  to pay bonuses to the government totaling $20
million.  The Oil Ministry replaced Gazprom’s Urumaco II concession
and gave the company the contract for the nearby Urumaco III
field instead, according to a resolution published today in the
Official Gazette. The size of the company’s Urumaco I field was
cut from 997 square kilometers (385 square miles) to 532 square
kilometers. All three fields are in the Gulf of Venezuela.  “It’s necessary to re-design” Gazprom’s blocks after  Eni
SpA (ENI)  and  Repsol YPF SA (REP)  made “one of the largest findings in
decades in the country and the world” at the nearby Cardon IV
block, the ministry said in the resolution.  Venezuelan President  Hugo Chavez  is trying to boost natural
gas production to reduce a domestic deficit and develop
liquefied natural gas export capacity. Eni said last week that
the Perla field on the Cardon IV block may hold as much as 16
trillion cubic feet of natural gas.  Chevron Corp. (CVX)  operates the
nearby Cardon III block.  Jean-Marc Pivert, Gazprom’s general manager for Venezuela,
said by telephone that he doesn’t have information on contract
changes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
