Palm oil fell on concern that higher
energy costs may threaten the global economy recovery and cool
demand for commodities after  Libya ’s violent uprising spread to
other parts of the Middle East.  The May-delivery contract declined 1.2 percent to 3,472
ringgit ($1,139) a metric ton, after advancing 2.2 percent in
intraday trading in Kuala Lumpur. Futures shed 8.8 percent for
February, ending seven straight months of gains.  Crude oil advanced as the civil unrest that has swept the
Middle East, ignited by the ouster of Tunisia’s president and
the fall of Egyptian President  Hosni Mubarak , yesterday spread
to Oman, which produces about 800,000 barrels of oil a day.
Libyan leader  Muammar Qaddafi  has vowed to fight the uprising
against his more than four-decade rule as army units and
diplomats defect, leaving much of the nation’s east coast in the
hands of the opposition.  “The fear that the political unrest may spillover to other
Arabian countries lingers,” said Ker Chung Yang, an analyst at
Phillip Futures Pte, in an e-mail today. “This may curb demand
for oilseeds. Crude  palm oil  prices could be dragged down.”  Malaysia’s palm oil exports fell 10.4 percent in February
to 1,110,672 tons from a month ago, market surveyor Intertek
said today. Shipments slumped 9.1 percent, according to rival
Societe Generale de Surveillance.  “Crude palm oil prices will not see further increases from
here but taper off closer to 3,000 ringgit before dipping below
that,” Bernard Ching, an analyst with ECM Libra Capital Sdn.,
said in a report today.  Soybeans for May delivery advanced 3.4 percent on Feb. 25,
the largest gain since Jan. 12, and closed at $13.75 a bushel.
The contract fell as much as 1 percent to $13.61 today.  Libya Oil Supply  Crude oil posted the biggest weekly gain in two years last
week amid estimates that Libya’s crude flow was cut by as much
as two-thirds. Futures for April delivery climbed to as high as
$99.96 a barrel in after-hours trading in  New York . Palm and
soybean oils are substitutes in food and fuel uses, and prices
can be influenced by shifts in energy costs.  Libyan crude output has been cut by more than 1 million
barrels a day,  Barclays Capital  said. The  International Energy
Agency  said output was down by at least 850,000 barrels. Libya
pumped 1.6 million barrels a day in January, the ninth-largest
producer among the 12 members of the OPEC.  September-delivery palm oil on the Dalian Commodity
Exchange rose 1.4 percent to close at 9,456 yuan ($1,439) a ton.
Soybean oil for delivery in the same month climbed 1.6 percent
to 10,198 yuan at the close. CME Group Inc.’s most-active June
palm-oil contract, pegged to the Malaysian benchmark price, lost
3.1 percent to $1,143.25 a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
