  Seadrill Ltd ., the owner of the
world’s second-largest fleet of deepwater rigs, placed a $225
million order for two tender rigs from  China ’s COSCO Nantong
shipyard for delivery in 2013.  The rigs have been contracted to Chevron Corp. for a five-
year period offshore  Thailand  for about $420 million, the
Bermuda-based company said today in a statement.  “These newbuilds are an important addition to our present
tender rig fleet,” Alf Thorkildsen, chief executive officer,
said in the statement. “The new orders increase earnings and
visibility, and enhance the attractiveness of our fleet.”  Seadrill fell 1.4 kroner, or 0.7 percent, at 213.6 kroner
at 1:05 p.m. in Oslo trading. The shares have risen 8.4 percent
this year, adding to last year’s 33 percent gain.  To contact the reporter on this story:
