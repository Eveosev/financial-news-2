The United nations urged Japan to
reverse its position on the  Kyoto Protocol  after the world’s
third biggest economy last year opposed extending the emissions-
limiting pact.  “You have invested a lot in the Kyoto Protocol
infrastructure,” UN Framework Convention on Climate Change
Executive Secretary Christiana Figueres said today in a speech
in Tokyo, according to an e-mailed statement. “With a
categorical ‘NO’ to the Kyoto Protocol, Japan risks losing those
investments.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
