  QBE Insurance Group Ltd .,  Australia ’s largest insurer, said profit growth will accelerate
this year after the company raised its forecast for premiums.  Insurance profit will rise at least 22 percent in the 12
months to Dec. 31 from $1.70 billion, after gaining 6 percent
last year, Sydney-based QBE said in a statement today. The
shares fell after the company said its 2010 insurance margin
dropped to the lowest level since 2004.  Chief Executive Officer Frank O’Halloran is expanding
overseas to offset slower growth in Australia, which has also
been buffeted by a surge in claims from natural disasters.
Founded by two Scotsmen in 1886, the company this month agreed
to buy Bank of America Corp.’s Balboa Insurance Co. unit that
insures foreclosed homes in the U.S. The company has made 48
acquisitions since 2005, O’Halloran said today.  The narrower insurance margin “reflects sharply lower
returns on the burgeoning investment portfolio,” said Peter
Warnes, an analyst at Morningstar Inc. in Sydney with a “buy”
rating on the stock. “Reduced investment income is not the
result of bad management, but conservatism in protecting these
funds so that future claims can be paid.  Interest rates  will
recover and so will investment income and the insurance
margin.”  QBE shares fell 1.4 percent to A$18.14 at the close of
trading in Sydney today, the lowest since Feb. 2. The stock is
little changed this year, while rival Suncorp Group Ltd. has
declined 2.2 percent and  Insurance Australia Group Ltd . has
dropped 5.9 percent.  Margin Forecast  The insurance margin narrowed to 15 percent last year from
17 percent in 2009, the company said today. In 2004, it had a
margin of 13.7 percent.  Net earned premiums will grow between 22 percent and 25
percent in 2011, helped by acquisitions, O’Halloran told
analysts on a call today. There is “an expectation that
insurance profit will grow by at least a similar percentage,”
the insurer said in its statement.  The company said Feb. 4 that net earned premium growth
would be between 20 percent and 23 percent this year.  Net income in 2010 dropped to $1.28 billion from $1.53
billion a year earlier, QBE said, reiterating its Feb. 4
statement that profit fell 17 percent.  To contact the reporter for this story:
