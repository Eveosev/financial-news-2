  Vietnam ’s dong strengthened against
the dollar at money changers on speculation foreign-exchange
reserves will rise after Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung ordered
state-owned companies not to “hoard” the greenback.  “Sentiment improved on the foreign-exchange market on
expectations reserves will increase once companies sell their
dollars to the  state bank ,” Marc Djandji, the Ho Chi Minh City-
based head of research at Viet Capital Securities, wrote in a
report today.  The dong advanced in the unofficial market, trading between
21,900 and 21,960 as of 3 p.m. at gold shops in  Hanoi , compared
with between 21,960 and 22,080 on Feb. 25, according to an
information service run by state-owned Vietnam Posts &
Telecommunications.  The official rate for the currency dropped 0.04 percent to
20,878, taking losses for the month to 6.6 percent, according to
prices from banks compiled by Bloomberg.  “How can you hoard U.S. dollars when we are in this
difficult situation?” Dung said at a meeting with ministries in
Hanoi on Feb. 24.  The State Bank of Vietnam set the daily  reference rate  at
20,673, compared with 20,683 on Feb. 25, according to its
website. The currency is allowed to trade up to 1 percent on
either side of that rate.  The yield on the benchmark five-year bond fell four basis
points to 11.55 percent, according to a daily fixing from banks
compiled by Bloomberg. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  --Diep Ngoc Pham in Hanoi. With reporting by Jason Folkmanis in  Ho Chi Minh City . Editors: Simon Harvey  To contact the Bloomberg News staff on this story:
