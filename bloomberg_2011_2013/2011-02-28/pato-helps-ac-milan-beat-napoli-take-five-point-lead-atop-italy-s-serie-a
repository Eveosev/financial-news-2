Alexandre Pato scored one goal and
set up another as AC Milan beat title rival Napoli 3-0 to move
five points clear atop Italy’s Serie A.  Zlatan Ibrahimovic opened the scoring last night with a
49th-minute penalty before Brazilian forward Pato set up Kevin Prince Boateng. Pato added the third with 11 minutes left,
breaking from his own half before beating the Napoli goalkeeper
with a curling shot from the edge of the penalty as two
defenders stood in front of him to narrow his options.  Milan’s third straight league win lifts it to 58 points
with 11 matches left as the Rossoneri seek their first Italian
soccer championship since 2004. City rival Inter, which has won
the past five Serie titles, has 53 points with Napoli on 52.  “We have taken three very important points,” Pato said in
comments on his team’s website. “There are still many games
left to play. The important thing is that we are a united
side.”  Milan’s next game is at seventh-place Juventus on March 5.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
