  BMC Software Inc . call trades jumped
to a two-month high before the business-software maker
participates in the  Morgan Stanley  Technology, Media & Telecom
Conference on March 2.  A block of 5,000 January $60 calls changed hands for $1.73
each at 10:01 a.m., and a block of 4,425 August $60 calls traded
for 85 cents an option 47 seconds later, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. The open interest for the January $60 calls was
157 contracts before today, while the August $60 calls had an
open interest of 132 contracts before today.  Almost 13,000 calls to buy the stock changed hands today,
13 times the four-week average and 64 times the number of puts
to sell. The most-traded contracts were the August $60 calls and
January $60 calls, which together accounted for more than four-
fifths of all call trades. Houston-based BMC rose 1.2 percent to
$49.50.  Calls give the right to buy 100 shares of a security for a
certain amount, the strike price, by a set date. Puts convey the
right to sell. Investors use options to guard against
fluctuations in the price of securities they own, speculate on
share-price moves or bet that volatility, or stock swings, will
rise or fall.  To contact the reporter on this story:
