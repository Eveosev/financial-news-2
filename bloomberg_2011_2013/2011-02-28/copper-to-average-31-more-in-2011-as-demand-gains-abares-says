  Australia , the world’s largest iron
ore exporter, will export 5.5 percent more of the steelmaking
raw material this year as  BHP Billiton Ltd . and Rio Tinto Group
increase output, taking advantage of higher prices.  Australia may ship 425 million metric tons in 2011 and 462
million tons next year, the Canberra-based Australian Bureau of
Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences said today in a
report. The nation’s copper and nickel exports will also climb
as global consumption increases.  Rio and BHP, the world’s second- and third-largest iron ore
producers, are expanding mines in Australia to meet demand led
by  China . Global steel consumption may climb 6 percent this year
to 1.4 billion tons and may reach 1.9 billion tons in 2016, the
government-run bureau said.  “Growth in steel consumption in developing Asian economies
will form the backbone of world steel demand growth, reflecting
the development of infrastructure and rising incomes in these
economies,” the bureau said in the report. “Prices for both  iron ore  and metallurgical coal are forecast to remain well
above historical averages.”  Australia’s export earnings from iron ore may be 64 percent
higher this fiscal year at A$57 billion ($57.9 billion), it said.
That may gain to A$68 billion in the year ending June 30, 2016.
Total sales from metals and minerals may gain 12 percent to
A$125.8 billion this financial year.  Iron Ore Prices  Exports of iron ore are projected to increase at an average
annual rate of 7 percent to 2016 to 599 million tons, the bureau
said. By 2016, Australian exports are projected to account for
43 percent of world trade, it said. Exports may rise to 599
million tons by 2016.    Brazil , the world’s second-largest producer, may ship 332
million tons this year, an increase of 7.8 percent, rising to
436 million tons in 2016.  Iron ore prices may average $149 a ton this year, compared
with $112 a ton in 2010, it said. Prices will decline as
companies including BHP, Rio and Vale SA, the world’s largest
producer, expand operations. Iron ore will average $93 a ton by
2016.  China, the world’s biggest producer of steel, is forecast
to produce 671 million tons this calendar year, up 7 percent.
The nation’s steel consumption is projected to increase by 8
percent a year to 995 million tons by 2016.  To contact the reporter on this story:
