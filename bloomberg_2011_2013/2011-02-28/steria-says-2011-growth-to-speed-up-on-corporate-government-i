  Groupe Steria SCA  said it expects
faster revenue growth next year as companies and governments
increase spending on computing services.  The Velizy, France-based information technology company is
benefitting as corporate clients “no longer hesitate to invest
to reduce operating expenses” after pulling back during the
global economic crisis, Chief Executive Officer Francois Enaud
said. Steria today said it expects sales growth between 3 and 4
percent in 2011, compared with a 1.5 percent rise last year.  For Steria’s public-sector clients, austerity-driven
efforts to cut operating costs are boosting the popularity of
outsourcing and IT overhauls, Enaud said. “There is a desire to
reduce expenses overall, but that doesn’t necessarily mean less
IT spending,” he added.  Full-year net income declined 11 percent at Steria to 42.9
million euros as the company re-evaluated pension commitments
and covered the costs of “rationalization and optimization” of
offices. The company said it expects to hit an operating margin
rate “at least equal” to last year’s 7.1 percent level.  Steria fell 0.2 percent to 22.86 euros in Paris.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
