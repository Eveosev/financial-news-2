Richard Desmond, the owner of the
Daily Express newspaper, told Sky News in an interview that
while he would “never go against”  News Corp . Chairman  Rupert Murdoch  in his company’s bid to buy British Sky Broadcasting,
the risk of so much media control resting in the hands of
Murdoch’s successor could create a “very dangerous situation”
if the person were a “despot.”  The Murdoch family own 11 percent of News Corp., while the
second biggest investor in the company is from the Middle East,
Desmond said in the interview. “I think we have to be a bit
careful,” he said to Sky News.  To contact the reporter on this story:
