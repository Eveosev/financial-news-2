  Juventus Football Club SpA  said it’s
expecting a “significant” fiscal 2010-11 full-year loss
because of its failure to qualify for the European Champions
League competition.  The company reported in a statement a first-half net loss
of 39.5 million euros ($54.6 million), compared with a 14.2
million-euro profit in the year-ago period.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
