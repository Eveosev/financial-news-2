  Carlos Vela  scored with three
minutes remaining to give West Brom a 1-1 draw at Stoke in
English soccer’s Premier League.  Mexican striker Vela, on loan from Arsenal, finished from
close range from what television replays showed to be an offside
position after coming on as a substitute to help lift West Brom
out of the three-team relegation zone. Rory Delap had put Stoke
ahead in the 53rd minute.  Stoke goalkeeper Asmir Begovic made four saves in the last
minute of stoppage time to preserve the draw. He stopped Graham
Dorrans’s long shot and Vela’s follow-up from the rebound before
pushing Somen Tchoyi’s curling shot away with one hand and
thwarting Vela again with his legs.  West Brom moves out of the bottom three and into 17th
place, one point above Wolves with 29. Stoke climbs above
Everton into 10th spot with 34 points.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
