  Vodafone Group Plc  said most U.K.
voice calling affected by an overnight theft that damaged
equipment and left some customers without network access is
running again.  “Several hundred thousand” customers of the world’s
largest mobile-phone operator by revenue may have lost voice,
data, and text service this morning, which is now being
progressively restored, the company said in a  posting  on its
official Web forum.  A break-in at a network facility in Basingtoke, southern
England, last night caused the outage, which Vodafone said
mostly affected customers along the M4 highway corridor that
runs from west London toward Cardiff, Wales.  Vodafone has about 19 million customers in the U.K., where
it competes primarily with  Telefonica SA ’s O2 unit and
Everything Everywhere, a joint venture between France Telecom SA
and Deutsche Telekom AG.  Newbury, England-based Vodafone’s Australian unit in
December  apologized  to customers for poor network performance
after a series of “intermittent network issues.” The unit has
announced plans to upgrade  network equipment .  To contact the reporter on this story:
