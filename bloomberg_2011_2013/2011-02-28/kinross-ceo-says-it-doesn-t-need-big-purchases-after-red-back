  Kinross Gold Corp ., the fourth-
biggest North American gold producer, said it doesn’t need to
make “big” acquisitions after paying C$8 billion ($8.22
billion) for Vancouver-based Red Back Mining Inc.  “We’ve got three great mines that we’re building over the
next five years,” Kinross Chief Executive Officer Tye Burt said
today in an interview with Bloomberg Television in Hollywood,
Florida. “We don’t really need to make big acquisitions right
now.”  The purchase of Red Back in September was Toronto-based
Kinross’s largest acquisition to date, giving it two gold mines
in  Africa  including the Tasiast project in Mauritania. The
company is seeking to reduce costs with new projects, Burt said.  “We think we just bought the world’s best new gold mine,”
Burt said of the Red Back deal. “The great thing about the new
mines we’re adding is that they are lower than our average cash
costs across the company.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
