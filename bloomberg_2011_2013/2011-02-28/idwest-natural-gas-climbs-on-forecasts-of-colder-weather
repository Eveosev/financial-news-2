(Corrects NGPL pipeline owner in second paragraph of story
published yesterday.)  Natural gas for next-day delivery in
the U.S. Midwest climbed on forecasts for colder-than-normal
weather that may spark greater demand for the heating fuel.  Gas at the NGPL Midcontinent hub, which transports the fuel
to the Midwest from the 9,800-mile NGPL pipeline, rose 10.03
cents, or 2.7 percent, to $3.8453 per million British thermal
units on the  Intercontinental Exchange . The pipeline is owned by
Myria Holdings Inc. and Kinder Morgan Inc.  Gas at the  Henry Hub  in Erath, Louisiana, the delivery
point for futures traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange ,
advanced 11.92 cents, or 3.1 percent, to $3.9264 per million Btu
on the exchange.  Deliveries scheduled for homes in the U.S. and Canada today
declined 4.5 percent to 33 million dekatherms (32.1 billion
cubic feet), according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Residences in the Midwest were to receive 1.9 million
dekatherms of gas, 1 percent more than yesterday, Bloomberg data
show.  Scheduled shipments for U.S. power plants dropped 0.7
percent to 10.4 million dekatherms.  The low temperature in  Des Moines , Iowa, tomorrow is
forecast to be 20 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 7 Celsius), 3
degrees below normal, according to  Weather Underground  in  Ann
Arbor , Michigan.  Temperatures in the upper Midwest and West may be below-
normal through March 14, according to MDA Federal Inc.â€™s
EarthSat Energy Weather in Rockville, Maryland.  To contact the reporter on this story:
