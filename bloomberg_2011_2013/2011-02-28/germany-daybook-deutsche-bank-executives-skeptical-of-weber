Several Deutsche Bank (DBK GY)
executives oppose Bundesbank President  Axel Weber  possibly
succeeding Chief Executive Officer  Josef Ackermann , Die Welt am
Sonntag reported, citing management and supervisory board
members. Weber, who announced his resignation as head of
Germany’s central bank Feb. 11, lacks private banking experience
and damaged his reputation with German politicians by his abrupt
departure, Die Welt quoted Deutsche Bank executives as saying.  Bayer (BAYN GY) posted an unexpected fourth-quarter net
loss of 145 million euros ($200 million) because of a writedown
at the Schering pharmaceutical brand and costs of a
reorganization that will shift resources to product development
and emerging markets. Analysts were expecting net income of
160.6 million euros, according to the average of seven estimates
compiled by Bloomberg.  EQUITIES:
