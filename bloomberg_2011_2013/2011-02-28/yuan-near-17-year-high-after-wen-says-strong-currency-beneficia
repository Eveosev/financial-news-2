  China ’s yuan traded near a 17-year
high after Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao said a stronger currency
will benefit the nation’s economy.  While the appreciation will be gradual, strength is
beneficial as it curbs inflation, Wen said yesterday in an
online interview with citizens. The government has set an annual
economic growth target of 7 percent for the five-year period
through 2015, compared with 7.5 percent for the preceding five
years, Wen said.  “Investors are encouraged but if anything, the statement
on GDP growth caught more attention," said Pin Ru Tan, a
strategist at Royal Bank of  Scotland  in  Singapore .  The yuan traded at 6.5771 per dollar in Shanghai as of
10:29 a.m., from 6.5750 on Feb. 25, according to the China
Foreign Exchange Trade System. It has gained 3.8 percent since a
two-year peg was relaxed in June and touched a 17-year high of
6.5654 on Feb. 21.  The central bank set its daily  reference rate  0.01 percent
stronger at 6.5752. The currency is allowed to trade up to 0.5
percent on either side of the official rate.  Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards climbed 0.03 percent
to 6.4235, reflecting bets the currency will strengthen 2.4
percent in a year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  --Fion Li. Editors: Sandy Hendry, Ven Ram  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
