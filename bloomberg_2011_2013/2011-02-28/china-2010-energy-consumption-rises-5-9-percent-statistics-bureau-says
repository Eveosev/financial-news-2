  China  increased energy consumption
by 5.9 percent last year as factories ramped up production to
fuel the world’s fastest-growing major economy, data from the
National Bureau of Statistics show.  Energy use climbed to 3.25 billion metric tons of coal
equivalent in 2010, the bureau said in a  statement  on its
website today. Consumption fell 4.01 percent per unit of gross
domestic product, according to the bureau.  Economic growth accelerated to 10.3 percent in 2010, the
fastest pace in three years, as industrial production rose,
boosting demand for fuel and electricity. Crude oil consumption
expanded 12.9 percent last year while power use gained 13.1
percent, according to the bureau.  Natural gas demand rose 18.2 percent and coal consumption
gained 5.3 percent, the bureau said.  China aims to reduce energy use per unit of GDP by as much
as 17 percent in the five years ending 2015, after failing to
meet a target to cut consumption by 20 percent in the 2006-to-
2010 period, Premier  Wen Jiabao  said yesterday.  The government has set an annual economic growth target of
7 percent for the five-year period through 2015, Wen said.
China’s goal was 7.5 percent for the period from 2006 through
last year. Actual growth exceeded that target each year.  -  Wang Ying . Editors: Ryan Woo, Aaron Sheldrick.  To contact the reporter on this story:
