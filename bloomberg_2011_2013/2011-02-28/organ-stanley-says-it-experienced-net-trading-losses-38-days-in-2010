  Morgan Stanley , the sixth-largest  U.S. bank  by assets, had trading losses on 38 days in 2010, the
same number as in 2009.  The firm’s trading division lost money on 13 days during
the fourth quarter, according to a filing with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission. New York-based Morgan
Stanley generated more than $100 million on about 25 days in
2010, down from 69 days in 2009.  Morgan Stanley had $10.3 billion in sales and trading
revenue for 2010, about half that of rivals Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. Excluding charges relating to the
firm’s credit spreads, the bank’s trading revenue fell 22
percent from 2009 to $11.1 billion. Chief Executive Officer  James Gorman , 52, has changed management and increased hiring in
the fixed-income trading unit to close the gap.  Bank of America Corp. said last week that it had gains on
90 percent of its trading days in 2010. Citigroup Inc. had 55
days of losses out of 260 trading days in the year, meaning it
had positive revenue on 79 percent of days. JPMorgan said it
lost money on eight trading days in 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
