  Vale SA , the world’s second-largest
mining company, may start a pulp project in  Brazil  after buying
land with a 605 million-real ($364 million) reforestation fund.  The Rio de Janeiro-based company would make the pulp using
wood bought from the Vale Florestar fund, which currently sells
the raw material to other producers, said Jose Flavio, Vale’s
general manager of forest operations. Vale may start producing
pulp, the main raw material used to make paper, sometime after
2015, he said Feb. 23 by telephone from Brazil’s Para state.  The fund -- created by Vale; Brazil’s national development
bank, known as the BNDES; and the pension funds of  Petroleo
Brasileiro SA  and Caixa Economico Federal -- has bought 100,000
hectares (247,000 acres) and aims to more than quadruple its
holdings to 450,000 hectares by 2015, Flavio said. About 62,000
hectares has been designated for preservation, and the rest is
being used as commercial forestland and for logistics.  “What’s special about this project is that it marries
commercial management with the preservation of native forests,”
said Onito Barbosa, a partner at Global Equity SA Administradora
de Recursos, which manages the fund.  It takes seven years for trees used in commercial pulp
production to mature before they are harvested, Barbosa said.
The fund is expected to return a profit after three seven-year
cycles.  “The first cycle is to pay costs,” he said Feb. 22 in an
interview in  Sao Paulo . “During the second cycle, the project
will break even. And in the third cycle, it will reach full
profit.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
