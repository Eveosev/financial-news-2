Bank of Cyprus Pcl, the country’s
biggest lender, said full-year profit fell 2 percent after it
increased provisions for bad loans.  Net income declined to 306 million euros ($421.7 million)
in the 12 months ended Dec. 31, from 313 million euros in 2009,
the Nicosia-based bank said today in an e-mailed statement.  Bank of Cyprus previously forecast full-year profit at
between 300 million euros and 400 million euros. Excluding the
provisions, profit would have risen 18 percent to 725 million
euros.  The bank, which also has operations in Greece,  Russia ,  Australia , Ukraine,  Romania  and the U.K., forecast that net
earnings in 2011 will be similar to 2010 with a positive
contribution from all of its markets, while profit before
provisions will be higher.  A planned government bank tax will have limited impact for
the industry on the island and cost Bank of Cyprus between 18
million euros and 20 million euros a year, Chief Executive
Officer Andreas Eliades said in an interview in Nicosia today.  Cyprus aims to raise 60 million euros annually from the
tax, during two years, of which 35 million euros will go to the
state and 25 million euros to a bank support fund.  “If this and other measures help the economy fare better,
for us it will be beneficial,” Eliades said.  Income From Lending  Bank of Cyprus said income from lending climbed 23 percent
to 1.04 billion euros. Interest income from Cyprus gained 22
percent to 523 million euros, while in  Greece  it rose 18 percent
to 310 million euros. In Russia, interest income advanced 66
percent to 119 million euros.  The lender will propose a final dividend for the full year
of 9 cents a share. Bank of Cyprus has already paid an interim
dividend of 6 cents a share. Its policy on dividend payout has
been in the “spirit” of the guidelines of the Central Bank of
Cyprus, Eliades said.  While the capital and liquidity levels of Cypriot banks are
adequate and cause no concern, the central bank recommended
lenders not distribute dividends to counter probable doubts over
the soundness of the banking system caused by Cyprus’s recent
sovereign rating cuts, Cyprus Central Bank governor Athanasios Orphanides said Feb. 25.  To contact the reporters on this story:
