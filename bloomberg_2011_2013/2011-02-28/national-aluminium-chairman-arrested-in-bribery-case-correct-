Investigation arrested the chairman of National Aluminium Co.,
one of  India ’s two largest makers of the alloy, in a bribery
investigation.  The  statement  on the bureau’s website dated Feb. 25 gave no
names. Calls to the mobile phone and office of A.K. Srivastava,
chairman of National Aluminium, went unanswered. Finance
Director B.L. Bagra, who declined to comment on the report on
Feb. 25, couldn’t be reached at his office the next day.  The chairman’s wife accepted three one kilogram (32.2 troy
ounce) bricks of 24-carat gold from the wife of a person
brokering a deal between the chairman and a group of private
companies based in the central state of Madhya Pradesh, the
bureau said. Both couples were arrested, it said.  The chairman’s wife was arrested in  New Delhi  after she
deposited the gold in a locker in the  Bank of Maharashtra ,
according to the statement. Investigation of two lockers
resulted in a total haul of 10.2 kilograms of gold and 3 million
rupees ($66,200) cash, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
