The dollar fell to its lowest since
November against the currencies of six U.S. trade partners on
bets Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  will signal to
Congress the central bank plans to maintain economic stimulus.  The euro rose against the dollar on speculation European
Central Bank President  Jean-Claude Trichet  may indicate this
week a readiness to increase borrowing costs. Sweden’s krona
climbed to a 30-month high after Riksbank Governor Stefan Ingves
said the central bank may boost interest rates at every meeting
this year.  Canada ’s currency reached a three-year high versus
the greenback.  “The FX market will want to see the juxtaposition between
Bernanke and Trichet this week,” said  Greg Anderson , a currency
strategist at Citigroup Inc. in New York. “The Riksbank
comments are pretty critical and if you think that’s reflective
of what the ECB and Bank of England would say and do, you’ve got
to be pricing in more hawkishness on that side of the Atlantic
than this side.”  IntercontinentalExchange Inc.’s Dollar Index, which tracks
the greenback against currencies including the euro and yen,
decreased as much as 0.7 percent to 76.756, the lowest level
since Nov. 9, before trading at 76.801 at 10:20 a.m. in  New
York , compared with 77.275 on Feb. 25. The gauge has fallen 1.2
percent in February.  The dollar remained lower versus most major peers even
after the Institute for Supply Management-Chicago Inc.’s
business barometer unexpectedly rose to 71.2 this month, the
highest level since July 1988, from 68.8 in January.  Consumer Spending Falls  U.S. consumer spending rose less than forecast in January,
accelerating 0.2 percent amid increasing fuel and food costs,
data from the Commerce Department showed today. Another report
showed European inflation stayed above the ECB’s 2 percent
target for a second month in January.  The Swedish krona appreciated as much as 2 percent to
6.2934 versus the dollar, the strongest level since August 2008,
on the outlook for higher  interest rates . It traded at 6.2954.  There is “an increased probability that the repo rate will
be raised at all of the monetary policy meetings held this
year,” Ingves said in the  minutes  of the bank’s Feb. 14
meeting, published today. The Riksbank raised its benchmark repo
rate this month for a fifth time since July, to 1.5 percent.  The krona appreciated 1.5 percent to 8.7093 per euro, from
8.8353 on Feb. 25. It has climbed 4.9 percent this year,
according to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Currency Indexes,
which track the currencies of 10 developed nations. The euro has
risen 1.3 percent, while the dollar has lost 2.3 percent.  ECB Meeting  An ECB governing council member,  Mario Draghi , said on Feb.
26 that inflation pressures are forcing policy makers to focus
more closely on the timing of future interest-rate increases.  The ECB, which has kept its key interest rate at 1 percent
since May 2009, will hold its next policy meeting on March 3.  The 17-nation euro gained 0.5 percent to $1.3827, extending
its monthly advance to 1 percent, and rose 0.7 percent to 113.16
yen. It was up for the first time in three days against the
Swiss franc, gaining 0.4 percent to 1.2824. Japan’s currency
slid 0.2 percent to 81.85 per dollar.  Bernanke is scheduled to deliver the Fed’s semiannual
report on monetary policy to the Senate Banking Committee
tomorrow and is due to testify before the House Financial
Services Committee on the following day.  Fed Policy Makers  The  Federal Open Market Committee  affirmed last month plans
to continue its program of buying $600 billion of Treasuries
through June even as policy makers increased their projections
for U.S. growth this year. The Fed has kept its benchmark
interest rate at zero to 0.25 percent since December 2008.    Oil prices  at almost a 29-month high and concern political
turmoil that cut  Libya ’s output will spread have curtailed
demand for currencies related to economic growth.  “We’ve had a pause for breath after the events of the past
few days,” said  Jeremy Stretch , executive director of foreign-
exchange strategy at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce in  London . While political instability in the Middle East “hasn’t
spiraled out of control,” there are “still enough headwinds
out there to be wary,” he said.  Crude oil for April delivery rose as much 2.1 percent to
$99.96 a barrel in New York before trading at $97.29. It rose
last week to $103.41, the highest level since September 2008.  Canada’s dollar touched its strongest level against the
dollar since Feb. 28, 2008, after a government report showed the
nation’s economy grew at a 3.3 percent annual pace in the fourth
quarter, more than economists forecast.  The currency was headed for a 2.8 percent rally this month
before tomorrow’s meeting of the  Bank of Canada , which has
expressed concern that its strength may stall growth.  Canada’s dollar appreciated 0.4 percent to 97.40 cents per  U.S. dollar , from 97.74 on Feb. 25. It touched 97.28 cents.  To contact the reporters on this story:
