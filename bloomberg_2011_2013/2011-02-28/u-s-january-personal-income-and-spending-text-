Following is the text of the U.S. personal income
and spending report for Jan. released by the Commerce Department.  Personal income increased $133.2 billion, or 1.0 percent, and disposable
personal income (DPI) increased $78.3 billion, or 0.7 percent, in January,
according to the  Bureau of Economic Analysis . Personal consumption
expenditures (PCE) increased $23.7 billion, or 0.2 percent.  In December,
personal income increased $56.6 billion, or 0.4 percent, DPI increased $48.5
billion, or 0.4 percent, and PCE increased $56.5 billion, or 0.5 percent,
based on revised estimates.  Real disposable income increased 0.4 percent in January, compared with an
increase of 0.1 percent in December.  Real PCE decreased 0.1 percent, in
contrast to an increase of 0.3 percent.  2010                               2011  Sept.    Oct.     Nov.     Dec.     Jan.  (Percent change from preceding month)

Personal consumption expenditures:
 Current dollars                     0.3      0.7      0.3      0.5      0.2
 Chained (2005) dollars              0.2      0.5      0.2      0.3     -0.1  The January change in disposable personal income (DPI) was affected by two
large special factors. Reduced employee contributions for government social
insurance, which reflected provisions of the Tax Relief, Unemployment
Insurance Reauthorization and Job Creation Act of 2010, boosted personal
income in January by reducing the employee social security contribution rates
(employee contributions for government social insurance are a subtraction in
the calculation of personal income).  The January change in DPI was affected
by the expiration of the Making Work Pay provisions of the American Recovery
and Reinvestment Act of 2009, which boosted personal current taxes and reduced
DPI (personal current taxes are a subtraction in the calculation of DPI).
Excluding these two special factors, which are discussed more fully below, DPI
increased $11.4 billion, or 0.1 percent, in January, following an increase of
$48.5 billion, or 0.4 percent, in December.  Wages and salaries  Private wage and salary disbursements increased $14.8 billion in January,
compared with an increase of $20.8 billion in December.  Goods-producing
industries' payrolls increased $10.0 billion, compared with an increase of
$2.5 billion; manufacturing payrolls increased $7.0 billion, compared with an
increase of $2.6 billion. Services-producing industries' payrolls increased
$4.8 billion, compared with an increase of $18.2 billion. Government wage and
salary disbursements increased $1.9 billion, compared with an increase of $1.0
billion.  Other personal income  Employer contributions for employee pension and insurance funds increased $3.4
billion in January, compared with an increase of $2.7 billion in December.  Employer contributions for government social insurance increased $8.6 billion
in January, compared with an increase of $1.1 billion in December.  The
January increase was boosted by $7.5 billion reflecting an increase in the tax
rates paid by employers to state unemployment funds.  (Changes in employer
contributions for government social insurance do not affect personal income,
because employer contributions for government social insurance are also
included in total contributions for government social insurance, which is a
subtraction in the calculation of personal income.)  Proprietors' income increased $3.9 billion in January, compared with an
increase of $8.2 billion in December.  Farm proprietors' income increased $1.6
billion, compared with an increase of $1.5 billion. Nonfarm proprietors'
income increased $2.3 billion, compared with an increase of $6.6 billion.  Rental income of persons increased $6.5 billion in January, compared with an
increase of $1.9 billion in December.  Personal income receipts on assets
(personal interest income plus personal dividend income) increased $10.3
billion, compared with an increase of $21.1 billion.  Personal current transfer receipts decreased $11.2 billion, in contrast to an
increase of $2.4 billion. The January decrease in personal current transfer
receipts reflected a decrease of $8.9 billion to the Earned Income Credit
based on federal budget projections.  Contributions for government social insurance -- a subtraction in calculating
personal income -- decreased $94.9 billion in January, in contrast to an
increase of $2.5 billion in December.  The January decrease reflected
decreases in personal contributions for government social insurance and
increases in employer contributions.  The January decrease in personal
contributions for government social insurance reflected the Tax Relief,
Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization and Job Creation Act of 2010, which
temporarily decreased the social security contribution rate for employees and
self-employed workers by 2.0 percentage points for 2011, or $105.4 billion at
an annual rate. As noted above, employer contributions were boosted $7.5
billion in January by increases in the unemployment-insurance rate.  Personal current taxes and disposable personal income  Personal current taxes increased $55.0 billion in January, compared with an
increase of $8.0 billion in December.  Expiration of the Making Work Pay
Credit provision of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 boosted
federal withheld income taxes by $38.6 billion in January.  Federal net
nonwithheld income taxes (payments of estimated taxes plus final settlements
less refunds) boosted the January change by $11.3 billion, based on the Office
of Tax Analysis projections of higher final settlement and refunds for 2010.
Disposable personal income (DPI) -- personal income less personal current
taxes -- increased $78.3 billion, or 0.7 percent, in January, compared with an
increase of $48.5 billion, or 0.4 percent in December.  Personal outlays and personal saving  Personal outlays -- PCE, personal interest payments, and personal current
transfer payments -- increased $22.1 billion in January, compared with an
increase of $54.4 billion in December.  PCE increased $23.7 billion, compared
with an increase of $56.5 billion.  Personal saving -- DPI less personal outlays -- was $677.1 billion in January,
compared with $620.9 billion in December.  Personal saving as a percentage of
disposable personal income was 5.8 percent in January, compared with 5.4
percent in December.  For a comparison of personal saving in BEA's national
income and product accounts with personal saving in the Federal Reserve
Board's flow of funds accounts and data on changes in net worth, go to

January, compared with an increase of 0.1 percent in December.  Real PCE -- PCE adjusted to remove price changes -- decreased 0.1 percent in
January, in contrast to an increase of 0.3 percent in December.  Purchases of
durable goods increased 0.3 percent, compared with an increase of 1.2 percent.
Purchases of motor vehicles and parts accounted for most of the increase in
durable goods in January and in December.  Purchases of nondurable goods
decreased 0.2 percent in January, in contrast to an increase of 0.1 percent in
December. Purchases of services decreased 0.1 percent, in contrast to an
increase of 0.2 percent.  PCE price index -- The price index for PCE increased 0.3 percent in January,
the same increase as in December. The PCE  price index , excluding food and
energy in January, increased 0.1 percent, compared with an increase of less
than 0.1 percent in December.  2010 Personal Income and Outlays  Personal income increased 3.0 percent in 2010 (that is, from the 2009 annual
level to the 2010 annual level), in contrast to a decrease of 1.7 percent in
2009.  DPI increased 3.1 percent, compared with an increase of 0.7 percent.
PCE increased 3.5 percent, in contrast to a decrease of 1.0 percent.  Real DPI increased 1.4 percent in 2010, compared with an increase of 0.6
percent in 2009.  Real PCE increased 1.8 percent, in contrast to a decrease of
1.2 percent.  Revisions  Estimates for personal income and DPI have been revised for July through
December; estimates for PCE have been revised for October through December.

current-dollar and chained (2005) dollar PCE for November and December --
