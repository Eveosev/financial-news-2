Kenyan lenders will probably reject
central bank calls to cut lending rates this year as they seek
to reduce loan losses, said James Mwangi, managing director of  Equity Bank Ltd ., the nation’s biggest by market value.  “How could you charge anything less with this
microeconomic environment?” Mwangi said in an interview today
in Nairobi, Kenya’s capital. “The government is offering about
9 percent for a 10-year bond which is practically risk-free.”  Eight reductions to the  Central Bank of Kenya’s  benchmark
interest rate since December 2008 to a record low of 5.75
percent haven’t persuaded commercial lenders to lower the cost
of borrowing for their customers. Kenyan banks’ average lending
rate dipped to 14.03 percent in January compared with 14.22
percent two years earlier. The lending rate may range between 12
percent and 14 percent over the course of 2011, said Mwangi.  The weighted average yield on 10-year bonds sold at an
auction last month was 9.683 percent, compared with 8.646
percent at the previous sale, the  central bank  said Jan. 26.  “Among banks we are seeing a general sentiment of  risk
aversion , and I think we’re going to continue seeing depressed
lending and loan uptake this year,” George Bodo, a research
analyst with Nairobi-based Genghis Capital, by phone today.
“There may be less  consumer lending  as we approach 2012, an
election year, taking a cue from 2007.”  Information Dearth  Allegations of vote-rigging in a December 2007 presidential
poll sparked two months of unrest that left 1,500 people dead
and displaced 300,000, slowing growth in East Africa’s biggest
economy to 1.7 percent in 2008, from 7.1 percent a year earlier.  Kenyan banks cite a lack of information about potential
borrowers’ credit history and insufficient legal consequences
for loan defaulters as factors keeping lending rates high. In
August,  Kenya  began its first program for banks to share credit
information about clients such as non-performing loans.  Equity Bank said full-year profit surged 69 percent as
earnings from loans increased and announced plans to expand
further in the region.  Net income jumped to 7.13 billion shillings ($86.4
million), or 1.93 shillings per share, in the 12 months through
December, from 4.23 billion shillings, or 1.14 shillings per
share a year earlier, Mwangi said. Total interest income, the
money banks earn from interest charges on loans, climbed 28
percent to 13.8 billion shillings, he said.  Equity Bank increased its number of branches to 165 from
154 and plans to open a total of eight outlets in Rwanda and
Tanzania by April, Mwangi said.  Growth Boosts Earnings  Bank earnings in East Africa’s largest economy have been
growing as accelerating economic expansion spurs more Kenyans to
take out loans, open accounts and demand other financial
services. The industry’s combined pretax profit surged 46
percent to 66 billion shillings in the eleven months through
November on loan growth and higher income from fees and
commissions, the Central Bank of Kenya said on Feb. 11.  Last week,  Barclays Bank of Kenya Ltd ., the country’s
second-biggest lender, said full-year profit jumped 74 percent,
boosted by the sale of its custody business. Kenya Commercial
Bank Ltd.’s profit rose 76 percent in the period, while NIC Bank
Ltd. reported net income growth of 71 percent.  Kenya’s banks are poised to increase earnings by an average
of 30 percent this year as the difference between the interest
they pay on savers’ deposits and what they charge for loans
widens, African Alliance Securities Kenya Ltd. said on Jan. 21.  Shares in Equity rose as much as 0.9 percent to 29
shillings, and were trading unchanged from Feb. 25’s close at
28.75 shillings as of 1:21 p.m. in Nairobi today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
