Rising  oil prices  driven by turmoil
in North Africa and the Middle East may undermine eastern  Europe ’s economic recovery because industry in the former
communist region is less energy efficient than in the west.  The CHART OF THE DAY compares energy intensity, the amount
of energy needed to produce 1,000 euros ($1,384) worth of output
expressed as tons of crude oil. Bulgaria needed six times more
energy than the average of the 15 older European Union members,
while Poland is 2 1/2 times less efficient.  “Eastern Europe is dependent on industry, so rising oil
prices are a reason to worry,” said Ales Michl, an economist at
Raiffeisen Bank in Prague. “The region’s recovery is under
threat.”  Oil is trading at a 29-month high after rising 14 percent
last week, the biggest five-day gain in a year. The unrest that
has swept  Africa  and the Middle East, ignited by the ouster of
the Tunisian and Egyptian leaders, has spread to Oman and Libya,
raising concern production may be disrupted further.  All eastern EU economies are set to grow this year, with
Slovakia leading the group at 4.3 percent, the  International
Monetary Fund  forecast in October. Romania, which remained in
recession in 2010, is set to post the slowest growth of 1.5
percent.  Eastern manufacturers need to boost productivity more to
compete as rising commodity prices make output more expensive,
Michl said. Countries which reduced unit labor costs during
recession, such as the  Czech Republic , are in the best shape to
cope with the price shock, Michl said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
