The pressure on consumers from high
unemployment and rising commodity prices can be used as a
strategy to pick stocks, according to UBS AG.  Consumer-staples companies face “a tough environment,”
while global growers and suppliers of equipment to commodity
producers may perform better than other industry groups, Thomas Doerflinger, a New York-based senior strategist, said in a note
today.    Comcast Corp ., CSX Corp., Deere & Co., General Electric
Co., Google Inc., Joy Global Inc. and Coca-Cola Co. are “well-
positioned” in this environment, the strategists said. Dr.
Pepper Snapple Group Inc., Foot Locker Inc., H.J. Heinz Co.,
Heartland Express Inc.,  New York Times Co ., PulteGroup Inc. and
Safeway Inc. are “poorly positioned,” the note said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
