Libyans fleeing the country into  Tunisia  have had “limited access to food” during their

will meet tomorrow with Tunisian government officials to discuss
humanitarian needs arising from civil unrest in Libya, and
regional  food security , the WFP said in a statement on its
website today. More than 40,000 people have crossed the Libyan
border into Tunisia in the past week, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
