The Tokyo Stock Exchange started
updating key indexes every millisecond today from every second
as it seeks to attract more high-frequency traders.  The Topix index, Topix Core 30 Index and Topix 500 Index
will refresh every thousandth of a second, the bourse said in a
statement this month.  High-frequency trading programs and other algorithm-based
systems account for more than 30 percent of daily trading on the
Tokyo exchange,  Atsushi Saito , president of the bourse, told
reporters at a briefing on Feb. 22.  “We aim to welcome more market players with high-frequency
trading with the service,” Saito said at the briefing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
