Hungary plans to cut spending on
disability benefits by 120 billion forint ($605 million) as part

entitled to disability pensions by about 100,000 to reduce
expenditure, the newspaper reported, without citing anyone.  An extra tax of 10 forint on fast food, snacks, sweets and
sugary drinks is planned, levies paid by pharmaceutical
companies will be raised and the prices of some subsidized drugs
increased by as much as 30 percent, Nepszabadsag said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
