European Union carbon permits and
the wider energy complex will probably “take a breather” this
week after last week’s gains, said Bloomberg New Energy Finance.  Carbon permits for December may be little changed this week
at about 15.50 euros a metric ton, rising as high as 15.80 euros
and falling as low as 15.20 euros, London-based New Energy
Finance analysts including Konrad Hanschmidt said today in an e-
mailed research note.  The Carbon Market Insights conference in Amsterdam “is
likely to take some volume out of the market this week and it
will be interesting to see whether traders come back to their
desks with the traditional bullish sentiment on Thursday and
Friday,” Hanschmidt said today by e-mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
