National Aluminium Co.,  India ’s
second-biggest producer, fell the most in more than two years in
Mumbai trading after federal investigators said they arrested
the company’s chairman in a bribery investigation.  The shares fell as much as 8.9 percent, the most since Nov.
18, 2008, to 401.05 rupees and traded at 417 rupees as of 10:15
a.m. local time. The benchmark Sensitive Index of the Bombay
Stock Exchange gained 0.9 percent.  The  Central Bureau of Investigation  detained the chairman
after his wife accepted three 24-carat gold bricks, each
weighing 1 kilogram, from the wife of a person brokering a deal
with a group of companies based in the central province of  Madhya Pradesh , the agency said in a statement on its website
Feb. 25.  India’s mines ministry suspended National Aluminium
Chairman A.K. Srivastava following a CBI probe, according to a
statement on the Press Information Bureau’s website on Feb. 26.  Calls to the mobile phone of Finance Director B.L. Bagra,
who was appointed chairman and managing director of the company
yesterday, went unanswered.  The chairman’s wife was arrested in  New Delhi  after she
deposited the gold in a locker in the Bank of Maharashtra,
according to the statement from the CBI. Investigation of two
lockers resulted in a total haul of 10.2 kilograms of gold and 3
million rupees ($66,200) cash, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
