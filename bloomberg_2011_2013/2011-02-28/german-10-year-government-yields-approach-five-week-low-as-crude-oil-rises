German 10-year bunds fell on
speculation that  oil prices  driven higher by unrest in  Libya  and
the Middle East won’t be enough to derail the economic recovery.  The yield gap between two- and 10-year debt widened to the
most in almost a week as Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis
President  James Bullard  said in an interview on CNBC that the  U.S. economy  “definitely looks brighter” and that oil prices
would have to go “substantially higher” to be a concern to
growth. Treasuries pared gains and the dollar was weaker.
Ireland’s 10-year bonds fell for a fourth-straight day after its
government was toppled at elections.  “The bunds reversed earlier gains after Bullard suggested
the economy is recovering at a decent pace,” said  Peter Chatwell , a fixed-income strategist at Credit Agricole Corporate
& Investment Bank in London. “Given that many in the market
view him as a Fed dove, what he said had a strong impact on the
market.”  Bund yields rose two basis points to 3.17 percent as of
4:36 p.m. in London, after falling as low as 3.12 percent. The
2.5 percent security maturing in January 2021 fell 0.15, or 1.5
euros per 1,000-euro ($1,380) face amount, to 94.395. Two-year
yields were two basis points lower at 1.52 percent.  The yield difference, or spread, between the two securities
widened three basis points to 164 basis points, the most since
Feb. 22.  Crude oil was little changed, reversing an earlier drop of
as much as 1.2 percent. Crude oil futures for April delivery
rose 7 cents to $97.95 a barrel at 10:51 a.m. on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . Earlier it fell as low as $96.71.  Irish Election  “This has not gone on long enough,” Bullard, one of 12
regional Fed bank presidents, said in the interview. “You’d
have to see if this shock is really persistent.”    Europe ’s Stoxx 600 Index rose 0.9 percent and Germany’s  DAX
Index  added 1.2 percent.  Ireland’s 10-year bond yields were little changed at 9.34
percent after rising as much as six basis points to 9.40
percent, the highest since Nov. 30. The country’s Feb. 25
election left Enda Kenny’s Fine Gael party in a position to form
a coalition government with other lawmakers after the ruling
Fianna Fail party suffered its worst-ever defeat. Kenny said he
will seek to lower the 5.8 percent interest rate on the
country’s aid loans from the European Union and the  International Monetary Fund .  Debt Sales  “In the aftermath of the elections in Ireland there’s
uncertainty about what’s going to happen there,” said  Glenn Marci , a strategist at DZ Bank AG in  Frankfurt . Marci said he is
“a bit bearish” for German 10-year bunds “as equities have
recovered quite well in  Germany , that should weigh on the long
end of the curve, where the safe haven flows have until now been
supportive.”    Belgium ’s treasury sold 1.575 billion euros ($2.18 billion)
of bonds due September 2021 at an average yield of 4.245
percent, compared with 4.375 percent when it first sold 3
billion euros of the notes through banks on Jan. 18. Investors
put in bids for 1.45 times the amount sold. The country also
sold 1.122 billion euros of securities due in 2028 and 505
million euros of debt maturing in 2014, the debt agency said.  The German government sold 2.88 billion euros of 12-month
zero-coupon Treasury bills.  Inflation in the 17-nation euro region quickened to 2.3
percent from 2.2 percent in December, the European Union’s
 statistics office  in Luxembourg said today. While that’s below
the initial estimate of 2.4 percent published on Jan. 31, the
January reading is still the fastest since October 2008.  January marks the second straight month that the euro zone
inflation rate breached the  European Central Bank ’s 2 percent
ceiling. The Frankfurt-based central bank has kept its benchmark
interest rate at a record low of 1 percent for almost two years
and is forecast by economists to leave it unchanged again at its
next policy meeting, on March 3.  Spanish Inflation  Three-month Euribor futures were little changed, with the
implied yield at 1.93 percent. It has risen from 1.33 percent at
the end of 2010, as traders added to bets that the ECB will
boost borrowing costs. Eonia forwards show investors expect the
bank will raise its benchmark rate by 25 basis points at its
September meeting, according to Deutsche Bank AG data.    Spain ’s inflation rate accelerated to 3.4 percent in
February, the Madrid-based National Statistics Institute said in
a statement today. That was the fastest rate in more than two
years. The yield on the Spanish 10-year bond fell one basis
point to 5.39 percent.  German  government bonds  handed investors a loss of 1.2
percent this year, compared with 1 percent for French securities
and 0.9 percent for Belgian debt, according to indexes compiled
by Bloomberg and the European Federation of Financial Analysts
Societies. U.S. Treasuries lost 0.1 percent and U.K. gilts 1.4
percent, over the same period, the indexes show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
