  Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd .,  India ’s biggest power-equipment maker, said excise duty
exemption for supplies to large power projects, announced in the
budget, will help the company compete with overseas suppliers.  “This was long due,” Chairman B. Prasada Rao said by
telephone today. “This will make us more competitive.”  India proposes to waive excise duty on locally made
equipment for expansion of mega projects and ultra mega power
projects to bring parity with overseas suppliers, which enjoy
lower import tax and exemption from countervailing duty, Finance
Minister Pranab Mukherjee said in his budget speech today.  Bharat Heavy snapped a four-day decline and gained 1.4
percent, the most since Feb. 17, to 2,001.10 rupees in Mumbai
trading.  More needs to be done to allow local suppliers a “level
playing field, especially against the Chinese,” Rao said.
“This can be done outside the budget.”  A panel of government secretaries had recommended customs
duty of 5 percent on imports of power equipment for new projects
of 1,000 megawatts or more, he said.  Bharat Heavy is increasing its annual capacity to produce
equipment capable of generating 20,000 megawatts by 2012. The
company’s capacity was 15,000 megawatts a year in April.  India has awarded contracts to build four ultra mega power
projects, each with a capacity of 4,000 megawatts.  To contact the reporters on this story:
