Canadian schoolboy Nitish Kumar
became the youngest player in Cricket  World Cup  history in
today’s Group A match against Zimbabwe in Nagpur,  India .  Kumar, aged 16 and 283 days, had to get permission from his
high school in Ontario to take part in the tournament.
Bangladesh’s Talha Jubair, who was 17 years and 70 days old when
he featured against the West Indies in the 2003 World Cup, was
the previous youngest player at cricket’s four-yearly world
championship.  Before the World Cup, Kumar played five one-day
internationals for Canada having made his debut against
Afghanistan in February 2010.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
