(Corrects name of the CEO of Microfinance Institutions
Network in first paragraph.)  Alok Prasad, chief executive officer
of Microfinance Institutions Network, an industry lobby group,
comments on Indian Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee’s proposals
for the sector, announced today in the federal budget.  On the proposed 1 billion rupee ($22 million) microfinance fund
in partnership with the Small Industries  Development Bank  of
India:  “The amount is modest, but it’s a start and could act as a
catalyst for promoting domestic equity inflows into the industry.
In the past, there haven’t been these inflows.”  On Mukherjee’s comments on microfinance:  “The finance minister’s comments are positive and augur
well for the sector. For the first time at the federal
government level, the role played by microfinance institutes in
promoting financial inclusion has been explicitly recognized.”  On microfinance’s capital needs:  “The sector’s needs are so large that even at an average
loan size of 10,000 rupees and a market size of 100 million
households, we’re talking about 1 trillion rupees of credit
demand. For that you need 150 billion rupees of equity at 15
percent capital adequacy ratios. Companies will need to tap the
capital markets and private equity investors to meet those
needs.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
