Madhusudan Kela, chief investment
strategist of Reliance Capital Ltd., comments on India’s budget
and stocks. Reliance Capital Asset Management Ltd., a unit of
Reliance Capital, is  India ’s largest money manager. Kela spoke
in an interview with the Bloomberg UTV television channel.  The Bombay Stock Exchange’s Sensitive Index, or Sensex,
climbed 0.8 percent to 17,846.92 as of 3:09 p.m. in Mumbai
today, on course for its biggest gain since Feb. 21. India will
cut the  budget deficit  to 4.6 percent of its gross domestic
product in the fiscal year ending in March 2012, Finance
Minister Pranab Mukherjee said in his annual budget speech in
parliament today.  On the budget:  “The market was prepared for far worse than what has been
delivered. There was lot of nervousness. It’s a sigh of relief.
The one big event is out of our minds now.”  “The big event has not impacted markets negatively as much
as the market was fearing. All the numbers are below consensus,
whether it’s the net government borrowing, fiscal deficit or the
revenue receipt which is better than what the market was
expecting. The combination of all this is making it look like a
good budget from a markets point of view. That is what market is
cheering about.”  Investment advise:  “Because of this nervousness there’s lot of companies
which are performing very well and have delivered good numbers
over the last two-three quarters but they are still suppressed
in terms of prices. I would advise them to buy selectively.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
