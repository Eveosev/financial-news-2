The Academy Awards attracted 37.6
million television viewers last night, a drop from last year,
when the 3-D film “Avatar” was setting box-office records and
sparking interest in the annual ceremony.  The audience for last night’s Oscars telecast on  Walt
Disney Co .’s ABC declined 9.8 percent from the 41.7 million who
tuned in a year earlier, according to Nielsen Co. data released
today by the network.  The audience for the annual awards show, typically the most
watched U.S. program after the Super Bowl and National Football
League playoffs, waxes and wanes with the popularity of films at
the box office. Last year,  James Cameron ’s “Avatar,” released
in 2009, was one of 10 films nominated for best picture.  In 2010, U.S. box-office sales fell slightly to $10.57
billion, bolstered by higher 3-D ticket prices, while attendance
slid 5.7 percent. In 2011, attendance is down 22 percent.  In last night’s show, hosted by actors  Anne Hathaway  and
James Franco, “The King’s Speech” was crowned best picture and
its leading man,  Colin Firth , won the Oscar for best actor.
Director Tom Hooper and writer David Seidler also captured
statuettes for their work on the film.  The top honors for 2010 films went to pictures made with
modest budgets that went on to produce considerable box-office
profits. “The King’s Speech” was made for $15 million and took
in $237 million in global ticket sales, according to researcher
Box Office Mojo. “Black Swan” cost $13 million and generated
$204 million in ticket sales worldwide.  To contact the reporter on this story:
