James Abraham, managing director and
chief executive officer of  SunBorne Energy Technologies , a solar
power developer backed by billionaire Vinod Khosla, said  India ’s
proposed budget for the fiscal year starting April 1 ignores the
needs of the solar sector.  Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee presented the budget
today, which will be put to a vote in parliament after it is
debated.  Abraham said by e-mail today:  “The Finance Ministry has reduced the import duty on PV
cells and modules to zero, but this ignores the needs of the
solar industry more widely. In photovoltaic, there are other
solar components such as inverters and cables, and the entire
solar thermal components of mirrors, receivers, and solar
turbines have been ignored. Also, as an industry, we will be
relying on imported engineering services provided from
experienced players. This too has been ignored.  ‘‘The surprising increase in the Minimum Alternate Tax to
18.5 percent only hurts the thin returns in the solar industry.  ‘‘I am encouraged by the infrastructure bond fund. The  Finance Ministry  is encouraging foreign funds to invest in
infrastructure by reducing the tax they would pay on their
returns. In solar, funding large-scale deployment remains a
hurdle and such infrastructure bond funds can help. However, I
would have liked to see an solar bond fund, focused specifically
on supporting large-scale deployment of solar plants.’’  To contact the reporter on this story:
