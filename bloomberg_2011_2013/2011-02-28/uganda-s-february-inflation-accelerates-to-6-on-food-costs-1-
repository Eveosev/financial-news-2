  Uganda ’s inflation rate rose to 6
percent in February, the fourth consecutive increase, driven by
fuel and food costs.  Inflation accelerated from 5 percent the month before, the
Uganda Bureau of Statistics said in a statement handed to
reporters in Kampala, the capital, today. Prices rose 1.3
percent in the month.  Food-price inflation accelerated to 8.9 percent in February
from 3.6 percent the month before, with the prices of most
staples from milk to bread increasing, the bureau said. Food
accounts for about 27 percent of the basket. The cost of
gasoline and transport fares also increased in the month, the
bureau said, without giving details.  The underlying inflation rate, which excludes food, fuel,
electricity and metered water, slowed to 5.4 percent from 5.6
percent in January, the bureau said.  World food prices rose to a record in January on higher
dairy, sugar and cereal costs and probably will remain elevated,
the  United Nations  said on Feb. 3. An index of 55 food
commodities climbed 3.4 percent from December, the seventh
straight increase, the UN’s  Food and Agriculture Organization 
said in a report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
