Bankrupt  Lehman Brothers Holdings
Inc. (LEHMQ) ’s payments to advisers should be “reasonable, actual and
necessary,” and the committee overseeing compensation and
expenses should have power to object to monthly fee applications,
according to a court filing by the fee committee.  Lehman Brothers paid its managers and advisers almost
$1.2 billion through January, according to court papers filed
yesterday in  U.S. Bankruptcy Court  in Manhattan.  The fee committee was appointed in 2009 to review payments
by the New York-based firm, which filed for bankruptcy in
September 2008. The overseer’s independent member and head until
January was Kenneth Feinberg, who administers BP Plc’s Gulf of
Mexico oil-spill fund.  The fee committee said it’s asking a judge to approve
changes to its protocol because they will “facilitate the
discharge of the fee committee’s duties and allow for more
efficient and timely resolution of disputes.”  Lehman Brothers became the most expensive bankruptcy to
administer in U.S. history in April 2010, when it topped the
$757 million cost of energy trader Enron Corp.’s three-year
liquidation, according to the database of  Lynn LoPucki , a
bankruptcy law professor at the University of California,  Los
Angeles .  The case is In re Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., 08-13555,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
