Gold prices may average 8 percent
more in 2011 at $1,320 an ounce because of investment demand
driven by risks linked to global economic growth and fiscal
stability, an Australian government agency said.  The price may peak this year before declining, in real
terms, to average around $975 an ounce in 2013, and then
increase to $1,064 in 2016, said the Australian Bureau of
Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences. The appeal of
the metal could weaken in the second half and in 2012 if the  U.S.
economy  improves and the possibility of monetary tightening
increases, it said.  “The assumption of world economic recovery over the next
few years is expected to lead to a reduction in speculative
investment demand,” Abares said in the report. “The appetite
for higher risk assets such as shares and property is likely to
increase.”  Gold climbed about 5.7 percent last month to $1,408.07 an
ounce as of 4:38 p.m. Singapore time yesterday as riots in North
Africa and the Middle East and the toppling of autocratic
leaders in Egypt and  Tunisia  spurred demand for a haven.
Bullion gained 30 percent last year as investors sought to
preserve their wealth against currency debasement.  World mine production is forecast to increase 2 percent to
2,703 metric tons this year, the report said. Australian mine
output may rise 14 percent to 274 tons in 2010-2011 as Newmont
Mining Corp.’s $3 billion Boddington development in Western
Australia ramps up, it said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
