Running back Clinton Portis was cut
by the  Washington  Redskins after seven seasons that produced the
second-most rushing yards and touchdowns in team history.  Portis came to Washington in a trade for cornerback Champ
Bailey in 2004 and ran for 6,824 yards and 46 touchdowns, behind
only Hall of Fame member John Riggins among the franchise’s
running backs.  The National Football League team announced Portis’s
release on its website.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
