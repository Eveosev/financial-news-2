Balram Yadav, managing director of
Godrej Agrovet Ltd., comments on  India ’s federal budget for the
financial year beginning April 1.  India will cut the  budget deficit  to 4.6 percent of its
gross domestic product, Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee said
in his annual budget speech in parliament today. The government
proposes to boost spending on expanding oil-palm plantations and
production of lentils, he said.  Yadav made his comments in an e-mailed statement.  On the budget impact:  “We are happy that the budget included initiatives that
will boost India’s crop and livestock yields. The government has
finally begun to pay serious attention to the livestock sector,
with 3 billion rupees dedicated to the creation of a national
mission for protein supplements.  ‘‘Together with continued funding for pulses and 3 billion
rupees for fodder development, there is a serious attempt being
made to address the crippling protein deficit. We welcome the
allocation of 3 billion rupees for oil-palm cultivation on
60,000 additional hectares, which will help reduce dependence on
imported edible oil.’’  On irrigation:  ‘‘While reduction of import duty on micro-irrigation
products by 2.5 percent was positive, subsidy increases and
infrastructure status should have also been granted, given the
immense future challenge of water scarcity. Finally, another 1
trillion rupees of credit for farmers and 3 percent interest
subvention will help rejuvenate investment across the
agricultural sector, increasing long-term productivity.’’  To contact the reporter on this story:
