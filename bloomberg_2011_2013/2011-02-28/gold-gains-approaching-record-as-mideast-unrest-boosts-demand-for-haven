Gold gained in New York, capping
the best monthly increase since April, as rising inflation and
turmoil in North Africa and the Middle East boosted demand for
an alternative asset.  The U.S. said it will assist Libyan rebels trying to force  Muammar Qaddafi  from power, as pro-democracy protests that have
swept the Arab world spread to Oman and reignited in  Tunisia .
Inflation in the 17-nation euro region quickened to 2.3 percent
in January from 2.2 percent in December, a report showed today.  “Inflation expectations are certainly anchored,”  Andrey Kryuchenkov , an analyst at VTB Capital in London, said today in
a report. There needs to be “escalating geopolitical tensions
for sustained gains to December’s all-time highs and beyond.”  Gold futures for April delivery added 60 cents to close at
$1,409.90 an ounce at 1:42 p.m. on the Comex in New York. The
price gained 5.7 percent in February.  In London, the metal for immediate delivery fell $1.80 to
$1,407.50.  Gold prices rose 30 percent in  New York  last year for a
10th annual gain. The price reached a record $1,432.50 on Dec.
7. Increasing food and commodity prices have contributed to
uprisings in the Middle East and North Africa.  Qaddafi’s Fate  U.S. officials met with their overseas counterparts in
Geneva today to discuss the fate of  Libya , including measures
to pressure Qaddafi out of power and build ties with the
nation’s opposition leaders. The regional unrest that ousted
Tunisian President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali and Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak reached Oman, where protesters clashed
with security forces in the province of Sohar.  “Amid ongoing unrest in North Africa and the Middle East,
it is still quite astonishing that the price of gold has not
profited more,”  Carsten Fritsch , a Frankfurt-based analyst at  Commerzbank AG , said today in a report.  Egypt banned the export of gold until June 30, Al Arabiya
television reported yesterday, without saying where it obtained
the information.  Silver futures for May delivery in New York rose 89.7
cents, or 2.7 percent, to $33.82 an ounce. They climbed to
$34.315 on Feb. 22, the highest price since March 1980.  Palladium futures for June delivery gained $12, or 1.5
percent, to $799.60 an ounce. The metal touched a 10-year high
of $863.70 on Feb. 22. Platinum for April delivery rose $5.80,
or 0.3 percent, to $1,809.20 an ounce.  To contact the reporters on this story:
