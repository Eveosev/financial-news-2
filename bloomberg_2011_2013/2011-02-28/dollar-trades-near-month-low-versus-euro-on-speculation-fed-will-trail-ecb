The dollar fell toward a one-month
low against the euro on speculation Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  will today express concern over the pace of jobs
growth, damping demand for the nation’s assets.  The euro completed a third straight month of gains versus
the greenback in February on prospects European Central Bank
President Jean-Claude Trichet may indicate this week a readiness
to increase  interest rates .  Australia ’s dollar was within 0.5
percent of a record high against its U.S. counterpart after a
report showed Chinese manufacturing growth moderated, easing
pressure on policy makers to raise borrowing costs further to
tame inflation.  “Investors are wary that Bernanke will play down the
recent encouraging signs in the  U.S. economy  in favor of caution
about high unemployment and low underlying inflation,” said  Mike Jones , a currency strategist at Bank of New Zealand Ltd. in
Wellington. “We’ve seen the  U.S. dollar  on the back foot on
expectations the Fed will maintain a relatively loose policy
against rate hikes in the euro-zone. That will continue.”  The dollar fell to $1.3822 per euro at 10:05 a.m. in Tokyo
from $1.3806 in  New York  yesterday, when it reached $1.3856, the
weakest since Feb. 2. It declined to $1.6291 per pound from
$1.6257, after earlier dropping to $1.6299, the least since Nov.
4. The greenback was at 97.12 Canadian cents from 97.16 cents,
after touching 97.06 cents, the lowest level since November
2007.  The yen dropped 0.3 percent to 113.24 per euro from 112.91
yesterday. The Japanese currency declined 0.2 percent to 81.95
yen per dollar from 81.78.  Euro’s 2011 Gain  IntercontinentalExchange Inc.’s Dollar Index, which tracks
the greenback against six of its major counterparts, was little
changed at 76.837 after falling as low as 76.756 yesterday, the
weakest level since Nov. 9. The gauge, which is weighted 57.6
percent on euro movements, declined 1.1 percent in February.  Bernanke is scheduled to deliver the Fed’s semiannual
report on monetary policy today to the Senate Banking Committee
and is due to testify to the House Financial Services Committee
tomorrow. The Fed has kept its benchmark rate at zero to 0.25
percent since December 2008.  In an appearance before legislators on Feb. 9, Bernanke
said the jobless rate is likely to remain high “for some time”
even after it fell in January to a 21-month low.  Focus on Timing  The euro rose for a second day versus the yen before the
ECB, which has kept its key interest rate at 1 percent since May
2009, holds its next policy meeting on March 3. An ECB governing
council member,  Mario Draghi , said on Feb. 26 that inflation
pressures are forcing policy makers to focus more closely on the
timing of future rate increases.    Europe ’s shared currency has risen 1.3 percent this year,
while the dollar has lost 2.3 percent, according to Bloomberg
Correlation-Weighted Currency Indexes, which track the
currencies of 10 developed nations. The dollar dropped yesterday
to the lowest in the indexes since August 2008.  Australia’s dollar traded at $1.0193 from $1.0186
yesterday, and earlier touched $1.0202, nearing a record
$1.0256 reached on Dec. 31. The Aussie was at 83.52 yen from
83.30 yen.    China ’s manufacturing purchasing managers’ index fell to
52.2 last month from 52.9 in January, the National Bureau of
Statistics and the Federation of Logistics and Purchasing said
in a statement. The median estimate of economists in a Bloomberg
News survey was 52.1. A reading exceeding 50 signals an
expansion.  To contact the reporters on this story:
