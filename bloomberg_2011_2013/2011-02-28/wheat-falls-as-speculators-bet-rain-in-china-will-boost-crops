Wheat fell on speculation rainfall
in  China  will boost production in the world’s biggest grower.
Corn and soybeans also dropped.  China’s drought-hit winter-wheat crop received
“widespread” rain in the past three days, according to the
weather bureau and a state ministry. Speculators reduced so-
called net-long positions, or bets on higher prices, by 43
percent in the week to Feb. 22, U.S. Commodities Futures Trading
Commission data show.  “Rainfall has now been reported in several of the drought-
hit regions of Northern China,”  Carsten Fritsch , an analyst at
Commerzbank AG in  Frankfurt , said in an e-mailed report today.  Wheat futures for May delivery fell 5.75 cents, or 0.7
percent, to $8.055 a bushel at 10:12 a.m. London time on the  Chicago  Board of Trade. Futures have declined 4.2 percent this
month, partly on speculation demand would decline amid unrest in
North Africa and the Middle East. Milling wheat for March
delivery declined 0.25 euro, or 0.1 percent, to 258.75 euros
($358) a metric ton.  Corn for May delivery dropped 3.25 cents, or 0.5 percent,
to $7.1875 a bushel. The price is set for a 9 percent gain this
month. May-delivery soybeans declined 12.5 cents, or 0.9
percent, to $13.625 a bushel in Chicago. The most-active
contract has dropped 3.6 percent in February.  “Unrest still rules in this troubled geopolitical context
in North Africa and the Middle East, which is making investors
very prudent in all of the financial markets,” Paris-based farm
adviser Agritel said in a comment on its website today.  Soil moisture in China has improved in the northern region
after as much as 30 millimeters of rain between Feb. 25 and Feb.
27, the China Meteorological Administration said in a statement
on its website yesterday.  About 37.82 million mu (2.5 million hectares) of crops are
suffering from drought compared with the peak of 111.5 million
mu on Feb. 8, the Ministry of Water Resources said today. The
drought situation will continue to be severe if there’s no
widespread rain in the future, the ministry said on its website.  To contact the reporters on this story:
