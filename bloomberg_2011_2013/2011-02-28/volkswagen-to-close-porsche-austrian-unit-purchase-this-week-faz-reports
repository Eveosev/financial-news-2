  Volkswagen AG  will close a deal as
early as tomorrow to purchase the Austrian automotive trading
company held by the Piech and Porsche families, who also have a
controlling interest in Porsche SE, the Frankfurter Allgemeine
Zeitung reported today, citing unidentified sources.  VW, which is paying 3.3 billion euros for the business,
announced last November that the deal would close by Sept. 30 at
the latest. The agreement is part of the larger merger of the
two carmakers.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
