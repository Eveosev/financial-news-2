  China ’s manufacturing purchasing
managers’ index likely fell to 52.1 last month from 52.9 in
January as expansion slowed, according to the median estimate of
14 in a Bloomberg News survey of economists.  A reading of more than 50 indicates manufacturing expanded
rather than contracted. China’s logistics federation is
scheduled to release the number at 9 a.m. local time today.  The HSBC Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index is
scheduled for release at 10:30 a.m. today. A survey of four
economists calls for a reading of 52.5, against 54.5 in January.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
