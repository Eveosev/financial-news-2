Turkish stocks declined and yields
rallied to an eight-month high after a January trade deficit
that was almost double the market forecast for the gap drove
concern inflation could accelerate.  The  ISE National 100 Index  of stocks reversed early gains
and closed 0.1 percent lower at 61,282.87 at 5:30 p.m. in
Istanbul. Bonds fell, sending the yield on two-year bonds 15
basis points higher to 8.78 percent, the highest since June 2010
according to the RBS Istanbul Benchmark Bond Index. The lira
weakened 0.2 percent to 1.6014 per dollar.  The  trade gap  in January was $7.3 billion, 89 percent more
than the same month in 2010 and bigger than the median estimate
of $4.1 billion in a Bloomberg survey of six analysts. The gap
suggests Central bank Governor Durmus Yilmaz’s efforts to
restrain domestic demand aren’t yet working.  “So far the new policy seems ineffective,” Hakan Aklar,
chief economist for AK Investment, said in an e-mailed report.
“Moreover, rising energy prices are compounding the risks on
the trade deficit and inflation.”  Surging  oil prices  driven by Middle East unrest have
created a “brand new scenario” that’s likely to change
Turkey’s inflation forecasts, Yilmaz said Feb. 25. He said the
bank’s forecast of 5.9 percent year-end inflation is likely to
be revised when the bank updates policy on April 28.  Turkey 
imports about 93 percent of its oil.  Crude oil for April delivery declined 21 cents, or 0.2
percent, to $97.67 a barrel at 11:23 a.m. on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . The central bank’s inflation forecasts are
based on oil at $95 a barrel.  To contact the reporters on this story:
