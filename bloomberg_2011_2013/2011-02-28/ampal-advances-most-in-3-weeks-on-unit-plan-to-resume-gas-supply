  Ampal-American Israel  Corp., the
owner of a 12.5 percent stake in East Mediterranean Gas Co.,
rose the most in three weeks after it said the Egyptian gas
supplier would resume exports to Israel “no later than” March
4.  Ampal jumped 5.8 percent, the most since Feb. 8, to 6.95
shekels at 11 a.m. in  Tel Aviv . The stock fell to the lowest
level in almost five months yesterday after TheMarker reported
gas flow would be delayed.  Recent political unrest in Egypt has led to concern Ampal
would have trouble meeting contractual obligations to Israeli
consumers. Egyptian natural gas exports to Israel and Jordan
were halted Feb. 5 after an explosion damaged a pipeline in the
Sinai Desert.  Israeli gas explorers with interests in the country’s Yam
Tethys project and Tamar field declined today. Isramco Negev 2
LP dropped 2.4 percent to 0.415 shekel, Avner Oil Exploration-LP
retreated 1.4 percent to 2.305 shekels and  Delek Group Ltd .
slipped 0.1 percent to 872.80 shekels.  To contact the reporter on this story:
