  Zurich Financial Services AG ,  Switzerland ’s biggest insurer, sold a 5 percent stake in New
China Life Insurance Co. to undisclosed buyers.  That cut the insurer’s holding to 15 percent from 20
percent, an interest that it valued earlier this month at about
$1 billion, the Zurich-based company said today in an e-mailed
statement. The sale price was “slightly above the respective
book value” at the end of December, Zurich said, without
providing that figure.  The sale “reflects a desire to manage our financial
exposure to a business we do not control while retaining our
belief that China’s fast-growing insurance sector represents a
highly attractive investment opportunity for Zurich,” Chief
Executive Officer Martin Senn said in the statement. “We
continue to focus on building our own insurance business in this
important growth market.”  Zurich, which started investing in the closely held Chinese
insurer in 2000, said in October it would buy as much as $420
million of New  China  Life shares to keep its stake at about 20
percent after a rights offer. Zurich expects the sale of the 5
percent stake to close in the second quarter of this year.  New China Life had gross written premiums of $13.8 billion
last year and an 8.9 percent share of the Chinese life-insurance
market at the end of December, Zurich said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
