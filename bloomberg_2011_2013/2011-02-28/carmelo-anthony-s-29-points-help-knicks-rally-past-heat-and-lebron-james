  Carmelo Anthony  scored a game-high
29 points to lead the  New York Knicks  to a 91-86 road win over  LeBron James  and the  Miami Heat  in the teams’ first meeting
since Anthony was traded to New York.  In his third game for the Knicks and first against one of
the  National Basketball Association ’s elite clubs, Anthony hit
10 of 22 shots and grabbed nine rebounds at AmericanAirlines
Arena in Miami last night. The Knicks improved to 30-27 on the
season and dropped the Heat to 43-17, the second-best record in
the Eastern Conference.  The Knicks, who rallied from a 15-point first-half deficit,
are 2-1 since getting Anthony last week from the Denver Nuggets.
Knicks owner James Dolan pushed for the trade, seeking to
revitalize a franchise that hasn’t had a winning season in 10
years and failed in the offseason to get James as a free agent.  “When I made this move, I wanted to take on challenges,”
Anthony said after the game, which was televised nationally by
Walt Disney Co.’s ESPN. “This was a big challenge for me, a big
challenge for us defensively, and we stood up to that.”  The victory came two days after a 115-109 loss in  Cleveland 
to a Cavaliers team with the worst record in the NBA.  “We came back and redeemed ourselves big time in a hostile
environment against one of the better teams in the NBA,”
Anthony said. “A lot of people say they might be the best team
in the NBA. That loss in Cleveland, although it was only our
second game together, it hurt.”  Knicks Comeback  The Knicks gave up 34 points in the opening quarter last
night and trailed the Heat 51-36 with 4:24 left in the first
half. New York then went on a 16-0 scoring run and took a 52-51
halftime lead when Bill Walker banked in a 3-point shot with no
time on the clock.  The Knicks again rallied in the fourth quarter, erasing an
82-76 deficit with 3:04 remaining.  Point guard Chauncey Billups, who came to  New York  in the
Anthony trade, hit a 3-pointer with one minute left that gave
the Knicks an 85-84 lead. The 13-year veteran followed with a
steal that led to a pair of Knicks free throws.  With New York clinging to an 87-86 lead, Amar’e Stoudemire
blocked a layup attempt by James with seven seconds left. James,
who joined Miami in July along with  Chris Bosh , led the Heat
with 27 points. Anthony covered James defensively for the final
7 1/2 minutes.  “We just didn’t execute down the stretch,” Bosh, who had
20 points and 12 rebounds, said at a news conference. “That
can’t happen against a good offensive team like that.”  Wade 5-of-15    Dwyane Wade  added 12 points on 5-of-15 shooting for the
Heat, who have lost two of their past three games.  Stoudemire had 16 points and 10 rebounds for New York.  Billups, the NBA Finals Most Valuable Player for  Detroit  in
2004, chipped in with 16 points for the Knicks and said the
game’s intensity reminded him of the Pistons’ matchups against
the Heat in the Eastern Conference finals in 2005-06.  Now Billups is seeking to help the Knicks rekindle their
own rivalry with the Heat. New York and Miami met in the
playoffs four straight years from 1997-2000, with all four
series going the maximum number of games.  “It really felt like a playoff game,” Billups said. “It
was high intensity out there and a good feeling.”  The Knicks, who last had a winning season in 2000-01, face
another of Eastern Conference’s better teams tomorrow when they
visit the 37-22  Orlando Magic .  “We’ve got a long ways to go, but we wanted to play a hard
game,” said Anthony. “We got all the loose basketballs, all
the rebounds that we needed to get down the stretch, and we made
a couple big plays on the defensive end.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
