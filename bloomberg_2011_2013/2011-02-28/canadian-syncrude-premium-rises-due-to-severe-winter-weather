Severe winter weather in  Canada  has
helped boost the price for Syncrude oil to the largest premium
in almost four years.  Light crudes, such as Syncrude, are used to dilute heavier
oils, which helps them move through pipelines from Alberta to
refineries in the U.S.  The premium for Syncrude rose against West Texas
Intermediate, gaining $1.85 to $10 a barrel, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg at 2:07 p.m. in  New York , the highest
level since April 2007. Syncrude is a light, low-sulfur
synthetic oil derived from the  tar sands  in Alberta.  “There are brutally cold temperatures out in western
Canada and this is going to be one of the coldest Marches
ever,” said David Phillips, senior climatologist for
Environment Canada.  The temperature in  Edmonton , Alberta, was minus 11
Fahrenheit (minus 24 Celsius) as of 2:30 p.m. New York time,
according to Environment Canada. In Calgary, the temperature was
minus 9, and it was minus 7.6 in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan.  Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium narrowed 95 cents to $18.55
a barrel at 2:07 p.m. Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium to WTI
weakened 75 cents to $18.25.  Among Gulf Coast sour, or high-sulfur, grades, Mars Blend’s
premium to WTI weakened $2.15 to $12.85 a barrel, while
Poseidon’s premium narrowed $2.75 to $12.75 over the benchmark.  Thunder Horse’s premium to WTI narrowed $1.25 to $17.25.
Southern Green Canyon’s premium narrowed $1.75 to $12.25.  West Texas Sour’s discount narrowed 10 cents to $3.75. WTS
is delivered in Midland,  Texas , so its price is less influenced
by imports.  The discount for Western Canada Select narrowed $2.25 to
$24.  To contact the reporters on this story:  Aaron Clark  in New York at
