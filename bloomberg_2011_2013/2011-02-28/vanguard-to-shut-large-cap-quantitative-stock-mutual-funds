Vanguard Group Inc., the world’s
largest mutual fund manager, said it will close two funds that
use mathematical models to pick stocks.  The boards of Structured Large-Cap Growth Fund and
Structured Large-Cap Value Fund voted on Feb. 25 to dissolve
them on or about May 31, the  Valley Forge , Pennsylvania-based
company said today in a  filing  with the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission. The funds hold a combined $12 million,  Rebecca Katz , a Vanguard spokeswoman, said in an interview.  Structured Growth returned an average of 2.8 percent
annually in the three years ended Feb. 25, including reinvested
dividends, compared with 3.4 percent for Vanguard’s Growth Index
Fund, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Structured Value
lost an average of 7.2 percent in the three years through Dec.
16, the last dates for which return data were available.
Vanguard’s Value Index Fund lost an average of 4.9 percent in
that period.  The closure was “a rare admission of defeat” for the
firm, Dan Wiener, editor of Independent Adviser for Vanguard
Investors, a New York-based newsletter, said in an e-mail. The
filing was first reported by Wiener.  Vanguard removed Axa Rosenberg Group LLC, a quantitative
investing unit of Paris-based insurer  Axa SA , as manager of
three other  mutual funds  in August after Axa disclosed
programming errors that disrupted its investment process.
Vanguard manages about $1.6 trillion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
