  Acciona SA ,  Spain ’s second-biggest
wind-farm owner, posted full-year net income that beat analysts’
estimates, helped by a wider profit margin.  Net income from continuing activities rose 12 percent
percent to 167 million euros ($231 million) in 2010, the Madrid-
based company said in a statement today. Sales declined to 6.26
billion euros from 6.52 billion euros. The average estimates of
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg were for profit of 148 million
euros and revenue of 6.53 billion euros.  Acciona expects “double digit growth” in earnings before
interest taxes, depreciation and amortization, Chief Executive
Officer Jose Manuel Entrecanales said today at an analysts’
conference. Ebitda rose 16 percent to 1.21 billion euros last
year, raising the margin to 19 percent of sales from 16 percent
in 2009. Acciona will spend 197 million euros of 2010 profit on
dividends.  “The company is looking good this year after a much more
complicated operating and regulatory environment,” Javier Ruiz- Capillas, an analyst at Kepler Capital Markets based in  Madrid ,
said by phone today. “The international operations offset the
domestic weakness in construction and margins aren’t declining.
Overall I like the numbers.”  Acciona rose 3.9 percent to 70.49 euros in Madrid trading,
the biggest gain since Feb. 1 and the highest closing price
since May 3. The stock has gained 33 percent this year, valuing
the company at 4.48 billion euros.  Acciona’s energy division accounted for 67 percent of total
Ebitda.  Wind Power Plans  The company said last week it agreed to sell a 15 percent
stake in Acciona Termosolar SL to Mitsubishi Corp. for 45.8
million euros including debt.  Entrecanales said the company is talking to potential
investors and potential partners as it seeks to form strategic
alliances to boost its wind-power unit. Acciona is interested in
making this division larger in order to compete with big
competitors in the industry instead of selling it off, he said.  This year’s capital expenditure will be higher than that of
2010 and “slightly” above 1 billion euros, the executive said.
The company’s net debt dropped to 6.59 billion euros in 2010
from 7.27 billion euros a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
