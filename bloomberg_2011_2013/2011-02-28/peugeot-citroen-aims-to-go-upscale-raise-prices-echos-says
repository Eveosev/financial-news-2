PSA Peugeot Citroen is aiming to
reposition both its Peugeot and Citroen brands so it can
increase average pricing,  Les Echos  said, citing Jean-Marc
Gales, sales chief for the two brands.  The strategy doesn’t entail price rises for the mainstream
Peugeot 308, but within three or four years average prices for
the two brands may rise as the company positions more cars in
the “premium” category, the newspaper said.  Pricing rose slightly in 2010 and prices will rise
significantly more this year, Gales said, according to Echos.
The company aims to sell 120,000 of its 508 model, which will
cost more than the 407 it replaced, the executive was cited as
saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
