  China  is willing to strengthen a
fund designed to help provide lending to Greek ship owners who
wish to order new vessels from Chinese yards, Greece’s Maritime
Affairs Minister Yiannis Diamantidis said.  China has expressed willingness to increase the size of the
fund to between $8 billion and $10 billion, the Minister said
during a visit to China, according to a statement on the website
of the Piraeus-based  Maritime Affairs Ministry .  China also acknowledges Greece’s request for a
corresponding increase in the hiring of Greek-owned ships by
Chinese shipping companies, which will create a “win-win”
situation for Greek ship owners, according to the statement.  A $5 billion shipping fund will be set up to strengthen
relations between the countries’ maritime industries and
facilitate the sale of Chinese-built ships to Greeks, Chinese
Premier  Wen Jiabao  said in October during a visit to  Athens .  To contact the reporter on this story:
