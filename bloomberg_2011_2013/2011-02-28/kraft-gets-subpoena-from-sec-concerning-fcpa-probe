  Kraft Foods Inc. (KFT) , the world’s
second-biggest food company, said it received a subpoena this
month from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission tied to
an investigation of corporate practices in  India .  The probe, conducted in connection with the Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act, concerns a facility Kraft got as part of its
takeover of British confectioner Cadbury Plc last year,
according to a regulatory filing today. The SEC wants
information on dealings with Indian government agencies.  Kraft received the subpoena Feb. 1, according to the
filing. The company said it’s cooperating with the U.S.
government in its investigation. The Foreign Corrupt Practices
Act bars corrupt payments to foreign officials for obtaining or
keeping business.    Michael Mitchell , a spokesman for Northfield, Illinois-
based Kraft, declined to comment, as did  John Nester , a
spokesman for the SEC. Kraft, led by Chief Executive Officer
Irene Rosenfeld, counts Oreo cookies and Trident gum among its
products.  Kraft rose 13 cents to $31.84 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading. The shares have gained 1 percent
this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
