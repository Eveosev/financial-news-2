SUAL Partners, led by billionaires  Viktor Vekselberg  and Leonard Blavatnik, is seeking to sell its
15.8 percent stake in United Co. Rusal, Vedomosti  reported ,
citing unidentified people.  The move is driven by a dispute with Rusal billionaire
Chief Executive Officer Oleg Deripaska, who is declining to sell
the companyâ€™s stake in OAO GMK Norilsk Nickel with a premium to
market, while SUAL favours the sale, the Moscow-based newspaper
said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
