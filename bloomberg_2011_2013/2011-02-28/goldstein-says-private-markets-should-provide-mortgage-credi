The U.S. housing finance system
needs an overhaul to reduce the role of government and
taxpayers’ losses, Treasury Department Undersecretary Jeffrey Goldstein said today.  “The administration is committed to a system in which the
private market -- subject to strong oversight and strong
consumer and investor protections -- is the primary source of
mortgage credit,” Goldstein said in prepared remarks for a
speech to the  Credit Union National Association  in Washington.  “We are committed to a system in which the private market
-- not American taxpayers -- will bear the burden for losses,”
Goldstein said.  The Treasury will work with the Federal Housing Finance
Administration to rein in  Fannie Mae  and  Freddie Mac , the
housing finance companies that have been in government
conservatorship since 2008, Goldstein said. Tools include
“gradually” increasing guarantee fees, raising capital
standards and requiring higher down payments from borrowers.  To contact the reporters on this story:
