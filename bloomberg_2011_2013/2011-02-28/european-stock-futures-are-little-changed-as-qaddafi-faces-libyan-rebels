ruler. U.S. futures and Asian shares advanced.    Syngenta AG  jumped 3.8 percent after the Indian government
announced tax breaks for investments in fertilizer projects and

chemicals.  HSBC Holdings Plc  tumbled 5.2 percent after posting
full-year net income that missed analysts’ estimates.  The Stoxx 600 rose 0.5 percent to 285.63 at 12:38 p.m. The
index sank 2.4 percent last week as Qaddafi’s opponents seized
control of large parts of the country. The Stoxx 600 has
advanced 2 percent in February, on course for its third straight
monthly gain, as companies reported better-than-estimated
earnings.  “When uncertainty can’t be lifted, visibility isn’t
easy,” said Emmanuel Soupre, who helps oversee $6.6 billion at
Neuflize Private Assets in Paris. “The concern is if the
problem lasts too long and there’s economic uncertainty, there
will be questions about the level of activity in the countries
involved and tension on  oil prices  will remain.”  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index climbed 0.4
percent to 1,323.5, while the MSCI Asia Pacific Index advanced
0.5 percent.  Fifty-seven percent of Stoxx 600 companies that have
reported earnings since Jan. 10 have beaten the average analyst
estimate of their per-share earnings. The European benchmark is
valued at 13 times the reported earnings of its constituents,
the gauge’s lowest historic price-to-earnings ratio since March
2009, when the measure reached its lowest level in 13 years.  Libyan Opposition  In Libya, rebels established a transitional authority with
Qaddafi’s former Justice Minister Moustafa Abdel Jalil as its
head. Last week, Qaddafi vowed to fight until his “last drop of
blood,” sending oil prices soaring as investors speculated that
the conflict will further disrupt  Libya ’s oil production.  Syngenta, the biggest maker of agricultural chemicals,
jumped 3.8 percent to 315.10 Swiss francs.  India  will give tax
breaks to investments in the nation’s fertilizer industry,

largest recruitment agency posted a first-half profit after what

region.  HSBC slumped 5.2 percent to 674.4 pence, the largest

net income of $13.2 billion, missing the $13.72 billion median
estimate of 15 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Bad loan

industry groups in the Stoxx 600.  AB Foods Falls    Associated British Foods Plc  slid 5.8 percent to 967 pence
after the company said that sales at its Primark clothing stores
in the U.K. have slowed this year as consumers cut back on
spending.  “Since the New Year, the performance in all our operations
in Continental Europe has been very encouraging, but there has
been a noticeable slowing down of U.K. consumer demand,” AB
Foods said in the statement.  Bank of Cyprus Pcl sank 7.5 percent to 2.83 euros. The
