  Transocean Ltd ., the world’s largest
offshore oil driller, may attempt to recover some or all of the
Deepwater Horizon rig that exploded and sank during last year’s
Macondo well disaster.  The wreckage, about a mile beneath the surface of the Gulf
of Mexico, was surveyed in response to a Dec. 6 request from the
U.S. Coast Guard to remove diesel fuel that remains trapped in
tanks aboard the rig, Transocean said today in a public filing.  The company is reviewing the results of the survey and has
a $140 million wreck-removal insurance policy to cover the
costs, according to the filing.  BP Plc’s Macondo well erupted in April, killing 11 rig
workers, injuring 17 and triggering the most-extensive offshore
crude spill in U.S. history. BP was leasing the vessel from
Vernier, Switzerland-based Transocean for about $500,000 a day
at the time of the catastrophe.  Transocean rose $1.83, or 2.21 percent, to $84.63 at 4:00
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares
lost 10 percent of their value since the April 20 incident.  Last week, Transocean posted its biggest quarterly loss in
eight years after a surfeit of rigs used to drill for natural
gas in coastal waters reduced rental rates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
