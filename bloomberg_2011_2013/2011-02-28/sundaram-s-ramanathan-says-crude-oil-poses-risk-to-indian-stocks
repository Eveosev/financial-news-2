Satish Ramanathan, head of equities
in the southern Indian city of Chennai at Sundaram Mutual, which
manages $3.2 billion in assets, comments on  India ’s budget and
stocks. He made the remarks by telephone today.  The Bombay Stock Exchange’s Sensitive Index, or Sensex,
climbed 0.7 percent today. India will cut the  budget deficit  to
4.6 percent of its gross domestic product in the fiscal year
ending in March 2012, Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee said in
his annual budget speech in parliament today.  On fiscal deficit and budget:  “The question is whether the fiscal deficit can be
achieved or not. That’s something we need to watch for. Today,
it’s positive, but tomorrow is a brand new day, when the
external variables will start playing out. The risk is of oil
spiking and impacting growth. The internal variables are
positive but the external variables need to be factored in as
well.”  On investment strategy:  “Our investment strategy remains unchanged. We still look
at domestic consumption as a powerful theme. That is something
we will still focus on. There’s low clarity on infrastructure.
There’s a problem on infrastructure implementation. That’s
something we are not able to take a view on.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
