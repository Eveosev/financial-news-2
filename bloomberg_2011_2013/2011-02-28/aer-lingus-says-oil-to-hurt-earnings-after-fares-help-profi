  Aer Lingus  Group Plc, Ireland’s
second-largest airline, said rising fuel prices will hold back
earnings this year after higher fares and reduced spending
helped the carrier post its first profit in three years.  Net income was 46.6 million euros ($64.4 million) in 2010
compared with a loss of 130.1 million euros a year earlier, the
Dublin-based carrier said in a statement today. Sales rose 0.8
percent to 1.22 billion euros.  Increases in ticket prices and the company’s cost-savings
program are unlikely to offset the effects of fuel and airport
fees on profit, Chief Executive Officer Christoph Mueller said
in the statement. The price of oil, trading at $99.15 a barrel
today, has surged amid concern that the turmoil in  Libya  will
reduce supplies.  “The outlook is very, very conservative and very
cautious,” said  Joe Gill , an analyst at Bloxham Securities in
Dublin who has an “overweight” recommendation on Aer Lingus
stock. “With oil at $100 a barrel, it does cast a shadow over
your guidance.”  Aer Lingus fell as much as 1.6 percent to 93 cents as of
9:57 a.m. in Dublin trading. The stock has dropped 14 percent
this year, valuing the carrier at 497 million euros.  The airline has hedging agreements protecting it from fuel-
price shifts 18 to 24 months in advance, and has covered 62
percent of its needs for this year at an average $788 a ton,
Chief Financial Officer Andrew MacFarlane said today on a call
with reporters. Jet fuel traded in northwest  Europe  cost $1,015
a ton on Feb. 25.  Seating Cutbacks  The carrier slashed seat capacity 14 percent, led by a 24
percent reduction on long-haul services as Aer Lingus scaled
back its trans-Atlantic schedule, and as the company made
cutbacks at  London ’s Gatwick airport. The moves were part of Aer
Lingus’s so-called Greenfield cost-reduction program introduced
at the end of 2009.  The average yield per passenger, a measure of ticket
prices, rose 12 percent to 107.12 euros, with any increases this
year likely to be “much smaller,” the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
