Hungarian Economy Minister  Gyorgy
Matolcsy  will announce tomorrow budget savings that will reach
an annual 902 billion forint ($4.6 billion) from 2013, HVG
weekly said on its website citing unnamed ruling party sources.  The government plans to improve the budget balance by 550
billion forint in 2012 and by 902 billion forint annually in
2013 and 2014, HVG said. Matolcsy will make an official
announcement tomorrow at 11 a.m. in Budapest.  The Cabinet aims to use 63 percent of funds in private
pension portfolios, which it funneled to the budget, to reduce
the debt level to between 65 percent and 70 percent of gross
domestic product, from the current 80 percent, HVG said without
giving a time frame.  The budget balance may improve from 2013 by as much as 213
billion forint annually as a result of “employment policies,”
by 129 billion forint from “further pension reforms,” by 60
billion forint from savings in public transportation spending
and by 38 billion forint in savings in higher education. The
Cabinet also plans to cut drug subsidies by 120 billion forint
annually from 2013, HVG said. The savings would start in 2012
and peak in 2013 and 2014, according to the weekly.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
