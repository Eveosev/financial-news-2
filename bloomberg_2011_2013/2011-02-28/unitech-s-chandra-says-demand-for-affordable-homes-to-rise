Sanjay Chandra, managing director at  Unitech Ltd ., India’s second-biggest developer, comments on  India ’s budget.  India will cut the  budget deficit  to 4.6 percent of its
gross domestic product in the fiscal year ending in March 2012,
Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee said in his annual budget
speech in parliament today. India will extend an interest rate
subsidy on housing loans, Mukherjee said.  “We welcome the measures announced in the Union Budget
2011 to promote the development of affordable housing. Measures
such as expanding the coverage of interest subvention to a loan
of 1.5 million rupees for a house costing 2.5 million rupees,
providing 100 percent deduction in respect of capital
expenditure incurred on development of affordable housing, will
certainly aid in boosting the demand and development of
affordable housing in the coming months.  In 2009, Unitech recalibrated its strategy in order to
attain our goal of achieving leadership in the residential
housing segment by introducing affordable housing as a product
offering under the ‘Unihomes’ brand. Our recent launches of
Unihomes in cities such as Rewari, Mohali, Chennai, Noida and
Bhopal has met with an encouraging response from the genuine
buyers. With the new measures announced in the budget, we
believe that the pace of demand will be robust and we are well
poised to respond to this demand.”  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
