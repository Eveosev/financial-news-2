Spain’s  IBEX 35 index  advanced for a
third day, adding 28.1, or 0.3 percent, to 10,850.8 at the 5:30
p.m. close in Madrid. The benchmark measure had a monthly gain
of 0.4 percent. The Madrid Stock Exchange General Index also
climbed 0.3 percent today.  The following were among the most active stocks in the
Spanish market. Symbols are in parentheses after company names.    Acciona SA  (ANA SM) climbed for a third day, adding 3.9
percent to 70.49 euros. The renewable energy developer posted
2010 net income of 167.2 million euros ($231.4 million), beating
the average analyst estimate for profit of 148 million euros.
Sales declined to 6.26 billion euros from 6.52 billion euros,
Acciona said in a regulatory filing.    Cementos Portland Valderrivas SA  (CPL SM) dropped 1.3
percent to 15.50 euros, erasing Feb. 25’s gain. The Spanish
company said 2010 net income fell to 1.2 million euros from 24
million euros in 2009. Sales decreased 14 percent to 887 million
euros and the company said it won’t pay a dividend on its 2010
results.    Cie Automotive SA  (CIE SM) advanced 0.3 percent to 5.01
euros, extending Feb. 25’s gain. The Spanish car-parts maker
said 2010 net income climbed to 41.4 million euros from 11.1
million euros a year earlier. Sales increased to 1.59 billion
euros from 1.15 billion euros.    Ebro Foods SA  (EBRO SM) climbed 3.3 percent to 15.89 euros,
the steepest increase in three months. The food company said
2010 net income rose to 388.8 million euros from 176.5 million
euros in 2009. Ebro posted sales of 1.7 billion euros, compared
with 1.77 billion euros a year earlier. Analysts had predicted
net income of 374 million euros, according to a Bloomberg News
survey.    Nicolas Correa SA  (NEA SM) surged 4.1 percent to 2.16
euros, the stock’s third-straight gain. The Spanish company said
its 2010 net loss widened to 8.59 million euros from 5 million
euros a year earlier. Sales fell to 31.1 million euros from 55
million euros a year earlier, it said in a regulatory filing.    Prim SA  (PRM SM) advanced for a third day, gaining 3.8
percent to 5.46 euros. Spain’s only publicly traded supplier of
medical products posted net income of 11.5 million euros in
2010, compared with 10 million euros a year earlier. Sales
declined to 95.1 million euros from 95.5 million euros a year
earlier, the company said in a regulatory filing.    Tubos Reunidos SA  (TRG SM) soared for a second day, jumping
6.8 percent to 2.05 euros, the stock’s steepest increase in more
than nine months. The Spanish company said its factories are
working at “full capacity,” as Tubos forecast an increase in
sales and profit in 2011 that may allow it to pay a dividend
this year. Tubos Reunidos posted a net loss of 14.2 million
euros in 2010, compared with net income of 1.1 million euros in
2009.    Vertice Trescientos Sesenta Grados SA  (VER SM) fell 1.5
percent to 26 euro cents even after it posted 2010 profit of
711,000 euros compared with a loss of 18.3 million euros in
2009. That missed one analyst’s estimate for a 1.9 million-euro
profit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
