  India ’s  National Commodity &
Derivatives Exchange Ltd. , the nation’s top bourse for trading
farm goods, raised open-interest limits on some commodities.  Caps have been increased in 17 contracts including wheat,
soybeans, pepper, turmeric and potatoes after a review by the
regulator, the Forward Markets Commission, Vijay Kumar, chief
business officer at the bourse, said in a phone interview today.  “If the limits are too small, then there is not
necessarily enough trading interest and that in turn effects
depth and liquidity in the contract,” Kumar said. “You need
certain level of position limits to further build liquidity and
permit more hedging in these contracts.”  The Multi Commodity Exchange of India Ltd., the country’s
biggest such bourse, also revised open-interest limits on 13
farm commodities, it said in a note on Feb. 25.  The new limits are also meant to ensure that “no one
individual or group can actually have positions that constitute
a significant share of the market,” Kumar said.  ---Editor: Ravil Shirodkar  To contact the reporter on this story:
