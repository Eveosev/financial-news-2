U.S. stocks advanced, extending a
third straight monthly gain for benchmark indexes, amid
improving economic data and billionaire investor Warren Buffett’s desire to make more acquisitions.    Berkshire Hathaway Inc .’s Class B shares rose 2.8 percent
as Buffett’s company said profit jumped 43 percent to the
highest since 2007. Stocks of phone and utilities companies led
the gains in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, adding at least 1
percent.  Walgreen Co . climbed 3.3 percent after Morgan Stanley
raised its share-price estimate for the largest U.S. drugstore
chain.  Intel Corp . fell 1.8 percent as JPMorgan Chase & Co. said
the largest chipmaker may miss revenue estimates.  The S&P 500 advanced 0.6 percent to 1,327.22 at 4 p.m. in
New York, rallying for a second straight day. The  Dow Jones
Industrial Average  gained 95.89 points, or 0.8 percent, to
12,226.34. Crude oil fell the most in two weeks as  Saudi Arabia 
offered to make up for supplies lost because of unrest in  Libya .    Warren Buffett  is always out there to buy companies at
the right price,” said E. William Stone, who oversees about
$105 billion as chief investment strategist at PNC Wealth
Management in Philadelphia. “He has enough cash to do what he
wants to do. On top of that, the economy continues to recover
and earnings will not be affected by the situation in  oil
prices . We see pressure coming off the oil market.”  Corporate Profits  The S&P 500 rose 3.2 percent this month, extending this
year’s gain to 5.5 percent, amid government measures to
stimulate the economy and higher-than-estimated corporate
earnings. Per-share profit topped estimates at 71 percent of the
460 companies in the  S&P 500  that have reported results since
Jan. 10, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The first trading day of the month is historically better
than average for the U.S. stock market and it has been
profitable in recent months. The three biggest gains in the past
seven months -- and 5 of the 25 biggest rallies in 2010 --
occurred on the first trading day of the month and followed
higher-than-estimated readings from the Institute for Supply
Management’s monthly manufacturing gauge.  Factories remain a bulwark to the expansion. The Tempe,
Arizona-based Institute for Supply Management’s manufacturing
index, due tomorrow, rose to 61 in February, the highest level
since May 2004, economists forecast in the Bloomberg survey.
Readings greater than 50 signal growth.  Personal Incomes  Stock-index futures maintained gains before the open of
exchanges as government data showed personal incomes climbed 1
percent, more than the 0.4 percent median estimate in a
Bloomberg News survey of economists, reflecting the tax-cut
compromise reached by President  Barack Obama  and Congressional
Republicans in December.  Stocks also rose after the Institute for Supply Management-
Chicago Inc. said today its business barometer increased to 71.2
this month, the highest level since July 1988, from 68.8 in
January. Figures greater than 50 signal expansion. The gauge was
projected to fall to 67.5, according to the median estimate of
52 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.  Federal Reserve Bank of New York President  William Dudley 
said the “considerably brighter” economic outlook isn’t yet
reason for the central bank to withdraw its record monetary
stimulus. Dudley spoke today in a speech in  New York .  Berkshire Hathaway Class B shares increased 2.8 percent to
$87.28 and Class A shares rose 2.9 percent to $131,300. Fourth-
quarter net income advanced to $4.38 billion, or $2,656 per
share, from $3.06 billion, or $1,969, a year earlier, Omaha,
Nebraska-based Berkshire said on its website.  ‘Trigger Finger’  Buffett said his “trigger finger is itchy” for takeovers
after cash holdings at his Berkshire Hathaway climbed to $38.2
billion. “Our elephant gun has been reloaded,” Buffett said on
Feb. 26 in his  annual letter  to shareholders.  “It’s another positive influence for confidence,” said
Liam Dalton, New York-based president of Axiom Capital
Management Inc., which oversees $1.4 billion. “It supports a
lot of what we’re dealing with right now -- improving data in
the real economy. A Buffett remark perpetuates that trend.”  Announced takeovers of U.S. companies have totaled $164.68
billion so far in 2011, 66 percent more than the $97.4 billion
announced through this date last year, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Buffett has shifted his takeover strategy as Berkshire has
grown to focus more on “capital intensive businesses,” such as
power producers and railroads, which require consistent
investment in infrastructure and equipment.  Failing Textile Mill  Buffett, who built Berkshire over four decades from a
failing textile mill to a $210 billion seller of energy,
insurance and consumer goods, told investors in his annual
letter on Feb. 26 that the firm spent $6 billion on property and
equipment last year, demonstrating “our enthusiasm for  capital
investment .”  “Can we put it to work intelligently, if not
brilliantly?” Buffett said at Berkshire’s annual meeting in
May. “We think it makes sense to go into the capital-intensive
businesses we have. And it’s worked quite well.”  Gains in the S&P 500 were driven by companies that are
least-dependent on economic growth. Phone companies had the
biggest gain in the S&P 500, rising 1.5 percent, followed by
gains in a gauge of  utility companies , which added 1 percent.  Walgreen rose 3.3 percent to $43.34. Morgan Stanley boosted
its share-price estimate to $50 from $44, while raising its
second-quarter profit forecast citing stronger-than-estimated
sales stemming from flu trends. Morgan Stanley also said it
expects Walgreen stock to rise over the next 30 days.  Humana, Nationwide Health    Humana Inc . rose 3.9 percent to $65.01. The biggest
provider of U.S.-backed health benefits boosted its full-year
per-share profit forecast to $5.95 to $6.15. The shares were
raised to “buy” from “hold” at Stifel Nicolaus.    Nationwide Health Properties Inc . jumped 9.7 percent, the
most in the Russell 1000 Index, to $42.74.  Ventas Inc ., the
second-biggest U.S. health-care real estate investment trust by
market value, agreed to buy Nationwide Health for about $5.7
billion. Ventas slid 3.1 percent to $55.42.  A gauge of chipmakers in the S&P 500 declined the most
among 24 industries, dropping 1.3 percent. Intel fell 1.8
percent, the most in the Dow, to $21.47. JPMorgan said the
company is at risk of missing revenue estimates. Separately,
JPMorgan cut its forecast for growth in the personal computer
industry, citing softening demand in  China .  Amazon.com Slumps    Amazon.com Inc . lost 2.2 percent to $173.29. UBS AG
downgraded the stock to “neutral” from “buy,” citing
potential margin pressures because of a more prolonged
investment period and free subscription streaming. UBS also
reduced its 12-month share-price estimate to $180 from $195.  Barclays Plc forecast the S&P 500 will advance to 1,450 in
2011, up from a previous prediction of 1,420. Barry Knapp, the
New York-based chief equity strategist for the firm, lifted his
2011 profit estimate for the benchmark gauge to $93 a share from
$91, citing better-than-estimated fourth-quarter earnings and
increased confidence in the financial sector.  Kenneth Cole Productions Inc. and  Timberline Resources
Corp . were among the first stocks to have short selling
restricted today under a regulation aimed at preventing bearish
bets from snowballing.  By forcing speculators who want to bet on declines to wait,
regulators are seeking to keep the market from being overwhelmed
with sell orders that may feed on each other. When the 10
percent threshold is triggered, traders can only execute short
sales at a price above the market’s best bid. The curb lasts
through the following day.  To contact the reporters on this story:
