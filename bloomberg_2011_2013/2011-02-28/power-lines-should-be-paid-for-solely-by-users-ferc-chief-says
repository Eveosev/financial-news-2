Consumers benefiting from new
electric  power lines  should bear the full cost of construction,
the chairman of the  Federal Energy Regulatory Commission  said as
lawmakers complained about the regulator’s proposal.  FERC is proposing greater regional participation in
planning and financing the transmission lines, which would
connect new power sources such as wind turbines and solar panels
with communities that need electricity. Senators Bob Corker, a
Tennessee Republican, and Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat, have
introduced legislation to limit costs for the lines to those who
are served by them.  “Costs should not be allocated to that group that does not
benefit whatsoever,” FERC Chairman Jon Wellinghoff said today
at an energy conference in Washington. Regional operators, which
are served by their own grid operators, would determine who
actually benefits from new power lines, under the FERC plan.  FERC may issue a final rule on transmission planning and
payment as early as next month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
