European stocks were little changed
after the Stoxx Europe 600 Index posted its biggest weekly
retreat in seven months as Libyans sought to end Muammar
Qaddafi’s 41-year reign as the country’s ruler. Asian stocks
rose, while U.S. futures fluctuated.  Lloyds Banking Group Plc lost 1.1 percent after Standard &
Poor’s Equity Research and Keefe, Bruyette & Woods Inc.
downgraded the shares.  The benchmark Stoxx 600 dropped 0.1 percent to 283.82 at
8:03 a.m. in  London .  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
