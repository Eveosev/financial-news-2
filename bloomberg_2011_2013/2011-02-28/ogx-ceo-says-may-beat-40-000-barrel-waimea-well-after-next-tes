OGX Petroleo & Gas Participacoes SA,
the  oil company  controlled by Brazilian billionaire  Eike Batista , said it will test wells that may surpass the 40,000
barrel-a-day OGX-26 discovery at its Waimea field.  Drilling at the Pipeline and Waikiki wells in  Brazil ’s
offshore Campos basin may have even greater potential than
OGX-26, Chief Executive Officer Paulo Mendonca said in an
interview. Batista called Waimea a “massive, incredible
surprise” after releasing test results from the horizontal well
on Feb. 9.  Rio de Janeiro-based OGX, which doesn’t yet produce any
oil, plans to start output at Waimea in the third quarter and
produce 20,000 barrels a day by year’s-end. The company is also
testing Pipeline and Waikiki as it seeks to achieve total output
of 730,000 barrels a day by 2015 and 1.38 million by 2019.  “This Waimea field didn’t represent the best we have, but
it represents one of them,” Mendonca said in Rio de Janeiro.
“Perhaps the best will be Waikiki because it’s light oil.”  OGX rose 45 centavos, or 2.4 percent, to 19.45 reais. The
stock has gained 23 percent in the past year, compared with a
1.3 percent increase for Brazil’s Bovespa Index.  State-controlled  Petroleo Brasileiro SA , which pumps more
than 90 percent of Brazil’s crude, is focusing on other areas of
Campos where it can produce oil with cheaper, vertical wells,
compared with the horizontal wells that OGX is drilling.  OGX plans to add three wells to Waimea in 2012 and higher-
than-expected production means it will use fewer wells to supply
offshore platforms, Production Director Reinaldo Beloitti also
said in an interview at company headquarters on Feb. 24.  BTG Pactual said in a report on Feb. 10 that the data on
Waimea was “very encouraging” after the company released test
results the previous day. OGX said in a statement that the
well’s data was similar to that “obtained in the best wells in
the country.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
