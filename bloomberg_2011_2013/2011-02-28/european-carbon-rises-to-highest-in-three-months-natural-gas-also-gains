European Union carbon dioxide
permits rose to their highest price in more than three months as  natural gas  for summer jumped to its highest level this year.  Carbon allowances for December advanced as much as 1
percent to 15.58 euros a metric ton, the highest price since
Nov. 25, and were at 15.45 euros as of 9:15 a.m. on the ICE
Futures Europe exchange in London.  U.K. gas for delivery in the six months starting in April
advanced as much as 1.3 percent to 55.5 pence a therm, the
highest intraday price since Dec. 31 on ICE. That’s the
equivalent of $8.95 a million British thermal units. A therm is
100,000 Btu.  Higher gas prices may prompt some power generators to
switch from the fuel, which requires about half as many carbon
permits as coal. Emission allowances have risen 8.6 percent in
2011 as power utilities buy to hedge forward sales of power
through 2014.  “I still remain adamant on my target price of 15.58
euros,” Brett Genus, a carbon broker at OTC Europe LLP, said
Feb. 25 in an e-mailed research note. It’s not clear when
permits will reach that price, Genus said today by phone.
