  Lithuania ’s economic growth
accelerated at a faster rate than previously estimated in the
fourth quarter as recovering demand across Europe propelled
exports to record highs.  Gross domestic product rose an annual 4.8 percent, the most
in 10 quarters, compared with a preliminary estimate of 4.6
percent released on Jan. 28, the Vilnius-based  statistics office 
said in an e-mailed statement today. The economy expanded a
seasonally adjusted 1.8 percent from the previous quarter.  The Baltic region of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania is
recovering from the world’s worst recession in 2009. Lithuania’s
economy, which contracted 14.7 percent that year and relies on
exports for about two-thirds of output, benefited from rising
demand in  Europe .  Exports grew an annual 45 percent in the fourth quarter on
faster fuel and fertilizer sales, the statistics office said on
Feb. 9. Industrial output, which represents about 22 percent of
the economy, increased an annual 16.5 percent in the fourth
quarter, compared with a 7.8 percent gain in the previous three
months.  For all of 2010, the economy grew 1.3 percent, the
statistics office said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
