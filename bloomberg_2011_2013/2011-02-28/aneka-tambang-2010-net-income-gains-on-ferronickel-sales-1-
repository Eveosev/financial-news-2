PT Aneka Tambang said unaudited 2010
profit surged 175 percent from a year earlier on higher sales
and prices of ferronickel and lower sales costs.  Net income rose to 1.66 trillion rupiah ($189 million), or
174.58 rupiah per share, from 604 billion rupiah, or 63.46
rupiah a share, in 2009, the state-owned nickel and gold
producer said in a statement to the Indonesia stock exchange
today.  Unaudited revenue for the period rose to 8.75 trillion
rupiah from 8.71 trillion in 2009, the company said. Sales
volume of ferronickel increased 29 percent to 18,254 tons and
average sales price jumped 49 percent, producing a total
ferronickel sales gain of 71 percent to 3.7 trillion rupiah from
a year ago. Ferronickel and nickel ore accounted for 69 percent
of 2010 sales, the company said.  Antam , as the company is known, is expanding its business
to benefit from an increase in price and demand for the metal
used in steelmaking. Jakarta-based Antam plans to spend $3.93
billion to develop projects from this year to 2014 to boost
output, Development Director Tato Miraza said Feb. 8.  Antam shares gained 1.2 percent to 2,200 rupiah at the 4
p.m. close in Jakarta trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
