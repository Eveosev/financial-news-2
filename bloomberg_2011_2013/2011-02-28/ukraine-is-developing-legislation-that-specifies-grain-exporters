Ukraine is developing legislation
that allows only producers and so-called state market operators
to export grain, according to the draft of a bill published on
the parliamentary website today.  Other companies, such as traders, are allowed to export if
they make advance payments for not less than half of the
shipment requested, according to the draft. Lawmakers earlier
this month submitted a draft law stipulating that grain should
be exported by state agents selected by the government.  “The draft law shows that the government has embarked upon
a course to monopolize grain export,” Tamara Levchenko, a Kiev-
based agricultural analyst with Dragon Capital, said by phone
today. Should the bill be backed by lawmakers and passed,
Ukraine will have in one year “huge stockpiles of grain rotting
in elevators and decreasing productivity of farms,” Levchenko
said.  “I don’t think this draft law will be supported by
lawmakers because it contradicts other laws,” Nikolay Vernitsky, an analyst at Kiev-based researcher ProAgro, said
today by telephone. “The bill envisages that the state will
interfere in financial transactions of market participants.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
