  Malaysia ’s ringgit weakened,
trimming its advance for the month, on concern political turmoil
in the Middle East will push oil prices higher and derail the
global economic recovery.  The currency fell for a fifth day in six as crude oil
approached $100 a barrel, near the highest level in more than
two years.  China  set a lower growth target under its five-year
plan for 2011-2015, while a Bloomberg News survey of economists
shows manufacturing in Singapore eased in February. The two
countries are Malaysia’s biggest export markets.  “Rising crude oil is bad for growth in Asia,” said Sim Moh Siong, a foreign-exchange strategist at Bank of Singapore
Ltd. “The worry is still about the Middle East impact on oil as
it adds to inflation and subtracts from growth.”  The ringgit dropped 0.2 percent to 3.0555 per dollar as of
9:35 a.m. in  Kuala Lumpur , according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The currency has weakened 1 percent since touching a
13-year high of 3.0240 on Feb. 21. It strengthened 0.2 percent
from a month ago.  Oil reached $103.41 on Feb. 24 on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange , the highest since Sept. 29, 2008, as an uprising in  Libya , holder of Africa’s largest oil reserves, continued.  China forecast economic growth of 7 percent a year in its
2011-2015 economic plan, Premier Wen Jiabao said in response to
online questions today on the website of the official Xinhua
News Agency. The target was 7.5 percent under the previous five-
year plan.  Singapore’s Purchasing Managers Index for manufacturing
fell to 50 in February from 50.5 in January, according to the
median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey before the data is
released tomorrow. A reading above 50 indicates expansion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
