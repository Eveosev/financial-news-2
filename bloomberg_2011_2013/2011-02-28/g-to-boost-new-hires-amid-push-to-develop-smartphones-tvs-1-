  LG Electronics Inc ., the worldâ€™s
third-largest maker of mobile phones, plans to boost new hires
in the first half of the year as part of a push to develop
smartphones and televisions.  LG will fill 1,100 entry-level positions in the first half,
or 83 percent more than a year earlier, the Seoul-based company
said in a statement today. About 80 percent of the jobs will be
in research and development, with a focus on software
engineering, LG said.  The mobile-phone division last month reported a loss for a
third straight quarter after smartphone sales lagged behind
those of Apple Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co. LG has said it
aims to quadruple smartphone sales this year, while raising its
share in the global TV market to 16 percent.  LG shares fell 4.3 percent to 112,000 won as of 11:54 a.m.,
while the benchmark Kospi index declined 1.1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
