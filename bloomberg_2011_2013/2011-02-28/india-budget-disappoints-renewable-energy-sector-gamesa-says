Ramesh Kymal, chairman of the Indian
unit of  Gamesa Corp Tecnologica SA , Spain’s largest wind-turbine
maker, said  India ’s proposed budget for the fiscal year starting
April 1 is a disappointment to the renewable  energy industry .  Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee presented the budget
today, which will be put to vote in parliament. Kymal, chairman
of Gamesa Wind Turbines (India), said in Chennai:  I am “disappointed with the lack of aggression and support
for the renewable energy sector. India pays a huge fuel subsidy.
We are doing nothing for renewable energy sector and continue to
subsidize oil and coal, which is not good in the long term.  ‘‘Ultimately, it will impact the Indian economy. India
cannot achieve 9 percent gross domestic product growth unless we
address the energy problems of the country.’’  To contact the reporter on this story:
