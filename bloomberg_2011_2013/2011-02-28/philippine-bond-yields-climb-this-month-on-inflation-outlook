Philippine five-year bonds fell for
a second month on concern a surge in  oil prices  will fan
inflation in a nation that imports almost all its annual fuel
requirement. The peso gained.  Inflation may range between 3 percent and 4.1 percent this
month, central bank Governor Amando Tetangco said on Feb. 25,
citing higher oil and food costs. The upper end of his
projection will be the fastest since May 2010. Crude touched
$103.41 a barrel on Feb. 24, the highest level since September
2008, as anti-government protests raged in  Libya .  “The problems in the Middle East highlight the oil factor
in inflation,” said Bunny Bernardo-Recto, vice president for
treasury at Chinatrust (Phils.) Commercial. “If inflation
proves to be tricky, there is a concern the central bank may
make a preemptive move.”  The yield on the 7 percent bond due January 2016 rose 85
basis points this month and 10 basis points today to 6.35
percent as of 4:30 p.m. in  Manila , according to Tradition
Financial Services.  A government report on March 4 may show consumer prices
climbed 3.7 percent in February from a year earlier, according
to the median estimate of 10 economists in a Bloomberg News
survey. Inflation accelerated to 3.5 percent in January, the
fastest pace in four months.  This year’s average inflation is expected to stay within
target, “albeit closer to the higher end” of a 3 percent to 5
percent range, Tetangco said in a mobile-phone text message.
“We will continue to closely monitor geopolitical
developments” and the central bank has the “flexibility in its
policy toolkit to address these foreseen risks and ensure that
the inflation outlook remains manageable,” he said.  The peso rose 0.3 percent to 43.58 per dollar as of the 4
p.m. close of trading and strengthened 1.7 percent for the month,
the best performance since October, according to Tullett Prebon
Plc. It dropped as low as 43.82 earlier today.  To contact the reporter for this story:
