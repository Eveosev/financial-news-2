Corn may extend a four-week rally
and soybeans may gain after the government said U.S. supplies
will be tight for 18 months.  Twenty-six of 34 traders and analysts surveyed from Tokyo
to Chicago on Feb. 25 said corn will rise this week, and 23 of
35 respondents said soybeans will gain. Last week on the  Chicago 
Board of Trade, corn futures for May delivery rose 0.2 percent
to $7.22 a bushel, and soybeans futures for May delivery dropped
0.4 percent to $13.75.  Last weekâ€™s gain in corn was expected by the majority of
respondents surveyed on Feb. 18, while the drop in soybeans was
a surprise. Since 2004, the surveys have been correct 55 percent
of the time for corn, and 52 percent for soybeans.  Bullish on corn: 26    Bullish on soybeans: 23
Bearish on corn:  8    Bearish on soybeans: 12  To contact the reporter on this story:
