The tobacco case that led to a $10
billion verdict against cigarette maker  Altria Group Inc .’s
Philip Morris unit in a class-action lawsuit has been reinstated
by an  Illinois  appellate court, a law firm said.  The Fifth District Appellate Court of Illinois on Feb. 24
sent the case back to trial court in Madison County, Illinois,
for further proceedings, according to a press release sent by
Korein Tillery, the law firm that brought the class-action suit.  “The Appellate Court ruling came only on the issue of the
timeliness of Korein Tillery’s appeal of the dismissal of the
case by the trial court in 2006 when it acted under specific
instructions by the Illinois  Supreme Court ,” according to the
statement.  Illinois’s top court, in its December 2005 ruling, found
that state law didn’t permit the suit because the Federal Trade
Commission authorized cigarette makers to market their products
as “light” or “low-tar.” Madison County Judge Nicholas Byron
found in March of 2003 that  Philip Morris , a unit of Richmond,
Virginia-based Altria, misled Illinois smokers about the risks
of light cigarettes and awarded $10.1 billion in damages.  The case is Price v. Philip Morris Inc., 96236, Supreme
Court of Illinois.
