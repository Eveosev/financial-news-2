German electricity for delivery next
year rose for a second day as higher coal prices signaled more
expensive power generation costs in  Europe ’s biggest market.  Baseload power for 2012 gained 15 cents, or 0.3 percent, to
53.40 euros ($73.65) a megawatt-hour, according to broker data
compiled by Bloomberg as of 5:53 p.m. Berlin time. Baseload is
delivered around the clock.  Hard coal for next-year delivery to Amsterdam, Rotterdam or
Antwerp gained 0.2 percent to $121.75 a metric ton.  Germany  also
produces electricity from lignite, or brown coal, natural gas,
nuclear, wind and solar plants.  RWE AG, Germany’s second-biggest utility, halted its 1,227-
megawatt Biblis B nuclear reactor on Feb. 25 for maintenance and
will restart it from May 20 to May 22, according to data on a
company website.  In France, Europe’s second-biggest power market,
Electricite de  France  SA halted the 1,330-megawatt Flamanville 2
reactor at 10:45 a.m. local time today, according to grid data.  Bloomberg tracks power prices from brokers including GFI
Group Inc., ICAP Plc, Spectron Group Ltd., Tradition and Tullet
Prebon Plc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
