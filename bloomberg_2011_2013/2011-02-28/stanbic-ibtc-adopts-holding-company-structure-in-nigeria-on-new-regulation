  Stanbic IBTC Bank Plc  of  Nigeria 
adopted a holding company structure to enable it to keep its
non-bank units under a new regulatory framework, Chief Executive
Officer Chris Newson said.  “Our view is that investors like our structure,” Newson
said in an interview today on the sidelines of a conference in
Lagos, Nigeria’s commercial capital.  Stanbic IBTC will carry out its operations under  investment
banking , personal banking and wealth units, which comprises
asset and pension management, he said.  The  Central Bank of Nigeria  last year asked lenders in the
country, Africa’s biggest oil producer, to sell their non-
banking units or adopt a holding company model. All financial
institutions regarded as universal banks had to comply with the
policy.  The rules form part of reforms to the banking industry
after the central bank injected 620 billion naira ($4 billion)
in 2009 to bail out some banks. The  central bank  fired the chief
executive officers of eight of the country’s 24 lenders. Stanbic
IBTC wasn’t one of the banks involved.  Stanbic IBTC made “a small sale” of 14 million naira of
bad debts to the Asset Management Corp. of Nigeria, or Amcon,
the company set up by the government to buy non-performing loans
from lenders, Newson said. Amcon bought 1.04 trillion naira of
bad debts from lenders on Dec. 31, and issued so-called
“consideration bonds” to fund the purchase.  To contact the reporter on this story:
