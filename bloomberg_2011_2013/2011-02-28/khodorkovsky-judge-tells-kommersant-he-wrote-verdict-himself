The judge in Mikhail Khodorkovsky’s
oil theft trial, Viktor Danilkin, said he wasn’t under any
pressure to convict the former Yukos Oil. Co. chief executive
officer and wrote the guilty verdict himself, Kommersant
reported, citing an interview with Danilkin.  Danilkin on Dec. 30 found Khodorkovsky, once  Russia ’s
richest man, guilty of money laundering and embezzling oil and
sentenced him to a total of 14 years in prison, including the
eight years he is serving on previous charges.    Danilkin called “slander” an assistant’s claim that he
didn’t write the verdict and was forced to accept the version
handed down by his superiors, according to Kommersant.     To contact the editor responsible for this story:
