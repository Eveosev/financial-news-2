West Africa’s regional stock market,
which moved to Bamako,  Mali  from  Ivory Coast ’s commercial
capital, Abidjan, will begin trading tomorrow, the bourse said.  The Bourse Regionale des Valeurs Mobilieres had suspended
trading since Feb. 11, it said in an e-mailed statement today.
The exchange “has redeployed a technical and administrative
platform” similar to its operation in Abidjan.  The BRVM’s office was seized by security forces loyal to
Ivory Coast’s incumbent president Laurent Gbagbo nearly three
weeks ago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
