  Bidvest Group Ltd ., a holding
company with interests from grain-handling to car retailing,
said half-year earnings rose as South African auto sales
improved and businesses grew in Asia and Australia.  Net income rose to 1.73 billion rand ($247 million) in the
six months ended Dec. 31 from 1.54 billion rand a year earlier
the Johannesburg-based company said in a statement today. Sales
rose 4.2 percent to 58.5 billion rand.  Lower interest rates in  South Africa  bolstered sales from
the automotive unit, the company said. Sales in the division
rose 18 percent to 9.6 billion rand from a year ago. Logistics
and food services businesses in Australia also showed growth.
The food service business in  Asia  made a “pleasing
contribution” to the results, the company said.  Economic conditions “in most of the geographies in which
Bidvest operates have improved, resulting in higher activity
levels, however, the European landscape is likely to remain
weak,” the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
