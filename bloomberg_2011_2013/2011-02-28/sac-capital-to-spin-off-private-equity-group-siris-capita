SAC Capital Advisors LP, the $12
billion hedge fund run by  Steven A. Cohen , is spinning off its
private-equity group, according to a person with knowledge of
the plan.  The group, called Siris Capital, hopes to raise $400
million for a buyout fund that will focus on deals in the
technology, telecommunications and health-care industries, said
the person, who asked not to be identified because the
information is private.  Siris is led by Frank Baker, Peter Berger and Jeffrey Hendren, who all previously worked at private-equity firm
Ripplewood Holdings LLC in New York before joining SAC Capital
in 2007.  A spokesman for  Stamford , Connecticut-based SAC Capital
declined to comment. The move was reported earlier today by Dow
Jones Newswires.  To contact the reporter on this story:
