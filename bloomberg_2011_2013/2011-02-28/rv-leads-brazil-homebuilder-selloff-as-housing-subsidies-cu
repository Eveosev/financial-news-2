MRV Engenharia & Participacoes SA
led a selloff for Brazilian homebuilders after the government
said it would slash a housing program by 40 percent as part of a
bid to slow inflation.  “Minha Casa, Minha Vida” (My House, My Life), which
subsidizes home purchases by lower-income families, will be cut
by 5 billion reais ($3 billion) to 7.6 billion reais in this
year’s budget, Planning Minister Miriam Belchior told reporters
today.  Brazilian homebuilders have tumbled on concern rising  interest rates  will hurt housing demand, with the  BM&FBovespa
Real Estate  Index down 23 percent from an October high. The
measure lost 1.1 percent at 4:15 p.m. New York time today. MRV
plunged 5.3 percent, the most since Dec. 16, to 13.21 reais
while rival  Cyrela Brazil Realty SA Empreendimentos e
Participacoes  fell 2.7 percent to 16.55 reais.  “The budget cut diminishes the growth outlook for the
industry this year,” said Erick Hood, a real-estate analyst at
SLW Corretora brokerage in Sao Paulo.  In addition to housing, Brazil’s government will reduce
defense, education, subsidies and payroll spending as part of
its plan to slow inflation pressures by cutting 50.1 billion
reais from this year’s budget.  To contact the reporter on this story:
