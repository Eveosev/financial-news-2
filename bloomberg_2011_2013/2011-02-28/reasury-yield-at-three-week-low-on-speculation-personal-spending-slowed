Treasury yields were at a three-week
low before a government report that economists said will show a
slowing in household purchases, which account for about 70
percent of the economy.  Ten-year notes held their biggest weekly gain since May as
unrest in  Libya  drove investors to the safety of  U.S. government
debt  and raised concern that surging  oil prices  will slow the
economic recovery. The  Federal Reserve  is  scheduled  to buy as
much as $7 billion of notes due from August 2013 to February
2015 today as part of its plan to spur growth.  “There may be some downward pressure on yields,” said Kei Katayama, who helps oversee the equivalent of $55.7 billion as
leader of the foreign fixed-income group in Tokyo at Daiwa SB
Investments Ltd., a unit of Japan’s second-largest broker. “I’m
not that optimistic on the economy.”  Ten-year notes yielded 3.41 percent as of 9:49 a.m. in
Tokyo, according to BGCantor Market Data. The 3.625 percent
security maturing in February 2021 traded at 101 27/32. The
yield was at the lowest since Feb. 2. It declined 17 basis
points last week, the most since the period ended May 21.  Growth in personal spending slowed to 0.4 percent last
month, from 0.7 percent in December, according to the median
forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of economists before the
Commerce Department report today.  U.S. officials are scheduled to meet their foreign
counterparts in Geneva today to discuss Libya, including
measures to pressure  Muammar Qaddafi  out of power while building
ties to opposition leaders.  Crude oil futures for April delivery traded at $99.52 a
barrel, after rising to $103.41 on Feb. 24, the highest level
since September 2008.  Treasuries still headed for a decline this month. An index
of U.S. government securities has handed investors a 0.2 percent
loss as of Feb. 25, based on Bank of America Merrill Lynch data.
The index was little changed in January, after falling 2.7
percent in the fourth quarter of last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
