Putnam Investments LLC named three
money managers as co-heads of its fixed-income team, replacing
Rob Bloemker, who is leaving the firm.  D. William Kohli, Michael Salm and Paul Scanlon, all of
whom have been with Putnam for more than a decade, will oversee
the companyâ€™s almost $60 billion in fixed-income investments,
Boston-based Putnam said today in an e-mailed statement. The
three will report to Walter Donovan, chief investment officer.  Bloemker has run the bond team since late 2007 and will
remain at the firm through a transition period, according to the
statement.  Putnam had $123 billion in assets under management at the
end of January, including $68 billion in mutual funds and $55
billion in institutional accounts, the statement said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
