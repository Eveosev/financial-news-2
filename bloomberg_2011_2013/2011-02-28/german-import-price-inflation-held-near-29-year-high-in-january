German import-price inflation held
near a 29-year high in January after costs for commodities such
as energy and metal surged.  The annual rate of increase eased to 11.8 percent from 12
percent in December, which was the highest since October 1981,
the Federal Statistics Office in Wiesbaden said in an e-mailed
statement today. Economists predicted the rate would drop to
11.2 percent, according to the median of 13 estimates in a
Bloomberg News survey. In the month, prices rose 1.5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
