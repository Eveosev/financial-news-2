“Rising  oil prices  simply do not
have the shock value they once possessed” for U.S. consumers,
according to Brian Belski, chief investment strategist at
Oppenheimer & Co.  As the CHART OF THE DAY shows, energy accounts for a
falling share of household spending, according to data compiled
by the Commerce Department. The top panel displays annual rates
in billions of dollars, adjusted for inflation.  Gasoline, heating oil and other forms of energy amounted to
3 percent of personal consumption expenditures during last
year’s fourth quarter, as the bottom panel indicates. The
proportion was 4.3 percent in 1996, when the chart begins.  “We believe consumers have become accustomed to elevated
oil prices and have adjusted their spending habits
accordingly,” Belski wrote today in a report.  Total outlays increased last quarter to a $9.43 trillion
rate, breaking a record set in the final three months of 2007.
The new high occurred even though household spending on energy
fell 3 percent from its pace three years earlier.  Even a 20 percent jump in oil prices “should still leave
an economic expansion in place,” Bankim Chadha, chief U.S.
equity strategist at Deutsche Bank AG, wrote yesterday in a
report. Chadha cited energy’s decline as a percentage of
consumer expenditures to support his conclusion.  Crude oil climbed 16 percent from Feb. 16, when the
commodity’s price began rallying from this year’s low in New
York trading, through the end of last week.  (To save a copy of the chart, click here.)  To contact the reporter on this story:  David Wilson  in New York at
