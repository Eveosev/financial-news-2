Thomas Steffen, a European policy
official at the German Finance Ministry, may be named the BaFin
financial regulator’s next head, Handelsblatt said, citing
people close to Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  it didn’t
identify.  BaFin President  Jochen Sanio  may retire this summer, the
Dusseldorf-based newspaper reported today, without saying how it
got the information. Steffen previously headed BaFin’s insurance
oversight divisions,  Handelsblatt  said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
