  South Africa  posted its first trade
deficit in three months in January as exports of minerals,
metals and gemstones slumped and imports of machinery and
components surged.  The shortfall of 4.9 billion rand ($702 million) followed a
record 10.3 billion-rand surplus in December when factories shut
for year-end holidays and curbed imports, the South African
Revenue Service said in an e-mailed statement today. The median
estimate of eight economists surveyed by Bloomberg was for a 2.3
billion-rand deficit.  “While the realignment of positive global economic growth
opens up avenues for restoring the export base, the bias is
tilted towards a stream of trade deficits in 2011 as domestic
demand gathers pace,” Shireen Darmalingam, an economist at
Johannesburg-based Standard Bank Group Ltd.,  Africa ’s biggest
lender, said in e-mailed comments. “Once there is clearer pick-
up in global economic activity, only then will we see a
sustained improvement in exports.”  The rand traded at 6.9648 per dollar at 3:23 p.m. in
Johannesburg, from 6.9781 before the release of the trade data.  Exports fell 17 percent to 44.8 billion rand in January
from the previous month as shipments of precious and semi-
precious stones and metals slumped 21 percent, the revenue
service said. Exports of mineral products, including coal, slid
19 percent, shipments of vehicles, aircraft and vessels fell 48
percent and exports of machinery and electrical appliances
dropped 20 percent.  Imports climbed 14 percent to 49.7 billion rand, with
purchases of equipment components surging 67 percent and
machinery and electrical appliances 17 percent, the Revenue
Service said.  Trade figures are often volatile, reflecting the timing of
shipments of commodities such as oil and diamonds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
