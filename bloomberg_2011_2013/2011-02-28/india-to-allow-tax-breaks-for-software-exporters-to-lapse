  India  will allow tax breaks for the
nation’s software industry, which helped information technology
companies expand, to lapse on March 31.  The  Software Technologies Parks of India Act , enacted in
1991, offered software exporters income tax breaks and duty-free
import of goods.  “This is definitely going to have an impact for the small
to mid-sized IT companies that were looking to take advantage of
the  tax exemption ,” said Sanjoy Sen, senior director at
Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu India Pvt. in Hyderabad. “In the near
term, this will hurt profit, and in the future they’re going to
have to rely on volumes for growth.”  The tax breaks helped India’s software industry boost sales
15-fold in the past 10 years, according to National Association
of Software & Services Companies. Revenue at the country’s
technology companies may rise to $59 billion in the year ending
March, contributing 26 percent of exports, from 4 percent in
1998, according to  Nasscom .  The government will also start levying the so-called
minimum alternate tax on companies operating in special economic
zones, which may affect earnings of information technology
companies, said Arun Singh, senior economist at Dun & Bradstreet
Information Services India Pvt. in Mumbai.  To contact the reporter on this story:
