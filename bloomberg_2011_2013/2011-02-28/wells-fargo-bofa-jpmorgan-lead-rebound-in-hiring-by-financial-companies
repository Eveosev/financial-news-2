  Bank of America Corp .,  Wells Fargo &
Co . and  JPMorgan Chase & Co . are among financial firms that
added employees last year as the industry adjusted to an
expanding economy and demands imposed by new U.S. regulations.  Bank of America, the biggest U.S. lender, counted 288,000
employees in its annual report for 2010 to securities
regulators, an increase of 4,000, or 1.4 percent. Wells Fargo,
the biggest U.S. mortgage lender, increased headcount by 4,900,
or 1.8 percent, to 272,200, according to its annual report. Bank
of America’s workforce increased 17 percent in 2009, the year
when Merrill Lynch & Co. was added, while San Francisco-based
Wells Fargo dropped almost 5 percent that year.  Banks reported a 77 percent increase in earnings in 2010,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Improved asset quality
and a decrease in loan-loss provisions contributed to the
earnings growth, according to a report last week from the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Bank of America, based in  Charlotte ,  North Carolina , put aside $28.4 billion for bad loans
in 2010, down 41 percent.  “There was good talent out there at the right price,”
said Eric Moskowitz, head of market intelligence in the global
financial-markets practice of Los Angeles-based executive search
firm Korn/Ferry International. “A lot of banks cut pretty deep
in 2008 and 2009, and they needed to staff-up.”  AmEx Headcount  JPMorgan, the second-largest bank, may file its annual form
10-K later today.  Data accompanying  the New York-based company’s
fourth-quarter earnings report in January showed 239,831
employees, an increase of almost 8 percent from a year earlier.  American Express, the biggest credit-card issuer by
purchases, increased its workforce by 2,700, or 4.6 percent, to
61,000 in 2010, according to a filing today by the New York-
based firm. In 2009, the staff shrank 12 percent.  Citigroup
Inc ., the third-largest bank by assets, cut jobs by 5,300, or 2
percent, to 260,000 in 2010. New York-based Citigroup has been
shrinking as it recovers from the financial crisis.  Banks are adding employees to help ensure they’re in
compliance with new laws such as the Dodd-Frank overhaul of the
financial industry that passed last July, Moskowitz said. The
act creates a consumer bureau at the  Federal Reserve , a council
of regulators to monitor firms for systemic risk to the economy
and a mechanism for liquidating large financial firms whose
collapse could threaten economic stability.  “It’s a very nuanced regulatory environment, not just for
the U.S., but globally, so you need people on the ground in
different regions because the regulations are so in flux and
varied,” Moskowitz said.  Bank of America, ranked second in home loans and first in
mortgage servicing, hired and trained about 12,000 people to
modify loans over the past two years to help homeowners
struggling to keep up with payments. About 58,200 were employed
in the home loans and insurance unit, according to the filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
