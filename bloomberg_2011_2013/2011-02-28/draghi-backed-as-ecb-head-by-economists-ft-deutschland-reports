Economists prefer  Italy ’s central
bank governor,  Mario Draghi , for European Central Bank
president, Financial Times Deutschland reported, citing a survey
of 22 economists.  Twelve of them supported Draghi, while one backed
Luxembourg’s central bank governor,  Yves Mersch , the newspaper
said. Eight economists said a dominance by southern European
countries of the ECB’s executive board would be problematic,
according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
