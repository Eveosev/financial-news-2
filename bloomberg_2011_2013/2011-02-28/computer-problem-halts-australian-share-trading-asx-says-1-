The Australian stock exchange said
it suspended share trading in mid-afternoon following a glitch
on the operator’s computer system.    ASX Ltd . will use prices as of 2:48 p.m. as the close and
won’t extend trading today, said Matthew Gibbs, a spokesman for
the exchange. The operator of Australia’s biggest bourse said it
suspended trading because confirmation messages for executed
trades on some stocks weren’t being received.  “Our people are working to rectify the problem,” Gibbs
said by telephone from Sydney. “An announcement will be made in
due course” on when the halt will be lifted.  To contact the reporter on this story:
