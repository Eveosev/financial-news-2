The German city of Munich expects a
3 billion-euro ($4.15 billion) “economic impact” should it be
successful with a bid to host the 2018 Winter  Olympic Games .  A detailed scientific study into the economic impact of a
successful bid will be presented to the  International Olympic
Committee ’s evaluation commission in two days, Thomas Bach, IOC
vice-president and president of the German Olympic Sports
Confederation, said at a press conference in Munich today. The
11-member IOC evaluation commission is visiting the city this
week.  Munich is seeking to become the first venue to host both
the Olympic summer and winter games after it already staged the
1972  Summer Olympics . It’s bidding together with the city of
Garmisch-Partenkirchen and the district of Berchtesgadener Land.  The southern German city is competing with  Annecy  in France
and  Pyeongchang  in  South Korea  and aims to hold “the world’s
first climate-neutral mega-sports event,” according to the 400-
page  bid book , which was submitted to the IOC last month. The
IOC evaluation commission is visiting the 2018 candidate cities
during February and March. The IOC will select the host city on
July 6 in Durban,  South Africa .  To contact the reporter on this story:
