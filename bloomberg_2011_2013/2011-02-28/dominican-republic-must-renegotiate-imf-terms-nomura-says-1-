The  Dominican Republic  should
renegotiate its agreement with the  International Monetary Fund 
to incorporate “more realistic financial assumptions,” Nomura
Securities said in a note to clients today.  “We think it unlikely that the Dominican Republic met its
2010 fiscal targets,” wrote  Boris Segura , a Nomura analyst.
“And we expect 2011 to be even more fiscally challenging.”  The Caribbean island nation should also extend the so-
called stand-by agreement through the May 2012 elections, Segura
wrote. The government agreed to a $1.7 billion loan with the IMF
in November 2009 to help weather the economic crisis. The accord
is set to expire in February 2012.  The government likely had a fiscal deficit of 3 percent of
gross domestic product last year, wider than then 2.4 percent
allowed under the terms with the IMF, Segura wrote. The economy
grew 6.5 percent to 7 percent last year, the most among the
Caribbean nations, the IMF said in a Nov. 10 statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
