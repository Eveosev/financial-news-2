  Enbridge Inc . said its  Spearhead 
pipeline, which mostly transports heavy Canadian oil in the
central U.S., will be able to meet 17 percent of requests to
move oil next month.  Producers, traders and refiners will move 157,405 barrels a
day on the Spearhead line, Larry Springer, a spokesman for  Canada ’s largest pipeline company, said today in an e-mail.
Spearhead was scheduled to carry 160,632 barrels a day in
February, meeting 15 percent of shippers’ requests.  Enbridge also said its Ozark oil pipeline in the U.S. will
meet all demand for shipping in March. Ozark is considered full
with a capacity of 232,425 barrels a day, Springer said.  Shippers sometimes inflate nominations to make sure they
obtain the space needed to transport their oil, and the company
must determine how many requests it can meet.  The Spearhead line spans 657 miles (1,058 kilometers) from  Chicago  to Cushing, Oklahoma, according to the company’s
website.  Ozark, which transports heavy and low-sulfur oils between
Cushing and Wood River, Illinois, is part of Enbridge’s  Mid-
Continent System , which includes more than 480 miles of oil
pipelines and 12.8 million barrels of storage, according to the
company’s website. Heavier oil has a higher density.  To contact the reporter on this story:
