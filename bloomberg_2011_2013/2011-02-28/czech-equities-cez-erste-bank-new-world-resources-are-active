The Czech Republic’s main PX equity
index rose 0.2 percent to 1,244.1 at 4:28 p.m. in  Prague , its
highest close since Feb. 16. The gauge gained 0.6 percent this
month.  The following were among the most active stocks in the
Czech market today. Stock symbols follow company names.    CEZ AS  (CEZ CP) fell 2.4 percent to 810 koruna, its biggest
daily drop in a month, after the largest Czech power producer
said it expects net income to decline 15 percent this year,
prompting speculation it may reduce its dividend.    Erste Group Bank AG  (RBAG CP) rose 1.9 percent to 937.8
koruna in Prague and traded 1 percent higher at 38 euros in
Vienna, its home market. The Austrian lender had its share-price
estimate lifted today to 38 euros from 35 euros at Credit Suisse
Group AG and to 50 euros from 44 euros at HSBC Holdings Plc.    New World Resources NV  (NWR CP), the biggest Czech supplier
of coal to steelmakers, advanced for a fourth day, its longest
stretch of gains since December. NWR rose 2.4 percent to 279.6
koruna as Europe’s benchmark coal derivatives climbed for a
second day in Amsterdam.  To contact the reporter on this story:
