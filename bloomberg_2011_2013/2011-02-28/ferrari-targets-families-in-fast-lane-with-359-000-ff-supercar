Ferrari SpA,  Fiat SpA ’s most
profitable unit, will target wealthy families and golf bag-
toting sports-car enthusiasts when it introduces the four-seat
FF, the first Ferrari with four-wheel drive.  Ferrari aims to build 800 of the FF annually, with the
first year of production already sold out, Ferrari Chairman Luca Cordero di Montezemolo said in Geneva today. The car will be
priced at 260,000 euros ($359,000).  “Four-wheel drive is a revolution for Ferrari,” said
Fabio Barone, 38, chairman of the  Passione Rossa owners’ club ,
who has two Ferraris. “You can finally drive a real Ferrari,
with its extreme performance, to take your family skiing.”  Supercar sales are growing amid renewed optimism in the
finance industry after the  U.S. economy  expanded 2.9 percent
last year, the most in five years. U.S. sales of the world’s
most expensive cars, a category that includes Ferraris and spans
sticker prices from $200,000 to $400,000, may surge 146 percent
this year after dropping 40 percent in 2010, according to
Lexington, Massachusetts-based  IHS Automotive .  Fiat rose as much as 21 cents, or 3.1 percent, to 6.94
euros and was up 1 percent to 6.79 euros as of 1:44 p.m. in
Milan trading. The shares have gained 1.4 percent this year,
valuing the Turin, Italy-based carmaker at 8.4 billion euros.  Ferrari Four  “With the FF, we open a new book in Ferrari’s history,”
Montezemolo told reporters. “This is something we have never
done before.”  The 660-horsepower FF , which stands for Ferrari Four,
accelerates to 100 kilometers (62 miles) an hour in 3.7 seconds.
The FF “can comfortably accommodate four people and their
luggage,” with a 450-liter (15.9 cubic feet) trunk, extendable
to 800 liters with the back seats down,  Ferrari said on its
website . The trunk and cabin space are the biggest in the
category, according to the company.  “Ferrari is widening its offer to niches it didn’t cover
before,” said AT Kearney analyst Marco Santino. “It may be a
winning strategy if they are bringing something really new to
the market.” Lamborghini SpA, Maranello, Italy-based Ferrari’s
main competitor, has used four-wheel drive technology already.  Aventador Supercar  Lamborghini unveiled its Aventador supercar at the Geneva
show. The car will be the Sant’Agata Bolognese, Italy-based
carmaker’s most powerful series production vehicle ever.  The Aventador, which has an engine that surges to 100
kilometers per hour in 2.9 seconds, will replace the Volkswagen
AG brand’s top-of-the-line Murcielago. The supercar, priced at
225,000 euros, is also sold out for its first year of production.  Ferrari in 2010 posted a 13 percent increase in sales in
the U.S., the biggest market for supercars. Employees at big
Wall Street banks continued to outpace other professions in
earnings even as they took modest pay cuts in 2010.  Ferrari is also trying to boost profit by adding products
and expanding in fast-growing countries such as  China , where its
sales increased 44 percent in 2010, and  India , where it will
open a first dealership in Mumbai in coming months. Ferrari
opened a  theme park in Abu Dhabi  last year.  Ferrari “is the prize asset of the new Fiat auto, with
high margins, high growth and a unique brand value,”  Max Warburton , an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein in  London , wrote
in a note to clients on Feb. 2. He estimates that Ferrari and
Fiat’s Maserati brand may be worth a combined 3.5 billion euros.  Sales Gains  Ferrari aims to increase sales about 3 percent this year to
a record 6,800 vehicles, Montezemolo said today, adding that
there is no plan to sell shares in the Fiat unit.  Ferrari’s earnings before interest, taxes and one-time
items, which Fiat calls trading profit, rose 27 percent to 303
million euros in 2010 as revenue reached 1.9 billion euros.
Fiat’s auto unit began trading separately from the company’s
industrial operations on Jan. 3.  Fiat Chief Executive Officer  Sergio Marchionne  in April
announced a five-year plan for Ferrari and Maserati, calling for
the two luxury brands to almost double revenue to about 4 billion
euros by 2014 by adding products and widening their model ranges.  To contact the reporters on this story:
