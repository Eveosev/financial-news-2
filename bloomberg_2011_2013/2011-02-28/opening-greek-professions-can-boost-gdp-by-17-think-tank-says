Liberalizing  Greece ’s so-called
closed professions could give the country a double-digit growth
boost as it tries to recover from its economic crisis, said the
head of the  Foundation for Economic and Industrial Research .  Studies by the foundation, also known as IOBE, show that in
the long term such changes may increase gross domestic product
by more than 17 percent, while in the next five years it could
boost GDP 10 percent, Yannis Stournaras, the foundation’s
director general, said at an IOBE-organized event in  Athens 
today, according to an e-mailed transcript of his remarks.  Greece’s government is currently driving measures through
parliament to lift restrictions to entry for certain professions
as a condition of the country’s 110 billion-euro ($152 billion)
bailout from the European Union and the  International Monetary
Fund  in May.  Greece is entering a third year of recession after its
economy contracted 4.5 percent last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
