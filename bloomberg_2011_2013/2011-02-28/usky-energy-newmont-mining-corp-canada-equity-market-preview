Canadian stocks fell for the first
time in three days as financial companies declined after Bank of  Canada  kept its benchmark interest rate unchanged, citing
“considerable slack” in the economy.  Toronto-Dominion Bank declined 1.7 percent. Bank of Nova
Scotia fell 1.4 percent.  Barrick Gold Corp. (ABX) , the world’s largest
producer, advanced 2.2 percent as unrest in Libya spurred demand
for the metal as a haven.  The Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index dropped 13.65
points, or 0.1 percent, to close at 14,122.85 in Toronto.  “The market has had such a remarkable run in the last six
months that any kind of news at all make it susceptible to a
sell-off,” said  Danielle Park , a partner at Venable Park
Investment Counsel Inc. in Barrie, Ontario, which manages at
least C$1 million each for more than 250 families. “This
morning the Bank of Canada talked about the downside risks going
forward.”  The Canadian benchmark equity index gained 4.3 percent in
February for a streak of eight monthly gains, the longest since
May 2007. A subgroup of gold producers in the S&P/TSX climbed 10
percent from Jan. 25 through yesterday amid political unrest in
the Middle East and northern Africa.  Toronto-Dominion, Canada’s second-largest lender, dropped
1.7 percent to C$79.93 for its biggest decline since Dec. 20.
Bank of Nova Scotia fell 1.4 percent to C$59.15.  Bank of
Montreal (BMO)  declined 0.3 percent to C$61.77, even after reporting
record quarterly earnings.  Challenges  “There is early evidence of a recovery in net exports,
supported by stronger U.S. activity and global demand for
commodities,” Bank of Canada Governor  Mark Carney , 45, and his
five deputies said in a statement. Exporters still face
“considerable challenges” from a currency trading near a
three-year high and “poor relative productivity,” the Ottawa-
based bank said.  Twenty-eight out of 34 members of a subgroup of gold
producers in the Canadian benchmark equity index rose today.
Gold futures for April delivery reached the all-time high after
the close of regular trading on the Comex in  New York . The metal
had settled up $21.30 to $1.431.20.  Barrick gained 2.2 percent to C$52.41.  Goldcorp Inc. (G) 
advanced 3.6 percent to C$48.07, the highest price since Dec. 6.  Oil-sands developer  BlackPearl Resources Inc. (PXX)  declined 3.9
percent to C$7.72, the biggest drop since Feb. 22, after the
company was cut to “neutral” from “outperform” at Macquarie
Research. The 12-month price estimate is C$8.50.  To contact the reporter on this story:
