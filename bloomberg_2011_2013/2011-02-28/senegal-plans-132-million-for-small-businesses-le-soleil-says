  Senegal ’s government will finance a
five-year, 63 billion-CFA franc ($132-million) program to
improve small and medium-sized business access to credit and
electricity, Le Soleil said, citing a government minister.  As part of that program, several large manufacturers
including cement maker  SA des Ciments Vicat ’s Senegalese unit,
Sococim, will gradually disconnect from the electricity grid to
ease the strain on the system, the minister of small and medium-
sized businesses, Abdoulaye Balde, told the Dakar-based
newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
