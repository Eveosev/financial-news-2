  Alon USA Energy Inc . reported
emissions from a boiler at its Big Spring refinery in  Texas ,
according to a filing with state regulators.  The Dallas-based company described excess opacity at the
“CO boiler,” the  filing  with the Texas Commission on
Environmental Quality showed.  In a separate  report  to the state, the company said there
was expected flaring to clear material from a PDA unit.
Emissions associated with the flaring started yesterday at 10:10
p.m. local time and were expected to last 24 hours, the filing
said.  The PDA unit is associated with a crude deasphalting unit,
a jet condenser and a propane compressor, according to the
report.  Refinery outages can increase prices for refined products
as companies turn to spot markets to help them meet supply
contracts. Operational disruptions can also depress prices for
crude oil as less feedstock is used.  The refinery, which is 295 miles (475 kilometers) west of  Dallas , is capable of processing 70,000 barrels a day, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:  Aaron Clark  in New York at
