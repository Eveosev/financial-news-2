Exports of coking coal from  Australia , the world’s largest shipper of the steelmaking fuel,
are forecast to rise 3 percent this year even after record rain
cut production in Queensland state.  Shipments may total 163 million metric tons this year, from
159 million tons last year, the  Australian Bureau  of
Agricultural & Resource Economics and Sciences said today in a
report. They are forecast to rise at an average annual rate of 5
percent to reach 219 million tons in 2016, it said.  Coal prices on the cash market have rallied above $300 a
ton, up 33 percent on contract prices for this quarter after
unseasonal weather forced producers including  BHP Billiton Ltd .
and Rio Tinto Group to declare force majeure, a clause that
allows companies to miss shipments because of circumstances
beyond their control. Prices may increase to $400 a ton for
three-month contracts starting April 1, Bank of America Merrill
Lynch said in a January report.  Queensland produced 56 percent of Australia’s coking and
thermal coal during fiscal 2010 and 62 percent of Australia’s
coal exports. Export earnings this fiscal year are expected to
increase 39 percent to A$34 billion ($40 billion), the bureau
said. Shipments next year may reach A$42 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
