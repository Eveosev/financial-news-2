  Hang Seng Bank Ltd ., the Hong Kong-
based lender backed by  HSBC Holdings Plc , posted a 14 percent
increase in full-year profit as fee income advanced and costs
related to bad loans dropped.  Net income rose to HK$14.9 billion ($1.9 billion), or
HK$7.80 a share, from HK$13.1 billion, or HK$6.87, a year
earlier, according to a filing to the  Hong Kong  Stock Exchange
today. That beat the HK$14.5 billion average of 10 estimates
compiled by Bloomberg.  Chief Executive Officer Margaret Leung, 58, reversed two
years of declining earnings by distributing insurance products
and mutual funds as the profitability of loans in the city
shrank to the lowest in at least eight years. The second-largest
Hong Kong-based bank also increased lending by offering more
credit cards and mortgages, making it poised to benefit should
loan margins recover.  “Loan pricing can’t fall much further,” said Raymond Siu,
an analyst at Quam (IA) Ltd. in Hong Kong. “It’s difficult for
banks to compete any more on pricing.”  The lender, which is about 62 percent owned by London-based
HSBC, declined 0.6 percent to HK$124.20 at the 4 p.m. close of
Hong Kong trading before the results were announced. The stock
has gained 9.4 percent over the past year, trailing the 11
percent advance in the  Hang Seng Finance Index .  HSBC’s Profit  HSBC,  Europe ’s biggest bank, reported full-year earnings
that missed analyst estimates as investment banking income
shrank and costs rose to what the company called an
“unacceptable” level. Net income rose to $13.2 billion in 2010
from $5.83 billion the previous year.  Hong Kong’s economic growth rebounded to a faster-than-
anticipated 6.8 percent in 2010, bolstering demand for credit.
The city’s gross domestic product may expand as much as 5
percent this year, Financial Secretary John Tsang said last week.  Fee income at Hang Seng Bank climbed 13 percent to HK$4.9
billion, while costs tied to non-performing loans dropped 52
percent to HK$390 million, according to the statement. Net
interest income, or revenue from lending minus payments to
depositors, increased 2 percent to HK$14.3 billion.  The lending margin for retail banks in Hong Kong shrank in
the fourth quarter to 1.28 percent, the lowest since at least
2002, according to a Hong Kong Monetary Authority presentation
posted on its  website  last week.  Hang Seng Bank’s net interest margin, a measure of lending
profitability, widened three basis points from the first half of
2010 to 1.8 percent in the second half, according to the
statement. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
