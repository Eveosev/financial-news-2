  India ’s stocks rose as the
government pledged to boost spending on infrastructure projects
and give the nation’s poorest cash to buy fuel to shield them
from inflation.    Larsen & Toubro Ltd ., an engineering company, gained for
the first day in five. Spending on roads, ports and other large
projects will be increased by 23 percent in the year from April,
Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee said in his annual budget
speech to parliament today. Oil & Natural Gas Corp. climbed the
most since June on a plan to give the poor cash to buy kerosene
and remove a subsidy on the fuel.  The Bombay Stock Exchange’s Sensitive Index, or Sensex,
gained 86.53, or 0.5 percent, to 17,787.43 at 12:13 p.m. in  Mumbai . The S&P CNX Nifty Index on the National Stock Exchange
rose 0.6 percent to 5,335.30. The BSE 200 Index increased 0.5
percent to 2,186.85.  “So far the finance minister has made all the right
moves,” said Kishor Ostwal, managing director of CNI Research
(India) Ltd., a publicly traded equities research provider in
Mumbai. “Cutting subsidies and boosting investment in
infrastructure are the positive steps that investors were
waiting for.”  Larsen added 3 percent to 1,560 rupees. Oil & Natural
increased 4.2 percent to 273 rupees, set for its steepest
advance since June 25.  Housing Development, the nation’s biggest mortgage lender,
jumped 4.2 percent to 649.75 rupees.  State Bank of India  Ltd.,
