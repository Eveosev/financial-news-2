The Australian dollar weakened,
extending earlier declines, after a government report showed
company profits unexpectedly fell in the fourth quarter.  The currency depreciated to $1.0121 as of 11:35 a.m. in
Sydney from $1.0132 before the report and $1.0177 on Feb. 25.  Australian business profits fell 2.8 percent in the fourth
quarter from the previous three months, the Bureau of Statistics
said today. That compares with the median forecast for a 1
percent gain in a Bloomberg News survey of economists.  To contact the reporter on this story:
