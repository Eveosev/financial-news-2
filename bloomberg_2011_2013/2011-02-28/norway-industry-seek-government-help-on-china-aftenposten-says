Norwegian industry is calling on the
government to address trade relations with China, which have
deteriorated since the Nobel Peace Price was awarded to a
Chinese dissident in October, Aftenposten reports, citing lawyer
Lars Berge Andersen at Wikborg Reinâ€™s  China  desk.    Norwegian companies including Leroey Seafood Group ASA and
Det Norske Veritas are reporting that licenses have been
