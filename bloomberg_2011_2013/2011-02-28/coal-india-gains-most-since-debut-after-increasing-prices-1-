  Coal India Ltd ., the world’s largest
producer of the fuel, had its biggest gain in almost four months
after increasing prices.  The stock climbed 12 percent to 327.70 rupees at the close
in Mumbai. The gain is the biggest since Coal India surged 40
percent on its first trading day on Nov. 4. The benchmark
Sensitive Index rose 0.7 percent.  The price increase, effective yesterday, will boost revenue
by about 6.5 billion rupees ($144 million) in the year ending
March 31 and about 62 billion rupees in the next financial year,
Kolkata-based Coal India said in a statement to the Bombay Stock
Exchange today. The company didn’t give details of the price
increase.  The additional revenue for the year ending March is
equivalent to 1.5 percent of last year’s sales, according to
Bloomberg calculations.  Sales at state-owned Coal  India  and its units gained 15
percent to 446.2 billion rupees in the year ended March 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
