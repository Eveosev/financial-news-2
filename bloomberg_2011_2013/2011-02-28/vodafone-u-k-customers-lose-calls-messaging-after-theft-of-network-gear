Some  Vodafone Group Plc  customers in
the U.K. have no voice, text message, or mobile Internet service
after a theft of network equipment in Basingstoke, southern
England.  The world’s largest mobile-phone operator by revenue is
working to return its network to normal “as soon as we can,”
spokesman Simon Gordon said. Vodafone doesn’t yet know when
service can be restored after the break-in last night, he said.  Some users of  Research in Motion Ltd . BlackBerry devices on
Vodafone were unable to access e-mail service this morning,
while other users appeared unaffected. Posters on Twitter Inc.’s
micro-blogging site complaining of service outages were
concentrated in London and south-east England, according to
 seekatweet.com , which tracks tweets’ geographic origin.  Vodafone has about 19 million customers in the U.K., where
it competes primarily with  Telefonica SA ’s O2 unit and
Everything Everywhere, a joint venture between France Telecom SA
and Deutsche Telekom AG.  To contact the reporter on this story:
