  Turkey  started marketing a planned
sale of 10-year Samurai bonds, according to a person with direct
knowledge of the transaction.  The government told investors it will price the bonds to
yield between 45 basis points and 55 basis points more than the
yen swap rate, said the person, who asked not to be identified
as the information is private. Final terms will be set March 11,
the person said. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  Daiwa Securities Capital Markets Co., Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan
Stanley Securities Co. and Mizuho Securities Co. are helping to
manage the sale, Turkey’s government said in a  Feb. 18 statement 
on its website.    Japan Bank for International Cooperation  agreed to provide
a guarantee for as much as 180 billion yen ($2.2 billion) of the
bonds, Turkey said in an online statement  Feb. 23 .  Turkey is rated Ba2 by Moody’s Investors Service, the risk
assessor’s second-highest non-investment grade, while JBIC is
ranked Aa2, the third-highest investment grade, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Samurai bonds are yen-denominated
notes sold in Japan by overseas borrowers.  ---Editors: Hugh Chow, Tom Kohn  To contact the reporter on this story:
