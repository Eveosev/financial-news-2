  Range Resources Corp ., the natural-
gas producer that is one of the biggest landholders in the
Marcellus Shale field in Pennsylvania, said it will sell 52,000
acres in the Barnett Shale in  Texas  for $900 million.  The property includes 390 producing wells with a capacity
of 113 million cubic feet per day, Range said in a statement.
The buyer’s name wasn’t announced because it is a private
company, Karen Giles, a spokeswoman for Range, said in an
interview. Range, based in  Fort Worth , Texas, will retain some
acreage in the Barnett Shale valued at about $50 million.  Range plans concentrate 86 percent of its $1.4 billion in
2011 capital spending in the Marcellus Shale.  The Barnett Shale sale is expected to close in April, and
Range will sell another $200 million to $250 million worth of
property during the next 12 months, according to the statement.  Editors: Charles Siler, John Viljoen  To contact the reporter on this story:
