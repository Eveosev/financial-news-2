  Pearson Plc , the owner of the
 Financial Times , said 2010 profit rose 21 percent as the company
benefited from investments in emerging markets and digital
operations.  Adjusted operating profit advanced to 857 million pounds
($1.38 billion) from 710 million pounds a year earlier, London-
based Pearson said in a statement today. The company reported
adjusted earnings per share of 77.5 pence, beating the 75.5
pence average estimate of 21 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Pearson, which also owns the book publisher Penguin, said
it posted double-digit profit growth in all businesses last
year, led by a 54 percent increase at the FT Group, which
publishes the Financial Times. Digital revenue accounts for 29
percent of the company’s sales, and emerging markets makes up 10
percent. Pearson expects further growth this year in sales,
margin and adjusted earnings per share.  Today’s earnings “indicate the changing shape and nature
of our company: more digital, more efficient, more exposed to
fast-growing economies,” Chief Executive Officer Marjorie Scardino said in the statement. The company’s markets “will be
tough again this year,” she said.  Pearson climbed 1.5 percent to 1,057 pence at 8:04 a.m. in
London trading.  Sales rose 10 percent to 5.66 billion pounds.  Pearson’s markets that depend on  government spending , as
well as traditional print publishing models, are predicted to
“remain weak” in 2011, the company said.  Pearson increased its dividend by 9 percent to 38.7 pence a
share.  Education Business  The company said its North American education business,
which reported a sales increase of 7 percent to 2.64 billion
pounds last year, will gain in 2011 as growth in higher
education and assessment “more than offsets” a slower year for
the school publishing industry.  Eighty percent of Pearson’s earnings in 2010 came from
education, Scardino said on a conference call today. It was the
company’s “best year ever,” she said.  The FT Group, which saw paid online circulation rise by
more than 50 percent in 2010, will continue its focus on digital
operations, even as advertising sales “remain unpredictable,”
according to the statement.  Penguin is expected to perform in line with the consumer
publishing industry in 2011, Pearson said.  The company in 2010 sold its 61 percent stake in
Interactive Data for $3.4 billion and has since used some of the
proceeds to expand through acquisitions, focusing on technology
and education.  To contact the reporter on this story:
