  Australia ’s liquefied natural gas
exports may more than double by 2016 as Asian economies increase
gas consumption as part of government policies to diversify
energy sources, the nation’s commodity forecaster says.  Exports may climb to 41 million metric tons in the 12
months to June 30, 2016, from 19 million tons this year, the
 Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and
Sciences  said in a report today. The value of LNG shipments may
increase to A$18.5 billion ($18.8 billion) from A$8.3 billion.    Chevron Corp ., Woodside Petroleum Ltd.,  BG Group Plc  and  Santos Ltd . are among producers developing LNG projects in
Australia to meet increased demand from Asia. Global consumption
may rise “significantly” with some governments emphasizing on  energy security  and the environmental competitiveness of gas
relative to other fossil fuels such as coal, the Canberra-based
bureau said.  Australia’s increase in LNG exports reflects the country’s
“attractiveness as a location for investment given its
perceived lower security and political risks compared with
competitors such as those in the Middle East or West Africa,”
the bureau said in the report.  Global LNG imports by North Asian countries, including
Japan and South Korea, are forecast to climb to 126 million tons
in 2016, from a projected 115 million tons in 2011, the bureau
said. Chinese imports may increase to 24 million tons in 2016,
from 11 million tons this year, it said.  Australia has two LNG projects, the Woodside-operated North
West Shelf Venture in  Western Australia  and the ConocoPhillips-
operated Darwin plant in the Northern Territory.  The fuel is natural gas chilled to liquid form, reducing it
to one-six-hundredth of its original volume for shipment by
tankers to destinations not connected by pipeline.  To contact the reporter on this story:
