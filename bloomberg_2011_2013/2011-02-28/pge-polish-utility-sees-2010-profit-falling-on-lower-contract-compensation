PGE SA said 2010 net income probably
fell from the previous year as  Poland â€™s largest power utility
received lower compensation payments from the government for
canceled long-term contracts.  Net income declined to 3.01 billion zloty ($1.04 billion)
from 3.37 billion zloty, the company said in a preliminary
estimate today. That matches the mean estimate by four analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg.  Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization, or Ebitda, decreased to 6.82 billion zloty from
7.98 billion zloty, the Warsaw-based company said. Sales fell
5.3 percent to 20.5 billion zloty as revenue from compensation
payments declined to 330 million zloty from 1.53 billion zloty
in 2009. PGE is scheduled to publish final earnings on March 21.  Polish electricity generators receive quarterly payments to
compensate them for losses caused by the cancellation of
contracts that were banned by the European Commission as illegal
state aid.  To contact the reporter on this story:
