Andrew Freris, senior investment
strategist for  Asia  at BNP Paribas Wealth Management, comments
on  India ’s budget and stocks in an interview to Bloomberg UTV.  The Bombay Stock Exchange’s Sensitive Index, or Sensex,
climbed 2.5 percent to 18,149.48 as of 2:07 p.m. in Mumbai
today, on course for its biggest gain in two weeks. India will
cut the  budget deficit  to 4.6 percent of its gross domestic
product in the fiscal year ending in March 2012, Finance
Minister Pranab Mukherjee said in his annual budget speech in
parliament today.  On the budget:  “There are no major reforms initiatives, for example, as
far as the retail sector is concerned.”  “There are no major initiatives. There are no surprises,
neither are there any disappointments. The markets were relieved
rather than pleased with what they have seen.”  On the government’s borrowing plan:  “It is interesting that the plan to borrow is less than
expected, less by about 1.2 trillion rupees and that is very”
significant.  “Any move to reduce the deficit is extremely good at a
time that  interest rates  for the next six months are not going
to go down; rather they are going to go up.  ‘‘But let’s not forget, last year the fiscal deficit was
compelling because of the auction of the telecommunication
spectrum. It is to be seen if there have been any proposals of
further privatization or further one-off sales,’’ in the coming
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
