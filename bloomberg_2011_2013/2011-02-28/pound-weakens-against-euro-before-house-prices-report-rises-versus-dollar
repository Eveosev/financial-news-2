The pound fell against the euro
before reports this week that are forecast to show  house prices 
declined and manufacturing growth slowed.  Sterling rose for the first time in three days versus the
dollar and yen. House prices slid for a second month in
February, dropping 0.2 percent from January, according to the
median estimate of 12 economists surveyed by Bloomberg before
the  Nationwide Building Society  releases the data tomorrow. U.K.
manufacturing growth weakened from the fastest pace on record in
February, Markit Economics and the Chartered Institute of
Purchasing and Supply are forecast to say tomorrow.  The pound was 0.1 percent weaker at 85.44 pence per euro as
of 8:18 a.m. in London. The British currency traded at $1.6121,
from $1.6118 on Feb. 25, and was at 131.66 yen, from 131.65.  To contact the reporter on this story:
