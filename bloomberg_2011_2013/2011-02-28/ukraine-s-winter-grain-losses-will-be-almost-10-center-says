About 10 percent of Ukraine’s winter
grains will be lost as a result of adverse weather during the
autumn and winter, the national  Hydrometeorology Center  said.  Some areas will have to be reseeded in the spring, Tetiana Adamenko, head of the weather center’s agriculture department,
said today by e-mail.  “There will be no massive damage to winter grain plants,”
Adamenko said. The weak plants are mostly winter barley planted
in late autumn in the Kirovohrad, Odessa, Luhansk and Ternopil
regions, according to the statement.  Agriculture Minister Mykola Prysyazhnyuk said Feb. 22 that
winter grains are in good condition and “there is nothing to
worry about.” The grain harvest probably will increase 18
percent this year to 46.23 million metric tons, researcher
UkrAgroConsult said on Jan. 11.  Spring fieldwork will probably begin in the first half of
April and the number of days with favorable soil conditions and
temperatures will be “quite low,” Adamenko said.  Temperatures will gradually increase in the first 10 days
of March, the researcher said, adding that cold conditions are
expected in the middle of the month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
