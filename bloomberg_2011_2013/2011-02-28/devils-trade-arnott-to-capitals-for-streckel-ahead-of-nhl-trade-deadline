The  New Jersey Devils  sent forward
Jason Arnott to the  Washington Capitals  for face-off specialist
David Steckel ahead of today’s  National Hockey League  trade
deadline.  The Devils (27-31-4) received Steckel and a second-round
pick in the 2012 draft in exchange for the 17-year veteran,
Devils spokesman Mike Levine said in a conference call. New
Jersey is 11-1-1 in February, nine points out of the eighth and
final playoff spot in the Eastern Conference.  Steckel, 28, leads the league with a 63.7 percent face-off
winning percentage this season. Devils General Manager Lou Lamoriello said the team had been interested in the six-year
veteran since his time playing junior hockey.  “For us to trade Jason Arnott, we had to bring a player
into our lineup that would not miss a beat in what our team can
bring,” Lamoriello said in a conference call.  Arnott, a two-time All-Star, joins a Capitals team that is
33-20-10, in fifth place in the Eastern Conference. The 36-year-
old forward has scored 396 goals and made the playoffs 11 times
with four teams, including a Stanley Cup championship with the
Devils in 2000.  The Capitals also acquired defenseman Dennis Wideman from
the Florida Panthers in exchange for prospect Jake Hauswirth and
a third-round pick in the 2011 draft, Capitals spokesman Sergey
Kocharov said in an e-mail.  Rangers’ Deal  The  New York Rangers  (33-27-4) acquired forward  John Mitchell  from the Toronto Maple Leafs today for a 2012 seventh-
round pick, the Maple Leafs said on their  website . The Rangers,
in seventh place in the Eastern Conference, had also expressed
interest in Dallas Stars forward Brad Richards, the New York
Daily News reported. Richards, a 20-goal scorer in eight of his
10 NHL seasons, wasn’t traded before the deadline, Stars
spokesman Joe Calvillo said in a telephone interview.    New York Islanders  forward Rob Schremp, a first-round pick
in the 2004 draft, was claimed off waivers by the Atlanta
Thrashers, Atlanta spokesman Rob Koch said in an e-mail. Schremp
has 22 points in 45 games this season. The  Chicago Blackhawks 
acquired Chris Campoli, a former Islanders defenseman, and a
conditional seventh-round pick from the Ottawa Senators for
forward Ryan Potulny and a conditional second-round pick, the
team said in a release.  Last Jacket  The Columbus Blue Jackets parted with defenseman Rotislav
Klesla, the last player from the team’s inaugural 2000-01
season. Klesla, the fourth pick in the 2000 draft, was traded to
the Phoenix Coyotes for forward Scottie Upshall and defenseman
Sami Lepisto, the Blue Jackets said on their website. The
Coyotes also received former Rangers forward Dane Byers in the
deal.  The Los Angeles Kings (35-23-4) acquired forward Dustin Penner from the Edmonton Oilers, in an attempt to bolster their
offense for a playoff push, the team said on its website. Penner
was third on the Oilers with 39 points after recording a team-
high 63 last season. Edmonton (20-35-8) received defenseman
Colten Teubert, a 2011 first-round draft pick and a conditional
third-round draft pick in 2012.
