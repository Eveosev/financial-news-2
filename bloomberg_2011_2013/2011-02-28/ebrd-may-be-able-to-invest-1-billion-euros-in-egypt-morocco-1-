The European Bank for Reconstruction
and Development may be able to invest as much as 1 billion euros
($1.4 billion) in Egypt and  Morocco , according to the bank’s
president, Thomas Mirow.  It would take as long as nine months to get full agreement
on the loans, Mirow told reporters today in Brussels.  The EBRD, which has fostered the building of market
economies in eastern  Europe  in the past two decades, stands
ready to help nations in North Africa and the Middle East,
adding to the 29 countries where it invests, Mirow said Feb. 23.  EBRD shareholders approved an increase in the London-based
lender’s capital by 50 percent to 30 billion euros last May.
That enables it to invest about 52 billion euros until 2015,
more than the total investment since it was founded in 1991.    Egypt , a founding shareholder of the EBRD, filed a request
in May to be included in the bank’s target region. Egyptian
President  Hosni Mubarak  was toppled Feb. 11 after anti-
government protests.  The EBRD is reviewing Egypt’s request and will examine the
nation’s “commitment to democracy and the market economy --
values promoted by the EBRD’s statutes,” Mirow said last week.
A final decision will have to be made by shareholders.  The EBRD, owned by 61 countries and two intergovernmental
institutions, was created to invest in former communist
countries to help them transform their economies.  To contact the reporters on this story:
