  Juniper Networks Inc ., the supplier
of security systems and routing equipment to Internet service
providers, sold $1 billion of debt in a debut offering,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The company sold $300 million of 5-year notes that pay 100
basis points more than similar-maturity Treasuries, $300 million
of 10-year debt at 120 basis points more than benchmarks and
$400 million of 30-year bonds at a 145 basis-point spread,
according to the data. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  The offering was the first for the Sunnyvale, California-
based company, the data show. Proceeds will be used for general
corporate purposes, which may include  capital expenditures ,
share repurchases and acquisitions, according to a regulatory
filing.  “Tech companies are increasingly selling debut offerings,
which definitely shows some shift in the tech industry,” said
Guy LeBas, chief fixed-income strategist at Janney Montgomery
Scott LLC in Philadelphia. “As 90s tech babies become more
mature there is a greater instance of debt issuing, and I expect
that to increase over the next several years.”    EBay Inc ., owner of the e-commerce site, sold $1.5 billion
of debt in October in a debut offering. AVG Technologies, the
Czech maker of Internet security software, plans to offer bonds
to U.S. investors this year.  The Juniper notes were rated Baa2 by Moody’s Investors
Service, the company said in a statement today. They are graded
an equivalent BBB by  Standard & Poor’s , according to the data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
