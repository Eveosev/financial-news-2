The New York Knicks’ win at the
Miami Heat earned the best preliminary local television rating
ever for an ESPN regular-season National Basketball Association
game in the biggest U.S. media market.  Last night’s game at AmericanAirlines Arena in Miami, which
New York won 91-86 behind Carmelo Anthony’s 29 points, was seen
in an average of 4.3 percent of households in New York, Bill
Hofheimer, a spokesman for  Walt Disney Co .’s ESPN, said in an e-
mail. That topped a 2003 meeting of the  Los Angeles Lakers  and  Houston Rockets  that featured a matchup of Shaquille O’Neal and
then-rookie Yao Ming, which earned a 3.5 rating. ESPN’s data
dates back to 2002.  An average of 6.8 percent of households in Miami watched
yesterday’s game, making it the second-best rating for an ESPN
NBA regular-season game in that city, behind a Heat meeting with
the Orlando Magic last Oct. 29 that drew a 9.3 rating.  An average of 3.3 percent of households in the top 56 U.S.
television markets watched the game, which raised New York’s
record to 2-1 since acquiring Anthony and Chauncey Billups last
week in a trade with the  Denver Nuggets .  Last night’s game competed with the 83rd Academy Awards,
which aired on Disney’s ABC Network and had a 24.6 overnight
metered-market rating.  To contact the reporter on this story:
