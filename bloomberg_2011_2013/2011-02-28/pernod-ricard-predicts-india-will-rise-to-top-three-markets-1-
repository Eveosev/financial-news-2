  Pernod-Ricard SA , the maker of
Absolut vodka, said India may rank among its top three markets
in five years, along with the U.S. and China, as economic growth
and rising incomes spur demand for its brands.  “India’s growth sounds very promising,” Chief Executive
Officer Pierre Pringuet said in an interview in New Delhi today.
“With more disposable incomes, people will move from the
consumption of basic items to branded goods.” India is
currently the Paris-based distiller’s fifth-largest market.  India’s economy may grow 9 percent in the fiscal year
starting in April, Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee said while
announcing budget proposals in parliament today. India will be
the world’s second-largest market for alcoholic beverages in
2013, overtaking  Russia ,  International Wine and Spirit Research 
said on Nov. 10.  Pernod’s Indian unit competes with  Radico Khaitan Ltd .,
the maker of 8PM whisky, and billionaire Vijay Mallya’s  United
Spirits Ltd ., which sells McDowell’s No. 1 whisky and Romanov
vodka. In Asia, consumers are buying more Scotch whisky and
cognac, according to Pernod, which estimates it controls
about half of the Chinese whisky market and 40 percent of
the cognac market.  Vodka consumption in India may grow 12 percent between 2009
and 2015, according to International Wine and Spirit Research.
Rising incomes and higher spending may make India the fifth-
largest consumer market by 2025, according to a January report
by Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu.  To contact the reporter on this story:
