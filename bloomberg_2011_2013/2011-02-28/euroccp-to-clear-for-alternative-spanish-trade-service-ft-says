EuroCCP, a European cash equities
clearing house, concluded a preliminary agreement to provide
clearing for  Spain ’s planned Plataforma Alternativa de Valores,
or PAVE, the Financial Times reported, citing Javier Tordable,
PAVE’s founding partner.  This marks a step forward in PAVE’s plans to compete with
BME, the Spanish stock exchange, and against Chi-X Europe, BATS  Europe  and Turquoise, which have small shares of the market for
Spanish stocks, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
