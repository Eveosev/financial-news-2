The Netherlands’ benchmark  AEX-Index 
retreated 0.42, or 0.1 percent, to 366.35 as of 10:52 a.m. local
time in Amsterdam. The gauge is still on course for a 1.6
percent monthly gain. Belgium’s Bel20 Index was little changed
at 2,692.98 today, heading for a 2.1 percent rise in February.  The following are among the most active stocks in Benelux
markets today. Symbols are in parentheses.  Dutch stocks:    Imtech NV  (IM NA) gained 2.8 percent to 26.225 euros, the
biggest advance since Jan. 18. The largest Dutch technical
services company agreed to buy Inviron for an undisclosed amount
in cash to expand in the U.K.    Kendrion NV  (KENDR NA) increased 2.7 percent to 16.53
euros, rising for a third day. The maker of electromagnetic
parts used in Siemens AG’s letter-sorting machines said fourth-
quarter net income rose to 6.2 million euros from 1.8 million
euros a year earlier.    Pharming Group NV  (PHARM NA) plunged 18 percent to 15.4
cents, the most since May 28. The Dutch drug developer and

“reduce” from “hold.”  VastNed Retail NV (VASTN NA) advanced 1.7 percent to 51.00
euros. VastNed Offices/Industrial NV (VNOI NA) rose 1.5 percent
to 11.735 euros, ending three days of declines. The Dutch owner
of shopping centers in the Netherlands, Spain, France and
Belgium and VastNed O/I said they plan to end their joint
management agreement as of 2012.  “Standalone” the two funds would be “easier takeover
targets,” Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc said in a note

euros. The majority owner of  Punch Graphix NV  reported a full-

loss on a stake in  Accentis  NV, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
