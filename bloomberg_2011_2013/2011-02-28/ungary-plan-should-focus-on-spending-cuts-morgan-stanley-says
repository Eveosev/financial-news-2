Hungary’s fiscal consolidation plan,
which the government is scheduled to announce tomorrow, should
improve budget financing by at least 600 billion forint ($3
billion), focusing on spending cuts, Morgan Stanely said.  “We believe that a package in the region of 600-800
billion forint, or 2-3 percent of GDP, will be enough to please
markets,” Pasquale Diana, a London-based economist for Morgan
Stanley, said in a research note today. “More importantly, a
composition heavily tilted towards expenditure cuts rather than
revenue increases would be a positive.”  The plan has “the potential to turn perception of
Hungarian fiscal fundamentals around” even as “most
investors” are “agnostic or skeptical” about the government’s
ability to successfully implement such a plan, Morgan Stanley
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
