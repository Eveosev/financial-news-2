Cotton futures surged the most
allowed by ICE Futures U.S. for the second straight session on
signs that global supplies will continue to trail demand.  Production in  China , the world’s biggest importer, fell 6.3
percent to 5.97 million metric tons last year, the third
consecutive drop, National Bureau of Statistics data showed.  India ’s textile ministry lowered its output forecast by 5
percent, the Business Standard said yesterday. The price in New
York rose to an all-time high of $2.0893 a pound on Feb. 18.  “This kind of news adds further pressure to the already
stretched supply conditions,” said Sterling Smith, an analyst
at Country Hedging Inc. in  St. Paul ,  Minnesota . “I will not be
surprised if the record price gets challenged soon.”  In other markets, crude oil fell the most in two weeks as  Saudi Arabia  offered to make up for supplies lost because of
unrest in  Libya  amid signs that the North African petroleum
producer still is exporting. Sugar gained. The UBS Bloomberg
Constant Maturity Commodity Index advanced 0.7 percent to
1,760.32. Earlier, the gauge reached 1,763.82, extending a rally
to a record.  Cotton futures for May delivery jumped by the exchange
limit of 7 cents, or 3.8 percent, to settle at $1.9123 at 2:46
p.m. on ICE in New York. The fiber, up 14 percent this month,
has surged 32 percent in 2011, the biggest gain to start a year,
according to Bloomberg data starting in mid-1959.  “This is the first time China’s cotton output has fallen
below 6 million tons since 2005,” said Dong Shuzhi, a manager
at Shanghai Jinhuicheng International Trade Co. “The official
estimate caught some investors by surprise because many put the
estimate above 6 million.”  Crude oil  Oil futures for April delivery declined 91 cents, or 0.9
percent, to $96.97 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange ,
the biggest drop since Feb. 11. The commodity reached $103.41 on
Feb. 24, the highest intraday price since Sept. 29, 2008.  Khalid Al-Falih, the Saudi Arabian Oil Co.’s chief
executive officer, said the kingdom is ready to compensate for
any shortfall. Most ships picking up Libyan oil cargoes have
done so successfully in the past week, said Bob Knight, the head
of tankers at Clarkson Plc, the world’s largest shipbroker.  “The threat to supply overall doesn’t look as dangerous as
it did last week,” said  Tim Evans , an energy analyst at Citi
Futures Perspective in New York. “Events in Libya seem to be
moving steadily in one direction, with oil production apparently
not dropping further and some exports being loaded.”  Sugar  Sugar prices rose for the third straight session on concern
that global supplies will be tighter than analysts expected.  Tanzania plans to import 50,000 metric tons of sugar by
June to meet a domestic shortfall. The  International Sugar
Organization  slashed its estimate for a global surplus in the
year ending Sept. 30 to 196,000 tons from 1.3 million forecast
in November. This month, raw-sugar prices rose to a 30-year
high.  “The fundamentals are very strong,” said Michael Smith,
the president of T&K Futures & Options Inc. in Port Saint Lucie,  Florida . “Also, the market is up as the March contract goes
into delivery tomorrow.”  Raw sugar for May delivery advanced 0.71 cent, or 2.5
percent, to 29.45 cents a pound on ICE. The most-active contract
jumped 7.6 percent in the three sessions ended today. On Feb. 2,
the price reached 36.08 cents, the highest since November 1980.  Commodities settled as follows:  Precious metals:
