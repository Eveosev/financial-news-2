  Nigeria ’s  Independent National
Electoral Commission  will appeal against a federal court
decision to cancel governorship votes in five states during
April’s general elections, a spokesman said.  “The commission will accept the decision of the Court of
Appeal,” commission spokesman Kayode Idowu said today by phone
from Abuja, the capital.  Justice Adamu Bello ruled on Feb. 23 that the governors of
Kogi, Bayelsa, Cross River, Sokoto and Adamawa states have a
year left in their four-year tenure after winning re-run
elections in 2008, according to Lagos-based Vanguard newspaper.  Africa’s most populous country and top oil producer is
scheduled to hold state elections on April 16. The vote for the
presidency takes place on April 9 and the national parliament on
April 2.  To contact the reporter on this story:
