The  New York Knicks  defeated the
Miami Heat 91-86 in the first meeting between the teams since
the Knicks acquired Carmelo Anthony.   Anthony had 29 points and nine rebounds at Miami’s
AmericanAirlines Arena in his third game with the Knicks, who
improved to 30-27. The Heat fell to 43-17, the second best
record in the Eastern Conference.    The Knicks are now 2-1 since getting Anthony last week from
the Denver Nuggets. Knicks owner James Dolan pushed for the
trade, seeking to revitalize a franchise that hasn’t had a
winning season in 10 years and failed to get  LeBron James  as a
free agent during the offseason.       James led the Heat with 27 points.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
