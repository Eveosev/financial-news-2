  Bunzl Plc , the biggest U.K. supplier
of vending machines, plans additional acquisitions after nine
purchases to boost revenue and profit.  Bunzl, based in  London , may spend more on acquisitions in
2011 than the 126 million pounds ($204.5 million) it paid buying
closely held companies last year, Chief Executive Officer
Michael Roney said in a telephone interview today.  “If things all fall into place we would spend more,”
Roney said. “The most number of acquisitions in the next couple
of years will be in continental  Europe .”  Bunzl doesn’t own businesses in Sweden, Norway, Italy or
Portugal. It expanded in Switzerland and Denmark in 2010 through
takeovers. Buying other businesses accounted for half the four
percent increase in revenue in 2010.  Net income rose 6.8 percent last year to 159 million
pounds, or 48.8 pence a share, from 148.9 million pounds, or
46.3 pence, in 2009, Bunzl said in a statement today. Revenue
advanced to 4.8 billion pounds.  Sales and operating profit increased fastest outside Europe
and  North America , helped by the pound’s weakening against other
currencies such as the Brazilian real.  To contact the reporter on this story:
