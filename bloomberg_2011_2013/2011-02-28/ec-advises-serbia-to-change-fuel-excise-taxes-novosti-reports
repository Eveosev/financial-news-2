The European Commission has told  Serbia  that it discriminated against imported fuels when it
changed its excise duties earlier this year,  Vecernje Novosti 
newspaper reported, citing Deputy Prime Minister Bozidar Djelic.
The country is ready to amend the taxes after it received the
EU’s opinion, Djelic said in the report.  Increasing the excises by different amounts favored gas and
diesel fuel produced by the only local refiner, Naftna
Industrija Srbije AD, majority-owned by OAO Gazprom Neft, and
the government will have to find a solution acceptable to NIS
and also complying with Serbia’s free-trade agreement with the
European Union, the report said, citing Djelic.  “In the year when Serbia expects to become a candidate for
joining the Union, an obstacle like this is not needed,” Djelic
was quoted as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
