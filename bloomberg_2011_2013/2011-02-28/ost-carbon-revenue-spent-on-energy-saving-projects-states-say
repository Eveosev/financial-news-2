A group of U.S. Northeast states has
raised $789 million from the sale of carbon-dioxide pollution
rights to  power plants  and spent 52 percent of the proceeds on
energy-saving projects, according to a report.  The energy-efficiency spending help to cut pollution and
generates “important consumer benefits, including energy-bill
savings, greater electric-system reliability, and new jobs,”
the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative said today in the report.  The initiative regulates carbon dioxide from power plants
with a cap-and-trade program in a 10-state region from  Maryland 
to Maine. It started selling carbon-dioxide allowances in
September 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
