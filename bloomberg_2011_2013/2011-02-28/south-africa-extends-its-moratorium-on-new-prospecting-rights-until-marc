  South Africa , the nation with the
biggest mineral wealth, extended a six-month moratorium on new
prospecting-right applications by a month for all regions except
Mpumalanga province.  The moratorium was extended to the end of March “to
finalize outstanding work,” Bheki Khumalo, a spokesman for the
Department of Mineral Resources, said today by mobile phone.
In Mpumalanga, the main coal-producing region, the moratorium
will last until Sept. 30, the department said in a statement.  Mineral Resources Minister Susan Shabangu issued a national
moratorium from Sept. 1, 2010, after finding the award of mining
rights had been mismanaged. South Africa has the largest
platinum, chrome and manganese reserves, and the biggest overall
mineral wealth of any nation, Citigroup Inc. said last year.  The halt of prospecting applications at Mpumalanga won’t
threaten future coal supplies to national power utility Eskom
Holdings Ltd., Khumalo said. Eskom said repeatedly last year
it’s concerned supplies will fall short as investment in new
mines fails to keep pace with its estimates of future demand.  “In Mpumalanga we have serious problems with rights having
been granted in environmentally sensitive areas,” Khumalo said,
without being more specific.    BHP Billiton Ltd .,  Anglo American Plc  and  Xstrata Plc  are
among the biggest metal and mineral producers in the country.  To contact the reporter on this story:
