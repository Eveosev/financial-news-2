Oil options volatility declined for
a second day as the underlying futures dropped by the most in
two weeks after  Saudi Arabia  offered to make up for supplies
lost because of unrest in  Libya .  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
April, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 35.9 percent as of 4 p.m. in  New York ,
down from 40.5 percent in the previous session, Feb. 25. It was
27.9 percent on Feb. 18.  Oil for April delivery fell 91 cents, or 0.9 percent, to
settle at $96.97 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange ,
the biggest daily drop since Feb. 11. Futures reached $103.41 a
barrel on Feb. 24, the highest intraday price since Sept. 29,
2008, sending options volatility to an eight-month high.  April $81 puts were the most active options in electronic
trading today, with 2,015 lots changing hands. They lost 1 cent
to 7 cents a barrel. April $100 calls, the next-most active
contract, dropped 90 cents to $1.89 a barrel with 1,947
