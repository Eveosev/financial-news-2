KPMG International appointed James
Stewart, former chief executive officer of the U.K. Treasury’s
long-term infrastructure planning body, as chairman of the
firm’s global infrastructure practice.  Stewart, 48, who worked in a public-private partnership for
Britain’s infrastructure industry for more than 10 years, will
join the auditing and advisory firm “this spring” and replace
Tim Stone as chairman in September, the company said today in a
statement.  “James has been the face of U.K. infrastructure, in the
U.K. and internationally, for the last 10 years,” Nick Chism,
the global head of Zurich-based KPMG’s infrastructure practice,
said in the statement. “He has deep knowledge of the industry
and is capable of making tough calls.”  At  Infrastructure UK , Stewart oversaw Britain’s long-term
planning and prioritization of infrastructure and sought private
investment, according to the statement. He previously worked at
Partnerships UK, a body that is being wound down this year,
according to its  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
