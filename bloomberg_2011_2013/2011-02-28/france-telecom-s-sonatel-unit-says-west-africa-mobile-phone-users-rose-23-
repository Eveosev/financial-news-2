  France Telecom SA ’s unit that
operates in four West African nations said mobile-phone
subscribers rose 23 percent in 2010, as net income fell on
higher call-tax charges in its biggest market, Senegal.  User numbers rose to 10.9 million last year and increased
in Senegal, Mali, Guinea and Guinea-Bissau, according to a
statement posted on Dakar-based Sonatel SA’s website today. It
operates networks in those countries under the Orange brand.  Profit for the company, which is the largest by market
value on West Africa’s regional stock market, dropped to 184.76
billion  CFA francs  ($389 million) for the year, from 185.03
billion francs in 2009, the  company said . Revenue rose 6.5
percent to 599 billion francs.    Sonatel ’s revenue is dominated by operations in Senegal and
Mali, according to the company. It wants to take advantage of
political stability to expand in  Guinea , which transitioned from
a military administration to civilian-led rule with elections in
2010, and accounted for 4.8 percent of revenue last year.  “Competition should remain stiff, but the group should
preserve its strong position in the markets where it’s present,”
it said.    France Telecom  controls 42 percent of the company, with the
Senegalese government, shareholders on the Bourse Regionale des
Valeurs Mobilieres and employees holding the remainder.  To contact the reporter on this story:
