Ethanol futures jumped for a fourth
day in  Chicago , capping the first monthly gain this year, as
corn advanced on speculation that tight supplies will increase
production costs.  The biofuel’s streak of gains was the longest since Dec.
29. Corn increased after the Agriculture Department forecast
stockpiles on Aug. 31, 2012, may total 865 million bushels, up
from a 15-year low of 675 million this year. Ethanol in the U.S.
is made from corn.  “Ethanol was definitely following the corn,” said  Jason Ward , an analyst at Northstar Commodity Investments in  Minneapolis . “Corn was again strong, so ethanol put a few cents
on. It’s made new highs with no signs of rationing of demand.”  Denatured ethanol for March delivery increased 4.8 cents,
or 1.9 percent, to $2.592 a gallon on the Chicago Board of
Trade, the highest price since July 15, 2008. Futures are 51
percent higher than a year ago.  In cash market trading, ethanol in Chicago soared 9 cents,
or 3.6 percent, to $2.56 a gallon, and in  New York  the additive
climbed 7 cents, or 2.7 percent, to $2.655, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in the U.S. Gulf rose 5 cents, or 2 percent, to
$2.575 a gallon, and on the West Coast the biofuel added 2.5
cents, or 1 percent, to $2.60.  Corn futures for May delivery gained 9 cents, or 1.2
percent, to settle at $7.31 a bushel in Chicago. The price
rallied 11 percent this month, after touching $7.4425 on Feb.
22, the highest since July 2008.  Average ethanol mills in Iowa are losing 7 cents on every
gallon produced, while plants in  Illinois  are losing 1 cent on a
spot basis, according to Ag Trader Talk, an online grains
information service in Clive,  Iowa .  To contact the reporter on this story:
