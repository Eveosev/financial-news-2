Treasury 10-year notes rose for a
third day before a government report that economists said will
show a slowing in household purchases, which account for about
70 percent of the economy.  The extra yield that investors demand to own 10-year notes
instead of 2-year debt narrowed to 2.68 percentage points, a
six-week low. Investors should bet the spread will contract
further, according to a report by Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Ten-year notes also extended gains from last week as unrest in  Libya  drove investors to the safety of  U.S. debt  and raised
concern that surging  oil prices  will slow the economic recovery.  “There may be some downward pressure on yields,” said Kei Katayama, who helps oversee the equivalent of $55.7 billion as
leader of the foreign fixed-income group in Tokyo at Daiwa SB
Investments Ltd., a unit of Japan’s second-largest broker. “I’m
not that optimistic on the economy.”  Ten-year yields declined two basis points to 3.39 percent
as of 10:42 a.m. in Tokyo, according to BGCantor Market Data.
The price of the 3.625 percent security maturing in February
2021 advanced 5/32, or $1.56 per $1,000 face amount to 101 30/32.  Growth in personal spending slowed to 0.4 percent last
month, from 0.7 percent in December, according to the median
forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of economists before the
Commerce Department report today.  The  Federal Reserve  is  scheduled  to buy as much as $7
billion of notes due from August 2013 to February 2015 today as
part of its plan to spur growth.  To contact the reporter on this story:
