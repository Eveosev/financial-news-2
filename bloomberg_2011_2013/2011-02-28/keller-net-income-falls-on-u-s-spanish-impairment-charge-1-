  Keller Group Plc , the builder of the
foundations for the main stadium of London’s 2012 Olympic Games,
said full-year profit dropped 78 percent after it wrote down the
value of investments in the U.S. and  Spain .  Net income fell to 11.2 million pounds ($18.1 million), or
17 pence a share, from 50.4 million pounds, or 77.4 pence, a
year earlier, the company said today in a statement. Keller took
an impairment charge of 21.8 million pounds, wiping out all of
the goodwill balance for Keller-Terra in Spain and one-third of
the goodwill for Suncoast in the U.S.  “Markets in the States and Western Europe will remain
challenging, but we have the benefit of diversification into  Australia  and developing markets,” Chief Executive Officer
Justin Atkinson said in an interview.  The recovery outlook for the U.S. construction sector,
which provides about 40 percent of Keller’s revenue, is better
than that of Western Europe, where Atkinson said the company
will “have to continue to match our cost-base to our revenue
streams.”  Keller has suffered from slowdowns in the U.S. residential
market and the construction market in Spain as the global
economy recovers from the deepest recession in more than 50
years. Atkinson said it won more contracts in the second half of
2010 than a year earlier, and at the end of January the order
book was 13 percent ahead of the previous year.  Keller fell as much as 3.9 percent to 613.5 pence in  London 
trading and was down 0.6 percent as of 9:32 a.m., paring the
stock’s gain in six months to 12 percent.  Brazil Acquisition  Keller will have a year of recovery in 2011, albeit “a
slow one,” the CEO said, as government budget cuts and
overcapacity in the U.S. will delay growth in profit margins
until the second half.  Australia and developing markets increased to 38 percent of
revenue last year as Keller focuses on expanding outside of the
depressed Western Europe and U.S. construction markets, it said.  The company will focus on organic investment and revenue
growth in its Asian markets of  India ,  Singapore  and  Malaysia ,
Atkinson said. Keller is looking to make acquisitions in  Brazil 
where it currently has a joint venture.  “We’ll be disappointed if we don’t make another
acquisition in 2011,” Atkinson said. “It will be small-to-
medium-sized, less than $50 million funded out of cash.”  Full-year pretax profit before the impairment charge
dropped by 47 percent to 39.6 million pounds, while revenue
gained 3 percent to 1.07 billion pounds, Keller said.  The company plans to pay a dividend of 22.8 pence a share,
compared with 21.75 pence for the same period in 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
