  Kapsch TrafficCom AG , an Austrian
maker of toll road systems, fell the most in three months in
Vienna trading after third-quarter results missed analyst
expectations.  Kapsch declined as much as 5.4 percent and were down 3.4
percent at 66.84 euros at 9:38 a.m. The stock was the second-
best performer in the Vienna Bourse’s ATX Prime Index last year
on the back of new contracts to run toll roads in countries
including  Poland .  Kapsch said net income in the quarter ended December fell
87 percent to 2.2 million euros ($3 million), compared to the
average estimate of 10.9 million euros in a Bloomberg survey of
four analysts. Revenue rose 17 percent to 112 million euros,
also slightly below the estimates.  “Though we expect a negative market reaction today, we
tend to ascribe most of the underperformance to shifts in the
project roll-out,” said Daniel Damaska, an analyst at
Raiffeisen Centrobank. This doesn’t “affect the mid-term
prospects and profitability forecast,” said Damaska, who rates
Kapsch at “buy.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
