  Strabag SE  board members Siegfried Wanker and Peter Krammer may succeed Chief Executive Officer
Hans-Peter Haselsteiner when he retires in 2015,  Trend magazine 
reported, without saying where it obtained the information.  While Haselsteiner, who holds about 30 percent of Strabag
via a trust, prefers an internal successor, this isn’t an
“absolute,” he was cited as saying by the monthly magazine.  Strabag Chairman Alfred Gusenbauer, who is a former
Austrian chancellor, may also be an option, Vienna-based Trend
said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
