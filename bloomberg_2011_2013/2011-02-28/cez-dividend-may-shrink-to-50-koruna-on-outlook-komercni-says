  CEZ AS  may cut its dividend from
2010 profit to 50 koruna or less from 53 koruna a year earlier,
Komercni Banka AS said after the largest Czech power utility
forecast its profit this year may drop 15 percent.  “We believe CEZ will propose a dividend from 2010 profit
of no more than 50 koruna per share in order to prevent a large
decline in dividend in the next year,” Josef Nemy, an analyst
at the Prague-based unit of Societe Generale SA, wrote in a
report today. “The 2011 guidance was a strong negative
surprise.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
