Ukraine’s sovereign debt, including
state loan guarantees, gained 0.6 percent in January from the
previous month after the country sold $100 million of Eurobonds
to help finance the  budget deficit .  Total debt climbed to $54.6 billion at the end of January,
compared with $54.3 billion a year ago, the Kiev-based  Finance
Ministry  said in a  statement  on its website today.  Domestic state debt was at $17.8 billion as of Jan. 31,
little changed from a month ago, while the amount owed to
foreign creditors rose to $23.1 billion from $22.8 billion in
December, the ministry said.  Ukraine’s government debt, including state guarantees,
jumped an annual 36 percent in 2010 after the government
borrowed money from the  International Monetary Fund  and sold
bonds to plug the shortfall and help state-owned companies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
