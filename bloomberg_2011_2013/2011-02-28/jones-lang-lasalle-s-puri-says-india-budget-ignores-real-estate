Anuj Puri, chairman at the Indian
unit of Jones Lang LaSalle Inc. comments on  India ’s budget.  India will cut the  budget deficit  to 4.6 percent of its
gross domestic product in the fiscal year ending in March 2012,
Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee said in his annual budget
speech in parliament today. India will extend an interest rate
subsidy on housing loans, Mukherjee said.  “It would seem that the budget pointedly ignored the
larger issues affecting the Indian real estate sector at this
sensitive stage of revival and growth.  ‘‘Special economic zones have been brought under the
purview of minimum alternate tax, which basically diminishes the
benefits that such zones offer for developers over other
commercial real estate asset classes.  ‘‘Raising the priority home loan limit from 2 million
rupees ($44,000) to 2.5 million rupees is good news for the low
income group segment, but will do nothing to ease the pain in
the metropolitan cities, where real estate prices and therefore
demand for affordable housing is highest. Companies such as  Unitech Ltd . and  Ansal Properties & Infrastructure Ltd ., which
are rolling out budget housing, will be benefited by increase in
volumes.  ‘‘The 1 percent interest subvention for home loans up to
1.5 million rupees from the previous limit of 1 million rupees
will come as a relief to home loan borrowers from the low income
group segment.’’  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
