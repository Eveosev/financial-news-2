  Russia ’s RTS stock-index futures
gained, suggesting stocks will advance in Moscow, as oil rose
above $100 a barrel on concern unrest in the Middle East will
disrupt supplies.  Futures on the dollar-denominated index expiring in March
jumped 0.6 percent to 199,405 at 3:50 p.m. in New York
yesterday. The Market Vectors Russia ETF, a U.S.-traded fund
that holds Russian shares, climbed 2.5 percent. The Micex Index
rose 0.4 percent to 1,765.38 by the 6:45 p.m. close in Moscow
yesterday.  “Russia benefits from higher  oil prices ,” said  Ian McCall , who helps oversee about $500 million of emerging-market
debt as a director at Argo Capital Management Ltd. in  London .
“There is a lot of uncertainty over the outlook of oil supplies
from Libya and the region, while Russia looks pretty stable.”  Contracts on OAO Gazprom, the natural-gas export monopoly,
rose 0.6 percent, while contracts on OAO Rosneft, the country’s
biggest oil producer, advanced 0.3 percent.  Oil climbed to a 29-monrth high as Libyan forces loyal to  Muammar Qaddafi  attacked rebels on the east coast where much of
the country’s oil is refined and shipped abroad. Prices extended
gains after a U.S. Energy Department report showed that crude
and fuel supplies fell last week.  Urals crude, Russia’s main export blend, gained 0.8
percent, to $114.91 a barrel as of 2:40 p.m. in New York
yesterday. Oil, along with natural gas, accounts for a quarter
of Russia’s economic output.  Stable Exporter  “RTS futures are up because energy companies represent a
significant portion of the RTS and energy prices are higher
again today,” Sam Voloshin, the president of Voloshin Capital
Management LLC, said via e-mail. “The Russian market benefits
from the Middle Eastern turmoil as Russia is viewed as a
relatively stable exporter of oil and gas.”  Fighting in  Libya  may have shut as much as 1 million
barrels a day of the North African country’s output, according
to the  International Energy Agency . Riots have toppled leaders
in Tunisia and  Egypt  earlier this year and there have been
protests in Yemen, to the south of  Saudi Arabia , the world’s
biggest crude exporter.  Demonstrators clashed with security forces in  Iran ’s
capital of Tehran on March 1. Iran pumped 3.7 million barrels of
oil a day in February, the second-biggest producer in the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, according to
Bloomberg News estimates.  U.S. Job Market  U.S. stocks rose on signs that the job market is
strengthening. The S&P 500 advanced 0.2 percent to 1,308.42 at 4
p.m. in  New York  after a private report showed that companies in
the U.S. added more workers in February than forecast.
Employment increased by 217,000 last month after a revised
189,000 gain in January, according to figures from ADP Employer
Services. The median estimate in the Bloomberg News survey
called for a 180,000 gain last month.  European stocks dropped for a second day yesterday. The
Stoxx Europe 600 Index fell 0.7 percent. Russian stocks climbed
for the second day this week as oil topped $100 a barrel. The
dollar-denominated RTS Index jumped 1.5 percent to 1,991.29.  OAO Rosneft, Russia’s biggest oil producer, gained 0.6
percent, while OAO Severstal, the country’s largest steelmaker,
increased 3.2 percent. OAO Novatek, Russia’s second-largest
natural gas producer, added 1.2 percent, while OAO Aeroflot
increased 0.7 percent, and Gazprom rose 1.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
