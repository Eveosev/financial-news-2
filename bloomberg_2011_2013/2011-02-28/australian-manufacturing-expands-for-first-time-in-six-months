Australian manufacturing expanded in
February for the first time in six months as measures of new
orders and restocking gained and the central bank paused
interest-rate increases.  The manufacturing index advanced to 51.1 from 46.7, the
Australian Industry Group and PricewaterhouseCoopers said in a
survey released in Canberra today. A number above 50 indicates
expansion. Inventories rose to 52.1 from 38.9, the report
showed. New orders climbed to 52.3 from 45.1 a month earlier.  The rebound at factories comes as the  mining industry  is
expanding to meet Chinese demand for raw materials and pushing
the job market near full employment. Manufacturers are absorbing
the Australian currency’s 13 percent advance against the  U.S.
dollar  in the past year, driven by the central bank’s seven rate
increases from October 2009 to November last year.  “While only reflecting a single month’s improvement, the
result underlines the resilience of the sector in the face of
extremely tough trading conditions and the impact of the strong
dollar,”  Heather Ridout , chief executive officer of the
industry group, said in a statement.  The index’s reading on wages climbed 0.9 point to 62.2,
while inventories gained 13.2 points to 52.1, today’s report
showed. Supplier deliveries advanced 13.3 points to 59.1.  A gauge of employment dropped 4 points to 45 in February,
and new orders increased 7.2 points to 52.3, the report showed.
The production measure fell 1 point to 49.3.  The manufacturing survey, which is similar to the U.S. ISM
index, polled more than 200 companies about production, new
orders, deliveries, inventories and employment.  To contact the reporter on this story:  Michael Heath  in Sydney at
