Nintendo Co., the world’s largest
maker of handheld video-game players, fell on the  Osaka 
Securities Exchange after the company started selling its 3DS
portable machines.  Nintendo dropped 3.6 percent to 24,100 yen as of the 11 a.m.
trading break, the fourth-biggest decline on the  MSCI World 
Index. The benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock Average slid 0.6 percent.  The 3DS, which allows users to see 3-D images without
special glasses, debuted two days ago in Japan with eight titles,
including Capcom Co.’s “Super Street Fighter IV: 3D Edition.”
Nintendo, based in Osaka, Japan, last month reiterated its
September plan to ship 4 million 3DS units in its first month to
prevent shortages.  “Those who expected a positive impact by the new model
have already bought the shares,” said Satoru Kikuchi, an
analyst at Deutsche Bank AG in Tokyo who has a “hold” rating
on the stock. “There isn’t a wide variety of software for 3DS
yet. That may slow the sales growth.”  The 3DS player will go on sale in the U.S. on March 27 at
$250 each, accompanied by 18 titles, according to the Kyoto-
based company. Sales in  Europe  are scheduled to begin March 25,
according to Nintendo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
