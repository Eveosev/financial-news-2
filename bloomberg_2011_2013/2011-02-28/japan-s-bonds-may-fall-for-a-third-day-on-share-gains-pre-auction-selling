Japan’s bonds fell for a third day
as shares around the world climbed and  oil prices  declined after  Saudi Arabia  offered to make up for petroleum supplies lost
because of unrest in  Libya .  Benchmark 10-year yields rose to a one-week high as today’s
auction of the securities drew less demand than traders
expected. Bonds also fell after data showed Japanese payrolls
increased in January and as the yen retreated from near a three-
week high against the dollar.  “The global economy continues to improve, and this
optimism is overcoming concerns about lingering conflicts in the
Middle East,” said  Shinji Nomura , chief debt strategist at
Nikko Cordial Securities Inc. in Tokyo. “You can’t say the
auction was good, reflecting the market’s sentiment.”  The benchmark 10-year yield gained 1.5 basis points to
1.270 percent as of 3:18 p.m. in Tokyo at Japan Bond Trading
Co., the nation’s largest interdealer debt broker. That’s the
highest level since Feb. 22. A basis point is 0.01 percentage
point. The 1.2 percent security maturing in December 2020 fell
0.13 yen to 99.39 yen.  Ten-year bond futures for March delivery declined 0.19 to
139.35 at the 3 p.m. close of the Tokyo Stock Exchange.  The  Nikkei 225  Stock Average advanced 1.2 percent and the
MSCI Asia Pacific Index of regional shares climbed 0.9 percent.  Oil, Stocks  Saudi Arabian Oil Co. Chief Executive Officer Khalid Al- Falih said yesterday the kingdom is ready to cover a shortfall
in crude supply, without specifying how much the company would
provide.  Crude oil for April delivery declined to $96.97 a barrel on
the  New York Mercantile Exchange  yesterday, the biggest daily
drop since Feb. 11. The MSCI World Index rose 0.8 percent.  The lowest price at the 10-year auction was 99.82 yen, less
than 99.89 yen predicted by 13 traders in a Bloomberg News
survey.  The lowest price was 0.09 yen below the average, up from a
difference of 0.06 yen at the previous sale on Feb. 1. The so-
called tail is the difference between the two levels. The longer
the tail, fewer bids are clustered around the average price.  “The auction result was a little bit weak,” said RuiXue Xu, strategist in Tokyo at RBS Securities Japan Ltd., a unit of
Royal Bank of Scotland Plc. “Higher stock prices and a weaker
yen are creating negative conditions for debt.”  The yen declined 0.4 percent against the dollar to 82.21,
after touching 81.62 yen yesterday, the strongest since Feb. 4.  A weaker yen boosts the value of overseas income at
Japanese companies when converted into their home currency.  To contact the reporters on this story:
