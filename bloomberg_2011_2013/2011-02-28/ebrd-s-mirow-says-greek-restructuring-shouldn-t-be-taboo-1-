European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development President Thomas Mirow said talk of a debt
restructuring for  Greece  shouldn’t be “taboo.”  “I think it is wrong to taboo it,” Mirow told reporters
in Brussels today. A debt burden of 150 percent to 160 percent
of gross domestic product is “unbearable,” he said.  Greece’s gross debt is forecast to rise to 159.4 percent of
GDP in 2012 before declining to 158.9 percent in 2013, according
to a  report  by the European Union released on Feb. 24, following
a review of the country’s progress under a 110 billion-euro
($152 billion) EU and International Monetary Fund bailout last
May. The country already has the highest debt burden in the EU.  Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou is pressing EU
leaders for lower  interest rates  on bailout aid as well as an
extension of maturities of the EU and IMF loans before a March
meeting at which they will outline a comprehensive plan to stem
the debt crisis. He’s repeatedly said the country won’t
restructure its debt.  “It probably makes more sense to address” Greece’s debt
“in a timely manner than to postpone it,” Mirow said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
