OAO Gazprom, Russia’s gas export
monopoly, has increased shipments to Italy to 48 million cubic
meters a day to replace supply lost when a pipeline from  Libya 
to Sicily was shut last week.  Before the crisis in the North African country, Gazprom had
been shipping 30 million cubic meters a day,  Sergei Kupriyanov ,
a Gazprom spokesman, said today by telephone. Supplies were
boosted to 40 million cubic meters a day on Feb. 22, he said.  Italy may have a shortage of 7.9 billion cubic meters of
gas if the Greenstream pipeline from Libya remains halted,
Societe Generale SA said on Feb. 25 in an e-mailed report. The
drop in supplies may let  Eni SpA , Italy’s biggest oil company,
reduce a surplus of prepaid Russian gas, the bank said.  Italy, which gets about 10 percent of its gas from the
stopped pipeline, had 8.9 billion cubic meters of gas reserves,
Industry Minister Paolo Romani said on Feb. 23.  To contact the reporter on this story:
