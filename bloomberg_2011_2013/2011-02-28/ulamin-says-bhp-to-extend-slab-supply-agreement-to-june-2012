  Hulamin Ltd .,  Africa ’s largest maker
of fabricated aluminum products, said  BHP Billiton Ltd . agreed
to extend a rolling-slab supply deal by a year until June 2012.  “We’re absolutely very happy because strategically it’s an
important source for us,” Richard Jacob, chief executive
officer of Pietermaritzburg, South Africa-based Hulamin, said by
phone from Johannesburg today. Hulamin has “an understanding”
BHP is willing to discuss an extension beyond that, he said.  Hulamin sources about 90,000 metric tons of slab metal a
year from BHP to produce sheet, plate and foil. BHP, the world’s
biggest mining company, said in 2008 it would close part of its
Bayside plant on South Africa’s northeast coast because of power
shortages at national power utility Eskom Holdings Ltd.  Hulamin reported net income fell to 73.3 million rand ($11
million) last year, from 89.6 million rand, because of local
currency gains and as labor and electricity costs increased. The
company didn’t declare an annual dividend.  Hulamin rose 17 cents, or 2.3 percent, to 7.72 rand by the
5 p.m. close of Johannesburg trading, paring the decline in the
past year to 24 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
