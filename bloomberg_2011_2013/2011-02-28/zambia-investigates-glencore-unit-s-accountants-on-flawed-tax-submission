The Zambia Institute of Chartered
Accountants may punish the accountants of Mopani Copper Mines
Plc, a unit of Glencore International AG, if they were complicit
in “flawed” tax submissions.  “We need maximum cooperation from the company and if those
interviewed are found wanting, necessary punitive measures shall
be imposed,” Chintu Mulendema, president of the association,
known as Zica, said by phone on Feb. 26 from Lusaka, the
capital. Their practising licenses could be suspended, he said.  There may have been “irregularities” in the company’s tax
submissions for the 2008 fiscal year, Wisdom Nekairo, the
director general of the Zambia Revenue Authority, said on Feb.
13. The southern African nation,  Africa ’s largest copper
producer, hired Grant Thornton Zambia and Econ Poyry, a
Norwegian consulting and engineering company, in February 2009
to audit mining companies operating in the country Nekairo said.
They produced a preliminary report in November.  Emmanuel Mutati, Mopani’s chief executive officer, didn’t
answer calls or respond to messages on his mobile phone when
Bloomberg News called for comment. The findings in the report
are preliminary and the report is “flawed,” Mopani said in a
statement in the state-owned Times of Zambia on Feb. 25.  Zambia plans to produce about 2 million tons of copper by
2015, according to Finance Minister  Situmbeko Musokotwane . The
southern African country earns about 70 percent of its foreign
currency from copper exports, according to the Central Bank of
Zambia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
