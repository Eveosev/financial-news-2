Bulgarian January producer prices
slowed for the first time since September on an annual basis in
April on mining and quarrying and tobacco production costs.  Factory-gate prices slowed the pace of acceleration to 11.1
percent, after an increase of 12 percent in December, the
 National Statistics Institute  in Sofia said on its  website 
today. In the month, prices rose 0.5 percent.  The European Union’s poorest member, with per-capita gross
domestic product that’s 42 percent of the bloc’s average, is
emerging from its first recession in 12 years after a three-year
lending boom stalled and foreign investment dried up. The
economy grew 0.3 percent in 2010 and the government estimates it
will expand 3.7 percent this year.  The government is counting on demand abroad for Bulgarian
metals, machinery, textiles and furniture to help boost growth.
Exports rose an annual 10.7 percent in the fourth quarter after
an 18.6 percent increase in the previous three months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
