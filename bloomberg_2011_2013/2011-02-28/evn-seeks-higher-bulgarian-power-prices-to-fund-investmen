  EVN AG , Austria’s second-biggest
utility that runs power distributors in southern Bulgaria, will
ask Bulgaria’s energy regulator to raise power prices 5 percent
to fund investment.  The increase also reflects annual inflation of 4.5 percent
last year, EVN’s Bulgarian unit said in an e-mailed statement.
The rate rise would take effect July 1 and hasn’t yet been
approved by the State Energy & Water Regulation Commission.  EVN has 1.5 million customers in Plovdiv and Stara Zagora,
Bulgaria. The company invested 720 million lev ($509 million) in
the six years since it bought the Bulgarian power distributors.  Bulgaria sold seven power distributors in 2005 to  CEZ AS ,
central Europe’s largest power company, EVN and Germany’s  E.ON
AG  for 680 million euros ($940 million), before joining the
European Union on Jan. 1, 2007.  To contact the reporter on this story:
