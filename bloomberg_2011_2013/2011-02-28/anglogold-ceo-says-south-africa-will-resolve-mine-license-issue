  AngloGold Ashanti Ltd ., the largest
South African producer of the metal, said the government will be
able to resolve disputes about overlapping mining licenses.  “I think it’s right for South Africans to be concerned
because they’ve not had that problem in the past, but you see it
all over the world,” Chief Executive Officer Mark Cutifani said
today in a Bloomberg Television interview in Hollywood, Florida.
“There’s a strategy with the government over the next six
months to get that sorted and I believe we will get that sorted
out.”  Disputes over licensing in South Africa have involved Anglo
American Plc’s Kumba Iron Ore unit,  Impala Platinum Holdings
Ltd . and Lonmin Plc over the past year. Minister of Mining Susan Shabangu said Feb. 7 that the government needs to “revisit that
particular area” as part of a review of  South Africa ’s new
Mining Act. She also said the state won’t alter mining rights
already granted.  To contact the reporter on this story:
