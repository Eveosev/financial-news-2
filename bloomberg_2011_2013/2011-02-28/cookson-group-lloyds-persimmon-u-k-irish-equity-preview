U.K. stocks fell as the European
Commission lowered its economic growth forecast for the U.K. and
Saudi Arabian shares plunged the most since November 2008 on
concern that political unrest may spread to the kingdom.    Kingfisher Plc , Europe’s largest home-improvement retailer,
and Marks & Spencer Group Plc, the U.K.’s biggest clothing
retailer, declined.  HMV Group Plc  plunged 22 percent after
saying net income will miss estimates.  HSBC Holdings Plc 
retreated 3 percent after UBS AG and Deutsche Bank AG downgraded
the shares.  The benchmark  FTSE 100 Index  retreated 58.25, or 1 percent,
to 5,935.76 in  London . The  FTSE All-Share Index  lost 0.9 percent
and Ireland’s ISEQ Index slipped 0.7 percent.  “What’s weighing on stocks is declines in the Saudi
market,” said Bill Ismail, a senior sales trader at City Index
Ltd. in London. “If the Saudis start a revolution, I think the
impact will be very heavy on the stock market. That’s what’s
spooking the stock market.”  The FTSE 100 has slid 1.8 percent from its highest level
this year on Feb. 7. as investors speculated that Arab revolts
against unpopular leaders in  Tunisia , Egypt and Libya will push  oil prices  higher, curbing global economic growth.  In Libya, armed rebels in Zawiyah, the nearest population
center to Tripoli to fall to leader  Muammar Qaddafi ’s opponents,
stationed themselves at the entrances to the city after
repelling an overnight attack by pro-Qaddafi fighters, Ibrahim
al-Hajj, a 58-year-old resident, said by telephone. Forces loyal
to Qaddafi retook control of Libya’s western border with Tunisia
yesterday before attacking and failing to recapture Zawiyah and
Misratah, another city in the west of the country.  Economic Growth  The European Commission cut its forecast for economic
growth in the U.K. in 2011 to 2 percent from the 2.2 percent
that it predicted last November. That still beats the U.K.’s 1.4
percent growth in 2010, the commission said. Gross domestic
product in the euro area may increase 1.6 percent in 2011, a
faster pace than the Brussels-based commission’s earlier
forecast for growth of 1.5 percent.  Kingfisher sank 4.5 percent to 243 pence. Marks & Spencer
slid 1.9 percent to 339.8 pence.  HMV tumbled 22 percent to 16.3 pence, the lowest price
since its initial public offering in 2002. The U.K.’s biggest
high-street retailer of CDs and DVDs said full-year pretax
profit before one-off items will probably be “moderately
below” analysts’ estimates, and it may not meet some banking
covenant tests.  HSBC, Cookson  HSBC declined 3 percent to 658 pence after Deutsche Bank
cut its recommendation on the stock to “hold” from “buy.”  Europe ’s largest bank by sales was downgraded to “neutral”
from buy at UBS.  Cookson jumped 5.2 percent to 688 pence after the world’s
biggest maker of ceramic linings for metal smelters said pretax
profit rose to 222.1 million pounds ($362.1 million) in 2010
from 75.7 million pounds in 2009 as revenue increased 30 percent
to 2.55 billion pounds. Cookson generated 145.3 million pounds
of net income in 2010, beating the average analyst estimate for
a 142.3 million-pound profit.  The following shares rose or fell. Stock symbols are in
parentheses.    Meggitt Plc  (MGGT LN) added 4 percent to 351.7 pence. The
U.K. maker of engine-monitoring systems for Airbus SAS and
Boeing Co. planes said full-year underlying pretax profit rose 9
percent as orders at its civil and energy businesses recovered.
Pretax profit excluding amortization and financing costs
increased to 256.1 million pounds in 2010 from 234.2 million
pounds in 2009.    Provident Financial Plc  (PFG LN) slid 5.2 percent to 979.5
pence. The U.K.’s biggest subprime lender said full-year profit
climbed 15 percent. Net income advanced to 101.5 million pounds,
missing the 102.5 million-pound median estimate of analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg.    United Business Media Ltd . (UBM LN) sank 8.6 percent to 651
pence, the largest decline in the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.
Collins Stewart Plc said the company faces margin pressure in
its News Distribution and Data businesses.  To contact the reporter on this story:
