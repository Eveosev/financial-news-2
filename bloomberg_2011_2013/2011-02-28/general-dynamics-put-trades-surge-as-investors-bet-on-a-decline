(Corrects put-option volume in second paragraph.)    General Dynamics Corp . put volume
rose to the highest level since March 2009, boosted by bets on a
decline of around 15 percent in the shares by January.  About 5,800 puts to sell the stock changed hands as of 3:40
p.m. in New York, 9 times the four-week average and more than 11
times the number of calls to buy. The most-traded contracts were
the January $65 puts, which accounted for almost two-thirds of
all put volume and rose 6 percent to $3.50. The  Falls Church ,
Virginia-based defense company gained 0.2 percent to $76.06.  General Dynamics gained 4.8 percent in the past year,
compared with a 27 percent increase in the Standard and Poor’s
500 Industrials Index. The share of Pentagon contract dollars
awarded to General Dynamics, Lockheed Martin Corp., Boeing Co.,
Northrop Grumman Corp. and Raytheon Co. dropped to 24.6 percent
last year from 35.9 percent in 2001, data compiled by Bloomberg
show.  U.S. Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates, who has targeted
$78 billion in cuts through 2016 for deficit reduction, on Jan.
6 proposed canceling General Dynamics’s amphibious vehicle for
the U.S. Marine Corps.  Ashton Carter , undersecretary of defense
for acquisitions, asked the Navy to have ready by mid-April a
cancellation plan for General Dynamics Corp.’s Expeditionary
Fighting Vehicle program.  General Dynamics’ implied volatility, the key gauge of
option prices, for at-the-money options expiring in 30 days rose
to 20.96 from 20.36 on Feb. 25.  Calls give the right to buy 100 shares of a security for a
certain amount, the strike price, by a set date. Puts convey the
right to sell. Investors use options to guard against
fluctuations in the price of securities they own, speculate on
share-price moves or bet that volatility, or stock swings, will
rise or fall.  To contact the reporter on this story:
