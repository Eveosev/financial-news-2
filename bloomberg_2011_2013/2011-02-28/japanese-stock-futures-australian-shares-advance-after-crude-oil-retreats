Japanese stock futures and
Australian shares rose after a decline in  oil prices  eased
concern about energy costs and U.S. data showing higher personal
incomes boosted confidence in economic growth.  American depositary receipts of Honda Motor Co., Japan’s
second-biggest carmaker, gained 0.8 percent from the closing
share price in Tokyo. Those of Sony Corp., Japan’s largest
electronics exporter, advanced 0.7 percent. BHP Billiton Ltd.,
the world’s No. 1 mining company, climbed 0.6 percent in Sydney.  Futures on Japan’s  Nikkei 225  Stock Average expiring in
March closed at 10,675 in  Chicago  yesterday, compared with
10,630 in Osaka, Japan. They were bid in the pre-market at
10,670 in Osaka at 8:05 a.m. local time.  Australia ’s S&P/ASX 200
Index rose 0.2 percent today.  “Although there’s still uncertainty about what’s happening
in North Africa and the Middle East, easing crude futures are
supportive” for the stock market, said Fumiyuki Nakanishi a
strategist at Tokyo-based SMBC Friend Securities Co. “The data
continues to show the economy is steadily improving.”  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index were little
changed today. The index advanced 0.6 percent in New York
yesterday after reports showed personal income improved more
than economists expected and a measure of U.S. business
conditions rose to its highest level in more than 22 years.  Higher U.S. Incomes  In the U.S., incomes climbed 1 percent in January,
exceeding the median forecast of economists surveyed and the
most since May 2009, according to figures from the Commerce
Department yesterday in  Washington .  The Institute for Supply Management-Chicago Inc. said
yesterday its business barometer rose to 71.2 in February, the
highest level since July 1988, from 68.8 in January. Figures
greater than 50 signal expansion. The gauge, which was projected
to fall, exceeded every estimate of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index lost 0.2 percent through
yesterday in 2011, compared with gains of 5.5 percent by the S&P
500 and 3.9 percent by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Stocks in the
Asian benchmark are valued at 13.8 times estimated earnings on
average, compared with 13.8 times for the  S&P 500  and 11.4 times
for the Stoxx 600.    Crude oil  for April delivery declined 0.9 percent to settle
at $96.97 a barrel in  New York  yesterday, the biggest daily drop
since Feb. 11, after  Saudi Arabia  offered to make up for
supplies lost because of unrest in Libya.  Yen Relief  The yen’s depreciation should also give a lift to Japan’s
exporters today, SMBC’s Nakanishi said. The currency fell to as
low as 81.98 against the dollar, compared with 81.66 at the
close of  stock trading  in Tokyo yesterday. Against the euro,
Japan’s currency weakened to 113.35 from 112.39. A weaker yen
boosts the value of overseas income at Japanese companies when
converted into their home currency.  Japan’s statistics bureau is scheduled to report the
nation’s unemployment rate for January at 8:30 a.m. today in
Tokyo. The jobless rate in the month was unchanged at 4.9
percent from December, according to the median forecast of 29
economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
