  Fortescue Metals Group Ltd .,  Australia ’s third-largest iron ore exporter, rose the most in
two weeks in Sydney after saying it discovered a 1 billion-
metric-ton deposit near its existing operations.  The Perth-based company rose 2.2 percent to A$6.64 at the
close on the Australian stock exchange, for it’s biggest gain
since Feb. 14.  The discovery, named Nyidinghu, is about 35 kilometers (22
miles) south of Fortescue’s Cloudbreak operation in  Western
Australia  and contains an inferred resource of 1.032 billion
tons of the ore used to make steel at a grade of 58 percent
iron, the company said in a statement after the market closed on
Feb. 25.  “Fortescue is commencing a feasibility study with a view
to developing this deposit as rapidly as possible,” the company
said in the statement. “This maiden estimate is expected to
grow as further drill results come in.”  Citigroup Inc. upgraded its recommendation on Fortescue to
“buy” from “hold” because of the discovery, analysts led by
Clarke Wilkins said in a report today.  The company is spending $8.4 billion expanding its mines to
almost triple output to supply  steel mills  in  China . The average
price of its ore in the second half of 2010 rose to $138.50 a
ton from $67.58 a year earlier.  The company now controls almost 7 billion tons of hematite
ore and a further 2.5 billion tons of magnetite ore, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
