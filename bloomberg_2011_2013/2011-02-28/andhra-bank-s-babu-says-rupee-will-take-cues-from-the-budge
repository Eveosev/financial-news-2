Vikas Babu, a currency trader at the
state-owned  Andhra Bank  in Mumbai, comments on the outlook for  India ’s rupee.  One-month non-deliverable forwards for the currency gained
0.1 percent to 45.59 per dollar as of 11:33 a.m. in Singapore,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The contracts reflect
bets the rupee will decline 0.6 percent from the spot rate of
45.3090.  “I see the rupee being weak or range-bound today unless we
see some news from the budget on curtailing the deficit. The
major direction will come from the budget.  “In the next two to three months, I see the rupee being
weak because of the crisis in the Middle East. India being a
major importer of crude, a rise in oil prices has the potential
to dent the Indian economy. High  oil prices  and inflationary
pressures can slow the economy.  “In the long term, the rupee is going to appreciate as
India’s economic growth story is still on.”  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
