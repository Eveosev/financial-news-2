Yemen’s opposition coalition
rejected calls from President Ali Abdullah Saleh for a national
unity government and said he should listen to the voices of
protesters and step down.  The opposition also called for a ‘Day of Rage’ tomorrow to
mark the deaths of demonstrators.  “We will not join a national unity government and we
support demands of the people who went to the streets to demand
the president leave,” Mohammed al-Qubati, spokesman for the
Joint Meetings Parties, a coalition of six opposition groups,
said in a telephone interview today. “He should respond to the
demands of the people and leave power peacefully.”  Saleh on Feb. 2 called for the formation of a unity
government and said he won’t seek to extend his term when it
expires in 2013. About a dozen people have been killed in almost
three weeks of protests inspired by the popular uprisings that
overthrew the leaders of Tunisia and  Egypt . Three security
officers died in recent clashes, the ruling party’s website Al-
Motamar said today.  Thirteen opposition lawmakers resigned from parliament
today to protest the crackdown on demonstrators, according to an
e-mailed statement today from the members of parliament. The
legislators, from the provinces of Aden and Hadramaut, demanded
the release of political prisoners and an end to violent attacks
against protesters.  Eleven legislators from the ruling General People’s
Congress have resigned from the party since the protests began.  To contact the reporter on this story:
