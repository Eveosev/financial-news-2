Cameroon’s  arabica coffee price for
export was 2,467  CFA francs  ($5.18) in the week to Feb. 27,
according to the country’s Cocoa and Coffee Board.  A “technical problem” in the Douala-based board’s office
meant the figure was not provided for two months, General
Manager Michael Ndoping said by phone today. The last figures
available were an average export price of 2,125 francs in the
week to Dec. 28.  Total production for 2010 was 3,500 metric tons,
representing 6 percent of the country’s total coffee production,
Ndoping said on Feb. 21.  To contact the reporter on this story:
