Oman crude, a Persian Gulf benchmark
for  Asia , rose for a seven month, topping $100 for the first
time since October 2008, as concerns of potential supply
disruptions in the Middle East prompted purchases.  The April official selling price for Oman will be $100.39 a
barrel, based on the average of daily futures settlement prices
on the Dubai Mercantile Exchange, according to a statement by
the exchange today. The medium-sulfur crude is 8.5 percent more
expensive than February’s price of $92.51. Today’s settlement at
12:30 p.m. Dubai time was $108.57, the exchange said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
