Winds as powerful as a hurricane
yesterday shut  Alaska ’s port of Valdez, where the state’s oil is
loaded onto tankers, the AP said, citing the National Weather
Service.  Winds peaked at 95 miles per hour on Feb. 26, prompting the
port to shut, the news service said. The Alyeska Pipeline Co.
terminal is open and oil from the system is being loaded into  storage tanks , the AP said.  The winds have caused flying debris to shatter windows and
blow siding off buildings, the news service said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
