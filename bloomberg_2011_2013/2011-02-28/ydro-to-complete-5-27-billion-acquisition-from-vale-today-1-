  Vale SA , the world’s largest iron
ore producer, completed the sale of bauxite and alumina assets
to Norwegian aluminum producer  Norsk Hydro ASA .  Vale acquired 22 percent, or $3.5 billion, of Hydro’s
outstanding shares, and received $503 million in cash for the
assets, Vale said in a statement today. Vale also transferred
“off-take rights and outstanding commercial contracts” and net
debt of $655 million to Hydro, according to the statement.  The transaction will be valued at about $5.27 billion at
its closing, Hydro said in an earlier statement. It was worth
$4.9 billion on May 2, when it announced the deal. Vale also
sold 60 percent of the Paragominas bauxite mine to Hydro for
$578 million in cash, according to the Brazilian company.  Hydro, which will obtain a century of raw material from
Vale’s bauxite mining and alumina refinery assets in  Brazil ,
postponed the completion from the fourth quarter because of
delays in obtaining approval from regulators.  “We can finally initiate all actions that we’ve been
planning,” Chief Executive Officer Svein Richard Brandtzaeg
said today in an interview at Hydro’s office in  Rio de Janeiro .
“The first part is to integrate the organization and assets.”
He declined to disclose the planned level of investment.  Hydro rose as much as 3.5 percent to 46.20 kroner in Oslo
trading and was at 46.14 kroner by 2:57 p.m. local time.  Second-Biggest Owner  The deal gives Hydro control of Brazil’s Paragominas, one
of the world’s biggest mines for bauxite used to make aluminum,
as well as 91 percent of Alunorte, the largest alumina refinery.
Hydro also gets 51 percent of the Albras aluminum plant and 81
percent of the CAP alumina refinery project. It already owns 34
percent of Alunorte and 20 percent of CAP.  Hydro will buy the remaining 40 percent of Paragominas in
two equal tranches in 2013 and 2015, for $200 million each,
according to the statements.  Vale, with 447.83 million shares, became the second-biggest
shareholder after the Norwegian state, with 34.8 percent.  Brandtzaeg said in interviews in January and October that
the company would study expansion in Brazil and  Argentina  after
completing the deal, and increase Hydro’s access to Chinese and
Indian markets. Aluminum producers including United Co. Rusal,
the largest, are expanding their Asian business as demand surges
in the region while consumption in developed nations is subdued.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
