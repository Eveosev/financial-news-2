Aditya Agarwal, executive director
of consumer and healthcare products maker Emami Ltd., comments
on India’s budget for the year starting April 1 after Finance
Minister Pranab Mukherjee today said the government plans to
increase spending on social projects by 17 percent to 1.6
trillion rupees ($35.4 billion).  Agarwal spoke in a telephone interview from Kolkata.  “A lot has been done for rural and farm sector in the
budget, so our rural sales, which account for 40 percent of our
turnover, would go up.  ‘‘Even if there is an increase in the cost of operations, a
hike in rural sales will balance out any possible impact on
profitability and sales for the next year.’’  On investment plans:  ‘‘The budget will not have any impact on Emami’s
investment. Our biggest area of expenditure is marketing and
distribution. We will invest 2 billion rupees in 2011-12 in
marketing.’’  -- With assistance from Malavika Sharma in  New Delhi . Editor:
