Winter-wheat conditions in  Kansas 
deteriorated as dry weather expanded in western growing areas,
the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said. Crops in Oklahoma and
Nebraska also declined, while Texas plants improved.  About 25 percent of the crop in Kansas, the biggest U.S.
winter-wheat grower, was in good or excellent condition as of
yesterday, down from 27  percent  on Jan. 30, the USDA said today
in a report.  About 19 percent of  Oklahomaâ€™s  crop was in good or
excellent condition this month, down from 21 percent at the end
of  January , the USDA said.  Crops in  Nebraska  were rated 40 percent good-to-excellent
for February, down from 41 percent  last month .  In Texas, 18 percent was in  good  or excellent condition as
of yesterday, up from 13 percent a  week earlier .  To contact the reporter on this story:
