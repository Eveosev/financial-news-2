British special forces staged a
second rescue mission to airlift stranded foreign oil workers
from the Libyan desert, extracting 150 people, some of them U.K.
nationals, the  Daily Telegraph  reported, citing Defence
Secretary Liam Fox.  The three Lockheed Hercules aircraft carried a mix of
soldiers from the Special Air Service and Special Boat Service
regiments, and flew to multiple locations last night; a British
warship, the frigate HMS Cumberland, left Benghazi for Malta
last night on its second rescue mission, carrying 200 people of
various nationalities, the newspaper said.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:  Chris Peterson  at
