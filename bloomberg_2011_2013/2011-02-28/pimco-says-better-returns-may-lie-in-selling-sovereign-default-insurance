Pacific Investment Management Co.
sees the potential for better returns from selling insurance
against sovereign defaults than owning  government bonds ,
according to London-based managing director  Andrew Balls .  “Rather than taking exposure to interest-rate risk, it may
be attractive to sell protection against the default of a
country,” Balls told reporters at a media briefing in London
today. “I would see the probability of default from the U.S. or
U.K. as vanishingly small, but there are market participants who
need to hedge their country risk, and so we can be a provider of
insurance.”  In the euro area, “you may find countries, for example,
France or Germany in the core, where again it’s an attractive
proposition to sell the insurance,” Balls said. “It’s hard for
us to see interest rates, yields, for OECD countries going
significantly lower,” he said, referring to the Organization
for Economic Cooperation and Development.  To contact the reporter on this story:
