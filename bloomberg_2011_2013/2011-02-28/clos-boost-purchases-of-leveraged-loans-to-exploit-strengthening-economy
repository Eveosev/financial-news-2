Collateralized loan obligations
bought half of newly issued U.S. leveraged loans sold to non-
bank lenders in the fourth quarter as investors sought floating-
rating debt in the strengthening economy, according to JPMorgan
Chase & Co.  CLOs boosted their portion of the primary institutional
loan market by purchasing 50.1 percent of leveraged loans in the
three months ended Dec. 31, JPMorgan said in a Feb. 25 report.
That compares with an average of 42.3 percent in the first three
quarters of 2010, according to the report.  “New issue CLOs offer exposure to leveraged loans, one of
the most appealing investment options in 2011, with yields on
fixed-rate bonds at or near historic lows and interest rate
volatility already increasing,” JPMorgan analysts, led by
Rishad Ahluwalia and  Peter Acciavatti , wrote in the report.  CLOs are a type of collateralized debt obligation that pool
high-yield, high-risk loans and slice them into securities of
varying risk and return. Their exposure to floating-rate debt is
attractive in an improving economy, the analysts said.  High-yield, high-risk loans are rated below Baa3 by Moody’s
Investors Service and lower than BBB- by  Standard & Poor’s .  To contact the reporter on this story:
