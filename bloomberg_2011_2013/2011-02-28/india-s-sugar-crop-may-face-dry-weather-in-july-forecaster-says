  India ’s sugar cane growing regions in
the north of the country may face dry weather in July and
August, according to Weather Trends International.  The dry weather “could serve as a yield limitation,” the
Bethlehem, Pennsylvania-based Weather Trends said in an e-mailed
report today. India is the second-largest producer of sugar.  Weather in the main growing region in the Center South of  Brazil , the world’s largest producer, will probably be
“favorable” for the crop starting in April, Weather Trends
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
