Wave2Wave Communication Inc., the
Hackensack, New Jersey-based broadband service provider, can’t
withdraw its planned initial public offering, U.S. regulators
said.  The Securities and Exchange Commission denied Wave2Wave’s
Feb. 10 application to withdraw its offering, saying the request
“is not consistent with the public interest and the protection
of investors,” according to a Feb. 24  order  posted on the SEC’s
website.  The company, which first filed for an initial sale in
February 2010, had previously postponed its offering twice and
had originally sought to raise as much as $91 million, Bloomberg
data show. On Jan. 12, the company said it would raise about $14
million, offering 3.3 million units at $4.25 each, according to
a regulatory filing.  SEC spokesman Kevin Callahan declined to comment on why the
request was rejected. A message left with Wave2Wave’s Chief
Executive Officer Aaron Dobrinsky wasn’t immediately returned.  The SEC’s order was reported earlier by the website
Blogmosaic.  To contact the reporter on this story:
