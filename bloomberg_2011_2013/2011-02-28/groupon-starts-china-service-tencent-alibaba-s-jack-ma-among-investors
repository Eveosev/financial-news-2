Groupon Inc., owner of the biggest
coupon website, said it started an online group-buying service
in  China  as consumers in the world’s fastest-growing major
economy increase spending over the Internet.  The Gaopeng.com website will initially cover Beijing and
Shanghai before expanding to other major Chinese cities,
Chicago-based Groupon said in an e-mailed statement today.  Tencent Holdings Ltd ., China’s biggest Internet company, and
 Yunfeng Capital , a private equity fund started by Alibaba Group
Holding Ltd. Chairman Jack Ma, are other investors in Gaopeng,
according to the statement, which didn’t provide details of the
shareholding.  Groupon’s Gaopeng.com will face competition in attracting
Internet shoppers from Chinese group-buying services including
 Lashou.com  and  Meituan.com . Online retail sales in China almost
doubled last year to 513.1 billion yuan ($78 billion) and will
probably double again in the next two years to 1 trillion yuan,
Xinhua News Agency reported Jan. 18.  Groupon, which rejected a $6 billion takeover bid from
Google Inc. in December, plans to increase the number of
employees at its China venture to 1,000 in three months from 120
staff, Danny Yeung, head of its  Hong Kong  unit, said Feb. 10.  Alibaba Group, controlled by Ma, is China’s biggest e-
commerce company. The Hangzhou, eastern China-based company’s  Alibaba.com Ltd . unit last week said David Wei resigned as Chief
Executive Officer after an internal probe found more than 2,300
vendors used its website to defraud global buyers.  To contact the reporter on this story:  Mark Lee  in Hong Kong at
