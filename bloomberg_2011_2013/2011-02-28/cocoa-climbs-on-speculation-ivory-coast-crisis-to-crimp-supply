Cocoa rose for a second day in New
York on speculation supplies will be disrupted as fighting
persists in the  Ivory Coast , the world’s largest producer.  Escalating violence between supporters of incumbent
President  Laurent Gbagbo  and  Alassane Ouattara , the
internationally recognized winner of the Nov. 28 elections,
threatens to bring the West African country closer to civil war,
the DPA news agency cited UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon as
saying Feb. 25. Ouattara called for a month long ban on cocoa
exports on Jan. 23 in a bid to cut off Gbagbo’s funds. The ban
was extended last week until mid-March.  “It’s reaching a point that the likelihood of a civil war
is pretty close,” Gary Mead, an analyst at VM Group said today
by phone from London. “I think the price could go higher.”  Cocoa for May delivery climbed $31, or 0.9 percent, to
$3,670 a ton at 7:20 a.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in  New York . Cocoa
