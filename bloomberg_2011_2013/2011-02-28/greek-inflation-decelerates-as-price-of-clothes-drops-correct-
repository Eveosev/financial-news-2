  Greece ’s inflation rate, the second-
highest in the euro area, fell in January as cheaper clothes and
footwear offset the effect of higher alcohol and tobacco taxes.  Consumer prices calculated using European Union methods
advanced 4.9 percent from a year earlier, compared with a 5.2
percent increase in December, the  Hellenic Statistical Authority 
said in an e-mailed statement from Athens today. The inflation
rate based on Greek methodology was unchanged at 5.2 percent in
January, according to figures released on Feb. 10.  The cost of transport was 13.5 percent higher last month
from a year earlier, while alcohol and tobacco were 19.7 percent
more expensive, according to today’s statement. Clothing prices
dropped 2.7 percent.  The government increased the sales tax and excise duty on
alcohol and tobacco in its 2011 budget, which came into effect
in January. Many retailers have absorbed part of the sales-tax
hikes rather than pass them on to consumers, whose purchasing
power has been weakened by two years of recession.  To contact the reporter on this story:
