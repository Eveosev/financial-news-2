NYSE Euronext, the parent company of
the  New York  Stock Exchange, was sued by the Louisiana Municipal
Police Employees’ Retirement System in an effort to stop a
planned $9.53 billion sale to  Deutsche Boerse AG .  The proposed deal, which would create the largest owner of
equities and derivatives markets, won’t offer a fair price to
NYSE’s public shareholders, the Louisiana pension fund said in a
class-action complaint filed Feb. 25 in New York State Supreme
Court in Manhattan. The suit also names  Deutsche Boerse  and the
NYSE’s board as defendants.  “In light of defendants’ breach of their fiduciary duties
in agreeing to an unreasonably low price for the sale of the
NYSE and agreeing to unreasonable and draconian deal
protections,” shareholders are “entitled to enjoin the
proposed transaction or, alternatively, to recover damages in
the event the proposed transaction is consummated,” according
to the complaint.  Under the planned sale, Deutsche Boerse, which runs the
Eurex futures platform and Frankfurt Stock Exchange, will swap
one share of its own stock for one share in the new company,
while every  NYSE Euronext  share will be converted into 0.47 of a
share. Shareholders have filed other lawsuits over the deal in
Delaware and New York.    Eric Ryan , a spokesman for NYSE, declined to comment today.
Naomi Kim, a spokeswoman for Deutsche Boerse, had no immediate
comment.  The case is Louisiana Municipal Police Employees’
Retirement System v. NYSE Euronext, 650537-2011, New York State
Supreme Court (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
