Shares of the following companies
had unusual moves in Philippine trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses, and prices are as of the noon close in  Manila .  The Philippine Stock Exchange Index rose 0.8 percent to
3,766.73, the steepest gain since Feb. 17. The measure fell 3
percent this month, its first back-to-back monthly loss since
January 2009.    Aboitiz Equity Ventures Inc . (AEV PM), which has
investments in power and banks, surged 18 percent to 47 pesos,
the highest close since it began trading in November 1994. The
stock will be added to the MSCI Philippines Index at the end of
the day, the index compiler said in a statement Feb. 10.    Cebu Air Inc . (CEB PM), the nation’s biggest budget
carrier, jumped 6 percent to 81.90 pesos, the steepest gain
since Nov. 9, after  JG Summit Holdings Inc . (JGS PM) said it
bought 653,940 shares of the airline on Feb. 25 when the stock
slumped to a record low. JG Summit, which owns the company that
controls the airline, increased 2.1 percent to 19.60 pesos.    Jollibee Foods Corp . (JFC PM), the nation’s largest
fastfood company, sank 5.5 percent to 68.05 pesos, the lowest
level since June 18, on concern the stock’s valuation relative
to earnings is expensive given the rising cost of raw materials.
Jollibee trades at 23 times reported earnings, compared with a
multiple of 12 for the Philippine Stock Exchange Index.  “Investors are becoming more conservative in valuing the
stock because of the negative outlook toward the operating
environment facing Jollibee,” said Alvin Arogo, analyst at
Manila-based DBP-Daiwa SB Capital Markets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
