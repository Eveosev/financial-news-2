South Africa’s FTSE/JSE Africa All
Share Index advanced for a second day, gaining 306.50, or 1
percent, to 32,272.09 at the 5 p.m. close in Johannesburg,
taking its gain in the month to 2.8 percent.  The following were among the most active stocks in the
South African market today.    Anglo American Plc  (AGL SJ), the diversified mining company
that makes up 11 percent of South Africa’s benchmark stock
index, jumped the most since Feb. 11, rising 8.50 rand, or 2.3
percent, to 377 rand. Copper climbed for a third day in London
after an earthquake in Chile, the world’s largest producer of
the metal. The earthquake reminds “the market how dependent it
is on Chilean output,” said Nic Brown, an analyst at Natixis
Commodity Markets Ltd. in London.  BHP Billiton Plc  (BIL SJ),
rose for a third day, climbing 1.4 percent to 277 rand.    Mvelaphanda Resources Ltd . (MVL SJ), a mining investment
company, advanced the most in three weeks, gaining 89 cents, or
2.2 percent, to 40.94 rand. The external funding requirement
needed by  Northam Platinum Ltd . (NHM SJ) to build its Booysendal
mine may be smaller than it previously expected after a deal
with major shareholder Mvelaphanda, and as “the market is
changing,” Northam Financial Director Ayanda Khumalo said.
Northam rose 0.2 percent to 49.50 rand.    PBT Group Ltd . (PBT SJ), a provider of information
management services, jumped the most since Nov. 24, adding 8
cents, or 7.7 percent, to 1.12 rand. The company said it had
entered into negotiations that, if successfully concluded, may
affect the price of its stock  To contact the reporter on this story:
