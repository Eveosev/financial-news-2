  African Rainbow Minerals Ltd ., the
South African diversified mining company, said fiscal first-half
profit more than tripled as metal production and prices climbed.  Net income rose to 1.56 billion rand ($223 million) during
the six months to Dec. 31, from 452 million rand a year earlier,
the Johannesburg-based company said in a statement today.  Chief Executive Officer Andre Wilkens invested in mine
expansion even as a global recession hit, in line with the
company’s aim of doubling output of “key commodities,”
including nickel and  iron ore , by 2010. The London Metals Index,
comprising six primary metals including copper, alumina and
nickel, rose 24 percent last year.  African Rainbow’s ferrous unit, which includes iron ore,
chrome and manganese, accounted for 1.26 billion rand of total
headline earnings, according to the statement. On that basis,
the unit’s profit increased more than fourfold.  Chrome ore sales volumes from Assmang Ltd., in which
African Rainbow has a 50 percent stake, more than doubled, while
iron ore production rose 10 percent and manganese output climbed
43 percent, African Rainbow said. Iron ore prices more than
doubled during the period from a year earlier, it said.  African Rainbow continues to focus on its “aggressive”
growth plan, it said. Contracts worth $236 million have been
placed for the Konkola North copper project it’s developing with  Vale SA  in Zambia, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
