Austria’s government today ordered a
freeze of the assets in the Alpine republic of 26 Libyan
nationals, including  Muammar Qaddafi , in line with European 
Union sanctions.  “The list includes the Qaddafi family and members of the
security forces and army” Harald Waiglein, a spokesman for the
Austrian Finance Minister, said by phone from Vienna today.
“The Austrian central bank will now freeze the accounts via
decree.”  Austrian banks have more than 1 billion euros ($1.4
billion) in deposits from Libyan clients, Austrian central bank
Governor Ewald Nowotny said in an interview on Austrian state
television yesterday.  Nowotny added he couldn’t say yet how many of the deposits
were linked to Qaddafi and his family.  “I can’t say yet how big the volume is that falls into
this category,” Nowotny said, referring to the asset freeze.
“Overall, Austrian banks have deposits from Libya that total
more than 1 billion euros.”    Erste Group Bank AG , Austria’s second-largest lender, has
no accounts linked to Qaddafi or his family, spokeswoman Hana Cygonkova said in an e-mailed statement.  Raiffeisen Bank
International AG  said it was reviewing its accounts and couldn’t
yet say whether the bank was affected. UniCredit Bank Austria
AG,  Oesterreichische Volksbanken AG , Bawag PSK and Hypo Alpe-
Adria-Bank International AG didn’t immediately reply to e-mails.  To contact the reporter on this story:
