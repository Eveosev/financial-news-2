  Morgan Stanley , the sixth-biggest
U.S. bank by assets, faces a probe tied to mortgages for members
of the U.S. military.  Morgan Stanley has received subpoenas and requests for
information on matters that include “the company’s compliance
with the Service Members Civil Relief Act,” according to the
New York-based firm’s annual report today to securities
regulators. The subpoenas and requests include those relating to
the purchase, origination and servicing of residential
mortgages, according to the filing.  The Service Members Civil Relief Act provides financial
relief to military personnel on active duty and can delay
foreclosures.  JPMorgan Chase & Co ., the second-biggest U.S. bank
by assets, said earlier this month it will forgive mortgages of
military families whose homes were improperly seized and revamp
its housing program for service members and veterans.  Morgan Stanley is also facing subpoenas and information
requests regarding its due diligence on loans it purchased for
securitization, communications with ratings companies and its
handling of foreclosure-related issues, according to the filing.    Sandra Hernandez , a spokeswoman for the firm, declined to
comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
