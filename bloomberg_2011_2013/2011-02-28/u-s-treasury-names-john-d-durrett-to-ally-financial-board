The U.S. Treasury today named John D. Durrett, a strategic adviser to Serent Capital, to the board
of directors of Ally Financial Inc., the auto industry lender
that was bailed out as part of the Troubled Asset Relief
Program.  “This appointment is part of the administration’s ongoing
commitment to prudent stewardship of TARP investments,” said
Tim Massad, the Treasury’s acting assistant secretary for
financial stability, in a statement today.  Durrett was formerly managing director of McKinsey & Co.’s
West Coast U.S. offices and chairman of the finance committee on
McKinsey’s board of directors. The Treasury Department worked
with the executive search firm  Spencer Stuart  in identifying
candidates.  To contact the reporters on this story:  Rebecca Christie  in Washington at
