Protesters in  Bahrain  rallied
outside the Persian Gulf country’s parliament and marched to the
state broadcaster’s building, the  Associated Press  reported
today.  The demonstration at parliament was to coincide with a
meeting called by the 40-member upper chamber, which is
appointed by Bahrain’s king, the news service reported. The
session was delayed by several hours when protesters formed a
human chain around the entrance, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
