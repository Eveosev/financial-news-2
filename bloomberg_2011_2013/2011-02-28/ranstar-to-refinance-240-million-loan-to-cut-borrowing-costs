Transtar Industries Inc., the auto-
parts manufacturer acquired by Friedman Fleischer & Lowe LLC, is
seeking a $240 million  term loan  to reduce borrowing costs on
bank debt raised in December for the buyout, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Royal Bank of Canada will arrange the refinancing, which
will replace the existing loan with a new one that also matures
in December 2016, Bloomberg data show. The bank will host a
lender call tomorrow to discuss the transaction.  Transtar plans to offer lenders an interest rate 3.25
percentage points more than the London interbank offered rate,
according to Bloomberg data. Libor, the rate banks charge to
lend to each other, will have a 1.25 percent floor.  The Cleveland-based company is planning to issue the loan
at par, Bloomberg data show. Lenders will be offered a one-year
soft-call protection of 101 cents, meaning Transtar would have
to pay 1 cent more than face value to refinance the debt during
its first year.  The existing loan has a margin 4.5 percentage points more
than Libor and a 1.75 percent floor on the lending benchmark,
Bloomberg data show. Transtar issued the loan at a so-called
original-issue discount, which reduces proceeds for the borrower
and boosts the yield for investors, of 99 cents on the dollar.  Jeff Marshall, chief financial officer of Transtar, didnâ€™t
immediately return a telephone message left at his office
seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
