  Australia ’s dollar fell from an
eight-week high against the greenback after the central bank
said gains in consumer prices weren’t enough to warrant an
immediate increase in  interest rates .  The so-called Aussie declined versus 14 of its 16 major
counterparts after  Reserve Bank  of Australia Governor Glenn Stevens said inflation is expected to stay within its target
range of 2 percent to 3 percent over the next year. New
Zealand’s dollar fell for the first time in three days against
the Japanese yen.  “There is disappointment because the statement from the
RBA isn’t as bullish as has been expected, spurring some profit
taking on the Aussie,” said Kengo Suzuki, a foreign-exchange
analyst in Tokyo at Mizuho Securities Co., a unit of Japan’s
second-largest publicly traded lender.  The Australian dollar fell 0.2 percent to $1.0162 as of
11:55 a.m. in  New York , from $1.0186 yesterday. It reached
$1.0202, the highest level since Jan. 3. The Aussie traded at
83.20 yen, compared with 83.30 yen.    New Zealand ’s dollar fetched 75.06 U.S. cents, compared
with 75.24 cents. The kiwi dropped 0.2 percent to 61.43 yen,
compared with 61.53 yen.  The RBA kept its overnight cash rate target at 4.75
percent, as forecast by all 25 economists surveyed by Bloomberg
News. The board judged “the current mildly restrictive stance
of monetary policy remained appropriate in view of the general
macroeconomic outlook,” Stevens said in a statement.  Demand for the Australian currency was boosted after a
government report showed the nation’s retail sales increased
more than economists forecast.  Sales rose 0.4 percent in January from a month earlier, the
Bureau of Statistics said in Sydney, exceeding the 0.3 percent
gain projected by economists.  To contact the reporter on this story:
