European stocks pared losses as the
Libyans sought to end Muammar Qaddafi’s 41-year reign as the
country’s ruler. U.S. futures were little changed, while Asian
shares advanced.  HSBC Holdings Plc tumbled 3.1 percent after posting full-
year net income that missed analysts’ estimates. Associated
British Foods Plc declined 3.9 percent as the company said that
sales slowed at its fast-fashion unit.  The Stoxx 600 added 0.1 percent to 284.26 at 9:16 a.m. in  London .  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
