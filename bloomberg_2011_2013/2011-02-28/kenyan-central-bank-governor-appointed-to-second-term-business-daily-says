Kenyan President  Mwai Kibaki 
appointed Njuguna Ndung’u to a second term as governor of the
East African nation’s central bank, Business Daily reported,
citing a government notice.  Prime Minister  Raila Odinga ’s office said the appointment
was unlikely to be controversial, though it didn’t say whether
the two leaders had discussed the decision, the Nairobi-based
newspaper said.  Ndung’u’s term ends on March 4, 2015, it said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
