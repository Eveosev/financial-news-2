  Israel  called on the European Union
to use its leverage with the  Palestinian Authority  to push for
concessions to advance the peace process.  The 27-nation EU is the biggest aid donor to the
Palestinians, providing 440 million euros ($609 million) in
2009, according to the latest data.  “It’s also high time for Europe to use its influence vis a
vis the Palestinians,” Israeli Deputy Foreign Minister Daniel Ayalon told reporters in Brussels today.  Europe  “can ask the
Palestinians to be more accommodating.”  Ayalon said the Palestinian cause has played no role in the
revolutions sweeping the Arab world, which he traced to tribal
feuds in  Libya , a youth uprising in  Egypt  and sectarian strife
in Bahrain.  To contact the reporter on this story:
