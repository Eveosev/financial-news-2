Ukraine will probably increase
spring rapeseed planting this year, researcher UkrAgroConsult
said.  Farmers may plant 150,000 hectares (370,658 acres) of
rapeseed, up 40 percent from last year, the Kiev-based
agriculture research company said by email today.  Of the 1.08 million acres of winter rapeseed planted, about
53 percent are in good condition and 39 percent are
satisfactory, according to the national Hydrometeorology
Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
