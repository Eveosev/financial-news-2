A U.K. gauge of new jobs rose to a
record this month as demand for workers in the private sector
soared, recruitment company Reed said.  The Reed Job Index gained to 131, the highest since the
gauge began in December 2009, from 113 in January, the London-
based company said in a report today. An index of salaries
slipped as pay offers on new jobs declined, Reed said.  To contact the reporter on this story:  Scott Hamilton  in London at
