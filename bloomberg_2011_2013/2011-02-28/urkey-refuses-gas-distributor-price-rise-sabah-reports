Turkey refused to allow gas
distributors to increase their prices, Sabah newspaper reported,
citing Energy Minister  Taner Yildiz .  The distributors still have a margin of profit and any
change should come from renegotiated purchase prices, not the
rate charged to the public, Yildiz said after meetings in
Ankara, according to the newspaper.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
