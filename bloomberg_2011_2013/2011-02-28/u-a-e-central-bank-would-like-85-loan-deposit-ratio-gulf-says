The United Arab Emirates central
bank would be happy to see a loan-to-deposit ratio of 85 percent
for the country’s banking system,  Gulf News  reported, citing
governor Sultan Bin Nasser al-Suwaidi.  Banks in the federation had a loan-to-deposit ratio of 98.3
percent at the end of December, according to central bank data.  Al-Suwaidi also told a news conference that U.A.E. banks’
performance this year will be similar to 2010 and distribution
of dividends shouldn’t exceed 50 percent of their profit last
year, the Dubai-based newspaper reported.  The central bank plans to announce new regulations on
housing and real-estate loans within months, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
