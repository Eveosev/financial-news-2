  Olympic Entertainment Group AS , the
only publicly traded casino operator in eastern  Europe , said its
fourth-quarter loss narrowed due mainly to lower amortisation
costs and as a decline in property value wasnâ€™t repeated.  The net loss totaled 1.4 million krooni ($120,000),
compared with a loss of 74.5 million krooni a year earlier, the
Tallinn-based company said today in a stock exchange statement.
Revenue rose 14 percent to 485 million krooni.  Amortisation losses declined to 70.5 million krooni from
102.6 million and the fair value of investment property was
reduced by 558,000 krooni, compared with a decline of 19.4
million a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
