Sangita Reddy, executive director at  Apollo Hospitals Enterprise Ltd ., comments on Indian Finance
Minister Pranab Mukherjee’s budget proposals for the fiscal year
starting April 1.  Patients at hospitals with central air conditioning and
more than 25 beds will have to pay a service tax of 5 percent,
the minister said in his budget speech in parliament today. The
government has also proposed raising the excise tax on drugs and
medical equipment to 5 percent from 4 percent.  Reddy spoke to reporters in  New Delhi .  “Unfortunately, bringing health care under the service tax
is going to directly impact the consumer because any tax that
you put will get passed on to the customer. This is the
beginning of making the customer pay more.  “We missed the opportunity to do a universal health
insurance coverage and we missed the opportunity to grow the
number of hospital beds.  India  needs 1.7 million beds.  “There has been no incentive in any way, whether it be
infrastructure status or priority status or attracting foreign
direct investment into the health-care sector.”  -- Editor: Vipin V. Nair.  To contact the reporter on this story:
