  Citigroup Inc ., the third-biggest  U.S. bank  by assets, said it paid four top executives salaries
and bonuses totaling $32.4 million last year.  Manuel Medina-Mora, head of  consumer banking  for the
Americas, received compensation of $10.1 million, the New York-
based lender said today in a regulatory filing. Chief Operating
Officer  John Havens  was paid $9.51 million, Chief Financial
Officer  John Gerspach  got $4.73 million and Michael Corbat, head
of Citi Holdings, received $8.02 million, including a $3.4
million cash bonus.  Chief Executive Officer  Vikram Pandit  told Congress in
February 2009 that he would take an annual salary of $1 until
the bank became profitable. Citigroup logged a $10.6 billion
profit last year. In January, the board awarded Pandit a $1.75
million cash salary for 2011. He declined to take a bonus last
year.  “Exceptional employees, and exceptional efforts by those
employees, have been required to move Citi towards sustained and
responsible profitability when there continues to be worldwide
competition for proven talent in the financial services
industry,” the bank said in the filing.  The compensation figures, calculated under Securities and
Exchange Commission rules, don’t include $11.1 million in
restricted stock executives received in January as compensation
for last year. Including $4.75 million in restricted stock,
Havens’ 2010 compensation would have amounted to $14.25 million,
compared with $9.5 million a year earlier.  Havens oversees the Institutional Client Group unit, which
reported $10.1 billion net income in 2010, a 21 percent decline
from 2009.  Medina-Mora, Havens and Gerspach received part of their
2010 compensation in so-called salary stock, which Citigroup
said it will stop using this year because it’s “no longer a
TARP company.” In December, the U.S. Treasury Department sold
the last of the Citigroup stock it received in exchange for
giving the bank a $45 billion bailout through the Troubled Asset
Relief Program.  To contact the reporter on this story:
