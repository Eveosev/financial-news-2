Fighting in  Senegal â€™s restive
Casamance region left 12 militants and three soldiers dead over
the weekend, Sud Quotidien reported, citing unidentified
officials in the military.  Rebels in the skirmishes, which took places around a town
25 kilometers (15.5 miles) from the Gambian border, were armed
with heavy and long-range weapons, the officials told the Dakar-
based newspaper.  The fighting brings the number of Senegalese soldiers
killed in the past week to seven, Sud Quotidien said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
