Egypt’s public prosecutor ordered
the sequestration of the assets of former President  Hosni Mubarak  and his family and banned them from traveling.  The prosecutor ordered that all of the family’s money
transfers, real estate, stocks and bonds in companies and banks
be sequestered, his office in Cairo said in a faxed statement
today. Banks and entities concerned have been notified.  The prosecutor has received several complaints about how
Mubarak increased his wealth by illegitimate means in Egypt,
according to the statement. On Feb. 21, the prosecutor asked the
foreign minister to request that the foreign assets of the
former president and his family be frozen.  Mubarak submitted a financial disclosure statement to
judicial authorities, the state-run Middle East News Agency
reported on Feb. 20. He routinely files such statements, the
news agency said, citing an unidentified representative of the
former president who denied media reports about the size of
Mubarak’s wealth and about accounts and properties he held
abroad.  Mubarak stepped down on Feb. 11 after 30 years as president
following a popular revolt.  Egypt ’s army has dissolved the
parliament and suspended the constitution pending elections.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
