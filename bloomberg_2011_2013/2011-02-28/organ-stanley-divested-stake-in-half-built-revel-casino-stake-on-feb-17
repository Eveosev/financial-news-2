  Morgan Stanley , the sixth-largest
U.S. bank by assets, said it sold its stake in Revel
Entertainment Group LLC, the developer of a half-built casino
resort in Atlantic City,  New Jersey .  Morgan Stanley sold its stake to an investor group led by
Kevin DeSanctis, chairman and chief executive officer of Revel
Entertainment, according to a filing today with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission. The New York-based bank
didn’t take a pretax loss or gain on the sale, according to the
filing.  Morgan Stanley wrote down the value of its stake by about
$1.2 billion last year, recognizing a loss of about 98 percent,
after deciding to sell the holding. The SEC asked Morgan Stanley
to explain why it waited until last year to report the losses,
according to letters released in November.  The sale came on the day Revel said it raised $1.15 billion
to restart construction. The beachfront resort, located at the
northern end of the  Atlantic City  boardwalk and budgeted at
about $2.4 billion, is expected to open in mid-2012, Revel said
on that day.  Morgan Stanley told the SEC in letters last year that
before its decision to sell the stake, it had consolidated Revel
and compared the book value of the investment with undiscounted
cash flows to check whether a charge was warranted. The bank
said it recognized there were “impairment indicators” before
the first quarter of 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
