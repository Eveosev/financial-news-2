Bond market investors are showing
the greatest confidence in global economic growth since credit
markets crashed three years ago.  Yields on debt securities are rising for a fourth month as
prices fall, the longest stretch since June 2008, according to
Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s Global Broad Market Index, which
tracks the performance of more than 19,000 securities valued at
about $39 trillion. While the highest-rated debt, from  U.S.
Treasuries  to  Microsoft Corp . debentures, are falling, the
riskiest company notes are returning the most in eight years.  “We’ve just experienced the first several months of a bear
market in bonds,” said Michael Hyman, head of investment-grade
credit in Atlanta at ING Investment Management, which oversees
about $518 billion.  While bonds rallied last week as turmoil in the Middle East
and North Africa spread, debt prices have fallen 3.54 percent
since August as the MSCI World Index of stocks surged 24
percent. Consumer confidence in the U.S. climbed during the week
ended Feb. 20 to the highest level since April 2008.  Manufacturing is expanding worldwide. The Institute for
Supply Management’s factory index for the U.S. rose to 60.8 in
January, the highest level since May 2004. China said last month
that industrial production rose 13.5 percent in 2010, while
growth in  Europe ’s service and manufacturing industries
accelerated to the fastest pace in more than four years this
month, led by stronger output in  Germany .  Rising Rates  Market interest rates are the highest in more than a year,
rising to 3 percent from last year’s low of 2.14 percent on Aug.
31, the Broad Market Index shows. Sovereign debt, considered the
least at risk of default, has performed the worst, losing 2.99
percent after reinvested interest since August. U.S. Treasuries
are down 2.88 percent.  Bonds issued in September by Redmond, Washington-based
Microsoft at some of the lowest borrowing costs on record have
tumbled, according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of
the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. The yield on the
largest software maker’s $1 billion of 3 percent debt due
October 2020 rose to 3.88 percent last week from about 3 percent
when they were issued.  The bond market exception has been high-yield debt.  Junk
bonds , rated below Baa3 by Moody’s Investors Service and less
than BBB- by  Standard & Poor’s , have returned 3.48 percent this
year, the best start since gaining 3.89 percent at the same
point in 2003, Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes show. U.S.
junk yield fell to a record low 7.29 percent on Feb. 22.  ‘Favorable Outlook’  Investors see less risk of defaults because the global
economy is forecast to expand 4.22 percent this year and 4.54
percent in 2012, according to International Monetary Fund data,
after shrinking 0.58 percent in 2009.  “It’s a favorable outlook for the global economy,” said  John Lonski , the chief economist at Moody’s Capital Markets
Group in  New York . Anything better than about 3 percent is
healthy, he said.  Bond returns globally have fallen to a 0.14 percent loss
this year, including a 0.22 percent decline for Treasuries and a
drop of 0.49 percent for sovereign debt, according to Bank of
America Merrill Lynch index data.  Losses were tempered this month as spreading political
tension in the Middle East led investors to seek the safety of
government debt. Before last week, bonds were headed for a sixth
straight monthly loss, the longest stretch since the Global
Broad Market Index was created in 1997. Now, they’re up 0.13
percent for February.  Economic Growth  Protests in Egypt, Bahrain, Libya and Tunisia drove oil
above $100 a barrel in New York for the first time since October
2008, raising concern that rising commodity prices would curb  consumer spending  and add to inflation at a time when
unemployment in the U.S. is 9 percent.  JPMorgan Chase & Co. cut its first-quarter U.S. economic
growth estimate to an annual rate of 3.5 percent from 4 percent,
according to chief U.S. economist  Michael Feroli .  “Consumers stumbled a bit to start the year,” Feroli
wrote in a note e-mailed to clients on Feb. 25. “The recent
rise in energy prices poses a notable headwind.”  The U.S. government said on Feb. 25 that gross domestic
product grew at a 2.8 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter,
less than the 3.2 percent it originally estimated, as state and
local governments made deeper cuts in spending.  The  Federal Reserve  “is on hold, unemployment is high and
inflation is low,” said Matthew Marra, a money manager at New
York-based BlackRock Inc., the world’s largest asset manager,
with about $3.45 trillion. “The things you would expect to
cause dramatically higher  interest rates  are not in place
today.”  Inflation Expectations  Global bond yields are still below the average of about
4.15 percent since the index started in 1997. The index was at
5.05 percent at the end of 2000, and 5.56 percent in December
1996, when the firm, then Merrill Lynch & Co., began tracking
the data.  An expanding spread between Treasury yields and those on
government debt tied to the consumer price index shows traders
anticipate economic growth won’t spark runaway inflation even as
global energy and food prices soar. An index of 55 food
commodities climbed 3.5 percent in January from a month earlier
to a record high 231 points, the  United Nations ’ Food and
Agriculture Organization said in a Feb. 3 report.  Break-Even Rate  The 10-year break-even rate is 2.42 percentage points, in
line with the average for the five years before credit markets
seized up in mid-2008. Treasury 10-year note yields fell from a
high of about 5.3 percent to a low of about 3.3 percent over
that period. The yield on the benchmark 10-year security fell 17
basis points last week to 3.41 percent, according to BGCantor
Market Data. The 3.625 percent note due February 2021 rose to
101 3/4. The yield was 3.41 percent at 10:09 a.m. in New York.  The outlook is bright enough that the Federal Reserve may
be able to reduce stimulating the economy, said St. Louis Fed
Bank President  James Bullard . The central bank voted in November
to buy $600 billion in Treasuries through June to boost
employment and spur inflation.  “The natural debate now is whether to complete the
program, or to taper off to a somewhat lower level of asset
purchases,” Bullard said Feb. 24 in a speech in Bowling Green,  Kentucky . “The economic outlook has improved since the program
was announced.”  Stock Flows  Investors pumped $47 billion into equity funds in the U.S.,
Europe and Japan this year after pulling $17 billion in 2010 and
$28 billion in 2009,  EPFR Global  said Feb. 18 in a statement.
The MSCI All Country World Index of stocks has climbed 3.79
percent with dividends reinvested this year as the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index rose 5.29 percent and the  Nikkei-225  Stock
Average gained 2.98 percent.  Investors added $2.44 billion to bond funds globally this
year as of Feb. 16, down from $11.1 billion during the same
period in 2010.  In coming years, the record amount borrowed by the  U.S.
Treasury  may cause yields to rise, said  Dan Fuss , who helps
oversee $152 billion of assets as vice chairman of Boston-based
Loomis Sayles & Co. U.S. debt rose to $14.03 trillion as of Dec.
31 from $5.77 trillion a decade ago, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  “We’re in for 20 years of rising interest rates,” Fuss
said in an interview. Yields will climb amid “larger and larger
claims on savings by the U.S. Treasury,” he said.  Budget Deficits  Loomis has cut its funds’ average maturities to about nine
years from 19 during in anticipation of rising rates, he said.  The U.S. will have cumulative deficits of more than $4
trillion through the end of 2015, the Obama administration
forecast this month. Interest expense will rise to 3.1 percent
of gross domestic product by 2016 from 1.3 percent last year,
according to administration estimates.  Junk bonds’ extra yield relative to Treasuries offers a
cushion, said  Charles Lieberman , the former head of monetary
analysis at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York who now serves
as the chief investment officer at Advisors Capital Management
LLC in Hasbrouck Heights,  New Jersey .  Advisors Capital hasn’t owned Treasuries for about a year
and prefers high-yield bonds, convertible securities and
floating-rate debt, said Lieberman. “Our fixed-income strategy
is based on the proposition that rates are rising.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
