  London  land prices are soaring as
competition by international investors for sites reaches levels
last seen before the recession the Financial Times reported.  Rob Perrins, the chief executive officer of  Berkeley Group
Holdings Plc , the U.K. capital’s biggest housebuilder, said
investors are moving “from protection to investment mode” and
sites with planning consent for residential development are
rising in price, the newspaper reported.  More than 1 billion pounds ($1.6 billion) has been raised
in the past two months and may result in construction of about
10,000 homes, with the emphasis on up-market developments, the
