  Staples Inc . call volume rose to the
highest level since August 2008 before the company reports
earnings March 2, after a single trade today with a strike price
3.3 percent above the closing level.  A block of 9,000 March $22 calls to buy the largest U.S.
office-supply retailer traded at 10:26 a.m. in New York for 30
cents each, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Almost 21,300 calls changed hands today, more than 20 times
the four-week average and nine times the number of puts to sell.
The most-active contracts, the March $22 calls, accounted for
more than two-thirds of all call volume and more than doubled to
45 cents. Framingham, Massachusetts-based Staples advanced 1.7
percent to $21.30.  Staples will report fourth-quarter profit of 40 cents a
share excluding some items, according to the average of 17
estimates in a Bloomberg survey. The company reported better-
than-forecast earnings in November. Staples has declined 17
percent in the past year, compared with a 26 percent drop for  Office Depot Inc ., the second-largest U.S. office-supply chain,
and a 29 percent rise for a gauge of consumer-discretionary
companies in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  Staples’ implied volatility, the key gauge of option
prices, for at-the-money options expiring in 30 days rose to
32.01 from 28.87 on Feb. 25.  Calls give the right to buy 100 shares of a security for a
certain amount, the strike price, by a set date. Puts convey the
right to sell. Investors use options to guard against
fluctuations in the price of securities they own, speculate on
share-price moves or bet that volatility, or stock swings, will
rise or fall.  To contact the reporter on this story:
