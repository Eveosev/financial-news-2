Overseas Shipholding Group, the
largest U.S.-based oil tanker owner, reported a wider fourth-
quarter loss as shipping rates declined.  The loss increased to $55.3 million, or $1.83 a share, from
$23.2 million, or 86 cents, a year earlier, the New York-based
company said in a statement today. The average estimate of five
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was a loss of $2.17 a share.
Sales fell 4.4 percent to $232 million from $242.6 million.  Overseas Shipholding kept more than 70 percent of its fleet
under spot, or single-voyage, contracts, exposing itself to
declines in spot rates. The average rate for supertankers
dropped 55 percent during the quarter, according to the London-
based Baltic Exchange.  “As the  spot market  goes down, so does OSG,” said Greg Lewis, a New York-based analyst at Credit Suisse, who has a
“neutral” rating on the stock. “While in the near term we’ve
seen a little bit of uptick in rates on the back of the turmoil
in the Middle East, overall, it will be a challenging year for
tanker rates.”  Excluding items including interest-rate swaps and a gain on
vessel sales, the company reported an adjusted loss of $59
million, or $1.96 per share. On that basis, the 16 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg expected a loss of $2.  Overseas Shipholding rose $1.26, or 3.7 percent, to $35.28
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading on Feb. 25. The
stock has dropped 0.4 percent this year.  Spot Rates  Spot shipping rates of very-large crude carriers, or VLCCs,
averaged $6,637 a day during the fourth quarter, down from
$14,760 a day a year earlier, according to the  Baltic Exchange .  The tanker owner was paid an average rate of $17,044 a day
in the quarter for its VLCCs, a decline of 29 percent from
$23,876 a year earlier, according to the statement. The ships,
which can carry about 2 million barrels of oil, operate mainly
between the  Persian Gulf  and ports in Asia and the U.S.  Revenue from the company’s U.S.-flag fleet increased $7.1
million, or 12 percent, the company said. The fleet moves
between U.S. ports under the Jones Act, a 1920 law that requires
commercial vessels operating between U.S. ports to be built in
the U.S., crewed by Americans and owned by an American company.  At the end of December, Overseas Shipholding owned and
operated 111 vessels, up from 106 vessels a year earlier.  (Overseas Shipholding will hold a conference call for
