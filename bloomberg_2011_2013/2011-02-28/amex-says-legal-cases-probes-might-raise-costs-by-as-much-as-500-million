  American Express Co ., the biggest
credit-card issuer by purchases, said it’s “reasonably
possible” that pending legal cases and government examinations
may lead to as much as $500 million in costs for which it hasn’t
already set aside funds.  The range of possible additional losses may also be as low
as zero, the New York-based company said today in a regulatory
filing. Financial firms are making the estimates after the
Securities and Exchange Commission, in an October letter to
corporate finance chiefs, said companies should disclose such
potential losses when it’s possible they may occur.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
