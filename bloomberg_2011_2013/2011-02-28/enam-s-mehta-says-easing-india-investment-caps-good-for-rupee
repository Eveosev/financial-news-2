Dharmesh A. Mehta, managing director
for institutional equities at Enam Securities Pvt., comments on
India’s budget.  The government will cut the  budget deficit  to 4.6 percent
of gross domestic product in the fiscal year ending in March
2012, Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee said in his annual
budget speech in parliament today.  “A positive budget with no populist measures, which was
widely feared. Allowing foreign money in mutual funds and
doubling the limit of debt exposure is also very positive for
rupee. Infrastructure investments are positive but one will wait
for execution on the same. Fiscal deficit of 4.6 percent is very
positive but one is awaiting details to ascertain if it’s
achievable.  “Overall, a good budget considering the global environment
and once there is stability we will see markets moving up and
foreign institutional investor flows returning to  India  in a big
way.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
