Fina Antwerp Olefins NV, a
petrochemical venture of  Total SA  and  Exxon Mobil Corp ., will
halt a naphtha cracker next month for planned maintenance, two
people with knowledge of the matter said.  Naphtha cracker 3 will be idled at the site in Belgium from
the end of March, they said, declining to be named because the
information is confidential. The shutdown will last for as long
as six weeks, one of the people said. The cracker can produce
610,000 metric tons of ethylene a year, according to the
Association of Petrochemicals Producers in  Europe . Ethylene is
used in plastics products from car parts to carrier bags.  Naphtha cracker 2 at the same site in Antwerp was shut for
a few hours on Feb. 25 because of pressure problems, one of the
people said. The unit can produce 550,000 tons of ethylene
annually, according to the associationâ€™s  website .  The Antwerp site has three naphtha crackers. Cracker 1 is
the smallest with a capacity of 255,000 tons a year. Total and
Exxon declined to comment on the crackers, referring questions
to the joint venture.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
