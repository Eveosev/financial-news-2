  Angola  will reduce daily crude
exports by 12 percent in April from a month earlier, according
to a final loading program obtained by Bloomberg News.  Africa’s second-largest producer plans to ship 45.2 million
barrels, or 1.51 million a day in April, down from a revised
52.8 million, or 1.7 million in March, the program showed.  The volume for April is 50,000 barrels more than the
preliminary plan, as the size of one Nemba cargo was increased
to 1 million barrels from 950,000. Another cargo of the same
grade was deferred to April from March, according to the plan.  Angola will export seven shipments of Cabinda, one less
than the preliminary plan. It will load five cargoes of Kissanje
crude, one more than originally planned.  Exports of Dalia crude will be four cargoes in April, down
from eight in March, due to planned maintenance.  Total SA,  Europe ’s third-largest oil company, said last
week that its Dalia field will be shut for maintenance in April.  To contact the reporter on this story:
