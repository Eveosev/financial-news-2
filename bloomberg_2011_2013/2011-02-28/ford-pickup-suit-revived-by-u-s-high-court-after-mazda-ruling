The U.S.  Supreme Court  injected new
life into a suit against Ford Motor Co. brought by the mother of
a South Carolina teenager killed in a 2002 pickup truck
accident.  The justices today told the South Carolina Supreme Court to
reconsider its rejection of the suit, pointing to their Feb. 23
 ruling  allowing a claim against a  Mazda Motor Corp . unit over
seatbelt design.  Today’s order hints at the potential impact of the Mazda
ruling, which said automakers can be sued for not equipping back
seats with shoulder straps, even if the manufacturers were in
compliance with federal regulations.  In the South Carolina suit, Mary Robyn Priester blames Ford
for the death of her son, James Lloyd Priester, who was crushed
after being ejected from the back seat of a 1997 Ford F-150
pickup. Priester faults Ford for its use of tempered glass,
contending that some form of advanced glazing would have
prevented her son from being ejected.  The South Carolina Supreme Court said the suit was
preempted by a federal safety regulation that permitted tempered
glass as one of several options for side windows.  “The Priester case is vastly different from the Mazda case
because it involves a different federal motor vehicle safety
standard with a different regulatory record,” Kristen Kinley, a
spokesman for Ford, said in an e-mail. “We think it is exactly
the kind of case that the Supreme Court envisioned being
preempted.”  The case is Priester v.  Ford Motor Co ., 10-668.  To contact the reporter on this story:
