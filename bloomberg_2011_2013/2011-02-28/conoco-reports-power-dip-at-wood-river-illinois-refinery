  ConocoPhillips  reported that a
“power dip” led to flaring at its Wood River refinery in
Illinois, according to a filing with state regulators.  The flaring of sulfur dioxide yesterday was caused by the
power drop in a distilling wet gas compressor, the  filing  with
the Illinois Emergency Management Agency showed.  Rich Johnson, a Houston-based spokesman for ConocoPhillips,
said by e-mail that the company declined to comment on day-to-
day refinery operations.  Outages can increase prices for refined products as
companies turn to spot markets to help them meet supply
contracts. Operational disruptions can also depress prices for
crude oil as less feedstock is used.  In a separate  filing  with the state, the Houston-based
company reported a failure of a flange gasket on a 4-inch
pipeline on Feb. 26 that caused the release of over 1,000 pounds
of sulfuric acid.  The Wood River refinery is part of a joint venture with
Alberta oil-sands producer  Cenovus Energy Inc . designed to
increase the amount of heavy Canadian crude processed in
ConocoPhillips’s Wood River and Borger, Texas, refineries.  Wood River is on the  Mississippi River  near Roxana,
Illinois, about 15 miles (24 kilometers) northeast of  St. Louis ,
according to the company’s  2008 Fact Book.  The plant processes
light, low-sulfur, and heavy, high-sulfur, crude oil.  To contact the reporter on this story:
