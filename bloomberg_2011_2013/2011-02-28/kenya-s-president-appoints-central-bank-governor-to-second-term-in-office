Kenyan President  Mwai Kibaki 
appointed Central Bank of Kenya Governor Njuguna Ndung’u to a
second term in office to provide policy continuity, Finance
Minister  Uhuru Kenyatta  said.  Ndung’u’s new term will begin on March 4, according to a
Feb. 25 government notice distributed in Nairobi, the capital,
today.  “The government was satisfied with his performance and
decided to renew his term for continuity,” Kenyatta said in an
interview today. “We credit him for the major transformation of
the country’s financial system, the development of new products
and the reduction of the cost of credit.”  Under Ndung’u’s leadership, the central bank has cut its
benchmark interest rate eight times to a record low of 5.75
percent. Since he was appointed to the position in March 2007,
average annual inflation slowed from 4.3 percent to an estimated
4.1 percent last year, according to International Monetary Fund
data. The Kenyan shilling has depreciated by 16 percent over
that period, according to Bloomberg data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
