  Russia  may spend as much as 200
billion rubles ($7 billion) to develop an e-card system to
facilitate payments for government services ranging from public
transport to pensions.  The five-year project, which seeks to cut red tape and make
services more affordable, will require investment from the
government and Russian commercial banks, Arkady Dvorkovich,
chief economic aide to President  Dmitry Medvedev , told reporters
today. Medvedev will hold a meeting in Moscow later today on
creating the card.  Medvedev, an avid Internet user who’s made developing an
“innovative economy” the core of his presidency, has been
pushing for government agencies to switch to providing services
online. Dvorkovich said the card will replace the multitude of
cards issued by various government agencies.    German Gref , chief executive officer of state-run OAO
Sberbank, Russia’s biggest lender, which is helping to finance
the development, said banks have so far been reluctant to
provide funds for the project because it’s “of little
interest” commercially.  To contact the reporter on this story:
