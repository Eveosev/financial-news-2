Cyprus objects to proposals put
forward by Germany and  France  to harmonize corporate tax rates
across European Union countries, the eastern Mediterranean
island’s Finance Minister said.  “An increase of corporate  tax rate  at 17 percent or more
importantly an equalization of corporate tax rates in Europe
will be a very ugly development for the Cypriot economy,”
Charilaos Stavrakis told reporters in Nicosia today according to
an audio file e-mailed by the  Ministry of Finance . “Our
position is that other countries should lower their corporate
tax rates to our levels”.  The 10 percent corporate tax rate, the lowest in the EU,
“is a very big comparative advantage” in attracting foreign
companies and investment to Cyprus, the euro area’s third-
smallest economy, Stavrakis said.  Cyprus new company filings rose 20 percent last year, when
the economy grew 0.9 percent, according to the  Department of the
Registrar of Companies and Official Receiver . Filings were
boosted by companies from Russia, the island’s main financial
partner.  EU leaders will meet on March 11 to discuss a
competitiveness agreement proposed by German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  and French President  Nicolas Sarkozy , which includes
harmonization of Europe’s corporate tax base. Under an EU plan,
companies would pay tax in the countries where they make sales
rather than where they are based.  To contact the reporter on this story:
