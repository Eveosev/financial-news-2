  Bangchak Petroleum Pcl ,  Thailand â€™s
state-owned refiner, expects revenue this year to climb to as
high as 160 billion baht, boosted by increased production and
oil prices, President Anusorn Sangnimnuan said.  The company will spend at least 7.6 billion baht this year
to upgrade its products to meet Euro 4 emission standards and to
expand solar cell, biodiesel and ethanol projects, he told
reporters today in Bangkok.  To contact the reporter on this story:
