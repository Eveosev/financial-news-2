  Orco Property Group  SA, an east
European developer, is “very close to reaching a solution”
with the Croatian government over a joint resort on the Adriatic
island of Hvar, the company said.  Deputy Premier Petar Cobankovic and Orco Deputy Chief
Executive Officer Nicolas Tommasini are meeting today in Zagreb
to discuss the future of the  Suncani Hvar  resort. The Croatian
Privatization Fund, which is overseeing the talks, canceled a
press conference scheduled at noon today.  “I believe the talks are going well and progress will be
achieved on the future of Suncani Hvar,” Orco spokeswoman Petra Zdenkova said in a phone interview from  Prague . She added the
parties are “still ironing out the legal details.”  Orco on Jan. 3 failed to reach an accord with  Croatia  on
the development of the resort, which the developer wants to
transform into a five-star Adriatic holiday destination. The
company owns 55 percent, while the state  Privatization Fund 
holds 31 percent. The five-year-old development is the first
public-private project in the former Yugoslav republic.  On Jan. 7 the developer filed a “notice of dispute” to
the Croatian government, threatening legal action if no solution
to its battle over an island resort is found in three months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
