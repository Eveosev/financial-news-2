  Ohio State University  reclaimed the
top position in the Associated Press college basketball poll,
while St. John’s University climbed to No. 15, a week after
entering the ranking for the first time in more than a decade.  The Buckeyes (27-2) received 45 of 65 first-place votes in
the media poll to move atop the ranking as Duke University, the
former No. 1, fell into a tie for fourth with Pittsburgh
following a loss two days ago at Virginia Tech. Duke (26-3)
received one first-place vote.  Kansas, which held the No. 1 ranking two weeks ago, climbed
one spot to second, receiving 14 first-place votes, and Brigham
Young (five first-place votes) jumped four positions to No. 3.
The Cougars won 80-67 at San Diego State two days ago, dropping
the Aztecs three spots to ninth.  Ohio State played two games in the past week, winning 89-70
over  Illinois  on Feb. 22 and topping Indiana 82-61 yesterday.
The Buckeyes led the poll for four weeks before dropping to
second for the past two weeks after a loss to  Wisconsin .  Purdue is sixth and Texas is seventh, while Notre Dame, San
Diego State and Wisconsin complete the top 10. Louisville is
11th, followed by Syracuse,  North Carolina  and Florida.  St. John’s climbed eight spots after entering the  top 25 
last week for the first time since November 2000. The jump came
after a 76-51 home win over DePaul on Feb. 23 and an 81-68 road
victory two days ago against Villanova.  Connecticut is 16th, Georgetown 17th, Arizona 18th,
Villanova 19th and Kentucky 20th. Vanderbilt, Missouri, Xavier  Texas  A&M and Utah State complete the top 25.  To contact the reporter on this story:
