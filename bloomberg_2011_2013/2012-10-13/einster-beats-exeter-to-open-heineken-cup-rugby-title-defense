Leinster opened defense of its
Heineken Cup rugby title by holding on for a 9-6 win over the
Exeter Chiefs.  Jonathan Sexton  kicked three penalties for Leinster, which
has won Europe’s elite club competition three times in the past
four seasons, at the Royal Dublin Showground. Ignacio Mieres
missed an injury-time penalty which would have tied the score
for Exeter.  In today’s other results, Saracens routed Edinburgh 45-0,
Racing Metro beat Munter 22-17, Clermont Auvergne defeated
Scarlets 49-16, Connacht beat Zebre 19-10, and Harlequins 
beat Biarritz 40-13.   Ulster, last season’s runner-up, beat Castres 41-17 and
Ospreys defeated Benetton Treviso 38-17 last night. Northampton
hosts Glasgow, the  Cardiff Blues  visit the Sale Sharks, the
Leicester Tigers are at Toulouse and Toulon faces Montpellier in
tomorrow’s games.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
