Mark Webber beat Red Bull teammate
Sebastian Vettel for pole position at today’s Korean Grand Prix.  Webber posted a time of 1 minute, 37.242 seconds on his
final qualifying run to edge two-time defending world champion
Vettel, who completed his last lap around the Korea
International Circuit at Yeongam in 1:37.316.  “It was a reasonable lap and we did it when it counted,”
Webber told reporters yesterday. “Tomorrow’s the main day and
we’re in good position to get a good result.”  McLaren’s Lewis Hamilton and series leader Fernando Alonso
of Ferrari will start on the second row in front of Lotus’s Kimi
Raikkonen and Ferrari’s Felipe Massa.  Alonso leads Vettel in the standings by four points with
five races left. Vettel has won the past two races to close the
gap on the Spaniard.  “Our aim tomorrow? It’s very simple, to finish ahead of
Vettel,” Alonso told reporters. “From now on, how many points
one has overall will not count for much, it will be scoring one
more than my closest rival that matters.”  Romain Grosjean of Lotus,  Force India ’s Nico Hulkenberg and
Mercedes teammates Nico Rosbereg and Michael Schumacher rounded
out the top-10 qualifiers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
