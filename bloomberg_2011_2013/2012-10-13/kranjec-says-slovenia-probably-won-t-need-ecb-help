Slovenia probably won’t need direct
aid from the  European Central Bank , ECB Governing Council Member
Marko Kranjec said in an interview with Delo newspaper.  “The ECB has set up new instruments, the direct monetary
transaction, which I hope Slovenia won’t need,” Kranjec, who is
also the Slovenian central bank governor, was quoted as saying
by the Ljubljana-based  newspaper .  The former Yugoslav republic, the first post-communist
country to join the euro region, needs to continue to
consolidate public finances and reform the labor market and the
retirement system to regain its reputation of being a “credible
country,” Kranjec said, according to Delo. Markets would
respond “accordingly” with falling yields.  “If measures are carried through, Slovenia will be able to
borrow normally and it won’t need to ask for international
aid,” he said.  The government of Prime Minister  Janez Jansa  needs to focus
on strengthening the economy if it wants to solve the banks’
worsening loan portfolios, Kranjec said in the interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
