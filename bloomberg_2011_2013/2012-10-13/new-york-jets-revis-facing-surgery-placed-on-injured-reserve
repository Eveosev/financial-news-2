New York  Jets cornerback Darrelle Revis was placed on injured reserve yesterday, officially ending
his season, coach Rex Ryan said.  To fill Revis’s roster spot, the Jets signed safety Antonio
Allen, their seventh-round draft pick out of the University of
South Carolina, who was on the practice squad. Allen may be in
uniform when the Jets host the Indianapolis Colts tomorrow.  Revis, 27, will have surgery Oct. 18 on a torn anterior
cruciate ligament in his left knee. The injury came without
contact as Revis tried to change direction and make a tackle
with 3:54 left in the third quarter of the Jets’ 23-20 victory
at the Miami Dolphins on Sept. 23.  “I know I had said before I’d like to wait for Darrelle to
have surgery,” Ryan told reporters yesterday. “In the best
interests of the organization and Darrelle, we’ll place him on
IR. He won’t be designated for return and that will be it.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
