Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich has
given approval for a 46 million-pound ($74 million) bid to be
made for Atletico Madrid striker Radamel Falcao in January, the
Daily Mirror reported.  Abramovich made Falcao his top target after the Colombian
scored a hat trick in Atletico’s 4-1 win over Chelsea in the
UEFA Super Cup in August. Manchester City manager Roberto
Mancini is also interested and went to Spain to watch Falcao
play last weekend, the Mirror said.  Falcao has a 46 million-pound buyout clause in his
contract, the Mirror said. The 26-year-old, who leads Spain’s
Primera Liga with nine goals this season, joined Atletico from
Porto for 35 million pounds in 2011.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
