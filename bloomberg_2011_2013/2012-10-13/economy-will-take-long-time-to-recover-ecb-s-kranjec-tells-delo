The global economy will take a long
time to recover, Marko Kranjec, governing council member of the
 European Central Bank , said in an  interview  with Slovenian
newspaper Delo.  “The recovery will last a long time and as a warning we
can take the long-lasting recession in  Japan ,” the Ljubljana-
based newspaper quoted Kranjec as saying.  “With the standard of living and wages we have we cannot
compete with less developed countries,” said Kranjec, who is
also the Governor of Slovenia’s central bank. “I am, maybe
because I belong to the older generation, a pessimist on the
recovery.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
