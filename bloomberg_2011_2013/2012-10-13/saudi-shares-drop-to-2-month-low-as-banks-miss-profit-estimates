Saudi Arabia’s benchmark stock index
slid the most in more than four months as local lenders missed
third-quarter earnings estimates.  The  Tadawul All Share Index (SASEIDX)  lost 1.7 percent to 6,682.47 by
the 3:30 p.m. close in  Riyadh , the sharpest retreat since June
2. Saudi British Bank sank 2.7 percent to a Dec. 21 low of 29.1
riyals.  Banque Saudi Fransi (BSFR) , partly owned by Paris-based  Credit
Agricole SA (ACA) , retreated 3.3 percent to 29.7 riyals, the biggest
drop since Sept. 18 last year.  Saudi British Bank reported a 4 percent gain in third-
quarter profit to 656 million riyals ($175 million) on Oct. 10,
missing a 826 million riyal forecast. Banque Saudi Fransi posted
a 662 million riyal profit the same day, short of the mean
estimate of six analysts for 785 million riyals. The Tadawul All
Share Bank Index has gained 1 percent this year compared with a
4.1 percent rise in the All Share Index.  “We expected bank earnings to weigh on the session
today,” Asim Bukhtiar, head of research at Riyad Capital, said
in an e-mail. “A sudden spike in provisions led to earnings
misses for  Saudi British Bank (SABB)  and Banque Saudi Fransi. There
could be more negative surprises later in the week.”  Samba Financial Group (SAMBA) , the second-largest lender by market
value, retreated the most since July 23, dropping 2.3 percent to
43.4 riyals. Samba hasn’t reported quarterly results yet.  Saudi Arabia’s stock exchange is the only Persian Gulf
bourse operating on Saturdays.  To contact the reporter on this story:
