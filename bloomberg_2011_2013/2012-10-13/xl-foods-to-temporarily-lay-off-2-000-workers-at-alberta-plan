XL Foods Inc. will temporarily lay
off 2,000 workers at a beef-slaughtering plant in Brooks,
 Alberta , the company said today in an e-mailed statement.  XL, whose products are linked to one of the largest recalls
in Canadian history, said it’s working with the Canadian Food
Inspection Agency to resume operations. Workers have received
full pay the past three weeks working a 32-hour weekly schedule,
XL said.  E-mail and phone messages left at the company’s press
office outside of regular business hours weren’t immediately
returned. The company’s website says more than 2,000 workers are
employed at the facility.  The cuts come after the Public Health Agency of  Canada 
confirmed on Oct. 8 an 11th case of E. coli linked to meat from
XL. XL, a subsidiary of closely held Nilsson Bros. Inc. in
 Edmonton , Alberta, had its operating license suspended last
month.  The company said today that the Canadian Food Inspection
Agency hadn’t given a definitive timeline for the relicensing of
the plant. Brian Nilsson, a co-chief executive officer of the
company, said in the e-mailed statement that the “uncertainty”
of when relicensing will happen forced the layoffs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
