Saudi Arabian Oil Co. and  Dow
Chemical Co. (DOW)  are seeking funding offers above the $12 billion to
$13 billion needed for their Sadara Chemical Co. petrochemicals
joint venture to try and lock in the most competitive rates.  “Our strategy is to be overfunded and then scale back to
achieve the best terms and conditions,” Luciano Poli, chief
financial officer of the joint venture, said yesterday in an
interview in Dubai. “We’re at a very important stage where all
the different tranches are being finalized and negotiated. We’re
well on schedule and will close the financing soon.”  Sadara, a $20 billion petrochemicals complex being
constructed in  Saudi Arabia ’s  Eastern Province , is being funded
65 percent with debt and the remainder with equity. The U.S.
Export-Import Bank said Sept. 27 it approved a $5 billion loan
for the complex.  The first of the plant’s 26 units will begin operating in
2015, Poli said. Starting up all the units will take 18 months,
he said.  Saudi Aramco  owns 65 percent of the Sadara venture, with
Dow holding the remainder. Aramco plans to sell part of its
stake to the public, after which its share will equal Dow’s.
