China detained a man who disclosed
details about an investigation of former Chongqing Police Chief
Wang Lijun, the state-run  Chengdu  Daily reported today.  The man, identified only by the surname Mao, was detained
seven days for “purposely leaking secrets about national
security and creating severe impact,” according to the report
on the newspaper’s  website .  Bloomberg first reported in February that Wang may have
flown first-class to Beijing with a vice state security minister
one day after meeting American diplomats at the U.S. consulate
in Chengdu. A seat was purchased for Wang on a Feb. 8 flight
from Chengdu to Beijing, according to a website authorized by
China’s aviation regulator to show all commercial air ticket
information.  An airline employee gave passenger information to Mao, who
then posted details about Wang’s flight on the Internet in
February, the paper reported.  Wang’s visit to the U.S. consulate in Chengdu set off the
biggest political shakeup in  China  in a generation and led to
the dismissal from the Communist Party last month of Bo Xilai,
son of one of the founders of the regime and a potential
candidate for a spot on China’s highest decision-making body.  Bo’s wife, Gu Kailai, received a suspended death sentence
after being found guilty in August of poisoning British
businessman Neil Heywood.  Wang was convicted of charges related to the cover-up of
the murder and sentenced to 15 years in prison in September.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
