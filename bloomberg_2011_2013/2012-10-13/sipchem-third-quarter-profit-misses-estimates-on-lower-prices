Saudi International Petrochemical
Co. (SIPCHEM) , known as Sipchem, said third-quarter profit fell 25
percent, missing analyst estimates, as product prices declined.  Net income dropped to 155.8 million riyals ($41.5 million)
from 208.4 million riyals in the same period a year earlier, the
company said in a  statement  to the Saudi bourse today. The  mean
estimate  of six analyst was for a profit of 161 million riyals,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The drop was due “mainly to the decrease in the prices of
some company products,” the company said in the statement.
Nine-month earnings per share was 1.21 riyals, compared with
1.35 riyals for the same period last year, according to the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
