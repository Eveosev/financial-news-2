The pound dropped for a third week
against the dollar after industrial production and house-price
data added to evidence the U.K. economy is struggling to emerge
from a recession.  Sterling also declined against the yen. It gained against
the euro. Reports this week showed  manufacturing  shrank more
than economists forecast in August and house prices fell for a
third month. The U.K. economy has  shrunk  for each of the three
quarters through June and gross domestic product figures for the
period through September are due on Oct. 25. Ten-year gilts
advanced for the third time in four weeks.  “The U.K. fundamental picture is deteriorating,” said Ian Stannard, the head of European foreign exchange strategy at
Morgan Stanley in London. “We are quite bearish on sterling. It
is likely to underperform because its current level doesn’t
fully reflect those fundamentals.”  The pound dropped 0.4 percent this week to $1.6077 as of
5:04 p.m. in London. It has lost 1 percent in the past three
weeks. Sterling strengthened 0.3 percent to 80.54 pence per
euro, after reaching 81 pence on Oct. 9, the weakest level since
Sept. 17. It declined 0.8 percent from the end of last week to
125.89 yen.  Morgan Stanley forecast the pound will weaken to $1.59 by
the end of March.  Economic Contraction  The International Monetary Fund forecast on Oct. 9 that the
U.K. economy will contract 0.4 percent this year before
expanding 1.1 percent in 2013. It previously projected growth of
0.2 percent and 1.4 percent, respectively. Bank of England
Monetary Policy Committee member Martin Weale said the country
could face a triple-dip recession, the Daily Mail reported on
Oct. 11, citing an interview.  The 10-year gilt yield dropped five basis points, or 0.05
percentage point, this week to 1.72 percent. The rate climbed to
1.80 percent on Oct. 11, the highest since Sept. 25. The 1.75
percent bond due in September 2022 rose 0.445, or 4.45 pounds
per 1,000-pound face amount, to 100.26. The yield on  two-year 
gilts was little changed at 0.21 percent.  Gilts may gain next week before a report that economists
said will show inflation slowed last month.  Consumer prices  rose
an annual 2.2 percent in September, compared with 2.5 percent in
August, according to the median forecast of 37 analysts in a
Bloomberg News survey. The data will be published on Oct. 16.  The U.K. Debt Management Office is scheduled to sell 3.75
billion pounds of 4.5 percent gilts due in 2019 on Oct. 18. The
nation last sold those securities on May 1 at an average yield
of 1.495 percent. They yielded 0.93 percent yesterday.  Gilts returned 2.7 percent this year through Oct. 11,
according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. German bonds gained
3 percent and U.S. Treasuries rose 2.2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
