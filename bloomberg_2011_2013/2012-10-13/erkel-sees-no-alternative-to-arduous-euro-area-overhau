German  Chancellor Angela Merkel  said
there’s no way around economic overhauls for euro-area countries
struggling in the debt crisis and pledged to help them defend
the joint currency.  Merkel said she will hold countries to commitments to make
their economies more competitive and attract investors. “It’s
arduous, but I see no other option that leads to a decent
outcome,” she said in a speech to a regional convention of her
Christian Democratic Union party today. “It isn’t some kind of
pressure that were creating to make you suffer.”  While the euro area needs to regain the confidence of
financial markets,  Germany  would bring on “the risk of a
recession” if it refused financial aid to stem the crisis, she
told delegates at Celle in the northern state of Lower Saxony.  Many investors “are betting that we won’t have the
political strength” to defend the euro, she said. “I am
determined to make the effort, even if it’s hard.”  “Trust means that everyone fulfills their commitments,”
she said. “Trust is good, but verification is better. That’s
what I’ll continue to fight for in Europe, every day.”  CDU-led Lower Saxony, home to companies such as  Volkswagen
AG (VOW)  and  Continental AG (CON) , holds state elections on Jan. 20.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
