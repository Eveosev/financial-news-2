Banque Saudi Fransi (BSFR) , partly owned by
Credit Agricole SA, said it received approval from the Saudi
central bank to issue as much 2.5 billion riyals ($667 million)
in sukuk.  The Islamic bonds will enhance the bank’s capital base and
help expand its lending activities, the Riyadh-based lender said
in a statement to the  Saudi bourse website  today. The maturity
of the sukuk is no more than five years, it said.  Sales of sukuk in the six-member Gulf Cooperation Council
have almost quadrupled this year to $18.5 billion as Saudi
Arabia’s state-run  General Authority of Civil Aviation  and
Qatar’s government sold $4 billion each, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Qatar International Islamic Bank (QIIK)  and
Riyadh-based  Kingdom Holding Co. (KINGDOM) , the investment company of
Saudi billionaire  Prince Alwaleed bin Talal , are among those
that plan to tap the sukuk market.  Banque Saudi Fransi will seek further approval for sukuk,
according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
