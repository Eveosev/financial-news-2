Iron ore imports  by  China , the
world’s biggest buyer of the commodity, climbed to a 20-month
high on speculation steel demand may increase.  Imports totaled 65.01 million metric tons in September,
China’s customs bureau said today on its website. The shipments,
the highest since January 2011, rose 4.1 percent from August and
7.3 percent from the 60.57 million tons a year earlier,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Prices for the steelmaking material, which plunged to a
near three-year low of $86.70 a ton on Sept. 5, have rebounded
32 percent after China announced plans for extra infrastructure
spending. The nation’s exports grew at the fastest pace in three
months in September, easing concern that the global economy is
heading for the first recession since 2009.  “Expectation of higher steel consumption in autumn also
triggered some buying activities,” Zhou Yuanjian, a Shanghai-
based analyst with Mysteel.com, said by phone before the imports
announcement.  Ore with 62 percent content  delivered to the Chinese port
of Tianjin fell to $114.5 a dry ton yesterday from $115.8 a day
earlier, according to the Steel Index Ltd.  Iron ore inventories  held at Chinese ports have dropped 3.7
percent to 96.35 million tons as of Oct. 12, from a record 100.1
million tons set in July, according to data from Shanghai
Steelhome Information. An “aggressive” industry-wide
destocking of  iron ore  has ended, Graeme Train, a Shanghai-based
analyst with Macquarie Group Ltd., said Sept. 28 in Dalian.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
