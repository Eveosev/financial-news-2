Theo Walcott will miss  England ’s
World Cup soccer qualifier in Poland with a chest injury, the
Football Association said on its website.  The Arsenal forward left last night’s 5-0 win over  San
Marino  after colliding with goalkeeeper Aldo Simoncini in the
opening minutes and spent the night in the hospital.  “He was monitored overnight as a precaution and following
scan results today will return to his club for further
treatement,” the F.A. said.  England meets Poland in three days at the National Stadium
in Warsaw. England leads European qualifying Group H with seven
points from three matches.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
