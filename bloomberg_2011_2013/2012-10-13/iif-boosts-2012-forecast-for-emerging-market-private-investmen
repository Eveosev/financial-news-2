Private investments in  emerging
markets  will fall less than forecast this year helped by easing
measures taken by the  Federal Reserve  and  European Central Bank ,
according to the  Institute of International Finance .  Flows to emerging markets will decline “modestly” to
about $1.03 trillion, an upward revision of $114 billion from
the IIF’s forecast in June, it said in a statement today as part
of its annual meeting in Tokyo. Its forecast for next year was
boosted by $106 billion to $1.1 trillion, projecting the first
increase since 2010.  The international bank lobbying group cited the Fed’s plan
to purchase $40 billion of mortgage-backed securities a month
aimed at boosting jobs and the ECB’s so-called Outright Monetary
Transactions bond-purchasing program. Deleveraging by banks,
specifically lenders coping with the region’s debt crisis, is
still weighing on investment, it said.  “The 2013 forecasts reflect a balance of two opposing
factors -- a weaker global growth environment, countered by more
monetary stimulus,” Philip Suttle, IIF deputy managing director
and chief economist, said in the statement.  Total private flows in 2007 reached a high of $1.24
trillion, according to the IIF. The lobby group revised the
forecast on June 7, saying ECB funding reduced pressure on banks
to scale back business.  To contact the reporter on this story:
