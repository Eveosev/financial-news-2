Chancellor Angela Merkel  said global
markets “often have completely different interests” than
policy makers, requiring  Germany  to try to reduce debt to ensure
its financial independence.  Solid finances are needed “so we can be self-determined,”
Merkel said in a speech to the Lower Saxony state convention of
her Christian Democratic Union party in the northern town of
Celle today.  Curbing debt “isn’t a penny pinchers’ project” but about
giving people the chance to shape their future, Merkel said.
“It won’t always be easy.”  Lower Saxony, which has a CDU-led government, holds state
elections on Jan. 20.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
