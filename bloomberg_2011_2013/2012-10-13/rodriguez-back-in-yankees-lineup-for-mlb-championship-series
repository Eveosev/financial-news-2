Alex Rodriguez , who was benched
during the New York Yankees’ decisive playoff division series
game yesterday, was back on the roster for Game 1 of the
American League Championship Series against the Detroit Tigers.  Rodriguez will bat sixth and play third base in tonight’s
Major League Baseball game at Yankee Stadium.  “This is a guy that we really need to get going,” Yankees
manager  Joe Girardi  said. “I believe he’s going to
contribute.”  Rodriguez is batting .125 in four postseason games this
year. He has been hitless, with nine strikeouts, in 12 at-bats
against right-handed pitching. Girardi pinch-hit for Rodriguez
in Games 3 and 4, before taking him out in Game 5.  The Tigers will start righthander Doug Fister in tonight’s
Game 1.  The Yankees earned a 3-2 advantage in the division series
against the Baltimore Orioles to advance to the best-of-seven
championship series on the way to the  World Series  that starts
Oct. 24.  To contact the reporter on this story:
