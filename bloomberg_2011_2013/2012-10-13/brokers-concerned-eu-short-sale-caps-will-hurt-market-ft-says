Investors and brokers are concerned
that new European Union requirements to disclose short-selling
positions and settle trades faster will impede the market, the
 Financial Times  said, citing a trade group and a market maker.  The restrictions may hurt companies with small market
values and reduce their access to capital, the newspaper cited
John Barrass of the Association of Private Client Investment
Managers and Stockbrokers and market maker Winterflood as saying.  The new rules are due to take effect Nov. 1, the FT said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
