Spain ’s 10-year bonds advanced for a
second week after  Standard & Poor’s  cut the nation’s debt rating
to one level above non-investment grade, increasing speculation
the country is poised to request a sovereign bailout.  Ten-year rates fell to the lowest in almost a month even
after Deputy Prime Minister Soraya Saenz de Santamaria said two
days ago that Spain wants to see consensus among European
governments before deciding whether to seek help. German bunds,
the region’s benchmark securities, rose after the  International
Monetary Fund  lowered its forecasts for euro-region gross
domestic product, underlining the fragility of the economy.  “The bulk of the attention will continue to be on Spain
and whether they will ask for aid,” said  Luca Cazzulani , a
senior fixed-income strategist at UniCredit SpA in Milan.
“Bunds have done a bit better this week. The IMF reports were
very cautious about the outlook and there’s ongoing uncertainty
about the euro region.”  Ten-year Spanish yields fell six basis points, or 0.06
percentage point, last week to 5.63 percent at 4:58 p.m. London
time yesterday. They reached 5.61 percent, the lowest since
Sept. 14. The 5.85 percent securities maturing in January 2022
climbed 0.43, or 4.30 euros per 1,000-euro ($1,294) face amount,
to 101.555.  Rating Cut  Standard & Poor’s cut Spain’s sovereign-debt rating by two
levels to BBB- on Oct. 10, citing euro-region peers’
backtracking on a pledge to sever the link between the sovereign
and its banks. Moody’s Investors Service is studying a possible
downgrade for the nation from its current Baa3 level, the lowest
investment-grade rank with that company. A bailout plan would
enable European authorities to ease Spanish borrowing costs in
return for economic reforms.  Spain will auction 12-month and 18-month bills on Oct. 16.
It is also due to sell 4 percent securities maturing in 2015,
4.25 percent notes due in 2016 and 5.85 percent bonds due in
2022 on Oct. 18. European leaders will meet in Brussels for a
two-day summit on Oct. 18 and 19.  German 10-year bund yields fell eight basis points over the
week to 1.45 percent. The rate touched 1.44 percent yesterday,
the lowest since Oct. 4.  The euro-area economy will contract 0.4 percent this year,
0.1 percentage point lower than forecast in July, the IMF
 predicted  in its World Economic Outlook on Oct. 9. The region
will expand 0.2 percent in 2013, less than the 0.7 percent
forecast by the fund three months ago.  German  government bonds  returned 3 percent this year
through Oct. 11, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and
the European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies,
outperforming Spanish bonds, which gained 1.8 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
