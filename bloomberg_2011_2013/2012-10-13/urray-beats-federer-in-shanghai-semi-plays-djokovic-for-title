Two-time defending champion  Andy Murray  beat top-ranked  Roger Federer  to advance to the Shanghai
Masters tennis final today against Novak Djokovic.  Murray, the No. 3 seed from Britain, won 6-4, 6-4 at the Qi
Zhong Tennis Center. The U.S. Open champion improved his record
to 10-8 all-time against Federer, who this week clinched his
record-extending 300th week atop the ATP World Tour Rankings.  “I was able to be very aggressive on his second serve,”
Murray said yesterday. “He, maybe, slowed down his first serve
a little bit so I was able to take a few more chances on his
first serve.”  Federer’s had difficulty with his serve and in one stretch
he double-faulted three straight times.  “You’ll pay the price by having an average game like that
against a top guy like Andy,” Federer said.  Second-seeded Djokovic beat No. 4 Tomas Berdych of the
Czech Republic 6-3, 6-4 in the first semifinal. The Serb is 10-1
in his career against Berdych.  The last time the top four seeds reached the semifinals of
an ATP World Tour Masters tournament was at Toronto in August
2010.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
