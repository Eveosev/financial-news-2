Daniel Descalso and Pete Kozma had
two-out, two-run singles as the  St. Louis Cardinals  rallied for
four runs in the ninth inning to beat the Washington Nationals
9-7 and reach the National League Championship Series.  The defending World Series champion Cardinals trailed 6-0
after three innings in the decisive Game 5 of the Major League
Baseball playoff series. They trailed 7-5 entering the ninth
inning.  The Cardinals, who captured the series three games to two,
moved on to face the  San Francisco Giants  in the championship
series.  In the American League, CC Sabathia pitched a four-hitter
last night as the  New York Yankees  beat the Baltimore Orioles
3-1 to wrap up their division playoff and advance to the AL
Championship Series beginning tonight in New York against the
 Detroit Tigers .  Rookie Bryce Harper broke out of his batting slump with a
home run and a run-scoring triple as the Nationals scored three
runs in the first and three more in the third.  Harper, 19, who entered the game hitting .056 in the
postseason after having a .270 batting average during the
regular season, tripled in a run in the first inning and then
scored on  Ryan Zimmerman ’s home run. In the third, Harper’s home
run and a two-run homer by Michael Morse made it 6-0.  The Cardinals scored one in the fourth inning on a run-
scoring double by  Matt Holliday  and added two runs in the fifth
on a wild pitch and a bases-loaded walk.  St. Louis pulled within 6-4 on a run-scoring groundout by
Holliday in the seventh inning, and within a run on Descalso’s
leadoff home run in the eighth.  Washington’s Kurt Suzuki made it 7-5 in the eighth with a
run-scoring single.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
