A pair of 1941 Sun Yat-sen stamps 
from  China  sold for HK$5.5 million ($709,000) in Hong Kong, 
setting a world auction record,  Zurich Asia  auction house
said today.  The pair of vertically attached stamps of the Chinese 
revolutionary figure is particularly rare because of an error 
in which some of the stamp is printed upside down, including the
$2 sign, Zurich Asia said in a press release.  The previous highest price for a Republic of China stamp
was set in March when an inverted Sun Yat Sen stamp sold for
HK$2.4 million, the auction house said.  (Frederik Balfour is a reporter-at-large for Muse, the arts
