San Francisco  Giants outfielder
Melky Cabrera will still miss the team’s effort to capture the
National League Championship Series after his 50-game suspension
for violating  Major League Baseball ’s drug policy ended.  Cabrera, 28, who had a positive testosterone test, was
reinstated on the Giants’ 40-man roster yesterday after sitting
out 45 regular-season and five National League Division Series
games. The Giants captured the best-of-five division series 3-2
over the  Cincinnati Reds  and will open the NL Championship
series against the defending World Series champion  St. Louis
Cardinals  tomorrow.  The Giants will use the players that helped them clinch a
playoff spot during the past two months, manager Bruce Bochy
said Sept. 27.  “Cabrera’s status regarding the postseason remains
unchanged,” said Bobby Evans, Giants vice president of baseball
operations, according to the  Associated Press .  Cabrera was suspended on Aug. 15 for using the muscle-
builder testosterone. He admitted to taking the banned substance
and accepted the punishment.  Cabrera was leading the NL, hitting .346 with 11 home runs
and 60 runs batted in, at the time of his suspension. He removed
himself from consideration for the NL batting title, which he
was leading with less than a week remaining in the season.  To make room on the roster, San Francisco sent right-hander
Shane Loux and outfielder Justin Christian to Triple-A Fresno.  To contact the reporter on this story:
