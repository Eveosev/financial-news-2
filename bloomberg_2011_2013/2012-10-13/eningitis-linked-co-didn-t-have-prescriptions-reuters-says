New England Compounding Center, a
pharmacy linked to a fatal, 12-state meningitis outbreak, sold
medication without gaining individual proof of prescriptions,
 Reuters  reported, citing e-mails it obtained.  More than a dozen e-mails also showed the Framingham,
Massachusetts-based company sought to win bulk orders from
physicians, the news service said. Both actions seem to support
regulators’ statements that rules were violated, Reuters said.  The e-mails also show that NECC referred business between
it and a neurosurgery clinic in  Mississippi  to a sister company,
Ameridose LLC, Reuters said. Ameridose earlier this week said
the two companies operated separately, Reuters said.  There have been 185 confirmed cases of meningitis caused by
fungal contamination traced to vials from NECC that mixed a
steroid shot and sold it to 75 hospitals and clinics in 23
states, the  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  said
today. Fourteen people have died from the infection, the CDC
said. The drug, used to treat neck and back pain, was
contaminated during the mixing process.  New England Compounding Center didn’t immediately respond
to a voicemail message left by  Bloomberg News  seeking comment,
and calls to Ameridose went unanswered. A representative for
both companies declined to comment to Reuters.  To contact the reporter on this story:
