Mexico  is looking for the family of
the alleged top leader of the Zetas cartel that the government
says it killed in a gunbattle on Oct. 7, according to a story in
 Mileneo .  While investigators have scientifically proven that
Heriberto Lazcano Lazcano, known as “El Lazca,” was killed,
they say they want to use DNA from his relatives as an
additional method of verification, according to the article.  Mexican authorities say fingerprints from the body confirm
it’s that of El Lazca. His corpse was stolen from a funeral home
by armed commandos in a raid after midnight on Oct. 8, officials
say.  The Zetas, formed from a group of deserters from the
Mexican Special Forces, have been involved in much of the worst
drug-related violence since President  Felipe Calderon  took
office in 2006 and deployed the military to combat organized
crime gangs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
