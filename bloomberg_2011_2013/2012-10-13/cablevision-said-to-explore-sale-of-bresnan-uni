Cablevision Systems Corp. (CVC)  is
exploring a sale of its Bresnan Broadband Holdings LLC unit
after acquiring the northwestern U.S. cable system in 2010,
according to a person familiar with the situation.  The sale discussions are preliminary and no investment
banks have been hired to advise on a deal yet, the person said,
who asked not to be named because negotiations are private.  Cablevision, the fifth-largest U.S. cable company by
subscribers, bought Bresnan from Providence Equity Partners Inc.
in December 2010 for $1.37 billion, giving it access to states
including Colorado, Montana and Wyoming. The company may be
looking to sell as it spends more money on New York-area systems
to increase customers’ broadband speeds and after several cable
companies, including Knology Inc. and WaveDivision Holdings LLC,
have found private buyers this year.  Potential suitors for Bresnan include  Time Warner Cable
Inc. (TWC) , Suddenlink Communications and  Charter Communications Inc. (CHTR) ,
the person said. Charter’s Chief Executive Officer  Tom Rutledge 
was Cablevision’s former chief operating officer.  The Wall Street Journal earlier reported the company was
weighing a sale of Bresnan.  Charlie Schueler, a spokesman for the Bethpage,  New York- 
based company, said yesterday it was Cablevision’s policy “not
to comment on rumors or speculation.”  Cablevision’s shares closed up 1.1 percent to $16.91 in  New
York  trading yesterday, taking its gain for the year to 19
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
