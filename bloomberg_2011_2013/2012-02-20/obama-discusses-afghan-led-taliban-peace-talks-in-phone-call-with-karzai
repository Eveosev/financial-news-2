U.S. President  Barack Obama  and
Afghan President  Hamid Karzai  discussed efforts to begin Afghan-
led talks with the Taliban, the White House press office said in
a statement today outlining a call between the two leaders.  Obama and Karzai “discussed regional support for Afghan-
led reconciliation, the Afghanistan-Pakistan-Iran trilateral
meetings last week in Islamabad, and other strategic issues,”
according to the statement. The two “remain closely aligned”
and will speak again soon, it said.  Afghanistan is seeking regional help in peace talks as the
U.S. withdraws troops from a decade-old conflict and hands over
security responsibilities to the Afghan army and police force.
Karzai met last week in Islamabad with Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari and Iranian President  Mahmoud Ahmadinejad  for talks
on regional security and trade.  After repeated public rejections by the Taliban of a role
for Karzai’s government in peace negotiations, the insurgents’
negotiators have met with representatives of the U.S. and Afghan
governments in Afghanistan and overseas, Karzai’s chief
spokesman said in a Feb. 16 interview.  A National Intelligence Estimate completed in December,
though, raised questions about the Taliban’s interest in
negotiating with the Karzai government, rather than waiting for
a U.S. withdrawal, and said the militant group remains intent on
reimposing its brand of Islamic rule on Afghanistan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
