Turkcell Iletisim Hizmetleri AS (TCELL) ,
 Turkey ’s largest mobile phone company, headed to its one-year
high after the company’s fourth-quarter earnings forecast beat
analyst estimates.  The stock increased 1.6 percent to 9.92 liras, the highest
since Feb. 23, 2011, on a closing basis as of 3:57 p.m. in
Istanbul. It rose 12 percent this year compared with a 20
percent jump in the benchmark Istanbul National 100 Index.  Fourth-quarter earnings will probably be 330 million liras
($188.1 million), the company said in a statement after the
market closed Feb. 17. Previous guidance for currency losses of
263 million liras at Belarus unit BeST is no longer valid, it
said.  Analysts predicted earnings of 255.6 million liras,
according to the average of 17 estimates in a Bloomberg survey.
Turkcell will hold a review of its 2011 financial and
operational performance on Feb. 23, according to an e-mail from
the company today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
