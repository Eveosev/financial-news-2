The following companies had unusual
price changes in Bogota trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of the close of trading in Bogota.  The  IGBC Index (IGBC)  gained 0.5 percent to 14,646.81, while the
Colcap Index rose 0.2 percent to 1,714.26.  Almacenes Exito SA (EXITO)  ,  Colombia ’s biggest publicly
traded retailer, rose 1.6 percent, the most in three weeks, to
25,400 pesos. Colombia concluded the first round of negotiations
for an accord to deepen trade with Uruguay last week, and a
second round will take place in April, according to a Feb. 17
statement from Colombia’s trade ministry.  Exito last year agreed to purchase majority stakes in
Uruguayan retailers Disco and Devoto for $746 million from
French supermarket operator Casino Guichard-Perrachon SA.  Avianca Taca Holding SA (PFAVTA)  (PFAVTA CB), the owner of
Colombia’s largest airline, rose 0.2 percent to 4,405 pesos.  Operations have returned to normal after the carrier had to
cancel flights over four days because of labor actions by air-
traffic controllers seeking better working conditions. The
company said in an e-mailed statement that the government and
the controllers reached an agreement last night.  Empresa de Telecomunicaciones de Bogota SA  (ETB CB), the
phone company serving Colombia’s capital, rose the most in a
month after brokerage Valores Bancolombia said shares may almost
double in price this year, according to an e-mailed report
today.  ETB, as the company is known, rose 8.4 percent to 516
pesos, the biggest gain since Jan. 12.  To contact the reporter on this story:
