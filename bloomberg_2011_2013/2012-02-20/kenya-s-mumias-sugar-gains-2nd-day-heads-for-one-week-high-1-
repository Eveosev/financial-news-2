Mumias Sugar Co. (MSUG) ,  Kenya ’s biggest
producer of the sweetener, gained for a second day and headed
for its highest close in a week on speculation the stock was
oversold.  Mumias gained 4.4 percent to 4.75 shillings by 2:03 p.m. in
Nairobi, the capital. A close at this level would be the highest
since Feb. 13. The shares are still down 11 percent this year.  “The stock is oversold because the earnings we saw did not
warrant a such a decline,” Francis Mwangi, head of research at
Nairobi-based Standard Investment Bank Ltd., said in a phone
interview today. “We have a value of 8.3 shillings so to us it
is attractive at the current levels.”  The valuation is based on sugar distribution costs having
fallen and the average price of sugar in the six months to Dec.
31 rising to 106,000 shillings ($1,276) per ton from 69,000
shillings, Mwangi said.  Mumias posted profit for the six months through December of
881.3 million shillings, compared with 829.6 million shillings a
year earlier, it said Feb. 3. Revenue declined to 6.92 billion
shillings from 7.32 billion shillings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
