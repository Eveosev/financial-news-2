Brent crude  may extend this year’s
advance to $127 a barrel after prices gave two signals to buy
the commodity, according to  technical analysis  by Societe
Generale SA.  Brent traded at about $120 a barrel on the London-based ICE
Futures Europe exchange, having climbed 8 percent this month.
Weekly prices completed a “head and shoulders” formation at
the end of last year, typically an indicator of further gains,
and at the end of January broke above a downward-sloping channel
that had capped the market since April, London-based technical
analyst Stephanie Aymes said in a report on Feb. 18.  There has been a “weekly double buy signal triggered,”
Aymes wrote.  The first “shoulder” of the head and shoulders pattern
was formed in early September, the head in early October, and
the second shoulder through to mid-December, she said.  This may push the April Brent contract to as much as last
year’s peak at $122.20, according to  Societe Generale . Reaching
this point may trigger additional gains toward $126 or $127 a
barrel, Aymes said.  In March, when the difference between Brent and the U.S.
oil benchmark, West Texas Intermediate, was about $8 a barrel,
Aymes correctly predicted the spread would widen. It reached a
closing peak in October of $27.88 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
