Doosan Heavy Industries &
Construction Co. (034020)  announced 1.5 trillion won ($1.3 billion) of
orders to build five boilers for Indian power plants, the first
contracts won by a unit it acquired in the country last year.  The 800-megawatt boilers will be installed at  NTPC Ltd. (NTPC) 
facilities by 2016, Changwon, South Korea-based Doosan said in
an e-mailed statement today. Three will be used at the Kudgi
power plant in Karnataka state in  India ’s southwest, and two in
the Lara facility in Chhattisgarh, central India, it said.  India, which is adding electricity-generating capacity to
support economic growth, may build 25 gigawatts of plants a year
until 2020 that will generate $25 billion of orders industrywide,
Doosan Heavy said today. Doosan Heavy,  South Korea ’s biggest
power-equipment maker, agreed to buy Indian boiler-maker AE&E
Chennai Works for 20.5 million euros ($27 million) in January
2011.  Doosan Heavy rose 1.7 percent to 70,600 won in Seoul
trading. The stock has advanced 8 percent this year, compared
with an 11 percent gain for South Korea’s Kospi index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
