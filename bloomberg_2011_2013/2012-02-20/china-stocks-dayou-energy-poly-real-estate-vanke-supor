market, while maintaining its property control directions,  Li Daokui , an adviser to the central bank, said on his blog on Feb.
19. His comments came after China’s January home prices recorded
their worst performance in at least a year, with none of the 70
cities monitored by the government posting gains.  Henan Dayou Energy Co. (600403)  (600403 CH) jumped 5.7 percent to
28.17 yuan, the highest close since Dec. 12. The company said it
plans to raise as much as 7.5 billion yuan ($1.2 billion) by
selling as many as 350 million shares in a private placement to
finance acquisitions of coal production assets from its parent.  Zhejiang Supor cookware Co.  (002032 CH), China’s biggest
producer of kitchen appliances, slid 2.4 percent to 15.30 yuan,
its biggest loss in almost two weeks. The  China Central
Television  reported on Feb. 16 that some of the company’s
stainless steel cookware has a high manganese level. The company
said its products are safe, according to a statement. Groupe SEB
SA, which owns Supor, said on Feb. 17 that some of its Supor
brand products meet Chinese standards and the level of manganese
in the products conforms with the international norms.  --Zhang Shidong. Editor: Richard Frost  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
