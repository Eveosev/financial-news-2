Triathlon events draw competitors
with a household income of about $100,000, most of whom seek
inexpensive hotel rooms while taking part, a  survey  said.  While participation in the sport, which involves swimming,
biking and running, draws high-earning, college-educated
athletes and has grown more than six-fold in the U.S. since its
debut in the 2000 Olympics, the top issue facing competitors is
rising costs, according to the study released yesterday by the
 Active Network Inc.  and Triathlon America.  “They’re willing to spend money, but they’re actually
reasonably stingy,”  Dave Alberga , chief executive officer of
Active Network, said yesterday in an interview in  San Diego .
“These are not luxury travelers.”  In a survey of 1,700 U.S. triathletes, 55 percent had a
household income of more than $100,000 a year, 90 percent
attended college or have a post-graduate degree, 70 percent work
full time and 74 percent own their own home.  Seventy-nine percent of the triathletes surveyed search for
discount rooms at budget or moderate-priced hotels, while about
20 percent stay at luxury or upscale hotels while competing,
said Alberga, who is attending the Triathlon America Business of
Triathlon conference.  In total, triathletes spend about $1,275 annually on
travel, $717 on bike equipment, $164 on wetsuits, $107 on
apparel and $95 on running shoes, the survey said.  Growth Among Women  The largest participation growth in the sport is among
women. In 2011, 40 percent of all triathletes were women, up
from 27 percent in 2000, according to the survey.  “This report will provide additional intelligence for
organizations interested in reaching this active consumer
audience, as well as provide insight into how event directors
can increase participation,” Jack Caress, President of
 Triathlon America , said yesterday at a press conference.  USA Triathlon says there were 420,000 participants in its
sanctioned events last year.  When it comes to spending on swimming, biking and apparel
purchases, an average of 26 percent of respondents listed price
as the main factor. Cost outweighed such things as  customer
service  and fit when buying the product, the survey revealed.
For running shoes, 15 percent listed price as a concern, behind
fit (20%) and brand loyalty (26%).  To contact the reporter on this story:
