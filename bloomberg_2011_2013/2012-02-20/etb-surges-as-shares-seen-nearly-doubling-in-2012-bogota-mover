Empresa de Telecomunicaciones de
Bogota SA , the phone company serving  Colombia ’s capital, rose
the most in a month after brokerage Valores Bancolombia said
shares may almost double in price this year.  ETB, as the company is known, rose 9.3 percent to 520 pesos
at 3:15 p.m. in Bogota, the biggest gain since Jan. 12. The
benchmark IGBC Index advanced 0.3 percent.  Valores Bancolombia set a 2012 year-end target price of 900
pesos, estimating operating profit and revenue will increase 2
percent this year to 256 billion pesos ($144 million) and 1.5
trillion pesos, respectively. If the company maintains its
distribution policy it could have one of the country’s highest
dividend returns, “an attractive factor for investors with high
risk tolerance,” Bogota-based analyst Samuel David Garcia wrote
in a report to clients today.  The risks include the unknown details of Bogota mayor-elect
Gustavo Petro’s proposal to create a holding company for ETB and
other public utilities, the report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
