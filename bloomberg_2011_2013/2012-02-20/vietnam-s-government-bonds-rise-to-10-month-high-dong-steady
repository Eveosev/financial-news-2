Vietnam ’s government bonds rose,
pushing the benchmark five-year yield to the lowest level in
more than 10 months, on signs demand is increasing. The dong was
steady.  The State Treasury received bids for 7.54 trillion dong
($362 million) of five-year bonds and 7.9 trillion dong of
three-year securities at an auction last week, according to
figures from the Hanoi Stock Exchange. It offered 2 trillion
dong of each maturity.  “Bond yields fell as banks increased purchases of new debt
to replace bonds that are maturing this year,” said Nguyen Thanh Danh, a Ho Chi Minh City-based money-market dealer at
Saigon Thuong Tin Commercial Joint-Stock Bank.  The  yield  on five-year government notes fell 13 basis
points, or 0.13 percentage point, to 12.10 percent, the lowest
level since April 15, according to a daily fixing from banks
compiled by Bloomberg.  Demand for debt will rise because more than 50 trillion
dong of  government securities  will mature by the end of the year,
Thoi Bao Ngan Hang newspaper reported today, citing unnamed
bankers.  The dong was little changed at 20,840 per dollar as of 4:18
p.m. in Hanoi, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
central bank fixed the  reference rate  at 20,828 today, according
to its website. The currency is allowed to trade up to 1 percent
on either side of the rate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
