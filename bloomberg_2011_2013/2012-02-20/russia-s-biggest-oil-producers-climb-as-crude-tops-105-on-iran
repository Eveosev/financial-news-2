OAO Rosneft (ROSN)  and OAO  Lukoil (LKOH) , Russia’s
biggest oil producers, climbed more than 1 percent as crude oil
rose to a nine-month high after Iran said it halted some
exports.  Rosneft added as much as 1.2 percent before closing up 0.4
percent at 219.32 rubles by 6:45 p.m. in Moscow. Lukoil gained
as much as 1.1 percent, its first advance in two days, and
closed up 0.3 percent at 1,879.90 rubles.  Iran will supply crude to “new customers” instead of
companies in the U.K. and France, the oil ministry’s news
website, Shana, said, citing Alireza Nikzad Rahbar, a spokesman.
Oil rose as much as 2.1 percent to $105.44 in New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
