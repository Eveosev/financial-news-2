Greece  should follow Cyprus’s lead
in exploring for offshore oil and gas, Greek New Democracy
leader Antonis Samaras said in Nicosia today following a meeting
with Cypriot President Demetris Christofias.  “We’re closely monitoring the developments concerning the
exclusive economic zones” in Cyprus and “Greece should take
similar practical steps” to sign agreements with neighboring
countries on maritime borders, Samaras said, according to a
 transcript  of his comments posted on the website of the Cyprus
government’s Press and Information Office.  Cyprus and Greece could form a joint strategy on offshore
hydrocarbon deposits and on economic issues, Samaras said.  Noble
Energy Inc. (NBL) , the U.S. company which has the license to explore
and exploit gas in Block 12 of Cyprus’s offshore territory, said
on Dec. 28 that it discovered as much as 8 trillion cubic feet
of gas off the island’s southern coast, Cyprus’s first ever
discovery.  While  New Democracy  would garner most votes if an election
were held now in Greece, the party would not gain enough seats
to pass the 151 majority threshold, three polls showed over the
weekend.  To contact the reporter on this story:
