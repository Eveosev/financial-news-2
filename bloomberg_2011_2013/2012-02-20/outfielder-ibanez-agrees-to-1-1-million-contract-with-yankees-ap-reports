The  New York Yankees  have signed
outfielder Raul Ibanez to a one-year, $1.1 million contract,
 Associated Press  reported, citing a person familiar with the
agreement.  Yankees spokesman Michael Margolis would not confirm the
report.  MLB.com  reported that the deal hasn’t been announced
because he hasn’t taken a physical yet.  Ibanez, 39, who played for the Philadelphia Phillies the
past three seasons, is expected to be the Yankees designated
hitter against right-handed pitchers, the AP said. He played in
144 games last season, hitting .245 with 20 homers and 84 runs
batted in.  The signing came a day after the Yankees traded  A.J. Burnett  to Pittsburgh. The Pirates will pay $5 million of the
starting pitcher’s salary this year, AP said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
