German  bunds  fell for a third day on
speculation European finance ministers meeting today will reach
agreement on a 130 billion-euro ($172 billion) aid package for
 Greece , reducing demand for the region’s safest securities.  Spain ’s 10-year bonds advanced, driving the additional
yield investors demand to hold them instead of bunds to a 10-day
low as European officials signaled progress was being made on
Greece’s second international bailout.  Italy ’s 10-year bond
yield fell to a four-month low after a report showed  industrial
orders  increased more than economists forecast. The Netherlands
and  France  auctioned bills.  “It seems the market is now expecting a positive outcome
from today’s euro zone finance ministers meeting,” said Elwin de Groot, a market economist at Rabobank Nederland in Utrecht.
“The immediate impact on bunds is negative, because there is
less headline risk so it reduces safe-haven demand.”  The German 10-year yield climbed four basis points, or 0.04
percentage point, to 1.96 percent at 4:14 p.m. London time. The
2 percent bond due in January 2022 dropped 0.350, or 3.50 euros
per 1,000-euro face amount, to 100.315.  German Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  told reporters
today that he is confident euro-area governments will settle the
final details of the second aid program for Greece. The
Mediterranean nation accepts the idea of paying the aid funds
into a special account that will give creditor countries more
control over how the money is spent, he said.  Consensus Forged  A consensus appears to have been forged on reducing
 interest rates  for loans granted to Greece and the treatment of
bonds held by national central banks, said a Greek finance
ministry official, who declined to be named. The meeting of
European Union finance ministers got underway at 3:30 p.m.
in Brussels.  “The market is expecting it to go well and that is putting
a bit of a downside on the bund market,” said Marius Daheim, a
senior fixed-income strategist at  Bayerische Landesbank  in
Munich.  Italian industrial orders jumped 5.5 percent in December,
after rising a revised 0.2 percent a month earlier, the
statistics institute said today. Economists predicted a gain of
0.4 percent, a Bloomberg survey showed. Italy’s 10-year bond
 yield  slid 10 basis points to 5.48 percent after earlier
reaching 5.44 percent, the lowest since Oct. 6.  Bunds Underperforming  The bonds of most of  Europe ’s lower-rated nations are
outperforming German bunds as investors bet the crisis will be
contained,  Steven Major , global head of fixed-income research at
HSBC Holdings Plc, said in an interview with Maryam Nemazee on
Bloomberg Television’s “The Pulse.”  “Spain, Italy, Portugal and especially Ireland have done
really well,” Major said.  The Spanish 10-year yield also declined 10 basis points, to
5.15 percent. The spread over bunds narrowed 15 basis points to
318 basis points, the least since Feb. 10.  Irish  government bonds  have handed investors a return of
9.8 percent so far this year, the biggest increase of 26
sovereign-debt indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. Italian debt was the
second-best performer, followed by  Portugal . Greek bonds dropped
6 percent, and German bunds handed investors a loss of 0.5
percent this year, according to the indexes.  “The price action would suggest that Greece is on its
own,” HSBC’s Major said.  French Confidence  The Greek March 2012 note dropped for a fifth day in six.
The yield surged 424 percentage points to 2,473.46 percent and
the price slipped to 33.835 percent of face value.  French bonds rose after the national statistics office said
business confidence was unchanged this month, halting a seven-
month decline. The nation sold 8.03 billion euros of 91-, 168-,
238- and 350-day bills. The 10-year yield dropped one basis
points to 3 percent.  Dutch bonds declined, with the 10-year yield climbing two
basis points to 2.45 percent. Borrowing costs rose at a sale of
1.1 billion euros of 99-day bills today, with the debt
attracting an average yield of 0.05 percent, compared to 0.03
percent when similar-maturity securities were sold on Feb. 6.
The nation also sold 1.2 billion euros of 191-day bills.  To contact the reporters on this story:
