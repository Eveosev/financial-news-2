The Hungarian telecommunications
authorityâ€™s decision to award a fourth mobile frequency to a
group of state-owned companies brought an appeal from at least
one of the three incumbent mobile service providers,
 Vilaggazdasag  reported, without saying how it obtained the
information.  The authority, known as NMHH, has 45 days to carry out a
second-round evaluation and issue a ruling, the Budapest-based
daily said.  A group consisting of postal service Magyar Posta Zrt.,
power company Magyar Villamos Muvek Zrt. and development bank
Magyar Fejlesztesi Bank Zrt. won the 900-megahertz frequency
with an offer of 10 billion forint ($46 million), the newspaper
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
