Mainstream Renewable Power Ltd. will
build a $140 million wind farm in northern  Chile  using machines
made by  Xinjiang Goldwind Science & Technology Co. (2208)  as  China ’s
second-largest turbine-maker increases overseas orders.  Mainstream will use 47 turbines made by Goldwind USA Inc.,
a unit of the Urumqi-based company, at its Ckani wind park in
the Chilean region of Antofagasta, it said today in a statement.  Chinese companies including China Ming Yang Wind Power
Group Ltd. are seeking expansion abroad to combat a slowing home
market after a tighter government approval process for new
projects increased competition. Goldwind bought two wind farms
in  Montana  this year and has taken orders in seven other U.S.
states since it began sales in the region in June 2010.  “While we have much work ahead of us in the Americas, our
efforts in western markets are a testament to how our localized
approach to globalization has helped foster the ongoing health
and growth of the global wind industry,” Wang Haibo, executive
vice president of Goldwind, said in the e-mailed statement.  The 70-megawatt Ckani park, which obtained environmental
approval in December, has a potential capacity of 240 megawatts
for a $480 million investment, Dublin-based Mainstream said. The
company plans to operate the 240 megawatts by 2015.  The first 70 megawatts will use Goldwind’s GW87 1.5
megawatt models and should begin construction by the end of this
year. The deal is the second between the companies in Chile,
which has a 6,435-kilometer (4,000-mile) coastline and sea
breezes that make it suited for  wind energy . Mainstream bought
23 Goldwind turbines for the 34.5-megawatt Negrete Cuel farm in
central Chile in December.  The South American country is studying a law to require it
to get 20 percent of its electricity from renewable sources by
2020, up from 5 percent now, and 10 percent scheduled for 2024.  The agreement today establishes an equal joint venture
between Mainstream and Goldwind to build the park.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
