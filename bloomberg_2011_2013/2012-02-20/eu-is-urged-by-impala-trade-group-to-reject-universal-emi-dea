The Impala trade group representing
independent music companies called on the European Union to
block plans by  Vivendi SA (VIV) ’s  Universal Music Group  to buy EMI
Group’s recorded-music business.  Impala expects an “outright rejection” of the deal by EU
regulators, the group said today in an e-mailed statement.
“Keeping the online market as open as possible is essential for
competition,” Impala said.  The merger bid has been notified to EU competition
authorities, Impala said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
