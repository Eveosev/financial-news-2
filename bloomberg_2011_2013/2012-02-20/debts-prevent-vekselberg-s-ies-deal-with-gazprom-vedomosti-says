OAO Gazprom (GAZP) ’s energy company and
Russian billionaire  Viktor Vekselberg ’s Integrated Energy
Systems are having difficult agreeing to merger terms because of
the debts found at Vekselberg’s company,  Vedomosti  said, citing
a source familiar with the deal.  IES’s debts were estimated at 130 billion rubles ($4.4
billion) at the end of 2011, the newspaper said. The company’s
representatives were out of the office when contacted by
Bloomberg News for comment today.  On Jan. 28, Vekselberg told Bloomberg he’ll walk away from
a plan to merge his power generating assets with OAO Gazprom’s
if a deal isn’t completed this quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story: Marina Sysoyeva in Moscow
