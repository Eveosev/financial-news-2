Societe Generale SA (GLE)  Chief Executive
Officer  Frederic Oudea  wants any financial-transaction tax to be
applied internationally and include  London â€™s financial center,
he told Neue Zuercher Zeitung in an interview.  Everything should be done to attract capital to  Europe ,
rather than scaring it off, the Zurich-based newspaper quoted
Oudea as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
