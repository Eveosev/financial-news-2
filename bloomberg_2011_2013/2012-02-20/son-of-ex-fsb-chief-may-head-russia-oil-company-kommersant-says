Andrei Patrushev, younger son of the
former head of  Russia â€™s security service, was appointed first
deputy general director of a venture between state-owned  OAO
Zarubezhneft (ZRNFT)  and Vietnam Oil & Gas Group, advancing his career
in the energy industry,  Kommersant  reported.  Patrushev, 30, officially starts in his new post at the
Vietsovpetro venture this week, which may be a step toward his
being named the next head of Zarubezhneft, Kommersant said,
citing unidentified people familiar with the matter. Patrushev,
who served in the security service, known as the FSB, joined
Zarubezhneft last year to supervise its Vietnam division after
working at OAO Rosneft since 2006, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story: Marina Sysoyeva in Moscow
