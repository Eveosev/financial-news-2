Kenya ’s shilling climbed for the
first time in four days on signs that the euro-area debt crisis
will be resolved.  The currency of  East Africa ’s biggest economy appreciated
0.3 percent to 82.80 per dollar and was trading 0.2 percent at
82.91 as of 1:15 p.m. in Nairobi.  European officials are meeting today to attempt to fend off
the euro area’s first sovereign default by trying to settle
remaining disputes as they close in on a 130 billion-euro ($171
billion) Greek bailout. The euro gained 0.7 percent against the
dollar.  “The shilling is gaining on the dollar on account of the
strengthening of the euro as the leaders try to resolve the
Greek debt crisis,” Jeremiah Kendagor, acting head of trading
at Nairobi-based Kenya Commercial Bank Ltd., said in a phone
interview.  Tanzania’s shilling appreciated 0.3 percent to 1,595 per
dollar, while  Uganda ’s shilling depreciated 0.4 percent to 2,320
per dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
