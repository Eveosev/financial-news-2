Iran ’s government plans to increase
the value of its cash handouts to the poorest Iranians to make
up for price increases in energy and food, the  Tehran Times 
reported, citing Economy Minister Shamseddin Hosseini.  The government is also looking to cancel cash handouts it
distributes to some three million Iranian families, who it
doesn’t consider to be needy, the Tehran-based newspaper said.  Iran is paying monthly grants of 455,000 rials (about $37)
to 72.5 million Iranians, out of a population of 75 million, to
offset price increases after the start of a plan in December
2010 to phase out energy and food subsidies, economy officials
have said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
