European Central Bank Executive
Board member Peter Praet said the ECB must not become a lender
of last resort for governments.  Funding illiquid sovereigns “either via direct
interventions on the primary market or by extending direct
credit lines” is “not legally within the reach of the ECB,
since the Treaty clearly imposes the prohibition of monetary
financing,” Praet said in a speech in Geneva,  Switzerland ,
today. “There must not be any circumvention to this
prohibition.”  Euro-area finance ministers are meeting in Brussels today
to weigh the terms of new loans to  Greece  to help it avoid
default.  “The sovereign debt crisis has shown that sound public
finances are all the more important in a monetary union where a
large number of independent fiscal policy-makers share the
benefits of a single currency, gaining access to a large pool of
savings and being immunized against exchange-rate risk,” Praet
said.  Recent governance reforms are “encouraging,” Praet said.
“It is of utmost importance, that the rules are now fully
implemented,” he added.  To contact the reporters on this story:
