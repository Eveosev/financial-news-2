The Chinese central bank bought more
foreign exchange than it sold for the first time in four months
in January, spurring speculation capital flowed back to  Asia ’s
largest economy.  Yuan positions at financial institutions accumulated from
foreign-exchange purchases increased to 25.5 trillion yuan ($4.1
trillion) as of the end of January, up 141 billion yuan from the
previous month,  People’s Bank of China data  released today show.  Forward contracts on the yuan have strengthened this year
on speculation the government’s easing policy will help shore up
the economy and the European sovereign debt crisis will ease.
The People’s Bank of China cut the amount of cash that lenders
must set aside as reserves by half a percentage point to 20.5
percent over the weekend, effective Feb. 24.  “The rise in foreign-exchange purchases, coupled with the
somewhat surprising reserve-ratio cut, should support China-
related  market sentiment  this week,” Lu Ting, a Hong Kong-based
economist at the Merrill Lynch unit of Bank of America Corp.,
wrote in a report today.  -- Judy Chen . Editors: Andrew Janes, Ven Ram  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
