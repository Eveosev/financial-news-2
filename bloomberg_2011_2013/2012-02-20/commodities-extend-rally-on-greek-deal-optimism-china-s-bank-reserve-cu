Commodities gained for a fourth day
after  China  cut banks’ reserve requirements and speculation
increased that euro-area governments are set to agree on a deal
to release a second bailout for  Greece , hurting the dollar.  Oil rose as much as 1.9 percent to $105.21 per barrel in
 New York , the highest intraday price since May 5, after Iran
said it halted some crude exports to  Europe . Copper in  London 
advanced as much as 2.7 percent to $8,396.50 per metric ton,
rising for the first day in seven as base metals rallied.  China cut the amount of cash that banks must set aside as
reserves by half a percentage point from Feb. 24, the People’s
Bank of China said Feb. 18. European finance ministers meet in
Brussels today to try and close in on the 130 billion-euro ($172
billion) Greek bailout. The dollar declined against most of its
16 major counterparts, according to data tracked by Bloomberg.  “There’s a general feeling of optimism ahead of the Greece
conclusion,”  Jonathan Barratt , chief executive of Barratt’s
Bulletin, a commodity-markets newsletter, said from Sydney.
“They think they will resolve any outstanding disputes.”  The  Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot Index (SPGSCI)  of 24 commodities
gained for a third day on Feb. 17 to touch 689.75, the highest
level since Aug. 1. There was no updated data today as some U.S.
financial markets are closed for a holiday.  Oil for March delivery traded at $104.99 per barrel on the
 New York Mercantile Exchange  at midday in Singapore, gaining for
a fourth day in the best winning run this year.  Three-month copper traded at $8,315.25 per ton on the
London Metal Exchange as China’s policy change fueled
speculation that base-metal demand may increase in the world’s
largest user. Zinc, tin, lead, nickel, aluminum advanced.  Spot gold rose as much as 0.8 percent to $1,737.18 an ounce
and was at $1,734.45 as silver, platinum and palladium gained.  July-delivery rubber rose to the highest since Sept. 26 on
the Tokyo Commodity Exchange, gaining as much as 3.1 percent to
328.1 yen a kilogram ($4,124 a metric ton) and was at 326 yen.  To contact the reporter for this story:
