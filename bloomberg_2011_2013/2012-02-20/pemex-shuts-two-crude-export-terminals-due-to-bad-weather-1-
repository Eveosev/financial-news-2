Petroleos Mexicanos  closed the oil
export terminals Cayo Arcas and  Dos Bocas  in the Gulf of Mexico
due to adverse conditions, Mexico’s Merchant Marine said today
in its daily weather bulletin.  The port Coatzacoalcos remained open, the Merchant Marine,
an agency of Mexico’s Communications and Transportation
Ministry, said in a report published on its website.  Cayo Arcas is the Mexico City-based company’s largest
export terminal, followed by Coatzacoalcos and Dos Bocas.  Pemex, as the state-owened company is known, is the third-
largest supplier of oil to the U.S., exported about 1.3 million
barrels of crude a day in December. About 84 percent of Mexican
crude exports is sold to the U.S., according to statistics from
Mexico City-based Pemex. Canada is the largest supplier of crude
to the U.S followed by  Saudi Arabia .  To contact the reporter on this story:
