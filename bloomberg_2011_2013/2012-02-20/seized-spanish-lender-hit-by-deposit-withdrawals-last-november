Banco de Valencia SA , a failed
Spanish lender, witnessed a slump in  deposits (BVA)  last November when
market regulators suspended trading in its stock ahead of its
seizure by the Bank of  Spain .  “This line in the balance sheet has been especially
affected by the drop in client deposits that took place between
the suspension of trading of the stock and the intervention in
the company by the Bank of Spain,” the Valencia, Spain-based
lender said in a regulatory filing yesterday. Deposits fell 8.7
percent last year, the bank said.  Spain’s central bank seized Banco de Valencia last November
and placed it under the administration of the government’s bank
rescue fund, which injected 1 billion euros ($1.32 billion) into
the lender after the country’s property crash wrecked its
balance sheet. Trading was suspended in Banco de Valencia’s
shares on Nov. 21 and resumed on Nov. 24.  Banco de Valencia posted a full-year  loss  of 886.8 million
euros compared with a 67.2 million-euro profit a year earlier,
the lender said. The bank said it would need to make 823 million
euros of provisions and set up a 428 million-euro capital buffer
to comply with new government regulations making lenders
recognize more losses on real estate on their balance sheets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
