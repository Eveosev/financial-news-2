Mitsubishi Corp. (8058) , Japan’s biggest
commodity supplier and trader, will seek partners among South
Korean, Chinese and Japanese steelmakers as it looks to share
the cost of developing an iron ore project in Australia.  Mitsubishi took full control of Crosslands Resources Ltd.,
owner of the Jack Hills iron ore deposit, after buying out the
50 percent stake of  Murchison Metals Ltd. (MMX) , the Tokyo-based
company said today in a statement. Mitsubishi  said Nov. 24  that
the transaction value would be A$325 million ($350 million).  Mitsubishi intends to find at least one “suitably
capitalized” partner to take up the stake sold by Murchison
Metals, according to the statement. The trader may seek
investment from resource companies, Masahiro Deguchi, a Tokyo-
based spokesman, said by telephone, declining to identify
specific companies.  China’s  Sinosteel Corp. (SINOSZ) ,  Baoshan Iron & Steel Co. (600019) , and
 Angang Steel Co. (000898) , or South Korea’s  Posco (005490)  may partner Mitsubishi
and get between 30 percent to 50 percent in the $10 billion iron
ore project, Reuters reported, citing unidentified people close
to the deal.  To contact the reporters on this story:
