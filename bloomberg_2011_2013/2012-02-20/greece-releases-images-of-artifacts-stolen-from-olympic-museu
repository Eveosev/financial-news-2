     Feb. 20 (Bloomberg) -- Greece  released images and
descriptions of 77 artifacts stolen last week from the museum of
ancient Olympia, the Archaeological Museum of Olympia, the
birthplace of the  Olympic Games .  Artifacts taken in the heist include a gold ring that was
used as a seal and had a Mycenean bull-leaping scene engraved on
it, 13 ceramic lanterns, a vase from Rhodes used to store olive
oil, 11 bronze wheels and more than 30 ceramic and copper animal
statuettes, according to images released in a joint e-mailed
statement from the Athens-based  Culture Ministry  and the  Citizen
Protection Ministry .  Culture Minister Pavlos Yeroulanos offered to resign on
Feb. 17 after two armed and hooded men tied up the guard and
robbed the museum in southern Greece. The robbery is the second
major theft in two months. On Jan. 9, police reported three
works of art, including a painting by  Pablo Picasso  and donated
by the artist to the Greek people, were stolen from the National
Gallery of Art in central  Athens . The thieves have yet to be
found.  To contact the reporter on this story:
