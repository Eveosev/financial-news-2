Jeremy Lin and the  New York Knicks ’
104-97 victory over the Dallas Mavericks Sunday gave Walt Disney
Co.’s ABC network its third-highest overnight rating for a non-
Christmas Day basketball game, the network said.  The contest was watched in 4.8 percent of U.S. households
in the top 56 media markets. The Boston Celtics-Los Angeles
Lakers game in January 2011 and a Lakers-Cleveland Cavaliers
game in February 2009 both delivered 5.0 overnight ratings, the
network said.  Lin,  who had 28 points, had a career-high 14 assists in the
victory, as the Knicks evened their record at 16-16 and tied the
 Boston Celtics  for second place in the Eastern Conference’s
Atlantic Division. The Knicks are 7-1 since he took over as
point guard.  He is a Harvard University graduate who was cut by two
National Basketball Association teams before joining the Knicks
in late December. Last night he hit 11-of-20 shots to lead six
players who scored more than 10 points for  New York .  J.R. Smith came off the bench to score 15 points in his
Knicks debut, having signed with the team three days ago after
playing in  China  during the NBA lockout.  To contact the reporter on this story:
