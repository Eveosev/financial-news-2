Visa Inc. (V) , the world’s biggest
electronic payments network, plans to increase the volume of
transactions in Kenya by more than 30 percent this year,
according to Victor Ndlovu, country manager for  East Africa .  The number of transactions increased 26 percent to almost 5
billion shillings ($60.2 million) last year, Ndlovu said in an
interview on Feb. 17 in Nairobi, the capital.  “We are obviously trying to grow that much more because of
our presence and what we think we are going to be doing in the
market,” Ndlovu said.  The company opened a regional office in Nairobi in December
that is responsible for operations in about 20 English-speaking
countries in sub-Saharan  Africa , he said. Most of the growth in
Kenya, east Africa’s biggest  economy , is from retail outlets,
travel and entertainment industries.  Visa has almost doubled the number of branded credit cards
in Kenya to 4.1 million at the end of September from 2.7 million
a year earlier, Ndlovu said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
