Commodities gained after  China  cut
banks’ reserve requirements and optimism that  Europe  is set to
agree on a second bailout deal for Greece weakened the dollar.  Oil rose as much as 2.1 percent to $105.44 a barrel in  New
York , the highest intraday price since May 5, after  Iran  halted
some crude exports to Europe, according to a report. Copper in
London advanced as much 2.7 percent to $8,396.50 a metric ton,
rising for the first time in seven days as industrial metals
rallied.  China cut the amount of cash that banks must set aside as
reserves by half a percentage point from Feb. 24, the People’s
Bank of China said Feb. 18. European finance ministers meet in
Brussels today to seek agreement on a 130 billion-euro ($172
billion) Greek bailout. The dollar declined against most of 16
major counterparts tracked by Bloomberg.  “Prices across the complex are firmer after positive
weekend news from China and  Greece ,” Barclays Plc said in an e-
mailed research note. “The flow of macroeconomic news, as well
as market expectations of further accommodative global monetary
policy measures, has helped sentiment stabilize so far this
year.”  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot Index of 24 commodities
rose to 689.75 on Feb. 17, the highest since Aug. 1. There was
no updated data today as some U.S. financial markets are closed
for a holiday.  Oil for March delivery traded at $105.08 a barrel on the
 New York Mercantile Exchange  at 4:10 p.m. in London, gaining for
a fourth day in the best winning run this year.  Alternative Asset  Three-month copper traded at $8,249 a ton on the  London 
Metal Exchange, rebounding from the longest losing streak since
September, on speculation that base-metal demand may increase in
the world’s largest user. Zinc, tin, lead, nickel and aluminum
advanced.  Gold for immediate delivery rose as much as 0.5 percent to
$1,735.00 an ounce as a weaker dollar spurred demand for the
metal as an alternative asset.  Wheat for May delivery advanced 0.5 percent to 210.75 euros
($279.50) a metric ton on the NYSE Liffe exchange in Paris, amid
concern crop damage in Ukraine may prompt the country to curb
exports of the grain.  To contact the reporters for this story:
