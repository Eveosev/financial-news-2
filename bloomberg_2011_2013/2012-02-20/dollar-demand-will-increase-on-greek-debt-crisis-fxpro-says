Investors “will favor the dollar”
as a haven amid speculation Greece will default on its debt,
 Simon Smith , chief economist at currency broker FXPro Group
Ltd., said in a Feb. 17 interview in Singapore.  Finance ministers from the 17 euro-area nations will meet
in Brussels today to decide on 130 billion euros ($172 billion)
in aid to Greece. Prime Minister  Lucas Papademos  said on Feb. 18
his country found all the extra cuts needed to lower spending by
325 million euros to secure a second bailout package aimed at
averting the region’s first sovereign default.  On the outlook for Greece:  “I struggle to see how we can go from here to the end of
the year without either Greece defaulting in a disorganized way
or leaving the euro.  ‘‘In a situation where we do see some sort of bigger event
around  Greece , it’s going to be liquidity, safety and high-
quality assets that investors are going to want, and that will
favor the dollar.’’  On Greek austerity, growth prospects:  ‘‘Greece is just not a competitive country at the moment.  ‘‘With this level of austerity and no option to devalue
their currency or at least go through those normal processes, I
can’t see Greece being in a better position in 10 years if it
remains in the euro in its current form.  ‘‘There’s no room for strategies that will promote growth.
It’s difficult when they have become so uncompetitive in terms
of labor costs and inflation. It’s a massive problem they’re not
really addressing and it’s difficult to address.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
