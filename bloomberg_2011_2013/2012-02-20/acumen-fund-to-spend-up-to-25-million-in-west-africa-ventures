Acumen Fund, a nonprofit venture-
capital fund that invests in  developing countries , plans to
spend $20 million to $25 million in West  Africa  over five years
as it expands on the world’s poorest continent.  “We are currently looking into additional agriculture
investments and housing,” said Teresa Wells, a spokeswoman for
New York-based Acumen, in an e-mailed response to questions Feb.
16. “Raising local philanthropy will be critical to making this
happen.”  Acumen, which has invested in ambulances in  India ,
irrigation systems in Pakistan and toilets in Kenya, opened its
West African branch in the Ghanaian capital, Accra, last week.  “We have already invested $2.5 million in the first year
of our presence in Ghana,” said Jacqueline Novogratz, founder
and chief executive officer, in an interview Feb. 15.  The fund spent $1.5 million on a rice-farming project and
$1 million on a company that documents land ownership, according
to its website. Acumen put $1.8 million in Sproxil, a company
that verifies pharmaceutical products, in part to expand
operations in  Nigeria , Africa’s most-populous nation.  Acumen “is a patient fund,” investing for at least 7
years in a project, Novogratz said. They also work to attract
other capital investment and government interest in projects,
she said. “Any money returned to Acumen is reinvested in new
innovations serving the poor.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
