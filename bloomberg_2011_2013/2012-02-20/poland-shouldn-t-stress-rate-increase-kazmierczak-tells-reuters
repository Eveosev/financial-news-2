Poland ’s central bank, which this
month indicated rate increases are more probable than cuts, may
tone down its rhetoric after the zloty gained and inflation
slowed in January, said central banker Andrzej Kazmierczak said
in an interview with Reuters.  “At this point, maybe we don’t have to highlight the need
for monetary-policy tightening anymore, though this cannot be
ruled out completely either,” Kazmierczak was quoted by Reuters
today as saying. “It is difficult to imagine any easing in
policy.”  The Narodowy Bank Polski has left its  benchmark seven-day
interest rate  at 4.5 percent since June after raising borrowing
costs 1 percentage point in four steps because  inflation  stayed
above the central bank’s 2.5 percent target longer than
expected. In comments following the Monetary Policy Council on
Feb. 8, central bankers, including Andrzej Rzonca,  Adam
Glapinski  and  Zyta Gilowska , ruled out a rate cut.  To contact the reporter on this story:
