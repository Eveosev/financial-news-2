Thirty inmates escaped from a prison
in northern Mexico yesterday under cover of a riot between rival
gang members that left 44 prisoners dead, government officials
said.  Officials at the Apodaca jail, including the director and
18 guards, have been suspended and are under investigation for
possible collusion in the escape, Rodrigo Medina, governor of
Nuevo Leon state, said at a press conference today in Monterrey.  Killings linked to drug cartels have soared since President
Felipe Calderon sent troops to fight crime groups when he took
office in December 2006. Drug-related slayings totaled 47,515
from December 2006 through September 2011, according to the
federal government. Calderon’s crackdown has led to thousands of
arrests, with cartel rivalries within prisons sparking deadly
riots in various states.  “Our great achievements in capturing criminals have led to
our prisons growing overcrowded,” Medina said, calling for the
transfer of some prisoners from the Apodaca jail.  The escape probably couldn’t have worked without the help
of officials within the prison, he said.  Nuevo Leon is offering as much as 10 million pesos
($788,000) for information on the escaped prisoners, who may
have been members of the Zetas cartel, state officials said
today. The dead appeared to be members of the rival  Gulf Cartel ,
the officials said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
