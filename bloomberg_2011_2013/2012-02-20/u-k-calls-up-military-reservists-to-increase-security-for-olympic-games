The U.K. is calling up 2,100
military reservists to assist with security at the London
 Olympic Games , Defense Secretary Philip Hammond said.  The reserves will supply 15 percent of the 13,500 military
personnel who will work in security roles during the two-week
event, which starts on July 27, Hammond said in a statement to
Parliament today.  “Some reservists will provide a range of specialist
capabilities and expertise while the majority will form part of
the support to Olympic venue security operations,” Hammond
said. The Ministry of Defense “will continue to apply its
policy of intelligent selection, designed to identify, in good
time, volunteer reservists with supportive employers with the
training, skills and availability, in order to minimize the
impact of mobilization upon the individual, their family and
employer.”  The number of reservists being called up is similar to
those mobilized by other countries at previous Olympic Games,
Hammond said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
