Hungary ’s benchmark BUX stock index
rose 1.1 percent to 19,354.75 as of the close in Budapest. The
following were among the most active equities in the Hungarian
market today. Stock symbols follow company names.  OTP Bank Nyrt. (OTP)  , Hungary’s largest lender, advanced
1.5 percent to 4,004 forint after Moody’s Investors Service said
central bank moves last week to boost lending were “credit
positive” for the country’s lenders and as global appetite for
riskier assets rose.  Magyar Telekom Nyrt. (MTEL)  , Hungary’s former phone
monopoly, rose to the highest in more than seven months after
the company and two other incumbents appealed the approval of a
fourth mobile provider’s market entry. The shares rose 1.2
percent to 580 forint, the highest closing level since July 5.  To contact the reporter on this story:
