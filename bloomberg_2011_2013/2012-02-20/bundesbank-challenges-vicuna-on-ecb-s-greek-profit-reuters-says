The Bundesbank disputes the view of
European Central Bank chief counsel Antonio Sainz de Vicuna that
the ECB has a say in how national central banks use profits from
Greek government bond holdings, Reuters reported, citing an
unidentified Bundesbank official.  The ECB has no powers in that area and national central
banks take those decisions independently, Reuters quoted the
official as saying. Earlier, de Vicuna told Handelsblatt
newspaper that there is “the option to mark such profits with
an appropriation, according to which shareholders of national
central banks use the profits” for example “for
 Greece ’s debt consolidation.”  While that would be a political decision, the Eurosystem,
comprising the ECB and the national central banks of the euro
area, “might have to agree to ensure the procedure is in line
with the law,” he said, according to the newspaper.  To contact the reporters on this story:
