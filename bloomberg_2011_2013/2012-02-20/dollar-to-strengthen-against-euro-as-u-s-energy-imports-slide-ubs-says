The dollar will extend its long-term
recovery against the euro as the development of shale-gas
deposits and an increase in oil production cut U.S. energy
imports, according to UBS AG.  “The greenback is also likely to break its negative
relationship with  oil prices  as the U.S. starts to lose its
foreign-energy dependence,” Mansoor Mohi-uddin, chief currency
strategist at UBS in  Singapore , wrote in a research report
received today.  The 120-day correlation coefficient between first-month
U.S. crude futures and IntercontinentalExchange Inc.’s  Dollar
Index (DXY)  was minus 0.57 today, meaning that 57 percent of the move
in oil can be accounted for by changes in the exchange rate of
the U.S. currency. That compares to a record of 63 percent in
November 2008 and a three-year low of 16 percent in April 2011.  The dollar depreciated 1 percent to $1.3266 per euro at
4:12 p.m. London time. That’s still 21 percent stronger since 
reaching a record-low $1.6038 in July 2008. The dollar has 
appreciated 2 percent against the euro in the past three months, 
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The euro gained today even after futures traders increased
their bets that the 17-nation currency will decline against the
dollar. The  difference  in the number of wagers by  hedge funds 
and other large speculators on a drop in the euro compared with
those on a gain was 148,641 on Feb. 14, compared with 140,593 a
week earlier, according to the Washington-based Commodity
Futures Trading Commission.  That’s the first increase since the five-day period ended
Jan. 24, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “The shift in the U.S. energy outlook suggests the
dollar’s long-term recovery against the euro that began in 2008
should continue,” Mohi-uddin wrote.  To contact the reporters on this story:
