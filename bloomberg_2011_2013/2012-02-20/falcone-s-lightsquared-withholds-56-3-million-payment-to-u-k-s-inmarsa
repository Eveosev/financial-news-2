Philip Falcone ’s  LightSquared Inc. (SKYT) ,
the U.S. company struggling to gain approval for a wireless
service, failed to pay British satellite operator  Inmarsat Plc (ISAT) 
$56.3 million under a spectrum-cooperation accord.  Inmarsat issued a notice of default under the companies’
cooperation agreement, giving LightSquared 60 days to remedy the
payment, the London-based satellite operator said in a statement
today. In a separate statement, LightSquared said that Inmarsat
must fulfil certain obligations tied to the deployment of its
terrestrial and satellite network and that “several matters”
need to be resolved. It didn’t give more details.  LightSquared, based in Reston,  Virginia , had been making a
series of scheduled payments to the British company in line with
contractual milestones, Inmarsat said.  Inmarsat, the biggest provider of satellite services to the
maritime industry, is giving LightSquared access to part of its
spectrum. LightSquared, backed by Falcone’s Harbinger Capital
Partners hedge fund, wants to offer high-speed  Internet service 
to as many as 260 million people using airwaves previously
reserved mainly for satellites.  The U.S. Federal Communications Commission said last week
that it would block LightSquared after finding that the wireless
venture would disrupt navigation gear.  The FCC is preparing to withdraw the preliminary approval
it granted last year for the company to build a high-speed
network serving as many as 260 million people, Tammy Sun, an FCC
spokeswoman, said last week. The FCC’s action is a blow to
LightSquared and a setback for  Harbinger Capital Partners (SKYT) , which
has invested $3 billion in the venture.  To contact the reporter on this story:
