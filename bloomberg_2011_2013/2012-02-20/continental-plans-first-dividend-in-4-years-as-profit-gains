Continental AG (CON) ,  Europe ’s second-
biggest car-parts maker, plans to pay its first dividend in four
years after posting a gain in 2011 profit.  Continental today proposed a dividend for last year of 1.50
euros, its first since 2007, the Hanover, Germany-based company
said in a statement today. The figure beat the average estimate
of 55 cents from 23 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Net income more than doubled in 2011 to about 1.25 billion
euros ($1.66 billion) from 576 million euros a year earlier,
according to Bloomberg calculations. Continental said today that
the dividend payout of about 300 million euros amounts to 24
percent of net income.  “It’s a very positive signal and bodes very well in terms
of their confidence and ability to generate cash in 2012,” said
Henning Cosman, a Dusseldorf-based WestLB analyst who has an
“add” rating on the shares. “Taken with their capital
expenditure plans, which are to be 6 percent of sales in 2012,
and their statement regarding deleveraging, and paying out this
dividend, it’s a very positive signal.”  Continental, which will publish full 2011 figures on March
1, reported increasing earnings and revenue last year on demand
for cars in  China  and the U.S., the world’s two-largest auto
markets. Continental expects global automotive sales of 75
million to 78 million vehicles this year.  The shares  rose  as much as 2.51 euros, or 3.7 percent, to
70.82 euros and were up 2.7 percent as of 2:11 p.m. in  Frankfurt 
trading. The stock has gained 46 percent this year, valuing the
company at 14 billion euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
