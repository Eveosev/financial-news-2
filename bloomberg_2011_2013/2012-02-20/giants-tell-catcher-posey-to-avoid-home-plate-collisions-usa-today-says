San Francisco Giants catcher  Buster
Posey  is returning from career-threatening leg and ankle
injuries this season with clear orders from his manager: no
blocking the plate, USA Today said.  Posey, the 2010 National League Rookie of the Year who
helped guide his team to the World Series championship that
year, broke his leg and tore three ankle ligaments in a
collision with  Florida Marlins ’ Scott Cousins last May 25. He
missed the rest of the season.  Giants Manager Bruce Bochy, who has asked  Major League
Baseball  to create rules that will help protect catchers, has
asked Posey to swipe tag an opponent whenever possible,
 according to the newspaper .  Posey, 24, told the newspaper that his ankle is stiff when
he wakes up but adjusts quickly and it hasn’t affected his
ability to play the position. The Giants will play him at first
base sometimes to ease his return from injury. Posey said he
doesn’t want to switch positions permanently, according to  USA
Today . Posey batted .305 with 18 home runs as a rookie.  To contact the reporter on this story:
