(Corrects to clarify Marcegaglia was speaking about jobless
benefits, not overall labor reform.)  Italy’s jobless rate must start
falling before planned changes in  unemployment benefits  are
introduced, said  Emma Marcegaglia , head of employers’ lobby
Confindustria.  She spoke today after meeting with unions and the
government on a planned labor-market overhaul.  To contact the reporter on this story:
