Soybean growers in  Brazil , the
worldâ€™s second-largest producer after the U.S., have harvested
17 percent of the current crop as of Feb. 17, up from 9 percent
a year earlier, researcher AgRural Commodities Agricolas said in
an e-mailed report.  AgRural maintained its forecast for Brazilian soybean
output in the crop year that started Sept. 1 at 70.2 million
metric tons.  The output will be less than 75.3 million tons harvested in
the previous crop year and 73.1 million tons estimated initially
for the current crop before a drought parched fields in southern
Brazil.  To contact the reporter on this story:
