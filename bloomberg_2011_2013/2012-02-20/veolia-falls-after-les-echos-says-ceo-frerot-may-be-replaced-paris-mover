Veolia Environnement SA (VIE) , the world’s
biggest water utility, fell the most in a month as newspaper  Les
Echos  said Chief Executive Officer Antoine Frerot’s predecessor,
 Henri Proglio , is seeking to oust him.  Veolia  declined  as much as 4.8 percent in Paris trading,
the biggest drop since Jan. 18, and declined 3.8 percent to 9.23
euros as of 11:04 a.m.  Proglio, a member of Veolia’s board and CEO of Electricite
de France SA, will try to oust Frerot at a board meeting Feb.
29, the newspaper said, without citing anyone. Former
Environment Minister Jean-Louis Borloo, former  Societe Generale
SA (GLE)  CEO Daniel Bouton, Impala SA CEO Jacques Veyrat, and Caisse
des Depots et Consignations CEO Augustin de Romanet are among
people who may replace Frerot, according to Les Echos.  Frerot said in December that Veolia will sell 5 billion
euros ($6.6 billion) of assets and trim the dividend to cut debt
as it exits the mass-transit business to focus on water, waste
and energy services. The restructuring marked the end of the
global expansion started by Proglio, who became chairman and CEO
of  EDF (EDF)  in 2009 while remaining chairman of Veolia until December
2010.  Veolia spokeswoman Marie-Claire Camus didn’t immediately
respond to messages left on her mobile phone and at her office.  Proglio spent about 4 billion euros on acquisitions in 2007
and 2008, pushing the utility’s operations into 77 countries
from Argentina to South Korea.  Veolia will shrink its “geographic footprint” to about 40
countries in a bid to lower debt to less than 12 billion euros
by the end of 2013, Frerot said in December. Net financial debt
was 15 billion euros at the end of September.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
