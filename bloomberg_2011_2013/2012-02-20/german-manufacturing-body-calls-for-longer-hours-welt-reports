Martin Kannegiesser , president of
the Gesamtmetall German manufacturing employersâ€™ association,
said that more employees should work a 40-hour week,  Welt said ,
citing an interview with the manager.  At the moment, only 18 percent of industrial workers have a
40-hour week, with a 35-hour week being the norm, Kannegiesser
said, according to the German newspaper. Kannegiesser said he
rejects calls from the IG Metall union to give trainees an open-
ended contract, according to Welt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
