excluding South Africa. Stock symbols are in parentheses.  KenolKobil Ltd. (KNOC)  , a Kenyan fuel retailer, advanced
for a third day, rising 1.9 percent to 11 shillings, the highest
close since Aug. 19. Oil rose to a nine-month high in New York
after Iran said it halted some crude exports and investors bet
that fuel demand will increase as Europe moves closer to bailing
out Greece.  Oando Plc (OANDO)  , a Nigerian oil company, rose for a
second day, adding 4.9 percent to 19.25 naira, the highest since
Jan. 27.  Mumias Sugar Co. (MSUG)  , Kenya’s biggest producer of the
sweetener, rallied a second day, advancing 4.4 percent, the
biggest increase since Dec. 6, on speculation the stock was
oversold.  “The stock is oversold because the earnings we saw did not
warrant a such a decline,” Francis Mwangi, head of research at
Nairobi-based Standard Investment Bank Ltd., said in a phone
interview today. “We have a value of 8.3 shillings so to us it
is attractive at the current levels.”  Nigerian Breweries Plc (NB)  , the nation’s biggest brewer
by market capitalization, climbed for a second day, rising 1.3
percent to 99 naira, the highest close since Dec. 29, after FBN
Capital Ltd. initiated coverage citing positive “long-term”
growth potential.  To contact the reporter on this story:
