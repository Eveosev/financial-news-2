Zinc (LMZSDS03)  refiners are lining up supply
before an expected shortfall next year, helping to support
prices that have run up faster than justified by actual demand
for the metal, said Jeremy Goldwyn of Sucden Financial Ltd.  “People are positioning themselves for things getting
tighter,” Goldwyn, the head business development for  Asia , said
in an interview today at the  International Zinc Conference  in
Rancho Mirage,  California . “They don’t want to get caught
without supply.”  Zinc has risen 7.4 percent this year to $1,982 a metric ton
today on the London Metal Exchange. Concern that supplies will
be tight next year may help erode zinc-treatment charges for
smelters, Goldwyn said. The annual processing fee for turning
ore into refined metal is being negotiated at the conference,
and smelters are more likely to offer discounts to secure supply
from miners, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
