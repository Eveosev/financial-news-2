Norddeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale
will get as much as 2 billion euros ($2.65 billion) in
guarantees from its shareholders to help the lender reach a
core-tier 1 capital ratio of about 10 percent,  Handelsblatt 
reported.  The German states of  Lower Saxony  and Saxony-Anhalt will
provide the guarantees, which need to be authorized by European
Union regulators, the newspaper said in a preview of an article
for tomorrowâ€™s edition, citing Lower Saxony Finance Minister
Hartmut Moellring.  Lower Saxony may also convert about 400 million euros of
bonds into core capital and the state of Bremen, another
shareholder, may convert 480 million euros of so-called silent
participations, a form of non-voting equity, in a NordLB unit,
Handelsblatt said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
