The Russian government wants to
involve foreign investors in construction and management of the
Black Sea port of Taman, where several additional terminals are
to be built,  Vedomosti  reported today, citing an unidentified
person familiar with the Transport Ministry’s plans.  The government is holding preliminary negotiations with the
company that manages Rotterdam port and may have talks with
managers of Amsterdam, Hamburg and other ports, the newspaper
said.  The ministry and the ports’ representatives declined to
comment, Vedomosti said.  To contact the reporter on this story: Marina Sysoyeva in Moscow
