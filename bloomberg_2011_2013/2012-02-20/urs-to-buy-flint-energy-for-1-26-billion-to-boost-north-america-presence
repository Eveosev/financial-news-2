URS Corp. (URS) , the San Francisco-based
construction company, agreed to buy  Flint Energy Services Ltd. (FES) 
for C$1.25 billion ($1.26 billion) in cash to add projects
servicing oil and natural gas producers in Western Canada.  Flint shareholders will get C$25 per share, URS said in a
statement, about 67 percent more than Flint’s C$14.90 closing
price in Toronto trading on Feb. 17. URS also plans to assume
C$225 million of Calgary-based Flint’s debt.  Buying Flint adds 10,000 employees serving companies in
the oil and gas producing areas of Western Canada and the
Southwest, Appalachian and Rocky Mountain regions of the U.S.
to URS's 47,000 staff. The deal will raise URS’s 2012 earnings
by 20 cents to 30 cents a share and boost its sales from the oil
and gas industry to about 22 percent of total revenue, according
to the statement.  “Expanding our presence in the oil and gas sector has been
a longstanding strategic priority for URS,” URS Chief Executive
Officer Martin Koffel said in the statement.  The deal values Flint at 14.3 times earnings before
interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, compared with the
average of 9.2 times EBITDA for nine comparable deals, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Flint, which has dropped 23 percent in the past year, last
traded at C$14.90 before markets in the U.S. and  Canada  were
closed. The decline compares with the 7.1 percent decline in the
Morgan Stanley Capital International World Energy Small Cap
index in the past 12 months.  Flint’s operations in Canada accounted for about 80 percent
of sales in the 12 months ended in September. The deal is
expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2012, the
companies said.  Financing in Place  URS, which has financing in place to complete the
transaction, plans to use an existing credit facility and new
debt for permanent financing, according to the statement. Flint
Chief Executive Officer Bill Lingard will continue to manage the
company’s operations as a new division of URS.  “Flint offers a diversified, full cycle of services, has
limited exposure to fixed price contracts and derives its
earnings entirely from operations in the stable North American
region,” said H. Thomas Hicks, URS’s chief financial officer.  The acquisition will generate cost savings of $10 million
to $15 million this year, assuming the deal closes in the second
quarter, and additional future cost reductions, Hicks said.  Morgan Stanley and law firms Osler, Hoskin & Harcourt LLP,
Latham & Watkins LLP, and Cooley LLP are advising URS on the
transaction. Flint is using Credit Suisse Group AG, Bennett
Jones LLP and Hall, Estill, Hardwick, Gable, Golden, & Nelson
