Yemen ’s Interior Minister Abdulqader
Qahtan said he expects some “disruptions” to tomorrow’s
presidential election, which will end the rule of Ali Abdullah Saleh.  “We expect some disruptions, but they will be limited,”
Qahtan said at a press conference in Sana’a, the capital. The
government is taking “all security measures to face any
emergencies,” he said. Yemen’s southern secessionists and
northern Houthi rebels, who don’t recognize the central
government, have called on supporters to boycott the election.  About 12 million Yemenis are eligible to vote in the polls
in which Sale’s vice president for 18 years, Abdurabu Mansur Hadi, is the only candidate. That was a stipulation of the Gulf-
brokered transition accord signed by Saleh in November with
members of the main opposition coalition, under which Hadi took
over as interim leader and Saleh and members of his inner circle
were granted immunity from prosecution.  More than 100,000 troops will provide security at polling
stations across the country, Judge Saba al-Hajji, member of the
Supreme Elections and Referendum Commission, said on Feb. 18.  The elections begin a phase of “trying to stabilize the
situation and put Yemen on a sound footing,” U.S. Ambassador
Gerald Feierstein said in a Feb. 20 interview in Sana’a. “We
don’t think that the two-year period is going to solve all of
Yemen’s problems.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
