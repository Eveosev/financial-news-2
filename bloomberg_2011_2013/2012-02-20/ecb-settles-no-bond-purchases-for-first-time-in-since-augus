The  European Central Bank ’s
government bond buying ground to a halt last week.  The Frankfurt-based ECB said no transactions were settled
in the week through Feb. 17 -- for the first time since August -
- after 59 million euros ($78 million) the previous week. The
ECB will take seven-day term deposits tomorrow to absorb the
219.5 billion euros of liquidity created since its Securities
Markets Program started in May 2010, a practice it employs to
ensure the purchases don’t fuel inflation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
