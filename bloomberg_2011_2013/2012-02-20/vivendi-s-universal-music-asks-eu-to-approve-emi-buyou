Vivendi SA’s (VIV)   Universal Music  Group
sought European Union regulators’ approval to buy EMI Group’s
recorded-music business.  The European Commission set an initial deadline of March 23
to rule on the deal, it said on its website today.  Universal Music “will work closely with the commission”
the company said in an e-mailed statement and is “confident of
securing clearance” for the deal.  Citigroup Inc. (C)  agreed in November to sell EMI Group’s
recorded-music and publishing businesses in separate
transactions for a combined $4.1 billion. Universal will buy
EMI’s record labels, home to Katy Perry and Coldplay, for 1.2
billion pounds ($1.9 billion). A Sony Corp.-led group that
includes billionaire  David Geffen  will pay $2.2 billion for the
publishing unit, according to statements in November.  Warner Music Group, an unsuccessful bidder for EMI, will
lobby in the U.S. and  Europe  against the sale of the company to
Universal, retiring Chairman Edgar Bronfman Jr. has said.  Impala, a group of independent music companies,  said  today
that it will also complain to regulators about the sale because
it may harm competition. The group won a 2006 court ruling
overturning the EU’s approval of Sony and Bertelsmann AG to form
the Sony BMG record label.  Impala said it expects an “outright rejection” of the
merger bid.  To contact the reporters on this story:
