Siemens AG sold a blocking stake in
 OAO Power Machines (SILM) , Russian billionaire Alexey Mordashovâ€™s
turbine producer, for no more than $280 million, below the
market price,  Kommersant  reported today, citing an unidentified
person familiar with the terms of the transaction.  The stake was sold in December to Highstat Ltd., which is
controlled by Mordashov, helping it to consolidate 95.3 percent
of the turbine producer, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story: Marina Sysoyeva in Moscow
