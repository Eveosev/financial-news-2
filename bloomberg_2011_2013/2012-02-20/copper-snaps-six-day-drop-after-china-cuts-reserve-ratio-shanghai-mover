Copper snapped a six-day decline
after  China  reduced  reserve requirements  for banks, fueling
speculation the move may spur economic growth and boost metals
demand. Zinc, lead and nickel also advanced.  Three-month copper increased as much as 2.7 percent, the
most in two weeks, to $8,396.50 a metric ton and traded at
$8,290 by 3:14 p.m. Shanghai time. The contract fell for six
consecutive days since Feb. 10, the longest losing streak since
September. May-delivery copper on the Comex climbed 1.5 percent
to $3.772 a pound.  The proportion of cash that Chinese lenders must set aside
will fall half a percentage point from Feb. 24, the People’s
Bank of China said Feb. 18 on its website. This is the second
reduction in three months as the nation tries to sustain growth
as the housing market cools and  Europe ’s sovereign-debt crisis
weighs on exports.  “While the cut suggests that policy makers may be mildly
concerned over the slowing pace of economic activity, overall,
we think the RRR cut will most likely result in an acceleration
of economic activity and that China’s first-quarter growth is
likely to surprise us on the upside,”  Mark Pervan  and Natalie Robertson, analysts at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group
Ltd., said in a report today.  The May-delivery contract on the Shanghai Futures Exchange
closed 0.7 percent lower at 59,340 yuan ($9,421) a ton. Managed-
money funds held net-long positions, or wagers on rising copper
prices, were 14,817 futures and options contracts as of Feb. 14,
versus 12,298 a week earlier, according to the U.S. Commodity
Futures Trading Commission.  On the LME, aluminum rose 0.7 percent to $2,178 a ton, zinc
gained 2.9 percent to $2,001.25 a ton and lead climbed 1.4
percent to $2,074 a ton. Nickel advanced 1.4 percent to $19,901
a ton and tin rose 1.9 percent to $23,900 a ton.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
