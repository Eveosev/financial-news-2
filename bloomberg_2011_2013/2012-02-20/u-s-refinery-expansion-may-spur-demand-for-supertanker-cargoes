The expansion of Motiva Enterprises
LLC’s refinery could spur increased demand for supertankers
hauling Persian Gulf crude oil westbound, according to a report
by New York-based shipbroker Poten & Partners.  The  Port Arthur , Texas-based refinery is a refining and
marketing joint venture of Saudi Refining Inc., a subsidiary of
Saudi Arabian Oil Co., and Shell Oil Co., a unit of Royal Dutch
Shell Plc. It’s due to increase output by 325,000 barrels a day
during the first quarter, said the shipbroker.  The refinery’s heavy processing units at the expanded
facility are suitable for Saudi Arabian crude grades, said
Poten. Twenty-eight very large crude carriers have been booked
for spot, or single-journey, loadings to the U.S. Gulf from the
Middle East in February. That’s compared with a three-year
average of eleven a month, said Poten.  “The additional call on Arabian Gulf crude oil could
create demand for upwards of 13 to 15 fully-employed VLCCs on an
annual basis,” Poten said in the report.  Freight rates  for VLCCs hauling 2 million barrels of crude
from the  Middle East  to the U.S. gained 6.4 percent since the
start of the year to 34 industry-standard Worldscale points,
according to the London-based Baltic Exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
