Chile’s peso headed for its biggest
gain in two weeks after  China ’s decision to reduce bank reserve
requirements spurred demand for riskier emerging-market assets.  The peso strengthened for a third day, advancing 0.6
percent to 481.66 per  U.S. dollar  at 9:37 a.m. in Santiago, from
484.54 on Feb. 17.  “European stocks are up after China’s decision today and
that is boosting appetite for emerging-market assets,” Matias Madrid, an economist at Banco Penta, said in phone interview.  China’s central bank decided to cut the proportion of cash
that lenders must set aside by half a percentage point beginning
Feb. 24, according to a statement published Feb. 18. European
officials will try to settle remaining disputes today as they
close in on a 130 billion-euro ($171 billion) Greek bailout.  The euro rose as much as 1 percent, European stocks gained
as much as 1.2 percent and copper,  Chile ’s main export,
increased as much as 2.7 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
