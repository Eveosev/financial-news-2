French banks including  BNP Paribas (BNP) 
SA and  Societe Generale SA (GLE)  plan to lend 9 billion euros ($11.9
billion) to 10 billion euros to the country’s municipalities
this year, the French Banking Federation said.  The companies committed “to favor  market access  for local
governments,” the banking association said today in an e-mailed
statement.  Private French lenders pledged new loans to local
governments after state-owned financial firms Caisse des Depots
et Consignations and La Banque Postale on Feb. 10 confirmed
they’ll join forces to create a new municipal bank.  France  salvaged an original rescue deal for Dexia SA’s
French municipal-lending business by agreeing to buy a direct
31.7 stake in a new entity owning Dexia Municipal Agency.
Caisse des Depots will also own 31.7 percent and La Banque
Postale will own 4.9 percent, Dexia, based in Paris and
Brussels, said Feb. 10.  Selling the majority stake in Dexia Municipal Agency will
cost  Dexia SA (DEXB)  about 1 billion euros, the company said. Dexia
Municipal Agency, which had 63.4 billion euros of covered bonds
outstanding at the end of June, will provide funding for the
venture, Dexia said Feb. 10.  Dexia, once the world’s largest municipal lender, is being
broken up after the European debt crisis reduced its ability to
get funding. Belgium’s government took over the company’s
Belgian banking unit in October.  To contact the reporter on this story:
