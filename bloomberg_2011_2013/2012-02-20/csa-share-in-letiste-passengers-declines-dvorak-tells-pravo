Ceske Aerolinie ASâ€™s share of
passengers handled at Letiste Praha AS fell to 36 percent from
45 percent in 2009, Miroslav Dvorak, the chief executive officer
of Cesky Aeroholding, told  Pravo  in an interview.  The share should decline to 25 percent by the end of the
restructuring of the unprofitable state carrier, which is being
put together into a holding with the airport by the government,
Dvorak said in Pravo.  The  Czech Republic  has to avoid what happened in  Hungary ,
where the bankruptcy of state-owned carrier Malev Zrt had a huge
effect on the airport, Dvorak told the newspaper.  The government will have to find a strategic partner for
CSA that would guarantee that it remains a network carrier based
in Prague. A strong partner from  Asia  would be the best option
for the carrier, Dvorak said.  The official tender for CSA will probably start in the
second half the year after CSA is fully integrated into Cesky
Aeroholding, a joint company of CSA and Letiste Praha AS, Dvorak
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
