Bank of Ireland  Chief Executive
Officer Richie Boucher said he expects the lender’s home loan
arrears, which rose to 5.6 percent in December from 3.76
percent a year earlier, to peak in 2012.  “We don’t anticipate they’ve peaked yet,” Boucher told
reporters after the company reported full-year figures. Still,
the bank expects “the ratio of increase will start to ease in
2012 and will peak in 2012.”  The bank has about 1 billion euros of provisions set aside
to cover bad home loans. Bank of Ireland is “highly likely” to
participate in the  European Central Bank ’s second offering of
three-year loans at the end of February, Boucher said. While
Bank of Ireland tapped the ECB for 7.5 billion euros of funds in
the Frankfurt-based bank’s first offering of long-term loans in
December, this reflected the Irish bank switching short-term ECB
loans for three-year facilities, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
