The  New York Yankees  completed a
trade that sent  A.J. Burnett , a starting pitcher who had a 21-26
record the past two seasons, to the Pittsburgh Pirates for two
minor league prospects.  The Yankees said in a  news release  they also gave an
undisclosed amount of cash to the Pirates.  The teams agreed on the deal two days ago, with the Yankees
paying about $18 million of the remaining $31.1 million on
Burnettâ€™s contract,  ESPN said . The trade required approval from
Major League Baseball Commissioner  Bud Selig , it said.  The Yankees signed Burnett to a five-year, $82.5 million
contract before the 2009 season, making him at the time the
fourth-highest-paid pitcher in baseball, according to a USA
Today salary database. In three seasons in  New York , Burnett
went 34-35 with a 4.79 earned run average.  Burnett, 35, went 11-11 with a 5.15 ERA last year, when he
allowed a career-high 31 home runs and set a franchise record
with 25 wild pitches, the most by any major league pitcher since
the start of the 2000 season.  The Yankees get 25-year-old right-handed relief pitcher
Diego Moreno and 20-year-old outfielder Exicardo Cayones from
the Pirates for Burnett.  To contact the reporter on this story:
