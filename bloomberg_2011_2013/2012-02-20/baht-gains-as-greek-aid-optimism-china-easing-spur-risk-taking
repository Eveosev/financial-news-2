Thailand ’s baht rose to a three-
month high as optimism grew that European finance ministers will
approve a second bailout for  Greece  when they meet today and
 China  relaxed lenders’ reserve requirements.  Emerging-market currencies and shares advanced across  Asia 
as investors favored higher-yielding assets. Global funds
purchased $347 million more Thai equities than they sold last
week and bought a net $1.3 billion of government debt, data from
the stock exchange and the Thai Bond Market Association show.  “Risk sentiment has been improving due to some optimism
about Greece, supporting the appreciation in the regional
currencies,” said Minori Uchida, senior analyst in Tokyo at
Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd. “China’s easing is a positive
factor for the global economy. Developments in  Europe  remain key
for the market’s direction.”  The baht added 0.1 percent to 30.75 per dollar as of 3:15
p.m. in Bangkok and touched 30.64 earlier, the strongest level
since Nov. 9, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
currency may trade between 30.50 and 32 before the end of March,
Uchida said.  A report today showed Thailand’s economy contracted 9
percent in the last quarter of 2011 when the nation’s worst
floods in almost 70 years disrupted production. That compares
with the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of a decline of 5
percent and a revised 3.7 percent expansion in the previous
three months.  The yield on the government’s 3.25 percent bonds due June
2017 added three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 3.24
percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
