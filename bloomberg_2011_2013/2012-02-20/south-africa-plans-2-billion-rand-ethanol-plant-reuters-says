South Africa  may invest 2 billion
rand ($261 million) in an ethanol plant that may start operating
in 2014,  Reuters  reported, citing Roak Crew, chief executive
officer of Sugar Beet RSA.  The proposed plant would initially produce 90 million
liters (23.8 million gallons) of ethanol from sugar beet and
sorghum, Reuters reported. Output may be increased to 200
million liters a year, it cited Crew as saying. Sugar Beet RSA
is working on the project with the South African government, it
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
