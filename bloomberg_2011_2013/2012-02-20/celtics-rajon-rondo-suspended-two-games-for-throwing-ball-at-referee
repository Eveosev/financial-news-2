Rajon Rondo of the  Boston Celtics 
was suspended two games by the  National Basketball Association 
for throwing a ball that struck an official in the chest.  The incident occured during the third quarter of the
Celtics’ 96-81 loss in Detroit on Feb. 19, when Rondo was
unhappy that a foul hadn’t been called and flipped the ball to
referee Sean Wright, who had one hand in the air and the other
on his whistle. The ball hit Wright in the chest and Rondo was
ejected from the game.  Rondo’s suspension will begin with tonight’s game against
the Mavericks in  Dallas . The Celtics’ point guard, who is
averaging 14.8 points and is second in the NBA with 9.5 assists
a game, will also sit out a Feb. 22 game against the Oklahoma
City Thunder, the league said in a statement.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
