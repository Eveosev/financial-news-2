German companies are relying on
issuing bonds to help finance investments as banks tighten
lending conditions, Moody’s Investors Service said.  While volumes of issuance are the highest in the
automotive, utilities, manufacturing, chemicals and
telecommunication industries, the number of first-time or
infrequent small to medium-sized issuers has risen in late 2010
and early 2011, Moody’s said in a report today. Bond issuance by
German corporates surged to 73 billion euros ($97 billion) in
2009 and stabilized around 39 billion euros in 2010 and 2011.  “The increase in bond issuance among German corporates is
partly the result of restricted bank lending and their
significant refinancing requirements,” said Matthias Hellstern,
associate managing director at Moody’s in  Frankfurt . “However,
it is also driven by increased capacity in the bond markets,
given the lack of alternatives in an environment of low  interest
rates , weak equity markets and a low prevailing default rate.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
