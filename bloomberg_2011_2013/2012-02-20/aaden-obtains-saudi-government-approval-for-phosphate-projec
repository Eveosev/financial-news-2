Saudi Arabian Mining Co. (MAADEN) , the state-
controlled company known as Maaden, obtained Saudi government
approval to proceed with a 26 billion-riyal ($7 billion)
phosphate project in the countryâ€™s north.  Maaden will build 10 plants with an annual production
capacity for 16 million tons of basic and downstream substances,
including sulphuric acid, phosphoric acid, monocalcium phosphate
and dicalcium phosphate, the Riyadh-based company said in a
statement to the  Saudi bourse  today.  The Ministry of Petroleum & Mineral Resources has allocated
the fuel required for the project, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
