Israeli Finance Minister Yuval
Steinitz has asked  Moody’s Investors Service (MCO)  to consider raising
the country’s A1 credit rating.  Steinitz met with Moody’s economists over the weekend, Boaz
Stembler, a spokesman for the Finance Ministry, said by
telephone today. Israel, which was added to  MSCI Inc. (MSCI) ’s
developed market index in May 2010, is rated at Moody’s fifth-
highest investment grade, the same level as South Korea and the
Czech Republic.  Standard & Poor’s raised the country’s credit rating for
the first time in four years in September, lifting Israel to A+,
in line with Chile and Slovenia. S&P upgraded Israel to its
fifth-highest level in view of its economic growth and expected
production of natural gas by the middle of the decade, which it
expects to increase economic efficiency and strengthen the
nation’s fiscal and external positions.  The country’s economy will grow 3.2 percent in 2012,
according to  Finance Ministry  projections. That’s almost three
times the 1.2 percent average for the Group of 10 countries and
faster than the 2.2 percent expansion in Norway, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
