The cost for European banks to
borrow in dollars declined for the fourth day, according to a
money-market indicator.  The three-month cross-currency  basis swap , the rate banks
pay to convert euro interest payments into dollars, was 69 basis
points below the euro interbank offered rate at 8:30 a.m. in
London from minus 70 on Feb. 17, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. The cost has fallen from 114 below Euribor at the start of
the year, reaching a six-month low of minus 68 on Feb. 13.  The one-year basis swap was little changed at 62 basis
points less than Euribor. A basis point is 0.01 percentage
point.  The Euribor-OIS spread, the difference between Euribor and
overnight indexed swaps, was 69 basis points from minus 68.5 on
Feb. 17, the lowest level in four months, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  Lenders increased  overnight deposits  at the ECB for the
second day on Friday, placing 454 billion euros ($599 billion)
with the Frankfurt-based central bank, up from 417 billion euros
on Feb. 16.  To contact the reporter on this story:
