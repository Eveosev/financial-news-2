Georgian police said they have
detained a suspect who is on the wanted list for plotting to
overthrow the government in 2008.  Valery Ghelbakhiani, a member of parliament and head of
Badri Patarkatsishvili’s presidential campaign, was charged with
plotting a coup and a “terrorist attack” on a government
official, the police said in a statement their website. He
attempted to cross the Armenian-Georgian border when he was
apprehended, according to the statement.  Christian Democrat leader Giorgi Targamadze condemned the
arrest and said at a news conference in Tbilisi today that
Ghelbakhiani was returning to  Georgia  to visit his ill mother in
the hospital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
