STMicroelectronics NV (STM) , Europe’s
largest semiconductor maker, sent Chief Financial Officer Carlo Ferro to help revive joint venture ST-Ericsson and named its
chief accounting officer Mario Arlati to succeed him.  Ferro will become chief operating officer of ST-Ericsson
after serving since May 2003 as CFO at STMicroelectronics, where
he has consolidated silicon fabrication plants and improved the
balance sheet, the Geneva-based manufacturer said today in a
statement.  ST-Ericsson, a joint venture with  Ericsson AB (ERICB)  that makes
chips for mobile handsets, hasn’t been profitable since it was
formed in 2009. The company wasn’t ready for the industry’s
transition to smartphones and has struggled to bring out higher-
powered chipsets as the low-end phone business at customer  Nokia
Oyj (NOK1V)  declined. Its fourth-quarter net loss widened to $231
million from $177 million a year earlier.  Ferro, who has been on the ST-Ericsson board since the
venture’s inception, will “play a fundamental role in the
turnaround” of the partnership, STMicroelectronics Chief
Executive Officer  Carlo Bozotti  said.  The parent companies named Didier Lamouche as ST-Ericsson’s
third chief executive officer on Nov. 28.  To contact the reporter on this story:
