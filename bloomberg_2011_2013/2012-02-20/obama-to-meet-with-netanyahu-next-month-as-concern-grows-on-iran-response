President  Barack Obama  will meet
with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu next month amid
growing concerns over how to respond to Iran’s nuclear program.  Plans for the March 5 meeting were announced by the White
House in a statement today as National Security Adviser Tom Donilon ended a three-day visit to Israel. Donilon met with
Netanyahu, Defense Minister  Ehud Barak  and other Israeli
officials, the White House said.  A visit between Netanyahu and Obama had been expected
during the Israeli prime minister’s visit to  Washington  for the
March 4-6 conference of the American Israel Public Affairs
Committee.  Today’s statement from the White House said that Donilon
and the U.S. delegation discussed “the full range” of mutual
security concerns, and that the visit is “part of the
continuous and intensive dialogue between the  United States  and
Israel and reflects our unshakable commitment to Israel’s
security.”  Army General Martin Dempsey, chairman of the U.S. Joint
Chiefs of Staff, said in a television interview broadcast
yesterday that an Israeli attack on Iranian nuclear facilities
would be “destabilizing,” and that such a move wouldn’t be
“prudent at this point.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
