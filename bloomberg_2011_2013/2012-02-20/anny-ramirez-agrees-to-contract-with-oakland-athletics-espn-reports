Manny Ramirez  agreed to a minor-
league contract with the  Oakland Athletics  and would have to
serve a 50-game drug suspension before he plays this season.  Ramirez, a 12-time All-Star whose 555 home runs rank 14th
in  Major League Baseball  history, will report to spring training
as a non-roster invitee at the end of this week, the team said
yesterday in an e-mailed statement. He could be eligible to play
for the A’s as soon as May 30, his 40th birthday.  Ramirez, who won two World Series titles with the  Boston
Red Sox , will earn no more than $500,000, just over the league
minimum,  MLB.com reported . The Athletics’ player payroll of
$66.5 million was 21st among 30 major-league teams in 2011.  “From an organization standpoint, you always want to put
your team in the best position to win,” A’s pitcher Dallas Braden told the team’s website. “It’s almost two birds with one
stone. We can bring in a guy who can still perform and a guy who
can show these guys how to go about their business at a
perennial All-Star level.”  Ramirez retired from baseball last season rather than face
a second unspecified violation tied to the sport’s anti-doping
rules. He was also suspended 50 games in May 2009 while playing
for the  Los Angeles Dodgers  and said at the time his violation
wasn’t a steroid and didn’t challenge the penalty.  After joining the  Tampa Bay Rays  before the 2011 season,
Ramirez again tested positive for a performance-enhancing drug
during spring training. He said he was retiring on April 8 and
then asked to be reinstated on Dec. 5, when Major League
Baseball said Ramirez would have to serve another 50-game ban
before he could play again.  Over 19 major-league seasons, Ramirez has a .312 batting
average with 1,832 runs batted in. He’s hit 30 or more home runs
in 12 seasons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
