Dogus Holding AS, owner of  Dogus
Otomotiv Servis & Ticaret AS (DOAS) ,  Turkey ’s importer of  Volkswagen AG (VOW) 
cars, will extend its customer lending unit’s loan book to 2
billion liras ($1.1 billion) this year,  Hurriyet  newspaper
reported.  Volkswagen Dogus Finans, an Istanbul-based partnership
between Dogus Holding and Volkswagen Financial Services, grew 63
percent in 2011 to extend 1.85 billion liras of consumer finance
and plans to extend another 37,000 credit contracts this year to
break the 2 billion mark, General Manager Tijen Akdogan was
quoted as saying. The growth is forecast despite an expected
slowdown in the automobile market, he told Hurriyet.  The company is also increasing its insurance business,
which grew 44 percent in 2011, more than twice the sector
average, the newspaper cited Akdogan as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
