Mexico received $19.4 billion of
foreign direct investment in 2011, according to preliminary
figures from the  Economy Ministry , which said the total will
probably be revised higher.  The figure is 4 percent less than the $20.2 billion
registered in 2010, which in turn was revised up from the
preliminary count of $17.7 billion.  “Following historic patterns on revised figures, 2011’s
number will surpass the revised amount of 2010,” the ministry
said in a statement on its website today.  The 2011 investment data remained below the pre-crisis
average of $24.2 billion from 2004 through 2008, due mainly to
slower growth in the U.S., said Alejandro Cervantes, an
economist at Grupo Financiero Banorte-Ixe in Mexico City. A
crackdown on drug cartels, which has cost more than 45,000 lives
since December 2006, may also have damped investment.  “You don’t want to invest in  Mexico  if its main trading
partner hasn’t recovered completely,” Cervantes said. “The
problem of public security may have also limited inflows into
Mexico.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
