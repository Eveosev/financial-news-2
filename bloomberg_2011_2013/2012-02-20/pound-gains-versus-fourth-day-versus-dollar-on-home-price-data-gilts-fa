The pound strengthened for a fourth
day against the dollar after an industry report showed U.K.
house prices increased in February, adding to signs the economy
is recovering.  Sterling appreciated to a three-month high versus the yen
amid speculation minutes of the central bank’s February meeting
to be released this week will show waning support for additional
asset purchases.  Gilts (GUKG10)  dropped for a third day as European
officials moved toward agreement on a 130 billion-euro ($172
billion) financial aid package for  Greece , reducing demand for
safer securities.  “There is a little bit of momentum gathering behind the
notion that there may not be any more quantitative easing,”
said Jane Foley, a senior currency strategist at Rabobank
International in London. “The BOE is on pause in that regard
and that’s giving some support to sterling.”  The pound climbed 0.1 percent to $1.5848 at 5:03 p.m.
London time, after rising 0.5 percent last week. Sterling
advanced 0.1 percent to 126.06 yen after reaching 126.84 yen,
the strongest since Oct. 31. The U.K. currency fell 0.7 percent
to 83.59 pence per euro.  Asking prices for  London  homes rose toward a record in
February, helping push national values up the most in almost a
decade, Rightmove Plc said. Prices in England and  Wales  climbed
4.1 percent on the month, the most since April 2002. A separate
report from the  Council of Mortgage Lenders  showed U.K. gross
mortgage lending fell 14 percent in January from December. The
figure is still up 10 percent from a year earlier.  Weekly Gain  The pound gained 0.2 percent over the past week, according
to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes, which track 10
developed-nation currencies. The currency has weakened 1.1
percent this year.  Bank of England  officials increased their target for bond
purchases by 50 billion pounds to 325 billion pounds on Feb. 9.
The nine-member Monetary Policy Committee also held its key
 interest rate  at a record-low 0.5 percent.  The central bank will release minutes of this month’s
meeting on Feb. 22. Policy makers voted unanimously to raise the
asset purchase target to 275 billion pounds from 200 billion
pounds in October.  Greece Bailout  Gilts extended last week’s decline as European finance
ministers weighed the terms of new loans to Greece and a
possible contribution by central banks at a meeting today in
Brussels. They also aim to start a bond exchange with private
investors meant to stave off a Greek bankruptcy next month.  The  yield  on the 10-year gilt climbed four basis points to
2.23 percent. The 3.75 percent bond due in September 2021 fell
0.375, or 3.75 pounds per 1,000-pound face amount, to 113.04.  Gilts have handed investors a 2.1 percent loss this year,
according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. German  government
bonds  dropped 0.5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
