     Feb. 20 (Bloomberg) --　Japanese  shares  rose for a second
day after  China  eased lending curbs to shore up economic growth
and the yen touched a six-month low against the dollar.  Hitachi Construction Machinery Co. (6305) , which gets 22 percent
of its sales in China, gained 4.6 percent.  Sony Corp. (6758) ,  Japan ’s
No. 1 exporter of consumer electronics, rose 3.6 percent.  JFE
Holdings Inc. (5411)  led steel makers higher after Credit Suisse Group
AG raised their stock price estimates. Universal Entertainment
Corp. dropped 21 percent after Wynn Resorts Ltd. sold its stake
in the pachinko-machine maker at a discount.  The  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  rose 1.1 percent to 9,485.09
as of 3 p.m. in Tokyo, its highest close since Aug. 4. Trading
volume on the gauge was 42 percent above the 100-day average.
The broader Topix Index gained 1.1 percent to 819.03.  “Developing nations are following a global trend of
monetary easing, which is very positive,” said Shintaro Takeuchi, portfolio investment group manager at Tokio Marine &
Nichido Fire Insurance Co., which oversees $109 billion in
assets. “Expectations are mounting that the yen’s upward trend
is coming to an end.”  Chinese Reserve Ratios  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  rose 0.5 percent
today after Prime Minister  Lucas Papademos  said  Greece  had found
the additional spending cuts needed to secure a debt bailout.
The gauge added 0.2 percent in  New York  on Feb. 17 as jobless
claims, manufacturing and housing data beat estimates.  The proportion of cash that Chinese lenders must set aside
will drop half a percentage point from Feb. 24, freeing up more
capital for lending, the central bank said on Feb. 18. Standard
Chartered Plc expects at least three more reductions this year,
while HSBC Holdings Plc predicts a minimum of two.  “It’s a bold move and one aimed at maintaining growth
rates, which will provide support for equity investors,” said
 Tim Schroeders , who helps manage $1 billion in equities at
Pengana Capital Ltd. in Melbourne. “The timing is probably just
ahead of China committing to European bailout funds.”  Finance Minister  Jun Azumi  said Japan will work with China
to help  Europe  through the  International Monetary Fund . More
funding is needed to contain the debt crisis, even as Greece
shows some improvement in addressing its financial woes, Azumi
told reporters in Beijing yesterday after meeting Chinese Vice
Premier  Wang Qishan .  Machinery Stocks Advance  Hitachi Construction added 4.6 percent to 1,694 yen, and
 Komatsu Ltd. (6301) , Japan’s largest construction machinery maker, rose
3 percent to 2,423 yen. The company counts China as its biggest
market.  Exporters gained as the yen touched 79.89 against the
dollar today, the lowest since Aug. 4. A weaker yen boosts
overseas income at Japanese companies.  Sony advanced 3.6 percent to 1,681 yen.  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) ,
Asia’s biggest carmaker, rose 2 percent to 3,350 yen.  Steel and iron makers  rose  the most among the Topix’s 33
industry groups after Credit Suisse said export prices for the
material will recover as costs fall.  JFE jumped 8.4 percent to 1,712 yen.  Nippon Steel Corp. (5401) 
gained 5.2 percent to 224 yen, while  Sumitomo Metal Industries

leading container carrier, said it will cut capacity in Asia-
Europe routes to shore up profit.  Universal Entertainment slumped by its daily limit of 400
yen, or 21 percent, to 1,516 yen after casino-operator Wynn

accused Kazuo Okada, chairman of the pachinko company, of making
improper payments to Philippine regulators.  The Nikkei 225 Volatility Index rose 7.2 percent to 23.71,
indicating traders expect a swing of about 6.8 percent on the
benchmark gauge over the next 30 days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
