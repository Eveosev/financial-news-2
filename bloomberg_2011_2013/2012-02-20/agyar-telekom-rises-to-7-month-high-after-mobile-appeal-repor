Magyar Telekom Nyrt. (MTEL) ,  Hungary ’s
former phone monopoly, rose to the highest in more than seven
months after incumbents appealed the approval of a fourth mobile
provider’s market entry.  The shares rose as much as 3.1 percent and added 1.2
percent to 580 forint by the end of trading in Budapest, the
highest level since July 5.  The Hungarian telecommunications authority said its
decision to award a fourth mobile frequency to a group of state-
owned companies brought an appeal from the three incumbent
mobile-service providers, which include Magyar Telekom. The
authority, known as NMHH, has 45 days to carry out a second-
round evaluation and issue a ruling, it said in an e-mailed
statement today.  “This news should give further momentum to Magyar Telekom
shares today, as the fourth provider can start building out the
network only with a 45 day delay even if the final decision is
positive, for the consortium,” Gergely Palffy, a Budapest-based
equities analyst at KBC Groep NV’s broker unit, wrote in a
research report today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
