(Corrects typographical error in headline.)  GDF Suez (GSZ)  SA’s French distribution
system, GRTgaz, will spend 1.6 billion euros ($2.1 billion)
installing new gas pipelines in the northern port of Dunkirk and
in southeast France,  Les Echos  reported today, citing the unit’s
project director.  The first project, to cost 1.1 billion euros, will double
pipeline capacity by 2015 and begins next month in Dunkirk; the
second, costing 500 million euros, starts in 2015 and is to
install a 200-kilometer pipeline linking the Drome region to the
Mediterranean, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
