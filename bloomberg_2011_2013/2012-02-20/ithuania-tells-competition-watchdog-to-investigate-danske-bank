The Lithuanian central bank asked
the Competition Council to investigate the Lithuanian unit of
 Danske Bank A/S (DANSKE)  over allegations of unfair advertising.  The central bank also told Danske to cease advertising that
suggested deposit rates of as much as 25 percent without
disclosing additional information about mandatory insurance
payments that come with the plan, the Vilnius-based  Lietuvos
Bankas  said in an e-mailed statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
