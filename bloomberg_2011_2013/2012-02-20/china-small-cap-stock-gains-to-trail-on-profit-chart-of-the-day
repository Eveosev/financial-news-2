China ’s small-company stocks may lag
behind gains of larger counterparts for the rest of 2012 after
the best start in three years on slower economic and earnings
growth, according to ICBC Credit Suisse Asset Management Co.  The CHART OF THE DAY shows the ratio for estimated price-
to-earnings of the CSI Smallcap 500 Index and the CSI 300 Index
of the biggest companies on China’s exchanges dropped to 1.39 on
Jan. 27, the lowest since October 2009, according to weekly data
compiled by Bloomberg. The multiple was at a record high of 2.2
in December 2010. The small-caps gauge trades at 15.3 times
estimated profit, versus 10.2 for the measure of large stocks.  “Smallcaps will underperform” and valuations will fall
further, said Hao Kang, a Beijing-based  fund manager  at ICBC
Credit Suisse, a venture between the largest lender in China and
Switzerland’s second-biggest bank that oversees about $8.4
billion. “High valuations and corporate governance issues will
weigh on smallcaps. I don’t see many investment opportunities.”  Growth in  earnings per-share  for companies in the small-
caps gauge may slow to 23 percent this year from 60 percent in
2011, according to analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Li
Jun , a strategist at Central China Securities Co. in Shanghai,
said profit growth for smallcaps may be less than 10 percent in
2012. The rate for CSI 300 companies is likely to cool to 20
percent from 25 percent, data show. Retailer Shanghai Friendship
Group Inc. has the largest market value in the small-caps gauge
at 21.6 billion yuan ($3.4 billion), compared with 1.87 trillion
yuan for PetroChina Co. in the CSI 300.  The  CSI Smallcap 500 (SH000905)  has rebounded 9.4 percent this year
after tumbling 34 percent in 2011. The central bank last year
raised  interest rates  and  reserve requirements  to combat
inflation, causing a credit crunch for small companies. The CSI
300 has gained 8.3 percent in 2012 after slumping 25 percent
last year. The central bank announced on Feb. 18 a reserve ratio
cut for the second time in three months to boost growth.  Premier  Wen Jiabao  may announce a 7 percent or 7.5 percent
growth target at this year’s National People’s Congress meetings
that convene in March, Fan Jianping, chief economist at the
government-run State Information Center said in a Feb. 16
interview. China’s gross domestic product expansion has averaged
10 percent per year in the past three decades.  --Zhang Shidong. Editors: Allen Wan, Darren Boey  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
