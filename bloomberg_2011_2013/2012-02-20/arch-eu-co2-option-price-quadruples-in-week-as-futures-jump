The March 2012 European Union
carbon-dioxide permit  call option  with a 10-euro ($13.19) a
metric ton strike price has quadrupled in a week as futures
contracts jumped.  The price of the March 2012 option surged to 55 euro cents
a ton on Feb. 17, according to Bloomberg options data from the
ICE Futures Europe exchange in London, the world’s biggest for
carbon trading. That’s more than four times the record low of 13
cents a ton reached Feb. 13. There were 500,000 tons traded on
that day, ICE data show.  Some traders may have been seeking protection against price
rises as carbon jumped 17 percent last week, the most since May
2006. Carbon is rising on speculation that EU regulators will
step into the market to at least temporarily limit supply.  Call options give the buyer the right to purchase at a set
level. Put options give the buyer the right to sell at a certain
price.  December carbon futures fell 3.5 percent today to 8.95
euros a ton as of 8:47 a.m. local time, after reaching a record
low of 6.38 euros on Jan. 4.  To contact the reporter on this story:
