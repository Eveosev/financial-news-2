The following companies are having
unusual price changes in Bogota trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of 10:25 a.m. New York time.  The  IGBC Index (IGBC)  gained 0.3 percent to 14,620.45 while the
Colcap Index rose 0.3 percent to 1,716.01.  Almacenes Exito SA (EXITO)  , Colombia’s biggest publicly
traded retailer, rose 0.8 percent to 25,200 pesos, poised for
its biggest advance in two weeks. Colombia concluded the first
round of negotiations for an accord to deepen trade with Uruguay
last week, and a second round will take place in April,
according to a Feb. 17 statement from Colombia’s trade ministry.  Exito last year agreed to purchase majority stakes in
Uruguayan retailers Disco and Devoto for $746 million from
French supermarket operator Casino Guichard-Perrachon SA .  Avianca Taca Holding SA (PFAVTA)  (PFAVTA CB), the owner of
 Colombia ’s largest airline, rose 0.2 percent to 4,405 pesos.  Operations have returned to normal after the carrier had to
cancel flights over four days because of labor actions by air-
traffic controllers seeking better working conditions. The
company said in an e-mailed statement that the government and
the controllers reached an agreement last night.  To contact the reporter on this story:
