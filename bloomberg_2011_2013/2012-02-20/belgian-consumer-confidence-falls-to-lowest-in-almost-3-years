Belgian  consumer confidence  fell to
the lowest in almost three years in February amid pessimism on
the outlook for employment and the economy, the National Bank of
 Belgium  said.  The consumer sentiment index for Belgium, the euro-region’s
sixth-largest economy, fell to minus 20 from minus 16 in
January, the Brussels-based central bank said today in an e-
mailed statement. That’s the lowest since April 2009.  “Households are expecting a deterioration in their
finances,” the bank said. “In contrast, their future saving
capacity is estimated to be a little more favorable than a month
ago.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
