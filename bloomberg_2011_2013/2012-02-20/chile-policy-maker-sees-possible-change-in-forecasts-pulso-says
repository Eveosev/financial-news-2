Chile ’s central bank sees improved
optimism in financial markets that may lead policy makers to
make “marginal” changes to risk forecasts that were last
published in December, newspaper  Pulso  said, citing bank board
member Enrique Marshall.  Chile’s economic activity and demand have grown
“slightly” faster than the central bank forecast in December,
Marshall said, according to the Santiago-based financial
newspaper.  Inflation in the past two months reflected some one-time
factors and will ease as Chile’s economy moderates, he said in
the interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
