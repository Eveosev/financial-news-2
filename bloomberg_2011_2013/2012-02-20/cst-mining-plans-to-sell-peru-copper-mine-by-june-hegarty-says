CST Mining Group Ltd. (985) , a Hong Kong-
listed copper producer, said it plans to dispose of its stake in
the Mina Justa project in Peru before June after appointing
Morgan Stanley as financial adviser for the sale last month.  “We’ll try to do it as soon as we can,” Owen Hegarty, the
company’s vice chairman, said by phone from Melbourne. “It’s
pretty much in the stage of people doing their evaluations.”  Glencore International Plc terminated a $475 million
proposal in November to buy the 70 percent stake in the project
as it couldn’t reach an agreement with CST Mining’s joint
venture partner Marcobre S.A.C. CST Mining has a “good number”
of interested parties, Hegarty said.  The offer by Glencore is a price “benchmark” for
interested parties, he said.  The shares have fallen 54 percent in the past year,
compared with an 8.8 percent drop in the benchmark  Hang Seng
Index . CST gained 5.8 percent to close at 11  Hong Kong  cents
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
