Profits from making naphtha in  Asia 
dropped after crude surged to the highest price in nine months.
Refining losses from  fuel oil  were at the widest since Feb. 1.  Light Distillates  Japan  naphtha  swaps for March climbed $9, or 0.9 percent,
to $1,040.50 a metric ton at 10:59 a.m. Singapore time,
according to data from PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a broker.  The benchmark naphtha’s premium to London-traded Brent
crude futures rose to $128.76 a ton from $130.58 on Feb. 17.
This crack spread gained 3.3 percent last week, the second
consecutive weekly increase.  Naphtha swaps advanced after crude surged to the highest
price in nine months as Iran said it was halting oil exports to
French and U.K. companies.  Oil for March delivery rose as much as 1.9 percent to
$105.21 a barrel in electronic trade on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  today, the highest intraday price since May 5.  Fuel Oil  Singapore fuel oil’s  discount  to Dubai crude, a measure of
refining losses from the fuel in Asia, widened 58 cents, or 12
percent, to $5.30 a barrel, PVM data showed. The crack spread is
at the widest since Dec. 15.  High-sulfur  fuel oil  swaps for March rose $5.75, or 0.8
percent, to $732.75 a ton, PVM said.  The premium of  180-centistoke (N6SHS180)  fuel oil to  380-centistoke (N6SHS380) 
grade was unchanged at $10 a ton. This  viscosity spread  has
narrowed $1.75 from a week earlier, signaling that prices of
marine fuel grades have risen more than power generation grades.  Middle Distillates  Singapore gasoil’s  premium  to Dubai crude narrowed 5.73
percent last week to $16.93 a barrel, the biggest decline since
Nov. 25, PVM data showed.  Gasoil (PVMPSO1M) , or diesel, swaps for March rose 90 cents, or 0.7
percent, to $133.50 a barrel on Feb. 17, PVM data showed.  Jet fuel  traded at a discount of 40 cents below gasoil on
Feb. 17. This  discount  was at $1.05 on Jan. 31, the widest
negative spread in more than three and a half years, signaling
it is unprofitable to produce  aviation fuel  over diesel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
