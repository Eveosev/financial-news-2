Sugar from Brazil,  Thailand  and
Central America may be delivered against March raw-sugar futures
traded in New York and expiring at the end of the month, brokers
said.  Central American sweetener would cover demand from the
U.S.,  Naim Beydoun , a broker at Swiss Sugar Brokers in Rolle,
Switzerland, said in a report e-mailed yesterday. Sugar from
Thailand, the world’s second-biggest exporter, would be used to
meet sales to the  Far East , he said.  As much as 200,000 metric tons of Brazilian sweetener may
be delivered, Luiz Carlos dos Santos Jr., head of sugar
brokerage and operations at SA Commodities in Santos, Brazil,
wrote in a report dated Feb. 17. The country is the world’s
biggest producer and exporter.  Deliveries of sugar from  Brazil  against the expiring ICE
Futures U.S. contract may exceed the forecast if the price and
the price gap between March and May futures remains at current
levels, SA Commodities said.  Raw sugar for March delivery was 0.85 cent a pound more
expensive than May-delivery sweetener when trading ended on Feb.
17, data on Bloomberg show. ICE is closed today for the
Presidents’ Day holiday.  March raw-sugar futures expire on Feb. 29.  To contact the reporter on this story:
