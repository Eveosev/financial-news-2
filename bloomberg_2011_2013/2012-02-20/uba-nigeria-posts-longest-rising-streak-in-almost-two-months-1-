United Bank for Africa Plc , a
Nigerian lender with operations in 19 countries, gained for a
fourth day, its longest winning streak since December.  The stock jumped 4.8 percent to 1.98 naira by the 2:30 p.m.
close in Lagos, the commercial capital, trimming its loss this
year to 23.5 percent compared with a decline of 1.4 percent in
the Nigerian Stock Exchange All-Share Index.  United Bank  is
trading with price-to-book value of 0.45, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. A P/B ratio below 1 signals a cheaper
valuation.  United Bank’s price fell “significantly” following the
profit warning by the bank, Abiola Rasaq, a Lagos-based analyst
at Vetiva, said by phone today.  The bank expects a loss in 2011, “driven principally by
one-off write-offs against earnings, including those arising
from the transfer of loans to the Asset Management Company of
 Nigeria ,” it said Feb. 8, leading to a sell-off in the
company’s stock. Management does not anticipate similar write-
offs in 2012 and pretax profit is forecast at 15 billion naira
in the first quarter, the company said.  Vetiva’s target price for this year is 5.85 naira, with a
“neutral” rating. The company does not expect the bank’s
return-on-equity to catch up with its peers until 2014, “when
the full earnings accretion from the African expansion kicks
in,” Rasaq said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
