Republican presidential candidate
 Rick Santorum , who has emerged as the chief rival to  Mitt Romney , more than doubled his fundraising after winning the Iowa
caucuses last month.  Romney still raised more money than all of his Republican
challengers and continued to receive the most financial support
from  Wall Street .  Meanwhile, former U.S. House Speaker  Newt Gingrich , winner
of the South Carolina primary on Jan. 21, ended the January
filing period with almost as much debt as he had cash in
the bank.  A former U.S. senator from  Pennsylvania , Santorum raised
$4.5 million in January after collecting $2.2 million in the
entire last year, Federal Election Commission financial
disclosure reports posted yesterday show. He took in 57 percent
of his money last month in donations of $200 or less, according
to FEC records. Santorum, who won the Iowa caucuses Jan. 3 and
the Feb. 7 contests in Missouri, Colorado and Minnesota,
reported having $1.5 million in the bank at the start of
February, FEC records show.  Romney brought in more than $6.5 million last month,
according to his disclosure report. Romney, who has won four
primary contests including  Florida , has raised a total of $63.7
million and had a campaign bank account balance of $7.7 million
on Jan. 31.  Wall Street Donations  He raised $36,996 last month from employees of New York-
based  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) , and $33,013 from employees of  Bank
of America Corp. (BAC) , based in Charlotte,  North Carolina . Romney, a
co-founder of the Boston-based private-equity firm Bain Capital
LLC, has raised more money from employees of Wall Street firms
and commercial banks than any other 2012 presidential candidate,
according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a Washington-
based research group that tracks political giving.  Donations of $200 or less accounted for 18 percent of his
receipts last month, according to his FEC report.  Unlike previous elections, none of the Republican
candidates have publicly identified those who are raising money
for their campaigns, except the registered lobbyists they are
required by law to report to the FEC.  Romney was the only candidate to disclose any so-called
bundlers last month, saying that three registered lobbyists who
have been raising money for his campaign brought in an
additional $163,645. Wayne Berman, whose clients include
 Blackstone Group LP (BX) , based in  New York , and San Francisco-based
 Visa Inc. (V) , raised $79,050 of that total.  Gingrich’s Total  Gingrich’s South Carolina victory helped generate $5.6
million in donations last month. Through Jan. 31, he raised a
total of $18.3 million for his campaign.  He reported $1.8 million in the bank at the end of January
-- with $1.7 million in debts, including $115,503 for web ads
and $7,500 to his daughter Jackie Cushman’s consulting firm.  Gingrich also relied on small donations; 45 percent of his
money last month was in amount of $200 or less.  U.S. Representative Ron Paul of Texas reported taking in
$4.5 million in January, with 47 percent in amounts of $200 or
less, and entering February with $1.6 million in the bank. Paul
has raised $31 million through Jan. 31, second only to Romney.
The campaign said on its website today that it has also raised
more than $1.9 million so far this month.  The Republicans trail President Barack Obama in fundraising
as the Democratic incumbent takes in money for both the primary
campaign and the general election. Through Jan. 31, Obama raised
$140 million, including $12 million last month, and had $76
million in the bank.  Perry, Huntsman  Texas  Governor Rick Perry, who withdrew from the Republican
presidential race Jan. 19 and endorsed Gingrich, reported that
he had $860,168 in the bank at the end of January. He has asked
the FEC for permission to convert his campaign account to a
political action committee. He raised $388,531 last month,
bringing his total to $20.5 million.  Jon Huntsman, the former Utah governor and U.S. ambassador
to  China , lent his campaign another $50,000 on Jan. 4, 12 days
before dropping out of the presidential race and endorsing
Romney. He lent his campaign a total of $2.6 million while
raising $3.8 million. He also reported other campaign debts of
$2.6 million.  Former Louisiana Governor Buddy Roemer, the only Republican
candidate seeking federal funds to help finance his campaign,
raised $48,807, bringing his total to $393,839, including a
$24,900 personal loan. He had $7,126 in the bank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
