British boxing officials will hold a
hearing into defeated heavyweight Dereck Chisora’s brawl with
former World Boxing Association champion  David Haye  after a
fight in  Germany .  Chisora was released without being charged by police in
Munich after threatening Haye during a televised post-fight news
conference, the British Broadcasting Corp.  reported . The  British
Boxing Board of Control  will hold a hearing March 14 into
Chisora’s action, it said today in an e-mailed statement. Haye,
who is no longer licensed to fight, isn’t under the panel’s
jurisdiction after retiring, it said earlier.  Chisora, who lost a World Boxing Council title fight
against Vitali Klitschko two days ago, exchanged punches with
Haye, who had been working for a television station. Police are
searching for Haye to question him about the incident, the BBC
added.  Chisora accused Haye of hitting him with a glass bottle
before repeatedly saying that he would shoot the former World
Boxing Association heavyweight champion, the  BBC  reported.
Haye’s manager, Adam Booth, suffered cuts to his face in the
melee, the BBC said.  Frank Warren, Chisora’s promoter, told BBC Radio 5 Live
yesterday that the clash was “unacceptable” and that he
expects British boxing officials to “take appropriate action.”  Ukraine’s Klitschko  retained  his WBC title in a unanimous
points decision over Chisora at Munich’s Olympic hall.  To contact the reporter on this story:
