Platts, the energy news and pricing
unit of McGraw-Hill Cos., said it is considering moving its
price assessment for Dated Brent to a month-ahead basis.  The trading-date period already moved to a 10-to-25 day
forward  assessment  from 10 to 21 days as of Jan. 6. A further
lengthening to 30 days or one month may occur by about January
2015, Platts Global Director of Markets and Pricing Jorge Montepeque said today.  The benchmark “needs maintenance” as market conditions
adjust and because European consumers sometimes use oils from
further away with a longer shipping time, he said at the Platts
London Oil Forum, part of the International Petroleum Week of
conferences and meetings.  The move may increase the number of cargoes deliverable
against Dated Brent and boost liquidity, or trading activity.
Dated Brent, the benchmark for more than half of the world’s
oil, is priced on the basis of a basket of Brent, Forties,
Oseberg and Ekofisk grades, known as BFOE.  Platts will seek feedback from  oil companies  and market
participants for any of its proposed changes to Dated Brent,
possibly including adding  Denmark ’s DUC and Norway’s Troll
crudes to the assessment, Montepeque said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
