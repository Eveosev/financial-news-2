The  Bank of Thailand  said it is
“closely monitoring” the impact of a global watchdog’s
decision to label the country as uncooperative in efforts to
combat  money laundering  and terrorism financing.  The central bank will seek details from commercial lenders
to gauge whether the move has affected their business, Assistant
Governor Pongpen Ruengvirayudh said in Bangkok today.  The Financial Action Task Force, a Paris-based
intergovernmental organization, added  Thailand  to a list of
countries including Cuba, Myanmar,  Indonesia  and Pakistan that
have failed to make “sufficient progress” in introducing
regulations to curb money laundering and the financing of
terrorism, it said in a Feb. 16 statement.  Foreign investors “should see this as a short-term
factor,” Pongpen said.  Deputy Governor Krirk Vanikkul said Thailand will need to
introduce procedures to identify and freeze terrorist assets
before being removed from the watchdog’s “dark gray list” of
countries. Member countries may ask their financial institutions
to be more careful in dealing with Thai banks, Krirk said today.  Deputy Prime Minister Chalerm Yoobamrung said today the
government doesn’t see any urgency in issuing new laws.  To contact the reporter on this story:
