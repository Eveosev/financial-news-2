Saudi Arabia  may raise prices next
year for ethane and methane gas used to produce petrochemicals,
according to  Al Rajhi Capital , the investment arm of the
kingdom’s biggest bank by market value.  Clients such as  Saudi Basic Industries Corp. (SABIC) , the world’s
largest petrochemical maker, may pay $1.25 per million British
thermal units for the feedstocks starting in 2013, compared with
the current price of 75 cents per million Btu, Al Rajhi Capital
said in a report today.  The Saudi oil ministry decided to keep gas prices unchanged
this year for petrochemical manufacturers at 75 cents per
million Btu and has not indicated when it may adjust prices,
Jeddah-based NCB Capital said in a report on January 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
