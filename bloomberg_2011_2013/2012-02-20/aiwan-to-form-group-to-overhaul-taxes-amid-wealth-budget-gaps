Taiwan said it will establish a
taskforce to overhaul the island’s tax system as the government
strives to narrow a wealth gap and tackle the  budget deficit .  “The move is to fulfill President Ma’s promise of creating
a fair and just society and to ensure a sound fiscal condition,”
Finance Minister Christina Liu said at a briefing in Taipei
today. The group will be formed by mid-March and the ministry
aims to start implementing changes by the middle of September,
she said.  President Ma Ying-jeou, who was elected for a second term
last month, pledged during campaigning to narrow disparities in
wealth that have stirred discontent. The 20-person taskforce
will be made up of government officials, businessmen and
academics, Liu said.  Taiwan’s export-led economy contracted for the second
straight quarter in the three months through December, shrinking
0.25 percent from the third quarter and tipping the island into
a recession as  Europe ’s debt crisis curbed demand.  To contact the reporters on this story:
