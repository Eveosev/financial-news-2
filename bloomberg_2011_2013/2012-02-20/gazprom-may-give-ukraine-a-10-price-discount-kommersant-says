Russia’s  OAO Gazprom (GAZP)  may give
Ukraine a 10 percent discount on the price of natural gas,
 Kommersant-Ukraine  reported, citing a person familiar with the
matter who didn’t want to be identified.  Gazprom expects in exchange that Ukraine won’t request any
further price cut and will purchase 33 billion cubic meters of
gas this year, in line with the existing contract, the Kiev-
based newspaper reported.  Talks between Russia and Ukraine will probably resume this
week, according to Kommersant.  To contact the reporter on this story:
