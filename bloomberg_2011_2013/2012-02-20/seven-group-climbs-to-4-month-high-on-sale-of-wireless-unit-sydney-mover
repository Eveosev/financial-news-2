Seven Group Holdings Ltd. (SVW) , the media
investment company controlled by billionaire  Kerry Stokes , rose
to a four-month high in Sydney after agreeing to sell its
Vividwireless Internet unit for A$230 million ($248 million).  Seven Group climbed 5.7 percent to A$8.56 at the close of
trading in Sydney, the highest level since Oct. 11.  Optus (ST) , a unit of Singapore Telecommunications Ltd., agreed
to buy Vivid to gain Australian wireless spectrum for faster
mobile services and help it compete with larger rival  Telstra
Corp. (TLS)  Seven expanded its Internet products in 2007 when it
agreed to buy Unwired Group for A$114 million.  “This sale recognizes value for the investment we’ve made
in Vividwireless,” Seven Group’s Chief Executive Officer Peter Gammell said in a statement today.  Seven Group’s other investments include about 32 percent of
 Seven West Media Ltd (SWM) ., owner of Australia’s most-watched
television broadcaster, and a 24 percent stake in  Consolidated
Media Holdings Ltd. (CMJ)   The company also owns  WesTrac Group , a Caterpillar Inc.
dealer in Australia and northern China.  To contact the reporter on this story:
