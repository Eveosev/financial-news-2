The  European Central Bank  may
introduce an appropriation for profit it makes from Greek bond
purchases, Antonio Sainz de Vicuna, director general of legal
services, told  Germany ’s  Handelsblatt  newspaper in an interview.  “There is the option to mark such profits with an
appropriation, according to which shareholders of national
central banks use the profits, for example, via the EFSF for
 Greece ’s debt consolidation,” Sainz de Vicuna was quoted as
saying. “That’s a political decision but the Eurosystem might
have to agree so ensure the procedure is in line with the law.”  Profit will be distributed once the bonds, which have
maturities of as long as 15 years, have been redeemed, said
Sainz de Vicuna, who is the Spanish candidate to succeed Jose Manuel Gonzalez-Paramo on the ECB’s Executive Board.  To contact the reporter on this story:
