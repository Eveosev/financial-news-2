South Korea  held live-fire naval
drills in disputed waters as a North Korean threat of
“merciless punishment” prompted the evacuation of thousands of
island residents nearby.  The artillery exercises began around 10 a.m. today and
lasted about two hours, said a South Korean Defense Ministry
official who asked not to be identified in line with ministry
policy. About 8,700 residents of five islands near the drills
were sent to 110 evacuation centers until noon, said Kim Hyung
Kook, a local civil defense bureau official.  North Korea ’s warning of “merciless retaliatory strikes”
if the drill trespassed into its territory raised concerns of
the repeat of a deadly attack on a South Korean island in 2010
that killed four people. The totalitarian state has maintained
hostile rhetoric under new leader Kim Jong Un, and the two sides
are separated by the world’s most fortified land border.  Defense-related shares rose on the Korea Exchange with
 Speco Co. (013810) , which produces equipment for naval ships, rose 5.1
percent to 2,690 won at 12:21 p.m. in Seoul.  Victek Co. (065450) , a
manufacturer of electronic warfare products, rose 6.7 percent to
1,920 won, while  Huneed Technologies (005870) , which produces military
communications equipment, rose 4.9 percent.  No abnormal North Korean military movements were spotted
during the South Korean exercises in the West Sea, the defense
ministry official said.  Flash Point  South Korea regularly holds such drills in the waters,
which the North claims as its territory and have been a flash-
point in inter-Korean violence. Today’s exercise was the first
such since Kim Jong Un took power after the death of his father,
 Kim Jong Il , in December. The younger Kim has moved to fortify
support the country’s 1.2 million-strong army via publicized
inspections of military units, including those operating near
the West Sea.  “These drills are regularly conducted as part of our
national security measures, and it is not appropriate for North
Korea to say this and that about what’s being held in our
territorial waters,” Unification Ministry spokesman Kim Hyung
Suk told reporters today in Seoul.  North Korea is “fully prepared for both a local and total
war” and threatened “merciless retaliatory strikes” if the
drill trespassed its territorial waters, according to a
statement yesterday by the official Korean Central News Agency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
