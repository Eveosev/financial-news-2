A chief physician in western  Turkey 
was banished from his post and demoted for failing to greet a
lawmaker from the governing  Justice and Development Party ,
Milliyet reported.  Member of Parliament Ugur Aydemir visited the hospital at
Manisa, his constituency, in August and Dr. Mehmet Sahin greeted
him with delay as he was attending to a patient, Milliyet said,
citing a parliamentary request for information to be filed by
Ozgur Ozel, a representative of the Aegean province from the
main opposition  Republican People’s Party .  Sahin was transfered as a orthopedics specialist to another
hospital in Manisa following a threat to demote him by Aydemir,
according to Ozel’s parliamentary question, Milliyet said.
Aydemir denied threatening the doctor and said they haven’t met,
according to the newspaper. Manisa’s chief health administrator
said the decision was taken to increase productivity, Milliyet
reported.  Click here for web link  To contact the reporter on this story:
