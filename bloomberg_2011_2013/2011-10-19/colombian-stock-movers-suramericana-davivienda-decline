The following companies are having
unusual price changes in Bogota trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of 1:09 p.m. local time.  The IGBC Index fell 0.2 percent to 13,432.09 while the
Colcap Index fell 0.4 percent to 1,621.22.  Grupo de Inversiones Suramericana SA (GRUPOSUR)  , the
parent company of Colombia’s largest bank, fell 0.3 percent to
33,300 pesos after the government imposed a limit on  currency
trading  by pension funds as it seeks to reduce the peso’s
volatility.  Pension funds’ currency transactions over a five-day period
can equal no more than 2.5 percent of their assets under
management, the  Finance Ministry  said in a statement today.  Banco Davivienda SA (PFDAVVND)  , Colombia’s third-biggest
bank, fell 0.4 percent to 20,420 pesos after earlier declining
as much as 3.3 percent, the biggest intraday slide since March
16. The bank will sell as many as 40 million preferred shares in
the local market in an offering slated to begin tomorrow and end
Nov. 10, said Davivienda President Efrain Forero.  The share price will be 20,000 pesos, Forero told reporters
in Bogota today, for a total of up to 800 billion pesos ($421
million).  To contact the reporter on this story:
