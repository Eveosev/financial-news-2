China  sold five-year bonds at a
lower yield than investors estimated as demand for sovereign
debt rose amid signs the world’s second-largest economy is
cooling.  The Ministry of Finance issued 29.3 billion yuan ($4.6
billion) of notes due 2016 at an average rate of 3.55 percent,
according to a trader at a  finance company  that participates in
government debt auctions. That compared with a median estimate
of 3.58 percent by seven fixed-income analysts and traders in a
Bloomberg News survey. China’s economy grew 9.1 percent in the
third quarter from a year earlier, the slowest pace since 2009,
government figures released yesterday showed.  “There are strong expectations in the  bond market  that
 China’s economy  will slow further,” said Guo Caomin, a bond
analyst at Industrial Bank Co. in Shanghai. A “bull market is
under way” for fixed-income investors, he said.  The highest winning-bid yield at today’s debt sale was 3.57
percent, according to the trader. The auction drew bids for 1.71
times the amount on offer, up from 1.11 at the last auction of
similar-maturity securities on Aug. 3.  In the secondary market, the yield on the 3.44 percent
government bonds due June 2016 climbed two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 3.60 percent, according to the Interbank
Funding Center.  The  finance ministry  in January published a list of 59
underwriters required to bid at its bond sales, including
Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd., Agricultural Bank of
China Ltd., Bank of China Ltd., China Construction Bank Corp.,
China Citic Bank Corp., Postal Savings Bank of China, Industrial
Bank Co., Guotai Junan Securities Co. and BOC International
(China) Ltd.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
