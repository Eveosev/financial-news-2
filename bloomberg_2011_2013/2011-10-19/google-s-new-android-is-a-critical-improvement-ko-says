Richard Ko, an analyst at KGI
Securities Co. in Taipei, comments on  Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s latest
version of its Android software.  Google showcased the  Ice Cream Sandwich  in  Hong Kong  today
and said Samsung Electronics Co. will begin selling the first
mobile phone using the program in November. Google’s software
has features such as “talk-to-type” technology and facial-
recognition security.  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  unveiled its latest software
earlier this month featuring the Siri voice-recognition
technology.  Ko rates HTC Corp., Asia’s second-largest handset maker,
“neutral.” He spoke in a telephone interview today.  “Commonality between the handset and tablet systems is a
critical improvement and should help them leverage their
dominance in handsets onto the tablet market. One platform
across all devices means developers have a larger market and
helps their economies of scale.  ‘‘The new features like facial recognition are
improvements, and will help attract more users. The only area it
lags Apple is the user friendliness.’’  To contact the reporter on this story:
