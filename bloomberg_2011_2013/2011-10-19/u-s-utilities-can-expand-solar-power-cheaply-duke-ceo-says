U.S. utilities can expand solar
power cheaper than independent developers because they have
lower borrowing costs,  Duke Energy Corp. (DUK)  Chief Executive  James Rogers  said today at a conference in Dallas.  “We’re the most capital-intensive industry in the world
and we have access to low-cost capital,” Rogers said at the
Solar Power International conference. “Utilities are in a
unique position to deploy solar on a big scale.”  Putting a price on carbon dioxide will help make solar
power more competitive with fossil fuel power plants, he said.  “We clearly will have carbon legislation in the near
future,” Rogers said during a panel discussion of utility
executives. “The real price of electricity is going to go up.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
