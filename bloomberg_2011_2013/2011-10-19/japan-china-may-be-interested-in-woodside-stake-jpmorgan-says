Japan’s Mitsubishi Corp. and Mitsui
& Co. or  China  may be interested in buying part of  Royal Dutch
Shell Plc (RDSA) ’s remaining 24 percent stake in Australia’s  Woodside
Petroleum Ltd. (WPL) , according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.  “We believe Japanese firms could be strategically
interested in Woodside’s assets,” JPMorgan resources analysts,
including Benjamin Wilson, said yesterday in a report.  “Such a
deal would represent an indirect hedge for China against
imported liquefied national gas costs.”  Shell, Europe’s largest oil company, sold down 10 percent
of its Woodside stake on Nov. 8 last year for $3.35 billion,
saying it would keep the remaining 24 percent in its project
partner for at least one year.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the world’s
biggest mining company, doused speculation in April it plans to
buy Shell’s stake and launch a full takeover of Woodside.  BHP “appears disinterested for reasons of diversification
via geography and commodity, and has pursued other acquisitions
recently,” JPMorgan said. The sale of the full stake of about
A$7 billion ($7.2 billion) “seems too hard in current
conditions” and Shell can afford to wait to sell at a better
price, the broker said.  Woodside,  Australia ’s second-biggest oil and gas producer,
has dropped 18 percent this year. “We think potential
cornerstone investors must have been approached by Shell’s
advisors without success,” JPMorgan said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
