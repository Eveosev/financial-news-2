Citigroup agreed to pay $285 million
to settle claims by the Securities and Exchange Commission that
the lender mislead investors about a $1 billion collateralized
debt obligation tied to the U.S. housing market in which
Citigroup bet against investors.  The settlement requires Citigroup to pay $160 million in
disgorgement plus $30 million in prejudgment interest and a $95
million penalty for a total of $285 million that will be
returned to investors, the SEC said in an e-mailed statement.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
