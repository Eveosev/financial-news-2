French Finance Minister  Francois Baroin  said that  Europe ’s temporary bailout fund would be best
enhanced with help from the  European Central Bank , a position
the ECB and German government continue to oppose.  “That’s the French position and we maintain it,” he told
reporters as he arrived at an event today in  Frankfurt  to mark
the conclusion of Jean-Claude Trichet’s term as ECB President.
“The best solution is that the fund has a banking license with
the central bank.”  Euro-area governments are looking for ways of containing
the region’s two year-old debt crisis before leaders gather to
discuss the matter in Brussels on Oct. 23. So far the Frankfurt-
based ECB has resisted calls to make loans to the European
Financial Stability Facility to enlarge its firepower from 440
billion euros ($607 billion).  “Everyone know the reticence of the central bank and
everyone also knows of the reticence of the German position,”
Baroin said. “For us it is and will remain the most effective
position. The Americans do it, the British do it.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
