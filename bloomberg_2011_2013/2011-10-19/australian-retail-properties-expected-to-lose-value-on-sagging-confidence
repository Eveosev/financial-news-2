Australian retail property values
and rents are expected to fall over the coming year as slumping
business sentiment and weak  consumer confidence  weighs on demand,
a  National Australia Bank Ltd. (NAB)  survey showed.  Retail property values will lose 1.3 percent by September
2012, and rental returns will drop by 0.9 percent, the survey
found. That compares with expectations of a 1 percent gain in
office values and a flat outlook for industrial properties,
according to the report.  “Consumer confidence is now seen as the biggest challenge
facing property firms over the next year,” NAB said in the
report. “With the global economic outlook having clearly
deteriorated, global economic volatility is expected to have the
biggest impact on businesses over the next year.”  The central bank sees scope to reduce the nation’s 4.75
percent interest rate, the developed world’s highest, as a
weaker growth outlook and declining confidence eases inflation
concerns, the  Reserve Bank  of  Australia ’s minutes of its Oct. 4
meeting released yesterday showed. NAB’s commercial property
index, which measures capital value and rental pricing
expectations in the real estate industry, fell to minus 13 in
September, from minus 5 in June, the survey found.  To contact the reporter on this story:
