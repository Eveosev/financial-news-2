Federal  Reserve Bank  of Boston
President  Eric Rosengren  said he favors setting unemployment and
inflation markers that would trigger a pullback from near-zero
interest rates.  “I think 2.5 percent or 3 percent inflation would
certainly be grounds for taking away some of the
accommodation,” Rosengren said in a CNBC interview. “And I
would say getting the  unemployment rate  down to 7 percent, which
some people have talked about, would certainly be a reason to
remove some of the accommodation.”  Rosengren said exact figures would need to be settled on by
policy makers. He was reacting to a proposal by Chicago Fed
President  Charles Evans  to put more specific targets on what
would drive a change in policy from  interest rates  near zero and
a near-record balance sheet.  The Boston Fed president also said that “if the economy
were to be weaker than most people are forecasting, that would
certainly be cause for doing additional monetary policy.”  More asset purchases are “certainly a possibility,” he
said. “It partly depends on what you think the likelihood of a
bad economic shock is.”  The threat of falling prices would be one condition that
might bring more purchases, Rosengren said. “That wouldn’t
necessarily be the only condition.”  Rosengren said recent U.S. economic forecasts have been
revised upward, which is a “positive sign,” and the economy
may grow more quickly next year.  “At 2.5 percent to 3 percent next year, I think, would be
quite reasonable,” he said. Still “the risks still remain
weighted toward the downside.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
