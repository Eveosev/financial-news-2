PNC Financial Services Group Inc. (PNC) ,
the sixth-largest U.S. bank by deposits, beat analysts’
estimates as credit provisions and charge-offs decreased.  Net income fell 24 percent to $834 million, or $1.55 a
share, from $1.1 billion, or $2.07, in the same period a year
earlier, the Pittsburgh-based lender said today in a statement.
The average estimate of 31 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was
$1.49, including adjustments for one-time items. PNC had a gain
of $328 million, or 62 cents, in the third quarter last year
from the sale of PNC Global Investment Servicing.  PNC, run by Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Jim Rohr,
63, is among regional lenders facing squeezed margins from low
 interest rates  and a slowdown in loan growth amid a weaker
economy.  “We increased capital and managed risk by improving
overall  credit quality ,” Rohr said in the statement.  PNC’s credit-loss provision decreased to $261 million from
$486 million in the year earlier. Net charge-offs declined to
$365 million from $614 million. PNC’s revenue decreased for the
third consecutive quarter, falling to $3.54 billion from $3.6
billion in the second quarter and the year-earlier period.  Total loans increased 2.93 percent to $154.5 billion from a
year earlier.  ‘Degrees of Losing’  “There’s becoming more of a divergence between the strong
and the weak,” R. Scott Siefers, an analyst with Sandler
O’Neill & Partners LP, said before results were announced.
“That doesn’t necessarily mean the strong are necessarily
winning. It’s just degrees of losing, so to speak.”  Banks such as PNC, Minneapolis-based U.S. Bancorp and San
Francisco-based  Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC)  are stronger than their peers
but are “nowhere near their full potential,” Siefers said.
U.S. Bancorp reported a 40 percent gain in the third quarter
today as revenue and lending expanded. Wells Fargo said Oct. 17
that third-quarter revenue declined by 6 percent.  PNC’s net interest income fell 1.81 percent to $2.18
billion in the third quarter from a year-earlier and dropped
1.16 percent from the second quarter. The net interest margin,
the difference between what a bank pays in deposits and charges
for loans, narrowed to 3.89 percent from 3.96 percent.  Non-interest income fell 1.01 percent to $1.37 billion in
the third quarter from last year and declined 5.72 percent from
the second quarter. Non-interest expense fell to $2.14 billion
in the third quarter from $2.16 billion in the year earlier
period and $2.18 billion in the second quarter.  Tier 1 Capital   PNC’s Tier 1 common capital ratio widened to 10.5 percent
from 9.6 percent a year earlier. Retail banking posted income of
$33 million in the quarter compared with a $4 million loss in
the same period a year earlier. Profit from corporate and
institutional banking fell 3.7 percent to $419 million.  PNC agreed in June to pay $3.62 billion in cash and stock
for Royal Bank of Canada’s U.S. retail-banking unit and related
credit-card assets. The acquisition would help PNC expand in the
U.S. Southeast beyond a foothold in  Florida . RBC Bank USA, based
in Raleigh,  North Carolina , has more than 420 branches in six
states. The deal is expected to close in March 2012.  In July, the bank agreed to acquire 27 branches in the
Atlanta region from Flagstar Bancorp for about $42 million,
giving PNC about $240 million in deposits.  PNC doesn’t see the bank making any “meaningful
transactions on the horizon,” Rohr said today on a conference.
The bank could continue to acquire branches in deals similar to
the Flagstar transaction, he said.  Branch utilization is shrinking as customers switch to
mobile and online banking, and the bank will close about 80
branches and open 50 this year, Rohr said.  PNC increased 18 cents, or 0.4 percent, to $51.40 at 11:26
a.m. in  New York  Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares
have fallen 16 percent this year through yesterday, putting the
lender seventh among the top 10 performers in the 24-company KBW
Bank Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
