Francois Hollande , who won the
Socialist Party’s nomination last weekend, would defeat French
President  Nicolas Sarkozy  if next year’s elections were held
now, a poll said.  Hollande would win 62 percent and Sarkozy 38 percent in a
run-off, said the poll by CSA for BFM TV and RMC radio. It was
the first poll since the Socialist primary.  In the election’s first round, Hollande would take 35
percent, Sarkozy 25 percent, anti-immigrant campaigner Marine Le Pen 16 percent and centrist Francois Bayrou 9 percent, the poll
showed. Under the French system, a run-off is held if no
candidate wins a majority in the first round.  France  holds presidential elections next May. The poll
surveyed 1,010 people on Oct. 17. No margin of error was given.  To contact the reporter on this story:
