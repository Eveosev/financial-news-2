Mauritius’s rupee fell to the lowest
in a week against the dollar on concern that the top credit
rating of  France , its main Eurozone trading partner, is at risk.
Stocks declined.  The currency of the Indian Ocean island nation depreciated
as much as 0.4 percent to 29.05 per dollar, its lowest level on
a closing basis since Oct. 13, and traded 0.2 percent down to
29.00 per by 2:43 p.m. in Port Louis,  the capital, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Versus the euro, the rupee retreated
0.9 percent to 40.1327. The 38-member SEMDEX index of stocks
fell the most in two weeks, losing 0.2 percent to close at
1,886.77. Mauritius Commercial Bank, the largest lender by
market value, led the retreat.  France’s Aaa credit rating is under pressure following debt
deterioration and the potential for additional liabilities from
 Europe ’s debt crisis, Moody’s said on Oct. 17, adding that the
nation’s financial strength has weakened.  A cut “would seriously undermine the country’s finances,
and put a blow to the European Financial Stability Facility,
which France is part of,”  analysts at  Mauritius Commercial
Bank (MCB)  wrote in an e-mailed note to clients today.  Europe’s second-biggest economy is the Indian Ocean island
nation’s main source of tourists, making up 31 percent of
visitors for the eight months through August, data from the
Mauritius Tourism Promotion Authority show. The country bought
5.02 billion rupees ($173.1 million), or 25 percent of total
exports to Europe in the six months through June, according to
 Statistics Mauritius . France invested 595 million rupees in the
nation in the half year through June, or 18 percent of all
foreign direct investment, the  Bank of Mauritius  said.  Buying prices for the dollar ranged 28.0217 rupees to
28.1905 and the selling price declined to 29.5282 compared with
29.5353 on Oct. 18, according to  exchange rates  published today
on the Bank of Mauritius website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
