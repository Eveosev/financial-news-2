Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)  Chief Executive
Officer  Steve Ballmer  said Microsoft was “lucky” to have
avoided buying Yahoo! Inc. in 2008 amid tumbling markets in the
wake of the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.  Asked at a conference whether he was glad that acquisition
didn’t pan out, Ballmer noted that “times change.”  “If Yahoo had accepted our bid, we would have closed post-
Lehman Brothers, so sometimes you’re lucky,” he said in a
question-and-answer session at the Web 2.0 Summit in  San
Francisco .  Ballmer also took a potshot at Google Inc.’s Android
operating system, which competes with Microsoft’s Windows Phone
mobile software.  “You don’t need to be a computer scientist to use a
Windows phone,” he said. “I think you do to use an Android
phone.”  Editors:  To contact the reporters on this story:
