The  European Central Bank  said it
will lend dollars to one euro-area bank tomorrow.  The ECB today allotted $500 million to one bidder in its
regular seven-day liquidity-providing operation at a fixed rate
of 1.08 percent. Last week, the Frankfurt-based ECB also lent
$500 million to one institution. The ECB doesn’t identify the
banks it lends to.  European banks need dollars to fund their own lending in
the U.S. as well as to clients elsewhere doing business in the
world’s leading reserve currency. On Sept. 15, global equity
markets rallied after the ECB said it will coordinate with the
 Federal Reserve  to offer a series of three-month dollar loans to
euro-area banks to ensure they have enough of the currency for
the rest of the year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
