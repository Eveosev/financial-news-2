Copper for three-month delivery
traded at $7,325 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange after
the Commerce Department said builders in the U.S. began work on
658,000 houses at an annual rate in September. That topped the
median estimate from analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News. The
metal was at $7,309.75 a ton just before the figures were
released.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
