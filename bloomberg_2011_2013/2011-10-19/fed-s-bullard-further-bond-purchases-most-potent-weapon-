James Bullard , president of the
Federal Reserve Bank of  St. Louis , said additional asset
purchases are the central bank’s “most potent” weapon while
adding he wouldn’t support more bond buying now.  “I think policy is already appropriately easy so I don’t
think we’re in any position to do that now,” he said today in a
radio interview on “Bloomberg Surveillance” with  Tom Keene .  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
