Sugar-cane processors in  Brazil ,
including  Bunge Ltd. (BG)  and Louis Dreyfus SAS, are preparing to
increase their ethanol exports to the U.S., where  oil companies 
must expand their use of biofuels.  Ethanol producers had registered 107 mills with the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency at the beginning of October, up
from 55 in February, the Sao Paulo-based cane industry
association Uniao da Industria de Cana-de-Acucar said today on
its  website .  The U.S. may increase its use of ethanol made from cane
because it’s classified under the EPA’s Renewable Fuel Standard
as an advanced biofuel and producing it generates less carbon-
dioxide emissions than domestically produced corn ethanol, which
is not labeled an advanced fuel.  “This recognition makes sugar-cane ethanol desirable in
the US market, so it makes sense for Brazilian mills to prepare
for this opportunity,” Leticia Phillips, Unica’s North America
representative, said in the statement. Brazilian ethanol can
reduce greenhouse-gas emissions by as much as 91 percent
compared to gasoline, she said.  U.S. oil companies will be  required  to blend 36 billion
gallons (136 billion liters) of biofuels with petroleum-based
fuel in 2022, up from 14 billion this year, according to the
EPA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
