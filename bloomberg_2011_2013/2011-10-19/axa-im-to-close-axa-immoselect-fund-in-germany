Axa Investment Managers, a unit of
French insurer  Axa SA (CS) , is closing its Axa Immoselect real-estate
fund in  Germany  because of insufficient liquidity.  The fund’s liquidity level was about 10 percent, while the
minimum required would have been about 30 percent, according to
a statement on the website of Axa’s real-estate unit.  The Axa Immoselect fund, managed by Axa Investment Managers
Deutschland GmbH, had 2.5 billion euros of assets ($3.45
billion), according to Jocelyne Tamssom, a Paris-based
spokeswoman at Axa’s real-estate division.  “We will get the best possible prices for the sale of the
assets and we’re continuing to manage the portfolio in an active
way,” she said. Axa Immoselect’s assets include offices,
logistics, hotel and commercial real estate, Tamssom said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
