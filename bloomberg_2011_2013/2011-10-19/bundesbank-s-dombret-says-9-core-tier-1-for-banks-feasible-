Bundesbank board member Andreas Dombret said a 9 percent target ratio for core tier 1 capital, a
measure of financial strength, is “feasible” for systemically-
important European banks.  “A core tier 1 ratio for systemically-relevant banks in
 Europe  of 9 percent after realistic mark-to-market of risks,
introduced with the right sense of proportion, could be feasible
and could provide reasonable comfort,” Dombret said in a speech
in Berlin today.  Dombret added that banks seeking to boost their capital
should first approach financial markets, and then governments.
Europe’s bailout fund, known as the EFSF, should only be used as
a last resort, Dombret said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
