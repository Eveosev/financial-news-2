Following is the historical
cost-of-living-adjustment as reported by the Bureau of Labor
Statistics. The Cost-of-Living-Adjustment (COLA) is calculated
from the CPI report, by measuring the increase in the average CPI-
Wage index from the third calendar quarter of the current year to
the third quarter average of the previous year. Changes would
take effect next year.
