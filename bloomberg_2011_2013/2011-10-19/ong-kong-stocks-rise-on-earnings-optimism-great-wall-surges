Hong Kong stocks fell, deepening a
weekly retreat, amid concern an impasse over European bailout
talks may hurt a global recovery, while the  Federal Reserve  said
companies grew more pessimistic about the  U.S. economy .  Esprit Holdings Ltd. (330) , a Hong Kong-listed clothing retailer
that gets almost 80 percent of its sales in  Europe , plunged 7.8
percent. Aluminum Corp. of China Ltd., the nation’s biggest
producer of the metal, slumped 4.9 percent and Jiangxi Copper
Co. retreated 3.7 percent. Li & Fung Ltd., a supplier of clothes
and toys to Wal-Mart Stores Inc., dropped 2.8 percent.  The  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  fell 1.8 percent to 17,983.10 at the
close of trading in Hong Kong, with declines by all four
industry groups and all but six stocks in the 46-member gauge.
The measure has lost 2.8 percent this week after China reported
the slowest economic growth since 2009 and  Germany  doused hopes
of a quick fix to Europe’s debt crisis. The Hang Seng China
Enterprises Index of Chinese companies listed in  Hong Kong 
dropped 2.7 percent to 9,196.68 today.  “There appears to be growing concern about whether or not
European leaders meeting on the weekend will be able to come up
with a credible plan,” said  Angus Gluskie , who manages more
than $300 million at White Funds Management in Sydney. “U.S.
economic conditions don’t appear to be getting any better and in
fact there’s some risk it might get worse, and so that doesn’t
give investors much comfort at all.”  Beige Book   Stocks across the Asia-Pacific region fell after Luxembourg
Prime Minister  Jean-Claude Juncker , who chairs the group of
euro-area finance ministers, indicated that an impromptu meeting
of European leaders in  Frankfurt  last night failed to resolve
differences ahead of a summit scheduled for this weekend.  The Fed’s Beige Book survey released yesterday showed U.S.
companies reported more doubt about the recovery, even as the
economy maintained its expansion last month.  Esprit slipped 7.8 percent to HK$10.48, leading exporters
lower. Li & Fung lost 2.8 percent to HK$12.60.  Commodity shares also slid after New York-traded crude oil
futures lost 2.5 percent yesterday, while copper futures for
December delivery dropped 3 percent.  Jiangxi Copper, the biggest producer of the metal, fell 3.7
percent to HK$15, while Aluminum Corp. slumped 4.9 to HK$3.52.
 Cnooc Ltd. (883) , China’s largest offshore energy explorer, declined 3
percent to HK$12.78.  Debt Crisis  The Hang Seng Index has tumbled 22 percent this year amid
concern a U.S. recovery is stalling, and as Europe’s leaders
grapple with ways to maximize the firepower of a 440 billion-
euro ($605.5 billion) European Financial Stability Facility as
the region’s debt crisis threatens to engulf Italy and  Spain .  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index lost 0.1 percent
today. The  S&P 500  fell 1.3 percent yesterday, led by losses in
 Apple Inc. (AAPL)  after the maker of iPhones and iPads reported profit
that missed analyst estimates.  Futures on the Hang Seng Index fell 1.8 percent to 17,967.
The HSI Volatility Index climbed 5.7 percent to 37.82,
indicating options traders expect a swing of 11 percent in the
Hang Seng Index in the next 30 days.  Industrial & Commercial Bank of China (601398)  Ltd. dipped 1.2
percent to HK$4.07, leading Chinese financial stocks lower after
the nation’s banking regulator said risks stemming from a so-
called shadow banking system and private lending must be
“strictly controlled.”  Bank of China Ltd. (3988)  fell 1.5 percent to
HK$2.63.  Private Lending  China’s central bank will start a second round of
investigations into the nation’s private lending and may
introduce a monitoring system in the future, the 21st Century
Business Herald reported today, citing an unidentified person
close to the People’s Bank of China.  “Investors are seeing a clearer picture of the economic
slowdown at home and globally, which may lead to market
fluctuations,” said Liu Jianwei, a  fund manager  at Bosera Asset
Management Co., which oversees more than $29 billion. “The
European crisis will be a major concern for investors.”  China  Southern Airlines Co. slumped 1.7 percent to HK$4.11
after China Business News said the aviation regulator cut its
forecast for air-traffic growth this year. China Eastern
Airlines Corp. slid 3.1 percent to HK$2.54.  To contact the reporters on this story:
