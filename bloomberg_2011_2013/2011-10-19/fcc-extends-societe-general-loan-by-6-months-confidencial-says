Fomento de Construcciones &
Contratas SA extended a loan from  Societe Generale (GLE)  SA for six
months in return for giving the French bank treasury stock as a
guarantee,  El Confidencial  reported, without citing anyone.  The agreement for 135 million euros ($186 million) involves
pledging 4.8 percent of the companyâ€™s shares and will provide
FCC with added liquidity, El Confidencial said.  Both FCC and Societe General declined to comment, El
Confidencial said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
