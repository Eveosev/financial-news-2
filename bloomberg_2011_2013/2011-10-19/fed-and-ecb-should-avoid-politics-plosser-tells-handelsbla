President  Charles Plosser  said central banks in the U.S. and
Europe had ventured too far into political processes and should
pull out,  Handelsblatt  reported.  The Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank should
find ways to return to a focus on monetary policy, Plosser told
the German newspaper in an interview. He also warned that the
Fedâ€™s purchase of Treasuries has created conditions for
inflation once the U.S. economy improves, Handelsblatt said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
