A judge threw out a lawsuit
claiming Herbert Allen, the chief executive officer of Allen &
Co., and his Broadway-producer cousin forged the signature of a
dying relative to illegally evade collection of a debt.  U.S. District Judge  Colleen McMahon  in  Manhattan  yesterday
dismissed the case, in which Excelsior Capital LLC claimed that
Allen and cousin Terry Allen Kramer fraudulently transferred a
family-owned  Arizona  ranch by forging the signature of C. Robert
Allen III.  Excelsior claimed the two cousins were trying to block it
from pursuing Robert Allen’s interest in the Arizona property to
collect part of a $25.3 million court judgment against him.
Members of the Allen family had owned the Arizona ranch for more
than 50 years, according to McMahon. Robert Allen owned
18.3 percent.  McMahon ruled that the suit, in which Excelsior said
Herbert Allen and Terry Allen Kramer forged Robert Allen’s
signature on a deed with help from an Allen & Co. executive,
failed to properly allege claims of fraudulent transfer and
conspiracy.  “This lawsuit was a crude attempt to collect money from my
late cousin by making ungrounded accusations against me,”
Herbert Allen said in a statement today. “It is gratifying that
in dismissing the case the judge recognized these accusations as
‘implausible’ and based on ‘sheer speculation.’”  Judd Burstein, a lawyer for Excelsior, didn’t immediately
return a message seeking comment on the ruling.  The case is Excelsior Capital LLC v. Allen, 11-CV-7373,
U.S. District Court, Southern District of  New York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
