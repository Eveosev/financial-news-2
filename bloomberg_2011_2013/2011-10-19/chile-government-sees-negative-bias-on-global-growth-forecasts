Chile ’s Finance Minister Felipe
Larrain sees a negative bias on global growth forecasts. While
the probability of a 2009-like global recession is still low,
the chance are growing, he told a conference in Santiago today.  Larrain attributed a decline in the price of copper,
Chile’s biggest export, to slowing Chinese demand for the metal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
