Turkmenistan , the former Soviet
republic that holds the world’s fourth-largest reserves of
natural gas, said Russia has no right to block a planned
pipeline across the Caspian Sea.  A decision on the link, including its environmental impact,
is a matter for the states involved, Turkmenistan’s Foreign
Ministry said late yesterday in a  statement  on its website.  The European Union, which is seeking alternative sources of
energy to reduce dependence on Russia, last month started
negotiations for a legally binding treaty with Azerbaijan and
Turkmenistan to build the Trans-Caspian Pipeline System.  The proposed link needs the agreement of all of the Caspian
Sea littoral nations that include Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan and
Iran before it can go ahead, Russian President  Dmitry Medvedev 
said earlier this month.  The Russian president cited environmental concerns and the
uncertain legal status of the Caspian Sea, according to the
Kremlin’s  website . Russia, holder of the world’s biggest gas
reserves, currently supplies a quarter of Europe’s fuel needs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
