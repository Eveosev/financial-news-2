German  Chancellor Angela Merkel  said
the European Union summit on Oct. 23 will not be “the end
point” of the debt crisis that requires more than “a magic
wand” to solve.  “It won’t be the final point where we regain the
confidence of others, but it will be a stepping stone, a marker
on the road,” Merkel said in a speech in  Frankfurt  today.  Merkel and other euro-area leaders assembled in Frankfurt
seeking to narrow divisions four days before a summit that she
said has “very important matters” on the agenda. Hurdles to
leveraging the 440 billion-euro ($607 billion) bailout fund and
opposition from banks to forced recapitalization and deeper
writedowns on Greek debt are slowing the search for solutions.  “All of the sins of omission and commission of the past
cannot be undone by waving a magic wand,” Merkel said at the
event honoring European Central Bank President  Jean-Claude Trichet . “We have to pursue our economic activities
sustainably. This is going to be a long and arduous road.”  She renewed her previous defense of the euro, saying the
17-nation currency is “inextricably linked with the European
project as a whole,” has proved stable and will not be allowed
to fail.  To contact the reporters on this story:
