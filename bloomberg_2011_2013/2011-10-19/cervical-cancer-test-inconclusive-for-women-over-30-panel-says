A U.S. advisory panel declined to
endorse human papillomavirus screening to detect cervical cancer
in women old than 30, saying the tests yield inconclusive results.  A  draft report  from the  U.S. Preventive Services Task Force 
said “more complete evidence is needed” before HPV screening
is widely adopted for the age group. The findings update a 2003
agency recommendation that recommended cervical cancer screen in
sexually active women.  About 12,700 new cases of cervical cancer will be diagnosed
in the U.S. this year, resulting in 4,290 deaths, according to
the  National Cancer Institute . Most cases of cervical cancer are
caused by papillomavirus, a sexually transmitted infection.  The task force is a government supported panel of doctors
formed in 1984 to give advice on screening, counseling and
preventive medicines based on an impartial assessment of
scientific evidence. Recommendations may prompt insurers to
change their coverage guidelines.  The  task force  on Oct. 7 issued draft recommendations
against using tests measuring PSA, a protein associated with
prostate cancer at high levels.  The panel will take public comment on the cervical cancer
guidelines through Nov. 16.  To contact the reporter on this story:
