Aids to Brazilian President  Dilma
Rousseff  see room for the central bank to reduce the benchmark
lending rate by more than 0.5 percentage point today,  O Globo 
reported, without saying where it obtained the information.   Rousseff met with Finance Minister  Guido Mantega  and
central bank chief Alexandre Tombini before heading to  Africa 
and asked them to take into account the worsening of the global
crisis and the Brazilian economic slowdown, the Rio de Janeiro-
based newspaper said.   Officials at the presidential palace consider that the
current international scenario allows for a deeper rate cut
without compromising inflation control, O Globo said. They
expect the Selic to come below 9 percent in 2012, said the
newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
