Monarch Alternative Capital LP, a
New York-based investment company, filed a claim of about $45.5
million in a London court against Drydocks World LLC as the
Dubai World unit works on restructuring $2.2 billion of debt.  The case was filed on Oct. 6 by Monarch Master Funding Ltd.
in the  High Court  of Justice, according to the case filing.
Jeremy Fielding, a spokesman for Monarch, which mainly invests
in distressed debt, confirmed the filing and the amount.  “It is regrettable that this one lender alone has decided
for unclear reasons to take legal action,” Drydocks said in an
e-mailed response to questions from Bloomberg News. “The
company is currently considering its formal response.”  Drydocks World, a ship-repair unit, is negotiating with
creditors on delaying debt repayments. Dubai’s government may
not support Drydocks with its debt restructuring as that
responsibility falls on its parent Dubai World, Mohammed Al
Shaibani, the director general of Dubai ruler’s court, a top
government official, said Sept. 23.  Dubai in March 2010 provided $1.5 billion in cash to Dubai
World and converted $8.9 billion of loans to equity of the
company as part of the $25 billion debt restructuring.  Drydocks World “is working diligently with its core
coordinating committee and all other lenders to finalize a
consensual financial restructuring in the shortest possible
time,” the company said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
