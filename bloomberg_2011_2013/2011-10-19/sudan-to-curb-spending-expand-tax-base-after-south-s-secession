Sudan  plans to cut  government
spending  and expand the nation’s tax base to make up for the
secession of oil-rich South Sudan, President Umar al-Bashir
said.  “Secession of the south created a gap in Sudan’s trade
balance,” al-Bashir said today in a speech at the opening of a
conference on the economy held by his ruling National Congress
Party. “We want to increase our revenues without levying more
taxes on citizens, and that will come by curbing government
spending and expanding the tax base by 2012.”  Sudan lost three-quarters of its oil production, the third-
biggest output in sub-Saharan  Africa , when South Sudan gained
independence on July 9. Protests were held in September and this
month against the rising cost of living and worsening economic
conditions.  Sudan’s annual inflation rate stood at almost 21 percent
last month, the Khartoum-based  Central Bureau of Statistics  said
on Oct. 7.  “We want to focus on economic stability to attract
investors,” al-Bashir said. “We want to find a way out of the
economic crisis in Sudan and elsewhere” that was due to the
failure of a capitalist system that “is against God’s will.”  Al-Bashir announced on Oct. 12 that Sudan planned to draft
an Islamic constitution, enshrining Sharia as the main source of
Sudanese law.  To contact the reporter on this story:
