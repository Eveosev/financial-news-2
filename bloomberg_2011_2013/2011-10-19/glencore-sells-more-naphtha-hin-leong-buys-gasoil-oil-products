Glencore International AG sold
naphtha for a third day in Singapore,  Asia ’s biggest oil-trading
center. Hin Leong Trading Pte paid a higher premium for two
gasoil cargoes.  Light Distillates  Glencore, the world’s largest commodities trader, sold a
25,000 metric-ton, open-specification naphtha contract for the
first half of December, according to a Bloomberg survey of
traders monitoring transactions on the Platts window. The
company received $907 a ton from BP Plc.  Naphtha’s premium to London-traded Brent crude futures
increased 83 cents from yesterday to $67.42 a ton at 6 p.m.
Singapore time, based on data compiled by Bloomberg. This crack
spread, a measure of refining profit, widened for the second
time in three days.  Middle Distillates  Hin Leong bought gasoil, or diesel, with 0.5 percent sulfur
for a second day in  Singapore , according to the Bloomberg survey.
The closely held trader paid 40 cents a barrel over benchmark
quotes to ConocoPhillips and BP for 170,000 barrels each. That’s
a higher premium than 10 cents in yesterday’s transactions.  Gasoil’s premium to Asian marker Dubai crude fell 91 cents
to $15.22 a barrel at 2:31 p.m. Singapore time, based on data
from PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a broker. This crack spread is the
narrowest since Sept. 15.  Jet fuel’s premium to gasoil rose 5 cents to $3.05 a barrel,
PVM said. This regrade is the highest since Feb. 23, indicating
it is profitable to produce  aviation fuel  over diesel.  Fuel Oil  Fuel oil ’s discount to Dubai crude widened 72 cents to
$5.13 a barrel at 2:31 p.m. Singapore time, according to PVM.
That’s the biggest gap this week, signaling refiners’ losses
from turning oil into residual products are growing.  The premium of 180-centistoke fuel oil to 380-centistoke
grade was unchanged after dropping to $7.50 a ton, PVM data
showed. A narrower viscosity spread means bunker, or marine fuel,
has gained more than higher-quality fuel oil.  To contact the reporter on this story:
