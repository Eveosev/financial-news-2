George Williamson Kenya Ltd. (GWKL) , a
producer of tea leaves, rallied to its highest level in more
than 15 months after  Business Daily  reported the company plans
to pay its shareholders a special dividend.  The shares jumped 8.1 percent to 227 shillings by the close
in Nairobi, the highest level since July 7, 2010.  George Williamson will pay its shareholders a special
dividend in the current financial year following the sale of its
office for 500 million shillings ($5 million), the Nairobi-based
newspaper said, citing Managing Director Alan Carmichael. The
company will now rent office space at a different building in
the city, Business Daily said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
