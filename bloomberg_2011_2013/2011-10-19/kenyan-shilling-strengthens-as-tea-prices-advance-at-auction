Kenya ’s shilling strengthened
against the dollar on increased inflows of the U.S. currency
from the sale of agricultural products.  The currency of  East Africa ’s biggest economy appreciated
as much as 0.5 percent to 99.38 per dollar and was trading 0.2
percent stronger at 99.75 by 12:47 p.m. in Nairobi, the capital,
from yesterday’s close of 99.90.  African tea prices increased to an average of $2.65 a
kilogram (2.2 pounds) at an auction in the Kenyan port city of
 Mombasa  today, up from $2.61 a week earlier, Tea Brokers East
Africa Ltd. said in an e-mailed report yesterday.  “The strengthening of the shilling is due to increased
inflows from the agricultural sectors and the market is
experiencing minimal dollar demand ahead of tomorrow’s public
holiday,” Bernard Matimu, chief dealer at Nairobi-based NIC
Bank Ltd., said by phone today.  The shilling has depreciated 19 percent this year, making
it the world’s worst performer against the dollar. Inflation
accelerated for the eleventh consecutive month in September to
17.3 percent from 16.7 percent in August, more than triple the
government’s target, on higher food and fuel costs.
