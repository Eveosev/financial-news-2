European Commission President  Jose Barroso  said a summit of the region’s leaders this weekend will
take “important, long-term decisions” though is unlikely to
mark “the end of all our troubles.”  “Even if we do arrive at a political decision on
everything that’s on the table, which I hope we will, that
doesn’t necessarily mean that there will not then have to be an
implementing phase,” Barroso told reporters today in Brussels,
where European leaders will gather on Oct. 23 for a crisis-
fighting summit.   “You cannot hope that this will be the end of all our
troubles, but I very much hope that important, long-term
decisions which are important for the future of the European
Union and the euro will come about,” he said.  “We’re at a crucial point,” Barroso said. “We’re at a
turning point, a decisive point, which requires clear and
determined responses, comprehensive responses.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
