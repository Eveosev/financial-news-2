Canadian Finance Minister  Jim Flaherty  said the 440 billion-euro ($606 billion) rescue fund is
not sufficient to deal with the crisis, and will need to be
leveraged.  Speaking to reporters in Ottawa, Flaherty said European
leaders have the “sense of urgency required,” though the slow
pace toward a solution is “disconcerting.”  Europe ’s leaders are groping for ways to maximize the
firepower of the so-called European Financial Stability Facility
as the region’s debt crisis threatens to engulf Italy and  Spain .  “There is general consensus that the facility, the 440
billion euros, in absolute terms, is not sufficient so that it
needs to be leveraged,” said Flaherty, “to get up to a much
more substantial number to deal with the banks.”  He said one possible way to leverage the facility was
through “equity,” without giving details.  To contact the reporters on this story:
