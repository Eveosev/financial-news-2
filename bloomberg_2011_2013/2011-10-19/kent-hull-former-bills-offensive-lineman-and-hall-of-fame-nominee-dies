University  from 1979-82, the Starkville,  Mississippi , school

who played quarterback for the Bills while Hull was the team’s
center, said in a statement last night. “Kent Hull was my best
friend. A man of great courage, faith and character.”  Hull played in 189 games for the  National Football League ’s
Bills from 1986 to 1996, including four consecutive AFC
Championships that led to four straight Super Bowl losses in
1991-94. He played for the New Jersey Generals of the United

seasons with the Bills.  In September, he was one of 14 offensive linemen on the Pro
