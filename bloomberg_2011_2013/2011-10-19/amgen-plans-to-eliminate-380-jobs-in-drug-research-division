Amgen Inc. (AMGN) , the world’s largest
biotechnology company, is firing 380 employees in its research
and development division, a spokeswoman said.  The  Thousand Oaks , California-based company increased its
research spending 26 percent during the second quarter, to $808
million, as three experimental drugs moved into larger clinical
trials, which are more expensive and require more resources,
said Mary Klem, a spokeswoman.  “We will continue to invest in our R&D,” Klem said today
in an interview. “This doesn’t represent an across-the board
cut.”  Amgen spent $2.84 billion in research and development last
year, according to Bloomberg data. The company said in July its
adjusted research and development costs will be at the upper end
of the range of 18 percent to 20 percent of product sales.  The company said about half of its second-quarter increase
in spending for the division was related to three drugs in
development, trebananib, ganitumab and OncoVEX, with the
remaining funds going to marketing approved medicines such as
bone-strengthening drug Prolia and Xgeva, which reduces
fractures in cancer patients.  Amgen was little changed at $57.32 at 4 p.m. New York time.
The shares have risen 4.4 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
