Uganda ’s central bank will take
“appropriate” steps to support the shilling, though it hasn’t
decided on whether to follow neighboring  Kenya  in limiting the
foreign exchange exposure of commercial banks, Elliot Mwebya,
spokesman for the bank, said.  Policies suitable for Kenya aren’t necessarily ideal for
Uganda, Mwebya told reporters in the capital, Kampala, today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
