Vietnam  will continue implementing
the inflation-fighting strategy known as Resolution 11 until
“we bring macroeconomic indicators back to normal,” Deputy
Minister of Planning and Investment Dang Huy Dong, said at the
Vietnam Investment Summit in  Ho Chi Minh City  today.  That means “inflation will have to be brought down to a
single digit, gradually,” Dong said. “National public debts
are to be reduced to a healthy and manageable level.”  Vietnam has “managed to increase the foreign exchange
reserves,” said Dong, who also said that the country is
implementing tight monetary and fiscal policies.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
