Chile’s economy probably will expand
4.7 percent in the second half of the year and has the fiscal
and monetary tools to respond to a global crisis, Finance
Minister Felipe Larrain said today.  Chile “undoubtedly” won’t grow 5 percent next year if a
global recession hits, he told a conference in Santiago. The
government will reach its development goals even with a
“restrictive” world outlook, Larrain said.  While authorities remain committed to fiscal discipline,
they could protect growth, employment and investment as part of
contingency measures in any global crisis, he said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
