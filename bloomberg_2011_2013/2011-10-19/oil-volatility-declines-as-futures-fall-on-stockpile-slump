Oil options volatility fell as the
underlying futures declined after the U.S. Energy Department
reported inventories dropped to a 20-month low.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
December, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a
gauge of options prices, was 40 percent at 2 p.m. in New York,
down from 40.7 percent yesterday.  Oil for November delivery fell $2.23, or 2.5 percent, to
$86.11 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Oil has
dropped 5.8 percent this year.  The most active options contracts in electronic trading
today were January $80 puts, with 1,522 lots changing hands as
of 2:15 p.m. The options gained 12 cents to $3.20 a barrel.
December $80 puts, the next-most-active options with 1,367 lots,
rose 10 cents to $1.65 a barrel. One contract covers 1,000
barrels of crude.  The volume of puts outnumbered calls by about 53 percent to
47 percent.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information on floor trading, where the
bulk of options trading occurs, the next business day.  December $100 calls were the most-active options traded in
the previous session, with 7,930 lots changing hands. They rose
12 cents to 48 cents a barrel. The next-most-active options,
