Greek lawmakers began casting their
ballots in a vote on a new austerity bill to meet 2011 and 2012
budget targets and qualify for a sixth loan installment.   The roll-call vote in parliament in  Athens  is being
televised live on state-run Vouli TV. Todayâ€™s in-principle vote
will be followed by a final ballot on all articles and in total
tomorrow.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
