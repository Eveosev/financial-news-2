A Government Accountability Office
report on  Federal Reserve  governance released today said that
the nine-member boards of reserve banks lacked racial and ethnic
diversity in 2006 to 2010, and noted that further work is needed
to avoid potential conflicts of interest.  The Fed revised its rules for reserve bank directors in
2009 after potential conflicts emerged during the 2008-2009
financial crisis. Even so, the GAO said, the Fed needs to take
“additional steps to strengthen controls designed to manage
conflicts of interest” and to increase public disclosure of
directors’ roles and responsibilities.  “More can be done to enhance the transparency of the
reserve banks’ governance practices,” the GAO  report  said. It
recommended that all reserve banks “clearly document the roles
and responsibilities of the directors, including restrictions on
their involvement in supervision and regulation activities, in
their bylaws.”  The GAO audit of Fed governance was required by the Dodd-
Frank Act signed into law last year. The report makes four
recommendations aimed at enhancing diversity of Federal Reserve
bank boards, strengthening policies for managing conflicts of
interest and enhancing transparency.  “The Federal Reserve believes all have merit and will work
to implement each of them,” Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said
in a reply included with the report  To contact the reporters on this story:
