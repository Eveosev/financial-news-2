Poland’s WIG20 Index gained 6.79, or
0.3 percent, to close at 2,295.22 by 5:30 p.m. in Warsaw,
extending this month’s advance to 4.9 percent.  The following are among the most active stocks on the
 Warsaw Stock Exchange  today. Stock symbols follow company names.  ING Bank Slaski SA (BSK)   rose 0.6 percent to 722.5
zloty. The ING Groep NV unit was increased to “buy” from
“hold” at UniCredit.  Grupa Lotos SA (LTS)  , Poland’s second-largest refiner,
jumped 3.6 percent to 27.35 zloty, its second day of gains. Oil
traded near the highest price in more than a month after Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. predicted “upside” potential.  TVN SA (TVN)   gained 2.8 percent to 14.7 zloty, rising
for a second day. The company proposed to move its television
assets valued at 2.2 billion zloty ($700 million) to 2.7 billion
zloty to a separate unit, according to a regulatory statement.
The plan “has nothing to do with the sale process” conducted
by owner ITI Holdings SA, said Karol Smolag, a TVN spokesman.  To contact the reporter on this story:
