The rally in emerging-market
equities since early October should lead to further “solid
gains” over the next 12 months, Citigroup Inc. said.  Emerging stocks are likely to outperform developed markets
for the next few months, analysts led by Geoffrey Dennis wrote
in a report dated yesterday. “We retain our preference for
 Asia , with our Overweight markets being  China ,  Korea ,  Turkey ,
 Malaysia  and  Chile ; we favor Banks, Cons Discretionary and IT.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
