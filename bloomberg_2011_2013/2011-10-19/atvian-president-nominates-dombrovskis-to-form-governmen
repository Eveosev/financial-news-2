Latvian President Andris Berzins
nominated Prime Minister Valdis Dombrovskis to form a new
government after parliamentary elections last month.  Dombrovskis’s Unity Party will try to form a government
together with ex-President Valdis Zatlers’ Reform Party and the
 National Alliance . The three parties, together with six deputies
that split off from the Reform Party, will have 56 seats in the
100-member legislature.  “I have taken the decision to invite Valdis Dombrovskis to
form a Cabinet of ministers,” said Berzins in a statement on
his  website . The president had proposed to Dombrovskis to create
a Cabinet with members of all parties in parliament for broader
support.  The government will need to approve additional austerity
measures to cut the deficit to 2.5 percent of gross domestic
product next year as it plans to adopt the euro two years later.
Since turning to a group led by the European Commission and the
 International Monetary Fund  for a 7.5 billion-euro ($10.3
billion) loan in 2008, the Baltic country has lowered spending
and raised taxes equal to about 16 percent of GDP.  “The first serious examination for the possible
coalition’s ability to work will be the vote on the state budget
for 2012,” Berzins said in the statement. The budget “can’t
become an experiment with the state and threaten the country’s
international obligations.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
