Global wealth will rise almost 50
percent in the next five years, led by an increase in the number
of affluent households in Latin America, Africa and Asia,
according to  Credit Suisse Group AG. (CSGN)   Total wealth will climb to $345 trillion in 2016 from $231
trillion in June, equivalent to an annual increase of 8.4
percent, Credit Suisse said in its second annual global wealth
report released in  Hong Kong  today. In the 18 months to June,
total wealth advanced 14 percent from $203 trillion.  Emerging markets have “considerable scope” for households
to boost wealth on rising incomes and lower debt levels than in
mature economies, the report found. Total household wealth in
the Asia-Pacific region jumped 23 percent to $75 trillion over
the 18 months to June, outpacing North America’s 9.2 percent and
 Europe ’s 4.8 percent growth rates.  “This fast emerging wealth will drive new trends in
consumption and investment in  Asia ,” Giles Keating, Credit
Suisse’s global head of research for private banking, said in a
statement. Asia’s higher rate of wealth creation means “there
may be scope for mutual collaboration to help mitigate the euro
debt crisis,” Keating said.  Wealth in  China  is forecast to climb by more than 90
percent to $39 trillion in 2016, overtaking  Japan , which will
have $31 trillion, the report said. India and Brazil’s wealth
will more than double to $8.9 trillion and $9.2 trillion
respectively.  Wealthiest Nations  Globally, 29.7 million adults have more than $1 million,
accounting for less than 1 percent of the world’s population and
39 percent of global household wealth.  Switzerland, Australia and  Norway  are the world’s richest
nations measured by average wealth per adult, who hold $540,010,
$396,745 and $355,925 respectively, the report found. Wealth is
defined as financial and real assets including housing owned by
individuals minus debt.  Europeans have an average of $25,550 in debt each, while in
Asia the figure is $9,227, according to the report.  Credit Suisse said the report looks at the wealth
distribution of the world’s 4.5 billion adults, covering more
than 200 countries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
