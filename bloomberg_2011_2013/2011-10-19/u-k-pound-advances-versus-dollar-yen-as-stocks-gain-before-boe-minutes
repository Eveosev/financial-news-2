The pound rose against the dollar
and the yen amid reports that  France  and  Germany  are taking
steps to resolve the region’s debt crisis and as investors
awaited the minutes the  Bank of England ’s latest policy meeting.  Sterling snapped a two-day decline versus the greenback as
U.K. stocks gained after the  Guardian newspaper  said Germany and
France agreed to boost the region’s rescue fund. A person with
direct knowledge told Bloomberg News no deal has been reached.
The Bank of England minutes, showing how policy makers voted
this month, will be published at 9:30 a.m. in  London .  “The market’s going to be focusing on the minutes and
particularly the vote,” said Jane Foley, a senior currency
strategist at Rabobank International in London. “The pound
looks at the vote and often views it as a gauge of dovishness.
The currency will find it difficult to hold its best levels
against the dollar this morning. Those minutes will be dovish.”  Sterling strengthened 0.2 percent to $1.5738 at 9:23 a.m.
London time, and advanced 0.1 percent to 120.88 yen. The pound
weakened 0.2 percent to 87.74 pence per euro.  The  FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  climbed 0.5 percent and the Stoxx Europe
600 Index gained 0.2 percent.  The pound has slid 1.6 percent in the past six months,
according to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes, which
measure a basket of 10 developed-market currencies.  The Bank of England announced an extension of its bond-
purchase program to 275 billion pounds from 200 billion pounds
on Oct. 6.  The 10-year gilt yield rose six basis points, or 0.06
percentage point, to 2.49 percent. The 3.75 percent security
maturing September 2021 fell 0.550, or 5.50 pounds per 1,000-
pound face amount, to 110.945.  U.K. government debt has returned 12 percent this year,
