German Finance Minister  Wolfgang
Schaeuble  told lawmakers in Berlin that the firepower of the
European Financial Stability Facility may be increased to a
maximum of 1 trillion euros ($1.38 trillion) through an
insurance model, Financial Times Deutschland reported.   Schaeuble briefed lawmakers from Chancellor Angela Merkel’s
Christian Democratic-led bloc and their Free Democratic
coalition partners, the FTD reported, without saying where it
obtained the information.   CDU lawmakers plan to discuss the European bailout fund
again on Thursday, the newspaper said. Schaeuble told lawmakers
