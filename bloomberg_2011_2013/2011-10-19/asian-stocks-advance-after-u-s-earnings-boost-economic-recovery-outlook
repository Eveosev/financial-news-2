Asian stocks rose on signs a global
economic recovery may be strengthening after Bank of America
Corp. swung to a profit and Intel Corp. forecast sales that beat
analyst estimates, boosting the earnings outlook for Asia’s
companies.  Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. (8306) , Japan’s largest
lender, advanced 0.9 percent, after Bank of America climbed 10
percent in  New York .  Cnooc Ltd. (883) ,  China ’s largest offshore energy
explorer, rose 1.1 percent after crude rose to the highest price
in more than a month. Suppliers of  Apple Inc. (AAPL) , fell after the
maker of iPhones and iPads posted profit that missed analyst
estimates.  “There’s bound to be some residual optimism because of the
strong gains in the U.S. on the back of some earnings
optimism,” said Will Seddon, who helps oversee more than $300
million at White Funds Management in Sydney. “We’re bound to
see some positive momentum in Asian markets, but the risks with
the European situation are still very, very high.”  The MSCI  Asia  Pacific Index rose 0.9 percent to 117.47 as
of 7:57 p.m. in Tokyo. About two stocks advanced for each that
fell on the gauge. The measure dropped 15 percent this year
through yesterday.  All 10 groups in the Asia-Pacific measure gained after
Intel delivered a sales forecast that beat analyst estimates and
boosted a share buyback program after U.S. markets closed. Intel
shares rose 4.4 percent to $24.44 in afterhours trade, adding to
a 0.5 percent increase in regular trading. Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. advanced 5.5 percent even after reporting its second
quarterly loss in 12 years as the firm lost money on investments
and revenue declined from trading, asset management and
securities underwriting.  U.S. Futures  Banks increased. Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group advanced
0.9 percent to 338 yen.  Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) ,
 Australia ’s biggest lender by market value, rose 1.2 percent to
A$48.01. Australia’s banks are being shielded from the effects
of  Europe ’s debt crisis by rising domestic deposits and demand
for their debt by U.S. funds, Reserve Bank Assistant Governor
 Guy Debelle  said.  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s  500 Index climbed 0.3
percent. In New York, the index rose 2 percent to the highest
level since August yesterday after the National Association of
Home Builders/Wells Fargo sentiment index climbed to 18, the
highest level since May 2010, the Washington-based group
reported yesterday.  “Some good data flow in the past 24 hours helped support
markets, as has profit reporting in the banking sector,” said
 Stephen Halmarick , Sydney-based head of investment markets
research at Colonial First State Global Asset Management, which
oversees about $145 billion. “Worries about Europe are likely
to persist ahead of the weekend European leaders’ meeting.”  Exporters Gain  Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average gained 0.4 percent.  Hong
Kong ’s Hang Seng Index rose 1.3 percent. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200
rose 0.6 percent, while South Korea’s Kospi Index was up 0.9
percent.  Asian exporters rose with  Canon Inc. (7751) , the camera maker that
gets 81 percent of its revenue abroad, increasing 1.9 percent to
3,475 yen. Korea’s Hankook Tire Co., which makes more than 60
percent of sales overseas, jumped 7.3 percent to 44,200 won in
Seoul.  James Hardie Industries SE (JHX) , a building-materials supplier
that gets 68 percent of sales from the U.S. rose 3.2 percent to
A$5.76.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index declined 15 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with a 2.6 percent drop by the S&P
500 and a 15 percent loss by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Stocks
in the Asian benchmark are valued at 11.8 times estimated
earnings on average, compared with 12.3 times for the S&P 500
and 10.1 times for the Stoxx 600.  France and Germany are engaged in “intensive talks” on
bolstering the European Financial Stability Facility, said
Steffen Seibert, a spokesman for German Chancellor Angela
Merkel.  ‘No Deal’  Seibert declined in an interview to comment on a report in
the Guardian that they reached agreement on increasing the size
of the fund, saying he won’t comment on intermediate results of
the negotiations. A person with direct knowledge of the talks
told Bloomberg News no deal has been reached.  “Markets in Asia will trade rather cautiously given
there’s doubt about the validity of that article,” said  Tim Schroeders , who helps manage $1 billion in equities at Pengana
Capital Ltd. in Melbourne. There’s “a lot of nervousness around
what solution we are likely to see regarding Europe at the
moment. We will see things move a little bit higher in Asia, but
they will remain fragile.”  Spain  Cut Again  Spain’s credit rating was cut for the third time since June
2010 by Moody’s Investors Service as Europe’s sovereign-debt
crisis threatens to engulf the nation. Moody’s reduced Spain’s
ranking to its fifth-highest investment grade, cutting it by two
levels to A1 from Aa2, with the outlook remaining negative, the
rating company said yesterday.  Standard & Poor’s downgraded Spain on Oct. 14 to its
fourth-highest investment grade after Fitch Ratings cut it to
the same level on Oct. 7, the day it also downgraded Italy.  Energy producers rose after crude oil for November delivery
rose $1.96 to $88.34 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  yesterday, the highest settlement price since Sept. 15.
Oil was little changed today.  Cnooc rose 1.1 percent to HK$13.18 in Hong Kong.  Caltex
Australia Ltd. (CTX) , a refiner and distributor of petroleum products,
jumped 5.6 percent to A$13.53.  Apple suppliers slumped. Largan Precision Co., which
supplies camera lenses, lost 6.9 percent to NT$685 in Taipei.
Catcher Technology Co., a casing maker of iPhones, fell 6.8
percent to NT$152. Foxconn Technology Co., which assembles Apple
products, slipped 5.9 percent to NT$104.  Fourth-quarter profit was $6.62 billion, or $7.05 a share,
compared with $4.31 billion, or $4.64 a share, a year earlier,
Cupertino, California-based Apple said in a statement. That
missed analysts’ predicted profit of $7.31 a share, the first
time Apple disappointed in at least 26 quarters.  To contact the reporters on this story:
