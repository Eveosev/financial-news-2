Zeltiq Aesthetics Inc., the
Pleasanton, California-based maker of fat-reduction technology,
climbed as much as 15 percent in Nasdaq trading after raising
$91 million yesterday in an initial public offering.  Zeltiq rose 12 percent to $14.59 at 10:43 a.m. New York
time on the Nasdaq Stock Market after earlier climbing as high
as $15. Yesterday the company, which trades under the symbol
ZLTQ, sold 7 million shares at $13 each, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Zeltiq had cut its  price range  on the shares from a planned
$14 to $16 apiece. At least 70 companies have withdrawn or
postponed U.S. IPOs this year, the most since the comparable
period in 2008, Bloomberg data show. Ubiquiti Networks Inc.
raised $105.6 million last week in the first IPO in more than a
month. Through yesterday, the stock had risen 27 percent since
the offering.  Zeltiq offers a method using so-called controlled cooling
to reduce fat bulges that can’t be eliminated through dieting or
exercise, according to a regulatory filing. The company received
U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval last year to market
the method, called CoolSculpting, for fat reduction on the part
of the body commonly known as “love handles.”  The procedure has also been approved in 46 international
markets, where its use is typically not limited to a specific
body part, according to the filing.  Revenue in the six months ended June 30 more than
quadrupled to $31.6 million from a year earlier, while the net
loss narrowed to $1.4 million from $8.5 million, according to
the filing.  Zeltiq said it plans to use proceeds from the IPO to pay
outstanding licensing fees and for research and development.The
offering was led by  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  and  Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. (GS)   To contact the reporter on this story:
