Monetary policy  is  Latin America ’s
“first line of defense” against further deterioration of the
global economy, Nicolas Eyzaguirre, director of the
International Monetary Fund’s Western Hemisphere department,
said today.  Chile’s central bank is in a good position to control
inflation, he told a conference in Santiago. The strength of
Chile’s fixed-income securities shows the country’s
macroeconomic credibility, the former Chilean finance minister
said. South American countries including Chile, Peru and
Colombia have managed the crisis well, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
