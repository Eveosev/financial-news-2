Cree Inc. (CREE) , a maker of energy-
efficient lighting products, fell the most in nine months after
saying earnings and gross margin this quarter will be below
analysts’ estimates.  Shares of the Durham, North Carolina-based company declined
12 percent to $24.31 in New York, the biggest loss since Jan.
19.  Earnings in the fiscal second quarter will be 25 cents to
28 cents, excluding stock-based compensation, inventory acquired
in the August purchase of Ruud Lighting Inc. and other one-time
items, Cree said in statement yesterday. Analysts had expected
33 cents, the average of 27 estimates compiled by Bloomberg.
Gross margin will be 37 to 38 percent, below the 38.5 percent
analysts had expected.  Cree is facing low demand and pricing pressure for the
company’s light-emitting diodes, and factory utilization remains
low. As long as the global economy remains weak, it may be
difficult for Cree to convince consumers to purchase more-
expensive lighting products, said Jeffrey Bencik, an analyst at
Kaufman Brothers in  New York .  “With the overall global economy in a seriously
compromised situation, you don’t have consumers willing to spend
even $25 on an LED light,” Bencik said. He lowered his price
target for Cree to $19 from $23 and has a “sell” rating on the
shares and owns none.  In the first fiscal quarter ended Sept. 25, Cree reported
revenue of $269 million, compared with $268 million a year
earlier. Net income was $12.8 million, or 11 cents a share.
Earnings excluding certain items were 25 cents a share, compared
with 60 cents a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
