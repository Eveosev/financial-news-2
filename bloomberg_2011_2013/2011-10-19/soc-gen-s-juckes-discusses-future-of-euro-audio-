Kit Juckes, head of 
foreign-exchange research at Societe Generale SA in  London , says
it's hard not to be skeptical about the fate of the euro, but 
"you can't predict that the world will be on the brink of a 
disaster every day." Juckes speaks with Bloomberg's Sara Eisen 
and  Michael McKee  on "Bloomberg On the Economy."    (Source: Bloomberg)  Running time 06:16
