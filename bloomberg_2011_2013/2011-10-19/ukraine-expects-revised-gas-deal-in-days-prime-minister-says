Ukraine’s Prime Minister  Mykola Azarov  said he expects the 2009 gas contract between Russia and
Ukraine to be revised “within a few days” after meeting
yesterday with counterpart Vladimir Putin.  “The talks are nearing the end,” Azarov said in a
 statement  today on the government website. “In a few days we
will be able to approve a compromise.” Putin and Azarov met in
 St. Petersburg , Russia.  Ukraine is seeking to revise the terms of gas-supply
and transit contracts with Russia to help unlock the next
tranche of a loan from the International Monetary Fund.
Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych seeks to cut the price to
$230 per 1,000 cubic meters from next year’s expected average
level of $415.  Azarov and Putin discussed the possibility that Ukraine
make payments for imported gas in Russian rubles, according to
the Ukrainian government statement. NAK Naftogaz Ukrainy,
Ukraine’s state-run energy company, paid more than $867 million
to  Russia  for September gas deliveries.  To contact the reporters on this story:
