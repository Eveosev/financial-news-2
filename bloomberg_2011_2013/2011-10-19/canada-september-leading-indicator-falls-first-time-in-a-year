Canada’s index of leading economic
indicators fell for the first time in a year in September, led
by declines in manufacturing.  The index dropped 0.1 percent, Ottawa-based  Statistics
Canada  said today, while economists surveyed by Bloomberg News
said it would rise 0.1 percent, based on the median of eight
estimates. The average monthly increase over the past decade is
0.4 percent.  Manufacturing categories were three of the four that
declined in September, including a 0.7 percent drop in new
orders of durable goods. The ratio of factory shipments to
inventories declined to 1.90 from 1.92 and the average
manufacturing workweek shrank a fourth month to 36.4 hours.  There are 10 components in the composite index, and six of
them rose on the month. Statistics Canada’s measure of housing
starts and existing home sales rose 1.2 percent, while the
country’s main stock index fell 3.5 percent, the report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
