Gulf Coast gasoline rose after
 ConocoPhillips (COP) ’ Sweeny refinery in Texas and  Valero Energy
Corp. (VLO) ’s Houston plant experienced power failures.  Process units at the Sweeny plant were restarted after the
event occurred yesterday, according to a filing with the Texas
Commission on Environmental Quality. Valero’s steam supply was
interrupted after a power outage, according to a separate filing
from the agency.  The discount for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in the
Gulf Coast narrowed 0.67 cent to 3.13 cents versus futures
traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 11:30 a.m.,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt delivery slid
1.15 cents to $2.6974 a gallon.  Valero is returning the Houston refinery to planned rates
after a power failure yesterday,  Bill Day , a company spokesman,
said in an e-mail.  Oil product prices in the U.S. refining hub may also rise
as refinery workers in Brazil plan to carry out a work slowdown.  Petroleo Brasileiro SA employees and other oil workers in
Brazil plan to carry out a work slowdown today at refineries,
platforms and plants to push for salary increases, said Joao
Antonio de Moraes, head of the union known as FUP.  The discount for ultra-low-sulfur diesel in the Gulf
narrowed 0.38 cent to 0.75 cent a gallon versus futures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
