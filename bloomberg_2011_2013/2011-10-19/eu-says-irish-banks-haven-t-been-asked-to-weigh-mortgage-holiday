Ireland’s banks have not been asked
by the country’s bailout partners “to consider allowing
households temporarily to stop paying their mortgages” to pay
down personal loans, the European Commission said.  “The Irish authorities have made clear and we agree, those
who can service their debts need to continue to do so,” the
European Commission representation in Ireland said in an e-
mailed statement. The Irish Times reported today that the so-
called troika had asked lenders to consider temporary suspension
of mortgage payments to allow borrowers pay down other loans.  To contact the reporter on this story:
