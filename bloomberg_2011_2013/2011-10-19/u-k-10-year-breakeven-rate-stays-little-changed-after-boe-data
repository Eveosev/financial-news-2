U.K. 10-year breakeven rates stayed
little changed after the  Bank of England  released the minutes of
its Oct. 6 policy meeeting.  The measure of investor expectations for inflation over the
duration of the secutity was at 269 basis points at 9:34 a.m.
London time.  Central bank officials voted unanimously to expand the size
of their asset-purchase program as strains related to  Europe ’s
debt crisis created a “compelling” case to add to stimulus,
minutes of the meeting showed today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
