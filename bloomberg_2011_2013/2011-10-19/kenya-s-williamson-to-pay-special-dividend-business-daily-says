Williamson Tea Kenya Ltd. will pay
its shareholders a special dividend in the current financial
year following the sale of its office for 500 million shillings
($5 million),  Business Daily  reported today.  Majority-owned by Ngong Tea Holdings of the U.K.,
Williamson Tea sold its head office in the Kenyan capital to
 Lion of Kenya Insurance Co. , in which it holds a 50 percent
stake, the Nairobi-based newspaper said, citing Managing
Director Alan Carmichael. The company will now rent office space
at a different building in Nairobi, Business Daily said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
