Greek Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos said the government would give “the battle of
battles” to ensure austerity measures are passed and  Greece 
gets additional financing.  “This week we are giving the battle of battles up to
Sunday evening,” Venizelos said in Parliament in  Athens  today,
referring to an EU summit planned for Oct. 23.  He said that without the austerity measures, being debated
in Parliament today, neither the 2011 budget nor the 2012 budget
can be executed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
