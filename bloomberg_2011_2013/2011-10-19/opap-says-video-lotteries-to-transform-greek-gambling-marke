Opap SA (OPAP) ,  Europe ’s biggest publicly-
traded gambling company, said its acquisition of the right to
35,000 video-lottery terminals would transform the Greek market
and add to profit.  Returns from directly-operated VLTs and revenue from those
operated by sub-contractors will be the biggest contributor to
Opap’s earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortization by 2015, according to an e-mailed presentation from
the Athens-based operator today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
