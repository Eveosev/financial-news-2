Intuitive Surgical Inc. (ISRG) , maker of a
robotic system to perform surgery, climbed to a record high
after raising its revenue forecast and reporting third-quarter
profit that beat analyst estimates.  The stock rose 9.2 percent to $417.88 at 4:01 p.m. New York
time, the highest price since the Sunnyvale, California-based
company first sold shares in June 2000.  Third-quarter earnings were $3.05 a share, Intuitive said
in a statement yesterday, beating estimates of $2.76. The
company sees revenue growth of as much as 23 percent this year,
compared with an earlier target of as much as 21 percent.  Intuitive “continues to defy the difficult macroeconomic
and utilization conditions,” wrote  Rick Wise , an analyst for
Leerink Swann, in a note to investors today.  The company makes the da Vinci system, which converts a
doctor’s hand motions into micro-movements inside a patient
during surgery.  To contact the reporter on this story:
