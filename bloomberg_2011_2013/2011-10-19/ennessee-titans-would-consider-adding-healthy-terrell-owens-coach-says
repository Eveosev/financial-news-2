The Tennessee Titans would consider
adding  Terrell Owens  if the former Pro Bowl wide receiver is
healthy enough to pass a physical, coach Mike Munchak said.  The 37-year-old Owens, who ranks second in National
Football League history in career yards receiving and
touchdowns, underwent knee surgery in April and remains a free
agent. Owens’s agent, Drew Rosenhaus, said on his Twitter feed
today that Owens is 100 percent healthy, “immediately available
to visit and work out,” and could play this weekend.  The Titans lost leading receiver Kenny Britt to a season-
ending knee injury on Sept. 25, leaving Nate Washington as their
top wideout.  “Whenever you’ve got a player that has his capabilities,
everyone’s going to know exactly where he’s at,” Munchak said
of Owens yesterday on Nashville radio station  104.5 The Zone .
“If he has a way of helping our team win, then for sure you’re
going to take a look at him.”  Owens spent last season with the  Cincinnati Bengals ,
finishing with 72 receptions for 983 yards and nine touchdowns.
He has 1,078 catches for 15,934 yards and 153 scores over 15 NFL
seasons with the Bengals, Buffalo Bills, Dallas Cowboys,
 Philadelphia Eagles  and  San Francisco 49ers .  To contact the reporter on this story:
