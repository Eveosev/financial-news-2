Greece  should be able to meet its
announced target of raising 4 billion euros from asset sales in
2011, the country’s Economy Minister Mihalis Chrysohoidis said
in an interview with French newspaper  Les Echos .  “The sale of state assets as quickly as possible isn’t an
end in itself, even though we think we’ll be able to meet our
target of collecting 4 billion euros in 2011,” the newspaper
cited Chrysohoidis as saying.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
