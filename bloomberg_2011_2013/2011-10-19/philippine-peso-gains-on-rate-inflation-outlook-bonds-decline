The Philippine peso rose toward a
one-month high on speculation policy makers will favor currency
gains over interest-rate increases as a means of reining in
inflation. Ten-year  government bonds  advanced.  All 17 economists surveyed by Bloomberg predict the central
bank will keep its benchmark overnight rate at 4.5 percent
following a review tomorrow. Policy settings are appropriate and
there is no compelling reason to shift while the government
embarks on a $1.7 billion stimulus program, Bangko Sentral ng
Pilipinas Governor Amando Tetangco said Oct. 16.  “The policy rate is about right given that inflation is
still elevated,” said Arthur Michael de Castro, an analyst at
Bank of the Philippine Islands in Manila. “We are still looking
at a fairly strong third-quarter gross domestic product and more
upside to the peso with support from strong remittances.”  The peso strengthened 0.3 percent to close at 43.158 per
dollar in  Manila , according to Tullett Prebon Plc. The currency
reached 43.115 on Oct. 17, the highest level since Sept. 14. It
may reach 42.2 by year-end, de Castro said.  Inflation threats have receded and the central bank has
“weapons to stabilize the peso,” Monetary Board Member Felipe
Medalla told reporters today in Manila.  Consumer prices rose an annualized 4.8 percent in September
compared with 4.7 percent in August. Inflation was 5.2 percent
in June, the fastest in more than two years.  The yield on the 6.375 percent security due January 2022
fell five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 5.9 percent,
according to Tradition Financial Services.  The nation’s balance of payments surplus narrowed to $719
million in September from $2.72 billion the previous month, the
central bank reported today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
