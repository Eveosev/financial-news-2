Komatsu Ltd. (6301) , the world’s second-
biggest maker of construction and mining machinery, rose in
Tokyo trading as investors bet the stock’s largest drop in two
weeks was overdone.  The shares gained as much as 4.2 percent to 1,813 yen, the
highest since Sept. 8, and were at 1,790 yen as of 12:39 p.m.
local time, up 2.9 percent. Tokyo-based Komatsu slumped 2.4
percent to 1,740 yen yesterday, the most since Oct. 5.  “The stock has priced in negatives such as a hard landing
for the Chinese economy, downward revisions to guidance, and the
emergence of local competitors in  China , and has been
oversold,” Shinji Kuroda, a Tokyo-based analyst at Credit
Suisse Securities  Japan  Ltd., wrote in a report today. “We
maintain our outperform rating” on the stock.  Komatsu may miss its annual operating profit forecast of
305 billion yen ($4 billion) because of declining Chinese sales
and a stronger yen, the Nikkei newspaper reported today, without
saying where it got the information. The economy of China, which
overtook Japan as the company’s largest market in 2009, grew 9.1
percent in the third quarter from a year earlier, the least
since 2009.  Chinese demand will probably decline as much as 10 percent
in the year ending March 2012, compared with an April estimate
of a 15 percent increase, Komatsu spokesman Hiroshi Sunada said
on July 28 after the maker of excavators, wheel loaders and  dump
trucks  posted an 82 percent gain in first-quarter profit.  The company, scheduled to release its first-half earnings
and full-year outlook on Oct. 27, said it wasn’t the source of
the Nikkei report.  Full-year sales are likely to reach 2.1 trillion yen,
compared with Komatsu’s forecast of 2.15 trillion yen, the
Nikkei reported, without saying where it obtained the
information.  To contact the reporter on this story:
