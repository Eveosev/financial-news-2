Greek Finance Minister Evangelos
Venizelos said he expects to see a plan for  Greece ’s growth and
a “substantive” solution to debt issues from a European Union
summit in Brussels on Oct. 23 after lawmakers in Greece approve
new austerity bill.  “We must ask for a final solution that will lead to the
public debt being deemed sustainable, the new support package of
Greece’s economy and all the measures that need to be taken to
return to growth in Greece, to halt the recession,” Venizelos
told lawmakers in  Athens  today, in comments broadcast live on
state-run Vouli TV.  To contact the reporter on this story:
