European Central Bank Executive
Board member Juergen Stark said the ECB doesn’t expect  Italy  to
default, Latvian magazine  Ir  reported, citing an interview.  “It’s not our working assumption,” Stark was quoted as
saying in a transcript of the interview. At the same time, the
country should have fixed its budgets “much earlier,” he said.  The ECB “will not” and “cannot step in,” Stark said
when asked if the central bank would act if the European
Financial Stability Facility proves to be too small to put a
firewall around Italy.  “There is a prohibition of monetary financing” and the
ECB can’t replace governments, Stark said, according to the
transcript. Stark said he hasn’t recommended the ECB’s
government bond purchase program.  To contact the reporters on this story:
