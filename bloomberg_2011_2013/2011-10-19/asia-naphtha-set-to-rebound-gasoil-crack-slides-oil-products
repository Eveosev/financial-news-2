Asia naphtha derivative contracts
were poised to rebound from the lowest in a week. Gasoil’s crack
spread narrowed, signaling decreasing profit for refiners making
the distillate fuel.  Light Distillates  Japan ’s open-specification naphtha forward contracts for
second-half November delivery were bid at $916 a metric ton
against offers at $919 at 12 p.m. Singapore time, according to
data from Ginga Petroleum Singapore Pte, a broker. Yesterday,
the petrochemical feedstock closed at a one-week low of $904.  Naphtha’s premium to London-traded Brent crude futures was
up $1.21 at $67.80 a ton, based on data compiled by Bloomberg.
This crack spread, a measure of processing profit, has shrunk 47
percent so far this month.  Gasoline’s premium to naphtha yesterday declined to $23.40
a barrel, the lowest since Oct. 5, Bloomberg data showed. A
narrower reforming margin means it is less profitable to produce
motor fuel.  Middle Distillates  The premium of gasoil, or diesel, to Asian marker Dubai
crude fell 31 cents to $15.82 a barrel, according to PVM Oil
Associates Ltd., a broker. This crack spread narrowed for the
second time in three days.  Gasoil swaps for November rose $1.50, or 1.2 percent, to
$122.70 a barrel, PVM data showed. Jet fuel’s premium to gasoil
climbed 5 cents to $3.05. This regrade was the highest since Feb.
23, indicating it is more profitable to make  aviation fuel  over
diesel.  Fuel Oil   Fuel oil’s discount to Dubai crude widened 77 cents to
$5.19 a barrel, according to PVM. The gap increased for the
first time in three days, signaling losses are growing for
refiners turning oil into residual products.  November high-sulfur fuel oil swaps advanced $6.75, or 1
percent, to $661 a ton, PVM said. The premium of 180-centistoke
fuel oil to 380-centistoke grade was unchanged after slipping to
$7.50. A narrower viscosity spread shows bunker, or marine fuel,
gained more than higher-quality fuel oil.  To contact the reporter on this story:
