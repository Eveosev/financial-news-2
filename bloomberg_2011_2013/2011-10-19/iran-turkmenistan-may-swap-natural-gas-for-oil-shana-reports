Iran  and Turkmen officials are in
talks on bartering  natural gas  for oil products and will meet in
Ashgabat in two weeks, the Persian Gulf nation’s Oil Ministry
said, citing the head of the National Iranian Gas Export Co.  Iran may take delivery of natural gas at the border with
its northeastern neighbor and deliver crude or oil products in
exchange, National Iranian Gas Export head Hossein Bidarmaghz
said, according to a report today on  Shana , the ministry’s news
website. The Central Asian country currently exports 14 billion
cubic meters of gas a year to Iran, Shana said.  In November, Iran and Turkmenistan started the second phase
of a $1.2 billion pipeline that Iranian officials said may boost
gas shipments to 20 billion cubic meters a year, according to
state media reports at the time.  Turkmenistan  holds the world’s
fourth-largest gas reserves.  To contact the reporter on this story:
