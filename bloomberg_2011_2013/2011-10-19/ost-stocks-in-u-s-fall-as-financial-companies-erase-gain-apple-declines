U.S. stocks fell as financial shares
reversed gains and the euro erased its advance as a split
between France and  Germany  emerged on proposals to increase the
European bailout fund. Apple Inc. led technology shares lower.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slid 0.8 percent to
1,215.71 at 2:08 p.m. in  New York  as financial shares retreated
1.1 percent as a group, reversing an earlier 1.5 percent rally.
More than two stocks fell for each that rose on U.S. exchanges.
The euro was little changed at $1.3762 after climbing 0.9
percent earlier. The S&P GSCI Index of commodities fell 0.8
percent.  European leaders assembled in Frankfurt to narrow divisions
four days before a summit meant to tame the region’s sovereign
debt crisis. France and Germany split on the role of the
 European Central Bank  in boosting the euro rescue fund as banks
lobbied against forced recapitalizations and deeper writedowns
of Greek debt.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
