Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4)  employees and
other oil workers in  Brazil  are implementing a slowdown today at
refineries, platforms and plants to push for salary increases, a
union leader said.  Union members will also meet Oct. 21 to discuss a possible
strike and review wage proposals from Rio de Janeiro-based
Petrobras, as Brazil’s state-run oil company is known, said Joao
Antonio de Moraes, head of the union known as  FUP . Petrobras
said the slowdown won’t affect output.  “It won’t directly affect production, it means working
more slowly,” Moraes said today in a telephone interview.  FUP is demanding a 10 percent wage raise over inflation and
better work and security conditions, the union said Oct. 4.
Petrobras said in an e-mailed statement today it granted a 9.4
percent pay rise in 2010 and is holding “open and permanent”
discussions with union leaders to reach an agreement.  The company is likely to meet with unions between Oct. 24
and Oct. 28, according to the statement. Petrobras produces
about 90 percent of Brazil’s oil.  Petrobras fell 0.6 percent to 19.34 reais as of 3:20 p.m.
in  Sao Paulo  and declined 29 percent this year through
yesterday, compared with the 21 percent slump in Brazil’s
benchmark Bovespa stock index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
