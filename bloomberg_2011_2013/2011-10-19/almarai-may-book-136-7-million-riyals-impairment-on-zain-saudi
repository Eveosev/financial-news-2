Almarai Co.,  Saudi Arabia ’s largest
food producer by market value, may book an impairment of 136.7
million riyals ($36.5 million) on its investments in Zain Saudi,
Chief Financial Officer Paul-Louis Gay said.  The original value of Almarai’s investment was about 270
million riyals to 280 million riyals, and the impairment
represents about 40 percent of that, he said in phone interview
from Dubai today.  “From what we know, the share price will go up if they
find a solution for their capital restructuring plan, which is
not likely to be honest,” he said. Almarai bought Zain Saudi
shares for 10 riyals a share, Gay said.  Kingdom Holding Co. (KINGDOM) , controlled by Saudi billionaire Prince
Alwaleed and  Bahrain Telecom Co. (BATELCO)  last month abandoned a plan to
buy 25 percent in Zain Saudi, the kingdom’s third-largest
mobile-phone company by market value, for $950 million from
Kuwait’s Zain Group. The deal fell through because
lenders refused to transfer debt guarantees from Zain to
purchasers, Al Watan newspaper reported on Oct. 4, citing Zain
Saudi’s Chairman Prince Hussam al-Saud.  Zain Saudi shares have dropped 26 percent this year and
closed 1.7 lower at 5.75 riyals in  Riyadh  today.   To contact the reporter on this story:
