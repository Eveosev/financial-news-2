European Commission President  Jose
Barroso  said the  European Central Bank ’s purchases of sovereign
bonds since May 2010 have been “critical” in fighting the
euro-area debt crisis.   “The decisive intervention of the ECB in the secondary
 bond market  was, and still is, a critical element in securing
financial stability,” Barroso said today in  Frankfurt . He spoke
at a ceremony honoring ECB President  Jean-Claude Trichet , whose
term ends on Oct. 31.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
