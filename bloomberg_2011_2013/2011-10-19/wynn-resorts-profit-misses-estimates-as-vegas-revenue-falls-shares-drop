Wynn Resorts Ltd. (WYNN) , operator of the
Wynn and Encore casinos, reported third-quarter profit that
missed analysts’ estimates as  Las Vegas  baccarat revenue
declined. The shares fell in extended trading.  Net income totaled $127.1 million, or $1.01 a share,
compared with a loss of $33.5 million, or 27 cents, a year
earlier, Las Vegas-based Wynn said today in a statement. Profit
excluding some items was $1.05 a share, missing the $1.19
average of 24 analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Las Vegas has had an uneven recovery from a record two-year
drop in gambling and conventions, with casino gambling revenue
on the  Las Vegas Strip  falling 8.7 percent in August on a drop
in baccarat. Wynn missed the analysts’ third-quarter estimates
because of the annual difference in baccarat winnings, said
Carlo Santarelli, director of gaming and lodging research at
Deutsche Bank Securities Inc.  “Last year, they had a win percentage of 22.8 percent, and
this year it was 18.3 percent in the third quarter,” Santarelli
said in a phone interview.  Wynn’s net casino revenue in Las Vegas declined 8.3
percent, according to the statement today. Macau, where Wynn
generates more than 70 percent of its sales, is experiencing
rapid growth. Wynn opened Encore Macau in April 2010, doubling
its presence in the world’s largest casino market.  Cash Flow   Third-quarter cash flow, or adjusted property earnings
before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, jumped 39
percent to $381.1 million, beating the $373.2 million estimate
of analysts.  Wynn Resorts fell as much as 9.2 percent to $120.33 in
extended trading after results came out. The stock retreated 5.4
percent to $130.27 at the close in New York.  Wynn Macau Ltd. (1128) 
fell 4.1 percent to HK$19.56 in  Hong Kong .  Overall, Wynn’s revenue rose 29 percent to $1.3 billion,
meeting analysts’ projections. In Macau, sales jumped 42
percent. Gambling in that market this year has surged 46 percent
through September.  Wynn’s revenue increased 3.7 percent in Las Vegas, the
biggest U.S. gambling market. The company said its Las Vegas
average daily room rate rose 14 percent to $240 in the third
quarter. Occupancy rose to 88.3 percent from 87.8 percent a year
earlier.  (Wynn Resorts began a conference call at 4:30 p.m. New York
