Marfrig Alimentos SA (MRFG3)  Chief Executive
Officer Marcos Antonio Molina dos Santos boosted his stake in
 Latin America ’s second-largest beef producer to 45 percent after
the stock lost almost half its value.  MMS Participacoes SA, the holding company controlled by
Molina and his wife, Marcia Marcal dos Santos, hold 156.2
million shares of Marfrig, according to a statement today. That
compares with 43.5 percent, or 150.9 million shares, held on
Aug. 16, according to information on the company’s website.  The share purchases were motivated by his “confidence in
the company’s solid fundamentals and its significant potential
to create value,” Molina, who is also Marfrig’s chairman, said
in the statement. Based on yesterday’s closing price, MMS
Participacoes paid about 39 million reais ($22 million) to buy
the shares.  Marfrig, based in  Sao Paulo , said Oct. 13 it is merging
administrative services to cut costs and regain investor
confidence. The company fell 40 percent in three days in early
August after Sao Paulo-based GWI Asset Management cut its stake.
GWI, which once held 5.22 percent of Marfrig, closed some funds
after  Brazil ’s benchmark Bovespa index dropped 20 percent from
its November peak.  Marfrig directors also bought shares of the company in the
past month. The company’s directors currently own 69,500 shares,
or less than 1 percent, from 58,600 shares on Aug. 16, according
to information posted on its website.  Marfrig rose 2.7 percent to close at 7.61 reais in Sao
Paulo. The stock has slumped 51 percent this year, compared with
a 21 percent decline in the Bovespa index.  JBS SA (JBSS3)  is Latin America’s largest beef producer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
