Gold prices, down 14 percent since
touching a record in September, are poised for more losses,
according to  technical analysis  by Steel Vine Investments LLC.  Bullion’s advance from the Sept. 26 low of $1,535 an ounce
to a high of $1,696.80 on Oct. 17 created a so-called bear flag
pattern where price movements resemble an inverted flag,
according to Spencer Patton, the Chicago-based chief investment
officer for Steel Vine.  The metal’s plunge from a record $1,923.70 on Sept. 6 to
the low on Sept. 26 created the so-called flag pole. Losses in
the past three sessions signal the completion of the pattern,
and that prices will resume their decline, Patton said. Gold may
drop to $1,550 by the first week of November, he said.  “The market has decisively broken out of this pattern,”
Patton said in a telephone interview yesterday. “Gold looks
weak in the near term.”  Yesterday, gold futures for December delivery fell 0.4
percent to settle at $1,647 on the Comex in  New York . The
precious metal has slumped 2.1 percent this week after
retreating 11 percent last month, the most since October 2008.  The bear flag pattern is signaled after a break occurs
below a rising trading range.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporter for this story:
