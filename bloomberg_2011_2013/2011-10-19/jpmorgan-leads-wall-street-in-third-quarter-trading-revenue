JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) , the biggest
U.S. bank by assets, had the most third-quarter trading revenue
of any Wall Street firm that has reported results so far,
leading the pack for the fourth consecutive period.  The bank led by Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, 55, has supplanted  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  as No. 1 in
revenue from buying and selling bonds, stocks, currencies,
commodities and derivatives, according to company reports.
JPMorganâ€™s trading revenue was more than triple that of  Bank of
America Corp. (BAC) , the second-biggest U.S. lender by assets.  The table below details third-quarter and nine-month
trading revenue reported by Bank of America,  Citigroup Inc. (C) ,
JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs and  Morgan Stanley (MS)  this month. The
figures exclude so-called debt-valuation adjustments, accounting
gains or losses that banks record when the value of their own
bonds falls.  All the firms are based in New York except Bank of America,
with headquarters in Charlotte, North Carolina.  To contact the reporter on this story:
