European policy makers can help end
the debt crisis through an orderly Greek default, interest-rate
cuts, further bond purchases and a bigger rescue fund, said
Steven Cochrane, head of economic research at Moody’s Analytics.  “Our expectation is that there’s no way for  Greece  not to
default,” Cochrane said at an event today in Limassol, Cyprus.
“Our assumption that we have fed in our forecast for the
European economy is that bondholders of Greek debt will be
taking a haircut of about 60 percent.”  Policy makers should ensure that the default remains
orderly, Cochrane said, adding that it may happen “sometime
next year when the economy might be in stronger shape to survive
the event.”  Cochrane also called for the  European Central Bank  to
continue buying Spanish and Italian  government bonds  to help
boost consumer and investor confidence and keep yields below the
“survival rate” of 6 percent. The ECB should also reverse this
year’s interest-rate increases, he said.  “The risk of inflation is much less than that of a
downturn in the economy,” Cochrane said.  He also called for increasing by as much as fivefold the
firepower of the euro area’s temporary rescue fund, the European
Financial Stability Facility. A 2 trillion-euro ($2.8 trillion)
EFSF “is not an unfair figure,” he said. “What is needed is
that there are resources to cover the entire area,” including
Spain and  Italy .  New-York based  Moody’s Analytics  offers risk management
