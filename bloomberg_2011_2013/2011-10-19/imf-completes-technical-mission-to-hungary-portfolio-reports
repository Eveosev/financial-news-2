A “technical” mission from the
 International Monetary Fund   has completed its work in  Hungary 
and handed proposals to the government,  portfolio.hu  reported
yesterday, citing IMF country representative Iryna Ivaschenko.  The assistance had been requested by Hungary and wasn’t
done at the fund’s own initiative, the news portal said, citing
Ivaschenko.  A routine IMF mission for Hungary’s Article IV review will
visit Budapest in November, Ivaschenko told the portal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
