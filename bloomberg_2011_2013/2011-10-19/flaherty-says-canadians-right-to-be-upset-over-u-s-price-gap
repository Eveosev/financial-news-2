Canadian Finance Minister  Jim Flaherty  said consumers are justified in being upset by lower
prices for products in the U.S. even though the country’s dollar
is trading near parity with the greenback.  “Canadians are rightly annoyed and perplexed when they see
price discrepancies on the exact same products being sold on
different sides of the border, be they clothing for their
children, tools for their work, or vehicles for their day-to-day
travels,” Flaherty told a Senate committee hearing studying the
matter, according to a prepared copy of his statements provided
by his office.  The Bank of Montreal estimated in an April report that the
price gap between Canadian goods and U.S. goods has widened to
more than 20 percent on a selection of “typical” goods.  To contact the reporter on this story:
