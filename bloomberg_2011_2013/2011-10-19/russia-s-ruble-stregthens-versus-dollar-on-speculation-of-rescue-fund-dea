The ruble appreciated against the
dollar for the first day this week on speculation France and
 Germany  have agreed to boost a rescue fund for the European
Union,  Russia ’s largest trading partner.  The Russian currency strengthened 0.7 percent to 31.0200
per dollar at the 7 p.m. close in Moscow, its first gain since
Oct. 14. The ruble was 0.1 percent weaker at 42.80 per euro,
leaving it 0.2 percent higher at 36.3210 against the central
bank’s target dollar-euro basket.  The London-based Guardian reported that Germany and France
support quadrupling the size of  Europe ’s rescue fund, a sign
demand for Russia’s exports may recover in the region. Urals
crude, the country’s main oil blend, advanced 0.9 percent to
$112.45 per barrel yesterday.  “External factors are playing the key role,” Maxim Oreshkin, the Moscow-based chief strategist for Russia and the
former  Soviet Union  at Credit Agricole CIB, said by e-mail.
“Markets everywhere have jumped on these rumors.”  Investors pared bets the ruble would weaken further, with
non-deliverable forwards showing the currency at 31.4757 per
dollar in three months.  Russia’s $3.5 billion of bonds due 2020 advanced, pushing
the yield down 15 basis points, or 0.15 percentage point, to
4.596 percent. The yield on dollar debt due 2015 lost 12 basis
points, to 3.203 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
