SodaStream International Ltd. (SODA)  fell
for a sixth day, the longest losing streak since its initial
share offering, following  Green Mountain Coffee Roasters Inc. (GMCR) ’s
retreat to the lowest level in five months.  Shares of the Israeli producer of homemade soda machines
that sold shares on Nov. 2 dropped 4 percent to $31.54 by 4 p.m.
in New York.  Green Mountain  has declined 24 percent over the
past three days after hedge-fund manager  David Einhorn  said the
largest U.S. seller of single-serve coffee makers should improve
its financial reporting. The Bloomberg Israel-US 25 Index of the
largest Israeli companies traded in New York slipped 1.1 percent
to 85.43.  “Green Mountain is down following Einhorn’s comments and
SodaStream is following the same sentiment,” said Josef Schuster, founder of Chicago-based IPOX Schuster LLC, which
oversees about $2.5 billion. “These consumer type companies
tend to trade together.”  Einhorn said the market for Green Mountain’s Keurig single-
cup brewers is “limited” and the company faces patent
expirations.  “I believe the available market is smaller than the bulls
believe it to be and that Green Mountain has already penetrated
a good chunk of it,” Einhorn, president of Greenlight Capital
Inc., said on Oct. 17 during a presentation at the Value
Investing Congress in  New York . “The market is limited.”  Green Mountain shares fell 15 percent to $69.80 today, the
most in more than a year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
