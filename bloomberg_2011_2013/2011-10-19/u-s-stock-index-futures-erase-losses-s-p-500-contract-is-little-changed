U.S. stocks fell, following
yesterday’s rally for benchmark gauges, amid concern about the
strength of the economy and an impasse over European bailout
talks, while  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  tumbled on disappointing results.  Apple slumped 5.6 percent, the biggest decline since
December 2008, after profit missed estimates for the first time
in at least six years.  Alcoa Inc. (AA)  and DuPont Co. slid more than
2.6 percent, pacing losses in companies most-dependent on
economic growth.  Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  and  Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC) 
dropped at least 2.6 percent, reversing earlier gains.  The S&P 500 decreased 1.3 percent to 1,209.88 at 4 p.m. New
York time. The benchmark gauge yesterday rose to the highest
level since August. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  dropped
72.43 points, or 0.6 percent, to 11,504.62 today.  “Time is running out for  Europe ,” Paul Zemsky, the New
York-based head of  asset allocation  for ING Investment
Management, said in a telephone interview. His firm oversees
$550 billion. “The longer it waits to fix itself, the more
uncertainty there is. In the U.S., earnings are not bad, but
we’re seeing a bit of erosion in positive surprises. We set the
top of the range on the  S&P 500 . It would take a lot of good
news to get through 1,230.”  The S&P 500 rose from the threshold of a  bear market  early
this month amid optimism over earnings and steps by European
leaders to support banks. The rebound brought the gauge close to
the top of a price range between 1,074.77 and 1,230.71, where
it’s traded for more than two months. The S&P 500 briefly
climbed above that range yesterday, reaching 1,233.10.  Rescue Fund  Global stocks fell as France and Germany split on the role
of the  European Central Bank  in leveraging a rescue fund as
banks lobbied against forced recapitalizations and larger
writedowns of Greek debt. French President Nicolas Sarkozy flew
to Germany to join the talks as leaders assembled in Frankfurt
in an effort to narrow divisions before an Oct. 23 summit.  In the U.S., the  Federal Reserve  said  consumer spending 
rose slightly last month and the economy maintained its
expansion, even as companies reported more doubt about the
strength of the recovery.  “Overall economic activity continued to expand in
September, although many districts described the pace of growth
as ‘modest’ or ‘slight,’” the Fed said in its Beige Book survey
released today in Washington. “Contacts generally noted weaker
or less certain outlooks for business conditions.”  The  Morgan Stanley (MS)  Cyclical Index of companies most-tied to
the economy lost 1.7 percent. The Dow Jones Transportation
Average, a proxy for the economy, fell 1.3 percent. Alcoa slid
3.7 percent to $9.77, while DuPont fell 2.6 percent to $43.80.  Banks Reverse Rally  The KBW Bank Index slumped 2.9 percent after rising 1
percent earlier today. Bank of America dropped 3.6 percent to
$6.40. Wells Fargo declined 2.6 percent to $25.18.  Comerica Inc. (CMA) 
slumped 11 percent to $23.13 and  M&T Bank Corp. (MTB)  decreased 5.6
percent to $72.79 after reporting that net interest margins
declined in the third quarter.  Apple tumbled 5.6 percent to $398.62. The world’s largest
technology company sold 17.07 million iPhones, less than the 20
million projected by analysts surveyed by Bloomberg, as
consumers held out for the iPhone 4S, released after the close
of the period that ended Sept. 24.  Stocks rose earlier today as data showed that builders
began work on more U.S. homes than forecast in September and
consumer prices climbed at the slowest pace in three months.  “The U.S. housing data is helpful,”  Peter Jankovskis , who
helps manage about $2.4 billion at Oakbrook Investments in
Lisle, Illinois, said in a telephone interview. “That is one
big hurdle that the economy needs to overcome. Apple’s figures
are not too big of a shock and other names surprised on the
upside. It’s shaping up to be a very good earnings season.”  Earnings Season  Profit for S&P 500 companies will climb 17 percent in the
third quarter and rise 18 percent to a record $99.88 for all of
2011, according to analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.
About three quarters of the S&P 500 companies that reported
results since Oct. 11 beat analysts’ estimates.  Intel Corp. (INTC)  rose 3.6 percent to $24.24. The world’s biggest
chipmaker forecast fourth-quarter sales that exceeded some
analysts’ estimates, citing strong demand for  laptop computers 
in emerging markets. Yahoo! Inc. gained 3 percent to $15.94
after demand for advertising helped third-quarter profit top
analysts’ forecasts.  Travelers Cos. rallied 5.7 percent, the most in the Dow, to
$54.39, after the insurer reported an increase in third-quarter
policy sales and said it was raising rates for clients.  Staying Away  Speculators are staying away from U.S. stocks even though
the economy is rebounding and risk is easing, according to
Pierre Lapointe, Brockhouse & Cooper Inc.’s global strategist.
He reached that conclusion by tracking the gap between the
number of E-mini S&P 500 futures that smaller investors own and
the number sold short, a bet on lower stock prices.  Short sales exceeded so-called long positions by 299,465
contracts last week, according to data compiled by the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission. The net short position was close to
an Aug. 30 peak of 323,296 contracts -- the most since September
2007, just before a five-year  bull market  in stocks ended.  “Speculators are keeping their guard up,” Lapointe, based
in Montreal, and Alex Bellefleur, a financial economist, wrote
two days ago in a report. The reluctance bodes well for stocks,
the report said, as prices have yet to reflect more favorable
economic data and investors’ growing appetite for risk.  To contact the reporter on this story:
