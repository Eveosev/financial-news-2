Oil dropped a second day as Europe
struggled to tame its debt crisis and the  Federal Reserve  said
companies were increasingly pessimistic about the  U.S. economy ,
stoking speculation commodities demand may falter. Brent’s
premium to  New York  prices widened.  December futures fell as much as 1 percent, extending
yesterday’s 2.5 percent slump. U.S. fuel use declined 2.2
percent to the lowest since May last week while crude stockpiles
shrank, the Energy Department said. A French-German split over
Europe’s rescue strategy emerged as finance ministers prepare to
meet and the Fed said yesterday that U.S. companies reported
more doubt about the strength of the nation’s recovery.  “The market rejected the sizable draw in inventories and
decided to focus on what’s happening with Germany and France,”
said  Jonathan Barratt , a managing director of Commodity Broking
Services Pty in Sydney. “The disagreement put the cat among the
pigeons. Economic growth will be hurt even further because
there’s no resolution out of  Europe .”  Crude oil for December delivery, the most actively traded
contract, slipped as much 88 cents to $85.41 a barrel and was at
$85.93, in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  at 2:25 p.m. Singapore time. The contract yesterday
fell $2.24 to $86.29, the lowest since Oct. 13. November
futures, which expire today, were at $85.65.  Brent oil for December settlement was at $108.13 a barrel,
down 26 cents, on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange.
That pushed the spread between the December Brent and Nymex
crude contracts to $22.29, compared with $22.10 yesterday and a
record high of $27.88 on Oct. 14.  Fuel Demand  U.S. fuel use fell 2.2 percent to 18.3 million barrels a
day last week, the least since May, the Energy Department said
yesterday in its weekly report. Crude stockpiles dropped 4.73
million barrels to 332.9 million. They were forecast to rise 2
million, according to the median of 13 analyst estimates in a
Bloomberg News survey.  Gasoline inventories declined 3.32 million to 206.3
million. They were forecast to slide 1.5 million, according to
the survey. Supplies of distillate fuel, a category that
includes oil and diesel, decreased 4.27 million barrels compared
with an estimate for a 1.5 million decline.  Oil prices  have dropped 6.2 percent in New York this year
amid concern that the faltering U.S. economy and Europe’s debt
crisis will curb raw material demand. Luxembourg Prime Minister
 Jean-Claude Juncker , who chairs a group of euro-area finance
ministers, indicated an impromptu meeting of European leaders in
 Frankfurt  last night failed to resolve differences over the
region’s rescue plan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
