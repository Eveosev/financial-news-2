INA Industrija Nafte d.d.,  Croatia ’s
largest refiner, will probably resume trading in the near future
as the company has fulfilled most of the market regulator’s
demands.  “Most of our requests have been fulfilled, and we expect
the rest will be fulfilled shortly,” market regulator  Hanfa 
said today in an e-mailed reply to questions from Bloomberg
News. “We expect to lift the trading ban as soon as all
conditions are met.”  Hanfa on July 29 extended a trading suspension of the
shares on the Zagreb stock exchange, demanding the company
change its rules dealing with dispersing privileged information.  The Croatian refiner is controlled by Hungary’s Mol Nyrt.,
which owns 47.47 percent of INA. The government holds 44.84
percent. The company’s stock has been suspended from trading
since April over various demands by the regulator.  To contact the reporter on this story:
