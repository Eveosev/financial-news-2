Pakistan ’s economy may expand slower
than forecast after floods devastated the nation’s southern
region, a finance ministry official said.  The economic growth rate may be 0.5 percentage point lower
than the government target of 4.2 percent according to initial
estimates, the official, who was speaking to reporters in a
background briefing, said in Islamabad today.  Policy makers in Pakistan aim to boost economic growth from
2.4 percent last year, one of the lowest expansions in the past
decade. Floods in August forced more than one million people
from their homes and damaged crops in the southern Sindh
province that was still recovering from last year’s worst ever
monsoon inundations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
