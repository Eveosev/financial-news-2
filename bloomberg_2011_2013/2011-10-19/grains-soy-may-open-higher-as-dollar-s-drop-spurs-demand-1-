What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Corn futures are called to open 2 cents to 4 cents a bushel
higher on the  Chicago  Board of Trade on speculation that
European leaders will take steps to ease the region’s debt
crisis, driving the dollar lower and spurring commodity demand,
 Mark Schultz , the chief analyst at Northstar Commodity
Investment Co. in  Minneapolis , said in a telephone interview.  -- Wheat futures may open 3 cents to 5 cents a bushel higher on
the CBOT, the Kansas City Board of Trade and the  Minneapolis
Grain Exchange  as the dollar’s decline enhances the appeal of
U.S. exports, Schultz said.  -- Soybean futures may open steady to 2 cents a bushel higher in
Chicago on speculation that the global economy will rebound,
boosting demand for the oilseed, Schultz said. Soybean-oil
futures are expected to open steady to 0.1 cent higher, and
soybean-meal futures may open up 50 cents to $1 for 2,000
pounds.  To contact the reporters on this story:
