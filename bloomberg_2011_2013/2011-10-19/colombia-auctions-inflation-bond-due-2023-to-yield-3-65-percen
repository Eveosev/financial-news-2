Yields on  Colombia ’s inflation-
linked peso bonds due February 2023 fell to 3.65 percent at the
government’s last competitive auction this year.  The yield on the securities, known as TES UVR, declined
from 3.78 percent at the previous auction on Aug. 17.  The yield on debt due May 2017 fell to 3.19 percent from
3.35 percent, while the government sold its February 2015
securities to yield 2.84 percent from 3.11 percent, the  Finance
Ministry  said in a statement. Demand for the three securities
equaled 680.6 billion pesos ($358 million), more than three
times the 175 billion pesos offered, the ministry said in the
statement.  Colombia has no plans to begin meeting its 2012 financing
needs by auctioning more local bonds, known as TES, after it
completes this month its annual plan to auction 18 trillion
pesos worth of the securities, Public Credit Director German Arce said in an interview last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
