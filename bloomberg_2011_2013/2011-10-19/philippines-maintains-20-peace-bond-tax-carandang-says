The Philippine government is
sticking to its position that 35 billion pesos worth of bonds
due yesterday were subject to a 20 percent tax on interest
income, President  Benigno Aquino â€™s spokesman Ricky Carandang
said in a phone interview today.  The government will let the court decide on the issue,
Carandang said. Aquino, Finance Secretary Cesar Purisima and
Budget Secretary Butch Abad discussed the issue in a meeting
today, he said.  The Supreme Court yesterday stopped the government from
imposing and collecting the tax. The court ordered the banks to
withhold the amount and place it in escrow pending resolution of
the case, spokesman Midas Marquez said yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
