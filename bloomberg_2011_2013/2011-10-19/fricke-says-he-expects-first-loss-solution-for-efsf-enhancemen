German Free Democratic Party budget
spokesman  Otto Fricke  said “things point in the direction of a
first-loss model” for the enhancement of the European Financial
Stability Facilty that aims to boost the backstop’s firepower.
Fricke made his comments to reporters today in Berlin, saying he
won this impression after briefings by German Finance Minister
 Wolfgang Schaeuble  today and yesterday in Berlin.  Fricke also said he’s not certain that lawmakers can back
the changes to the EFSF this week because so-called guidelines
related to the overhaul have not yet been received and
parliament needs time to discuss the proposals.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
