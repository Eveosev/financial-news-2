Andritz AG (ANDR) , an Austrian maker of
equipment for pulp and paper producers, rejected a U.S.
supplier’s legal complaint that it stole technology and said it
expects the issue to be resolved in arbitration.  Claims in a U.S. lawsuit filed by Ovalstrapping Inc. are
“unjustified,” Graz-based Andritz said in a statement today.
The Austrian manufacturer said it has replaced Ovalstrapping’s
products with “different technology.”  “Andritz believes that the matter will be clarified in
arbitration,” the company said.  Ovalstrapping, based in Hoquiam, Washington, filed the suit
in U.S. District Court in Tacoma, the engineering company said
in a statement late yesterday. The U.S. manufacturer, which
provides machinery to bundle bales of pulp, said Andritz
“secretly misappropriated Ovalstrapping designs and technology
to create its own line of tying equipment” and  asked  for an
injunction and at least $25 million in damages, according to the
statement.  The case is Ovalstrapping Incorporated and Oval
International v. Andritz AG, U.S. District Court for the Western
District of  Washington , Case No. 3:11-cv-05820.  To contact the reporter on this story:
