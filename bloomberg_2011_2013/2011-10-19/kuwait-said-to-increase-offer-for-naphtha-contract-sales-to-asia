Kuwait Petroleum Corp. offered to
sell naphtha cargoes to  Asia  from December to November at almost
double the premium of supplies for the same period this year,
according to two people involved in the negotiations.  The Kuwait City-based company, the largest Middle East
exporter of refined oil products to Asia, is offering Full-Range
naphtha for December 2011 to November 2012 at $23.50 a metric
ton above benchmark prices, according to the people, who asked
not to be identified because the discussions are confidential.
The state-owned company has been selling cargoes at $12 a ton
over quotes for December 2010 to November 2011 and most recently
agreed to receive an $18.50 premium for shipments from August
2011 to July 2012.  Two telephone calls to Kuwait Petroleum’s international
marketing department were not answered. The company supplies
naphtha, used to make petrochemicals or gasoline, under one-year
contracts that begin in April, August and December.  Potential buyers, including traders and petrochemical
companies from  Japan  and  South Korea , will make bids today at
premiums of about $14 to $15 a ton, the two people said.  Kuwait is among 12 members of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries, which pumps about 40 percent of the world’s
crude.  To contact the reporter on this story:
