European Aeronautic, Defence & Space
Co. said its defense unit acquired SurveyCopter for an
undisclosed price to help it develop tactical and light unmanned
aerial vehicles.  Surveycopter, based in  France  and  Switzerland  and a partner
of EADS’s Cassidian defense unit since 2003, makes robotics and
autopilot technologies that specialize in vertical takeoff and
landing, Cassidian said in an e-mailed statement. The
acquisition will help Cassidian build up its expertise in light
and tactical UAVS, the company said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
