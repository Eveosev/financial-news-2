Chile  has an “almost
unprecedented” opportunity to grow along with Asian demand for
raw materials, said Nicolas Eyzaguirre, director of the
International Monetary Fund’s Western Hemisphere department.  Asian commodity demand will help drive growth among Chile’s
middle income earners, Eyzaguirre, a former Chilean finance
minister, told a conference in Santiago today.   While Chile has solid macroeconomic policies, it also has
problems with social issues such as education costs and has an
opportunity to make structural reforms, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
