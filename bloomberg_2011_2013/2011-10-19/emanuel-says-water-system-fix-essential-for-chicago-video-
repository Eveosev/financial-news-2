Chicago  Mayor  Rahm Emanuel  speaks 
about his plan to replace the city's water mains and sewers that
date to 1886.  Emanuel, speaking at a news conference on Oct. 14, said the
project will create 18,000 jobs over the next 10 years. About

planned increase in Chicago's water rates. (Source: Bloomberg)  Running time 01:47
