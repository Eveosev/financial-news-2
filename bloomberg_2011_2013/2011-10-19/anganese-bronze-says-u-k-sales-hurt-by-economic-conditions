Manganese Bronze Holdings Plc, a
manufacturer of London black taxis, said U.K. revenue fell in
the third quarter as the economy slowed while international
sales almost tripled.  Revenue in the three months ended Sept. 30 declined 8.6
percent compared with a year earlier, the company said in a
Regulatory News Service statement today. Year to date U.K. sales
fell 7.5 percent to 1,174 vehicles. U.K. revenue in the second
half is likely to be down compared with the first half, the
company said.  International sales almost tripled to 217 vehicles boosted
by an order secured in March to supply cabs to  Azerbaijan .
Orders for 2011 stood at 1,329 vehicles, ahead of the 1,000-unit
target set at the start of the year, the company said.  The company is making “good progress” with Geely
Automobile Holdings Ltd., its Hong Kong-based partner, on
developing a business plan to introduce Geely’s products in the
U.K., according to the statement.  Manganese Bronze shares closed unchanged at 35 pence in
London trading, giving the company a market value of 10.7
million pounds ($16.9 million).  To contact the reporter on this story:
