(Corrects Stumpf’s first name in first paragraph.)  U.S. Senator  Richard Durbin  is
asking  Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC)  Chief Executive Officer John Stumpf to
defend the bank’s decision to impose new fees for debit-card
users in light of the record quarterly profits reported Oct. 17.  Durbin, the Illinois Democrat who pushed to include caps on
debit-card interchange that banks charge to retailers, made the
comment in a letter to Stumpf dated today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
