Tele2 AB (TEL2B) , Sweden’s second-largest
phone company, aims to become the second-largest carrier in
Norway as well following its acquisition of Network Norway,
Chief Executive Officer Mats Granryd said in an interview.  “Our acquiring Network Norway and becoming a clear number
three will drive more price stability into the market,”
Granryd said in an interview. “We have the clear ambition to
become the number two player in Norway. That’s going to take
several years, obviously. We’re going from six or seven percent
to 15 percent or so, so scale and stability in the market will
help us.”  TeliaSonera AB (TLSN) ’s NetCom is currently the second biggest
wireless carrier in Norway after  Telenor ASA. (TEL)   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
