President  Jean-Claude Trichet  said the bank will continue
focusing on its primary inflation-fighting mandate.  “Whatever the future holds, you can be sure that the ECB
Governing Council will continue to be faithful to its primary
mandate,” Trichet said during a speech in Frankfurt today. The
ECB “will continue to be an anchor of stability and of
confidence.”  Trichet said  Mario Draghi  will be a “great success” as
ECB president.  To contact the reporter on this story:
