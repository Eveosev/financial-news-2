Irish Energy Minister Pat Rabbitte
said that any euro-wide settlement of  Greece ’s debt will
“especially” concern Ireland and  Portugal .  “I don’t know if anybody knows at this stage whether or
not a settlement in the wider eurozone circumstance will be
concluded this weekend or not,” Rabbitte said in the Irish
parliament in Dublin today. “It is a matter that concerns all
the member states and I would suggest especially Portugal and
Ireland. It concerns us especially what terms of settlement are
agreed.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
