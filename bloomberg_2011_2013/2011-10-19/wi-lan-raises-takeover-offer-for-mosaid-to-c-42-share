Wi-Lan Inc. (WIN) , a Canadian patent
licensing firm, raised its unsolicited bid for  Mosaid
Technologies Inc. (MSD)  by 11 percent to about C$532 million ($524.5
million) after Mosaid rejected the first offer.  Wi-Lan increased its cash bid to C$42 a share for Mosaid, a
Canadian semiconductor company, the Ottawa-based bidder said
today in a statement. That compares with a previous offer of
C$38 a share.  Wi-Lan, which first made an offer for Mosaid in August,
said the combination would have more than 4,200 patents that
apply to wireless, consumer electronics and semiconductor
technologies. The transaction would add to Wi-Lan’s adjusted
earnings per share in fiscal 2012, the company said in the
statement.  Mosaid, based in Kanata, Ontario, had rejected Wi-Lan’s
original cash bid. The company advised shareholders in a
statement today not to take any action until further notice as
Mosaid is continuing to discuss options with other parties.  The takeover offer expires Nov. 1.  Mosaid rose C$1.41, or 3.5 percent, to C$42.27 at the close
on the Toronto Stock Exchange. Wi-Lan fell 5 cents to C$6.11.  Bankers working with Wi-Lan include  CIBC World Markets  and
Canaccord Financial Inc. Barclays Capital and GMP Securities are
advising Mosaid.  To contact the reporter on this story:
