The euro pared its gain against the
dollar on concern European leaders will struggle to agree on a
solution to the region’s debt crisis at a summit this weekend.  The 17-nation currency rose earlier today after European
Commission President  Jose Barroso  said a “positive outcome”
was possible at an Oct. 23 meeting of European leaders in
Brussels. Draft guidelines showed planned changes to the
euro region’s bailout fund may allow increased credit lines for
countries such as Italy and Spain.  “The uncertainty in  Europe  remains very high, and
expectations are all over the map,” said  Michael Woolfolk ,
senior currency strategist in New York at Bank of New York
Mellon Corp., the world’s largest custodial bank, with more than
$26 trillion in assets under administration. “It’s quite
remarkable the euro is able to maintain its current level.”  The euro was little changed at $1.3774 at 8:45 a.m. New
York time, after advancing 0.6 percent. The European currency
gained 0.4 percent to 106.08 yen. The dollar appreciated 0.3
percent to 77.04 yen after falling 0.2 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
