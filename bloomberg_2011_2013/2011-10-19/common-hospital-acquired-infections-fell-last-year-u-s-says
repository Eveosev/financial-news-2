The rate of four common infections
acquired in U.S. hospitals dropped in 2010 as health-care
workers took more steps to prevent them, the  Department of
Health and Human Services  said.  The number of hospital patients who caught methicillin-
resistant Staphylococcus aureus, known as MRSA, declined by 18
percent to 21.46 infections per 100,000 people, the government
said today in a  report . Hospitals are on schedule to meet the
department’s goal of reducing hospital-acquired MRSA infections
by 50 percent by the end of 2013, according to the report.  Hospitals also reported a 33 percent reduction in
bloodstream infections caused by the insertion of central lines
as workers took more preventive steps such as hand-washing and
the use of gloves, gowns, caps and masks. A central line is a
tube inserted into a large vein in a patient’s neck or chest.
Surgical-site infections also fell by 10 percent last year,
while urinary-tract infections from catheters declined by 7
percent.  “Hospitals continue to make impressive progress in driving
down certain infections in intensive care units through
implementation of CDC prevention strategies,” Thomas R. Frieden, director of the  Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention , said today in an e-mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
