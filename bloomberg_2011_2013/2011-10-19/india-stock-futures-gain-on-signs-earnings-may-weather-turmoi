Indian stocks climbed for the first
time this week amid speculation corporate earnings will weather
global economic turmoil as U.S. earnings eased concern the
nation’s recovery may be faltering.  Hero Motocorp Ltd., the nation’s biggest motorcycle maker,
surged the most in six weeks after its profit for the quarter
ended Sept. 30 beat estimates as sales reached a record.  State
Bank  of India rose to its highest in more than two weeks after
the nation’s banking secretary D.K. Mittal said the government
will “fully capitalize” the lender by March 31.  The BSE India Sensitive Index, or Sensex, advanced 133.21,
or 0.8 percent, to 16,881.50 at 9:18 a.m. in Mumbai. The S&P CNX
Nifty Index on the National Stock Exchange of India Ltd. gained
0.8 percent to 5,076.70. Its October futures traded at 5,078.95.
The BSE-200 Index increased 0.8 percent to 2,069.62.  Asian stocks rallied after Bank of America Corp. swung to a
profit and  Intel Corp . forecast sales that beat analyst
estimates, boosting the earnings outlook for regional companies.  Overseas investors bought a net 3.98 billion rupees of
local equities on Oct. 18, taking their total investment in
stocks this year to 7.35 billion rupees, according to data on
the  website  of the market regulator. They withdrew a net $2.4
billion in August, the most since October 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
