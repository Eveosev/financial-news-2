Chinese stocks will continue to be
volatile in the next 12 months with investors selling into
rallies, according to BNP Paribas SA.  BNP Paribas recommends Chinese resource producers and
“brand” consumer companies, according to Dorris Chen, head of
 China  research at BNP, said in a report to clients. “With
September new credit of 470 billion yuan lower than expected,
and macro growth deceleration evident in third-quarter numbers,
the coming month is likely to see profit-taking in China after
strong rallies recently,” she said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
