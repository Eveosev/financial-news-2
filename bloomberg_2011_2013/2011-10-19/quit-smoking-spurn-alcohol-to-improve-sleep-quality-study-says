Quitting cigarettes and spurning
alcohol before bed may help remedy poor sleep quality, according
to a study in  Japan .  Pack-a-day smokers get 10 minutes less sleep a night than
non-smokers, researchers at Kyoto’s  Doshisha University  found.
The study of adult men also found that those who consumed at
least 60 grams of alcohol a day, or the equivalent of 1.5 liters
of beer, were likely to wake 1.5 times more during the night
than those who limited intake to less than 20 grams.  The research suggests simple lifestyle changes could yield
longer, more restful sleep, said Atsuko Nakazawa, head of
Doshisha University’s health center. The stimulating effects of
nicotine, tobacco’s addictive component, may delay sleep and
cause nightmares and problems waking, according to the U.S.
 National Sleep Foundation .  “Smokers just have to quit smoking” to improve sleep,
said Nakazawa, who led the study, which was presented at a
scientific meeting Kyoto today. “It’s easier than changing diet,
for example.”  A quarter of Japanese adults smoked in 2009, according to
 Japan Tobacco Inc. (2914) , the world’s third-biggest publicly traded
cigarette-maker. The average price of a pack of 20 cigarettes in
Japan is 400 yen ($5.20), compared with $10.80 in  New York .  Alcohol is a poor sleep aid, according to the sleep
foundation in Arlington, Virginia. The chemical disrupts one’s
ability to enter the deeper, more restful stages of sleep, it
says.  The Doshisha University study involved a survey of 3,256
males ages 30 to 59 years, who slept an average of 6.9 hours in
2007. The data was presented at the  Sixth World Congress of the
World Sleep Federation , which runs Oct. 16 to 20.  To contact the reporter on this story:
