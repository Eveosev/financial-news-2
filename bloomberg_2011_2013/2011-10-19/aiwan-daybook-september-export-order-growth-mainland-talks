Taiwan’s export-order growth may
have slowed to 3.46 percent last month from 5.26 percent in
August, according to the median estimate of 11 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News.  The increase in August was the slowest since October 2009,
as  Europe ’s sovereign-debt crisis, elevated U.S. unemployment
and monetary tightening in  China  clouded the outlook for
Taiwan’s overseas sales of semiconductors and flat-panel TVs.  The island’s Ministry of Economic Affairs is scheduled to
release the data at 4 p.m. in Taipei.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
