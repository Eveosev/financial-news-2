The European Union moved to
guarantee some new bonds sold by energy and transport investors
in a bid to spur the development of cross-border networks needed
for deeper market integration and cleaner growth.  The European Commission proposed to make developers of
priority electricity, natural-gas, road and other projects
eligible as soon as next year for EU backing of their debt, so-
called project bonds. The measure would prepare the way for a 40
billion-euro ($55.2 billion) infrastructure fund planned for
2014-2020, allowing EU debt guarantees to start earlier through
a pilot phase.  To contact the reporter on this story:
