Caterpillar Inc. (CAT) , the world’s
largest maker of construction and mining equipment, won European
Union approval to buy MWM Holding GmbH from  3i Group Plc. (III)   The deal won’t harm competition in the region, the European
Commission said in an e-mailed statement today.  Caterpillar agreed last October to buy the Mannheim,
Germany-based manufacturer of combustion engines for 580 million
euros ($802 million). The regulator opened an in-depth probe
into the deal in May amid competition concerns over so-called
gas-fueled gensets used for electricity production.  “Although Caterpillar of the U.S. is active in the same
field and the combined entity will be a formidable force to
reckon with, the in-depth investigation showed that it would
continue to face competition from a number of companies in
 Europe  and worldwide,” the commission said.  Peoria, Illinois-based Caterpillar plans to close the MWM
deal “before year-end 2011,” it  said  in July. The acquisition
has “a bright future down the road,” said Michael DeWalt,
Caterpillar’s director of investor relations in July.  To contact the reporter on this story:
