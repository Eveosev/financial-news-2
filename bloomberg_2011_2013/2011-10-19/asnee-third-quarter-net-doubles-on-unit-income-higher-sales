National Industrialization Co. (NIC) , the
Saudi petrochemicals maker known as Tasnee, said third-quarter
profit almost doubled because of revenue from subsidiaries and
as product prices rose.  Net income climbed to 725 million riyals from 373 million
riyals a year earlier, the company said in a statement to the
Saudi bourse today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
