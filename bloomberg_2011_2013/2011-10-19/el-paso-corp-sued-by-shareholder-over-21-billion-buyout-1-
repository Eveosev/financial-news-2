El Paso Corp. (EP)  was sued by an
investor claiming a proposed $21 billion Kinder Morgan Inc.
takeover, the energy industry’s biggest transaction in more than
a year, undervalues the company’s shares.  The Pipefitters Local Union No. 537 Trust Funds contends
the El Paso board violated its duty to get the best price for
the stock, according to a Delaware Chancery Court complaint
filed today in Wilmington.  “The merger price negotiated by the board is inadequate
and substantially undervalues El Paso,” which is “a thriving
company that is poised to reward its equity investors,” lawyers
for the funds said in the complaint.  Houston-based El Paso said Oct. 16 it would be bought for
cash and stock to create the largest natural-gas pipeline
network in the U.S.  The lawsuit “has absolutely no merit,” said El Paso
spokesman Bruce Connery in a telephone interview.  The case is Pipefitters Local Union No. 537 Trust Funds v.
Juan Carlos Braniff and El Paso Corp., CA5963, Delaware Chancery
Court (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
