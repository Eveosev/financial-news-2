German Finance Minister  Wolfgang
Schaeuble  hasn’t specified how much additional firepower the
European bailout fund may have, ministry spokesman Martin
Kotthaus told reporters today in Berlin.   There were “no concrete numbers and no concrete numbers
were named” with respect to the European Financial Stability
Facility in meetings with German lawmakers, Kotthaus said. He
said talks haven’t been finalized and negotiators are still in
“intensive discussions” in preparation for the European summit
at the end of this week.    To contact the editor responsible for this story:
