Philippines’ capital flows will
remain supported by domestic fundamentals even as the nation’s
balance of payments surplus narrowed in September, central bank
Governor Amando Tetangco said today.  “We are still running way ahead of our current
projections,” Tetangco said in a mobile phone message. “There
may be some rebalancing of investor portfolio positions going
forward due to uncertainties in the global arena.” The payments
surplus narrowed to $719 million last month compared with $2.72
billion in August, the central bank reported.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
