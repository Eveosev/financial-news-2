  TeliaSonera AB (TLSN)  reported third-
quarter profit that missed estimates because of lower income at
Russian and Turkish associated companies.  Net income declined to 4.86 billion kronor ($735 million),
from 5.99 billion kronor a year ago, Stockholm-based TeliaSonera
said in a  statement  today. Revenue fell 1 percent to 26.6
billion. Analysts had expected profit of 5.24 billion kronor on
sales of 26.7 billion kronor.  TeliaSonera has cut jobs and trimmed expenses in Sweden and
 Finland  as subscribers shift from fixed-line subscriptions to
smartphones, enabling the company to post a margin for earnings
before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of 36.8
percent of sales compared with 36.3 percent last year.  “After four quarters of cost increases, we saw a reduction
of the addressable cost base,” as spending cuts showed an
effect in the third quarter, Chief Executive Officer Lars Nyberg
said in the statement.  The appreciation of the krona against the ruble reduced
returns from  Russia ’s OAO Megafon, and income from Turkcell
Iletsim Hizmetleri AS, in which the Swedish company owns a
stake, was also pared by a  currency devaluation  and a goodwill
impairment in Belarus, TeliaSonera said.  Nyberg reiterated that the company needs to resolve legal
problems involving Turkcell before restructuring Russian and
Turkish holdings together with Altimo, the telecommunications
arm of Russia’s Alfa Group.  To contact the reporter on this story:
