The Dutch central bank will allow
some pension funds failing to meet coverage ratio requirements
one year to comply with a demand that premiums should contribute
to a recovery of the ratio.  The central bank came to its decision as funds would
otherwise be forced to announce “considerable” premium
increases in the coming weeks, it said in a letter on its
website today. Pension funds’ coverage ratio’s are under
pressure from the situation on the financial markets.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
