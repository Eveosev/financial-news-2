Japanese stock futures and
Australian shares fell as an impasse over European bailout talks
sparked concerns about the global economic recovery and the
earnings outlook for Asian exporters.  American depositary receipts of  Sony Corp. (6758) , Japan’s No. 1
exporter of consumer electronics that gets 21 percent of its
sales in Europe, fell 0.9 percent from the closing share price
in Tokyo. Those of  Mitsubishi Corp. (8058) , Japan’s biggest trading
company, slid 0.9 percent after commodity prices dropped. BHP

December closed at 8,755 in Chicago yesterday, down from 8,790
in Osaka, Japan. They were bid in the pre-market at  8,760 in
Osaka at 8:05 a.m. local time. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index
declined 0.5 percent today. New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index fell 0.3
percent in Wellington.  “We remain pretty nervous about  Europe ’s crisis because we
have yet to see a concrete safety-net being established for the
financial system,” said  Mitsushige Akino , who oversees about
$600 million in Tokyo at Ichiyoshi Investment Management Co.
“Pessimism about Europe sets the tone for the market’s
sentiment.”  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.1 percent
today. In New York, the index lost 1.3 percent yesterday as
France and Germany split on the role of the  European Central
Bank  in leveraging a rescue fund as banks lobbied against forced
recapitalizations and larger writedowns of Greek debt.  Leaders’ Summit  French President Nicolas Sarkozy flew to Germany to join
the talks as leaders assembled in  Frankfurt  in an effort to
narrow divisions before an Oct. 23 summit.  Losses in U.S. stocks were limited yesterday after data
showed that builders began work on more U.S. homes than forecast
in September and consumer prices climbed at the slowest pace in
three months. The  Federal Reserve  in its Beige Book survey said
consumer spending rose slightly last month and the economy
maintained its expansion, even as companies reported more doubt
about the strength of the recovery.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index declined 15 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with a 3.8 percent drop by the S&P
500 and a 14 percent loss by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Stocks
