Europe  should drop its unanimous
decision-making principle and shift to a system similar to the
International Monetary Fundâ€™s weighted votes, with an 80 percent
majority required,  Guy Verhofstadt , a former prime minister of
Belgium, said according to La Tribune.  It will be insufficient for European heads of state meeting
in Brussels on Oct. 23 about the sovereign debt crisis to make
the European Financial Stability Facility more flexible without
also boosting its funding and saying they will review the
unanimity rule, La Tribune cited Verhofstadt as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
