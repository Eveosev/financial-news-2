European construction output
increased in August, as gains in countries such as France and
 Portugal  helped offset a German decline.  Construction in the 17-nation euro region grew 0.2 percent
from July, when it advanced a revised 1.8 percent, the European
Union’s  statistics office  in Luxembourg said today. From a year
earlier, output increased 2.5 percent.  In  Germany , Europe’s largest economy, construction output
dropped 1.2 percent from July, when it rose 4 percent, today’s
report showed. French and Portuguese output increased 3.2
percent and 7.6 percent, respectively. The statistics office
didn’t report figures for Ireland,  Greece , Spain or Austria.  In the 27-country EU, output stagnated after rising 0.9
percent in the previous month. Slovenia, Romania and Slovakia
reported the biggest declines in monthly construction output.
The statistics office had previously reported a July monthly
gain of 1.4 percent in the euro region.  To contact the reporter on this story:
