Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. led
 Apple Inc. (AAPL)  suppliers lower after the world’s largest smartphone
maker posted profit that missed analyst estimates for the first
time in at least six years.  Hon Hai, the Taipei-based assembler of iPhones and iPads,
dropped 1.4 percent to NT$73.20 as of 10:18 a.m. in Taipei. The
benchmark Taiex index gained 0.2 percent. TPK Holding Co. and
 Wintek Corp. (2384) , the two largest suppliers of touch panels for
Apple devices, and Foxconn Technology Co., which makes metal
cases, also fell.  Apple posted net income of $7.05 per share for its fiscal
fourth-quarter, missing analysts’ estimates for $7.31 a share.
TPK gets about 50 percent of its revenue from Apple while
Taichung-based Wintek derives more than 60 percent of its sales
from the Cupertino, California-based company, according to
JPMorgan Chase & Co. estimates.  Apple fourth-quarter revenue was $28.3 billion, lagging
behind the $29.6 billion estimate, while shipments of iPhones,
iPads and iPods all missed analyst estimates.  TPK dropped 6.2 percent to NT$542, while Wintek fell 2.1
percent to NT$23.05. Taipei-based Foxconn Technology, a supplier
of metal casings that gets 25 percent of revenue from Apple,
dropped 5.4 percent to NT$104.50.  Catcher Technology Co., with 45 percent of sales from
Apple, lost 6.8 percent to NT$152. Catcher dropped by its daily
limit for a third day after it said Chinese authorities ordered
it to shut a factory because of complaints from residents about
gas emissions.  Apple forecast earnings per share of about $9.30 this
quarter, surpassing analyst estimates for $9.02 per share, with
a revenue forecast of $37 billion, ahead of estimates for $36.8
billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
