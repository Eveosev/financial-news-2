Pick n Pay Stores Ltd. (PIK) ,  South
Africa ’s second-largest grocer, said first-half profit fell 46
percent because of the cost of introducing a customer-loyalty
program and developing a central distribution system.  Net income in the six months through August slumped to 191
million rand ($24 million), or 40 cents a share, from 354.3
million rand, or 75 cents, a year earlier, the Cape Town-based
company said in a stock-exchange statement today. Sales
increased 7.4 percent to 27.1 billion rand.  Pick n Pay opened the first of a network of logistics
centers last year, and started the “smart shopper” loyalty
program, which offers product discounts to members, in March.
The retailer said Oct. 4 that spending on the projects would cut
earnings by as much as half. Sales have been held back as South
Africa’s economic growth slowed to an annual 1.3 percent in the
second quarter from 4.5 percent the quarter before.  “We have seen encouraging turnover growth,” Chief
Executive Officer Nick Badminton said. “However, the
investments we have made in transforming Pick n Pay into a world
class retailer have had a material impact on earnings.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
