China  Pacific Insurance (Group) Co.,
the nation’s third-biggest insurer, fell the most in three weeks
in  Hong Kong  trading after losses from stock investments crimped
earnings.  The stock dropped as much as 8 percent and traded 4.4
percent lower at HK$22.70 as of 11:03 a.m. local time, extending
this year’s decline to 30 percent. The  Hang Seng Index  gained
1.7 percent.  Third-quarter net income excluding non-recurring items fell
36.4 percent from a year earlier, as management expenses and
commissions rose and a 15 percent slump in China’s benchmark
Shanghai Composite Index led to trading and impairment losses,
the company said yesterday.  “Although this does not materially change our fundamental
stock view, weaker headline earnings may result in some short-
term selling pressure,” Barclays Plc analyst Mark Kellock said
in an e-mailed report today.  --Zhang Dingmin. Editors: Andreea Papuc, James Gunsalus  To contact the Bloomberg News staff for this story:
