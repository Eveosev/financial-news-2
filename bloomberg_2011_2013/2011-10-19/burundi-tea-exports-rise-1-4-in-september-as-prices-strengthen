Tea exports from Burundi rose to 574
metric tons in September from 566 tons a year earlier as
international prices for the drink rose, according to Joseph
Marc Ndahigeze, head of the Burundi Tea Board.  Earnings from sales of the leaf increased to $1.6 million
from $1.5 million a year earlier, Ndahigeze said today in an
interview in the capital, Bujumbura. The price of tea rose to
$2.79 per kilogram (2.2 pounds) from $2.62 a kilogram a year
earlier, he said.  Rising fuel prices in the central African country hampered
further exports, Ndahigeze said. Most of Burundiâ€™s tea is
trucked east to  Mombasa ,  Kenya , from where it is shipped.  Burundi relies on tea and coffee to generate 90 percent of
its foreign-exchange earnings, according to the  CIA World
Factbook .  Yields in the East African nation have fallen from more
than 9,000 tons in 2001 because of an insurgency that displaced
small-scale growers, who are responsible for about 80 percent of
production. Overcrowding and a lack of arable land and
fertilizers are also problems for the industry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
