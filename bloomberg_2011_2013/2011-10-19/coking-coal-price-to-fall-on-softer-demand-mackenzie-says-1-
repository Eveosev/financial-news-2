Steelmaking coal prices will fall
below $240 a metric ton by the fourth quarter of 2012 as demand
eases and supply improves following flooding in  Australia ,
forecaster Wood Mackenzie Ltd. said.  “Prices have started to fall from the last quarter and
will continue to decline due to softening demand and the
recovery of supply from flood-hit basins earlier in the year,”
Prakash Sharma, coal market analyst at Wood Mackenzie, said in
an e-mailed statement. “Leading industrial indicators suggest a
sharp deterioration in manufacturing activity - reflected by the
decline in global steel production.”  Contract coal prices settled at $285 a ton for the current
quarter, 10 percent lower than the previous three months, and
after reaching a record following flooding at the start of the
year in Australia, the world’s biggest exporter.  The longer-term demand outlook remains strong, which will
likely trigger further takeover activity in the sector, Sharma
said.  “Demand growth will be led by emerging markets, with Asia
accounting for 75% of global metallurgical coal demand by
2030,” he said. “China and  India  will be key demand drivers,
contributing to 60 percent of Asia Pacific’s total import
demand.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
