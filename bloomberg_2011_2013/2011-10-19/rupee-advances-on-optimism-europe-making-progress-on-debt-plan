India ’s rupee strengthened on
speculation  Europe ’s policy makers will be able to contain the
region’s debt crisis, boosting demand for emerging-market
assets.  The BSE India Ltd.’s Sensitive Index rose 2 percent after
the U.K.’s Guardian newspaper reported that Germany and  France 
had agreed to boost the region’s rescue fund, even as a person
with direct knowledge told Bloomberg News no deal has been
reached. The Dollar Index, which tracks the currency’s
performance against six major trading partners, declined 0.5
percent.  “The rupee is largely moving on the back of the rise in
equities,” said Ashtosh Raina, head of foreign-exchange trading
at HDFC Bank Ltd. in Mumbai. Broad weakness in the dollar has
also benefited the Indian currency, he said.  The rupee advanced 0.3 percent to 49.1525 per dollar in
Mumbai, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Foreign investors bought $81 million more Indian shares
than they sold on Oct. 17 following net purchases of $345
million the previous week, exchange data show.  Offshore forwards indicate the rupee will trade at 49.86 to
the dollar in three months, compared with expectations for a
rate of 50.03 yesterday. Forwards are agreements to buy or sell
assets at a set price and date. Non-deliverable contracts are
settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
