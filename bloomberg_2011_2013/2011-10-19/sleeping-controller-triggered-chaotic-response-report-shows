Two airliners landed in error at
Washington’s  Reagan National  Airport March 23 after the lone
tower controller on a midnight shift fell asleep and regional
officials reacted incorrectly, a U.S. accident investigation
concluded.  As air-traffic managers tried to figure out why nobody was
responding to calls to the airport tower, a regional controller
left pilots of incoming flights operated by  AMR Corp. (AMR) ’s  American
Airlines  and  United Continental Holdings Inc. (UAL) ’s  United Airlines 
with the impression they could land using rules for airports
with unmanned towers, the  National Transportation Safety Board 
said in a report released yesterday.  Government-approved procedures for both carriers did not
list Reagan National as an airport where such a landing was
permitted, the NTSB  report  said. The planes landed without
incident.  In the first official report to result from last spring’s
spate of incidents involving sleeping controllers, the NTSB
blamed the incident at Reagan National on the tower controller’s
fatigue and  Federal Aviation Administration ’s scheduling
practices.  The FAA has since revamped controller scheduling, assigned
at least two controllers to every tower in overnight hours and
revised guidelines for when no one in a tower is responding, the
agency said in a statement.  Nine controllers were reported as sleeping on the job by
the FAA earlier this year. The other cases came to light after
the incident at National.  Four Midnight Shifts  American said its pilots acted properly.  “The FAA has cleared both pilots,”  Andrea Huguely , an
American spokeswoman, said in an interview. “There is no
disciplinary action or anything against them.”  “Our pilots exercised good judgment in managing the
situation they faced that night in  Washington  DC,” Mike Trevino, a spokesman for Chicago-based United, said yesterday.  The FAA supervisor who acknowledged falling asleep at the
airport told investigators he was working his fourth consecutive
midnight shift and his sleep had been disrupted the previous two
days, according to the report.  The supervisor, who was not identified, said he felt
“professionally embarrassed, shocked, panicked, ashamed,” the
NTSB said.  That night, he recalled thinking “I need to throw some
water on my face” because he was so tired. The next thing he
knew he woke up in a daze, the report said.  American Flight 1012 and United Flight 628 landed while he
was asleep. Another controller at a regional air-traffic
facility advised the pilots that uncontrolled landings had been
allowed at Reagan National before and they could decide what to
do, the report said.  Uncontrolled Towers  Pilots are permitted to land at many other airports without
a tower provided they announce themselves on the radio and
follow other precautions.  A supervisor at the regional facility told investigators he
should have ordered the controller to hold the jets rather than
allowing them to land, the NTSB said. The supervisor said he had
no training on how to handle such a situation, the report said.  FAA Administrator  Randy Babbitt  said two days after the
incident that he’d ordered controllers to tell pilots to divert
to other airports if they couldn’t reach the tower.  In the confusion that night, the regional controller also
didn’t clear the American flight to approach the airport, the
NTSB said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
