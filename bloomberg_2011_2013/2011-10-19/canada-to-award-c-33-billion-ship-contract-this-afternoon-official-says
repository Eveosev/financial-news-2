The Canadian government will
announce today the winning bidders in a C$33-billion ($33
billion) procurement project to build ships for the Canadian
Navy and Coast Guard.  Three shipyards -- Davie  Canada , Vancouver-based Seaspan
Marine Corp. and Irving Shipbuilding Inc. of Halifax, Nova
Scotia -- submitted bids in July on the tender, the biggest
government  procurement  in Canadaâ€™s history. The winning bids
will be announced at 4:05 p.m. Ottawa time, the government said
in an e-mailed advisory.  The project consists of two components: one to build 15
warships and six patrol ships, and another to build as many as
eight non-combat vessels, including support ships and a polar
icebreaker.  Davie, which was acquired in July by Upper Lakes Group Inc.
of Toronto, only bid for the non-combat portion, the official
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
