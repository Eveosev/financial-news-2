The pound extended its decline
versus the euro after minutes of the Bank of Englandâ€™s latest
policy meeting showed officials voted unanimously to expand the
size of their asset-purchase program.  The pound weakened 0.4 percent to 87.84 pence as of 9:36
a.m. in  London .  Sterling erased a 0.3 percent gain versus the yen, leaving
it at 120.71 and a 0.4 percent advance against the dollar to
trade little changed at $1.5715.  The nine-member Monetary Policy Committee led by Governor
 Mervyn King  raised the ceiling for so-called quantitative easing
to 275 billion pounds from 200 billion pounds on Oct. 6. All
nine also voted to keep the key rate at a record low of 0.5
percent, according to the minutes of the decision published
in London today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
