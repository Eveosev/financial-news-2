Treasuries rose, snapping a loss
from yesterday, after Moody’s Investors Service cut  Spain ’s
credit rating, adding to concern that  Europe ’s sovereign-debt
crisis is spreading.  Benchmark 10-year rates declined two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 2.16 percent as of 9:30 a.m. in  Tokyo ,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 2.125 percent
security due in August 2021 rose 1/8, or $1.25 per $1,000 face
amount, to 99 21/32.  To contact the reporter on this story:
