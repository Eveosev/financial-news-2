Unilever declared its buyback offer
for its 6 percent and 7 percent preference shares unconditional
and said two major holders didn’t tender their stakes.  Aegon NV (AGN)  accepted the offer, while “the two other major’”
institutional holders elected not to tender their stock,
Unilever said in an e-mailed statement today.  ING Groep NV (INGA)  and ASR Nederland NV plan to reject Unilever’s
offer to buy back preference shares as they seek to get more
money, Dutch newspaper  De Telegraaf  said Oct. 17.  To contact the reporter on this story:
