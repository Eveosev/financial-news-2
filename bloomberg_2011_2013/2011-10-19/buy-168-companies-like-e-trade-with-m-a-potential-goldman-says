U.S. companies will use mergers and
acquisitions to boost growth even amid volatile markets,
creating opportunities for investors to profit from deal
strategies, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said in a note yesterday.  Corporate cash balances grew more than 50 percent between
the fourth quarter of 2007 and the second quarter this year,
stocks are below historic valuation levels and forecasts for
earnings growth have declined, supporting an appetite for M&A,
according to Robert Boroujerdi, Goldman’s co-director of
Americas equity research.  Boroujerdi recommends a portfolio of companies in which
Goldman sees at least a 15 percent chance of deal activity in
the next 12 months, including  Federal-Mogul Corp. (FDML)  and  GenOn
Energy Inc. (GEN)   “We see several drivers that can support appetite for the
‘right’ consolidation opportunities,” New York-based Boroujerdi
said in the note. “For many companies M&A will act as a means
of enhancing growth and margin profiles, diversifying revenue
streams or consolidating weaker competitors.”  Announced M&A volume fell 20 percent in the third quarter
from the previous year, Goldman said. The Standard & Poor’s 500
Index fell 14 percent in that period, the most since 2008, amid
signs U.S. economic growth was slowing and concern the European
debt crisis would spread. The Bloomberg Consumer Comfort Index
dropped to its second-lowest level on record last month.
Volatility was high as well, with a gauge of the intraday change
in the  S&P 500  having an average over the past 30 days of 3.12
on Sept. 12, its highest level since April 2009.  Goldman’s “GSRHACQN” basket of recommendations includes
168 stocks, up from 165 in a March rebalancing. Of those, 51 are
new. The average market value of a company in the basket is $4.2
billion, Goldman said. That compares with a mean of $23.1
billion for stocks in the S&P 500, according to Bloomberg data.  Goldman put the stocks into two categories -- those labeled
as having a 30 percent to 50 percent chance of M&A in the next
12 months according to the firm’s analysts, and those with a 15
percent to 30 percent chance.  Goldman Sachs’s List of Stocks With 30% to 50% Probability of
