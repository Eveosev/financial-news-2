Iraq  seeks $1.5 billion in natural-
gas investments in the country’s next licensing round of energy
rights set for March, a senior petroleum expert on the prime
minister’s advisory commission said.  Gas from the seven or eight concessions to be offered for
bids can be brought to market as early as 2015, Natik al-Bayati
said today at a conference in Istanbul. He estimated Iraq’s gas
reserves at 130 trillion cubic feet, 80 percent of which is
associated gas found together with deposits of crude oil.  Iraq had the fifth-biggest gas reserves in the  Middle East 
in 2010, according to data from BP Plc. While the government
relies mostly on sales of crude for revenue, it wants to produce
gas as fuel for power stations, which are unable to meet
domestic demand, and eventually as an export product.  Al-Bayati said the country expects to add about 30 trillion
cubic feet in proved reserves over the next 10 years. Iraq may
have additional, unproved reserves of 100 trillion to 300
trillion cubic feet, of which 80 percent is probably non-
associated gas, he said.  Iraq has signed 15 gas and oil licenses since the U.S.-led
invasion overthrew former President  Saddam Hussein  in 2003. The
government plans a new, fourth round of oil and gas exploration
rights for March.  To contact the reporter on this story:
