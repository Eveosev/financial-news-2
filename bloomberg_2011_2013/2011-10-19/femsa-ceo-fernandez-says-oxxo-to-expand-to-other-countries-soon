Jose Antonio Fernandez, chief
executive officer of Fomento Economico Mexicano SAB, said his
company plans to make “imminent” acquisitions as cash on hand
outstrips debt.  “When? I can’t say,” Fernandez said at an event in
Monterrey yesterday. “But in the next months or year are we
going to buy companies? Definitely, yes. In this sense it’s
imminent.”  The company’s Coke bottling unit Coca-Cola Femsa SAB,  Latin
America ’s largest, made two all-share acquisitions earlier this
year, which will increase the company’s cash position.  Femsa had $2.7 billion of cash on hand at the end of the
second quarter and $1.9 billion of long-term debt, the company
 reported  July 22. Coca-Cola Femsa bought the bottling operations
of Grupo Cimsa in a transaction valued at 11 billion pesos ($823
million) on Sept. 19. It acquired the bottling operations of
Grupo Tampico SA for 6.55 billion pesos in Coca-Cola Femsa stock
on June 28.  The company plans to increase its dividends at a “solid,
firm pace,” Fernandez said.  Femsa plans to expand Oxxo, its convenience store chain,
beyond Mexico and  Colombia , he said, with  Brazil  being a
possible target.  “The trick is to understand the needs of the local market
and adapt to those,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
