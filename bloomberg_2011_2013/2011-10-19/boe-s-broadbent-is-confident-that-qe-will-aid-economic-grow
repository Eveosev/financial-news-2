Bank of England  policy maker Ben
Broadbent said he’s “confident” that the bank’s decision to
expand so-called quantitative easing will support the economic
recovery.  The bank is “confident” that inflation will slow and that
“there will be a resumption of real income growth for
households in 2012,” he said in an interview today with BBC
Radio Lancashire.  “Beyond that we’re hopeful policy makers in  Europe  will
take some of the action to resolve some of the issues” that are
weighing on the U.K. economy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
