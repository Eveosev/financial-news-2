Chinese central bank adviser Xia Bin
said that the nation’s growth is “sound” and he doesn’t
believe that the government needs to implement any “major”
stimulus measures.  He spoke in an interview in Beijing today after the
government announced yesterday that growth slowed to 9.1 percent
in the third quarter, the slowest pace in two years. The central
bank should stick to its “prudent” monetary policy, he said.  UBS AG said late yesterday that the government may come up
with a “small stimulus” of about 2 percent of gross domestic
product at the start of next year by easing fiscal and credit
policies. Based on the size of the economy last year, the amount
would be about 800 billion yuan ($125 billion).  “I don’t believe  China  will launch another round of major
economic stimulus,” said Xia, an academic member of the central
bank’s monetary policy committee. He said that growth “remains
sound.”  Foreign direct investment into China grew at a slower pace
in September, climbing 7.9 percent from a year earlier, the
smallest gain in three months, the commerce ministry said today.
The amount was $9 billion.  China’s economy  has cooled after increases in banks’
reserve requirements and  interest rates  and as  Europe ’s
sovereign-debt crisis and elevated unemployment in developed
economies caps export demand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
