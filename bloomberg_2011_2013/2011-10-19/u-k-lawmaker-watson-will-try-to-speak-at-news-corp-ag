Tom Watson , the U.K. lawmaker who
has led attacks against  News Corp. (NWSA) ’s British newspapers over
phone hacking, will travel to Los Angeles to try to speak at the
company’s annual general meeting on Oct. 21.  Watson caused laughter at the start of a hearing of
Parliament’s Culture Committee in London today when he announced
he had bought shares in News Corp. that would allow him to
address the AGM. The panel was taking testimony from lawyers
involved in hacking cases.  “I want to make sure the shareholders are fully informed
about the things their company is doing in the U.K.,” Watson, a
member of the opposition Labour Party, said in an interview
after the hearing. “For an organization that believes in
freedom of speech, it would be pretty extraordinary if they
tried to stop me being heard.”  Since the revelation in July that the company’s News of the
World tabloid had hacked the phone of a murdered schoolgirl,
 Milly Dowler , the newspaper has been closed, executives have
resigned and a series of investigations have been launched. News
Corp. Chief Executive Officer Rupert Murdoch called it “the
most humble day of my life” when he appeared before the Culture
Committee in July to apologize for the affair.  Watson has used his seat on the Culture Committee to pursue
News Corp. over hacking since 2009. In July, it was he who told
Parliament about the hacking of Dowler’s phone. He has been
rewarded for his campaigning with promotion by Labour leader  Ed Miliband , who has put him in charge of election strategy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
