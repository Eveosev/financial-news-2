The  U.S. economy  is
“extraordinarily” weak and President Barack Obama’s $47
billion proposal to create jobs has a high probability of ending
in deadlock, said Nicolas Eyzaguirre, director of the
International Monetary Fund’s Western Hemisphere department.  A weaker global outlook may push up risk aversion and lead
to more moderate, although still high, commodity prices,
although that would depend on how Asian demand stands up, he
told a conference in Santiago today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
