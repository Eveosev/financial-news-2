The following is a roundup of
stories from the 2011 Rugby World Cup in  New Zealand .  All Blacks Payout  Irish bookmaker  Paddy Power Plc (PWL)  will pay out bets on New
Zealand winning rugby’s World Cup, four days before the host
nation faces France in the final.  New Zealand is 1-9 to win in Auckland with Paddy Power,
meaning a successful $9 bet would bring in $1 plus the original
wager. The bookmaker said it will face a 650,000-euro ($900,000)
payout.  The All Blacks, aiming to win the World Cup for a first
time since 1987, have won all their matches at this year’s
tournament and are on a 26-match winning run at Eden Park, the
venue for the final.  “It’s inevitable us bookies will be taking a hammering
from them on Sunday too so punters may as well collect now,”
Paddy Power said in an e-mailed statement yesterday.  Top-ranked New Zealand won by 20 points when the teams met
Sept. 24 in a Pool A match, one of two losses for  France  in the
group stage. The All Blacks beat France 29-9 at Eden Park 24
years ago to win rugby’s first World Cup.  Player of the Year  Four players who’ll be involved in the final were today
named on the International Rugby Board’s 2011  Player of the Year
shortlist .  New Zealand’s Piri Weepu,  Jerome Kaino  and Ma’a Nonu, and
France’s Thierry Dusautoir are on the six-man shortlist along
with Australia’s David Pocock and Will Genia.  The award “is the ultimate accolade for a player to
receive in his career,” IRB Chairman Bernard Lapasset said in a
statement.  The winner will be announced on Oct. 24.  To contact the reporter on this story:
