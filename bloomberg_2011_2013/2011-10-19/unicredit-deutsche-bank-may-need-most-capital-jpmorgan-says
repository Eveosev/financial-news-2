UniCredit SpA (UCG)  and  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) 
may have the biggest shortfall in capital among European banks
should stricter regulations be passed and they incur sovereign
debt losses, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.  Milan-based UniCredit would need to raise 13.5 billion
euros ($18.7 billion) assuming a “stress” scenario and
Germany’s Deutsche Bank would need 11.7 billion euros, JPMorgan
analysts led by Kian Abouhossein wrote in a note to clients
today.  European banks may need a total of 230 billion euros to
recapitalize in 2012, they said. Using the European Banking
Authority’s calculation method, the amount of capital required
would be 243 billion euros, according to JPMorgan.  “The more we look at the details, we question EBA input
assumptions and hence we remain cautious,” the analysts said.
“Overall we believe the JPMorgan methodology is more
realistic.”  The analysts said they used calculations based on the so-
called Basel III reforms for capital ratios and assumed banks
with a capital deficit will cease paying dividends, among other
changes.  Using the EBA’s assumptions,  Royal Bank of Scotland Group
Plc (RBS)  has the largest shortfall at 19 billion euros, followed by
UniCredit with 17 billion euros needed, JPMorgan said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
