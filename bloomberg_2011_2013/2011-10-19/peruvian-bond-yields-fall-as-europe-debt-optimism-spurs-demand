Peruvian bonds rose, pushing down
yields for the first time this week, as optimism the European
Union will expand a bailout fund and stem the region’s debt
turmoil spurred demand for higher yielding, emerging-market
assets.  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-
denominated bond due August 2020 fell three basis points, or
0.03 percentage point, to 5.73 percent, according to prices
compiled by Bloomberg.  European stocks gained after the  Guardian newspaper 
reported yesterday that German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  and
French President Nicolas Sarkozy agreed to boost the European
Financial Stability Facility to 2 trillion euros ($2.75
trillion) from 440 billion euros.  “Risk sentiment has been the main driver for bond prices
as of late,” said Daniel Chodos, an emerging markets strategist
at Credit Suisse Securities in  New York .  The sol was little changed at 2.7235 per  U.S. dollar , from
2.7225 yesterday.  The extra yield investors demand to own the Andean
country’s bonds instead of U.S. Treasuries declined three basis
points to 216 at 4:36 p.m. in New York, according to JPMorgan
Chase & Co.  To contact the reporter on this story:
