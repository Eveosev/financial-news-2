The cost of protecting Asia-Pacific
corporate and sovereign bonds from default dropped, according to
traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index decreased 5 basis points
to 186 basis points as of 11:21 a.m. in Sydney, according to
Westpac Banking Corp. The gauge is on course for its lowest
close since Sept. 19, according to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  fell 6 basis points to 201 basis points
as of 8:42 a.m. in  Hong Kong , Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc
prices show. That would be the lowest closing level since Sept.
20, according to CMA, which is owned by CME Group Inc. and
compiles prices quoted by dealers in the privately negotiated
market.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index dropped 4 basis points to 190
as of 9:36 a.m. in  Tokyo , Deutsche Bank AG prices show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
credit quality. A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
