James Bullard , president of the
Federal Reserve bank of  St. Louis , said it’s important for
central bankers to explain monetary policy to the public.  “These are complicated policies even for insiders like
me,” he said in a radio interview today on “Bloomberg

we get out as much as we can and talk about Fed policy.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
