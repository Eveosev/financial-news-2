China  said bonds sold by its
Ministry of Railways have “government support” as it tries to
build investor confidence in the world’s largest high-speed
train network following a fatal crash earlier this year.  The ministry can make clear to investors that its
securities have state backing, the National Development and
Reform Commission said in a statement posted on the website of
China’s bond clearing house. It didn’t detail what the support
entails.  The rail operator, which employs 2.1 million people and has
debt totaling 2.1 trillion yuan ($329 billion), is attempting to
restore confidence after two trains collided in the eastern city
of Wenzhou on July 23 because of a signal failure, killing 40
people. Yields on 10-year railway bonds fell 14 basis points
this month to 6.16 percent as regulators cut in half the tax
collected on interest income on the ministry’s notes sold
between now and 2013.  The Rail Ministry said it slashed spending on construction
by 59 percent last month after Chinese Premier  Wen Jiabao 
pledged to improve safety and accountability.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
