Philippine inflation “is no longer
a threat,” the peso is stable and the central bank has
“weapons to stabilize the exchange rate,” Monetary Board

in implementation tend to reduce the impact the projects may
have on economic growth, said Medalla. The monetary board member
said his comments reflect a personal view.  To contact the reporter on this story:
