EFG Eurobank Ergasias SA (EUROB)  plans to
inject about 20 million euros ($28 million) of capital into its
Romanian unit Bancpost SA by the end of this year, the unit’s
chairman Mihai Bogza said.  The shareholders of Bancpost are scheduled to vote on the
increase on Nov. 7 to raise the bank’s solvency ratio from the
current levels of 13.6 percent, under Romanian accounting
standards, Bogza said in an interview in Bucharest today.  “ Romania ’s economy is still in a very difficult period and
we want to be prepared to face this, we want to be well
capitalized,” Bogza said. “We are a self-sustained bank and we
have a very good coverage of loans with deposits, so we don’t
depend too much on the financing from our Greek parent.”  International banks operating in Romania have brought 850
million lei ($272 million) into Romania this year as they
grapple with rising bad loans, low demand for new credits and
high market volatility.  Erste Group Bank AG (EBS)  plans to boost capital at its Banca
Comerciala Romana SA by as much as 618 million lei, pending
shareholders’ approval on Nov. 14, while  Oesterreichische
Volksbanken AG (VBPS)  will inject as much as 200 million euros in the
Romanian unit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
