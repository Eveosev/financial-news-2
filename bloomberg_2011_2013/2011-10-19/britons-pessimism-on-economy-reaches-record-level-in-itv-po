A poll conducted for ITV News found
that 67 percent of British people are pessimistic about the
future state of the U.K. economy, the highest percentage since
the ITV Index began a year ago, the network said in an e-mailed
statement.  The level of pessimism at this time last year in the poll,
which is conducted by Comres, was 49 percent, ITV News said.  U.K. Business Secretary Vince Cable said in response to the
poll results that while people must confront the “brutal
reality” of the government’s spending cuts and the rising cost
of living, there is a “route out of the crisis,” ITV News
reported, citing an interview.  The poll, taken a year after the government introduced its
spending cuts program, shows that one in five, or 22 percent,
are optimistic about the future state of the U.K. economy,
compared with 37 percent in October last year, ITV said, citing
the poll.  Comres interviewed 2,024 British adults Oct. 14 to 16, the
statement said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
