Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) , the
nation’s biggest lender, is arranging meetings with investors as
it plans its first sale of covered bonds, according to a person
familiar with the matter.  BNP Paribas, Morgan Stanley and Commonwealth Bank will
organize the talks in Europe and the U.S., which are expected to
begin on Nov. 7, the person said, asking not to be named as the
details are private. The Sydney-based lender may market a sale
of covered bonds after the meetings, the person said.  Australia’s upper house Senate passed legislation on Oct.
13 that amended the nation’s Banking Act to allow domestic
lenders to sell covered bonds for the first time. The nation’s
banks may pay a yield premium on the securities that’s about a
third less than on senior unsecured notes,  David Goodman ,
Sydney-based Westpac Banking Corp.’s director of asset-backed
securities, said this month.  The securities, which typically have the highest  credit
rating , are backed by assets that stay on the bank’s balance
sheet and can be sold in a default.  Commonwealth Bank’s inaugural covered debt will be backed
by prime Australian residential mortgages, the person said. The
sale is subject to market conditions.  National Australia Bank Ltd. (NAB)  is also weighing a covered
bond sale, a separate person familiar with the matter said
yesterday. It plans to meet with investors in the U.S. and
Europe from Oct. 31, the person said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
