Bank of Montreal (BMO)  said it hired Mark
White, assistant superintendent of  Canada ’s main banking
regulator, to help oversee the bank’s capital management
efforts.  White starts Nov. 1 as senior vice president of capital
management and optimization. He’ll be in charge of the strategic
management of enterprise capital for Canada’s fourth-biggest
bank, the Toronto-based lender said today in an internal memo
confirmed by Paul Deegan, a company spokesman.  “Mark White brings deep bank capital-management expertise
to the role and has a broad perspective on the emerging global
regulatory framework,” Deegan said.  The Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions
said June 14 that White will leave Oct. 31 and begin work at a
“federally regulated financial institution” the next day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
