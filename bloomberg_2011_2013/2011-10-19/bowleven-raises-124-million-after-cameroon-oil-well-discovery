BowLeven Plc (BLVN) , a U.K.-listed oil
explorer focused on  Africa , raised $124 million in a share
placing today after a discovering oil at a well in Cameroon.  The shares sold at 103 pence each, a 37 percent premium to
the level the stock was trading at last week before the
discovery in the Etinde permit was announced on Oct. 14. The
Edinburgh-based company sold 77.5 million shares, representing a
36 percent increase in ordinary share capital.  The funds will be used for BowLeven’s drilling program next
year. Geneva-based Vitol SA, a parter in Cameroon, said Aug. 1
that it wouldn’t participate in the Sapele-3 well that went on
to encounter a “good quality” reservoir. BowLeven shares
jumped the most in 2 1/2 years on news of the find.  “We had thought there was a strong possibility management
would look to capitalize on last week’s share price strength,”
Royal Bank of Scotland Plc analyst Phil Corbett wrote in an e-
mailed note. “The pressure is now on to deliver significant
value for shareholders in 2012.”  BowLeven fell 4.8 percent to 109.5 pence as of the 4:30
p.m. London close.  To contact the reporter on this story:
