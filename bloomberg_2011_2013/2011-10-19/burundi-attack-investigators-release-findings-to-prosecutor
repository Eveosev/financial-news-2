A Burundian commission that was set
up to investigate an attack on a bar last month that killed at
least 39 people has submitted its findings, said Attorney
General Valentin Bagorikunda.  Officials are continuing to search for the offenders, he
said in a statement today in Bujumbura, the East African
nation’s capital. No details on the findings of the report
were given.  Unidentified gunmen opened fire on patrons of the bar in
Gaumba, 13 kilometers (8 miles) northwest of Bujumbura. Four
days after the Sept. 18 attack, a statement from the
presidency said at least “a dozen” alleged perpetrators had
been arrested.  To contact the reporter on this story:
