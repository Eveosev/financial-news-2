ENL Ltd. (ENL) , a Mauritian company with
interests in agriculture and property, plans to develop a town
in the island’s center, Chief Executive Officer Hector Espitalier-Noel said after opening the country’s largest
shopping mall.  “In the coming years, a business hotel, residences, an
office park, warehousing facilities as well as a micro-brewery
and a motor city will confer to Bagatelle the status of a small
town,” Espitalier-Noel said today. Bagatelle is located south
of the capital, Port Louis.  The first phase of the town project, which was opened
today, is a 42,000 square-meter (452,000 square-foot), 3.5
billion-rupee ($120.7 million) shopping mall developed by ENL
Property Ltd., a unit of  ENL Land Ltd. (SAVA)  in partnership with  South
Africa ’s Atterbury Investment Holdings.  Real estate and construction accounted for more than 38
percent of foreign direct investment in Mauritius over the past
five years, Prime Minister Navinchandra Ramgoolam said at the
opening. Investment in the industry is expected to grow by more
than 8 percent in 2011, he said. In 2010, the industry invested
22.4 billion rupees.  “Permits have been secured,” Gilbert Espitalier-Noel, CEO
of ENL Property Ltd., said in an interview in Bagatelle. “Works
would be completed by end of 2012” and the project will span
more than 225 acres (91 hectares) of land in Bagatelle, he said.
Investments will amount to about 1.5 billion rupees for
residential units, office spaces and a motor city, he added.  ENL Property manages about 20 billion rupees of projects
including high-end villas and residential developments. ENL
plans to develop a 25,000 square-meter project in Lusaka,
Zambia’s capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
