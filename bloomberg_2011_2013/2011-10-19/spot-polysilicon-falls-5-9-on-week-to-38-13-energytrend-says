The  spot price  of polysilicon, the
raw material for most solar panels, fell 5.9 percent on an
oversupply of the modules, according to data from EnergyTrend.  Average prices were $38.13 a kilogram in the week to today,
compared with $40.51 a week ago, the Taipei-based researcher
said on its website. The average selling price of multi-
crystalline silicon wafers, produced from raw silicon, dropped
10 percent to $1.53 each, while solar cells, made from wafers,
fell 6.7 percent to 62 cents a watt, EnergyTrend said.  Polysilicon makers have seen spot prices slide 48 percent
since March as demand for solar panels falls amid subsidy cuts
in Germany and  Italy . Companies that fashion polysilicon into
wafers and then cells for panels are pushing down the cost of
the material as they seek to claw back profit from polysilicon
makers after a supply surplus weighed on prices for their goods.  “Polysilicon prices keep sliding, and as there’s no sign
of a slowdown or even an end, each further drop is a concern to
investors,” Haakon Levy, an Oslo-based analyst at  DnB NOR ASA (DNBNOR) ,
said in a telephone interview.  Polysilicon producer  Wacker Chemie AG (WCH)  pared gains in
 Frankfurt , trading up 0.4 percent at 78.95 euros as of 12:50
p.m. local time, after earlier advancing 3.6 percent.  The decline in polysilicon prices may force the biggest
producers to cut charges for clients tied into long-term
contracts as oversupply ravages the industry, said Sean McLoughlin, an analyst at HSBC Holdings Plc in  London .  Last week, prices for the material tumbled the most since
June, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance data. Average
prices fell 6.1 percent to $41.13 a kilogram, according to the
London-based researcher’s survey of contracts conducted Oct. 11
to Oct. 17. That compares with a 5.8 percent drop in the BNEF
polysilicon price index a week earlier.  To contact the reporters on this story:
