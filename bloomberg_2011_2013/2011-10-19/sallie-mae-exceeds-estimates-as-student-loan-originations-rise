SLM Corp. (SLM)  reported results that
exceeded analyst estimates after the student lender known as
 Sallie Mae  increased loan originations and delinquency rates
fell.  A net loss of $47 million, or 10 cents per share, compares
with a net loss of $495 million, or $1.06, in the year-earlier
period, the Newark, Delaware-based company said today in a
statement distributed by  Business Wire . SLMâ€™s core earnings were
$188 million, or 36 cents per share, from $202 million, or 37
cents per share in the year-ago period. Seven analysts surveyed
by Bloomberg estimated an average of 35 cents.  Sallie Mae is overhauling its business after Congress
passed legislation last year prohibiting private companies from
originating government-backed loans, which had been 80 percent
of its business. The lender originated $1.1 billion in student
debt in the third quarter from $835 million in the same period
of 2010, the company said. Late payments of 90 days or more fell
to 5 percent from 5.7 percent.  The company has gained 5.9 percent this year. It fell 2.5
percent to $13.33 today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
