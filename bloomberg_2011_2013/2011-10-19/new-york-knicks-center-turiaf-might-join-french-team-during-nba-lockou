New York Knicks center Ronny Turiaf
may play for French team Asvel during the National Basketball
Association lockout, joining fellow Frenchman  Tony Parker  of the
 San Antonio Spurs , who’s a part owner of the club.  Turiaf, who was born in Martinique and played basketball as
a youth in Paris, told Asvel’s website that he’ll arrive in
 France  tomorrow and participate in his first workouts this
weekend. Turiaf’s agent, Mark Bartelstein, told the  New York
Post  that the deal is contingent on insurance issues.  The 6-foot-10 Turiaf played in 64 games for the Knicks last
season, averaging 4.2 points and 3.2 rebounds while making 21
starts. Turiaf was bothered by chronic knee pain throughout the
season and wasn’t able to play for France in the  European
basketball championship  last month due to a left hand injury.  To contact the reporter on this story:
