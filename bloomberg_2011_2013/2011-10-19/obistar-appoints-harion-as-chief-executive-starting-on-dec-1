Mobistar SA (MOBB) ,  Belgium â€™s second-
biggest mobile-phone company, appointed Jean Marc Harion as
chief executive officer, replacing Benoit Scheen who left to
join  France Telecom SA (FTE)  last month.  Harion, 49, will take over as CEO on Dec. 1, Mobistar said
in an e-mailed statement. He joined  France Telecom  in 1999, when
the French phone operator acquired Computer Channel, the company
specialized in online training for businesses in the fields of
Internet and television that Harion founded in the 1990s.  Harion was named vice-president for business development
for France Telecom in North and South America in 2007. Since
2009 he has been chief executive of Orange Dominicana, the
second-largest mobile operator in the  Dominican Republic  with 3
million customers and 1,200 employees, Mobistar said in the
statement.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
