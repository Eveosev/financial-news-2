Canadian Finance Minister  Jim
Flaherty  said he’s hopeful he can come to an agreement with the
U.S. that will resolve a dispute over IRS disclosure rules that
threaten to be costly to  Canada ’s banks.  Flaherty made the comments to lawmakers today in Ottawa.  The Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act, known as FATCA,
requires overseas financial companies for the first time to
identify their American customers to the IRS and withhold 30
percent of U.S. interest and dividend payments from account
holders who provide inadequate information.  To contact the reporter on this story:
