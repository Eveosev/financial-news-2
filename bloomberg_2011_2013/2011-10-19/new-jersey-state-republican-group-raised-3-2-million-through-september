New Jersey  state Republicans raised
$1.48 million from July 1 to Sept. 30, three times as much as
Democrats, as Governor  Chris Christie  weighed a presidential bid
and brought in money nationwide for his political party.  The New Jersey Republican State Committee this year
collected $3.2 million through Sept. 30, while the Democratic
State Committee raised $889,450, according to a  summary  of
campaign-finance reports from the state Election Law Enforcement
Commission. The Democratic committee brought in $512,196 in the
period from July 1 to Sept. 30.  Christie, a first-term Republican, traveled to Missouri,
California and  Louisiana  during the last week of September to
raise money for state parties, including New Jersey’s. His trip,
which also included a speech at the Ronald Reagan Presidential
Library, led party fundraisers to urge him to get into the
presidential race. Christie said Oct. 4 that he wouldn’t run.  Democrats control both houses of New Jersey’s Legislature,
and all 120 seats are up for election in November.  The Republican State Committee spent $2.2 million this year
through Sept. 30 while the Democratic State Committee spent
$688,886, the election commission said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
