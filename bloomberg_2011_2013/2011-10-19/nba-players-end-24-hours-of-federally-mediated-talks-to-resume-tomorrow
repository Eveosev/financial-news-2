The  National Basketball Association 
and its players union ended two days of federally mediated talks
today, and plan to resume negotiations tomorrow.  Representatives of the two sides met for more than 24 hours
over the past two days under the direction of George Cohen, head
of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service.  “Everyone is extremely focused on the core issues, the
difficult issues that confront them,” Cohen said today at a
news conference at a New York hotel. The two sides have agreed
to a gag order imposed by Cohen.  The NBA’s lockout of players is in its 111th day. It has
been nine days since NBA Commissioner  David Stern  canceled the
first two weeks of the season, which was scheduled to begin Nov.
