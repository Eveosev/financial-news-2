A wider use of emerging markets’
currencies including  China ’s yuan could benefit the global
monetary system, International Monetary Fund economists said.  The key emerging markets’ currencies that have potential
for internationalization besides the yuan are the Brazilian
real, the  Indian rupee , the Russian ruble and the South African
rand, IMF staff wrote. A multipolar system may help diversify
risks, according to the report.  “This process, however, will require deeper financial
markets and further progress to reform and liberalize the
capital account, along with other macroeconomic and structural
policies,” according to the report.  French President  Nicolas Sarkozy  has been trying to coax
China into accepting a greater role for its currency during
France’s chairmanship of the Group of 20 nations that will
culminate in a summit in Cannes in November. The discussions are
part of efforts to limit global economic imbalances and avoid
another financial crisis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
