Groupon Inc. is in talks to sell
shares in an initial public offering that would value the
company at about $12 billion, according to two people with
direct knowledge of the matter.  The world’s largest daily-coupon site is considering an
offering of less than 10 percent of the valuation, said one of
the people, who asked not to be identified because the plans
haven’t been made public. The Chicago-based company plans to
start marketing its IPO to investors as early as next week,
people with knowledge of the matter said yesterday.  Groupon delayed earlier plans to pitch the offering to
investors in September amid stock-market swings, people familiar
with the matter said at the time. The company also needed extra
time to address regulators’ questions, including possible
revisions to a controversial accounting method used in its
filing, the people said.  Groupon said in a June filing with the Securities and
Exchange Commission that it is seeking as much as $750 million
in its IPO. When the company met with underwriters earlier this
year, it discussed a valuation of as high as $25 billion, people
with knowledge of the matter said at the time.  Morgan Stanley (MS) ,  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  and  Credit Suisse
Group AG (CSGN)  are leading Groupon’s offering.  The New York Times reported earlier that Groupon was
weighing a valuation of about $12 billion.  To contact the reporters on this story:
