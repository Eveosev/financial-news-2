Pakistan Oilfields Ltd. (POL) , the
nation’s third-biggest energy explorer, posted a 55 percent
increase in first-quarter profit after crude prices rose.  Net income in the three months ended Sept. 30 climbed to
3.5 billion rupees ($40 million), or 14.61 rupees a share, from
2.2 billion rupees, or 9.44 rupees, a year earlier, the
Rawalpindi-based company said in a filing to the  Karachi Stock
Exchange  today. Sales rose to 7.9 billion rupees from 5.9
billion a year earlier.  A 7 percent increase in production from fields in the Tal
and Ikhlas blocks and higher  oil prices  would have helped the
company boost revenue in the quarter, Sana Abdullah, a research
analyst at IGI Finex Securities Ltd. in Karachi who has a
“buy” recommendation on the stock, wrote in a note to clients
on Oct. 17.  The price of Arab Light Crude rose 46 percent during the
first quarter to $108.30 a barrel, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Pakistan Oilfields, which has gained 24 percent this year,
rose 1.4 percent to 368 rupees as of 9:47 a.m. local time, on
course for its highest level in nine days, on the Karachi Stock
Exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
