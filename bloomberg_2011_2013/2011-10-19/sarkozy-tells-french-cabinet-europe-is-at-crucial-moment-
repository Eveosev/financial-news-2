told his Cabinet that  Europe  is at a “crucial moment” as
leaders prepare for an Oct. 23 summit to tackle the debt crisis.
The summit will deliver a plan to recapitalize banks, boost the
rescue fund, clarify the strategy toward Greece and reinforce
euro-area governance, government spokeswoman Valerie Pecresse
told reporters today in Paris after the weekly Cabinet meeting.
