California  Treasurer Bill Lockyer
defended a program that awarded $25.1 million in tax breaks to
now-bankrupt Solyndra LLC before a state senate joint committee
looking into the program.  Lockyer said he opposed a “financial viability” test for
businesses seeking exemptions under the state program.  He said he would support so-called clawback provisions to
recoup breaks for companies that move equipment out of
California. He said he would also endorse requiring companies to
report more details of changes in their business plans
between when they apply for a  tax exemption  and when they claim
it.  To contact the reporter on this story:
