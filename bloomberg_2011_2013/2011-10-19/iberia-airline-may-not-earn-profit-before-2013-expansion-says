International Consolidated Airlines
Group SA’s Spanish unit might not earn a profit before 2013
because of weak domestic demand and higher fuel costs, Expansion
reported, citing comments by Iberia Chief Executive Officer
Rafael Sanchez-Lozano.  “If there´s no significant change in the current situation
within 12 months, it will be tough to make money,” Sanchez-
Lozano said at a briefing yesterday, according to the report.  The Iberia division of the merged British Airways-Iberia
airline has seen jet fuel prices rise 10 percent this year and
expects a 25 percent increase in 2012, the newspaper reported,
citing the company.  Sanchez-Lozano said Iberia, which had a first-half
operating loss of 78 million euros ($108 million) compared with
210 million euros of earnings logged at British Airways, may not
give all its short- and medium-haul routes to its new low-cost
airline, Iberia Express, as some of them are profitable,
according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
