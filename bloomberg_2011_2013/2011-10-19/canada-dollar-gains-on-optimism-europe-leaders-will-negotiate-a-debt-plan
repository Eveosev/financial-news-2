Canada ’s dollar fell as concern
European leaders are divided on proposals to increase a bailout
fund to solve the region’s sovereign debt crisis drove investors
from higher-yielding assets and currencies.  The Canadian currency had fluctuated as crude  oil prices 
swung between gains and losses. Euro-area officials including
French President  Nicolas Sarkozy  were assembling in  Frankfurt  to
narrow divisions four days before a summit of leaders.  “The headlines that Sarkozy saying talks are ‘stuck’ takes
the shine off the recent optimism,” said Firas Askari, head of
 currency trading  in Toronto at Bank of Montreal’s BMO Capital
Markets unit, by e-mail today. “That means quick risk-off from
risk-on and the Canadian dollar takes it on the chin. The market
is jittery, and liquidity is very poor.”  Canada’s currency fell 0.6 percent to C$1.0205 per U.S.
dollar by 5 p.m. in Toronto. It touched C$1.0085, almost the
strongest since Sept. 21. One Canadian dollar buys 97.99 U.S.
cents.  Futures on crude oil dropped 2.6 percent to $86.05 a barrel
in  New York  after gaining as much as 1.3 percent. The
correlation coefficient between oil and the Canadian dollar was
0.77 today. The coefficient was as high as 0.86 on Aug. 8 and as
low as 11 on Sept. 5. A reading of 1 indicates the measures move
in lockstep.  The MSCI World Index dropped 0.2 percent after advancing
yesterday. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index declined 1.3 percent.
The one-month correlation coefficient of the loonie, as the
Canadian currency is often known, with the two benchmarks is
0.87 and 0.89, respectively.  Currency Volatility  Options trading showed bearishness on the Canadian currency
has advanced this week. The premium charged for the right to buy
the  U.S. dollar  versus the Canadian dollar in three months over
contracts to sell was 3.2 percentage points today after ending
last week at 3. So called risk-reversal rates reached a record
4.43 percentage points on Oct. 4.  Volatility in the greenback versus the Canadian dollar fell
after rising for two days. One-month implied volatility on the
 currency pair  was 12.93 percent today, from 12.97 yesterday. It
climbed as high as 16 percent on Oct. 4. The average during the
past five years is 11.6 percent.  Implied volatility, which traders quote and use to set
option prices, signals the expected pace of swings in the
underlying currency.  Two-Year Auction  Canada sold C$3.5 billion ($3.5 billion) of two-year bonds
today, drawing an average yield of 1.097 percent for the 1
percent securities and a bid to cover ratio of 2.38 times,
according to the central bank’s  website . The previous auction of
two-year bonds, on Sept. 14, fetched an average yield of 1.03
percent and a bid-to-coverage ratio of 2.53 times,  Bank of
Canada  data show.  Government bonds  fell for a second day, pushing the yield
on benchmark 10-year debt two basis points higher to 2.33
percent. The price of the 3.25 percent security maturing in June
2021 fell 21 cents to C$107.86.  Canadian government bonds are down 0.9 percent this month,
compared with losses of 0.8 percent for U.S. government bonds,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch data.  Statistics Canada  said earlier that the nation’s index of
leading indicators dropped 0.1 percent in September, the first
decline in a year, led by declines in manufacturing. Economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News predicted the index would rise 0.1
percent, according to the median of eight estimates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
