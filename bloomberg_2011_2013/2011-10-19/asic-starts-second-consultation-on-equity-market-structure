The Australian Securities and
Investments Commission said it started a second consultation on
equity market structure ahead of the launch of a rival exchange
operator to  ASX Ltd. (ASX)   The paper considers the impact of high-frequency trading
and extreme price movements, as well as making proposals on pre-
trade transparency, ASIC said today in a statement on its
 website . Industry submissions to the consultation are open until
Jan. 20.  “We have an efficient regulatory framework with controls
in place to enable competition,” Belinda Gibson, ASIC’s deputy
chairman, said in the statement. “The next step is to consider
how emerging trading issues will impact our market over the
coming years. It is appropriate to address these issues in a
multi-market environment now competition is imminent.”  Chi-X  Australia  Pty will start competing with the nation’s
main stock exchange operator at the end of the month after the
market regulator said earlier this week that it met license
preconditions.  Traditional bourses are facing rising competition from
alternative systems such as so-called dark pools, off-exchange
platforms that offer investors anonymity and don’t publicly
display prices.  Chi-X will be the first foreign-owned market operator since
Australia’s original stock market opened in the southern city of
 Melbourne  in 1861.  The latest consultation follows one that took place in
March -- before Chi-X’s service was approved by the government -
- that
focused on “market integrity” rules.  To contact the reporter on this story:
