Major swaps dealers say their
profits will be flat or decline in the year after reforms
mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act take effect, according to
research and advisory firm Tabb Group.  In the longer term almost three out of four dealers said
they expect trading volumes to improve as more users enter the
market, Kevin McPartland, a senior analyst at Tabb, wrote in a
study released today. The report was based on interviews with 23
swap dealers, including  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) ,  Citigroup Inc. (C)  and
the eight other largest U.S.-based banks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
