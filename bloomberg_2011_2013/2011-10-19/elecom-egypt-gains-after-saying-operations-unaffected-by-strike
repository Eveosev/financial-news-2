Telecom Egypt (ETEL) , the Arab country’s
monopoly fixed-line telephone company, rose the most in almost a
week after saying its business is unaffected by a strike.  Telecom  Egypt  shares gained 1.2 percent, the biggest
intraday rise since Oct. 13, to 15 Egyptian pounds at 11:17 a.m.
in Cairo. That gave the company a market value of 25.6 billion
pounds ($4.3 billion). The benchmark EGX30 Index rose 0.8
percent.  A strike at a “limited” number of its branches hasn’t
affected operations, the company said in a filing to the
Egyptian bourse today.  The striking employees are demanding the resignation of
Chief Executive Officer Mohammed Abdel Rehim,  Al Mal  reported
yesterday. The workers are also seeking the release of five of
their colleagues who were arrested after locking Abdel Rehim in
his office last week, the Cairo-based newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
