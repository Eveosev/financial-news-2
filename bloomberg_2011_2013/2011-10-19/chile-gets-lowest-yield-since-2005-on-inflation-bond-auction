Chile ’s government paid the lowest
yield on an auction of 10-year inflation bonds since September
2005 as it sold $260 million of fixed-rate and inflation-linked
debt.  The government issued 37.5 billion pesos ($73 million) of
10-year fixed-rate bonds at a yield of 5.1 percent today, the
lowest since March 2007. It also sold $186 million of inflation-
linked bonds, including the 10-year securities at a yield of
2.35 percent, according to data on the central bank’s website.
The bonds tied to consumer prices were denominated in unidades
de fomento, Chile’s inflation-linked accounting unit.  Chilean bond yields have fallen this year as investors led
by pension funds and insurance companies have sought the
relative safety of fixed-income securities. The strength of
demand reflects the country’s macroeconomic credibility, Nicolas
Eyzaguirre, director of the Western Hemisphere department at the
 International Monetary Fund , said today.  Chilean bonds are “solid gold,” Eyzaguirre, a former
Chilean Finance Minister, told a conference in Santiago.  Total demand for the bonds was 203 percent of the amount
offered, less than the 493 percent demand at a central bank
auction of two-year and five-year fixed-rate bonds yesterday.  In the past two days, Chile’s central bank and government
have sold $164 million of fixed-rate bonds and $186 million of
inflation-linked bonds. Demand for the fixed-rate bonds totaled
$594 million, and for the inflation-linked bonds totaled $378
million, according to central bank data.  Investors’ Outlook  The preference for fixed-rate over inflation-linked bonds
suggests that investors expect rates to fall and inflation to
remain controlled, said Felipe Alarcon, an economist at Banco de
Credito e Inversiones who used to manage bond auctions at the
central bank.  “If they’re going so hard into the central bank peso bonds
it’s because they see a high risk of rate cuts and that cuts
will be big,” he said. “They’re also validating lower
inflation. Bid to cover ratios in inflation-linked bonds are in
retreat. The inflation-linked market is overbought and while
yields aren’t at recent lows, they don’t have much space to fall
further.”  The government today sold $61 million each of 20-year and
30-year inflation-linked bonds with yields of 2.8 percent and
2.94 percent, respectively. The yield on the 30-year bonds was
the lowest since at least March 2008, and on the 20-year bonds
it was the lowest since at least October 2003.  Pension Funds  Chile’s pension funds, which had $133 billion under
management as of the end of September, boosted holdings of
central bank and government debt by $11 billion in the first
nine months of the year to $26 billion, or 20 percent of their
total assets, as they reduced foreign equity holdings by $13
billion to $32 billion, or 24 percent of total assets.  The peso weakened for a third day, falling 0.1 percent to
511.51 per  U.S. dollar  from 510.92 yesterday.  Foreign investors in the Chilean peso forwards market cut
their net long position in U.S. dollars to $5.4 billion on Oct.
17 from $5.5 billion on Oct. 14, according to central bank data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
