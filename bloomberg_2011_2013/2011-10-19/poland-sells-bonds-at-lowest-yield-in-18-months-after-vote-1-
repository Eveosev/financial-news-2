Poland sold five-year bonds at the
lowest yield in 18 months today at the first government debt
auction since Prime Minister Donald Tusk’s re-election this
month on pledges to cut the  budget deficit .  The  Finance Ministry  sold a total of 3.64 billion zloty
($1.16 billion) of new five-year bonds at the main and non-
competitive auctions, more than the up to 3 billion zloty
planned, according to e-mailed statements today. The average
yield slid to 5.105 percent from 5.256 percent at the previous
sale of the benchmark five-year debt on Aug. 10. It was the
lowest since the sale of the similar-dated debt was priced to
yield 4.987 percent on April 21, 2010, according to the
ministry’s  website .  Investors bid to buy 9.88 billion zloty of 4.75-percent
notes due in October 2016 at the auction, the biggest demand for
that maturity debt since May 18, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Poland ’s bonds, the world’s third-worst performers last
quarter, are the second-best this month, with 5 percent returns
in dollars spurred by Tusk’s promise to cut the budget gap below
3 percent of gross domestic product next year from a record 7.9
percent in 2010. Polish five-year bond yields fell from the
highest relative to their German equivalents since 2004 last
month to a 373 basis-point spread today. The premium peaked at
443 basis points on Sept. 22, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  ‘Credit Positive’  “The perception of Poland has improved in recent weeks,”
said Miroslaw Budzicki, fixed-income analyst at PKO Bank Polski
SA, Poland’s largest lender. “Demand for bonds is clearly
holding up and the yield was towards the lower end of
expectations.” He predicted the average yield at 5.10 percent
to 5.15 percent.  Tusk, 54, is the first Polish prime minister to win a
second term since communism ended in 1989. His Oct. 9 victory
was “credit positive” and may spur fiscal restraint, Moody’s
Investors Service said in a report yesterday. Poland is likely
to show the most significant improvement in budget finances of
any country in eastern  Europe  or the former  Soviet Union  next
year, according to the International Monetary Fund’s World
Economic Outlook report in September.  The European Union’s largest eastern economy financed 92
percent of this year’s borrowing needs before October, according
to the Finance Ministry. Poland plans to sell as much as 7
billion zloty of bonds between October and December, the lowest
quarterly amount since the fourth quarter of 2000, the
ministry’s data show.  Default Risk Drops  The bonds will be settled on Oct. 25, the same day the
government will pay a total 7.3 billion zloty in interest to
holders of bonds due in October 2013, 2015, 2017, 2019, 2020 and
2021,  Piotr Marczak , head of the ministry’s debt management
department, said in an e-mailed statement on Sept. 30.  The cost to insure Polish debt against non-payment for five
years through credit-default swaps has dropped 67 basis points,
or 0.64 percentage point, this month to 229 basis points as of
2:00 p.m. in Warsaw, according to data provider CMA, which is
owned by CME Group Inc. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in
the privately negotiated market.  The contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for the
underlying securities or the cash equivalent should a government
or company fail to adhere to its debt agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
