Prudential Financial Inc. (PRU) , the
second-largest U.S. life insurer, hired Michael McRoberts as
managing director of its  Fannie Mae  and Freddie Mac commercial-
mortgage business.  McRoberts, who starts Dec. 5, worked at Freddie Mac as
vice president and national head of sales and production,
Newark, New Jersey-based Prudential said today in a statement
issued by Business Wire. The insurer said McRoberts will be
expected to boost lending for multifamily housing, a segment
that includes apartment buildings.  McRoberts will be a “catalyst for continued growth” in
lending, David Durning, senior managing director of Prudential
Mortgage Capital Co., said in the statement. “The last few
years have brought tremendous change for all participants in the
agency lending business.”  Fannie Mae and  Freddie Mac  are government-supported
mortgage-finance companies.  Wall Street  has boosted its output
of commercial-mortgage-backed securities in the wake of the
recession and credit crisis. About $61 billion in U.S. CMBS has
been issued so far this year, compared with $47 billion in all
of 2010, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Prudential declined $1.19, or 2.3 percent, to $50.40 at
2:56 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange trading. It has slipped 14
percent this year, compared with the 19 percent decline of the
24-company KBW Insurance Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
