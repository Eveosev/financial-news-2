Korea  National Oil Corp. sold $1
billion of bonds as the state-run oil developer plans to acquire
overseas assets.  The five-year debt pays 310 basis points more than similar-
maturity U.S. Treasuries, according to a person familiar with
the transaction, who declined to be identified because terms
aren’t set.  The company, known as KNOC, plans to acquire more assets
next year, Kim Seong Hoon, the company’s Anyang-based senior
executive vice president, said in a telephone interview on Oct.
7. KNOC has increased acquisitions of companies to enable Korea
to raise its self-sufficiency for oil and gas, according to a
Moody’s Investors Service report today. The rating firm assigned
the debt an A1 grade.  KNOC has $5.89 billion of debt maturing by the end of 2017,
including $2.35 billion in 2014, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Kevin Han, a spokesperson for the company, declined
to comment when contacted by telephone before the sale was
completed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
