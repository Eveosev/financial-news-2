La Banque Postale, France’s postal
bank, wants an alternative financing structure for the share of
the loans from  Dexia SA (DEXB) ’s French municipal lending unit that it
will assume,  Les Echos  reported, citing unnamed people at the
bank.  Banque Postale is refusing to go above a 5 percent stake
in the unit, Dexia Municipal Agency, until it has studied its
assets in more detail,  Les Echos  reported. The bank wants to set
up a new financing arm which it thinks will be able to raise
money more cheaply, the newspaper added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
