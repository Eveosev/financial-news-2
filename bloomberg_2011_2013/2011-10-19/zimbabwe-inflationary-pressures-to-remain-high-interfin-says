Zimbabwe ’s inflationary pressures in
the fourth quarter will likely remain high because of rate rises
and the ongoing import of most commodities, Interfin Securities
said.  A 31 percent rise in the electricity tariff by power
company Zesa Holdings Pvt Ltd. will add to inflation as
companies try to pass on the higher rate to consumers, Interfin
said in an e-mailed research note.  “We still maintain that the 4.5 percent inflation target
by the Ministry of Finance is likely to be missed,” Interfin
said.  Annual inflation is running at 4.3 percent, up from 3.5
percent in August, according to Interfin. The current account
and budget deficits are likely to rise “until new measures are
put in place to curb rising government expenditure, especially
consumptive expenditure, which has come at the expense of
capital expenditure,” the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
