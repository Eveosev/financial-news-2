Foreign direct investment in  China 
grew in September at the slowest pace in three months, as
companies pared spending amid concerns that the global recovery
is faltering.  Foreign investment gained 7.9 percent to $9 billion, the
Ministry of Commerce said in a statement distributed before a
briefing in Beijing today. That compares with expansion of 11.1
percent in August and 19.8 percent in July. Spending in the
first nine months of the year rose 16.6 percent to $86.7 billion.  The world economy faces “heightened tensions and
significant downside risks,” finance officials from the Group
of 20 nations said in a statement after a weekend meeting in
Paris. U.S. Ambassador to China  Gary Locke  said last month that
the country’s business climate is leading to “growing
frustrations” among foreign businesses. Data yesterday showed
 China’s economy  grew at the slowest pace in two years.  Today’s data may “reflects concerns over China’s slowdown
that we have seen in the preceding few months,” Dariusz Kowalczyk, a Hong Kong-based strategist at Credit Agricole CIB,
said before the announcement. “September was also a month of
high  risk aversion  so investors may have been hesitant to commit
funds.”  Chinese outbound nonfinancial investment gained 12.5
percent during the first nine months of this year to $40.75
billion, according to the commerce ministry.  --Zheng Lifei. Editors: Nerys Avery, Ken McCallum  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
