Seeking the world’s best education,
Guan Wang’s parents in northeast  China  paid an agency there
$4,700 to get her into a premier American boarding school in
2009.  The company steered her to the  Marvelwood School , which
charges Chinese students $52,000 a year. She relied on the
agency’s assurances that the Kent, Connecticut school was
coveted and academically rigorous, with 20 Chinese students
among its 155 boarders, Wang said.  Marvelwood didn’t fulfill those expectations, Wang said.
She had so many Chinese dormmates that she couldn’t practice
English. Some Americans in her world history course would forget
their textbooks and lay their heads on their desks, she said.
The school accepts four of five applicants, its average SAT
score is below the national norm, and since 2005, one graduate
attended an  Ivy League  college. Half its U.S. students have
learning differences, from attention deficit disorder to
Asperger’s Syndrome, headmaster Arthur Goodearl Jr. said. About
40 boarders came from China last year.  “I couldn’t find a real American education at Marvelwood,”
said Wang, 19, who transferred to another Connecticut boarding
school with fewer Chinese and learning-disabled students. “It
made me not really happy.”  Boarding schools with small endowments and less selective
admissions policies are boosting their revenue and enrollment by
recruiting thousands of Chinese students who pay full freight.
As the weak economy has shrunk the pool of well-off U.S.
applicants, many of these schools are using agents with
misleading sales pitches to tap a growing number of wealthy
families in China eager for the prestige of an American degree.  100-Fold Growth  The number of Chinese students at U.S. private high schools
soared more than 100-fold to 6,725 in 2010-11 from 65 in 2005-
06, according to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. China
has displaced  South Korea  as the top source of international
students at boarding schools, with the smallest schools having
the biggest increases in Chinese enrollment, said Peter Upham,
executive director of the  Association of Boarding Schools  in
Asheville,  North Carolina .  Promised an elite college-prep experience by agents in
China, these students often find that one-third or more of their
dormmates are also Chinese, and many of the U.S. students
require extra time and support. The schools end up segregated
academically and socially into full-paying Chinese students,
many of whom rise to the top of their classes, and American
teenagers who fell behind in public schools.  ‘Continuing Exploitation’  “This is a classic case of the continuing exploitation of
Chinese students and parents, not only by agents in China but
also by the independent schools that pay and enable them,” said
 Richard Hesel , principal of Art & Science Group, a Baltimore-
based firm that advises colleges and private high schools on
enrollment, including recruiting in China without using agents.  Half a dozen Chinese students applied this year to transfer
to  St. Andrew’s School  in  Boca Raton ,  Florida , because they were
frustrated attending other U.S. schools with higher Chinese
enrollment, according to Kilian Forgus, the associate head for
enrollment and planning at St. Andrew’s.  “It’s unethical to have too many students from one language
group,” Forgus said. His school caps the number of Chinese
boarders at 15 out of 102. “The ability to integrate into an
American education system is compromised.”  Remedial Instruction  As awareness of different learning styles has evolved,
schools such as Marvelwood fill a vital niche for college-bound
teenagers who need help with organization, time management and
study skills, current and former boarding school administrators
said. About 40 percent of Marvelwood students are enrolled in
math tutorials or a “Strategies” program, which has 18 teachers
providing one-on-one “academic support and remedial
instruction,” according to the school’s website.  Chinese students as well as Americans benefit from
Marvelwood’s small classes, said Goodearl, who came as
headmaster this year. They  improve their English , experience
American culture, and get into U.S. colleges. Students from
different backgrounds room together so that no dormitory has an
all-Chinese floor, he said. More than 90 percent of
underclassmen return to the school each year, a retention rate
that reflects student satisfaction, said Marvelwood Chairman
 James Samartini .  Agent Spin  Marvelwood prefers to recruit through consultants or alumni
rather than agents, Goodearl said in an interview in his office,
with his diplomas from Harvard College and Wesleyan University
on the wall behind him. Chinese applicants don’t need to know
that the school specializes in helping students with learning
differences, he said.  “Going to school with  ADHD  students is quite good,” he
said. “We’re proud of all our students.”  Wisdom Services in Dalian, China, which Wang said referred
her to Marvelwood, didn’t respond to e-mailed questions about
her recruitment. One of China’s 402 registered agents, Wisdom
places Chinese students in 26 countries and “has successfully
made the dreams of studying and living abroad come true for tens
of thousands of clients,” according to its website.  Unlike sought-after boarding schools with hefty endowments,
which only admit a handful of Chinese students who speak fluent
English, lesser-known schools recruit the Chinese by offering
English-language instruction -- and by using agents who put a
flattering spin on their reputations, according to Chinese
students and graduates.  Bucolic Locations  Paid by the U.S. boarding schools, Chinese families, or
both for each student enrolled, the agents promote schools’
Advanced Placement courses, bucolic campuses and proximity to
major cities, said Mark Sklarow, executive director of the
Independent Educational Consultants Association in Fairfax,
Virginia.  IECA  members don’t accept compensation from schools
for placing a child. Once students are enrolled, some agents
continue to collect fees from schools to pass along progress
reports to parents.  Agents avoid the topic of learning differences, which China
lags behind the U.S. in diagnosing and treating. “Chinese
parents don’t want their children in schools for students with
learning issues,” said Lee Reagan, North America manager for A&A
International Education & Multi-Culture Centre, a Shanghai-based
agency that represents 28 U.S. boarding schools.  ‘We’ll Send You Kids’  Oliverian School  in Haverhill,  New Hampshire , which serves
students who struggled in traditional schools, is interested in
recruiting similar teenagers from China, headmaster emeritus
Barclay Mackinnon said. When Mackinnon urged agents in China to
tell families about Oliverian’s niche, he “got the sense they
just weren’t hearing me,” he said. “They just wanted to know,
’Will you take kids? We’ll send you kids.’”  The  National Association for College Admission Counseling ,
an Arlington, Virginia, nonprofit group whose members include
colleges and high schools, wants to clean up recruiting of
international students. It announced in July that it will
appoint a commission to set ethical standards and consider
alternatives to  incentive-based compensation  for agents abroad.
Colleges are prohibited from paying incentives to recruit U.S.
students who qualify for federal financial aid. While American
schools use agents worldwide, the practice is especially common
in China because agents are ingrained in its culture, said David
Hawkins, NACAC director of public policy and research.  ‘Bottom Line’  Schools should be “forthright” with Chinese parents about
the makeup of their student bodies, said  Paul Miller , director
of global initiatives for the  National Association of
Independent Schools , a Washington-based group representing 1,400
private schools, including Marvelwood. “We’re not in favor of
schools filling their rolls with full-paying international
students if the only motivation is the bottom line.”  At the Knox School in Nissequogue,  New York , 55 percent of
the 140 students come from China. They pay almost $55,000 the
first year, including $9,600 for English as a second language
and $1,800 for orientation. The ESL fee is justified because
classes are smaller, and price isn’t an issue because China has
a lot of multimillionaires, headmaster George Allison said.  Cheshire Academy in Cheshire,  Connecticut , increased its
Chinese population to 102 of its 210 boarders in the past
academic year, up from five in 2008-09, said Alan Whittemore,
its international admission coordinator.  “You can turn the valve on and off,” said Jay Goulart, the
school’s former interim headmaster. “If you need another 20 kids
at 50 grand a pop, you get them from China.”  Parental Backlash  Cheshire cut the number of Chinese students to 90 this year
because parents complained they might as well have kept their
children in schools in China, Whittemore said.  Cheshire , which
also has 150 day students, provides academic support for about
35 students with learning differences.  “We’re still experiencing” the parental backlash “and still
dealing with it,” said current headmaster Douglas Rogers. “We
don’t want to turn kids away simply because of nationality.”  Signs posted in Cheshire’s academic buildings remind
students that it’s an English-only campus, Rogers said.  Visiting China in June, Rogers was asked to speak to
parents about prep-school education. Instead of the informal
session he envisioned, he found himself in a civic auditorium
speaking to more than 800 people, with 150 VIP’s paying almost
$300 apiece and everyone else at least $50. Ushers collected
tickets with his picture on them.  “I felt a little like a rock star,” Rogers said.  Enrollment Cushion  The Chinese influx has caused tensions at  Chapel Hill-
Chauncy Hall School  in Waltham,  Massachusetts . The product of a
1971 merger between a girls’ school and a boys’ feeder school
for  Massachusetts Institute of Technology , Chapel Hill-Chauncy
Hall occupies 40 acres of woods and wetlands bisected by a brook
and frequented by hawks, turtles and a blue heron. It has 165
students in grades 9-12, including 80 boarders.  The school’s endowment slid to $1.8 million on June 30,
2010, from $2.2 million on July 1, 2008, according to filings.
It has suffered a “slight downturn” in inquiry and application
rates, headmaster Lance Conrad said.  Growing Chinese enrollment has cushioned this decline. Half
of the boarders come from other countries, primarily China, said
Conrad, who declined to provide exact numbers. Eleven new
international students in September came from eight countries,
he said.  Not offered financial aid, the Chinese pay $46,000 for
 tuition and room and board , plus a $1,000 international student
fee added in 2009 to cover costs such as airport transportation
and Lunar New Year celebrations. Unlike Knox and Marvelwood,
Chapel Hill-Chauncy Hall doesn’t charge for English-as-a-second-
language classes because they substitute for regular courses,
Conrad said.  ‘In Our DNA’  Chapel Hill-Chauncy Hall has enjoyed prior spikes in
enrollment from other countries, said Siri Akal Khalsa, the
school’s president, a Brooklyn native who converted from the
Russian Orthodox Church to Sikhism and sports a white turban and
long white beard. “It’s in our DNA to be very globally minded.
There’s been a reapportioning of where students are coming from.
There’s no change in our admissions policy or mission.”  Chapel Hill-Chauncy Hall features a  learning center  to help
students understand concepts and organize assignments. “Nearly
70 percent of our students have been diagnosed with some
learning difference, including things like ADD, ADHD, or
Dyslexia,” according to the school’s website.  ‘Assymmetrically Excellent’  “Nearly 70 percent” is a “misprint,” Conrad said. The
statistic was dropped from the website after a Bloomberg
reporter asked about it. Less than half of students have been
diagnosed with learning differences, said Conrad, who declined
to give a percentage for its U.S. students.  Chapel Hill-Chauncy Hall attracts “asymmetrically
excellent” students, he said. Their intelligence is often
“bodily kinesthetic or naturalistic,” which is under-appreciated
in public schools, rather than linguistic or mathematical-
logical, said Conrad, referring to Harvard Professor Howard
Gardner’s theory of multiple types of intelligence.  Shuyang Shen, whose father is a clothing exporter in
southeast China, enrolled at Chapel Hill-Chauncy Hall as a
sophomore in January 2009. Her agency, Guangzhou-based  EIC
Group , one of the biggest in China, didn’t tell her that many of
her U.S. classmates would have learning disabilities, she said.  Shen soon noticed that some of them had short attention
spans or said “random things” in class, including one student
who spouted pro-Hitler and pro-Stalin slogans, she said. “He
knows he has a problem but he can’t stop,” she said.  ADD ‘Normal’  During her senior year, a roommate told her that attention
deficit disorder was prevalent at the school. Before then, “I
thought it was normal in the U.S,” said Shen, 19, who graduated
second in her class in June and is a freshman at the  University
of Southern California .  It would be “counter-productive” for Chapel Hill-Chauncy
Hall’s agents to tell Chinese parents about its learning-
disabled population, Khalsa said.  “In many Asian countries, the idea of any sort of learning
difference is anathema. Even to talk about any learning
difference translates into, ‘Not my child.’”  Khalsa is “aware of abuses that can happen at the ground
level when people are paid to recruit kids,” he said.  EIC has sent three students to Chapel Hill-Chauncy Hall
since 2008 and received no complaints, spokeswoman Yalan Chan
said in an e-mailed response to questions. The agency isn’t
aware that the school serves students with attention-deficit
disorder, she said. “Neither the school’s information, website
or publicity materials indicates this,” she said.  Chinese Roommate  As a junior, Shen wanted an American roommate so she could
improve her English, she said. Instead, she was assigned a
newcomer from China. When she asked why, dorm parent Paula
Buerger told her, “We have too many Chinese here, we can’t
arrange it, you can help her,” said Shen. Buerger, who is also
the school librarian, declined to comment.  Rooming Chinese students together bothered their parents as
well, said Cathy Lindamood, the school’s former director of
academics. “I had numerous conversations with families to assure
them we were trying to place students with American roommates,”
she said.  Headmaster Conrad said he hasn’t received any complaints
from Chinese parents about the number of students from China.
Under school policy, first-year students from the same culture
can’t room together, he said. Returning students have more
leeway.  ‘Mix It Up Monday’  Chinese and American students occupy separate tables in the
cafeteria, said senior Justin Gerard. To encourage mingling, the
student government held a “Mix It Up Monday” last year. “It was
a moderate success,” he said.  The clustering of Chinese students in the dining room
doesn’t bother Conrad. “They need that opportunity to
decompress,” he said.  Chinese students dominate advanced math classes, students
said. Lauren Bass was one of two Americans in her math class
last year along with a dozen Chinese, she said. “It was an
interesting class, especially when we would do group work,” said
Bass, now a freshman at the University of  Vermont .  “The Chinese students would speak in Chinese,” she said.
“I’d sit there with them and I’d have no idea what was going
on.”  If a Chinese student was having difficulty in class, the
teacher communicated with parents through an agency, said
Lindamood, associate director of international programs at
Augustana College in Sioux Falls,  South Dakota .  Messages Controlled  “If a student was struggling academically, I would contact
the agency,” she said. “Grade reports went to the agency. They
controlled the message back home to the parents.”  This interposition between school and parent is a hallmark
of  International Student Education Services Inc.  in Pottstown,
 Pennsylvania , which Conrad said supplies “half or less than
half” of Chapel Hill-Chauncy Hall’s Chinese students. ISES
represents 57 U.S. high schools, and works with more than 100
agents in China, including Shen’s agency, EIC Group. The agents
sent hundreds of Chinese students to U.S. high schools through
ISES in 2010.  Chapel Hill-Chauncy Hall depends on ISES for international
students because the small school can’t afford to market itself
worldwide, Conrad said. “We turn away many students from ISES
whom we don’t believe are mission-appropriate,” he said.  When a student is placed, ISES receives a tuition discount
from the school and charges the family full price, according to
a person familiar with its operation. It shares the difference
with the Chinese agent. By acting as a conduit for a school’s
contact with parents, ISES collects a portion of returning
students’ tuition, said the person familiar with ISES.  All About Revenue  Agents are “all about these additional sources of revenue,”
said Sklarow, director of the consultants’ association. “What
kind of school thinks it’s not healthy to communicate directly
with a parent?”  While ISES “helps us with passing information to families,”
parents can look at student grades and attendance as well as
notes from teachers on a secure website, Conrad said.  “Many parents do not speak English so we forward reports
and all communication to our regional office in China to
translate so the parents are properly informed,” Diane Andres,
ISES vice president for operations and enrollment, said in an e-
mail.  Study Group , based in Sydney,  Australia , with offices in
China, has also referred international students to Chapel Hill-
Chauncy Hall, including senior David Chen. Growing up in
Shanghai and  Taiwan , Chen dreamed of studying physics and music
at MIT, he said. When elite U.S. boarding schools placed him on
their waiting lists, Study Group recommended Chapel Hill-Chauncy
Hall as a safety, he said. The agency dodged his questions about
the school’s average SAT scores, Chen said.  ‘A Misunderstanding’  “The first day I got here, I was asking, ‘Did anybody here
go to Harvard or MIT?’” Chen said. “They all acted shocked.
Nobody here ever went to Harvard, MIT or any top 10 school.”  No Chapel Hill-Chauncy Hall graduate entered MIT in 2007-
2010. Of the eight elite Ivy League colleges, only Cornell
enrolled at least one graduate of the boarding school during
that time, according to the school’s website.  “Our expectation and normal practice would be to ensure
students have the full information they need,” said Nick Rhodes,
a New York executive of Study Group, which represents about 12
U.S. high schools.“It may be a misunderstanding.”  The school can’t control how agents portray it, Conrad
said. “There’s no way on this great earth I can tell you what
they say and what their marketing approach is.”  Chapel Hill-Chauncy Hall has discontinued its relationship
with Study Group, he said.  Dismayed by the school’s college placement record, Chen
considered transferring. Instead, he began to enjoy himself.
Because his courses were undemanding, he had time for friends
and outside interests. He took four  Advanced Placement  tests on
his own.  “I’ve developed my personality a lot,” Chen said.
“Everything turned out for the best.”  No Questions Asked  Chinese students at Marvelwood aren’t always so sanguine.
Perched on a hillside overlooking the Housatonic River valley,
Marvelwood provides “a structured environment and intense
faculty involvement” for “students who have not previously been
able to perform to their capabilities,” according to its
website. Its mission “to fill the gap between conventional
college preparatory schools and strictly remedial schools” has
“remained fundamentally unchanged.”  That’s not the mission Todd Holt pitched on his annual
recruiting trips to China as Marvelwood’s admission director
from 2005 to 2008. Asked if he told Chinese parents about the
school’s learning-disabled population, Holt said, “There was no
reason to bring it up unless they had questions about the types
of students their kid would be going to school with. In general,
they wouldn’t ask that question.”  Foreign Student Body  Marvelwood worked in China with many agencies, most of
which were paid by families rather than the school, Holt said.  When Alfred Brooks joined the school’s board in 2000, fewer
than one in five students came from abroad, he said. By the time
he retired as chair in 2010, almost 40 percent of its 170
boarding and day students were foreigners, predominantly
Chinese, he said. Those students pay $46,500 for  tuition, room
and board , $4,800 for English-language classes, and a $995
international student fee introduced in 2008.  “The core mission expanded,” Brooks said.  “The Chinese -- they’re high achievers,” he said. “Almost
without exception, you’ll find that they get the highest grades.
They’re very, very motivated. A lot of the students we have are
very unmotivated. You have to find a way to motivate them.”  ‘Don’t Know English’  Asked if recruiting the Chinese fits the mission, English
department chairman W. Michael Augusta said, “Their learning
difference is they don’t know English.” He added, “Our Pacific
Rim population is helpful to our balancing the budget.”  Chinese enrollment at Marvelwood declined to “three dozen”
in September, Goodearl said. If Marvelwood takes a student
through an agent, that agent should be paid by the family, not
the school, he said. Marvelwood, which had $1.4 million in
endowment funds as of June 2010, offers financial aid to
international students, he said.  The surge in Chinese enrollment dismayed both American and
Chinese students at Marvelwood.  “There were some times when the American students would get
a little annoyed,” said 2011 graduate Adam Shapiro. “The Chinese
students would hang out in big groups, 15 or 20 students. It was
just very separated. There was supposedly a rule that the
Chinese kids were supposed to speak English. They never followed
through with it.”  Cultural Boundaries  “When I was at Marvelwood, I always hang out with people
from my own country,” said Shanghai native Qian Wang, 20, who
graduated in 2010 and is a sophomore at Michigan State
University in East Lansing. “I cannot learn different language
or culture.”  Lack of progress in English hampered 2011 graduate Po Kai
Chang’s transition from Marvelwood to Michigan State. Chang, 19,
comes from Taiwan, which more than doubled the number of
students it sends to U.S. boarding schools to 512 in 2010-2011
from 206 five years earlier, according to  Homeland Security .  Chang, who hung out mainly with Taiwanese friends in his
three years at Marvelwood, was admitted on a  provisional basis 
to Michigan State because he scored below the university’s
minimum on an English test, he said. He is taking English full-
time and must become proficient within a year to remain
enrolled.  “We want to improve the fluency of every student so they
can transition smoothly to their next destination,” Goodearl
said.  Poor English  Chang applied to transfer from Marvelwood to a Pennsylvania
private school with fewer Chinese students, he said. It rejected
him due to his poor English, he said.  “Most of the Chinese students wanted to transfer,” said 18-
year-old Yu-Tung Cheng, also from Taiwan, who was valedictorian
of Marvelwood’s 2011 class and is now a freshman at the
 University of Wisconsin . “Then we found out the process of
transferring was really complex, and most of us gave up.”  Neither Marvelwood, her parents, nor her “A” average could
deter Guan Wang from transferring. “It’s easy to get good grades
at Marvelwood,” said Wang, who enrolled there in January 2009.
“It’s not a really strict school. The education level was below
what the agent promised.”  After two terms, Wang decided to switch to the all-girls’
Ethel Walker School in Simsbury, Connecticut, in September 2009.
More selective than Marvelwood, Ethel Walker admits 66 percent
of applicants, according to  boardingschoolreview.com , which
compiles self-reported data from schools.  More Scenic  Her parents, who work in energy companies in China, balked
at first. “They said, ‘You just got here, stay where you are.’
Finally I told them my reasons. They support me,” Wang said.  Marie Gold, chair of the  English Language Learners’ 
department, tried to persuade her to stay. Gold told her that
Marvelwood’s rural surroundings were more scenic than Simsbury,
an affluent Hartford suburb, Wang said. Gold didn’t respond to
e-mailed questions.  At Ethel Walker, which doesn’t specialize in working with
learning-disabled students, Wang was one of two Chinese students
in her grade, she said. She graduated in June and is a freshman
at the University of  California , Davis, majoring in
environmental science and management.  “I loved the Ethel Walker School,” she said. “The American
students were very friendly and studied very hard.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
