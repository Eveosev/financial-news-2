Kingdom Holding Co. (KINGDOM) , controlled by
Saudi billionaire Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, said third-quarter
profit jumped 24 percent as income from investments and
dividends increased.  Net income rose to 197.7 million riyals ($53 million) from
160 million riyals a year earlier, the company said in a
 statement  to the Saudi bourse today. Operating income rose 13
percent to 210.8 million riyals.  Kingdom Holding in August hired Saudi Binladin Group to
construct the world’s tallest tower in Jeddah at the cost of 4.6
billion riyals. The company and its partner Bahrain Telecom Co.
last month abandoned plans to buy a 25 percent stake in Zain
 Saudi Arabia , the kingdom’s third-largest mobile-phone company
by market value, for $950 million .  The company’s profit grew as a result of income from
dividends and investments even as some of its units and hotel
management companies struggled in the region, said the company.
"Kingdom Holding will continue to achieve strong results and to
distribute dividends," Prince Alwaleed said in a separate
statement.  The shares closed unchanged at 7.25 riyals in  Riyadh  before
the earnings were announced, valuing the company at 26.8 billion
riyals. The stock has declined 11.6 percent this year compared
with a 7.8 percent drop in the benchmark Saudi  Tadawul All Share
Index. (SASEIDX)   To contact the reporter on this story:
