Macau will keep the number of its
gambling tables unchanged through 2013, Francis Tam, the cityâ€™s
secretary for economy and finance, said in a statement on the
government website.  The number of tables will stay within 5,500 through 2013
and will annually increase 3 percent in the 10 years after 2013,
Tam said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
