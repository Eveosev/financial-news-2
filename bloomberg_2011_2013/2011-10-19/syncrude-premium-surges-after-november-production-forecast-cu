Syncrude’s premium to West Texas
Intermediate surged the most in more than seven months after
Syncrude Canada Ltd. was said to slash its November production
forecast by 1.3 million barrels to 8.7 million.  The forecast reduction is because additional work must be
done during a turnaround at the Syncrude upgrader in  Alberta ,
said a person with knowledge of the situation who declined to be
identified because the information isn’t public. The work
started in early September.  Syncrude’s premium to WTI strengthened $4.10 to $13.25 a
barrel at 2:02 p.m. in  New York , according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Syncrude is a light, low-sulfur synthetic oil derived
from the  tar sands  in Alberta.  The discount for Western Canada Select widened 90 cents a
barrel to $10.15 below the price for WTI. Bakken oil’s premium
added 75 cents a barrel to $2.25 above the U.S. benchmark.  Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium to WTI narrowed 15 cents to
$25.25 a barrel while Light Louisiana Sweet lost 10 cents to
$25.40 above the U.S. benchmark.  Among sour, or high-sulfur, grades, the premium for Mars
Blend decreased 10 cents to $21 a barrel and Poseidon added 35
cents to $19.35 a barrel over WTI.  Southern Green Canyon’s premium increased $1.75 to $19.75 a
barrel and West Texas Sour’s discount widened 5 cents to 75
cents a barrel. Thunder Horse’s premium increased 50 cents to
$23.25 above the benchmark.  To contact the reporter on this story:
