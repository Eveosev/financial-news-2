South Korea ’s won touched a one-
month high after the nation agreed to increase a currency-swap
accord with Japan to $70 billion, helping to counter concern
Europe’s debt crisis will worsen. Bonds rose.  Moody’s Investors Service cut Spain’s credit rating by two
levels, its third downgrade since June 2010. German Chancellor
Angela Merkel said yesterday that a European Union summit on Oct.
23 will mark an “important step,” though not the final one, in
solving the debt crisis. Korean President  Lee Myung Bak  and
Japanese Prime Minister  Yoshihiko Noda  reached the agreement
including a one-year, $30 billion dollar swap line and a won-yen
agreement of the same amount after a summit in  Seoul  today.  “Market players are finding it hard to take a strong
position ahead of the European summit, making the won move
within a certain range,” said Jeon Seung Ji, a currency analyst
at Samsung Futures Inc. in Seoul. “Exporters’ selling dollars
to convert income may support the currency.”  The won climbed 1.2 percent to 1,132.30 per dollar in Seoul,
after weakening as much as 0.2 percent earlier, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The currency touched 1,128.53, the
strongest level since Sept. 19.  The government’s benchmark three-year bonds advanced for a
second day. The yield on the 3.5 percent notes due June 2014
fell one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 3.44 percent,
