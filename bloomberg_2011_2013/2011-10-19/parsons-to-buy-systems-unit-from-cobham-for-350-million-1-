Parsons Corp. agreed to buy analytic
solutions from  Cobham Plc (COB)  for $350 million, adding the missile
services provider to its broader engineering business.  Privately held Parsons is acquiring the business on a cash
and debt free basis, Cobham said in a statement. The divestment
will dilute its earnings by about 5 percent and the proceeds
from the sale will be reinvested, the U.K. company said today.  Cobham held an auction for the business after changes to
U.S. government tendering rules that “diluted the strategic
benefit” of owning it. The move also reflects Chief Executive
Officer Andy Stevens’ aim to focus Cobham on markets where the
company has scale and a competitive edge with technology.  “It’s about $100 million more than I thought they might
get for it,” Royal Bank of Scotland analyst  Sandy Morris  said
by phone.  Shares of the Wimborne, southern England based company
climbed 3.4 percent to 178.1 pence as of 9:43 a.m. in  London ,
valuing the business at 1.93 billion pounds ($3 billion).  To contact the reporter on this story:
