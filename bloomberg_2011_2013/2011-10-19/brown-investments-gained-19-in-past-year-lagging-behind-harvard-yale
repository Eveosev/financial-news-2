Brown University’s investments
returned 19 percent in the past fiscal year, lagging behind the
performance of Harvard and Yale, the richest Ivy League schools.  The endowment was valued at $2.5 billion as of June 30,
after $69 million in new gifts and $111 million in spending, the
Providence, Rhode Island, school said in a  statement  on its
website.  Endowments at the richest U.S. universities have risen for
two consecutive years, following record losses in the aftermath
of the September 2008  Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ)  bankruptcy.
Investments at the $19.4 billion fund at  Yale University  in New
Haven, Connecticut, gained 22 percent.  Harvard University , the
world’s richest school with a $32 billion fund, increased 21
percent.  After Lehman, Brown’s investment committee “chose to hold
a portfolio with slightly less market exposure than in prior
years,” the school said. As of June 30, the fund was composed
of 21 percent in global stocks, 31 percent in hedged strategies,
22 percent in private equity, 14 percent in real assets and 12
percent in fixed income and cash.  Brown, the last of the Ivy League schools to report,
generated an average annual return of 7.7 percent over the past
decade, compared with Yale’s 10 percent increase and the 9.4
percent gain of Harvard, in Cambridge,  Massachusetts .  The Ivy League consists of eight private schools in the
northeastern U.S. Columbia University’s $7.8 billion endowment
was the best performer this year, with a 24 percent investment
gain. Dartmouth College, in Hanover,  New Hampshire , was the
worst, with an increase of 18 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
