A unit of  Reckitt Benckiser Group
Plc (RB/)  that makes Durex condoms lost a bid to have a U.K. court
intervene in a dispute with an Indian supplier that has
disrupted global supplies of the brand.  Reckitt asked a London judge to force TTK Lig, the largest
manufacturer of Durex products, to resume supply. It hasn’t
provided any condoms since a pricing dispute in May.  The matter should be dealt with by an Indian tribunal, a
U.K appeals court said today. “The court was asked to make an
order that would require an unacceptable degree of supervision
in a foreign land,” said Judge Stanley Burnton.  TTK makes half of all Durex condoms sold globally and the
spat has caused “serious disruption” to supply, Burnton said.
Reckitt has already run out of some stocks, and factories in
China and  Thailand  are at full capacity. Reckitt Benckiser
brands account for 83 percent of the U.K. condom market,
according to court documents.  TTK, an Indian joint venture with Slough, England-based
Reckitt, appointed new directors and raised its prices earlier
this year. It has not complied with Indian court orders made to
resume supplying condoms to Reckitt, according to today’s
ruling.  The case is continuing in  India , “but we are unable to
provide further information as it is a legal proceeding,”
Andraea Dawson-Shepherd, a spokeswoman for Reckitt, said in an
e-mailed statement.  The case is: SSL International Plc v. TK-L1G Ltd.,  High
Court  of Justice (London),  Chancery Division , HC11C02075  To contact the reporter on this story:
