Rents for capesize vessels that haul
iron ore rose as  Barclays Capital  said lower prices for the
steelmaking raw material may spur demand for shipments to  China .  Daily rates gained 0.8 percent to $29,918, according to the
 Baltic Exchange  in  London , after dropping 5.3 percent from the
10-month high reached Oct. 14. Capesizes are the biggest vessels
tracked by the Baltic Dry Index, a broader gauge of commodity-
shipping rates, which increased 0.2 percent to 2,140.  Monthly iron-ore shipments to China, the top steelmaker
globally, will average 60 million metric tons from September
through December, UBS AG said in a report dated Oct. 13. That
would exceed the record 59 million tons imported in the first
quarter of 2011, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  “We expect freight rates on routes carrying  iron ore  to
China to maintain the current state of buoyancy for a few more
weeks,” Barclays analysts including Miswin Mahesh in London
said in an e-mailed report today. Rents for capesizes on the
Brazil-to-China iron-ore route gained 2.2 percent to the highest
level since November, according to the exchange.  Prices for iron ore imported into the Chinese city of
Tianjin retreated for an eighth session, declining 1.7 percent
to $147.70 a ton, according to figures from The Steel Index Ltd.  Still, capesize rates may be “lower by year end” because
of steel prices that have dropped to a 10-month low in China and
fewer building projects in the country, according to Barclays.
Hire costs are up 50 percent in 2011 and have more than tripled
since the start of August.  Ore Stockpiles  Lower Chinese steel prices are weighing on profits,
spurring some producers to consider advancing maintenance or
cutting output, according to the report. Iron-ore restocking is
likely to be limited as “financial restraints” curb new
construction work, Barclays said.  Bookings of capesizes in the spot, or single-voyage, market
dwindled to a single vessel today,  Omar Nokta , a New York-based
analyst at investment bank Dahlman Rose & Co., wrote in an e-
mailed report.  Daily rents for panamax ships, the largest that can
navigate the Panama Canal, declined 0.7 percent to $16,708.
Supramaxes, about 25 percent smaller, increased for a 32nd
session in a row, rising 0.3 percent to $16,851. Handysize
ships, the smallest tracked by the index, decreased 0.1 percent
to $11,968.  To contact the reporter on this story:
