Germany ’s auction today of a
benchmark 10-year top-up bond that gained bids lower than the
volume offered mirrors the “increased nervousness” of the
market, the Federal Finance Agency said in an e-mail after the
auction.  The top-up sale had a bid/cover ratio of 1.1, or 4.5
billion euros. Demand for German debt “endures in a volatile
market,” the agency said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
