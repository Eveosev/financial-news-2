Sonova Holding AG (SOON) ’s first-half
revenue sank 8.2 percent, more than forecast by analysts, on the
Swiss franc’s strength and the recall of a hearing implant.  Sales in the six months ended Sept. 30 dropped to 763
million Swiss francs ($851.3 million) from 831.5 million francs
a year earlier, the Staefa, Switzerland-based maker of hearing
aids said in a statement today announcing preliminary results.
Analysts predicted 783.7 million francs, the average of three
estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  The franc’s strength against the euro and the dollar cut
sales by 17 percent, the company said. Sales of hearing
instruments increased 11 percent in local currency terms,
boosted by Phonak Spice and Unitron ERA products, Sonova said.  Sonova recalled the HiRes 90K cochlear implants, made by
its Advanced Bionics unit, in November because of a malfunction
that led to “severe pain, overly loud sounds and/or shocking
sensations.” The company received approval in September from
U.S. regulators to resume sales. Sonova said it began selling
the product again outside the U.S. in mid-April.  First-half earnings will be  announced  Nov. 15. Sonova is
briefing investors and analysts at a hearing-aid conference
today in  Germany .  Sonova rose 0.3 percent to 76.75 francs at the close in
Zurich yesterday. The stock has fallen 35 percent this year,
giving the company a market value of 5.1 billion francs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
