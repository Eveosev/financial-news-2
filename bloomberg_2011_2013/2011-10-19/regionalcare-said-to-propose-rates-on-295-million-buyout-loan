RegionalCare Hospital Partners Inc.,
a provider of health-care services, set the  interest rate  on a
$295 million first-lien  term loan  it’s seeking to back its
purchase of Essent Healthcare Inc., according to a person with
knowledge of the transaction.  The debt will pay 6.25 percentage points to 6.5 percentage
points more than the London interbank offered rate, said the
person, who declined to be identified because the terms are
private. Libor, a rate banks charge to lend to each other, will
have a 1.5 percent floor.  RegionalCare is proposing to sell the loan at 96 cents to
97 cents on the dollar, the person said, reducing proceeds for
the company and boosting the yield to investors.  The first-lien term debt will have one-year soft-call
protection of 101 cents, meaning Brentwood, Tennessee-based
RegionalCare would have to pay lenders 1 cent more than face
value to refinance the debt during the first year, the person
said.  Citigroup Inc. is arranging the deal and lenders must
submit commitments by Oct. 31 at 5 p.m. in  New York .  The company is also seeking a $100 million revolving line
of credit due in five years and a $65 million second-lien term
loan due in 7 1/2 years, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  John Bakewell, chief financial officer of RegionalCare,
declined to comment.  First-lien debt is repaid first in a bankruptcy or
liquidation, second-lien debt is repaid next. In a revolving
credit facility, money can be borrowed again once it’s repaid;
in a term loan, it can’t.  To contact the reporter on this story:
