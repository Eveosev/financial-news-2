Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT) , the world’s
largest defense contractor, won a U.S. agency ruling that
prevents Raytheon Co. from obtaining a trademark on the name
“Paveway” for laser-guided bombs.  Paveway is a generic term, a board at the U.S. Patent and
Trademark Office in Alexandria,  Virginia , said in a Sept. 27
decision that rejected Raytheon’s request. Both Lockheed and
Waltham, Massachusetts-based Raytheon make bombs with the name.  Raytheon, the world’s largest missile maker, had sought
exclusive rights to the name after Bethesda, Maryland-based
Lockheed began supplying laser-guided bombs to the U.S. Air
Force and Navy and international customers, Lockheed said today
in statement. Lockheed had filed notice of opposition to the
registration request in 2005.  The agency’s decision “fully recognizes Lockheed Martin as
one of two U.S. government-qualified sources for paveway II
precision guided systems,” Joe Serra, a senior manager for
precision guided systems at Lockheed, said in the statement.  The case is Lockheed Martin Corp. v.  Raytheon Co. (RTN) ,
Opposition No. 91174152, Trademark Trial and Appeal Board, U.S.
Patent and Trademark Office (Alexandria, Virginia).  To contact the reporter on this story:
