India’s 10-year bonds declined for
the first time in three days on speculation the central bank
will increase borrowing costs for the seventh time this year at
its policy review next week.  The  Reserve Bank  of India will lift the repurchase rate by
25 basis points to 8.50 percent on Oct. 25, according to 10 of
14 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. Four predict no change.
Inflation has stayed above 9 percent for 10 months through
September. The pace of price gains is above the central bank’s
“comfort level,” Governor  Duvvuri Subbarao  said last week.  “The market consensus is there may be one more rate
hike,” said  Anoop Verma , a fixed-income trader at Development
Credit Bank in Mumbai. “Investors may refrain from adding to
their holdings as inflation is still high.”  The yield on the 7.8 percent notes due April 2021 rose
three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 8.78 percent in
Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading system. The
benchmark wholesale-price index rose 9.72 percent from a year
earlier in September, according to government data.  The cost of one-year interest-rate swaps, or derivative
contracts used to guard against fluctuations in borrowing costs,
rose two basis points to 8.23 percent, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
