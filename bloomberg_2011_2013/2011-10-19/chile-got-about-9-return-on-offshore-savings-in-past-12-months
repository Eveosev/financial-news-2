Chile ’s offshore savings returned
about 9 percent in the past 12 months, Chile’s Finance Minister
Felipe Larrain told a conference in Santiago today.  Larrain said he is focused on long-term results for the
sovereign wealth funds, which stand at about $18 billion, and
sees no fiscal “drama” if the price of copper drops below
forecast levels. Chile is the world’s biggest copper producer.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
