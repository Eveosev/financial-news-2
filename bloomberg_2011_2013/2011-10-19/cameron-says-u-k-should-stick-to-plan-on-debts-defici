U.K. Prime Minister  David Cameron 
said the euro debt crisis means it will take longer for the
British economy to return to “normality” and demonstrates the
need to continue cutting the country’s budget deficit.  “The problems of the euro area and the marked slowing in
the world economy” have lengthened the time it will take to
return to normality, Cameron said in his weekly question-and-
answer session in the House of Commons in  London  today.  “It means we should stick to the plan of dealing with our
debts and our deficit.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
