A 1 billion-pound carbon capture and
storage project at Longannet in eastern  Scotland  has been
shelved by the government, the Herald newspaper reported, citing
an unidentified person in the Scottish government.  An announcement is expected from the Department of Energy
and Climate Change within days, the newspaper said.  The DECC had pledged 1 billion pounds to the project,
though partners including Scottish Power, the  National Grid Plc (NG/) 
and  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  say the project needs 1.5 billion
pounds in state funding to make it viable, said the Glasgow-
based newspaper.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
