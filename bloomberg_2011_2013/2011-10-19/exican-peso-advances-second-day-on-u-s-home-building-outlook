Mexico ’s peso bonds rallied as
investor demand for the higher-yielding securities overshadowed
concern about  Europe ’s debt crisis before a meeting of the euro
region’s leaders.  The yield on Mexico’s benchmark peso-denominated bonds due
in 2024 fell one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 6.51
percent at the close of trading in Mexico City, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The price rose 0.14 centavo to
130.73 centavos per peso. Yields on Mexico’s bonds have dropped
10 of the past 11 days.  Euro-area leaders assembled in Frankfurt seeking to narrow
divisions before an Oct. 23 summit to confront the region’s
sovereign debt crisis. As the European “headlines have turned
very convoluted” the  interest-rate  differential between Mexico
and developed markets continues to lure investors to the Mexican
notes, according to  Enrique Alvarez , the New York-based head of
Latin America fixed-income research at IdeaGlobal. Mexico’s
central bank kept its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 4.5
percent on Oct. 14, compared with near-zero rates in the U.S.,
Europe and  Japan .  The bonds’ rally is “a function of what you continue to
see externally, which is a number of conflicting stories on the
resolution of the sovereign crisis,” Alvarez said by phone.
“On the U.S. side, as usual, you see a sort of a very mixed bag
on the economy.”  The peso weakened 0.6 percent to 13.4595 per  U.S. dollar ,
from 13.3809 yesterday. The currency has dropped 8.3 percent
this year.  Traders didn’t trigger any of the dollar options available
today, Mexico’s central bank said on its website. The central
bank has been buying as much as $600 million through the options
every month since March 2010 to bolster foreign reserves.  To contact the reporter on this story:
