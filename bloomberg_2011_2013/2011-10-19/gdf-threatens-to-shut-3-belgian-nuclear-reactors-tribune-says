GDF Suez (GSZ)  SA is threatening to close
its three oldest Belgian nuclear reactors if the country
introduces new taxes on nuclear power, French daily La Tribune
reported, without citing anyone.  The company would close the Doel 1, Doel 2 and Tihange 1
reactors as early as 2015, according to the newspaper.  Belgian newspaper L’Echo reported yesterday that Elio Di
Rupo, the leader of  Belgium ’s French-speaking Socialist Party
who is in talks to form a government, wants to levy 1 billion
euros a year from GDF’s Belgian unit Electrabel.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
