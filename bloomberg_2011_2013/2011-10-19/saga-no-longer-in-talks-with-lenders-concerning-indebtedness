Saga Tankers ASA (SAGA)  said today it is no
longer in talks with its lenders concerning its indebtedness.  The company entered into agreements for the sale of the
remaining vessels owned by the group except for the vessel
“Saga Agnes,” which has been sold subject to the approval of a
general meeting.   “Following the completion of a potential sale of the
vessel ‘‘Saga Agnes’’, the board of directors will revert with
proposals regarding the company’s future business and
operations,” Saga said. “This may relate to the development of
a new strategy for the company, a change of the description of
the business in the articles of association since the company no
longer will engage in the shipping business or possibly to
propose that the company shall be dissolved and consequently pay
out shareholder values as a dividend.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
