Siemens AG has changed the
guidelines on the age of its supervisory board members to allow
Chairman Gerhard Cromme to serve another term,  Capital  magazine
said, citing internal documents.  Cromme will turn 70 in February of 2013, a month after
supervisory board members are named for the next term, and would
not have been eligible for another term under its previous
guidelines, the magazine said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
