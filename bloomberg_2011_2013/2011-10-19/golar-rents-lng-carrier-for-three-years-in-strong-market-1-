Golar LNG Ltd. (GOL) , the liquefied
natural gas tanker owner led by billionaire  John Fredriksen ,
rented its Golar Grand to a “major oil and gas company” for
three years. The shares jumped the most in a month.  The rental starting March 2012 is expected to contribute
$39 million to annual earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization, Fredriksen said in a statement
today from the headquarters in Hamilton,  Bermuda . The rent is
estimated at $125,000 a day, said Erik Nikolai Stavseth, an
analyst at Arctic Securities ASA in Oslo.  “We continue to see very limited LNG shipping
availability,” Fredriksen said. “The strong underlying market
trend and our large newbuilding program is likely to give rise
to a significant increase in Golar’s earnings in the period 2011
to 2014.”  Golar rose as much as 13 kroner, or 6.5 percent, to 214.5
kroner, the biggest increase since Sept. 20, and was at 211
krona at 1:23 p.m. in Oslo trading. The stock has more than
doubled this year. There is an option to extend the Golar Grand
rental period for another three years, the company said.  The rental rate is based on daily expenses of $14,000 for
350 operating days, according to Stavseth. “Given the tightness
presently witnessed in the LNG shipping market, we think
charterers will be willing to pay a higher rate to lock in
tonnage over the next two to three years,” he wrote.  In comparison, rental income for very large crude carriers
hauling 2 million barrels of Middle East oil to  Asia  were at
minus $2,155 yesterday, compared with $177,000 a day in 2008,
according to the London-based Baltic Exchange. Rates to hire
capesize ships, used to carry iron ore and coal, were $29,669 a
day, up 48 percent this year, according to the exchange.  About 90 percent of world trade is transported by sea, the
Round Table of Shipping Associations estimates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
