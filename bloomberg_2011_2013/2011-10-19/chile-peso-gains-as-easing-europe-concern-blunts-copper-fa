Chile ’s peso strengthened for the
first time in three days as global stocks and the euro climbed
before a gathering of European leaders aimed to stem the
region’s debt crisis.  The peso advanced 0.4 percent to 508.73 per  U.S. dollar  at
10:39 a.m. Santiago time from 510.92 yesterday.  “The strengthening of the peso earlier today can be
explained by the global weakening of the dollar versus the euro
after news yesterday came out that Europe could expand its
rescue fund,” said Sergio Tricio, head of research at
ForexChile in Santiago. “Now it’s paring as the price of copper
falls.”  Europe’s leaders are set to meet Oct. 23 to discuss ways of
increasing the region’s firepower in combating the credit
crisis. German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble hasn’t
specified how much additional strength the European bailout fund
may have and negotiators are still in “intensive discussions,”
ministry spokesman Martin Kotthaus said today. The  Guardian
newspaper  said yesterday Germany and France agreed to boost the
area’s rescue fund.  The MSCI All-Country World Index climbed 0.6 percent. The
euro appreciated 0.7 percent to $1.3843.  Copper, Chile’s biggest export, dropped 1.8 percent to
$3.299 a pound by 8:10 a.m. on the Comex in  New York . Prices are
up 4.7 percent this month after plunging 25 percent in
September.  To contact the reporter on this story:
