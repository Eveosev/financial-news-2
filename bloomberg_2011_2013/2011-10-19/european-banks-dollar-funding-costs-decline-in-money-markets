The cost for European banks to
convert euro interest payments into dollars fell as policy
makers prepare to meet on resolving the euro-area’s debt crisis.  The one-year  basis swap , the rate banks pay to convert euro
payments into dollars, was 66 basis points under the euro
interbank offered rate as of 12:22 p.m. in  London , from 66.5
yesterday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Europe ’s leaders are set to meet Oct. 23 to discuss ways of
combating the crisis that’s forced the European Central Bank to
prop up Spain and  Italy ’s bond markets and put France’s top
credit rating under pressure. The Guardian newspaper said
yesterday  Germany  and France agreed to boost the area’s rescue
fund, while a person with direct knowledge told Bloomberg News
no deal has been reached.  “There is some market-friendly news in the Guardian
article, but in the medium term it does feel that a lot rests on
whether  France  can keep its AAA and market confidence for ring-
fencing Spain and Italy to be successful,” Jim Reid, head of
fundamental strategy at Deutsche Bank AG in London, wrote in a
note to investors today.  The three-month cross-currency basis swap is 91 basis
points below Euribor from 90.5 yesterday. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point.  A measure of banks reluctance to lend to one another in
Europe fell. The Euribor-OIS spread, the difference between
Euribor and overnight index swaps, was 74 basis points from 76
yesterday. That compares with 89 basis points on Sept. 23, when
the measure was its widest since March 2009.  ECB Deposits  Overnight deposits at the  European Central Bank  rose. Banks
parked 172 billion euros ($237 billion) at the Frankfurt-based
ECB yesterday, up from 165 billion euros on Oct. 17. That
compares with a year-to-date average of 60 billion euros.  Three-month Euribor -- the rate banks say they pay for
three-month loans in euros -- rose to 1.582 percent from 1.579
percent yesterday. One-week Euribor fell to 1.161 percent from
1.166 percent.  The three-month dollar London interbank offered rate, or
Libor, rose for the 29th day to 0.412 percent from 0.409
percent, according to the British Bankers’ Association. That’s
the highest since Aug. 5, 2010.  The TED spread, or the difference between what lenders and
the U.S. government pay to borrow for three months, was little
changed at 39 basis points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
