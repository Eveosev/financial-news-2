The Latvian  Constitutional Court 
ruled part of a credit-institution law violates property
protection rights, helping a claim by Parex Banka AS investors
who say their holdings were diluted in the bank’s split-up.  Investors including Amber Trust SCA, Firebird, KJK Capital
and East Capital lodged an appeal to the court after their
stakes were diluted and left in the bad bank.  The investors saw their 8 percent stake in Parex reduced to
2 percent after the institution required a state rescue in 2008
and turned to the court since they were not allowed to purchase
new shares or participate in capital increases.  “We do understand that you can’t go back in time and make
the capital increases void,” said Antti Partanen, who
represents the investors, in an interview. “We need to wait for
the government to form properly. When that is done we expect a
person or persons or a team that can work constructively with us
in ways to resolve the dispute.”  Latvia poured 1.1 billion lati ($2.2 billion) of state
guarantees, capital and liquidity support into Parex after the
state rescue, which forced the country to turn a group led by
the European Commission and the  International Monetary Fund  for
a 7.5 billion-euro ($10.4 billion) loan.  Initially Latvia took a 51 percent stake in the lender,
later increasing it to 85 percent before splitting the lender
and re-capitalizing it.  To contact the reporter on this story:
