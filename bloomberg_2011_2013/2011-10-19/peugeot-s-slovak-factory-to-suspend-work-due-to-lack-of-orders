PSA Peugeot Citroen’s Slovak factory
will suspend production for nine days as orders for models
assembled in the east European country fall short of the plan,
the carmaker said.  Lines at the factory in Trnava, western Slovakia, will halt
output from Oct. 28 to Nov. 4 and from Nov. 14 to Nov. 18, Ivana
Pavelkova, the spokeswoman for the Slovak unit, said today in an
e-mailed statement. Slovakia has public holidays on Nov. 1 and
Nov. 17.  New car registrations in  Europe  rose 1.1 percent in
September from a year ago, compared with 7.8 percent in August,
as rising concern that the euro-region’s sovereign-debt crisis
may lead to a recession damps demand. Sales of the PSA group,
which also makes Citroen-brand models, slumped 13.3 percent from
a year earlier last month.  Peugeot’s Slovak factory assembles Peugeot 207 cars as well
as the Citroen C3 Picasso. Last year, it produced about 186,000
vehicles.  To contact the reporter on this story:
