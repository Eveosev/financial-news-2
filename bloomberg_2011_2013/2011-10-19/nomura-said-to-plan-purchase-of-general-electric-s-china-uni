Nomura Holdings Inc. (8604) , Japan’s
largest brokerage, plans to buy  General Electric Co. (GE) ’s finance
unit in China to expand into yuan-denominated products, a person
with knowledge of the matter said.  Nomura is awaiting approval from Chinese regulators to
acquire GE Capital Finance (China), said the person, declining
to be identified because the matter is confidential.  Nomura’s Tokyo-based spokeswoman Keiko Sugai declined to
comment. Two calls to GE Capital’s Shanghai office weren’t
immediately answered.  Nomura will apply to convert GE Capital’s Shanghai-based
business into a bank if it wins approval for the acquisition,
the Wall Street Journal reported earlier today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
