Groupon Inc., the largest online-
coupon site, plans to begin marketing its initial public
offering to investors before the end of October, three people
with knowledge of the plans said.  Meetings could start as early as next week, said two of the
people, who asked not to be identified because the discussions
are private. Chicago-based Groupon is seeking as much as $750
million in its IPO, according to a June filing with the
Securities and Exchange Commission.  Groupon delayed earlier plans to pitch the offering to
investors in September amid stock-market swings, people familiar
with the matter said at the time. The company also needed extra
time to address regulators’ questions, including possible
revisions to a controversial accounting method used in its
filing, the people said.  Those events, combined with the loss of two chief operating
officers in six months, have made investors wary and may force
the company to pare back the size of its IPO. When Groupon met
with underwriters earlier this year, the company’s potential
valuation was said to be pegged at $25 billion.  Morgan Stanley (MS) ,  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  and  Credit Suisse
Group AG (CSGN)  are leading Groupon’s offering.  All Things Digital, the technology blog, reported yesterday
that Groupon plans to begin meeting with investors on Oct. 24 or
Oct. 25.  To contact the reporters on this story:
