Incoming European Central Bank
President  Mario Draghi  said there can be no economic growth or
financial stability in  Europe  without fiscal discipline.  “The ECB had become a custodian of fiscal discipline,”
Draghi said during a speech in  Frankfurt  today. “We all know
now that we can’t have either growth or financial stability
without fiscal discipline.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
