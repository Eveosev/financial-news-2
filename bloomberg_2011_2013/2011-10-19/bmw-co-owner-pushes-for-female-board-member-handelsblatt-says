Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW)  will
next year seek to get a woman on its management board following
pressure from one of its co-owners,  Handelsblatt  reported,
citing unidentified people within the company.  A female candidate may take the position of personnel chief
Harald Krueger and BMW will probably also look for applicants
outside the company, the newspaper said. Susanne Klatten, a
member of the Quandt family which is the companyâ€™s biggest
shareholder, is pushing for the move, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
