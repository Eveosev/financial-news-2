Hungary is planning for a two-pillar
pension and health insurance system, Prime Minister  Viktor Orban 
said.  “We are thinking of an insurance market in the future
which is based on two pillars,”  Orban said at a conference in
Budapest today. “This goes for pensions as well as health
insurance.”  Orban said the two pillars were a “strong” state pillar
and a strengthening private pillar.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
