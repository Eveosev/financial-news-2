Incoming European Central Bank
President  Mario Draghi  said his predecessor Jean-Claude  Trichet
led the ECB through its most difficult period.  “It wasn’t easy for central bank governors,” Draghi said
at an event in Frankfurt today.“The traditional culture that
prevailed until about four years ago, was one where central
banks would deal with their primary mandates. You were the first
to grasp the importance of financial stability.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
