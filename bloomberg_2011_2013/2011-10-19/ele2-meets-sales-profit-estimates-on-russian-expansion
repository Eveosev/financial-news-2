Tele2 AB (TEL2B) ,  Sweden ’s second-largest
telephone company, reported third-quarter profit in line with
estimates as it expanded in Russia.  Net income was 1.26 billion kronor ($190 million),
declining from 2.48 billion kronor a year earlier when it booked
a tax gain. Revenue from continuing operations gained 3.4
percent to 10.3 billion kronor from 10 billion kronor last year.
Analysts had anticipated net income of 1.28 billion kronor on
sales of 10.3 billion kronor.  Tele2 expanded its market share in Russia, Chief Executive
Officer Mats Granryd said in a  statement  today. The operator
signed up 681,000 new Russian customers in the quarter through
channels including food stores and post offices, bringing its
base in the country to 20.4 million.  “Tele2  Russia  will keep looking for possibilities to
carefully expand its operations through new licenses as well as
by complementary acquisitions,” the company said in the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
