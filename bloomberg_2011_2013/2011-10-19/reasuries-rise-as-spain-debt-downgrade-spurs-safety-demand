Treasury 10-year notes snapped a
loss from yesterday after a Moody’s Investors Service downgrade
of  Spain ’s credit rating added to concern that Europe’s
sovereign-debt crisis is spreading.  Ten-year yields were about half a percentage point away
from a record low as France and Germany strive to reach an
agreement on bolstering a European bailout fund. The  Federal
Reserve  is scheduled to buy $4.25 billion to $5 billion of
Treasuries maturing from October 2017 to August 2019 today,
according to the central bank’s website, as part of its plan to
keep borrowing costs down.  “This is a pretty long, hard slog for Europe,” said Su- Lin Ong, head of Australian economic and fixed-income strategy
at  RBC Capital Markets  in Sydney. “That will definitely cap any
further backup in U.S. yields.”  Benchmark 10-year rates were little changed at 2.17 percent
as of 6:29 a.m. in  London , according to Bloomberg Bond Trader
prices. The 2.125 percent security due in August 2021 changed
hands at 99 18/32.  The notes were up as much as 7/32, or $2.19 per $1,000 face
amount, in Asian trading.  The rate dropped to a record low of 1.6714 percent on Sept.
