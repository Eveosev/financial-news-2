California  sold $1.8 billion in
general-obligation bonds, including 10-year securities yielding
3.70 percent, up from 3.51 percent during marketing to
individual investors, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The yield on $118 million in 10-year tax-exempt bonds is
128 basis points above an index of top-rated debt of the same
maturity, a Bloomberg Valuation Index shows. That’s up from a
gap of 109 basis points when California sold $2.4 billion of
general-obligation debt last month. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point. The spread aligns with a forecast last week
from Gary Pollack at Deutsche Bank Private Wealth Management.  “Given the market we confronted, we’re satisfied with the
results,”  Tom Dresslar , a spokesman for Treasurer Bill Lockyer,
said in a statement. “We’re confident we got the best deal
possible for taxpayers.”  The most-populous U.S. state is rated A1 by Moody’s
Investors Service, its fifth-highest ranking. Yields on top-
rated 10-year bonds fell for a fourth day to 2.42 percent, after
reaching a two-month high of 2.58 percent Oct. 14.  California’s securities are in short supply after Governor
 Jerry Brown , seeking to curb debt-service costs, imposed a nine-
month sales moratorium that cut issuance by more than half from
last year. Buyers may also be encouraged by spending cuts that
would be triggered if revenue trails projections by at least $1
billion this fiscal year.  Long Rates Rise  About $450 million, the deal’s largest portion, matures in
2041 at a rate of 5.03 percent. That’s higher than the 4.87
percent yield offered during individual pricing and 136 basis
points more than an index of top-rated 30-year state and local
debt, according to a BVAL index.  In other sales today, the Hudson Yards Infrastructure Corp.
in  New York  sold $1 billion of debt to extend the No. 7 subway
line to  Manhattan ’s west side. The deal included $650 million of
bonds maturing in 36 years with a yield of 5.1 percent. The
bonds are rated A by  Standard & Poor’s , its sixth-highest grade.  To contact the reporter on this story:
