U.K. gilts fell for the first time
in three day as reports that France and  Germany  have agreed to
expand a bailout fund for stricken euro-area economies reduced
demand for the safest assets.  Ten-year yields climbed from the lowest in a week as the
 Guardian newspaper  reported that German Chancellor  Angela Merkel 
and French President Nicolas Sarkozy agreed to boost the
European Financial Stability Facility to 2 trillion euros ($2.77
trillion) from 440 billion euros. Group of 20 finance ministers
and central bankers will meet on Oct. 23 to discuss the debt
crisis. The pound strengthened against the dollar, yen and euro
as U.K. stocks rose.  “They have promised to come up with something so they’ve
got to deliver at least part of a solution,” said  Elisabeth Afseth , a fixed-income analyst at Evolution Securities Ltd. in
 London . “That’s why risk markets are doing better today and the
safe-haven asset markets are moving lower.”  The 10-year gilt yield rose three basis points, or 0.03
percentage point, to 2.46 percent at 4:19 p.m. London time,
after dropping to 2.40 percent yesterday, the lowest since Oct.
7. The 3.75 percent security due September 2021 fell 0.270, or
2.27 pounds per 1,000-pound face amount, to 111.225.  U.K. government debt has returned 12 percent this year,
according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. German bunds have
risen 7.1 percent, and U.S. Treasuries gained 8 percent.  The pound strengthened 0.6 percent to $1.5806 and advanced
0.6 percent to 121.41 yen. Sterling appreciated 0.4 percent to
87.18 pence per euro.  Fund Inflows  The U.K. currency advanced versus all but one of its 16
major counterparts as the  FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  climbed 0.5 percent.  “Evidence from some of the flows in the market suggests
some very large overseas investors are buying the pound in order
to purchase U.K. assets,” said  Neil Jones , head of European
hedge-fund sales at Mizuho Corporate Bank Ltd. in London.
Additional bond purchases by the central bank “should boost
U.K. asset prices,” he said.  The  Bank of England  raised the ceiling for so-called
quantitative easing to 275 billion pounds from 200 billion
pounds at its Oct. 6 meeting. All nine members of the Monetary
Policy Committee also voted to keep the key  interest rate  at a
record low of 0.5 percent, according to  minutes  of the gathering
released today.  Central bank Governor Mervyn King said yesterday the global
recovery is faltering and monetary policy is limited in its
capacity to revive the U.K. economy.  King “was talking about the necessity for global
imbalances to be rebalanced and he talked about the  exchange
rate  as having a necessary part to play in that,” said Jane Foley, a senior currency strategist at Rabobank International in
London. “It reinforces the dovishness of the bank and the fact
that they would be willing to see sterling weaken further.”  The pound has declined 1.2 percent in the past six months,
according to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes, which
measure a basket of 10 developed-market currencies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
