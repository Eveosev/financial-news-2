Poland ’s central bank will
“certainly” keep  interest rates  unchanged for the rest of this
year, Elzbieta Chojna-Duch of the Monetary Policy Council was
quoted today as saying by PAP newswire.  Some rate-setters said that domestic borrowing costs may
remain steady for several quarters at this month’s policy
meeting, Chojna-Duch said, according to PAP. Others said that
interest rates are more likely to be increased than cut after a
period of stability, the newswire reported Chojna-Duch as
saying.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
