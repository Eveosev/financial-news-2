Following is the text of
 Canada 's leading indicators report from  Statistics Canada .  The composite leading index was little changed in
September for the fourth month in a row. In September, 6
of the 10 components continued to expand, the same number
as in August. The weakness in the index was concentrated
in the stock market and the manufacturing sector, largely
offsetting the rebound in the housing sector.  Composite leading indicator  All of the components related to household demand
increased. Housing led the gains with a 1.2% increase, its
largest monthly advance since the spring. The upturn in
housing helped boost furniture and appliance sales by
0.4%. Demand for other durable goods increased for the
third straight month. Consumer services were the leading
component of the gain in services employment.  All three manufacturing components decreased, compared
with two the month before. New orders fell 0.7%, after
back-to-back gains of 3.4%. While sales rebounded after
two straight declines, the ratio of shipments to
inventories continued to fall, reflecting rising stocks of
finished goods. The average workweek dipped for the fourth
straight month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
