Harvard University economics
Professor  Martin Feldstein  said today that “there’s no question
that  Greece  is going to default.”  “There’s no way that with a debt-to-GDP ratio of 150
percent, rising by 10 percentage points this year, with
unemployment in double digits, with GDP falling at a very fast
pace that they can go on the way they have been,” Feldstein
said in an interview on CNBC television.  Asked whether he would recommend Greece’s leaving the euro
region, Feldstein said: “I think if they could do it without
being punished by the rest of the EU members, that would be a
good thing for them.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
