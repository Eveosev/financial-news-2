Britain’s tax authorities said they
will reimburse 2.5 billion pounds ($3.9 billion) of income tax
to 6 million workers who were overcharged from 2003 to 2008.  The average payment of about 300 pounds plus interest will
be repaid by the end of next year, Her Majesty’s Revenue and
Customs said in  London  today. Repayments begin today.  “We are getting cases that were left unreconciled up to
date as quickly as possible,” the department said in an e-
mailed statement. “Anyone owed money will be paid back with
interest without the need to contact us.”  The government is looking at ways to alleviate falling
household incomes squeezed by rising inflation, a flat-lining
economy and increasing unemployment. HMRC today said an overhaul
of the tax-collection system will reduce the amount workers
overpay in future.  To contact the reporter on this story:
