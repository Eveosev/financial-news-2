U.S. Bancorp created a fund to
support as much as $75 million in residential rooftop solar
installations by Vivint Solar.  The tax-equity fund will finance about 2,400 residential
solar installations in  New Jersey , Utah, Hawaii and  New York ,
Provo, Utah-based Vivint said today in a statement.  U.S. Bancorp created in June a similar fund with SolarCity
Corp. and worked with East West Bancorp to form one for Borrego
Solar Systems Inc. Vivint, a closely held developer, installs on
consumersâ€™ homes solar-power systems that it owns and receives
monthly payments from the homeowners.  To contact the reporter on this story:
