Olympus Corp. (7733) , the world’s biggest
maker of endoscopes, said it paid a total of $687 million in
advisory fees for its acquisition of Gyrus Group Plc in 2008.  The financial advisory contract was for services including
proposals on buyout targets and structuring transactions, the
company said in a statement today. The fees paid between 2006
and 2010 included a $443 million buyback of preferred shares, it
said.  Olympus issued the statement in response to research
commissioned by its former President Michael C. Woodford, which
said the Tokyo-based company may face legal scrutiny because of
payments made to advisers in the 2008 transaction. The research
includes “assumptions” and “speculations” and is misleading,
Olympus said in the statement.  Shares in Olympus have plunged 45 percent since Oct. 13,
the day before the company fired Woodford, wiping out $3.9
billion of the company’s market capitalization. The shares fell
3 percent, or 40 yen, to 1,377 yen in morning trading today.  The camera maker is considering suing Woodford for causing
confusion among management and damaging enterprise value, it
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
