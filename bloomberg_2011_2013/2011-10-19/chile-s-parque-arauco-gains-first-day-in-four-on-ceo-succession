Parque Arauco SA (PARAUCO) , a Chilean shopping
center developer and operator, advanced after the biggest two-
day drop in a month on optimism about its chief executive
officer succession plan.  Parque Arauco advanced 3.7 percent to 890.11 pesos at the
close in Santiago, the steepest increase since Aug. 11. The
benchmark Ipsa index rose 0.9 percent. The company’s shares fell
4.1 percent during the previous two sessions.  The company announced after the close of trading on Oct. 14
that Andres Olivos had resigned as CEO. It appointed Juan Antonio Alvarez as his successor, according to a statement
posted Oct. 17.  “Surely investors are buying after speaking with the
company and learning that Olivos will remain linked to Parque
Arauco one way or another,” Rodrigo Ordonez, an analyst at the
local brokerage unit of Banco Santander SA, said in a phone
interview today. “The change in management won’t be as terrible
as some had thought.”  Officers at Parque Arauco’s external relations office were
not available to comment, an assistant said by phone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
