Italy’s economy expanded more last
year than previously reported, national statistics institute
Istat said today.  Gross domestic product grew 1.5 percent in 2010 instead of
the 1.3 percent previously reported, Rome-based Istat said after
revising GDP figures in line with new methods by Eurostat, the
European Union’s statistics office.  Italy’s economy shrank 5.1 percent in 2009 and 1.2 percent
in 2008, compared with previously reported contractions of 5.2
percent and 1.3 percent, respectively, Istat said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
