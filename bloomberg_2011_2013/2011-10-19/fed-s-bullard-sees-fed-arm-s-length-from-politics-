James Bullard , president of the
Federal Reserve Bank of  St. Louis , said the central bank is at
“arm’s length” from politics while not being completely
independent of Congress.  Speaking today in St. Louis in a radio interview on
“Bloomberg Surveillance” with  Tom Keene , he said a
“dysfunctional” Congress probably doesn’t want the
responsibility of making monetary policy.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
