Saudi Arabia , the world’s biggest
barley importer, plans to buy 1.9 million metric tons of wheat
in 2011, said Waheed A. Elkhereiji, director general of the
Grain Silos & Flour Mills Organization.  The kingdom “will import slightly more next year,” he
told reporters at a Russian grains conference in  Sharm el-Sheikh 
today. “Consumption is increasing due to the increase in
population and due to the decrease of procurement from the
interior market.”  Saudi Arabia decided in 2008 to gradually phase out all
water-intensive crops including wheat by 2016, after halting
subsidies to grow barley in 2003 to save water, according to the
 United Nations ’ Food and Agricultural Organization. Domestic
wheat production is estimated to have dropped 13 percent to 1.1
million tons this year following adoption of the 2008 decree on
crops, the Rome-based FAO has said.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
