The  Philippines  will consider
selling the main  Manila  airport estimated to raise as much as
$2.5 billion that the government can use to help fund the
construction of an international airport in Clark, north of
Manila, Transportation and Communications Secretary Mar Roxas
said in a statement today.  “All of these are just plans and will not happen overnight
or within one to three years,” Roxas said in the statement. A
study by the transport department showed the 30-year-old Ninoy
Aquino International Airport in the capital has reached
“saturation point” and doesn’t have much room for expansion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
