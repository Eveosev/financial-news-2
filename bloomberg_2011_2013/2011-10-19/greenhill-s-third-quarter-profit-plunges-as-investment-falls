Greenhill & Co., the advisory firm
that has declined 57 percent in  New York  trading this year,
reported a 41 percent plunge in third-quarter profit as the
company recorded a loss on an investment.  Net income fell to $8.56 million, or 28 cents a share, from
$14.5 million, or 47 cents, a year earlier, the New York-based
firm said today in a statement. The average estimate of seven
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was for profit of 20 cents.
Revenue fell 7.81 percent in the first nine months of the year
partly due to a mark-to-market loss of $23.6 million from
Greenhill’s investment in  Iridium Communications Inc. (IRDM) , according
to the statement. Third-quarter revenue declined 28 percent to
$60.4 million from the year earlier.  Greenhill, run by Chief Executive Officer Scott Bok, 52, is
trimming assets to focus on the financial-advisory business. The
company said this month it’s selling its remaining stake in
Iridium over two years to fund repurchases of its own stock.
Iridium closed yesterday at $5.85 a share in New York trading,
giving Greenhill’s stake a value of $56.2 million, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  “In recent weeks we have taken further steps to accelerate
the liquidation of the investments that remain from the merchant
banking business we announced our exit from two years ago,” Bok
said in the statement. “The continuing liquidation of those
assets will generate cash that can be largely returned to
shareholders, as well as reduce the potential for large mark-to
-market impacts on our results of the kind we saw this
quarter.”  Advisory Fees Decrease  Greenhill now owns about 13 percent of McLean,  Virginia ,-
based Iridium, Bok said in a conference call after earnings were
reported.  Greenhill reported a 14 percent decrease in advisory fees
in the third quarter, which fell to $83.2 million from the year
earlier. For the nine months ended Sept. 30, advisory fees
totaled $217.3 million, up from $195.5 million in the same
period a year earlier.  Greenhill spent $30.4 million on compensation expenses in
the third quarter, or 50 percent of revenue, compared with $44.2
million, or 53 percent, in the year-earlier period. For the
first nine months, compensation decreased to $108.4 million, or
54 percent of revenue, from $114.7 million, or 53 percent.  Deal Volume  Deal volume slowed in the third quarter as weaker economic
growth and concern over the European debt crisis delayed
transactions. Companies worldwide announced $525.5 billion in
mergers and acquisitions in the period, compared with $647.2
billion in the second quarter and $620.8 billion in the first,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Greenhill ranks 15th on the M&A financial advisory league
tables, with $66.4 billion in announced deals so far this year.
The firm’s biggest transaction this year -- advising AT&T Inc.
on its proposed $39 billion purchase of T-Mobile USA Inc. from
Deutsche Telekom AG -- could be blocked if an antitrust suit
brought by the  Justice Department  succeeds.  Greenhill declined 83 cents, or 2.3 percent, to $34.72 in
New York trading today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
