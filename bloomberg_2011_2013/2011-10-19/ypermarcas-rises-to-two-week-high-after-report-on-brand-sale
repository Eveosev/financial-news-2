Hypermarcas SA (HYPE3) , a Brazilian company
that sells more than 190 different  consumer goods , rose to a
two-week high after Veja magazine reported the company agreed to
sell two of its cleaning products brands.  Hypermarcas’s shares gained 3.5 percent to 9.65 reais at
5:06 p.m. Sao Paulo time, the highest intraday price since Sept.
30. The benchmark Bovespa index fell 0.7 percent.  Hypermarcas agreed to sell its Assolan and Assim brands,
Veja magazine columnist Lauro Jardim reported, without saying
where he got the information. The company will announce the sale
as soon as today, the Sao Paulo-based magazine said on its
website.  “The move today reflects speculation on the sale of Assim
and Assolan, which has not yet been confirmed,” Caue Pinheiro,
an analyst with Sao Paulo-based SLW Corretora, said in a
telephone interview. “The stock is trading at a discount, which
helps attract investors.”  The Sao Paulo-based company, through its external press
office Grupo Maquina, said it doesn’t comment on market rumors,
according to a representative who asked not to be identified in
accordance with internal policies.  Hypermarcas declined 59 percent this year through
yesterday, while the Bovespa index fell 21 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
