Kang Yoon Hum, an analyst at NH
Investment & Securities Co. in Seoul, comments on  Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s
latest version of its Android software.  Google showcased the  Ice Cream Sandwich  in Hong Kong today
and said Samsung Electronics Co. will begin selling the first
mobile phone using the program in November. Google’s software
has features such as “talk-to-type” technology and facial-
recognition security.  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  unveiled its latest software
earlier this month featuring the Siri voice-recognition
technology.  On how the latest version of Android compares with Apple’s iOS:  “In terms of technology and functionality, it’s hard to
find a big difference between Android and iOS any more. They are
neck-and-neck.”  On whether Apple’s Siri service will give it an edge over
Android:  “Voice-recognition technology itself isn’t new, and it’s
just a matter of how you use it. Apple seems to have further
fine-tuned their algorithm, but it’s hard to say people will buy
the iPhone just because of that.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
