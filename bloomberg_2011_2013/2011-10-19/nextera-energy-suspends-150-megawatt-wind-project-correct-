NextEra Energy Inc. (NEE) , the largest
U.S. wind-energy producer, suspended the permitting process for
a wind farm it’s developing in  South Dakota  until a customer for
the power is found.  The company told the U.S. Energy Department to cancel an
environmental review of its proposed 150-megawatt Hyde County
Wind Energy Center, the agency said today in a statement. The
review was initiated when NextEra requested permission to
connect its plant to the grid.  NextEra “decided not to move forward” with the review
“until we have greater clarity on several issues including
securing a customer for the output,” Steve Stengel, a spokesman
for the Juno Beach, Florida-based company, said today in an e-
mail.  The energy producer has purchased the land and completed
other “environmental field work” for the project, he said.
NextEra may resume work on the wind farm later and would require
a new environmental review, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
