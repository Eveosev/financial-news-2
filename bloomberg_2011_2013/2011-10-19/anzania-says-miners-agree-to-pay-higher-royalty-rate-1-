     Oct. 19 (Bloomberg)-- Tanzania said mining companies
operating in the East African country agreed to pay a higher
royalty rate of 4 percent compared with 3 percent.  “We have basically reached an agreement with the mining
companies on the matter,” William Ngeleja, the minister of
energy and minerals, told reporters today in the northern city
of Arusha.  The new royalty rate that will apply to miners of gold,
copper, silver and platinum will be imposed this year, the
minister said.  “The Ministry of Finance and Tanzania Revenue Authority
are working on the technicalities now,” Ngeleja said. “We are
in the process of implementing reforms in the Mining Act 2010.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
