Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann
said  Jean-Claude Trichet  led the  European Central Bank  with
skill and commitment.  Trichet, whose eight-year term as ECB President ends on Oct.

reporters at an event to honor Trichet in  Frankfurt  today. “The
euro is internally and externally a stable currency, that’s also
