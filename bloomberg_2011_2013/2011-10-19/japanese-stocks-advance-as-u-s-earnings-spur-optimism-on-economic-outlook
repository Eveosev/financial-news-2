Japanese stocks finished higher,
with key gauges paring gains, after a downgrade of Spain’s
credit rating by Moody’s Investors Services overshadowed a
report that  Europe  is close to a deal on boosting the firepower
of a rescue fund for the debt-stricken region.  Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc. (8316) ,  Japan ’s second-
largest lender by market value, added 0.1 percent after swinging
between gains and losses. Nippon Sheet Glass Co., which counts
Europe as its biggest market, dropped 1.2 percent.  Elpida Memory
Inc. (6665)  led declines among suppliers to Apple Inc. after the iPhone
maker’s earnings missed analysts’ estimates.  The  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average gained 0.4 percent to 8,772.54
at the 3 p.m. close in Tokyo, paring gains of as much as 1
percent. The broader Topix index was little changed at 751.49.
The gauge tumbled 16 percent this year amid concerns over
Europe’s debt crisis, cutting the price of the index’s shares to
0.9 times estimated book value, near the lowest since March 2009.  “Without a solid reason to buy, the market loses
momentum,” said  Ryuta Otsuka , a strategist at Toyo Securities
Co. in  Tokyo . “Investors are taking a wait-and-see stance until
the European summit.”  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 0.5 percent
today after Apple missed analysts’ earnings estimates for the
first time in at least six years. The  S&P 500  rose 2 percent in
 New York  yesterday, surging in the final hour of trading, after
the  Guardian newspaper  reported Germany and France have agreed
to boost the rescue fund to 2 trillion euros ($2.8 trillion).  ‘Long-Term Work’  No deal has been reached between the two countries on
expanding the European rescue fund, a person with direct
knowledge of the talks told Bloomberg News. The Guardian report
also contradicted comments by German Chancellor  Angela Merkel ,
who sought to lower expectations Europe would produce a solution
to its crisis during a regional summit on Oct. 23.  “These sovereign debts have built up over decades, so they
won’t be ended with one summit,” Merkel told reporters in
Berlin. “This will require tough, long-term work.”  Spain ’s credit rating was cut for the third time since June
last year by Moody’s Investors Service as Europe’s debt crisis
threatens to engulf the nation. The rating was cut two levels to
A1 from Aa2 by the agency, which kept the outlook negative,
citing the “continued vulnerability of Spain to market
stress.”  Tempered Expectations  Japanese lenders pared gains. Shares advanced earlier after
Bank of America, which yesterday reported it swung to a profit
last quarter, led U.S. financial firms higher. Sumitomo Mitsui
Financial added 0.1 percent to 2,155 yen after gaining as much
as 2 percent.  Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. (8306) , Japan’s
biggest lender, advanced 0.9 percent to 338 yen, paring gains of
as much as 1.8 percent.  Exporters to Europe fell. Nippon Sheet Glass dropped 1.2
percent to 171 yen. Nissan Motor Co., the Japanese carmaker most
dependent on sales to Europe, fell 1 percent to 709 yen.  Construction companies declined after  Obayashi Corp. (1802) ,
Japan’s fourth-biggest builder by revenue, posted first-half
profit that missed its forecast by 12 percent. Obayashi’s
earnings tempered investor expectations about how much the
sector would benefit from the rebuilding effort after the March
earthquake, said Hiroki Kawashima, a Tokyo-based analyst at SMBC
Nikko Securities Inc.  Obayashi sank 3.5 percent to 355 yen.  Shimizu Corp. (1803) ,
Japan’s biggest contractor by revenue, declined 3 percent to 328
yen.  Kajima Corp. (1812) , the second-largest, slumped 5.5 percent to
242 yen, the most on the Nikkei 225.  iPhone Effect  Technology stocks declined after Apple posted earnings that
missed estimates as customers put off purchases of iPhones
before the release of the latest model.  Elpida, which makes computer memory chips, tumbled 5.3
percent to 486 yen.  Toshiba Corp. (6502) , which supplies chips used to
store music and movies on the iPhone, declined 2.4 percent to
332 yen.  Mazda Motor Corp. (7261)  slid 3.7 percent to 158 yen after the
carmaker said it will halt production of passenger cars in
 Thailand  from today until Oct. 22 because of a parts shortage
caused by the nation’s worst floods in 50 years.   DeNA Co., a social media website operator, plunged 7.9
percent to 3,135 yen. Shares declined after the Nikkei newspaper
reported the company would pay 10 billion yen ($130 million) for
a stake in the Yokohama BayStars professional baseball team.  To contact the reporters on this story:
