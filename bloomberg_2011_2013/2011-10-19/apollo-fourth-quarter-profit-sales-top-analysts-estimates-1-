Apollo Group Inc. (APOL) , operator of the
University of Phoenix and the biggest U.S. for-profit college,
posted fourth-quarter profit and sales that beat analysts’
estimates, sending the shares higher.  Net income rose to $188.6 million, or $1.37 a share, from
$41 million, or 28 cents, a year earlier, Apollo said today in a
statement. Earnings excluding some items was $1.02 a share,
topping the 92-cent average of estimates compiled by Bloomberg.
While sales fell 11 percent to $1.12 billion, they exceeded the
average projection of $1.1 billion.  Apollo instituted a program last year to let students try
out classes before enrolling, which helped improve rates of
student retention, the company said. Training programs for
recruiters will help student signups to grow in the “single-
digit” range and remain positive through fiscal 2012, Chief
Financial Officer  Brian Swartz  said on a call with investors and
analysts.  “The company is saying they’re going to have a positive
growth rate of new student starts,” said  Trace Urdan , an analyst
with Wunderlich Securities Inc. in  San Francisco , who has a
“hold” rating on Apollo shares. “That’s off a negative base, but
it’s still a signal that things are going to level off and
become normal.”  Apollo rose 8.6 percent to $47.07 at 11:12 a.m. in New York
trading. It climbed as high as $48.85 earlier, the biggest one-
day gain since June.  The Bloomberg U.S. For-Profit Education Index of 13 college
companies rose 3 percent.  2012 Outlook  Apollo raised its fiscal 2012 revenue forecast to between
$4.1 billion and $4.3 billion. Three months ago, the for-profit
college had projected sales of $4 billion to $4.25 billion for
the period. It expects full-year operating income excluding some
items of $655 million to $780 million, down from a previous
forecast of as much as $800 million, according to the statement.  The company cut fourth-quarter expenses for student
recruitment and marketing. Marketing expenses fell 4.6 percent
from a year earlier to $171 million, primarily from cuts to
spending on  Internet advertising , Apollo said.  Admissions advising costs fell 15 percent to $99.4 million
after Apollo fired student recruiters last year. Costs for
teaching and student advising fell 1.5 percent to $438.5 million
as student enrollment fell, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
