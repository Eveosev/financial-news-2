Visa Inc. (V) , the world’s biggest
payment network, will raise its dividend 47 percent as profits
advance and customers outside the U.S. use their cards more.  The payout will increase to 22 cents a share from 15 cents,
the San Francisco-based company said today in a statement.
Investors who own common stock as of Nov. 18 will be paid on
Dec. 6.  Visa reported four straight profit increases as credit-card
spending accelerated. Chief Executive Officer Joseph W. Saunders
is buying back shares and looking to expand abroad as consumers
shift away from cash and checks.  The board of directors, which authorized the dividend
increase, is “demonstrating their ongoing confidence in the
strength of the business,” Saunders said in the statement.  Visa announced dividend increases of 20 percent last year
and 19 percent in 2009. With today’s action, the stock yields
about 1 percent annually. Visa’s total return for 2011 including
stock appreciation and dividends was 34 percent through
yesterday. Visa gained 0.6 percent to $94.50 in early New York
trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
