Renaissance Lifestyle Communities
Inc. plans to raise about C$260 million (C$257 million) in an
initial public offering to buy retirement facilities across
 Canada , according to two people familiar with the transaction.  Renaissance will sell shares for C$10 each in a sale
expected to close in November, said the people, who asked not to
be named because the terms aren’t public. The sale would be
Canada’s fourth-largest IPO this year, after Gibson Energy Inc.,
Parallel Energy Trust and Dundee International Real Estate
Investment Trust.  Renaissance was created in February to own and operate
private-pay Canadian retirement communities, according to an
Oct. 14 filing with regulators. The Vancouver-based company
plans to buy a portfolio of 20 facilities in British Columbia,
 Alberta , Saskatchewan and Ontario, the filing said.  Renaissance would be the first Canadian IPO of at least
C$100 million since Burlington, Ontario-based renewable
chemicals company EcoSynthetix Inc. sold shares in July.
Companies have raised $2.4 billion in initial stock sales in
Canada this year, down from $4.56 billion in the same period a
year ago, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  BMO Nesbitt Burns and  CIBC World Markets  are leading a
group of 10 banks on the sale.  To contact the reporter on this story:
