Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh
said he is ready to sign an agreement for a handover of power if
there are guarantees for its implementation from Gulf nations,
the U.S. and  Europe .  Saleh also said the opposition must show “good intention”
that the accord would be put in place, he said today in a
televised address.  A proposed United Nations resolution calls on Saleh to
implement the Gulf Cooperation Council-brokered deal, under
which he would resign and transfer power to his deputy in return
for immunity from prosecution for his family and inner circle.  The U.S. wants to see Saleh go, State Department spokesman
Mark Toner said today.  “He’s reneged on his promise to sign the agreement several
times now,” Toner said. “This agreement has been carefully
vetted by all the parties” and should move ahead, Toner said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
