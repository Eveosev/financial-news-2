Gold may climb to $1,800 an ounce
next month before sliding as commodities drop and some investors
sell to cover losses in other assets, said  John Taylor , founder
of FX Concepts LLC, the world’s largest currency hedge fund.  The metal may reach between $1,750 and $1,800 by late
November, said Taylor, who in July correctly predicted that
bullion would touch $1,900 an ounce by this month. Prices may
then slide to between $1,000 and $1,200 by April or May, where
it would be a “big buy,” he said. Gold set a record $1,921.15
on Sept. 6 and has outperformed commodities, global equities and
Treasuries this year.  November “looks to us like a cyclical high for risk and
for us that would be almost a perfect time for gold to have its
cycle peak,” Taylor, whose firm manages about $5 billion, said
today in an interview in  London . “Then it’s going to be weak
after that. That sort of fits in with our forecast which is
really negative for the economy next year.”  Gold is in the 11th year of a  bull market , the longest
winning streak since at least 1920 in London, as investors
sought to diversify away from equities and some currencies.
Bullion held through exchange-traded products totals more than
the holdings of all but four central banks, which are adding to
reserves for the first time in a generation.  Gold Outperforms  Immediate-delivery gold traded at $1,654.93 by 3:44 p.m. in
London and is up 16 percent this year. The Standard & Poor’s
GSCI Index of 24 raw materials gained 1.5 percent this year, the
MSCI All-Country World Index of equities dropped 9.1 percent and
Treasuries returned 7.9 percent, according to a Bank of America
Corp. index.  Taylor said on July 20, when bullion was at about $1,600,
that prices would reach $1,900 by October. It slipped as much as
20 percent in three weeks after touching an all-time high as
some investors sold the metal to cover losses in other markets.
Gold’s 11 percent slide last month was the most since October
2008. Commodities slid 12 percent in September, the most in
almost three years.  Gold “is really easy to sell, because it’s liquid, so when
people are kind of stressed they’re going to sell it,” Taylor
said. “It is kind of a commodity, and we’re going into a time
when commodities will be under pressure next year. Copper will
look bad too, silver will look worse.”  $5 Trillion Gone  About $5 trillion was wiped off the value of global stocks
last month and commodities plunged on signs economic growth is
slowing. Group of 20 finance ministers and central bankers last
week set a summit this weekend as a deadline for the European
Union to come up with an expanded crisis-fighting strategy.  Holdings of the metal in ETPs were 2,220 metric tons
yesterday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Assets
reached a record 2,299.8 tons on Aug. 8.  “I think it’s probably a big buy” if gold drops to
between $1,000 and $1,200, Taylor said. “There’s nothing to
stop it from going up. Monetary systems are grotesquely screwed
up, especially in  Europe  and also in the U.S. There’s going to
be an awful lot of confusion going on for the next decade.”  To contact the reporters for this story:
