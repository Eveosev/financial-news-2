Mexican lawmakers from the ruling
party and other parties failed to reach an agreement on next
year’s budget with the opposition  Institutional Revolutionary
Party  because of differences on the deficit and oil prices next
year, a congressman said today.  The  PRI , as Mexico’s largest opposition party is known,
wants to raise the proposed  budget deficit  for 2012 to 0.5
percent of gross domestic product from the 0.2 percent proposed
by President Felipe Calderon, said Mario Di Constanzo, a member
of the Finance Committee from the  Labor Party  in the lower house
of Congress.  The PRI seeks a budget deficit of 50 billion pesos next
year, Di Constanzo said. It also wants 20 billion pesos of
additional revenue by changing the exchange rate forecast for
the peso and raising the estimated average price per barrel for
Mexican oil exports by $1 from the $84.9 proposed by Calderon’s
government, he said.  Calderon on Sept. 8 proposed total spending of 3.62
trillion pesos ($290 billion) for next year, an increase of 2.5
percent in real terms from 2011.  The lower house must approve the income portion of the
budget by Oct. 20 and the spending portion by Nov. 15. Lawmakers
are scheduled to resume discussions tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
