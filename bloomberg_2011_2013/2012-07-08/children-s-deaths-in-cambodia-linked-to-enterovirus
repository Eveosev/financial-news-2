The Institut Pasteur in  Cambodia  has
discovered Enterovirus Type 71 in about two-thirds of patients
it tested after a mystery disease killed more than 60 children
in the country, said the head of the institute’s virology unit.  Enterovirus Type 71 is a “perfect explanation” for the
deaths, Philippe Buchy said by telephone today. “We can now
focus on how to contain it,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
