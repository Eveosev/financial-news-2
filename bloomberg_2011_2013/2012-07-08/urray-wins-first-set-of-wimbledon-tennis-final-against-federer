Andy Murray took the first set
against  Roger Federer  in today’s men’s singles tennis final at
Wimbledon as he attempts to end Britain’s 76-year wait for a
male Grand Slam champion.  Murray, who won the set 6-4 on Centre Court at the All
England Club in London, lost his three previous Grand Slam
finals without taking a set.  Switzerland’s Federer, competing in his eighth Wimbledon
final, is aiming to join men’s record holders Pete Sampras and
William Renshaw with seven titles at the tournament.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
