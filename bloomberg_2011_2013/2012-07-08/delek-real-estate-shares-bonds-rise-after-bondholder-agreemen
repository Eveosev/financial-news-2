  Delek Real Estate Ltd. (DLKR)  shares and
bonds surged after the property company controlled by Israeli
businessman Isaac Tshuva reached a 1.5 billion-shekel ($380
million) arrangement with bondholders.  The  shares  of the Ramat-Gan, Israel-based company jumped 12
percent, the biggest gain since May 13, to 0.162 shekel at the
4:30 p.m. close in Tel Aviv, giving the company a market value
of 62.8 million shekels. Delek’s 4.8 percent bonds due February
2019 rose 11 percent to 21.79 agorot on the shekel, the highest
level since June 6.  As part of settlement Tshuva will inject cash and provide
guarantees. The agreement is subject to bondholders’ approval,
the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
