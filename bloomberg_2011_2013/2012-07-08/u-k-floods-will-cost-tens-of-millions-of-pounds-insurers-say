U.K. flooding in the past week will
probably cost tens of millions of pounds, the  Association of
British Insurers  said today.  “These types of events typically cost in the tens of
millions of pounds,” Sarah Bailey, spokeswoman for the London
industry group, said today by telephone.  It’s too early to tell whether the flooding costs will
exceed those caused by floods in November 2009 in Cumbria, which
resulted in insurers paying about 175 million pounds ($271
million), Bailey said.  The U.K. Met Office, the government forecaster, yesterday
 warned  of the possibility of flooding today and some disruption
to travel and outdoor activities across much of  England , after
heavy rain. The River Ouse in York is among locations that
flooded in recent days, the British Broadcasting Corp.  reported
today  on its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
