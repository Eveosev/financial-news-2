Spain  has specific problems with its
banking industry and should recapitalize lenders through the
European stabilization fund, known as EFSF, German Finance
Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble   told El Pais  in an interview.  Europe won’t be able to set up a banking supervisor this
year that could oversee aid sent directly to Spanish banks with
the help of the  European Central Bank , Schaeuble told the
newspaper.  Funds that are channeled through the EFSF will be loans and
not donations and will count towards Spanish debt even though
they come with soft terms, Schaeuble told the newspaper.  To talk about what happens when the European banking
supervisor is up and running would be “building castles in the
sky” and officials need to work within the existing regulatory
framework, he told El Pais. Spain is doing what it needs to and
speculation about whether the country will require a full
bailout is irresponsible, Schaeuble said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
