Na Yeon Choi takes a six-stroke lead
over fellow South Korean Amy Yang into the final round of the
U.S. Women’s Open.  Choi fired a 7-under-par 65 yesterday to end 54 holes at 8-
under 208, followed by Yang, who carded a 69 for a 2-under 214
at Blackwolf Run Championship Course in Kohler,  Wisconsin . Lexi
Thompson, Mika Miyazato and Sandra Gal were tied for third at 1-
under 215.  “I couldn’t believe how I got eight birdies today,” Choi
told reporters. “But I did. And I’m very happy, and I’m very
satisfied and I’m very excited.”  Second-round leader Suzann Pettersen shot a 6-over 78 to
fall to 1-over, one stroke ahead of Michelle Wie, who also had a
78.  “It was a lot of fun being in contention,” Wie said.
“I’m still not out of it. Don’t count me out just yet.”  Choi, who has five career LPGA Tour victories, came into
yesterday’s round at 1-under.  She had four birdies on the front nine, including back-to-
back birdies to start the round. She made a 20-foot putt to
birdie No. 7. Choi then birdied the first three holes on the
back nine as well as the 17th when she sank a 15-foot putt.  “Honestly, it will be a lot of pressure tomorrow,” Choi
said. “But you know, I know what I have to do, and I know what
I can control.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
