  Brazil ’s cocoa grindings in the
second quarter totaled about 57,702 metric tons, 4.8 percent
lower than the same period a year earlier, according to an e-
mail from  Thomas Hartmann , an analyst who compiles the nation’s
cocoa statistics.  The total for June was 19,136 tons, down 5.6 percent from
the same month last year, according to the e-mail. “The drop of
volume for the second month in a row could be a signal of the
falling demand on the domestic market,” he said.  Hartmann is a board member of the Commercial Association of
Bahia, Brazil’s biggest growing region, and is in charge of the
group’s statistical service on the nation’s cocoa output.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
