Jordan Jones  won the  New York City
Triathlon , while Amy Bevilacqua was the first woman to cross the
line in Central Park today.  Jones, a 31-year-old professional from Golden,  Colorado ,
completed the course in one hour, 45 minutes, four seconds.
Bevilacqua, a 39-year-old professional from Wilton, Connecticut,
crossed the line 15 minutes later. Bevilacqua, who was third in
last year’s women’s race, finished 25th overall.  More than 3,300 people completed the 12th edition of the
Olympic distance event, which began with a 1.5-kilometer (0.93
mile) swim in the  Hudson River , followed by a 40-kilometer bike
ride along the Henry Hudson Parkway and a 10-kilometer run.  John Korff, whose company Korff Enterprises Inc. has staged
the race since 2000, made all entrants complete an open-water
swim of at least a half mile within 18 months of the race to
prepare them for conditions in the river after two competitors
died during the swim portion of last year’s race.  Ben Collins , a 29-year-old pro who won the men’s race in
2011, finished second overall in 1:46:38.  Kaleb Vanort  of
Mishawaka,  Indiana , was third, in 1:47:31.  Liz Blatchford , 32, from the U.K. was second in the women’s
race and 26th overall, 20 seconds behind Bevilacqua. Jenna
Parker, a 28-year-old professional from  Santa Monica ,
 California , finished third in the women’s race, in 2:00:57.  Jones, a Boston University graduate, left the Denver Police
Department in 2007 to open and run an online ski shop,  Powder7 .  The first 11 racers to cross the line today were
professional triathletes.  Fast-Growing Sport  Timothy Fallon, a 36-year-old mortgage trader at Merrill
Lynch & Co., finished in 332nd place overall and was third of 60
racers in his division.  The triathlon, which began in  Southern California  in the
1970s, is one of the fastest-growing sports in the U.S.
Membership in USA Triathlon has grown to about 150,000 in 2012,
compared with about 1,500 in 1982.  Bloomberg Businessweek, whose parent company Bloomberg LP
owns Bloomberg News, is one of the sponsors of the  New York  City
Triathlon.  To contact the reporter on this story:
