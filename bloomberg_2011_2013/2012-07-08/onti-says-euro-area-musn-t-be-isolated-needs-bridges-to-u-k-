Italian Prime Minister  Mario Monti 
said the euro area shouldn’t isolate itself and needs bridges to
other countries in the region such as the U.K. and  Poland .  “We need to build bridges to countries such as the U.K.
and Poland which have a huge contribution to make,” Monti told
a conference in Aix-en-Provence, France. While many French
politicians believe it better to focus integration on the euro
area, “I have reservations there,” he said.  “It would be best not to isolate ourselves too much,” he
said. Monti also said that he’s optimistic about progress being
made on European integration.  “When we look back on the period between 1995 and 2015
we’ll see 20 years in which we built a single market, a single
currency and enlargement to the east,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
