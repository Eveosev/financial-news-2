French Finance Minister  Pierre
Moscovici  said he expects euro area finance ministers to make
“tangible progress” on implementing an accord reached by heads
of government on June 29.  “It’s very important that we give tangible signals that
what was said at the European Council will be translated into
action,” Moscovici told journalists in Aix-en-Provence, France.
 “I have no doubt that that will happen.”  The euro group will begin work tomorrow on how to give
support to Spanish banks, and will also consider matters of
unifying euro area bank supervision and giving support to Italy
in the  bond market .  Moscovici said he met with Italian Prime Minister  Mario
Monti  this morning and that they agreed on the analysis of the
situation.  Asked whether  France  is ready to cede sovereignty to help
end the European sovereign debt crisis, Moscovici said that he
prefers to call it “sharing sovereignty.”  “We’re not hostile to integration,” he said. “But every
step of integration has to be accompanied by increased
solidarity. Our objective is to reach the point of sharing the
debt burden in Europe.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
