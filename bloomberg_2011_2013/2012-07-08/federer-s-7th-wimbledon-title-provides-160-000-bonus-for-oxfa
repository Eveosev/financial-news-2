Roger Federer ’s record-tying seventh
Wimbledon tennis title will earn charity Oxfam 101,840 pounds
($158,000) from a bet it didn’t even make.  Oxfam, which aims to fight poverty worldwide, was
bequeathed the bet along with the entire estate of Nick Newlife,
who died at age 59 in 2009. Newlife staked a 1,520-pound bet in
2003, at odds of 66-1, that before 2020 Federer would win the
championship at the All England Club on seven occasions,
bookmaker  William Hill Plc (WMH)  said in a statement.  Newlife “sadly did not live to see Roger land perhaps the
most spectacular bet we have ever taken on tennis,” William
Hill spokesman Graham Sharpe said in the statement.  Switzerland’s Federer recovered from losing the opening set
to beat Britain’s Murray 4-6, 7-5, 6-3, 6-4 on Centre Court
yesterday and tie  Pete Sampras  and William Renshaw with
a record seven titles at the All England Club in London.  It was Federer’s first Grand Slam title since the 2010
Australian Open and returns him to the No. 1 ranking.  To contact the reporter on this story:
