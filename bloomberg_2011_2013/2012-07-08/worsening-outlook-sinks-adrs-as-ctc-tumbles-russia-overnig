The worsening outlook for  Russia ’s
economy sent  CTC Media Inc. (CTCM)  on its biggest weekly decline in
five weeks in  New York  trading and  VimpelCom Ltd.’s (VIP)  American
depositary receipts down the most in a month.  The  Bloomberg Russia-US Equity Index (RUS14BN)  of the most-traded
Russian companies in New York lost 1.1 percent to 89.03 on July
6, the lowest level since June 29 as U.S. unemployment data sank
oil, Russia’s biggest export earner. CTC Media, which owns the
fifth most-watched television channel in Russia, posted the
biggest weekly retreat in five weeks, while VimpelCom, the
world’s sixth-biggest mobile phone provider, sank 4.1 percent.
Futures expiring in September rose 0.5 percent to 134,975.  “A decline in oil price affects not just energy stocks, it
has a lot of impact on the whole market because oil means
economy in Russia,” Vladimir Savov, an analyst at Otkritie
Financial Corp., said by phone on July 6 from Moscow.  Russia depended on revenue from oil and gas for 50 percent
of its 2011 budget, and crude’s 15 percent decline this year
contributed to a tumble in the ruble, which weakened 9.5 percent
against the dollar in the second quarter, the most among 25
emerging-market currencies tracked by Bloomberg. Finance
Minister Anton Siluanov said in Moscow on July 6 that the 2013
budget will be based on a Urals crude price of $92 a barrel,
down from a previous target of $97.  Slowing Growth  The  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  dropped 1.5 percent to 1,414.28 in Moscow
on July 6, trimming its gain for the week to 1.9 percent. The
 dollar-denominated RTS Index  declined 2.2 percent to 1,357.71,
paring the weekly climb to 0.5 percent.  The  Market Vectors Russia ETF (RSX) , the biggest U.S.-traded
exchange-traded fund that holds Russian shares, fell 2.6 percent
to $26.16 on July 6. The RTS Volatility Index, which measures
expected swings in the index futures, rose 0.9 percent to 28.98.  Economic growth in Russia will probably slow to 3.8 percent
this year from 4.3 percent in 2011, according to the median
estimate of 21 economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  Russia needs an average oil price of $117 a barrel to
balance its 2012 budget, according to the government. Urals has
averaged $111.40 per barrel so far in 2012, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  The ruble depreciated 1.1 percent to 32.8650 per dollar on
July 6 in Moscow, extending last week’s loss to 1.2 percent. The
Russian currency weakened against the euro for the first time in
six days on July 6, easing 0.3 percent to 40.42. The Russian
currency dropped 0.6 percent to 36.2455 against the central
bank’s target dollar-euro basket.  ‘Buying Opportunity’  CTC Media, the Nasdaq-listed Russian media company,
retreated 5.3 percent during the week, its 11th consecutive
five-day slump.  The company  said  last week that its audience fell to 8.9
percent in the second quarter, down from 11.1 percent in the
same period in 2011 and 11.5 percent in 2010.  “We do not view this underperformance as a buying
opportunity given the weakness in terms of new products,
uncertain business environment, including economic concerns,
ruble depreciation,” Svetlana Sukhanova, an analyst at UBS AG
in Moscow, wrote in a July 3 report, cutting her recommendation
on the stock to neutral from buy. “It is unclear how quickly
CTC will be able to win back a loyal audience after the new
season begins in August.”  VimpelCom fell 1.8 percent to $7.78 in New York on July 6,
extending its retreat to 4.1 for the week, its biggest weekly
decline since the five days to May 25.  UBS cut its 12-month target price on the stock to $8.50
from $11, reiterating its neutral recommendation on the stock,
according to a July 6 report.  Falling Oil  Oil for August delivery fell 3.2 percent to $84.45 a barrel
on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  on July 6. Crude, which fell
0.6 percent last week, gained 0.6 percent today.  Brent oil for August declined 2.5 percent to settle at
$98.19 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange.
Russia’s Urals export blend fell 2 percent to $98.12 per barrel,
trimming a weekly gain to 1.5 percent.  Oil may rise next week as U.S. inventories fell the most in
six months, a Bloomberg survey showed. Crude  stockpiles 
decreased 4.27 million barrels last week, the biggest decline
since Dec. 16, the Energy Department reported.  Thirteen of 27 analysts, or 48 percent, forecast crude
prices will increase through July 13. Eleven respondents, or 41
percent, predicted that futures will drop and three said there
will be little change in prices.  “We see upside to oil from stable demand and returning
geopolitical risk,” Alex Kantarovich, head of research at
JPMorgan Chase & Co. in Moscow, said by e-mail on July 6. “Our
scenario for the second half of 2012 involves firmer
fundamentals and less  risk aversion .”  United Co. Rusal (486) , the world’s largest aluminum producer,
dropped 1.2 percent to HK$4.31 in Hong Kong trading as of 11:06
a.m. local time. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index fell 1 percent
today after Japanese machinery orders sank the most in more than
five years and Chinese Premier  Wen Jiabao  said the nation’s
economy faces “relatively large” downward pressure.  To contact the reporter on this story:
