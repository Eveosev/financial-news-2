Qatar’s royal family is close to
buying Valentino Fashion Group SpA from Permira Holding Ltd. for
550 million British pounds ($852 million) with an announcement
expected this week,  Sky News reported  on its website, without
saying how it obtained the information.  Qatar’s royal family would make the purchase and not the
country’s sovereign wealth fund, Sky reported.  A representative at the office of the Qatari Emir Hamad Bin
Khalifa Al Thani declined to comment when Bloomberg contacted
him by phone today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
