Game on Dude, a 5-year-old colt owned
by former  New York  Yankee manager  Joe Torre , qualified for North
America’s richest thoroughbred horse race with a victory in the
Hollywood Gold Cup.  Game on Dude carried Chantal Sutherland, making her the
first woman jockey to win the $500,000 race at Hollywood Park in
Inglewood, California. The horse covered the 1 1/4-mile in 2
minutes, 4.19 seconds.  The win qualifies the Bob Baffert-trained colt for an all
fees-paid entry to the $5 million  Breeders’ Cup Classic  on Nov.
3 at Santa Anita Park in Arcadia, California.  “He loves Santa Anita and the Breeders’ Cup has been our
goal,” said Baffert who watched his horse finish second to
Drosselmeyer in last year’s Classic.  Game on Dude paid $2.80, $2.20 and $2.10 on a $2 bet. The
colt’s stablemate, Richard’s Kid, was second to pay $2.60 and
$2.10 and Kettle Corn was third to return $2.60.  Game on Dude is owned by Torre’s Diamond Pride LLC, Lanni
Family Trust and Bernie Schiappa.  To contact the reporter on this story:
