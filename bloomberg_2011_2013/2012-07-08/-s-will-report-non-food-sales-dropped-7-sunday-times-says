Marks & Spencer Group Plc (MKS)  will this
week report non-food sales fell 7 percent last quarter, the
worst trading for three years, the  Sunday Times  reported,
without saying how it obtained the information.  The result will place pressure on  Marc Bolland , the chief
executive officer who’s been at the helm of the U.K. retailer
for two years, the newspaper said. The company’s board may blame
the drop on bad weather as last month was the wettest June on
record, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
