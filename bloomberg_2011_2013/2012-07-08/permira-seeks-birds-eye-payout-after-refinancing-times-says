Permira Advisers LLP is seeking to
recapitalize Birds Eye Ltd., which will provide the owner of the
U.K. frozen foods company with a dividend of 500 million pounds
($774 million), the Sunday Times said, without saying where it
got the information.  Under the plan, Permira, the private equity firm that’s
owned Birds Eye for six years, may increase the food company’s
debt to almost 2 billion euros ($2.46 billion) from 1.4 billion
euros after failing to sell the business earlier this year,
according to the report.  Noemie de Andia, a Permira spokeswoman in  London , declined
to comment when contacted today by phone. The operating profit
of Iglo Foods Holdings Ltd., the Birds Eye holding company
bought by Permira in August 2006 from Unilever Plc, jumped 35
percent in 2011 to 247 million euros, according to that
company’s  annual review .  To contact the reporter on this story:
