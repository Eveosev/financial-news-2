The Wimbledon men’s final between
 Roger Federer  and  Andy Murray  restarted after a 40-minute delay
because of rain early in the third set at the All England Club.  Murray who is aiming to end Britain’s 76-year wait for a
male Grand Slam tennis champion, took the first set 6-4 with
Federer winning the second 7-5. Federer leads the third set 2-1.  Switzerland’s Federer is attempting to secure a first Grand
Slam title since the 2010 Australian Open.  The match is set to be completed under cover on Centre
Court after organizers decided to close the retractable roof
following the rain.  To contact the reporter on this story:
