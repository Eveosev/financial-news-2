The  South African government  plans
new measures to regulate banks and financial services in order
to avoid risky behavior while expanding services, according to
Finance Minister  Pravin Gordhan .  “These changes include a shift to a twin-peaks model for
financial regulation, as well as the split of the regulatory
functions for prudential and market conduct,” Gordhan wrote in
an opinion piece published today in the Johannesburg-based
 Sunday Times  newspaper.  The regulatory changes, which will be implemented in two to
three years, are necessary to protect  South Africa ’s banks from
pursuing risky short-term behavior, Gordhan said.  A twin-peaks system refers to splitting rule-making and
enforcement duties into separate regulatory divisions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
