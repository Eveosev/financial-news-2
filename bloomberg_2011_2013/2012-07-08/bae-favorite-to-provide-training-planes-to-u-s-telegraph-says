BAE Systems Plc (BA/)  is the front runner
to win a contract valued at 7.1 billion pounds ($11 billion) to
provide the U.S.  Air Force  with training aircraft, the Sunday
Telegraph  reported , citing unidentified senior BAE executives.  The company may provide 350 aircraft to be in service
around 2020, with a decision in 2014, according to the report.
BAEâ€™s Hawk plane may be favored because the Air Force does not
want a new type of aircraft due to budget constraints, the
newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
