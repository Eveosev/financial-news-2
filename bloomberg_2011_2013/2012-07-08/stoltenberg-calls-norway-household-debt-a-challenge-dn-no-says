Norwegian Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg said the country’s  household debt  levels are a
challenge, according to an interview published by  DN.no , the
website of newspaper Dagens Naeringsliv.  The risk of a Norwegian housing bubble is reduced by sound
position of the country’s banks, as well as control mechanisms
and financial supervision that’s superior compared with other
European countries, Stoltenberg said, according to the Oslo-
based newspaper’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
