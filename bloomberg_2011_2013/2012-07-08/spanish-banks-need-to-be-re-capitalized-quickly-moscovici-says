Spanish banks need to be re-
capitalized quickly, French Finance Minister  Pierre Moscovici 
said.  “We have to move quickly on banking supervision and we
have to move quickly on the direct recapitalization of Spanish
banks,” Moscovici said today in Aix-en-Provence, France.  Moscovici also said that he expects the euro group of
finance ministers to meet July 20 after meeting tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
