Japanese Foreign Minister  Koichiro Gemba  said he sought “continued cooperation” from the U.S. in
providing information about accidents involving the V-22 Osprey
aircraft.  “Prompt and sufficient information provision is what I
have requested, so Japanese people can feel reassured on the
safety question,” Gemba said today at a Tokyo press briefing.  Security requirements call for “the right equipment,”
though the U.S. understands Japan’s concern about the safety
records of the tilt-rotor military aircraft, Secretary of State
 Hillary Clinton  said at the same briefing.  “It’s very important to us that Japan shares our
confidence that the Osprey is safe to fly,” Clinton said.  The two also discussed realignment of U.S. forces stationed
in Japan and the relocation of Marines on Okinawa.  Clinton urged China and the Asean member-nations to
continue negotiations over territorial claims in the  South China
Sea , expressing hopes they will make progress when the
 Association of Southeast Asian Nations  meets in Cambodia.  “We believe we have a national interest, as every nation
does, in the freedom of navigation and unimpeded legal commerce
in the South China Sea,” Clinton said. “We believe the nations
of South Asia should work collaboratively” to resolve disputes
without coercion, threats or conflict, she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
