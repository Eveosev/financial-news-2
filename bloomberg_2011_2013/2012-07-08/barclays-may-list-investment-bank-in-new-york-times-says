Barclays Plc (BARC)  directors are
considering splitting the group in two and listing the
investment bank previously known as  Barclays Capital  in  New
York , the  Sunday Times  reported, citing insiders it didn’t name.  The rest of Barclays would remain listed in London after
the interest-rate rigging scandal, the newspaper reported.
London-based Barclays said yesterday a split wasn’t being
considered, even as two senior insiders and one former board
member said the plan would be studied, according to the report.  Giles Croot, a Barclays spokesman, declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
