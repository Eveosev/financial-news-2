UN Special Envoy to Syria  Kofi Annan 
arrived in Damascus today for talks with President Bashar al- Assad to try to revive a peace process that he said yesterday
was failing.  Annan, who also represents the  Arab League , said in an
interview published in French newspaper Le Monde yesterday that
the  United Nations  had so far failed to find a political
solution to the violence in the country.  An uprising that began peacefully 16 months ago and evolved
into a deadly confrontation has led the international community
to reconsider its strategy over how to persuade the Syrian
president, whose family has held power for four decades, to
leave.  Syrian forces fought rebels in Aleppo in the north of the
country as they sought to reassert control over the region, the
U.K.-based Syrian Observatory for  Human Rights  said in an e-
mailed statement yesterday. More than 50 people were killed
yesterday, AP reported, citing activists.  The violence has claimed more than 10,000 lives. About
4,000 Syrians have been killed since Annan took on the
peacemaking mission in February, according to the Local
Coordination Committees, an activist group.  UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon has recommended reducing
the number of monitors in Syria, and having the smaller mission
based in Damascus, to encourage a political dialog. The UN
monitors’ three-month mission expires July 20.  The  Security Council  will vote this week on a resolution
based on Ban’s recommendations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
