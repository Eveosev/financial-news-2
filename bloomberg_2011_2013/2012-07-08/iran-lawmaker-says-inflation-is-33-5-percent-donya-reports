An Iranian Parliament member rejected
an inflation figure of 22.5 percent as given by official
agencies, saying the current rate is 33.5 percent,  Donya-e-
Eqtesad  reported.  The figure hasn’t been officially released, Gholamreza
Kateb, the spokesman for the Parliament’s planning committee,
said without giving further detail, the newspaper said.  Iran ’s inflation rate accelerated to 22.2 percent in the 12
months through the Iranian month of Ordibehesht, which ended May
20, from 21.8 percent the previous month, the  Central Bank  said
last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
