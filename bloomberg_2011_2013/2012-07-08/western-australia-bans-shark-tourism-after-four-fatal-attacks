Western Australia  state said it would
introduce rules to ban most shark tourism after four fatal
attacks on bathers in the region over the past year.  The lack of traditional shark gathering sites off the
state’s coast may encourage operators to feed the animals to
attract them to cage dives, changing their behavior in a way
that could pose risks to the public, Norman Moore, fisheries
minister said in an e-mailed statement today. Such operations
will be banned under rules now being drafted.  Western Australia had four fatal shark attacks in a six-
month period from last September to last March, according to
website  sharkattackfile . The state is spending A$14 million
($14.3 million) over the next four years to reduce the risk of
attacks, Moore said.  “I would prefer to take no risks,” he said in the
statement. “The government is not willing to allow any ventures
that may raise even greater public fears than already exist.”  While  studies  in South  Australia  state by Australia’s
government scientific agency, the Commonwealth Scientific and
Industrial Research Organisation, weren’t clear about whether
feeding great white sharks changed their behavior in the long
term, that risk had to be set against economic benefits, he said.  No one had yet applied for a license to operate cage dives
in Western Australia, Moore said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
