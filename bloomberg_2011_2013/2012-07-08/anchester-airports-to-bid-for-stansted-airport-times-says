Manchester Airports Group is
preparing to bid for Stansted Airport, the Sunday Times
reported, without saying where it obtained the information.  Stansted Airport is expected to be put up for sale by its
owner BAA Airports Ltd. later this year, the newspaper said. A
successful bid by Manchester is necessary to close a deal with
Industry Funds Management Pty., which may buy a stake in
Manchester, the Times said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
