Bahrain Mumtalakat Holding Co. BSC,
the sovereign wealth fund that appointed a new chief executive
officer in March, said full-year loss widened as provisions for
impairments increased.  Loss attributable to the shareholder of the parent was
335.8 million dinars ($891 million) in 2011 compared with 265.1
million dinars a year earlier, according Mumtalakat’s financial
statement. Impairment losses climbed to 316.5 million dinars
from 191.2 million dinars.  Mumtalakat, established in 2006, holds stakes in more than
35 companies including Gulf Air, Aluminium Bahrain BSC,  Bahrain
Telecommunications Co. (BATELCO) , and McLaren Automotive Ltd. Mahmood Al
Kooheji, chairman of Aluminium Bahrain, was appointed the CEO in
March, replacing Talal al-Zain. The fund injected 400 million
dinars into Gulf Air in 2010 as the national carrier
restructures amid a slump in business.  “Several restructuring initiatives were undertaken at Gulf
Air to reduce operating losses,” according to a separate
statement on the company website. “However, the regional geo-
political situation and higher fuel costs significantly affected
the operations of Gulf Air and resulted in a higher operating
loss versus the prior year.”  Mumtalakat’s revenue increased 8.4 percent to 1.29 billion
dinars last year, while gross profit rose 5.5 percent to 140.4
million dinars, helped by income from  Aluminium Bahrain BSC. (ALBH)  The
fund had assets of 4.22 billion dinars at the end of 2011
compared with 5.07 billion dinars a year earlier.  The company raised $750 million from the sale of bonds in
2010. The yield on the 5 percent notes maturing June 2015 has
fallen 94 basis points this year to 4.8 percent on July 6,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “We remain in a strong financial position and moving
forward Mumtalakat will continue to play a vital role in the
growth and diversification of Bahrain’s economy, with future
investments and partnerships likely to focus on the kingdom and
the region,” Al Kooheji said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
