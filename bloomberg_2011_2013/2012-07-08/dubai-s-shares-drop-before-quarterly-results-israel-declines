Dubai’s shares fell for the second
time in three days before companies in the emirate start posting
second-quarter results and after oil dropped following a report

results will start flowing in beginning next week,” said Talal Touqan, Abu Dhabi-based head of research at Al Ramz Securities.
“Many traders, who were latecomers in the first upsurge, are
grabbing any opportunity to exit at break-even levels.” Dubai’s

second-quarter results, with Dubai’s companies also scheduled to
begin this month. Dubai Islamic, which has the  second-heaviest
weighting  on Dubai’s index, may post a  26 percent decline  in

to as low as 1.89 dirhams before closing at 1.90 dirhams.  Oil Exporters  Emirates NBD may post a  19 percent decline  in second-

fifth of the world’s oil.  Dubai, the second-largest of seven emirates that make up
the U.A.E., relies on trade, tourism and property for growth.
