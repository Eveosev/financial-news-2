A man arrested last month for
allegedly breaching an order preventing him from crossing
through the Olympic park in  London  will challenge the order in
court tomorrow, the  Sunday Telegraph  reported.  The man, known as CF, travelled through the Olympic games
venue five times between April and May in violation of an order
banning him from using the London Overground rail route that
passes through the center of the park, the newspaper said.  He wears an electronic tag after allegedly attempting to
travel to  Afghanistan  to fight in a jihad and take part in
suicide operations in 2008, according to the report, which cited
a case compiled by Home Secretary Theresa May.  To contact the reporter on this story:
