Sweden ’s central bank has kept
 interest rates  too high for as long as 15 years because
inflation has been below the 2 percent target, said a
spokeswoman for the  Social Democrats ,  Dagens Industri  reported.  Inflation has been about 0.6 percentage points below the
central bank’s target in the period so wage deals and state
budgets have been based on wrong inflation expectations,
damaging the economy, said  Magdalena Andersson , chief
spokeswoman for economic affairs with the Social Democrats,
according to the Stockholm-based newspaper.  The party is the biggest opposition group in Sweden’s
parliament.  To contact the reporter on this story:
