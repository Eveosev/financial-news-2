Fitch Ratings analysts will visit
 South Korea  for their annual review of Asia’s fourth-largest
economy, the  Finance Ministry  said.  The analysts will hold meetings with central bankers,
government officials and think tanks from July 10 to 12, the
ministry said in an e-mailed statement. Fitch will focus on the
country’s household debt, the financial soundness of local banks,
the potential impact of the euro-area crisis on the economy and
geopolitical risk, according to the statement.  The ratings company revised its outlook for South Korea’s
long-term foreign currency issuer default rating to “positive”
from “stable” and affirmed the A+ rating on Nov. 7.  “Sovereign creditworthiness is strengthening as the
sovereign and external balance sheets growth more resilient,”
 Andrew Colquhoun , head of Asia-Pacific Sovereigns at Fitch, said
in a statement at the time. “However, a heavy external debt
refinancing burden in 2012 and the volatile global economic and
financial environment pose risks for the export-oriented economy.
Successfully navigating these challenges over 2012 would support
the case for an upgrade.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
