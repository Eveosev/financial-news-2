The U.K.â€™s  Office for Budget
Responsibility  will propose as much as 50 billion pounds ($77
billion) in further spending cuts or tax increases to stem
public debts, the Sunday Telegraph reported, without saying
where it obtained the information.  The budget office will release its annual Fiscal
Sustainability Report on July 12, the newspaper said. The report
will show that unless further action is taken, by 2060 the
national debt will rise to 120 percent of gross domestic
product, from the current 65 percent, and the deficit will
return to about 7 percent, the newspaper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
