Vale SA, the world’s largest iron-ore
producer, must not limit itself to the Chinese market since
other Asian markets are demonstrating important growth,
President Murilo Ferreira told newspaper  O Globo.   Taiwan, Indonesia and Vietnam are among the countries Vale
will focus on, Ferreira said, according to an interview
published today in the Rio de Janeiro-based newspaper.  The company will direct its investment to a smaller number
of projects that require large amounts of capital, Ferreira
said, according to Globo. Its iron-ore and steel project in
 Guinea  will be delayed because of legislative uncertainties in
that country, he said.  The devaluation of  Brazil ’s currency in the quarter ended
in June will affect Vale’s debt and profit levels because its
debt and revenue are in dollars, Ferreira said, according to
Globo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
