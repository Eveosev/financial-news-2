Zack Shahin, former chief executive
officer of Dubai’s  Deyaar Development PJSC (DEYAAR) , may be released on
bail by July 10 after he obtained 5 million dirhams ($1.4
million) as a guarantee, his U.S.-based lawyer said.  The bail amount is being deposited at the court today, Eric
Akers said in a phone interview. An Emirati friend of Shahin,
who is a U.S. citizen, agreed to guarantee his presence in Dubai
and both of them will surrender their passports to the
authorities, the lawyer said.  Shahin, jailed since March 2008 on charges of corruption
and embezzlement, has been on a hunger strike protesting his
detention while defending against five separate cases.  To contact the reporter on this story:
