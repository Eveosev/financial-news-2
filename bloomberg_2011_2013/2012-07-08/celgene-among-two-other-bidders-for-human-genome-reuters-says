(Corrects to say second bidder will propose merger of
equals in second paragraph)  Celgene Corp. (CELG)  is one of two companies
other than  GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK)  weighing a bid for  Human Genome 
Sciences Inc., Reuters says, citing a source familiar with the
situation that it didnâ€™t identify.  A second unidentified bidder would propose a merger of
equals, Reuters said yesterday. Glaxo has offered to buy Human
Genome for $13 a share, and the U.S. biotechnology company has
set a July 16 deadline for competing bids.  To contact the reporter on this story:
