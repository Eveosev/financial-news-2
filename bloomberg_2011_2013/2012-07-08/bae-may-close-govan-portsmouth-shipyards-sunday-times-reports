BAE Systems Plc (BA/)  may close its Govan,
Scotland, and Portsmouth,  England , ship-building yards in the
U.K. as demand declines, the Sunday Times  reported , citing
industry executives it didn’t identify.  It is thought that BAE Systems wants to shift its shipyard
base to its facility in Scotstoun, a district of Glasgow, the
newspaper reported.  The report is “pure speculation,” BAE said today by e-
mail. “We continue to work closely with the Ministry of Defence
to explore all possible options to determine how best to sustain
the capability to deliver complex warships in the U.K. in the
future,” the company said. “We are committed to keeping our
employees and trade unions informed as this work progresses.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
