China’s  Anton Oilfield Services Group (3337) 
sold a 20 percent stake to Schlumberger Ltd., the world’s
largest oilfield-services provider, Antonoil said.  Schlumberger purchased 423.4 million shares of Antonoil,
the Chinese oilfield-services company said today in a
statement. The shares are valued at HK$635 million ($82 million)
based on Antonoil’s July 6  closing price .  Antonoil said Schlumberger won’t be involved in its
management as a minority shareholder.  The two companies began cooperating in 2010 on drilling
fluids and well-cementing services, Antonoil said. The Middle
East and Asia accounted for 23 percent of Houston-based
Schlumberger’s revenue in 2011, or $8.07 billion, according to
the company’s financial statements.  Stephen Harris, a spokesman for Schlumberger, didn’t
immediately return calls seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
