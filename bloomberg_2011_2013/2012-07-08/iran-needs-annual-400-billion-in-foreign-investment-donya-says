Iran  needs an annual $400 billion in
foreign direct investment to meet its objective of 8 percent
economic growth by 2015,  Donya-e-Eqtesad  reported, citing Deputy
Economy Minister Behrouz Alishiri.  Iran canâ€™t meet its growth goals with the funds it has at
its disposal and needs alternative ways of financing projects,
Alishiri said, according to the Tehran-based newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
