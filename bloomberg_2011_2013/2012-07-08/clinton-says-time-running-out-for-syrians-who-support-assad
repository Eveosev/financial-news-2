Kofi Annan ’s admission that his
Syrian peace plan is failing should be a “wake-up call” to
those who still support President Bashar al-Assad, Secretary of
State  Hillary Clinton  said.  Annan, a special envoy for the United Nations and the  Arab
League , said “evidently we haven’t succeeded” in finding a
political solution to the violence in Syria, according to an
interview published yesterday in the French newspaper Le Monde.  “Annan was admitting the obvious,” Clinton said at a
press conference today in Tokyo. It “should be a wake-up call
to everyone.”  Violence in Syria is escalating and June was the deadliest
month so far, Clinton said. As many as 17,000 people have died
since the start of the crackdown by the Assad government,
according to the  United Nations .  Rising numbers of defections from the regime, including
Assad confident Brigadier-General Manaf Tlas, is a sign that the
“sand is running out of the hourglass,” Clinton said.  “The future to me should be abundantly clear to those who
support the Assad regime: their days are numbered,” she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
