Three Libyan oil ports began export
operations after a halt on July 5 because of protests, said the
chairman of state-run National Oil Corp.  Crude production in the North African country will return
to a level of 1.5 million barrels a day within 24 hours, Nuri Berruien said today in a phone interview from the capital,
Tripoli. “Everything is back to normal since last night,” he
said. “The three ports are open, production is picking up and
ships are getting in to start loading.”  Protesters occupied the ports of Ras Lanuf, Brega and Es-
Sider to call attention to their claims of economic and
political marginalization of  Libya ’s oil-rich eastern province
of Cyrenaica, cutting crude exports by about 300,000 barrels a
day, Berruien said. Libya yesterday held its first free national
election in more than 40 years amid political infighting and
threats of a boycott after an uprising last year ousted  Muammar
Qaddafi .  Libya, holder of  Africa ’s largest crude reserves, is
targeting an average output of 1.5 million barrels a day this
month and capacity is “technically” back at pre-war levels of
1.6 million barrels a day, Berruien said in a separate interview
yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
