will also help to promote human rights and especially
marginalized people - women and girls.”  On Syria: “We have to implement these security-council
resolutions, including the six-point plan.”  On problems in South China Sea: “I sincerely hope that these
situations can be resolved through diplomatic negotiations and
dialogue.”  On Japan’s desire to become a permanent security council member:
