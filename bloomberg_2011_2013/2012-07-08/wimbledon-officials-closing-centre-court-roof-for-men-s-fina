The roof on Wimbledon’s Centre Court
is closing to allow the men’s final between  Roger Federer  and
 Andy Murray , which has been halted by rain, to continue.  Play was suspended at 1-1 in the third set because of a
heavy shower.  Murray, who is aiming to end Britain’s 76-year wait for a
male Grand Slam tennis champion, took the first set 6-4 with
Federer winning the second set 7-5.  Switzerland’s Federer is attempting to secure a first Grand
Slam title since the 2010 Australian Open.  To contact the reporter on this story:
