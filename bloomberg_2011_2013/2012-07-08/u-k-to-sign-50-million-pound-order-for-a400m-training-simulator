Britain is to pay 50 million pounds
($77 million) for a training simulator for the Airbus SAS A400M
transport aircraft, Prime Minister  David Cameron  said.  The simulator, to be located at the Royal Air Force base at
Brize Norton, will support 50 jobs at Thales Training &
Simulation Ltd. in southeast  England , where the systems are
designed and built. The Ministry of Defense will sign the
contract with  Airbus Military  at the Farnborough Air Show, which
opens today.  Britain has ordered 22 A400M aircraft to replace its fleet
of C-130 Hercules, with the first delivery expected to take
place in 2014.  “From this government you will see nothing less than an
unstinting, unrelenting, unflagging commitment to making Britain
the best place in the world for aerospace businesses to invest,
design, manufacture and export,” Cameron said in a statement
released by his office in  London .  Cameron also pledged 3 million pounds of government money
for 500 masters-level degree places in aerospace engineering
over the next three years. The places will be jointly funded
with industry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
