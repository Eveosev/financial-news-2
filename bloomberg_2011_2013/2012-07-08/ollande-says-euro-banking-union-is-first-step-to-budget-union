French President  Francois Hollande 
said the proposed banking union agreed at the June 29 European
summit is the “first step to a budgetary union, which will open
the way to stability, growth, and tighter ties.”  He said France and Germany must defend the euro with
“strict rules and powerful instruments.”  Hollande spoke in the eastern French city of Reims
alongside German Chancellor Angela Merkel at a ceremony
commemorating the 50th anniversary of the German-French
reconciliation treaty.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
