France  will give priority to
diplomatic methods in Syria and would only consider sending
troops as part of a political transition once President Bashar al-Assad leaves, Defense Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian told Le
Parisien.  France won’t participate in an international peacekeeping
mission without a vote by the United Nations Security Council,
Le Drian told the French daily. He said there are no operations
currently being considered.  France has begun withdrawing its troops from Afghanistan
and will have no fighting units left there by the end of the
year, Le Drian said.  There are no additional job cuts planned at the Ministry of
Defense, though the unit will reduce its administrative costs,
Le Drian said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
