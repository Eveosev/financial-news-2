Roger Federer  beat  Andy Murray  in
today’s Wimbledon men’s singles final to win the title at the
All England Club for a seventh time.  The Swiss player won 4-6, 7-5, 6-3, 6-4 on Centre Court to
earn his first Grand Slam tennis title since the 2010 Australian
Open.   Federer, who turns 31 next month, will regain the top
ranking in the sport which he last held in 2010.  Murray has now lost all four of his Grand Slam finals.
Britain’s 76-year wait for a male Wimbledon champion will be
extended by at least another year.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
