The Swiss Financial Market
Supervisory Authority, known as Finma, contacted  UBS AG (UBSN)  and
 Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN)  regarding investigations into how the
Libor interest rate was set, Der Sonntag reported.  Finma sent both banks detailed questions about the London
interbank offered rate, the newspaper said, citing people close
to the matter.  Regulators in the U.S., Europe and Asia are investigating
whether banks that help set key rates for $360 trillion of
securities were involved in collusion. Barclays Plc was fined
$451 million in the U.K. and U.S. on June 27 for submitting
false Libor rates.  “We are taking the investigations seriously and are fully
cooperating with the authorities,” Tatiana Togni, a spokeswoman
for UBS AG, said told Bloomberg News by telephone.  Credit Suisse spokesman  Marc Dosch , declined to comment
when contacted by Bloomberg News. Tobias Lux, a spokesman for
Finma, said the regulator is “following the Libor
investigations closely and is in close contact with the banks
concerned.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
