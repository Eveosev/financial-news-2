South Korean producer inflation
moderated to a 31-month low as fresh fruit, vegetable and oil
costs declined, highlighting the room for an interest-rate cut
as central bank policy makers prepare to meet on July 12.  Prices rose 0.8 percent in June from a year earlier, the
smallest gain since November 2009, after a 1.9 percent increase
in May, the  Bank of Korea  said in a statement today. They fell
1.4 percent from the previous month.  Interest-rate cuts in  China  and Europe last week
strengthened the case for a quarter-point reduction in Korean
borrowing costs, according to ING Groep NV. Thatâ€™s a minority
view, with six out of seven economists in a Bloomberg
News survey forecasting that policy makers will leave the
benchmark unchanged at 3.25 percent.  Consumer inflation eased to a 32-month low of 2.2 percent
in June and the  Finance Ministry  on June 28 cut its 2012
estimates for consumer prices and economic growth.  To contact the reporter on this story:
