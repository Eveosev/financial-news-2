Boeing Co. (BA)  expects that export sales
will help extend the life of the California assembly line that
builds the C-17 military transport, a program that had been
targeted for termination.  “I do continue to be reasonably bullish we will achieve
some additional international sales,” Dennis Muilenburg, the
planemaker’s defense chief, said today in London at a briefing
before the Farnborough air show starting tomorrow.  Boeing said in February that a decision was possible this
year to shut operations at the factory in  Long Beach , near  Los
Angeles , as orders for the four-engine C-17 jet dwindled amid
cuts in U.S. military spending. Orders on the books will keep
the line open until the third quarter of 2014.  The U.S. Defense Department awarded Chicago-based Boeing a
$500 million contact on July 6 for the C-17’s “transition to
post production.” That agreement includes asking Boeing to
estimate the cost of ending production, said Chris Raymond, vice
president for business development at the defense unit.  Boeing is seeking new customers and additional orders from
existing buyers. New customers in the  Middle East  are seen as
good prospects, while India holds options for six more planes
and Canada, Australia and the U.K. may buy more, Muilenburg
said.  “Hopefully we can build another of couple of years of line
extension,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
