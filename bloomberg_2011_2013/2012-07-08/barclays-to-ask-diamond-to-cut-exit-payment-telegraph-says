Barclays Plcâ€™s board will ask former
Chief Executive Officer  Bob Diamond  to give up at least part of
a possible 17-million-pound ($26.3 million) exit compensation
package, the Sunday Telegraph reported, without saying where it
got the information.  Discussions have taken place with the Association of
British Insurers, the trade group that represents pension fund
investments, the newspaper said.  Barclays spokesman Giles Croot declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
