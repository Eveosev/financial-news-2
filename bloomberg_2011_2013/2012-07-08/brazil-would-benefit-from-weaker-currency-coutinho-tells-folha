Luciano Coutinho , president of the
state development bank BNDES, said  Brazil  has benefited from the
recent weakening of its currency and a further drop would be
better, according to newspaper  Folha de S.Paulo .  Steep  interest rates , one of the challenges that has long
faced Brazilian industry, are coming down, Coutinho said,
according an interview published today in the Sao Paulo-based
newspaper. The nation is moving toward a level of interest rates
compatible with its macroeconomic condition, he said.  Brazilian businessmen are too pessimistic at the moment
because they are highly affected by short-term considerations,
Coutinho said, according to the paper.  Brazilâ€™s government has taken short-term measures to help
struggling industrial sectors survive, Coutinho said, according
to Folha. It is studying longer-term measures such as tax
measures and boosting public investment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
