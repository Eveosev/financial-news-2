Tottenham said it agreed to sign
Belgium defender Jan Vertonghen from Ajax, subject to the player
passing a medical test.  The 25-year-old is set to be the second signing by the
Premier League soccer club since Andre Villas-Boas was appointed
as manager on July 3, following Gylfi Sigurdsson to White Hart
Lane.  Ajax, the only publicly traded soccer club in the
Netherlands, said on its website the fee will be as much as 12
million euros ($14.7 million). Vertonghen played 220 matches for
the Amsterdam-based club over six years.  At Spurs, he will boost a defense that allowed 41 goals in
38 Premier League games last season as the club finished fourth.
Tottenhamâ€™s center-back options already include  Michael Dawson ,
 William Gallas , Younes Kaboul and Steven Caulker.  To contact the reporter on this story:
