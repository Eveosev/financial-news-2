Roger Federer  took the second set
against  Andy Murray  in today’s men’s singles final at Wimbledon
to tie the match as he attempts to secure a first Grand Slam
title since the 2010 Australian Open.  The Swiss player won the set 7-5 on Centre Court at the All
England Club in London after Murray took the opener 6-4. He is
aiming for a record-extending 17th men’s Grand Slam tennis
title.   Murray, competing in his first Wimbledon final, will end
Britain’s 76-year wait for a male Grand Slam champion if he wins
today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
