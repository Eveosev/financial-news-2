The Swiss central bank should defend
its 1.20 francs per euro limit as the pressure on the Swiss
currency to appreciate will increase, Economy Minister Johann Schneider-Ammann told  SonntagsZeitung  newspaper in an interview.  He doesn’t expect the  Swiss National Bank  to lower the
limit, the minister said according to the newspaper.  Schneider-Ammann said that he is skeptical about the
introduction of negative  interest rates  to prevent the franc
from appreciating as experience shows that those measures aren’t
effective. Still, the Swiss government is examining the
possibility, the minister told SonntagsZeitung.  To contact the reporter on this story:
