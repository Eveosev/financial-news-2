Didier Deschamps, who captained
France to the 1998  World Cup  and 2000 European Championship

the end of last month after France lost 2-0 to eventual champion
Spain in the quarterfinals of Euro 2012.  Deschamps quit his job as Marseille coach on July 2 after
leading the team to the Ligue 1 title in 2010 as well as three
League Cups. The team finished 10th last season.  A previous manager of Juventus and Monaco, Deschamps played
