The Australian and  New Zealand 
dollars touched the lowest levels this month against the yen as
data from the U.S. to China to  Japan  pointed to a slowdown in
the world’s largest economies.  Both currencies remained lower versus the dollar following
a drop on July 6 as Asian stocks extended a global rout, sapping
demand for currencies linked to economic growth. Data published
in Japan today showed the nation’s machinery orders fell the
most in at least seven years, while U.S. data last week showed
weaker-than-estimated jobs growth in June. China said today
consumer prices rose at the slowest pace in more than two years.  “In the near term, we could expect to see the Australian
dollar continuing to come lower in what may be a fairly risk-
averse market environment,” said Ray Attrill, global co-head of
foreign-exchange strategy at  National Australia Bank Ltd. (NAB)   The so-called Aussie slid to 80.96 yen, the lowest since
June 29, before trading at 81.20 as of 4:22 p.m. in Sydney, down
0.2 percent from the end of last week. It fell 0.2 percent to
$1.0190 after losing 0.7 percent on July 6.  New Zealand’s dollar, known as the kiwi, touched 63.30 yen,
the weakest this month, and was 0.2 percent below last week’s
close at 63.45. It fell 0.2 percent to 79.62 U.S. cents
following a 0.7 percent slide at the end of last week.  The Australian dollar may weaken to 98 U.S. cents by the
end of September and 97 by the year-end, Attrill forecast.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  of shares lost 1.5 percent,
after a 0.9 percent drop in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index on
July 6.  Yields Decline  Australian  government bonds  rallied, pushing the yield on
benchmark 10-year debt down as much as 12 basis points, or 0.12
percentage point, to 2.98 percent. The rate on the 15-year note,
the country’s longest-dated debt, touched 3.23 percent, the
lowest since June 5.  U.S. employment rose by 80,000 in June after a 77,000
increase in May, Labor Department figures showed at the end of
last week. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg News had projected a
gain of 100,000.  Machinery orders  in Japan, an indicator of  capital
spending , slumped 14.8 percent in May from April, the Cabinet
Office said today. Data from  China ’s National Bureau of
Statistics showed consumer prices rose 2.2 percent in June from
a year earlier, the slowest pace in 29 months.  The New Zealand and Australian dollars were the best
performers in the past month among 10 developed-nation
currencies tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes.
The kiwi added 3.6 percent during the period, while the Aussie
gained 2.9 percent.  ‘Take Profit’  The Australian dollar is trading near the 50 percent
retracement level of $1.0219 from the Feb. 29 high to the June 1
low as well as its 200-day moving average of $1.0265, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. After the recent advance in the
currency, investors are inclined to “take profit” around these
levels, said Hideki Shibata, a senior strategist for rates and
foreign exchange at Tokai  Tokyo  Research Center Co.  China’s Premier  Wen Jiabao  said downward pressure on the
the world’s second biggest economy is still “relatively
large,” the official Xinhua News Agency reported yesterday. He
pledged to “unswervingly” continue property controls and
prevent prices from rebounding, Xinhua said.  The country lowered  interest rates  on July 5 for the second
time in a month. Speculation that China will reduce borrowing
costs again may lend strength to commodities prices as well as
the Aussie and kiwi.  “The slowdown in inflation gives China room to cut
interest rates more,” said Tokai Tokyo’s Shibata. “ China’s
economy  is likely to support the Australian and New Zealand
currencies based on the scenario that it will rebound in the
second half of this year.”  China is  Australia ’s biggest trading partner and New
Zealand’s second-largest export destination.  To contact the reporter on this story:
