Roger Federer  took the third set
against Andy Murray in today’s men’s singles final at Wimbledon
to take a 2-1 lead in the best-of-five match.  The Swiss player, who is seeking to secure a first Grand
Slam tennis title since the 2010 Australian Open, leads 4-6,
7-5, 6-3 on Centre Court at the All England Club in London.   Murray, competing in his first Wimbledon final, will end
Britain’s 76-year wait for a male Grand Slam champion if he wins
today.  There was a 40-minute rain delay early in the third set and
the match is set to be completed under cover after organizers
decided to close the retractable roof.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
