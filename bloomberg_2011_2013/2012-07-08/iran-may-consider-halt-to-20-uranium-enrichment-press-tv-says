An Iranian parliament lawmaker said
his country is willing to consider the temporary suspension of
20-percent  uranium enrichment  as part of a negotiated accord,
state-run  Press TV  news channel reported.  In return the so-called P5+1 -- U.S., U.K., France, China,
Russia and Germany -- must agree to meet the country’s needs for
20-percent enriched uranium, said Mohammad-Hassan Asferi, a
member of the Parliament’s national security and foreign policy
committee, according to Press TV.  Iran  would be willing to suspend its 20-percent enrichment
activity for a specific period if western powers meet its
enrichment needs during this time, Asferi said, adding that
permanent suspension is “by no means acceptable.”  Iran would also expect sanctions to be lifted and the
nuclear dossier to be pulled out of the UN Security Council and
referred back to the  International Atomic Energy Agency , he
said, according to Press TV.  To contact the reporter on this story:
