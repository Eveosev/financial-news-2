Permira Advisers LLP will sell luxury
designer Valentino to a sovereign wealth fund for 600 million
euros ($737 million), the Sunday Telegraph reported, without
saying where it obtained the information.  The sale, to one of Permira’s investors, will separate the
Valentino brand from  Hugo Boss AG (BOSS) , the newspaper said. The
sovereign wealth fund hasn’t been identified it said.  --  To contact the reporter on this story:
