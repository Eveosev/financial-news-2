Uganda’s central unexpectedly raised
its key lending rate for the first time in almost two years in
an effort to prevent inflation from accelerating.  The Bank of Uganda increased its  policy rate  to 12 percent
from 11 percent, Governor Emmanuel Tumusiime-Mutebile told
reporters today in Kampala, the capital. Two economists surveyed
by Bloomberg forecast the rate would remain unchanged. It was
the first increase since November 2011.  The  inflation rate  climbed for the second consecutive month
to 7.3 percent in August, the highest in a year, from 5.1
percent in July after a prolonged drought cut crop supplies,
pushing up food prices which carry a 27 percent weight in the
consumer price basket. Core inflation, which strips out food
crops, fuel, electricity and metered water, quickened to 6.6
percent from 6.4 percent, moving further outside the bank’s 5
percent medium-term target.  Two years ago, East  Africa ’s worst drought in six decades
curbed farming output and drove the rate of inflation in Uganda
to as high as 30.5 percent in October 2011, forcing the central
bank to lift the key rate to a record 23 percent.  Economic growth in Uganda, Africa’s biggest coffee
exporter, may expand by more than 6 percent in the year through
June from 5.1 percent in 2012-13, according to a forecast by the
government.  To contact the reporter on this story:
