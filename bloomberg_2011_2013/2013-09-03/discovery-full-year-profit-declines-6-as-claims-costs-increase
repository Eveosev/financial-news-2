Discovery Holdings Ltd. (DSY) , owner of
South Africa’s largest medical-insurance administrator, said
fiscal full-year profit fell 6 percent as claims and costs rose.  Net income for the 12 months to June 30 dropped to 2.06
billion rand ($201 million), from 2.2 billion rand a year
earlier, the Johannesburg-based company said in a statement
today. Diluted earnings a share excluding one-time items was
4.96 rand, missing the median 5.02 rand estimate of six analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg.  Discovery operates in South Africa, the U.K. and  China . In
February it boosted its stake in China’s Ping An health
insurance unit to 25 percent from 20 percent and expanded its
wellness-based life-insurance model, called Vitality, into
 Singapore  through a joint venture with  AIA Group Ltd (1299)  in July.  The dividend rose 20 percent to 1.245 rand a share,
Discovery said. Claims gained 33 percent to 8.9 billion rand
while costs related to acquisitions, marketing and
administration increased 22 percent to a combined 11.7 billion
rand.  Discovery rose 2.6 percent to 86.46 rand as of 9:50 a.m. in
Johannesburg. It is the best performing stock on the five-member
FTSE/JSE Life Assurance Index this year, having risen 38 percent
compared with the average return of 13 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
