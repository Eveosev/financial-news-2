Spot gasoline in  Chicago 
strengthened after  Marathon Petroleum Corp. (MPC)  shut equipment at
its refinery in  Michigan .  Equipment was being idled at the 114,000-barrel-a-day
Detroit plant after more than 100 pounds of hydrogen sulfide
leaked from a pipeline in the area, according to a filing with
the U.S. National Response Center.  Jamal Kheiry, a spokesman for Marathon, confirmed the
information in the filing and declined to comment any further on
operations at the plant. The refinery, located in southwest
Detroit, processes mostly heavy crude after a 2012 upgrade.  Conventional, 85-octane gasoline , or CBOB, in Chicago
strengthened 1 cent to 14.5 cents a gallon above futures on the
New York Mercantile Exchange at 2:38 p.m., the largest premium
since June 11 and the sixth consecutive advance.  The  3-2-1 crack spread  in Chicago, a rough measure of
refining margins for gasoline and diesel based on West Texas
Intermediate oil in Cushing, Oklahoma, dropped $1.21 to $19.76 a
barrel, the first decline in five days, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Chicago gasoline traded 29.25 cents above the same fuel on
the Gulf Coast, the  highest premium  since July 12. Gulf Coast
CBOB weakened 2.5 cents to 14.75 cents below futures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
