Crude options volatility rose when
crude futures advanced as President  Barack Obama  won support
from House Republican leaders for a strike on  Syria .  Implied volatility for at-the-money October options, a
measure of expected futures swings and a key gauge of value, was
28.49 percent at 3:31 p.m. on the  New York Mercantile Exchange ,
up from 26.67 percent on Aug. 30.  West Texas Intermediate crude for October delivery gained
89 cents, or 0.8 percent, to settle at $108.54 a barrel on the
Nymex.  Crude rose as House Speaker  John Boehner  and House Majority
Leader  Eric Cantor  said they support Obama, a Democrat. The
administration says it has proof that Syrian President Bashar
Al-Assad authorized the Aug. 21 chemical weapons attack against
his own people and that the U.S. must act. No U.S. president has
been turned down by Congress when asking to use military force.  The most active options in electronic trading today were
October $115 calls, which rose 2 cents to 62 cents a barrel with
5,409 lots trading as of 3:50 p.m. October $120 calls were the
second-most active, unchanged at 25 cents a barrel on volume of
3,456 contracts.  Calls accounted for 64 percent of electronic trading volume
today and made up the five most-active contracts.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on open-outcry volume, where the bulk of options activity occurs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
