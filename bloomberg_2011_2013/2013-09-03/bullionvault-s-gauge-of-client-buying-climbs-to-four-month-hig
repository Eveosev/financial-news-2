BullionVault , an online service for
investors to buy and sell physical gold and silver, said its
Gold Investor Index climbed to a four-month high in August.  The gauge rose to 53.8 from a 10-month low of 52.6 in July,
the London-based company said today in an e-mailed report. A
reading above 50 means more buyers than sellers. Customers’ gold
holdings rose by 13,500 ounces in August, the most since
December.  Gold rallied as much as 21 percent from a 34-month low in
June as lower prices boosted demand for jewelry, bars and coins,
particularly in  Asia . Prices are still heading for the first
annual drop in 13 years after some investors lost faith in the
metal as a store of value. Gold reached a three-month high of
$1,433.83 an ounce on Aug. 28 amid concern the U.S. will take
military action against  Syria .  “Summer 2013 ended with a stark reminder of the risks
which people buy gold to defend against,” Adrian Ash, head of
research at BullionVault, said in the report.  Gold for immediate delivery traded at $1,390.71 an ounce by
8:11 a.m. in London, for a 17 percent decline this year. Prices
gained 5.3 percent in August, rising for a second straight
month.  BullionVault said it had the best week at the end of August
for new users funding accounts since April and inflows of money
ready to buy metal last week were the strongest since June.
Customers own about $1.5 billion of gold, the company said.  To contact the reporter for this story:
