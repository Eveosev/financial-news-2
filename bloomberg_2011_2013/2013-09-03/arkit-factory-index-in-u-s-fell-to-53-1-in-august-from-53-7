The Markit Economics final U.S.
manufacturing  index  decreased to 53.1 in August from 53.7 a
month earlier, the London-based group said today.  A reading above 50 for the purchasing managers’ measure
indicates expansion. The median forecast in a Bloomberg survey
of 8 economists was 54, with estimates ranging from 53.9 to
54.5. The preliminary reading was 53.9.  Markit’s purchasers figure is based on replies from about
85 percent to 90 percent of companies in a poll of more than 600
American manufacturers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
