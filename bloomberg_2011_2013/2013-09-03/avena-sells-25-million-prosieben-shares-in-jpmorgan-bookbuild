KKR & Co. and Permira Advisers LLP
are selling 25 million shares in  ProSiebenSat.1 Media AG (PSM) , a
stake valued at more than 760 million euros ($1 billion). The
stock fell as much as 8.1 percent in  Frankfurt  today.  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  is placing the shares in the German
broadcaster, the bank said in an e-mailed statement yesterday.
The accelerated bookbuild sale was priced at 30.67 euros, the
lower end of a price range of 30.67 euros to 31.15 euros that
the shares were offered at, said a person familiar with the
matter who asked not to be named before an announcement.  KKR and Permira will have about 33 percent of ProSieben’s
share capital after the sale, which is being made through
holding company Lavena. The private equity investors bought a
controlling stake in 2007 for 3.1 billion euros from U.S.
billionaire Haim Saban’s German Media Partners LP.  European broadcasters including ProSieben have looked for
revenue elsewhere as the region’s TV-advertising market slowed.
Based outside Munich, ProSieben is making more shows available
on demand via the Internet and producing its own content via its
Red Arrow unit. The stock fell 5.1 percent to 30.65 euros at
12:22 p.m., paring its advance to 44 percent this year and
giving the company a market value of 6.7 billion euros.  ProSieben, which mainly competes with publisher Bertelsmann
SE’s broadcasting unit RTL Group SA in  Germany , reported second-quarter sales that exceeded analysts’ estimates as the German
television-advertising market improved. Sales for continuing
operations rose 11 percent to 624.8 million euros in the three
months through June, ProSieben said last month.  Secondary share sales including accelerated book build
deals have raised about $61 billion in Europe, the  Middle East 
and  Africa  this year, compared with $30 billion in the same
period in 2012, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  -- With assistance from Sarah Jones in London. Editors:  Kim
