Talks have been discontinued for
Hong Kong electricity producer  CLP Holdings Ltd. (2)  to buy a 4.8
billion  yuan  ($784 million) stake in a Chinese power plant
following regulatory delays after Japan’s nuclear crisis.  Shareholder  China  General Nuclear Power Corp. told CLP this
week that the deal wouldn’t go ahead “for the time being,” CLP
said in a Hong Kong stock exchange filing yesterday. CLP agreed
in 2011 to buy the 17 percent stake in the Yangjiang Nuclear
Power Station in southern China’s Guangdong province.  “Discussions on Yangjiang have been discontinued,” CLP
said in yesterday’s statement. “There is no assurance that
discussions will recommence or, if they do, that CLP will then
be able to reach agreement.”  The announcement upsets CLP’s plans to increase spending on
nuclear power even after the Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear crisis
prompted China to halt approval of new projects. Construction of
the 6,000-megawatt Yangjiang plant, which was due to start
operating in phases from 2013 to 2017, was delayed as the nation
reviewed nuclear safety.  China General Nuclear Power said CLP wouldn’t be able to
take up the stake following the delays as well as a review of
“funding needs and capital raising options,” according to the
CLP statement.  To contact the reporters on this story:
