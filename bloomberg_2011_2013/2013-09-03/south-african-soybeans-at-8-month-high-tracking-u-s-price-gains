South African soybeans for December
delivery jumped to the highest level in more than eight months,
tracking prices that gained in the U.S. on concerns a lack of
rain will hurt yields.  The contract, the most active, climbed as much as 2.1
percent to 5,995 rand ($581) a metric ton, the highest since it
started trading on Dec. 19, before settling at 5,975 rand by the
midday close on the South African Futures Exchange in
Johannesburg.  Dry and warm conditions continue in the U.S. Midwest,
particularly  Iowa , western Illinois and  Missouri , adding stress
for filling soybeans, forecaster DTN said Aug. 30. Soybeans
surged as much as 3.8 percent today on the Chicago Board of
Trade.  “Soy remains very strong,” Andrew Fletcher, an
independent trader in Kroonstad in the Free State province, said
by phone. “The rainy weather they had expected was not
enough.”  White corn for delivery in December retreated 0.2 percent
to 2,373 rand a ton, while the yellow variety for delivery in
the same month was 0.1 percent lower at 2,227 rand a ton in
Johannesburg.  South Africa  is the continent’s largest producer of corn.
Meal made from white corn is used as one of the nation’s staple
foods, while the yellow variety is mainly used as  animal feed .  To contact the reporter on this story:
