Two cases of the 2008 vintage from
Chateau Montrose, a Bordeaux wine estate in Saint-Estephe, sold
for 550 pounds ($850) each on the London-based Liv-ex market in
the past week, taking the vintage to a six-month low.  The sale on Aug. 29 was 12 percent below this year’s peak,
reached in March, and down 43 percent from the record 964 pounds
a case touched in July 2011, when Chinese buyers were fueling a
 bull market  in Bordeaux classed growths.  The Liv-ex Fine Wine 50 Index tracking top Bordeaux
vintages has risen 4 percent this year, gaining in the first two
months and then falling during the second quarter as recent
vintages including the 2008s competed with a sales campaign for
new wines. It has slipped further since the end of June as
investors turn their attention increasingly to other regions.  After four years of strong Asian demand for Bordeaux,
“we’re moving on to the next great wine region, Burgundy, and
other countries and other regions and different vintages,”
Simon Tam, Christie’s International Plc head of wine for  China ,
told  Rishaad Salamat  on Bloomberg Television’s ‘On the Move
 Asia ’ last week. Tam was commenting on the wine market in the
context of a Christie’s auction held in  Hong Kong  on Aug. 31.  Chateau Montrose has been owned since 2006 by Martin and
Olivier Bouygues, who run Paris-based construction and media
company  Bouygues SA. (EN)  The estate is ranked as a second-growth
vineyard in the 1855 Bordeaux classification, putting it among
the top 20 in the Medoc region.  Montrose 2008 traded at 470 pounds in May 2009, soon after
it went on sale, and is still trading 17 percent above that
level.  The 2008 Montrose is priced similarly to the estate’s most
recent 2011 and 2012 vintages, while costing less than half the
2010 wine and barely a quarter of the 2009, according to
merchant data collated by Liv-ex. It scored 95 points out of 100
from U.S. wine critic  Robert Parker , putting it among the
vineyard’s top five wines of the past 10 years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
