Sweden  will be unlikely to retain
the full-haven advantage it built up in the bond markets over
the past few years as risk appetite revives, the head of the
country’s debt office said.  It’s “naive” to think Sweden will retain this “safe-haven stage” when risk appetite returns, Hans Lindblad, the
agency’s director-general, said at a conference in Stockholm
today. Sweden is likely to retain some of the advantage in the
debt markets even as global optimism returns, he said.  Since the U.S. Federal Reserve signaled the world’s largest
economy may start scaling back monetary stimulus, yields on
bonds across most markets have surged. Debt sold out of AAA-rated Sweden lost 4 percent this year as investors focused on
recovery signs in Europe.  The office is for now not looking at issuing bonds with
maturities of 12 years or longer, Lindblad said. Long-term notes
will be sold “in due time,” he said. The Swedish debt office
watches what the Fed does “very closely,” he said.  The yield on Sweden’s benchmark 10-year bond rose four
basis points to 2.55 percent, its highest in at least a year, as
of 10:47 a.m. in  Stockholm . That followed a six basis-point jump
in the yield yesterday. The difference in yield relative to
similar-maturity German bunds widened to 64 basis points today,
the most since 2003, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
