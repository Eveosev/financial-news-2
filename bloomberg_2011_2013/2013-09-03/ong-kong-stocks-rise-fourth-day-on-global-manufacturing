Hong Kong   stocks  rose, with the
benchmark index heading for the longest winning streak in three
weeks on signs of global recovery in manufacturing after output
from China to Europe expanded.  The  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  gained 0.6 percent to 22,300.19 as of
9:32 a.m. in Hong Kong, heading for a four-day advance. The  Hang
Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  added 1.2 percent to 10,174.07.  Shares yesterday climbed the most in three weeks, after
China’s official  Purchasing Managers ’ Index of manufacturing
activity climbed to a 16-month high. A gauge of non-manufacturing industries fell to 53.9 in August from 54.1 in
July, according to a statement today by the National Bureau of
Statistics and the Federation of Logistics and Purchasing. A
reading above 50 indicates expansion.  The  Hang Seng Index  fell 2.1 percent this year through
yesterday, the second-worst performer among developed markets
tracked by Bloomberg. The gauge traded at 10.6 times estimated
earnings yesterday, compared with 14.83 on the Standard & Poor’s
500 Index.  The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index, also known as the H-share index, dropped 18 percent from a Feb. 1 high through
yesterday after mainland growth slowed for two quarters. The
measure traded at 1.21 times book value, compared with a five-year average of 1.77. China revised its 2012 growth domestic
product growth to 7.7 percent from 7.8 percent yesterday, with
either figure the lowest expansion since 1999.  Materials and energy companies led declines this year on
the Hang Seng Composite Index amid concern weaker expansion in
China will sap demand. Utility and information-technology shares
were the biggest gainers.  Futures on the  S&P 500  rose 0.9 percent. Markets were
closed yesterday for the Labor Day holiday. A U.S. index of
factory activity is expected to slip to 54 for August, according
economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The gauge had readings of 55.4
for July and 50.9 in June.  To contact the reporter on this story:
