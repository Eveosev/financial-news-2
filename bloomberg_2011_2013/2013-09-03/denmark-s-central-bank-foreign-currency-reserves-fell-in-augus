Denmark’s  foreign currency reserves 
fell in August as pressure eased on the krone after the euro
area emerged from a recession.  Reserves fell 100 million kroner ($18 million) to 491.8
billion kroner, the Copenhagen-based Nationalbanken said today
in a statement. The bank said it didn’t intervene in the market
to defend the peg to the euro.  The bank “is satisfied with the current level of the
Danish krone versus the euro,” Tina Mortensen, an economist at
Citigroup Inc., said before the release. “The next independent
interest rate move is unlikely to happen in the very short term
with the currency currently trading close to the central
parity.”  Denmark’s AAA rated  bond market  emerged as a haven from the
euro area’s fiscal crisis last year as the nation keeps public
debt at less than half the average in the single currency bloc,
relative to gross domestic product. Foreign currency  reserves 
reached a peak of 514.4 billion kroner in August last year.  The central bank on May 2 lowered its  benchmark lending
rate  to 0.2 percent from 0.3 percent, following a 0.25
percentage-point reduction by the  European Central Bank . The
Danish bank’s  deposit rate  is at minus 0.1 percent.  The krone traded at 7.4588 per euro as of 4:11 p.m. in
Copenhagen. The currency was as strong as 7.4306 per euro in May
last year and as weak as 7.4633 in January this year. The
central bank’s targeted rate is 7.46038.  To contact the reporter on this story:
