Peanut prices have yet to respond to
a “decimated” U.S. crop and may be undervalued compared with
other oilseeds, according to Oil World.  The U.S. harvest of shelled peanuts may be 1.3 million
metric tons this year, down from 2.29 million tons a year
earlier, the Hamburg-based researcher said in an e-mailed
report, citing the  U.S. Department of Agriculture .  The U.S. Runner 40/50 variety averaged $1,400 a ton in
April through June this year, compared with $2,800 a ton in the
January-through-March period of last year, on “large” U.S.
inventories, according to Oil World. Peanuts, also known as
groundnuts, are currently less than 2 1/2 times more expensive
than soybeans, compared with the ratio of three times
experienced over “many years.”  “Groundnuts may have become undervalued relative to other
oilseeds, mainly soybeans,” Oil World said. “If this
development persists, it is questionable whether the assumed
further expansion of Argentine groundnut plantings and
production will materialize.”  Argentina ’s crop this year turned out below expectations
after damaging dryness in January and February, Oil World said.  Linseed production may rebound in the 2013-14 season, Oil
World said. Global output was forecast to advance 10 percent to
2.21 million tons from a year earlier. The  Commonwealth of
Independent States , the bloc of former Soviet republics, will
boost its crop by 19 percent to 700,000 tons. Canada is forecast
to harvest 580,000 tons, from 490,000 tons a year earlier.  The crop is recovering on bigger yields, which will gain 15
percent to 0.85 tons a hectare (2.47 acres), while total acreage
is forecast to decline to 2.56 million hectares from 2.71
million hectares a year earlier, Oil World said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
