Hong Kong’s push to enact democratic
reforms must follow the law and be peaceful, Chinese Politburo
Standing Committee member  Zhang Dejiang  told Hong Kong officials
in Beijing today.  China  stands by the “One Country, Two Systems” principle
and will promote Hong Kong’s push toward universal suffrage,
Zhang told visiting Hong Kong security officials, the official
Xinhua News Agency said. Economic, social and political
developments must be done according to the law, Zhang said.  Hong Kong is scheduled to elect its chief executive in
2017, according to a pledged made by China in 2007. Pro-democracy activists have threatened to paralyze the city’s
financial district next year if the democratic reforms fall
short of international standards.  China’s central government is “satisfied” with Chief
Executive Leung Chun-ying and his administration, Zhang said.
The city’s government had worked hard on economic development
and improving livelihood, he said.  Hong Kong ’s law enforcement agencies should support the
government in maintaining the city’s rule of law and prosperity,
Zhang said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
