The cost of insuring against losses
on  Nokia Oyj (NOK1V)  debt fell by a record after  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)  agreed
to buy its handset business and license its patents for 5.44
billion euros ($7.2 billion).  Credit-default swaps on Nokia dropped 330 basis points to
199, according to data provider CMA at 10 a.m. in  London . The
Espoo, Finland-based company’s 6.75 percent bonds due February
2019 jumped 7.5 cents on the euro to 113.3 cents, the highest
since June 2011, Bloomberg data show.  Nokia is exiting the mobile-phone business it once
dominated after struggling to compete with Apple Inc.’s iPhone
and Google Inc.’s Android platform. The deal -- the largest for
a wireless device maker after Google’s purchase of Motorola’s
handset unit completed in May 2012 -- will let the company focus
on its network equipment business, which is facing intensifying
competition from Sweden’s Ericsson AB and China’s Huawei
Technologies Co. and  ZTE Corp. (000063)   “Whilst the loss of the handset business marks the end of
an era for the company, it could no longer continue to develop
new phones as its market share plunged,” said Aengus McMahon, a
London-based analyst at ING Groep NV. “This move is positive
for Nokia spreads and we would expect to see some positive
momentum in its ratings as the transaction moves towards
completion.”  Nokia Ratings  Nokia is rated B1 by Moody’s Investors Service, four levels
below investment grade, and the New York-based ratings firm has
a negative outlook on the company’s debt. Nokia’s plan to regain
a high-grade ranking will be plausible after the Microsoft deal
is completed, according to report from Mizuho International Plc
today.  The 62 percent decline in the cost of Nokia’s swaps is the
most since CMA began collecting data in 2007 and the contracts
are the lowest since June 2011. They’re down from a peak of more
than 1,200 basis points in July 2012.  Swaps on Microsoft were unchanged at 33 basis points, CMA
data show. The world’s largest software maker is moving into
hardware as it also tries to remain competitive. Its 550 million
euros of 2.625 percent bonds due May 2033 fell 0.26 cents on the
euro to 91.08 cents, the lowest since they were issued in April.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros of debt from default for five years is equivalent
to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer face value in
exchange for the underlying securities or the cash equivalent
should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt agreements and an
increase signals deterioration in perceptions of  credit quality .  To contact the reporter on this story:
