Ibovespa  futures  dropped, after the
equity gauge rallied the most in 13 months yesterday, as a
report showed that  Brazil ’s industrial production dropped more
than analysts forecast in July.  Oil company  HRT Participacoes em Petroleo SA  may be active
after saying it is looking for partners to develop gas projects
in Brazil’s Solimoes Basin.  Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes SA (GOLL3) 
may move after Banco Santander SA lowered its recommendation on
the airline to the equivalent of sell.  Ibovespa futures contracts expiring in October fell 0.7
percent to 50,500 at 9:16 a.m. in Sao Paulo. The real weakened
0.9 percent to 2.3983 per dollar. Brazil’s industrial production
declined 2 percent in July from a month earlier, the national
statistics agency reported today, after gaining 2.1 percent in
June. The median forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg
was for a 1.3 percent drop.  “Economic prospects remain bleak,” Banco BTG Pactual SA’s
analysts including Carlos Sequeira wrote in a report. “Chances
are high that GDP growth in 2014 may end up coming below 2013.”  State-controlled oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA may
move after saying crude and gas output in Brazil fell 4.9
percent in July from a month earlier.  The Ibovespa has gained 15 percent from this year’s  low  on
July 3 as higher commodities prices and a weaker real fueled a
rally in raw-material exporters. Brazil’s benchmark gauge
climbed 10 percent in dollar terms during the period, compared
with an advance of 2.8 percent for the MSCI  Emerging Markets 
Index of 21 developing nations’ equities.  Trading volume of stocks in  Sao Paulo  was 5.84 billion
reais yesterday, compared with a daily average of 7.74 billion
reais this year through Aug. 30, according to data  compiled  by
the exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
