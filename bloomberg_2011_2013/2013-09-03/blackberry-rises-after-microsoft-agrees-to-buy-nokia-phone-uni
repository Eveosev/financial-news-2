BlackBerry Ltd. (BBRY) , the struggling
Canadian smartphone maker weighing a sale, jumped in early U.S.
trading after  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)  agreed to acquire Nokia Oyj’s
handset business in a $7.2 billion deal.  The  shares  advanced 3.3 percent to $10.45 at 7:52 a.m.  New
York  time. They have fallen 6.1 percent since Aug. 12, when
BlackBerry announced it was weighing a sale, and are down 15
percent this year.  A BlackBerry board committee began exploring a sale of the
Waterloo, Ontario-based company last month while also studying
partnerships to rescue it from a three-year sales slide that has
slashed its market value by about 90 percent.  Microsoft agreed to buy BlackBerry rival Nokia’s handset
business and license its patents, casting together the lot of
two technology companies trying to stay relevant against more
fleet-footed rivals. Both Nokia and BlackBerry have lost market
share to Apple Inc. and devices running Google Inc.’s Android
software.  To contact the reporter on this story:
