Poland  plans to introduce preferred
shares for Energa SA, the nation’s fourth-largest utility, to
retain control after giving its majority stake in an initial
public offering planned for later this year.  The Gdansk, Poland-based company’s general meeting that
began at 10 a.m. today will decide on statute changes that would
grant double-voting rights to 33.4 percent of the utility’s
shares, according to its website. The package will allow its
owner to keep 50.2 percent of votes. The State Treasury holds
84.2 percent of its shares.  The change will help the Treasury “be more flexible in
deciding on the size of transaction,” Deputy Treasury Minister
Pawel Tamborski said yesterday in interview in Tarnow, Poland.  The sale of Energa shares is part of this year’s state-asset sale plan to raise 5 billion zloty ($1.54 billion) to help
finance the  budget deficit . The Treasury raised 1.88 billion
zloty through July, according to the ministry’s website.  Energa, which posted net income of 532.6 million zloty in
the first half, had 3.3 billion zloty of cash assets at the end
of June, according to its financial report.  The company “won’t pay back any additional dividend before
the IPO,” Tamborski said.  The Treasury won’t merge hydroelectric generator Niedzica
with Energa or increase the utility’s share capital before the
IPO in order to avoid delaying the transaction, Tamborski said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
