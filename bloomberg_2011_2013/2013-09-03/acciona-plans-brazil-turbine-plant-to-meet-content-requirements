Acciona SA (ANA) , the Spanish renewable-energy company, plans to build a wind-turbine assembly plant in
Brazil, its second in the northeastern state of Bahia, to comply
with local-content requirements.  The site will assemble nacelles, the car-sized units that
house the gears, electronics and gearboxes for its 3-megawatt
turbines, Alcobendas, Spain-based Acciona said today on its
 website . It will begin production in the fourth quarter of 2014.  Banco Nacional de Desenvolvimento Economico e Social,
Brazilâ€™s state-run development lender, offers low-cost financing
to developers that buy turbines made with domestically produced
components.  To contact the reporter on this story:
