Germany ’s 10-year government bonds
fell for a third day on speculation the Federal Reserve will
reduce stimulus when policy makers meet on Sept. 17-18, denting
the appeal of the safest fixed-income securities.  Benchmark 10-year  yields  approached the highest level since
March 2012 after the Institute for Supply Management’s gauge of
U.S. manufacturing unexpectedly rose in August. Bunds slid as
Treasuries tumbled on bets the world’s biggest economy is
improving enough to absorb a reduction in the Fed’s debt-purchase program. Spanish bonds declined before the nation sells
securities this week. Italian securities erased an earlier gain.  “Yields are edging higher,” said Rainer Guntermann, a
rates strategist at Commerzbank AG in  Frankfurt . “It’s due to
the ISM in the U.S., which brings back the tapering view,
possibly as soon as the upcoming Fed meeting. It’s not a
surprise to see Spain as an underperformer before this week’s
auction.”  German 10-year yields climbed four basis points, or 0.04
percentage point, to 1.94 percent at 4:59 p.m. London time. The
rate rose to 1.98 percent on Aug. 23, the highest level since
March 22, 2012. The 1.5 percent bond maturing in May 2023 fell
0.31, or 3.10 euros per 1,000-euro ($1,315) face amount, to
96.14.  The ISM index increased to 55.7 in August from 55.4 a month
earlier, the Tempe, Arizona-based group said. The median
forecast of 85 economists surveyed by Bloomberg called for the
measure to rise to 52. A reading of 50 is the dividing line
between expansion and contraction.  Spanish Bonds  Spain’s 10-year yield rose five basis points to 4.47
percent. The nation is scheduled to auction as much as 4 billion
euros of bonds due in 2018 and 2023 on Sept. 5.  Austria’s 10-year bond yields climbed two basis points to
2.35 percent after the nation sold 800 million euros of the
securities due in October 2023 at an average yield of 2.317
percent, compared with a rate of 2.07 percent at a previous
auction on Aug. 6. The Austrian Treasury also allotted 700
million euros of 30-year bonds at 3.009 percent.  Irish bonds advanced for a second day after Germany’s
Handeslblatt reported the euro area may grant Ireland standby
credit as a backup for its return to financial markets from
January. The 10-year yield fell eight basis points to 4.08
percent.  Italian Government  Italian 10-year yields were little changed at 4.35 percent
after falling as much as five basis points to 4.30 percent. The
nation’s securities should be boosted by overseas demand and the
likelihood that Prime Minister Enrico Letta’s coalition
government will survive into next year, according to Francesco Garzarelli, co-head of macro and markets research at Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. in  London .  “Eighty percent of the bond market is now with the
Italians, so there’s room for foreigners to come in,”
Garzarelli said in a Bloomberg Television interview. “The
government will survive well into next year and will deliver
some reforms and ease a little bit the fiscal stance, supporting
the economy.”  Volatility on Irish bonds was the highest in euro-area
markets today followed by those of Finland and Germany,
according to measures of 10-year debt, the yield spread between
two- and 10-year securities, and credit-default swaps.  German bonds lost 2.4 percent this year through yesterday,
according to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes. Spanish debt earned
8.1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
