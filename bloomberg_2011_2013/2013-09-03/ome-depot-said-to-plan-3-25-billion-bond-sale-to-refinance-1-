Home Depot Inc. (HD) , the property-improvement retailer, sold $3.25 billion of notes to refinance
debt and buy back  stock  with its biggest bond offering in almost
seven years.  The company issued $1.15 billion of 2.25 percent securities
due in 2018 that pay 60 basis points more than similar-maturity
Treasuries, $1.1 billion of 3.75 percent bonds maturing in 2024
with a spread of 95 basis points, and $1 billion of 4.875
percent debt due in 2044 that pays 115 more than benchmarks,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Proceeds may be used to repay its $1.25 billion of 5.25
percent securities maturing Dec. 16 and repurchase stock that’s
 surged about 20 percent  this year, Atlanta-based Home Depot said
today in a regulatory filing. The issue is the company’s largest
since a $5 billion bond sale in December 2006.  Its $1 billion of 4.2 percent bonds due 2043, which were
issued in April to yield 110 basis points more than Treasuries,
have declined to 92.8 cents on the dollar to yield 4.65 percent
last week, according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system
of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.  The new securities are ranked A- at  Standard & Poor’s .  To contact the reporter on this story:
