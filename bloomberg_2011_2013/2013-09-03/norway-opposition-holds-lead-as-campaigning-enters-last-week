Norway ’s Conservative-led opposition
bloc held a lead of more than 15 percentage points, opinion
polls showed, as candidates head into their last week of
campaigning in western Europe’s largest oil producer.  The Conservative Party-led four-party coalition would get
55.4 percent of votes, according to an average of two polls
released yesterday. Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg’s Labor-led
three-party government was supported by 39 percent, on average.  The polls showed that Labor would remain the biggest party
in parliament with 29.8 percent. The Conservatives were backed
by 27.5 percent, while its coalition partner, the Progress
Party, was supported by 15.7 percent, on average.  Conservative Party leader Erna Solberg has pledged to cut
taxes and boost spending on roads, railways, education and
research and development. Stoltenberg has argued Norway,
Europe’s second-richest nation, needs to extend its welfare
model. The country is home to a $750 billion sovereign wealth
fund, the world’s largest.  The poll average included a TNS Gallup poll for TV2 based
on 1,493 phone interviews from Aug. 30 to Sept. 2 with a margin
of error of 1.1 percentage points to 2.3 percentage points, and
InFact for VG based on 2,039 calls from Aug. 31 to Sept. 1 with
a margin of error of 1.9 percentage points. Both polls were
published yesterday.  Norway’s general election is on Sept. 9.  To contact the reporter on this story:
