The pound rose for a fifth day
versus the euro as a report showed a gauge of U.K. construction
based on a survey of  purchasing managers  increased for a fourth
month in August, reaching the highest in almost six years.  Sterling touched a three-month high versus the common
currency before Bank of England policy makers meet this week.
U.K.  construction  activity climbed to 59.1 last month from 57 in
July, Markit Economics and the  Chartered Institute of Purchasing
and Supply  said. The pound also rose as Verizon Communications
Inc. agreed to buy  Vodafone Group Plc (VOD) ’s 45 percent stake in
 Verizon Wireless  for $130 billion. U.K. 10-year gilt yields rose
to the highest level in two years.  “The pound is boosted by the assumption that the data is
looking much better in the course of recent weeks,” said  Jeremy Stretch , head of currency strategy at Canadian Imperial Bank of
Commerce in  London . “Markets have perhaps realized that they’ve
been maintaining sterling net-short positions for too long.
Vodafone news also helps.” A short position is a bet that an
asset price will fall.  The pound appreciated 0.2 percent to 84.72 pence per euro
at 4:10 p.m. London time after reaching 84.46 pence, the
strongest level since May 21. Sterling was little changed at
$1.5533.  The latest reading in U.K. construction output showed the
fastest expansion since September 2007, Markit said in a
statement.  Manufacturing output  rose to a 2 1/2-year high of
57.2 last month, a report showed yesterday. A reading above 50
indicates expansion.  Vodafone Transaction  Verizon, which had a market value of $136 billion last
week, will pay Newbury, England-based Vodafone $58.9 billion in
cash and issue $60.2 billion in stock.  The news will provide support for the pound even though
detail is not immediately available on how much of the
transaction will go through the foreign-exchange market, said
 Ian Stannard , head of European currency strategy at Morgan
Stanley in London.  “The Vodafone deal is seen as a proxy of foreign direct
investment flows into the U.K. and therefore will have a
positive effect on the pound,” said Stannard. “Our study on
M&A flows showed that it doesn’t matter so much with regard to
the structure of the deal, and an announcement of a deal like
this is likely to have an impact on currencies.”  The pound strengthened 6.5 percent in the past six months,
the best performer among 10 developed-nation currencies tracked
by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The euro gained 3.9
percent and the dollar climbed 2.7 percent.  Policy Meeting  The  Bank of England ’s nine-member Monetary Policy Committee
will keep its asset-purchase  target  at 375 billion pounds on
Sept. 5, according to all 38 economists in a Bloomberg survey.
Officials will also hold the main  interest rate  at a record-low
0.5 percent as they assess the impact of forward guidance, a
separate survey showed.  Carney said on Aug. 28 that the central bank doesn’t rule
out providing more stimulus to the economy.  The 10-year gilt yields increased five basis points, or
0.05 percentage point, to 2.89 percent, after reaching 2.90
percent, the  highest  since Aug. 1, 2011. The 2.25 percent bond
maturing in September 2023 dropped 0.385, or 3.85 pounds per
1,000-pound face amount, to 94.46.  The Debt Management Office auctioned 1.5 billion pounds of
inflation-linked bonds due in 2024 at a real yield of minus
0.159 percent, compared with minus 0.758 percent at a previous
sale on June 4.  Gilts lost 4.1 percent this year through yesterday,
according to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes. German bonds dropped
2.4 percent and Treasuries declined 3.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
