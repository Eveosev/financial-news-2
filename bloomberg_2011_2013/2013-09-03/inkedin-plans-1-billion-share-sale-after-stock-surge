LinkedIn Corp. (LNKD) , the world’s biggest
professional-networking website, filed to raise about $1 billion
in a stock sale after a fivefold surge in its shares since its
initial public offering in 2011.  The company plans to sell 4.17 million shares of its Class
A stock, according to a filing yesterday with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission. While the price hasn’t been
determined, LinkedIn estimated it will raise $1 billion based on
a closing stock price of $240.04 on Aug. 30.  LinkedIn shares, which debuted at $45 in May 2011, have
 soared  in the more than two years since as the company doubled
its user base, added features to keep members on the site for
longer and increased subscription prices for recruiters. The
offering is more than twice the size of LinkedIn’s IPO, even as
the company is selling fewer than half the number of shares.  LinkedIn  fell  as much as 4.3 percent to $235.50 in extended
trading following the announcement, after closing at $246.13 at
4 p.m. in  New York . Selling new shares dilutes the stakes of
existing equity holders.  The  Mountain View , California-based company last raised
money in November 2011 in a $701.5 million offering. As in that
sale, LinkedIn said the cash will be used for working capital,
product development and possibly to make strategic acquisitions
or investments.  At the end of the second quarter, LinkedIn had  $873 million 
in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments with no
debt.  Julie Inouye, a spokeswoman for LinkedIn, didn’t respond to
a request for comment.  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) , Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs Group
Inc., Bank of America Corp. and Allen & Co. are managing the
offering.  To contact the reporter on this story:
