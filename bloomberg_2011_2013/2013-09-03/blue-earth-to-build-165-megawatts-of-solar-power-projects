Blue Earth Inc. (BBLU) , a renewable-energy
company, will build 165 megawatts of solar projects for the U.S.
unit of Chinese panel manufacturer Zhongli Talesun Solar Co. and
for developer New Generation Power LLC.  Blue Earth’s Xnergy unit will act as an engineering,
procurement and construction contractor for at least 147
megawatts of New Generation projects and for 18 megawatts of
Talesun projects, the Henderson, Nevada-based company said today
in a statement.  The company will build the projects during the next 24
months at a cost of about $2 a watt, John Francis, a vice
president, said today in an interview. In addition to Talesun’s
six projects in  California , New Generation’s projects will be
built in the U.S. and territories as well on island nations
where power is expensive, Francis said.  Blue Earth will loan $6.5 million to the projects, with $1
million in cash and $5.5 million by issuing new shares for $3.00
a piece.  To contact the reporter on this story:
