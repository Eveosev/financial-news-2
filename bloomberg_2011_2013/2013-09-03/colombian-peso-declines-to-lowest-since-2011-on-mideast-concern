Colombia ’s peso fell to its lowest
level since December 2011 as the central bank purchased dollars
to weaken the currency and Mideast turmoil reduced demand for
emerging-market assets.  The peso depreciated 0.7 percent to 1,949.84 per  U.S.
dollar  at 10:55 a.m. in Bogota after central bank governor Jose Dario Uribe said in an interview with Caracol Radio today that
the currency will weaken further. The drop was the biggest among
major Latin American currencies.  “The main driver today is the conflict in  Syria ,” Jorge Cardozo, an analyst at Corredores Asociados SA in Bogota, said
in a phone interview. “You still have the dollar purchases.”  Banco de la Republica bought $20 million in the  currency
market  yesterday after purchasing an average $38 million last
week. Colombia continues to intervene to weaken the peso under a
plan to buy at least $2.5 billion from June to September while
Brazil and Peru are acting to prop up their currencies. The peso
dropped today along with most emerging-market currencies as an
Israeli missile test prompted concern that the conflict in Syria
is escalating and the U.S. will intervene.  Colombia’s Finance Minister  Mauricio Cardenas , who has
repeatedly said the peso’s “equilibrium” level is 1,900 to
1,950, said on Todelar Radio yesterday that there is an
“optimum point after which a weaker  exchange rate  starts to
become a problem.” The central bank probably won’t extend is
program of purchases beyond this month, according to Cardozo.  The central bank signaled on Aug. 30 that it isn’t ruling
out the possibility of a reduction in borrowing costs as it held
the target lending rate at 3.25 percent.  Yields on the nation’s peso bonds due in May 2014 decreased
eight basis points, or 0.08 percentage point, to 3.86 percent,
the lowest on a closing basis since May 31, according to the
stock exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
