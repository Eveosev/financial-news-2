The  United Nations   Security Council 
should “move beyond the current stalemate and show
leadership,” uniting behind “an appropriate response” if
allegations of chemical weapons use in Syria prove to be true,
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said today.  “This is a larger issue than the conflict in Syria,” Ban
told reporters in New York before leaving for the Group of 20
meeting in  St. Petersburg ,  Russia . “This is about our
collective responsibility to humankind. Whatever the source,
this latest escalation should be a wake-up call for the
international community.”  Russia, an ally of Syria that has a veto on the Security
Council, has so far blocked action against Syrian President
Bashar al-Assad’s regime, which is in the third year of a civil
war.  Ban said he has “taken note” of U.S. President  Barack
Obama ’s request for congressional authorization to launch a
punitive military strike against Assad’s regime to deter future
use of chemical weapons.  “At the same time, we must consider the impact of any
punitive measure on efforts to prevent further bloodshed and
facilitate the political resolution of the conflict,” Ban said,
calling on all sides to renew efforts to organize peace talks in
Geneva.  The UN is doing its “utmost” to expedite the analysis of
samples retrieved by inspectors last week during their probe of
an alleged Aug. 21 chemical weapons attack in Ghouta, near
Damascus, Ban said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
