Pennon Group Plc (PNN)  is a potential
takeover candidate and the most attractive of the U.K.’s three
publicly traded water companies due to growth prospects at its
Viridor waste-management unit, according to Citigroup Inc.  Severn Trent Plc (SVT)  is now the least likely among peers Pennon
and  United Utilities Group Plc (UU/)  to receive an offer after
thwarting a takeover approach in May from the Kuwait Investment
Office, Borealis Infrastructure Management Inc. and Britain’s
Universities Superannuation Scheme, saying it undervalued the
company.  “A recovery in the waste market, build-out of the Viridor
management team and growth offered” by the energy-from-waste
pipeline could see greater interest in Pennon, Citi analysts
Robert Coates and Andrew Simms wrote in a note to clients today.  Energy-from-waste plants planned by Viridor in Glasgow,
London, Peterborough and  Wales  will make a “significant
contribution” to profit growth, Pennon said in its full-year
results released May 23. The U.K. has promoted such projects to
meet power demand while reducing imports of fossil fuels.  The potential for mergers and acquisitions within the U.K.
water sector will drive shares in the near-term, Citi analysts
wrote, adding that given the trend in M&A, the U.K.’s publicly
traded water industry may not exist in three to five years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
