HRT Participacoes em Petroleo SA 
rallied after announcing it is looking for partners to extract
gas it discovered in the Amazon regionâ€™s Solimoes Basin.  The  shares  gained 3.2 percent to 1.60 reais at 11:48 a.m.
in Sao Paulo. It was the fourth-best performer on the
BM&FBovespa Small Cap Index, which declined 0.1 percent.  HRT said yesterday in a regulatory filing after markets
closed that it will form partnerships to develop projects to
liquefy gas found in the Solimoes Basis or build thermal plants
in the region to produce energy. Those alternatives were listed
in a study completed with  Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR3) , the state-controlled producer, and Rosneft Oil Co.  Rio de Janeiro-based HRT has slumped 66 percent in 2013
after abandoning two wells in  Namibia  and one in the Solimoes
Basin. The small-caps index lost 15 percent during the period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
