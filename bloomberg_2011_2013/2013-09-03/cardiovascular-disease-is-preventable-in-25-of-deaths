Deaths linked to  heart disease  and
stroke would be reduced 25 percent if people quit smoking,
limited salt intake and adopted other healthy habits, the U.S.
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.  At least 200,000 deaths a year in the U.S. from
cardiovascular diseases are avoidable, with men twice as likely
as women to die from such circumstance, and blacks succumbing at
double the rate of whites, the CDC said today in a  report . The
U.S. South carries the highest rate of preventable heart disease
and stroke deaths.  Cardiovascular diseases are the leading causes of death in
the U.S, killing almost 800,000 people a year, the agency said.
The rate of preventable deaths from heart disease and stroke
fell 30 percent from 2001 to 2010, though there wasn’t much
improvement in those younger than 65, the CDC said.  “Despite progress against heart disease and stroke,
hundreds of thousands of Americans die each year from these
preventable causes of death,” CDC Director Thomas R. Frieden,
said in a statement. “Many of the heart attacks and strokes
that will kill people in the coming year could be prevented by
reducing  blood pressure  and cholesterol and stopping smoking.”  Heart disease includes coronary artery disease, which can
lead to a heart attack.  Demographic Results  The state with the lowest rate of avoidable cardiovascular
deaths, at 36.3 per 100,000 people, is  Minnesota , according to
the report. Washington, D.C., topped the list at 99.6 per
100,000. Black men have the most to be worried about with an
avoidable death rate in 2010 that is about 80 percent higher
than that of white males and black females, the CDC said. The
rate of preventable heart disease or stroke deaths among black
men was about 150 per 100,000 people, the agency reported.  The CDC recommended people manage risk factors for heart
disease and stroke, such as high blood pressure and cholesterol
and diabetes, by working with their doctors, engaging in
moderately intense exercise, eating a healthy diet low in sodium
and trans fats and stopping smoking.  To contact the reporter on this story:
