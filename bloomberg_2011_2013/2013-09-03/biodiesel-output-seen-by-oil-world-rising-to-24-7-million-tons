Global biodiesel production will
advance to 24.7 million metric tons in 2013 as producers direct
more soybean oil, the leading feedstock used for it, toward the
fuel amid declining vegetable oil prices, Oil World said.  Biodiesel output will increase 6.3 percent in 2013 compared
with a 5.8 percent rise last year, the Hamburg-based researcher
said in an e-mailed report today. It’s advanced since 2009.
 Brazil ’s production estimate was raised 11 percent to 2.65
million tons this year, while output in  Argentina  won’t fall
below 1.8 million tons, as had been predicted previously.  The fuel is benefiting from its relative attractiveness as
an end-product for feedstocks, or raw materials used in the
industrial process, such as soybean, palm and rapeseed oil, as
well as elevated crude prices, according to the researcher.  Conditions “for biodiesel producers have improved owing to
a sharp decline of prices of vegetable oils and fats under the
lead of soya oil,” Oil World said. “Also the appreciation of
crude mineral oil prices is promoting the demand for biofuels.”  Global  soybean oil  used for biodiesel production is
estimated to rise 2.9 percent to 7.08 million tons this year. In
the U.S. soybean production for fuel is expected to increase 20
percent to 2.2 million tons in 2013. Brazil’s production is seen
advancing 12 percent to 2 million tons. Argentina’s output is
forecast to be 1.83 million tons, 25 percent lower than in 2012.  Palm oil, the second-biggest feedstock used for fuel
output, is expected to advance 11 percent to 6.34 million tons
in 2013. Rapeseed oil used for the fuel is seen falling 3.5
percent to 6.01 million tons on setbacks in the EU and the U.S.,
Oil World said.  Palm Oil  Malaysia , the world’s second-biggest  palm oil  producer, had
dry weather in June and July that may have damaged the crop
feeding into the biodiesel price. The main growing areas of
Johor and Perak, together accounting for almost 30 percent of
national production, had “patchy” rainfall receiving less than
60 percent of the usual amount for the two months.  “If precipitation falls sharply below average in that
period, the high absolute water requirements of the oil palms
cannot be satisfied and their productivity may suffer,”
according to the report.  Indonesia , the biggest palm oil producer, is seen raising
the amount used for fuel by 16 percent to 1.8 million tons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
