BYD Electronic International Co. (285)  and
 Compal Communications Inc. (8078)  led gains of  Nokia Oyj (NOK1V) ’s Asian
suppliers after  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)  offered to pay 5.44 billion
euros ($7.2 billion) for the Finnish company’s handset business.  BYD, which supplies keypads and casings to Nokia, surged
 7.5 percent  in Hong Kong to HK$3.71 as of 1:55 p.m. local time,
headed for the biggest one-day gain since June 26. Compal
Communications, which provides Nokia with design and assembly
services, closed 6.9 percent higher in Taipei, its biggest gain
since July 11. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index rose 1.4 percent.  Microsoft will pay 3.79 billion euros for Nokia’s devices
unit and 1.65 billion euros for patents, the companies said in a
statement today. Nokia is coping with cash-flow challenges as
its phones lose market share to handsets from Apple Inc. and
manufacturers using Google Inc.’s Android operating system. The
Espoo, Finland-based company has lost more than 5 billion euros
in nine quarters.  Nokia had the largest share of the handset market until it
was overtaken by  Samsung Electronics Co. (005930)  in 2012, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Samsung Electronics fell as much as
1.9 percent while  LG Electronics (066570)  dropped as much as 0.6 percent.  Other Asian suppliers to Nokia that rose include FIH Mobile
Ltd., which climbed as much as 6.8 percent.  Compeq Manufacturing
Co. (2313)  gained as much as 4.4 percent and  Catcher Technology Co. (2474) 
increased as much as 4.9 percent.  “Today marks a moment of reinvention,” Microsoft Chief
Executive Officer  Steve Ballmer  and Nokia Chief Executive
Officer Stephen Elop said in joint blog post. “With the
commitment and resources of Microsoft to take Nokia’s devices
and services forward, we can now realize the full potential of
the Windows ecosystem, providing the most compelling experiences
for people at home, at work and everywhere in between.”  The devices and services business generated about 50
percent of Nokia’s net sales during 2012, worth an estimated 15
billion euros, the companies said.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
