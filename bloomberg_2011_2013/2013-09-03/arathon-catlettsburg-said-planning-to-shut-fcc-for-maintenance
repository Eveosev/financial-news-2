Marathon Petroleum Corp. (MPC)  plans to
shut a fluid catalytic cracker at the Catlettsburg,  Kentucky ,
refinery for work next week, according to a person familiar with
operations.  Maintenance on the unit is scheduled to last about 40 days,
said the person, who asked not to be identified because the
information isn’t public. Fluid catalytic crackers process
vacuum gasoil into higher-value gasoline or lighter products.  Marathon had no comment on turnaround or maintenance
activity at the plant, said Jamal Khiery, a company spokesman.  The Catlettsburg refinery , in northeastern Kentucky on the
Big Sandy River, has a capacity of 240,000 barrels a day. The
plant processes a wide range of both sweet and sour crude oils
and distributes products by pipeline, barge, truck and rail,
according to Marathon’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
