PetroChina Co. (857)  was sued by an
investor who claims the oil producer violated U.S. securities
laws by failing to disclose corruption that exposed it to
government investigations and penalties.  Johan Broux, an investor in  Belgium , filed the complaint
yesterday in Manhattan federal court seeking to represent all
buyers of PetroChina securities from April 26, 2012, to Aug. 27
of this year. Broux said PetroChina shares dropped more than 3.5
percent Aug. 28 on news that two Chinese government agencies
were investigating company officials for corruption.  In addition to PetroChina, the complaint names as
defendants Chairman and President Zhou Jiping, Chief Financial
Officer Yu Yibo and two former company executives -- ex-CFO Zhou Mingchun and former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Jiang Jiemin. Broux seeks unspecified damages.  PetroChina officials in Beijing couldnâ€™t be reached
yesterday for comment on the suit.  The case is Broux v. PetroChina Co. Ltd., 13-cv-06180, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of New York ( Manhattan ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
