GLP J-REIT, a  Japan  logistics trust
that debuted in December, plans to raise as much as 23 billion
yen ($231 million) in an additional share sale in  Tokyo  to
acquire properties and to repay debt.  The real estate investment trust will acquire nine
properties for 56 billion yen, it said in a statement to the
Tokyo Stock Exchange today. The REIT’s Singaporean sponsor,
Global Logistic Properties Ltd., separately said it plans to
sell two properties in Japan for $287 million to the trust it
partly owns.  The growth of Japan’s logistics market, helped by a boost
in e-commerce transactions, has attracted companies including
GLP to Japan’s warehouse industry. Investments in industrial
space returned 5.8 percent on average for the year ended April,
more than double the returns from investing in office buildings,
according to London-based Investment Property Databank Ltd.  GLP (GLP)  will sell the properties at a 1 percent premium to the
appraised value, the company said in an e-mailed statement
today. The sale will be completed by March 2014 and net cash
proceeds from the property sale are estimated at 13.6 billion
yen, according to the statement.  GLP also plans to reinvest the capital to maintain its 15
percent stake in the J-REIT as well as developments in  China ,
Japan and  Brazil , the company said.  Separately, GLP  Japan Income Partners  I, which is 33.3
percent owned by GLP, sold 7 assets to the J-REIT for 27.5
billion yen. The sale will be completed in October, GLP said.  Shares of Global Logistic increased 2.2 percent to S$2.81
at 3:54 p.m. in Singapore trading.  GLP J-REIT (3281)  was 1.9 percent
higher at 96,000 yen at the close of trading in Tokyo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
