Rubber extended a rally for a second
day, reaching the highest level in more than three months, as a
depreciating yen increased the appeal of contracts denominated
in the Japanese currency.  Rubber for delivery in February on the Tokyo Commodity
Exchange advanced as much as 2.9 percent to 286.7 yen a kilogram
($2,878 a metric ton), the highest for a most-active contract
since May 23, and traded at 283.7 yen at 11:15 a.m. local time.
The rally pared losses to 6.2 percent this year.  The yen slid to 99.70 per dollar, the weakest level in a
month, as signs of a global economic recovery sapped investor
demand for the currency as a haven. Manufacturing data from
 China  has strengthened the case for a recovery in the world’s
second-largest economy and biggest user of rubber.  “Futures are being bought as concerns over the global
economy are receding and Chinese data boosted the outlook for
demand,” said Kazuhiko Saito, an analyst at broker Fujitomi Co.  The contract for January delivery on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange was little changed after yesterday surging 5.3 percent
to 21,055  yuan  ($3,440) a ton. Thai rubber free-on-board rose
0.3 percent to 84.90 baht ($2.65) a kilogram yesterday, said the
Rubber Research Institute of  Thailand .  Thailand, the largest producer, will stop collecting fees
on rubber exports until Dec. 31 to help boost local prices,
according to Office of the Rubber Replanting Aid Fund.  The move will encourage exporters to buy more rubber from
farmers, said Prasit Meadsen, the office’s acting director. Thai
exporters pay 2 baht a kilogram on rubber shipments.  To contact the reporter on this story:
