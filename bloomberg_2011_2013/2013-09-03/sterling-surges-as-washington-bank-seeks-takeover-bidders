Sterling Financial Corp. (STSA) , the
Washington state lender backed by  Warburg Pincus  LLC and Thomas
H. Lee Partners LP, rose 13 percent after the bank held talks
with potential suitors.  The bank  climbed  9.2 percent to $26.42 at 5:20 p.m. in  New
York , making it the sixth-best performer in the Russell 2000
Index. Sterling has sought takeover bids in recent weeks and
held talks with at least two bidders, people with direct
knowledge of the matter said last week.  Sterling had a market value of about $1.5 billion before
today, which would rank among the biggest of the more than 100
bank takeover deals announced this year, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Suitors for U.S. lenders have been
discouraged by new costs imposed under the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act,
and by the fate of M&T Bank Corp.’s year-old bid for Hudson City
Bancorp, which was delayed by added scrutiny from regulators.  Warburg Pincus and  Thomas H. Lee Partners  each held more
than 20 percent of the Spokane-based bank’s  common stock  as of
Jan. 31, according to the company. Sterling Chief Financial
Officer Patrick J. Rusnak declined to comment last week on
potential bids.  U.S. bank takeovers announced this year total $7.93
billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The largest
was PacWest Bancorp’s $2.2 billion bid last month for
CapitalSource Inc. The Hudson City takeover, which is still
pending, was valued at about $3.7 billion when announced on Aug.
27, 2012.  Capital Support  Sterling sold stakes in 2010 to New York-based Warburg and
Boston’s Thomas H. Lee as three straight annual losses eroded
capital. It also took $303 million from the U.S. bank bailout
fund, which was repaid a year ago through a public stock
offering.  The firm was profitable for the past two fiscal years and
the shares had advanced about 16 percent in 2013 through last
week. Assets stood at $9.9 billion as of midyear with deposits
of $6.6 billion from 175 branches in Washington,  Oregon ,  Idaho 
and California. It’s run by Greg Seibly, the president and chief
executive officer, who joined in late 2009.  To contact the reporters on this story:
