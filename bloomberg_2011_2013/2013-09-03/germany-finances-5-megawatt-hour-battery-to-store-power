Germany â€™s Environment Ministry will
help fund a 5 megawatt-hour battery, to be built in the northern
state of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, to store surplus
renewable energy.  The ministry will spend 1.3 million euros ($1.7 million) on
the facility in Schwerin, which will use lithium-ion technology
operated by Wemag AG, the ministry said today in a statement.
Batteries can absorb excess power from wind turbines and solar
panels and send it back to the grid when demand outpaces supply.  To contact the reporter on this story:
