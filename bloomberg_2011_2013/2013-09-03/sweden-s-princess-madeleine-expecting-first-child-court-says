Sweden ’s Princess Madeleine and her
husband Christopher O’Neill are expecting their first child, the
Royal Court announced today.  Madeleine, the youngest child of King Carl Gustaf and Queen Silvia, married British-American businessman O’Neill in June.
The couple’s first child is expected to be born at the beginning
of March, the Court said in a statement on its website.  The 31-year-old princess is fourth in line to Sweden’s
throne after sister Crown Princess Victoria, niece Princess
Estelle and brother Prince Carl Philip. Princess Estelle was
born in February 2012.  No changes to Madeleine’s schedule of engagements and work
for charity organization Childhood are planned during the fall
of 2013, the Court said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
