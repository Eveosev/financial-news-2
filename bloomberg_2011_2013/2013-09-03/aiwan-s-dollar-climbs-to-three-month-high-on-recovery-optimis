Taiwan ’s dollar advanced to the
strongest level in almost three months after overseas investors
boosted holdings of the island’s stocks amid optimism a global
economic recovery is gathering pace.  International funds bought more Taiwanese equities than
they sold in the past four days, bringing net purchases to $557
million. The  Taiex index  of shares rose for a fifth day today,
the longest winning streak since July. Official reports
yesterday showed China’s manufacturing expanded the most in 16
months in August, while a similar gauge for Europe gained more
than economists forecast. Taiwan recorded a current-account
 surplus  of $13.8 billion in the second quarter.  “Southeast Asian countries have been suffering more
capital outflows, so economies with healthy trade surpluses like
Taiwan benefit,” said  Frances Cheung , a Hong Kong-based senior
strategist at Credit Agricole CIB. “When the  market sentiment 
is better, it will look for currencies to buy but it is still
selective.”  The local dollar strengthened 0.5 percent to NT$29.751

Inc. prices show. It touched $29.705 earlier, the strongest

before the 4 p.m. close yesterday and ended 0.3 percent higher.

asked not to be identified.  Offshore Forwards  One-month non-deliverable forwards gained 0.1 percent to
NT$29.679 per  U.S. dollar , according to data compiled by
