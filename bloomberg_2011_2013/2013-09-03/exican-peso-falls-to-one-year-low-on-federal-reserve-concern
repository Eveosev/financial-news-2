Mexico ’s peso declined to its lowest
level in a year as U.S. manufacturing growth added to
speculation that the Federal Reserve will curtail a stimulus
program that has supported emerging-market assets.  The peso depreciated 0.7 percent to 13.4256 per U.S. dollar
at 9:10 a.m. in Mexico City, the weakest on a closing basis
since July 2012. Yields on peso bonds maturing in 2024 increased
four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 6.45 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “This is going to continue until the Fed gives a clear
direction,” Eduardo Rodriguez, a trader at Casa de Bolsa
Finamex SAB, said in a telephone interview from Guadalajara,
Mexico. “The market is now interpreting that the Fed will
decide to reduce stimulus in the short term.”  The peso fell after the Institute for Supply Management
reported that its index of U.S. manufacturing increased to 55.7
in August from 55.4 in the prior month. A reading of 50 is the
dividing line between expansion and contraction. Mexico sends
about 80 percent of its exports to its northern neighbor.  To contact the reporters on this story:
