Japanese  shares  rose, with the Topix
index climbing the most in a month, as the yen fell to a one-month low to the dollar amid signs of global economic recovery.  Toyota Motor Corp., Asia’s biggest carmaker, advanced 3.3
percent. Kansai Electric Power Co. jumped the most on the Nikkei
225 Stock Average after a panel of experts said an earthquake
fault under the utility’s Ohi nuclear plant may not be active.
 Pigeon Corp. (7956)  surged 7.9 percent after the baby-goods maker
boosted its profit forecast by 16 percent. Nomura Holdings Inc.
climbed 4.9 percent as brokerages gained the most among the 33
Topix subsectors after losing 6.9 percent last month.  The Topix increased 2.8 percent to 1,149.18 at the close in
Tokyo, its biggest gain since Aug. 2, as all its  groups  rose.
The measure lost 2.3 percent last month to cap the longest
monthly losing streak since 2008. The Nikkei 225 added 3 percent
to 13,978.44, with just one company falling.  Japan ’s currency
slid to 99.55 against the greenback, its lowest since Aug. 2.  “Investors’ risk aversion has started to recede,” said
 Hideyuki Ishiguro , senior strategist at Okasan Securities Co. in
Tokyo. “Exporters generally estimate the currency at 93.5 yen
to the dollar, so the yen’s level now raises optimism that we’ll
see upwards earnings revisions in the next reporting season.”  Gauges from the U.K. to Spain signaled a pick-up in
European output. Manufacturing in  China  climbed to a 16-month
high in August, while a gauge of non-manufacturing industries
released today fell to 53.9 from 54.1 in July, remaining above
the 50 level that indicates expansion. The Institute for Supply
Management is expected to say U.S. factory activity expanded for
a third month.  Yen Weakens  The yen slipped 0.2 percent to 99.55 per dollar today,
after retreating 1.2 percent yesterday, as economic data damped
demand for haven assets.  Toyota gained 3.3 percent to 6,200 yen, while Honda Motor
Co., which gets more than 80 percent of revenue abroad,
increased 2.4 percent to 3,655 yen.  Panasonic Corp. (6752) , which
generates almost half its sales outside Japan, jumped 3.7
percent to 918 yen.  “Investors are now seeing global risk as controllable and
relief is spreading,” said  Akio Yoshino , Tokyo-based chief
economist at Amundi Japan Ltd., which oversees 3.3 trillion yen
($33 billion) in assets. “After Japanese stocks fell in August,
we’re also seeing some technical rebound. The yen may weaken to
105 per dollar by year-end if we see further growth strategies
from Abenomics.”  Mitsubishi Motors Corp. was the second-biggest gainer on
the Nikkei 225 today. The automaker jumped 7.7 percent to 1,077
yen as the currency weakened and after the 14-day  relative
strength index  on the stock yesterday fell to 25. A reading
below 30 indicates to some traders that the shares have fallen
too far.  Utilities Gain  Kansai Electric rose 8.1 percent to 1,217 yen, the most
since May 29. A Nuclear Regulation Authority panel of
seismologists and geologists said an earthquake fault-line under
the Osaka-based utility’s Ohi nuclear plant is not active, while
noting that the ruling was not final.  Tokyo  Electric Power Co., also known as Tepco, gained 3.4
percent to 525 yen after Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said his
government will provide whatever funds are necessary to contain
the Fukushima nuclear disaster. Japan may spend 47 billion yen
on controlling radiation leaks at the wrecked plant, including
constructing an underground frozen wall to block the movement of
groundwater, Trade and Industry Minister Toshimitsu Motegi told
reporters today.  Pigeon jumped 7.9 percent to 4,905 yen, the most since
March 6, after earlier surging to its highest level on record.
The company raised its full-year net income forecast by 16
percent to 5.6 billion yen.  Banks, Brokerages  Financial stocks advanced today. A Topix measure of
brokerages added 4.8 percent, the most since June 10. The Topix
Banks Index, which makes up 10 percent of the broader gauge,
rebounded 3.6 percent after dropping 3.3 percent in August.  Nomura, Japan’s biggest securities company, added 4.9
percent to 729 yen. Online brokerage Monex Group Inc. jumped 6.6
percent to 38,850 yen, the most in eight weeks. Mitsubishi UFJ
Financial Group Inc., Japan’s No. 1 lender, advanced 5 percent
to 607 yen.  “Brokers and banks are rebounding after being oversold,”
said  Junichi Misawa , head of equity investment at Sumitomo
Mitsui Trust Asset Management Co. in Tokyo. “When the market
just kept falling, these sectors were sold off a lot.”  The Topix traded at 1.20 times  book value  today, compared
with 2.40 for the S&P 500 on Aug. 30 and 1.71 for the Stoxx
Europe 600 Index yesterday. The Japanese gauge’s 30-day  historic
volatility  was at 28.38 today, compared with its five-year
median of 19.42.  To contact the reporters on this story:
