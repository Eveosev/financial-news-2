Canada ’s dollar snapped four days of
losses on speculation tensions in  Syria  will drag on, creating
demand for the currencies of commodities-exporting nations.  The Canadian currency rose against 14 of its 16 most-traded
peers after U.S. President  Barack Obama  decided to seek
authorization from Congress before ordering a strike against
Syria for the alleged use of chemical weapons. Futures on crude
oil, Canada’s largest export, gained as much as 1.2 percent.  “The situation in Syria is going to take a lot longer than
people thought so commodity prices are likely to stay elevated a
lot longer than people thought,” Greg Anderson, the head of
global foreign-exchange strategy at Bank of Montreal, said in a
phone interview from Toronto. “Commodity currencies have become
a lot more attractive.”  The loonie, as the Canadian dollar is nicknamed for the
image of a waterfowl on the C$1 coin, gained 0.3 percent to
C$1.0513 per U.S. dollar at 8:31 a.m., after dropping 0.4
percent last week, its third straight weekly decline. One loonie
purchases 95.12 U.S. cents.  Bets by futures traders the Canadian dollar will weaken
versus its U.S. peer  outnumbered  those it will gain by the most
in 10 weeks, data from the Washington-based Commodity Futures
Trading Commission show. The difference in the number of wagers
by hedge funds and other large speculators on a decline in the
Canadian dollar compared with those on a gain -- so-called net
shorts -- was 24,959 in the week ended Aug. 27, the most since
June 21.  To contact the reporter on this story:
