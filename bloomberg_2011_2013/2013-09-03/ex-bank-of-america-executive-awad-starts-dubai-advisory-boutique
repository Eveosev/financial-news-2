Former  Bank of America Corp. (BAC) 
executive Ziad Awad is setting up an independent consulting firm
in Dubai as corporate activity picks up in the  Persian Gulf  and
investment banks scale back in the region.  Awad, who also worked at  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  in the
Middle East, will become chief executive officer of Boardroom
Metrics Arabia in Dubai, offering merger and acquisition
advisory, corporate governance and marketing services, he said
today in a telephone interview from the city.  “Markets are definitely picking up across all segments and
we expect a lot of business to come from companies in the pre-IPO and pre-M&A stage,” he said. “With the expected shift
toward public equity markets, corporations have an increased
need for accomplished and senior skilled advisers.”  Merger and acquisition deals valued at $39.1 billion have
been announced in the Middle East and Africa this year, the
highest since the same period in 2007 and 15 percent higher than
a year earlier, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Boardroom Metrics , based in Ontario, Canada, is a
franchise-based business with about 25 consultants. The Dubai
office has also enlisted  Nasser Saidi , a Lebanese politician and
economist who previously served as the chief economist of the
Dubai International Financial Centre, according to Boardroom
Metrics’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
