Turkey ’s  inflation rate  exceeded
analyst estimates last month, as higher service costs reduced
the impact of falling food prices.  Annual inflation fell to 8.2 percent in August from 8.9
percent a month earlier, missing the median estimate of 8.1
percent in a Bloomberg survey of seven economists, the Ankara-based statistics agency said today. Food and clothing prices
fell from a month earlier, while education and entertainment
costs increased.  Central bank Governor Erdem Basci increased his year-end
inflation forecast last month to 6.2 percent from 5.3 percent,
as the lira slides and the cost of energy imports rises. Basci
said he won’t raise  interest rates  to curb prices, even though
he vowed to keep monetary policy tight using other tools until
inflation approaches the year-end forecast.  The inflation figures “will not give much to the market to
chew in terms of its possible monetary-policy repercussions,’’
because investors believe the central bank is responding to the
 currency market  and U.S. bond yields instead, Istanbul-based
broker Is Invest said in an e-mailed report.  The lira weakened 0.7 percent to 2.0359 per dollar at 11
a.m., extending this year’s loss to 12.4 percent, making it the
worst-performing emerging-market currency in  Europe , Africa and
the  Middle East  after South Africa’s rand, according to data
compiled by Bloomerg. Yields on two-year benchmark lira bonds
increased 10 basis points, or 0.1 percentage point, to 9.58
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
