The mammalian world may harbor at
least 320,000 viruses, scientists estimated in new research that
aims to speed the control of new infectious killers.  The tally, based on data collected from flying foxes in 
 Bangladesh  applied to the 5,486 known species of mammal, will
help create a more systematic way of managing outbreaks,
particularly those spreading from animals to humans, scientists
from  Columbia University  and the  EcoHealth Alliance  wrote in a
paper published today in the journal  mBio .  Zooneses , or diseases that transmit from vertebrate animals
to humans, account for almost 70 percent of emerging infectious
diseases including HIV, Ebola and severe acute respiratory
syndrome, or SARS, the scientists said.  “This is a real breakthrough,” said  Peter Daszak , a study
author and president of EcoHealth Alliance, a biodiversity
conservation organization. “Instead of just sitting here and
waiting for them to emerge and kill us, we want to be ahead of
the curve and fight them before they even kill the first ever
person.”  Money spent researching disease threats would represent a
fraction of the cost of fighting a contagion such as SARS, whose
economic impact is estimated at $16 billion, the scientists
wrote in the study.  The cost of uncovering all viruses in mammals is about $6.3
billion, and expenses could be cut to $1.4 billion by limiting
discovery to 85 percent of estimated viral diversity, they said,
based on their extrapolation of results.  To contact the reporter on this story:
