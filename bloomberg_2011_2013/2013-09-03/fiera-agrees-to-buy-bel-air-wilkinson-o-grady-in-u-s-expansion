Fiera Capital Corp. (FSZ) , the Canadian
money manager looking to double its assets, agreed to buy
wealth-management firm Bel Air Investment Advisors LLC and
investment manager Wilkinson O’Grady & Co. for about $156.3
million to expand in the U.S.  The agreement to buy Los Angeles-based Bel Air, including
its affiliate Bel Air Securities LLC, and New York-based
Wilkinson O’Grady adds C$8.5 billion ($8.1 billion) in assets
under management to Fiera’s private-wealth unit, the Montreal-based firm said today in a statement.  “We see tremendous growth potential in the U.S. private-wealth market and these transactions fit perfectly with our plan
to create value by becoming a leading North American investment-management firm within the next five years,” Fiera Chief
Executive Officer Jean-Guy Desjardins said in the statement.  Fiera has sought to increase assets through internal growth
and acquisitions, including its purchase of Natcan Investment
Management from  National Bank of Canada (NA)  last year. Desjardins
said in a May interview that he’s seeking to double the firm’s
assets to C$150 billion by adding smaller U.S. companies.  The Bel Air brand will operate under Fiera Capital Private
Wealth North American division and will be led by Bel Air’s
senior managing partner Todd Morgan, who becomes chairman of the
unit.  The two latest U.S. acquisitions will “generate low
double-digit accretion” to Fiera’s adjusted earnings per share
next year, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
