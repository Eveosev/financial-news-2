The Nasdaq OMX Helsinki 25 index , a
gauge of  Finland ’s benchmark stocks, soared the most in 21
months, lifted by  Nokia Oyj (NOK1V) ’s sale of its handset business to
 Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)   The index rose as much as 4.7 percent, the most since Nov.
28, 2011. The gauge advanced 3.9 percent to 2,518.31 at 11 a.m.
local time in the Finnish capital, adding 6.26 billion euros
($8.25 billion) in value from yesterday. The gain made it
today’s biggest winner among  Europe ’s benchmark stock indexes.  Nokia  shares  jumped as much as 48 percent today, the most
on record, after Microsoft Corp. agreed to buy its handset
business and license its patents for 5.44 billion euros. Even
after today’s gain, Nokia -- once Finland’s most valuable
company -- has lost more than 90 percent of its share value
since a 2000 peak after losing ground to U.S. rivals.  With today’s surge, the Nasdaq  OMX Helsinki 25 index (HEX25)  has
jumped about 14 percent this year. That compares with a 5.1
percent gain in the Euro Stoxx 50 Index and an 11 percent
advance in the Stoxx Nordic 30 Index. Nokia shares are up 40
percent this year.  Nokia, based in the Finnish city of Espoo, was once the
world’s largest smartphone maker with more than 50 percent of
the market before Apple Inc.’s iPhone and Google Inc.’s Android
smartphone operating system were introduced about six years ago.
Today’s deal will leave Nokia mainly as a network equipment
maker. The devices and services business generated about 50
percent of Nokia’s net sales during 2012, worth an estimated 15
billion euros, the companies said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
