A investor group led by former  Los
Angeles  Dodgers owner  Frank McCourt  acquired a vacant land
parcel near  Manhattan ’s High Line for about $167.5 million, with
plans to build a mixed-use property.  The purchase of the 26,000-square foot (2,400-square-meter)
development site at 360 10th Ave. was completed Aug. 30,
according to a statement today from the property’s seller,
Sherwood Equities and Long Wharf Real Estate Partners LLC. The
firms bought the land in 2011 for $43.5 million.  The lot, between 30th and 31st streets, is the first
acquisition in  New York  City for McCourt Partners. The firm
plans a project that will include retail, commercial space and
residential units, according to a separate statement from the
buyer. The parcel is near the northern end of the High Line, the
elevated park on the site of a former rail crossing.  “We are very optimistic about the long-term opportunities
in the  New York City  real estate market, and we believe the
value of this area in particular will increase substantially
over the next decade,” Frank McCourt said in the statement.
“We look forward to developing an important new building that
will tap in to the vibrant artistic and creative community of
this neighborhood and add to the excitement of the West Side.”  McCourt Partners is a unit of McCourt Global LP, an
investment firm with offices in New York and Los Angeles.  To contact the reporter on this story:
