U.S. stocks pared gains after
Speaker of the House  John Boehner  said he will support the
president’s call for action against  Syria .  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index was up 0.6 percent at
1,642.94 at 11:26 a.m. in New York after climbing as much as 1.1
percent.  Use of chemical weapons requires a response and only the
U.S. has the capability to “warn others around the world that
this type of behavior is not going to be tolerated,” Boehner, an
Ohio Republican, told reporters after meeting with President
Obama.  “This is something that the United States as a country
needs to do,” he said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
