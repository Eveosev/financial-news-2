Cattle futures climbed on signs that
supplies of animals are shrinking, curbing the outlook for U.S.
beef production. Hog prices fell.  Meatpackers processed 605,000 cattle last week, down 1
percent from a week earlier and 2.4 percent fewer than a year
earlier, according to the  U.S. Department of Agriculture .
Feedlots lowered the number of cattle added to their herds by 10
percent in July, USDA data show. Futures climbed 1.1 percent in
Chicago last month, the third straight gain.  “The packers need cattle sooner this week,”  Dennis Smith ,
a senior account executive at Archer Financial Services Inc. in
Chicago, said in a telephone interview. “As placements continue
to drop off, supplies are going to get tighter.”  Cattle futures for October delivery climbed 0.1 percent to
$1.26975 a pound at 9:50 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange.  Feeder-cattle futures for October settlement rose 0.4
percent to $1.596 a pound.  Hog futures for October settlement declined 0.2 percent to
87.425 cents a pound.  Wholesale  pork  fell 5.6 percent last week to 94.96 cents a
pound, the biggest weekly slump since February. Hog  carcasses 
averaged 203.57 pounds (92.3 kilograms) on Aug. 29, up 0.4
percent from a year earlier, USDA data show.  “I look for more pressure this week into the pork
carcass,” Smith said. “Numbers are coming up. Weights are
up.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
