Gasoline slid as yesterday’s U.S.
Labor Day holiday marked the end of the nation’s summer driving
season and the yearly peak demand period.  Futures dropped as consumption typically declines after
Labor Day when summer vacations end and students return to
school. Gasoline also fell as President  Barack Obama  asked
Congress to support a strike against  Syria  in response to Syrian
President Bashar al-Assad’s alleged use of chemical weapons,
reducing chances for an imminent attack that might threaten
crude supplies.  “We’re right in the heart of the shoulder season and
gasoline seasonally would be a little bearish,” said  Phil Flynn , senior market analyst at Price Futures Group in  Chicago .
“There’s uneasy calm in the market. The conflict in the  Middle
East  has just been pushed back a little, not canceled.”  Gasoline for October delivery fell 1.69 cents, or 0.6
percent, to $2.8732 a gallon at 10:25 a.m. on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange , the third straight drop. Trading volume was
4.3 percent above the 100-day average.  U.S. gasoline  demand  dipped to a five-week low in the seven
days ended Aug. 23 and in June was the lowest for that month
since 2001,  government data  show.  The motor fuel’s crack  spread  versus West Texas
Intermediate crude narrowed 98 cents to $12.75 a barrel. The
fuel’s  premium  over Brent slipped $1 to $5.64 a barrel.  Pump prices , averaged nationwide, fell for the first time
since Aug. 20, dropping 0.3 cent to $3.591 a gallon, Heathrow,
Florida-based AAA said today on its website. Retail prices are
23.6 cents below a year earlier, AAA data show.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel for October delivery rose 0.34 cent
to $3.14 a gallon on trading volume that was 2.4 percent below
the 100-day average. Futures gained 3.2 percent in August, the
third consecutive advance.  ULSD’s  crack spread  versus WTI slipped 12 cents to $23.97 a
barrel, while the premium over Brent also dropped 52 cents to
$16.92.  To contact the reporter on this story:
