Enel SpA (ENEL)  sold hybrid bonds in Europe
where corporate issuance of the securities combining elements of
debt and equity surged to a record $31 billion this year.  Italy’s biggest utility marketed $2.3 billion of notes in
euros and pounds, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Norwegian energy producer  Statoil ASA (STL)  issued its first bonds in
euros and pounds since March 2009, while Spain’s Madrilena Red
de Gas made its debut in the bond market.  Corporate bond issuance is surging after the summer lull,
with non-financial borrowers raising 10 billion euros ($13
billion) of debt so far this week, after issuing 11.2 billion
euros for all of August, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The cost of insuring against losses on company debt
held near a one-week low, with the Markit iTraxx Europe index of
125 companies with investment-grade ratings little changed at
104 basis points.  “Issuers are happy to come quickly while the market is
receptive and demand is solid,” said Geraud Charpin, a fund
manager at Bluebay Asset Management Ltd. in  London , which
oversees $55 billion. “The credit market is in good shape as
supply has been limited in summer while demand remained
strong.”  Two-Part Hybrid  Enel’s board of directors authorized a plan in May to sell
as much as $6.5 billion of hybrid securities in euros, dollars
and pounds by the end of 2014. The notes allow companies to
borrow without putting their credit grade at risk because
ratings firms typically count 50 percent of the bonds as equity,
reducing their view of a company’s indebtedness.  A spokesman for Enel, who asked not to be named citing
company policy, declined to comment on the sale.  The Rome-based utility sold 1.25 billion euros of notes to
yield 6.75 percent that can be bought back by the company in
January 2019. It also raised 400 million pounds ($622 million)
from notes yielding 8 percent that can be called in September
2020. The sale came a day after America Movil SAB, Latin
America’s biggest phone company, priced $2.8 billion of hybrid
debt.  Statoil, based in Stavanger,  Norway , raised the equivalent
of $2.5 billion from bonds in euros and pounds. The company sold
850 million euros of seven-year notes and 650 million euros of
12-year bonds, as well as 350 million pounds of bonds maturing
in April 2041.  Pozuelo de Alarcon, Spain-based Madrilena Red de Gas raised
500 million euros of notes through its Madrilena Red de Gas
Finance BV unit. The five-year bonds yield 235 basis points more
than swaps.  Financial Issuance  Also in the new issue market today, FCE Bank Plc, a unit of
Dearborn, Michigan-based  Ford Motor Co. (F) , sold 500 million euros
of three-year bonds yielding 78 basis points more than swaps.  Financial issuers included  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) , which sold
1.5 billion euros of 10-year subordinated Tier 2 notes that can
be redeemed in January 2019.  Credit Agricole SA (ACA)  has hired banks
to arrange investor meetings for its first issue of contingent
capital notes that will form part of the lender’s Tier 2
capital.  France ’s third-largest bank will meet investors in the
U.S., Europe and Asia this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
