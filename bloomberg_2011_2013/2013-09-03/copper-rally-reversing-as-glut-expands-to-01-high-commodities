The biggest rally in copper in three
months is reversing as analysts predict that the largest glut in
13 years will overwhelm consumption from an accelerating Chinese
economy, which uses two in every five tons.  Production will exceed demand by 408,000 metric tons next
year, the most since 2001, compared with 167,000 tons in 2013,
the average of 15 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg shows.
Futures rose 3.2 percent in August, the most in three months, on
signs of an expansion in Chinese manufacturing. Prices will drop
6.1 percent to $6,800 a ton by the end of December, the median
of 13 analyst and trader predictions shows.  Copper is falling with all other  metals  this year after a
decade when prices rose fivefold. Producers from  Rio Tinto  Group
to BHP Billiton Ltd. added 3.4 million tons to output since
2003, about what Europe uses in a year, and Morgan Stanley
expects another 4.1 million tons by 2017. While prices are 29
percent below the record set in 2011, they are still about 50
percent higher than what the costliest mines need to break even,
Macquarie Group Ltd. estimates.  “We’re having this big wave of copper supply growth,”
said  David Wilson , an analyst at Citigroup Inc. in London who
has followed metals for almost two decades. “The underlying
data in  China  is OK but it doesn’t suggest surging demand. Mine
projects and refinery expansion projects that are happening at
the moment are not going to get stopped.”  Industrial Metals  Copper for delivery in three months fell 9.3 percent to
$7,195.25 a ton this year on the London Metal Exchange, as the
LMEX index of six industrial metals declined 10 percent and the
Standard & Poor’s GSCI gauge of 24 commodities advanced 1.9
percent, led by crude oil and cotton. The MSCI All-Country World
Index of equities gained 8 percent and the Bloomberg U.S.
Treasury Bond Index lost 3.3 percent.  Futures rebounded from this year’s loss of as much as 17
percent in part because of disruptions including mining
accidents, a refinery outage and declining supplies of scrap
metal in China. Some of that is now reversing, with  Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. (FCX)  saying yesterday it ended force
majeure on deliveries from the world’s second-biggest  copper
mine , Grasberg in  Indonesia , after the collapse of a tunnel in
May halted work.  Bearish Bets  Supply from refineries will advance 5.2 percent to a record
21.84 million tons next year as consumption expands 2.8 percent
to an all-time high of 21.42 million tons, Morgan Stanley
estimates. Prices rose since June mainly because traders bought
contracts to close out bearish  bets  and investors should take
advantage of the rally to sell because the surplus will widen
over the next 12 months, Macquarie said in a report Aug. 30.  Hedge funds  and other speculators reduced short contracts
wagering on a decline in eight of the past nine weeks, U.S.
Commodity Futures Trading Commission data show. They also
increased their long contracts in six of those weeks, having
been the most bearish in at least seven years in April. They now
hold a net-long position of 13,043 futures and options, about
three times the average over the past five years.  A gauge of manufacturing in the 17-nation euro area
exceeded 50 in July for the first time in two years, signaling
expansion, and rose again in August, London-based Markit
Economics said Aug. 1 and yesterday. The single-currency bloc
emerged from a record-long recession in the second quarter. U.S.
factory output rose at the fastest pace in more than two years
in July.  Europe  accounts for 17 percent of copper demand and
North America 11 percent, Barclays estimates.  Bonded Warehouses  Chinese consumption will expand 10 percent this year, from
a previous estimate of 8.9 percent, Barclays Plc said in an Aug.
23 report. Inventories held in bonded warehouses in the nation
fell about 70 percent to 300,000 tons since the start of the
year, Glencore Xstrata Plc said Aug. 20. The world’s biggest
commodities trader estimates global demand exceeded supply by
more than 600,000 tons since the start of January.  China imported more refined copper in each of the three
months through July, when shipments reached a 10-month high,
customs data show. A manufacturing gauge rose to a 16-month high
in August, the National Bureau of Statistics and China
Federation of Logistics and Purchasing said Sept. 1. A separate
purchasing managers’ index from HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit
Economics yesterday had the biggest gain in three years and the
first reading above 50 since April.  Economists surveyed by Bloomberg anticipate Chinese
economic growth of 7.5 percent this year, the weakest since
1990, and 7.45 percent in 2014. Morgan Stanley says China will
use 4 percent more copper next year, compared with a gain of 9.1
percent in 2013.  Mine Expansions  While stockpiles in warehouses monitored by the LME fell
8.8 percent to 602,850 tons the past two months, they are still
88 percent bigger than at the start of the year and may exceed 1
million tons in 2014, Macquarie estimates. Orders to remove
metal from storage fell 23 percent in July and August, LME data
show. Inventories tracked by exchanges in  London ,  New York  and
 Shanghai  jumped 35 percent since the start of January.  New mines and expansions to existing ones will keep adding
supply. Second-quarter production grew a higher-than-expected
8.4 percent, Citigroup Inc. said in a report Aug. 21. Ores
globally are yielding an average of 6.55 kilograms (14.44
pounds) of metal for every ton of rock, compared with 6.47 in
2012, according to CRU, the London-based research company.  China will increase production of refined metal by 14
percent to 7.68 million tons next year, or 35 percent of global
supply, Barclays estimates.  Ore Grades  Escondida in  Chile , the largest copper mine, produced 28
percent more metal in the 12 months ended in June, Melbourne-based  BHP Billiton  said in July, attributing some of the gains
to higher average ore grades. Shares of the company, which gets
18 percent of its revenue from industrial metals, dropped 3.5
percent to A$35.82 in Sydney trading this year and will reach
A$38.69 in 12 months, the average of 18 estimates shows.  Aurubis AG (NDA) , the world’s second-largest producer of refined
copper, said Aug. 13 that its earnings for 12 months through
September will be “significantly down” and predicted a price
of $7,000 “for the foreseeable future.” Shares of the Hamburg-based company dropped 17 percent this year in Frankfurt trading.
Those of London-based Rio Tinto declined 14 percent.  Freeport, based in Phoenix, will report a 16 percent drop
in net income to $2.56 billion this year, the mean of 10 analyst
estimates compiled by Bloomberg show. Copper accounts for 79
percent of Freeport’s revenue.  Shares (BHP)  of the company fell 12
percent to $30.22 this year and will reach $35.82 in 12 months,
according to the average of 17 predictions.  “China’s demand has been more robust year to date than
western investors had appreciated,” said Duncan Hobbs, an
analyst at Macquarie in London. “It’s perhaps a big ask for
China to continue to buy at record levels. The balances in the
market remain quite comfortable. In copper, over the course of
next year the surplus will build.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
