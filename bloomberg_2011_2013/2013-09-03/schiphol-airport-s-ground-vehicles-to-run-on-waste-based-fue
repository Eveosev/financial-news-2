Ground transportation vehicles at
Amsterdam’s Schiphol Airport will start being powered by diesel
made from waste products.  The 30 percent waste-based diesel is being provided by
SkyNRG, a clean jet fuel supplier backed by  Air France-KLM (AF) 
Group, SkyNRG said today in an e-mailed statement. It will
result in a 25 percent reduction in carbon dioxide, it said. The
move follows tests conducted at the airport in 2011 to 2012 when
45 vehicles used 100 percent clean diesel.  The fuel is a co-product of SkyNRG’s renewable jet fuel
process. The company already has provided fuel to  Finnair Oyj (FIA1S) ,
Alaska Airlines Inc., and Thomson Airways Ltd.  To contact the reporter on this story:
