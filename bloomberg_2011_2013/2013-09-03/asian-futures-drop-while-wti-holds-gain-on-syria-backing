U.S. stocks rose for a second day,  led by  chipmakers and automobile companies, and Treasuries fell as the  Federal Reserve  said the economy maintained a “modest to moderate” pace of growth. Shares in the  Middle East  sank as the U.S. moved closer to a military strike against Syria.  The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  increased 0.8 percent to 1,653.08 at 4 p.m. in New York. Benchmark gauges in  Abu Dhabi ,  Saudi Arabia , Kuwait and Dubai lost more than 2 percent. The  S&P GSCI (SPGSCI)  gauge of 24 commodities dropped 0.7 percent as metals led losses.

The Fed’s Beige Book survey showed consumers spent more on travel and tourism while manufacturing expanded, as investors searched for clues to the central bank’s plans for stimulus.

His firm has more than $120 billion under management. “The view has been, ‘yes we have some serious issue with Syria, but at the end of the day, growth is improving.’”  Economy Watch  The  S&P 500  gained 0.4 percent yesterday after a report from the  Institute for Supply Management  showed manufacturing grew faster than forecast last month.

Benchmark indexes held their gains as the Senate Foreign Relations Committee voted to authorize President  Barack Obama  to conduct a limited U.S. military operation in Syria, the first step toward congressional endorsement of the effort. The resolution, approved 10-7, supports use of force in a “limited and specified manner against legitimate military targets” during a 60-day period following enactment, with a possible 30-day extension at Obama’s request.
