Jarden Corp. (JAH)  agreed to buy Yankee
Candle for $1.75 billion, making its biggest acquisition to add
the 43-year-old scented candle maker to its collection of more
than 120 consumer brands.  Jarden will use cash to acquire the largest U.S. scented
candle company from a fund managed by private-equity firm
Madison Dearborn Partners LLC, according to a statement today.
The transaction is projected to boost Jarden’s adjusted earnings
per share by about 10 percent and the company expects the deal
to be completed in the fourth quarter.  The purchase may help Jarden, whose products range from Mr.
Coffee machines to Health o meter scales, revive sales growth
that last year slowed to 0.2 percent after increasing 11 percent
in 2011. Madison Dearborn bought Yankee Candle, which sells
items in more than 35,000 retail stores in North America, for
about $1.4 billion in 2007.  “We see significant opportunity to help accelerate the
growth of Yankee Candle in North America and around the world,”
Jarden Chief Executive Officer James E. Lillie said during a
conference call today. While most of the company’s international
sales are from Ireland and the U.K., Jarden can expand the brand
to other European countries where it already sells products, he
said.  Yankee Candle generates less than 15 percent of sales
outside the U.S., according to  slides  posted on Jarden’s website
today.  Shares Surge  Shares of Rye, New York-based Jarden rose 10 percent to
$47.43 at the close in New York for the biggest gain since Oct.
29, 2009. Jarden has advanced 38 percent this year, compared
with a 15 percent gain for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  “This was an opportunistic buy,” Jarden co-counder and
Chairman Martin Franklin said in a telephone interview. While
the company has no other specific acquisition targets now,
“we’re looking at things all the time,” he said.  Sales at Yankee Candle rose 7.4 percent to $844.2 million
last year as the company added stores to its distribution and
selling network, according to a filing. Along with candles,
South Deerfield, Massachusetts-based Yankee Candle makes
potpourri and home decor.  Madison Dearborn and Yankee Candle shareholders will reap
about $550 million in the sale to Jarden. Yankee Candle’s buyout
was funded with $433.1 million in equity, of which Chicago-based
Madison Dearborn put in about $429 million, according to
regulatory filings. In 2011, the company raised debt to pay
Madison Dearborn and other investors a $300.8 million dividend.  A termination fee of $62.5 million applies if Jarden walks
away.  To contact the reporters on this story:
