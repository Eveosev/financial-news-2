The biggest grain-handler in
 Australia ’s largest wheat-producing state has increased its crop
forecast after late rains eased dryness before the harvest
starts next month, boosting global supply prospects. Prices fell.  CBH Group may receive 10 million metric tons to 10.6
million tons of Western Australian grain, up from 9 million tons
forecast a few weeks ago, according to David Capper, general
manager operations at the Perth-based company, who said wheat
receivals will be about 6.5 million tons. The state’s total
grain crop will be 1 million tons higher than CBH’s share, he
said. Last year, state output was 10.9 million tons, government
data show. Australia is the world’s third-largest wheat exporter.  The rains reduced concern that yields may decline, boosting
supplies for the state’s biggest buyers in  Indonesia ,  Japan  and
 Korea . Wheat has lost 27 percent over the past year in  Chicago 
on prospects for record global output as corn and soybean prices
dropped, easing  world food costs . The International Grains
Council raised its global supply forecasts for 2013-2014 on Aug.
30, citing bigger harvests in  Europe  and  South America .  “It’s unbelievable how things have turned around,” said
Jeremy Marwick, 37, a fifth-generation farmer with 2,500
hectares (6,200 acres), including wheat, east of Perth. “It’s a
long time until harvest time yet, but it’s looking good,” he
said in an interview. His father, Gordon, 63, forecasts a yield
of 2.5 tons of wheat per hectare from 2.2 to 2.3 tons last year.  Dry Weather  Western Australia is set to overtake New South Wales as the
country’s biggest wheat producer as the crop rebounds from last
year’s dry weather-affected harvest, boosting national output 15
percent, according to federal government estimates. Last year,
CBH’s total grain receivals were 9.1 million tons, with 5.6
million tons of wheat, according to the company.  Wheat for December delivery lost as much as 0.6 percent to
$6.4325 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, the lowest since
Aug. 23, and was $6.45 at 3:43 p.m. in Perth. Most-active
futures touched $6.355 on Aug. 14, the lowest since June 2012.
Corn has lost 42 percent in Chicago over 12 months, while
soybeans retreated 23 percent. Global food costs tracked by the
 United Nations  fell in July for a third month.  “We had zero rain during June, zero rain through the first
half of July and even in the second half of July rain was quite
sporadic,” Capper said in an interview in Perth. “Through
August we’ve had some really, really good rains.”  Global Harvest  World wheat production may increase 7.6 percent to a record
705.4 million tons in 2013-2014, the U.S. Department of
Agriculture estimates. Canadian output will gain 8.5 percent and
Russian production will climb 43 percent, countering a 6.8
percent drop in the U.S. crop, it predicts. The London-based IGC
said that global wheat output will climb 5.7 percent to 691
million tons, according to an e-mailed report.  “A poor-production outcome is less likely,” said  Luke Mathews , a commodity strategist at  Commonwealth Bank of
Australia (CBA)  in Sydney, who forecasts state wheat output at about
7.2 million tons. “August saw stabilization and improvement in
crop conditions in Western Australia but some deterioration in
the east. There’s a quite a different composition geographically
than the market forecast a few months ago.”  Western Australia’s wheat output will reach 8.8 million
tons after tumbling 38 percent to 6.9 million tons last year,
the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and
Sciences said in June. The bureau is scheduled to update its
production forecasts on Sept. 10.  Long-Term Average  While Capper’s grain-output forecast is in line with
state’s long-term average, dry weather can cut yields. The grain
harvest dropped to 9.1 million tons in 2012-2013, a year after
climbing to a record 15 million tons, according to CBH. This
year, some regions may see production at an all-time high, while
others curb output after the dry weather, Capper said.  CBH, Australia’s biggest cooperative, is owned and
controlled by more than 4,000 grain growers. The company
receives and exports about 95 percent of the Western Australian
grain harvest.  Australia shipped 19 million tons of wheat overseas in
2012-2013, according to the USDA. That compares with exports of
22.2 million tons from the European Union and 27.4 million from
the U.S. Canada ranked fourth with exports of 18.8 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
