The cost of insuring corporate and
sovereign bonds in the Asia-Pacific region against non-payment
fell today, according to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan fell one basis point to 158.5 basis
points as of 8:26 a.m. in  Singapore ,  Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC) 
prices show. The gauge rose 16.9 last month, the most since
June, according to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index dropped one basis point
to 122 as of 10:07 a.m. in Sydney, according to Deutsche Bank AG
prices. The benchmark, which rose 1.2 basis points last month,
is poised for its lowest close since Aug. 26, according to CMA,
which is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices quoted by
dealers in the private market.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index fell 1.5 basis points to 90.8
as of 9:07 a.m. in  Tokyo , according to Citigroup Inc. prices.
The measure is set for its lowest close since May 28, according
to CMA.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
