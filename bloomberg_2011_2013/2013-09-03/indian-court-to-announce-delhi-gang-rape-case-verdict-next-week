An Indian court will deliver its
verdict next week in a trial of four men accused in the gang
rape and murder of a student on a moving bus in New Delhi, a
case that shocked  India  and reverberated around the world.  The court will announce its decision on Sept. 10, A.P.
Singh, a lawyer for some of the defendants, said in a phone
interview. The conclusion to the trial in a specially-convened
fast track court in the nation’s capital will come almost nine
months after the assault on the woman.  The brutal attack on the 23-year-old medical student as she
returned home from the cinema on Dec. 16 triggered street
protests and drew  attention  to the scale of sexual violence
against women in the world’s largest democracy. The student died
from her injuries two weeks later in a Singapore hospital.  Prosecutors have sought the death penalty for the four men.
A teenager, found guilty of taking part in the attack, was
sentenced by a juvenile court last week to three years in a
reform home, the maximum possible punishment as per law.  A fifth defendant and the alleged ring leader of the group
committed suicide in March using a carpet to hang himself from a
ceiling grill in his cell, according to prison authorities. His
family and lawyer said that Ram Singh was murdered and had
previously been attacked by other inmates for his crimes.  To contact the reporters on this story:
