Suedzucker AG (SZU)  slid to a 15-month low
after Exane BNP Paribas predicted that the end of the “highly
regulated” European sugar market will cut earnings at the
continent’s biggest supplier of the dietary staple almost in
half by 2018.  Suedzucker dropped as much as 7.1 percent in Frankfurt
trading to 22.94 euros, the lowest intraday price since May
2012. The shares traded down 5.8 percent at 10:43 a.m. as
volumes exceeded the three-months daily average.  The European Union sets limits on producer sales and
imports of sugar, which props up prices. The EU will abolish the
quotas system by 2017 as part of a wider reform of the  common
agricultural policy  announced on June 26.  “The new EU sugar world will be structurally less
attractive for both investors and industry participants,” Jeff Stent, a London-based analyst at Exane BNP Paribas, said in a
report today. “Suedzucker will likely require material
restructuring and capital expenditure to compete in the new
world.”  Stent estimated that earnings before interest, tax and
amortization in 2018 will be 45 percent below 2013 levels.  Stent lowered its rating on the Mannheim, Germany-based
company to underperform from neutral and cut the target price by
46 percent to 15 euros.  The stock has dropped 23 percent this year, valuing the
company at 4.75 billion euros ($6.26 billion).  For Related News and Information:  To contact the reporter on this story:
