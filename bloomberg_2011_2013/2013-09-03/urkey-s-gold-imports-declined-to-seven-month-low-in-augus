Turkey ’s gold imports declined 63
percent to a seven-month low in August as prices reached the
highest in three months. Silver imports fell 9.3 percent.  Gold imports fell to 13.66 metric tons, the least since
January, from 37.02 tons in July, according to the Istanbul Gold
Exchange’s  website . Inward shipments were about 230.6 tons in
the first eight months this year, almost double the amount in
all of 2012. Prices rose to $1,433.83 an ounce on Aug. 28, the
highest since May 14.  Gold advanced as much as 21 percent from a 34-month low of
$1,180.50 in June as lower prices boosted demand for jewelry,
bars and coins. Turkey, which boosted gold shipments to  Iran 
last year, became a net importer of bullion after ending exports
to the Islamic Republic on tighter U.S. sanctions in July,
Economy Minister Zafer Caglayan said Aug. 16.  “Gold’s short-term potential has been fully exploited for
now,” analysts at Commerzbank AG wrote today in a report.
“Physical gold buyers, who had hugely stepped up their
purchases after the gold price collapsed in the spring, appear
to be acting opportunistically and with great price
sensitivity.”  Gold for immediate delivery traded at $1,394.75 an ounce by
11:18 a.m. in London, for a 17 percent decline this year. Prices
gained for a second straight month in August.  Consumer demand for gold in Turkey jumped 73 percent in the
second quarter as jewelers added to inventories at lower prices,
the London-based World Gold Council said Aug. 15.  International Sanctions  Iran, which has come under sanctions from nations including
the U.S. over its nuclear program, imported 126 tons from Turkey
last year, compared with 1 ton in 2011, according to the
International Trade Centre, a United Nations and World Trade
Organization agency.  Iran, which says its atomic research is for peaceful
purposes only, has boosted gold imports as its ability to
receive payments in foreign currencies was limited by the
international embargo.  There are signs physical gold demand is easing. One-month
gold lease rates in  London , the cost of borrowing the metal,
fell to the lowest in almost two months. An increase in gold
liquidity supply can push lease rates lower, according to the
London Bullion Market Association.  Turkey’s silver imports fell to 30.9 tons in August, from
34.1 tons a month earlier, according to the bourse. The metal
slipped 20 percent this year in London to $24.2343 an ounce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
