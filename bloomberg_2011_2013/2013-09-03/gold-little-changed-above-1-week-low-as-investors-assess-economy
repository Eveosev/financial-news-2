Gold futures rose for the first time
in a week on demand for a haven asset as U.S. President  Barack
Obama  won support from leaders in Congress for a military strike
on Syria.  “I’m going to support the president’s call for action,”
House Speaker  John Boehner  said today. Obama is seeking
congressional approval for action against Syria for what his
administration says was a sarin gas attack last month by the
government in Damascus against its people.  “There is a lot of uncertainty in the air,”  Bill O’Neill ,
a partner at Logic Advisors in Upper Saddle River, New Jersey,
said in a telephone interview. “The safe-haven appeal for gold
is back.”  Gold futures for December delivery rose 1.1 percent to
settle at $1,412 an ounce at 1:40 p.m. on the Comex in New York,
the first advance since Aug. 27. On that date, the price jumped
1.9 percent to the highest since mid-May after U.S. Secretary of
State  John Kerry  said Syria will be held accountable for using
chemical weapons. The metal advanced 6.3 percent in August.  Today, Israel conducted what it called a joint test with
the U.S. of its Arrow Ballistic Missile Defense system over the
 Mediterranean Sea . The Israeli Defense Ministry called it a
success.  Gold has climbed almost 20 percent from a 34-month low of
$1,179.40 an ounce on June 28. The commodity entered a  bear
market  in April, dropping 16 percent this year, as some
investors lost faith in the metal as a store of value amid an
equity rally and low inflation.  Silver futures for December delivery jumped 3.9 percent to
$24.429 an ounce, the biggest gain since Aug. 15.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , platinum futures for
October delivery climbed 0.7 percent to $1,538.20 an ounce.
Palladium futures for December delivery fell 0.8 percent to
$717.95 an ounce. The price dropped for the fourth straight
session, the longest slump in 10 weeks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
