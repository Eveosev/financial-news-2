Resverlogix Corp. (RVX)  climbed to its
highest in almost two months after reporting some patients using
its drug to fight thickening of the arteries had their plaque
levels fall twice as much as targeted.  Resverlogix, based in Calgary, soared 40 percent to 95
Canadian cents at 4 p.m. in Toronto, the highest since July 9,
giving it a  market value  of C$71.2 million.  Full analysis of phase 2 clinical trials show some patients
who were taking the company’s RVX-208 drug along with
Rosuvastatin saw their plaque levels drop 1.4 percent, compared
with the trial’s 0.6 percent target, the company said in a
release today.  “Clearly we have very good reason to be very excited given
the positive findings,” Donald McCaffrey, chief executive
officer at Resverlogix, said in the statement.  The findings support two of the company’s filed patent
applications, for potential protection until 2033, McCaffrey
said.  Resverlogix stock plunged a record 93 percent in June after
initial results from that trial showed RVX-208 had failed to
meet its primary target.  Test results at the time from a 26-week Phase 2b clinical
trial showed patients treated with the RVX-208 drug had a 0.4
percent reduction in plaque levels, short of the 0.6 percent
target drop.  The drug is intended to work by boosting production of a
particle required in a process called reverse cholesterol
transport, in which plaque in the arteries is removed from the
body using the liver.  To contact the reporter on this story:
