Gabriel Resources Ltd. (GBU) , a gold-mine
developer whose biggest shareholder is Paulson & Co., fell the
most in four months after Romanians protested the company’s
Rosia Montana project.  Gabriel dropped 18 percent to C$1.39 at the close in
Toronto, the biggest decline since April 15. Shares of the
Whitehorse, Yukon-based company have fallen 41 percent this
year.  In Bucharest late yesterday, about 1,000 people protested
the mine project and Gabriel’s plan to use cyanide to extract
gold, Mediafax news service reported. The rally followed the
government’s unveiling last week of a draft law that would set
out a plan to allow development of Rosia Montana while
increasing its stake in the project.  Romania ’s President Traian Basescu said yesterday he may
call a referendum next year on Rosia  Montana , which the company
says would be Europe’s largest gold mine project.  Society is “rightfully” reacting to the situation because
Romania suffered from the 2000 Baia Mare spill, Basescu said in
an interview with newspaper Adevarul that was broadcast on its
website. The accident happened when a dam holding back mine
debris burst, flooding the Somes, Tiza and Danube rivers with
tens of thousands of tons of cubic meters of cyanide-contaminated water.  Gabriel expected to get parliamentary approval as soon as
November, Chief Executive Officer Jonathan Henry said yesterday
in a telephone interview. The company has spent more than a
decade trying to develop the gold mine.  Hedge fund Paulson owned 16 percent of Gabriel as of May
17, according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
