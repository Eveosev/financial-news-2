Steel reinforcement-bar futures in
 China  fell for the first time in three days on concern that
gains in the price of futures have outpaced growth in actual
demand.  Rebar for January delivery fell as much as 0.6 percent to
3,765  yuan  ($616) a metric ton on Shanghai Futures Exchange, and
traded 3,772 yuan at 10:52 a.m. local time. Futures have fallen
5.4 percent this year.  The average  spot price  of rebar fell to a two-week low
yesterday, slipping 0.1 percent to 3,596 yuan a ton, according
to Beijing Antaike Information Development Co. Futures rallied
for a third straight month through August.  “The fast gains in rebar futures widened the premium over
spot prices, so traders are pausing for more evidence that
demand will catch up,” said Li Jinlu, Beijing-based analyst at
Yongan Futures Co.  Iron ore  for immediate delivery at Tianjin port gained 0.7
percent to $138.70 a dry ton yesterday, according to a price
index compiled by The Steel Index Ltd.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
