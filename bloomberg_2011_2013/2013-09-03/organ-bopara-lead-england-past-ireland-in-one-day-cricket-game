Eoin Morgan and  Ravi Bopara  both
made unbeaten centuries as  England  beat Ireland by six wickets
in their lone one-day cricket match in Dublin.  Morgan scored 124 and Bopara made 101 as England finished
on 274-4 in reply to Irelandâ€™s 269-7 with seven overs to spare.
The two closed out the game with a 226-run stand for the fifth
wicket, a world record for one-day internationals, after their
team stumbled to 48-4.  Dublin-born Morgan faced 106 balls, hitting eight fours and
four sixes, in recording his first one-day hundred in three
years. Bopara needed just 75 balls to score his first one-day
century, with 10 fours and five sixes.  Opener William Porterfield scored 112 to lead Ireland,
which was put into bat first. Boyd Rankin took 4-46 for England,
and James Tredwell claimed two wickets.  England opens a five-game one-day series against Australia
on Sept. 6 in Leeds. The teams split a two-game Twenty20 series
last week, after England won the Ashes Test series 3-0.  To contact the reporter on this story:
