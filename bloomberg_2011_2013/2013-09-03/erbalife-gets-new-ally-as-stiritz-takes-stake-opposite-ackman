William Stiritz, chief executive
officer of the company that makes Raisin Bran, has taken a 5.2
percent stake in  Herbalife Ltd. (HLF) , giving the nutrition maker
another ally as it fights accusations it’s a pyramid scheme.  Stiritz, chairman and CEO of  Post Holdings Inc. (POST) , became the
fourth largest Herbalife shareholder after the stock purchase,
which he disclosed today in a regulatory filing.  He joins hedge fund manager  Carl Icahn , who earlier this
year took up the fight against investor  Bill Ackman , who has
sold Herbalife shares short and said the company is an illegal
pyramid scheme that should be shut down. The company has
repeatedly denied the allegations.  Icahn, who bought Herbalife shares after Ackman made his
accusations, is the company’s largest individual investor, with
a 16 percent stake, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The shares fell 1.8 percent to $59.90 at the close in New
York, paring an earlier decline of as much as 6.8 percent. The
Cayman Islands-based company’s stock has risen 82 percent this
year, compared with a 15 percent gain for the Standard & Poor’s
500 Index.  For Related News and Information:  To contact the reporter on this story:
