Soybean futures jumped the most in a
week on speculation that a lack of rain in the past 30 days
damaged prospects for yields in the U.S., the world’s biggest
producer. Wheat and corn dropped.  Iowa, Illinois and Indiana had the driest August since
before 1895, according to preliminary data from  T-Storm Weather
LLC  in  Chicago . Temperatures will average as much as 10 degrees
Fahrenheit above normal through Sept. 11, increasing stress on
crops, the company said in a report. Last month, soybean prices
jumped 13 percent, the most since July 2012.  “The dry weather is going to cut yields,”  Jim Gerlach ,
the president of A/C Trading Co. in Fowler, Indiana, said in a
telephone interview. “Soybeans are very resilient plants, but
if it doesn’t rain soon, they will do a poor job of filling
pods.”  Soybean futures for November delivery rose 2.2 percent to
close at $13.8675 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the Chicago Board of
Trade, the biggest gain for a most-active contract since Aug.
26. Soybean-meal futures for December delivery jumped 3.6
percent to $438.90 for 2,000 pounds of the  animal feed .  As much as 40 percent of the Midwest soybean crop is at
risk of additional yield losses this week, the Commodity Weather
Group LLC said in a report today. The weather and crop
forecaster cut its U.S. soybean-yield forecast to 41.7 bushels
an acre on Aug. 30, down from 44.1 bushels previously. Yield
estimates were reduced more than 10 percent in Iowa, Illinois,
 Missouri ,  Wisconsin  and  South Dakota .  About 58 percent of the  crop  was in good-to-excellent
condition in the week ended Aug. 25, down from 62 percent a week
earlier, government data showed on Aug. 26. The top ratings
probably declined as much as 5 percentage points in the past
week, Gerlach said.  Wheat futures for December delivery fell 1 percent to
$6.4725 a bushel, the fifth straight decline. Earlier, the grain
climbed as much as 1.5 percent.  Corn futures for December delivery dropped 1.4 percent to
$4.7525 a bushel. Earlier, the price rose as much as 2.4
percent.  In the U.S., corn is the biggest crop, followed by
soybeans, hay and wheat, government data show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
