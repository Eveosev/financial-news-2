Total Produce Plc (TOT) , an Irish
distributor of fruit and vegetables, climbed to the highest in
over six years in Dublin trading, as the company raised its
full-year earnings target.  Total Produce rose 3.3 percent to 78 cents at 9:19 a.m., the
highest since July 9 2007. That gives the company a market
capitalization of 259 million euros. Over 316,000 shares were
traded, 109 percent of the three month daily average.  The company said trading conditions are satisfactory, and
revised its earnings forecast upwards to the upper half of a 8
cent to 8.80 cents per share range that it set out in May.  “These are a solid set of results,” Merrion analyst David
Holohan wrote in a note to clients today. Total Produce
“remains an undervalued company with a strong medium term
growth trajectory benefitting from increased investment in new
markets.’’  To contact the reporter on this story:
