Quincy Jones, the Grammy-winning
record producer, was named a director of Cambelle-Inland, the
 New York  company housing the Chinese investments of Craig Bouchard, former CEO of steel producers Esmark Inc. and Shale-Inland Holdings LLC.  Yue-Sai Kan, the first Chinese-American host of a
nationally broadcast television show in China, and Clifford Perlman, former chairman of Caesars World Inc., joined Jones on
the board of New York-based Cambelle-Inland, the company said in
a statement today.  “Doing business in Asia is very much about personal
relationships,” Bouchard said in an e-mail. “Our board members
have earned the trust of very senior business leaders in places
like China,  Japan , and  Korea . It’s going to be fun working with
them.”  Bouchard in December stepped down as CEO of Houston-based
Shale-Inland, a steel distributor. Bouchard and his brother
James founded Esmark Inc. in 2003 and expanded the company with
acquisitions, including the hostile takeover of Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel Corp., before selling it to Russia’s OAO
Severstal for about $775 million in 2008. He is also CEO of
Sherman Oaks, California-based  Signature Group Holdings Inc. (SGGH) , an
investment company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
