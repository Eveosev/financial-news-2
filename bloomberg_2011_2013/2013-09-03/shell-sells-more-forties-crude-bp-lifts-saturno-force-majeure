Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  sold two more
cargoes of North Sea Forties crude after offloading three lots
yesterday. A bid and an offer for Russian Urals blend were
withdrawn in the Platts window.  BP Plc (BP/)  removed a force majeure on Saturno crude pumped from
its PSVM project in  Angola , a company spokesman said. “It was
lifted this morning,” Paulo Pizarro, the Luanda-based official,
said today by e-mail. “We are actually already producing
100,000 barrels a day.”  North Sea  Petroineos, a joint venture between PetroChina Co. and
Ineos Group AG, bought F0908 for loading Sept. 15 to Sept. 17 at
30 cents a barrel above Dated Brent and a Sept. 20 to Sept. 22
cargo at plus 65 cents, according to a Bloomberg survey of
traders and brokers monitoring the Platts pricing window. That
compares to three trades yesterday at 45 cents to 95 cents.  Glencore Xstrata Plc failed to buy Forties for Sept. 24 to
Sept. 27 at 85 cents above Dated Brent, the survey showed.  Reported crude trading typically occurs during the Platts
window, which ends at 4:30 p.m. London time.  Brent for October settlement traded at $115.12 a barrel on
the ICE Futures Europe exchange at the close of the window,
compared with $113.90 in the previous session. The November
contract was at $113.19, a discount of $1.93 to October.  The loading days of two Forties cargoes were amended,
according to three people with knowledge of the loading program
who asked not to be identified because the information is
confidential. Lot F0918 will now load on Sept. 25 to Sept. 27,
from an earlier revised Oct. 2 to Oct. 4. Cargo F0915 was to
load on Oct. 4 to Oct. 6, nine days later than planned.  The share of Buzzard crude in the Forties blend fell to 55
percent in the week to Sept. 1, down 3 percent from the previous
week, according to data from the BP website.  Urals/Mediterranean  Shell withdrew an offer to sell Urals for Sept. 15 to Sept.
19 for a third session, this time lowering its offer by 10 cents
from yesterday to 80 cents a barrel below Dated Brent delivered
to Rotterdam.  Lukoil OAO also withdrew a bid to buy the blend for Sept.
17 to Sept. 21 delivered to Augusta,  Italy , at parity to Dated
Brent. Eni SpA bought Urals with the same loading dates on Aug.
30 at a 20-cent discount to the benchmark.  PKN Orlen SA is seeking to buy 100,000 tons of Urals for
loading from the Baltic Sea, say two people with knowledge of
the region’s oil market. The tender closes today.  Libya is producing 240,000 barrels a day, according to the
National Oil Corp. The NOC, as the state-run company is also
known, said on its website that the country is losing $140
million a day because of worker strikes at energy facilities.
The company also reported a sit-in by a “small number” of
guards at the Zawiya refinery entrance and Brega oil storage.  The Zawiya refinery is expected to receive a 640,000-barrel
cargo from the Brega oil terminal, Mansur Abdallah, the plant’s
oil movement coordinator, said in a phone interview today. The
shipment will compensate the supply disruption from the Sharara
oil field, Abdallah said.  Iraqi pipeline exports to the Turkish port of Ceyhan were
halted at 7.00 a.m. local time, 11 hours after flows from Kirkuk
were restarted, according to Boutros Maritime & Transport.  West Africa  Production at Saturno was halted and a force majeure
declared on Aug. 18 when a mooring hawser failed in the offshore
production area of Block 31. The PSVM development was pumping
about 130,000 barrels a day and on its way to 150,000 barrels by
year’s end when the incident occurred, Pizarro said yesterday.  Taiwan CPC Corp. booked the supertanker Kimolos for loading
in West Africa Oct. 1, according to three tanker reports
including one from Athens-based Optima Shipbrokers. The VLCC
will probably load 1 million barrels of Angolan Nemba and 1
million barrels of Cabinda crude, say two traders who
participate in market.  Indian Oil Corp. issued a tender to buy November-loading
crude. The tender closes tomorrow, with offers valid until Sept.
5, according to two traders who participate in the market.  To contact the reporters on this story:
