Dixons Retail Plc, (DXNS)  the largest U.K.
electronics retailer, rose the most since May as a British
Retail Consortium report pointed to strong sales of electrical
goods ahead of a trading update from the company.  The stock  gained  as much as 7.4 percent and was up 7
percent at 44.41 pence as of 1:56 p.m. in  London . That extended
its rise this year to 56 percent, after almost tripling in 2012.  There was “renewed growth for electricals in all
segments” in August, the BRC said today as it reported growth
in U.K. non-food sales that was the strongest since 2010.  Sales of tablets and laptops were boosted last month by
back-to-school purchases, while small household appliances were
also in demand, the BRC said. Sellers of large electrical items
are still benefiting from market-share gains resulting from last
year’s collapse of the rival Comet chain, it said.  The non-food figures “look strong with like-for-like
growth in all categories with a lower level of commentary around
promotional activity,” Richard Edwards, an analyst at Citigroup
Inc. in London, wrote in an e-mailed note.  Dixons is due to announce first-quarter sales on Sept. 5,
the day of its annual general meeting. Citigroup expects the
 Hemel Hempstead , England-based retailer to report a “robust”
performance in the U.K. and Nordics region and estimates growth
of 2 percent in sales at stores open at least a year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
