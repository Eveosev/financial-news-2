Treasuries fell the most in almost
two weeks as a gauge of U.S. manufacturing rose more than
forecast in August, reinforcing bets the  Federal Reserve  will
soon announce plans to reduce monetary stimulus.  Yields on benchmark 10-year notes  climbed  eight basis
points, extending the biggest annual rout in U.S. government
securities in almost four decades. Treasuries fell earlier as
demand for refuge eased while the threat of an immediate U.S.
military strike against Syria declined. The Labor Department
will report on Sept. 6 U.S. payrolls added more jobs in August
than in July, and Fed policy makers meet Sept. 17-18.  “It’s been a one-way down trade with better economic news
and the lessening of concern coming from Syria,” said  Sean Murphy , a trader at Societe Generale SA in New York, one of the
21 primary dealers that trade directly with the Fed. “All eyes
are looking toward that end-of-the-week data when the jobs
market comes out.”  Benchmark 10-year  yields  increased eight basis points, or
0.08 percentage point, to 2.86 percent at 5 p.m. New York time,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader data. They jumped the most on
an intraday basis since Aug. 1 and touched 2.91 percent, the
highest since Aug. 23. The 2.5 percent note due in August 2023
lost 20/32, or $6.25 per $1,000 face amount, to 96 29/32.  Two-year (USGG2YR)  note yields rose as much as three basis points to
0.43 percent, the highest level since July 2011.  Thirty-year (USGG30YR) 
bond yields climbed nine basis points to 3.79 percent and
touched 3.83 percent, the highest since Aug. 23.  Since 1978  Volatility rose to the highest level in almost two months.
Volatility as measured by the Merrill Lynch Option Volatility
Estimate MOVE Index rose to 105.78, the highest since July 8.
The average for 2013 is 68.94.  Treasury trading volume at ICAP Plc, the largest inter-dealer broker of  U.S. government debt , rose 12 percent to $361
billion, the most since Aug. 22. The figure is down from a 2013
high of $662 billion reached on May 22 and up from a low of $148
billion on Aug. 9. The 2013 average is $313 billion.  Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s U.S. Treasury Index is on
course to drop 4.7 percent this year, which would be the biggest
annual loss since the gauge began in 1978.  The  Institute for Supply Management ’s  factory index  climbed
to 55.7, the highest in two years, from the prior month’s 55.4,
the Tempe, Arizona-based group’s report showed today. Forecasts
of 85 economists surveyed by Bloomberg ranged from 51 to 55.8
and averaged 53.8. A reading of 50 is the dividing line between
expansion and contraction.  “People are coming around to the conclusion that the Fed
will start cutting back on bond purchases,” said  Charles Comiskey , head of Treasury trading at the primary dealer  Bank of
Nova Scotia (BNS)  in New York. “The data is pretty good.”  The Labor Department will report Sept. 6 that payrolls
growth accelerated to 180,000 last month from 162,000 in July, a
separate survey projected.  Missile Test  Treasury notes briefly pared declines after  Russia ’s state-run RIA Novosti news agency reported the launch of two ballistic
rockets had been detected in the eastern Mediterranean. Israel
said later the projectiles, which reports said fell into the
water, were a joint missile test with the U.S.  President  Barack Obama , in a surprise announcement Aug. 31,
said he would seek congressional authorization to strike at
Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad’s chemical-weapons capability
in retaliation for its alleged use last month against the
country’s own people.  “The fact that nothing was done over the weekend and that
any response faces the complications of congressional
involvement of course puts that response off and makes its
likelihood subject to politics,”  David Ader  and  Ian Lyngen ,
strategists at CRT Capital Group LLC in  Stamford ,  Connecticut ,
wrote in a client note.  Trimmed Losses  Treasuries trimmed losses as stocks pared advances after
House Speaker  John Boehner  said he’ll support Obama’s call for
action on Syria. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index cut its gain to
0.5 percent, after increasing as much as 1.1 percent.  Boehner, R-Ohio, told reporters after meeting with the
president that use of chemical weapons requires a response and
that only the U.S. has the capability to “stop Assad and to
warn others.” Even so, an alliance of Tea Party members and
left-leaning Democrats was coalescing in the House against using
force in  Syria .  Yield Curve  The Fed will trim its quantitative-easing program of $85
billion in monthly bond purchases at its policy meeting this
month, according to 65 percent of economists in a Bloomberg News
survey in August. The Fed bought $4.79 billion of Treasuries
today maturing from September 2017 to May 2018.  Ten-year securities yielded as much as 248 basis points
more than those due in two years, the widest spread on the yield
curve since Aug. 23. The 2013 low was 141 basis points on May 1.
A steeper yield curve suggests investors are betting faster
growth will lead to higher long-term borrowing rates.  The curve probably will not steepen further, according to
Francesco Garzarelli, co-head of macro and markets research at
Goldman Sachs Inc. in  London .  “We rallied into QE events and then sold off,” Garzarelli
said in a Bloomberg Television interview. “This time around we
could be very apprehensive going into the announcement and
probably rally as the Fed cements this notion of forward
guidance and removes some of the uncertainty around the tapering
event.”  The weighted average of economists’ and strategists’
forecasts compiled by Bloomberg is for the benchmark 10-year
note yield to end 2013 at 2.78 percent and jump to 3.06 percent
by the middle of 2014, a level not seen since July 2011. Fourth-quarter predictions ranged from 2.10 percent to 3.76 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
