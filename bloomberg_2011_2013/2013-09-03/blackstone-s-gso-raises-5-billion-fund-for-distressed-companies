GSO Capital Partners LP, the credit
arm of  Blackstone Group LP (BX) , raised a $5 billion fund to provide
financing to distressed companies.  The GSO Capital Solutions Fund II LP will help companies in
need of cash and facing such liquidity issues as pending debt
maturities and covenant violations, according to a statement
today distributed by Business Wire.  “A fund of this size uniquely positions GSO as one of few
firms that can provide companies in the U.S. and Europe with
large commitments to solve their balance sheet and liquidity
challenges,” Tripp Smith, a co-founder of GSO, said in the
statement.  Investors in the new fund include U.S. state and corporate
pension funds, sovereign-wealth funds, insurance companies,
endowments, foundations and family offices.  New York-based GSO has invested more than $4 billion of so-called rescue financing, with a focus on North America and
Western Europe, according to the statement. The new fund is more
than 50 percent larger than its first such pool, which was
raised in 2010.  Bennett Goodman , Smith and Doug Ostrover co-founded GSO in
2005 to invest in junk-grade corporate debt. The unit, acquired
by Blackstone in 2008, had about $62 billion of assets under
management at the end of June.  High-yield, high-risk, or junk-grade, debt is rated less
than Baa3 by Moody’s Investors Service and below BBB- at
Standard & Poor’s.  To contact the reporter on this story:
