The number of U.S. university
students declined by almost half a million last year, following
years of growth, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.  The decrease was driven by students 25 and older, with
419,000 fewer enrolled in the fall of 2012 from a year earlier,
according to  data  the Census Bureau released today. The number
of college students younger than 25 also declined.  The cost of college continues to rise as the population of
college-age students drops. After two decades of growth, the
number of high-school graduates probably peaked at 3.4 million
in the 2010-2011 school year, the Western Interstate Commission
on Higher Education said in January. College enrollment at the
undergraduate and graduate levels had grown to 3.2 million
between 2006 and 2011 before the decline.  One group that didn’t follow the trend was Hispanics, whose
numbers grew by about 447,000 between 2011 and 2012.  “This increase in the number of Hispanics enrolled in
college can be attributed to the combination of an increase in
the adult Hispanic population and their climbing likelihood of
being enrolled,” Julie Siebens, a statistician for the  Census
Bureau , said in a statement.  The study found that in 2012, 19.9 million students were in
college, including 5.8 million in two-year programs, 10.3
million in four-year colleges and 3.8 million in graduate
school.  The study, using data collected in the October 2012 Current
Population Survey, also examined enrollment at the elementary
level, beginning in nursery school.  In 2012, 78 million people, or 26.4 percent of the
population 3 or older, were enrolled in education.  To contact the reporter on this story:
