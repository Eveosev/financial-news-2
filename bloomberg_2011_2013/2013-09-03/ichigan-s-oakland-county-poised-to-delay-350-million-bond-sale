Michigan ’s Oakland County, which
borders  Detroit  to the north along 8 Mile Road, may delay a $350
million debt sale that was set for next week because officials
are behind schedule in assembling bond documents, Deputy
Executive Robert Daddow said.  The offering would be the biggest from the eighth-most-populous state since Detroit filed a record municipal bankruptcy
on July 18, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The county is
probably two weeks behind schedule and will determine tomorrow
if issuing the general-obligation bonds next week is feasible,
Daddow said.  At least three Michigan localities -- Genesee County,
Battle Creek and Saginaw County -- postponed bond sales after
Detroit’s Chapter 9 filing because interest rates were higher
than they were willing to pay. Oakland County, rated Aaa by
Moody’s Investors Service, would have issued its debt earlier if
possible, Daddow said in a telephone interview.  “It has nothing to do with Michigan -- it has everything
to do with the fact that this is a very complicated
transaction,” Daddow said. “We set an unrealistic target to
try to get the deal done before our year-end,” which is Sept.
30, he said.  Proceeds will refinance debt issued in 2007 for retiree
medical benefits. Oakland County’s deal is the largest since
Michigan’s State Building Authority issued $583 million during
the last week of June, Bloomberg data show.  Municipal interest rates are the highest since 2011 as
investors bet the Federal Reserve will scale back its bond
buying amid an expanding economy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
