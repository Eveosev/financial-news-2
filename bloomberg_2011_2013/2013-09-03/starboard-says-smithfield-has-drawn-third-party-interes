Starboard Value LP, a  Smithfield
Foods Inc. (SFD)  investor that’s advocating a breakup of the world’s
largest pork supplier, said it received interest from third
parties for the company’s individual assets.  Starboard is working with the parties, whom it didn’t
identify, to form an alternative to Shuanghui International
Holdings Ltd.’s $34-a-share offer, the investor said today in a
filing.  Starboard, which holds a 5.7 percent stake in the
Smithfield, Virginia-based meat processor, said it will vote its
shares against Shuanghui’s proposed $4.7 billion acquisition at
a Sept. 24 shareholder meeting.  To contact the reporter on this story:
