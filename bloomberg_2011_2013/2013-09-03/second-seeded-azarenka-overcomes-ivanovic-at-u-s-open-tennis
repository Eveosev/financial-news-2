Second-seeded Victoria Azarenka
rebounded from the loss of the first set and overcame nine
double faults to defeat former world No. 1 Ana Ivanovic today at
the  U.S. Open  and reach the quarterfinals.  Azarenka won 4-6, 6-3, 6-4 on her fourth match point and
advanced to a match against Slovakia’s Daniela Hantuchova, who
is unseeded.  Azarenka, 24, from Belarus, a reigning two-time Australian
Open champion, was runner-up to  Serena Williams  at last year’s
U.S. Open and is seen as the woman with the best chance of
dethroning Williams this year.  Ivanovic, 25, from Serbia, was the French Open champion and
moved atop the world rankings in 2008. Since then, she has made
only one Grand Slam quarterfinal -- last year at the U.S. Open.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
