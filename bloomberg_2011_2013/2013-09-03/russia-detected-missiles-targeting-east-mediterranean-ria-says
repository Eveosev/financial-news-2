Russia ’s missile tracking system detected the launch of two ballistic rockets in the central Mediterranean, state-run RIA Novosti reported. A second report said they landed in water.  The missile trajectory suggested the rockets were headed toward targets in the eastern Mediterranean, Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu was cited as telling President  Vladimir Putin  today, according to RIA. The missiles fell into water, RIA said, citing an unidentified person in Damascus.  European stocks declined after the report before later paring losses. Brent crude climbed after RIA’s report of the missile launch.  No one at the  Defense Ministry  picked up the phone when Bloomberg called. Russian Prime Minister  Dmitry Medvedev ’s spokeswoman, Natalya Timakova, told reporters near Moscow that Shoigu met Putin to inform him of the missile launch. Putin’s spokesman,  Dmitry Peskov , declined to comment.  The launch was detected by Russia’s radar station in Armavir at 10:16 a.m. Moscow time, according to RIA.  A French military adviser and government official both said they were unaware of a missile launch, declining to be identified because they were not authorized to comment. Israel, the U.K. and Russia’s embassy in Damascus had no information about the launch, according to RIA.  “I have nothing to confirm those reports whatsoever,” Pentagon spokesman Navy Commander William Speaks said by phone.
