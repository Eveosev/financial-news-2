U.K. prosecutors said they will
charge Daniel Evans, a former journalist at  News Corp. (NWSA) ’s News of
the World, with four offenses linked to phone-hacking and
bribery investigations.  Evans is also charged with perverting the course of
justice, the  Crown Prosecution Service  said in  statement  on its
website today. The charges are the first as part of a U.K police
investigation into the illegal interception of voicemail
messages in more than a year.  News Corp.’s U.K. newspapers are the focus of wide-ranging
investigations over the past three years that have uncovered
allegations of phone hacking and bribery. The News of the World
was closed by News Corp. in 2011 after revelations that the
tabloid had listened to messages on the phone of a murdered
school girl.  “There is sufficient evidence and it is in the public
interest to charge Daniel Evans with four offenses in connection
with the phone hacking investigations,” Gregor McGill, a lawyer
at the CPS, said in the statement.  Evans, originally arrested in August 2011, is scheduled to
appear at a London court tomorrow. A spokesman at  News Corp .’s
U.K. unit declined to immediately comment on the charges.  Trinity Mirror Plc tabloids were pulled into the U.K.
scandals in March when police arrested four journalists linked
to the newspaper, opening a new front in the investigation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
