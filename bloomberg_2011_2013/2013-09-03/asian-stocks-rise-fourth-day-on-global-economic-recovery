Asian stocks rose for a fourth day
as Japanese shares were boosted by the yen weakening against the
dollar and optimism that the global economy is recovering.  Nissan Motor Co. (7201)  climbed 3.2 percent as the yen touched a
one-month low against the dollar. Tokyo Electric Power Co.
gained 3.4 percent after the government said it may spend 47
billion yen ($473 million) to control radiation leaks at the
Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear plant.  Rio Tinto Group (RIO) , the world’s
second-biggest miner, led raw-material producers higher, rising
3.1 percent in Sydney after metals prices advanced.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index gained 1.3 percent to 132.69 at
7:44 p.m. in Hong Kong, as all 10 industry groups on the gauge
advanced. Almost three shares advanced for every one that
retreated. Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.8
percent before U.S. markets reopen following the Labor Day
public holiday.  “Markets have started the week in a positive frame of
mind,”  Mike Jones , a currency strategist in Wellington at Bank
of New Zealand Ltd., said by e-mail. “Manufacturing data out of
 China  and Europe essentially confirmed the global economy is on
the mend.”  A Chinese services industry index today confirmed the
world’s second-biggest economy is strengthening following a two-quarter slowdown, after a weekend report showed  manufacturing 
rose to a 16-month high. A euro-area manufacturing index
yesterday increased more than economists forecast.  Regional Gauges  Premier  Li Keqiang  said he’s confident China will achieve
its economic targets for this year, while Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. boosted its 2013 growth forecast for the nation to 7.6
percent from 7.4 percent. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index advanced 1
percent and China’s Shanghai Composite Index rose 1.2 percent.  Japan ’s  Topix index  gained 2.8 percent, the equity
benchmark’s biggest rally in a month. South Korea’s  Kospi index 
climbed 0.5 percent. Singapore’s Straits Times Index was little
changed and Taiwan’s Taiex added 0.6 percent. New Zealand’s NZX
50 Index advanced 0.2 percent.  Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index rose 0.2 percent to its
highest level in more than three months, with the nation’s
benchmark equities gauge maintaining gains after the central
bank kept its key  interest rate  at 2.5 percent.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index rose 1.3 percent this year
through yesterday, while the  S&P 500  surged 15 percent amid
concern the  Federal Reserve  will taper U.S. economic stimulus
this month.  Topix’s Performance  Japan’s Topix index has climbed 34 percent in 2013, the
best performing among 24 developed markets tracked by Bloomberg,
amid optimism Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and the  Bank of Japan 
can lead the country out of deflation through unprecedented
monetary easing and regulatory reforms.  Japanese exporters advanced as the yen weakened to as low
as 99.70 per dollar, boosting the value of overseas earnings
repatriated by the country’s companies. Nissan gained 3.2
percent to 1,012 yen and Toyota Motor Corp., Asia’s largest
carmaker, rose 3.3 percent to 6,200 yen. Mitsubishi Motors Corp.
surged 7.7 percent to 1,077 yen.  Raw-material producers climbed after the London Metal

metal, rose 2.1 percent to HK$15.52.  Radioactive Leaks  Tepco (9501) , as Tokyo Electric Power is known, rose 3.4 percent
to 525 yen. Steps to address radioactive water leaks at Tepco’s

earthquake and tsunami, may include constructing an underground
frozen wall to block groundwater from flowing into basements,
Trade and Industry Minister Toshimitsu Motegi said today.  Kansai Electric Power Co.  soared  8.1 percent to 1,217 yen
after a panel of seismologists and geologists said an earthquake

on a report the Japanese shipper ordered four new car carriers
worth about 30 billion yen.  Digital China Holdings Ltd. (861) , a distributor of technology
products, jumped 5.5 percent to HK$9.33 in  Hong Kong  after
receiving approval to spin off Digital China Information
