 Sugar rose for the first time in
five days in  New York  as premiums in the physical market signal
growing import demand. Cocoa also advanced.  Brazilian raw sugar for loading this month was at a premium
of 0.05 cent to 0.1 cent to the October futures in New York last
week, compared with 0.05 cent as of Aug. 1, Swiss Sugar Brokers
said in a report dated Aug. 31. About 700,000 metric tons of
sugar was sold in the past three weeks with Chinese and Middle
East refiners buying, the company said.  “The physical premiums are a little bit stronger, we’ve
seen very good demand,”  Jonathan Kingsman , managing director of
researcher Kingsman SA in Lausanne,  Switzerland , said by phone
today.  “Because of this strengthening of import demand it’s
beginning to look as if the surplus problem for 2013 is on its
way to being solved.”  Raw sugar for delivery in October advanced 0.7 percent to
16.45 cents a pound by 5:47 a.m. in New York on ICE Futures U.S.
White sugar for delivery the same month rose 0.2 percent to
$478.50 a ton on NYSE Liffe in London.  Sugar production will exceed demand by 4.5 million tons in
the 2013-14 season that starts in October, according to the
 International Sugar Organization  in London. That follows a
record surplus of 10 million tons in 2012-13.  Cocoa for December delivery rose 0.6 percent to $2,450 a
ton on ICE. Cocoa for delivery in December increased 0.6 percent
to 1,629 pounds ($2,538) a ton in  London , the first gain in four
days.  Arabica coffee for delivery in December climbed 0.6 percent
to $1.1695 a pound in New York. Robusta for November delivery
advanced 0.6 percent to $1,769 a ton in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
