AT&T Inc. (T)  won U.S. permission to buy
airwaves from  Verizon Wireless  for $1.9 billion, helping bolster
its high-speed data network in areas covering 42 million people.  The Federal Communications Commission said in an e-mailed
statement today it approved the deal, which brings the second-largest U.S. carrier more airwaves in 18 states, including
California, Texas, New York and Florida.  As part of the deal Verizon, based in Basking Ridge, New
Jersey, gets airwaves in cities including  Los Angeles  and
Phoenix from Dallas-based AT&T.  No. 1 Verizon is selling airwaves after acquiring other
frequencies in a deal last year with cable companies including
Comcast Corp. and  Time Warner Cable Inc. (TWC)   The FCC still is reviewing AT&T agreements to buy spectrum
and subscribers from  Atlantic Tele-Network Inc. (ATNI)  for $780 million
and to buy fifth-largest U.S. mobile carrier  Leap Wireless
International Inc. (LEAP)  for $1.2 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
