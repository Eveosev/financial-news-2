Eastern Water Resources Development (EASTW) 
and Management Pcl,  Thailand ’s largest private water provider,
plans to spend about 7.3 billion baht ($227 million) to expand
dams and pipelines to meet industrial and resort demands over
the next four years.  Demand for its raw and tap water will rise about 4 percent
annually from 2014 to 2017, Eastern Water Executive Vice
President Jaroensuk Worapansopak told an investor meeting today
in Bangkok. The company is also studying a 6 billion-baht
pipeline project to supply water from a reservoir in Surat Thani
province to resort areas in Phuket and Krabi, he said.  Eastern Water has boosted earnings from water sales as
demand climbs from manufacturers such as  PTT Pcl (PTT)  and Siam Cement
Pcl in Rayong province, the nation’s biggest industrial center.
Rising tourism visits to Pattaya beach resort in Chon Buri has
also increased sales of water, according to Jaroensuk.  To contact the reporter on this story:
