Palm oil  fell for the third time in
four days as the Malaysian currency strengthened, lowering the
appeal of ringgit-denominated futures, and a decline in crude
oil prices dimmed prospects of the vegetable oil as biofuel.  Palm for November delivery retreated 0.5 percent to 2,417
ringgit ($735) a metric ton on the Bursa Malaysia Derivatives.
Palm for physical delivery in September was at 2,440 ringgit
today, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  The ringgit rose to the highest level since Aug. 15 in
intraday trade after the government increased fuel prices and
pledged further subsidy cuts to help end 15 years of fiscal
deficits. West Texas Intermediate fell a third day after
President  Barack Obama  said he’ll seek approval from  U.S.
Congress  before taking military action in Syria, easing concern
that an imminent strike may disrupt Middle East oil exports.  “The ringgit has stopped weakening and slowed the momentum
in palm oil prices,” said Han Qiang Sim, an analyst at Phillip
Futures Pte. in Singapore. “When prices of crude oil start
tapering off, it also causes weakness in palm, which is used to
make the substitute biodiesel.”  Soybeans for November delivery jumped 3.4 percent to
$14.0325 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade. Soybean oil for
delivery in December gained 0.8 percent to 44.65 cents a pound.  Refined palm oil for January delivery slid 0.5 percent to
close at 5,624  yuan  ($919) a ton on the Dalian Commodity
Exchange.  Soybean oil  ended unchanged at 7,288 yuan a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
