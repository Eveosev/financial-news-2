National Water Co. plans to pump 10
million cubic meters (2.6 billion gallons) of water a day to the
Islamic holy city of Mecca and its surrounding sites during the
Hajj pilgrimage in October, it said on its  website .  In June, the  Saline Water Conversion Corp.  said it plans to
increase production of drinking water in Mecca by 29 percent to
a record 670,000 cubic meters a day to accommodate more pilgrims
to the city.  More than 10 million people visit the Grand Mosque in Mecca
every year and about 3 million attend the annual Hajj, a journey
each able-bodied Muslim is obliged to make.  To contact the reporter on this story:
