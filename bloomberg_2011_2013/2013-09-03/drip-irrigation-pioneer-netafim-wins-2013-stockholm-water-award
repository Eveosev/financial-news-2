Netafim, an Israeli provider of drip
and micro-irrigation technology that improves water, energy,
farm and labor productivity, today was awarded the 2013
Stockholm Industry Water Award.  Netafim, based in  Tel Aviv , started at Kibbutz Hatzerim in
the Negev desert in 1965 when members teamed with an engineer
who discovered a slow and balanced supply of water improves
plant growth. Agriculture is the world’s thirstiest industry,
accounting for 70 percent of global freshwater withdrawals.  Closely held Netafim has grown into a global seller of
smart drip and micro-irrigation products at a time when world
demand for water is expected to increase 55 percent to 2050, the
Stockholm International Water Institute said in a statement from
where it’s hosting World Water Week through Sept. 6.  “Given the world’s rapidly-growing population and
subsequent increase in demand for food and water over the next
few decades, drip will significantly contribute to fighting
water scarcity and improve  food security ,” Netafim Chief
Executive Officer Igal Aisenberg said on receiving the award.  To contact the reporter on this story:
