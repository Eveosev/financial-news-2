India ’s upper house of parliament
voted to approve the government’s landmark bill expanding the
world’s biggest food program to help feed the nation’s poor.  The law will give subsidized  grain  to two-thirds of India’s
1.2 billion citizens. The bill was passed through the lower
house of parliament last week and will now go to the president
for formal approval.  With the passage of the bill late last night, Prime
Minister  Manmohan Singh ’s Congress Party will have a defining
plank to woo rural voters after economic growth slowed to a
decade low. Weakened by corruption scandals and the loss of
allies, the Congress-led coalition has passed the fewest number
of bills ever by an administration sitting a five-year term.
Polls are due by May.  Singh has been betting on the passage of the bill to meet a
pledge to spread the benefits of growth to India’s poorest. The
plan involves spending about 1.25 trillion rupees ($19 billion)
in subsidies each year at a time when the government is running
budget and current-account deficits that pushed the rupee to a
record low last week.  The bill aims to reduce hunger in India where two decades
of economic growth has failed to dent malnutrition. More than
two-thirds of the population eats less than the minimum target
set by the government. The country has the highest percentage of
malnourished children in the world after  East Timor , according
to the 2012 annual Global Hunger Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
