The rand strengthened the most among
emerging-market currencies as evidence of a pickup in global
manufacturing boosts South Africa’s export prospects.  In the U.S., the  Institute for Supply Management  will
probably say factory output expanded a third month after gauges
from the U.K. to  China  showed manufacturing is reviving. South
Africa’s purchasing managers’ index rose, a report showed
yesterday, signaling an expansion in manufacturing growth as the
weaker rand makes  exports  more attractive.  “It really seems that the global economy is picking up
steam,”  John Cairns , a currency strategist at Rand Merchant
Bank in Johannesburg, said in e-mailed comments. “That South
Africa’s PMI actually jumped shows how the country has avoided
being caught up in the emerging-market problems.”  South Africa’s currency appreciated 0.3 percent to 10.2518
per dollar as of 8:47 a.m. in Johannesburg, the biggest gain
today among emerging-market currencies monitored by Bloomberg.
Yields on benchmark 10.5 percent bonds due December 2026 rose
five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 8.50 percent,
increasing for the first time in three days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
