The Ugandan shilling strengthened
the most in almost seven weeks after the central bank
unexpectedly raised its key lending rate for the first time
since 2011.  The currency advanced 0.7 percent to 2,575.5 per dollar by
4:30 p.m. in the capital, Kampala, the biggest gain since July
19 on a closing basis, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The Bank of  Uganda  increased its  policy rate  to 12 percent
from 11 percent, Governor Emmanuel Tumusiime-Mutebile told
reporters today in Kampala, the capital. Two economists surveyed
by Bloomberg forecast the rate would remain unchanged. It was
the first increase since November 2011.  “For a long time the Ugandan shilling was not getting the
respect it should have been given and this is partly a response
to that,”  Aly-Khan Satchu , chief executive officer of Rich
Management Ltd., a Nairobi-based adviser to companies and high
net-worth individuals, said by phone. “The shilling has more
room to strengthen.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
