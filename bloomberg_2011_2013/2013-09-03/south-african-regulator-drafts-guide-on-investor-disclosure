The Financial Services Board has
published for public comment  guidelines  on the distribution of
investor names and addresses, said Norman Muller, the South
African regulator’s head of  capital markets .  Following the introduction of the Financial Markets Act on
June 3,  Strate ,  South Africa ’s central securities depositary,
stopped publishing share ownership information that may have
been personal in order to avoid possible fines.  “Strate had always taken public information from company’s
registrars and disclosed that, but with the introduction of the
Financial Markets Act there were concerns that publishing this
would expose it to penalties,” Muller said by phone from
 Pretoria . “We saw that most of the information that they had is
public information, and so we have drafted guidelines that are
published on our website for public comment.”  The draft guidelines say that most share ownership
information can be disclosed by Strate to third parties such as
data vendors. Personal e-mail addresses and mobile phone numbers
may be two exceptions.  “Vendors can still get the public information, it just
meant that instead of going to a single source they would need
to go individually to all the different companies to get it,”
Muller said.  He does not expect public opposition to the guidelines and
sees Strate’s directive being amended within two weeks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
