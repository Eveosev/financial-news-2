Foreign ownership of Australian
 government securities  rose last quarter from a three-year low,
even as the nation’s currency plunged by the most in almost five
years.  Offshore holdings climbed to 69.1 percent of total
outstanding debt as of June 30, up from 68.3 percent three
months earlier, according to balance of payments data released
today. Foreign holdings peaked at a record 76.1 percent in June
2012.  The Australian dollar plunged 12 percent in the three
months through June, the most since the third quarter of 2008,
while the country’s government debt lost 0.1 percent, according
to Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data. U.S. Treasuries
declined 2.2 percent in the period.  “If you try and marry this data up with what happened in
the second quarter, you’d probably be a bit surprised that
offshore holdings weren’t lower,” said  Michael Turner , a debt
strategist at Royal Bank of Canada in Sydney. “There’s still
going to be an underlying bit of support for Aussie bonds, just
not to the degree that we saw previously.”  AAA Grades  Australian  government bonds  are among only 11 sovereign
markets with a AAA credit score from all three of the biggest
ratings companies. The benchmark  10-year (GACGB10)  yield was little
changed at 3.95 percent as of 12:48 p.m. in Sydney, or 1.13
percentage points more than the rate on similar-maturity
Treasuries.  Non-residents owned A$197.3 billion ($177 billion) of
government bonds and bills, down from A$204.3 billion at the end
of the prior quarter.  Total Australian government securities outstanding fell to
A$285.7 billion last quarter from A$299.3 billion on March 31,
government data showed. Foreign investors net purchases of
government notes totaled A$1.9 billion, while the amount
outstanding of such debt fell A$2.2 billion to A$280.2 billion.
Foreigners sold a net A$4.7 billion of bills as the government
cut short-term borrowings to A$5.5 billion from A$16.9 billion.  The Aussie dollar was little changed at 89.82 U.S. cents as
of 1:23 pm. in Sydney from yesterday, when it climbed 0.9
percent, the biggest one-day advance since Aug. 9. It slid to a
three-year low of 88.48 cents on Aug. 5 and has fallen 1.7
percent this quarter, the most among Group of 10 currencies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
