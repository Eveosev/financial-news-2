Ormat Industries Ltd.’s U.S.
geothermal-energy unit completed a 100-megawatt plant in  New
Zealand , the world’s largest using binary technology.  The Ngatamariki plant was built for Mighty River Power Ltd.
and produces enough energy for 80,000 homes, according to a
statement today from Reno, Nevada-based  Ormat Technologies Inc. (ORA)   Binary geothermal  plants tap underground pockets of hot
water or steam, which heat another liquid with a lower boiling
point. The secondary liquid expands into vapor and powers a
turbine while all the water is reinjected into the earth,
reducing emissions and minimizing consumption of the
subterranean resource.  Conventional  geothermal plants use the
underground steam to drive a turbine.  The Ngatamariki plant took about two years to build under a
$142 million engineering and construction contract.  Ormat Technologies rose 1.3 percent to $25.40 at the close
in  New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
