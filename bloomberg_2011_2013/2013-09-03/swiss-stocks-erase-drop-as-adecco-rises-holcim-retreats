Stocks in Switzerland  erased their
decline as investors awaited a U.S. manufacturing report.  Holcim Ltd. (HOLN)  retreated 1.3 percent after J&E Davy Holdings
Ltd. downgraded the world’s largest cement maker because it
generates much of its earnings in emerging-market currencies.  The  Swiss Market Index (SMI)  climbed 0.1 percent to 7,902.67 at
11:33 a.m. in Zurich, erasing a drop of as much as 0.5 percent.
The equity benchmark rallied 1.9 percent yesterday for its
biggest gain since July 4. The broader Swiss Performance Index
also increased 0.1 percent today.  “It’s a wait-and-see until U.S. ISM,” Christian Schmidt,
a market analyst at Helaba Landesbank Hessen-Thueringen in
Frankfurt, said. “Yesterday’s rally indicated that the U.S.
market will start the week with a positive tone.”  A report at 10 a.m.  New York  time may show that U.S.
manufacturing expanded in August. The Institute for Supply
Management’s  factory index  will post a reading of 54 for last
month, according to the  median forecast  of 80 economists in a
Bloomberg News survey. The gauge came in at 55.4 for July.
Readings above 50 mean that activity increased.  A report on Sept. 6 may show that U.S. employers added more
workers in August. Payrolls probably rose by 180,000 last month,
after adding 162,000 in July, according to the median forecast
of 77 economists in a Bloomberg News survey.  The  Federal Reserve  holds a policy meeting on Sept. 17-18
to decide whether to slow the pace of its bond-purchase program.
Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  has said that the central bank may
consider tapering if the employment outlook improves
substantially and the economy grows as forecast.  To contact the reporter on this story:
