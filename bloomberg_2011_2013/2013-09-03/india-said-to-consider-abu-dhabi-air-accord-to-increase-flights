India  approved an accord with  Abu
Dhabi  allowing carriers in the two countries to add flights.  The bilateral air services agreement with Abu Dhabi was
approved by the cabinet, Farooq Abdullah, federal minister for
renewable energy, told reporters in New Delhi today. The accord
will more than triple the number of seats carriers can sell on
flights between the two countries to about 50,000 per week
through 2015 from 13,300 a week now, two government officials
who were briefed on the matter said before the meeting.  The agreement will help Abu Dhabi-based Etihad Airways PJSC
increase services to India as it seeks to purchase a 24 percent
stake in  Jet Airways (India) Ltd. (JETIN)  to tap  travel demand  in a
market that’s set to become the world’s second-fastest growing
by 2016. An investment by Etihad will make it the first overseas
carrier to invest in an existing local carrier after India eased
ownership rules last year.  In April, Etihad  agreed to purchase  27.26 million Jet
shares for 20.6 billion rupees ($303 million). The deadline for
concluding the stake purchase has been extended to the end of
September from Aug. 31, as the carriers await Indian regulatory
approval including from the antitrust watchdog, a spokesperson
for the Abu Dhabi-based carrier said Sept. 1.  To contact the reporters on this story:
