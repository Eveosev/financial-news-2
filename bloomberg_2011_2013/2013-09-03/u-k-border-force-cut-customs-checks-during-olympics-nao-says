U.K. border staff cut immigration
queues during the 2012 London Olympics only by reducing customs
checks, auditors said.  Almost all people arriving from within  Europe  cleared
checks in 25 minutes and those arriving from other countries
passed security within 45 minutes, the National Audit Office
said in its report into U.K. Border Force, published today.  The NAO said it had been told this was achieved at the
expense of checks for illegal immigrants, and customs
inspections, with staff moved to the priority area of clearing
queues.  “The Border Force did well to reduce queuing times both
during and after the Olympics, but it is deeply worrying that
this came at the expense of its other responsibilities,
particularly customs,” opposition  Labour Party  lawmaker
 Margaret Hodge , chairwoman of Parliament’s Public Accounts
Committee, which scrutinizes NAO reports, said in an e-mailed
statement. “The Border Force must be able to check both goods
and passengers at the same time -- border security cannot be an
either or choice.”  Ahead of the games, lawmakers were told that nationwide
maximum waiting times for arrivals had been between 1 hour 55
minutes and 2 hours 55 minutes since June 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
