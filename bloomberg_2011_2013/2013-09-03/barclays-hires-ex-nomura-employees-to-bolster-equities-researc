Barclays Plc (BARC) , the U.K.’s second-largest bank by assets, said it appointed Jim McCormick to head
global asset-allocation research at its investment-banking unit.  McCormick, who previously worked as chief strategist at
Comac Capital LLP and global leader of macro strategy at  Nomura
Holdings Inc. (8604) , will report to Larry Kantor, head of research at
Barclays. The firm also hired  Ian Scott  as head of equity
strategy, Barclays said in a statement.  “We are delighted to have two incredibly talented
individuals join our team to help us enhance Barclays’ position
as a leader in cross-asset content,” Kantor said in the
statement. “We are confident we will be able to further enrich
the research offering that we provide to our clients.”  McCormick and Scott, who has 17 years of experience as a
strategist at Nomura and Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., will
work with regional strategy groups within the bank to provide
analysis, Barclays said. Both will be based in London.  The firm said yesterday that it hired former Morgan Stanley
Japan equity strategist Hajime Kitano, who was rated No. 1 in
Japan this year by Institutional Investor magazine, to bolster
research in the world’s best-performing major stock market.  To contact the reporter on this story:
