Turkish debt yields rose to the
highest in more than three years as government data showed  core
inflation  accelerated in August. The lira weakened as regional
tensions continued.  Yields on  10-year bonds  swelled as much as 29 basis points
to 10.33 percent, set for their highest level since June 2010,
and traded 22 basis points higher at 10.04 percent at 12:45 p.m.
in Istanbul. The lira depreciated 1.2 percent to 2.0449 per
dollar, extending its losses in the past month to 5.2 percent,
the most among major  emerging markets  in Europe, the  Middle East 
and Africa.  Consumer-price (TUCPIY)  gains ebbed to 8.17 percent last month from
8.88 percent in July, the highest level in almost a year,
according to data from the statistics office in Ankara today.
Core inflation accelerated to 6.37 percent from 6.09 percent in
the previous month.  “Core inflation looks bad and this spurred selling in
long-term maturities,” Bugra Bilgi, a hedge fund manager at
Garanti Asset Management in Istanbul, wrote in e-mailed
comments.  “The central bank said it would announce a plan and
there were people who were buying liras for that reason but
there has been no announcement,” Bilgi said.  Turkey’s central bank declared Sept. 9 an “extra
tightening” day, when it provides no funding at its cheapest
lending rate of 4.5 percent. It said it would sell a minimum
$100 million for liras that day. Governor Erdem Basci said last
week the central bank promised “surprise” tools to defend the
lira, which weakened to a record of 2.0730 per dollar on Aug.
28.  Russia detected missiles launched toward the eastern
Mediterranean, RIA Novosti reported, citing comments by Defense
Minister Sergei Shoigu to President  Vladimir Putin .  “It looks that there will not be a relaxation in the
 currency market ,” Onur Bayol, a trader at  Denizbank AS (DENIZ)  in
Istanbul, wrote in e-mailed comments. “The dollar is still
strong in the international markets and Syria risks are
continuing.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
