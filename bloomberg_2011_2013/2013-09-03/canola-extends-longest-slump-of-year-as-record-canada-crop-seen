Canola futures fell for a fifth
straight session, the longest slump this year, on mounting signs
that farmers will harvest a record crop before the season’s
first frost in  Canada , the world’s largest grower.  Production will jump 11 percent to 14.7 million metric
tons, topping the previous record of 14.6 million in 2011,
 Statistics Canada  said in a Aug. 21 survey of about 15,000
farmers. Early harvesting in  Saskatchewan , the biggest canola
grower, showed yields of 30 to 36 bushels an acre, the province
said.  Alberta  reported 17 percent of the crop collected, while
 Manitoba  said was 20 percent was harvested in the southwest.  “The anecdotal reports from various people are saying the
yields are quite phenomenal, and at the same time, some of it is
already getting into the bin, so some of the risk is coming
off,” Chuck Penner, the owner of LeftField Commodity Research,
said in a telephone interview from Winnipeg. “It’s just that
much closer to being safely in the bin.”  Canola futures for November settlement fell less than 0.1
percent to close at C$522.20 ($495.78) a ton at 1:47 p.m. on ICE
Futures Exchange in Winnipeg, capping the longest slump for a
most-active contract since Dec. 12. Prices are down 11 percent
this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
