The Met Office, the U.K.’s national
weather service, unveiled models to help water companies
predict the likelihood of leaks and burst pipes caused by
weather and better manage supplies.  The new tools will provide data to help predict when broken
pipes, leaks, demand surges or water cloudiness occur, it said
today in a statement.  Cold weather causes split pipes and increased leaks,
prompting repairs that can strain company resources. During
summer, water demand can vary by as much as 10 percent making it
difficult to manage reservoir levels, while heavy rain increases
particles in rivers, boosting treatment costs. The events are
typically more difficult to forecast because they’re driven by
weather, it said.  “Historically, burst, leakage, demand and turbidity have
been extremely difficult for water companies to predict
accurately across water networks and resource zones,” said
Michelle Spillar, head of utilities at the Met Office. “Our new
modeling suite enables water companies to perform day by day
network monitoring, forecast trends and analyze actual and
predicted future events.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
