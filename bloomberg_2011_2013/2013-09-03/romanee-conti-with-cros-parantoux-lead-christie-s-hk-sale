Three magnums of Romanee-Conti 1969
Domaine de la Romanee Conti fetched HK$427,000 ($55,100) at a
Christie’s International Plc auction in Hong Kong, matching the
estimate, as Burgundy accounted for four of the top five lots.  Ten bottles of Henri Jayer’s Vosne-Romanee Premier Cru 2001
Cros Parantoux also sold for the same amount at the auction on
Aug. 31, while a case of Petrus 1989 from Bordeaux’s Pomerol
region went for HK$317,200, according to a Christie’s statement.  The auction came as the Liv-ex Fine Wine 50 Index of top
Bordeaux vintages has risen 4 percent this year, with a drop
since mid-March erasing half of its gain of 8 percent in the
first 10 weeks of the year. While the index edged up in August
after four straight months of declines, investor appetite at
auctions has been driven primarily by older Burgundy vintages
while demand for Bordeaux has been inconsistent.  Bordeaux first growths “provided much of the impetus for
the market’s decline” seen earlier in the summer, Liv-ex said in
a recent market commentary, and in a separate note described
left-bank Bordeaux growers as “out of fashion” while noting that
in other regions “the wine market is thriving.”  Other leading Burgundies in the sale included three bottles
of Romanee-Conti Grand Cru 2003, which fetched HK$317,200, two
bottles of the same producer’s 2007 vintage, which sold for
HK$158,600 and eight bottles of Montrachet Grand Cru 1990, which
attained HK$268,400.  Saint-Emilion  Top Bordeaux in the auction included a case of Petrus 1989,
which sold for HK$317,200, and 12 bottles of the same producer’s
1990 vintage, which fetched HK$292,800. A three-bottle lot of
Chateau Cheval Blanc 1947 Saint-Emilion sold for HK$268,400,
according to the Christie’s online results.  The Romanee-Conti vineyard in Vosne-Romanee is slightly
smaller than 2 hectares (5 acres) and has its own appellation as
a Burgundy grand cru wine. Jayer’s Cros Parantoux, from a 2.5-acre premier cru vineyard that was an artichoke field in World
War II, has also acquired trophy status.  The sale, with 97 percent of the lots sold by value and 96
percent by lots, raised a total of HK$29.8 million.  Following is a table of major wine auctions held so far
