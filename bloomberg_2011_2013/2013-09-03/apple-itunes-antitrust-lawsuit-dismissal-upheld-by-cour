Apple Inc. (AAPL)  doesn’t have to face an
antitrust lawsuit by customers who accused it of maintaining a
monopoly over music downloading through its iTunes stores, a
federal appeals court ruled.  The  U.S. Court of Appeals  in San Francisco in a ruling
today upheld a lower-lower court judge’s dismissal of the case.
The customers claimed in the suit that Apple tried to block
competition and charge more by preventing users from playing
some iTunes music on non-Apple devices.  Apple’s downloaded song prices remained the same even after
competitors entered the market, the appeals panel said.  Last month Apple won dismissal of a separate lawsuit
claiming the Cupertino, California-based  company  maintains a
monopoly over iPhone applications.  In another antitrust case filed by the U.S. government in
federal court in  New York , Apple was found liable in July for
fixing e-book prices.  The federal judge presiding over the e-book case in
Manhattan said Aug. 27 she plans to limit the remedies sought by
the U.S. government. U.S. District Judge Denise Cote ruled in
July that Apple, the maker of the iPod table computer, helped
coordinate a conspiracy with five book publishers to limit
retail price competition and raise e-book prices.  The case is Stacie Somers v. Apple, 11-16896, U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ( San Francisco ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
