Spanish  unemployment  was little
changed in August, stabilizing for the first time during that
month since 2000, as Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy  predicts an
economic recovery later this year.  The number of people registering for jobless benefits fell
by 31 from July, leaving claims at 4.7 million, the Labor
Ministry in  Madrid  said today in an e-mailed statement.
Economists forecast an increase of 7,500, according to the
median of four forecasts in a Bloomberg News  survey .  While Spain’s  current-account  surplus increased in June and
the number of tourist visits through July was the highest for
that period since at least 2000, the country still contributes
close to a third to all jobless people in the euro area.
Unemployment in the 17-nation region held at a record 12.1
percent in July and stood at 26.3 percent in  Spain .  “There are positive elements in leading indicators,” said
Economy Minister Luis de Guindos said in an interview with radio
Cadena Ser in Madrid today. “Light is starting to appear at the
end of the tunnel.”  The government maintains its forecast of an economic
contraction of 1.3 percent for the full year after a two-year
 recession  eased in the second quarter, Deputy Economy Minister
Fernando Jimenez Latorre said last week. Growth will be flat or
may reach 0.2 percent in the third and fourth quarters, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
