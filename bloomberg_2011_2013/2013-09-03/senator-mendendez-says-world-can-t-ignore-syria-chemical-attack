The world can’t ignore the
“horror” of Syria’s chemical weapons attack, Senate Foreign
Relations Committee Chairman Bob Menendez said at the start of a
hearing on President  Barack Obama ’s bid for congressional
authorization of military action against that country.  Secretary of State  John Kerry , Secretary of Defense
Chuck Hagel and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Martin Dempsey
will testify before the panel, in the first hearing on using
force in Syria.  “Today I support the president’s decision to use military
force in the face of this horrific crime against humanity,”
Menendez, a New Jersey Democrat, said at the start of the
hearing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
