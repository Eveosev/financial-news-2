China ’s one-year interest rate swap
fell to the lowest level in almost a week as the central bank
added funds to the financial system via open-market operations.  The People’s Bank of China issued 10 billion  yuan  ($1.6
billion) of seven-day reverse-repurchase agreements at 3.9
percent today, according to a statement posted on its website.
The monetary authority added a net 41.5 billion yuan to the
market in the week ended Aug. 29. Chinese financial markets will
be closed on Sept. 19-20 for the mid-Autumn festival and Oct. 1-7 for the National Day holidays.  “The regular reverse-repo operations in recent weeks have
helped to stabilize market expectations,” said Xu Hanfei, an
analyst at Guotai Junan Securities Co. in Shanghai. “The main
risks this month will be in the second half when the public
holidays and quarter-end factors will play a role.”  The one-year swap contract, the fixed payment to receive
the floating seven-day repo rate, dropped two basis points, or
0.02 percentage point, to 4.13 percent as of 10:32 a.m. in
 Shanghai , data compiled by Bloomberg show. It touched 4.08
percent earlier, the lowest level since Aug. 28.  The  seven-day repurchase rate , a gauge of cash availability
in the banking system, was little changed at 3.75 percent,
according to a weighted average compiled by the National
Interbank Funding Center.  China’s official non-manufacturing purchasing managers’
index fell to 53.9 in August from 54.1 in July, the statistics
bureau said today. Fifty is the dividing line between
contraction and expansion. New local-currency loans in August
may be about 780 billion yuan, the Economic Information Daily
reported today, citing an unidentified person from the banking
industry. That compares with 700 billion yuan in July,
government data show.  The yield on the government’s 4.08 percent bonds due August
2023 was steady at 4.07 percent, according to the Interbank
Funding Center.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
