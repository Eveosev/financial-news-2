The Hong Kong government is seeking
comments on a proposal for developers to help build subsidized
public housing, as the city tussles with record home prices.  The public consultation will be conducted over the next
three months, Anthony Cheung, secretary for transport and
housing, told reporters yesterday in Hong Kong. The proposal is
one of the recommendations made by a committee studying the
city’s long-term housing plan.  Hong Kong’s  home prices  have more than doubled since early
2009 to a record, raising concerns of an asset bubble and
stoking public discontent. The government is seeking to increase
supply and curb demands with measures including extra taxes on
foreign buyers and property investors.  Leung Chun-ying, who took over as Hong Kong’s leader in
July 2012, this year restarted the sale of subsidized public
housing, a program that was halted in 2004.  The committee is recommending the building of 470,000 new
homes over the next decade, Cheung said. About 60 percent of the
new supply should be public housing, he added.  To contact the reporters on this story:
