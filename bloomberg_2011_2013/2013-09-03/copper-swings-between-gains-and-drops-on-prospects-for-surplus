Copper swung between gains and
declines in  London  as investors weighed signs of recovering
economies against prospects for supply to swamp demand.  A euro-area manufacturing index released yesterday gained
more than economists forecast and a similar measure for  China ,
the world’s biggest copper consumer, published Sept. 1 reached a
16-month high. Copper production will exceed usage by 408,000
metric tons next year, the most since 2001, the average of 15
analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg showed.  “The Chinese figures have been improving,” Richard Fu,
director for Asia commodity trading at Newedge Group SA in
London, said by e-mail. “Supply is catching up.”  Copper for delivery in three months slipped 0.1 percent to
$7,229 a ton by 9:40 a.m. on the London Metal Exchange after
gaining as much as 0.6 percent and retreating as much as 0.3
percent. Copper for delivery in December rose 1.8 percent to
$3.2925 a pound on the Comex in  New York , where floor trading
was shut yesterday for the Labor Day holiday.  The  Institute for Supply Management ’s U.S.  factory index 
fell to 54 in August, economists said before the gauge is
published today. The nation is the second-largest copper user.
Figures due Sept. 6 will show employers in the U.S. hired more
workers last month than in July, according to estimates.  “The market is consolidating higher while waiting for U.S.
nonfarm payrolls,” Fu said. While metals reacted to Chinese and
U.S. figures,  Europe  is “stabilizing as well,” he said.  Copper stockpiles monitored by the LME increased 2.2
percent, the most since June 21, to 602,850 tons, daily exchange
figures showed. Orders to remove the metal from warehouses
dropped 0.2 percent to 283,600 tons.  Lead, nickel, zinc and aluminum fell in London. Tin rose.  To contact the reporter on this story:
