A dispute over  Kumba Iron Ore Ltd. (KIO) ’s
Sishen mine returned to South African courts as the state seeks
to overturn rulings preventing it granting a prospecting permit
to a company held by business partners of the president’s son.  The Department of Mineral Resources and Imperial Crown
Trading 289 (Pty) Ltd. argue the award of all rights in Africa’s
biggest iron-ore mine to Sishen Iron Ore, a unit of  Anglo
American Plc (AAL) ’s Kumba, was a mistake that can be rectified,
according to the Constitutional Court, the nation’s highest.  “Applicants argue that the matter raises a constitutional
issue since it relates to the interpretation of legislation
giving effect to the transformative objectives” of mining
legislation, the court said today in an explanatory note.  Sishen Iron Ore argues that the dispute is commercial and
doesn’t raise constitutional issues, the court said.  The  Supreme Court  of Appeal in March upheld a 2011 ruling
that overturned the award of a prospecting permit to Imperial,
which has owners including a business partner of South African
President  Jacob Zuma ’s son, Duduzane.  The Constitutional Court heard arguments from all parties
and has yet to say when it will announce its judgment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
