Africa-Israel Investments Ltd. (AFIL)  fell
to the lowest level in almost a year after Globes business daily
reported that the real estate company owned by businessman Lev Leviev may need to restructure obligations in 2014.  The  shares  of the company, which in 2010 agreed to a 7.5
billion-shekel ($2.1 billion) debt restructuring and has 49
percent of its assets in the former Soviet Union, dropped 4.2
percent to 6.124 shekels, the lowest level since Sept. 20, at
1:52 p.m. in Tel Aviv. The stock has declined this year by 17
percent as the benchmark TA-25 Index has decreased 0.5 percent.
The gauge fell 0.9 percent today.  Africa-Israel may need to restructure obligations in 2014,
Globes reported, citing an interview with Chief Executive
Officer Avraham Noach Novogrocki, who said the company must
“act decisively” to meet these payments.  “The article may have created a negative echo around the
share,” Shai Azar, a real estate analyst at I.B.I-Israel
Brokerage & Investments in Tel Aviv, said by phone. If the
company doesn’t sell a significant asset in  Russia  to meet
payments in 2014, “then it will be more difficult to repay debt
and the company will have to depend on the sale of U.S. assets
and the issue of rights,” he said.  The holding company faces debt payments to bondholders and
banks of 531 million shekels in 2014 and of 596 million shekels
in 2015, according to an investor presentation filed to the Tel-Aviv Stock Exchange on Aug. 27. The company has been selling
assets and offering rights to meet obligations. Africa said in
August it will sell a Los Angeles asset for $37.5 million. In
April the company said it plans a 219 million-shekels rights
offering.  Africa-Israel said it continues to develop new projects as
it sells assets to boost company value and increase cash flow
for use in the coming years, according to an e-mailed statement
to Bloomberg today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
