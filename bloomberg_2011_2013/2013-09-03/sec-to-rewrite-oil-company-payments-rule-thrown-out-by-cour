The U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission will rewrite a rule mandating disclosure of payments
by oil and gas companies to foreign governments after a federal
judge voided an earlier version.  In moving to redraft the rule, the commission decided
against appealing U.S. District Judge John Bates’s July 2
opinion, which found the regulation wasn’t consistent with
Congress’ directions. Required under the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act,
the provision was aimed at enhancing the transparency of
payments between oil and gas producers and resource-rich
countries.  The SEC will re-propose the rule in a manner “informed by
the court’s decision,”  John Nester , an SEC spokesman, said
today. He said there was no schedule for issuing a new proposal.  The commission approved the rule in August 2012. It was
challenged in court by the American Petroleum Institute, which
lobbies for oil and gas producers, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce,
and two other trade groups.  In rejecting the rule, Bates wrote the SEC erred in
deciding that payment-disclosure forms filed by individual
companies must be made public. The judge also faulted the SEC
for rejecting an exemption from disclosure for payments to
countries that don’t permit the release of the information.  To contact the reporter on this story:
