Copper swung between gains and
losses as investors weighed signs of economic recovery from
China to  Europe  against prospects for reduced U.S. stimulus.  Metal for delivery in three months on the London Metal
Exchange was little changed at $7,233 a metric ton at 3:59 p.m.
in Tokyo after losing 0.4 percent and gaining 0.7 percent. The
price rose 1.9 percent yesterday, the most since Aug. 8.  A euro-area manufacturing index increased more than
economists forecast, while a weekend report showed manufacturing
in China, the world’s biggest consumer of metals, expanded last
month to a 16-month high. The U.S. Federal Reserve will cut
stimulus at its next meeting on Sept. 17-18, according to 65
percent of economists in a survey last month. A report today may
show U.S. factory output expanded in August.  “After the good manufacturing data from  China  and Europe
yesterday, the market is focusing on when the Fed will start to
taper quantitative easing,” said Chae Un Soo, a metals trader
at Korea Exchange Bank Futures Co. in  Seoul .  The  Institute for Supply Management ’s U.S.  factory index  is
estimated at 54 in August, compared with a two-year high of 55.4
in July, economists forecast before the release of the data
today.  Futures for delivery in December on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange fell 0.3 percent to close at 52,360  yuan  ($8,555) a
ton. Metal for delivery in December on the Comex in New York
rose 1.8 percent compared with Aug. 30 to $3.291 a pound. There
was a Labor Day holiday yesterday in the U.S.  On the LME, lead, tin, nickel and aluminum dropped, while
zinc was little changed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
