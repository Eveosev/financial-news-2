Ethanol’s discount to gasoline
narrowed on speculation production of the biofuel will drop
lower than levels already seasonally below-average before this
year’s corn harvest.  The spread, or price difference, tightened 0.92 cents to
89.99 cents a gallon at 11:54 a.m.  New York  time as yesterday’s
U.S. Labor Day holiday marked the end of the nation’s summer
driving season. Ethanol is blended with gasoline to stretch
supply and meet federal mandates.  “Ethanol production will probably drift a little lower,”
said Mike Blackford, a consultant at INTL FCStone Group in  Des
Moines ,  Iowa .  Denatured ethanol for October delivery fell 1.3 cents, or
0.7 percent, to $1.968 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade.
The September contract, which expires Sept. 5, rose 10.5 cents
to $2.498.  Gasoline for October delivery decreased 2.22 cents, or 0.8
percent, to $2.8679 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The contract covers reformulated gasoline, made to be
blended with ethanol before delivery to filling stations.  The October ethanol contract was trading at a 17.3-cent
premium to November delivery, a phenomenon known as
backwardation, where prompt prices are higher than later ones.  “The backwardation is very steep and that means user
groups won’t buy until they absolutely have to,” Blackford
said.  Fuel Stockpiles  Ethanol  inventories  dropped to 16.3 million barrels in the
week ended Aug. 23, according to data from the Energy
Information Administration.  Production fell 2.8 percent to 820,000 barrels a day last
week, the least since March 29, the EIA, Energy Department’s
statistical arm, said Aug. 28. That’s near  record-low levels  for
this time of year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  A 2007 energy law requires refiners to use 13.8 billion
gallons of ethanol this year and 14.4 billion in 2014.
Compliance is tracked by Renewable Identification Numbers,
 certificates  attached to each gallon of ethanol that are
submitted to the government each year and that also can be
traded among companies.  Corn-based ethanol RINs  were unchanged at 69 cents, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. Advanced RINs, which cover biodiesel
and Brazilian sugarcane-based ethanol, were unchanged at 74
cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
