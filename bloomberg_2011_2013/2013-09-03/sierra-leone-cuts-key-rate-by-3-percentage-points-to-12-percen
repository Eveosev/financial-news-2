Sierra Leone ’s central bank lowered
its policy rate to 12 percent from 15 percent to help support
growth in sub-Saharan Africa’s second-fastest growing economy.  The reverse repurchase rate was set at 12.5 percent and the
standing facility rate at 13 percent, according to a statement
distributed to reporters today in the capital, Freetown.
Monetary policy makers took the decision at a meeting on Aug.
29, according to the  Bank of Sierra Leone  statement.  The West African economy is forecast by the  International
Monetary Fund  to expand 17.1 percent this year from 19.8 percent
last year. South Sudan, at 32.1 percent, is the only  country  in
sub-Saharan African with quicker economic growth expected in
2013.  South Sudan  resumed oil production this year after a 14-month shutdown in a dispute with Sudan over transit feeds.  The value of Sierra Leone’s diamond exports in the seven
months through July rose 18 percent to $107 million, while the
country sold 10.5 million metric tons of  iron ore  in the first
half, according to the central bank’s statement. Sierra Leone’s
central bank forecasts 13.3 percent growth in 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
