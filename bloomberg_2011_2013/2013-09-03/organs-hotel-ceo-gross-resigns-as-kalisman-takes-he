Morgans Hotel Group Co. (MHGC) , the
operator of boutique brands including the Mondrian and Delano,
said  Michael Gross  resigned as chief executive officer after its
largest shareholder led an ouster of the board.  Jason Kalisman, the company’s chairman, will take over as
interim CEO, New York-based Morgans said in a regulatory filing
today. He is a founder of OTK Associates LLC, which earlier this
year campaigned to add seven directors to the board. Investors
voted in June to elect all of the nominees.  Gross, who had been CEO since 2011, will “pursue new
opportunities,” Morgans said in the filing.  OTK, owner of about 14 percent of Morgans’s  shares , led the
board push to try to return the company to profitability.
Morgans, which operates hotels including the Mondrian in  Los
Angeles  and the Delano in Miami’s South Beach, has  lost money 
each quarter since 2007, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Kalisman, 34, a director of Morgans since March 2011, is
also the founder and chief executive of Talisman Group LLC, an
 investment company . He will receive $1 in annual compensation as
interim chief executive, according to the filing.  Gross will be paid in part a lump sum of $500,000, a grant
of 58,334 restricted stock units, and 25,000 additional shares
that will vest a year from his departure date of Aug. 30.  Morgans rose 1 percent to $6.94 at 10:16 a.m.  New York 
time. The  stock  has advanced 25 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
