Gasoline advanced to a 33-month
high as the dollar weakened and U.S. inventories are at a five-
month low near the beginning of peak driving season.  Gasoline supplies have declined 14 percent since Feb. 11,
according to Energy Department data. Refinery rates were 3.43
percentage points below a year earlier in the week ended April
15. Peak driving season in the U.S. traditionally starts on the
Memorial Day holiday, which is May 30 this year.  “The longer they keep utilization rates down, that will
deplete gasoline stocks,” said  Gene McGillian , an analyst and
broker at Tradition Energy in Stamford, Connecticut.  Gasoline for May delivery rose 1.95 cents, or 0.6 percent,
to $3.3281 a gallon at 9:30 a.m. on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . Prices touched $3.3416, the highest intraday price for
the front-month contract since July 16, 2008.  Futures also gained as oil rose on concern that political
violence during Nigerian elections threatens to disrupt oil
output in Africa’s largest producer. Nigeria’s crude is low-
sulfur, similar to the grade used by some East Coast refineries.  At least 600 people were killed in violence between Muslim
and Christian ethnic groups in Nigeria, triggered by opposition
protests against President Goodluck Jonathan’s victory in the
April 16 election, a local civic group said.  The dollar fell a fifth day against the euro, losing 0.3
percent as of 9:13 a.m. in  New York .  “The whole market is up on election violence in Nigeria
and the dollar weakness is continuing,” said  Andy Lipow ,
president of Lipow Oil Associates LLC in Houston.  Brent crude  for June settlement added 40 cents to $124.39 a
barrel on  London ’s ICE Futures Europe exchange. Nymex June-
delivery crude rose 75 cents to $113.04 a barrel.  Regular retail gasoline rose 0.3 cent to $3.863 a gallon
yesterday, AAA said on its website. That’s the highest price
since Aug. 4, 2008.  Heating oil for May delivery slipped 0.2 cent to $3.1972 a
gallon on the exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
