Press Release  Bloomberg Businessweek Cover story on “Ireland Underwater” Named
One of the Top 10 Magazine Covers of the Year  New York -- Adweek today named Bloomberg Businessweek one of the
10 most successful and influential magazines of the year and it
named the magazine’s “Ireland Underwater” one of the top 10
covers of the year.  Adweek’s “Hot List” ranking of magazines
was based on financial performance metrics including advertising
revenue, newsstand sales, and overall circulation growth along
with influence measurement derived from evaluating each
magazine’s social media footprint, press impressions, and search
engine results.  Bloomberg Businessweek’s “smart and original” redesign and its
circulation and advertising growth were cited by Adweek as
reasons it made the Hot List of top magazines.  Adweek reported
that Bloomberg Businessweek’s “individually paid subscriptions
rose 7 percent in the latter half of last year, while ad pages
jumped 49 percent in the first quarter of this year.”  “This recognition is a testament to the truly remarkable
progress Businessweek has made as part of the Bloomberg family,”
said Bloomberg Businessweek President Paul Bascobert. “We have
invested in the magazine, opening new sales offices, hiring top
talent, and adding new products and platforms to offer
advertisers engaging ways to reach our audience. We are just
beginning to hit our stride and expect much more to come in 2011
and beyond.”  In April 2010, Bloomberg Businessweek relaunched with a new
design and a complete rethinking of the newsweekly format. The
magazine has increased the number of issues it publishes each
year from 47 to 50 and increased the number of editorial pages
by 20%. This month the magazine launched its new iPad app called
Bloomberg Businessweek+, the first app from a major business
publication to use Apple Inc.’s subscription offering.  The app
received positive reviews from key digital media and technology
blogs including Mashable who wrote that the app was “a truly
grade-A experience in the digital magazine category.”  About Bloomberg Businessweek  Bloomberg Businessweek is a trusted source of essential,
