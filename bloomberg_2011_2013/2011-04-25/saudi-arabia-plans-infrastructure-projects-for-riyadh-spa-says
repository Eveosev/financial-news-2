Saudi Arabia  plans to implement
about 100 projects in the Riyadh region in the next 20 years as
rising oil prices spur spending on infrastructure by the Arab
world’s largest economy, the  Saudi Press Agency  reported.  Projects include a light rail, public bus system, and two
additional belt roads, the news service said, citing Ibrahim Al
Sultan, acting chairman of the projects and planning center at
 Ar-Riyadh Development Authority .  The Riyadh region, which had a population of 4.8 million at
the end of 2009, needs to create 770,000 jobs for Saudi
nationals and build 550,000 housing units by 2028, the news
service said, citing the authority’s updated plan.  The belt roads will be 120 kilometers (193 miles) and 150
kilometers long. The Saudi capital also plans to build a 1,447
kilometer-long floodwater drainage system and expand its
sanitary water network by 3,755 kilometers, SPA said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
