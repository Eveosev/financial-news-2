The Philippine peso and bonds
gained on speculation the U.S. Federal Reserve will keep
 interest rates  near zero this week, encouraging investors to buy
emerging-market assets.  The currency climbed to its strongest level in more than a
week as the Philippine Stock Exchange Composite Index rose 1.3
percent, following gains in the U.S. stock market. The  Federal
Open Market Committee  announces its policy decision on April 27
and will hold the benchmark rate in a range of zero to 0.25
percent, according to all 80 economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  “The movement is mostly related to the weaker dollar and
the positive sentiment in the equities market,” said Lito Biacora, vice president for treasury at Bank of the Philippine
Islands in Manila.  The peso appreciated 0.2 percent to 43.185 per dollar at
the 4 p.m. close in  Manila , according to prices from inter-
dealer broker Tullett Prebon Plc. The currency earlier touched
43.162, the highest level since April 15. Financial markets were
closed April 21 and 22 for the Easter holidays.  The Dollar Index, which IntercontinentalExchange Inc. uses
to track the dollar versus the currencies of six major U.S.
trading partners, was at 74.023, after touching 73.735 on April
21, the lowest since August 2008.  Philippine four-year bonds advanced, with the yield on the
8.375 percent note due May 2015 falling 7.5 basis points, or
0.075 percentage point, to 5.3 percent, according to Tradition
Financial Services. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter for this story:
