A  Magellan Midstream Partners LP (MMP) 
diesel pipeline in Lawrence County, Missouri, is “operating
normally” after a false alarm about a leak, according to Bruce Heine, a company spokesman.  A “potential release” of 3,000 barrels of diesel from a
pipeline was reported in a filing to the National Response
Center on April 22.  “This was a false alarm,” Heine, based in Tulsa,
 Oklahoma , said in an e-mail today.  U.S. refineries must notify the NRC if they release
hazardous substances in excess of reportable quantities,
according to the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation and Liability Act, commonly known as Superfund.  To contact the reporter on this story:
