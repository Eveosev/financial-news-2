Shares of the following companies
had unusual moves in Malaysia trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of the 5 p.m. close in Kuala
Lumpur.  The  FTSE Bursa Malaysia KLCI (FBMKLCI)  Index rose 1.30, or 0.1
percent, to 1,524.05, its first gain in three days.       Eupe Corp. (EUPE MK), a property developer, added 3.9
percent to 53 sen, the largest gain since April 1, after profit
in the fourth quarter ended Feb. 28 climbed 22 percent from a
year earlier to 2.62 million ringgit ($880,000).  Iris Corp. (ICB MK), a supplier of smart cards, jumped 11
percent to 21 sen, its highest close since Feb. 16. Iris
received a $150 million contract from the Tanzanian government
to provide national  identity cards , according to a company
statement.       Pos Malaysia Bhd. (POSM)   dropped 4.2 percent to 3.23
ringgit, the most since Sept. 28, 2009, after OSK Research Sdn.
said  DRB-Hicom Bhd. (DRB) ’s winning bid for a stake in the
postal company was “unattractive.” The purchase price of 3.60
ringgit a share represents only a 7 percent premium to Friday’s
closing price and it doesn’t “adequately” reflect the value of
Pos’s land bank, OSK said in a report today.  Ranhill Bhd. (RANH)  , a construction group, climbed 0.7
percent to 75.5 sen, its highest level since April 18, after
saying its Ranhill Power Sdn. unit will sell as much as 800
million ringgit of government-back Islamic bonds.  To contact the reporters on this story:
