Vietnam , the worldâ€™s second-largest
rice exporter, shipped 2.2 million metric tons from the start of
the year to April 21, the  Vietnam Food Association  said.  Shipments were 351,511 tons between April 1 and April 21,
the association said in a statement on its website today,
without giving comparisons with a year ago.  Vietnam may ship as much as 7.4 million tons in 2011, the
