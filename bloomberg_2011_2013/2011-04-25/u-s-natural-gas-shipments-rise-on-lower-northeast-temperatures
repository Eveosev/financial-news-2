Scheduled natural gas deliveries to
U.S. power generators rose for a second day as shipments to the
northeastern U.S. increased on forecasts of lower temperatures
that may boost heating demand.  Shipments to electricity generators in the Northeast rose
17 percent to 1.67 million dekatherms (1.63 billion cubic feet),
according to data compiled by Bloomberg as of 9:30 a.m. in  New
York . A sample of scheduled deliveries to power plants in the
U.S. and Canada shows shipments rose 6 percent to 13.7 million
dekatherms.  Scheduled shipments for U.S. residences fell 3.3 percent to
25.7 million dekatherms, the fourth consecutive decline.
Shipments have tumbled 54 percent since peaking at 56.4 million
dekatherms on Feb. 9.  High temperatures in Boston today are expected to hit 54
degrees Fahrenheit (12 Celsius), 9 degrees below normal,
according to  Weather Underground  in  Ann Arbor , Michigan. They
may rise to 68 degrees tomorrow, the forecaster said.  Wholesale gas at the Tetco M3 hub, where gas is delivered
to New York, New Jersey and Massachusetts, fell 11.04 cents, or
2.4 percent, to $4.5475 per million British thermal units on
April 21 on the Intercontinental Exchange.  Gas at the  Henry Hub  in Erath, Louisiana, the delivery
point for futures traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange ,
fell 0.23 cent on April 21 to $4.3319 per million Btu.  To contact the reporter on this story:
