Taiwan’s dollar traded near a two-
month high on speculation global funds will add to holdings of
the island’s higher-yielding assets as the  Federal Reserve  keeps
interest rates near zero.  The currency has gained 1.7 percent this month as global
funds bought $2.2 billion more Taiwanese shares than they sold
during the period, exchange data show. The U.S. Federal Open
Market Committee will hold its benchmark rate in a range of zero
to 0.25 percent when it meets on April 27, according to all 80
economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  “There’s anticipated continued dovishness from the Federal
Reserve,” said  David Cohen , a Singapore-based economist at
Action Economics LLC. “That will continue to be a drag on the
dollar and thus Asian currencies have been strengthening.”  Taiwan’s dollar was unchanged at NT$28.930 against its U.S.
counterpart as of the 4 p.m. local close, according to Taipei
Forex Inc. The currency touched NT$28.860 on April 22, the
strongest level since Feb. 10.  Taiwan  boosted its benchmark interest rate by 12.5 basis
points to 1.75 percent last month, contributing to the
currency’s 5 percent gain this year, the best performance among
 Asia ’s 10 most-traded currencies.  Government bonds  were little changed. The yield on the 1
percent note due January 2016, the most-active government
security, was 1.076 percent, from 1.079 percent last week,
according to Gretai Securities Market.  To contact the reporter on this story:
