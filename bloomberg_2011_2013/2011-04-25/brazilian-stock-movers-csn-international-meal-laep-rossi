said it increased its stake in rival  Usinas Siderurgicas de

percent to 17.53 reais.  International Meal Co. Holdings SA (IMCH3 BS), the operator
of  restaurant chains , gained 0.9 percent to 15.34 reais after it
was rated “buy” in new coverage at Banco Santander SA. The

shares have tumbled 32 percent since the end of March.        Rossi Residencial SA (RSID3)  (RSID3 BS), Brazil’s sixth-largest

majority of analysts survey by Bloomberg, signaling that the
bank may not be finished with tightening credit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
