Treasuries gained before the
 Federal Reserve  opens a two-day meeting tomorrow.  Six-month bill rates dropped earlier to a record as some
investors sought the relative safety of U.S. securities because
of speculation Greece will restructure its debt. Fed policy
makers meet as their Treasuries purchase program, the second
round in a strategy called quantitative easing, approaches its
scheduled end in June.  “It’s very uncertain times,” said  Thomas Roth , senior
Treasury trader in New York at Mitsubishi UFJ Securities USA
Inc. “After QE2, when they pull the lifeline, half the world
thinks we’ll go into depression and lose the gains we made, and
the other half thinks we’ll be OK.”  Yields on the benchmark 10-year note fell two basis points,
or 0.02 percentage point, to 3.37 percent at 8:57 a.m. in  New
York , according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices.  To contact the reporter on this story:
