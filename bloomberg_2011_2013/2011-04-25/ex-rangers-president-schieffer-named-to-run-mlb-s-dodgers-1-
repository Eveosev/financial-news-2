Major League Baseball 
appointed J. Thomas Schieffer, the former president of the Texas
Rangers, to monitor business and day-to-day operations of the
 Los Angeles Dodgers .  The selection of Schieffer was announced today by
Commissioner Bud Selig, who said last week that his office was
taking over operations of the Dodgers because of “deep concerns
regarding the finances and operations” of the team.  Schieffer, 63, is a senior counsel with Washington-based
 Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld LLP  who specializes in oil and
gas matters and investment management. He served three terms as
a Democrat in the Texas House of Representatives, and was U.S.
Ambassador to Australia from 2001 to 2005 and to  Japan  in 2005
to 2009.  “We are very fortunate to have someone of Tom Schieffer’s
stature monitor the operations of the Los Angeles Dodgers on
behalf of Major League Baseball,” Selig said in a statement.
“The many years that he spent managing the operations of a
successful franchise will benefit the Dodgers and Major League
Baseball as a whole.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
