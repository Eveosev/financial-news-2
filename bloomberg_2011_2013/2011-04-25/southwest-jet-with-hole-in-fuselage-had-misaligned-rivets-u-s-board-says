The  Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV)  plane
which had a nearly 5-foot-long hole open during flight at 34,000
feet on April 1 had misaligned rivet holes where two parts of
the fuselage were assembled, a U.S. safety board said.  Wear-induced cracks stretched from 42 of the 58 rivet holes
along the 9-inch-wide fracture in the  Boeing Co. (BA)  737-300 jet,
according to the board’s statement today.  There were 123 people on the plane, which made an emergency
landing in Yuma,  Arizona . One flight attendant and one passenger
were injured. The aircraft was delivered to Southwest in 1996
and had 39,781 takeoffs and landings prior to the incident.  Boeing said April 5 that cracks on the so-called 737
Classic weren’t forecast to occur until after 60,000 takeoffs
and landings.  The  Federal Aviation Administration  on April 5 required
checks on all 737-300s, 737-400s and 737-500s that have flown
more than 30,000 cycles. Boeing said today that checks for
cracks in the single-aisle planes have been completed on 75
percent of the 190 aircraft at risk globally.  Cracking has been found only on five Southwest jets
previously identified, and it’s too early to speculate on the
cause, Chicago-based Boeing said in a statement today.  Portions of the panels from the five planes, delivered
between 1994 and 1996, have been shipped to Boeing, which is
analyzing them, the company said in a statement.  “Boeing will not speculate on what the NTSB’s initial
findings may suggest about the root cause,” the company said in
its statement, adding that it is “fully engaged” in the
investigation.  Southwest is confident that its aircraft meet the FAA
directive requirements, company spokesman Brad Hawkins said.
“Southwest Airlines looks forward to the results of the
completed investigation,” Hawkins said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
