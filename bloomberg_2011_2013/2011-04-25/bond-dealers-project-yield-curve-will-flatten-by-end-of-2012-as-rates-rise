Bond dealers project the gap
between yields on two-year and 10-year Treasury notes to narrow
by the end of 2012 as the  Federal Reserve  begins raising rates
next year, according to an economic forecast released today.  The Bond Dealers of America sees a 60 percent chance that
the Fed will not begin to increase its federal funds rate target
until 2012, the survey of chief economists and market
strategists at middle-market bond dealers showed. The group
expects gross domestic product to rise 2.9 percent this year and
3.1 percent in 2012.  The poll’s median forecast calls for the gap between two-
year and 10-year note yields to widen to 286 basis points at the
end of the second quarter of 2011. At the end of the year, the
gap is forecast to be 270 basis points, before narrowing to 217
basis points by the end of 2012. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point.  “The historically steep yield curve is expected to flatten
in 2012,” the group said. “The movements reflect the higher
likelihood of a rate hike next year, increased government bond
issuance to finance the deficit and the GDP growth forecast.”  The spread between two-year and 10-year Treasury notes was
about 273 basis points in New York trading this morning. The
 Congressional Budget Office  projects budget deficits of $1.4
trillion in fiscal 2011 and $1.2 trillion in 2012, based on
President Barack Obama’s proposals.  Bond dealers said the municipal  bond market  is either
“oversold” or correctly priced. About 33 percent of
respondents expect yields in this market to decline and 55
percent forecast no change in the relationship between municipal
bond and Treasury yields, with 11 percent projecting a relative
increase.  The forecast projects that the  consumer price index  will
rise to 2.8 percent this year before slowing to 1.7 percent in
2012. The CPI rose 2.7 percent in the 12 months ended in March,
the biggest year-over-year gain since December 2009, according
to Labor Department data released on April 15.  Housing prices are expected to remain “generally weak,”
over the next year, the bond dealers said. Declines are expected
in the Northeast, Southeast, Southwest and Great Lakes Regions,
with modest gains expected in the West.  To contact the reporters on this story:
