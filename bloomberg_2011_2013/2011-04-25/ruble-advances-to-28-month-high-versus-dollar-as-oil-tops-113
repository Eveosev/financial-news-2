The ruble strengthened against the
dollar, rising to its strongest level in more than 28 months, as
oil,  Russia ’s key export, traded above $113 a barrel.  The Russian currency appreciated 0.6 percent to 27.8510 per
dollar in Moscow trading, its strongest closing level since Dec.
18, 2008. Against the euro, the ruble climbed 0.3 percent, its
biggest gain in a week, to 40.6600.  Crude, Russia’s main export earner, climbed for a fourth
day with the June contract adding 78 cents to $113.07 a barrel
in  New York , the highest intraday price since April 11, when
futures reached $113.46, the most since September 2008.  Moves against the dollar and the euro left the ruble at
33.6151, the strongest since April 10, against the central
bank’s target currency basket, which it uses to manage swings
that hurt Russian exporters. The basket is calculated by
multiplying the dollar’s rate to the ruble by 0.55, the euro to
ruble rate by 0.45, then adding them together.  -- Editors: Alexander Nicholson, Claudia Maedler  To contact the reporters on this story:
