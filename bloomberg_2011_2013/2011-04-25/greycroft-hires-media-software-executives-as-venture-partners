Greycroft Partners LLC , the
venture-capital firm started by Alan Patricof, hired Paul Bricault, formerly of the William Morris Agency, and software-
industry veteran Kirill Sheynkman as venture partners.  Bricault will work out of the firm’s  Los Angeles  office,
and Sheynkman is joining the firm’s headquarters in New York,
Greycroft said today in an e-mailed statement. Greycroft also
hired Alan Gould, a former executive at Nielsen Holdings NV, as
an executive in residence in New York.  Founded in 2006, Greycroft profited in February from  AOL
Inc. (AOL) ’s purchase of the Huffington Post for $315 million. Adding
Bricault gives Greycroft an executive with 20 years of
experience in the entertainment and media industries. Sheynkman
was previously chief executive officer of three software
startups, including cloud-computing company  Elastra Corp.   Greycroft raised $75 million for its first fund in 2006,
the year it invested in Huffington Post, and followed that with
a $130 million fund in 2010. Prior to Greycroft, Patricof, 76,
headed private-equity firm  Apax Partners  for more than three
decades.  To contact the reporter on this story:
