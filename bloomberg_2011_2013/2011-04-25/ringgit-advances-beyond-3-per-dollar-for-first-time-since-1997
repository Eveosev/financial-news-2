(Corrects name of index in eighth paragraph of story
published April 25.)  Malaysia ’s ringgit advanced above 3
per  U.S. dollar  for the first time in more than 13 years on
speculation its central bank will join Asian countries,
including  India  and  South Korea , in raising interest rates to
help damp inflation.  Higher rates are boosting fund inflows into the region as
economists forecast central banks in  Japan  and the U.S. will
keep their benchmark rates near zero this week. The ringgit led
appreciation among Asian currencies today with its biggest jump
in two weeks after inflation in Southeast Asia’s third-largest
economy accelerated at the fastest pace in 23 months in March.  “We could expect the ringgit to strengthen to counter
inflation, given that there’s still a small probability of a
rate increase in May,” said Saktiandi Supaat, head of foreign-
exchange research in Singapore at Malayan Banking Bhd. “It’s
also helped by the dollar weakness.”  The ringgit strengthened 0.4 percent to 2.9915 per dollar
as of 6:15 p.m. in  Kuala Lumpur , according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It touched 2.9910, the strongest level since Oct. 9,
1997. Analysts predicted the currency will rise to 2.90 per
dollar in the fourth quarter, a Bloomberg News survey showed.  Bank Negara Malaysia , the country’s central bank, will meet
on May 5 to decide whether to resume raising rates. It has kept
its overnight rate at 2.75 percent since July, after raising it
three times in 2010 in a pre-emptive move.  Yield Premiums  Higher Asian rates have boosted the yield premiums on local
assets, attracting foreign funds. While global exports remained
sluggish, Malaysia’s economy grew 7.2 percent last year, the
most in a decade.  Southeast Asia ’s third largest economy is
forecast by the central bank to expand by as much as 6 percent
this year.  The ringgit’s 2.8 percent rally this year added to a 12
percent appreciation in 2010 as foreign investors raised their
total holdings of local-currency debt to a  record  138 billion
ringgit ($46 billion) as at end February.  The Australian dollar rose to a record while the Dollar
Index, which tracks the currency against those of six major
trading partners, fell 0.2 percent today, the lowest since
August 2008, after declining 1 percent last week.  “With good growth momentum and inflationary pressure still
elevated, it’s a window of opportunity for policy makers to
tighten,” said  Rahul Bajoria , an economist in Singapore at
Barclays Plc. “We see the ringgit getting stronger over the
next three to 12 months, it’s a sustainable gain.”  Consumer Prices  Consumer prices in Malaysia rose 3 percent in March from a
year earlier, the most since April 2009, the statistics
department said on April 20.  Bank Negara  has kept its overnight
rate at 2.75 percent since July, after raising it three times in
2010.  “Policy makers may be prompted to resume raising  interest
rates  in two weeks’ time after seeing the inflation” trend,
Kuala Lumpur-based Hong Leong Bank Bhd. said in a research note
to clients today.  The  Federal Reserve  will keep its target rate for overnight
loans between banks between zero and 0.25 percent when it meets
on April 27, according to all 80 economists in a Bloomberg News
survey. The rate has been unchanged since December 2008.  Benchmark 10-year notes snapped a two-day loss before a
government debt sale later this week.  The yield on the 4.16 percent note maturing in July 2021
dropped 4 basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 4.07
percent, according to Bursa Malaysia. The price increased 0.3,
or 3 ringgit per 1,000 ringgit face amount, to 100.7.  The treasury will sell 3.5 billion ringgit of Shariah-
compliant notes maturing in 2021 on April 27, through both
auction and private placement, according to its sale calendar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
