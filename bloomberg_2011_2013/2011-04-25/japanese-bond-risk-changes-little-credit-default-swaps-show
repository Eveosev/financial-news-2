The cost of protecting corporate
bonds from non-payment in  Japan  was little changed, according to
traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index stood at 123.5 basis points
as of 9:42 a.m. in Tokyo from Friday, according to Deutsche Bank
AG.  Swap contracts insuring Japanese government debt against
default also were little changed at 79 basis points, Deutsche
Bank prices show. Asian and Australia markets are closed for a
public holiday today.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
