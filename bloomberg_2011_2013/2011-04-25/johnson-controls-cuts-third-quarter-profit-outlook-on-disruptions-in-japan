Johnson Controls Inc. (JCI) , the largest
U.S. auto supplier, said disruptions from the Japan earthquake
and tsunami will reduce third-quarter profit by as much as
18 cents a share and revenue by about $500 million.  Johnson Controls expects to earn 51 cents to 53 cents a
share in the fiscal third quarter, which ends June 30, the
company said in a statement today. Twenty-one analysts in a
Bloomberg survey estimated profit of 67 cents, on average.  Production disruptions after the March 11 earthquake and
tsunami won’t affect fourth-quarter results, and revenue and
profit should be recovered from October through March, the
Milwaukee-based company said. The company boosted its annual
sales forecast by $1 billion to $39.5 billion because of higher
than anticipated growth in its building efficiency unit.  Profit in the three months ended March 31 was 56 cents a
share, excluding certain items, matching the average estimate of
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Second-quarter sales rose
22 percent to $10.1 billion. Analysts in a Bloomberg survey
estimated revenue of $9.35 billion, on average.  The company’s building-efficiency business is its second-
largest operating unit, with second-quarter revenue of
$3.5 billion, up 18 percent from a year earlier. Sales by
Johnson Controls’ automotive seating and interiors unit rose
25 percent to $5.2 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
