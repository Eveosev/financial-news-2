Following is the text of the
new home sales report from the Commerce Department.  Sales of new single-family houses in March 2011 were
at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 300,000, according
to estimates released jointly today by the U.S. Census
Bureau and the Department of Housing and Urban
Development.  This is 11.1 percent (+/-21.7%)* above the
revised February rate of 270,000, but is 21.9 percent (+/-
10.3%) below the March 2010 estimate of 384,000.  The median sales price of new houses sold in March
2011 was $213,800; the average sales price was $246,800.
The seasonally adjusted estimate of new houses for sale at
the end of March was 183,000.  This represents a supply of
7.3 months at the current sales rate.  New Residential Sales data for April 2011 will be
released on Tuesday, May 24, 2011, at 10:00 A.M. EDT.  * 90% confidence interval includes zero.  The Census
Bureau does not have sufficient statistical evidence to
conclude that the actual change is different from zero.  SOURCE: U.S. Commerce Department.
