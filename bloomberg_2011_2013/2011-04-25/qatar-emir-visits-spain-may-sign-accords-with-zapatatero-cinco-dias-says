The emir of Qatar today begins a
state visit to  Spain  to reinforce political and economic
relations between the countries in meetings that will likely
produce several agreements,  Cinco Dias  reported.  Almost two months have elapsed since Spanish Prime Minister
Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero travelled to the emirate and was
promised that 3 billion euros ($4.4 billion) investments would
be made in Spanish companies, with about 10 percent of that
going to recapitalize savings banks, the newspaper said.  Sheikh Hamad Bin Khalifa Al Thani and his wife, Sheikha
Mozah Nasser bint Nasser, will be received by Spain’s King and
Queen and tomorrow they meet Zapatero for lunch when it’s
expected they will sign various accords, the newspaper said
citing unidentified people in the Zapatero’s government.   Given the significant role Qatar has played in the military
intervention in  Libya , the conflict will be on the emir’s
Spanish agenda, the report said.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
