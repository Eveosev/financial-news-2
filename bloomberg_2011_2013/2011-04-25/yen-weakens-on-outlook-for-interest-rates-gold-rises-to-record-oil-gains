U.S. stocks fell, breaking a three-
day streak of gains for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, as
commodity producers led declines. The dollar slipped versus the
Swiss franc for a fourth straight day and Treasuries rose.  The  S&P 500  dropped 0.2 percent to 1,335.25 at 4 p.m. in
New York as gauges of energy and raw-material companies lost at
least 0.6 percent. Oil was little changed, while copper futures
plunged 2.2 percent, the most in almost seven weeks, while gold
and silver touched records in  London . The dollar lost 0.6
percent versus the franc, the most among 16 major peers. Ten-
year Treasury yields fell four basis points to 3.36 percent.  Marathon Oil Corp. and Newmont Mining Corp. lost at least
2.3 percent to pace losses among commodity producers in the S&P
500, while Kimberly-Clark Corp. retreated 2.7 percent after the
maker of Scott toilet paper and Huggies diapers cut the lower
end of its 2011 profit forecast, citing higher materials costs.
Investors also looked ahead to the  Federal Reserve ’s statement
on interest rates and the economic outlook on April 27.  “Profit estimates and growth expectations are beginning to
soften a little bit,” said Robert Schaeffer, a  money manager  at
Becker Capital Management Inc. in Portland, Oregon, which
oversees about $2.5 billion. “We’re in a trading-range market,
and unless something unexpected happens we will probably be
stuck where we are right now.”  S&P 500’s High  The S&P 500 has failed to rise above its 2011 high reached
on February 18 even as it closed less than 1 percent below that
peak on eight days so far in April. The Feb. 18 close of
1,343.01 was the index’s highest since June 2008. The gauge is
still up 6.2 percent in 2011 amid higher-than-estimated profits
and government programs to stimulate the economy.  Per-share earnings have exceeded estimates at 81 percent of
the 124 companies in the S&P 500 that reported first-quarter
results since April 11, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The  Federal Open Market Committee  will hold the benchmark
interest rate in a range of zero to 0.25 percent on April 27,
according to all 80 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. Gross
domestic product rose at a 1.9 percent annual pace after
increasing at a 3.1 percent rate in the previous three months,
according to the median estimate of 66 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News before an April 28 Commerce Department report.  The Dollar Index slipped 0.1 percent to 74.029 after
declining as much as 0.4 percent earlier. The gauge, used by
IntercontinentalExchange Inc. to track the greenback versus the
currencies of six major U.S. trading partners, touched 73.735 on
April 21, the lowest since August 2008.  Home Sales  Eight of 12 homebuilders in S&P indexes gained after new-
home sales in the U.S., tabulated when contracts are signed,
climbed 12 percent to a 280,000 annual pace last month,
according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey of
64 economists. Purchases slumped 17 percent in February to a
250,000 rate, the weakest in data going back to 1963.  Exchanges from  Australia  to the U.K. and  Germany  remain
shut today for the Easter holiday.  China ’s Shanghai Composite Index led losses in  Asia  after
China International Capital Corp. said the nation’s consumer
prices may rise as much as 5.5 percent this month. Singapore’s
inflation held at 5 percent in March, a government report today
showed.  “It’s very clear that some Asian countries will keep
raising rates more while their economies are strong enough to
see more hikes,” said  Hideki Hayashi , a global economist at
Mizuho Securities Co. in  Tokyo . “On the other hand, market
players expect the U.S. this week to suggest it would keep low
rates for some time, which means more yield appeal for Asia.”  Silver, Gold  Silver, which has more than doubled over the past year,
rose as investors sought precious metals as a store of value and
amid speculation China will buy gold and silver to diversify its
foreign-exchange holdings. Silver for July delivery rose 2.4
percent to settle at $47.173 an ounce in  New York  and the metal
for immediate delivery climbed as much as 5.4 percent to $49.79
in London. Gold for immediate delivery climbed as much as 0.8
percent to $1,518.32 an ounce.  Corn for July delivery surged 3.2 percent to $7.685 a
bushel on speculation that wet, cold weather across the U.S.
Midwest will further delay planting, reducing yields. Wheat for
July increased 3.2 percent to $8.6125 a bushel.  Oil for June delivery slipped 1 cent to settle at $112.28 a
barrel in New York.  Recent gains in commodity prices are fueling speculation
policy makers in Asia will step up tightening efforts. The
Malaysian ringgit gained as much as 0.5 percent to 2.9910, the
strongest level since Oct. 9, 1997, on speculation the central
bank will raise interest rates next month to help damp
inflation.  ‘Imported Inflation’  “There’s a perception that central banks in Asia are
allowing their currencies to appreciate so as to curb imported
inflation,” Lee Wai Tuck, a strategist at Forecast Pte in
Singapore, said in a Bloomberg Television interview. “There are
some concerns that if currencies do not appreciate, inflation
may go even higher” in countries including China and Singapore,
he said.  The Bank of  Japan  may cut its forecast for real growth for
fiscal 2011 to 0.8 percent from 1.6 percent as a result of the
March 11 earthquake, the Nikkei newspaper reported today. The
central bank will keep its benchmark interest rate at a range
between zero and 0.1 percent at its next meeting, according to
all of 13 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.  About four shares declined for every three that climbed in
MSCI’s Asia Pacific Index, which slipped 0.2 percent today. The
Shanghai Composite dropped 1.5 percent.  Posco (005490) , Acer  Posco slipped 1.9 percent in  Korea  after the world’s third-
biggest steelmaker by output said first-quarter profit dropped
33 percent.  Acer Inc. (2353)  sank 3.1 percent in  Taiwan  after the
world’s second-largest supplier of  notebook computers  reported
the lowest quarterly profit in six years.  Reliance Industries
Ltd. (RIL) ,  India ’s biggest company by market value, fell 3 percent in
India after posting net income that missed analyst forecasts.  Since April 11, just 42 percent of the 73 companies in the
MSCI Asia Pacific that reported per-share earnings have beaten
analyst predictions, compared with about 69 percent in the MSCI
World Index, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
