A former  Banco Santander SA (SAN)  analyst
agreed to pay more than $625,000 to settle U.S. regulatory
claims that he used inside information to profit from  BHP
Billiton Ltd. (BHP) ’s $39 billion takeover bid for Potash Corp. of
Saskatchewan Inc.  Juan Jose Fernandez Garcia, who was leading a research unit
for Madrid-based Santander when the offer was made in August,
reaped about $576,000 from Potash options contracts purchased in
the days before the announcement, the Securities and Exchange
Commission said today in a statement. Santander was an adviser
on the bid to BHP, the world’s largest mining company.  The SEC filed an emergency court action on Aug. 20 freezing
the assets and accounts of Fernandez Garcia and another trader,
Luis Martin Caro Sanchez. Fernandez Garcia settled without
admitting or denying the allegations, the SEC said. The case
against Caro Sanchez is still pending, the agency said.  “This concludes our emergency action against Garcia and
demonstrates that the Commission will act swiftly to prevent
foreign citizens who commit fraud in the U.S. securities markets
from reaping the profits of their illegal activity,” Daniel Hawke, head of the SEC enforcement division’s market abuse unit,
said in the agency’s statement.  David Gordon, a lawyer for Fernandez Garcia at Sidley
Austin LLP, and Pravin Rao, an attorney for Caro Sanchez at
Perkins Coie LLP, declined to comment. An e-mail sent after
working hours to Santander spokesman Peter Greiff wasn’t
immediately returned. The bank wasn’t accused of wrongdoing.  Call Options   Fernandez Garcia purchased a total of 282 call options for
about $13,700 from Aug. 12 to Aug. 16, according to the SEC’s
complaint. He sold them Aug. 17 for a profit of about $576,000.
Caro Sanchez bought $48,000 of call options, making a profit of
$497,000, the SEC said.  Potash shares jumped 28 percent on the day the Saskatoon,
Saskatchewan-based company said it had rejected the offer from
BHP. Melbourne-based BHP took its $130-a-share cash offer
directly to Potash investors before dropping the bid amid
regulatory opposition.  The case is Securities & Exchange Commission v. Fernandez
Garcia, et al, 10-cv-05268, U.S. District Court, Northern
District of  Illinois  ( Chicago ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
