Asia naphtha and gasoline rallied
to the highest since July 2008. Hin Leong Trading Pte bought
four gasoil cargoes in Singapore, the region’s biggest oil-
trading center.  Light Distillates  Open-specification naphtha for delivery to  Japan  rose 0.1
percent to $1,077.50 a metric ton, the highest since July 31,
2008, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The premium of
Japan-delivered naphtha to London-traded  Brent crude , or the
crack spread, fell $2.26 to $140.36, the lowest in three days.  Benchmark 92-RON gasoline rose 90 cents, or 0.7 percent, to
$130.25 a barrel, Bloomberg data showed. That’s the highest
since July 22, 2008. Gasoline’s premium to naphtha added 85
cents to $12.55. A widening reforming margin signals increased
profit from making motor fuel over petrochemical feedstock.  In Singapore, Morgan Stanley sold 50,000 barrels of 92-RON
gasoline loading May 10 to May 14 to Vitol Group at $130.30 a
barrel, traders said. Royal Dutch Shell Plc bought 25,000 tons
of open-specification naphtha for first-half July delivery from
BP Plc at $1,075 a ton.  Middle Distillates  Gasoil, or diesel, with 0.5 percent sulfur dropped 75 cents,
or 0.5 percent, to $138.10 a barrel, according to Bloomberg data.
Jet fuel decreased 65 cents, or 0.5 percent, to $138.90. Each
product declined for the first time in three days.  In  Singapore , Hin Leong bought three 150,000-barrel cargoes
of 0.5 percent sulfur gasoil at 30 cents a barrel above
benchmark quotes, traders said. The sellers were Singapore
Petroleum Co., BP and Glencore International AG.  Hin Leong also purchased 150,000 barrels of gasoil with 500
parts-per-million of sulfur from Vitol at a premium of $1.90 a
barrel, traders said.  Gasoil’s premium to Asian benchmark Dubai crude fell 92
cents to $20.30 a barrel at 6 p.m. Singapore time, based on data
from PVM Oil Associates, a broker. This crack spread, a measure
of refining profit, was at the narrowest since March 11.  Jet fuel’s premium to gasoil was unchanged after dropping
on April 21 to 80 cents a barrel, PVM said. This regrade has
more than doubled from 30 cents in the past two weeks,
indicating it’s more profitable to produce  aviation fuel  over
diesel.  Vitol sold two 100,000-barrel cargoes of jet fuel to BP at
20 cents a barrel over benchmark quotes, traders said. One cargo
will load between May 10 and May 14, and another between May 16
and May 20.  Fuel Oil  Benchmark 180-centistoke fuel oil increased $3.25, or 0.5
percent, to $687 a ton, according to Bloomberg. The price of
380-centistoke fuel oil, mainly used as marine fuel, rose $2, or
0.3 percent, to $672.25. Each variety gained for a third day.  Fuel oil’s discount to Dubai crude was little changed at
$10.89 a barrel, indicating continued losses from turning oil
into residual products, Bloomberg data showed. The premium of
180-centistoke  fuel oil  to 380-centistoke grade gained $1.25 to
$14.75 a ton, the highest in a week. A widening viscosity spread
means bunker climbed less than higher-quality fuel oil.  In Singapore, BP sold 20,000 tons of 380-centistoke fuel
oil loading May 15 to May 19 to Shell at $4 a ton over benchmark
quotes, traders said. The two companies traded at the same
premium on April 21.  To contact the reporter on this story:
