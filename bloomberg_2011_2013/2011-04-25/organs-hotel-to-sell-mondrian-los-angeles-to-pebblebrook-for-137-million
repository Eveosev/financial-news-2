Morgans Hotel Group Co. (MHGC)  agreed to
sell the Mondrian Los Angeles, a 237-room hotel on the city’s
Sunset Boulevard, to  Pebblebrook Hotel Trust (PEB)  for $137 million.  The sale is expected to be completed in the current
quarter, Morgans said in a statement today. The New York-based
company will continue to operate the hotel under a 20-year
management agreement.  Morgans has been selling properties as it seeks to cut debt
and focus on managing hotels rather than owning. It agreed
earlier this month to sell the Royalton and Morgans hotels in
New York for $140 million. The Mondrian deal will generate net
proceeds of about $40 million after a portion of the money is
used to retire outstanding mortgage debt, the company said.  “The transaction proceeds will allow us to reduce our debt
and fund the continued growth of our higher margin management
business,” Chief Executive Officer  Michael Gross   said in the
statement.  Pebblebrook, based in Bethesda, Maryland, has bought
properties this year including the Hotel Monaco in Seattle and
the Westin Gaslamp Quarter in  San Diego . President and Chief
Executive Officer Jon Bortz said in an interview earlier this
month that the company planned to spend an additional $400
million to $600 million on hotel purchases in 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
