Abu Dhabi Capital Management , an
 investment company  set up this year, took advantage of regional
turmoil to complete three deals since it started a fund in March
to buy out private-equity investors.  The fund, the first of its kind in the Middle East and
North Africa, acquires holdings in private-equity vehicles at a
discount from investors who otherwise wouldn’t be able to exit
until the investment matures and then retains the position until
maturity.  “We’ve completed two transactions in the Middle East and
North Africa region and one in the  United States ,” Chief
Executive Officer Jassim Alseddiqi said in an interview in Abu
Dhabi yesterday. “The turbulence that happened in the past few
months has even increased the severity of the discounts.”  Political unrest in the Middle East and North Africa that
toppled  Tunisia ’s Zine El Abidine Ben Ali and  Egypt ’s Hosni Mubarak has caused fear amongst investors, prompting them to
sell their holdings at “extremely lucrative prices,” Alseddiqi
said. The company expects to realize returns of more than 120
percent in the next several years, he said.  The fund, known as ADCM Secondary Private Equity Fund, has
so far raised $45 million from high net-worth individuals and
institutions, predominantly from the United Arab Emirates and
plans to raise $100 million by February 2012.  Capital Management, which intends to exit the fund by 2016,
values its current assets at $60 million and plans to complete
one or more transactions by year end, Alseddiqi added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
