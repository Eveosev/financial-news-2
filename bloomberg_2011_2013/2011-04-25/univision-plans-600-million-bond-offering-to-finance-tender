Univision Communications Inc., the
Spanish-language media company taken private in 2007, may sell
$600 million of eight-year senior secured notes, according to a
person with knowledge of the offering.  Proceeds will be used to buy back New York-based
Univision’s 12 percent notes due July 2014, said the person, who
declined to be identified because terms aren’t set. The company
has $545 million of the bonds outstanding, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Univision is offering to purchase the securities at a price
of 107.6 cents on the dollar until May 6, it said today in a
statement distributed by PR Newswire. Deutsche Bank AG and Bank
of America Corp. are managing the tender offer, according to the
statement. The debt has declined to 107.8 cents from 110 cents
on Jan. 5, according to Bloomberg Valuation.  Univision last issued bonds on Nov. 9, when it sold $815
million of 8.5 percent bonds due in May 2021 that yielded 536
basis points more than similar-maturity Treasuries, Bloomberg
data show.  The company is ranked B3 by Moody’s Investors Service and
B, one step higher, by  Standard & Poor’s .  To contact the reporter on this story:
