The price of used business jets has
remained low even as economies worldwide start to recover from
the financial crisis, the Financial Times reported, citing
aircraft brokers.  A one-year-old Learjet which cost as much as $13 million
new can be acquired for $8 million, and “that’s a huge gap
between new and pre-owned aircraft,” broker Jahid Fazal-Karim,
co-owner of  North Carolina ’s  Jetcraft Corp . told the newspaper.  Part of the slump was caused by difficulty in raising bank
finance, the FT said.
