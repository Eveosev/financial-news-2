Minsur SA (MINSURI1) , the world’s fourth-
largest tin producer, fell the most in two years on investor
concern that the winner of  Peru ’s June 5 presidential election
may curb mining investment.  The shares plunged 9.2 percent to 2.96 soles at 1:18 p.m.
New York time, after earlier dropping as much as 11 percent, the
biggest intraday decline since Nov. 19, 2008.  Investors reacted to a weekend poll that showed former
Peruvian military rebel Ollanta Humala opened a six-point lead
over rival Keiko Fujimori, said Miguel Pancorvo, the head trader
at Lima-based brokerage Compass SAB. Humala has pledged to
impose a windfall tax on mining companies.  “Small-scale investors are selling their shares as people
are scared of the election outcome,” Pancorvo said. “We’ll
probably see institutional investors snap up bargains at the end
of the day.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
