The  Federal Reserve ’s $600 billion
bond-purchase program may be yielding results like those of a
Kennedy-era effort to spur growth, which spawned a 0.15
percentage point reduction in long-term Treasury yields, said
researchers at the central bank.  Economists with the Fed’s regional bank in San Francisco
likened “Operation Twist,” a 1961 initiative by the central
bank and President  John F. Kennedy ’s administration, to the
current round of Treasury-securities purchases known as “QE2.”
The researchers drew the comparison in a paper released today,
without quantifying QE2’s effects.  Policy makers are set to convene in  Washington  on April 26-
27, and determine whether to stick with the $600 billion program
through June. The Fed and the Kennedy administration used
Operation Twist to bring down long-term rates, while keeping
short-term rates unchanged, and stimulate a weak economy, the
paper said.  “We find that Operation Twist lowered long-term Treasury
yields by about 0.15 percentage point (15 basis points), an
amount that was highly statistically significant, but
moderate,” wrote research associate Titan Alon and senior
research adviser Eric Swanson. The results “can be used to
estimate QE2’s effects.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
