Ethanol futures in  Chicago 
increased the most in more than three weeks on concern that bad
weather will hurt corn crops and lift production costs for the
gasoline additive.  The alternative fuel rose 1.7 percent as wet weather in the
Midwest made it difficult for farmers to get equipment into
fields. Corn is the primary ingredient in ethanol produced in
the U.S.  “Ethanol followed corn,” said Matt Janney, a broker at
Citigroup Global Markets Inc. in Chicago. “Some people are
getting worried about not being able to secure the corn, not now
but in August with a delayed crop.”  Denatured ethanol for May delivery rose 4.5 cents to $2.631
a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade. Prices have risen 11
percent this year.  In cash market trading, ethanol in  New York  jumped 6 cents,
or 2.3 percent, to $2.71 a gallon and in Chicago the additive
advanced 4.5 cents, or 1.8 percent, to $2.62, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol on the West Coast gained 4.5 cents, or 1.7 percent,
to $2.72 a gallon and in the U.S. Gulf the biofuel added 2
cents, or 0.7 percent, to $2.725.  Corn for July delivery rose 24 cents, or 3.2 percent, to
close at $7.685 a bushel in Chicago. One bushel distills into at
least 2.75 gallons of the fuel.  Ethanol has moved in the same price direction as corn 95
percent of the time over the past two years, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
