Tokyo Electric Power Co., battling
radiation leaks from a nuclear reactor crippled by the March 11
earthquake and tsunami, will reduce compensation for workers,
management and executives to cut costs.  Annual remuneration for board members will be reduced by 50
percent, while pay for managers and workers will be cut by 25
percent and 20 percent respectively, the company said today in a
statement on its website. The company known as Tepco will not
hire new graduates next fiscal year, according to the statement.  Tepco,  Japan ’s largest power company, expects to save about
54 billion yen ($659 million) a year from the pay cuts,
according to the statement. The utility faces compensation
claims of as much as 11 trillion yen for the world’s worst
nuclear crisis since Chernobyl in 1986, Bank of America Corp.’s
Merrill Lynch said last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
