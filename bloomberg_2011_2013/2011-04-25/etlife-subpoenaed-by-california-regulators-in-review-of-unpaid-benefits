MetLife Inc. (MET) , the largest U.S. life
insurer, was  subpoenaed  by California regulators reviewing
whether the company cheated policyholders’ survivors.  “MetLife failed to pay life insurance policy benefits to
named beneficiaries or the state even after learning that an
insured had died,” California Insurance Commissioner Dave Jones
said today in a  statement , citing preliminary findings from a
state audit on the New York-based company.  Jones and California Controller John Chiang are widening a
probe into whether life insurers held funds that were owed to
beneficiaries or, in cases when they couldn’t be located, to the
state. John Hancock, a unit of Toronto-based  Manulife Financial
Corp. (MFC) , agreed last week to restore the full value of more than
6,400 accounts and improve methods to determine of policyholders
have died.  The state is reviewing cases when insurance companies
depleted policyholder benefits, citing unpaid premiums, rather
than forwarding the funds to a designee of the deceased. Jones
demanded in the subpoena that MetLife send a representative to a
May 23 hearing in  Sacramento  into the insurer’s conduct.  “MetLife did not take steps to determine whether policy
owners of dormant accounts are still alive,” according to the
statement.  Christopher Breslin , a spokesman for MetLife, didn’t
immediately return a call seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
