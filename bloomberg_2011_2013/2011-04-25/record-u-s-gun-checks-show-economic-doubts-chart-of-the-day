Americans are telling a “less
upbeat story” about the economy’s prospects as they attempt to
buy guns in record numbers, according to Nicholas Colas, chief
market strategist at BNY ConvergEx Group LLC.  The CHART OF THE DAY shows the average monthly number of
background-check applications increased to 1.25 million in the
12-month period that ended in March, according to data compiled
by the  Federal Bureau of Investigation . The figure has been
setting records since January.  Spending on guns, ammunition and other sporting equipment
rose 9.9 percent in the 12-month period that ended in February
after adjusting for inflation, according to U.S. Commerce
Department data. The increase was almost four times faster than
the 2.5 percent rise in all personal consumption expenditures.  In this year’s first quarter, the FBI’s National Instant
Criminal Background Check System processed 4.25 million requests
on prospective gun buyers. The total increased 16 percent from a
year earlier. The law-enforcement agency started its current
tracking system in 1998.  The FBI is likely to carry out more than 15 million checks
in all of 2011, Colas wrote. The projection is at least 4
percent higher than last year’s 14.4 million, and would amount
to the seventh straight annual record.  To contact the reporter on this story:
