Temperatures in the U.S. Northeast
will start higher than normal this week and then drop below the
seasonal average by early May, according to  Matt Rogers ,
president of  Commodity Weather Group LLC  in Bethesda, Maryland.  In his 1- to 5-day outlook, Rogers calls for a large
crescent of warmer-than-normal weather to extend from Nevada and
 California  across the southern half of the U.S. and into the
Ohio Valley, the Northeast and Canada.  At the same time, a pocket of cooler air will settle over
the northern Great Plains. The heat will diminish in the 6- to
10-day range and temperatures over most of the U.S. will be near
normal, Rogers said.  The cool pocket in the Great Plains will expand slightly,
he said.  MDA EarthSat Weather  has a similar outlook. It calls for a
larger area of cooling extending from the Pacific Northwest
through the  Great Lakes .  Natural gas traders monitor weather forecasts to determine
whether temperatures boost heating or cooling demand.
Predictions of below-normal or above-normal temperatures may
prompt traders to buy or sell gas futures. Commodity traders
watch precipitation forecasts for potential impact on planting
and yields.  In his 11- to 15-day forecast, Rogers predicts the cool air
will expand into the Northeast and  New England , while the
Southwest will heat up. MDA calls for the warming trend to
extend from southern California to the  Florida panhandle  and the
cooling to cover an area from Montana to New England and the
Canadian Maritimes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
