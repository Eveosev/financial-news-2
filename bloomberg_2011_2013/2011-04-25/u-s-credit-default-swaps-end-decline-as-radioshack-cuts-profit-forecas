The cost to protect  Ford Motor
Co. (F) ’s debt declined after the second-largest U.S. automaker’s
profit rose to the highest for a first quarter since 1998.  Credit-default swaps on Ford declined 12.5 basis points to
270.5 basis points from 775.9 basis points in May 2010,
according to data provider CMA. Contracts on its finance arm
Ford Motor Credit Co. dropped 6.8 basis points to 202.7, down
from as high as 582.6 basis points last May.  Profit was 62 cents a share excluding some items, beating
the 50-cent average of 14 analysts’ estimates compiled by
Bloomberg, as the company won higher prices for fuel-efficient
new models. The automaker’s a “very good success story,”
according to Tom Farina, managing director at Deutsche Insurance
Asset Management in  New York , which oversees $200 billion.  “They’re doing a good job selling product in a market
where there seems to be some ability to take some product market
share,” he said in a telephone interview. “People feel it will
become investment-grade over the next six to 24 months.”  The swaps need to fall about 40 basis points to imply that
the company’s debt is investment-grade, according to David Munves, an analyst at Moody’s Corp.’s capital markets research
group. The prices implied a rank of Ba2 as of April 22.  Ford’s $1.25 billion of 8.125 percent notes maturing in
January 2020 rose 0.5 cent to 118.5 cents on the dollar with a
yield of 5.429 percent at 1:27 p.m. in New York, according to
Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority. That’s the highest price since Nov. 15,
Trace data show.  Confidence Grows  The cost of protecting corporate bonds from default in the
U.S. fell after earnings from Ford and 3M Co. bolstered
confidence in company creditworthiness.  The Markit CDX North America Investment Grade Index, which
investors use to hedge against losses on corporate debt or to
speculate on creditworthiness, decreased 0.9 basis point to a
mid-price of 92.7 basis points as of 5:14 p.m. in New York,
according to index administrator Markit Group Ltd.  “Economic numbers were slightly better than people had
hoped, confidence was slightly better and there’s earnings
optimism,” said  Michael Kraft , senior portfolio manager at
Vanderbilt Avenue Asset Management LLC. “All of these
contributed to market euphoria in the equity markets and credit
markets.”  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose to the highest level
since June 2008, adding 0.9 percent to 1,347.24 as 3M boosted
its full-year earnings forecast after profit surpassed analysts’
estimates, fueled by demand for films used in solar panels and
tablet computers, and  International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) 
increased its quarterly dividend and set aside more money for
share buybacks.  Company Earnings  The credit swaps index, which typically falls as investor
confidence improves and rises as it deteriorates, has declined
from 95.8 basis points at the end of last month after 122 of the
154 Standard & Poor’s 500 companies that reported results this
quarter beat projections, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Credit swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails
to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A
basis point equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10
million of debt.  General Motors Co. is the biggest U.S. carmaker.  To contact the reporter on this story:
