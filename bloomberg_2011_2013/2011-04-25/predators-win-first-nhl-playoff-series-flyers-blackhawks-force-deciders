The  Nashville Predators  advanced to
the second round of the National Hockey League playoffs, while
defending Stanley Cup champion Chicago Blackhawks and the
 Philadelphia Flyers  forced decisive games with overtime wins.  The Predators wrapped up their first postseason series win
with a 4-2 victory over the Anaheim Ducks last night. Nick Spaling got his second goal of the game with four minutes and 53
seconds to play to break a 2-2 tie. David Legwand ensured the
home team won the series by four games to two with an empty-net
goal 10 seconds from the end at Bridgestone Arena in Nashville.  The defending NHL champion Blackhawks won their third
straight game against the  Vancouver Canucks  when Ben Smith
scored 15:30 into overtime for a 4-3 win at United Center in
Chicago.  Chicago is seeking to become the fourth team to overcome a
three-game deficit to win an NHL playoff series. The 2010
Flyers, 1975 New York Islanders and 1942 Toronto Maple Leafs are
the only teams to achieve the feat.  At HSBC Arena in Buffalo, New York, Ville Leino scored 4:43
into overtime as the Flyers beat the Buffalo Sabres 5-4.  Philadelphia and Vancouver are scheduled to host the
deciding games on April 26.  Tonight, the  Pittsburgh Penguins  and San Jose Sharks can
advance to the second round with wins.  The Penguins and the Sharks both lead their series by three
games to two going into Games 6 against hosts the Tampa Bay
Lightning and the  Los Angeles Kings , respectively.  To contact the reporter on this story:
