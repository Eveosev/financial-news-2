Compania de Minas Buenaventura SAA,
 Peru ’s biggest precious-metals miner, said operations resumed at
its Uchucchacua silver mine after villagers ended a 21-day
roadblock.  The stoppage, which began as a contract workers’ strike
April 4, ended after the local town hall and the community
agreed to build public works, Chief Financial Officer Carlos Galvez said today in a telephone interview. Fighting between
protesters and police left one dead, he said.  “We’ve lost three weeks of silver production, but we can
try to make up for it by tapping higher ore grades,” he said.  Workers in Peru, Chile and Bolivia have held work stoppages
at copper, gold and zinc mines in the past six months to seek
better working conditions and a greater share of record company
earnings. A 13-day strike at zinc miner Cia. Minera de San
Ignacio de Morococha SA ended Feb. 17.  Uchuchaccua’s silver output fell 12 percent last year to
9.3 million ounces, according to Buenaventura’s website. Galvez
declined to confirm the amount of lost production.  Buenaventura fell 3.6 percent, or $1.45, to $38.70 in  New
York  Stock Exchange composite trading. The company is scheduled
to publish first-quarter earnings on April 28.  Silver for immediate delivery rose to a record today in
 London , exceeding a previous peak set in 1980. Silver for July
delivery climbed 1.1 cents, or 2.4 percent, to settle at $47.173
an ounce on the Comex in New York. In electronic trading, the
price touched $49.845, the highest price since January 1980, the
year futures reached a record $50.35.  To contact the reporter on this story:
