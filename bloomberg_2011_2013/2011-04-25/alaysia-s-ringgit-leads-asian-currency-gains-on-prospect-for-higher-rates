Malaysia ’s ringgit and Indonesia’s
rupiah led gains among Asian currencies on speculation central
banks in the region will raise interest rates to help damp
inflation, adding to the yield premium on local assets.  The ringgit strengthened beyond 3 to the dollar for the
first time in more than 13 years after the government reported
the fastest inflation in 23 months on April 20. Funds are
flowing in to emerging markets as economists forecast policy
makers in Japan and the U.S. will keep their benchmark rates
near zero this week.  “It’s very clear that some Asian countries will keep
raising rates more while their economies are strong enough to
see more hikes,” said  Hideki Hayashi , a global economist at
Mizuho Securities Co. in  Tokyo . “On the other hand, market
players expect the U.S. this week to suggest it would keep low
rates for some time, which means more yield appeal for  Asia .”  The ringgit climbed 0.4 percent to 2.9925 per dollar as of
4:03 p.m. in Kuala Lumpur and reached 2.9910, the highest level
since October 1997, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
rupiah rose 0.3 percent to 8,604 from April 21 and the peso
gained 0.2 percent to 43.185 from April 20, the last onshore
trading days before their public holiday.  China , India, South Korea, Indonesia, Thailand, the
Philippines and Taiwan all boosted borrowing costs this year to
tame inflation. The Monetary Authority of  Singapore  said this
month it will allow the Singapore dollar to strengthen, sending
the local currency to the strongest level since at least 1981,
when Bloomberg began tracking the data.  Rising Prices  Benchmark  interest rates  in India and Indonesia are 6.75
percent and in China 6.31 percent, compared with a maximum 0.25
percent in the U.S. and Japan. Bank Negara Malaysia, which has
kept its overnight rate at 2.75 percent since July after raising
it three times earlier in 2010, next meets on May 5.  “We could expect the ringgit to strengthen to counter
inflation, given that there’s a small probability of a rate
increase in May,” said Saktiandi Supaat, head of foreign-
exchange research in Singapore at Malayan Banking Bhd. “It’s
also helped by the dollar weakness.”  Consumer prices in Malaysia rose 3 percent in March from a
year earlier, the most since April 2009, the statistics
department said on April 20.  Fund Inflows  The  Philippine peso  gained the most in more than two weeks
as the Philippine Stock Exchange Composite Index rose 1.3
percent.  The  Federal Reserve  will keep its target rate for overnight
loans between banks between zero and 0.25 percent when it meets
on April 27, according to all 80 economists in a Bloomberg News
survey.  “The movement is mostly related to the weaker dollar and
the positive sentiment in the equities market,” said Lito Biacora, vice president for treasury at Bank of the Philippine
Islands in  Manila .  Elsewhere, the Singapore dollar added 0.1 percent to
S$1.2334 against the greenback from April 21 before a public
holiday on April 22, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
India’s rupee fell 0.2 percent to 44.445 from April 21. China’s
yuan lost 0.29 percent to 6.5255 and  South Korea ’s won slid 0.1
percent to 1,081.35.  To contact the reporter on this story:
