Netflix Inc. (NFLX) , the DVD and online
film-rental service, fell in extended trading after its second-
quarter profit forecast missed analysts’ predictions.  Net income will be $50 million to $62 million, or 93 cents
to $1.15 a share, the company said today in a  statement  online.
Netflix projects sales of as much as $798 million. Analysts were
estimating profit of $1.18 a share on revenue of $767.5 million.  Netflix, based in  Los Gatos ,  California , fell $12.22, or
4.9 percent, to $239.45 in extended trading after the results
were out. The shares lost 55 cents to $251.67 at 4 p.m. New York
time in Nasdaq Stock Market trading.  First-quarter net income grew to $60 million, or $1.11 a
share, from $32 million, or 59 cents, a year earlier, according
to the statement. Sales increased 46 percent to $719 million,
beating analysts’ projections of $706.1 million.  The company signed up 3.59 million new users to reach 23.6
million worldwide after saying three months ago it could reach
as many as 23.7 million by March. Chief Executive Officer Reed Hastings has said Netflix will support its online business by
purchasing rights to additional films and TV shows.  Analysts predicted first-quarter profit of $1.07 the
average of 24 analysts’ estimates in a Bloomberg survey.  The company is likely to focus its efforts the rest of the
year on international expansion and fending off increasing
competition from streaming services offered by  Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) 
and Hulu.com, George Askew, a Stifel Nicolaus & Co. analyst who
has a “hold” rating on the stock, said in a research note to
investors today.  “Hulu.com continues to gain traction, as the streaming
service expects to top 1 million subscribers and generate over
$500 million in revenue in 2011,” Askew wrote.  Netflix may reach almost 30 million subscribers by the end
of year, and pass  Time Warner Inc. (TWX) ’s  HBO  early next year, Scott Devitt, a Morgan Stanley analyst who has an “equal weight”
rating on the stock, said in a research note.  (Netflix plans a conference call at 6 p.m. New York time.
