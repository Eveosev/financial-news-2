Corn gained the most in three weeks
and wheat jumped to a two-month high as adverse weather
threatened crops from the U.S. to  China . Soybeans rose to the
highest in two weeks.  Corn fields from Montana to Ohio got more than twice the
normal rainfall over the past 30 days, and April may be the
wettest on record in Indiana, Ohio and Illinois, according to  T-
Storm Weather LLC  in Chicago. Dry weather in the southern U.S.
Great Plains, China and parts of  Europe  will increase stress on
wheat crops, the forecaster said today in a report.  “Weather continues to boost grain markets,” said  Mark Schultz , the chief analyst at Northstar Commodity Investment Co.
in Minneapolis. “The markets are concerned about reduced global
production, and are adding some weather premium.”  Corn futures for July delivery rose 24 cents, or 3.2
percent, to close at $7.685 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the  Chicago 
Board of Trade, the biggest gain since April 4. The grain has
more than doubled in the past 12 months as global production
trailed gains in demand for livestock feed and biofuels.  Wheat futures for July delivery rose 26.5 cents, or 3.2
percent, to settle at $8.6125 a bushel on the CBOT, after
touching $8.65, the highest since Feb. 22. The commodity has
climbed 70 percent in the past year as drought spurred Russia to
ban exports, while floods eroded crops in  Canada  and  Australia .  U.S. corn acreage this year will be the second-largest
since 1944, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said on March 31.
Soybean acres are forecast to drop, while wheat may climb.  Soybean futures for July delivery rose 6.75 cents, or 0.5
percent, to close at $13.965 a bushel in Chicago. Earlier, the
price touched $13.985, the highest since April 11. The most-
active contract has risen 38 percent in the past year on record
Chinese demand for U.S. supplies.  Corn, the main ingredient in livestock feed, is the biggest
U.S. crop, valued at $66.7 billion in 2010, followed by soybeans
at $38.9 billion, government figures show. Wheat is the fourth-
largest, behind hay, at $13 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
