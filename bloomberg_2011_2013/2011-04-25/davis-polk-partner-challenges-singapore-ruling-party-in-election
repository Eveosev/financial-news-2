Chen Show-Mao, the head of Wall
Street law firm Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP’s Beijing office, said
he will seek election to  Singapore ’s parliament as a candidate
for the opposition  Workers’ Party .  “The best way to ensure good governance for Singapore is
through the growth of a competitive opposition that offers a
credible alternative to the party in government,” Chen, 50,
said on his profile on the party’s  website  today.  Singapore, scheduled to hold its elections on May 7, has
been administered by the People’s Action Party since 1959, when
the city state was still a self-governing British colony. The
ruling party, led by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, holds 82 of
the 84 elected seats in Parliament and won about 67 percent of
votes in the last election in 2006, 8 percentage points lower
than the previous poll.  Chen has advised on the record initial public offering of
$22.1 billion by  Agricultural Bank of China  in July and
Industrial and Commercial Bank of  China  Ltd.’s $21 billion
initial share sale. ICBC, based in Beijing, is the world’s
largest lender by market value.  Chen, who  came to Singapore from Taiwan  when he was 11 in
1972, according to a July 1986 Straits Times report, was
 educated  at  Harvard University , the University of Oxford as a
Rhodes Scholar, and  Stanford Law School . He joined Davis Polk,
which has  750 lawyers in nine offices , in its New York head
office in 1992 and set up the firm’s Beijing office in 2007.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
