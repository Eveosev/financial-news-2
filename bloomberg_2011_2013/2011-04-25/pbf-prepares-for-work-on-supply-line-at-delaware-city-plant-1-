PBF Energy Co. LLC’s  Delaware  City,
Delaware, refinery purged natural gas from supply lines to the
power house to install new meters, according to a filing with
state regulators.  Emissions associated with the purge began April 21 at 10:17
a.m. local time and lasted about 13 hours, according to the
 filing .  A phone call before normal working hours today seeking
comment from Michael Gayda, president of Parsippany, New Jersey-
based PBF Energy, was not immediately returned.  The 182,200-barrel-a-day plant is on schedule to start in
the second quarter, with oil going in about May 1, PBF Energy
Chairman Thomas O’Malley told reporters at the National
Petrochemical and Refiners’ Association annual meeting in  San
Antonio  on March 22.  PBF Energy, formed in 2008 to acquire refineries in the
U.S. and backed by private-equity firms Blackstone Group LP and
First Reserve Corp., bought the Delaware City plant from Valero
Energy Corp. for $220 million in June. The refinery has been
shut since November 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
