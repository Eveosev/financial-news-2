A boat carrying as many as 118
people capsized on Lake Kivu in eastern  Democratic Republic of
Congo  last night, killing at least 38, the  Red Cross  said.  The boat was traveling in high winds from Minova, a town
near the border of North and  South Kivu  provinces, to Bukavu,
South Kivu’s provincial capital, said Desire Yuma, Red Cross
director for South Kivu.  “Our team has found 11 survivors and recovered 38
bodies,” Yuma said by phone from Bukavu. “The search will
continue until tomorrow.”  The motorized wooden boat was transporting goods to the
market in Bukavu and was overloaded with passengers, Yuma said.
Maritime traffic on Lake Kivu, which runs along Congo’s border
with  Rwanda , is often unregulated and accidents are common, Yuma
said.  United Nations peacekeepers are flying reconnaissance
missions over the site of the accident, Alexandre Essome, a UN
spokesman for North Kivu province, said by phone from Goma, the
provincial capital. The 11 rescued survivors were transferred to
a hospital in Goma, Yuma said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
