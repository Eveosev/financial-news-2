OAO Polymetal, a Russian producer
of gold and silver, headed for its biggest advance in more than
a week as silver climbed to a record high.  The stock increased 3.5 percent to 563 rubles as of 1:31
p.m. in Moscow. A close at that level would mark its strongest
gain since April 15.  Silver for immediate delivery added as much as 5.4 percent
to $49.79 per ounce, beating the previous peak, which according
to research company GFMS Ltd. was $49.45 in 1980. The metal was
at $49.0788 at 2:40 p.m. in  Singapore , up for a ninth day and
set for the longest winning run since an 11-day gain in March
2008. Spot gold also reached a record.  To contact the reporter on this story:
