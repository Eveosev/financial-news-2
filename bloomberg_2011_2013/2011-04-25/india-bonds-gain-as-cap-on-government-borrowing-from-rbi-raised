India ’s bonds dropped, pushing
yields to a 10-week high, on speculation costlier oil may prompt
fuel-price increases and stoke inflation.  Crude prices in  New York  have jumped 24 percent this year,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. India imports more than
three quarters of its oil. Indian Oil Corp. plans to raise
gasoline prices at the earliest possible, Chairman R.S. Butola
said in  New Delhi  today.  “The possibility of a fuel price increase soon has damped
sentiment,” said Prasanna Patankar, head of fixed-income
trading at Securities Trading Corp. of India Ltd. “Inflation
concerns are very much there.”  The yield on the 7.80 percent note maturing April 2021, the
most-traded government security, rose six basis points to 8.12
percent as of the 5 p.m. close in Mumbai, according to the
central bank’s trading system. The rate was the highest level
since Feb. 14.  The wholesale  price index  rose 8.98 percent in March from a
year earlier, compared with 8.31 percent in February, the
commerce ministry said in a statement on April 15.  Persistent inflation particularly in food products is a
cause for concern, Prime Minister  Manmohan Singh  said last week.
Singh is betting on normal rainfall this year to boost farm
output and tame food inflation, which averaged 18 percent in
2010.  The cost of one-year interest-rate swaps, or derivative
contracts used to guard against fluctuations in borrowing costs,
rose three basis points to 7.83 percent, the highest level since
October 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
