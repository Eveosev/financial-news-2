Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , the world’s
biggest carmaker, said its global output fell 30 percent to
542,465 vehicles in March, led by a drop in  Japan  after a
record earthquake disrupted production.  Production in Japan plunged 63 percent to 129,491
vehicles, the company said in a statement today. Exports
declined 33 percent to 107,751, the Toyota City-based car
company said.  Toyota, Honda Motor Co. and Nissan Motor Co. are working
to restore full operations after last month’s magnitude-9
temblor and tsunami damaged factories and caused parts and
power shortages. Toyota’s lead over General Motors Co. and
Volkswagen AG, the second and third-largest carmakers, may be
narrowed this year as the Japanese company expects production
may not return to normal until December.  “Japanese carmakers’ biggest problem is that they want
to keep core technology for key components in Japan,” said
 John Zeng , a Shanghai-based analyst for researcher J.D. Power
& Associates. Those components include computer chips and key
engine parts, he said.  Renesas Electronics Corp., a chipmaker that has 30
percent of the world market for microcontrollers used in cars,
said April 22 it will restart production at a damaged factory
on June 15, prompting Toyota to say production will return to
normal levels by December at the latest.  Shares in Toyota fell 0.6 percent to 3,275 yen today as
of the 3 p.m. close in Tokyo. The company has lost 10 percent
since March 10, the day before the earthquake. Nissan,
Japan’s second-largest carmaker, has declined 7 percent,
while third-ranked Honda has fallen 8.7 percent.  Lost Production  Toyota may lose production of 300,000 vehicles in Japan
and 100,000 overseas through the end of April due to quake-
related shutdowns, Executive Vice President Atsushi Niimi
said last week. The company is unlikely to meet its full-year
global production target of 7.7 million vehicles, he said.  About 150 parts, mostly materials such as rubber and
plastics, are still in critically short supply President  Akio Toyoda  said April 22.  While Toyota has increased local procurement rates for
overseas production, investigations since the quake have
shown that many second- and third-tier components still come
from Japan, Executive Vice President Shinichi Sasaki said
last week. Toyota may ask tier-one suppliers to raise their
own local procurement rates to reduce their reliance on Japan,
he said.  Fiscal 2010  Toyota made 7.34 million vehicles in the fiscal year
ended March 31, an increase of 0.9 percent from the previous
12 months, the company said today.  Honda’s March output fell 19 percent to 282,254 vehicles,
with Japan production dropping 63 percent to 34,754. Nissan
increased production 9 percent to 382,704 vehicles even as
output at domestic factories declined 52 percent to 47,590.  Honda’s car and parts output in Japan will remain at 50
percent of regular capacity until the end of June, the
company said today. Production will return to normal levels
by the end of the year, it said.  Japanese carmakers also face possible blackouts after
the natural disasters reduced the nation’s power-generating
capacity by 8 percent. Automakers are considering
electricity-saving options such as shutting plants and
offices for two days a week and shifting work to weekends to
conserve power.  To contact the reporter on this story:
