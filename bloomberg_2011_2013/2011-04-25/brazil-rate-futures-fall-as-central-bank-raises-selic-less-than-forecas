Yields on short-term Brazilian
interest-rate futures contracts fell, while those maturing in
October and beyond rose after the central bank increased
borrowing costs last week less than economists expected.  Yields on the futures contract due in May fell two basis
points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 11.90 percent at 5:09 p.m.
in  New York . The yield on the contract due in June fell 6 basis
points to 11.90 percent. Yields on the contract due in January
rose 6 basis points to 12.29 percent.  Policy makers raised the benchmark Selic rate on April 20
by 25 basis points to 12 percent, less than the 50 basis point
median estimate of 58 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Yields on
longer-term contracts are rising on speculation that the central
bank may need to step up rate increases in the future, said
 Andre Perfeito , chief economist at Gradual Investimentos in Sao
Paulo.  “The market is going to remain in a serious discussion
over whether there will be more tightening or not,” Perfeito
said in a telephone interview. “The market is saying, ‘OK, you
can raise rates less now, but you’re going to have to do more in
the future.’”  Policy makers said in a statement that an adjustment of
monetary conditions for a “sufficiently long period” is the
“most adequate” strategy to guarantee inflation returns to its
4.5 percent target in 2012. Inflation may exceed the 6.5 percent
upper limit of the target between July and August, the central
bank’s economic policy director Carlos Hamilton said March 30.  Markets in  Brazil  were closed on April 21 and April 22 for
a national holiday.  Consumer Prices  Consumer prices will rise 6.34 percent in 2011, up from a
week-earlier forecast of 6.29 percent, according to an April 20
survey of about 100 economists published today. Economists left
unchanged their forecast for inflation next year at 5 percent,
the survey showed. President  Dilma Rousseff  said today she’s
“immensely worried” about accelerating prices.  The real fell 0.2 percent to 1.5688 per dollar, from
1.5663 on April 20.  The central bank said it twice bought dollars in the  spot
market  today, first at 1.5720 and then at 1.5737 each. The
purchases are part of an effort by policy makers to curb the
currency’s two-year 39 percent rally.  To contact the reporters on this story:
