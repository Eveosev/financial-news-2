Japan ’s Topix index rose for a
fourth day led by Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. after
Credit Suisse Group AG raised the lender’s share price estimate.
Tokyo Electric Power Co. rose on a report other utilities may be
asked to share the cost of the Fukushima nuclear accident.  The Nikkei 225 Stock Average rose 0.5 percent to 9,733.81
as of 9:51 a.m. in Tokyo. The broader Topix index gained 0.5
percent to 846.38. About three stocks rose for each that fell.  The Topix declined 9.5 percent through April 22 since a
magnitude-9 earthquake and tsunami on March 11 devastated
Japan’s northeast coast, disabled a nuclear power plant, and
disrupted supply chains at companies from Toyota Motor Co. to
Renesas Electronics Corp. In the same period, the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index rose about 3.3 percent, while the Stoxx Europe
600 Index dropped 0.9 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
