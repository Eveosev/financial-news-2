Gasoline in the Midwest weakened
after  Valero Energy Corp. (VLO)  said itâ€™s restarting units at its
Ardmore refinery in Oklahoma.  Maintenance at the plant is mechanically complete and the
sequential starting process is beginning,  Bill Day , a company
spokesman, said in an e-mailed statement.  The discount for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in the
Midwest, or Group 3, slipped 0.88 cent to 10.75 cents a gallon
versus futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange at
12:50 p.m. Prompt delivery fell 4.66 cents to $3.1632 a gallon.  Day confirmed March 11 that Valero had shut main production
units for a plant-wide turnaround at the 90,000-barrel-a-day
Ardmore refinery.  Valero also started a hydrocracker at the McKee refinery in
Texas after maintenance.  Conventional 87-octane in the  Gulf Coast  held steady at a
discount of 15 cents a gallon.  To contact the reporter on this story:
