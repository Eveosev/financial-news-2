DuPont Co.’s takeover of Danish
enzyme maker Danisco A/S may be threatened by a hedge fund
opposed to the move, the Financial Times reported, citing Elliot
Associates LP, an investor in Danisco.  Elliott Associates said it had raised its stake to 4.9
percent from 1.2 percent, and said it didn’t think DuPont would
get the necessary 90 percent of shares to complete the $6
billion takeover, the newspaper said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
