India ’s oil-product sales rose for
a fifth month in March as car sales increased and factories in
the world’s second-fastest growing major economy boosted output.  Sales climbed 5.1 percent from a year earlier to 13 million
metric tons, according to preliminary government data. Diesel,
which accounts for about 40 percent of fuel sales, gained 6
percent to 5.45 million tons. Gasoline sales climbed 9.8 percent
to 1.27 million tons.  Economic growth is spurring manufacturing, credit growth
and consumer demand for goods including cars.  Maruti Suzuki
India Ltd. (MSIL) , the nation’s biggest carmaker, plans to increase
capacity by 21 percent after sales grew 27 months in a row.  Jet-fuel sales climbed 14 percent to 477,200 tons and
liquefied petroleum gas, used as cooking fuel and to power
vehicles, grew 11 percent to 1.28 million tons.  Sales of liquefied natural gas climbed 28 percent to
804,200 tons, while kerosene use declined 5.8 percent to 716,700.
Naphtha, used as a chemical feedstock, rose 3.1 percent to
644,800 tons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
