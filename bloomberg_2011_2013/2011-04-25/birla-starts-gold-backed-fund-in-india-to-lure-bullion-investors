Birla Sun Life Asset Management Co.
began selling a gold-backed fund in  India , the biggest consumer
of bullion, to tap investorsâ€™ interest in such products.  The minimum subscription amount in the exchange-traded fund
is 6,000 rupees ($135), Birla Sun Life said today in an e-mailed
statement. The plan will close on May 9 and the money raised
will be invested in gold with 99.5 percent purity sourced from
refineries approved by the London Bullion Market Association,
Birla said.  India has 10 funds selling gold-backed securities with
assets of 44 billion rupees as on March 31, according to data
from the  Association of Mutual Funds in India . Gold for
immediate delivery climbed to a record today, with futures in
India reaching an all-time high of 22,172 rupees per 10 grams.  To contact the reporter on this story:
