India ’s rupee fell the most in two
weeks on speculation the nation’s refiners stepped up dollar
purchases to pay for costlier crude-oil imports.  Oil prices  in  New York  have surged 37 percent in the past
six months to $112.67 per barrel, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Imports by India, which buys almost three quarters of
the petroleum it uses from abroad, climbed to a seven-month high
of $8.2 billion in February, latest government data show.  “The rupee has come under pressure mainly because of
dollar demand from importers, particularly  oil companies ,” said
Paresh Nayar, Mumbai-based head of currency and money markets at
the Indian unit of FirstRand Ltd.  The Indian currency lost 0.3 percent to 44.49 per dollar as
of the 5 p.m. close in Mumbai, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg, paring gains this month to 0.2 percent, the third-
worst performance among the 10 most-traded Asian currencies.  Offshore forwards indicate the rupee will trade at 45.26 to
the dollar in three months, compared with expectations of 45.09
at the end of last week. Forwards are agreements to buy or sell
assets at a set price and date. Non-deliverable contracts are
settled in dollars.  To contact the reporters on this story:
