Crude oil slipped after touching a
31-month high before slipping as U.S. equities declined and the
dollar erased losses against other major currencies.  Oil and the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index dropped for the
first time in a week as  Kimberly-Clark Corp. (KMB)  cut its profit
forecast and shares of commodity producers decreased. Crude
failed to maintain gains after reaching $113.48 a barrel, the
highest intraday price since Sept. 22, 2008.  “We’re reacting to the  S&P 500  and the U.S. dollar,” said
 Tim Evans , an energy analyst at Citi Futures Perspective in New
York. “We have people adjusting their risk positions
continually” as prices touched technical levels.  Oil for June delivery slipped 1 cent to settle at $112.28 a
barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Futures have risen
32 percent in the past year.  The S&P 500 fell 0.1 percent to 1,335.88 at 3 p.m. in New
York, and the  Dow Jones Industrial Average  dropped 22.86 points,
or 0.2 percent, to 12,483.13.  “We hit that high, and people said that’s as high as we’re
going to go today, so I’m going to take my profits,” said Carl Larry, president of Oil Outlooks & Opinions LLC in Houston.  The Dollar Index, a gauge of the U.S. currency against six
counterparts such as the euro and the yen, rose as much as 0.2
percent to 74.268. It slipped 0.2 percent to 73.985 at 3 p.m. in
New York. The index has fallen 6.4 percent this year.  Commodities Slip  “The weak dollar is really continuing to be the primary
driver,” said Kyle Cooper, director of research for IAF
Advisors in Houston. “You’re seeing a run into gold and silver
as a hedge against all the major currencies, and into oil as
well, and all the other commodities.”  Earlier, oil jumped as gold and silver climbed to records
and other commodities advanced as alternative investments to a
weakening  U.S. dollar . Precious metals also surged on
speculation that China will increase purchases to diversify its
foreign-exchange reserves.  The S&P GSCI Total Return Index of 24 commodities increased
to 752.13 from 752.06 on April 21, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. It has risen 2.5 percent in the past week.  Futures also advanced after Syrian security forces stormed
the city of Daraa, killing at least five people, while unrest in
Yemen showed no sign of ending.  Brent Falls  Oil has advanced 23 percent this year, stoked by turmoil in
the Middle East and North Africa that has toppled leaders in
Egypt and Tunisia and spread to  Libya ,  Algeria ,  Bahrain ,  Iran ,
 Oman , Syria and Yemen. Libyan crude output, which averaged 1.6
million barrels a day last year, fell to 390,000 barrels a day
in March, according to a Bloomberg News survey.  Brent crude  oil for June settlement fell 33 cents, or 0.3
percent, to $123.66 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe exchange. Most European countries have a public holiday
today for Easter Monday.  Brent crude for June was at a premium of $11.38 a barrel to
New York futures settling in the same month. The premium has
shrunk $2.54 from a week earlier as supplies fell at Cushing,
 Oklahoma , the delivery point for West Texas Intermediate
futures. Inventories dropped 770,000 barrels to 41.1 million in
the week ended April 15, the Energy Department said on April 21.  Chinese Growth  Oil also fell as  China ’s  banking regulator  set capital
targets for the nation’s five biggest lenders above the minimum
11.5 percent ratio amid concern that credit risks may rise,
three people with knowledge of the matter said.  The move by China, the world’s fastest-growing oil consumer
and the largest except for the U.S., may help policy makers curb
loan growth after inflation accelerated and real estate prices
rose following a $2.7 trillion two-year credit boom.  The central bank this month raised the amount of deposits
lenders must set aside to the highest in at least two decades,
while the banking regulator ordered a new round of stress tests
on property loans.  Bullish bets on crude climbed in the past week, according
to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s weekly Commitments
of Traders report. Net-long positions in oil increased 8,337
futures and options combined, or 3 percent, to 289,916,
according to the CFTC report.  U.S. crude inventories fell 2.32 million barrels to 357
million, the first drop since February, the Energy Department
said.  Oil volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was 309,870
contracts as of 3:05 p.m. in  New York . Volume totaled 420,991
contracts April 21, 46 percent below the average of the past
three months. Open interest was 1.55 million contracts. U.S.
financial markets were closed April 22 for Good Friday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
