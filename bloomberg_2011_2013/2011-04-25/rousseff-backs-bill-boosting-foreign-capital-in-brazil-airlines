Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff’s administration supports a proposal in Congress to
boost the limit of foreign ownership in national airlines, said
Candido Vaccarezza, the government’s leader in the lower house.  “The government’s ruling coalition in Congress will
support the bill,” Vaccarrezza said in a telephone interview
from Brasilia today.  The bill, which would increase permitted foreign ownership
in airlines to 49 percent from 20 percent, may be approved in
the next 30 days, Representative Carlos Eduardo Cadoca, who
drafted the proposal, said in a phone interview from Recife.  Chilean  Lan Airlines SA (LAN) , Latin America’s largest airline by
market share, said in August it would buy  Brazil ’s  Tam SA (TAMM4)  for
$3.9 billion.  “In a maximum of 30 days, the draft should be voted on and
approved,” Cadoca said. “The bill is in the queue, and still
has 15 others in front.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
