CNO Financial Group Inc. (CNO) , the life
insurer that counts  John Paulson ’s hedge fund as its largest
investor, is seeking to amend a credit facility after first-
quarter net income rose at least 45 percent.  The insurer earned between $49 million and $54 million, or
17 cents to 19 cents a share, compared with $33.9 million, or 13
cents, a year earlier, CNO said today in a statement announcing
preliminary results in connection with a plan to amend the
facility. Operating income, which excludes some investment
results, was 16 cents to 18 cents a share, compared with the 16-
cent estimate of seven analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  CNO is working to lower payments to service its debt as
borrowing costs for companies decline. The Carmel, Indiana-based
insurer’s senior secured credit facility with an outstanding
balance of $325 million pays 600 basis points, or 6 percentage
points, more than the London interbank offer rate, according to
the statement. Relative yields on U.S. corporate bonds fell this
month to the lowest level in more than three years.  “The current favorable capital markets” led the company
to seek to amend its credit facility, said Chief Executive
Officer Jim Prieur.  CNO plans to announce complete quarterly results on May 2.
The insurer jumped 32 cents, or 4.3 percent, to $7.82, at 4:15
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The company
has climbed 15 percent this year, compared with the 2.3 percent
advance in the 24-company KBW Insurance Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
