Japanese stock futures fell as
companies from Nintendo Co. to  Nidec Corp. (6594)  reported earnings
that missed analyst estimates and after commodity prices
dropped.  American depositary receipts of Nintendo, the world’s
largest maker of video-game players, tumbled 3.9 percent. Those
of Nidec, the world’s biggest maker of motors for hard-disk
drives, slumped 1 percent. ADRs of  Mitsubishi Corp. (8058) , Japan’s No.
1 commodities trader, retreated 1.6 percent after copper and oil
prices fell.  Futures on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average expiring in
June closed at 9,660 in Chicago yesterday, compared with 9,680
in Osaka, Japan. They were bid in the pre-market at 9,650 in
Osaka at 8:05 a.m. local time. New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index gained
0.1 percent in Wellington.  “Companies including Nintendo and Nidec projected
conservative profit outlooks and that suggests other large
companies will follow that,” said Fumiyuki Nakanishi, a
strategist at Tokyo-based SMBC Friend Securities Co.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gained 0.2
percent today. In  New York  yesterday, the index slipped 0.2
percent to 1,335.25 as lower commodity prices drove down energy
and raw-material producers, and as Kimberly-Clark Corp., the
maker of Scott toilet paper and Huggies diapers, cut its profit
forecast.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index rose 0.6 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with gains of 6.2 percent by the  S&P
500  and 1.7 percent by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Stocks in the
Asian benchmark are valued at 13.2 times estimated earnings on
average, compared with 13.6 times for the S&P 500 and 11.3 times
for the Stoxx 600.  Commodities Drop  Copper futures for delivery in July fell 2.2 percent in New
York yesterday, the biggest decline for a most-active contract
since March 9. Crude oil for June delivery dropped for the first
time in a week to settle at $112.28 yesterday in New York.  The yen appreciated to 81.67 against the dollar, compared
with 82.23 at the close of  stock trading  in  Tokyo  yesterday.
Against the euro, Japan’s currency strengthened to 118.75 from
119.78. A stronger yen reduces income at Japanese companies when
overseas revenue is converted into their home currency.  To contact the reporters on this story:
