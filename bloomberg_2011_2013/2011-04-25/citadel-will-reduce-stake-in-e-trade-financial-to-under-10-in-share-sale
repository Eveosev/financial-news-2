E*Trade Financial Corp. said
Citadel LLC will sell shares of the online brokerage, cutting
its stake to less than 10 percent, after it sold almost 24
million shares less than two months ago.  Citadel, the hedge-fund operator that injected capital to
help E*Trade avoid bankruptcy three years ago, plans to sell
27.5 million shares through Morgan Stanley, according to an
E*Trade statement today. E*Trade won’t receive any proceeds. The
offering is set to close on about April 29.  The hedge fund will have an almost 10 percent ownership
stake after the sale, according to Susan Hickey, a spokeswoman
for E*Trade.  Kenneth Griffin , the founder of Chicago-based
Citadel, joined E*Trade’s board in June 2009. The  money manager 
sold 170 million shares in April 2009, cutting its stake from
33.2 percent, and announced another 24 million in February,
reducing the stake to less than 20 percent.  Shares of the brokerage fell 2.4 percent to $16.39 at 5:07
p.m. in New York. E*Trade had risen 5 percent this year,
compared with the 0.5 percent loss by the NYSE Arca Securities
Broker/Dealer Index of 11 companies.  E*Trade got a $2.55 billion cash infusion from Citadel in
November 2007 to help it weather losses from bad loans and shore
up its banking unit. The New York-based company on April 20
posted quarterly earnings and sales that exceeded the average
analyst estimate, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
company has posted a profit in three of the last four quarters.  To contact the reporter on this story:
