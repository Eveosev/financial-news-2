Sumitomo Metal Industries Ltd. (5405) ,
 Japan ’s third-largest steelmaker, restarted all facilities at
the Kashima plant today after last month’s earthquake and
tsunami damaged its largest factory.  The company resumed operations today at the No. 2 cold
strip and galvanizing mill, which produces automotive steel,
said Kinya Yanagawa, senior executive officer in charge of the
Kashima works in Ibaraki prefecture north of  Tokyo . The plant
will produce 60 percent less crude steel this month than in
April last year after it cut back operations, he said.  The Kashima plant, which produces more than half of
Sumitomo Metal’s crude steel, was the hardest hit among major
Japanese  steel mills  after the earthquake and tsunami struck
Japan on March 11. The company said last week it would book a 60
billion-yen ($730 million) charge related to the earthquake.  The company shut its Kashima works after the magnitude-9
quake damaged blast furnaces, a coke gas holder and port
facilities. Sumitomo Metal said April 14 it aimed to restore
normal operations at Kashima by the end of May.  Nippon Steel Corp. (5401) , Japan’s largest steelmaker and Sumitomo
Metal’s merger partner, sent more than 100 people to the Kashima
factory and offered hot-rolled coil supply to help it recover
from the disaster, Sumitomo Metal said last week. The two
companies unveiled a plan on Feb. 3 to combine operations to
create the world’s second-largest steelmaker.  To contact the reporters on this story:
