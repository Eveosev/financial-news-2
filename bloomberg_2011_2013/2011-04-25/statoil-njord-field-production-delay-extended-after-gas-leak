Statoil ASA (STL)  delayed production at
its Njord offshore platform after detecting a gas leak.  Production was shut yesterday because of operational
problems associated with a gas export compressor, according to a
statement posted on a Statoil  website . A gas leak was found
later the same day in one of the platform risers and its source
has not been determined.  Statoil, based in Stavanger, Norway, said it shut
production at the Njord field, which produces about 70,000
barrels of oil equivalent a day, on April 1 as a safety measure.
Partial production had resumed April 16 before shutting again.  To contact the reporter on this story:
