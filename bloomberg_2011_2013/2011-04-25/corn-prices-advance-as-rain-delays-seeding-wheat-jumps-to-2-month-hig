Corn gained on speculation that
wet, cold weather across the U.S. Midwest will delay planting,
reducing yields. Wheat advanced to a two-month high.  About 7 percent of the corn crop was planted as of April
17, down from 16 percent a year earlier, and up from 3 percent
the previous week, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said April
18. The average for the previous five years is 8 percent.  “Given more rains in the U.S. Midwest over the weekend, we
may see another delay in planting of the corn crop amid
forecasts for tighter global supply this year,” said Han Sung Min, a broker at Korea Exchange Bank Futures Co. in  Seoul .  July-delivery corn increased 14.75 cents, or 2 percent, to
$7.5925 a bushel in  Chicago  by 11:32 a.m. London time. The grain
fell 0.7 percent last week.  While global corn production is forecast to rise 4.7
percent to 847 million metric tons, it won’t be enough to meet
demand, draining stockpiles to 111 million tons, from 119
million tons in the current season, according to the
International Grains Council. Demand will rise 1.3 percent to
854 million tons, it said April 20.  Cool, wet weather will delay the planting of crops this
year from  North Dakota  to  Arkansas , including parts of the Ohio
River Valley and Tennessee River Valley, according to forecaster
 Planalytics Inc . U.S. farmers typically plant  corn  and  spring
wheat  in April and May, and  soybeans  in May and June.  China Exports  China’s increasing demand for corn may force the nation to
end exports and rely on overseas suppliers, Jay O’Neil, an
adviser at the U.S. Grains Council, said today. “As we go into
2012, there’ll be no more exports from China and very possibly
imports,” O’Neil said at a conference in  Singapore .  China was estimated by the USDA to ship 100,000 tons in the
2010-2011 marketing year, down from 151,000 tons a year earlier.
It’s estimated to increase corn imports to 1.5 million tons,
from 1.296 million tons a year ago, according to the USDA.  The country’s imports may rise to 2 million tons this year,
John Baize, who runs international agricultural consulting firm
John C. Baize and Associates, said at the same conference.  “The last thing they want to do is become dependent on
corn imports,” Baize said, referring to  China ’s government.
China doesn’t want “to be heavily dependent on the U.S.”  Soybean Imports  China’s soybean imports “will reach 60 million tons
sometime in the not-so-distant future,” the Grains Council’s
O’Neil said. China, the world’s biggest buyer, was estimated by
the USDA to buy 57 million tons this year.  Soybeans for July delivery rose 2 cents, or 0.1 percent, to
$13.9175 a bushel. The oilseed gained 3.5 percent last week.  July-delivery wheat advanced 20.25 cents, or 2.4 percent,
to $8.55 a bushel, and earlier today climbed to $8.57, the
highest since Feb. 22.  To contact the reporters on this story:
