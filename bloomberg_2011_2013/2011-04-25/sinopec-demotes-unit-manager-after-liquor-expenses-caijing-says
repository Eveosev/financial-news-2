China Petroleum & Chemical Corp. (600028) 
demoted the general manager of its Guangdong fuel-sales unit
because of excessive liquor spending, Caijing magazine reported,
citing the company.  Lu Guangyu must also personally bear part of the expenses,
Caijing reported on its website today, citing the Beijing-based
oil refiner known as Sinopec. Lu must pay 130,000 yuan ($19,958)
of the 1.68 million yuan that his unit spent on liquor in
September, the magazine said.  Fu Chengyu, chairman of parent China Petrochemical Corp.,
said the behavior is out of line with company policy and pledged
to clamp down on such spending, according to Caijing.  Huang Wensheng , the Beijing-based spokesman of Hong Kong-
listed Sinopec, didnâ€™t return two phone calls to his office
seeking comment.  --Wang Ying. With assistance from Winnie Zhu in Shanghai.
