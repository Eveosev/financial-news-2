SurveyMonkey.com LLC , an online
survey provider, is acquiring Infinity Box Inc., maker of the
 Wufoo  software application for creating Web-based forms.  SurveyMonkey is paying $35 million in cash and stock for
Infinity Box, said a person with knowledge of the deal, who
declined to be named because terms weren’t disclosed.
SurveyMonkey announced the purchase in an e-mailed statement
today.  Founded in 1999, closely held SurveyMonkey has more than
8 million users, with more than 35 million surveys created
monthly. The  Palo Alto , California-based company raised $100
million in debt financing in November, in part to help it make
acquisitions. In January, SurveyMonkey bought a 49.9 percent
stake in Clicktools, a provider of survey forms for companies.  The acquisition of Tampa, Florida-based Infinity Box adds
to SurveyMonkey’s suite of products and lets it offer forms that
collect users’ insights and data, the company said. Clients use
SurveyMonkey software to gauge customer satisfaction, schedule
events and conduct employee performance reviews.  Infinity Box was founded in 2006 by Chris Campbell, Kevin
Hale and Ryan Campbell. The company is backed by  Y Combinator ,
the  Mountain View , California-based startup incubator led by
Paul Graham. Other Y Combinator companies acquired in recent
months include Heroku Inc., bought by  Salesforce.com Inc. (CRM)  for
$212 million in January, and Cloudkick Inc., which Rackspace
Inc. purchased in December.  SurveyMonkey’s backers include Spectrum Equity Investors
and Bain Capital Ventures. The company has offices in Portland,
Oregon, and Funchal,  Portugal .  To contact the reporter on this story:
