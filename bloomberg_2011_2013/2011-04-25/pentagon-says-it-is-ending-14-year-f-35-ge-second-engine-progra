The U.S. Defense Department told
 General Electric Co. (GE)  and  Rolls-Royce Group Plc (RR/)  it was ending
their 14-year-old project on a second engine for the F-35 Joint
Strike Fighter.  The “notice of termination” was issued because Congress
hasn’t included funding in the fiscal 2011 budget signed into
law April 15 by President  Barack Obama , the Pentagon said today
in a statement.  GE spokesman  Rick Kennedy  said the engine team was “deeply
disappointed” by the notice and “will work closely with our
congressional supporters during the fiscal 2012 budget process”
to restore funding.  “There is significant congressional willingness to revisit
the funding debate,” Kennedy said. Congress hasn’t yet taken
action on that budget. House Armed Services Committee Chairman
Howard McKeon, a California Republican, has said he wants to
continue funding. Defense Secretary  Robert Gates , the primary
engine opponent, says he plans to leave office this year
although he hasn’t set a specific date.  GE also provides engines for the Navy’s F/A-18E/F fighter.
The service is buying more of those planes as a hedge against
additional F-35 delays. GE also competes for F-16 and F-15
engine work.  GE last year had $2.9 billion in defense contracts, out of
total revenue of $150.2 billion, according to Bloomberg
Government derived data. Jet engines represented as much as $2.2
billion of the total, according to the data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
