Emaar Properties PJSC (EMAAR)  slid the most
in more than a month after the builder of the world’s tallest
tower in Dubai said profit slumped 45 percent, missing
estimates, and on bets gains are overdone.  The shares declined 2.9 percent, the biggest drop since
March 14, to 3.34 dirhams at the 2 p.m. close in Dubai. They
have gained 6.7 percent over the last month.  First-quarter net income fell to 421 million dirhams ($115
million) from 761 million dirhams a year earlier, Emaar said
yesterday. The average estimate of six analysts was for a profit
of 567 million dirhams, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “Shares are pulling back, but that has more to do with
some market wide profit-taking than anything Emaar specific,”
said Akram Annous, Middle East and North Africa strategist at Al
Mal Capital PSC in Dubai. “Results were in line with the Dubai
recovery story despite the headline miss and slowdown in
deliveries.”  Emaar’s hotels had an 87 percent average occupancy rate
during the first quarter. The United Arab Emirates’ biggest
developer said earnings were driven by hotels and malls as well
as the handover of about 270 apartments in Burj Khalifa and
Boulevard Plaza. That compares with 1,300 in the corresponding
quarter in 2010.  The yield on the company’s 7.5 percent convertible notes
maturing in December 2015 advanced 23 basis points to 6.38
percent as of 2:43 p.m. in Dubai, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
