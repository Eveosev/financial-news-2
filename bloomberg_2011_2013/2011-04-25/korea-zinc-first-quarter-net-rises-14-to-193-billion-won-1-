Korea  Zinc Co., the world’s biggest
producer of refined zinc, reported a 14 percent gain in first-
quarter profit, benefitting from surging gold, silver and other
metal prices.  Net income rose to 193 billion won ($178 million) in the
three months ended March 31 on a consolidated basis, the Seoul-
based company said today in a regulatory filing.  Operating profit increased 18 percent to 238 billion won in
the first quarter. Sales for the period rose 24 percent to 1.22
trillion won.  Profit on an unconsolidated basis, which doesn’t include
contributions from units, increased 22 percent to 173 billion
won from a year earlier, according to the filing of unaudited
figures. Unconsolidated profit exceeded the 164-billion won
average of 17 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Zinc and lead make up about 60 percent of Korea Zinc’s
sales, with by-products including copper, gold and silver
accounting for the balance. Korea Zinc, which earns about 70
percent of its revenue from exports, processes zinc ore for a
fee linked to London Metal Exchange metal prices.  Korea Zinc rose 55 percent in Seoul trading in the past
three months, becoming the eighth-best performer among Korea’s
Kospi 200 members.  To contact the reporter on this story:
