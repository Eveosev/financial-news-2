Canada ’s dollar fluctuated against
its U.S. counterpart amid strength in commodities as investors
seek to protect their wealth from rising inflation and a weaker
U.S. currency.  The loonie, as the currency is nicknamed, pared gains as
crude oil erased an advance today. Silver and gold reached
record highs.  Raw materials , including oil, account for about
half of Canada’s export revenue.  “Oil and gold were quite strong to start the day, and
those have given back their gains,” said Blake Jespersen,
director of foreign exchange in Toronto at Bank of Montreal.
“It’s no surprise to see the Canadian dollar a little weaker.”  The loonie was little changed at 95.44 cents per  U.S.
dollar  at 5:05 p.m. in Toronto after strengthening as much as
0.4 percent. One Canadian dollar buys $1.0478.  The currency has gained 11.5 percent since June, and is
approaching the strongest levels since it was allowed to float
in 1950. The currency touched 90.58 cents on Nov. 7, 2007, as
deepening losses in the U.S. subprime-mortgage market disrupted
financial markets and weakened the U.S. dollar.  Fed Plans  The  Federal Open Market Committee  will leave the target
rate for overnight lending between banks at zero to 0.25 percent
on April 27, according to all of the 80 economists in a
Bloomberg News survey. The benchmark will increase for the first
time since December 2008, rising to 0.5 percent, during the
first quarter of 2012, according to the median forecast of
economists in a separate survey.  “Interest-rate differentials clearly are having an
impact,” said  Jack Spitz , managing director of foreign exchange
at  National Bank of Canada  in Toronto. “While there’s nobody
who expects the Fed to raise rates, it will be guidance with
respect to how they see monetary policy a number of months
forward.”  Bank of Canada officials are forecast to boost the target
rate for overnight loans to 1.5 percent during the third quarter
and 2 percent during the last three months of 2011, according to
the median in a Bloomberg News survey of 24 analysts. The
central bank has held its benchmark interest rate at 1 percent
since September, when it increased it for the third time last
year. The next BOC meeting is May 31.  Bonds Rise  Canadian  government bonds  rose, pushing the yield on the
benchmark 10-year security down five basis points, or 0.05
percentage point, to 3.24 percent. The price of the 3.5 percent
security maturing in June 2020 rose 38 cents to C$102.05.  Crude oil futures fell as much as 1.1 percent to $111.08 a
barrel in  New York  after gaining as much as 1.1 percent. Silver
for immediate delivery gained 1.4 percent in New York after
earlier jumping 5.4 percent to $49.79 an ounce. Gold climbed for
a ninth day.  “Commodities have softened up, that’s the main reason
we’re off our strong point.” said  Shane Enright , executive
director at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce’s CIBC World
Markets unit in Toronto. “Commodities are still in broad terms
very strong. You’ve probably just a seen a little bit of profit
taking this morning.”  Barrick Gold Corp., the world’s biggest gold company,
agreed to buy copper producer Equinox Minerals Ltd. for C$7.32
billion ($7.69 billion), trumping an offer from  China ’s
Minmetals Resources Ltd. Barrick is based in Toronto.  The loonie is down 1.2 percent this year in the Bloomberg
Correlation-Weighted Currency Indexes, a measure of the 10
developed-nation currencies. The greenback has lost 5.9 percent.  To contact the reporter for this story:
