The  Boston Celtics  swept the  New
York Knicks  to become the first team to advance to the second
round of the National Basketball Association playoffs. The
Philadelphia 76ers won to avoid a 4-0 rout by the  Miami Heat .  The Celtics beat the Knicks 101-89 at Madison Square Garden
in  New York  yesterday, while the 76ers defeated Miami 86-82.  The 4-0 series defeat means the Knicks, who returned to the
postseason for the first time in seven years, still haven’t won
a playoff game since April 29, 2001. The Celtics may now have a
week’s rest before their second-round series, against Miami or
the 76ers.  “We’ve played very well when we’ve had rest and
preparation time,” Celtics coach Doc Rivers told reporters.  Also last night, the New Orleans Hornets beat the defending
champion Los Angeles Lakers 93-88 to tie their series at two
games apiece. The  Atlanta Hawks  lead the  Orlando Magic  by three
games to one after an 88-85 win. Atlanta can wrap up the series
with a win in  Orlando  tomorrow.  Carmelo Anthony  of New York had a game-leading 32 points
and nine rebounds, while Amar’e Stoudemire added 19 points for
the Knicks. Kevin Garnett led the record 17-time NBA champion
Celtics with 26 points and 10 rebounds, and Rajon Rondo had 21
points.  The Celtics led by as many as 23 points and held on for a
fifth sweep in a seven-game series after the Knicks closed to
within four points in the final quarter.  Last-Minute Rally  At Wells Fargo Center in Philadelphia, the Heat led by six
points with 95 seconds to play before Evan Turner made a jump
shot for the 76ers to cut Miami’s lead to 82-78.  Philadelphia followed up with two 3-pointers, the last one
from Lou Williams with 8 seconds to play, to seal the win. It
was Philadelphia’s first victory in seven meetings with the Heat
this season.  Trailing 3-1 in games in the Eastern Conference series, the
76ers head back to Miami for Game 5 on April 27.  At New Orleans Arena, Chris Paul led the Hornets with 27
points, 13 rebounds and 15 assists against the Lakers. Game 5 is
scheduled for tomorrow at the Staples Center in  Los Angeles .  “We know that we’re capable of winning there,” Paul said
in a televised courtside interview. “So we’ve got to go out
there ready to play.”  In the day’s other game, Jamal Crawford scored 25 points as
the Hawks beat Orlando at the Philips Arena in Atlanta. Dwight Howard led the Magic with 29 points and 17 rebounds.  Today, the Oklahoma City Thunder will seek a 4-0 sweep of
the  Denver Nuggets  in the Western Conference, the San Antonio
Spurs will try to tie its series against the Memphis Grizzlies
at two games apiece and the Dallas Mavericks will host the
Portland Trail Blazers looking to take a 3-2 lead in their
series.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
