What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Wheat futures may open 20 cents to 30 cents a bushel higher
on the  Chicago  Board of Trade, the Kansas City Board of Trade
and the  Minneapolis Grain Exchange  as adverse weather threatens
to reduce yield potential for crops in the U.S., China, Canada
and Europe, said  Mark Schultz , the chief analyst for Northstar
Commodity Investment Co. in Minneapolis.  -- Corn futures are called to open 10 cents to 15 cents a bushel
higher in Chicago as wet, cool weather forecast for the next two
weeks will slow U.S. planting and increase risks for smaller
acreage and reduced yields, Schultz said.  -- Soybean futures may open 3 cents to 5 cents a bushel higher
on the CBOT as dry weather may slow planting in  China , boosting
demand for imports, Schultz said. Soybean-oil futures are
expected to open 0.3 cent to 0.4 cent a pound higher, and
soybean-meal futures may open steady to down $1 for 2,000 pounds
of the animal feed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
