OAO Novatek rose the most in almost
a week after Vedomosti reported Russia’s second-largest gas
producer may save more than 20 billion rubles ($717 million) on
paying a gas extraction tax, citing their own calculations.  The stock climbed 2.6 percent to 384 rubles at 1:36 p.m. in
Moscow, its biggest gain since April 19.  The Russian government is discussing granting preferences
on the tax payment to independent gas producers from next year,
the Moscow-based newspaper said, citing unidentified government
officials.  The news is “positive” for Novatek as it reduces the
threat of a sharp tax increase, Alfa Bank analysts Pavel Sorokin
and Alexander Bespalov wrote in an e-mailed report today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
