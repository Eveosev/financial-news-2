Dubai’s shares dropped the most in
more than a month after profit at  Emaar Properties PJSC (EMAAR) , the
company with the heaviest-weighting on the benchmark  stock
index , tumbled 45 percent, trailing analysts’ estimates.  Emaar, builder of the world’s tallest skyscraper, lost 2.9
percent.  Dubai Financial Market (DFM)  PJSC, the only Gulf Arab stock
market to sell shares to the public, decreased the most since
March, paring its gain for the month to 5.3 percent. The  DFM
General Index (DFMGI)  slipped 1.6 percent, the biggest drop since March
15, to 1,638.23 at the 2 p.m. close in Dubai. The measure has
surged 21 percent from this year’s low on March 3.  The decline was prompted by “below-estimate top-line
numbers for first-quarter results at Emaar,” said Tariq Qaqish,
director and  fund manager  at Al Mal Capital PSC in Dubai, which
manages about $163 million. Investors are also “profit-taking
following a rally in Dubai.”  Emaar said yesterday first-quarter net income slumped to
421 million dirhams ($115 million) from 761 million dirhams a
year earlier as it delivered fewer units in Burj Khalifa. The
mean estimate of six analysts on Bloomberg was for a profit of
567 million dirhams. The shares retreated the most since March
14 to 3.34 dirhams.  MSCI Upgrade  The 30 companies listed on Dubai’s benchmark index trade at
about 27 times reported earnings, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. That compares with about 13 times for the MSCI
Emerging Markets Index. Stocks in the United Arab Emirates have
rallied on investor optimism the markets will be raised to
emerging market status at index provider  MSCI Inc. (MSCI)   Abu Dhabi ’s  ADX General Index (ADSMI)  retreated 0.8 percent, the
most this month. Dubai Financial Market, the bourse, lost 2.8
percent, the most since March 15, to 1.38 dirhams.  Shuaa Capital PSC (SHUAA)  slumped the most since March 3, losing
4.2 percent to 1.15 dirhams. The U.A.E.’s biggest investment
bank said yesterday its head of research, Amer Halawi, resigned
for personal reasons. Walid Shihabi, who heads the brokerage
unit, will also oversee the research division.  “We are still positive on U.A.E. equity markets and see
valuations attractive for accumulation,” Al Mal’s Qaqish said.  Dubai’s index, which has declined 7.4 percent over the past
year, is valued at about 0.7 times net assets, or book value,
compared with the MSCI Emerging Markets Index at 2 times.  Oman’s benchmark stock index fell 0.3 percent and Qatar’s
 QE Index (DSM)  dropped 0.5 percent. Saudi Arabia’s  Tadawul All Share
Index (SASEIDX)  climbed 1.1 percent to 6,684.7, the highest close since
Jan. 26. Bahrain’s gauge rose 0.2 percent. Kuwait’s measure and
the  Bloomberg GCC 200 Index (BGCC200)  increased 0.4 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
