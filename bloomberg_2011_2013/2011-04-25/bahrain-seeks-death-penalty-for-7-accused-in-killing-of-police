Bahrain will seek the death penalty
in a case against seven defendants accused of killing two
policemen during pro-democracy demonstrations last month, the
official  Bahrain News Agency  said.  The defendants pleaded not guilty to the charges, the news
service reported yesterday, citing the military prosecutor. The
case will be heard on April 28, it said.  Bahrain’s security forces have arrested activists and
others including doctors since riot police drove protesters from
their rallying point at the Pearl Roundabout in the capital
Manama on March 16. The government declared a three-month state
of emergency after Saudi Arabian-led troops arrived to help
quell mainly Shiite demands for democracy and civil rights
inspired by the toppling of leaders in Tunisia and  Egypt .  The defendants committed “their crime for terrorist
reasons,”  the news service  reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
