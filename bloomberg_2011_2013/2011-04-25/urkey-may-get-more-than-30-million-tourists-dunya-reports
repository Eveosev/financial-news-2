Turkey  may host more than 30
million foreign visitors this year, Dunya reported citing Ayhan
Bektas, chairman of OTI Holding, which runs hotels and travel
agents in the country.  Turkeyâ€™s tourism industry will benefit from political
troubles in neighbors such as Egypt, Tunisia and Syria, which
are diverting tourists to other countries, Bektas said,
according to the Istanbul-based newspaper.  Tourists from  Russia  may also rise 20 percent this year
after visa restrictions were lifted, Dunya said.   The country got 28.6 million tourists last year, an
increase of 5.7 percent from 2009, the Tourism Ministry said on
Jan. 25.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
