Chile ’s peso held near a three-
month high as oil and copper, the country’s largest import and
its main export, both declined and traders looked ahead to a
Federal Reserve press conference this week.  The peso slid 0.1 percent to 467.65 per  U.S. dollar  at 1:01
p.m. New York time, from 467.24 on April 21, which was the
strongest since Jan. 3.  Copper, which makes up more than half of Chile’s exports,
fell the most in seven weeks. Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  will
hold his first ever press conference after the U.S. central
bank’s meeting on April 27.  “Copper and oil are very volatile,” said Alejandro Araya,
a currency trader at Banco Santander Chile in Santiago. “The
Fed is holding a press conference on Wednesday. It hasn’t done
that before, so it’s got people nervous: if it announces the end
of the huge monetary stimulus we’ve had recently, it would catch
many currencies at the highest levels in a year.”  The peso may trade between 465 and 470 per dollar in coming
days, Araya said.  West Texas Intermediate crude oil for June delivery fell
0.6 percent to $111.65 a barrel.  On Jan. 3, Chile’s central bank announced plans to buy $12
billion this year to slow the currency’s rise. Today it bought
$50 million at an average of 467.66 pesos per dollar.  Foreign investors reduced their net bet against the Chilean
peso in the forwards market to a two-month low of $832 million
on April 20 from $1.6 billion on April 19.  To contact the reporter on this story:
