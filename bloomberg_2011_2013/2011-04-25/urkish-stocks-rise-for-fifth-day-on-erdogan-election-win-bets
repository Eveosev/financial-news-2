Turkish stocks rose for the fifth
day as polls showed that the ruling Justice and Development
Party may renew its mandate in June’s parliamentary election
with more votes than four years ago. The lira and bonds
declined.  The  ISE National 100 Index (XU100)  gained 178.91, or 0.3 percent,
to 68,870.7 at the 5:30 p.m. close in Istanbul, raising this
year’s gains to 4.3 percent. The index recorded the longest
winning streak since April 7.  Prime Minister  Recep Tayyip Erdogan ’s governing party has
the support of 51 percent of the public prior to parliamentary
elections on June 12, Sabah newspaper said today citing a survey
by research company Andy-Ar. A separate poll by research company
Konda showed Erdogan’s party with 50 percent of the vote, Sabah
said.  “The polls showing such support are affecting stocks
positively,” Ata Doganoglu, a trader at Istanbul-based broker
Ekspres Invest, said in e-mailed comments. “Putting aside
political views, the markets favor strong, stable, single-party
rule,” Doganoglu said.  Erdogan’s government won a second term with 47 percent of
the vote and 341 out of 550 seats in parliament in the 2007
parliamentary elections, the Supreme Election Board website
shows.  Dogan Yayin Holding AS (DYHOL) ,  Turkey ’s biggest media group,
gained 2 kurus, or 1.1 percent, to 1.8 liras. Star newspaper
said the company’s tax debts may be reduced to 300 million liras
under a government restructuring plan.  The lira fell 0.6 percent to 1.5267 per dollar,
depreciating the most in a week. Yields on two-year benchmark
debt rose 2 basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 8.28
percent, the RBS Istanbul benchmark bond index showed.  U.S. stock markets were closed on April 22 for a holiday.
