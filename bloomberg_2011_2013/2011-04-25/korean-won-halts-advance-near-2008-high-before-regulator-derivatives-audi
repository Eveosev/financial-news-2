South Korea ’s won halted its gains
near the strongest level since 2008 after the nation’s financial
regulators said they would look into lenders’ trading of
foreign-exchange derivatives.  The Financial Supervisory Service will begin inspecting
local branches of Credit Agricole SA and ING Groep NV for four
days starting tomorrow and from May 2 will check on Standard
Chartered First Bank Korea Ltd. and Woori Bank, said Doh Bo Eun,
head of the foreign-exchange coordination team at the FSS. The
government may decide whether to strengthen rules over foreign-
exchange derivatives contracts after inspecting banks, Finance
Minister Yoon Jeung Hyun said April 22.  “There is sentiment in the market that the authorities may
expand defense of the won from rising too fast,” said Song
Kyung Hee, a currency analyst at Hana Institute of Finance in
 Seoul . “Market players are likely to take a cautious stance
ahead of the Federal Reserve meeting due later this week.”  The won closed at 1,081.35 versus the dollar at 3 p.m. in
Seoul, compared with 1,080.80 on April 22, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Last week, gains halted at 1,078.30 per
dollar, matching the highest level on Sept. 8, 2008 and Aug. 28,
2008, creating resistance for the local currency, or a level at
which selling orders are clustered.  The  Federal Open Market Committee  announces its policy
decision on April 27, when it will likely hold the benchmark
rate in a range of zero to 0.25 percent, according to all 80
economists surveyed by Bloomberg. Most of the 50 analysts in a
Bloomberg survey last month said they expect the Fed will keep
its bond portfolio stable for some time after its $600 billion
purchase program ends in June.  The yield on South Korea’s 3 percent bond due December 2013
rose five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 3.85
percent, according to prices from Korea Exchange Inc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
