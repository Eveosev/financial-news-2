The U.S. Patent and Trademark
Office said it’s putting off plans to open its first satellite
office and will delay a program to speed inventors’ applications
after Congress limited the money the agency can spend.  The office also instituted a hiring freeze and scaled back
technology projects “until further notice,” Director David Kappos said in an April 22  blog  posting. The fiscal 2011 budget,
signed by President Barack Obama April 15 after months of
dispute with lawmakers over trimming the federal deficit, gives
the Alexandria, Virginia-based patent office the authority to
spend as much as $2.09 billion of the fees it collects.  While funding increases about 3.5 percent from fiscal 2010,
the budget is less than the $2.3 billion Obama sought and
deprives the agency of the ability to spend all of the user fees
it collects. Kappos, a former International Business Machines
Corp. engineer and lawyer, had said he wanted to use the extra
money to make the patent office more efficient.  “Anything new you want to do has to come from this money”
since the bulk of the current budget is tied up in salaries,
said Q. Todd Dickinson, a former head of the patent office who
is now executive director of the American Intellectual Property
Law Association in Arlington, Virginia. “Most of his new
initiatives have to be postponed or scaled back.”  The program cuts Kappos is making include postponement of
the first of a three-track program in which inventors pay extra
fees to get a faster review of their applications, a scaling
back of the agency’s plan to improve its information technology
system and a delay in opening an office in  Detroit .  In addition, hiring for new positions or to fill openings
is frozen, overtime is suspended and employee training will be
reduced, Kappos said. Trademark operations, which account for
less than a 10th of the agency’s budget, won’t be affected.  Application Backlog  The office doesn’t receive tax dollars and is fully funded
by fees from patent and trademark applicants. Fees collected
above the budget authority can’t be spent without approval from
Congress, which has kept more than $800 million of the office’s
money since a 1990 law mandated the agency pay for itself.  Obama has requested  $2.6 billion  for fiscal 2012 for the
patent office. Legislation being considered by Congress would
end the diversion of fees and set up a fund the agency could tap
with money collected above what’s budgeted.  Kappos called for increased hiring to deal with a backlog
of applications that now stands at about 700,000. The agency has
said reducing the backlog, and providing patent protection to
new inventions, may help create U.S. jobs.  “This halt in hiring will cause a loss of momentum and
probably cause the backlog to rise again,” said Herb Wamsley,
executive director of the Intellectual Property Owners
Association, a Washington-based lobbying group representing
companies including Microsoft Corp., Google Inc., Monsanto Co.
and Wal-Mart Stores Inc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
