Indonesia’s rupiah rose to a seven-
year high on speculation the U.S. will keep interest rates near
zero this week, boosting fund inflows into higher-yielding
emerging markets. Benchmark bonds advanced.  The  Federal Reserve  will keep its target rate for overnight
loans between banks between zero and 0.25 percent when it meets
on April 27, according to all 80 economists in a Bloomberg News
survey. The rupiah has gained 4.4 percent this year, the second-
best performance among  Asia ’s 10 most-traded currencies as
Indonesia’s benchmark interest rate of 6.75 percent attracted
fund inflows.  “Money chasing higher yields will continue to flow into
Asian economies because the U.S. will probably not increase its
interest rate,” said Lindawati Susanto, head of treasury at PT
Bank Resona Perdania in Jakarta. “The Indonesian growth story
is also attracting investors.”  The rupiah gained 0.11 percent to 8,608 per dollar as of
4:16 p.m. in Jakarta, compared with 8,629 on April 21, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. Financial markets in  Indonesia 
were closed on April 22 for a public holiday. The currency
touched 8,600 earlier, the strongest level since April 2004.  Southeast Asia ’s largest economy may grow 6.5 percent this
year, Sugeng, the head of  Bank Indonesia ’s monetary policy
bureau, said on April 13. Gross domestic product rose 6.1
percent last year, according to official data.  Overseas funds bought $145.5 million more Indonesian shares
than they sold this month, exchange data show. Foreign holdings
of the country’s  government bonds  rose 11 percent from the end
of December to 217.29 trillion rupiah ($25.2 billion) as of
April 20, according to the finance ministry’s  website .  Ten-year government bonds rose. The yield on the 8.25
percent note due July 2021 slipped three basis points or 0.03
percentage points to 7.77 percent, according to closing prices
from the Inter-Dealer Market Association.  To contact the reporters on this story:
