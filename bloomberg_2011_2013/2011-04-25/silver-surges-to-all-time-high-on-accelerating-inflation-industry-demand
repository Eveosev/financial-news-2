Silver and gold surged to records
in  London  on speculation that China will buy precious metals to
diversify its foreign-exchange reserves.  China, with more than $3 trillion in reserves, plans set up
new funds to invest in energy and precious metals, Century
Weekly magazine reported, citing unidentified people. Silver for
immediate delivery surged to a record $49.79 an ounce, and gold
reached $1,518.32 an ounce.  “People are expecting China to be a major buyer of
precious metals,” said  Adam Klopfenstein , a senior strategist
at Lind-Waldock in Chicago. “Gold is piggybacking on silver.
You’re seeing a blowoff rally in silver, but we don’t know when
the bubble gets popped.”  On the Comex in  New York , silver futures for July delivery
rose $1.096, or 2.4 percent, to settle at $47.173 at 1:59 p.m.
Earlier, the price climbed as much as 8.2 percent to $49.845.
The metal reached a record $50.35 in January 1980 as the Hunt
Brothers tried to corner the market.  Spot silver jumped as much as 5.4 percent and fell as much
as 3 percent.  Gold futures for June delivery rose $5.30, or 0.4 percent,
to $1,509.10, after climbing to a record $1,519.20. The spot
price advanced as much as 0.8 percent.  Commodities have reached the highest since 2008, partly on
demand for a hedge against inflation. Gold and silver have
rallied amid sovereign-debt concerns in the U.S. and  Europe .
Silver has posted the biggest gain in 2011 among 19 raw
materials in the Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index.  Rate Outlook  The dollar has dropped for four straight weeks against a
basket of major currencies. The  Federal Reserve  may keep
borrowing costs at zero percent to 0.25 percent, while European
Central Bank officials signal further rate increases. Fed
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  will hold a media conference after the
Federal Open Market Committee statement on April 27 following a
two-day meeting in  Washington .  “The disdain for currencies generally and the need to
embrace precious metals is still very strong,” said  Dennis Gartman , an economist and the editor of the Suffolk, Virginia-
based Gartman Letter.  Before today, spot silver more than doubled in the past
year, while gold increased 32 percent.  “Silver in the long run really will end up in a bloodbath,
but in the short term, the market loves it,” Dominic Schnider,
a Singapore based director of wealth-management research for UBS
AG, said today in a Bloomberg Television interview. The
commodity’s 14-day relative-strength index, which may signal a
decline above 70, was over 89.  Investment Demand  Investment demand for silver climbed 40 percent to a record
in 2010, and fabrication use jumped to a 10-year high, GFMS Ltd.
said in an April report published by the Washington-based Silver
Institute. Assets held in exchanged-traded products rose to a
record 15,509.54 metric tons on April 12, data compiled by
Bloomberg from four providers shows.  “Silver is definitely benefiting from spillover demand
from gold as a haven investment,” said  Li Ning , an analyst at
 China  International Futures (Shanghai) Co.  Silver also is found in products from solar panels to
plasma screens and chemical catalysts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
