Fibria Celulose SA (FIBR3) , the world’s
largest pulp producer, gained the most in a month in Sao Paulo
trading on speculation that lower inventories will lead to
higher prices.  Fibria gained 2.5 percent to 24.88 reais at the 4:15 p.m.
New York time close, the most since March 18. Rival  Klabin SA (KLBN4) 
advanced 0.6 percent to 6.33 reais while Suzano Papel & Celulose
SA rose 1.2 percent to 14.95 reais.  Global pulp inventories fell to 32 days of supply in March,
down from 35 the previous month and lower than the historical
average of 33 days, Bank of America Corp. said in an investor
note, citing figures from the Pulp and Paper Products Council.  The “data is a positive indication that the pulp market is
indeed tighter than expected and we do not rule out further pulp
price increases throughout the year,” Thiago Lofiego, an
analyst at Bank of America in  Sao Paulo , wrote in the April 21
report. Brazilian markets were closed April 21 and 22 for
national holidays.  To contact the reporter on this story:
