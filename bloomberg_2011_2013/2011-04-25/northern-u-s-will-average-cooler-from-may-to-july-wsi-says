Temperatures in the northern U.S.
and  California  will average below normal from May through July,
while the South will be warmer, according to  Weather Services
International .  The trend is a continuation of a weather pattern that has
brought outbreaks of severe thunderstorms to some parts of the
U.S. and drought to western Texas and the Southwest,  Todd Crawford , WSI’s chief meteorologist, said in a statement today.  “There is no immediate sign that this pattern will be
breaking anytime soon,” Crawford said. “During the last half
of summer, we think that the pattern will reverse by August with
the potential for some significant heat across the northern
U.S., specifically the Northeast.”  Natural gas traders monitor  weather forecasts  to determine
whether temperatures boost heating or cooling demand.
Predictions of below-normal or above-normal temperatures may
prompt traders to buy or sell gas futures. Commodity traders
watch precipitation forecasts for potential impact on planting
and yields.  WSI, based in Andover,  Massachusetts , is a maker of
weather-related software and is owned by the Weather Channel
Companies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
