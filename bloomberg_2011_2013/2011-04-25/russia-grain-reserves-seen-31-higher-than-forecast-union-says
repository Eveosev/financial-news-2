Russian carry-over grain stocks
will be at least 31 percent higher than previously forecast
after consumption declined and farmers understated crops,
according to the country’s  Grain Union .  Stocks will be at least 19.7 million metric tons as of July
1 under the union’s “conservative” estimate, compared with an
earlier forecast of 15 million tons, Arkady Zlochevsky, its
president, said in telephone interview today. The stockpile may
exceed 20 million tons under the union’s base scenario after it
lowered its consumption forecast 2.9 percent to 67 million tons
for the 2010-2011 marketing year, he said.  The government’s estimate for last year’s harvest of 60.9
million tons is too low, Zlochevsky said. “In reality it could
even be 66 or 67 million tons” after farmers intentionally
understated volumes to secure state subsidies after the drought,
he said. The union has a harvest forecast of 63 million tons, he
said.  The union estimates this year’s harvest at 85 million tons
given the improved condition of winter crops, Zlochevsky said.
Of the winter sowings 8 percent may have perished, he said.  The country imported about 1 million tons of grain in the
2010-2011 marketing period, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
