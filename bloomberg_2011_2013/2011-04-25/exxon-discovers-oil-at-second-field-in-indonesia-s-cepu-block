Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) , the world’s
largest publicly traded oil company, said its Indonesian unit
discovered oil at a second field in the Cepu Block on Java
island.  Mobil Cepu Ltd. , the operator of the block, found oil at
the Kedung Keris-1 well, about 9 miles (14 kilometers) from the
Banyu Urip area, where it discovered oil in 2001, Exxon Mobil
said in an e-mailed statement from Jakarta today.  “The Kedung Keris discovery will be an important addition
to the 450 million barrels of oil expected to be recovered from
the full field development at Banyu Urip,” Terry S. McPhail,
president of Mobil Cepu, said in the statement.  Mobil Cepu and Ampolex (Cepu) Ltd., both units of Exxon
Mobil, together hold a 45 percent interest in the block.
Pertamina EP Cepu owns a 45 percent stake and the Cepu Block
Cooperation Body holds the rest, according to the statement.  To contact the reporters on this story:
