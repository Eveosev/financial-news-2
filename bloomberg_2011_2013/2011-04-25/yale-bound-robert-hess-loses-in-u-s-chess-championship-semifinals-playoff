Robert Hess, a chess grandmaster
who interned at a hedge fund in 2008 and will attend  Yale
University  in August, lost in a semifinal playoff at the 2011
U.S. Championship in  St. Louis .  Hess, 19, drew the first semifinal playoff game yesterday
and lost the second to 2008 champion Yuri Shulman, who will play
Gata Kamsky in the final. The best-of-two-games playoff was
forced when Hess and Shulman drew a pair of games on April 23
and April 24.  Hess’s loss came in a time-shortened, or rapid, game, and
was his first defeat in 11 games during the tournament. A
Manhattan native, Hess will play fellow 19-year-old grandmaster
Samuel Shankland in the third-place match.  “They say losing in the last round is heartbreaking, but
not even losing in a classical game, but losing in a rapid game,
it doesn’t feel so good,” Hess said in an interview on the
tournament’s website.  Hess, who deferred a year from Yale after winning the
$42,000 Samford Chess Scholarship, had a 2008 summer internship
at  Fortress Investment Group LLC , a New York hedge fund. While
at Fortress, Hess developed an interest in finance, which he
intends to pursue in college.  Kamsky, a 36-year-old Russian-born grandmaster, is the
highest-rated player in the tournament. He won the U.S.
Championship in 1991 and 2010.  The best-of-two-games final and third-place matches are
scheduled for today and tomorrow, with the winner receiving
$40,000 and the runner-up $30,000. The third-place finisher
takes home $20,000.  To contact the reporter on this story:
