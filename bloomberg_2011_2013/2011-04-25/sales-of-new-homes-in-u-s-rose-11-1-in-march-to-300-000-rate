Purchases of new houses in the U.S.
rose in March from a record low as the weakest industry in the
economy strained to recover.  New-home sales, tabulated when contracts are signed,
climbed 11.1 percent to a 300,000 annual pace, faster than
forecast, figures from the Commerce Department showed today in
Washington. The median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey
called for a rise to 280,000. Housing prices fell from a year
ago.  The market for new homes faces competition from a glut of
foreclosed properties that may keep prices depressed this year,
discouraging new construction. Unemployment above 8 percent and
housing’s struggles help explain why the  Federal Reserve  may
announce at the end of this week’s policy meeting that it plans
to complete the purchase of $600 billion of Treasuries by June.  “It’s a nice rebound from February but the bottom line is
housing is continuing to trend sideways,” said  Omair Sharif , an
economist at RBS Securities Inc. in  Stamford ,  Connecticut , who
correctly forecast March sales. “Builders have been doing their
bit in paring inventory but the problem is they’re facing
competition from distressed properties, high unemployment and
prices that are still falling.”  Estimates in the Bloomberg survey of 68 economists ranged
from 247,000 to 300,000. Sales in February were revised to a
270,000 annual rate from a 250,000 previously reported.  Stocks fell as lower commodity prices drove down energy and
raw-material producers. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index declined
0.2 percent to 1,335.25 at the 4 p.m. close in  New York .  Median Price  The median sales price decreased 4.9 percent from the same
month last year, to $213,800, today’s report showed.  Purchases rose in three of four U.S. regions last month, led
by a 67 percent surge in Northeast after a 54 percent slump a
month earlier. Sales in the South were little changed at a
162,000 pace after February’s 163,000.  The supply of homes at the current sales rate fell to 7.3
month’s worth in March from 8.2 months. There were 183,000 new
houses on the market at the end of March, the fewest since
August 1967, indicating builders are reducing construction.  Previously-owned home purchases climbed 3.7 percent to a
5.1 million annual rate in March as a mounting supply of
properties in or near foreclosure lured investors, a National
Association of Realtors report showed April 20. All-cash deals
accounted for 35 percent of the transactions, the most on
record, while distressed properties including foreclosures and
short sales made up 40 percent of all deals, the group said.  Existing-Home Sales  New-home sales are considered a more timely barometer than
purchases of previously owned homes, which are calculated when a
contract closes. Resales account for about 95 percent of the
housing market so far this year.  Housing demand gyrated in 2010, reflecting a boost from a
homebuyer tax incentive of as much as $8,000 that gave way to a
plunge in sales by mid-2010 after the credit ended.  While sales have steadied, they have yet to strengthen,
keeping builders pessimistic. The  National Association of Home
Builders ’ confidence index fell to 16 this month from 17 in
March. A reading under 50 means a majority of builders view
conditions as poor.  KB Home (KBH)   KB Home, the Los Angeles-based homebuilder that targets
first-time buyers, reported a bigger-than-expected loss for the
quarter ended Feb. 28 as orders plunged.  “A sustained, broad-based housing recovery will not occur
until we start to experience material job creation,” Chief
Executive Officer  Jeffrey Mezger  said during a conference call
with analysts on April 5.  An  unemployment rate  projected to average 8.7 percent in
2011, according to a Bloomberg survey earlier this month, may
restrain demand and lead to more distressed properties.
Foreclosure filings will climb about 20 percent in 2011,
reaching a peak for the housing crisis, according to a forecast
in January from RealtyTrac Inc., an Irvine, California-based
data seller.  The housing market was either “little changed from low
levels” or weaker across the country, the Fed said in its Beige
Book report on April 13. The lack of a sustained housing rebound
is among reasons policy makers will complete their $600 billion
asset purchase plan and hold borrowing costs near zero to spur
growth.  Fed central bankers conclude a two-day policy meeting on
April 27. At their March 15 meeting, officials said in their
statement that the “housing sector continues to be depressed.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
