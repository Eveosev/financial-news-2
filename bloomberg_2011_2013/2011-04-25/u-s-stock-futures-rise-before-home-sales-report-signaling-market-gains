U.S. stocks fell, breaking a three-
day winning streak for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, as lower
commodity prices drove down energy and raw-material producers
and  Kimberly-Clark Corp. (KMB)  cut its profit forecast.  Marathon Oil Corp. (MRO)  and  Nucor Corp. (NUE)  slumped as the Thomson
Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of commodities slipped 0.2 percent,
the first drop in four days. Kimberly-Clark, the maker of Scott
toilet paper and Huggies diapers, declined 2.7 percent to lead
losses by consumer companies that sell necessities. Yahoo! Inc.
climbed 1.5 percent following a report that board members may
consider offers or other ideas to improve the company.  The S&P 500 slipped 0.2 percent to 1,335.25 at 4 p.m. in
New York. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  declined 26.11
points, or 0.2 percent, to 12,479.88, retreating from the
highest level since June 2008.  “There’s enough to be concerned and cautious about in the
market, but at the end of the day, we will be driven by
corporate earnings, which need to continue to perform,” said
Eric Mintz, who helps oversee about $5 billion at Eagle Asset
Management in  St. Petersburg ,  Florida .  The S&P 500 rose last week to the highest level since Feb.
18 and the Dow climbed to an almost three-year high as earnings
at companies from  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  to Morgan Stanley beat analyst
estimates. S&P 500 profits are exceeding projections by 9.6
percent for the first quarter, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The gauge has climbed 6.2 percent in 2011.  Lower Proportion  While total net income for the S&P 500 topped the average
analyst projection for eight straight quarters through the end
of 2010, the proportion of companies beating forecasts has
fallen three straight quarters, the longest streak since 2000,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Marathon Oil lost 2.3 percent to $52.59. The largest
refiner in the U.S. Midwest led energy shares to a 0.6 percent
drop, the second-biggest decline among 10 S&P 500 industries.
 Schlumberger Ltd. (SLB) , the world’s largest oilfield services
provider, slipped 1.9 percent to $88.05.  A gauge of raw-materials producers fell 0.7 percent, the
biggest loss among the 10 main S&P 500 industries. Nucor, the
largest U.S. steelmaker by sales, retreated 2.3 percent to
$45.10. DuPont Co., the third-biggest U.S. chemical maker,
dropped 1.4 percent to $55.12 for the biggest loss in the Dow.  Copper futures fell the most in almost seven weeks on
concern that demand will slow from the world’s biggest users,
 China , the U.S. and  Japan . Copper for delivery in July fell 9.55
cents, or 2.2 percent, to $4.3235 a pound in New York.  Higher Costs  Kimberly-Clark fell 2.7 percent to $64.24 for the fourth-
biggest decline in the  S&P 500 . The maker of Scott toilet paper
and Huggies diapers cut the lower end of its 2011 profit
forecast, citing increasing material costs.  “They probably weren’t able to get enough revenue growth
to make up for the rising costs and that’s going to happen to
other companies as well, although we haven’t really seen the
expected negative impact on earnings so far,” said Stewart Beach, who oversees $1.1 billion as chief investment strategist
at Old Second National Bank in Aurora,  Illinois .  Earnings-per-share beat analysts’ estimates at 81 percent
of the 124 companies in the S&P 500 that reported results since
April 11, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Companies in the
index have topped estimates for eight straight quarters, the
longest streak since at least 2006, helping propel the gauge up
as much as 99 percent from the bear-market bottom on March 9,
2009, Bloomberg data show.  IGT, Yahoo  International Game Technology (IGT)  rose the most in the S&P 500,
jumping 9.3 percent to $17.84 after reporting second-quarter
profit excluding some items of 23 cents a share, topping the
average analyst estimate of 21 cents.  Yahoo climbed 1.5 percent to $17.11. Several board members
at the owner of most-visited U.S. Web portal are willing to
consider offers or other ideas to improve the company, the Wall
Street Journal reported April 22, citing sources it didn’t name.
Yahoo’s board rejected a $31-a-share offer from Microsoft Corp.
in 2008.  Polycom Inc. (PLCM)  jumped 13 percent to $58.43. The largest
independent maker of videoconference systems said first-quarter
profit was 48 cents a share excluding some items, beating the
42-cent average estimate by analysts.  Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc. dropped 4 percent to $23.93
for the biggest decline in the S&P 500. The handset maker’s 12-
month share-price estimate was cut to $34 from $39 by Simona Jankowski, an analyst at Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
