Spanish producer prices climbed the
most in more than two years in March, adding to evidence of
accelerating inflation as the  European Central Bank  signaled
further interest-rate increases.  Prices of goods leaving Spain’s factories, mines and
refineries rose 7.8 percent from a year earlier, the most since
September 2008, compared with 7.6 percent in February, the
 National Statistics Institute  in Madrid said today. From the
previous month, prices gained 0.9 percent after advancing at the
same pace in February.  Crude  oil prices  have surged almost 30 percent in the past
three months, adding pressure on companies to pass higher costs
on to consumers. The ECB, which aims to keep inflation just
below 2 percent, raised borrowing costs for the first time in
almost three years on April 7 and policy makers have signaled
more increases may follow.  The Spanish economy is struggling to emerge from an almost
two-year recession with exports leading the recovery. Consumer
inflation in Spain, at 3.3 percent in March, is higher than the
euro-region average of 2.6 percent, even as the economy lags
behind the rest of  Europe .  To contact the reporters on this story:
