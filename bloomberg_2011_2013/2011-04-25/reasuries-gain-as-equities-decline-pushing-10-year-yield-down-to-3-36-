Treasuries rose, pushing two-year
yields to the lowest level in a month, before the  Federal
Reserve  begins a two-day meeting tomorrow as a decline in U.S.
stocks boosted demand for government debt.  The Fed bought a higher-than-average amount of Treasuries
in its asset-purchase program. The  Federal Open Market Committee 
meets as the stimulus effort, the second round in a strategy
called quantitative easing, approaches its scheduled end in
June. Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  will speak to reporters after the
meeting in a new communications plan.  “There’s a little bit of nervousness building up into the
FOMC meeting,” said  Sean Murphy , a Treasury trader in New York
at  Societe Generale , one of 20 primary dealers that trade with
the U.S. central bank. “The press conferences are to prepare
the market and steer them toward the exit strategy with as
little disturbance in the market as possible.”  Yields on the two-year note fell two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 0.64 percent at 5:11 p.m. in  New York ,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. It touched 0.63
percent, the lowest level since March 23. The price of the 0.75
percent security due in March 2013 rose 1/32, or 31 cents per
$1,000 face amount, to 100 7/32.  Benchmark 10-year yields dropped three basis points to 3.36
percent. Thirty-year bond yields declined one basis point to
4.46 percent.  Six-month bill rates reached a record low earlier as some
investors sought the relative safety of U.S. securities because
of speculation  Greece  will restructure its debt.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index dropped as much as 0.4
percent in its first loss in four days.  ‘Center Stage’  “The FOMC meeting is taking center stage, and talk of what
could potentially happen,” said  Ray Remy , head of fixed income
in New York at the primary dealer Daiwa Capital Markets America
Inc. “People think they may downgrade their forecasts going
forward. With uncertainty, you get a bid in Treasuries.”  The Fed bought $7.24 billion in Treasuries maturing from
October 2016 to March 2018 as part of its program to purchase up
to $600 billion in Treasuries. Today’s acquisition amounted to
42.7 percent of the $16.9 billion in securities submitted by
dealers. The average at the past 10 purchases was 26.1 percent.  The purchase program may be yielding results like those of
a Kennedy-era effort to spur growth, which spawned a 0.15
percentage-point reduction in long-term Treasury yields, said
central-bank researchers.  ‘Operation Twist’  Economists at the Fed’s regional bank in  San Francisco 
likened “Operation Twist,” a 1961 initiative by the central
bank and President  John F. Kennedy ’s administration, to the
current round of Treasury purchases.  The Fed and the Kennedy administration used Operation Twist
to bring down long-term  interest rates , while keeping short-term
rates unchanged, and stimulate a weak economy, the researchers
said in a paper released today. They didn’t quantify the effects
of the current program.  The central bank may signal at the conclusion of this
week’s meeting it will continue to reinvest the proceeds of
maturing mortgage securities in Treasuries, according to Neal Soss, chief economist at Credit Suisse Group AG.  The Fed’s policy statement is scheduled to be released at
about 12:30 p.m. on April 27. Bernanke will hold a press
conference at 2:15 p.m.  Policy makers will leave the target rate for overnight
lending between banks at zero to 0.25, according to all 82
economists in a separate Bloomberg survey. The Fed has kept it
at that level since December 2008 to support the economy.  Six-month bill rates touched 0.0507 percent before trading
at 0.1116 percent. Three-month bills traded at 0.0456 percent
after touching 0.0253 percent, the lowest since April 11.  Bill Sales Cut  Rates on six- and three-month bills have dropped this year
as the Treasury cut to $5 billion from $200 billion the amount
of outstanding Supplementary Financing Program bills it sells on
behalf of the Fed in a program set up in 2008 to help prop up
the financial system. The reduction was made because of concern
the federal debt limit was approaching.  The Treasury will auction $99 billion in notes this week:
$35 billion of two-year debt tomorrow, $35 billion of five-year
securities the next day and $29 billion of seven-year notes on
April 28.  U.S. economic growth slowed in the first quarter, Commerce
Department data due April 28 is forecast to show. Gross domestic
product rose at a 2 percent annual pace from January through
March, after increasing at a 3.1 percent rate in the final
quarter of 2010, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg
News survey of economists.  Yield Curve  The yield difference between two- and 10-year Treasury
notes, known as the yield curve, was 2.73 percentage points
today. That compared with 2.93 percentage points on Feb. 7, the
widest point touched this year.  Bond dealers project the gap will narrow by the end of 2012
as the Fed begins raising rates next year, according to an
economic forecast released today.  The median forecast in a Bond Dealers of America survey of
chief economists and market strategists at middle-market bond
dealers calls for the yield curve to widen to 2.86 percentage
points at the end of the second quarter. It will be 2.70
percentage points at year-end, and will narrow to 2.17
percentage points by the end of 2012, the survey predicts.  The survey showed a 60 percent chance the Fed will not
begin to increase its benchmark rate until 2012. The group
expects gross domestic product to rise 2.9 percent this year and
3.1 percent in 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
