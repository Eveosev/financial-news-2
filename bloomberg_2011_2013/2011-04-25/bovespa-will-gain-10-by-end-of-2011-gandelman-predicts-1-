Brazil ’s Bovespa stock index will
advance 10 percent by the end of the year, as the government
succeeds in controlling inflation, according to Alan Gandelman,
chief executive officer at broker ICAP Plc’s Brazil unit.  “Brazil has been very correct on economic policy,” and
inflation is “under control,” said Gandelman in an interview
on Bloomberg Television. “I am keeping my forecast of the 10
percent increase by the end of the year.”  The Bovespa index lost 3.2 percent this year to 67,061.64,
following a 1 percent gain in 2010, as inflation rose to the
highest level since November 2008. The MSCI Emerging Markets
Index advanced 4.5 percent this year, after rising 16 percent in
2010.  To contact the reporters on this story:
