Indonesia ’s Sulawesi island was
struck by two earthquakes 18 minutes apart early today, causing
minor damage to buildings and no reported injuries, the
country’s  National Disaster Management Agency  said.  A magnitude-6 quake hit 55 kilometers (34 miles) southeast
of Kendari, a city in Southeast Sulawesi province, at 6:07 a.m.
Jakarta time at a depth of 18 kilometers, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho,
head of the disaster agency’s data and information center, said
by mobile-text message today. A magnitude 5.2 temblor occurred
18 minutes later 16 kilometers southeast of the city at a depth
of 20 kilometers, Nugroho said.  “There’s no risk of a tsunami and there has been no report
of casualties or serious damage,” Nugroho said, adding that
cracks occurred in some buildings and local authorities are
assessing damage.  Indonesia, a country of more than 17,000 islands, is prone
to earthquakes as it forms part the “ Ring of Fire ,” an arc of
volcanoes and fault lines surrounding the Pacific Basin.  To contact the reporters on this story
