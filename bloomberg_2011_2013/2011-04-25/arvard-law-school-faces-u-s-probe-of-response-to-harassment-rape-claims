Harvard Law School  is under federal
investigation after a Boston lawyer filed a discrimination
complaint regarding the school’s response to rape and harassment
of women.  Harvard Law School’s policies for investigating such cases
don’t meet U.S. standards for timeliness and clarity,  Wendy
Murphy , an adjunct professor at the New England School of Law
who filed the complaint, said in a telephone interview today. As
a result, Harvard’s law school in Cambridge,  Massachusetts , has
been under investigation by the U.S. Education Department’s
Office of Civil Rights since December, she said.  The violations at Harvard can be found at schools
throughout the U.S., said Murphy, who took similar action
against the  University of Virginia  in Charlottesville and
 Princeton University  in Princeton,  New Jersey . Murphy contacted
the Education Department in September after Harvard hired her to
address an issue related to  Title IX , the 1972 federal law that
bans discrimination against women on campus, she said.  “It was in connection with that work that I discovered
these violations,” said Murphy, who declined to give specifics
on her work at Harvard. “It became necessary to file the
complaint.”  The law school, founded in 1817, holds women to too high a
standard to prove sexual assault and harassment, Murphy said she
alleged in her complaint. The school also incorrectly tells
women that its own probe must follow that of local police and
prosecutors, a practice that often needlessly delays the
resolution of campus investigations, Murphy said.  Harvard’s Response  Harvard takes sexual assault seriously and is fully
assisting the Education Department’s investigation of its
policies, said Robb  London , a spokesman for the law school.  “We have a responsibility to protect and maintain the
safety and well-being of our students and to offer complete
support and assistance to any student who makes us aware of
harm,” he said in an e-mailed statement. “That responsibility
includes making sure that we have effective processes for
ensuring a safe environment and for investigating any allegation
of assault expeditiously and fairly, followed by appropriate
disciplinary action.”  Murphy said the law school has also failed to establish a
clear schedule for its investigations of rape, assault and
sexual harassment. These policies contribute to an environment
where women who say they have been assaulted may feel
uncomfortable and unsafe, which is a separate legal issue, she
said.  Jim Bradshaw, an Education Department spokesman, confirmed
that the agency is  investigating  Harvard Law School’s compliance
with Title IX.  Yale Investigation  Yale University  in  New Haven ,  Connecticut , is also being
probed by the Education Department’s civil rights office after
16 current and former students filed complaints. Yale created an
advisory committee on “campus climate” earlier this month that
will be led by Margaret H. Marshall, a former chief justice of
the Massachusetts Supreme Court and former Yale trustee, the
school said April 15.  U.S. Vice President  Joe Biden  announced earlier this month
that the Education Department is giving universities stiffer
guidance for preventing and responding to sexual assaults on
campus. The guidance stresses that allegations of assault must
be addressed promptly.  The Harvard investigation was reported earlier in the
Harvard Crimson, the university’s student newspaper.  To contact the editors responsible for this story:
