S-LCD Corp., a venture between
Samsung Electronics Co. and  Sony Corp. (6758) , will reduce capital by
about 15 percent by canceling shares.  The ventureâ€™s shares will be reduced to 660 million from
780 million, cutting capital to 3.3 trillion won ($3 billion)
from 3.9 trillion won, S-LCD said in a regulatory filing today.  The venture had excessive cash,  James Chung , a Seoul-based
spokesman for Samsung, said by telephone.  Sony and Samsung agreed in 2004 to set up the $1.8 billion
LCD-making venture in  South Korea  to capitalize on the surge in
demand for slimmer TVs that would replace bulky glass-tube sets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
