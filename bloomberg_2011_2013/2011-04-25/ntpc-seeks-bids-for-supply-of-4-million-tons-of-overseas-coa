NTPC Ltd.,  India ’s largest power
producer, is seeking bids by July 12 for 4 million metric tons
of coal from overseas to make up for a local supply shortfall.  Bid documents will be available from April 27 to May 26,
according to a tender dated today on the company’s website.  India’s coal production has slowed after delays in
environmental approvals and land acquisition for mines. Coal is
used to fire more than half of the electricity generation
capacity in Asia’s second-biggest energy consumer.  The imports will fill a shortfall in supplies from  Coal
India Ltd. (COAL) , NTPC Chairman Arup Roy Choudhury told reporters on
March 3.  Choudhury wasn’t immediately available for comment when
reached by telephone at his office. Two calls made to state-
owned Coal India Chairman N.C. Jha’s mobile phone were not
answered.  NTPC may import 16 million tons of coal this financial year
compared with 12.5 million tons a year earlier, Choudhury said
on March 3.  To contact the reporter on this story:
