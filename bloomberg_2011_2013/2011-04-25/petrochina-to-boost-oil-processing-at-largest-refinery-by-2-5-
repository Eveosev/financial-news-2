PetroChina Co., the nation’s
second-largest refiner, plans to increase daily oil processing
at its Dalian plant by 2.5 percent next month to meet rising
domestic demand.  The plant, PetroChina’s biggest, will refine 1.6 million
metric tons of crude in May, or 378,300 barrels a day, compared
with 368,900 barrels a day in April, an official from the
refinery said by telephone from Dalian today.  The 410,000 barrel-a-day refinery is losing money from
processing crude oil into gasoline and diesel even after the
government increased fuel prices by as much as 4.6 percent on
April 7, said the official, who declined to be identified
because of company rules.  The refining plant in northeast  China  processed 4.86
million tons of crude in the first quarter, or 395,800 barrels a
day, including 1.33 million tons of Russian crude, said the
official.  China National Petroleum Corp., parent of PetroChina, said
today that it will sell 13 percent more fuel in the second
quarter compared with a year earlier to meet farmers’
consumption.  --Winnie Zhu. Editors: Jane, Ching Shen Lee, Ryan Woo  To contact Bloomberg News staff on this story:
