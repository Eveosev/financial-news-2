Crocs Inc. (CROX) , the plastic-clogs
maker, won a patent-infringement ruling that may help the
company block U.S. imports of  Dawgs  and  Waldies Comfy Clogs 
footwear.  The U.S. International Trade Commission in  Washington   today 
upheld a judge’s findings that the company’s patented design for
shoes was infringed by Dawgs owner Double Diamond Distribution
Ltd. and Waldies maker Effervescent Inc.  The commission, in a notice posted on its website, asked
the parties in the case to submit arguments on the appropriate
remedy for the patent infringement. The six-member ITC has the
power to block imports of products that violate U.S. patents.  Crocs, based in Niwot, Colorado, filed the complaint in
2006 and initially lost before the agency. An appeals court
ruling in favor of Crocs last year revived the case. Double
Diamond is based in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, and Effervescent is
run from Fitchburg,  Massachusetts . Officials with the companies
couldn’t be immediately reached to comment on the case.  The ITC case is In the Matter of Foam Footwear, 337-567,
U.S. International Trade Commission (Washington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
