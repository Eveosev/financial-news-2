Japanese stocks dropped, led by car
and tire makers as  Mazda Motor Corp. (7261)  and Honda Motor Co. said
domestic vehicle production fell by more than half in March
after a record earthquake and tsunami disrupted supply chains.  Mazda,  Japan ’s second-biggest car exporter, dropped as much
as 2.7 percent. Bridgestone Corp., the world’s largest maker of
tires, fell 1.3 percent.  Tokyo Electric  Power Co. gained 8.4
percent after a Nikkei newspaper report that the government’s
plan to compensate victims of the Fukushima nuclear accident
doesn’t involve de-listing the utility. Banks, large Tokyo
Electric shareholders, also rose.  “Supply chains have been torn up from their roots,” said
Yoshifumi Kikuchi, head of dealing at Nissan Century Securities
Co. in Tokyo. “It’s still unclear whether carmakers can get the
parts they need.”  The  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average fell 0.1 percent to 9,671.96
at the 3 p.m. close in Tokyo, reversing earlier gains after
automakers released production numbers. The broader Topix index
dropped 0.2 percent to 840.68. The index has fallen 9.7 percent
since a magnitude-9 earthquake and tsunami on March 11
devastated Japan’s northeast coast, disabled Tokyo Electric’s
Dai-Ichi nuclear power plant, and disrupted supply chains at
companies from Mazda to chipmaker Renesas Electronics Corp.  Low Volume  Trading volume on Tokyo Stock Exchange’s first section
dropped to its lowest level since Dec. 29 ahead of earnings
announcements this week by companies including Canon Inc., Sharp
Corp. and Komatsu Ltd. U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben
Bernanke  will hold a news conference on April 27.  Carmakers declined after reporting that production
plummeted. Mazda declined 1.1 percent to 187 yen, while Honda,
Japan’s second-biggest auto manufacturer, retreated 1.3 percent
to 3,105 yen. Domestic output at Mazda dropped 54 percent last
month. Toyota and Honda’s dropped 63 percent.  Mitsubishi Motors Corp. (7211) , the only major Japanese carmaker
to advance, gained 2.1 percent to 99 yen after the Nikkei
reported profit at the company more than tripled in the 12
months through March 31.  Makers of tires and other rubber products had the biggest
drop among the Topix’s 33 industry groups on concern that
reduced output at car manufacturers will hurt sales. Bridgestone
fell 1.3 percent to 1,683 yen. Sumitomo Rubber Industries Ltd.
lost 1.4 percent to 864 yen.  Tepco Jumps  Tokyo Electric, operator of the Fukushima reactors crippled
by last month’s disaster, jumped 8.4 percent to 438 yen, the
most in the Nikkei 225. The Nikkei newspaper said on April 23
that the government plans to allow Tokyo Electric to remain a
publicly traded company.  Banks advanced, led by  Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. (8306) ,
which owns 13.2 million Tokyo Electric shares. Mitsubishi UFJ
gained 1.1 percent to 379 yen. Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group
Inc., Japan’s second-largest publicly traded bank behind
Mitsubishi, rose 0.8 percent to 2,455 yen. The Bank owns 35.9
million Tepco shares, or 2.2 percent of the utility.  Mitsubishi UFJ also got a boost after Credit Suisse AG
raised the lender’s share price estimate to 413 yen from 346 yen,
citing improved earnings. Net income at the bank will rise to
742.5 billion yen ($9 billion) in the year ending March 2012,
compared with an earlier forecast for 522.4 billion yen, Credit
Suisse analyst Shinichi Ina wrote in a report.  To contact the reporters on this story:
