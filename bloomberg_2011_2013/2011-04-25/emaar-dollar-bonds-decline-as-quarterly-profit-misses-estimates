Emaar Properties PJSC (EMAAR) ’s dollar-
denominated bonds dropped after the builder of the world’s
tallest tower in Dubai said first-quarter profit slumped 45
percent, missing analysts’ estimates.  The yield on the 7.5 percent convertible notes maturing in
December 2015 rose 18 basis points, or 0.18 percentage point, to
6.33 percent, the highest since April 18, as of 12:55 p.m. in
Dubai, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The rate on the
8.5 percent Islamic bond due August 2016 gained 11 basis points
to 7.9 percent, the data shows.  First-quarter net income fell to 421 million dirhams ($115
million) from 761 million dirhams a year earlier, Emaar said
yesterday. The average estimate of six analysts in a Bloomberg
survey was for a profit of 567 million dirhams.  To contact the reporter on this story:
