Thomas Hardin, the former Lanexa
Global Management trader called “Tipper X” in the Galleon
Group LLC insider-trading case, was ordered to pay a $19,000
judgment in a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission lawsuit.  If Hardin has to forfeit more than $40,000 in a related
criminal case, he’ll be credited in the SEC case for the amount
more than $40,000, according to a judgment Hardin agreed to that
was filed today in federal court in  Manhattan .  In the criminal case, Hardin, a former managing director at
hedge fund investment adviser Lanexa, pleaded guilty to
conspiracy and securities fraud and agreed to cooperate with the
government. The SEC sued in November, saying he traded
securities of Hilton Worldwide Inc., Google Inc. and Kronos
Worldwide Inc. based on nonpublic information.  Larry Krantz, Hardin’s lawyer, declined to comment.  The case is SEC v. Lanexa Management, 10-8599, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of  New York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
