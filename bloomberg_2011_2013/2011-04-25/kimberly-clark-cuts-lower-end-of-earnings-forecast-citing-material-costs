Kimberly-Clark Corp. (KMB) , the maker of
Scott toilet paper and Huggies diapers, cut the lower end of its
2011 profit forecast, citing increasing materials costs. The
shares fell the most in six months.  Excluding restructuring costs, earnings will be at least
$4.80 a share, compared with a previous minimum of $4.90, the
Dallas-based company said today in a statement. That compares
with the $4.95 average of estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  The company more than doubled its estimate for raw
materials expense inflation this year. To help counter the
increase, Chief Executive Officer Tom Falk plans to raise prices
for most of the items Kimberly-Clark sells in  North America  and
bring down costs to obtain goods.  “Even with pricing going up, we expect estimates to go to
the low end of the range,” John Faucher, an analyst at J.P.
Morgan Securities in  New York , said in a note today. He has a
neutral rating on the shares.  Kimberly-Clark fell $1.81, or 2.7 percent, to $64.24 at
4:01 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The drop
was the biggest since Oct. 26.  First-quarter net income fell 8.9 percent to $350 million,
or 86 cents a share, from $384 million, or 92 cents, a year
earlier. Excluding costs to reorganize the pulp and tissue
business, profit was $1.09, compared with the $1.17 average of
estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  First-quarter sales rose 4 percent to $5.03 billion,
compared with the $4.98 billion average analyst estimate.  Kimberly-Clark now estimates that price increases for pulp,
resin and other items needed to make its products could total
$450 million to $550 million this year, from a previous forecast
of up to $250 million. The company’s tissue brands include
Cottonelle toilet paper, Kleenex and Scott.  To contact the reporter on this story:
