The  UCLA Anderson School of
Management  received a $25 million donation, the biggest in its
75-year history, from John E. and Marion Anderson.  The gift will be used to build the business school’s
endowment and to support academic programs, faculty research and
financial aid to attract the best students, according to a
 statement  today.  The Andersons have donated almost $42 million to the school
since 1987, according to the statement. That year, it was
renamed in their honor in recognition of the couple’s initial
gift of $15 million, said Allison Holmes, a spokeswoman for the
school.  “Their lifelong philanthropy will have an indelible impact
on our campus -- and the opportunities we provide for our
outstanding faculty and students -- for generations to come,”
UCLA Chancellor Gene Block said in the statement.  John Anderson  received his bachelor’s degree in business
administration from UCLA in 1940. He went on to get an MBA from
Harvard Graduate School of Business, in  Boston , and a law degree
from Loyola University School of Law, in  Los Angeles .  Anderson is president of Topa Equities Ltd., which owns
more than 42 businesses involved in agriculture, insurance, real
estate, wholesale beverage distribution and automotive
dealerships, according to the statement. Marion Anderson is vice
chair of the company.  The Anderson School’s alumni include Laurence Fink,
chairman and chief executive officer of New York-based BlackRock
Inc., and Alan Buckelew, president and CEO of Princess Cruises
Inc., based in Los Angeles, according to its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
