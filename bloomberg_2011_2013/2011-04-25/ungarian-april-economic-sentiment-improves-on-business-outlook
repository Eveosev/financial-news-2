Hungary’s economic-sentiment index
recovered from a plunge in March as businesses turned more
optimistic, research institute GKI said.  The economic sentiment index rose to minus 9.1 in April
from minus 10.7 in March, the lowest in six months, Budapest-
based GKI said in an e-mailed statement.  Consumer confidence 
rose to minus 36.8 from minus 37.3, an improvement  within the
margin of error, GKI said. The business confidence component
climbed to 0.6 from minus 1.3 in March.  The confidence index in the industrial sector "continued
the unabated rise seen in the past two years and hit its highest
level so far in 2011," GKI said. "The assessment also improved
for the production level and outlook and order books, including
export orders."  Hungary’s industrial output, the engine of economic
expansion, rose an annual 14.3 percent in February. The
government will spend 16.7 billion forint ($90.3 million) to
subsidize the expansion of existing plants by  Volkswagen AG (VOW) ’s
Audi unit and  General Motors Co. (GM) ’s Opel division.  The GKI indexes are calculated based on a balance of
positive and negative answers to questions about the outlook for
the economy.  To contact the reporters on this story:
