Express Scripts Inc. (ESRX) , a pharmacy
benefit manager, fell as much as 9.9 percent in extended
trading, after missing first-quarter earnings estimates.  Net income rose 25 percent to $326.5 million, or 61 cents a
share, from $260.2 million, or 47 cents, a year earlier, St.
Louis-based Express Scripts said today in a statement. Earnings
excluding certain items of 66 cents a share missed the 69 cents
average estimate of 26 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Revenue
declined less than 1 percent to $11.09 billion, missing the
estimate of $11.6 billion.  Anthony Vendetti, director of research with Maxim Group in
New York, called the earnings an “across-the-board miss.”
Express Scripts declined $4.17, or 7.5 percent, to $51.20 at
5:14 p.m.  New York  time in extended trading, after falling to as
low as $49.89. The shares lost 80 cents, or 1.4 percent, to
close at $55.37 on the Nasdaq Stock Market before the earnings
were reported.  “The stock’s had a great run,” Vendetti said in a
telephone interview. “Prior to today, it was priced for
perfection, and obviously it’s fallen a bit short of that.”  Express Scripts also reiterated its 2011 forecast of $3.15
to $3.25 a share excluding certain items.  Pharmacy benefit managers will see more brand name drugs
come off patent later this year, which will raise their profits,
Vendetti said.  “There’s going to be a rolling generic wave that’s going
to last for 12 to 18 months. That’s going to be a pretty
powerful wave,” said Vendetti, who rates the shares “hold.”
Lipitor, made by New York-based  Pfizer Inc. (PFE)  and the world’s
best-selling drug, will face generic competition in November.  To contact the reporter on this story:
