The dollar advanced against most of
its major counterparts, advancing from a record low against the
Australian currency as a drop in U.S. stocks sapped demand for
assets related to global economic growth.  Sweden’s krona touched the highest level in more than two
years versus the dollar on bets the Riksbank will increase
borrowing costs further after last week’s boost. The Swiss franc
traded at its strongest level in 40 years against the greenback
as investors sought an alternative to the U.S. currency.  “We’ve seen the dollar strengthen, and it seems to be
following in line with the sell-off in the U.S. equity market,”
said  Paresh Upadhyaya , head of Americas G-10 currency strategy
at Bank of America Corp. in New York. “That has helped provide
some support to the dollar.”  The dollar appreciated 0.2 percent to $1.0722 versus the
Australian currency at 5 p.m. in New York, from $1.0738 on April
22, after touching $1.0776, the weakest level since the Aussie
began trading freely in 1983. The dollar slid 0.1 percent to
$1.4582 versus the euro from $1.4561 after earlier declining 0.4
percent. The U.S. currency touched $1.4649 on April 21, the
weakest level since December 2009.  U.S. stocks fell, sending the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
down for the first time in four days. The gauge dropped 0.2
percent as commodities retreated.  Boost in Franc  The Swiss franc rose against all its major counterparts,
gaining 0.6 percent to 88.12 centimes per dollar and advancing
0.4 percent to 1.2848 versus the euro.  “Risk on, Swiss is bid; risk off, Swiss is more bid,”
said  Greg Anderson , a currency strategist at Citigroup Inc. in
New York. “It always seems to be bid.”  Switzerland ’s currency has benefited from the nation’s role
as a stable, neutral financial center. The franc has rallied 11
percent in the past year in the best performance of the 10
developed-nation currencies tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-
Weighted Indexes.  The Swedish krona climbed as much as 0.8 percent to 6.0591
versus the dollar, the strongest level since August 2008, after
the Riksbank increased its target lending rate last week by a
quarter-percentage point to 1.75 percent. The krona later traded
at 6.1014.  The  European Central Bank  raised its main refinancing rate
earlier this month to 1.25 percent from a record low 1 percent
to contain inflation. Policy makers left the door open for more
rate increases even as nations such as Greece and Ireland
struggled with debt turmoil.  ‘Diverging’ Policy  “You have other central banks like the ECB and Riksbank,
which are tightening,” said Eric Viloria, senior currency
strategist at Gain Capital Holdings Inc. in New York. “That
diverging monetary policy and its prospects are weighing on the
dollar.”  The  Federal Reserve  may announce at the conclusion of its
policy meeting this week that it plans to complete the purchase
of $600 billion of Treasuries by June. The central bank will
leave its target rate for overnight lending between banks at
zero to 0.25 percent on April 27, according to all of the 82
economists in a Bloomberg News survey.  “The dollar has definitely weakened more than typical
measures based on  interest rates  would suggest,”  Jens Nordvig ,
a managing director of currency research in New York at Nomura
Holdings Inc., said in a radio interview on “Bloomberg
Surveillance” with  Tom Keene  and Ken Prewitt. “There is
evidence that global central banks are accumulating reserves at
a steady pace, but they’re accumulating less dollars.”  China ’s Reserves  China’s foreign-exchange reserves have exceeded a
“reasonable” level, and the management and diversification of
the holdings should be improved, the central bank’s Governor
Zhou Xiaochuan said April 18.  The yen and the dollar are the two worst performing
currencies in 2011, according to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted
Indexes. The dollar has declined 5.9 percent, while the yen has
lost 6.8 percent.  Japan ’s currency fell earlier today versus the euro as  Bank
of Japan  Governor Masaaki Shirakawa signaled in an interview
with NHK Television that the central bank may expand a lending
program aimed at bolstering growth industries after the record
earthquake on March 11.  The yen was little changed at 119.32 against the euro,
compared with 119.24 on April 22. Japan’s currency traded at
81.83 versus the greenback, compared with 81.88.  The Bank of Japan will hold its benchmark interest rate at
zero to 0.1 percent at its April 28 meeting, according to all 13
economists in a Bloomberg News survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
