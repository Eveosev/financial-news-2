South Korean  consumer confidence 
rebounded from a 23-month low and inflation expectations reached
the Bank of Korea’s 4 percent target ceiling, adding pressure on
the central bank to raise  interest rates .  The sentiment index rose to 100 in April from 98 in March,
ending a four-month losing streak, the central bank said in an
e-mailed statement in Seoul today. A reading of 100 indicates
the number of pessimists equal that of optimists. The expected
inflation rate over the next year rose to 4 percent from 3.9
percent, the fastest pace since June 2009, today’s report showed.  An economic recovery and costlier food and energy prices
have stoked inflation pressure, prompting the Bank of  Korea  to
raise rates by a quarter of a percentage point each in January
and March to 3 percent. Consumer prices soared 4.7 percent last
month and probably rose 4.6 percent this month, according to a
median forecast of five economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.
The bank will review the interest rate on May 13.  A sub-index measuring consumers’ views of the economic
outlook rose to 81 in April from 75 the previous month.  The consumer confidence index is based on survey responses
from 2,071 households in 56 cities and was conducted by mail and
telephone between April 13 and April 20.  To contact the reporter on this story:
