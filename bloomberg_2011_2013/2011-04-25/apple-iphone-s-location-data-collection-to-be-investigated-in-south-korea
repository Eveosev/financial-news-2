Apple Inc. (AAPL)  is being investigated by
 South Korea ’s communications regulator to determine if it is
breaking the law by saving data on the location of iPhone users.  The Korea Communications Commission asked Apple how often
information is collected and saved, and whether users have a
choice over whether it is saved or deleted, the commission said
in an e-mailed statement today. Apple must explain why such data
is saved on devices and if it’s stored on the company’s servers.  Steve Park, a Seoul-based spokesman for Apple, declined to
comment.  The commission also said it will form a team to study how
to better protect smartphone users’ information and privacy.  Apple has been investigated by French, German and Italian
privacy regulators since analysts reported the company’s devices
track and store data about the movements of iPhone and iPad
users.  Apple’s iOS 4 operating system for the iPhone and iPad 3G
logs latitude-longitude coordinates along with the time of the
visit, according to a study posted on the website owned by
O’Reilly Media, a Sebastopol, California-based publisher that
organizes technology trade conferences.  To contact the reporter on this story:
