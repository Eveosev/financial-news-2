AS Nordecon International (NCN1T)  will find
it “extremely difficult” to make a profit this year,  Chief
Executive Officer Jaano Vink said in an interview with  Postimees 
newspaper.  “The management and workers are making all efforts to
reach a profit this year,” Vink told the Tallinn-based
newspaper. “This task is extremely difficult as the market has
not recovered enough yet.”  The company won’t return to Latvian and Lithuanian markets
for “a couple of years,” the newspaper said. Nordecon has no
plans to exit the Ukrainian market as it expects the economy to
improve.  Nordecon, the second-biggest publicly traded Baltic
builder, reported a net loss attributable to shareholders of
11.8 million euros ($17.2 million) last year, compared with a
loss of 2.9 million euros in 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
