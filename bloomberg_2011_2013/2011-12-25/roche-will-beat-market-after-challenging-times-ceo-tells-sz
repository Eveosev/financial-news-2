the market,  SonntagsZeitung  reported, citing an interview with
the drugmaker’s Chief Executive Officer Severin Schwan.  Business is currently affected by countries implementing
health cost savings programs and price reductions, Schwan was
cited as saying. While sales are declining in  Europe , the firm
has double-digit growth in  Asia , SZ reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
