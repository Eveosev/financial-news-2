The U.S. National Transportation
Safety Board next week will examine the wreckage of the plane
that crashed in New Jersey, killing five people including two
executives of  Greenhill (GHL)  & Co.  The evaluation of the Socata TBM 700 turboprop in  Delaware 
will also involve officials from Canada and  France , said Ralph
Hicks, an NTSB investigator, in an e-mail.  Jeffrey F. Buckalew and Rakesh Chawla, Greenhill managing
directors, and Buckalew’s wife Corinne and their two children
died Dec. 20 aboard the single-engine plane that crashed on
Interstate 287 in Harding, New Jersey. The plane was owned by
Buckalew, according to a statement from advisory firm Greenhill.  The pilot, who had reported to air-traffic control that ice
was forming, stated he had 1,400 hours of flying experience on
his medical certificate application dated July and filed with
the FAA, Hicks said. The pilot had no limitations on his medical
certificate, he said.  The aircraft had its last annual inspection in July and the
flight time on the plane was about 725 hours as of November,
Hicks said.  The plane, which seated six people, took off from
Teterboro,  New Jersey , at 9:50 a.m. and crashed about 14 minutes
later, said Robert Gretz, an NTSB investigator. The aircraft was
en route to DeKalb-Peachtree Airport near Atlanta, according to
