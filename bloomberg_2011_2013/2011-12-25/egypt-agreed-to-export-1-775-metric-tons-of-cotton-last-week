Egypt  agreed to export 1,775 metric
tons of cotton in the week ending Dec. 22, the Alexandria Cotton
Exporters Association said in its weekly bulletin today.  The country has shipped 25,204 metric tons of cotton valued
at $87.3 million since the marketing year began on Sept. 1. Of
last week’s sales, Egypt will ship 825 tons of so-called Giza 88
cotton variety and 950 tons of Giza 86, the association said.  Egypt produces the world’s finest extra-long staple cotton,
which is stronger and softer than shorter staple cotton, and is
used in high-end clothing. Switzerland, Bangladesh and  India  are
the largest importers of Egyptian cotton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
