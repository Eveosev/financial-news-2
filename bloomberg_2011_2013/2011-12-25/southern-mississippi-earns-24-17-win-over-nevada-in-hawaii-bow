Austin Davis passed for 165 yards
and two touchdowns to lead the University of Southern
Mississippi to a 24-17 win over the University of Nevada in
college football’s Hawaii Bowl.  Davis’s pass to Kelvin Bolden in the fourth quarter with
5:48 left to play snapped a 17-17 tie at Aloha Stadium in
Honolulu last night.  After a scoreless first quarter, the Golden Eagles (12-2)
scored in the first minute of the second quarter when Tim Green
blocked a punt and Tray Becton-Martin recovered the ball in the
end zone for a touchdown. Danny Hrapmann kicked a 48-yard field
goal as Southern Mississippi took a 17-14 halftime lead.  Lampford Mark rushed for two touchdowns for the Wolf Pack
(7-6) and Allen Hardison added a 37-yard field goal in the third
quarter to tie the game at 17-17.  To contact the reporter on this story:
