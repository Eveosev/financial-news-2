Minnesota Vikings  running back
 Adrian Peterson  tore a ligament in his left knee during the
team’s 33-26 win over the  Washington Redskins .  An MRI last night revealed a tear to his anterior cruciate
ligament, the National Football League team said. Recovery from
a torn ACL may take as long as nine months, according to
MedicineNet.com.  Peterson, 26, who scored a touchdown on a one-yard run in
the second quarter, left the game in pain after he was tackled
by Redskins safety DeJon Gomes at the start of the second half.  “Anytime you take a blow to the knee like that, you’re
concerned about the ACL, MCL,” Peterson told reporters before
the results of the MRI were known. “I’m trying to stay as
positive as I can.”  Head Coach Leslie Frazier will give an update tomorrow, the
team said. Peterson has played with the Vikings since 2007.  To contact the reporter on this story:
