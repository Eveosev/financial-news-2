Kuwait â€™s inflation rate eased to 4.2
percent in November, the state news agency  KUNA  reported, the
slowest pace in more than a year.  The inflation rate fell from 4.8 percent in October, KUNA
said, citing the  Central Statistics Office . That is the lowest
since July 2010, according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg.  Kuwaiti inflation will be between 5 percent and 6 percent
this year, Central Bank Governor Sheikh Salem AbdulAziz Al-Sabah
said in March. Inflation in Kuwait, the only Gulf Arab state to
have dropped its currency peg to the U.S. dollar, accelerated to
a record 11.6 percent in August 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
