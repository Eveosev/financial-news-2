Afghanistan  President  Hamid Karzai 
said NATO-led night raids and home searches are preventing the
country from signing a strategic partnership with the U.S.  “Arbitrary operations and home searches have been a
serious problem between NATO and Afghanistan for several
years,” Karzai reiterated yesterday, according to a statement
from his office in the capital Kabul. “This has been one of the
main obstacles for signing the Afghanistan-U.S. strategic
partnership pact.”  The U.S.-led forces, without coordinating with their Afghan
counterparts, conducted raids in three places causing casualties
among local people, Mohammed Zaher Safi, appointed by Karzai to
investigate the incidents, said in the statement. The pact, now
being negotiated, is to pave the relationship between the two
countries beyond 2014, when the U.S. plans to withdraw most of
its 98,000 combat soldiers in the country.  NATO’s International Security Assistance Forces last week
expressed support for the nighttime raids as the safest way to
target militants across the country.  To contact the reporter on this story:
