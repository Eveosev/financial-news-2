Sudanese police used tear gas, batons
and warning shots to disperse a sit-in at the University of
Khartoum yesterday, arresting at least 73, students said.  About 16,000 students started a sit-in at the university in
the capital, protesting police violence and demanding the
overthrow of the administration and the government, Muhammad al-
Tom, a third-year literature student, said yesterday by
telephone from Khartoum.  “We’re here because we want the police and the university
administration to know that we’re humans and they should respect
us,” said al-Tom, 21, who participated in the sit-in.  Sudanese police entered the campus for the first time on
Thursday using tear gas and batons to disperse about 700
students protesting in support of people displaced by the Merowe
Dam, north of Khartoum. The clashes continued until Saturday,
before the students started the sit-in.  “They think storming the university gates will send
students away, but here we are, becoming more organized and
escalating our demands,” Ahmed Samir, spokesman for Sudanese
Youth for Change, said by phone from Khartoum yesterday. The
group has been calling for demonstrations for overthrowing the
regime since January.  Sudanese President Umar al-Bashir, 67, seized power in a
military coup in 1989. He is wanted by the  International
Criminal Court  for genocide and war crimes in the western
Sudanese region of Darfur.  A police spokesman, al-Ser Ahmed Omar, couldn’t be reached
immediately for comment.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
