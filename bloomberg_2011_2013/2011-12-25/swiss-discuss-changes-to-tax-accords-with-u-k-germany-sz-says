Switzerland  is discussing
“technical adjustments” to tax agreements with the U.K. and
 Germany , SonntagsZeitung reported, citing Andre Simonazzi, a
spokesman for the Swiss Federal Council.  The changes aim to counter criticisms of the accords from
the European Union, the Zurich-based newspaper reported. The
talks are on revisions to distinguish between the EU-Swiss tax
on interest and a separate withholding tax, Simonazzi was cited
as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
