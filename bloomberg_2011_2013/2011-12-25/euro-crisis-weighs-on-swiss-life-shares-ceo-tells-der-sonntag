The euro region’s debt crisis has
shaken confidence in the stability of the banking system and is
hurting Swiss Life Holding’s stock price,  Der Sonntag  reported,
citing an interview with Chief Executive Officer Bruno Pfister.  The financial services firm assumes Ireland and  Spain  will
not reach the same situation as Greece, Pfister was cited as
saying.  He also told the Zurich-based newspaper that pensions in
Switzerland are 30 percent too high.  To contact the reporter on this story:
