(Corrects record high date in final paragraph.)  Clal Industries & Investments Ltd. (CII) 
and  IDB Holding Corp. (IDBH)  soared the most this month after an IDB
unit said it was in talks to sell part of its stake in the
Israeli  investment company .  Clal Industries shares surged 6.7 percent, the most since
Nov. 28, to 17.80 shekels at 3:20 p.m. in Tel Aviv. IDB Holding
jumped 5.8 percent, the biggest intraday gain since Nov. 30, to
41.54 shekels.  The talks price Clal shares, which closed at 16.68 shekels
on Dec. 22, at 24 shekels, according to Noam Pincu, an analyst
at Psagot Investment House Ltd. in Tel Aviv. Pincu said the deal
will help IDB Holding repay debt, estimated by the company at
about $7 billion.  “In their situation, this kind of money is hard to say no
to,” Pincu said by telephone. “IDB wants a dividend from IDB
Development in order to pay off bondholders.”  IDB Development Corp., which owns about 60.5 percent of
Clal, is negotiating the sale of a 36 percent stake in the
company with investments in technology and biotechnology to
Avraham Livnat Ltd., according to a  filing  today with the  Tel
Aviv  Stock Exchange. The transaction would value Clal at about
3.8 billion shekels ($1 billion), the company said in the
statement.  IDB Development will record a gain of about 1 billion
shekels from the sale, according to the statement.  The yield on IDB’s 5.1 percent shekel-dominated note due in
December 2020, tumbled 214 basis points, or 2.14 percentage
points, to 16.117 percent. The yield was at a record high of
19.167 on Dec. 20.  To contact the reporter on this story:
