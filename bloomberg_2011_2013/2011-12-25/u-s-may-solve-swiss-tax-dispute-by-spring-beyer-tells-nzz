Talks to end a tax dispute between
the U.S. and  Switzerland  will hopefully come to a succcessful
conclusion by spring, the U.S. ambassador to Switzerland, Donald Beyer, was reported as saying by  NZZ am Sonntag .  The U.S. must be compensated for lost tax revenue and
current “cases” may result in a payment to the U.S., Beyer was
cited as saying in an interview. Republican senator  Rand Paul 
from Kentucky may try to block a new tax agreement, as he has
resisted many other tax accords, Beyer told the Zurich-based
newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
