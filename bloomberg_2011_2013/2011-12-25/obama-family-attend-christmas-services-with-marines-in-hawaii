President  Barack Obama  is combining
church service with a Christmas Day visit to U.S. military
members stationed in Hawaii.  Obama arrived at 11:08 a.m. local time at the Marine Corps
Base at Kaneohe Bay on Oahu, repeating a tradition heâ€™s followed
since 2008. With Christmas falling on a Sunday this year, the
president and his family are attending services at the base
chapel.  The first family is vacationing in nearby Kailua.  To contact the reporter on this story:
