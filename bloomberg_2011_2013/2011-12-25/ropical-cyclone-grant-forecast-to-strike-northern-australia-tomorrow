Tropical Cyclone Grant, a category
one storm with winds gusting to 110 kilometers (68 miles) per
hour, is forecast to strike the northern coast of  Australia  near
Darwin tomorrow, 37 years after the city was devastated by a
Christmas Day cyclone.  The storm, which may intensify, was about 270 kilometers
northeast of Darwin at 2 p.m. in Sydney, moving east-southeast
at 7 kilometers an hour, according to the Australian
government’s  Bureau of Meteorology .  Cyclone Grant is expected to cross the coast east of Darwin
tomorrow, the bureau said. Destructive winds with gusts to 130
kilometers per hour may develop as the cyclone continues to
intensify, and gales are expected in Darwin, the bureau said.  Darwin, the biggest northern city in Australia, was
devastated early on Christmas morning in 1974, when struck by
Cyclone Tracy. The eye of the cyclone passed over the city
between midnight and 7 a.m., according to the  national archives ,
with winds of 217 kilometers per hour recorded before the Bureau
of Meteorology anemometer was destroyed.  About 70 percent of the homes in Darwin were destroyed or
suffered severe damage and at least 65 people were killed during
the storm, including 16 who were lost at sea, according to the
archives.  Darwin, with a population of 127,500 as of June 2010,
according to the country’s bureau of statistics, accounted for
more than half of the 229,700 population of the Northern
Territory.  Heavy rain associated with Cyclone Grant is expected to
cause localized flooding over northern Darwin, according to the
Bureau of Meteorology.  Cyclones are rated in severity from category 1, the
weakest, to category 5, the strongest.  To contact the reporter on this story:
