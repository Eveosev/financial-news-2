Iran ’s Foreign Ministry said a
default judgment by a U.S. federal judge finding Iran, in
addition to the Taliban and al-Qaeda, liable in the Sept. 11
attacks, is “baseless,” the Islamic Republic News Agency said.  “With the repetition of such claims to back its political
aims the U.S. is putting the peace and security of the world in
jeopardy,” Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman  Ramin Mehmanparast  said, the official  IRNA  news agency reported on its
website.  The claim that Iran “had a hand in planning the attacks
and that one of al-Qaeda’s members was present inside the
country is baseless,” Mehmanparast said.  Judge George Daniels in Manhattan on Dec. 22 signed the
judgment, which came in a $100 billion lawsuit brought by family
members of victims of the attacks, the  Associated Press  said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
