Saudi Arabian Oil Co.’s decision to
halt subsidized fuel for expansion of Saudi cement makers will
affect supplies next year, according to the investment arm of
the country’s largest lender by assets.  “We expect demand to remain strong in 2012, led primarily
by government projects,” NCB Capital said today in an e-mailed
report. “However ongoing fuel issues with  Saudi Aramco  could
delay the 4.5 million tons of new capacity expected in 2012.”  Saudi Aramco, as the company is known, said in October it
won’t supply subsidized fuel to  Yanbu Cement (YNCCO)  Co. because the
maker failed to secure a fuel agreement for new production lines
before starting construction. Saudi Aramco also refused this
year to provide fuel supply for new  production line  at  Southern
Province Cement Co. (SOCCO)   Saudi Arabia , the world’s largest crude exporter, is facing
a shortage in natural gas feedstock for local manufacturers as
demand is growing faster than supply. The Arab world’s largest
economy plans to spend $400 billion on infrastructure projects
between 2009 and 2014. The country said in March it will start
building 500,000 new homes for its growing population.  Construction contracts valued at 95 billion Saudi riyals
($25 billion) were awarded during the third-quarter, NCB Capital
said. This is more than the combined value of contracts awarded
during the first half of 2011 and a 104 percent increase from
the same period a year earlier, according to the bank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
