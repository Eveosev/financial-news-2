Turkey  and Azerbaijan will sign a
memorandum of understanding tomorrow, establishing a consortium
that will build a pipeline to ship natural gas from the BP Plc-
operated Shah Deniz field to  Europe  via Anatolia.  State Oil Co. of Azerbaijan, or Socar, Turkey’s state-owned
pipeline operator Botas Boru Hatlari Ile Petrol Tasima AS and
oil firm Turkiye Petrolleri AO will be the founding members of
the organization, which may add more international oil and gas
companies going forward, the Turkish Energy Ministry said today
in an e-mailed statement.  The Trans-Anatolia pipeline is planned to be completed by
2017, when the second phase of Shah Deniz starts producing gas,
Turkish Energy Minister  Taner Yildiz  said on Nov. 18. It’s too
early to provide a cost for the project, he said when asked
about Socar’s estimate of as much as $6 billion, according to
state-run Anatolia news agency.  Yildiz and Natig Aliyev,  Azerbaijan ’s energy minister, will
sign the agreement, according to today’s statement. The pipeline
may be linked with Nabucco, the OMV AG-led project designed to
bring Caspian-region natural gas to the European Union, Yildiz
said last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
