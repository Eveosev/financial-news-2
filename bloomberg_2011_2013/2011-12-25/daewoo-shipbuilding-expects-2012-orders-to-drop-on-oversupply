Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine
Engineering Co. (042660) , the world’s second-largest shipbuilder, expects
new orders to drop 23 percent next year as shipping lines
struggle with an oversupply of vessels and falling rates.  New contracts worth $11 billion may be signed in 2012, a
decline from $14.3 billion of orders received this year, Seoul-
based Daewoo Shipbuilding said in an e-mailed statement today.
Demand for offshore products, such as drill ships, may make up
about 70 percent of the orders next year, it said.  Orders for new vessels may slow as falling rates from
excessive capacity have caused shipping lines, including  China
Cosco Holdings Co. (1919)  and  Neptune Orient Lines Ltd. , to report
losses this year. To offset that, South Korean shipbuilders are
focusing more on offshore units, whose demand may rise next year
as oil reserves at existing fields run out.  “We expect demand to focus more on offshore units while
the commercial vessel market will be very difficult next year,”
 Daewoo Shipbuilding ’s Chief Executive Officer Nam Sang Tae said
in the statement. “We are hoping things will look better in
2013.”  The shipbuilder plans to invest 500 billion won ($435
million) in 2012 to meet growing demand for offshore products,
which will include replacing a smaller floating dock to a bigger
one, the company said. The company also plans to focus on
getting more defense orders after Daewoo Shipbuilding won  South
Korea ’s biggest overseas contract from  Indonesia  last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
