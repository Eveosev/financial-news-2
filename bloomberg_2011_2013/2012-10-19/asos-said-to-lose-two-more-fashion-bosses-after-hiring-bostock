Asos Plc (ASC) , the U.K.’s largest online- only clothing retailer, is losing two more fashion managers following this month’s appointment of former Marks & Spencer Group Plc clothing director Kate Bostock to the board, according to a person familiar with the matter.  Buying director Caren Downie and womenswear design director Sarah Wilkinson are both leaving by their own choice, according to the person, who declined to be identified because the matter is private. Chief Executive Officer Nick Robertson declined to comment on the departures, saying the retailer wouldn’t speak about individual cases.  The changes follow this month’s announcement that product director Robert Bready will resign from the board after seven years at the company. Asos disclosed Bready’s exit on the same day it confirmed speculation that Bostock would join. Bostock left Marks & Spencer on Oct. 1, about three months after the London-based retailer said she would step down and posted the biggest decline in non-food revenue since 2008. She joins Asos in January.  Downie joined Asos in 2008 after almost a decade at Topshop, the fashion chain owned by billionaire  Philip Green . Her roles there included head of buying and buying director. Wilkinson has been with the online retailer since 2006.  Asos shares have almost doubled this  year , as the company pushes into new markets outside the U.K. International revenue accounted for 65 percent of sales in the fourth quarter and Robertson has said the U.K. could represent less than 10 percent of the total within a few years. Robertson has recruited over 200 people in the last 12 months, he said today.
