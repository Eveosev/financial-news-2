ITC Ltd. (ITC) ,  India ’s largest maker of
cigarettes, reported second-quarter profit that beat analyst
estimates after increasing prices on some tobacco brands.  Net income  for the maker of Wills cigarettes and Bingo
snacks rose 22 percent to 18.4 billion rupees ($343 million) in
the three months ended Sept. 30, from 15.1 billion rupees a year
earlier, the Kolkata-based company said in a statement. This
exceeds the 17.6-billion rupee median of 24 analysts  estimates .  ITC raised prices of some cigarettes in September, Nazeeb
Arif, a spokesman for the company  said  on Oct. 4. The price
increases would have aided earnings, Naveen Vyas, an analyst
with Microsec Capital Ltd. said in a telephone interview before
the announcement.  “ITC will continue the same growth rate it is
maintaining,” he said. “They have taken some price increases.
The volume fall which will be there in the cigarettes segment
will be compensated by the price hike.”  The stock gained 2 percent to 297.50 rupees in Mumbai
today, the highest close since Bloomberg began compiling data.  Net sales for the company rose 20 percent to 71.5 billion
rupees, from 59.7 billion rupees a year earlier, the statement
said.  Sales of the company’s consumer products other than
cigarettes, which include soaps, cookies, and packaged snacks
rose 26 percent to 16.9 billion rupees, while revenue from the
company’s hotels business grew 2.7 percent to 2.2 billion
rupees.  ITC, which got about 63 percent of its sales from
cigarettes in the year ended March, began selling ready-to-eat
food in 2001, and added confectionery, staples and packaged
snacks in 2003, in a bid to reduce dependence on its tobacco
business.  To contact the reporter on this story:
