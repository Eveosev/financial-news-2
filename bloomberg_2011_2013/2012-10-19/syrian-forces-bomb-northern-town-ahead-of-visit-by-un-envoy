Syrian government warplanes bombed a
rebel-held northern town, killing 28 people and reducing homes
to rubble, activists said, marking another escalation in a 19-
month conflict descending into civil war.  Nine children were among the dead in the attack on Maarat
al-Numan in the province of Idlib yesterday, bringing the day’s
death toll to more than 200, according to the opposition
Observatory for  Human Rights . Footage on Al Arabiya television
showed civilians and rescue workers searching for corpses and
survivors.  More than 30,000 people have lost their lives since the
start of the uprising to end the rule of President Bashar al- Assad, according to Syrian human rights groups. United Nations
envoy Lakhdar Brahimi is seeking backing for a cease-fire during
an Islamic holiday this month, a proposal backed by rebel groups
as well as Iran and  Turkey .  Brahimi is on a regional tour that took him to Jordan and
Lebanon. Assad’s government is also expecting him to visit
Damascus.  To contact the reporter on this story:
