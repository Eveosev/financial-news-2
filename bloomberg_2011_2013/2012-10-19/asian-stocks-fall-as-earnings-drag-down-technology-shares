Asian  stocks  fell, with the regional
benchmark index headed for the first drop in four days, as
worse-than-expected earnings results from Google Inc. and
Microsoft Corp. weighed on technology shares.  Internet portal Yahoo  Japan  Corp. declined 2.3 percent in
 Tokyo  and Samsung Electronics Co. fell in  Seoul . National
 Australia  Bank Ltd. led the country’s lenders lower after saying
it quadrupled provisions for bad loans. Fanuc Corp., a Japanese
maker of factory robots, increased 3.9 percent after
manufacturing in the Philadelphia region expanded more than
estimated.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index dropped 0.2 percent to 123.65
as of 7:37 p.m. in Tokyo with about five stocks falling for
every four that rose. The measure has risen 2.4 percent this
week.  “Earnings reflect the economic weakness we saw a few
months ago, and therefore you could argue it’s somewhat
outdated,” said  Shane Oliver , Sydney-based head of investment
strategy at AMP Capital Investors Ltd., which has almost $100
billion under management. “You end up in a standoff in the
share market between focus on economic data, which is more
forward-looking, and focus on earnings, which are not as good.”  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index rebounded 14 percent through
yesterday from this year’s low on June 4 as stimulus measures in
 Europe , the U.S., Japan and  China  boosted  market sentiment  amid
a global economic slowdown and Europe’s debt crisis. The Asian
benchmark traded at 13.1 times  estimated earnings  on average,
compared with 13.9 for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 12.3
for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  Nikkei, Kospi  Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average gained 0.2 percent,
recording the biggest weekly advance this year. Australia’s
S&P/ASX 200 added 0.3 percent, while New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index
lost 0.3 percent.  South Korea ’s Kospi Index slid 0.8 percent.
 Singapore ’s Straits Times Index dropped 0.4 percent.  Taiwan’s
Taiex Index (TWSE)  fell 0.8 percent.  Hong Kong ’s Hang Seng Index gained 0.2 percent, capping its
longest streak of daily gains since January 2011, and China’s
Shanghai Composite Index dropped 0.2 percent.  China’s government won’t provide big economic stimulus
measures and a strong rebound in growth is unlikely, Song
Guoqing, an adviser to the People’s Bank of China, said
yesterday. The government reported a 7.4 percent economic
expansion in the third quarter from a year earlier that met the
median estimate of economists.  “Policy makers would’ve been very happy with the data
because it’s suggesting that the Chinese economy is bottoming
and therefore authorities have been right to exercise caution in
providing stimulus,” said AMP Capital’s Oliver. “Likewise, the
data suggests policy caution probably continues.”  Google, Microsoft  Futures on the  S&P 500  fell 0.2 percent today, which marks
the 25th anniversary of so-called the Black Monday market crash,
the biggest single-day equity decline in history. The gauge fell
0.2 percent yesterday, led by technology shares.  Google dropped 8 percent to $695 after reporting profit and
sales that missed analysts’ estimates, a signal that its tools
are becoming less valuable to advertisers as more users access
the world’s largest search engine via mobile devices. After
regular trading, Microsoft, the largest software maker, reported
fiscal first-quarter profit and sales that fell short of
analysts’ estimates amid declining personal computer sales.  Information technology shares dropped the most among the 10
industry groups on the MSCI  Asia  Pacific Index. Samsung, the
world’s No. 1 seller of smartphones and the heaviest weighted
stock on the Asia-Pacific Index, dropped 2.6 percent to 1.302
million won.  Yahoo Japan slipped 2.3 percent to 28,830 yen. NCsoft
Corp., an online-game maker, declined 1.8 percent to 213,500 won
in Seoul. Pegatron Corp., an electronics maker, lost 1.7 percent
to NT$40.8 in Taipei.  Leading Indicators  The earnings season is starting in earnest in Asia with 158
companies of the 1,006 members on the MSCI Asia Pacific Index
scheduled to report results next week.  NAB fell 2.7 percent, its biggest decline since May, to
A$26.22 in Sydney. Provisions increased by A$250 million ($259
million), taking the total to A$320 million, the Melbourne-based
bank said in a statement.  Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC) , Australia’s No.
2 lender, dropped 1.5 percent to A$25.56 while Australia & New
Zealand Banking Group Ltd. fell 1.1 percent to A$25.66.  Shares pared losses after an index of U.S. leading economic
indicators rose in September by the most in seven months and
manufacturing in the Philadelphia region expanded in October for
the first time in six months.  Fanuc Gains  Fanuc, Japan’s biggest supplier of factory automation
equipment, climbed 3.9 percent to 13,290 yen. It was the second-
biggest support to the Asia-Pacific index today.  Li & Fung Ltd. (494) ,
a supplier of toys and clothes to Wal-Mart Stores Inc., rose 1.1
percent to HK$12.96.  Kyowa Hakko Kirin Co., a Japanese pharmaceutical maker,
dropped 6.2 percent to 901 yen after halting a clinical study of
a drug for chronic  kidney disease .  Among other stocks that rose, NEC Corp., Japan’s biggest
maker of telecommunications equipment, jumped the most in four
years in Tokyo as it raised its estimate for first-half
operating profit to 47 times the previous forecast. The stock
surged 10 percent to 137 yen, the biggest gain since 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
