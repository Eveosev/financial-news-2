The staff of the U.S. Nuclear
Regulatory Commission said new court-ordered rules on storage of
spent nuclear fuel to be completed by September 2014.  NRC’s staff plans to continue revieving license
applications and holding hearings, and final action is “the
only licensing milestone that the staff will be unable to
complete” before the waste rule is issued, according to
documents posted today on NRC website.  The U.S. Court of Appeals in  Washington  ruled on June 8
that NRC rules on storage failed to fully evaluate risks and new
standards must be drafted. The agency on Aug. 7 suspended final
decisions pending the reassessment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
