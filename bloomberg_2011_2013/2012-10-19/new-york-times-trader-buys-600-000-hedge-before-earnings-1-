A trader paid $600,000 to  protect 
against losses in  New York Times Co. (NYT)  shares yesterday ahead of
the newspaper publishing company’s earnings report next week.  Some 10,000 puts to sell shares of Times Co. at $10 by
January changed hands yesterday. The options traded at the ask
price of 60 cents and exceeded open interest of 1,105
outstanding contracts from Oct. 17, indicating a buyer of a new
bearish position initiated the transaction. The shares rose 2.8
percent this week.  “My guess is that someone bought a diaper for their stock
position ahead of earnings next week or a weekend meltdown,”
Chris Rich, head options strategist at JonesTrading
Institutional Services LLC in  Chicago , said in an interview.  The publisher of the third-biggest U.S. newspaper by
weekday circulation is working to increase its digital expertise
and has accelerated a shift to the Internet as print advertising
declines. In August, Times Co. named former British Broadcasting
Corp. director Mark Thompson as chief executive officer to help
lead the electronic push.  The company, which reports results on Oct. 25, may post
quarterly earnings of 8 cents a share excluding some items from
5 cents a share a year ago, according to analyst estimates
compiled by Bloomberg.  Robert Christie, a spokesman for the Times Co., declined to
comment on the options trading.  To contact the reporters on this story:
