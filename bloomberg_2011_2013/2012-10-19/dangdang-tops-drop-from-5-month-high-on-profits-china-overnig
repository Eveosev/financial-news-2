Chinese stocks  in  New York  fell,
dragging the benchmark index down from a five-month high, as a
drop in foreign investments and disappointing earnings for U.S.
companies raised concern that corporate profits will worsen.  The Bloomberg  China-US Equity Index (CH55BN)  of the most-traded
Chinese companies in the U.S. retreated 0.7 percent to 95.54 in
New York, paring the weekly advance to 1.9 percent. The index
reached 96.21 on Oct. 18, the highest closing level since May
11. Suntech Power Holdings Ltd. led a drop of solar equipment
markers, declining 18 percent, while  Yanzhou Coal Mining Co. (YZC) 
lost the most since Sept. 5.  A government report showed yesterday that foreign direct
investment in  China  fell for the 10th time in 11 months, as
companies from  China Mobile (941)  Ltd. to  Huaneng Power International
Inc. (600011)  are forecast to report third-quarter earnings next week. In
the U.S., General Electric Co., McDonald’s Corp. and Microsoft
Corp. posted results that missed analysts’ estimates while
European leaders failed to discuss further aid for Spain.  “We are still extremely negative on Chinese equities,”
John-Paul Smith, an emerging-market strategist at Deutsche Bank
AG, said by phone from London yesterday. “Unless we see a
dramatic recovery in the U.S. and  Europe , China will be under an
awful lot of pressure and face another leg down in the
economy.”  The  iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund , the biggest Chinese
exchange-traded fund in the U.S., dropped 0.8 percent to $37.13
after reaching a five-month high of $37.45 on Oct. 18. For the
week, it gained 2.1 percent after a report showing an increase
in industrial production in September bolstered prospects that
 China’s economy  is bottoming.  Quarterly Earnings  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  of domestic stocks lost 0.2
percent yesterday, paring its weekly gain to 1.1 percent. The
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 1.7 percent, trimming its
advance to 0.3 percent on the week, after Microsoft and GE
released sales that trailed estimates.  Suntech, the world’s largest solar-panel maker, lost 18
percent to 75 cents yesterday, while LDK Solar Co. fell 13
percent to 71 cents.  Yanzhou Coal, China’s fourth-largest coal miner, fell 4.7
percent to $16.05, for a weekly decline of 1.2 percent.  The company may report on Oct. 26 that its net income had
dropped to 0.16 yuan (2.6 cents) a share in the third quarter,
from 0.33  yuan  the previous quarter, according to the average
forecast of three analysts in a Bloomberg survey.  China Mobile, the world’s biggest phone company by
subscribers, will report on Oct. 22 that its third-quarter
earnings had dropped to 1.51 yuan a share, from 1.74 yuan the
previous period, according to the average forecast of three
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Adjusted earnings from Huaneng
Power, China’s largest electricity producer, probably rose to
0.2 yuan a share from 0.09 yuan, according to the average
forecasts of two analysts before the earnings release on Oct.
