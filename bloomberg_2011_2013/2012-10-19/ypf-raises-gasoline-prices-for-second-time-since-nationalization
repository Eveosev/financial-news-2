YPF SA (YPFD) , Argentinas’s biggest energy
company, is boosting gasoline and diesel prices for the second
time since it was nationalized in April.  The company will raise fuel prices 3.2 percent on average
in all of its 1,500 service stations, which represent 58 percent
of the market in the South American country, the company said in
an e-mailed statement. It previously increased fuel prices 7
percent on Aug. 15.  Chief Executive Officer Miguel Galuccio said in August that
YPF would adjust gasoline prices in line with production costs
and that the company was in talks with the Argentine government
to discuss increases in natural-gas prices.  YPF spokesman Alejandro Di Lazzaro didn’t reply to calls
and e-mails seeking further comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
