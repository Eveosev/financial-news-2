Alsea SAB fell the most in a week
after third-quarter profit missed some analysts’ estimates and
UBS AG cut the shares to the equivalent of sell, saying near
record levels would be hard to sustain.  The  shares  of Mexico’s largest fast-food chain operator
dropped 2.1 percent to 21.92 pesos today in Mexico City, the
biggest drop since Oct. 10. The company rallied to a record
closing high of 22.74 pesos on Oct. 15. The benchmark  IPC (MEXBOL)  index
of 35 Mexican stocks fell 0.5 percent today.  “Valuation is pricey, and with the  stock trading  at
historic highs there is little room for error,” UBS analysts
led by Marimar Torreblanca wrote in a research report published
today as they lowered the shares from the equivalent of hold.
“As spaces get more crowded, opening stores in big cities
becomes more challenging, and we think this eventually could
start showing in store profitability.”  Operating income, omitting depreciation and amortization,
rose 44 percent to 412.5 million pesos ($32 million), missing
UBS’s projection by 3 percent, while net income advanced 2.5
percent to 84.3 million pesos, 2 percent below UBS’s estimate.
Revenue increased 26 percent to 3.5 billion pesos.  Alsea shares soared 63 percent this year through yesterday,
making it the seventh-best performer on  Mexico ’s benchmark
gauge. The stock’s price  touched  a five-year high 4.38 times
book value on Oct. 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
