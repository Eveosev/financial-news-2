Dean Foods Co. (DF) , the largest U.S.
dairy processor, extended its weekly gain to 24 percent and
reached a two-year high after its  WhiteWave Foods Co. (WWAV)  unit filed
for an initial public offering.  WhiteWave, the maker of Silk almond milk, filed on Oct. 17
to raise as much as $320 million as Dean tries to generate cash
to pay off debt. WhiteWave expects to contribute as much as $282
million of the proceeds from the offering and $885 million of
new borrowings to Dallas-based Dean, which will use those funds
to repay debt, a regulatory filing showed.  Dean gained 63 cents, or 3.5 percent, to $18.57 at 10:39
a.m. in  New York  on volume of 3.01 million shares. The 15-day
average is 4.56 million. Volume was 13.4 million on Oct. 17 and
10.9 million yesterday. The price reached $18.63, the highest
level since January 2010.  Dean also said last month it may sell its Morningstar unit,
which makes dairy products for restaurants.  To contact the reporter on this story:
