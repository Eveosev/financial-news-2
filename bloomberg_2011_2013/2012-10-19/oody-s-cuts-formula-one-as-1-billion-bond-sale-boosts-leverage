Moody’s Investors Service cut the
ratings on Formula One’s debt a single step after the auto-
racing series started raising $1 billion of private high-yield
bonds to pay its owners a dividend.  The ratings firm reduced the London-based company’s loans
to B1 from Ba3 and assigned a B2 corporate family rating to its
parent Delta Debtco Ltd., citing the “materially increased
leverage” after the debt placement and a “more aggressive
financial strategy” after a share sale in May was abandoned,
according to a report.  Formula One’s lenders agreed to a two-year loan extension
and the $1 billion dividend earlier this month, raising the
amount it will distribute to shareholders this year to $2.2
billion, according to Moody’s. Moody’s estimates the company’s
debt to be more than six times its earnings before interest,
tax, depreciation and amortization, and for leverage to increase
further next year.  “Following the company’s aggressive distribution steps in
2012, the ratings are initially weakly positioned at the B2
level,” analysts led by Olivier Beroud wrote in the report. If
Formula One’s leverage were to climb to more than seven times
Ebitda or it generates negative free  cash flow , the rating would
come under negative pressure, Moody’s said.  Formula One’s owners include  CVC Capital Partners , Oslo-
based Norges Bank, U.S. mutual fund  Waddell & Reed Financial
Inc. (WDR) ,  BlackRock Inc. (BLK)  and Chief Executive Officer  Bernie
Ecclestone .  To contact the reporter on this story:
