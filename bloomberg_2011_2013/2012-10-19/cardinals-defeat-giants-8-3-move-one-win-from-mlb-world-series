Matt Holliday had a pair of run-
scoring singles and the St. Louis Cardinals defeated the San
Francisco Giants 8-3 to move within one win of advancing to play
the Detroit Tigers in the World Series.  Adam Wainwright allowed one run on four hits in seven
innings to earn the victory for St. Louis, which took a three-
games-to-one lead in the best-of-seven National League
Championship Series.  The Cardinals can finish off the Giants tomorrow night in
Game 5 in St. Louis. If the Giants win that game, the series
would move back to San Francisco on Oct. 21 and, if necessary, a
decisive seventh game on Oct. 22.  The winner of this series will play in the World Series
against the Tigers, who earlier today completed a four-games-to-
none sweep of the  New York  Yankees in the AL Championship
Series.  Holliday drove in runs as the Cardinals scored two runs
each in the first and fifth innings. Jon Jay added a two-run
double in the sixth and Yadier Molina added a run-scoring double
in the Cardinalsâ€™ two-run seventh.  Hunter Pence hit a solo home run in the second inning for
the Giants and Pablo Sandoval added a two-run homer in the
ninth.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
