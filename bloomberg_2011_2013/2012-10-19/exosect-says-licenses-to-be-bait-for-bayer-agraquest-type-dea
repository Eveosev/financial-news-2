Exosect Ltd., a maker of electro-
static powder for spreading biopesticide, is discussing tie-ups
with 10 agrochemical companies including  Syngenta AG (SYNN)  in the hope
a takeover proposal will follow, its chief executive officer
said in an interview.  The biotechnology research company’s backers WHEB Ventures
Ltd., Oxford Capital Partners Ltd., Entrepreneurs Fund
Management LLP, MTI Partners and  Hygea VCT (HYG)  are looking to exit
within two or three years, CEO  Martin Brown  said. Winchester,
U.K.-based Exosect is looking to beat the almost $500 million
price tag that  Bayer AG (BAYN)  paid for AgraQuest when it acquired the
bio-pesticide maker in July.  “Our strategy is to license, on the basis that we feel
like one of the licensees is going to be our exit partner,” the
former executive of Syngenta.  Exosect, which licensed a bee-health product to Bayer AG in
2010, is seeking partners to commercialise its palm-tree based
Entostat powder, which binds biological control agents to crop-
killing insects by picking up their electro-static charge. The
world’s largest makers of crop sprays are increasingly turning
to startup research firms as their technologies become generic,
said the 25-year industry veteran.  “Syngenta have got to do something about their R&D,”
Brown said. “I would guess 70 percent of Syngenta’s technology
is going to be generic soon.”  BASF SE (BAS) ’s purchase of Becker Underwood for $1 billion,
Bayer’s AgraQuest takeover, and Syngenta’s purchase of Devgen
highlight a “feeding frenzy” by established companies over the
last six months as they seek new technology, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
