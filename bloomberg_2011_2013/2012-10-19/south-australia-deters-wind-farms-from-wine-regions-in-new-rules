South Australia is discouraging wind
farms in the Barossa Valley and McLaren Vale wine-growing
regions under revised rules introduced by the state government.  Among the changes to the Australian stateâ€™s policy are
regulations ensuring  wind turbines  are 2 kilometers (1.2 miles)
from towns and at least 1 kilometer from homes, Planning
Minister  John Rau  said yesterday in an e-mailed statement.  The amendments are aimed at responding to community
concerns while still providing opportunities for new investment
in  wind energy  in South Australia, Rau said. South Australia has
set a target of getting 33 percent of its power from renewable
energy by 2020, according to a statement from the  Clean Energy
Council, a group that represents the industry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
