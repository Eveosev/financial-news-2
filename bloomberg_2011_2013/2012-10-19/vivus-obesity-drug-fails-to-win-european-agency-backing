Vivus Inc. (VVUS) ’s obesity drug, approved
in July in the U.S., failed to gain the backing of European drug
regulators because of its potential side effects.  The European Medicines Agency’s Committee for Medicinal
Products for Human Use recommended against approving Vivus’s
pill, to be marketed under the name Qsiva in Europe, because of
concerns about negative cardiovascular and nervous system
effects from long-term use, the Mountain View, California-based
company said yesterday in a statement. Vivus plans to appeal the
decision.  “The lack of effective pharmacologic treatments for
obesity remains a high medical need for many patients in
Europe,” Peter Tam, Vivus’s president, said in the statement.
“We are committed to getting Qsiva approved in  Europe .”  The drug, called Qsymia in the U.S., was the second weight-
loss drug to be cleared this year by the Food and Drug
Administration. The therapy is a combination of the appetite
suppressant phentermine and the anti-seizure drug topiramate.  Advisers to the London-based EMA indicated last month they
would recommend against approval of the medicine, and Vivus sank
the most in seven months.  The European Commission usually adopts the committee’s
advice, though it isn’t required to do so.  Vivus  rose  2.1 percent to $20.60 at the close of  New York 
trading. The shares have more than doubled this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
