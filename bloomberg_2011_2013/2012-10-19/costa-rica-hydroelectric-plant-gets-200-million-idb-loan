The Inter-American Development Bank
will provide a $200 million loan to help build a hydroelectric
plant in Costa Rica’s Limon province.  The loan from the Washington-based lender will help design,
construct and operate the 305.5 megawatt plant, the IDB said in
an e-mailed statement today. When finished, the plant will
represent about 10 percent of the Central American country’s
total electricity generation capacity, according to the
statement.  The plant will be Central America’s biggest renewable
energy project.  To contact the reporter on this story:
