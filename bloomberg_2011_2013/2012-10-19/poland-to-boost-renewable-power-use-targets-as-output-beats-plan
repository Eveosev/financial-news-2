Poland will from next year increase
its short-term targets for renewable energy use as output
surpasses plans, damping the price of green certificates.  Under a decree signed by the economy minister yesterday,
utilities will have to increase the share of green energy sold
to end users by about 1 percentage point a year, Janusz
Pilitowski, director of the  Economy Ministry ’s renewable energy
department, said today in Warsaw.  The share of electricity from renewable sources will this
year probably reach 11 percent, compared with a 10.4 percent
requirement set in 2008, mainly thanks to biomass use in power
generation, he said.  The price of green certificates averaged 248.61 zloty
($78.99) a megawatt-hour in September, down 7.4 percent from
last year. The certificates, issued by the country’s energy
regulator to guarantee that power was produced from renewable
sources, traded at 227.99 zloty yesterday,  data  from the Polish
power exchange show.  “An increased obligation will generate demand for
certificates,” Pilitowski said.  Along with increased targets for renewable output, the law
eliminates support for use of high-quality wood as biomass in
power generation, which resulted in a surge of prices for the
commodity used in other industries. Meanwhile, operators will be
given more time to upgrade and use units fueled by biomass.  Link to Company News:{PGE PW <Equity>
