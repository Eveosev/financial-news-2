Nordic electricity climbed to the
highest in more than a week as forecasts indicated below-usual
temperatures and a decline in the glut of water in the
hydropower-dependent region.  The next-quarter contract rose as much as 1.8 percent to
42.49 euros ($55.48) a megawatt-hour, the highest since Oct. 10,
and was at 42.40 euros at 3:18 p.m. on Nasdaq OMX Group Inc.â€™s
energy exchange in Oslo. Power for next month gained 2.5 percent
to 40.60 euros.  Temperatures in the region will drop to 2 degrees Celsius
(3.6 Fahrenheit) below the seasonal average next week, pushing
up power demand and prices, Danish energy trading company Energi
Danmark A/S said today in a website report.  The surplus of hydropower reserves compared with the
seasonal mean may decline 24 percent to 7.7 terawatt-hours over
the next two weeks, Markedskraft AS data on Bloomberg show. The
Nordic area generates about a fifth of its power from nuclear
reactors and half by running  water through turbines .  Fourteen Nordic nuclear reactors operated by Vattenfall AB,
EON AG,  Fortum Oyj (FUM1V)  and Teollisuuden Voima Oyj produced at 89
percent of their combined capacity earlier today, according to
data from company websites and Bloomberg calculations. The rate
may rise to 95 percent next week, a Bloomberg estimate shows, as
the Ringhals-2 reactor is set to start production on Oct. 26
following yearly maintenance, according to an Aug. 30 filing to
the Nord Pool Spot AS exchange in Oslo by operator Vattenfall.  To contact the reporter on this story:
