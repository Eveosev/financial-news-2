Spain  plans to extend a ban on
short-selling for three months from the start of November as
regulators take into account the “exceptional situation”
facing the country’s banks.  Authorities will first extend the ban to the end of the
month after it expires on Oct. 23, the markets regulator, known
as CNMV, said in a  statement  sent by email. CNMV will also begin
procedures to notify the European Securities & Markets Authority
of its intention to extend the prohibition for a further three
months, the regulator said.  CNMV said it was taking into account the “exceptional
situation” facing the banking industry because the process of
restructuring it is still incomplete, the regulator said. In
this context, lifting the bank on short-selling would “add
uncertainty,” CNMV said.  Short-sellers sell borrowed shares with plans to buy them
back later at a lower price, a practice some politicians and
investors blame for roiling markets. The ban can be lifted at
any time if market conditions allow, the regulator said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
