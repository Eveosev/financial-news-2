Hammerson Plc (HMSO) , Britain’s third-
largest real estate company by market value, acquired four U.K.
retail complexes for 254.5 million pounds ($409 million) as it
changes to a retail-property company from an office landlord.  Hammerson bought the Junction Unit Trust, which consists of
Thurrock Shopping Park, Forge Shopping Park in Telford, Imperial
Retail Park in Bristol and Abbotsinch Retail Park in Glasgow,
according to a statement today. The sites have an average annual
lease of 11 years and 18 million pounds annual rent, which the
London-based company said it expects will increase to 20 million
pounds in the next five years.  “There is continued strong consumer demand for the ease
and convenience of retail parks, and that consumer demand is
being reflected in the increasing requirements of a range of
fashion and catering retailers for space in retail parks,”
Chief Executive Officer David Atkins said in the statement.  Hammerson is selling its  London  office portfolio to focus
on shopping centers. In June, the company announced a 518
million-pound sale of most of its London office buildings to
Brookfield Office Properties Inc., giving Hammerson about 1
billion pounds of cash or credit lines. Hammerson already owns
another 17 retail parks in the U.K., according to its  website .  The company acquired the Victoria Quarter shopping arcades
in Leeds for 136 million pounds in September and is proposing to
build a $1.4 billion mall in South London.  Hammerson was up 1.5 percent at 483.4 pence at the 4:30
p.m. close in London, the highest since July 2011. The shares
have gained 5.2 percent in the past month, the second-best
performance among stocks in the FTSE 350 Real Estate Investment
Trust Index, which added 1.5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
