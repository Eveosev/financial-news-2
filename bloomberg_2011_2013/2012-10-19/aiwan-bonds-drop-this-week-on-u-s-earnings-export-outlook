Taiwan ’s bonds had their first
weekly drop in more than a month as U.S. earnings and forecasts
for a rebound in exports brightened the economic outlook.  The 10-year yield reached the highest level in more than
two weeks yesterday after  China , Taiwan’s biggest trading
partner, reported third-quarter growth of 7.4 percent, matching
estimates. Of the 104 companies listed in the S&P 500 index that
released results since Oct. 9, 75 posted earnings that exceeded
analysts’ predictions, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Official
figures today showed Taiwan’s export orders rose for the first
time in seven months in September, climbing 1.9 percent from a
year earlier.  “Taiwan bond yields have been trending up this week
because there was some good news from the earnings results of
American companies, pushing U.S. bond yields up,” said Jerry Lin, a fixed-income trader in Taipei at First Commercial Bank.
“The economic data aren’t getting worse, and maybe that would
mean Taiwan bond yields bottomed out as well.”  The yield on the 1.125 percent bonds due September 2022

according to Gretai Securities Market. The rate was at 1.151
