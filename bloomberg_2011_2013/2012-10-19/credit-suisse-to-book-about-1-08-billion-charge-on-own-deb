Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) ’s earnings in
the third quarter will be eroded by a charge related to the
company’s own debt of about 1 billion Swiss francs ($1.08
billion).  The bank’s repurchase of some debt instruments during the
quarter changed the composition of liabilities that have to be
revalued every three months and also impacted the prices of
bonds, Zurich-based Credit Suisse said on its website. The
repurchase resulted in a benefit of 380 million francs to the
bank’s common equity under Basel III rules, it said.  The accounting charge stems from a rule tied to the
theoretical cost of buying back the bank’s debt as market prices
fluctuate.  Credit Suisse is due to report third-quarter earnings on
Oct. 25. The bank may report net income of 586 million francs,
according to the mean estimate of 6 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg this month, compared with 683 million francs in the
year-earlier period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
