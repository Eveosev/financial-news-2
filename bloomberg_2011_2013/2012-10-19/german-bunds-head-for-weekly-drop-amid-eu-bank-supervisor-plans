Italian 10-year bonds rose for a
seventh day, the longest run of gains in more than two years, as
European Union leaders committed to the goal of establishing a
euro-area bank supervisor by year-end.  Italy ’s benchmark  yields  fell to the lowest since March as
the Treasury said yesterday it received orders for more than 18
billion euros ($23.6 billion) of retail bonds it was selling to
individual investors, double the two previous offers combined.
Spanish 10-year bonds advanced, with yields dropping to the
least since April.  Germany ’s bunds gained as the EU summit in
Brussels entered its second day.  “The general mood toward the periphery is quite positive
at the moment,” said Jamie Searle, a fixed-income strategist at
Citigroup Inc. in  London , referring to nations such as Spain and
Italy. “In terms of Italy’s funding needs, 18 billion euros is
a lot more than they would have been expecting to raise, so it
does mean that they’re going to have less funding pressure
between now and year-end.”  Italy’s 10-year yield fell four basis points, or 0.04
percentage point, to 4.73 percent at 11:15 a.m. London time
after falling to 4.70 percent, the lowest since March 9. The 5.5
percent bond due in November 2022 rose 0.285, or 2.85 euros per
1,000-euro face amount, to 106.54. The seven-day gain is the
longest since August 2010.  EU Framework  The EU will seek to agree on a framework that makes the
 European Central Bank  the main supervisor of lenders by Jan. 1,
according to conclusions released today from the leaders’
summit. The new system, intended to break the link between banks
and governments at the core of the region’s financial crisis,
will be phased in over the next year and may cover all 6,000
euro-area banks by Jan. 1, 2014.  The Italian Treasury earlier this year began selling the
retail bonds to local investors, who are among the biggest
savers in  Europe , as contagion from the debt crisis triggered an
exodus of foreign funds.  The orders dwarfed the 7.3 billion euros of bonds placed in
the first sale in March and the 1.7 billion euros at the second
sale in June. The 18 billion-euro amount was three times as much
as the Treasury took in at its monthly auction on Oct. 11.  Spain ’s  10-year yield  dropped three basis points to 5.31
percent after falling to 5.26 percent, the lowest since April 2.  German 10-year yields declined three basis points to 1.61
percent. The yield climbed to 1.66 percent yesterday, the
highest level since Sept. 19.  Most Volatile  Volatility on Dutch bonds was the highest in euro-area
markets, followed by Austria and  France , according to measures
of 10-year or equivalent-maturity debt, the spread between two-
year and 10-year securities and credit-default swaps.  The extra yield investors demand to hold Dutch 10-year
bonds instead of similar-maturity German bunds shrank one basis
point to 22 basis points.  Germany’s bonds returned 2.2 percent this year through
yesterday, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. Spanish
securities rose 4.1 percent and Italian debt gained 18 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
