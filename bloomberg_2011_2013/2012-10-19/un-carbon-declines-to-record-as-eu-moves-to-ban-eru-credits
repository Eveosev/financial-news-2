United Nations carbon offsets for
December fell to a record as the European Union proposed a ban
on carbon credits from emerging economies.  UN Certified Emission Reductions for December fell 4.2
percent to 1.36 euros a metric ton as of 2:02 p.m. on  London â€™s
ICE Futures Europe exchange. The futures contract for March also
dropped to its lowest-ever price, declining 2.4 percent to 1.20
euros a ton, and the December 2013 contract weakened 1.9 percent
to 1.55 euros, also a record.  Prices slid after the EU proposed to ban the use of UN
Emission Reduction Units in its carbon market from April 2013,
raising the possibility that countries would try to sell more
offsets before the ban comes into effect.  To contact the reporter on this story:
