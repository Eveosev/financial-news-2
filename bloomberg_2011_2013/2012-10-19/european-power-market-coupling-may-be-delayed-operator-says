The planned integration of power
markets in the European Union may be delayed beyond 2014,
according to CASC-CWE which handles auctions of transmission
capacity in the region.  Meeting that deadline depends on markets in northwest
 Europe  being linked by the second quarter of next year, a
process that is still subject to completion of tests and
regulatory approvals, according to a presentation by the
Capacity Allocation Service Company for Central West Europe.  “If any of the above steps takes more time than estimated
or cannot be successfully finalized, this will have an impact on
the planning,” Corne Meeuwis, CASC-CWE’s chief executive
officer, said in the presentation posted on the  website  of
 Norway ’s energy and water directorate.  The EU  plans  to merge the region’s power markets by
aligning regulation and expanding cross-border power trading and
infrastructure by 2014, according to the European Commission.  While integration plans in northwest Europe are being
implemented on schedule, the project is now entering a
challenging phase, Meeuwis said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
