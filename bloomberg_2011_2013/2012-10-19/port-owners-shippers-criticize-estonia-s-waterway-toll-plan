Business leaders criticised plans by
the Estonian government to increase waterway tolls by as much as
six times next year to cover investment costs.  Draft laws highlight “extreme instability in the business
environment” and an “atmosphere of unpredictability,” Fyodor
Berman, the main owner of the largest Baltic shipbuilder BLRT
Grupp AS, and Arnout Lugtmeijer, Chief Executive Officer of
equipment distributor Vopak E.O.S., said in an e-mailed letter
today. They urged parliament to reject the plan.  The measures, still to be adopted by parliament, aim to
combine present fees into a single toll for using Estonia’s
waterway network. That fee may increase costs for a single port
visit by two to six times, according to a letter accompanying
the draft bill on the  parliament’s website . The changes would
help cover the cost of investing in safety, bringing the network
in line with those in Finland and  Sweden .  AS Tallink Grupp (TAL1T) , the largest Baltic ferry company, would
see its tax burden “significantly” increased and pay higher
waterway tolls than in Sweden if the changes are enforced,
deputy CEO Andres Hunt said in a letter on Oct. 11, posted on
parliament’s website.  Total fees for marine cargo shipping would rise by 14 to 60
percent which would “negatively” affect competitiveness versus
the other ports on the  Baltic Sea , the Association of Estonian
Ports said in a letter to Economy Minister Juhan Parts on Sept.
