South  Korea ’s won led a weekly
advance in Asian currencies as signs of an improvement in the
global economy brightened the outlook for the region’s exports
and spurred demand for emerging-market assets.  The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia Dollar Index, which tracks the
region’s most-active currencies, rose 0.1 percent and on Oct. 18
touched its highest level since February. The won strengthened
the most this month and the  yuan  had an 11th weekly gain, the
longest winning streak since March 2008.  India ’s rupee fell for
a second week as the government announced a pickup in inflation.
Hong Kong’s dollar touched the strong end of its permitted
trading range, triggering intervention to maintain the peg.  China ’s factory production, retail sales and fixed-asset
investment accelerated in September, reports showed Oct. 18.
Retail sales in the U.S., the world’s biggest economy, increased
1.1 percent in September while housing starts climbed 15 percent
to a four-year high, reports showed this week.  Europe ’s leaders
committed to their goal of creating a euro-area bank supervisor
by year-end, according to officials at a European Union summit
that took place in Brussels.  “The September data was clearly stronger than expected,”
said  Nizam Idris , head of Asian fixed income and currencies at
Macquarie Bank Ltd. in  Singapore . “The growth momentum will
continue. Still, we are at a very early stage of the recovery so
it’s too soon to expect” faster gains in Asian currencies,
including the yuan, he said.  The won appreciated 0.7 percent this week to 1,103.45 per
dollar in Seoul, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
yuan rose 0.21 percent to 6.2538, touching a 19-year high of
6.2446 on Oct. 18. Taiwan’s dollar climbed 0.3 percent to
NT$29.286.  Hong Kong Peg  Hong Kong’s dollar rose 0.02 percent to HK$7.7503. The Hong
Kong Monetary Authority said yesterday it bought $603 million at
HK$7.75 per dollar during  New York  trading hours on Oct. 19,
intervening for the first time since 2009 to maintain a peg that
requires the  exchange rate  to be kept in a range of HK$7.75 to
HK$7.85.  The won touched 1,102.50 on Oct. 17, the strongest level
since 0ct. 31, 2011.  South Korea ’s  economy  probably expanded 1.7
percent in the third quarter from a year earlier, the least in
three years, a Bloomberg survey showed before data due Oct. 26.  “The won was strong this week on positive data from the
U.S., but it seems some overseas investors are covering their
short positions on the dollar,” said Lee Jung Hyun, a Seoul-
based currency trader for  Industrial Bank of Korea. (024110)  A short
position is a bet an asset will decline in value.  China Outlook  The yuan has extended its rebound from this year’s low of
6.3967 on July 25 to 2.3 percent after September data indicated
growth is gathering pace in the world’s second-largest economy.
Factory output grew 9.2 percent from a year earlier, compared
with an 8.9 percent gain in August that was the smallest in
three years, official figures showed Oct. 18. Retail sales
advanced 14.2 percent, the most since March, while fixed-asset
investment climbed 21 percent in the first three quarters.  “We believe  China’s economy  has bottomed out in August or
September,” said Tommy Ong, a Hong Kong-based senior vice-
president of treasury and markets at DBS Bank ( Hong Kong ) Ltd.
“Improvement in global liquidity and calls for more
appreciation from the U.S. presidential campaign trail are also
supporting the yuan.”  The rupee fell 1.9 percent this week to 53.84 per dollar as
faster  inflation  eroded the appeal of assets denominated in the
currency. India’s benchmark price index increased 7.81 percent
last month from a year earlier, the most since December,
according to figures released Oct. 15.  Elsewhere, the Malaysian ringgit rose 0.1 percent this week
to 3.0535 per dollar. Indonesia’s rupiah fell 0.1 percent to
9,593 from last week’s 9,588, prices from local banks compiled
by Bloomberg show. The currency reached 9,657 on Oct. 11, the
weakest level since October 2009. The Philippines peso
appreciated 0.1 percent to 41.385. Vietnam’s dong climbed 0.1
percent to 20,843.  To contact the reporter on this story:
