Venezuela  isn’t studying a
devaluation of its currency next year and the government will
maintain levels of spending similar to those in 2012, El
Nacional  reported , citing central bank President Nelson Merentes.  The central bank is allowing foreign currency reserves to
fluctuate between $2 billion and $5 billion, the Caracas-based
daily cited Merentes as saying.  The bank has sufficient dollar-denominated securities to
feed the Sitme currency market, Merentes said, according to El
Nacional.  To contact the reporter on this story:
