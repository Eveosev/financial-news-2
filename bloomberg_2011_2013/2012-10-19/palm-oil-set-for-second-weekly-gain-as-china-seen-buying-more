Palm oil  climbed to the highest
level in more than a week on speculation that  China , the biggest
cooking oil user, will boost imports and after soybeans rallied
yesterday on signs of increasing demand for U.S. supplies.  The contract for January delivery climbed 0.2 percent to
2,501 ringgit ($819) a metric ton on the Malaysia Derivatives
Exchange in Kuala Lumpur, the highest level at close since Oct.
11. Futures, which were little changed this week, have lost 21
percent this year.  Palm oil imports by China, the largest buyer after India,
may be about 5.7 million tons in 2012 as a price decline spurs
purchases, according to the median of estimates from four
analysts and one trader compiled by Bloomberg. A survey in
August predicted imports of 5.5 million tons compared with 5.9
million tons last year. Soybeans rose the most in five weeks
yesterday and are set for the first weekly advance in five.  Palm oil traded higher because of strong overnight soybean
prices, Ryan Long, a vice president of futures and options at
OSK Investment Bank Bhd., said by phone from  Kuala Lumpur .
“China may restock a bit but they will not buy in a big way. We
do expect Malaysia’s exports to be higher than the previous
month as India and China are buying.”  Indonesia , the largest producer, will probably reduce a tax
on exports in November to 10.5 percent, the lowest level in two
years, from 13.5 percent this month, said Susanto, head of
marketing at the Indonesian Palm Oil Association. Base price may
be reduced to $785 a ton from $927, he said.  Soybean oil  for December delivery declined 0.2 percent to
52.20 cents a pound on the Chicago Board of Trade today after
surging 2.5 percent yesterday. Soybeans for November delivery
was little changed at $15.475 a bushel. Futures jumped 2.4
percent yesterday, the most since Sept. 12. Palm oil and soybean
oils are substitutes in food and fuel uses.  Palm oil for May delivery closed little changed at 7,218
 yuan  ($1,154) a ton on the  Dalian Commodity Exchange . Soybean
oil for delivery in May ended little changed at 9,260 yuan a
ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
