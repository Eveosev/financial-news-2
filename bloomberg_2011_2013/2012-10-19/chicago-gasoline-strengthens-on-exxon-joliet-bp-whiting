Chicago  gasoline strengthened for a
third day after Exxon Mobil Corp. reported an incident at its
Joliet refinery in  Illinois  and a crude unit was shut at BP
Plc’s Whiting, Indiana, plant.  The 238,000-barrel-a-day Joliet refinery released gasoline
and heavier materials from a coker today, according to Tricia
Simpson, a company spokeswoman. BP Whiting’s smallest crude
unit, with the capacity to process 80,000 barrels, was reported
yesterday to be shut.  Conventional gasoline  to be blended with ethanol in Chicago
gained 5.5 cents to a 13-cent discount versus New York futures
at 2:36 p.m. The climb follows yesterday’s 19-cent advance,
which was the largest increase since Aug. 27.  Joliet and Whiting, with a combined capacity of 658,000
barrels a day, account for 18 percent of production in the
Midwest, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Fuel supplies 
in the region shrank by 944,000 barrels last week to 47.6
million, the lowest level since June, Energy Department data
show.  In the West Coast market, California-grade, or Carbob,
gasoline was unchanged at a 10-cent premium in Los Angeles and
at parity with futures in San Francisco.  To contact the reporter on this story:
