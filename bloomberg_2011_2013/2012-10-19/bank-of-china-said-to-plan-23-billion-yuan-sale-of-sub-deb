Bank of China Ltd. , the nation’s
fourth-largest lender by assets, plans to sell 23 billion  yuan 
($3.7 billion) of subordinated bonds to replenish capital, two
people familiar with the matter said.  The sale is pending regulatory approval and timing has yet
to be determined, the people said, asking not to be identified
because the information is private. BOC International Holdings
Ltd., the Beijing-based company’s investment banking unit, was
hired to manage the sale.  Bank of China  joins rivals including Agricultural  Bank of
China Ltd. (3988)  in boosting capital with bonds as shares of Chinese
lenders trade near record low valuations on concern that an
economic slowdown will erode profits. The China Banking
Regulatory Commission is requiring systemically important banks
to hold a minimum capital ratio of 11.5 percent and a core ratio
of 9.5 percent under rules to be phased in next year.  The bank was the only Chinese lender to be included on a
provisional list of 29 systemically important financial
institutions published by the Financial Stability Board.  With 12.8 trillion yuan of assets, Bank of China had a
capital adequacy ratio of 13 percent as of June 30 and a core
Tier-1 capital ratio of 10.15 percent, both exceeding
requirements, according to company data.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
