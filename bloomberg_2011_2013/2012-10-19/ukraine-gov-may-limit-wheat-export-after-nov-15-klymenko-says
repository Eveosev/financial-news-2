Ukraine’s wheat exports will reach 5
million metric tons by Nov. 15, Volodymyr Klymenko, head of the
country’s Grain Association, said. That may prompt the
government to introduce shipment limits, he said, adding that
the First Deputy Agriculture Minister Ivan Bisuk has met traders
today to discuss the issue.  The traders and the government officials will meet again
near Nov. 15 “to look at the pace of exports”, Klymenko said
in a phone interview from Kiev.  Still, the grain exports may total 21 million tons this
marketing year, he said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
