Brazil ’s benchmark electricity
price, known as PLD, rose to a record 322.49 reais a megawatt-
hour this week after dryness in past months reduced water levels
in power-dam reservoirs.  The price was 76 percent higher than the average for last
month, the Rio de Janeiro-based BRIX electricity exchange said
in an e-mailed statement distributed by In Press Porter Novelli.  The benchmark price is for electricity distributed to
Brazil’s southeastern and center-western regions, BRIX said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
