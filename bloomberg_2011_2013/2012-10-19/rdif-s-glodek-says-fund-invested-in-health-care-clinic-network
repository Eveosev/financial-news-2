Sean Glodek, director at the Russian
Direct Investment Fund, made the following comments at the SALT
conference in  Singapore  today.  “We just closed a transaction investing in a health-care
clinic network in  Russia , focusing on pregnancy delivery as well
as prenatal issues. You can charge very high prices for
delivering quality service and attracting people who would
travel outside of Russia to get quality health care to now stay
in Russia. That’s a booming market. The margins are very high,
the growth is meaningful, double digit.”  “What’s more important for us as a private-equity fund is
investing in brick-and-mortar businesses. I know there are over
300 companies, privately owned, that have over a billion dollars
in revenue in Russia.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
