Unilever NV (UNA) ,  Abertis (ABE) 
Infraestructuras SA and  Whitbread (WTB)  Plc are among five companies
in the Stoxx Europe 600 Index that may boost their dividends
next week, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Unilever, the world’s second-largest consumer-products
company, will raise its interim payout to shareholders by 8
percent to 24.3 euro cents per share, according to Bloomberg
Dividend Forecasts that factor in earnings and options prices.
Abertis, Spain’s biggest toll-road operator, may increase its
dividend by 16 percent to 33 euro cents, while Whitbread, the
owner of Premier Inn budget lodges, may boost its disbursement
by 8.6 percent to 19 pence.  Companies in the  Stoxx 600 (SXXP)  may raise shareholder payouts by
3.8 percent in 2012, according to estimates compiled by
Bloomberg. Per-share earnings are forecast to grow 51 percent in
that period.  Debenhams Plc (DEB) , the U.K.’s second-largest department-store
chain, will probably boost its final dividend by 5 percent to
2.1 pence, and  C&C Group Plc (GCC) , the maker of Magners cider, will
raise its payout by 16 percent to 4.3 euro cents.  The Stoxx 600 has advanced 2.2 percent so far this week,
the second weekly increase in three, as Moody’s Investors
Service kept its investment-grade debt rating on Spain, and on
better-than-expected U.S. economic data. The gauge slipped 0.3
percent to 275.34 at 10:14 a.m. in London today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
