Spanish Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy 
said he doesn’t feel pressure to request a full bailout for his
nation and called it “very good” that the  European Central
Bank ’s unlimited bond-buying program is available if necessary.  “I’m not going to take into account any pressure that
people might exert on me, but frankly no one is doing that,”
Rajoy told reporters in Brussels following a two-day summit of
European Union leaders.  Rajoy is playing down the necessity of seeking additional
aid as the country’s borrowing costs have dropped since the ECB
offered in August to buy bonds on the secondary market of
countries that request aid from the euro-area rescue fund and
agree to conditions.  The yield on Spain’s  10-year benchmark bond  is 2.41
percentage points lower today than a euro-era record of 7.75
percent on July 25, a day after the government agreed to
conditions for a 100 billion-euro ($130 billion) European  credit
line  for its banks.  “It’s very important that the mechanism exists because a
few months ago it didn’t,” Rajoy said about the ECB’s bond-
buying program. “It’s very good because everyone knows it’s
there and it can be requested, but at the moment the decision
hasn’t been taken.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
