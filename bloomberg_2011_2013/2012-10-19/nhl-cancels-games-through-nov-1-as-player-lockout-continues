The  National Hockey League  canceled
another week of games through Nov. 1 as a lockout of players
continues.  The league said in a statement that a total of 135 regular-
season games have now been lost to the shutdown, which started
when the old collective bargaining agreement expired on Sept.
15. It earlier called off the first two weeks of the season,
which was to have begun Oct. 11.  The league and players’ union are at odds over how to split
revenue that reached a record $3 billion last season. The league
proposed a 50-50 split this week, and rejected union counter-
proposals yesterday. Commissioner Gary Bettman said the latest
talks were a “step backward.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
