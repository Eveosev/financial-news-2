The Czech industry and
transportation lobby is asking the government to prevent a hike
in electricity prices caused by renewable energy subsidies, CTK
reported, citing the group’s chairman Jaroslav Hanak.  A rise in power prices would endanger competitiveness of
Czech industrial producers and jeopardize jobs, CTK said, citing
him. Fees for renewable energy are expected to grow next year to
613 koruna a megawatthour from this year’s 419 koruna a
megawatthour, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
