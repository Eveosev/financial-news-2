Stephen Hodge resigned as vice
president of Cycling  Australia  after he admitted to taking
performance-enhancing drugs during his racing career, the second
departure from the governing body this week.  Hodge wrote in his resignation letter that he doped during
an unspecified stage of his professional career between 1987 and
1996, Cycling Australia  said today  in a statement. He was
elected as a vice president of the governing body in 2007.  “I am sorry I did it,” Hodge wrote in the letter,
distributed by Cycling Australia. “It was wrong. I apologize
unreservedly to CA, my family, friends, colleagues and cycling
fans.”  Hodge, who rode in the Tour de  France  six times in the
1980s and 1990s, left two days after Cycling Australia fired
Matt White as coordinator of the nation’s elite men’s road team.  White had stood down from the role and as sports director
of the Orica-GreenEDGE team on Oct. 13 after he admitted to
taking performance-enhancing drugs on Lance Armstrong’s U.S.
Postal Service team from 2001 to 2003.  In his resignation letter, Hodge said he wasn’t involved in
any discussions about the termination of White’s contract and
had stood aside from all Cycling Australia activities since
advising officials on Oct. 16 that he had used performance-
enhancing drugs.  “In light of the current circumstances, Stephen has made
it clear he doesn’t want a mistake he made two decades ago to
affect the work of Cycling Australia to take the sport
forward,” Cycling Australia President Klaus Mueller said in a
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
