Areva SA (AREVA)  appealed against state-run
 CEZ AS (CEZ) ’s decision to exclude the world’s largest supplier of
nuclear fuel and services from a tender to build two atomic
reactors at the Temelin power station in the  Czech Republic .  The Paris-based company addressed all the reasons given for
its exclusion and said its EPR reactor is the most competitive,
it said in an e-mailed statement. The appeal deadline is today.  Areva was ejected from the $10 billion tender on Oct. 5 as
it failed to meet legislative and commercial requirements, CEZ
said. Westinghouse Electric Corp. and a Russian-Czech group led
by Rosatom Corp.’s unit ZAO Atomstroyexport are still competing
for the project to build units 3 and 4 of the Temelin plant.  CEZ has 10 days to review Areva’s appeal and publish its
decision. Areva is able to go to the Czech anti-monopoly office,
which would have 60 days to review the case, if the company is
rejected again. CEZ plans to choose the winning offer in the
middle of 2013 and sign a final contract by the year’s end.  To contact the reporter on this story:
