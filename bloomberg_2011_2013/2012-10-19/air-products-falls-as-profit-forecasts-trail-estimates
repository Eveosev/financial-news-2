Air Products & Chemicals Inc. (APD) , the
world’s largest hydrogen producer, fell the most in more than
two and a half years after its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings
and 2013 forecasts lagged analysts’ estimates.  Air Products declined 6.3 percent to $79.99 at the close in
New York, the most since Feb. 5, 2010.  Profit in the three months through September was $1.42 a
share, excluding costs to restructure the company’s photovoltaic
unit, exit the polyurethane intermediates business and write
down assets related to a customer’s bankruptcy, Allentown,
Pennsylvania-based Air Products said today in a statement. That
fell 2 cents short of the average of 16 analysts’ estimates
compiled by Bloomberg.  “We sense that the company continues to be impacted by the
relatively sluggish pace of economic activity globally,”
Michael Sison, a Cleveland-based analyst at KeyBanc Capital
Markets Inc. who rates the shares buy, said today in a note.
“The softer guidance relative to current estimates will weigh
on sentiment near term.”  Profit in the 2013 fiscal year, which began Oct. 1, will be
$5.65 a share to $5.85 a share, including $1.26 to $1.31 a share
in the first fiscal quarter, Air Products said. Analysts had
 expected  $6.16 for the year and $1.40 for the quarter.  Chairman and Chief Executive Officer John McGlade is
countering slow growth in the global economy by expanding in
Latin America and restructuring operations.  Fourth-quarter sales rose 4 percent to  $2.61 billion  from a
year earlier, Air Products said. Operating margins contracted to
15.7 percent, compared with an estimate of 16.8 percent and
year-earlier margins of 17 percent, Sison said.  Chief Financial Officer Paul Huck, 62, will retire Feb. 28
after 33 years with the company, to be succeeded by Controller
Scott Crocco, 48, according to a separate statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
