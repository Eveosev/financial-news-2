San Francisco Giants catcher  Buster Posey  and Tampa Bay Rays pitcher Fernando Rodney today received
Major League Baseball Comeback Player of the Year awards.  Posey and Rodney, both first-time All-Stars in 2012, were
selected by a group of reporters from MLB.com, baseball
announced today in an e-mailed statement. Given annually since
2005, the award recognizes one player from each league who has
“re-emerged on the field during the season,” according to the
statement.  Posey, 25, captured the National League batting title this
season after hitting .336 with a career-high 24 home runs and
103 runs batted-in. The NL Rookie of the Year in 2010, Posey
played 45 games in 2011 before breaking his leg in a collision
at home plate.  Rodney was 2-2 with 48 saves and a 0.60 earned-run average
this season, his first with the Rays. Last season, as a member
of the Los Angeles Angels, he was 3-5 with a 4.50 ERA and three
saves.  Rodney’s 0.60 ERA in 2012 set a baseball record for relief
pitchers with at least 50 innings pitched, according to the
release. The 35-year-old also won baseball’s most outstanding
relief pitcher award.  -- Editors: Michael Sillup, Jay Beberman  To contact the reporter on this story:
