Societe Generale SA (GLE) ,  France ’s
second-largest bank by market value, agreed to sell its Greek
unit to  Piraeus Bank SA (TPEIR)  to reduce risks tied to  Europe ’s most
indebted nation.  Societe Generale  will sell its 99.1 percent stake in  Geniki
Bank (TGEN)  to Piraeus for 1 million euros ($1.3 million), the Paris-
based bank said in a statement today.  As part of the deal, Societe Generale will inject 281
million euros of capital into Geniki and buy 163 million euros
in bonds from Piraeus. The sale will cut Societe Generale’s
third-quarter net income by about 100 million euros.  Societe Generale is following  Credit Agricole (ACA)  SA in exiting
 Greece  as concern lingers over the country’s future in the euro
area.  Credit Agricole  agreed on Oct. 17 to sell its Emporiki
Bank unit in Greece to Alpha Bank SA on terms that will cut its
third-quarter net income by about 2 billion euros.  Societe Generale will have no funding exposure to Geniki
after completing the sale, which is expected to close before the
end of 2012. The Hellenic Financial Stability Fund approved the
deal, the bank said.  Greece, heading for a sixth year of recession, is
overhauling its banking system after lenders took losses on
government-bond holdings. Geniki’s loan book is a fraction of
the size of those at Greece’s largest banks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
