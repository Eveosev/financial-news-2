  Franshion Properties China Ltd. (817)  is
marketing U.S. dollar-denominated notes as bond sales in the
region surged to a three-week high, buoyed by offerings from
borrowers in  China  and Hong Kong. Credit risk rose.  Franshion, a Hong Kong-based real estate developer with
projects on the mainland, is offering five-year notes at a yield
of about 5.25 percent, according to a person familiar with the
matter, who declined to be identified as the terms aren’t set.
Companies in Asia sold $3.95 billion of bonds this week,
compared with $3.78 billion the five days to Oct. 12 and $300
million the period before that as Chinese banks’ borrowing costs
headed for a sixth weekly advance.  The Shanghai interbank offered rate, or Shibor, for three-
month  yuan  loans reached an 11-week high of  3.71 percent  today.
Syndicated loan volumes in Hong Kong have tumbled 29 percent
this year versus the same period of 2011 while dollar bond sales
in Asia are at a record $103.6 billion, surpassing the $75.8
billion set in all of 2010.  “Low U.S. interest rates make the dollar bond market
attractive for issuers,” said Edwin Chan, the head of Asian
credit research at UBS AG in Hong Kong. “Chinese and Hong Kong
companies are dominating sales because domestic credit
conditions have been tight. The pipeline into 2013 will be
strong.”  Shibor  The six weeks of increases in Shibor is the longest in 21
months, according to the National Interbank Funding Center. The
rate has risen 13 basis points from a two-year low of 3.58
percent on Aug. 13.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  advanced 2 basis points to 115.5 basis
points as of 8:43 a.m. in Hong Kong,  Credit Agricole SA (ACA)  prices
show. The measure declined for the six trading days through
yesterday and is on track to fall 10.7 basis points this week,
according to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index increased 1.5 basis
points to 133.5 as of 11:43 a.m. in Sydney, according to Credit
Agricole. The gauge is on course to fall 17.4 basis points this
week, according to CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and
compiles prices quoted by dealers in the privately negotiated
market.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index rose 1.5 basis points to
208.5 as of 9:28 a.m. in  Tokyo , Citigroup Inc. prices show. A
close at that level would bring the index’s decline for the week
to 14.5 basis points, CMA prices show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
credit quality. A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
