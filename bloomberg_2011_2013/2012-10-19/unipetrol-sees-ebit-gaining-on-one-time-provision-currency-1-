Unipetrol AS (UNIP) , the largest Czech
refiner, said earnings before interest and tax in the third
quarter will reach several hundred million koruna because of a
one-time provision for an anti-monopoly fine and currency gains.  The ebit was boosted by a one-time positive impact of 200
million koruna ($10.5 million) and a foreign exchange gain of
about 130 million koruna, the Prague-based company said in an e-
mailed statement.  Sales of petrochemicals jumped 13 percent in the quarter
from the previous three-month period and 21 percent from year
ago, said the refiner, which is controlled by Polandâ€™s PKN Orlen
SA. Sales of fuels and other refinery products rose 3 percent in
the quarter as motorist season peaked, the company said.  Crude oil throughput increased 3 percent in the quarter
when compared with the previous three-month period, and rose 11
percent from the year-ago period, according to the statement.  The Brent-Urals differential, or the difference between
prices of higher-quality Brent crude and Urals oil that
Unipetrol uses as a profitability gauge, narrowed to 0.7 from
2.1 in the previous quarter, curbing profits from refining.  PKN, which holds 63 percent of Unipetrol, said this morning
operating profit jumped to 1.4 billion zloty ($447 million) as
refining margins tripled.  To contact the reporters on this story:
