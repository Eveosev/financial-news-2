Former  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  managing
director Martyn Dodgson and three others charged with insider
trading were given unconditional bail while they await trial.  Dodgson, Andrew Hind, Benjamin Anderson and Iraj Parvizi
had their cases transferred to Southwark Crown Court in London
for further proceedings on Dec. 21 following a magistrates court
hearing today. The men were charged with conspiracy to commit
insider dealing earlier this month following a two-and-a-half-
year investigation by the U.K. Financial Services Authority.  Neil Saunders, a lawyer for the FSA, told Judge Howard Riddle the men should be released without any bail conditions.
Today was the first court appearance for the defendants, who
were charged at police stations.  Dodgson, who was employed by Deutsche Bank at the time of
his arrest in March 2010, Hind, Anderson and Iraj Parvizi were
charged with “conspiracy to insider deal” between Nov. 1,
2006, and March 23, 2010. The FSA alleges the men made more than
3 million pounds ($4.8 million) on improper trades.  The charges stem from an investigation known as Operation
Tabernula, Latin for little tavern. The FSA arrested seven
people and raided 16 addresses in  London  and southeast  England 
in March 2010 as part of the crackdown. Two more arrests came
later.  Tabernula, conducted along with the U.K. Serious Organised
Crime Agency, is the “largest and most complex insider dealing
investigation to date,” the regulator said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
