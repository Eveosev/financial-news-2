Fighting continued for a fourth day
in the Libyan town of Bani Walid, which the army said has become
a haven for holdout loyalists of former dictator  Muammar Qaddafi .  Army units backed by militias from towns such as Misrata
and Zlitan have been blockading the town since September 25,
when Libya’s parliament, the National Congress, issued a decree
authorizing security forces to enter the town and arrest
individuals accused of a series of kidnappings.  Thick black smoke was visible today rising from the town as
fighting continued despite a 48-hour-truce declared in the
morning by Army Chief of Staff Youseff Mangoush. The truce
declaration was reported by Al Jazeera television, with army
spokesman Mohammed El Gandus saying it was being organized to
allow civilians to flee the town, 90 miles (145 kilometers)
southeast of Tripoli.  “All the families are still here, nobody decided to
leave,” a town official, Abdul Salem Al Fukahi, said in a
telephone interview. “They will stay in their homes and live or
die.”  Army and militia forces have set up camps along a highway
south of the town, and are moving into position Soviet-era tanks
and 155 millimeter howitzers.  El Gandus said yesterday that several hundred Qaddafi
loyalists are in the town, and they face jail if captured.  Tomorrow is the first anniversary of the death of Qaddafi,
who was captured by rebel forces at Sirte, his birthtown, on
Oct. 20, 2011, and died in circumstances that remain in dispute.  To contact the reporter on this story:
