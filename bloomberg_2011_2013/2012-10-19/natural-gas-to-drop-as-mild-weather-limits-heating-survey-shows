Natural gas futures will decline
next week as the outlook for mild weather signaled reduced
demand for the heating fuel, a Bloomberg survey showed.  Five of 10 analysts, or 50 percent, said futures on the  New
York  Mercantile Exchange will fall through Oct. 26. Four, or 40
percent, said prices will rise and one said they will stay the
same. Last week, 54 percent of participants said gas would fall
this week.  Temperatures in the central and eastern U.S. will be above
normal over the next six to 10 days, MDA EarthSat Weather in
Gaithersburg,  Maryland , predicted. The low in  Chicago  on Oct. 24
may be 56 degrees Fahrenheit (13 Celsius), 13 above normal,
while Boston may be 6 above normal at 50 degrees, according to
AccuWeather Inc. in  State College ,  Pennsylvania .  A cold front will then sweep into the eastern half of the
U.S., resulting in below-normal temperatures from Oct. 28
through Nov. 1, a forecast yesterday from Commodity Weather
Group LLC in Bethesda, Maryland, showed.  “We still have moderate weather that is going to temper
prices in the short term,” said  John Woods , president of JJ
Woods Associates and a Nymex floor trader. “On a technical
basis, the market is extremely long. It’s a matter of profit
taking.”  U.S. heating demand will be 43 percent below normal through
Oct. 25, according to Weather Derivatives in Belton,  Missouri .  Stockpile Gain  U.S. inventories  rose 51 billion cubic feet last week to
3.776 trillion, below the five-year average gain for the week of
71 billion, the Energy Department said yesterday. Analyst
 estimates  compiled by Bloomberg forecast a gain of 47 billion.  Gas for November delivery rose 0.6 cent this week to $3.617
per million British thermal units on the Nymex, the highest
settlement price since Dec. 1. Prices are up 21 percent this
year.  The futures may rise to $3.63 next week before dropping
back toward the $3.40 support level, Woods said. Gas rose to a
2012 intraday high of $3.638 on Oct. 12.  Bloomberg’s survey of  natural-gas  analysts and traders asks
for an assessment of whether Nymex natural-gas futures will
probably rise, fall or remain neutral in the coming week. This
week’s results were:  RISE   FALL   NEUTRAL  4      5      1  To contact the reporter on this story:
