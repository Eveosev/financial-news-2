Chemical and Allied Products Plc , a
Nigerian paint and household products maker, climbed for a third
day, reaching the highest in 15 months.  The stock rose 5 percent, giving it a three-day gain of 16
percent, to close at 31.19 naira in Lagos,  Nigeria ’s capital,
the highest since July 11, 2011.  “The company is the leading supplier of paint and
chemicals in the Nigerian economy and as the dry season
approaches, investors are expecting its sales to rise,” David Adonri, chief executive officer of Lambeth Trust and Investment
Co. Ltd., said by phone from Lagos today. Building activities in
Nigeria,  Africa ’s most populous nation, take place mainly during
the dry season lasting from October to April.  First-half net income rose to 577.8 million naira ($3.7
million) from 402.7 million naira, Chemical and Allied said on
Aug. 1. Revenue increased to 2.5 billion naira from 1.96 billion
naira, the Lagos-based company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
