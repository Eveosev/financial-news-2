CEZ AS (CEZ)  hasn’t received  Areva SA (AREVA) ’s
appeal against the decision to exclude it from the tender for
building two nuclear reactors at Temelin, spokeswoman Barbora
Pulpanova said by telephone today.  The Paris-based Areva has until midnight to submit it to
CEZ, according to Czech law.  Areva, the world’s largest supplier of nuclear fuel and
services, was excluded from the $10 billion tender on Oct. 5
because it failed to meet legislative and commercial
requirements of the tender, CEZ said. The French company
immediately said it would appeal the decision.  CEZ, the largest Czech utility, plans to choose a builder
for units 3 and 4 of the Temelin plant by the middle of next
year. The other two bidders, Westinghouse Electric Corp. and a
Russian-Czech consortium led by Rosatom Corp.’s unit ZAO
Atomstroyexport, are still competing for the project.  To contact the reporter on this story:
