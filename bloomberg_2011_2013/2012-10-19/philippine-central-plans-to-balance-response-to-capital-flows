Diwa Guinigundo, deputy governor of
the Philippine central bank, comments on factors it will take
into account at its monetary policy meeting on Oct. 25.  Guinigundo spoke at a conference in  Manila  today.  On indications from financial markets:  “You have to look at monetary and price conditions.
Financial markets give you telltale signs. Is there tightness in
liquidity in the market? Are interest rates posing constraint to
capital formation? These are the things that one should ask next
Thursday.  ‘‘The market is very liquid so even if there’s incremental
increase in demand for local borrowing, I don’t think that would
be enough to push interest rates to unreasonably high levels.  ‘‘We will coordinate with fiscal authorities to balance the
response to surges of capital flows.’’  On factors other than inflation that can determine rates:  ‘‘You don’t just look at inflation or one or two
indicators. You have to look at macro-economy in general. While
inflation is very manageable, does that authorize you to reduce
your policy rates? Or if inflation rate is nearing the upper end
of the target, should you immediately tighten monetary policy?
We’ll have to look at the global economy and of course the
domestic economy. Inflows are one of the risks.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
