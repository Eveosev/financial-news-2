A Formula One race in  New Jersey 
was postponed a year until 2014 after organizers “misjudged”
the commercial and logistic requirements for hosting the event,
series chief executive  Bernie Ecclestone  said.  “They didn’t really realize how difficult it is to arrange
these things, commercially and with everything else,”
Ecclestone said by telephone today.  The race was to be run along the waterfront in Weehawken
and West  New York , across the Hudson River from New York City.
It was placed on the 2013 Formula One calendar last month with
an asterisk alongside showing it wasn’t confirmed.  Citing Mayor Richard Turner of Weehawken, New Jersey, the
Jersey Journal reported yesterday that the race was canceled
because road repairs and permits for the 3.2-mile (5-kilometer)
course are behind schedule.  Event promoter  Leo Hindery , managing partner at InterMedia
Partners LP, said as recently on Oct. 5 the race would go ahead
as planned on June 16, 2013.  Formula One, the most-watched auto racing series, is
scheduled to return to the U.S. for the first time since 2007 on
Nov. 18 at a new $300 million track in Austin, Texas.  To contact the reporters on this story:
