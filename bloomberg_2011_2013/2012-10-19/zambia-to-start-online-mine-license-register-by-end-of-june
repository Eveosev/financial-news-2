Zambia , Africa’s biggest copper
producer, will introduce an online cadastre system for its
mineral licenses in the first half of next year, according to
the company developing the software.  Cape Town-based  Spatial Dimensions  will develop an
Internet-based system to improve transparency in applying for,
awarding and paying for mineral rights, Charles Young, the
company’s government sector consultant, said by mobile phone.  “The idea is to do all transactions online,” with no cash
changing hands, he said. The system will be in operation “by
late in the first half of 2013.”  Zambian President  Michael Sata  promised to root out
corruption in the public service in the run-up to his election
victory in September last year. The International Finance Corp.,
a unit of the  World Bank , ranked the southern African country 84
out of 183 economies in its  2012 Ease of Doing Business  report.  A call to the Zambian Ministry of Mines, Energy and Water
made after normal business hours went unanswered.  To contact the reporter on this story:
