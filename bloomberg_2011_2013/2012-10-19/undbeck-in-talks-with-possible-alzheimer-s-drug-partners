H. Lundbeck A/S (LUN) , the Nordic region’s
second-largest drugmaker, failed to win recommendation from the
European Union’s drug regulator for a treatment for Alzheimer’s
disease.  Studies presented by the company had negative results or
didn’t demonstrate a clear benefit for Acrescent, which combines
two substances, memantine hydrochloride and donepezil
hydrochloride, which already have approval in the European Union
as separate treatments, the European Medicines Agency said in a
 statement  today.  “The company had not provided enough evidence to support
the use of a combination tablet” in patients with moderate to
moderately severe Alzheimer’s disease, the EMA said.  Lundbeck is also developing another treatment for
Alzheimer’s disease, AE58054, and released positive results from
a mid-stage study in May. Late-stage trials will begin as early
as the end of this year, and the company is in talks with
several potential partners to help develop the drug, Chief
Executive Officer Ulf Wiinberg said in August.  “The assessment of success was very cautious” for this
drug, Simon Augustesen, a spokesman for Lundbeck, said by phone.
The company hasn’t factored in sales from the drug in any profit
forecasts, he said.  The company expects to announce a partner for AE58054 by
the end of the first half of next year, Augustesen also said.  Donepezil is sold as Aricept by Eisai Co. and  Pfizer Inc. (PFE) 
Forest Laboratories Inc. sells memantine as Namenda.  To contact the reporter on this story:
