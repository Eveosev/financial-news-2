Vietnam ’s five-year bonds fell for a
ninth week, the longest stretch since August, on concern
inflation will accelerate. The dong was little changed.  The government will undertake “drastic” measures to keep
consumer-price gains below 10 percent in 2012, Finance Minister
Vuong Dinh Hue said Oct. 14. The government said two weeks ago
it will strive to curb annual  inflation  to 8 percent after costs
in the economy rose 6.48 percent in September, the first
acceleration in more than a year.  “Investors are worried that with the return of inflation
the central bank won’t reduce  interest rates  any more,” said
Nguyen Duy Phong, a Ho Chi Minh City-based analyst at Viet
Capital Securities.  The yield on the bonds rose five basis points, or 0.05
percentage point, this week to 10.37 percent, according to a
daily fixing rate from banks compiled by Bloomberg. The yield
was unchanged today.  The dong traded at 20,843 per dollar as of 4:02 p.m. in
Hanoi, compared with 20,845 yesterday, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The currency has gained 0.1 percent this
week.  The  State Bank  of Vietnam set its reference rate at 20,828,
unchanged since Dec. 26, according to its website. The currency
is allowed to trade up to 1 percent on either side of the rate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
