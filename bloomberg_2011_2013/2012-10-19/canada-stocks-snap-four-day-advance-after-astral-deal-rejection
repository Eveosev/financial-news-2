Canadian  stocks  fell for the first
time in a week after regulators rejected  BCE Inc. (BCE) ’s C$3 billion
($3.1 billion) bid to acquire  Astral Media Inc. (ACM/A)  and data
signaled weakening economic growth.  Astral, a Quebec specialty channel provider, slumped 15
percent for the biggest drop in at least 24 years after the
Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission said
the deal would place too much market power with one company. BCE
slipped 1.4 percent.  Niko Resources Ltd. (NKO)  tumbled 14 percent
after the natural gas producer lowered its full-year production
forecast.  The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index (SPTSX)  lost 76.43
points, or 0.6 percent, to 12,389.69 at 12:38 p.m. in Toronto.
The benchmark equity gauge is up 1.6 percent this week, on pace
for its biggest gain in more than a month. Bank and energy
stocks contributed most to declines on the S&P/TSX as all 10
industries retreated.  “The decision by the CRTC yesterday not to allow BCE to
buy Astral is not very good news as far as mergers and
acquisitions is concerned,” said Stephen Gauthier, a fund
manager with Fin-XO Securities Inc. in  Montreal . His firm
manages about C$600 million ($605 million). “There were also
inflation numbers that were below expectations, it shows the
Canadian economy is really slowing down.”  Consumer prices advanced less than economists forecast last
month, suggesting Bank of  Canada  Governor Mark Carney doesn’t
need to emphasize raising interest rates at next week’s
decision. The  consumer price index  rose 1.2 percent in September
from a year ago, matching the August pace, Statistics Canada
said.  Inflation Data  The central bank’s preferred core rate slowed to 1.3
percent from 1.6 percent in August, the least in more than a
year. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg forecast total inflation
of 1.3 percent and a core rate of 1.4 percent.  Barrick Gold Corp. (ABX) , the world’s largest gold producer, lost
0.3 percent to C$38.25 as bullion headed for the biggest weekly
decline since June. Gold futures for December delivery fell 1.3
percent to $1,723.26 an ounce in New York.  Astral lost 15 percent to C$39.56. BCE, Canada’s largest
telecommunications company, retreated 1.4 percent to C$42.89.  “Assuming Bell moves on, we don’t see any other party
stepping forward to bid on Astral in totality,” said Adam Shine, analyst with National Bank Financial, in a note to
clients today. “As to any urgency to scramble a deal together,
we’re not convinced anyone needs to move quickly.”  Corus Downgraded  Corus Entertainment Inc. (CJR/B) , a rival television media company,
sank 3.9 percent to C$22.09 after Shine cut the firm’s rating to
sector perform from outperform. He trimmed his one-year price
forecast to C$24 from C$26 on forecasts for lower valuations
after the CRTC decision.  Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. (CNQ)  slipped 1.2 percent to
C$30.59 and  Cenovus Energy Inc. (CVE)  retreated 1.2 percent to C$34.12
as crude declined for a second day. Oil for November delivery
dropped 1.9 percent to $90.71 a barrel in New York.  Oil drilling services companies dropped after Schlumberger
Ltd., the world’s largest oilfield-services provider, said in
its third-quarter earnings report that it expects lower growth
in Canada in the coming quarters.  Trican Well Service Ltd. (TCW) 
dropped 3.5 percent to C$13.14 and Precision Drilling Corp. fell
1.6 percent to C$8.05.  Niko, the worst-performing stock in the S&P/TSX this year,
sank 14 percent to C$12.05. The company said it will pre-pay $90
million of its $310 million convertible debt due at the end of
the year and evaluate options to pay for the rest.  “We believe this update is somewhat disappointing, in
particular given our anticipation of further advancement on debt
repaying,” said Jared Dziuba, analyst with BMO Capital Markets,
in a research note today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
