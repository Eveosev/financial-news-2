Bonds of  Supervalu Inc. (SVU)  rose the
most since they were issued three years ago after the third-
largest U.S. grocery store chain said it’s received a “number
of indications of interest” as it conducts a review of
strategic options.  The company is in “active dialogue” with several parties,
the  Eden Prairie , Minnesota-based company said yesterday in a
statement. The talks may not lead to any sale, the company said.  Supervalu’s $1 billion of 8 percent bonds have climbed 5.5
cents since Oct. 17 to 89.75 cents on the dollar to yield 11.6
percent at 11:26 a.m. in New York, according to Trace, the bond-
price reporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority. That’s the biggest two-day gain for the securities
since they were offered in April 2009, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  The supermarket chain reported  sales  yesterday that dropped
4.6 percent in its fiscal second quarter, the 14th straight
quarterly decline. Supervalu has $3.9 billion of bonds
 outstanding , Bloomberg data show.  The company has 1,099 traditional retail stores such as
Jewel-Osco and Albertsons and has 1,341 Save-A-Lot discount
locations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
