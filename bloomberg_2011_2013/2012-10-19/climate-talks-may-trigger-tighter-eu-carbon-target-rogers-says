Climate talks starting Nov. 26 in
Doha, Qatar, may help trigger a tighter emissions-reduction
target in the European Union within three years, according to
Chris Rogers, a Bloomberg Industries analyst in  London .  While Poland, for instance, is not immediately interested
in supporting tighter carbon limits, the United Nations
Framework on Climate Change Convention talks through Dec. 7 may
prompt the start of negotiations among EU member states, Rogers
said today by phone. “Something could be sorted in the next two
to three years.”  A tighter cap would boost carbon permits, which already
advanced 37 percent since a record low on April 4, Rogers said
today in an research note. “A rise in the CO2 price would aid
generators via higher power prices, and raise the value of the
industrials’ surplus permits.”  The EU has pledged to cut emissions by at least 20 percent
in the two decades through 2020 and as much as 30 percent,
assuming other developed nations agree to make cuts.  The European Federation of Energy Traders suggested this
week the region could boost the pace of yearly carbon-reduction
cuts in its emissions market to help deal with a glut of
allowances and ease cuts needed after 2020.  “If the trajectory were to be aligned with the EU long-
term targets in 2013, this could already be met with relatively
modest efforts and a reduction factor of 2.2 percent,” the
lobby group said in a  position paper  published on its website
and dated Oct. 16. Under current rules, the factor is 1.74
percent a year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
