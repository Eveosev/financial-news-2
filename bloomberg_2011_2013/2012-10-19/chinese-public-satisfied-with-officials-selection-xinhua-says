 The Chinese public has become more
satisfied with the way the country’s officials are selected and
managed, the official Xinhua News Agency reported today, citing
survey results from the statistics bureau.  The public gave higher scores for this year’s personnel
selection, which was handled by the Organization Department of
the Communist Party’s  Central Committee , and for the
department’s work in preventing corruption and guaranteeing the
enrollment of high-quality personnel, according to the poll
conducted by the National Bureau of Statistics. The scores
increased for five consecutive years, Xinhua reported, citing an
unidentified official from the bureau.  The party’s 18th congress, at which a once-a-decade
leadership transition will be finalized, begins Nov. 8. Vice
President  Xi Jinping  is forecast to succeed President  Hu Jintao 
as party general secretary, and would take over as China’s
president early next year.  The survey, which polled 79,178 people, was conducted
through a third party survey agency, according to Xinhua.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
