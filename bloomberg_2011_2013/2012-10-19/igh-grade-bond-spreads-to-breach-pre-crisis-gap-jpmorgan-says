Relative yields  on U.S. investment-
grade bonds are poised to tighten to the least since 2007 as the
Federal Reserve’s program to buy up mortgage debt boosts demand
for company obligations, according to  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)   The extra yield investors demand to own corporate
debentures instead of Treasuries will likely drop to 135 basis
points, or 1.35 percentage points, by the end of the year,
compared with 148 basis points Oct. 17, JPMorgan strategists led
by  Eric Beinstein  wrote today in a report. The gauge hasn’t
breached that level since July 2007, a year before the collapse
of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., according to the analysts,
whose forecast is lower than a previous year-end estimate of 150
basis points.  While a “frenzy” for high-grade debt that has pushed
 borrowing costs  to record lows will probably slow considerably,
the Fed’s open-ended mortgage purchases announced last month to
support housing and boost employment “is a powerful force for
lower spreads,” the strategists wrote. “Many investors hold
corporate bonds as part of a fixed-income portfolio which also
includes mortgage bonds, so the rally in mortgages has increased
the relative attractiveness of corporate.”  The biggest near-term risk to a sustained rally is that
policy makers won’t reach a compromise to raise the nation’s
debt ceiling and avert the so-called fiscal cliff of $607
billion in federal spending cuts and tax increases scheduled to
take effect in January, the analysts said in the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
