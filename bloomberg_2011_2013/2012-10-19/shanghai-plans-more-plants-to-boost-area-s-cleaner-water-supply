Shanghai ,  China ’s biggest city with
about 23 million people, plans to build two more plants in the
Nanhui area to add cleaner water supplies from the Qingcaosha
reservoir.  The facilities will have the capacity to provide 600,000
cubic meters of water per day to meet demand arising from growth
and economic development in the area, the  Shanghai Water
Authority  said in a website  statement . No costs were given.  The water authority’s announcement comes after the Hangtou
and Huinan plants at Nanhui started operating this month, each
with a daily capacity of 240,000 cubic meters. The Qingcaosha
reservoir currently supplies cleaner water to about 13 million
residents in the city, the authority said.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
