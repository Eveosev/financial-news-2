China  will avoid a hard landing even
as economic growth slows in the third quarter,  Fitch Ratings 
said, after trimming its forecast for the full-year expansion of
gross domestic product last month.  China’s third-quarter year-on-year GDP growth of 7.4
percent was in line with the rating company’s estimate of 7
percent to 8 percent for the years 2012 to 2014, Fitch said in a
statement yesterday. Growth is slower than the 9 percent to 10
percent in 2008 to 2011.  Fitch cut its prediction for 2012 GDP growth to 7.8 percent
from 8 percent in its September Global Outlook.  The current slowdown is less severe than the sharp drop
after the global financial crisis of 2008, so modest fiscal
stimulus and a strong labor market may bring China’s growth
closer to 8 percent by year-end and to 8.2 percent in 2013,
Fitch said.  Over the longer term, China needs to move away from over-
reliance on investment toward consumption for more stable
growth, Fitch said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
