U.S. feedlots bought 19 percent
fewer cattle in September than a year earlier amid tight animal
supplies and as rising feed costs brought on by the worst
drought in 56 years curbed profitability prospects.  Feedlots bought 2.004 million head of young cattle last
month, down from 2.469 million in September 2011, the  U.S.
Department of Agriculture  said today in a report. Purchases were
the fewest for any September since the USDA began tracking the
figure in 1996. Twelve analysts surveyed by  Bloomberg News 
projected a 15 percent decline, on average. The feedlot herd
totaled 10.989 million as of Oct. 1, down 2.6 percent from a
year earlier. Analysts expected a 2.1 percent decline.  The price of corn, the main ingredient in livestock feed,
was up 18 percent this year through yesterday after the
government projected the U.S. harvest will be the smallest in
six years, as hot, dry weather eroded yields. High feed costs
mean feedlots probably lost about $130 a head on cattle sold in
September,  Rich Nelson , chief strategist for Allendale Inc. in
McHenry,  Illinois , said in a telephone interview.  “Tightening feeder supplies as well as negative feeding
returns limited placements,”  Elaine Johnson , an analyst at
Cattlehedging.com in Westminster,  Colorado , said in an e-mail
before the report.  Feedlot operators buy year-old animals that weigh 500
pounds (227 kilograms) to 800 pounds, called feeders. The cattle
are fattened on corn for about four to five months until they
weigh about 1,200 pounds, when they are sold to meatpackers.  Feedlots sold about 1.598 million animals to meatpackers
last month, down 12 percent from a year earlier, the USDA said.
Analysts expected 10 percent decline, on average.  Fattened cattle futures for December delivery declined 0.4
percent to $1.27475 a pound at 12:09 p.m. on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange. The price was up 5.4 percent this year
through yesterday.  Feeder-cattle futures for January settlement fell 0.1
percent to $1.505 a pound, and the commodity dropped 1.2 percent
in 2012 before today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
