The Philippine peso dropped for a
second day as an increase in U.S. jobless claims and company
earnings that missed forecasts damped demand for riskier assets.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index of  equities  retreated for the
first time in four days after  Google Inc. (GOOG) , Philip Morris
International Inc. and Microsoft Corp. reported profits and
sales that trailed estimates. U.S. unemployment claims rose to
388,000 in the week ended Oct. 13, more than the 365,000
predicted in a Bloomberg survey.  “The rise in jobless claims didn’t help sentiment,” said
Saktiandi Supaat, head of foreign-exchange research at  Malayan
Banking Bhd. (MAY)  in  Singapore . “Risk appetite also retreated
because of the lower-than-expected earnings from some of the
U.S. multinationals.”  The peso fell 0.2 percent to 41.385 per dollar as of 4:31
p.m. in Manila, trimming this week’s advance to 0.1 percent,
according to Tullett Prebon Plc. The currency dropped 0.4
percent yesterday, the biggest decline this month.  One-month implied volatility for the peso, a measure of
exchange-rate swings used to price options, was little changed
today at 5.25  percent. It fell five basis points this week.  The country had a balance of payments surplus of $751
million in September, up from $582 million in August, data from
the central bank showed today.  Government bonds  were little changed today. The yield on
the 4.75 percent notes due September 2022 held at 4.70 percent,
according to data from Tradition Financial Services. It fell
three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, this week.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
