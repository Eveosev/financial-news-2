Brazil plans to provide tax breaks
for asset-backed funds that focus on infrastructure projects as
part of an effort to develop local  capital markets .  A rule to be published before the end of the year will
exempt the so-called FIDC funds from income tax for retail and
foreign investors, and provide a 10-percentage-point discount on
the tax for local institutional investors, said Ernesto Lozardo,
adviser to the presidency of the Brazilian  development bank 
BNDES, in an interview yesterday in Sao Paulo.  “We want to put all the instruments available for the
capital markets to get help financing the infrastructure needs
in Brazil”, Lozardo said, adding that the new tax breaks will
mimic those designed for buyers of local corporate bonds sold to
finance infrastructure projects.  The tax incentives are designed to help  Brazil  develop
local debt markets to help finance 1 trillion reais ($493
billion) in projects for roads, factories and airports.
Currently local long-term funding is only provided by the
development bank.  The asset-backed funds would help achieve the goal because
many foreign institutional investors would prefer to use such
instruments, because they reduce credit risk attached to the
projects, Lozardo said.  Infrastructure-linked local bonds give foreign and local
retail investors tax exemptions as long as they have a duration
longer than four years. A debenture fund has the same incentive
only if 67 percent of the fund assets are related to approved
projects.  To contact the reporter on this story:
