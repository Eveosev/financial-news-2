The  South African Sugar Association 
cut its annual estimate for production of the crop by almost 4
percent as recent rains came too late to boost cane growing.  The sugar crop, of which the harvest is almost complete, is
estimated at 2.1 million metric tons, down from a July
prediction of 2.2 million tons, the Mount Edgecombe-based
organization said on its website today. It expects 17.9 million
tons of cane to be crushed, up from last year’s 16.8 million
tons, according to the association.  “The recent rainfall will not affect this season’s harvest
as the season is almost coming to an end,” Jennifer Crawford, a
spokeswoman for SASA, said in an e-mailed reply to questions.
“It will however assist in improving the cane crop in the
2013-14 season.”  Sugarcane farmers crushed 19.2 million tons of sugar in
2009 before a drought cut production in 2010 and 2011, according
to data from the association. A nationwide strike by about
20,000 truck drivers, which started on Sept. 24 and lasted for 2
1/2 weeks, halted production at sugar mills in the country’s
Mpumalanga province.  To contact the reporter on this story:
