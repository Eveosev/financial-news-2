Caterpillar Inc. (CAT)  Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer  Doug Oberhelman  said the U.S. and China “need
each other” as the global economy slows.  Caterpillar, the world’s largest maker of construction and
mining equipment, sees China as a “huge opportunity” as its
population grows and rapidly moves into the middle class,
Oberhelman said today at an Economic Club of Chicago event.  Oberhelman, who supports former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney in the U.S. presidential election, said he worries about
the current political debate regarding trade with China and
other countries and Caterpillar needs open foreign markets.  The Peoria, Illinois-based company, which is a net exporter
to the Asian country from the U.S., is working to be the market
leader in China by 2015. Almost two-thirds of its 2011 sales
came from outside  North America .  “China and the U.S. need each other desperately,”
Oberhelman said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
