Indonesia ’s government bonds
rallied, pushing the yield on 10-year notes to the lowest level
in almost 11 weeks, as global funds increased investments and
the Southeast Asian nation’s credit rating was raised.  The yield on the notes maturing in 2022 declined for a
seventh day after global funds added 3.83 trillion rupiah ($400
million) to their sovereign  debt holdings  this month through
Oct. 17, Finance Ministry data show. Indonesia was returned to
 investment grade  at Tokyo-based Rating and Investment
Information Inc., the central bank said yesterday.  “Investors are long Indonesia to get higher returns,”
said Billie Fuliangsahar, the head of treasury at PT Rabobank
International Indonesia. “Foreign investors still rely on
rating agencies when it comes to Indonesia, as they are not very
familiar with the market.”  The yield on the government’s 7 percent bonds maturing in
May 2022 fell 13 basis points, or 0.13 percentage point, this
week to 5.73 percent as of 9:06 a.m. in Jakarta, according to
prices from the Inter Dealer Market Association. That’s the
lowest level since Aug. 7. The rate dropped two basis points
today.  The rupiah traded at 9,588 per dollar, after closing at the
same level yesterday and last week, prices from local banks
compiled by Bloomberg show. The currency reached 9,657 on Oct.
11, the weakest level since October 2009.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate
swings used to price options, held at 6 percent this week and
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
