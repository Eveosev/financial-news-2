Argentinaâ€™s Cablevision SA, the
cable television company of Grupo Clarin SA, is concerned the
government may seize its assets by year end, La Nacion reported,
citing company President Carlos Moltini.  The government is urging Grupo Clarin to sell assets in
order to meet limits imposed by a 2009 media bill before Dec. 7,
the Buenos Aires-based newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
