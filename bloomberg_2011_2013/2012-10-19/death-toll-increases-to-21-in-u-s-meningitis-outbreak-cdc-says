Twenty-one people in the U.S. have
died from a fungal meningitis outbreak linked to tainted steroid
injections for back pain, health authorities said.  The contaminated drugs are tied to 271 reported illnesses
in 16 states, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention said today in an update  posted  on its website. The
 Food and Drug Administration  has informed states which hospitals
and clinics received products from the New England Compounding
Center connected to the outbreak, Sarah Clark-Lynn, a
spokeswoman for the agency, said today in a telephone interview.  Medicines meant to be injected that were made by the
pharmacy may be contaminated, the agency has said. The FDA plans
to list on its website the health-care providers that bought any
drugs from NECC, Clark-Lynn said.  “We have reason to believe they were working in all 50
states,” she said.  Delaware has made public its list of 13 health-care
providers who received drugs from the pharmacy. The state’s
information includes whether the products are injectable or not.  “We wanted to get out our list as soon as possible,” Jill
Fredel, a spokeswoman for the  Delaware  Department of Health and
Social Services, said in an e-mail. The state has no reported
meningitis illness, according to the CDC.  New England Compounding Pharmacy Inc., which used the name
New England Compounding Center, suspended operations this month
and recalled 17,676 doses of the steroid after reports linked
the drug to the fungal meningitis infections. The steroid was
shipped to 75 hospitals and clinics in 23 states, the FDA has
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
