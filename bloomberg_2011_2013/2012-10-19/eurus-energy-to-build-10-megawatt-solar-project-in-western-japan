Eurus Energy Holdings Corp., a
Japanese developer of renewable energy projects, will build a
solar power station with a capacity of 10 megawatts in western
 Japan .  The plant will use about 47,000 panels made by Japanâ€™s
 Mitsubishi Electric Corp. (6503)  and Hyundai Heavy Industries Co. of
South Korea in a multi-purpose park in Misaki town, Osaka
prefecture, Eurus said in a  statement  yesterday.  Enough power will be generated for 3,900 households, or
about half of Misaki town, according to the statement. All
electricity generated will be sold to Kansai Electric Power Co.  Construction will start in November with completion
scheduled for August 2013, the statement said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
