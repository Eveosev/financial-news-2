The Estonian Central Bank has been
investing in exchange-traded equity funds since earlier this
year to lower investment risks from being too centered on the
euro area,  Postimees  reported, citing central bank officials.  The central bank expects equity investments to reach the
planned threshold of between 5 percent and 10 percent of its
total investment assets of about 350 million euros ($457
million) within five years, Janno Luurmees, the head of the
bankâ€™s financial markets department was cited as saying. The
central bank has also started investing in non-euro area bond
markets, officials were cited as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
