Orco Property Group SA (ORCO)  touched its
highest level in almost five months after Gamala Ltd. and
Crestline Ventures Corp. acquired a 21 percent stake, becoming
the developers’ largest shareholders.  Orco  rose  2.7 koruna, or 3.7 percent, to 75.7 koruna as of
12 p.m. in  Prague , the highest level since May 29.  Cyprus-based Gamala and the British Virgin Islands-
registered Crestline said late yesterday in a BusinessWire
statement that they may consider purchasing more shares
depending on the market price. The new shareholders will seek
representation on the company’s board of directors, they said in
the statement.  Czech billionaire Radovan Vitek, who also owns Czech
Property Investments AS, a real estate company, is behind the
purchases, Hospodarske Noviny reported, citing a person familiar
with the transaction.  Vitek declined to comment when asked by  Bloomberg News 
today, according to a text message.  To contact the reporter on this story:
