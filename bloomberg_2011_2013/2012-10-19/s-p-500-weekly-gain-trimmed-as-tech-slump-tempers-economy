U.S. stocks  rose for the week as
better-than-estimated economic data triggered a three-day rally,
before gains were trimmed in the final two sessions amid worse-
than-forecast results at Google Inc. and  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)   The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index ended the week with a two-
day slump as Google and Microsoft sank at least 1.9 percent.
Commodity and financial companies climbed the most among 10  S&P
500 (SPX)   groups  as  Citigroup Inc. (C)  posted a surprise profit and Murphy
Oil Corp. said it will spin off its U.S. refined fuels business.
 PulteGroup Inc. (PHM)  surged 15 percent, driving homebuilders to the
biggest advance since June, after new-home construction jumped
to a four-year high.  The S&P 500 added 0.3 percent to 1,433.19 for the week,
trimming a three-day gain of 2.3 percent. The Dow Jones
Industrial Average climbed 14.66 points, or 0.1 percent, to
13,343.51. The gauges are up 14 percent and 9.2 percent,
respectively, for the year.  “It’s a choppy environment,”  Ralph Shive , the South Bend,
Indiana-based manager of the $1.3 billion Wasatch-Large Cap
Value Fund, said in a phone interview. “Housing is a welcome
uptick. The global economy is slowing down and technology has
been one of the biggest culprits.”  Equities gained as reports showed retail sales and
industrial production increased more than forecast in September
and new-house construction jumped to the highest since 2008.
Better-than-expected data have driven the Bloomberg Economic
Surprise Index, which compares 38 indicators with analysts’
predictions, to 0.19, the highest level since April 13. The
index this week turned positive for the first time since May.  50-Day Average  The S&P 500 rallied as much as 15 percent from a June low
amid unprecedented monetary stimulus from the Federal Reserve to
boost economic growth. Since peaking at its highest level since
December 2007 on Sept. 14, the index has been stuck in a  37-
point range  on a closing basis.  The drop on the final day of the week took the  S&P 500 
below its average in the past 50 days for the first time since
June 28 on a closing basis, ending a 78-day streak that was the
second-longest since the bull market began in March 2009, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  “The market has been decently resilient,” Tim Hoyle,
director of research at Radnor, Pennsylvania-based Haverford
Trust Co., which manages $6 billion, said in an Oct. 18 phone
interview. “We went into the earnings season with very dire
expectations. So far they haven’t been specifically horrible,
but there are definitely specific cases where we do see earnings
came in weaker than expected.”  Analysts Estimates  Per-share  profits  have exceeded analysts’ estimates at
about 69 percent of the 117 companies in the S&P 500 that
released results so far, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Earnings have increased less than 0.1 percent for the
group on a 1.8 percent gain in sales.  Forecasts for third-quarter profits have grown more
optimistic as the earnings season progresses. Analysts now
project a 0.3 percent drop in S&P 500 earnings for the period,
according to a Bloomberg survey, compared with a decrease of 2
percent predicted on Sept. 28.  An index of computer and Internet stocks slumped 2.4
percent for the biggest retreat for the week among 10 S&P 500
industry groups. Sales by technology companies have missed
analysts’ estimates by an average 1.4 percent during the
earnings season, worse than any other groups, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  Google, Microsoft  Google (GOOG)  tumbled 8.5 percent for the week, the most in more
than a year, to $681.79. The operator of the largest search
engine reported third-quarter revenue, minus some items, of
$11.3 billion, short of the average estimate for $11.8 billion,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The biggest seller of search-based advertising hasn’t yet
translated to mobile devices the success it’s had with desktop
advertising. The average amount advertisers paid each time a
user clicks on a promotion declined about 15 percent from a year
earlier, and was 3 percent less than the prior period.  Microsoft slipped 1.9 percent to $28.64. The largest
software maker reported fiscal first-quarter sales and profit
that  missed estimates  on declining sales of Windows, its
flagship operating system.  International Business Machines Corp. (IBM)  fell 7 percent to
$193.36 for the biggest retreat in the Dow. The largest
computer-services company reported third-quarter revenue that
fell short of estimates as clients delayed orders.  Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD)  plunged 20 percent, the most
since November 2008, to $2.18. The second-largest maker of
processors for personal computers forecast fourth-quarter sales
that will miss analysts’ estimates and said it will cut 15
percent of its staff.  Financial Shares  Financial shares in the S&P 500 advanced 2 percent during
the week as the group’s earnings exceeded analysts’ estimates by
an average 13 percent, the most among the 10 industries, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  Citigroup rose 6.9 percent to $37.16. The lender reported a
 surprise  third-quarter profit and a surge in bond-trading
revenue that beat analysts’ estimates. The company’s board
replaced Chief Executive Officer  Vikram Pandit  with  Michael
Corbat , who ran the Europe, Middle East and Africa unit.  Pandit was ousted after the board concluded he had
mismanaged operations, leading to setbacks with regulators and a
loss of credibility with investors, a person with knowledge of
the discussions said. The change prompted  Michael Mayo , a CLSA
Ltd. analyst who spent the past five years telling investors to
sell Citigroup stock, to reverse his stance.  Travelers Rallies  Travelers Cos. rallied 7 percent to $73.51 for the biggest
increase in the Dow. The insurer said its profit more than
doubled on lower claims costs tied to natural disasters.  Bank of New York Mellon Corp. (BK) , the world’s largest custody
bank, climbed 8.1 percent to $24.68 after earnings increased a
bigger-than-estimated 11 percent amid an expansion in customer
assets.  Murphy Oil (MUR)  advanced 6 percent to $62.20. The energy company
plans to spin off its U.S. refined fuels business, which
provided 85 percent of its 2011 revenue, after hedge fund Third
Point LLC said the company should shed assets. The spinoff
includes distribution terminals and ethanol plants, the company
said.  An S&P index of  homebuilders  jumped 8.8 percent to the
highest level since August 2007. PulteGroup soared 15 percent to
$17.89 while  Lennar Corp. (LEN)  gained 8.3 percent to $38.73.  Johnson & Johnson (JNJ)  climbed 5.7 percent to $71.86. The

medical tools acquired with the Synthes Inc. purchase. The
company raised its 2012 forecast.  Dean Foods  Dean Foods Co. (DF) , the largest U.S. dairy processor, rose the
most in the S&P 500, surging 22 percent to $18.30. Its WhiteWave
Foods Co. unit, the maker of Silk almond milk, filed to raise as
much as $320 million as Dean tries to generate cash to pay off
debt.  Apollo Group Inc. (APOL)  tumbled 29 percent, the most in the S&P
500, to $20.39. The largest U.S. for-profit college chain
forecast revenue for fiscal 2013 that missed analysts’ estimates
and said it would close campuses and cut jobs.  McDonald’s Corp. (MCD)  lost 4.1 percent, the most since June, to
$88.72. The world’s largest restaurant chain by sales reported
third-quarter profit fell 3.5 percent. Sales at U.S. stores open
