Honeywell International Inc. (HON) 
reported a third-quarter profit that beat analysts’ estimates
and cut its full-year sales forecast on weaker demand for
aerospace parts and falling auto production in  Europe .  The Morris Township, New Jersey-based maker of
turbochargers and cockpit controls now sees 2012 sales of as
much as $37.7 billion, down from a range of $37.8 billion to
$38.4 billion, according to a statement today.  After increased production of commercial airplanes drove
aerospace sales last quarter, Honeywell anticipates a revenue
drop of as much as 2 percent in the division this quarter, amid
weaker aftermarket sales and defense cuts. Honeywell, facing
recessions in Europe and lower demand for short-cycle products
in  China , joined industrial peers General Electric Co. and
 Parker Hannifin Corp. (PH)  in cutting forecasts today.  “The outlook for the fourth quarter and into 2013 is
pretty cautious,” Robert Stallard, an analyst with RBC Capital
Markets in New York, said in a note today about Honeywell.
“Given the limited visibility in shorter cycle areas like
Transportation we view this conservatism as warranted.”  Honeywell advanced 2.1 percent to $62.73 at 10:46 a.m. in
New York. The  shares  had gained 13 percent this year through
yesterday.  Net income rose 10 percent to $950 million, or $1.20 a
share, from $862 million, or $1.10, a year earlier, when
Honeywell recorded a 23-cent gain from a unit sale. That beat
the $1.14 average of analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Profit margin from business segments increased 1.1
percentage points to 15.8 percent. A lower tax rate of 22.7
percent, compared with 23.2 percent a year earlier, added about
6 cents to earnings per share, Stallard said.  ‘Strong Earnings Growth’  “We delivered strong earnings growth and margin expansion
while continuing our investments, our seed-planting for the
future, despite a deceleration across a number of our end
markets,” Chief Executive Officer Dave Cote said on a
conference call with analysts.  Third-quarter  sales  advanced 0.5 percent to $9.34 billion,
missing the $9.5 billion average prediction.  The company narrowed its full-year  target  for earnings per
share to $4.45 to $4.50 from a previous range of $4.40 to $4.55.
Honeywell forecast fourth-quarter adjusted earnings per share of
$1.13 to $1.18, according to a slide presentation on its
website. That’s lower than the $1.19 average of estimates.  For 2013, “we are planning for a continued challenging
macro environment,” Cote said in the statement.  Sales in the transportation unit may slump as much as 12
percent in the fourth quarter, Honeywell said.  A boom in U.S. natural gas drilling of shale rock
formations and global demand for petrochemicals spurred profit
at the UOP unit, which provides technology that helps convert
coal to plastics and produce high-octane gasoline.  “We continue to be encouraged by the commercial aerospace
outlook, increasing infrastructure spending, and oil and gas
investments,” Cote said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
