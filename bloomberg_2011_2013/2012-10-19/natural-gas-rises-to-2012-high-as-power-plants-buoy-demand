Natural gas advanced to a 10-month
high in New York on speculation that above-normal demand from
electricity generators will help reduce a supply surplus.  Gas rose 0.8 percent after an Energy Department report
yesterday showed inventories expanded by 51 billion cubic feet,
less than the five-year average gain of 71 billion for the week.
Supplies climbed 106 billion a year earlier. Power plants are
burning record amounts of the fuel this year as seasonal prices
near decade lows prompted switching from coal.  “Natural gas is still being consumed in the electric power
sector without being displaced by coal,” said Tom Saal, senior
vice president of energy trading at INTL Hencorp Futures LLC in
Miami. “We’ll see how long that lasts as we go into winter if
prices go higher.”  Natural gas for November delivery gained 3 cents to settle
at $3.617 per million British thermal units on the New York
Mercantile Exchange, the highest settlement since Dec. 1. The
futures have jumped 21 percent this year. Prices rose 6 cents
this week.  November $3.75 calls were the most active gas options in
electronic trading. They were down 0.2 cent to 2.7 cents on
volume of 774 contracts as of 3:11 p.m. Calls accounted for 59
percent of options volume.  Inventories totaled 3.776 trillion cubic feet in the week
ended Oct. 12, 7.1 percent above the five-year average,
yesterday’s report showed. The  surplus  to the average is down
from 61 percent on March 30. Stockpiles may reach 3.903 trillion
cubic feet by Oct. 31, below estimated capacity of 4.239
trillion, Energy Department data show.  Power Plants  Gas demand from power plants rose 16 percent in July from a
year earlier and may show a 14 percent year-on-year gain this
quarter, according to an Oct. 10 Energy Department report.  Commodity Weather Group LLC in Bethesda,  Maryland ,
predicted mostly cooler-than-normal weather in the eastern half
of the U.S. from Oct. 29 through Nov. 2.  The low in New York on Oct. 31 may be 35 degrees Fahrenheit
(2 Celsius), 11 below normal, according to  AccuWeather Inc.  in
State College,  Pennsylvania . The low in  Cleveland  may be 31
degrees, 13 less than the usual reading.  About 50 percent of U.S. households use gas for heating,
according to the Energy Department.  The coming U.S. winter will probably be cooler than a year
earlier, boosting demand for heating fuels such as natural gas,
a panel of forecasters said.  While December will be warmer than normal, temperatures
will drop through February, increasing natural gas use by 13
percent over the same period from last year, Commodity Weather
Group LLC President Matt Rogers said during a panel discussion
at Earth Networks Inc.’s seventh annual energy weather seminar
in New York yesterday.  Cold Winter  The U.S. winter, measured by meteorologists from Dec. 1 to
Feb. 28, may be 21 percent cooler than last year in terms of
natural gas-weighted heating degree days, Rogers said.  A boom in oil and natural gas production helped the U.S.
cut its reliance on imported fuel. America met 83 percent of its
energy needs in the first six months of the year, department
data show. If the trend goes on through 2012, it will be the
highest level of self-sufficiency since 1991.  The number of rigs drilling for natural gas in the U.S.
rose by 5 to 427 this week, rebounding from the lowest level
since June 1999, according to data released today by Baker
Hughes Inc. in Houston. The rig count has dropped 47 percent
this year.  Gas futures volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was
311,905 as of 3:07 p.m., compared with the three-month average
of 396,000. Volume was 487,122 yesterday. Open interest was 1.21
million contracts. The three-month average is 1.12 million.  The exchange has a one-business-day delay in reporting full
volume and open interest data.  To contact the reporters on this story:
