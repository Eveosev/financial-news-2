NML Capital Ltd. is demanding that
 Argentina  pay $20 million for the release of a naval ship
detained at its request in a port in Ghana, newspaper  La Nacion 
reported.  The amount represents less than 5 percent of the claim that
NML is demanding Argentina for its investments in the country’s
defaulted bonds, the Buenos Aires-based newspaper said, citing a
letter from NML’s lawyers.  The investment group also offered Argentina to pay for the
crew to return home, La Nacion said.  NML and other holders of bonds that weren’t swapped in two
restructurings of the $95 billion of debt on which Argentina
defaulted in late 2001, are seeking to recover the full value of
the securities. About 94 percent of the defaulted bonds were
restructured in 2005 and 2010, giving creditors about 30 cents
on the dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
