Trading volume in United Nation
Emission Reduction Units rose to a record on  London ’s ICE
Futures Europe exchange after the European Union proposed a ban
on the use of the offsets from April.  Almost 5.8 million metric tons of offsets had changed hands
on the bourse as of 2:45 p.m., more than double the previous
day’s volume, according to ICE Futures data.  Earlier, the EU proposed that ERUs from countries such as
Russia and Ukraine should not be eligible in the bloc’s cap-and-
trade system after April, raising the possibility that countries
would try to sell more offsets before the ban comes into effect.  To contact the reporter on this story:
