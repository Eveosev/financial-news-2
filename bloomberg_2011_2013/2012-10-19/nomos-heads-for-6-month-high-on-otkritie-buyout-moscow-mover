Nomos Bank headed for a six-month
high as Otkritie Financial Corp. was said to be moving nearer to
taking over the lender at a premium to the market price.  Nomos, part-owned by billionaire  Alexander Nesis , surged as
much as 3.8 percent before trading up 3.1 percent at 825.00
rubles by 2:56 p.m. in Moscow, the highest since April 3 on a
closing basis. The shares rose 3.1 percent to $13.40 in  London .
Turnover in Moscow amounted to 5,769 shares, or 30 percent of
the three-month daily average, while 43,035 shares, or 11
percent of the daily average, changed hands in London trading.  Otkritie plans to buy Nomos Bank for $14 per global
depositary receipt, three people with knowledge of the plan said,
asking not to be identified before a decision is announced.
Otkritie’s management is holding final meetings with minority
shareholders in Nomos and plans to complete the deal by the end
of the year, the three people said.  “This news is positive because it confirms the deal,”
 Mark Rubinstein , an analyst at IFC Metropol in Moscow, said by
phone. “There were concerns that the offer might be delayed.”  The yield on Nomos’s 2019 dollar bond fell three basis
points to 9.687 percent today, the lowest on record.  Otkritie, which is 20 percent owned by state-run VTB Group,
plans to increase its stake in closely-held Nomos to 100 percent
within two years from 19.9 percent in August, the Moscow-based
lenders said in a statement on Aug. 31.  After buying all of Nomos, Otkritie Financial’s top
management will get 25 percent of the investment group, while
affiliates of Nesis’s ICT Group, state-run VTB Group and
businessmen Boris Mints and  Alexander Mamut  will each get as
much as 10 percent stakes, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
