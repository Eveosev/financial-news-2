Kenya ’s shilling strengthened,
pushing the currency toward a weekly gain, as the central bank
removed money from the market through four-day repurchase
agreements for the first time in more than three months.  The currency of  East Africa ’s largest economy gained as
much as 0.4 percent to 84.85 a dollar, the most since Sept. 5
and was trading less than 0.1 percent higher to 85.15 a dollar
at 4:12 p.m., in the capital, Nairobi.  The Central Bank of Kenya sold 2.9 billion shillings ($34
million) of seven-day repurchase agreements, an official who
asked not to be identified in line with policy, said by phone.
The bank later sold 2.4 billion shillings of 4-day repurchase
agreements, the first such sale since June 6, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  “The shilling is being supported by the central bank, with
the second repurchase agreement propping it up, but with demand
expected to build up in the coming days, it will be under
pressure,” Julius Kiriinya, a dealer at Nairobi-based African
Banking Corp., said by phone.  Tanzania’s shilling weakened 0.4 percent to 1,581 a dollar,
while the Ugandan shilling gained less than 0.1 percent to 2,577
a dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
