The pound rose against the euro as
Britain posted its smallest September budget deficit since 2008.  The U.K. currency advanced 0.1 percent to 81.35 pence at
9:34 a.m. London time. It was little changed at $1.6045.  The shortfall excluding government support for banks was
12.8 billion pounds ($20.5 billion) compared with 13.5 billion
pounds a year earlier, the  Office for National Statistics  said
in London today. The median of 21 estimates in a Bloomberg News
survey was for a deficit of 13.5 billion pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
