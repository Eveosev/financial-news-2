Alex Smith  connected with Delanie Walker in the third quarter for the only touchdown of the game
as the San Francisco 49ers defeated the Seattle Seahawks 13-6 in
the National Football League.  The 49ers improved to 5-2 to hold the top spot in the
National Football Conference West, while Seattle is third in the
four-team division with a 4-3 mark.  “That was a sweet victory,” San Francisco coach  Jim Harbaugh  told his team in the locker room. “That’s the most
physical 30 minutes I’ve ever seen you play.”  Steven Hauschka kicked field goals of 52 and 35 yards for
the Seahawks, who had a 6-3 halftime advantage.  David Akers  had
a 38-yard field goal for the 49ers in the first quarter at
Candlestick Park in San Francisco.  Smith, who completed 14 of 23 passing attempts for 140
yards and one interception, found Walker with a 12-yard pass
with four minutes, 29 seconds left in the third quarter for the
49ers’ first touchdown in seven quarters. Akers sealed the
victory in the fourth with a 28-yard kick.  Seattle rookie quarterback Russell Wilson connected on nine
of 23 passing attempts for 122 yards and one interception.  Frank Gore  accounted for 131 of San Francisco’s 175 rushing
yards.  To contact the reporter on this story:
