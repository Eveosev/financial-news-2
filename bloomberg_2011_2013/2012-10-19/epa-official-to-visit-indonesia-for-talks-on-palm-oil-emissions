The U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency, which this year rejected palm-oil biodiesel from its
renewable-fuels program, is sending an official next week to
 Indonesia , the worldâ€™s largest producer of the oilseed.  Gina McCarthy, the assistant administrator for the Office
of Air and Radiation, will visit Indonesia for talks on
environmental standards for the palm-oil industry, Alisha
Johnson, an EPA press secretary, said today in an e-mail. In
January, the agency said greenhouse-gas emissions from palm-oil
diesel were too high and failed to meet requirements set for
renewable fuels in the U.S.  Indonesia is one of the largest emitters of  greenhouse
gases , mostly because of land-based carbon emissions including
deforestation on expanding palm-oil production, according to a
study published in the journal Nature Climate Change.  To contact the reporter on this story:
