Orbital Sciences Corp. (ORB)  fell the most
in more than four months after the maker of rockets and
satellites lowered its revenue forecast for the year and
reported delays in a program to resupply the International Space
Station.  Orbital, based in Dulles,  Virginia , slid 4 percent to close
at $13.58 in  New York  for the biggest decline since June 1. The
shares are down 6.5 percent this year.  “Investors are getting somewhat fatigued on this,”
Michael Ciarmoli, an analyst with Cleveland-based KeyBanc
Capital Markets Inc., said in a telephone interview. “We’ve
been waiting and waiting. I think if we get the rocket to fly in
December, that’ll give a lift to the stock.”  Orbital plans to launch its Antares rocket, designed to
carry cargo to the  space station , for the first time before the
end of the year. The company has a $1.9 billion contract with
the National Aeronautics and Space Administration for eight
resupply flights scheduled to start in the second half of 2013.  A separate test flight to the station has been pushed back
to the first or second quarter of 2013 from this year, Ciarmoli
said. He has a buy rating on the company.  Orbital yesterday lowered its 2012 revenue forecast to
$1.43 billion to $1.45 billion, from $1.43 billion to $1.48
billion, even as record sales helped third-quarter profit exceed
analyst estimates.  Net income rose to $19.5 million, or 33 cents a share, from
$16.5 million, or 28 cents, a year earlier. The average estimate
of seven analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was 25 cents a share.
Sales advanced 9 percent to $373 million from $342 million a
year earlier.  The results “set new records for revenues and operating
income for a second consecutive quarter,” Chief Executive
Officer David Thompson said in a statement. “This quarter’s
financial results reflected strong growth in revenues,
particularly for the launch vehicles segment.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
