Saraiva SA Livreiros Editores (SLED4)  fell
the most in more than three months as the Brazilian bookseller
said it had nothing to report after  Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN)  was said to
be in talks to buy the company.  Shares dropped 4 percent to 26.78 reais at the close of
trading in  Sao Paulo , the most since July 3. The benchmark
Bovespa index sank 1.4 percent.  The world’s largest online retailer is in talks to buy Sao
Paulo-based Saraiva, which publishes books and sells them on the
Internet and in brick-and-mortar stores, according to a person
with direct knowledge of the discussions who asked not to be
identified because they are private.  “The company is always willing to look at opportunities,”
Saraiva said in a regulatory filing in response to a request
from the stock exchange. “There is no deal of any type that
needs to be reported under the legislation.”  Saraiva slipped 0.4 percent yesterday, after a 7.3 percent
advance on Oct. 17. The stock has gained 40 percent since this
year’s low on July 25.  To contact the reporter on this story:
