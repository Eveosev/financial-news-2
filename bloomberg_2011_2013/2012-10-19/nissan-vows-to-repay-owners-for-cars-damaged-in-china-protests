Nissan Motor Co. (7201) , the biggest
Japanese carmaker in China by sales, will reimburse owners for
damages to vehicles during protests, including future
demonstrations, as the company works to lure customers back.  Compensation payments to owners of Nissan and Venucia-
branded vehicles applies to protests in September over an island
sovereignty dispute with  Japan , and to “all kinds of riots,”
from now, Sharon Shen, a Beijing-based spokeswoman for Nissan,
said by telephone today.  Consumers avoided buying vehicles made by  Toyota Motor
Corp. (7203)  and Nissan after rioters torched dealerships and smashed
cars in protests over disputed islands in September. That led
deliveries of Japanese vehicles to slump 41 percent last month,
the state-backed China Association of Automobile Manufacturers
said Oct. 10.  “We want to ease consumers’ concerns over using and
purchasing our cars,” Shen said.  Nissan will also fully cover the cost of medical treatment
for owners injured in attacks on their vehicles during the
September riots, she said.  The carmaker’s  China  sales have increased, Shen said,
declining to elaborate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
