Chile’s peso fell as copper dropped
amid speculation demand will slow in  China , the world’s biggest
buyer of the metal.  The peso dropped 0.4 percent to 474.75 per U.S. dollar at
the close in Santiago, extending its weekly decline to 0.5
percent. The currency has traded in an intra-day range of 467 to
476 per dollar for more than a month.  The price of copper plunged as much as 3 percent today
after a report showed foreign direct investment in China fell
and an adviser to China’s central bank said the government won’t
provide major economic stimulus after industrial output and
retail sales accelerated in September. Copper is Chile’s top
export.  International investors in the Chilean peso forwards market
had a $7.3 billion short peso position on Oct. 17, according to
central bank data published today. That is their smallest bet
against the peso since May.  “ Chile  has good levels of debt and savings, relatively
high interest rates and under-control inflation, so local
fundamentals still support peso appreciation,” said Alejandro Araya, a trader at Banco Santander Chile in Santiago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
