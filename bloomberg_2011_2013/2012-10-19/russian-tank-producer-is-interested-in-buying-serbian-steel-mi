NPO Uralvagonzavod OAO, a Russian
state-owned maker of battle tanks and railcars, is the only
company to have bought documents in a tender for  Serbia â€™s sole
steel plant  Zelezara Smederevo d.o.o. , the Belgrade-based
Privatization Agency said in an e-mailed statement today.  The Serbian government invited bids for Zelezara on Oct. 8,
seeking an investor for the unprofitable plant that it bought
back from  U.S. Steel Corp (X)  in January.  To contact the reporter on this story:
