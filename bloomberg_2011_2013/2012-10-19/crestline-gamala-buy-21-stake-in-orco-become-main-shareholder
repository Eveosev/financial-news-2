Crestline Ventures Corp. and Gamala
Ltd. said they acquired a 20.7 percent stake in  Orco Property
Group (ORC)  SA, becoming the developer’s largest shareholder.  Crestline and Gamala may consider acquiring additional
stake on the market depending on the price, the Cyprus-based
Gamala and the British Virgin Islands-registered Crestline said
in a BusinessWire statement today. The two companies will seek
representation on the board of directors, the statement said.  The purchase reflects the “confidence” in Orco’s growth
strategy and the new shareholders will work alongside the
current management team on Orco’s development plan and
investment projects, the statement said.  Czech billionaire Radovan Vitek, who owns Czech Property
Investments AS, a real estate company, is behind the purchases,
Hospodarske Noviny reported earlier today.  Vitek declined to comment when asked by  Bloomberg News 
today, according to a text message.  To contact the reporter on this story:
