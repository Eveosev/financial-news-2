The  National Hockey League  canceled
another week of games, through Nov. 1, as a lockout of players
continues.  The league said in a statement yesterday that a total of
135 regular-season games now have been lost to the shutdown,
which started when the old collective bargaining agreement
expired Sept. 15. The season was to have begun Oct. 11.  The league and the players’ union are at odds over how to
split revenue that reached a record $3 billion last season. The
league proposed a 50-50 split this week, and rejected union
counter-proposals. Commissioner Gary Bettman said the latest
talks were a “step backward.”  “It’s clear that we’re not speaking the same language in
terms of what they came back to us with,” Bettman said two days
ago.  The players received 57 percent of hockey-related revenue
under the previous contract, reached in 2005 after the league
lost an entire season to a lockout. Union Executive Director
Donald Fehr said players would stand to lose 12.3 percent of
their salaries under the latest NHL offer, which proposed a full
82-game season to start Nov. 2.  “It’s not hard to figure out why the owners think this is
a good deal,” Fehr told reporters two days ago.  The cancellation of the preseason and first two weeks of
the regular season caused a loss of about $250 million, Deputy
Commissioner Bill Daly has said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
