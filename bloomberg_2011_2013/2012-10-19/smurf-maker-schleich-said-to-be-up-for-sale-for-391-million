Schleich GmbH , the German maker of
Smurf figurines, is being put up for sale by London private-
equity firm HgCapital, according to two people familiar with the
matter.  HgCapital may raise up to 300 million euros ($391.6
million) from the sale, which may start as early as next month,
said the people, who asked not to be identified because the
talks are private. The firm has mandated  Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. (GS)  to find a bidder for the toymaker, they said.  Spokespeople for Schleich didnâ€™t immediately return calls
and an e-mail seeking comment on the sale. An offical at Goldman
declined to comment.  Schleich, which is based in Schwaebisch Gmuend, was founded
77 years ago by Friedrich Schleich and sells figurines in more
than 50 countries, according to its website. The company also
makes books, dinosaurs and farm animals. Schleich managing
directors Paul Kraut and Erich Schefold are also shareholders in
the company.  -- Editors: Celeste Perri, Robert Valpuesta  To contact the reporters on this story:
