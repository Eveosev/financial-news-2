Former National Football League
Commissioner Paul Tagliabue will hear appeals in the New Orleans
Saints bounty scandal, the league said in a statement.  Tagliabue, 71, commissioner from 1989-2006, will hold
hearings for Scott Fujita, Anthony Hargrove, Will Smith, and
Jonathan Vilma on Oct. 30. He was appointed by NFL Commissioner
 Roger Goodell .  Goodell’s original penalties were thrown out by an
arbitrator who ruled that he overstepped his bounds. The players
appealed his new penalties: Vilma’s full-season suspension was
unchanged, Hargrove’s was cut one game to seven, Smith’s in half
to four games, and Fujita by three to one game.  The NFL said about two dozen Saints players, led by former
defensive coordinator  Gregg Williams , paid each other as much as
$1,500 for targeting opponents such as Super Bowl-winning
quarterbacks Kurt Warner and Brett Favre from 2009 to 2011.  Coach Sean Payton was barred for a year and Williams was
suspended indefinitely. Mickey Loomis, the Saints’ general
manager, received an eight-game suspension. Those penalties were
allowed to stand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
