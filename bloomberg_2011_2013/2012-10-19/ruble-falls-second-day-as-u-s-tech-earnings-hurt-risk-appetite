The ruble fell for a second day,
following a decline in the euro, after Spanish Prime Minister
 Mariano Rajoy  said his nation doesn’t feel pressure to ask for a
bailout, fueling concern the debt crisis will worsen.  The ruble depreciated 0.3 percent against the dollar to
30.8550 by 7 p.m. in Moscow, paring its gain this week to 0.7
percent. The Russian currency rose 0.2 percent versus the euro
to 40.2325. It was little changed against the central bank’s
euro-dollar target basket.  The euro fell 0.3 percent in London after dropping 0.4
percent yesterday. Rajoy said at the European Union summit in
Brussels today that the Spanish government would take a decision
on asking for any bailout based on Spain’s interest.  “What you see as weakness in dollar-ruble mainly reflects
softer euro,”  Benoit Anne , the head of emerging-market strategy
at Societe Generale SA in London, said by e-mail. The main
reason is “negative headlines on Spain, with more reluctance to
ask for a bailout on fast-track basis,” Anne said.  Crude for November delivery dropped 0.5 percent to $91.62 a
barrel in  New York Mercantile Exchange , falling for a second
day. Russia is the world’s biggest energy exporter. Oil and gas
contribute about 50 percent of government revenue.  Non-deliverable forwards showed the ruble at 31.3415 per
dollar in three months compared with 31.2785 yesterday.  The extra yield investors demand to own Russia’s dollar
bonds over  U.S. Treasuries  rose three basis points 171,
according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s EMBI Global Index. An index
of five-year government bond yields fell 10 basis points to
6.982 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
