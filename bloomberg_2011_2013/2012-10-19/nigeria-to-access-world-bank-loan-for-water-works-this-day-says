Nigeria  plans to access a $400
million World Bank loan for water and sewer works, including
infrastructure upgrades, This Day reported, citing a water and
sanitation specialist at the lending institution.  Alexander Danilenko was cited by This Day as saying at a
seminar organized by the water resources ministry and bank in
Abuja that the $400 million loan would help boost “water
coverage” for utilities and water boards impacted by Nigeria’s
urbanization. Poor management and neglect has affected the water
infrastructure and distribution networks, This Day said, citing
the permanent secretary of the ministry Godknows Igali.  To contact the reporter on this story:
