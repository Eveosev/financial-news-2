Brazil  sees slim chances of finding
a buyer for Banco BVA SA, the Rio de Janeiro-based lender that
the central bank took control of today, a government official
said.  Banco BVA, which had insufficient provisions for its credit
portfolio, faced serious liquidity problems and had an inviable
business model, the official said, requesting not to be named
because he was not authorized to speak publicly.  The current owners are unlikely to come up with the
necessary capital to put the bank on its feet again, the
official said.  The central bank declined to comment beyond what it said in
its  statement  announcing the takeover earlier today. BVA
declined to comment, according to a spokesman who asked not to
be named in accordance with bank policies.
