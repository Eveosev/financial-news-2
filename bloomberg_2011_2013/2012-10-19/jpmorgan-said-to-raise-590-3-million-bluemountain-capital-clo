JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  raised a $617.3
million collateralized loan obligation for BlueMountain Capital
Management LLC, according to two people with knowledge of the
deal.  The fund includes a $372.2 million slice rated AAA that has
a coupon of 142 basis points more than the London interbank
offered rate, said the people, who asked not to be identified
because the terms are private. The fund also includes a $10
million AAA slice that has a fixed rate, the people said.  CLOs are a type of collateralized debt obligation that pool
high-yield, high-risk loans and slice them into securities of
varying risk and return.  JPMorgan raised a $409.8 million fund for BlueMountain in
May, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
