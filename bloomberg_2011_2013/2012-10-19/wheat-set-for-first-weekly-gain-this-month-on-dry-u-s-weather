Wheat futures climbed for a third
day on signs that Ukraine will limit exports, and on speculation
that dry weather in the southern U.S. Great Plains will curb
production. Corn advanced, while soybeans fell.  Ukraine’s wheat exports will reach 5 million metric tons by
Nov. 15, Volodymyr Klymenko, the head of the country’s Grain
Association, said today. That may prompt the government to
introduce shipment limits, he said. Parts of  Kansas , the biggest
U.S. producer of winter varieties, have received little rain in
the past month, National Weather Service data show.  “We have a key competitor in Ukraine announcing it may end
wheat-export sales,”  Rich Nelson , a chief strategist at
Allendale Inc. in McHenry,  Illinois , said by telephone.
“Combine that with the dryness in the U.S. Plains, and that’s
causing some concern. Spring rains are what determine the crop,
but if a crop looks bad going into winter dormancy, that’s cause
for concern.”  Wheat futures for December delivery rose 0.5 percent to
settle at $8.725 a bushel at 2 p.m. on the Chicago Board of
Trade. The price has gained 34 percent this year and rose 1.8
percent this week.  Corn futures for December delivery climbed 0.1 percent to
$7.615 a bushel in Chicago, ending the week up 1.1 percent.
Soybean futures for November slid 0.7 percent to $15.3425 a
bushel on the CBOT, paring this week’s gain to 0.8 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
