Finance Minister Maria Fekter of
 Austria , whose lenders have criticized regulations in  Hungary ,
said new plans for taxing bank transactions there are
“exciting” and should be watched closely.  Hungarian Economy Minister  Gyorgy Matolcsy  “told me that
Hungary is seeking a truly new way on taxes,” Fekter said at a
conference in Vienna today. “The idea is exciting to tax the
citizens’ income with only a 10, 15 percent rate, but tax bank
transactions” to make up for lost revenue, she said. “We’ll
have to watch closely how this will work out.”  Hungary this week backtracked on a vow to cut in half a
2010 bank levy and raised a planned transaction tax to 0.2
percent from 0.1 percent. The European Union’s most-indebted
eastern member, seeking to plug budget holes caused by a flat 16
percent income tax, risks losing development funds unless it
keeps the shortfall below the EU limit of 3 percent of output.  Austria’s  Erste Group Bank AG (EBS) ,  Raiffeisen Bank
International AG (RBI)  and UniCredit Bank Austria AG are among the
biggest lenders in Hungary. Raiffeisen Chief Executive Officer
Herbert Stepic said yesterday that Hungary was his bank’s
biggest “problem case” because of the high tax burden.  Fekter, who met with Matolcsy in Vienna yesterday,
cautioned today against “bashing” Hungary.  Hungary announced the tax measures after the EU said the
nation’s deficit may reach 3.9 percent of economic output,
compared with the government’s 2.7 percent forecast.  To contact the reporter on this story:
