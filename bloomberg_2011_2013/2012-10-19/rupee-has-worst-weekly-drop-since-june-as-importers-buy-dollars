India ’s rupee completed its biggest
weekly drop since June on speculation importers stepped up
dollar purchases to meet payments.  The currency touched the lowest level in almost a month
today amid concern faster  inflation  will reduce room for the
central bank to lower borrowing costs to counter an economic
slowdown. The pace of price increases quickened to 7.81 percent
last month, the most this year, after the government raised the
prices of subsidized fuels to rein in the  budget deficit .  The rupee dropped “on the back of huge dollar demand from
oil importers and defense firms,” analysts at Edelweiss
Financial Advisors Ltd., including Mumbai-based Vinay Khattar,
wrote in a research report today. “The  Reserve Bank  of India at
its Oct. 30 meet is unlikely to slash the key rate as wholesale-
price based inflation continues to remain at elevated levels,
which is a major concern for the central bank.”  The rupee declined 1.9 percent this week to 53.8400 per
dollar in Mumbai, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It
touched 54.0050 today, the lowest level since Sept. 21.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate
swings used to price options, rose 105 basis points, or 1.05
percentage point, to 11.35 percent. The rate has risen five
basis points this week.  The RBI has kept the benchmark  repurchase rate  at 8 percent
since a 50 basis point reduction in April.  Three-month onshore rupee forwards were at 54.73 per
dollar, compared with 53.97 yesterday, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Offshore non-deliverable contracts were
at 54.69 versus 53.86. Forwards are agreements to buy or sell
assets at a set price and date. Non-deliverable contracts are
settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
