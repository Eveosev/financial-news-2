Crude oil options volatility rose as
underlying futures broke out of the range they had been trading
in all week and slid 2.2 percent.  Implied volatility for options expiring in December, a
measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge of
options prices, was 29.24 percent at 3:20 p.m. in  New York ,
after being at 27.99 percent the prior two days.  December-delivery crude oil fell $2.05 to settle at $90.05
a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . The largest move
in the previous five days was 24 cents.  “We’re up a little bit especially since we sold off,”
week,’’ said Fred Rigolini, vice president of Paramount Options
Inc. in New York. “We’re breaking out of the range, after being
between $91 and $93 all week.”  The most active options in electronic trading today were
December $85 puts, which rose 41 cents to $1.02 a barrel at 3:26
p.m. with 3,182 lots trading. December $90 puts were the second-
most active, with 2,892 lots exchanged as they advanced 80 cents
to $2.55 a barrel.  “We saw December $70, $75 and $78 puts trading out and
December $75 and $78 trading as a put spread,” Rigolini said.  Puts accounted for 53 percent of the 50,694 contracts in
electronic trading. One contract covers 1,000 barrels of oil.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on open-
outcry volume, where the bulk of options activity occurs.  In the previous session, puts made up 58 percent of the
124,736 contracts traded.  December $80 puts were the most actively traded options
yesterday with 8,023 lots. They fell 7 cents to 18 cents a
barrel. December $75 puts declined 3 cents to 5 cents on volume
of 7,550 lots.  Open interest was highest for December $120 calls with
67,857 contracts. Next were December $80 puts with 52,461 lots
and December $125 calls with 45,711.  To contact the reporter on this story:
