The trouble started when Herbert
Barnum Seeley invited a couple of dozen upper-crust pals to a
stag party at Sherry’s,  New York ’s snootiest restaurant. He also
hired Little Egypt to perform a nude couchee-couchee dance.  (To listen to the podcast, click  here .)  On an informant’s tip, a police captain raided the place.
Denying any wrongdoing, the guests ejected him, and when the
newspapers caught wind of the scandal, they attacked the city’s
constabulary for ruining a harmless private party by entering
without a warrant.  After Little Egypt gave an interview saying she loved to
dance nude, public opinion turned, and the wealthy men were
tarred as deviants defiling the elegant Sherry’s.  The police captain was tried and acquitted.  Theater impresario Oscar Hammerstein hired Little Egypt to
play herself in “Silly’s Dinner,” a new show starring a comic
police captain, a drunken guest and the seductive dancer.  I spoke with Richard Zacks, author of “Island of Vice:
Theodore Roosevelt’s Quest to Clean Up Sin-Loving New York,” on
the following topics:  1. Prostitutes Abound  2. Police Corruption  3. Tenderloin  4. Reformer Roosevelt  5. Naked Little Egypt  To buy this book in  North America , click  here .  ( Lewis Lapham  is the founder of  Lapham’s Quarterly  and the
