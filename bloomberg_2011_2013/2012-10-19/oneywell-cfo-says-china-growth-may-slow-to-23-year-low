Honeywell International Inc. (HON) , the
U.S. manufacturer selling products such as aerospace parts in
 China , is forecasting 2013 economic growth in the world’s most-
populous country may decelerate to the  slowest pace  since 1990.  “It wouldn’t be surprising to us if China didn’t break 7
percent GDP growth in 2013,” Honeywell Chief Financial Officer
Dave Anderson said in a telephone interview. “Our expectation
is that there’s going to be relatively muted growth overall.”  Honeywell’s projections for China, as well as the U.S. and
the euro area, are less optimistic than those of economists
surveyed by Bloomberg. The Morris Township, New Jersey-based
company plans to cut costs and introduce new products to keep
earnings growth in 2013 at a similar level as this year.  The euro area will remain in recession next year,
contracting 0.2 percent to 0.3 percent, and the U.S. growth will
likely be 1.8 percent, Anderson said. Economists on average
predict growth of 0.3 percent in  Europe , 2 percent in the U.S.
and 8 percent in China. The Chinese economy  last increased  less
than 7 percent in 1990, when it expanded 3.8 percent.  “We’re not counting on positive macroeconomic conditions
supporting our growth in 2013,” Anderson said.  Honeywell, which makes products ranging from thermostats to
turbochargers, has reduced expenses across regions in sales,
distribution and production, Anderson said.  The manufacturer also benefited from higher demand for
aerospace parts and energy processing technology, fueling an
estimated  11 percent  gain in earnings per share this year, based
on $4.50, the high end of Honeywell’s  forecast range .  Honeywell may achieve similar earnings growth next year if
foreign exchange, which will shave about $700 million off
revenue in 2012, is more neutral next year, Anderson said.  Cost savings measures will add about $150 million to
operating profit in 2013, Anderson said. Sales growth from
existing businesses may be lower than the estimated 3 percent
for this year, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
