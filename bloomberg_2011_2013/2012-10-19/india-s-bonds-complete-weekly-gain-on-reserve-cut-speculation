India ’s 10-year bonds completed
their first weekly gain this month on speculation the central
bank will cut cash-reserve requirements to revive the economy.  Policy makers will reduce the  proportion  of deposits that
lenders must set aside by 25 basis points to 4.25 percent on
Oct. 30, according to 10 of 17 economists surveyed by Bloomberg
News. One predicted a 50 basis point cut while the rest see no
change. Quarterly growth in India’s $1.8 trillion  economy  slowed
to an average 5.4 percent in the first half, from 7.5 percent in
the whole of 2011, according to government data.  “A cut in the CRR to infuse more liquidity in the system
can’t be ruled out as growth is slowing,” said Vivek Rajpal, a
fixed-income strategist in Mumbai at Nomura Holdings Inc.
“Investors should stay long on government bonds.”  The yield on the benchmark 8.15 percent notes due June 2022
fell four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, this week to
8.13 percent in Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading
system. The rate, which fell one basis point today, is the
lowest since July 27.  The yield may decline to 7.80 percent by the end of
January, Rajpal predicted.  The one-year interest-rate swap, derivative contracts used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, fell three basis
points to 7.60 percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
