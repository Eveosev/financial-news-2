Gulf Coast sour crude grades
weakened against the U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate as
WTI’s discount to  Brent crude  reached a two-week low.  The discount eased 19 cents to $19.70 a barrel based on
December settlement prices, down from $23.95 on Oct. 15. It was
the fourth straight day that WTI strengthened against Brent.  Southern Green Canyon crude’s premium to WTI narrowed $1.50
to $11.50 a barrel at 4:19 p.m., according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The premium for  Thunder Horse  fell $1 to $17.50 a
barrel. The medium-grade crudes compete with seaborne imports.  “It has to do with the narrowing of the WTI-Brent
spreads,” said  Andy Lipow , president of Lipow Oil Associates
LLC in Houston. “When that narrows, you see that the grades in
the Gulf lose some of their premium.”  Canadian crudes were mixed after declining yesterday as
 TransCanada Corp. (TRP)  shut the 590,000-barrel-a-day Keystone oil
pipeline for repairs. TransCanada said today that bad weather is
making it harder to get equipment to the repair site at a
section of the pipeline connecting Missouri and  Illinois . The
line is expected to be working by tomorrow, James Millar, a
company spokesman, said in an e-mail.  The premium of Syncrude, a synthetic light blend, to WTI
fell 25 cents to 75 cents a barrel, after dropping $2.35
yesterday. The discount of Western Canada Select, a heavy crude
grade, narrowed 50 cents to $20 after widening $5 yesterday.  The Canadian crudes “could still fall off more, especially
if Keystone is down more than three days,” Lipow said.  WTI Midland’s discount widened 70 cents to $3.10 a barrel.
Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium increased 40 cents to $19.40.
Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium widened 20 cents to $20.  To contact the reporter on this story:
