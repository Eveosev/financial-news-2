United Water, a U.S. unit of Paris-
based water and wastewater treatment provider Suez
Environnement, completed a $52 million upgrade of a water
pollution control plant and pump station in Rhode Island.  Improvements to the East Providence facility include odor
control systems to help treat harmful gases and a collection
system with larger capacity to eliminate sewage overflows in the
Providence River and Narragansett Bay, the utility said.  The enhancements were necessary to bring the collection
system and plant, built in 1954, into compliance with new state
Department of Environmental Management mandates, the utility
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
