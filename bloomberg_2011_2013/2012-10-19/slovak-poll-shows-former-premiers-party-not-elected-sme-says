The party of former Slovak prime
ministers Mikulas Dzurinda and Iveta Radicova may not meet the 5
percent limit required to win seats in parliament,  Sme  reported,
citing results of a poll conducted by MVK.  SDKU, which held the premiership for 10 in the past 14
years, would muster 4.8 percent of votes compared with 6.1
percent gained in the elections seven months ago, the newspaper
said without specifying the poll’s sample size and margin of
error. Smer, headed by the current premier  Robert Fico , would
win the vote with 40 percent, Sme said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
