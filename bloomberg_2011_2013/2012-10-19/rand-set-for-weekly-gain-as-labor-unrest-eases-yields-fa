The rand appreciated for a second
week as striking employees at Gold Fields Ltd., South Africa’s
second-largest producer of the metal, returned to work and other
gold mining companies improved a pay offer to workers.  The currency traded 0.3 percent stronger at 8.6290 per
dollar by 4 p.m. in Johannesburg, taking its advance this week
to 1.2 percent, the most since the week through Sept. 7. Yields
on 6.75 percent bonds due 2021 dropped two basis points to 6.62
percent.  Unauthorized stoppages led to a drop of about 40 percent in
the country’s gold output this month, weakening the continent’s
largest economy. Gold producers in South Africa, holder of
almost a third of the world’s reserves, improved a wage offer to
employees today as more than 60,000 workers involved in strikes
across the mining industry reported for duty, including those at
Gold Fields Ltd.’s KDC West and Beatrix shafts.  “It’s definitely supporting the rand a bit; I don’t think
there’s anything else on people’s minds at the moment,” Bidvest
Bank’s chief dealer Ion de Vleeschauwer says by phone. “The
fact that there is some resolution is evident in the rate.”  Foreign investors were net buyers of 3 billion rand ($347
million) in the first four days of this week, following 1.5
billion rand of outflows the previous week, according to JSE
Ltd.  data .  To contact the reporter on this story:
