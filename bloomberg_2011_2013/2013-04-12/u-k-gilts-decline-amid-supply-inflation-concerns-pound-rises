U.K. gilts declined for the first
week in five as the nation began its funding program for the
fiscal year starting this month and amid concern inflation may
accelerate, reducing the value of fixed payments from bonds.  The yield on benchmark 10-year  securities  rose from the
lowest in seven months as a sale of the bonds attracted the
least demand since June. The 10-year break-even rate, an index
of annual inflation expectations, climbed to the highest level
in more than 4 1/2 years after the nation sold index-linked debt
at an auction. The pound strengthened for a second week against
the dollar as a report showed U.K. industrial production
increased more than economists forecast in February.  “Gilts had a pretty good run and there was a very low
yield level,” said Elisabeth Afseth, a fixed-income analyst at
Investec Bank Plc in London. “The data this week was OK, and
10-year yields below 2 percent, with inflation likely to push up
to 3 percent in coming months, does make gilts’ upside limited
in terms of price.”  The 10-year yield rose 10 basis points, or 0.1 percentage
point, to 1.73 percent as of 5 p.m. London time yesterday, the
first increase since the five days through March 8. It fell to
1.625 percent on April 8, matching the April 5 low, which was
the least since Sept. 5. The 1.75 percent bond due September
2022 dropped 0.83, or 8.3 pounds per 1,000-pound ($1,537) face
amount, to 100.20.  The Debt Management Office sold 3.5 billion pounds of 10-
year gilts on April 9 as it began its 151 billion-pound issuance
program for the 12 months through March 2014. Investors  bid  for
1.68 times the amount of securities allotted, down from a so-
called bid-to-cover of 2.25 in February. The U.K. also sold 1.6
billion pounds of inflation-linked bonds on April 11.  Break-Even Rate  The  10-year break-even rate , derived from the difference in
yield between gilts and index-linked securities, climbed four
basis points to 3.29 percentage points this week after touching
3.39 on April 11, the most since September 2008.  U.K.  industrial output  rose 1 percent in February, after
dropping 1.3 percent the previous month, the Office for National
Statistics said April 9, beating economists’ forecasts of an
increase of 0.4 percent.  The pound rose 0.2 percent in the week to $1.5366. It
climbed to $1.5412 on April 11, the most since Feb. 20. Sterling
depreciated 0.6 percent to 85.19 pence per euro.  The pound has declined 4.4 percent this year, according to
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes, which track 10
developed-nation currencies. The dollar climbed 1.8 percent and
the euro gained 0.9 percent.  Debt Sales  The DMO is scheduled to sell 2.25 billion pounds of gilts
due in 2044 on April 18, while a report on April 16 is forecast
by economists to show the annual  inflation  rate held at 2.8
percent in March, above the Bank of England’s 2 percent target.  The debt office said on its website yesterday it will
auction index-linked gilts due in 2062 in a so-called mini-
tender operation on April 30. Further details will be announced
on April 19, it said.  Gilts returned 1 percent this year through April 11,
according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. German bunds gained
0.5 percent and Treasuries rose 0.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
