The Netherlands’  flower  and plant
exports, the world’s biggest, dropped 10 percent in March after
shipments of potted plants slumped to most European destinations
on freezing weather.  Shipments were 569.4 million euros ($745.5 million) last
month from 634.3 million euros in March 2012, the Aalsmeer,
Netherlands-based Dutch Agricultural Wholesale Board for Flowers
and Plants wrote in an online  report  today.  Temperatures in Germany, Europe’s biggest economy, were an
average 0.1 degree Celsius (32.2. degrees Fahrenheit) in March,
4.2 degrees below normal, according to the country’s weather
office. March is one of the most important months for flower and
plant exports due to Women’s Day, the U.K.’s Mother’s Day and
Easter, according to the product board.  “March, with its relatively large dependence on weather
conditions for flower and plant sales, is a special month and on
top of that an important one,” the board said. “Due to the
cold weather demand for potted- and garden plants faltered.”  Shipments to Germany, the biggest client for Dutch flowers
and plants, dropped 15 percent to 187.9 million euros, while
those to the U.K. fell 4.3 percent to 102.1 million euros in
March. Exports to France fell 5 percent to 54.5 million euros.  First-quarter exports of flowers and plants dropped 2.2
percent to 1.51 billion euros, according to the report. The
Netherlands’ exports of flowers and plants rose to 5.39 billion
euros last year from 5.24 billion euros in 2011.  Exporters continue to expect a stabilization or “very
limited growth” of Dutch flower and plant shipments in 2013
despite the first-quarter decline, the product board said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
