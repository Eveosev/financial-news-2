Chile ’s second-largest mobile
operator,  Empresa Nacional de Telecomunicaciones SA , was set for
its biggest 10-day drop in four years on concern it had agreed
to pay too much for NII Holdings Inc.’s Peruvian unit.  Shares fell 0.2 percent to 9,062.10 pesos at 2:01 p.m. in
Santiago and have dropped 9.2 percent over the past 10 days, the
steepest decline in such a period since March 2009, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  The stock began tumbling on April 1 after local newspapers
reported without saying where they got the information that the
company planned to buy assets in Peru. Shares have dropped 7.5
percent since Entel announced after the close of trading on
April 4 that it had agreed to buy Nextel  Peru  from NII Holdings
for $400 million.  “The market is punishing the stock as it may consider the
price excessive for a money-losing operation,” Rodolfo Tapia,
an analyst at Banco Penta, said in a telephone interview.  Nextel Peru posted a loss before interest, tax,
depreciation and amortization of $36 million in 2012 on revenue
of $343 million, according to an April 4 report from JPMorgan
Chase & Co. Entel said in a filing with Chile’s securities
regulator that it plans to reduce its dividend to 50 percent of
profit to fund the acquisition. The payout was previously 80
percent, according to Banco Santander SA.  Entel plans to invest $350 million to $400 million in the
first two years after the acquisition to upgrade the Nextel
network in Peru, Felipe Ureta, Entel’s chief financial officer,
said on a conference call April 8.  To contact the reporter on this story:
