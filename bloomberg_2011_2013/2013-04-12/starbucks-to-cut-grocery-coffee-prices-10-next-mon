Starbucks Corp. (SBUX) , the world’s
largest coffee-shop operator, will lower prices for its
Starbucks and  Seattle ’s Best brand packaged coffees sold in U.S.
supermarket and retail stores next month.  Prices will decrease 10 percent to $8.99 from $9.99 for a
12-ounce bag of Starbucks coffee beginning May 10,  Jim Olson , a
spokesman for the Seattle-based company, said in an interview.
Seattle’s Best prices will drop 13 percent to $6.99 from $7.99,
he said.  “This will allow us to both enhance the value that we’re
providing our existing packaged coffee customers, and hopefully
increase the frequency which they purchase Starbucks and
Seattle’s Best coffee, as well as attract new customers,” Olson
said. Starbucks Via instant coffee, K-Cups and Verismo pods
aren’t affected by the price cuts, he said.  Starbucks, which also sells Tazo Tea and cold-bottled
drinks in supermarkets, has sought to expand its line of
products sold at grocers to help boost sales. Revenue for the
company’s so-called channel development unit, which includes
items sold through warehouse clubs and  convenience stores ,
jumped 50 percent to $1.29 billion in the year ended Sept. 30.  Starbucks rose 0.9 percent to $59.09 at the close in  New
York . The  shares  have gained 10 percent this year, while the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index has climbed 11 percent.  The latte seller in March 2011 increased prices by 12
percent for its Starbucks-brand coffee and about 15 percent for
Seattle’s Best coffee sold in grocery and retail stores, Olson
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
