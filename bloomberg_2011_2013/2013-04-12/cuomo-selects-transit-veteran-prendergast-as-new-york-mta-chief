Thomas F. Prendergast, a 38-year
transit veteran who oversees New York’s subways, will take over
as chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority,
Governor Andrew Cuomo said.  Prendergast, 60, who began a career in transit in his
native Chicago in 1975, has presided over the city’s network of
subways and buses for the past three years. He’s been serving as
interim MTA executive director since January, when Chairman
Joseph Lhota stepped down to a pursue a run for New York mayor.  “From the track bed to the budget, to modernizing our
system for the 21st century, I can’t imagine anyone having a
better understanding of how the region’s vast system operates
and the challenges that it faces,” Cuomo said today in a
statement.  Prendergast helped revive the subway system after it was
flooded last year during  Hurricane Sandy , for which the agency
was widely praised. He’ll be the seventh leader of the MTA in
the past seven years. New York’s Senate must confirm the
nomination.  The MTA, the biggest U.S. transit agency, employs 66,000
workers, has a $13 billion budget and carries 8.5 million riders
a day on subways, buses and commuter railroads.  To contact the reporter on this story:
