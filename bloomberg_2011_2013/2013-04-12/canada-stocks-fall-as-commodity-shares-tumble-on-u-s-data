energy and raw-material shares dropped as commodity prices
plunged amid an unexpected slump in U.S. retail sales.  The Standard & Poor’s/GSCI Index of commodities tumbled 1.3
percent to the lowest level since July.  Barrick Gold Corp. (ABX)  and

main culprit,” said John Kinsey, fund manager with Caldwell
Securities Ltd. in Toronto. His firm manages about C$1 billion
($987 million). “Gold is taking a thrashing and energy stocks
are a problem as well. Financials are also reacting to the U.S.
numbers. It’s not quite as bad as it used to be, when the U.S.
sneezed and we’d catch a cold, but the U.S. is our largest
trading partner.”  Retail Sales  U.S.  retail sales  fell 0.4 percent in March, the most in
nine months, Commerce Department figures showed. The median
forecast of 85 economists surveyed by Bloomberg called for an

September 2011.  Gold for June delivery tumbled 4.1 percent to settle at
