Bulgarian inflation slowed in March
as spending on electricity and heating fell because of mild
weather and consumption shrank on high unemployment.  The inflation rate fell to 2.7 percent from a year earlier,
compared with 3.6 percent in February, the National Statistics
Institute in Sofia said in a statement today. The median
estimate of four economists surveyed by Bloomberg was 3.4
percent. Consumer prices dropped 0.5 percent on the month.  Bulgaria, the European Union’s poorest country in terms of
economic output per capita, withstood the global recession
without an international bailout. The interim government cut
this year’s economic growth forecast to 1 percent from 1.2
percent and forecast average inflation to slow to 1.8 percent
this year from 2.4 percent in 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
