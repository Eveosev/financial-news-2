Intermittent blackouts strike Cairo
several hours a day, with no warning for 11 million residents.
That’s exactly where FirmGreen Inc. of  Newport Beach ,
 California , wants to invest.  “For a company like ours, it’s actually a good fit,” Dena
Elbayoumy, general counsel for the company, which develops
renewable-energy projects, said by telephone from Egypt’s
capital. “We hope to improve stability in the country.”  FirmGreen is among nine businesses including  Google Inc. (GOOG) ,
 Raytheon Co. (RTN)  and  MEMC Electronic Materials Inc. (WFR)  that will
participate tomorrow in the U.S. government’s second trade
mission to Egypt since September. The delegation is heavy on
providers of basic services such as energy and water. The U.S.
is seeking to boost exports to the Arab nation after a 20
percent decline since shortly before the ouster of former leader
 Hosni Mubarak  in February 2011.  “There’s an actual attempt by the U.S. government to
encourage American businesses to invest in Egypt,” said Bessma
Momani, a Middle East expert and a nonresident senior fellow for
the  Brookings Institution , a nonprofit research organization in
Washington. “They’re really taking companies there on a ‘Team
USA’ kind of approach,” to allay investment-climate concerns,
she said by telephone.  Economic Turbulence  Political and economic turbulence have beset Egypt, the
most-populous Arab nation with 87 million people, since Mubarak
stepped down during the populist revolution known as the Arab
Spring. Foreign  reserves  are more than 60 percent below their
December 2010 levels and the value of Egypt’s currency has
plummeted against the  U.S. dollar .  The government of President Mohamed Mursi is seeking a $4.8
billion loan from the  International Monetary Fund  as fuel
shortages and an aging power network hobble development.  “I’m optimistic, even with the political uncertainty right
now, there will be a fair amount of need for infrastructure
investment,” John Robak, chief operating officer of Greeley &
Hansen LLC, a Chicago-based firm that consults on engineering
for water and wastewater projects, said by telephone.  Robak and others participating in the April 13-15 trade
mission will meet with senior Egyptian government officials,
potential business partners and clients, Mary Trupo, a Commerce
Department spokeswoman, said by e-mail. The trip is being led by
Kenneth Hyatt, the agency’s acting deputy under secretary for
international trade. He wasn’t available for comment.  Solar Power  “Egypt is about to experience a significant shortage of
energy,” Christos Mimikopoulos, general manager for the  Middle
East  and North Africa at MEMC’s SunEdison unit, which builds
solar farms, said today in an interview. With plenty of sun and
open desert space, Egypt is well suited for solar power, and his
goal is to assess whether the country is stable enough to invest
in renewable projects. MEMC is based in St. Peters,  Missouri .  “That’s actually one of the reasons that I am attending
the mission, to try to understand a little bit better what
exactly the situation is and what that means to solar energy,”
he said. “I think solar is a good fit in the long run for this
market. I’m not convinced at the moment that there are utility
scale projects that are ready for prime time.”  Trade Relationship  “This trade mission reiterates the United States’
commitment to deepening our long trade relationship with Egypt
and to growing the already strong connections between our
respective business communities,” Hyatt said in a statement
released when the trade mission was announced April 8.  Last year, U.S. exports to Egypt were valued at $5.5
billion -- less than 0.5 percent of America’s 2012 exports of
$1.5 trillion. Egypt, a longstanding ally, is a strategic
partner for the U.S. in the Middle East, however. It controls
the  Suez Canal , a vital shipping route for oil and other goods.  Since the turmoil wrought by the Arab Spring, American
exporters have faced challenges doing business in the country
and Egyptian consumers aren’t buying as many U.S. luxury goods
because of the economic malaise, Brookings’ Momani said.  “It’s a bureaucratic mess,” she said. Logistics have been
complicated since the populist revolt because the rule of law is
less firm, customs officials seek higher bribes and the
purchasing power of the Egyptian pound has fallen significantly
over the past two years, she said.  Opportunity Beckons  Companies that provide basic services -- such as sewage,
water and electricity -- say the environment is ripe with
opportunities.  “Their population is booming, their economy is starting to
grow,” Steve Wilburn, FirmGreen’s chief executive officer, said
by telephone. The company is in talks with a government-owned
utility to feed power from solar and natural gas-fired sources
to the electric grid, a $500 million project, he said.  Other participants on the trade mission are Mabey Inc. of
Elkridge,  Maryland ; Rapiscan Systems of Torrance, California;
Pioneer Solar of  Irvine , California, and Vanguard Defense
Industries LLC of Conroe,  Texas .  To contact the reporters on this story:
