The Czech Finance Ministry expects
to undershoot its fiscal deficit target in 2013 even as it sees
risks of the economy shrinking for a second consecutive year.  The public-finance  deficit  will be 2.8 percent of gross
domestic product, compared with the 2.9 percent target, the
Prague-based ministry said in a quarterly forecast published
today. The gap was 4.4 percent last year, less than initially
expected, and would be 2.5 percent if stripped of one-time items
such as the $3 billion settlement with churches for property
confiscated under the former communist regime.  The $217 billion  economy  is shrinking as households and
businesses spend less due to  Europe ’s debt crisis and government
austerity measures. The longest-recession on record, which is
taming inflation, has pushed the central bank to cut rates to
effectively  zero  and sparked a debate among policy makers
whether to stimulate the economy by weakening the koruna.  The forecast shows the economy will “at best” stagnate
this year, “but the risks of the prognosis are tilted in the
downward direction,” the ministry said. “Regarding internal
risks, the central scenario again assumes a decline in domestic
demand in 2013.”  GDP has shrunk for four consecutive quarters, bringing the
decline to 1.2 percent in 2012, Statistics Office data show.  The economy may exit the recession in the first half of
this year with a “very gradual” recovery, the ministry said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
