Borjomi, the Georgian  mineral water 
popular across the former  Soviet Union , is set to return to
Russia following a seven-year ban as tensions ease between the
countries that fought a war in 2008.  The company met the required public-health criteria set by
Russia’s Rospotrebnadzor consumer-protection watchdog and awaits
final registration approval, IDS Borjomi International said by
e-mail today. Shipments will be carried out by its local unit,
IDS Borjomi Russia, said the company, based in the Ukrainian
capital, Kiev.  Russia has prohibited Borjomi imports since 2006, when a
ban was imposed on Georgian wine and agricultural products. It
will join other Georgian products returning to Russia after the
first round of sanitation checks held in the Black Sea country.  A resumption of imports would mark a victory for Georgian
Prime Minister Bidzina Ivanishvili, a Russian-trained economist
and engineer who promised to improve political and economic ties
with the country’s northern neighbor following his upset
election victory in October over the party of President Mikhail Saakashvili. The two nations fought a war in August 2008 over
the breakaway Georgian region of  South Ossetia .  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
