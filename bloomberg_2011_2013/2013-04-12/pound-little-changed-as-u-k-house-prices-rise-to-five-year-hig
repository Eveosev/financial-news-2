U.K. government bonds advanced for
a second day after a report showed retail sales in the U.S.
unexpectedly fell in March by the most in nine months, boosting
demand for British assets as a refuge.  The pound slipped from a seven-week high versus the dollar
even after an industry report showed U.K. house prices climbed
to a five-year high last month. German bunds advanced as a
Cypriot government official said the nation’s president is
discussing a possible aid boost.  Germany ’s Handelsblatt
newspaper reported talks among euro-area finance ministers in
Dublin on direct bank recapitalization from  Europe ’s bailout
fund is “going in circles.”  “Core yields are attracting support,” said Jamie Searle,
a fixed-income strategist at Citigroup Inc. in  London . “Gilts
are facing strong bearish risks, but this is being offset by
safe-haven demand.”  Benchmark 10-year gilt yields fell four basis points, or
0.04 percentage point, to 1.73 percent at 4:39 p.m. London time.
The 1.75 percent bond due September 2022 rose 0.34, or 3.40
pounds per 1,000-pound ($1,536) face amount, to 100.19. The rate
has climbed 10 basis points since April 5, the first  weekly
increase  since the five days through March 8.  German 10-year yields slid four basis points to 1.26
percent.  U.S. retail sales dropped 0.4 percent, the biggest decline
since June, following a 1 percent gain in February, Commerce
Department figures showed today in  Washington . The median
forecast of 85 economists surveyed by Bloomberg called for an
unchanged reading.  Increasing Funds  What Cypriot President Nicos Anastasiades “is discussing
with European officials is the possibility of increasing
European funds, for growth and social cohesion,” government
spokesman Christos Stylianides said in a statement e-mailed from
Nicosia.  Euro-area ministers endorsed an extension to rescue loans
for Ireland and  Portugal , while all 27 European Union members
will discuss banking regulation.  The average cost of a home in England and  Wales  gained 0.2
percent from February to 230,078 pounds, Acadametrics Ltd. and
 LSL Property Services Plc (LSL)  said today. Excluding London, prices
fell 0.1 percent.  Sterling dropped 0.2 percent to $1.5359 after rising to
$1.5412 yesterday, the highest since Feb. 20. It has advanced
0.2 percent this week. The pound was little changed at 85.24
pence per euro after touching 84.90, the strongest level since
April 8.  Currency Indexes  The pound has declined 4.4 percent this year, according to
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes, which track 10
developed-nation currencies. The dollar rose 1.8 percent and the
euro strengthened 1 percent.  The Debt Management Office is scheduled to sell 2.25
billion pounds of gilts due in 2044 on April 18, while a report
on April 16 will show the annual  inflation  rate held at 2.8
percent in March, according to the median estimate of 36
analysts in a Bloomberg News survey.  The debt office said on its website today it will auction
index-linked gilts due in 2062 in a so-called mini-tender
operation on April 30. Further details will be announced on
April 19, it said.  Gilts returned 1 percent this year through yesterday,
according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. German bonds gained
