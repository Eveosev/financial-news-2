Cleveland Indians pitcher Carlos Carrasco was suspended for eight games by Major League Baseball
for throwing at and hitting  New York  Yankees third baseman Kevin Youkilis.  Carrasco, who was demoted to the Indians’ Triple-A minor-
league affiliate earlier this week, will begin serving the
suspension when he is recalled to the major leagues, MLB Senior
Vice President of Standards and On-Field Operations Joe Garagiola Jr. said today in an e-mailed release. Should Carrasco
file an appeal, the discipline will be delayed until that
process is complete.  Carrasco was ejected from the game against the Yankees on
April 9 after hitting Youkilis in the shoulder. The Indians were
trailing 7-0 and Carrasco had just given up a home run to
Robinson Cano.  The 26-year-old Carrasco began the season on suspension for
hitting a batter two years ago. He missed the 2012 season due to
injury.  To contact the reporter on this story:
