Entertainer Jay-Z is applying to
become a certified baseball agent, according to the Major League
Baseball Players Association.  Jay-Z, whose given name is Shawn Carter, submitted the
application two days ago, MLBPA spokesman  Greg Bouris  said
yesterday in a telephone interview. Bouris said there was no
timetable for the union to process the application.  Jay-Z’s Roc Nation Sports and  Creative Artists Agency 
announced earlier this month a joint representation venture with
New York Yankees second baseman Robinson Cano as its first
client. Under the partnership, CAA’s agents will handle Cano’s
contract negotiations, while Roc Nation handles the four-time
All-Star’s marketing endeavors. CAA’s Brodie Van Wagenen is
listed as Cano’s agent, replacing  Scott Boras .  Roc Nation spokeswoman Jana Fleishman did not immediately
respond to a voice message seeking comment on the pending
application.  Jay-Z must sell his stake in the Brooklyn Nets in order to
represent National Basketball Association players.  -- Editor: Rob Gloster  To contact the reporter on this story:
