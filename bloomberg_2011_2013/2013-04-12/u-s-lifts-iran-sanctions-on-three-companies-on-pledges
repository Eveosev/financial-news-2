The U.S. is lifting sanctions
imposed in 2011 on three companies accused of doing business
with  Iran  after they pledged not to pursue such activity in the
future, the State Department said.  Tanker Pacific Management Pte Ltd., based in  Singapore ,
Société Anonyme Monégasque D’Administration Maritime Et
Aérienne, also known as Samama, of  Monaco , and Allvale Maritime
Inc. of Liberia were placed under sanctions for their roles in a
September 2010 transaction that provided a tanker valued at
$8.65 million to an Iranian shipping company, the State
Department said today in a statement.  “Since sanctions were applied, these companies have taken
significant steps to ensure that their operations are in
compliance with U.S. sanctions law and policy, and have provided
reliable assurances that they will not knowingly engage in such
sanctionable activity in the future,” State Department
spokesman Patrick Ventrell said in the statement.  “As a
result, the secretary of state has decided to lift sanctions at
this time.”  When the sanctions were imposed in May 2011, the U.S.
prohibited American financial institutions from  making loans or
providing other credit  exceeding $10 million in a 12-month
period to each of the three companies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
