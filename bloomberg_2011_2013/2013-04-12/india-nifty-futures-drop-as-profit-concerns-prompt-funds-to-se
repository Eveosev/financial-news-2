ended June 2010, the data show. Foreign funds were net sellers

revenue growth and continued pressure on margins,” Manishi Raychaudhuri and Gautam Mehta, analysts at BNP Paribas SA, wrote

current-account deficit, expanded at the weakest pace since 2003
in the year to March 31.  Industrial output  shrank 1.3 percent in February, according

earlier in March from almost 11 percent in February, according

today.  Shares of  Tata Steel Ltd. (TATA)  and  Steel Authority of India Ltd. (SAIL) 
have each slumped at least 30 percent this year, while  Jindal

declined 20 percent.  “Our analysts expect the weakest earnings performances
from autos, building materials, capital goods and property

at 12.5 times  projected 12-month profits , compared with the MSCI
