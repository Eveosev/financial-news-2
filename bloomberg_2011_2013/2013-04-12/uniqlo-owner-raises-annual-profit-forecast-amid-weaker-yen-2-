Fast Retailing Co. (9983) ,  Asia ’s largest
clothing retailer, raised its forecast for annual profit as the
seller of Uniqlo branded apparel benefits from a weakening yen.  Net income  will probably be 91.5 billion yen ($918 million)
for the year ending August, higher than its previous forecast of
87 billion yen, the Yamaguchi, Japan-based company said
yesterday in a statement. Operating profit for the overseas
Uniqlo business rose 40 percent for the six months ended
February, while declining 4.5 percent domestically amid a price
cut.  Billionaire Tadashi Yanai’s casual clothes maker has opened
new stores, including one in  Tokyo ’s Ginza shopping district,
under a plan to revamp the Uniqlo brand’s utilitarian image.
Fast Retailing posted a 13 percent gain in net income to 65.4
billion yen for the six months, aided by a 11.1 billion yen gain
from favorable currency exchange.  The stock traded 0.9 percent lower to close at 34250 yen in
Tokyo trading today. Lower profitability in the domestic
business provided a “negative surprise,” Credit Suisse analyst
Taketo Yamate said in a note today.  The clothing maker’s outlook for the year ending August
assumes an exchange rate of 82 yen per dollar, it said. The yen
touched 99.88 on April 10, the weakest since April 14, 2009.  The  Bank of Japan  this month said it will double the
monetary base by the end of 2014 through buying  government
bonds . The Japanese currency has lost about 19 percent against
the  U.S. dollar  over the past 12 months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
