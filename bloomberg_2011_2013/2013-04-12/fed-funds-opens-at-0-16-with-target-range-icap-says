Fed funds, the U.S. overnight
inter-bank lending  rate , opened at 0.16 percent, within the
 Federal Reserve ’s target of zero to 0.25 percent.  Fed funds closed at 0.08 percent yesterday after trading
from 0.08 percent to 0.28 percent and averaging 0.13 percent,
according to ICAP Plc, the world’s largest inter-dealer broker.  The central bank will acquire $1.25 billion to $1.75
billion Treasuries maturing from February 2036 to February 2043.
The transactions are part of the Fed’s latest round of debt
purchases, known as quantitative easing, aimed to keep long-term
rates low and support economic growth.  To contact the reporter on this story:
