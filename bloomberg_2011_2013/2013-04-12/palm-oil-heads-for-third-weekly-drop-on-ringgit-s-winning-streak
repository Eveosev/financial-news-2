Palm oil  headed for a third weekly
drop as the Malaysian currency gained against the dollar,
reducing the appeal of ringgit-denominated futures.  The contract for June delivery declined as much as 0.4
percent to 2,343 ringgit ($772) a metric ton on the Bursa
Malaysia Derivatives exchange, before ending the morning session
little changed at 2,352 ringgit in  Kuala Lumpur . The commodity,
used in everything from biofuels to candy to noodles, is set to
drop 0.3 percent this week.  The ringgit is poised for a fourth weekly gain, its longest
winning streak in 14 months, on speculation the ruling coalition
will win national elections set for May 5 and continue its
economic reforms. The ringgit has climbed 0.7 percent this week
to 3.0353 per dollar, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The last time it advanced for four weeks in a row or more was
the period ended Feb. 3, 2012.  “The stronger ringgit could result in poor sales numbers
in April and May for refiners and dealers,” said Paramalingam Supramaniam, director at Kuala Lumpur-based brokerage Pelindung
Bestari Sdn. “There is hardly any speculative play and
fundamentals had taken a dominant role and this explains the
lackluster volume and range.”  Exports from  Malaysia  climbed 3.5 percent to 456,440 tons
in the first 10 days of April from the same period in March,
Intertek said April 10. Exports gained 5.4 percent to 462,276
tons, said Societe Generale de Surveillance.  Output in Malaysia climbed 2.2 percent to 1.33 million tons
in March, exports rose 10 percent to 1.54 million tons, while
 inventories  shrank 11 percent to 2.17 million tons, the steepest
monthly drop since January 2011, the palm oil board said April
10.  Soybean oil  for July delivery was little changed at 49.97
cents a pound on the Chicago Board of Trade. Soybeans for
delivery in July climbed 0.3 percent to $13.72 a bushel.  Refined palm oil for September delivery gained 0.4 percent
to 6,316  yuan  ($1,020) a ton on the  Dalian Commodity Exchange .
Soybean oil for delivery in the same month was little changed at
7,846 yuan a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
