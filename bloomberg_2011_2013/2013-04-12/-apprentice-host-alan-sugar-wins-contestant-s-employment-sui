Alan Sugar, chairman of Amshold
Securities Ltd., won an employment dispute filed by a woman who
said she had been unfairly fired from the job she obtained from
winning the U.K. version of “The Apprentice.”  A London tribunal unanimously ruled Stella English, who won
the reality-TV show in 2010, resigned from her 100,000 pound-a-
year-job ($153,730) at Viglen Ltd.  “I have been cleared of a derisory attempt to smear my
name and extract money from me,” Sugar, the businessman who is
the star of the program, said in a press release posted on
Twitter. “I’m afraid she underestimated me and her reputation
is now in tatters.”  Philippa Jackson, a lawyer for English, didn’t immediately
respond to an e-mail seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
