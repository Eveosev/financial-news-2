The number of  oil rigs  drilling in
the U.S. rose for the third consecutive week, rising by 30 to
1,387,  Baker Hughes Inc. (BHI)  said.  Oil rigs have jumped by 63 in the past three weeks, the
biggest three-week advance in more than a year. They reached the
highest level since Nov. 23.  Gas rigs also gained, rising by two to 377, according to
data on the website of the Houston-based field-services company.
Gas wells reached the lowest level since 1999 last week. The
total count rose 33 to 1,771.  U.S.  gas stockpiles  dropped 14 billion cubic feet to 1.673
trillion in the week ended April 5, according to the Energy
Information Administration, the Energy Department’s statistical
arm. A deficit to year-earlier levels widened to 32.5 percent
from 31.6 percent a week earlier, a record in EIA data going
back to 2005.  “It’s the first time since 2008 that inventories were
below the five-year average at the start of the refill season,
in part, due to the recent cold weather and decreased drilling
for natural gas wells,” Christian O’Neill, a Bloomberg
Industries analyst in New York, said yesterday.  Natural gas for May delivery gained 10.3 cents, or 2.5
percent, to $4.242 per million British thermal units on the New
York Mercantile Exchange at 1:10 p.m. Futures have more than
doubled from a year ago.  U.S.  oil output  climbed 30,000 barrels a day last week to
7.18 million barrels a day, reaching a 20-year high, EIA data
show. Stockpiles rose 250,000 barrels to 388.9 million, the
highest in more than 22 years.  Crude for May delivery on the Nymex fell $2.47, or 2.6
percent, to $91.04 a barrel, down 12 percent in the past year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
