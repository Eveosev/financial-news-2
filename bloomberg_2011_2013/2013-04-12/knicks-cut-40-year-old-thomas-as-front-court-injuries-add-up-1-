The  New York Knicks  waived 40-year-
old forward Kurt Thomas as the National Basketball Association
team deals with injuries to its front court.  Thomas missed the last 12 games with a stress fracture in
his foot and wasn’t going to return this season, General Manager
Glen Grunwald said today in an e-mailed release. The move allows
the Knicks to free a roster spot, which they used to sign 28-
year-old forward Solomon Jones,  CBS Sports  reported.  Jones joins a team that is thin at forward and center.
 Tyson Chandler , Kenyon Martin, Rasheed Wallace, Amar’e Stoudemire and Marcus Camby are all sidelined with injuries.  “Kurt’s contributions to the Knicks have been
immeasurable,” Grunwald said in the release. “The team’s
success this season has been driven by veteran leadership on and
off the court -- it is something that cannot be quantified or
read in a box score.”  The Knicks are 51-27, in second place in the Eastern
Conference standings behind the defending-champion Miami Heat.
New York has clinched its first Atlantic Division title in 19
years.  A 6-foot-10 center, Jones played in the NBA most recently
with the  New Orleans Hornets , averaging 5.5 points and 3.7
rebounds per game in 11 games last season. He played in the
Chinese Basketball Association after his time with the Hornets,
according to the CBS report.  Thomas averaged 2.5 points and 2.3 rebounds in 39 games
with the Knicks this year, his 20th NBA season. It was his
second stint with the Knicks, after playing for the team from
1998 to 2005.  To contact the reporter on this story:
