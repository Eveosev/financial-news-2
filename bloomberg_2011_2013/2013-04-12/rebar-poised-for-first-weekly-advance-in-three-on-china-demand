Steel reinforcement-bar futures in
Shanghai headed for the first weekly gain in three amid a
seasonal increase in demand in China, the biggest consumer, and
as iron ore prices climbed.  The contract for October delivery on the Shanghai Futures
Exchanged rose as much as 0.5 percent to 3,844  yuan  ($621) a
metric ton, before trading at 3,827 yuan at 11:25 a.m. local
time. Futures were set for a 0.8 percent gain this week, after
losing a total of 2.1 percent in the past two weeks.  Warmer, drier weather across China in the spring is
gradually allowing activity to start on infrastructure and
housing projects across the country, boosting demand for the
building material, Xu Jiashun, analyst at Yongan Futures Co.,
said by phone from Hangzhou today. Iron ore prices rose to a
one-month high yesterday, according to The Steel Index Ltd.  “Rebar benefited this week from seasonal demand and the
firm performance in the iron ore price,” Xu said.  The spot  iron ore  at Tianjin port gained 0.2 percent to
$140.90 a dry ton yesterday, the highest level since March 12,
The Steel Index Ltd. data show. The steel-making ingredient has
gained 3.7 percent this week.  The average  spot price  of rebar was little changed at 3,644
yuan a ton yesterday, heading for a 0.4 percent gain this week,
according to Beijing Antaike Information Development Co.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
