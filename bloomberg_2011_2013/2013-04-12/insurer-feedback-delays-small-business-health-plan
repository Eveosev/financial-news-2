The U.S. delayed a feature of the
Affordable Care Act that was intended to help small businesses
because of concerns raised by insurers, Health and Human
Services Secretary  Kathleen Sebelius  said today.  Employees at small businesses were supposed to have a
choice of health plans in a network of online insurance
marketplaces, called exchanges, starting Oct. 1. Instead, their
bosses will have to choose a single plan to cover their entire
workforce, the administration said last month.  “To try to get the aggregated premiums, all the choice
plans up and running in year one was probably going to lead to
some major glitches,” Sebelius said in response to a question
at a hearing of the House Ways and Means Committee in  Washington 
today.  The decision came after feedback from insurers, whom she
didn’t name, and other parties.  “We really took that advice seriously,” Sebelius told
Representative Kenny Marchant, a Republican from  Texas , who
asked her about the delay.  Workers will be able to choose their own plans starting in
2015, Sebelius said. Meanwhile, “the employer will have a
competitive market for the first time ever,” beginning next
year, she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
