The University of North Carolina at
Chapel Hill will announce its next chancellor today after a vote
of its board of governors, according to the school’s  website .  Carol Folt, the interim president of Dartmouth College,
will be the public university’s next leader, the News & Observer
 newspaper  of Raleigh, North Carolina, reported today, citing
three unnamed sources.  Folt, an environmental scientist, served as provost at
Dartmouth, in Hanover, New Hampshire, before being named interim
president July 1 following the resignation of Jim Yong Kim, who
became president of the World Bank. At North Carolina, Folt
would succeed Holden Thorp, who announced his resignation in
September after athletes and faculty were implicated in an
academic cheating scandal.  UNC declined to comment. An e-mail sent to Folt wasn’t
immediately returned.  To contact the reporter on this story:
