In 1947, the U.S. Constitution went
on a country-wide tour aboard the “Freedom Train.”
Enthusiastic crowds greeted it at 300 stops in all 48 states,
but the trip was not without controversy.  (To listen to the podcast, click  here .)  Also aboard were the  Magna Carta ,  Thomas Jefferson ’s draft
of the Declaration of Independence and 124 other documents
celebrating liberty.  Not making it onto the Freedom Train: the Fourteenth
Amendment, guaranteeing equal protection, and the Fifteenth
Amendment, prohibiting racial discrimination in voting.  At stops in the South, the audience was segregated, whites
entering the train at one time, blacks at another.  According to Ray Raphael, author of “Constitutional Myths:
What We Get Wrong and How to Get It Right,” many current
discussions of the document are blindly self-serving and as
ideologically segregated as the southern leg of the Freedom
Train tour.  I spoke with  Raphael  on the following topics:  1. Vigorous & Energetic Government  2. Direct & Indirect Taxes  3. Hard Compromises  4. Wiggle Room  5.
