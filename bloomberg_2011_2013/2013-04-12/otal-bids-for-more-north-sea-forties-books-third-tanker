Total SA failed to buy more  North
Sea  Forties crude, having bought nine cargoes since March 27,
even as it bid at a higher level than yesterday’s trade.  The  oil company , Europe’s third-largest, also chartered a
supertanker to transport North Sea Forties crude to South Korea.
That increased total shipments to the country so far this year
to 13 million barrels, according to a shipbroker report.  North Sea  Total failed to buy Forties for loading April 24 to April
26 at 35 cents less than Dated Brent, according to a Bloomberg
survey of traders and brokers monitoring the Platts pricing
window. That compares with a deal yesterday at minus 60 cents.  Reported crude trading typically occurs during the Platts
window, which ends at 4:30 p.m.  London  time. Forties loading in
10 to 25 days widened by 30 cents to a discount of 62 cents a
barrel to Dated Brent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
That’s the widest since April 2.  Brent futures for May settlement traded at $101.66 a barrel
on the ICE Futures Europe exchange in London at the close of the
window, compared with $104.74 yesterday. The June contract was
$101.67 at the same time today, a premium of 1 cent to May.  The Olympia will load 275,000 metric tons of Forties grade
on May 10 at Hound Point in the U.K., according to an e-mailed
report from Norwegian shipbroker PF Bassoe AS. CSSA Chartering &
Shipping Services SA, Total’s shipping unit, booked the very
large crude carrier, its third to  South Korea  this year, the
report showed. Hound Point is the loading terminal for Forties.  Mediterranean/Urals  Socar Trading SA sold 600,000 barrels of Azeri Light crude
to Total at a $2.75 a barrel premium to Dated Brent, the survey
of brokers monitoring Platts showed. That compares with a March
7 deal at plus $3.10. The premium on today’s trade is the lowest
since Oct. 2, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  There were no bids or offers for Russian Urals crude for a
third day, according to the survey.  The Urals discount to Dated Brent in the Mediterranean
narrowed by 1 cent to 63 cents a barrel, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. That was the least since Feb. 1. In northwest
 Europe , the  discount  was at $2.09 a barrel compared with $2.08
at yesterday’s close.  West Africa  Benchmark Nigerian Qua Iboe blend dropped 8 cents to $3.35
a barrel more than Dated Brent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  One Angolan crude cargo for loading in May, out of 60
consignments in total, hasn’t been sold, four traders who
participate in the market said.  That’s a bigger proportion of sold cargoes than normal for
this stage of the month, said the people, who asked not to be
identified because the information is confidential. The unsold
lot is a 985,000-barrel cargo of Palanca grade for loading May
28 to May 29, they said.  The loading programs for Angolan and Nigerian crude for
June are due to be published next week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
