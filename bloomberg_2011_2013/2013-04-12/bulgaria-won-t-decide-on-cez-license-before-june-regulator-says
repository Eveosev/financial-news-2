CEZ AS (CEZ) ’s future in Bulgaria won’t
be decided before the middle of June as the Balkan country’s
regulator prepares to open discussions next week.  The Bulgarian regulator will start to discuss the Czech
utility’s license removal on April 16, spokeswoman Ralitsa
Stoyanova said when reached by telephone today.  CEZ, along with  EVN AG (EVN)  and Czech utility Energy-Pro, is
being investigated by the country’s public prosecutor for
allegedly breaching outsourcing contracts. CEZ is suspected of
21 violations including evasion of public procurement laws. CEZ
spokeswoman Barbora Pulpanova said the company denies any
wrongdoing.  High utility bills at the beginning of the year triggered
violent public protests that helped topple the government of
Boyko Borissov and set off the investigation. President Rosen
Plevneliev appointed an interim government led by Premier Marin
Raikov last month to prepare for early elections on May 12.  CEZ filed a complaint against  Bulgaria  at the European
Commission on March 29, claiming that the regulator was breaking
both national and EU laws. The utility has asked the commission
for an independent review.  Bulgaria is the second Balkan country in which CEZ is in
danger of losing its license after Albania seized its assets in
January. Bulgarian operations account for about 1.5 percent of
the Czech utility’s operating income.  To contact the reporter on this story:
