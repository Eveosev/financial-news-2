Russia  may have about 10 million
metric tons of wheat available for export in the 2013-14
marketing year, based on expected production, usage and
rebuilding of stocks, French farm adviser Agritel said.  Wheat typically accounts for no more than 55 percent of
Russia’s grain harvest, and a government forecast for a grain
crop of 90 million to 92 million tons makes it difficult to
expect a wheat harvest significantly above 50 million tons, the
Paris-based company wrote in a market  comment  on its website
today.  Russia’s wheat exports may climb to 15 million tons from
10.5 million tons, according to the U.S. Department of
Agriculture’s  Foreign Agricultural Service . Domestic consumption
of 37.5 million tons and a government move to rebuild
intervention stocks will limit the exportable surplus, according
to Agritel.  “This consideration will encourage Russian exporters to be
very active at the start of the campaign,” Agritel wrote.
“Exporters will offer farmers better prices than those offered
by the authorities in the context of the rebuilding of the
strategic stocks.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
