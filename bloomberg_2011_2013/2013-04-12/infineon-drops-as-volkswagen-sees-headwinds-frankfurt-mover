Infineon Technologies AG (IFX) , Europe’s
second-biggest chipmaker, fell the most in five months after
 Volkswagen AG (VOW)  reported car slower deliveries and headwinds in
Europe, signaling weakening demand for semiconductors.  Volkswagen’s sales growth fell to 0.2 percent in March from
8.3 percent for the first two months of the year, the Wolfsburg,
Germany-based carmaker said in a statement today. Infineon
shares slumped as much as 5 percent to 5.82 euros today, the
biggest decline since Nov. 7. They were down 3 percent as of 4
p.m. in  Frankfurt .  Infineon gets more than 40 percent of its revenue from
chips for the automotive sector, including products that control
functions from fuel injection and interior lighting. The
Neubiberg-based company says it’s the second-biggest  supplier  of
such chips after Renesas Electronics Corp.  Still, Infineon is “well-positioned to capture” growth as
individual cars use ever more computer-controlled parts, Sanford
C. Bernstein analysts led by  Pierre Ferragu  said in a note
yesterday. The company benefits from being exposed to the higher
end of the market, the analysts said.  Car sales will grow to 103.4 million in 2018 from 81.5
million last year, according to projections by researcher IHS
cited by Infineon in its Jan. 31 earnings presentation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
