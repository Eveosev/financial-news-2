U.K. stocks  declined after the
biggest four-day rally for the benchmark FTSE 100 Index in more
than three months.  BAE Systems Plc, Europe’s biggest defense company, and
Legal & General Group Plc, the largest manager of U.K. pension
assets, both lost at least 2.3 percent as JPMorgan Chase & Co.
downgraded the shares. Johnson Matthey Plc climbed 3 percent
after UBS AG recommended investors buy the stock.  The FTSE 100 fell 22.03, or 0.3 percent, to 6,394.11 at
8:31 a.m. in London, paring the gauge’s rally this week to 2.3
percent. The broader FTSE All-Share Index slid 0.4 percent while
Ireland’s ISEQ Index was little changed.  U.K. stocks yesterday posted their biggest four-day gain
since early January as a report showed American unemployment
claims fell more than forecast. Data due at 8:30 a.m. in
Washington today may show U.S. retail sales stagnated in March
after a 1.1 percent gain in February, economists said.  The volume of shares changing hands in companies on the
 FTSE 100 (UKX)  today was 27 percent lower than the average of the last
30 days, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
