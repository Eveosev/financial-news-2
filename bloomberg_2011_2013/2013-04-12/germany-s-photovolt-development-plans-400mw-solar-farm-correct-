Photovolt Development Partners
GmbH, a German developer of solar projects, plans to build a
400-megawatt plant on an island in southwestern  Japan .  The company will develop the plant for TeraSol G.K. on
Ukujima in Nagasaki prefecture, Managing Director Peter
Gerstmann said in an e-mailed response to questions.  The Berlin-based company is developing the station with
partners and the project may cost 90 billion yen ($905 million)
to 110 billion yen including the cost of an undersea cable, he
said. The cable, about 55 kilometers (34 miles) long, will link
the plant to the grid network of  Kyushu Electric Power Co. (9508)   Construction is scheduled to start in the second half of
this year. It may take 2 1/2 years before the plant starts
running, according to Gerstmann.  The company has obtained facility approval from Japan’s
Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, it said.  The company has developed solar power stations in  Germany ,
 Italy  and Spain, according to its  website .  Japan in July began offering incentives through feed-in
tariffs to encourage investments in energy sources such as wind
and solar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
