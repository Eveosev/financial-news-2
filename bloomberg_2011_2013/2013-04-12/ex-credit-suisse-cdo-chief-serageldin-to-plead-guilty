Kareem Serageldin, the ex-global
head of  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) ’s structured credit trading
business, is scheduled to plead guilty to criminal charges today
in Manhattan federal court, a court clerk said.  Serageldin is charged with leading a 2007 scheme to mark up
the value of debt securities to meet targets and boost year-end
bonuses for his $5.35 billion trading book. A U.S. citizen who
lives in  England , he was taken into custody by the FBI April 5
after he was extradited from the U.K., a prosecutor told U.S.
Magistrate Judge Kevin Fox at Serageldin’s arraignment last
week.  Serageldin initially pleaded not guilty to the charges and
was ordered released on $1.5 million bond.  Melissa Seitter, a spokeswoman for the  law firm 
representing Serageldin, declined to comment on a plea.  Last year, two of Serageldin’s former subordinates,  David Higgs  and Salmaan Siddiqui, pleaded guilty to overstating the
value of mortgage-backed assets in a Credit Suisse trading book
known as ABN1 after the collapse of the U.S. housing market.
Both said they acted at Serageldin’s direction and agreed to
cooperate with prosecutors.  Credit Suisse, based in Zurich, fired all three employees
in 2008 and cooperated with the U.S. government’s investigation.  Serageldin is charged with conspiracy, falsification of
books and records and wire fraud. He was arrested outside the
U.S. consulate in London in September.  The U.S. criminal cases are U.S. v. Higgs, 12-cr-00088, and
U.S. v. Siddiqui, 12-cr-00089, U.S. District Court, Southern
District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
