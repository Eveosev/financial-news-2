India’s one-year  interest-rate
swaps  were poised for a third weekly decline on speculation
worsening growth will prompt the central bank to cut borrowing
costs further.  Industrial  output  fell 1.3 percent in February, according
to a Bloomberg News survey before the data due today. Production
rose 2.4 percent in January. The Reserve Bank of India has
lowered its benchmark repurchase  rate  by 50 basis points to 7.5
percent in two reductions this year.  The one-year swap, a derivative contract used to guard
against fluctuations in funding costs, fell three basis points
this week to 7.4 percent as of 10:10 a.m. in Mumbai, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. The rate was little changed today
and matched the level touched on April 10, which was the lowest
since April 4, 2011.  India ’s bond and currency markets were shut
for a holiday yesterday.  “Growth continues to be bleak,” said N.S. Venkatesh,
Mumbai-based head of treasury at state-run IDBI Bank Ltd.
“Investors are factoring in more rate cuts to help the
economy.”  Consumer price  gains slowed to 10.70 percent from a year
earlier in March from 10.91 percent in February, according to a
separate Bloomberg survey before offical data due today.  The yield on the 8.15 percent government bonds due June
2022 fell four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, this week
to 7.89 percent, according to the central bank’s trading system.
The rate fell one basis point today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
