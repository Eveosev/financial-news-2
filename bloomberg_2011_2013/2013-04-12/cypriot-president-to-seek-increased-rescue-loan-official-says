Cyprus President Nicos Anastasiades
will seek an increase in the 10 billion-euro ($13.1 billion)
bailout loan pledged by the euro area, a government official
said.  Anastasiades will ask for a larger loan and more European
Union structural funds and expects the request to be approved
because of the difficult conditions his country faces, said the
official, who asked not to be identified. The president will
make the request in letters to European Union President  Herman Van Rompuy  and European Commission President  Jose Barroso . He
has already spoken to EU Economic and Monetary Affairs
Commissioner  Olli Rehn .  The letters “will refer to the need for a change in the
EU’s policy stance toward Cyprus with extension of further aid,
in light of the critical moments we are going through as a
result of the economic crisis and the measures that have been
imposed on us,” Anastasiades told reporters in Nicosia today.  Euro-area finance ministers meeting in Dublin today are
discussing Cyprus’s bailout. The government on April 2 completed
talks on a euro-area and International Monetary Fund bailout.  Cyprus’s financing needs over the next three years will
amount to about 23 billion euros, according to a draft report of
a debt sustainability analysis earlier this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
