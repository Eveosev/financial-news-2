Japan ’s 10-year government  bonds 
fell for a fourth day this week after results of the central
bank’s operation to buy debt damped demand for the securities.  Bond futures had their biggest drop in a week after the
 Bank of Japan (8301)  offered to purchase a total of 2.51 trillion yen
($25.3 billion) in short- to long-term securities. Investor bids
today to sell debt with more than five years to maturity
increased from the BOJ’s operation on April 8.  The results “were weak for the 5- to 10-year maturities
and the 1- to 10-year tenors,” said  Masaru Hamasaki , a senior
strategist at Tokyo-based Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management Co.,
which manages the equivalent of $107 billion.  Benchmark 10-year yields rose six basis points to 0.635
percent as of 4:24 p.m. in  Tokyo  from yesterday, according to
Japan Bond Trading Co., the nation’s largest interdealer debt
broker. Yields touched a record low of 0.315 percent on April 5.  Five-year rates gained six basis points to 0.255 percent,
while two-year yields were little changed at 0.125 percent.  Thirty-year yields rose 3 1/2 basis points to 1.555 percent
and 20-year rates climbed three basis points to 1.455 percent.  Ten-year bond futures slid 1.00 to 143.73 in Tokyo.  At his first policy meeting, BOJ Governor  Haruhiko Kuroda 
pledged last week to double the monetary base in two years by
buying about 7.5 trillion yen of bonds a month, equivalent to
about 70 percent of new government debt issuances.  To contact the reporter on this story:
