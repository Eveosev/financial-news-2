Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN)  paid Chief
Executive Officer Jeffrey P. Bezos an $81,840 salary last year,
offering no raise and no stock awards, leaving him among the
lowest-paid CEOs running large technology companies.  The remainder of his $1.68 million total compensation was
for security arrangements at “business facilities” and for
corporate travel, the Seattle-based company said today in a
 filing  with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  Bezos asked Amazon not to increase his compensation beyond
what he received in 2011, and he has never been given more cash
than the amount in his current pay package, the company said.
Amazon said it aims to give its top executives “a minimum level
of cash compensation” because it wants their pay to be tied to
building shareholder value.  As Amazon’s founder, Bezos owns almost 87 million shares,
or about a 19 percent  stake , according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The stock surged 45 percent in 2012, and that stake
is currently worth about $23.5 billion. Bezos is the world’s
20th-richest person, with a fortune of $25 billion, according to
the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.  Stock awards helped push  Oracle Corp. (ORCL)  CEO  Larry Ellison ’s
2012 compensation to $96.2 million.  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  CEO  Tim Cook 
received a total package valued at $4.17 million.  Amazon’s shares fell less than 1 percent to $269.29  at
9:31 a.m. in New York. The stock had advanced 7.6 percent this
year through yesterday, compared with a 12 percent gain for the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
