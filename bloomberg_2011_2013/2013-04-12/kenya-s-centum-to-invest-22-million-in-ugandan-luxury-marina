Centum Investment Co. Ltd.,  Kenya ’s
largest publicly traded investment group, is putting $22 million
into a luxury marina project in neighboring  Uganda  that is
expected to be finished by the end of 2016.  Construction of the first phase of Pearl Marina, 20
kilometers (12 miles) southwest of Kampala, the capital, will
start in the second quarter of next year, Graeme Reid, managing
director of Athena Properties Ltd., Centum’s real investment
arm, said today in an interview in the Ugandan capital, Kampala.  “Those who will seek to invest in the project will
build according to our plans,” he said. “We shall invest $22
million during the first phase.”  At least $99.5 million will be invested in initial phase,
with costs reaching $901.7 million when the entire project in
completed, according to a project blueprint obtained by
Bloomberg. Additional information on project partners and
funding details are not provided in the document.  The marina will provide ferry services, water sports, boat
services, a nine-hole golf course and a five-star hotel,
according to Reid. It will also have a shopping mall, holiday
homes, luxury apartments, a hospital and an international

 Coca-Cola Co. (KO) , Kenya Wine Agencies and General Motors Co.’s East
African unit. Uganda discovered oil in 2006 and  Tullow Oil Plc (TLW) ,
