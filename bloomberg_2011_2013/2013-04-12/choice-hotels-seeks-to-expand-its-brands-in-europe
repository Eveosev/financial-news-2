Choice Hotels International Inc. (CHH) ,
owner of such brands as Comfort Inn and Cambria Suites, seeks to
expand in Europe, where the economy has been hindered by the
euro zone’s debt crisis, while many other lodging companies are
growing in Asia, Chief Executive Officer Steve Joyce said.  The franchiser, based in Rockville,  Maryland , sees
opportunity to convert independent hotels in Europe into Choice-
branded properties, Joyce said in an interview on Bloomberg
Television’s “In the Loop” with  Betty Liu . The smaller
buildings may pose a challenge for other operators, he said.  “We do a lot of conversions,” Joyce said. Europe “is
largely unbranded and it wants to be branded. It’s a lot of
local hotels. For most major brand companies, that’s a big
issue. We see this as a huge opportunity.”  Choice in January signed an agreement with Akkeron Hotels
Group Ltd. that will initially result in nine Akkeron properties
in the U.K. operating under Choice franchise agreements. Choice
Hotels  Europe  franchised about 500 hotels across the continent
as of January.  To contact the reporter on this story:
