Thailand ’s baht and  Malaysia ’s
ringgit led Asian currency gains to the best week since January
on speculation  Japan ’s monetary easing will increase the flow of
funds into emerging-market assets.  The baht strengthened beyond 29 per dollar for the first
time since 1997 and the ringgit appreciated for a fourth week,
the longest run in 14 months. South Korea’s won rose this week
after touching an eight-month low on the risk of a nuclear test
or missile launch by North Korea. The Bank of Japan said April 4
it plans to buy 7.5 trillion yen ($75 billion) of bonds a month
in the biggest move since its easing started in 2001.  “I expect the  Bank of Japan (8301) ’s plan to double its monetary
base will lead to a pickup in inflows to emerging Asia,” said
Khoon Goh, a Singapore-based senior strategist at  Australia &
New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. (ANZ)  “Some of the outflows were
likely due to concerns over tensions on the Korean peninsula.”  The baht climbed 1.1 percent from a week ago, the most
since the five-day period ended Jan. 18, to 29.01 per dollar in
Bangkok, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It touched
28.88 on April 10, the strongest level since a devaluation in
July 1997 that sparked the Asian financial crisis. The ringgit
rose 0.6 percent to 3.04 in Kuala Lumpur this week.  The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia Dollar Index, which tracks the
region’s 10 most-active currencies, rose 0.2 percent in the five
days through yesterday, the biggest gain since January. The MSCI
Asia Pacific Index of shares increased 3.3 percent.  Fund Inflows  Global funds  bought  $810 million more Thai sovereign debt
than they sold since the BOJ’s easing announcement, Thai Bond
Market Association data show. This year’s net purchases totaled
$10 billion through April 11, compared with $31 billion for the
whole of 2012. Overseas investors have pumped more than $12
billion into Indian stocks and fixed-income securities this year,
exchange data show.  South Korean President Park Geun Hye offered to resume
dialog with the North in an effort to ease tensions, her
spokeswoman Lee Mi Yon said by phone yesterday. The timeframe
for a North Korean missile launch is until around April 15,
South Korean defense ministry spokesman Kim Min Seok said April
11. The date marks the birth anniversary of the North’s founder
Kim Il Sung.  The won was little changed yesterday and gained 0.2 percent
this week to 1,129.40 per dollar in  Seoul , according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. It touched 1,144.82 on April 9, the
weakest level since July 26.  Yuan Positions  China’s  yuan  reached the highest level this week since the
country unified official and market exchange rates at the end of
1993.  Yuan positions  at local financial institutions stemming
from foreign-exchange transactions, a gauge of cross-border
capital flows, climbed 295 billion yuan ($47 billion) in
February, the central bank said on April 10.  Gross domestic product probably increased 8.1 percent in
the January-March period, according to the median estimate of
economists ahead of data due April 15 in Beijing. That’s more
than the 7.9 percent posted in the previous quarter.  The currency rose for a seventh week, the longest winning
streak since November, climbing 0.2 percent to 6.1922 per dollar
in  Shanghai , prices from the  China  Foreign Exchange Trade System
show. The currency touched the 1993 high of 6.1900 yesterday.  “Capital inflows have been strong as investors see China’s
economic growth remains resilient,” said Daniel Chan, a Hong
Kong-based executive vice president at Glory Sky Global Markets
Ltd. “A stronger exchange rate is also favorable for the
government to boost domestic demand as officials are shifting
the economy away from an export-dependent one.”  Malaysian Vote  Malaysia’s ringgit had a fourth weekly gain on speculation
the ruling coalition will win a May 5 election and continue
economic reforms. The vote will determine if Prime Minister
Najib Razak’s Barisan Nasional alliance can extend its 55-year
rule. Najib has embarked on a $444 billion spending spree to
build railways, roads and power plants to achieve developed-
nation status by 2020.  “The calling of the election, coupled with more market
confidence that Najib is likely to win, has been the main driver
for the week,” said Rob Ryan, a Singapore-based currency
strategist at Royal Bank of Scotland Plc.  Elsewhere in Asia,  Indonesia ’s rupiah rose 0.3 percent from
a week earlier to 9,713,  India ’s rupee gained 0.5 percent to
54.5250 and  Vietnam ’s dong climbed 0.3 percent to 20,855. The
Philippine peso fell 0.3 percent to 41.265 and  Taiwan ’s dollar
weakened 0.2 percent to NT$29.995.  To contact the reporters on this story:
