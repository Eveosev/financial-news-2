The leu strengthened, reversing
earlier losses, after BNP Paribas SA and  Societe Generale  SA
recommended investors buy Romania’s debt ahead of local bond
sales next week.  The currency headed for its biggest weekly gain in almost
three months as BNP Paribas said investors should buy April 2020
bonds at a government auction. Societe Generale said it sees
“good reason” to swap Hungarian bonds with their Romanian
counterparts, while lowering its yield target for notes due in
2015 and 2016 to 5 percent from 5.2 percent it stated earlier.  “The recent improvement in interbank liquidity could have
a very positive impact on the Romanian  bond market  in the coming
weeks,”  Bartosz Pawlowski , the head of foreign-exchange and
interest rate strategy for central and eastern  Europe ,  Middle
East  and  Africa  at BNP Paribas, said in a note.  The leu appreciated 0.2 percent to 4.3815 per euro by 5:29
p.m. in Bucharest, extending its advance to 0.7 percent this
week, the most since Jan. 18, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It has gained 1.6 percent this year, the best
performer among eastern European and African currencies tracked
by Bloomberg. The leu lost as much as 0.2 percent in earlier
trading.  Romania’s borrowing costs fell to a record at a second sale
of euro-denominated bonds on the domestic market this year
yesterday as the government sold almost three times more debt
than planned.  The  Finance Ministry  placed 581 million euros ($759
million) in the reopening of three-year bonds due February 2016
at an average yield of 2.9 percent, the lowest since the central
bank started recording the data in 2005. Total demand stood at
765 million euros for 200 million euros of securities on sale.  The ministry plans to sell 300 million lei ($89 million) in
leu-denominated, seven-year bonds on April 15 as part of its
plan to raise 2.5 billion lei from the domestic market this
month, excluding yesterday’s euro-denominated debt sale.  To contact the reporters on this story:
