Leeds United named Brian McDermott
as manager, the English soccer club said on its website.  McDermott, 52, received a three-year contract to replace
 Neil Warnock , Leeds said. The hiring comes 32 days after he was
fired by Reading, which he led to Premier League promotion last
season by winning the second-tier Championship.  Warnock left Leeds on April 1 with the team 11th in the 24-
team Championship. A 2-1 loss to Charlton last weekend was the
club’s fourth straight and left it 10 points off the league’s
playoff places with five games remaining and just five points
above the relegation zone.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
