since January on concern that U.S. and European economies are
weakening, reducing fuel demand at the same time refineries
increase output.  Prices slid to the lowest intraday level since Jan. 18.

supplies and refinery inputs rose last week, government data
show. The motor fuel is the worst performer this month in the
Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index of 24 materials.  “The problems in Europe seem to have bubbled up again and

fundamentals,” said  Gene McGillian , an analyst and broker at
Tradition Energy in  Stamford ,  Connecticut .  Gasoline for May delivery fell 5 cents, or 1.8 percent, to

second consecutive weekly loss. Futures have dropped 13 percent
