The Inter-American Development Bank
will create a $50 million loan facility to spur development of
energy-efficiency projects in Latin America and the Caribbean.  The facility will provide small loans to help companies cut
their electricity costs and curb greenhouse-gas emissions, the
Washington-based lender said today in an e-mailed statement.  The  Nordic Development Fund , based in Helsinki, will
provide 7 million euros ($9.2 million) to partially guarantee
the loans, according to the statement. It will furnish another 1
million euros in grants to help companies identify and study
possible projects, which may include the installation of energy-
efficient lighting or solar panels.  To contact the reporter on this story:
