Citigroup Inc. (C)  raised its 2013
forecasts for Brent and West Texas Intermediate crudes because
of higher-than-estimated prices in the first quarter while at
the same time predicting “death bells” for commodities’ rally.  Brent will average $104 a barrel this year, up from a
previous prediction of $99, according to the report by analysts
led by  Edward Morse , Citi’s global head of commodities research
in  New York . Prices will decline from an average $112 a barrel
in 2012, the e-mailed report said.  “Fast money flows amid a risk-on rally took Brent to $119
in February, but since then prices have fallen sharply,” the
report said. “Citi expects this move lower will continue as
fundamentals remain weak.”  Brent for May settlement tumbled $1.97, or 1.9 percent, to
$102.30 a barrel at 1:11 p.m. New York time on the London-based
ICE Futures Europe exchange. Prices are down 7.9 percent so far
this year.  WTI futures will average $90 a barrel in 2013, more than
the previous forecast of $85. Prices averaged about $94 last
year. WTI for May delivery dropped $2.50, or 2.7 percent, to
$91.01 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .  “Citi expects 2013 to be the year in which the death bells
ring for the commodity supercycle after its duly noted sunset,
ushering in a new decade of opportunities based on how
individual commodities will perform against one another and
against broader market indicators such as equities or
currencies,” Morse said in the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
