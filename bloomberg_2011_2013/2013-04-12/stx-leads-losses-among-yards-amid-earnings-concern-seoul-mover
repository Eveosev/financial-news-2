STX Offshore & Shipbuilding Co. (067250) , a
South Korean yard that is undergoing debt rescheduling, led a
decline among shipyards and engine makers in Seoul trading on
concerns that first-quarter earnings may be worse than expected.  STX Offshore, the world’s fourth-largest shipyard, fell 13
percent to close at 3,230 won, the lowest price since it started
trading in October 2003.  STX Engine Co. (077970) , the world’s third-
biggest marine engine maker, fell 15 percent to 4,125 won.  Concerns that earnings at South Korean companies may fall
below projections were spread after  GS Engineering &
Construction Corp. (006360)  reported an unexpected loss from rising
costs, according to E*Trade Securities  Korea . Shipyards posted
losses or profit declines in the fourth quarter on lower ship
prices and a drop in orders for new vessels.  “GS Engineering’s loss has spooked investors,” said Park Moo Hyun, an analyst at E*Trade. “Investors are becoming more
doubtful about earnings prospects not just for shipyards. STX
Group shares were the worst hit because small investors are
dumping the shares.”  GS Engineering posted an operating loss of 535.4 billion
won ($474 million) for the first quarter as costs at overseas
projects jumped. Analysts expected a profit of 69 billion won,
according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg.  The Seoul-based company expects a loss for this year and
profit in the first half of 2014, according to a regulatory
filing April 10. Its stock fell by the daily 15 percent limit
for a second day to 35,700 won.  Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering Co. (042660) , the world’s
second-biggest yard, fell 7.7 percent to 24,500 won.  Hyundai
Heavy Industries Co. (009540) , the world’s biggest, declined 6 percent to
188,000 won.  To contact the reporter on this story:
