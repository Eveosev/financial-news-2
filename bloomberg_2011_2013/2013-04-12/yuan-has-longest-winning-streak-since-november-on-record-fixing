China ’s  yuan  gained for a seventh
week, the longest winning streak in five months, after the
central bank set a record reference rate on signs capital
inflows are on the rise.  The currency jumped to a 19-year high after the People’s
Bank of China raised the daily  fixing  by 0.12 percent to 6.2506
per dollar, the strongest since a peg to the greenback ended in
July 2005. The spot price is allowed to trade 1 percent either
side of that.  Yuan positions  at Chinese banks from the sale of
foreign exchange climbed 295 billion yuan ($48 billion) in
February, the PBOC said April 10. The amount, an indicator of
cross-border fund flows, has increased 1.1 trillion yuan since
the start of December.  “Capital inflows have been strong as investors see China’s
economic growth remains resilient,” said  Daniel Chan , a Hong
Kong-based executive vice president at Glory Sky Global Markets
Ltd. “A stronger  exchange rate  is also favorable for the
government to boost domestic demand as officials are shifting
the economy away from an export-dependent one.”  The yuan strengthened 0.17 percent from a week ago to close
at 6.1922 per dollar in  Shanghai , prices from the China Foreign
Exchange Trade System show. It gained 0.7 percent today and
touched 6.1900, the strongest level since the government unified
official and market exchange rates at the end of 1993.  Economic Growth  The nation’s foreign-exchange reserves increased by $128
billion in the first quarter to a record $3.44 trillion, higher
than the $3.36 trillion median estimate in a Bloomberg News
survey, official data showed yesterday. Overwhelming demand for
the yuan is expected to persist in both onshore and offshore
markets in coming months, Commonwealth Bank of Australia
strategist Andy Ji wrote in a research note yesterday. Ji said
the yuan remained in the bank’s “core longs,” referring to
bets that profit from appreciation.  Gross domestic product probably climbed 8 percent in the
January-March period, according to the  median estimate  of
economists ahead of data due April 15 in Beijing.  In Hong Kong’s offshore market, the Chinese currency
climbed 0.19 percent this week, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
It was little changed at 6.1870 per dollar today. Twelve-month
non-deliverable forwards rose 0.54 percent this week, the best
performance since the five days ended Jan. 11. The contracts
traded at a 1 percent discount to the spot rate in Shanghai.  One-month implied volatility in the onshore yuan, a measure
of expected moves in the exchange rate used to price options,
increased 15 basis points, or 0.15 percentage point, to 1.4
percent this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
