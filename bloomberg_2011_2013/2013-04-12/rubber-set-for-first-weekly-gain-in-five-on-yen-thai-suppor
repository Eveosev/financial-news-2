Rubber headed for the first weekly
advance in five as the yen near a four-year low against the
dollar boosted investor interest in the yen-denominated futures
and after Thailand took measures to bolster prices.  Futures for delivery in September was up 0.3 percent at
277.7 yen a kilogram ($2,790 a metric ton) on the Tokyo
Commodity Exchange at 11:00 a.m. in Tokyo, near the highest
settlement in two weeks reached yesterday. Futures have gained
9.3 percent this week.  The yen neared 100 per dollar, the weakest level since
April 2009, amid speculation money will flow out of Japan in
search of higher yields as the nation’s central bank took
unprecedented monetary easing to spur inflation. Thailand, the
world’s largest producer, targets to lower shipments by 10
percent through end of May to help support prices, Deputy Farm
Minister Yuttapong Charasathien said yesterday.  “Investors have focused on whether producing countries
will agree to take coordinated action to bolster prices,”
Takaki Shigemoto, analyst at research company JSC Corp. in
Tokyo, said today by phone.  Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia, which represent 70
percent of global rubber production, will conclude a three-day
meeting today over measures to support prices.  Futures in Tokyo entered a bear market on April 1 amid
concerns weak demand from China, the world’s largest consumer,
will expand global glut.  Global natural-rubber reserves are poised to advance to the
highest level in 13 years as production exceeds consumption
through next year, pressuring prices, according to London-based
industry adviser The Rubber Economist.  Thai rubber free-on-board added 1.2 percent to 83.25 baht
($2.86) a kilogram yesterday, according to the Rubber Research
Institute of Thailand. The price rebounded after touching 81.75
baht on April 5, the lowest level since November 2009.  On the Shanghai Futures Exchange, the contract for
September delivery added 0.4 percent to 21,535  yuan  ($3,475) a
ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
