European Union nations are set to
back laws to hand the European Central Bank oversight powers,
even as Germany considers making a declaration voicing its
concerns about the legal basis of the plans,  Michael Noonan ,
Ireland’s finance minister, told reporters.  Noonan said he’s confident that the measures will be
approved at a two-day meeting of the bloc’s finance ministers
that begins today in Dublin, Ireland. Germany’s declaration may
be published alongside the draft law, he said.  “There’s an intention that Germany may have a declaration
they will promulgate,” Noonan said, adding that this wouldn’t
affect the content of the ECB bank supervision plan.  EU leaders called last year for the ECB to take on
oversight powers to help break the link between banks and
governments. The adoption of the legislation enshrining the new
powers snagged last month when Germany requested a series of
changes to the draft accord.  Germany ’s demands included guarantees that the ECB will
respond to information requests from national parliaments and a
commitment that the bloc will weigh treaty changes so that the
new supervision system can be placed on a sounder legal footing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
