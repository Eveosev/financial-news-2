U.S.  stocks  fell, dragging the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index down from a record, as government
data showed retail sales unexpectedly fell in March, commodities
plunged and a gauge of consumer sentiment slipped.  Raw-material and energy shares lost the most among 24
groups in the  S&P 500 . Newmont Mining Corp. slumped 5.9 percent
as gold dropped to its lowest since July 2011. DuPont Co. and
Alcoa Inc. slid at least 0.9 percent.  Banks (SPXL2)  retreated 1.1
percent as Wells Fargo & Co. reported a drop in revenue and M&T
Bank Corp. delayed its planned purchase of Hudson City Bancorp.  The S&P 500 fell 0.3 percent to 1,588.85 at 4 p.m. in  New
York , paring an earlier decline of as much as 0.8 percent. The
 Dow Jones Industrial Average  dropped less than 1 point to
14,865.06, erasing a drop of 0.5 percent earlier in the day. The
benchmark indexes closed at all-time highs yesterday. About 5.9
billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, 5.3 percent
lower than the three-month average.  “We’ve seen this market go up quite a bit,” Terry L. Morris, who helps oversee about $2.6 billion at Wyomissing,
Pennsylvania-based National Penn Investors Trust Co., said by
phone. “A lot of investors are cautious at this point and are
quick to sell on any kind of signs of a slowdown.”  The 0.4 percent decrease in U.S. retail sales, the biggest
since June, followed a 1 percent gain in February, Commerce
Department figures showed today in  Washington . The median
forecast of 85 economists surveyed by Bloomberg called for an
unchanged reading in March. Department stores and electronics
dealers were among the weakest showings.  Consumer Confidence  The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan preliminary
 sentiment index  for April fell to 72.3 from 78.6 in March. No
change was projected for this month’s reading compared with
March, according to the median estimate of 69 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg.  Companies in the U.S. added to inventories in February at
the slowest pace in eight months, a separate Commerce Department
report showed, putting them in a better position to deal with a
subsequent slowdown in demand.  Euro-area finance ministers agreed in principle at a
meeting in Dublin today to extend the maturities on rescue loans
to Ireland and  Portugal  by seven years. Cyprus President Nicos
Anastasiades will seek an increase to the nation’s 10 billion-
euro ($13 billion) bailout from the European Union, according to
a government official, who asked not to be identified.  Bull Market  The  bull market  in U.S. equities entered its fifth year
last month. The  S&P 500 (SPX)  has  surged 135 percent  from a 12-year
low in 2009 as companies reported better-than-estimated earnings
and the Federal Reserve embarked on three rounds of bond
purchases to stimulate the economy. The benchmark gauge added
2.3 percent this week amid optimism over central-bank stimulus
and corporate earnings.  Investors will be watching closely as the number of
earnings reports increases in the weeks ahead, helping to gauge
the health of the economy. Profits at S&P 500 companies dropped
1.4 percent in the first three months of the year, according to
analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. That would mark the
first year-over-year decrease since 2009.  Seventy percent of the 30 companies that have reported
results so far beat estimates. Bank of America Corp., Coca-Cola
Co., Google Inc. and General Electric Co. are among companies
that will release earnings next week.  The Chicago Board Options Exchange  Volatility Index (VIX) , which
measures the cost of using options as insurance against declines
in the S&P 500, fell 1.5 percent to 12.06 today. The gauge,
known as the VIX, is down 33 percent this year and reached its
lowest level since February 2007 last month.  Cyclical Index  Fourteen out of the 24 industries in the S&P 500 declined
today. A gauge of stocks closely tied to economic growth
retreated, as the Morgan Stanley Cyclical Index fell 0.5 percent
to snap a four-day rally. DuPont slipped 0.9 percent to $49.82
and Alcoa lost 1.2 percent to $8.22.  The KBW Bank Index slumped 1.1 percent, even as Wells Fargo
and JPMorgan Chase & Co. posted results that topped analyst
estimates.  Wells Fargo (WFC)  dropped 0.8 percent to $37.21. The largest U.S.
home lender posted a 22 percent rise in first-quarter profit
that beat forecasts as the bank curbed expense growth. Revenue,
mortgage banking income and lending margins fell.  JPMorgan slipped 0.6 percent to $49.01. First-quarter
profit rose 33 percent as improving consumer credit quality
allowed the bank to cut loan-loss reserves by $1.2 billion.
While mortgage volume jumped 37 percent, mortgage-banking net
income dropped 31 percent. The largest  U.S. bank  by assets said
2013 net interest income will be 1 percent lower than the year-
earlier period.  ‘Low Quality’  “They beat, but it’s kind of a low-quality beat,” David Chalupnik, head of equities at Nuveen Asset Management in
 Minneapolis , said in a phone interview. His firm manages $120
billion. “What these companies need to see is better economic
growth and with that an increase in longer term interest rates.
We’re not seeing that yet.”  M&T Bank fell 4.5 percent to $100.24, the lowest close of
the year. The lender said a  Federal Reserve  review of its
compliance with money-laundering rules has delayed its planned
purchase of Hudson City. Shares of Hudson City dropped 5.5
percent to $8.29.  Energy and raw-materials companies in the S&P 500 tumbled
more than 1.3 percent as the S&P/GSCI index of commodities fell
to the lowest level since July.  Gold Plunges  Gold for June delivery tumbled 4.1 percent to settle at
$1,501.40 an ounce in New York, entering what many consider a
 bear market  after slumping more than 20 percent from an August
2011 record. Crude oil lost 2.4 percent to settle at $91.29 a
barrel, the lowest in a month.  Newfield Exploration Co. fell 4.1 percent to $21.70.
Newmont Mining dropped 5.9 percent to $36.37, its lowest close
in four years. Cliffs Natural Resources Inc., the largest U.S.
iron-ore miner, declined 3.6 percent to $19.20.  Home Depot Inc., the largest home-improvement retailer,
jumped 2.4 percent to $73.62 for the biggest gain in the Dow. An
analyst with Jefferies LLC increased his recommendation on the
stock to buy from hold.  Biogen Idec Inc. (BIIB)  advanced 3.4 percent to $207.01. The
biotechnology company was boosted to buy from neutral at Bank of
America Corp.  Ashland Inc. climbed 9.9 percent to $86.66, an all-time
high. Activist investor Jana Partners LLC acquired a 7.4 percent
stake in the biggest producer of specialty papermaking chemicals
and has spoken to management.  To contact the reporters on this story:
