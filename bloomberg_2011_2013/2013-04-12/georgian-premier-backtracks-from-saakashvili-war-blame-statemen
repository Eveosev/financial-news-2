Georgian Prime MinisterBidzina Ivanishvili backtracked from a statement he made this week, when
he blamed President Mikheil Saakashvili for starting a 2008 war
against  Russia .  Saakashvili still should be investigated for his role in
the five-day conflict over the breakaway regions of  South
Ossetia  and Abkhazia, Ivanishvili said in an e-mailed statement
today. The premier on April 10 said the probe may lead to legal
proceedings against the president. Saakashvili won’t cooperate
with such an investigation, he said on public television today.  Tensions have been building between Saakashvili and
Ivanishvili,  Georgia ’s richest man, who defeated the president’s
party in elections last year. He pledged to improve the rule of
law, raise living standards and to develop relations with
Russia, which routed its southern neighbor in the 2008 war,
recognized the independence of South Ossetia and Abkhazia and
vowed to defend their borders.  “It was Russia who violated the territorial borders of a
sovereign country and carried out aggression,” Ivanishvili said
in the statement. “Why did Mr Saakashvili succumb to an obvious
provocation? What actions were taken by the commander-in-chief
and the government?”  Ivanishvili on April 10 said Saakashvili and the government
“acted inadequately” and the Georgian army acted before
Russian forces crossed the border.  To contact the reporter on this story:
