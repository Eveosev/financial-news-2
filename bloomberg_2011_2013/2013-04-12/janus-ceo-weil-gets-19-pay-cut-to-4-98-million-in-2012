 Richard M. Weil, chief executive
officer at  Janus Capital Group Inc. (JNS) , had his compensation
reduced 19 percent to $4.98 million in 2012 as investors
withdrew $12.1 billion from the firm.  Weil, 49, received $500,000 in base salary, $2.85 million
in restricted stock, $1.4 million in non-equity incentive plan
compensation and $232,283 in other compensation, the Denver-
based  money manager  said today in a  filing  with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission.  Weil has worked to diversify the firm known for its
concentrated stock funds, more than tripling the proportion of
assets in fixed-income and adding asset-allocation products.
Janusâ€™s assets increased 5.8 percent in 2012 to $156.8 billion
as global stocks rose 13 percent in 2012, based on the MSCI AC
World Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
