X5 Retail Group NV (FIVE)  declined after
sales growth slowed, opening the way for  OAO Magnit (MGNT)  to overtake
it as  Russia ’s biggest retailer by revenue.  X5 Retail lost as much as 2.3 percent and slid 0.5 percent
to $17.62 by the close in London, its first drop in five days.
The number of shares traded was about 300,000, equivalent to 37
percent of the three-month daily average.  X5, controlled by billionaire Mikhail Fridman’s Alfa Group,
posted an 8.1 percent increase in first-quarter sales to 126
billion rubles ($4.1 billion), according to a statement today.
That compares with growth of 8.6 percent in the fourth quarter.
Earlier this week, Krasnodar-based Magnit said its quarterly
sales rose more than 30 percent to 131 billion rubles.  “Magnit has been far more successful,” Natalia Smirnova,
an analyst at Deutsche Bank AG, said by phone from Moscow. “X5
over the past few years saw operational problems, they lost
customer traffic. They were less aggressive at opening new
stores.”  Since a  London  initial public offering in 2008, Magnit has
tripled its store network to more than 7,000, building new
outlets from scratch in Russia’s regions. In 2011, Magnit
exceeded the market value of X5, which had expanded by acquiring
rivals including Karousel an Kopeyka.  “In the last two years, X5 has been having problems in
digesting its acquisitions and managing stores, which led to
customer outflow,” Ivan Kushch, an analyst at Moscow-based VTB
Capital said by phone. “Magnit was set to overtake it by sales
sometime this year.”  Magnit has surged 76 percent in the past 12 months, giving
it a market value of about $23 billion. X5 is worth $4.8 billion
after falling 21 percent over the same period.  “I’m afraid to be found immodest, but for the first time
over the last 15 years after opening of the first store we have
become the leader in the food retail sector by sales,” Magnit’s
billionaire owner, Sergey Galitskiy, said in a statement today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
