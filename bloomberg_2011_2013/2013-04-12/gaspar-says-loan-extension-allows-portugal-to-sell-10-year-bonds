Portugal  said an extension of the
maturities of its aid loans will help the country issue 10-year
bonds and regain access to debt markets after requesting a
bailout two years ago.  “This deal is extremely important for Portugal because it
allows the country to create enough space to issue a 10-year
bond and that in turn is a crucial step to regain full bond-
market access,” Finance Minister Vitor Gaspar said in Dublin
today after a meeting with euro-area colleagues. The extension
of seven years is “perfectly sufficient,” he said.  The loan extensions for Ireland and Portugal were agreed on
in principle today by finance ministers from the euro area and
the remaining 10 European Union states. For Portugal, the
agreement is subject to the government showing “continued
successful” implementation of its program in a review by
international creditors, ministers said in a joint statement.  To complete that review, Portugal has to find alternative
measures to meet budget targets set in its 78 billion-euro ($102
billion) bailout after its  Constitutional Court  last week
blocked a plan to suspend the equivalent of a monthly salary
payment to state workers and pensioners.  The measures blocked by the court represent 1.3 billion
euros of savings in 2013, or about 0.8 percent of gross domestic
product. Portugal has set a budget-deficit target of 5.5 percent
of GDP in 2013, 4 percent in 2014 and 2.5 percent in 2015, below
the European Union’s 3 percent limit. It forecasts  debt  will
peak at 123.7 percent of GDP in 2014.  P0rtugal last auctioned 10-year debt in January 2011 at a
yield of 6.716 percent, before it sought a bailout.  Troika Returns  The government will “redesign” a measure blocked by the
court that affects payments from recipients of unemployment and
illness subsidies, Gaspar said. It plans budget savings of about
600 million euros and will bring forward “state reform”
measures that may also represent about 600 million euros of
savings, he said. Officials from the so-called troika of bailout
partners will return to Lisbon on April 15.  Before the court ruling, the government had planned to cut
spending by about 4 billion euros in the three years through
2015. Prime Minister  Pedro Passos Coelho  said today that there
are no plans to raise taxes.  Passos Coelho said last month that the government wants to
reduce its refinancing needs in 2015, 2016 and 2020. Both
Ireland and Portugal received rescue loans from two different
programs: the EU-wide European Financial Stabilization Mechanism
and the euro-area’s temporary firewall, the European Financial
Stability Facility.  Debt Redemption  Portuguese government debt agency IGCP said in its monthly
bulletin in March that EFSM loans have an average maturity of
12.4 years and an interest rate cost of 3 percent; EFSF loans
have an average maturity of 14.4 years and a cost of 3 percent;
IMF loans have an average maturity of 7.3 years and a cost of
3.9 percent. In total, the average maturity is 11.2 years and
the cost is 3.3 percent, according to IGCP.  “This extension is very important because it allows
Portugal and Ireland to smooth their debt redemption profiles
and consequently it reduces the two countries’ financing needs
in the post-program period,” Gaspar said. Portugal’s aid
program ends in May 2014.  Portugal has followed Ireland in selling bonds this year.
It sold 2.5 billion euros of five-year bonds through banks to
yield 4.891 percent.  Ten-year bond  yields  fell 5 basis points to 6.31 percent
today. The difference in yield that investors demand to hold
Portugal’s 10-year bonds instead of German bunds has narrowed to
5.05 percentage points from a euro-era record of 16 percentage
points in January 2012.  “Ireland and Portugal had parallel treatment despite being
at different phases of their adjustment programs,” Gaspar said.
“Portugal has tried to follow Ireland’s steps as close as
possible.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
