West Texas Intermediate crude fell
to a one-month low after U.S. retail sales and  consumer
confidence  declined, signaling lower fuel demand.  Futures dropped 2.4 percent as Commerce Department figures
showed that  sales  slipped 0.4 percent last month, the most since
June. A gauge of U.S. consumer sentiment also declined to a
nine-month low. Cyprus was said to seek an increase in the 10
billion euros ($13 billion) in aid pledged by the European
Union. The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index of 24 commodities
tumbled, led by metals and energy futures.  “Until we see some stronger figures signaling greater
economic growth, oil pieces should move lower,” said Chip Hodge, who oversees a $9 billion natural-resource bond portfolio
as senior managing director at Manulife Asset Management in
Boston. “The numbers we’re getting aren’t living up to
expectations.”  WTI crude oil for May delivery declined $2.22 to $91.29 a
barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the lowest
settlement since March 6. Prices fell 1.5 percent this week and
are down 0.6 percent this year. The volume of all futures traded
was 74 percent higher than the 100-day average at 4:26 p.m.  Brent for May settlement fell $1.16, or 1.1 percent, to end
the session at $103.11 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe exchange. It was the lowest settle since July 13. Volume
was 75 percent above the 100-day average for the time of day.  WTI’s  discount  to Brent shrank to as little as $10.34 a
barrel, the least on an intraday basis since Jan. 26, 2012. The
spread ended the session at $11.82.  Abandoned Ship  “It looks like the ship is being abandoned,” said Addison Armstrong, director of market research at Tradition Energy in
Stamford, Connecticut. “This is the second day in which we’ve
seen strong selling accompanied by high volume in both WTI and
Brent. The next target for WTI is right below $90, which is
where we bounced from a little over a month ago.”  Department stores and electronics dealers were among the
retail outlets with the weakest showings, according to the
Commerce Department report released in Washington. The median
forecast of 85 economists surveyed by Bloomberg called for an
unchanged reading in March.  Consumer Confidence  Confidence among Americans fell in April, which may point
to lower consumer spending. The Thomson Reuters/University of
Michigan preliminary index of consumer  sentiment  declined to
72.3 in April from 78.6 a month earlier. This month’s reading
was lower than all 69 estimates in a Bloomberg survey that
called for no change.  The economic figures also sent equities lower. The  Standard
& Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  dropped 0.3 percent and the Dow Jones
Industrial Average was little changed.  Cypriot President Nicos Anastasiades will write to EU
President Herman Van Rompuy and others to request further aid,
said a government official who asked not to be identified.  “The Cyprus news kicked off the move lower because it
raises the prospect of the European crisis getting even worse,
if that’s possible,” said John Kilduff, a partner at Again
Capital LLC, a New York-based hedge fund that focuses on energy.
“The retail-sales numbers were poor. These headlines are
raising the prospect of a spring swoon across the commodity
markets.”  The GSCI Index of raw materials dropped as much 2.2 percent
to 617.55, the lowest intraday level since July 13.  Cycle Ends  Citigroup Inc. “expects 2013 to be the year in which the
death bells ring for the commodity supercycle after its duly
noted sunset,” Ed Morse, Citigroup’s global head of commodities
research in New York, said in a report today. There will be more
“many more losers than winners” for commodities this quarter,
according to the report.  The International Energy Agency, the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries and the U.S. Energy Information
Administration cut their forecasts for 2013 global oil demand
this week. Consumption will rise by 795,000 barrels a day, or
0.9 percent, to average 90.58 million a day this year, the
Paris-based IEA said yesterday. That’s down 45,000 barrels a day
from its March forecast.  “IEA, OPEC and EIA demand forecasts were all cut this
week,” Armstrong said. “We are seeing a big increase in
bearish signals.”  Fuel Prices  Gasoline for May delivery fell 2.92 cents, or 1 percent, to
$2.8018 a gallon on the Nymex, the lowest settlement since Jan.
18. Total volume was 7.5 percent below the 100-day average.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel for May delivery declined 2.73
cents, or 0.9 percent, to end the session at $2.8718 a gallon in
New York. Volume was 34 percent above the 100-day average.  “The market is looking pretty apocalyptic,” said Stephen Schork, president of the Schork Group Inc. in Villanova,
Pennsylvania. “We’re seeing a massive selloff in oil and fuel
right now. Gasoline and diesel are very weak.”  Implied volatility for at-the-money WTI crude options
expiring in June was 20.9 percent, up from 19.3 percent
yesterday. The figure has slipped from 24.7 percent on Feb. 21.  Electronic trading volume on the Nymex was 800,371
contracts as of 4:27 p.m. It totaled 498,076 contracts
yesterday, 14 percent below the three-month average. Open
interest was a record 1.77 million contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
