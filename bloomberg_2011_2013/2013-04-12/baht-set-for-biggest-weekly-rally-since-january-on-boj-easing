Thailand’s baht was set for its
largest weekly advance since January and government bonds rose
as Japan’s unprecedented monetary easing spurred demand for
emerging-market debt.  The currency breached the 29 per dollar level for the first
time since 1997 and the benchmark 10-year yield dropped to a
five-month low this week. Global funds  bought  $810 million more
sovereign debt than they sold since the Bank of Japan on April 4
announced 7.5 trillion yen ($75 billion) of bond buying a month.
This year’s net purchases totaled $10 billion through yesterday,
compared with $31 billion for the whole of 2012, Thai Bond
Market Association data show.  “Thailand has seen quite a big impact from speculation of
more fund inflows due to the BOJ’s easing,” said Tohru
Nishihama, an economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute Inc.
in Tokyo. “The bond yields may also remain under pressure to
decline due to fund inflows from abroad.”  The baht climbed 0.9 percent from a week ago, the most
since the five-day period ended Jan. 18, to 29.07 per dollar as
of 8:21 a.m. in Bangkok, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The currency, which declined 0.1 percent today,
touched 28.88 on April 10, the strongest level since a
devaluation in July 1997 that sparked the Asian financial
crisis.  One-month implied volatility for the baht, a measure of
expected moves in the exchange rate used to price options, rose
two basis points this week, or 0.02 percentage point, to 5.26
percent. The rate was unchanged today.  The Finance Ministry is not considering new taxes to
discourage fund inflows, Somchai Sujjapongse, director general
of the Fiscal Policy Office, told reporters in Bangkok
yesterday, adding that the central bank has other measures to
manage the baht. Bank of Thailand Governor Prasarn
Trairatvorakul said on April 10 that the bank will closely
monitor the currency.  The yield on the 3.625 percent government bonds June 2023
fell six basis points from a week ago to 3.432 percent, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. It dropped to 3.43 percent
yesterday, the lowest since November.  To contact the reporter on this story:
