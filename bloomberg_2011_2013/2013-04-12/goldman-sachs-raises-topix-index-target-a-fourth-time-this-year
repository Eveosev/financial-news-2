Goldman Sachs Group Inc. boosted
its outlook on Japanese shares for the fourth time this year on
the Bank of  Japan ’s “credible commitment” to beat deflation.  Goldman Sachs raised its 12 month  Topix (TPX)  Index outlook to
1,350 from 1,250. The last time the brokerage raised its Topix
forecast was in March. Goldman Sachs also raised its 12 month
Nikkei 225 Stock Average estimate to to 16,000 from 15,000,
representing an increase of 18 percent from yesterday’s close.  “The new BOJ governor,  Haruhiko Kuroda , has stepped out
with a bang,” wrote Goldman Sachs strategists led by Kathy Matsui. “While many remain skeptical about the ability of the
BOJ to attain the 2 percent inflation target, we believe the
most critical point is that the BOJ now believes it can achieve
it and will do whatever it can to achieve it.”  The Topix surged 59 percent from mid-November through
yesterday as Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Kuroda pledged to
defeat 15 years of deflation. The gauge rose for  seven days  from
April 3, when the BOJ began a meeting that ended with an
announcement that the bank will double the monetary base by the
end of 2014 by buying  government bonds , its boldest round of
quantitative easing.  To contact the reporters on this story:
