Wheat advanced for a second day as
cold weather gripped the U.S., Canada and Russia, raising the
risk of damage to the winter crops and delaying planting of the
spring variety.  Wheat for delivery in July gained as much as 0.6 percent to
$7.0775 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade at 9:58 a.m.
Singapore time. The most-active contract was poised for a second
weekly gain.  Low temperatures in parts of the central and southern
plains in the U.S., Russia and Ukraine may hurt winter crops,
DTN said in a report yesterday. In the Canadian Prairies, winter
storms and cold weather has led to a deep snow pack in many
areas, raising the risk of flooding and slowing the start of
field work for spring planting, the forecaster said.  “The market will refocus on current crop concerns in North
America, parts of Europe and Southern Russia,” Luke Mathews, a
commodity strategist at Commonwealth Bank of Australia, wrote in
a report today.  Exporters in the U.S., the largest shipper, sold 360,000
metric tons of soft red winter wheat to China for delivery in
the 12 months that starts June 1, the U.S. Department of
Agriculture said yesterday, after reporting that  weekly sales  in
the five days ended April 4 advanced to 339,479 tons, from
315,984 tons a week earlier.  Corn for July delivery rose 0.2 percent to $6.345 a bushel,
set for a 2.7 percent gain this week. The most-active contract,
which switched from May-delivery to July this week, headed for a
0.9 percent gain.  Soybeans for July delivery were little changed at $13.6725
a bushel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
