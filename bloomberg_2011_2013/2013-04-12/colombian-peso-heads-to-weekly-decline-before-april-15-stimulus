Colombia’s peso posted the biggest
weekly drop in Latin America as the government prepares a
stimulus plan that Finance Minister Mauricio Cardenas has said
includes measures to weaken the currency.  The peso fell 0.4 percent to 1,826.10 per U.S. dollar this
week, the steepest drop among the six most-traded Latin American
currencies tracked by Bloomberg. It weakened 0.1  percent at the
close today Bogota. The currency has weakened 3.2 percent this
year after strengthening 9.7 percent in 2012.  President Juan Manuel Santos is scheduled to present a plan
on April 15 to boost the Andean nation’s industrial and
agricultural industries, including additional currency measures,
Cardenas said last week. Cardenas told lawmakers April 2 that he
expects the peso to weaken to 1,900 and wants to “get there
quickly.”  “Everything is rooted in what the government could do next
week,” said Daniel Escobar, head analyst at Global Securities
brokerage in Bogota. “They haven’t been specific about what
measures they could take, and the market has left the door open
for the announcements they could make.”  Yields on the government’s peso bonds maturing in 2024 rose
two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 5 percent today,
according to the central bank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
