Rupiah Banda, who ruled  Zambia  from
2008 to 2011, was granted a judicial review into the lifting of
his immunity from prosecution, his lawyer said.  High Court Judge Annie Sitali will hold an inquiry into the
removal of Banda’s immunity by parliament on March 15, Sakwiba
Sikota said by mobile phone today from Lusaka, the capital.
Sitali has not set a date and Banda’s criminal trial will
continue, Sikota said.  Banda, who is accused of abusing his authority in
connection with a Nigerian oil deal while he was in office,
denies wrongdoing. He says he is being persecuted by President
 Michael Sata ’s Patriotic Front government, which defeated him in
September 2011 national elections.  The judge “found that there was sufficient cause to go
into an inquiry on whether or not the process and procedures in
lifting Rupiah Banda’s immunity were done correctly or not,”
Sikota said.  Banda’s immunity was removed after 80 lawmakers voted in
favor and three against. Nearly half the members of parliament
were absent from the vote after opposition leaders walked out in
protest.  To contact the reporter on this story:
