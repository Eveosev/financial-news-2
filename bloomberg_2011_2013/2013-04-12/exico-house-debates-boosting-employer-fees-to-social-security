Mexico’s lower house will vote
“very soon” on a bill to change the social security system,
lawmaker Manlio Fabio Beltrones said, probably increasing costs
for businesses.  Inconsistencies in the current system have “harmed”
funding for the Mexican Social Security Institute, Beltrones of
the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party said yesterday in
Mexico City.  “There are companies that declare one thing to the tax
authorities and another to social security and social security
has ended up losing out for many years,” Beltrones told
reporters, according to a transcript e-mailed by the lower
house’s press office.  To contact the reporter on this story:
