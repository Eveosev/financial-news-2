(Corrects headline and lead to show  Topix (TPX)  finished week
higher.)  Most Japanese  shares  declined, with
the Topix Index capping its biggest weekly advance in more than
three years, as the nation’s currency traded near 100 yen to the
dollar for a fifth day.  Sony Corp., which gets nearly 70 percent of its revenue
from outside Japan, dropped 1.5 percent. Chiyoda Corp., an
industrial plant operator, tumbled the most on the Nikkei 225
Stock Average after Australia’s Woodside Petroleum Ltd. scrapped
a liquefied natural gas project Chiyoda had bid on. Sharp Corp.
jumped 7 percent after the Nikkei newspaper reported that its
banks will roll over loans. Nuclear power producers rose the
most on the Topix after SMBC Nikko Securities Inc. said there’s
increased likelihood operations may resume at some plants halted
after the March 2011 nuclear disaster.  Twice as many stocks fell as rose on the Topix, which
closed 0.1 percent higher in Tokyo. The measure gained 7.7
percent this week, its biggest weekly surge since December 2009.
The Nikkei 225 lost 0.5 percent to 13,485.14, with volume 45
percent greater than its 30-day average.  “These past few days, the yen looked like breaking through
to 100 yen to the dollar but just didn’t manage it,” said
Juichi Wako, a Tokyo-based senior strategist at Nomura
Securities Co., Japan’s biggest brokerage. “Once investors
start viewing the 100 yen wall as being quite thick, the stock
market will probably take a breather.”  7-Day Surge  The Topix has climbed 59 percent since mid-November as
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and central bank Governor Haruhiko
Kuroda pledged to defeat 15 years of deflation. The gauge traded
at 1.3 times  book value  compared with 2.4 for the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index and 1.6 for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The Topix has gained on each of the eight days since April
3, when the BOJ began a meeting that ended with the announcement
that it will double the monetary base by the end of 2014 by
buying government bonds, its boldest round of quantitative
easing.  The Topix’s 14-day Relative Strength Index is now at 75.5,
after rising on April 10 above 70, a threshold some traders view
as a signal the gauge is overbought. The Topix’s RSI last traded
above 70 on March 15, and the gauge fell 2.2 percent the
following trading day.  Electricity producers provided the biggest boost to the
Topix among the index’s 33 industry groups, as the sector jumped
after SMBC Nikko Securities analyst Hidetoshi Shioda said
there’s an increased likelihood for the resumption of nuclear
power plants that were shut following the March 2011 disaster at
a Tokyo Electric Power Co. facility.  Among shares that fell, Takata Corp., which makes safety-
gear, extended yesterday’s 9 percent plunge after Japan’s
biggest automakers recalled cars because of defective airbags
made by the company.  The Nikkei Stock Average Volatility Index declined 1.6
percent to 28.39 today, indicating traders expect a swing of
about 8.1 percent on the benchmark gauge over the next 30 days.  To contact the reporters on this story:
