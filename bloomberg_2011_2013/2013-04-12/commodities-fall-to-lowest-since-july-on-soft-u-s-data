Commodities tumbled to the lowest
since July, led by a plunge in precious metals, as U.S. retail
sales fell the most in nine months and consumer sentiment
unexpectedly declined.  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot Index of 24  raw materials 
dropped 1.3 percent to close at 623.11 at 3:42 p.m.  New York 
time. Earlier, the gauge touched 617.55, the lowest since July
13. Gold fell into a bear market, and silver plummeted to the
lowest since 2010. Crude oil slumped to a one-month low.  Retail sales  in March fell 0.4 percent, the most since
June, government data showed today. The median forecast of 85
economists surveyed by Bloomberg called for an unchanged
reading. An index that tracks  consumer confidence  dropped in
April to a nine-month low. Citigroup Inc., in a report today,
predicted 2013 would be the year that “the death bells ring”
for the commodity supercycle.  “The economic numbers in the U.S. are turning soft,”  John Kinsey , who helps manage about C$1 billion ($987.5 million) at
Caldwell Investment Management Ltd. in Toronto, said in a
telephone interview. “The last few numbers from the U.S.
haven’t been all that robust.”  The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan preliminary
index of consumer sentiment declined to 72.3 from 78.6 in March.
The April reading was lower than all 69 estimates in a Bloomberg
survey that called for no change. Consumers’ assessments of
their financial situation deteriorated.  Payrolls expanded by 88,000 in March, the smallest increase
since June, government data showed on April 5.  Equities Favored  Precious metals have slumped this year as investors favored
equities and the dollar. Cyprus may sell gold holdings to cover
possible losses from emergency loans.  On the Comex in New York, gold futures for June delivery
plunged 4.1 percent to $1,501.40 an ounce. The metal plunged 21
percent from a record settlement of $1,891.90 in August 2011,
entering a  bear market . After the settlement, the price touched
$1,480, the lowest for a most-active contract since July 1,
2011.  Silver futures for May delivery dropped 4.9 percent to
$26.331 an ounce on the Comex, the biggest decline since June
21. After the settlement, the price touched $25.855, the lowest
since Nov. 18, 2010.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , oil futures for May
delivery declined 2.4 percent to $91.29 a barrel. The price
earlier touched $90.27, the lowest since March 7.  Industrial Metals  On the London Metal Exchange, a  gauge  of copper, aluminum,
zinc, lead, nickel and tin fell 2.6 percent, the most in a year.  Zinc dropped for the ninth straight week, the longest slump
in at least two decades.  Data on April 15 may show that  China’s economy  expanded at
an 8 percent annual pace last quarter, slower than projected in
February, according to economists surveyed by  Bloomberg News .
The country is the top consumer of industrial metals.  Corn and soybeans gained on speculation that rain in the
U.S. and snow in  Canada  will delay planting. Wheat climbed as
cold weather threatens the winter crop in the southern Great
Plains.  “Agriculture commodities are primarily driven by
weather,” Bill Greiner, who oversees $14 billion as chief
investment officer at Mariner Wealth Advisors in  Kansas City ,
 Missouri , said in a telephone interview. “The metals seem to be
weakening on concerns about China, and the North Koreans flexing
their muscles aren’t helping.”  The U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency has reported that
 North Korea  now has some nuclear weapons small enough to be
delivered by its ballistic missiles.  To contact the reporter on this story:
