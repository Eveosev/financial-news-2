Barrick Gold Corp. (ABX) , the biggest
producer by sales, headed for its biggest weekly decline in four
years after gold prices reached a 21-month low and the company
halted construction on the Chilean side of an $8.5 billion
project in the Andes.  Barrick, based in Toronto, has  fallen  15 percent since
April 5, the biggest five-day drop since April 8, 2009. The
stock decreased 5.9 percent to C$23.53 at 11:33 a.m. in Toronto.  Gold futures in  New York  fell to the lowest since July 2011
on signs investors are favoring the dollar and equities as the
global economy recovers. The price dropped 4 percent to $1,503
an ounce at 11:11 a.m. on the Comex, after earlier falling to as
low as $1,491.40.  Barrick said April 10 it was stopping construction on the
Chilean side of the Pascua-Lama project after a Chilean court
accepted an injunction filed by indigenous communities concerned
about water supplies.  The project may have a 12-month delay in first production
to early 2016,  Greg Barnes , a Toronto-based analyst at TD
Securities Inc., wrote in a note yesterday. He cut his rating to
hold from buy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
