     April 12 (Bloomberg) --The U.S. Treasury Department
released a survey today ahead of its next quarterly refunding
announcement asking dealers for “sources and drivers” of
foreign demand for government securities in the year ahead.  The survey also asked dealers if the current auction
calendar is well suited to meeting the Treasury’s financing
needs and requested comments on how the hedging of interest-rate
products may affect the Treasury market should “the general
level of interest rates rise.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
