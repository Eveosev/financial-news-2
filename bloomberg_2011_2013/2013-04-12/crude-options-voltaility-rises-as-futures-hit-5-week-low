Crude oil options volatility rose
for a second day as the underlying futures fell to the least in
five weeks on economic data signaling lower fuel demand.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
June, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 20.81 percent at 4:05 p.m. on the  New
York Mercantile Exchange , up from 19.33 percent yesterday.  West Texas Intermediate crude for June delivery declined
$2.24 to settle at $91.61 a barrel, the lowest level since March
6. The futures dropped as much as 3.4 percent earlier after
Commerce Department figures showed that  retail sales  slipped 0.4
percent last month and a gauge of U.S. consumer sentiment
slumped to a nine-month low.  The most-active options in electronic trading today were
May $90 puts, which gained 41 cents to 53 cents a barrel on
volume of 9,021 contracts at 4 p.m. June $70 puts were the
second-most active, rising 1 cent to 3 cents a barrel. Contracts
traded totaled 7,434.  Puts accounted for 63 percent of electronic trading volume
today. Calls made up 51 percent of yesterdayâ€™s volume of 107,645
contracts.  May $90 puts were the most active options traded in the
previous session, with 4,807 contracts changing hands. They
increased 5 cent to 12 cents a barrel. June $90 puts rose 23
cents to 94 cents a barrel on 4,757 lots.  Open interest was highest for May $85 puts with 38,518
contracts. Next were June $80 puts with 38,069 and December $105
calls at 36,564.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on open-
outcry volume, where the bulk of options activity occurs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
