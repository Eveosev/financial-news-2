Taiwan’s government bonds notched
up their first weekly advance in six as overseas investors cut
holdings of local stocks on concern the island’s economic
recovery will slow. The local dollar weakened.  Global funds sold about $540 million more Taiwanese stocks
than they bought this week, exchange data show. Exports gained
3.3 percent in March from a year earlier after a 15.8 percent
slump the previous month, the government reported this week. A
21 percent tumble in the yen against the  U.S. dollar  in the past
six months may have hurt the global competitiveness of Taiwanese
electronics companies against their Japanese rivals.  “Concern over the economy remains,” said  James Wang , a
fixed-income trader at Yuanta Securities Co. in Taipei. “Moves
are mainly driven by short-sellers buying back bonds.” Short
sellers borrow shares to sell in the hope they can buy them back
at lower prices.  The yield on the 0.875 percent notes due January 2018
dropped three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 0.975
percent this week, according to Gretai Securities Market. It
slipped 1.5 basis points today.  The Taiwan dollar weakened 0.2 percent to NT$29.995 against
its U.S. counterpart this week, Taipei Forex Inc. prices show.
The currency was little changed today and was trading 0.1
percent stronger one minute before the 4 p.m. close. The central
bank has sold the local dollar in the run-up to the close on
most days in the past year, according to traders who asked not
to be identified.  Forwards, Volatility  One-month non-deliverable forwards were little changed at
NT$29.935 this week, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The
contracts fell 0.1 percent today and touched NT$30.10 on April
9, the lowest level since July 27.  One-month implied volatility in the  Taiwan dollar , a gauge
of expected moves in the  exchange rate  used to price options,
rose 27 basis points this week to 3.93 percent and fell three
basis points today, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The  overnight interbank lending  rate was little changed at
0.386 percent, according to a weighted average compiled by the
Taiwan Interbank Money Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
