U.S. stock futures extended losses,
signaling benchmark indexes will retreat from record highs,
after government data showed retail sales unexpectedly dropped
last month by the most in nine months.  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index futures expiring in June
retreated 0.5 percent to 1,580 at 8:33 a.m. in  New York .
Contracts on the  Dow Jones Industrial Average  fell 60 points, or
0.4 percent, to 14,736. The benchmark indexes closed at all-time
highs yesterday as jobless claims fell more than estimated.  The 0.4 percent decrease in retail sales, the biggest since
June, followed a 1 percent gain in February, Commerce Department
figures showed today in  Washington . The median forecast of 85
economists surveyed by Bloomberg called for an unchanged reading
in March. Department stores and electronics dealers were among
the weakest showings.  In a separate survey, economists forecast the Thomson
Reuters/University of Michigan gauge of consumer sentiment was
little changed in April from the prior month, at 78.5. March’s
reading of 78.6 was the highest since November.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
