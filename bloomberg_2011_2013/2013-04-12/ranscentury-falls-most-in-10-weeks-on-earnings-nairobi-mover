TransCentury Ltd. (TCL) , a Kenyan
investor in infrastructure projects, fell the most in six months
after full-year earnings missed some analysts’ forecasts.  The stock retreated as much as 7.5 percent and closed 5.4
percent lower at 34.75 shillings in Nairobi, the capital, the
largest decline since Oct. 16. The volume of shares traded was
about 36 percent of the three-month daily average.  Net income in the 12 months through December rose to 740.6
million shillings ($8.8 million) from 616.1 million shillings a
year earlier. Sales grew 26 percent to 13.5 billion shillings,
the company said yesterday. The amount of tax paid increased to
490.4 million shillings from 253.2 million shillings.  “They paid a lot of tax so net profit was a little bit
softer than what the market expected,” Davis Mika, an analyst
at Nairobi-based Contrarian Investing Kenya Ltd., said by phone.
Mika estimated 2012 net income of 750 million shillings.  In the year to date TransCentury has surged 48 percent
while the All-Share Index has gained 29 percent in that period,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
