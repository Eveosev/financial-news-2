Spot gasoline in  New York  Harbor
weakened against futures, falling from a  two-week high , as
boosts in motor fuel imports and refinery activity added to area
 inventories .  Stockpiles of gasoline in the central Atlantic region
including New York, or PADD 1B, increased  808,000 barrels  to 33
million in the week ended April 5, Energy Information
Administration data show. East Coast imports rose to the  highest
level  since August, while refineries boosted utilization rates
to  88.3 percent , the EIA said April 10.  The discount for reformulated, 84-octane gasoline, or RBOB,
in New York Harbor slipped 0.5 cent to 19.75 cents a gallon
below futures on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 12:03 p.m.,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Ultra-low-sulfur diesel
shrank 0.88 cent to a 1.25-cent premium.  “Gasoline looks bad,” Tom Finlon, a director of Energy
Analytics Group LLC, said by phone from Jupiter,  Florida . “A
surprisingly large increase in imports and a disproportionately
higher increase in refinery utilization fed the build and
conspires to weaken gasoline on the East Coast.”  The 3-2-1 crack spread in New York, a rough measure of
refining margins based on Brent oil in  Europe , gained 32 cents
to $11.25 a barrel, a second consecutive daily advance.  Motor fuel shipments to the East gained 313,000 barrels to
 804,000 barrels  last week, the highest level since Aug. 31, EIA
data compiled by Bloomberg show. Gasoline cargoes booked on
tankers for shipment to the U.S. were expected to expand to 34
in the two weeks to April 16, compared with 20 in the previous
period, according to a Bloomberg survey.  Philadelphia Refinery  East Coast refineries processed  1.14 million barrels  of
crude and other feedstock last week, 0.5 percent more than the
seven days prior, according to the EIA, the statistical arm of
the Energy Department.  The increase may be a result of restarted units at
Philadelphia Energy Solutions’  Philadelphia refinery , said
Finlon. “Those inventories are starting to show up,” he said.  The plant was restarting units in its Girard Point section
after maintenance that began in January. The 355,000-barrel-a-
day refinery is the largest complex on the U.S. East Coast and
moves gasoline and distillate into New York Harbor, the delivery
point for contracts traded on Nymex.  To contact the reporter on this story:
