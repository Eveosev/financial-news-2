Xstrata Plc (XTA)  was said to sell a
year’s supply of thermal coal to  Tohoku Electric Power Co Inc. (9506) 
at the lowest settlement price since 2009.  The miner will supply the fuel starting this month at $95 a
metric ton, said two people with knowledge of the deal who asked
not to be identified because the information is confidential.
That’s down from its April 2012 settlement of $115 and the
lowest since deals at $70 to $72 in 2009. The price Japanese
utilities agree with Xstrata is typically used as a benchmark
for contracts around the region.  Tohoku has agreed to a deal with the producer, Hiroki
Enami, a Sendai-based spokesman for the Japanese utility, said
by phone, declining to give a price for the accord. Francis De Rosa, a Sydney-based spokesman for Xstrata, declined to comment
on contract negotiations.  The settlement is the first below $100 a ton since 2010 and
lower than the median estimate of $98 in a Bloomberg News
survey.  Japan ’s coal-import growth is projected to drop 2
percent this year,  Australia ’s Bureau of Resources and Energy
Economics said in a March report. Prices at the port of
Newcastle have declined the past four weeks to the lowest since
November, data from IHS McCloskey show.  Power producers agreed to pay a record $129.75 in 2011 as
flooding curbed output in Australia and  Indonesia , the world’s
biggest exporter. Contracts were settled at $98 in 2010.  To contact the reporters on this story:
