A gauge of U.S. corporate credit
risk rose for the first time in seven days as data showed retail
sales unexpectedly dropped in March by the most in nine months.  The Markit CDX North American Investment Grade Index, a
credit-default swaps benchmark that investors use to hedge
against losses or to speculate on creditworthiness, climbed 1.1
basis points to a mid-price of 82.7 basis points at 8:46 a.m. in
 New York , according to prices compiled by Bloomberg. The measure
rose from the lowest since March 18.  The 0.4 percent decline in retail sales is the biggest
since June and follows a 1 percent gain in February, Commerce
Department figures showed today in  Washington . The median
forecast of 85 economists  surveyed  by Bloomberg called for an
unchanged reading in March. Signs that the  U.S. economy  is
struggling to recover may increase investor concern that
companies will have trouble repaying debt.  The index typically rises as investor confidence
deteriorates and falls as it improves. The contracts pay the
buyer face value if a borrower fails to meet its obligations,
less the value of the defaulted debt. A basis point equals
$1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10 million of debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
