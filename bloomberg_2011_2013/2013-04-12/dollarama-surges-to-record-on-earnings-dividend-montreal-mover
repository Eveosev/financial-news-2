Dollarama Inc. (DOL) , the biggest dollar-
store chain operator in  Canada , soared to an record high after
posting fourth-quarter sales and profit that topped estimates
and boosting its dividend.  Dollarama, based in  Montreal , rose 4.6 percent to C$67.59
at 11:30 a.m. in Toronto, the highest since its initial public
offering in October 2009. Earlier it jumped as much as 4.1
percent. The shares have  gained  9.6 percent in the year through
yesterday for a market value of C$4.97 billion ($4.9 billion),
compared with a 1 percent loss for the Standard & Poor’s
TSX/Composite index.  “No other Canadian retailer offers similar consistent
growth and visibility in the current challenging retail
environment,” Irene Nattel, consumer analyst at  RBC Capital
Markets , a unit of Royal Bank of Canada, said in a note today.
Nattel, who has C$76 price target on the stock, said she is
confident the company can continue to deliver 15 percent to 25
percent organic earning-per-share growth.  The retailer, which operates 785 stores across Canada,
reported adjusted fourth-quarter  earnings  of C$1.06 a share,
compared with analysts’ average estimates of C$1.02 according to
a survey of 10 analysts by Bloomberg. Sales in the quarter of
C$561.9 million also topped estimates of C$550 million.  Dollarama raised its quarterly  dividend  27 percent to 14
Canadian cents a share, from 11 cents, to be paid on May 7.  For fiscal 2013, Dollarama posted same-store sales growth
of 6.5 percent, compared with 5.4 percent growth a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
