Customers of David Lerner
Associates Inc. are appealing the dismissal of a lawsuit
alleging the brokerage misled investors about $6.8 billion in
real estate investment trust holdings.  Lawyers for plaintiffs seeking to represent all investors
in certain so-called Apple REITs filed a notice today in federal
court in  Brooklyn , New York, stating they will appeal the
decision.  Earlier this month, U.S. District Judge Kiyo A. Matsumoto
ruled that the investors couldn’t establish they had suffered a
loss because their holdings were still performing, even though
values had dropped. The plaintiffs claimed the brokerage, known
for its founder’s “Take a tip from Poppy” slogan,
misrepresented the holdings as appropriate for retirees and
other retail investors.  The Syosset, New York-based firm has collected more than
$600 million in fees and commissions for five Apple REITs, which
invest primarily in hotels and other income-producing
properties.  A spokesman for David Lerner Associates, David Chauvin of
Zimmerman/Edelson Inc., said in a phone interview that the
brokerage “believes that the district court correctly dismissed
the plaintiffs’ complaint with prejudice” and is confident the
U.S. Court of Appeals in  Manhattan  will affirm the dismissal.  The case is In re Apple REITs Litigation, 1:11-cv-02919,
U.S. District Court, Eastern District of New York (Brooklyn).  To contact the reporter on this story:
