Cooking oil  imports  by  India , the
world’s second-largest buyer, climbed for the fourth straight
month because of rising consumption and declining global prices,
keeping reserves at a record.  Purchases of vegetable oils, including for industrial use,
advanced 23 percent to 896,714 metric tons in March from 727,706
tons a year earlier, the  Solvent Extractors’ Association of
India  said in an e-mailed statement today. Crude palm oil
imports almost doubled, it said.  India’s imports, which beat a median estimate of 850,000
tons in a Bloomberg survey of five processors and brokers, may
trim stockpiles in Indonesia and Malaysia, the largest palm oil
producers. Prices in  Kuala Lumpur  plunged 34 percent in the past
year on concern demand will decline. Global palm reserves will
climb to a record 7.385 million tons this season, according to
the  U.S. Department of Agriculture .  “India will need an extra 800,000 tons of edible oil every
year to meet the needs of a growing population,” B.V. Mehta,
executive director of the association, said by phone. “The
current line up indicates that the pace of imports we have seen
so far will continue in the coming months. Global prices are
cheaper than a year-ago levels, promoting imports.”  Palm for delivery in May traded at 2,344 ringgit ($772) a
ton on the Malaysia Derivatives Exchange at 4:56 p.m. in Kuala
Lumpur. Futures dropped last month capping four straight
quarters of declines in the worst run since 1999.  Palm Imports  Crude palm oil imports  reached 558,810 tons in March from
278,696 tons a year ago, while refined purchases fell 26 percent
to 137,407 tons, the association said. Soybean oil  imports 
slumped 53 percent to 46,990 tons, while sunflower oil fell 13
percent to 90,655 tons, it said. India buys palm from Indonesia
and  Malaysia , and soyoil from Brazil and  Argentina .  India’s cooking oil stockpiles, including those at ports
and in the pipeline, reached 2.1 million tons as of April 1 from
1.45 million tons a year ago, association data showed. The
reserves will meet 45 days of consumption against the normal
level of 30 days, Mehta said.  India’s monthly demand, which is about 1.45 million tons,
is growing at 5 percent annually, said Sandeep Bajoria, chief
executive officer at Mumbai-based broker Sunvin Group. Imports
of all cooking oils may surge to a record 11.5 million tons in
the year that started Nov. 1 from 10.2 million tons a year
earlier, Vijay Data, president of the extractors’ association,
said on Feb. 4.  Purchases in the five months to March rose 22 percent to
4.63 million tons from 3.79 million tons a year earlier,
association data showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
