The Asian Development Bank agreed
to loan $200 million to Dynagreen Environmental Protection Group
for waste-to-energy plants in China.  Dynagreen, the environmental infrastructure arm of Beijing
State-Owned Assets Management Co., will use the loans to build
at least nine plants in small and medium-sized cities in China
to turn solid waste into electricity, the bank said today in a
 statement  on its website.  The projects will generate about 610 gigawatt-hours of
electricity annually by 2018.  To contact the reporter on this story:
