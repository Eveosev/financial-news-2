Peru ’s sol posted its steepest
weekly decline in a month as the central bank boosted dollar
purchases to offset rising inflows into the country.  The sol depreciated 0.2 percent since April 5 to 2.5870 per
dollar, the steepest decline since the five days ended March 1,
according to prices from Datatec. The currency dropped 0.2
percent today.  The central bank bought $550 million this week to ease sol
gains, extending its purchases in 2013 to $5 billion. The
currency appreciated 0.3 percent last week on speculation
monetary easing in the U.S. and  Japan  designed to shore up
economic growth will spur investors to buy higher-yielding
assets in developing markets.  “The rally could have continued, but the central bank’s
intervention became much stronger,” said  Mario Guerrero , an
economist at Scotiabank Peru SAA.  The yield on Peru’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol bond due in
August 2020 fell one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to
3.73 percent at 3:19 p.m. in  Lima , according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The price climbed 0.05 centimo to 125.96 centimos per
sol.  To contact the reporter on this story:
