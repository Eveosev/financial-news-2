Serbia’s current-account deficit
narrowed 32 percent in January as the Balkan nation’s exports
and foreign investment increased.  The deficit of 176.1 million euros ($230 million) compared
with a shortfall of 259 million euros a year earlier, according
to a report published by the Belgrade-based Narodna Banka Srbije
today. The  trade gap  fell 17.1 percent after exports grew 20.9
percent and imports rose 4 percent from a year earlier.  Serbia also attracted 77.7 million euros in net foreign
direct investment and 106.3 million euros in net portfolio
investment, mainly in  government bonds . Full-year net foreign
direct investment amounted to 232 million euros in 2012.  Last year’s current-account deficit stood at 3.15 billion
euros, or 10.7 percent of gross domestic product. The central
bank sees the gap shrinking to below 8 percent of GDP in 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
