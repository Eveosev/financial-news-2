 Hungary’s bonds headed for a third
week of gains on speculation the central bank will extend eight
months of rate cuts beyond a record low after inflation slumped
to a 39-year low.  Basic price indicators monitored by monetary policy makers
came in at 1.7 percent in March, the Magyar Nemzeti Bank said on
its  website  today. The headline consumer price index rose 2.2
percent in March, the least since 1974, the statistics office
said yesterday. Yields on 10-year bonds slipped seven basis
points, or 0.07 percentage point, to an eight-year low of 5.72
percent at 11:12 a.m. in Budapest, extending the decline in the
past three weeks to 86 basis points.  The Magyar Nemzeti Bank, which cut rates to 5 percent last
month, may continue easing if price pressures remain moderate
and markets stabilize, minutes of the March meeting showed this
week. Policy makers will probably cut rates to “well below”
4.5 percent this year, Mihaly Patai, the chairman of the
Hungarian Banking Association, who held talks with central bank
officials this week, said in an interview with MR1 radio.  Traders are pricing in “massive” easing, with the  base
rate  seen falling as low as 3.75 percent in 2013, Levente Blaho
and Adam Keszeg, Budapest-based analysts at Raiffeisen Bank
International AG, wrote in a research report today.  Nine-month forward-rate agreements, derivatives used to
wager on  interest rates , traded at 3.73 percent, within five
basis points of a record low. The FRAs traded 115 basis points
below the Budapest Interbank Offered Rate.  The forint weakened less than 0.1 percent to 296.56 against
the euro, paring this month’s gain to 2.6 percent, still the
best performance among the 31 major currencies tracked by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
