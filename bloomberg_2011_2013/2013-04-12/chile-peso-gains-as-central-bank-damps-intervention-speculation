Chile’s peso rose for the first
time in four days after the central bank made no changes to its
statement regarding the currency’s gains, damping speculation
that policy makers will intervene.  The currency climbed 0.2 percent to 468.44 per U.S. dollar
at 9:56 a.m. in Santiago after closing on April 8 at 467.05, the
strongest level since September 2011. The peso has advanced 0.1
percent this week.  The central bank reiterated yesterday in its statement that
the peso has appreciated in multilateral terms and held its
target lending rate at 5 percent for a 15th straight month.  The absence of a more explicit signal of concern by the
central bank may imply that the currency “has slightly more
room to appreciate” in inflation-adjusted terms, Juan Pablo Castro, an analyst at Banco Santander SA, said in an e-mailed
research note.  The central bank last intervened in January 2011, when it
announced plans to buy $12 billion in daily allotments of $50
million. The peso was trading at 465.75 when the monetary
authority announced the intervention, which continued through
December of that year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
