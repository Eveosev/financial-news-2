Portugal’s government bonds rose
after Austrian Finance Minister Maria Fekter said euro-region
finance ministers have agreed to a seven-year extension for
loans to the nation.  The  10-year bond yield  fell four basis points, or 0.04
percentage point, to 6.32 percent at 1:12 p.m. London time.  Ireland’s 10-year bonds were little changed, leaving the
yield on the security at 3.90 percent, after its loans were also
extended by the euro-region finance ministers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
