Options traders who bet  Infosys
Ltd. (INFO) ’s sales outlook would surprise investors  tripled  their
money today as the stock tumbled the most in a decade.  Traders who bought out-of-the money puts and calls on
Infosys yesterday, a wager known as a strangle that benefits
when volatility increases,  earned  217 percent as of 1:28 p.m. in
 Mumbai , based on the most-traded contracts. A similar strategy
called a straddle returned 107 percent, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. Infosys shares tumbled 20 percent to 2,346.5
rupees, set for the biggest drop since April 2003, after the
company’s annual sales forecast trailed analysts estimates.  The windfall shows few traders  anticipated  Infosys would
swing so much. The shares moved an average 11 percent the
previous two times Infosys reported results. The Bangalore-based
company,  India ’s second-largest software maker, said annual
sales may rise as little as 6 percent in the year ending March
2014, versus the 12.7 percent average estimate of analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg.  “Obviously no one could predict such a move” in Infosys
shares, Manoj Murlidharan, vice president at Mumbai-based  India
Infoline Ltd. (IIFL) , said in a phone interview today. “But those who
got on the right side of the trade made a lot of money. The
bearish squeeze will keep Infosys stock under pressure.”  Strangle Payout  Today’s share move was more than double what the options
market was expecting as of yesterday, based on prices paid for
April contracts with a strike price closest to yesterday’s
closing share price.  Infosys closed yesterday at 2,916.7 rupees. At the same
time, the price of the 2,900 straddle, which combines a put and
a call at that strike price, was 270 rupees. That indicates
traders expected a move of about that amount, or 9 percent, in
order to break even on the position.  A strangle combining 3,100 calls, yesterday’s most-traded
call contract, with 2,700 puts, cost 112.95 rupees yesterday,
based on closing prices. The combination was valued at 357.6
today.  Volumes in Infosys’ put options jumped to 232,845 contracts
today from 125,421 contracts yesterday. Put trading exceeded
calls for the first time in a month. Puts give the right to sell
a security for a certain amount, called the strike price, by a
given date. Calls convey the right to buy.  To contact the reporters on this story:
