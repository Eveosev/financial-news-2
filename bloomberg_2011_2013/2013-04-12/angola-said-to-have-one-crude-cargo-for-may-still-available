One Angolan crude cargo for loading
in May, out of 60 consignments in total, hasn’t been sold, four
traders who participate in the market said.  That’s a bigger proportion of sold cargoes than normal for
this stage of the month, said the people, who asked not to be
identified because the information is confidential. The unsold
lot is a 985,000-barrel cargo of Palanca grade for loading May
28 to May 29, they said.  Six March lots were still available as of Feb. 1, five
traders said at the time, while five February cargoes hadn’t
been sold as of Jan. 9.  Angola  plans to export 60 cargoes totaling 1.86 million
barrels a day of crude in May, the most since October 2009,
according to a final shipping schedule obtained by Bloomberg
News on March 26. That compares with 1.76 million barrels a day
in April, according to a separate schedule. Angola loaded 1.91
million barrels in October 2009.  Benchmark Cabinda grade was today 53 cents a barrel more
than Dated Brent, the North Sea benchmark used to price more
than half of the world’s oil, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It climbed to a seven-month high of a 72-cent premium
on March 25.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  The June schedule for Angola is due to be released next
week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
