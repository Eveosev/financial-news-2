(Corrects first paragraph to indicate a U.S. unit)  The U.S. unit of  Canada ’s  Valeant
Pharmaceuticals International Inc (VRX)  is the only potential bidder
for Galenika AD, the Balkan country’s state-owned drug maker,
the government said.  Valeant Pharmaceuticals North America Llc is the only one
of five companies to meet all the criteria set in a tender
launched on Jan. 15, the Finance and Economy Ministry said on
its website today. Four other companies expressing interest
include Supply Chain Strategies International Llc, U.S.-based MP
Biomedicals, the Batterjee Pharmaceutical Factory from  Saudi
Arabia  and Croatia’s Belupo DD, it said.  Valeant has until April 30 to indicate its intentions and
proposals for Galenika, the unprofitable state-owned drugmaker
that reported a 13.5 billion-dinar ($157.8 million) net loss in
2011. Galenika has around 170 million euros ($222.2 million) in
accumulated losses, Finance Minister  Mladjan Dinkic  said on Dec.
14.  Serbia extended the tender for Galenika twice, awaiting
proposals from international companies active in the industry
for at least five years and with operating revenue of more than
200 million euros ($256 million) in 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
