Verizon Wireless (VZ) , the largest U.S.
wireless carrier, is extending its waiting period for phone
upgrade discounts to boost profits.  Beginning in January, customers will have to wait 24 months
instead of 20 months to get a cheaper price for a new device,
Basking Ridge, New Jersey-based  Verizon Wireless  said in a
 statement  yesterday. The move aligns new phone discounts with
the expiration of two-year service contracts. the company said.  Reducing the frequency of discounts means that Verizon can
squeeze out four more months of subscription fees from every
customer before having to offer a subsidy. Verizon Wireless pays
an average of about $350 per phone to attract or retain
customers, offering devices such as the iPhone for $199 with a
two-year contract, said Kevin Smithen, an analyst with Macquarie
Securities USA Inc. in  New York .  “If there are fewer upgrades, it will boost margins,”
said Smithen.  Verizon Wireless’s profit  margin  for mobile-phone service
shrank to 41.4 percent in the fourth quarter from 42.2 percent a
year earlier, a trend the company attributed to costs for
smartphone discounts.  Last year,  AT&T Inc. (T) , the second-largest U.S. wireless
carrier, lengthened its upgrade eligibility period to 20 months
and also doubled its fee for the service to $36. The move
lowered the Dallas-based company’s subsidy costs and
strengthened profits.  Mark Siegel , an AT&T spokesman, declined to comment on
whether the company would follow Verizon’s extension.  To contact the reporter on this story:
