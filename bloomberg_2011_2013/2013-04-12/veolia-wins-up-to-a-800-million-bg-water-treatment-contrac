Veolia Environnement SA (VIE) , Europe’s
biggest water company, won a water treatment contract worth as
much as A$800 million ($844 million) for  BG Group Plc (BG/) ’s
Queensland Curtis liquefied natural gas project in Australia.  QGC Pty, a coal seam gas exploration unit of BG Group, said
today in a e-mailed  statement  it awarded Veolia Water Australia
Pty a 20-year contract to operate and maintain two treatment
plants at the site and a third plant at QGC’s Windibri site in
Queensland.  Brisbane-based QGC said the deal showed it was making
progress on infrastructure for its Queensland LNG project, which
it expects will be the world’s first to turn coal seam gas into
LNG. The company said in the statement it is on schedule to
produce LNG at the site from 2014.  “This is QGC’s biggest operational contract to date,”
Operations Director Walter Simpson said in the statement. Last
month QGC gave a $620 million contract to GE Oil & Gas  Australia 
Pty to maintain turbines and equipment at the site, the  company 
said on its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
