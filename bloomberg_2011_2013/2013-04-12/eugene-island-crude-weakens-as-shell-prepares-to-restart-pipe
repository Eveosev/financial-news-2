Crude from the Eugene Island
formation in the Gulf of Mexico weakened after a  Royal Dutch
Shell Plc (RDSA)  said it expects to restart a pipeline that had been
shutting in production of 38,000 barrels a day.  Shell is planning normal operations “in the coming days”
for a 16-inch pipeline that carried crude from Caillou Island to
Houma,  Louisiana , Kim Windon, a Houston-based spokeswoman for
the company, said in an e-mail. The pipeline is part of Shell’s
Eugene Island system, and connects platforms in the Gulf to the
mainland.  Shell shut the line March 25 after detecting a sheen in
water near it. After conducting tests, it confirmed the leak was
not related to the pipeline’s operations, Windon said.  Crude from the  Eugene Island formation  weakened by $2.10 to
a premium of $10.90 a barrel above the U.S. benchmark in
Cushing,  Oklahoma , at 1:39 p.m. East Coast time, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The premium is the lowest since July
3.  Mars Blend, a medium-sour crude from the Gulf, strengthened
by 45 cents to a premium of $8.75 a barrel to WTI. Crude from
the Poseidon formation gained 30 cents to $8.40 a barrel more
than the U.S. benchmark.  Southern Green Canyon crude weakened 35 cents to $7.40 more
than WTI while Thunder Horse lost 85 cents to a premium of
$10.90 a barrel.  Light Louisiana Sweet, the benchmark for light, sweet
crudes on the Gulf Coast, increased 15 cents to $14.05 a barrel
more than WTI. Heavy Louisiana Sweet narrowed 15 cents to $13.95
above WTI.  To contact the reporter on this story:
