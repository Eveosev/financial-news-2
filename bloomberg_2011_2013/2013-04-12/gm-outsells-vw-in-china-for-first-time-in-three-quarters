General Motors Co. (GM)  outsold
 Volkswagen AG (VOW)  in China for the first time in three quarters,
helped by growth in demand for Buick vehicles.  Volkswagen, which unlike GM includes Hong Kong and Macau in
its China figures, today reported first-quarter sales in China
climbed 21 percent to about 770,000 vehicles. That’s 5.7 percent
fewer than the deliveries reported by GM last week.  The results give Detroit-based GM a head start as it seeks
to keep its lead -- on an annual basis -- among foreign
automakers in China for a ninth straight year. Both companies
count China as their biggest market, which is forecast to top 20
million units for the first time this year.  While Volkswagen’s growth for the quarter outpaced the
overall Chinese passenger-vehicle market, the group’s 11 percent
expansion in March was slower than the industry growth reported
by the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers yesterday.  Volkswagen recalled almost 400,000 vehicles in China last
month to replace defective gearboxes that could result in loss
of power. While the automaker declined to disclose how much that
would cost them, research firm LMC Automotive estimates
replacements could cost between 3,000  yuan  ($485) to 10,000 yuan
per vehicle, which could total over $600 million.  Ford Motor Co. (F)  saw the fastest growth among major foreign
automakers, seeing its deliveries surging 54 percent to more
than 186,000 vehicles. That indicates Ford outsold  Toyota Motor
Corp. (7203)  in China for the first time, based on quarterly company
figures stretching back to 2011.  Toyota, Nissan Motor Co. and  Honda Motor Co. (7267)  all saw
declines in the quarter as they struggled to fully recover from
the anti-Japan protests that flared last September.  South Korea’s  Hyundai Motor Co. (005380)  last week reported China
sales rose 41 percent to a record 260,716 units.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
