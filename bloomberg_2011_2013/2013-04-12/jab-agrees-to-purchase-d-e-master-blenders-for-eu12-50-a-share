Joh. A. Benckiser, the investment
arm of the billionaire Reimann family, agreed to buy D.E Master
Blenders 1753 NV for 12.50 euros a share, less than the price
originally disclosed by the parties last month.  The offer values the maker of Senseo coffee at about 7.5
billion euros ($9.8 billion), the companies said in a statement
today. Amsterdam-based Master Blenders was spun off from Sara
Lee Corp. last year. The board fully supports the offer, it said
in the statement.  The acquisition adds to JAB’s coffee holdings after the
company, that former  Reckitt Benckiser Group Plc (RB/)  Chief Executive
Officer Bart Becht helps run, agreed to buy U.S.-based coffee
chains Peet’s Coffee & Tea Inc. and Caribou Coffee Co. for more
than $1 billion in total last year.  JAB and Master Blenders announced on March 28 that they
were in discussions that could lead to a deal at 12.75 euros a
share, triggering a 25 percent increase in Master Blenders’
share price that day.  For Related News and Information:  To contact the reporter on this story:
