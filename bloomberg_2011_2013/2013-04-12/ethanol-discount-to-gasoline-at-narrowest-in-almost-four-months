Ethanol strengthened against
gasoline for a fourth day, narrowing the discount to the least
in almost three months, on speculation that demand for the
biofuel is outstripping supply.  The spread, or price difference, narrowed 0.32 cent to
37.98 cents a gallon based on settlement prices, the tightest
since Jan. 16. Stockpiles of the fuel last week were 18 percent
lower than a year ago and at the all-time seasonal lows in
records going back to June 2010, data from the Energy
Information Administration show.  “From what we’re seeing and hearing from traders and
buyers, the market supply still looks pretty tight and demand is
pretty good,” said Beatriz Pupo, an analyst at Kingsman SA, a
Lausanne, Switzerland-based sugar and biofuels research firm.
“There’s tightness in the major hubs.”  Denatured ethanol for May delivery  fell 2.6 cents, or 1.1
percent, to $2.422 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Prices have gained 11 percent this year.  Gasoline for May delivery slid 2.92 cents, or 1 percent, to
$2.8018 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . The
contract covers reformulated gasoline, made to be blended with
ethanol before delivery to filling stations.  Ethanol supply along the East Coast fell 2.1 percent to
6.03 million barrels last week, down 32 percent from a year
earlier, according to an April 10 report from the EIA, the
Energy Department’s statistical unit.  Rising Production  Production of the fuel jumped 5.8 percent to 854,000
barrels a day, the biggest weekly gain since December 2010 and
the highest level since June 29, the EIA report showed. That’s
still 4.7 percent lower than a year earlier and  below average 
for this time of year, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Record corn prices caused by drought in the Midwest raised
costs to produce the fuel and prompted some companies to idle
output or shut operations.  Returns to make the biofuel have been improved by rising
estimates of corn stockpiles. The Agriculture Department
forecast this week that inventories on Aug. 31 will be 757
million bushels, up from 632 million forecast in March.  Corn for May delivery rose 7.25 cents, or 1.1 percent, to
$6.585 a bushel in  Chicago . One bushel makes at least 2.75
gallons of ethanol.  The corn crush spread, representing gains or losses from
turning corn into ethanol and based on May contracts, was 3
cents a gallon, down from 8 cents yesterday and up from minus 35
cents at the end of 2012. The amount doesn’t include revenue
from the sale of dried distillers’ grains, a byproduct of
ethanol production, which can be fed to livestock.  Cash Market  In cash market trading, ethanol fell 1 cent to $2.745 on
the West Coast, 1 cent to $2.535 on the  Gulf Coast , 2 cents to
$2.47 in Chicago and 1.5 cents to $2.63 in  New York . New York
Harbor’s premium to Chicago expanded 0.5 cent to 16 cents. The
Gulf Coast’s discount to the West Coast was unchanged at 21
cents.  The value of Renewable Identification Numbers, or RINs, for
corn-based ethanol decreased 0.5 cent to 75 cents, data compiled
by Bloomberg show. Advanced RINs, which cover biodiesel and
Brazilian sugarcane-based ethanol, sank 1.5 cents to 83.5 cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
