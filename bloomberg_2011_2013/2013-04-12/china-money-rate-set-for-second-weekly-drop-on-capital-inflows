China ’s benchmark money-market rate
was set for a second weekly drop on signs foreign capital is
flowing into the world’s second-biggest economy, increasing the
supply of funds in the financial system.  The  yuan  has gained 0.6 percent this year and touched 6.19
per dollar today, the strongest level since the government
unified official and market exchange rates at the end of 1993.
 Yuan positions  at Chinese financial institutions stemming from
foreign-exchange transactions, a gauge of cross-border capital
flows, climbed 295 billion yuan ($47.7 billion) in February,
central bank data showed on April 10. Increases are a sign of
inflows and January’s 684 billion yuan gain was a record.  “Capital inflows are probably continuing to rise in March
and April,” said Shi Lei, head of fixed-income research in
Beijing at Ping An Securities Co., a unit of the nation’s
second-biggest insurance company. “Liquidity will remain loose
this month.”  The seven-day  repurchase rate , which measures interbank
funding availability, dropped 27 basis points this week to 2.96
percent as of 10:57 a.m. in  Shanghai , according to a weighted
average rate compiled by the National Interbank Funding Center.
The rate fell six basis point, or 0.06 percentage point, today.  The one-year swap contract, the fixed cost needed to
receive the floating seven-day repurchase rate, slipped one
basis point this week to 3.26 percent, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. It was unchanged today.  -- Judy Chen . Editors: Robin Ganguly,  James Regan   To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
