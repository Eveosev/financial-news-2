The National Education Association,
a Beverly Hills hip-hop artist and hedge fund manager Orin Kramer are among the top initial donors to a nonprofit issue-advocacy group founded by President  Barack Obama ’s former
campaign aides.  The group, called Organizing for Action, has raised $4.9
million since it was formed in January, OFA officials said in a
statement yesterday. More than 109,000 people gave, and the
average contribution was $44.65, according to the statement.  OFA has been using Obama’s e-mail list of 13 million
supporters and his social media accounts, particularly Twitter
and Facebook, to promote his second-term policies. The group
also has purchased online advertising, held rallies on
tightening  gun  controls and blasted e-mails advocating the
president’s desire to create a pathway to citizenship for
undocumented immigrants.  As a nonprofit, OFA isn’t legally required to disclose its
donors -- an arrangement decried by watchdog groups including
the Washington-based Democracy 21 and the Campaign Legal Center.
OFA yesterday posted to  its website  the names and contribution
amounts of anyone who gave $250 or more, and the group said it
will continue to make such disclosures every three months.  Three people have given six figures: Philip Munger, a  New
York  philanthropist, gave $250,000; Levi Strauss heir John
Goldman, who lives in Atherton, California, contributed
$125,000; and Nicola Miner, a San Francisco art benefactor,
wrote a check for $125,000. Miner’s father co-founded  Oracle
Corp. (ORCL) , and her husband is the novelist Robert Mailer Anderson.  Familiar Donors  One union, the National Education Association, made the
top-25 donor list, contributing $15,466. OFA says it doesn’t
accept contributions from corporations. Prakazrel Michel, better
known as “Pras,” a founding member of the hip-hop group
Fugees, gave $20,000.  Michel was one of several celebrity donors.  Blythe Danner ,
an actress and environmental activist -- and mother of actress
 Gwyneth Paltrow  -- contributed $500. Nancy Sinatra, the daughter
of  Frank Sinatra  known for her 1966 hit “These Boots Are Made
for Walkin’,” also gave $500.  Most of the large donors are familiar names to Democratic
candidates, and about a dozen of the top-25 OFA donors raised
$500,000 or more for Obama’s 2012 re-election campaign.  Donald Sussman, founder of Paloma Partners hedge fund and
the husband of Representative  Chellie Pingree , a Maine Democrat,
gave OFA $50,000.  Andrew Tobias, treasurer of the  Democratic National
Committee , also donated $50,000 and Kramer, a general partner at
Boston Provident LP, gave OFA $75,000.  For Related News and Information:  To contact the reporter on this story:
