An employee of an international
bank in Moscow was detained on suspicion of stealing at least
300 million rubles ($10 million) from investors in purported
property developments in Montenegro, the  Interior Ministry  said.  Vsevolod Glukhovtsev, a vice president at one of the
world’s biggest banks, began raising funds in 2006 by telling
people he was an influential banker and casino owner, the
ministry said today in a  statement  on its website. He used funds
deposited on his accounts in Montenegro for personal purposes
and provided faked reports to the investors, it said.  Glukhovtsev, 50, was detained yesterday on charges of
large-scale fraud, according to the statement. A preliminary
investigation found Glukhovtsev had purchased expensive property
in Moscow and abroad, as well as luxury cars, art and jewelry,
according to the statement.  “The collective value is many times higher than the known
damages at this time,” the police said.  Investigators have found at least five victims in the
Moscow region and suspect there are more, the ministry said in
the statement. A search of his home and office also uncovered
guns and munitions for which he was unable to immediately
provide a license.  The bank where Glukhovtsev works cooperated with
investigators and has nothing to do with the allegations, the
police said.  Glukhovtsev works at Royal Bank of  Scotland , Interfax
reported, citing an unidentified person with knowledge of the
case. David Gaffney, a spokesman for RBS, wasn’t immediately
able to comment on whether Glukhovtsev was employed at the bank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
