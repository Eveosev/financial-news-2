South African platinum miners will
meet with the Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union
on April 15 to encourage the group to join central bargaining
over wages, an official from the country’s mining chamber said.  “It is known that AMCU has walked away from the
negotiations,” Vusi Mabena, senior executive of stakeholder
relations at the Chamber of Mines, said in a phone interview
today in Johannesburg. “We are going to motivate” them to take
part, he said.  South Africa ’s Chamber of Mines represents mining companies
and hosts annual wage talks between its members and labor
unions. All platinum companies will be allowed into the
negotiations, Mabena said.  Tensions between members of the National Union of
Mineworkers and AMCU that contributed to violence last year at
Lonmin Plc’s Marikana mine, continued on March 5 when workers
refused to go underground, demanding the closure of NUM offices.  Companies have been talking to AMCU individually and the
meeting “is a culmination of a number of activities to persuade
AMCU to participate, Mabena said. “We don’t know what the
outcome of that meeting will be.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
