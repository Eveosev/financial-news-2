A weakening in the yen past the key
psychological support level of 100 per dollar will likely see it
extend losses to 101.25, IG Markets Securities Ltd. said, citing
trading patterns.  A monthly chart shows the yen halted its decline to 101.25
in November 1999 before again meeting resistance around that
level in January 2005. The yen rose 0.3 percent to 99.38 against
the dollar as of 8:06 a.m. in  London . It yesterday touched
99.95, the weakest since April 14, 2009, when it last traded at
100.  “You can draw a pretty clean horizontal line from the end
of 1999,” said Junichi Ishikawa, a market analyst at IG in
 Tokyo . “Yen crosses have been firm, so it’s possible that if
the yen breaks support at 100, it’ll weaken further, targeting
that 101.25 level.”  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns to forecast changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index. Support and resistance refer to
areas on a chart where analysts anticipate orders to buy or sell
may be clustered.  To contact the reporters on this story:
