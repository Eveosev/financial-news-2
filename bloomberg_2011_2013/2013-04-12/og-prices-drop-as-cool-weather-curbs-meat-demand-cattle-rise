Hog futures fell, heading for the
second straight weekly loss, on signs that cool weather across
the U.S. is lowering demand for pork. Cattle advanced.  The forecast has turned cooler across the eastern and
southern U.S. over the next 11 to 15 days, and a return to
warmth “will be slower to evolve,” according to an e-mailed
report from MDA Weather Services today. Meat purchases tend to
increase when consumers grill outdoors during warmer weather.  “Our domestic demand is really holding us back,”
Christian Mayer, a market adviser at Northstar Commodity
Investments Co. in Minneapolis, said in a telephone interview.
“The weather is what the weather is.”  Hog futures for June settlement fell 0.1 percent to 89.325
cents a pound at 10:46 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
A close at that level would leave prices down 0.4 percent this
week, after falling 1.5 percent last week.  Cattle futures for June delivery rose 0.2 percent to
$1.20875 a pound on the CME. The commodity is down 8.8 percent
this year through yesterday.  Feeder-cattle futures for May settlement dropped 0.1
percent to $1.416 a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
