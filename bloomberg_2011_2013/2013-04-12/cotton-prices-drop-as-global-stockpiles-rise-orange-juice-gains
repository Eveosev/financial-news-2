Cotton futures fell, heading for
the second straight weekly decline, on signs of increasing
global supplies.  Orange juice  climbed.  The  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said on April 10 that
global stockpiles of cotton will be 82.45 million bales in the
year ending July 31, or 0.9 percent bigger than a March estimate
and 18 percent more than a year earlier. Traders in a Bloomberg
survey projected world inventories of 81.6 million. A bale
weighs 480 pounds (218 kilograms).  “We’ve just got too much supply in the world,”  Keith Brown , the president of Keith Brown & Co., a broker in Moultrie,
Georgia, said in a telephone interview. “The market’s coming to
its fundamental senses and saying, ‘Why am I up here?’”  Cotton for July delivery fell 0.9 percent to 85.94 cents a
pound at 10:31 a.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in New York. A close at
that level would leave the most-active futures down 1 percent
this week after losing 1.9 percent last week.  Orange-juice futures for May delivery rose 0.4 percent to
$1.435 a pound. On April 10, the USDA cut its forecast of orange
output in Florida for a fifth straight month. The state is the
world’s biggest grower, after  Brazil .  To contact the reporter on this story:
