Nestle SA (NESN)  fell after Chairman Peter Brabeck-Letmathe said the food company has an aim to reduce the
ratio of its  dividend  payout to about 55 percent of profit from
about 60 percent now.  Nestle dropped 0.5 percent to 67.35 Swiss francs in Zurich
trading, after the shares were unchanged before Brabeck-
Letmathe’s comments at the Vevey, Switzerland-based company’s
annual shareholder meeting in Lausanne today.  Nestle, the world’s largest food company, plans to reduce
the dividend to about 55 percent of profit “in the years to
come,” he said. Shareholders later approved a dividend of
2.05 Swiss francs per share, or a total of 6.6 billion francs
($7.1 billion). The company had net income of 10.6 billion
francs last year.  Robin Tickle, a spokesman for the company, said the amount
could be a “bit more or less” than the 55 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
