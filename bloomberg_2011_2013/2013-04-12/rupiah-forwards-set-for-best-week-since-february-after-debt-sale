Indonesia ’s rupiah forwards were
set for the best week since February as investor demand at an
overseas debt auction signaled increasing appetite for local
assets. Sovereign bonds rose.  The government raised  $3 billion  from 10- and 30-year notes
this week, with bids totaling $12.5 billion, according to a
finance ministry statement. The 2023 bonds were sold at a yield
of 3.50 percent, a record low for non-Islamic dollar securities
issued by the Southeast Asian nation.  Bank Indonesia  kept
borrowing cost at an unprecedented 5.75 percent low yesterday,
as predicted by all 16 economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  “The rupiah turned around and began to strengthen after
the global sale, showing appetite for Indonesian assets is still
strong,” said Rully Nova, a currency analyst at PT Bank
Himpunan Saudara 1906 in Jakarta. “The sale will add to foreign
reserves and reduce the rupiah’s volatility by extension.”  One-month non-deliverable forwards advanced 0.5 percent
this week to 9,733 per dollar as of 9:59 a.m. in Jakarta, the
biggest gain since the five days ended Feb. 1, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. They traded at a 0.2 percent discount to
the spot rate, which rose 0.3 percent to 9,710, prices from
local banks compiled by Bloomberg show. The contracts and the
rupiah were little changed today.  Default Swaps  A daily  fixing  used to settle the derivatives was set at
9,688 yesterday by the Association of Banks in  Singapore .
Today’s rate will be released at 11:30 a.m. in the city-state.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves
in the  exchange rate  used to price options, climbed three basis
points this week to 5.98 percent.  Foreign reserves  may recover this quarter, Nova said. They
totaled $104.8 billion in March after dropping $8 billion during
the quarter, the biggest decline since Bloomberg began compiling
the figures in 1998.  The cost to insure the nation’s government debt using five-
year credit-default swaps declined this week, dropping 16 basis
points to 142 in  New York , the most since the five days ended
Nov. 23, according to CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos.
