The  Detroit Lions  signed Havard
Rugland after the Norwegian kicker’s four-minute trick-shot
video on YouTube drew the attention of National Football League
teams.  Rugland, 28, worked out with the Lions last month and was
signed yesterday, according to the team’s website. Terms of the
deal weren’t announced.  In the video, titled “Kickalicious,” Rugland was shown
landing a kick in a moving rowboat among the trick shots, as
well as making more traditional kicks as long as 60 yards. It
has over 3 million hits on the video-sharing website since being
posted last year.  Rugland will compete with former San Francisco 49ers kicker
 David Akers  to replace Jason Hanson, who retired after 21
seasons with the Lions. Akers, 38, was released by the 49ers
last month after kicking three field goals in a Super Bowl loss
to the  Baltimore Ravens .  Jill McBride Baxter, Rugland’s agent, declined in a
telephone interview to comment on the financial terms of the
deal. Lions spokesman Matt Barnhart said in an e-mail that the
team doesn’t disclose terms of contracts with players.  Rugland has no American football experience and has worked
with former NFL kicker Michael Husted to improve his technique,
according to NFL.com. He had a tryout with the  New York Jets  in
December, the network said.  Rugland was a social worker prior to coming to the U.S.,
Baxter said. He also played amateur soccer in Norway.  To contact the reporter on this story:
