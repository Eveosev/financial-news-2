Copper declined, paring the first
weekly advance in four, on concern that demand from  China  may
not be able to absorb rising global supplies. Aluminum, zinc and
nickel also dropped.  Copper for delivery in three months dropped as much as 0.5
percent to $7,572.25 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange
and was at $7,588.50 by 11:19 a.m. in  Shanghai , paring a weekly
gain to 2.5 percent. Metal for delivery in May on the Comex lost
0.2 percent to $3.428 a pound.  LME  inventories  climbed to 590,175 tons yesterday, the
highest since September 2003, bourse data showed. Chinese
 imports  of unwrought copper and products fell 29 percent to
967,632 tons in the first quarter from a year ago, the customs
department said on April 10.  “The technical bounce has run its course,” Xu Liping, an
analyst at HNA Topwin Futures Co., said by phone from Shanghai.
“This year’s imports will be weaker than last year, which will
be more or less interpreted as weakening demand from China.”  Copper for delivery in August on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange rose 0.6 percent 55,190  yuan  ($8,915) a ton. On the LME,
lead climbed.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
