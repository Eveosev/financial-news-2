The  Chicago Bulls  put an end to a
second lengthy winning streak in the  National Basketball
Association  in two weeks as they handed the New York Knicks
their first defeat in 14 games.  The Bulls, who snapped the  Miami Heat ’s 27-game winning run
on March 27, beat the Knicks 118-111 in overtime last night at
United Center in Chicago.  The Knicks (51-27), who on April 9 won the Atlantic
Division for the first time since 1993-94, are second in the
Eastern Conference, 11 games behind the Heat, who have the best
record in the NBA at 62-16.  The Knicks had a 59-54 halftime advantage before the Bulls
rallied in the second half to tie the game at 105-105 at the end
of the fourth quarter. Chicago outscored New York 13-6 in
overtime.  Nate Robinson  came off the bench to score a season-high 35
points, including eight in overtime, and Jimmy Butler had 22
points and 14 rebounds for the Bulls (43-35).  Carmelo Anthony had 36 points and 19 rebounds for the
Knicks and J.R. Smith added 28 points and 14 rebounds.  The NBA playoffs begin April 20, three days after the
regular season ends.  To contact the reporter on this story:
