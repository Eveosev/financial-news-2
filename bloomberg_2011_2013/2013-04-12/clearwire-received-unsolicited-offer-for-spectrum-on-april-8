Clearwire Corp. (CLWR) ’s board is
reviewing an unsolicited offer to acquire its licenses to
provide wireless Internet access, presenting a new wrinkle as
shareholders consider a takeover offer from  Sprint Nextel Corp. (S)   Clearwire received the proposal for its airwave permits in
large markets on April 8 from an unnamed “strategic buyer,” it
said yesterday in a regulatory filing. The party offered $1
billion to $1.5 billion, minus the present value of the leases,
“which could be substantial,” Clearwire said.  Sprint, which owns a slight majority of Bellevue,
Washington-based Clearwire’s shares, is seeking to gain those
same airwave licenses by buying out other investors for $2.97 a
share.  Dish Network Corp. (DISH)  has presented a competing bid for
$3.30 a share.  “This might provide some competition for Dish,” said Walt
Piecyk, an analyst at BTIG LLC in New York. Bob Toevs, a Dish
spokesman, declined to comment.  The offer would value Clearwire’s airwaves at 20 cents to
30 cents per megahertz of capacity for each person covered,
compared with 21 cents for Sprint’s proposal, Piecyk said.  Clearwire  jumped  as much as 4.3 percent to $3.40 in
extended trading. The shares closed yesterday at $3.26 before
the filing was released.  The board is also considering whether or not to make a June
1 interest payment, Clearwire said. The company said it told two
parties that had offered this month to lend money, Crest
Financial Ltd. and Aurelius Capital Management LP, that it
wasn’t prepared to accept their proposals.  To contact the reporter on this story:
