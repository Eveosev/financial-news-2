Brazil ’s swap rates climbed as an
economic index increased more than forecast after inflation
exceeded policy makers’ target range, fueling speculation they
will increase borrowing costs as soon as next week.  Swap rates on the contract due in January 2015 rose three
basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 8.53 percent at 10:08
a.m. in  Sao Paulo , extending the increase since April 5 to 13
basis points. It was the first weekly climb since the period
ended March 8. The real slid 0.1 percent to 1.9783 per dollar,
paring its five-day gain to 0.3 percent.  The central bank reported today that economic activity rose
0.44 percent in February from a year earlier, surpassing the
0.10 percent median forecast of 21 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg. The national statistics agency said on April 10 that
annual inflation accelerated to 6.59 percent in March, exceeding
the 6.50 percent upper limit of the central bank’s target range
for the first time since November 2011.  “The better than expected economic activity number could
make the central bank more comfortable raising  interest rates  in
April,”  Luciano Rostagno , the chief strategist at Banco WestLB
do Brasil SA, said in a phone interview.  Minutes of the central bank’s March 5-6 meeting indicated
an increase in the benchmark lending  rate  from a record low 7.25
percent wasn’t imminent as policy makers said “a cautious
management of monetary policy” was needed. Board members are
next scheduled to set rates on April 16-17.  To contact the reporters on this story:
