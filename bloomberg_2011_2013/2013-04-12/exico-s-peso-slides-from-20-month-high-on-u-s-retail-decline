Mexico ’s peso fell from a 20-month
high after U.S. retail sales dropped last month, damping
prospects for the Latin American nation’s biggest export market.  The peso weakened 0.3 percent to 12.0745 per  U.S. dollar  at
8:30 a.m. in Mexico City, after yesterday touching 12.0194 per
dollar in intraday trading, the strongest level since August
2011. The peso has rallied 6.5 percent this year, the most among
the dollar’s 16 major counterparts tracked by Bloomberg. It has
advanced 0.9 percent for the week.  Retail  sales  in the U.S. fell 0.4 percent in March, the
most in nine months, Commerce Department figures showed today.
The median forecast of economists  surveyed  by Bloomberg called
for an unchanged reading. Mexico sends about 80 percent of its
exports to the U.S.  “After the U.S. data, it weakened a bit,”  Ramon Cordova ,
a trader at Banco Base SA in San Pedro Garza Garcia, Mexico,
said in a telephone interview. “At the 12 level, there are
going to be a lot of barriers.”  Some traders have orders to sell the peso automatically
once it gets close to 12 per dollar, a psychologically
significant level for many investors, according to Cordova.  Yields on peso bonds due in 2024 fell one basis point, or
0.01 percentage point, to 4.74 percent today, set for a record
low close, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The price
rose 0.08 centavo to 147.11 centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
