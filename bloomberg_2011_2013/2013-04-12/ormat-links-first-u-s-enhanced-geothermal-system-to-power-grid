Ormat Technologies Inc. (ORA) , a U.S.
developer of renewable power projects, boosted output at a
Nevada geothermal plant in the first commercial use of
technology developed to tap underground energy sources that
can’t be reached with traditional systems.  Ormat increased the capacity of its Desert Peak 2 facility,
in Churchill County, Nevada, by about 38 percent, or 1.7
megawatts, according to a  statement  today from the U.S. Energy
Department, which invested $5.4 million in the project.  Desert Peak is the first commercial plant connected to the
U.S.  power grid  to use so-called enhanced geothermal systems,
the Energy Department said. The  U.S. Geological Survey  estimates
the technology may eventually enable the development of as much
as 500 gigawatts of capacity in the country.  The “project represents a critical investment to ensure
America leads in this growing global industry,” Assistant
Secretary for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy David Danielson said in the statement.  Standard geothermal power plants tap underground pockets of
steam, which is piped to the surface to drive turbines and
create electricity.  In enhanced geothermal systems, water is injected into the
ground either at aging power plants where the steam resource has
been depleted, or at sites where there are hot rocks and no
steam. Once heated, the water is piped back to the surface to
make power.  To contact the reporter on this story:
