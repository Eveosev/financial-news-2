K+S AG (SDF) ,  Europe â€™s largest potash
producer, dropped the most in three months in Frankfurt trading
after analysts at Deutsche Bank AG recommended selling the
shares on weaker prices for the crop nutrient.  The stock fell as much as 3.8 percent, its biggest intraday
decline since Jan. 3, to 34.30 euros. Deutsche Bank analysts
Virginie Boucher-Ferte, Martin Dunwoodie and Tim Jones cut their
rating to sell from hold, saying pricing for the crop nutrient
will remain under pressure as demand is held back by slower
economic growth.  K+S, based in Kassel,  Germany , was trading down 3.7 percent
at 34.34 euros as of 11:24 a.m. local time. The stock has lost
1.9 percent this year for a market value of 6.57 billion euros
($8.57 billion).  The analysts also cut their target price for the stock to
31 euros from 32 euros, according to a note to clients dated
April 11.  To contact the reporter on this story:
