Copper in London may fall to test
psychological support at $7,000 a metric ton based on Elliott
Wave Theory, according to Cofco Futures Co.  “Assuming the retreat from the high in March is the so-
called wave 1, copper is in the downward wave 5 now,” said
Beijing-based analyst Liang Lijuan. “The impulse under way will
test $7,200 first and may lead to as low as $7,000.”  Elliott Wave Theory, created by Ralph Elliott in 1938,
seeks to analyze price trends in a five-stage structure with
three steps forward, two steps back. Copper for delivery in
three months on the London Metal Exchange fell to $7,331.25 a
ton on April 4, the lowest level in eight months.  The metal fell 0.3 percent to $7,584 a ton at 9:32 a.m.
Shanghai time, and has lost 9.1 percent after climbing to a
four-month high of $8,346 a ton on Feb. 4.  “Finishing this wave, copper is likely to witness a
rebound, the scale of which will depend on the bottom found in
wave 5,” Liang added.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns to forecast changes in a security, commodity,
index or currency.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
