Finance Minister Jim Flaherty said
it would be best to have a replacement for Bank of Canada
Governor Mark Carney named by the end of the April while
declining to confirm that would be the case.  “It would be optimum to have the appointment made this
month, but we’ll see if that’s possible,” Flaherty told
reporters on a phone call today from Hamilton,  Bermuda . “Part
of the process is my interviews of the short-listed
candidates,” he said. He wouldn’t say whether those interviews
have taken place.  The central bank’s board of directors met this month to
prepare a short list for Flaherty. The directors have been
reviewing candidates after posting the job Jan. 7, following
Carney’s surprise announcement in November that he would leave
his job June 1 to lead the Bank of England.  Analysts at JPMorgan Chase & Co. have said the most likely
replacements are Senior Deputy Governor Tiff Macklem and Export
Development Canada Chief Executive Officer Stephen Poloz.  To contact the reporter on this story:
