The French Senate approved a bill
allowing same-sex marriages and the adoption of children by gay
couples, paving the way for it to become law later this year.  The bill that provoked large protests in Paris was passed
in the upper house of the French parliament after a week of what
the Le Monde newspaper characterized as “intense and virulent”
debate. It will now go back to the National Assembly, which
voted in favor on Feb. 12, before becoming law.  The gay-marriage bill has proved controversial in  France , a
predominantly Catholic country, and led to protests by hundreds
of thousands of demonstrators on Jan. 13 and March 24. Although
the rally last month was called to challenge the so-called
“marriage-for-all” legislation, some demonstrators also
carried placards showing their anger had widened to economic
issues.  Opinion polls show that a majority of voters favor
giving same-sex couples the right to marry, though they oppose
giving such couples rights to adoption or medically assisted
procreation.  Pollster BVA found that 58 percent of voters favor gay
marriage, while 53 percent oppose giving gay couples the right
to adopt, according to a survey published in January. CSA,
another polling company, found that 52 percent favor gay
marriage and the same proportion oppose adoption by same-sex
couples.  To contact the reporter on this story:
