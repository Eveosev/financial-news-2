The U.S. State Department said
President  Barack Obama  has approved a new bridge connecting
 Detroit  with Windsor, Ontario at the busiest crossing along the
U.S.-Canada border.  The department said in a statement today it has issued a
presidential permit to  Michigan  to build the bridge after
determining the project would “serve the national interest.”
The bridge will “meet future capacity requirements in a
critical travel corridor,” it said.  The Windsor-Detroit crossing is the busiest in the world’s
largest bilateral trade  relationship , with more than C$130
billion ($128 billion) in shipments and 8,000 trucks crossing
each day, according to Canadian government data. Truck traffic
is expected to triple over the next 30 years, the country’s
transport department estimates.  Much of the traffic now passes over the 83-year-old
Ambassador Bridge, a toll bridge owned by Detroit International
Bridge Co., a private firm controlled by billionaire Manuel Moroun. Moroun has opposed the project, arguing the new bridge
is unnecessary and costly, and has proposed to add a new span to
the Ambassador Bridge.  Canada’s Labor Minister Lisa Raitt will make a joint
announcement with Michigan Governor  Rick Snyder  in Detroit on
progress toward building a new bridge to connect the city with
Windsor, according to an advisory issued before the State
Department statement.  The press conference will take place at 2 p.m., according
to an advisory issued by the office of Canadian Prime Minister
 Stephen Harper .  To contact the reporter on this story:
