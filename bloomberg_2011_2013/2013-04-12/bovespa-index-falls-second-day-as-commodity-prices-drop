The Bovespa index dropped for a
second day as lower commodities prices dimmed the outlook for
 Brazil ’s raw-material exporters after data showed U.S. retail
sales unexpectedly declined.  Iron-ore producer Vale SA followed metals lower. Plane
builder  Embraer SA (EMBR3)  fell after saying it delivered 29 jets in the
first quarter, down from 34 one year earlier.  The Bovespa index fell 0.6 percent to 55,093.85 at 10:26
a.m. in Sao Paulo, paring this week’s advance to 0.1 percent.
Fifty  stocks  declined today while 17 advanced. The real was
little changed at 1.9753 per dollar. The Standard & Poor’s GSCI
index of 24 raw materials lost 1.5 percent.  “Investors have been really optimistic about the outlook
for the recovery in the U.S., but the retail sales figures today
were disappointing,”  Alvaro Bandeira , a partner at Orama Asset
Management, said by phone from Rio de Janeiro. “Global
investors seem to be in a bad mood after the numbers, and that
hurts the Bovespa.”  Retail sales in the U.S. fell 0.4 percent in March, the
most in nine months, Commerce Department figures showed today in
Washington. The median forecast of 85 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg called for an unchanged reading.  Vale lost 0.6 percent to 32.20 reais. Embraer declined 0.8
percent to 17.85 reais.  Oil company OGX Petroleo & Gas Participacoes SA rose 1.4
percent to 1.48 reais.  MMX Mineracao & Metalicos SA (MMXM3)  gained 1.5
percent to 1.99 reais.  To contact the reporter on this story:
