Legislators, agricultural groups
and farmers protested outside of Barrick Gold Corp.’s Pueblo
Viejo mine in the Dominican Republic today, Diario Libre said.  The groups were protesting alleged environmental damage
caused by the mine, as well as the contract between Barrick and
the Caribbean nation’s government, the Santo Domingo-based
newspaper said.  Dominican Republic President Danilo Medina said Feb. 27
that the existing contract between the government and Barrick is
“unacceptable” and must be revised to provide more benefit to
the country.  To contact the reporter on this story:
