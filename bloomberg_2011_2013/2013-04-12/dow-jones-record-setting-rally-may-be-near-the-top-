The stock rally that pushed the  Dow
Jones Industrial Average  to a record may slow after the gauge
passed a technical level, according to Meritz Securities Co.  The 14-day  relative-strength index  for the Dow Jones rose
to 71.9 yesterday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Readings above 70 indicate to some analysts prices will probably
reverse direction. The Dow climbed to 14,865.14, its highest
close ever.  “The market’s too hot,” said Park Sungjin, the Seoul-
based head of asset management at Meritz Securities Co., which
oversees $7 billion. “According to the RSI, it’s not a good
time for new investment. It’s a good time for profit-taking.”  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to forecast changes in an index,
security, commodity or currency. The relative-strength index
measures the velocity of price changes to identify overbought or
oversold conditions and turning points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
