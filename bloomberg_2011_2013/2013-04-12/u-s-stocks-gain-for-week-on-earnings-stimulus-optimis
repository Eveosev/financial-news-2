U.S. stocks  advanced for the week,
sending the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index to a record, amid
optimism that global stimulus efforts and corporate earnings
growth will continue to power the world’s largest economy.  Equities halted a four-day rally on the last session of the
week amid disappointing  retail sales  and tumbling commodity
prices. Consumer-discretionary stocks led gains as all  10 S&P
500 groups  rose. L Brands Inc. and  Ross Stores (ROST)  Inc. climbed at
least 9 percent amid higher-than-estimated sales. Newmont Mining
Corp. slumped 7.6 percent as gold entered a  bear market .  The  S&P 500  climbed 2.3 percent this week to 1,588.85, the
biggest advance since Jan. 4. The gauge reached an all-time high
on April 11, and is up 11 percent for the year. The  Dow Jones
Industrial Average  rallied 299.81 points, or 2.1 percent, to
14,865.06. The 30-stock measure also climbed to a record before
slipping less than one point in the final session.  “ Central bank  easing is the most important thing,” Jason Benowitz, who helps manage $4.5 billion at Roosevelt Investment
Group Inc. in  New York , said by telephone. The  Federal Reserve 
minutes “showed members are somewhat divided about the pace of
the program, but it’s very important to understand that
discussion occurred before the March indicators showed that the
economy was slowing. We have on top of that the  Bank of Japan .”  The  S&P 500 (SPX)  surpassed its intraday record set in October
2007 as Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said “bold monetary
easing” will reverse persistent deflation in his nation, while
the  European Central Bank  vowed to keep rates low and continue
injecting liquidity into the banking system.  Central Bank  In the U.S., several Fed officials said the central bank
should taper its bond-buying program later this year if labor
market conditions improve, according to minutes from the March
meeting. Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said on April 8 that
economic conditions were far from where he would like them to
be.  The S&P 500 posted its biggest drop of the year in the
previous week as data on jobs, services industries and
manufacturing sparked concern the economic recovery may be
slowing. The index has more than doubled from its 12-year low in
March 2009, helped by the Fed’s unprecedented bond purchases and
three straight years of  profit growth .  Among economic reports in the latest week, China imports
grew while the nation’s inflation slowed last month from a 10-
month high. U.S. jobless claims decreased more than estimated.
Equities slumped on April 12 as retail sales dropped in March by
the most in nine months, while a gauge on  consumer sentiment 
slipped.  Earnings Season  Investors also watched earnings. Of the 30 S&P 500
companies that reported  first-quarter results , 70 percent
exceeded analysts’ profit estimates and 57 percent beat sales
projections, according to Bloomberg data. At the same time,
estimates compiled by Bloomberg show income at S&P 500 companies
probably fell 1.4 percent in the first quarter, the first year-
over-year drop since 2009.  “The set-up into earnings is pretty strong,” Benowitz
said. “For the whole season, we think expectations are low
enough that companies can beat. We’re not expecting the market
to sell off on earnings.”  Alcoa Inc. (AA) , the first company in the Dow to release results
this season, reported earnings on April 8 that exceeded
analysts’ estimates while revenue trailed projections. The
shares slipped 0.2 percent to $8.22.  The  Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index (VIX) , which
measures the cost of using options as insurance against declines
in the S&P 500, fell 13 percent to 12.06. The gauge, known as
the VIX, is down 33 percent this year and in March reached its
lowest level since February 2007.  Fed Influence  “The bulls will continue to run,” David Tawil, the co-
founder of Maglan Capital LP, a distressed-debt hedge fund that
manages about $50 million, said by phone. “That’s not
necessarily an indication of how good the fundamentals are. It’s
an indication of how strong our Federal Reserve has been in its
influence.”  Consumer discretionary stocks rallied 3.4 percent for the
week, as retailers’ monthly data offset Commerce Department
figures showing a 0.4 percent drop in March U.S. retail sales.  L Brands (LTD)  advanced 9.2 percent to $50.43. The owner of the
Victoria’s Secret chain said March same-store sales gained 3
percent, beating the 0.4 percent increase projected by analysts.
Ross Stores rose 9 percent to $64.67 as monthly sales at stores
open at least one year exceeded estimates and the retailer of
discount designer wear said first-quarter profit will top a
previous forecast.  Technology Shares  Technology stocks  rallied 1.9 percent as gains in  First
Solar Inc. (FSLR)  and  JDS Uniphase (JDSU)  Corp. offset a decline in Hewlett-
Packard Co. First Solar surged 40 percent to $37.11. The world’s
largest thin-film solar manufacturer  forecast 2013 sales  above
estimates. JDS Uniphase, the maker of fiber-optic equipment,
jumped 9.4 percent to $13.98, while semiconductor maker Advanced
Micro Devices Inc. rose 8.3 percent to $2.48.  Personal-computer maker Hewlett-Packard plunged 4.9 percent
to $20.90. PC shipments plummeted in every region of the world
in the first quarter as buyers opted for smartphones and tablet
computers. Global PC unit shipments fell 14 percent, a bigger
drop than the 7.7 percent decline market research firm IDC had
forecast.  Financial companies advanced 2.5 percent. JPMorgan Chase &
Co. added 2.3 percent to $49.01. The largest  U.S. bank  by assets
slid 0.6 percent on the last day of the week, even after
announcing first-quarter profit rose 33 percent on improving
consumer credit quality. While mortgage volume jumped 37
percent, mortgage-banking net income dropped 31 percent.  Wells Fargo  Wells Fargo & Co ., the largest U.S. home lender, posted a
22 percent rise in first-quarter profit that beat forecasts as
the company curbed expense growth. Revenue, mortgage banking
income and lending margins fell. The stock added 0.2 percent to
$37.21.  J.C. Penney tumbled 5.4 percent to $14.62, for the second-
biggest retreat in the S&P 500. The department-store chain fell
to its lowest level since 2001 on April 9 after Chief Executive
Officer  Ron Johnson  was ousted and his predecessor Myron E.
Ullman III was reinstated.  Energy and material stocks posted the smallest gains out of
10 S&P 500 industries. Newmont Mining lost 7.6 percent to $36.37
for the biggest drop in the benchmark gauge. Gold entered what
many consider a bear market after slumping more than 20 percent
from an August 2011 record.  The S&P GSCI Index of 24 commodities fell 0.8 percent for
the second straight week of declines. Newfield Exploration Co.
slumped 2 percent to $21.70. Tesoro Corp. slid 3.3 percent to
$51.46.  To contact the reporter on this story:
