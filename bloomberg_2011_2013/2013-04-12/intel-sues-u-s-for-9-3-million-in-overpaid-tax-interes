Intel Corp. (INTC) , the world’s largest
chipmaker, sued the U.S. government for $9.3 million in interest
on overpaid income taxes.  The claim arises from the disparity between  interest rates 
charged for corporate underpayments of income tax and the lower
rate given for overpayments, according to a complaint filed
yesterday in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims in Washington.  The company, based in  Santa Clara , California, said it had
“equivalent overpayments and underpayments of taxes” from
March 2003 to August 2009, and under  Internal Revenue Service 
rules was entitled to a net interest rate of zero.  To get to that figure, Intel “claims additional
overpayment interest for its 2002 tax year,” when the company
overpaid its federal income tax by $72 million, according to the
complaint.  Dean Patterson , an IRS spokesman, declined to comment,
saying in an e-mail that “federal law prohibits the IRS from
discussing specific taxpayers.”  The IRS previously allowed an Intel net interest rate claim
involving 73 tax periods, according to 2012 correspondence with
the tax agency included in the suit.  The allowed claim is “voluminous,” so it wasn’t included
in the correspondence, “but can be provided upon request,”
according to the filing.  The case is Intel Corp. v. U.S., 13-cv-00262, U.S. Court of
Federal Claims (Washington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
