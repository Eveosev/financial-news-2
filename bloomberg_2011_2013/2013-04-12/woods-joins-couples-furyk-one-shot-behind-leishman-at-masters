Tiger Woods,  Fred Couples  and  Jim
Furyk  are one shot behind leader Marc Leishman during the second
round at golf’s Masters Tournament.  Woods, a four-time Masters winner seeking his first major
championship victory since 2008, had three birdies in a four-
hole stretch to get to 5-under par eight holes into his second
round at Augusta National Golf Club in Augusta, Georgia. He’s 3-
under par today after opening with a 70 yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
