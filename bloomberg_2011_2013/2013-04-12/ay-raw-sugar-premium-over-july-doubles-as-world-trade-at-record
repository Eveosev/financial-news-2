The premium raw sugar for May
delivery commands over the July futures more than doubled today
as world exports climbed to a record in the first quarter and
rains delayed the start of the crop in leading producer  Brazil .  Raw sugar for May delivery was as much as 0.11 cent a pound
more expensive than the July contract on ICE Futures U.S. in  New
York , exchange data on Bloomberg showed. That’s up from 0.05
cent a pound yesterday and reverses a discount of 0.02 cent a
pound a week earlier. That market structure, in which earlier
dated contracts are priced higher than later ones, is known as
backwardation and may signal limited supplies for now.  Rain this week will delay the sugar cane harvest in Brazil,
Sao Paulo-based weather forecaster Somar Meteorologia said in a
report e-mailed on April 8. That is helping raise the premium
buyers need to pay to obtain raw sugar from the South American
nation. Global sugar exports advanced to a record in the first
three months of the year, according to London-based Czarnikow
Group Ltd., which traded the sweetener in more than 90 countries
in 2011.  “The delay in the start of the Brazil harvest is helping
lift physical premiums,” Peter de Klerk, an analyst at
Czarnikow, said by phone from  London  today. “Global exports of
raw sugar reached a record 7.2 million tons in the first quarter
this year, up 20 percent from the previous peak in 2010.”  Raw sugar for loading in May at the port of Santos,
Brazil’s biggest, traded at a premium of 0.15 cent a pound to
the exchange price, consultancy SA Commodities in Santos said in
a report e-mailed April 10. That compares with 0.05 cent to 0.15
cent a pound on April 5, data from Swiss Sugar Brokers showed.  Global Consumption  Global sugar consumption will be 174.1 million metric tons
in the 2012-13 season that started in October in most countries,
an increase of 1.8 million tons from a November forecast,
Czarnikow said on March 20. Demand a year earlier was 171.1
million tons, up from a previous forecast of 169.9 million tons,
it said.  Raw sugar for July delivery fell 0.1 percent to 17.78 cents
a pound by 6:11 a.m. on ICE. White sugar for August delivery was
up 0.2 percent to $498.60 a ton on NYSE Liffe in London. Futures
trading volume in New York was more than double the average in
the past 100 days for the time of day, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Cocoa for July delivery fell 0.1 percent to $2,243 a ton in
New York. Cocoa for July delivery slid 0.1 to 1,487 pounds
($2,284) a ton in London. The beans used to make chocolate
gained 3.6 percent on Liffe and 5.2 percent on ICE this week.  “Next week’s publication of the first-quarter European
grinding figures is likely to confirm that demand is
recovering,”  Carsten Fritsch , an analyst at Commerzbank AG in
 Frankfurt , said in a report e-mailed today, referring to cocoa.  Arabica coffee for delivery in July was little changed at
$1.392 a pound on ICE. Robusta coffee for delivery in July rose
0.3 percent to $2,054 a ton on NYSE Liffe.  To contact the reporter on this story:
