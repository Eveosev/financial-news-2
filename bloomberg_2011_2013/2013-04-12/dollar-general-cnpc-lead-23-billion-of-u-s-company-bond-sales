Sales of corporate bonds in the
U.S. rose to at least $24 billion, the third straight week of
below-average issuance, while relative yields narrowed.  China National Petroleum Corp., the country’s largest oil
producer, issued $2 billion of debt and Goodlettsville,
Tennessee-based  Dollar General  Corp. raised $1.3 billion as they
led sales that were 24 percent below this year’s $31.6 billion
weekly average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
offerings follow  $23.7 billion  last week and $16 billion in the
five days ended March 29.  Sales began to taper off when Cyprus agreed to shut the
country’s second-largest bank on March 25, capping a tumultuous
week aimed at avoiding a disorderly sovereign default, and
helping set the stage for a 10 billion euro ($13 billion) rescue
package. In the U.S., signs that the economy is faltering
emerged as retail sales unexpectedly fell last month by the most
since June and  job creation  sputtered as employers added the
least to payrolls in nine months.  “The Cyprus bailout and weaker macroeconomic data may have
softened investor demand a little,” Jon Duensing, head of
corporate credit at Smith Breeden Associates, said in a
telephone interview from Boulder,  Colorado . Sales are also
decelerating as companies report first-quarter earnings, he
said.  Weaker Data  The extra yield investors demand to own corporate bonds
rather than government debentures narrowed to 215 basis points
yesterday from 221 basis points on April 5, according to Bank of
America Merrill Lynch index data. Yields were unchanged at 3.48
percent. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  CNPC’s $750 million of 1.45 percent, three-year securities
yield 115 basis points more than similar-maturity Treasuries,
its $500 million of 1.95 percent, five-year notes pay a relative
yield of 125 basis points and $750 million of 3.4 percent, 10-
year bonds have a 165 basis-point spread, Bloomberg data show.
The April 9 sale was the company’s first dollar issue in a year.  Sales of investment-grade debentures reached at least $15
billion, compared with  $17.4 billion  last week and a 2013 weekly
average of  $23.4 billion , Bloomberg data show.  Yields on investment-grade debt rose to 2.75 percent
yesterday from 2.72 percent on April 5, a record-low, according
to the Bank of America Merrill Lynch U.S. Corporate index.
Spreads narrowed 3 basis points to 148 basis points.  Cyprus Drama  Cypriot President Nicos Anastasiades agreed to wind down
Cyprus Popular Bank Pcl, 84 percent owned by the government,
under pressure from a German-led bloc in a negotiating melodrama
that threatened to rekindle the  European debt crisis  and rattle
markets. Those who will be largely wiped out encompass uninsured
depositors and bondholders, including senior creditors.  “There was a little bit of hesitation in the credit
markets,” Anthony Valeri, a market strategist at LPL Financial
LLC in  San Diego , said in a telephone interview. The “first
quarter was still very strong and I think we were due for a
pause.”  Sales reached $419 billion in the first quarter, the second
busiest on record behind $446.1 billion in the corresponding
period last year, Bloomberg data show.  Dutch Finance Minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem said today a 10
billion-euro rescue for Cyprus is now ready to be ratified by
parliaments, even as President Anastasiades said that he will
write to EU President  Herman Van Rompuy  to seek “further aid,”
in line with his nation’s needs.  Retail Sales  The 0.4 percent decrease in U.S. retail sales last month
followed a 1 percent gain in February, Commerce Department
figures showed today in  Washington . The  median  forecast of 85
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg called for an unchanged reading
in March.  Payrolls increased 88,000 in March, the smallest gain in
nine months and less than the most-pessimistic forecast in a
Bloomberg survey, after a revised 268,000 February increase,
Labor Department data showed on April 5 in Washington. The
 jobless rate  fell to 7.6 percent from 7.7 percent.  Dollar General, the discount retailer acquired by KKR & Co.
in 2007, issued $900 million of 3.25 percent, 10-year notes at a
spread of 155 basis points and $400 million of 1.875 percent,
five-year securities at 120 basis points on April 8, Bloomberg
data show. The debt is split-rated at Baa3, the lowest level of
investment grade, by Moody’s Investors Service and BB+, the
highest level of junk debt, by  Standard & Poor’s .  Offerings of speculative-grade bonds reached at least $9
billion, compared with  $6.4 billion  last week and a 2013 weekly
average of  $8.2 billion , Bloomberg data show.  Yields on junk debt fell to an unprecedented 6.31 percent
yesterday from 6.41 percent on April 5, according to the Bank of
America Merrill Lynch U.S. High Yield index. Spreads narrowed 22
basis points to 473 basis points.  High-risk, high-yield bonds are rated below Baa3 by Moody’s
and lower than BBB- at S&P.  Issuers planning sales include ONGC Videsh Ltd. with a $1.8
billion, two-part offering, Bloomberg data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
