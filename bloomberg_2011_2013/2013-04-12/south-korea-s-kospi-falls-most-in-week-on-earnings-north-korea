South Korean stocks fell, dragging
the  benchmark index  down to its biggest loss in a week, as
foreign investors sold equities on concern profit of builders
and shipyards will slump and  North Korea  tensions may increase.  GS Engineering & Construction Corp. (006360) , which reported an
unexpected loss this week, tumbled by the daily limit for a
second day. Hyundai Heavy Industries Co. led declines among
shipbuilders, falling 6 percent.  Hyundai Mobis (012330)  Co., South
Korea’s No. 1 auto-parts maker, slumped 6.6 percent after Woori
Investment & Securities Co. said the company’s quarterly
earnings may fall short of consensus estimates.  The  Kospi index  fell 1.3 percent to 1,924.23 at the close
on the Korea Exchange, taking its weekly loss to 0.2 percent.
Foreigners sold a net 47 billion won ($42 million) worth of
stocks listed on the Kospi, after two days of net purchases,
Korea Exchange Inc. data  show . The U.S. Defense Intelligence
Agency has reported that North Korea now has some nuclear
weapons small enough to be delivered by its ballistic missiles.  “Some foreign investors appear to have reduced their
positions because they were uncertain how the situation on the
Korean peninsula will develop over the weekend,” Im Jeong Jae,
a Seoul-based  fund manager  at Shinhan BNP Paribas Asset
Management Co., which oversees about $28 billion, said by phone.
“There were also jitters over earnings for some industries.”  North Korea may conduct a weapons test to coincide with the
101st anniversary of state founder  Kim Il Sung ’s birth on April
15, South Korean Defense Ministry spokesman Kim Min Seok said
yesterday in  Seoul . The regime reiterated that it is on a war
footing and its warheads are programmed with target coordinates.  Earnings Slump  The Kospi  trades  at 8.8 times 12-month projected profit,
compared with 10.3 times for the MSCI  Emerging Markets  Index,
data compiled by Bloomberg show.  GS Engineering tumbled 15 percent to the lowest level since
July 2005. The Seoul-based builder posted an operating loss of
535.4 billion won for the first quarter. Samsung Engineering
Co., which is scheduled to report its quarterly earnings on
April 16, sank 9.1 percent.  Hyundai Heavy dropped to the lowest since January 2010,
while  Samsung Heavy Industries Co. (010140)  lost 6.2 percent. An earnings
turnaround at the country’s shipbuilders will be difficult in
2013, Hyundai Securities Co. said in a report today.  Hyundai Mobis tumbled the most in 14 months in Seoul. The
company’s first-quarter operating profit may be 725 billion won,
falling short of the consensus estimate of 774 billion won,
Woori Investment said in a report today.  -- Editors: Allen Wan,  Matthew Oakley   To contact the reporter on this story:
