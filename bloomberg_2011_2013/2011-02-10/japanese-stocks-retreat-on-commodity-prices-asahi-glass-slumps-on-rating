Japan’s Topix index rose for five
consecutive days, as shipping lines gained along with higher
cargo tariffs and after some companies reported higher profits.  Nippon Yusen K.K., Japan’s largest shipping line by sales,
climbed 2.2 percent after a measure of bulk cargo tariffs jumped.
Sumitomo Osaka Cement Co., a maker of the building material,
surged 6.8 percent after the company reported a nine-month
profit. Takata Corp., which makes automobile safety equipment,
jumped 6.3 percent after it said earnings more than tripled.  “The view that stocks will rise further persists as
corporate earnings have been improving, so money will unlikely
flow out of equities,” said Yumi Nishimura, an equity-market
analyst at Daiwa Securities Capital Markets Co.  The Topix index rose 0.3 percent to 946.63 with about three
stocks advancing for every two that fell at the 3 p.m. close in
Tokyo. The Nikkei 225 Stock Average slid 0.1 percent to
10,606.65. For the week, the Nikkei has increased 0.6 percent,
while the Topix is up 1.2 percent. Japan’s market will be closed
tomorrow for a holiday.  The Topix has increased 5.3 percent in 2011, compared with
gains of 5 percent by the S&P 500 and 4.2 percent by the Stoxx
Europe 600 Index. Stocks in the Japanese benchmark are valued at
16.1 times estimated earnings on average, compared with 13.8
times for the  S&P 500  and 11.4 times for the Stoxx 600.  Nippon Yusen rose 2.2 percent to 373 yen. Mitsui O.S.K.
Lines Ltd., the second-largest shipping line by sales, climbed
2.2 percent to 558 yen. Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha Ltd., the No. 3,
increased 3.8 percent to 360 yen. The industry group that
includes the companies gained the most among the 33 groups in
the Topix.  Dry-Bulk Rebound  The Baltic Dry Index, a measure of shipping costs for
commodities, gained 2.6 percent yesterday, the most since Oct. 6.  “We think dry bulker rates are close to rebounding after
bottoming, while dry bulker futures have already started an
across-the-board rebound,” Seigo Ando, an analyst at Deutsche
Bank AG., wrote in a report dated yesterday.  Sumitomo Osaka Cement surged 6.8 percent to 205 yen, the
biggest gain in the Nikkei and the highest close since July 2009.
The company said it returned to a net income of 1.13 billion yen
($13.7 million) in the nine months ended Dec. 31 from a loss of
871 million yen a year earlier.  Takata, a maker of automobile safety equipment, rallied 6.3
percent to 2,683 yen. Nine-month net income more than tripled to
16.4 billion yen from 4.77 billion yen a year earlier, as sales
in  Asia  increased 15 percent, Takata said in a release.  Strong Earnings  Calsonic Kansei Corp., an autoparts maker, soared 10
percent to 402 yen, the second-largest increase in the Topix.
The company boosted its full-year net income outlook 67 percent
to 10 billion yen, citing an increase in the number of cars
manufactured at its clients and cost cuts.  “Corporate earnings are strong, supported by demand from
emerging nations,” said Kenji Sekiguchi, general manager
covering equity and debt in the strategic investment and
research division of Mitsubishi UFJ Asset Management Co., which
manages $75 billion.  Today, 195 of the 1,668 companies in the Topix index were
scheduled to release earnings statements. Of the 1,270 that have
reported results for the latest quarter, 168 have exceeded
analysts’ estimates, while 123 have missed them, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said the U.S.  unemployment rate  is likely to remain high “for some time”
even after the biggest two-month drop in the jobless rate since
1958.  “A high unemployment rate means that the Fed will continue
its quantitative-easing measures, so that should be positive for
the market,” said  Mitsushige Akino , who oversees about $450
million in Tokyo at Ichiyoshi Investment Management Co. “The
Fed’s timing to exit the measures will be a significant concern
for the market.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
