Copper may fall for a fourth day in  New York  on concern demand might wane as countries including  China , the world’s biggest consumer of the metal, move to
counter inflation.  China this week raised  interest rates  for the third time in
four months to curb inflation that a report next week may show
accelerated to the fastest pace in 30 months, according to
economists.  Brazil ’s government pledged yesterday to slash 50
billion reais ($30 billion) from this year’s spending plans in a
bid to ease pressure for higher borrowing costs.  “You need to be careful about the measures the BRICs and
other  developing countries  are now taking to counter
inflationary pressures,” said Nic Brown, an analyst at Natixis
Commodity Markets Ltd. in  London . “Demand for base metals may
not be quite as strong as the market is expecting.”  Copper for March delivery slipped 0.65 cent, or 0.1
percent, to $4.5175 a pound at 8:25 a.m. on the Comex in New
York. Copper for three-month delivery fell 0.2 percent to $9,905
a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange. Prices reached all-
time highs this week of $4.6375 and $10,160.  “We do not see the Chinese being buyers at this level, and
we no longer expect any significant post-holiday restocking,”  Leon Westgate , an analyst at Standard Bank Plc in London, said
in a report today. Chinese financial markets were shut for a
week through Feb. 8 for the Lunar New Year holiday.  Stronger Dollar  Copper stockpiles monitored by the LME gained for a second
day, and the dollar strengthened. Inventories, up 5.1 percent
this year, rose by 550 tons to 396,950 tons, daily exchange
figures showed today. Orders to draw copper from stocks, or
canceled warrants, slid 7.8 percent to 10,950 tons.  “Canceled warrants continue to contract, which is logical
given fresh stock build” and signals that spot demand is
easing, said  Andrey Kryuchenkov , an analyst at VTB Capital in
London. “The ratio of canceled warrants to stocks on warrant is
nearing highs not seen since the second quarter of 2010, or
about 35 days of consumption.”  The ratio was at about 10 days of usage as recently as Jan.
7, he said.  The U.S. Dollar Index, a six-currency gauge of the
greenback’s strength, advanced for the first time in four days,
gaining as much as 0.7 percent. A stronger dollar makes metals
priced in the currency more expensive in terms of other monies
and erodes demand for raw materials as an alternative
investment.  Aluminum for three-month delivery on the LME shed 0.9
percent to $2,522 a ton, lead lost 1.8 percent to $2,474 a ton
and tin was little changed at $31,250 a ton. Zinc dropped 1.6
percent to $2,418 a ton and nickel declined 1.2 percent to
$28,025 a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
