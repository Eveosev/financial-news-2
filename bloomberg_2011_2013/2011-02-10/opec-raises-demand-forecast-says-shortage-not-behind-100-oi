The Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries raised estimates for the amount of crude it
will need to produce this year, and said that prices at their
highest in two years don’t signal any supply shortage.  OPEC predicts it will have to provide 29.8 million barrels
a day this year, about 400,000 a day more than it estimated last
month. The revision is based on economic growth and a colder-
than-normal winter. Still, oil’s surge through $100 a barrel in  London  this year for the first time since 2008 does not signal
any global supply deficit, the organization said.  “World economic activity along with the effect of frigid
winter temperatures” is driving the change, the group’s
 Vienna-based secretariat  said in a report today.  Global oil consumption will increase by 1.4 million barrels
a day, or 1.6 percent, this year to 87.7 million barrels a day,
according to OPEC. The  International Energy Agency , which
advises consuming nations, said in its monthly report today that
demand will grow by 1.7 percent to 89.3 million barrels.  Crude futures traded above $100 a barrel in London today,
having climbed to a 28-month high of $103.37 on Feb. 3 on
concern that political unrest in North Africa might disrupt
Middle East oil exports. It was at $102.37 as of 10:50 a.m.
London time.  “Supply fears are, however, unfounded, as any halt in
shipments through the  Suez Canal , or the Suez-Mediterranean
pipeline, could be compensated relatively quickly, by rerouting
crude cargoes,” OPEC said. “Even before the crisis, these
routes were not being utilized at full capacity.”  Non-OPEC Supply  OPEC made a “minor revision” to its estimate of supplies
from outside the organization. Non-OPEC exporters will raise
production by 420,000 barrels a day this year to 52.68 million a
day, about 20,000 a day more than the organization had predicted
last month.  The group’s compliance with output quotas agreed to in 2008
fell last month as increased production from Saudi Arabia,  Angola , and the United Arab Emirates offset declines in  Nigeria 
and  Iran .  Daily output from the 11 members bound by quotas rose
138,500 barrels a day to 27.01 million barrels a day in January.
That implies compliance of 48 percent compared with a revised 52
percent in December.  OPEC’s members are Algeria, Angola, Ecuador, Iran, Iraq,
Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar,  Saudi Arabia , the United Arab
Emirates and Venezuela.  Iraq  is exempt from the quota system.  To contact the reporter on this story:
