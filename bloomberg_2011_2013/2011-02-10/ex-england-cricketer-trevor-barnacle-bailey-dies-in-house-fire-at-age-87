Former England and Essex cricket
all-rounder Trevor Bailey died in a fire at his retirement home
in Essex today, the  England  and Wales Cricket Board said.  Bailey, who was 87, played 61 Tests for England between
1949 and 1959 and was renowned for his doggedness and
determination.  At Lord’s in  London  in 1953, he batted for 4 1/2 hours for
71 runs, aided by Willie Watson, as England salvaged a draw
against Australia on its way to regaining the Ashes. That earned
him the nickname “Barnacle.” Five years later he took almost
six hours to reach a half-century in Brisbane.  Bailey, who served as captain and secretary at Essex, also
wrote about cricket and was a member of the British Broadcasting
Corp.’s “Test Match Special” commentary team.  “Trevor Bailey was not only one of the finest all-round
cricketers this country has ever produced, he was also someone
who made an enormous contribution to the game as an
administrator and as a writer and broadcaster,” Giles Clarke,
chairman of the England and Wales Cricket Board, said in a
release. “His loss will be deeply felt by everyone within the
cricket community.”  Bailey’s body was found today in the kitchen of a smoke-
filled flat in Westcliff-on-Sea, the  BBC  reported. His wife
Greta was rescued.  To contact the reporter on this story:
