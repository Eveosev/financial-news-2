  Kenneth Rogoff  of Harvard University
won the Deutsche Bank Prize in Financial Economics for his
“pioneering contributions” to finance and macroeconomics,
notably his work on the origins of crises.  The prize, which went to  Robert Shiller  of Yale University 
in 2009, is worth 50,000 euros ($68,200), the  Center for 
Financial Studies  said in an e-mailed statement.  The jury praised Rogoff, the co-author with Carmen Reinhart
of “This Time Is Different,” for examining how crises develop
and for his work on sovereign debt defaults, global imbalances
and exchange rates.  “Kenneth Rogoff has not only contributed pioneering work
of the greatest academic importance, he has also made his
findings accessible to a broad public,” said jury chairman  Uwe
Walz  of the Center for Financial Studies, a non-profit research
organization in  Frankfurt , in the release.  The prize is sponsored by the Deutsche Bank Donation Fund
and awarded by the Center in partnership with  Goethe University 
Frankfurt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
