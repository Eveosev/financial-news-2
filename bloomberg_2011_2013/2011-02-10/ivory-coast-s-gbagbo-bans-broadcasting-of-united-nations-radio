The radio station controled by the  United Nations ’ mission in  Ivory Coast , ONUCI FM, was banned
from broadcasting by incumbent President  Laurent Gbagbo ,
according to a decree read on state-owned television.  The decision to take the station off the air follows
Gbagbo’s calls for the UN to leave the West African nation, the
decree stated, which was read by Felix Nanihio, general
secretary of the National Broadcasting Council, on
 Radiodiffision Television Ivoirienne  yesterday.  The radio station has not been officially notified of the
ban, said Hamadoun Toure, spokesman for the Abidjan-based UN
mission, in an e-mailed statement today.  Gbagbo, who refuses to cede power following a disputed Nov.
28 election, has told the UN to leave the country several times.
He claims peacekeepers are backing his rival,  Alassane Ouattara ,
the internationally recognized winner of the vote.  As many as 296 people have been killed in violent clashes
that followed the election, said Toure, including 22 deaths
recorded over the past week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
