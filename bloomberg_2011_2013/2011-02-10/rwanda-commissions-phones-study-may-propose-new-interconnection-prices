Rwanda asked PricewaterhouseCoopers
LLP to do a study of its telecommunications industry and propose
new mobile phone interconnection fees, the industry’s regulator
said.  The study, financed by the  World Bank , will probably be
completed in May, Regis Gatarayiha, director general of the
Rwanda Utilities Regulatory Authority, or RURA, said by phone
today from Kigali, the capital.  MTN Rwanda, a unit of  MTN Group Ltd . of  South Africa , is
the East African nation’s biggest mobile-phone operator with 2.2
million subscribers, according to RURA in August.  Millicom
International Cellular SA ’s Rwandan unit, Tigo Rwanda, has
529,114 subscribers and Rwandatel SA has 443,534.  “There is a set of international guidelines on how to
calculate inter-connection rates based on costs,” Tigo Rwanda
Chief Executive Officer Tom Gutjahr said today in an e-mailed
statement. “Tigo Rwanda believes that interconnection rates
will go down and that this will be very beneficial to
subscribers and the general public.”  Rwanda, a tea and coffee-grower, is rebuilding after the
1994 genocide in which 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus were
killed in a period of 100 days, following assassination of
ethnic Hutu President Juvenal Habyarimana.  To contact the reporter on this story:
