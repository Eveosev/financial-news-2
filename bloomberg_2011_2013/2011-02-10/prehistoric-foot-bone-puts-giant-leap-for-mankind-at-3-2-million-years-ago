A prehistoric  foot bone  found in  Ethiopia  shows that human ancestors took a giant step forward in
their evolution as much as 3.2 million years ago, U.S.
researchers say.  The fossil is a fourth metatarsal, one of the long bones in
the foot that connect to the toes, according to a report in the
journal  Science . The bone, found 11 years ago, indicates the
foot had an arch, providing evidence that the species walked on
two feet, instead of swinging from the trees like chimpanzees.
Apes don’t have  permanent arches  on their feet, which gives the
feet more flexibility than humans’ and makes it easier to climb
tree trunks.  The foot bone is from a member of the species A. afarensis,
whose most famous representative is “Lucy,” a 3.2 million-
year-old female whose partial skeleton was found in Ethiopia in
1974. The oldest known human ancestor, a 4.4 million-year-old
member of Ardipithecus ramidus, had feet that were like those of
primates who lived in trees.  “Understanding that the foot arches appeared very early in
our evolution shows that the unique structure of our feet is
fundamental to human locomotion,” said  Carol Ward , an author of
the report, who’s an anatomist at the  University of Missouri  in
Columbia, in a statement. “Arches in our feet were just as
important for our ancestors as they are for us.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
