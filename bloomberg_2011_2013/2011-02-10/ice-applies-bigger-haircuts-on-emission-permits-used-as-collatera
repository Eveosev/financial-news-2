ICE Futures  Europe , the biggest
exchange for carbon trading, is requiring traders to put up more
collateral when they use carbon permits to back up positions.  The clearing house for the London-based exchange started
using a bigger discount, known as a “haircut,” on European
Union allowances and United Nations emissions credits when they
are used as collateral, ICE said in a  circular on its website
dated Feb. 4 . The new discount as of yesterday is 32.5 percent,
up from 25 percent before.  “The haircuts announced were part of routine activity
carried out by the clearing house, resulting in changes to
different products,” Elaine Bailey, a spokeswoman for the
exchange, said today in an e-mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
