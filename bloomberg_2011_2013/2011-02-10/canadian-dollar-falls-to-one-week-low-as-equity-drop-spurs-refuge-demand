The Canadian dollar rose versus most
of its major counterparts as economic reports showed evidence of
North American recovery.  The loonie, as the currency is nicknamed, advanced for the
first time in four days versus the euro as  Canada ’s new-home
price index rose and U.S. initial jobless claims fell to the
lowest level since July 2008. The Canadian dollar dropped to a
one-week low versus the greenback as the extra yield investors
receive to hold 10-year U.S. notes instead of Canadian debt was
within two basis points of the highest level this year.  “Canada is trading very much in tandem with the dollar,”
said  Jack Spitz , managing director of foreign exchange at
National  Bank of Canada  in Toronto. “Over the past several
weeks, the Canadian dollar itself is trading more as a North
American currency.”  The loonie appreciated 0.8 percent to C$1.3538 per euro at
5 p.m. in Toronto, from C$1.3648 yesterday. Canada’s currency
slid 0.2 percent to 99.53 cents per  U.S. dollar , from 99.38,
after touching 99.88, the weakest level since Feb. 1. The loonie
touched 98.32 cents on Feb. 4, the strongest since May 2008.  Canadian bonds dropped, pushing the yield on the 10-year
benchmark up two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 3.47
percent. The price of the 3.5 percent security maturing in June
2020 fell 15 cents to C$100.27.  U.S. Yield Spread  The yield spread between 10-year U.S. Treasuries and
Canadian debt widened to 23 basis points, making debt
denominated in the greenback more attractive to international
investors. The difference was 25 basis points on Feb. 8, the
widest since Dec. 28. The yield on the U.S. 10-year note gained
five basis points to 3.70 percent.  “The sentiment in the market has really become watching
yields rather than just economics, and U.S. Treasury yields are
rising,” Spitz said.  U.S. first-time applications for jobless benefits decreased
last week by 36,000, more than forecast, to 383,000, the Labor
Department said today. That is the lowest level since July 2008.  “It will likely leave Canada and  Mexico  outperforming on
the non-U.S. dollar crosses,” said  Camilla Sutton , head of
currency strategy at Bank of Nova Scotia in Toronto.  Mexico’s peso rallied 1 percent to 16.4240 versus the euro,
from 16.5872 yesterday. The peso traded at 12.1328 versus the
Canadian dollar, compared with 12.1559.  Canada’s new home price index rose 0.1 percent in December,  Statistics Canada  said today. Gains were led by a 1.1 percent
increase in Winnipeg, Manitoba, after the province introduced
new building-code regulations. Prices in the Toronto region were
up 0.2 percent.  Housing will become a drag on economic growth this year,
the Bank of Canada  predicts . Housing investment has slowed after
the government ended temporary stimulus measures.  To contact the reporter for this story:
