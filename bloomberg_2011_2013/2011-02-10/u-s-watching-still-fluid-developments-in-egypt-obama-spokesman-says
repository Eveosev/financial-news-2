The Obama administration is
gathering information on a “very fluid situation” in Egypt
amid reports that President  Hosni Mubarak  is preparing to step
down, White House press secretary  Robert Gibbs  said.  President Barack Obama is getting updates from his national
security staff and was monitoring news reports from the country
as he traveled to an event in Marquette, Michigan, Gibbs told
reporters aboard Air Force One.  Gibbs wouldn’t confirm reports that Mubarak was planning to
step down.  The U.S. priority continues to be an “orderly transition”
in Egypt leading to free and fair elections, Gibbs said. Until
“irreversible change comes” in Egypt, the crowds of protesters
will continue to expand, Gibbs said.  Mubarak plans to address his nation tonight, Egypt’s state-
run Al Masriya television reported. A spokesman for his Cabinet
said in Cairo that the Egyptian leader will decide “within
hours” whether to step down.  “What we have wanted to see and most importantly what the
people of Egypt wanted to see was irreversible change and we
will monitor throughout the day,” Gibbs said. Obama may speak
about the situation there “depending on what happens” during
the day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
