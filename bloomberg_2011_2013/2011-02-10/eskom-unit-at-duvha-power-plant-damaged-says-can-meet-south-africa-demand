Eskom Holdings Ltd. said its Duvha
Power Station was damaged when a 600 megawatt unit was taken
down to perform a routine turbine test late yesterday.  All five units of the 3,600 megawatt power plant are
running normally, the Johannesburg-based state-owned South
African electricity utility said in an e-mailed statement today.
Eskom is currently producing enough power to meet demand and the
unit will take “an extensive time to repair,” it added.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
