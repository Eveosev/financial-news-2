Corn rose to a 30-month high for a
second day on signs that global demand is increasing for
supplies from the U.S., the world’s largest grower and exporter.  The  U.S. Department of Agriculture   reported  export sales in
the week ended Feb. 3 were 51 percent above the average during
the prior four weeks. The USDA said yesterday that U.S.
inventories before the harvest will be equal to about 18 days of
consumption, on par with the record low in 1996. Prices have
jumped 87 percent in the past year.  “Export sales were very good last week,” said Brian Grete, the senior market analyst for Professional Farmers of
America newsletter in  Cedar Falls ,  Iowa . “Yesterday, the USDA
told the market that prices need to go higher to slow demand.”  Corn futures for March delivery rose 0.5 cent, or 0.1
percent, to close at $6.985 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the Chicago
Board of Trade, after touching $7.045, the highest for the most-
active futures since July 2008.  “The market is bidding up the prices now to encourage
farmers to plant more,” Grete said.  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $48.6 billion in
2009, followed by soybeans at $31.8 billion, government data
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
