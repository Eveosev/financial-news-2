Egyptian President  Hosni Mubarak 
will hand over authority to Vice-President Omar Suleiman and
announce five constitutional amendments, according to Dubai-
based  Al Arabiya  TV.  Mubarak, who is due to address the nation shortly, will
also apologize to the families of the victims of the unrest and
may cancel the long-standing emergency law, Al Arabiya said,
without saying where it got the information.  The handover to the vice president will be in line with
the constitution, according to Mubarak, Al Arabiya reported.
He will confirm that he won't run for a second term and that 
he will pave the way for holding clean elections, Al Arabiya
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
