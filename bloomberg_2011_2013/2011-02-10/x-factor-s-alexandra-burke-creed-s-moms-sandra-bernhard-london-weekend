Alexandra Burke  is in  London  with
her “All Night Long Tour,” determined to prove there is life
after “The X Factor.”  The 22-year-old, who won the U.K. television contest in
2008, performs hits “Bad Boys” and “Start Without You” as
disco lights beam on her spandex dress. Expect dance-hall
reggae, tracks from Burke’s planned second album, and her most
famous number: a cover of Leonard Cohen’s “Hallelujah.”  IndigO2, Peninsula Square, SE10 0DX. Information:

Britain, is now fixating on a woman’s bubbies.  The art world’s emperor has thought hard and come up with a
black-and-white film, seductively titled “Work No. 1071,”
which zooms in on a nipple. After many a still moment, the
woman’s hand gives it a forceful shake.  As you may remember, he once exhibited a crumpled piece of
paper.  The showstopper at  Hauser & Wirth  is a spinning, motor-
powered neon inscription -- “MOTHERS” -- that speeds up as if
to whack you in the face, then slows.  Hauser & Wirth is on 23 Savile Row, W1S 2ET. Information:
 http://www.hauserwirth.com  or +44-20-7287-2300.  Cecconi’s, near Savile Row, is a fashionable Italian
restaurant with a Mayfair address reflected in its clientele and
prices. Busy day and night, it’s popular for breakfast, when you
can have black-truffle scrambled eggs with your cappuccino. Or
there’s brunch, with calamari fritti and a glass of Prosecco.

just transferred to the  West End .  Bruce Norris’s “ Clybourne Park ” follows the mutations of
a house in suburban America as the demographics change. White
neighbors in 1959 try to stop its sale to a “colored” family.
Black neighbors in 2009 try to prevent its flattening by a white
family.  In either case, small talk turns to straight talk as the
two sides acknowledge the elephant in the room: race.  “Clybourne Park,” nominated for several Olivier Awards
including best director and best new play, is at Wyndham’s
Theatre. Information:  http://www.delfontmackintosh.co.uk  or
+44-844-482-5120.  J Sheekey, around the corner, is perfect for a bite.
There’s a pretheater offer of fish and chips and a glass of wine
for 16.50 pounds ($26.50). Or there’s the Oyster Bar next door,
with a Fashion Week offer of half-a-dozen oysters and a glass of
Pol Roger Pure for 15.75 pounds from Feb. 14-27. Information:
 http://www.j-sheekey.co.uk/  or +44-20-7240-2565.  Sunday  A dancing Carmen brings her cigarette girls and men in
uniform to  Sadler’s Wells .  Compania Aida Gomez’s “Carmen” is part of the flamenco
festival (through Feb. 19), which this year also stars  Spain ’s
two greatest female dancers. Rocio Molina performs lightning
footwork in sweat pants, puffing on a cigarillo; Eva Yerbabuena
introduces a potter’s wheel into her emotive choreography.  Information:  http://www.sadlerswells.com  or
+44-844-412-4300.  Alternatively, comedienne Sandra Bernhard is in town with
her mix of laughs and rock ‘n’ roll. Past victims of her
lampooning: Madonna, a onetime friend, and Sarah Palin, the
wolf-shooting, moose-eating presidential aspirant.  Information:  http://www.leicestersquaretheatre.com/  or
