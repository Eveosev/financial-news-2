  Greece  joined  Italy  in objecting to
annual numerical debt-reduction targets in a fresh challenge to
the German-led drive for tougher economic safeguards to underpin
the euro.  Greece, the first deficit-riddled euro country to fall back
on financial aid, says the proposed rule would force it to make
impossibly large cuts once its support package runs out in 2013,
according to a draft of European Union legislation.  “All member states except two already accepted the
proposal,” said an EU briefing note obtained by Bloomberg News
before next week’s debate among finance ministers. “Italy and
Greece have a reserve on the numerical benchmark.”  Greece or Italy alone could veto the rule, undercutting the
tougher enforcement demanded by  Germany  as a condition for
beefing up the 750 billion-euro ($1 trillion) rescue fund for
distressed states.  The rule, proposed by the  European Commission , would
require countries with debt above the EU ceiling of 60 percent
of gross domestic product to make annual cuts equal to 1/20th of
the excess, or to face sanctions.  The yield spread between Greek 10-year bonds and 10-year
German bunds, a measure of risk, widened 8 basis points to 819
basis points today. The measure reached an all-time high of 974
basis points on Jan. 11.  Greece, now benefiting from an EU-led 110 billion-euro aid
program, overtook Italy as  Europe ’s most indebted country in
2007. Its debt of 140.2 percent of GDP in 2010 is set to balloon
to 156 percent of GDP in 2012, the EU forecasts.  Repayment Load  Starting at that level, Greece would have to pay off the
debt at an annual rate of 5 percentage points, a pace that
economically healthier  Belgium  couldn’t manage during more than
a decade of debt reduction until 2007.  The bailout terms require Greece to reduce its deficit from
15.4 percent of GDP in 2009 to less than 3 percent in 2014.
That’s about 12 percent of GDP through to 2015, according to a
December 2010 report by the  International Monetary Fund .  Greece “remains absolutely committed to reducing the
public debt -- including subscribing to annual reduction
targets,” said a statement today by Greek Finance Minister  George Papaconstantinou .  European finance ministers will square off over the debt
rules at a Feb. 14-15 meeting, seeking to ready a comprehensive
anti-crisis package in time for a March 11 leaders summit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
