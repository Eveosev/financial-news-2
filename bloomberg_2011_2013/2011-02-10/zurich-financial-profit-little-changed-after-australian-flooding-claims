  Zurich Financial Services AG ,  Switzerland â€™s biggest insurer, said fourth-quarter profit was
little changed after general insurance margins were squeezed by
claims from flooding in  Australia .  Net income was $1.04 billion compared with a restated $1.03
billion a year earlier, according to Bloomberg calculations that
were confirmed by the Zurich-based insurer. The average estimate
of eight analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was $1.02 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
