  Kenya â€™s yield on 91-day Treasury
bills rose at an auction of the debt today as demand for the
securities outstripped supply, the central bank said.  The yield increased to 2.595 percent from 2.555 percent at
the previous sale, the Nairobi-based central bank said in an e-
mailed statement today.  The bank accepted offers totalling 2.6 billion shillings
and had offered 2.5 billion shillings of the securities, it
said. It received 2.8 billion shillings of bids.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
