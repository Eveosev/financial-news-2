Jerry Sloan of the  Utah Jazz , the
longest-tenured coach in the  National Basketball Association ,
resigned in the middle of his 23rd season, the team announced
today in a news conference.  Sloan, who took over the Jazz in 1988 when Frank Layden
retired, had signed a one-year extension on Feb. 7. Jazz
assistant coach Phil Johnson also stepped down.  Sloan, 68, has a career record of 1,221-803 and led the
Jazz to the NBA finals in 1997 and 1998, losing both series to
the Chicago Bulls and Michael Jordan. He was inducted into the
Pro Basketball Hall of Fame as a coach in 2009.  Sloan has 1,127 career wins with the Jazz and is the only
coach in NBA history with more than 1,100 victories for a single
franchise.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
