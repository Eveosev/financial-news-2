Guinea , the worldâ€™s biggest bauxite
exporter, plans to spend $100 million on improving energy
transmission to meet growing demand for electricity, said Energy
Minister Papa Koly Kourouma.  The energy needs just for Conakry, the capital, are 200
megawatts, while national production is currently 48 megawatts,
he told reporters in the city yesterday.  Grid upgrades in Conakry and surrounding cities will
improve the system, which has been poorly maintained amid
financial shortfalls and corruption, Kourouma said.  Guinea also plans to rehabilitate its five thermal  power
plants  and four hydroelectric facilities, he added, without
providing details.  To contact the reporter on this story:
