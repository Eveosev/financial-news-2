(Corrects first paragraph of a story published Feb. 10 to
say Emaar made a profit in the period.)    Emaar Properties PJSC , the biggest
developer in the  United Arab Emirates , reported a fourth-quarter
profit that was lower than analysts estimated on writedowns
related to troubled lenders Amlak Finance PJSC and Dubai Bank.  Net income declined 62 percent to 274 million dirhams ($75
million) from 720 million dirhams a year earlier, the company
said in a statement today. The average estimate of six analysts
in a Bloomberg survey was for a profit of 662.5 million dirhams.
Impairments and provisions more than doubled to 417 million
dirhams.  Emaar, which owns a 45 percent stake in Islamic mortgage
provider Amlak, has outstanding loans of 772.6 million dirhams
to the company, which was barred from trading in November 2008.
Losses from the company’s financial operations were partly
offset by rising rental income from hotels and apartments.  Revenue increased to 3.8 billion dirhams from 2.98 billion
dirhams. Operating profit, which excludes the writedowns and
provisions, was little changed from a year earlier at 691
million dirhams.  “The impairments related to Amlak were expected by the
market,” said Ahmed Badr, an analyst at Credit Suisse. “The
company’s operating revenue is very strong, beating my estimates
by 7 percent. That shows the rental portfolio is contributing
significantly to Emaar’s revenue, around 24 percent in 2010.”  The developer, which opened the 200-story Burj Khalifa in
January 2010, handed over 770 units in the residential and
commercial tower and 3,500 units in total. Buyers in Dubai pay
for apartments based on how much work is completed, with a final
amount due when keys are handed over.  International Projects  “We see 2011 to be a signature year for Emaar with
significant revenue streams from international operations
kicking in,” Chairman Mohammed Alabbar said in the statement.
This year, the company expects to hand over properties to buyers
in developments such as Jeddah Gate and Al Khobar Lakes in  Saudi
Arabia  as well as at projects in Turkey and  Egypt .  Nomura Holdings Inc. Analyst Chet Riley estimated that
Emaar will have impairments amounting to 500 million dirhams
relating to Amlak in 2011. He said Emaar’s stake in the lender
“in reality could be written down to zero.”  Emaar shares fell 1.2 percent to 3.25 dirhams today before
the results were announced. That extends the decline to 8.5
percent this year.  The developer said in January that it sold $500 million in
Islamic bonds and the company raised the same amount in December
to repay short-term loans. The developer plans to raise $2
billion in total.  To contact the reporter on this story:
