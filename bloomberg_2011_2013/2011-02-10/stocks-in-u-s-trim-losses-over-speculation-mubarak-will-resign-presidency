U.S. stocks erased losses amid
speculation Egyptian President  Hosni Mubarak  will meet
protesters’ demands to step down, ending a political crisis that
threatened to spread throughout the Middle East.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose less than 0.1 percent
to 1,321.3 at 11:39 a.m. in  New York  after tumbling as much as
0.7 percent earlier. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 16.12
points, or 0.1 percent, to 12,222.77, reversing most of an 83-
point tumble.  “Even the possibility of Mubarak stepping down will have a
positive effect on the markets,” said Mark Turner, head of
U.S. sales trading at Instinet in New York, which handles about
4 percent of U.S. equity trading volume. “Any step in the
right direction toward a peaceful resolution is good for the
markets.”  Earlier declines came after Cisco Systems Inc.’s earnings
forecast and profit margin trailed analysts’ estimates and
concern grew that accelerating global inflation will trigger
higher  interest rates .  Mubarak will decide “within hours” whether he will step
down or not, according to cabinet spokesman  Magdy Rady .  “The decision was not taken yet,” Rady said when asked if
the president plans to step down today. “The decision will be
taken within hours by the governing bodies of the country and by
the authorities of the country and by the president of the
country. He has to decide himself whether he leaves or not.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
