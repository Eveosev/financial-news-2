(Corrects 2006 ranking in 27th paragraph in story published
Feb. 11.)  German  Chancellor Angela Merkel  has
filled one third of her ministerial positions with women.  Deutsche Bank AG  Chief Executive Officer  Josef Ackermann  doesn’t
have a single female on the 12-member group executive committee
that oversees the nation’s biggest bank.  Fresh from a scrap over making bond investors help cover
the costs of bailing out European banks, Ackermann angered
Merkel’s ministers by saying last week that his board “will be
more colorful and prettier” with a woman. Consumer minister
Ilse Aigner responded by telling  Handelsblatt  newspaper that
“if it’s more color or beauty you want, you should go to a
flower garden or a museum.”  At Germany’s 30 largest companies, just four of 186
management board positions are held by women, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Barbara Kux, 56,  Siemens AG ’s head of
global supply chain management, became the first woman in 12
years to sit on a board when she was appointed in 2008. The lack
of women in top management is a “scandal,” Merkel said at a
Feb. 8 conference in Berlin.  “We should do much better than that,” said Barbara
Bierach, author of the 2002 book “Das Daemliche Geschlecht,”
or  The Stupid Sex , which attempts to explain why there are few
female managers in Germany.  The nation lags behind in  Europe , where some governments
have set quotas to improve the balance of female representation
in corporate management. Norway was first, in 2003, to enforce
female minimums. Spain followed in 2007 with its own
legislation, and  France  plans to impose a 20 percent quota by
2012 and 40 percent by 2016 for its 2,500 biggest companies.  Waiting and Watching  Merkel, who has opposed quotas, said at the Berlin
conference that she’ll give German companies “one last chance”
to confront the issue before her government enforces change.  At the European Union’s biggest publicly traded companies,
one of every 10 board members is a woman, the European
Commission said in a gender equality report published last
March. In  Norway , 42 percent of board members at the country’s
largest companies are women.  Women account for about 12 percent of board members at
France’s benchmark CAC 40 Index companies, according to a study
published last October by Ernst & Young and France Proxy. By
contrast, only 3.2 percent of women hold management board
positions at Germany’s 200 biggest companies, according to a
Jan. 18 study by the Berlin-based DIW economic institute. The
proportion is 2.9 percent at the country’s largest banks, up
just half a percentage point since 2006, the report said.  Euro Peripherals  “The problem is that in certain areas, like banks and
insurers, they like to recruit terribly nice young ladies,”
said Sybille Busch, who has run an executive consulting firm in
Hamburg since the mid-1980s. “If you recruit lambs, they stay
lambs, and you can’t make wolves out of them.”  Merkel, 56, and Ackermann, 63, have disagreed publicly over
how to fix the sovereign-debt crisis that has already led to the
financial rescues of  Greece  and Ireland. Merkel has called on
bond investors to shoulder the cost of future sovereign
bailouts, prompting Ackermann in November to say the
chancellor’s remarks were roiling markets and raising borrowing
costs.  German lenders hold more than 112 billion euros ($152
billion) of debt issued by the governments of Greece, Ireland,  Portugal ,  Spain  and  Italy , according to Bloomberg data.  The spat over how to save peripheral Europe comes less than
three years since Merkel and Ackermann worked together to help
stave off the collapse of commercial-property lender Hypo Real
Estate Holding AG in what would have been the country’s biggest
bank failure since 1931.  Ackermann Initiative  Ackermann started a campaign two years ago to promote women
at Frankfurt-based Deutsche Bank, according to company spokesman
Christoph Blumenthal. Eileen Taylor, the bank’s global head of
diversity, said in an e-mail that Ackermann’s support has
boosted diversity programs at the company.  “Joe knows that diversity is a business imperative and
that diverse teams are smarter teams and lead to stronger
business results,” Taylor wrote in the e-mail.  Deutsche Bank didn’t have a woman executive to send to the  World Economic Forum  conference in Davos last month, even after
organizers offered the company an extra slot. Ackermann’s
“prettier” comment was made Feb. 3 after the bank reported
2010 earnings. He also said during the presentation that “it’s
unbelievably important that we succeed in bringing more women
into management positions.”  Deutsche Bank  Ellen Ruth Schneider-Lenne was a member of Deutsche Bank’s
management board from 1988 until her death in 1996. Schneider-
Lenne, who was responsible for risk, also was the first female
to become a top executive at a major German bank.  About 44 percent of Deutsche Bank’s employees are women,
and 16 percent hold managing director or director positions,
according to Deutsche Bank’s latest figures.  Ackermann initiated a program entitled Atlas, which selects
20 women each year from Deutsche Bank’s business units and
geographical regions “to groom suitable candidates for the
bank’s top management,” the company said in its 2009 corporate
sustainability report.  Merkel has rejected calls by her labor minister, Ursula von
der Leyen, to impose a 30 percent quota, saying German companies
should do more to promote women from within. Family minister
Kristina Schroeder said she would force companies above a
certain size to set and publish quotas for women on management
and supervisory boards as a first step.    Germany ’s half-day school system and its affluence relative
to other countries make it difficult for women to juggle
motherhood and a career, and mean it’s “much easier to stay at
home,” Bierach said in a telephone interview from Sydney where
she now lives.  DAX 30  Deutsche Telekom AG introduced a quota a year ago for women
in management positions, becoming the first DAX 30 company to do
so. The former German telecommunications monopoly, based in
Bonn, aims to increase the proportion of women in upper and mid-
level executive posts to 30 percent by the end of 2015, it said
in a March 15  statement .  Siemens, based in Munich, has two female executives on its
eight-member board. Software company  SAP AG  and power company  E.ON AG  each have one. Stuttgart-based Daimler AG plans to
appoint constitutional judge Christine Hohmann-Dennhardt to its
management board to head compliance as early as next week,
according to people familiar with the situation.  Merck KGaA in Darmstadt said yesterday it will increase the
proportion of women in management to as much as 30 percent by
2016 from 22 percent.  Raven Mother  Female leadership is more common among family-owned German
enterprises, where women run 25 percent of the companies, a
report by the Bonn-based  Intes Academy for Family-Owned
Companies  said.  German women “who dare to have a career” are often
criticized by their peers, said Bierach, the author of the
Stupid Sex. The German term “Rabenmutter,” or raven mother, is
a derogative word used to describe women who leave the nest to
go to work. There is no male equivalent. The Nazi regime used to
award a Mothers Cross as part of  Adolf Hitler ’s plan to
encourage Aryan  population growth .  “There’s a terrible legacy from the Nazi period,” Bierach
said. “It’s a deep-seated culture problem. You’re a raven
mother if you don’t make the spaghetti yourself.”  Germany has slipped to 13th place in the World Economic
Forum’s latest Global Gender Gap report, which ranks 134
countries on 14 measures of treatment of and opportunities for
men and women, published in October. It ranked fifth in 2006.  Iceland had the highest score last year, while the U.S.
made the top 20 for the first time, at 19th place. Yemen was in
last place.  To contact the reporter on this story:
