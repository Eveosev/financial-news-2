Treasuries fell after the U.S. sold
$16 billion of 30-year bonds, the last of three note and bond
auctions this week totaling $72 billion, amid concern inflation
will accelerate as the labor market strengthens.  Yields on 30-year bonds were at almost the highest in
10 months as the amount of bids at the bond sale was less than
the average for the past 10 auctions. Treasuries earlier fell as
first-time claims for  unemployment insurance  declined to the
lowest since July 2008. The Federal Reserve released an updated
schedule for its $600 billion debt-buying plan, known as
quantitative easing, to bolster the economy.  “The bias seems to be towards higher rates now with
economic numbers generally coming in better than expected, and
the market is looking toward the end of QE2,” said Larry Milstein, managing director in New York of government debt
trading at R.W. Pressprich & Co., a fixed-income broker and
dealer for institutional investors. “People are getting
defensive and positioning themselves for higher rates.”  The yield on the 30-year bond rose five basis points, or
0.05 percentage point, to 4.77 percent at 5:01 p.m. in  New York ,
according to BGCantor Market Data. Yesterday it reached 4.79
percent, the most since April 12. The price of the 4.25 percent
bond maturing in November 2040 fell 25/32, or $7.81 per $1,000
face value, to 91 27/32.  Ten-year note yields gained five basis points to 3.7
percent.  Buy Plans  The Fed said today it plans to buy about $97 billion of
Treasuries in 18 operations from Feb. 11 through March 9, as it
continues its debt-purchase plan. Thus far, the central bank has
purchased $320.7 billion of Treasuries. The Fed has held its
short-term interest rate target at almost zero since December
2008.  “We are seeing a little softening as the Fed is buying
significantly less this time than they did last time, which took
the bid out of the market,” said  Sean Murphy , Treasury trader
in New York at Societe Generale, a primary dealer. “Last time
they purchased $112 billion while this time they are only
purchasing $97 billion.”  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  told the House Budget
Committee yesterday that while the declines in the jobless rate
in December and January “do provide some grounds for
optimism,” he cautioned that “it will be several years before
the  unemployment rate  has returned to a more normal level.”  Treasury said today it will sell $9 billion in 30-year
inflation-indexed bonds Feb. 17.  Bid Numbers  The bid-to-cover ratio at the 30-year bond sale, which
gauges demand by comparing total bids with the amount of
securities offered, was 2.51, compared with the average at the
last 10 auctions was 2.68.  Indirect bidders, a class of investors that includes
foreign central banks, bought 43.1 percent of the bonds,
compared with 37.8 percent in January. The average for the past
10 sales is 38.29 percent.  Direct bidders, non-primary-dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, purchased 8 percent of
the debt, compared with 12.4 percent at the January offering and
a 10-sale average of 15.10 percent. The 30-year bonds at the
auction yielded 4.750 percent, compared with an average estimate
of 4.729 percent in a Bloomberg News survey of 11 of the  Federal
Reserve ’s 20 primary dealers.  Curve Costs  “The back end of the curve has cheapened up a lot to where
people see value at these yield levels,” said Scott Sherman, an
interest-rate strategist at Credit Suisse Group AG in New York,
a primary dealer. “Foreign accounts seem to be moving out the
curve to pick up yield. Demand is still there.” The so-called
yield curve measures the difference between yields of different
maturities.  Thirty-year bonds yielded 4.515 percent at the previous
offering on Jan. 13. The bond returned 8.7 percent in 2010,
compared with 5.9 percent for the overall Treasury market,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes.  The U.S. this week auctioned $32 billion of three-year debt
on Feb. 8 at a yield of 1.349 percent, the highest since May. It
sold $24 billion of 10-year securities yesterday at a yield of
3.665 percent, the highest since April and a record 71.3 percent
awarded to indirect bidders.  Applications for jobless benefits decreased by 36,000, more
than forecast, to 383,000 in the week ended Feb. 4, Labor
Department figures showed today. Economists forecast claims
would fall to 410,000, according to the median estimate in a
Bloomberg News survey.  Consumer Mood  The  University of Michigan  consumer sentiment index rose to
75 this month from 74.2 in January, according to the median
forecast of economists in a Bloomberg survey before the report
tomorrow.  Treasury 30-year bonds have lost 5.1 percent this year,
compared with 8.7 percent gain last year for the overall
Treasury market, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch
data.  Deutsche Bank AG, a primary dealer, said it adjusted its
yield forecasts for a possible move to 4 percent on Treasury 10-
year note yields.  While yields may move higher, “most of the sell-off is
behind us,” the firm wrote in a research note today. An
increase in expectations for economic growth makes it more
confident that the Fed will increase interest rates by the end
of the year, Deutsche Bank wrote.  To contact the reporters on this story:
