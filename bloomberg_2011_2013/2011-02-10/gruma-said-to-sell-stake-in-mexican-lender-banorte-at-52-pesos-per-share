Gruma SAB sold its stake in lender
Grupo Financiero Banorte SAB at 52 pesos per share, according to
two people familiar with the matter.  Gruma,  Mexico â€™s largest maker of corn flour for tortillas,
sold 161.4 million shares in the lender, the people said.  Underwriters have the option to later buy as much as 16.1
million shares through the overallotment option, known as the
greenshoe, to boost the total to 177.5 million shares, according
to the prospectus. Including the overallotment, the sale would
represent 8.8 percent of the common shares in Banorte.  To contact the reporter on this story:
