Copper rebounded from its biggest
decline in two weeks on renewed speculation that a global
deficit will erode stockpiles and support prices that reached an
all-time high earlier this week.  Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange rose as
much as 0.7 percent to $9,995 a metric ton and was at $9,974 at
2:21 p.m. in  Singapore . It fell 1.3 percent yesterday, the most
since Jan. 25, after the People’s Bank of  China  raised borrowing
costs before a report next week that may show inflation
accelerated. The price peaked at $10,160 a ton on Feb. 7.  “We consider any pullbacks as temporary as Chinese
consumption growth is set to remain robust while supply fails to
keep up,” Credit Suisse Group AG analysts Stefan Graber and Jun Hao Tan wrote in a note today. The International Copper Study
Group is predicting a 435,000-ton deficit this year.  May-delivery metal on the Shanghai Futures Exchange gained
as much as 0.5 percent to 75,940 yuan ($11,531) a ton, before
trading at 75,800 yuan a ton. Futures in  New York  climbed for
the first day in four, by as much as 0.8 percent, to $4.5585 a
pound and last traded at $4.55 a pound.  “China can hike interest rates as many times as it likes
and it won’t have much impact if the U.S. continues to maintain
a loose monetary policy,” Ju Guoxian, an analyst at First
Capital Futures Co., said from Shenzhen. “We’ll still get
growth, albeit lower than some might hope for, and that’s going
to keep the copper balance negative.”  Stimulus Program  Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said yesterday
that U.S. unemployment rate is likely to remain high “for some
time” and the extent to which the recovery is established and
inflation is pointing higher or lower will help determine
whether the Fed expands or pulls back on its stimulus program.  On Nov. 3, the central bank announced that it would embark
on a second round of asset purchases to help boost the recovery.
The program, slated to last through June, follows $1.7 trillion
of purchases of mortgage and government debt through last March.  Aluminum in  London  shed 0.2 percent to $2,540 a ton,
lead lost 0.9 percent to $2,497.50 a ton and tin fell 0.2
percent to $31,200 a ton. Zinc and nickel were little changed at
$2,455 a ton and $28,340 a ton respectively.  The dollar climbed for the first time in four days against
a six-currency basket including the euro and yen, “weighing on
other metals that don’t have the same kind of bullish
fundamentals that copper does,” said Ju.  To contact the reporter on this story:
