PKN Orlen SA, Poland’s largest oil
refiner, said fourth-quarter profit advanced 79 percent as  oil
prices  rose, processing volumes increased and margins widened.  Net income climbed to 541 million zloty ($189 million) from
302.1 million zloty a year earlier, Orlen said in a regulatory
statement today. That compares with the 512.3 million-zloty
average estimate by 10 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Earnings before interest and taxes jumped to 746.8 million
zloty from 333.7 million zloty. Plock-based Orlen said Jan. 26
that fourth-quarter Ebit would exceed 700 million zloty.  Orlen’s 2010 Ebit tripled from 2009 as the company focused
on improving its debt ratios, after the ratio of net debt to
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization
exceeded the maximum in bank covenants.  This year PKN plans to complete the sale of its 24 percent
stake in Polkomtel SA,  Poland ’s largest mobile phone company,
helping it reduce debt and start investing in oil extraction.
Orlen expects preliminary bids in the first quarter, it said in
a separate  presentation  on its website.  In the fourth quarter Orlen increased total processing in
its refineries in Poland, the  Czech Republic , and Lithuania by
14 percent to 7.54 million tons from a year earlier, while the
refining margin widened by 50 percent.  Oil prices increased 14 percent during the period, pushing
up the value of reserves in Orlen’s tanks and adding about 500
million zloty to the company’s operating profit for the three
months ended on Dec. 31, PKN said Jan. 26.  To contact the reporter on this story:
