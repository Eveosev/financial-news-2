Rio Tinto Group, the world’s third-
largest mining company, said second-half profit more than
tripled as a global economic recovery boosted prices for  iron
ore  and copper.  Net income rose to $8.5 billion in the six months ended
Dec. 31 from $2.4 billion a year earlier, the London-based
company said today in a statement. That compares with the $8.6
billion average estimate of 12 analysts Bloomberg surveyed. The
company also announced a $5 billion share buyback by the end of
next year as full-year earnings also tripled to $14.3 billion.  Chief Executive Officer Tom Albanese plans $13 billion of
spending on expansion and new mines this year to boost output as
commodity prices rise. Rio is being urged to increase returns on
funds as global economic recovery adds to its cash pile, fueling
a reversal in fortunes after the 2007 acquisition of Alcan Inc.
that led to a crippling $40 billion of debt.  “GDP growth in emerging markets and supply constraints
mean the general market and pricing outlook for commodities
remain positive, albeit with elevated risk,” Albanese said
today in the statement.   Rio Tinto  is reinvigorated, running
strongly and benefiting from favorable markets  Rio declared a final dividend of 63 cents a share after
declaring an interim dividend in August of 45 cents.  Rio rose 0.3 percent to A$88.68 at the close of Sydney
trading today. The stock, also traded in  London , has 29 ‘‘buy,’’
one ‘‘hold’’ and two ‘‘sell’’ recommendations among analyst
ratings compiled by Bloomberg.  The price achieved for Rio’s sales of iron ore jumped 67
percent in 2010, UBS AG said in a Feb. 8 report. The price of
copper was 47 percent higher, UBS said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
