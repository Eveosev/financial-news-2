Russian oil production growth is
close to “impossible” because of rising costs and field
depletion, Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. analysts said.    Russia , the world’s largest oil producer, increased output
2 percent to about 10 million barrels a day last year mostly
driven by OAO Rosneft’s Vankor field,  Oswald Clint  and Alex
Prokofjevs, Sanford analysts, wrote today in an e-mailed report.
Extraction may continue to increase through 2012 and start to
decline from 2013.  The Russian oil industry continues to be “a rising-cost
no-growth story,” the analysts wrote. “Outside of the heavily
subsidized East Siberia, little is happening to suggest that the
privately owned operators have found an economically viable way
to minimize their West Siberian decline rates.”  Prime Minister Vladimir Putin yesterday urged the
government to accelerate work on tax breaks for new  oil fields 
to help maintain the nation’s output at a post-Soviet record
level. He forecast extraction to remain at about 10.1 million
barrels a day in coming years.  “With Vankor still flowing and setting a new base, but
zero new field start-ups this year,” output will rise 0.6
percent in 2011, “before falling into negative territory by
2013,” the analysts wrote. “Only major  tax reform  could alter
this view though none of the companies appear to be shifting
their portfolios in a direction which suggests it is imminent.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
