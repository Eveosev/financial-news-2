  Thomson Reuters Corp ., the financial

rose 24 percent, as sales of legal and tax and accounting
products increased.  Net income advanced to $225 million, or 27 cents a share,
from $182 million, or 21 cents, a year earlier, the New York-

and fell 4 percent at the investment and advisory division,
which together account for 42 percent of the total. Sales of
legal products advanced 8 percent.  Total sales rose 3 percent to $3.46 billion, compared with
the $3.44 billion average analystsâ€™ estimate.    Thomson Reuters  fell C$1.10, or 2.7 percent, to C$39.96 at
