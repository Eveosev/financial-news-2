The money spent by tourists
visiting  Singapore  surged last year after a record number of
people travelled to the city-state, attracted by two new
casinos amid a rebound in the global economy.  Spending rose 49 percent to S$18.8 billion ($14.7
billion) last year, exceeding the government’s forecast of as
much as S$18.5 billion, the  Singapore Tourism Board  said in a
statement today. International visitor arrivals rose 20
percent to 11.6 million in 2010.  Record tourist arrivals are benefitting companies from  Singapore Airlines Ltd . to hotel operator Shangri-La Asia Ltd.
after the government scrapped a four-decade ban on casinos to
help shed what Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong called an
“unexciting” image. The city aims to attract 17 million
tourists annually by 2015 and boost visitor spending to S$30
billion in the same period.  Singapore’s first casinos opened last year as part of
resorts run by  Genting Singapore Plc  and Las Vegas Sands
Corp.. The resorts include gambling centers, restaurants,
malls and a Universal Studios theme park.  Efforts to boost tourism in 2010 included the inaugural
Youth  Olympic Games , while the Singapore leg of Formula One,
the world’s most-watched motor sport, took place for a third
year.  Hotel room revenue rose 22 percent to S$1.9 billion from
a year earlier, according to the tourism agency. Shopping,
sightseeing, entertainment and accommodation made up 61
percent of tourism revenue, according to the statement.  Tourism receipts accounted for about 5 percent of the
economy in 2009. Comparative figures for 2010 are not yet
available.  To contact the reporter on this story:
