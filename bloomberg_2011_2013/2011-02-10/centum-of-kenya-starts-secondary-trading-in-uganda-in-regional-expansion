Centum Investment Co., East Africa’s
biggest publicly traded company, started secondary trading on
the  Uganda  Securities Exchange today as it broadens its
operations outside Kenya.  Centum, based in Nairobi, Kenya’s capital, sold 4 million
shares, and the stock rose as much as 2.3 percent to 670 Ugandan
shillings ($0.29), its Chairman James Muguiyi told reporters
today in Kampala.  The secondary listing is a “springboard” for the
company’s expansion program that will see it operating in three
other East African countries within the next two years, Muguiyi
said in an interview.  Centum plans to increase its assets under management
threefold to 30 billion Kenyan shillings ($370 million) by 2014,
with at least half of the portfolio expected to be outside
Kenya, Muguiyi said. Uganda’s bourse now has 14 listed
companies, seven of which are secondary listings from  Kenya .  Uganda’s exchange will boost the number of trading days to
five a week from three in early March because of increasing
business, Joseph Kitamirike, the bourse’s chief executive
officer said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
