South African mining production rose
last year for the first time since 2005, as investors sought
metals as a hedge against accelerating inflation and
depreciation of currencies such as the dollar and the euro.  Output rose 6.5 percent, after slumping 6.6 percent in
2009, Pretoria-based Statistics  South Africa  said in a report
posted on its website today. Production increased an annual 9.5
percent in the fourth quarter and 3.9 percent on a seasonally
adjusted basis.  “All 12 mineral groups and minerals contributed” to the
fourth-quarter increase, the statistics agency said. Platinum-
group metals and coal were “the main contributors,” with each
adding 0.8 percentage points to the seasonally adjusted number.  South Africa is the world’s largest platinum producer and
the third-biggest gold producer. The price of bullion soared 30
percent last year, reaching a record $1,431.25 on Dec. 7, while
the price of platinum advanced 20 percent.  Investors turned to metals as a haven as governments spent
trillions of dollars to spur growth following the global
financial crisis, accelerating inflation and undermining the
value of their currencies.    Anglo American Plc , BHP Billiton Ltd., AngloGold Ashanti
Ltd. and Harmony Gold Mining Company Ltd. are among the
companies that operate mines in South Africa.  To contact the reporter on this story:
