  Kumba Iron Ore Ltd ., a unit of  Anglo
American Plc , said full-year profit more than doubled as rising
Asian demand pushed up prices for the steelmaking material.  Net income rose to 14.3 billion rand ($1.97 billion), or
44.52 rand a share, in 2010 from 6.9 billion rand, or 21.82
rand, a year earlier, the Pretoria-based company said today in a
statement. Sales advanced 65 percent to 38.7 billion rand.  Average iron-ore prices in China, a global benchmark,
climbed 70 percent last year as Chinese and Indian steel mills
increased purchases of the raw material, according to The Steel
Index. Anglo owns about 63 percent of Kumba, the world’s fourth-
largest supplier of seaborne  iron ore .  Kumba expects China’s crude steel production to grow 5
percent to 10 percent in 2011, the company said. The country
will have to import iron ore to meet demand, supporting seaborne
ore prices, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
