  MannKind Corp ., the unprofitable
biotechnology company that failed to win U.S. approval last
month to market its first product, said it will cut about 41
percent of its workforce.  The firings will be completed by mid-April and reduce the
number of company employees to 257, Valencia, California-based
MannKind said today in a regulatory filing.  MannKind, founded by billionaire inventor  Alfred Mann , is
restructuring its operations to focus on winning Food and Drug
Administration approval for Afrezza, an inhaled insulin for
diabetes, Mann said today in a statement. The FDA on Jan. 19
asked the company for two new studies of the device in patients
with Type 1 and  Type 2 diabetes .  “The year ahead will be focused on the activities that are
necessary to secure the approval of Afrezza,” said Mann, the
company’s chairman and chief executive officer.  MannKind fell as much as 5.9 percent to $4.76 in extended
trading after declining 8 cents, or 1.6 percent, to $5.06 at 4
p.m. New York time in Nasdaq Stock Market composite trading
before the announcement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
