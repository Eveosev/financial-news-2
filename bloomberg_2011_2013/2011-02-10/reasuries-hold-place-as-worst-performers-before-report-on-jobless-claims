Treasuries held their place as the
world’s worst-performing sovereign debt before a government
report today that economists said will show claims for  unemployment insurance  fell last week.    Government securities  maturing in 10 years and longer have
handed investors a 2.3 percent loss in the past week, the most
of 174 bond-market indexes tracked by Bloomberg. The U.S. is
scheduled to sell $16 billion of 30-year bonds today, the last
of three auctions this week.  “The worst is over for employment,” said  Satoshi Okumoto ,
a general manager at Fukoku Mutual Life Insurance Co. in Tokyo,
which has the equivalent of $67.8 billion in assets. “It’s hard
for us to take new positions.”  Two-year notes yielded 0.82 percent at 9:30 a.m. in Tokyo,
according to BGCantor Market Data. The 0.625 percent security
maturing in January 2013 traded at a price of 99 5/8.  Initial jobless claims fell by 5,000 last week to 410,000,
according to the median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of
economists before the Labor Department reports the figure today.  Treasuries rose yesterday as demand at a $24 billion 10-
year auction surged from the class of investors that includes
foreign central banks.  Indirect bidders bought 71.3 percent of the notes, compared
with 53.6 percent in January and an average of 46.4 percent for
the prior 10 sales.  “The major severe selloff in the last couple of days
provided some value for investors, and they came in at
remarkable levels,” said Thomas Simons, a government debt
economist in  New York  at Jefferies Group Inc., one of 20 primary
dealers that trades with the Fed.  Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  told the House
Budget Committee yesterday that while the declines in the
jobless rate in December and January “do provide some grounds
for optimism,” he cautioned that “it will be several years
before the  unemployment rate  has returned to a more normal
level.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
