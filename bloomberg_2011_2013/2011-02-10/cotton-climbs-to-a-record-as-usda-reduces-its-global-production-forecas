Cotton futures climbed to a record
for the second straight day after a report showed strong demand
for fiber from the U.S., the biggest exporter.  U.S. export sales rose 26 percent in the week ended Feb. 3
from a week earlier, the Department of Agriculture said today.
Global output will be 115.25 million bales in the year ending
July 31, down 0.2 percent from a January forecast, with demand
at 116.55 million, the USDA said yesterday. Prices have more
than doubled in the past 12 months.  “The future prices are being pushed up by physical
demand,” said  Andy Ryan , a senior risk-management consultant
at FCStone Fibers & Textiles in Nashville,  Tennessee . “We
could see usage being rationed because of scarcity and not
because of prices, as China is consuming whatever they are able
to buy.”  Cotton for March delivery jumped 3.9 percent, gaining the
exchange limit of 7 cents, to settle at a record of $1.8758 a
pound on ICE Futures U.S. at 3:16 p.m. in  New York . The fiber
also rose 7 cents yesterday before closing up 5.29 cents. The
commodity has surged 12 percent this week.  Output this year in Central Asia will be 7.02 million
bales, down 2.1 percent from last month’s projection, the USDA
said yesterday. A bale weighs 480 pounds, or 218 kilograms.  “Yesterday’s USDA report was confirming current tight
supply amid a steady increase in demand from  China ,” said Baek
Youn Min, a broker for agricultural products at Korea Exchange
Bank Futures Co. in  Seoul .  To contact the reporters on this story:
