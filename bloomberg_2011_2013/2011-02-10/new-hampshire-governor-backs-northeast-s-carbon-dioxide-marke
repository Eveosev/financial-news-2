New Hampshire Governor  John Lynch 
said he’ll oppose Republican efforts to pull the state out of
the U.S. Northeast’s cap-and-trade carbon program for power
plants.  Withdrawing from the  Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative 
“would be a blow to our economy and to our state’s efforts to
become more energy efficient and energy independent,” Lynch, a
Democrat, said today in a  letter  to members of the Republican-
led New Hampshire House of Representatives.  The state House Committee on Science, Technology and Energy
held a hearing today on a bill to remove the state from the
regional carbon trading program, which has operated since 2008.
The 10 states in the program sell pollution allowances that
power plants must obtain in order to legally release carbon
dioxide from their smokestacks.  Requiring  power plants  to pay for carbon-dioxide allowances
has “increased consumer costs for electricity, fuel and food,”
according to the bill. Lynch said households and businesses save
money under the program because the cash raised from carbon
allowance auctions is spent on projects that cut energy
consumption and lead to lower utility bills.  New Hampshire accounts for 4.6 percent of the carbon
allowances issued under the regional cap-and-trade program,
according to data on its  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
