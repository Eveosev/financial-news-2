  American Eagle Outfitters Inc .
surged the most in almost two years in New York trading on
speculation the Pittsburgh-based teen-clothing retailer may be a
takeover target.  The shares rose $1.34, or 9.1 percent, to $16.03 at 4:01
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading for the
largest gain since April 2009.  “It’s the takeover rumors starting up again,” said  Brian Sozzi  an analyst for Wall Street Strategies Inc. in New York. A
deal would make sense for private equity because American Eagle
has “a good brand and generates lots of cash,” he said.  The clothier, led by Chief Executive Officer James O’Donnell, faces increasing competition from teen retailers like  Abercrombie & Fitch Co . and  Aeropostale Inc ., both of which
reported gains in same-store sales last month. American Eagle
had a market value of about $2.9 billion as of yesterday’s
close.  Jani Strand, a spokeswoman for American Eagle, declined to
comment.  The retailer lowered its fourth-quarter profit forecast
last month after sales slumped 4 percent. Sales at stores open
at least a year declined 6 percent in January. The company is
scheduled to report results for the period on March 9.  To contact the reporter on this story:
