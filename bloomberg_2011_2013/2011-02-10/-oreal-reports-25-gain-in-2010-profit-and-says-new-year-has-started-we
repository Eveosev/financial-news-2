  L’Oreal SA , the world’s largest
cosmetics maker, reported a 25 percent profit gain in 2010 and
said it made an encouraging start to this year.  Net income rose to 2.24 billion euros ($3.05 billion) from
1.79 billion euros a year earlier, Paris-based L’Oreal said in a
statement today after the market’s close. The average estimate
of 10 analysts compiled by Bloomberg was 2.27 billion euros.  Profit climbed after declining in 2008 and 2009 as the
maker of  Garnier shampoo  and Kiehl’s lip balm lifted spending on
advertising and promotion as a percentage of sales. Fourth-
quarter revenue gained 11 percent to 4.98 billion euros.  “L’Oreal is back,”  Andrew Wood , an analyst at Sanford C.
Bernstein in  London , wrote in a Feb. 9 note. “We do not expect
further acceleration from here,” as 2010 sales benefited from
an easy basis of comparison, he said. Wood has an
“underperform” rating on the stock.  L’Oreal rose 1.14 euros, or 1.3 percent, to 89.50 euros
today in Paris trading. The stock has climbed 7.7 percent this
year, giving the company a market value of 53.6 billion euros.  “Supported by an encouraging start to the year, we are
confident in the group’s ability to achieve a new year of sales
and profit growth in 2011,” Chief Executive Officer Jean-Paul Agon said in the statement.  L’Oreal said it will propose a dividend increase of 20
percent to 1.80 euros a share at a shareholder meeting on April
22. The dividend will be paid on May 4, the company said.  Annual operating profit climbed to 3.06 billion euros from
2.58 billion euros, slightly trailing the 3.09 billion-euro
average analyst estimate. Sales rose 12 percent to 19.5 billion
euros, L’Oreal said. The operating margin widened 90 basis
points to 15.7 percent, the cosmetics maker said.  Net financial debt was 41 million euros, L’Oreal said.  To contact the reporter on this story:  Andrew Roberts  in Paris at
