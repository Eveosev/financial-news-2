  Daimler AG , which owns a 15 percent
stake in European Aeronautic, Defence & Space Co., was charged
with  insider trading  by Paris judges in a five-year-old
investigation into sales of EADS shares.  Judges Serge Tournaire and Xavier Blanc questioned Daimler
yesterday about its decision to sell EADS shares in April 2006,
two months before the planemaker disclosed production delays on
the A380, the world’s biggest passenger plane.  “This whole matter is quite unusual and it is quite
difficult to understand,” Florian Martens, a spokesman for
Stuttgart, Germany-based Daimler, said in an interview today.
“We are quite confident” the company will be cleared.  Daimler and another EADS shareholder,  Lagardere SCA , face
charges over their simultaneous sale of 7.5 percent stakes in
2006. Seven current and former EADS executives have also been
charged in the criminal probe.  The criminal inquiry continued after the French financial
regulator, the Autorite des Marches Financiers, cleared all
parties in 2009, saying there was no privileged information.  To contact the reporter on this story:
