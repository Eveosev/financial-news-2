Heating oil fell as a forecast for
higher temperatures in the U.S. Northeast indicated less home-
heating demand and diesel fuel supplies rose to a record high.  Heating oil, traded as a surrogate for diesel, dropped as
ultra-low sulfur diesel stocks rose a seventh consecutive week.
Higher-than-normal temperatures were projected for the region
Feb. 15 through Feb. 23, according to the  National Weather
Service ’s  Climate Prediction Center .  “As the country warms up over the next two weeks, maybe
the demand for it is starting to slide,” said  Gene McGillian ,
an analyst and broker at Tradition Energy in  Stamford ,  Connecticut .  Heating oil for March delivery dropped 5.82 cents, or 2.1
percent, to settle at $2.7107 a gallon on the  New York 
Mercantile Exchange.  Stockpiles of low-sulfur and ultra-low-sulfur diesel fuel
rose last week to 125.7 million barrels, the highest level since
at least May 1993, according to Energy Department data.  Futures also weakened as the department sold about 2
million barrels of its home-heating-oil reserve before replacing
the holdings with an ultra-low-sulfur distillate required by
Northeast states. The sale began on Feb. 3, with an offer of
about 1 million barrels from the Hess First Reserve Terminal in
Perth Amboy,  New Jersey , the department said Feb. 1 in a press
release.  “They sold a million last week and a million this week,”
said Andrew Lebow, senior vice president for energy at MF Global
Inc. in New York.  WTI-Brent Spread  The heating oil crack spread, based on March contracts,
lost $2.46 to $27.12 a barrel as Brent crude oil’s premium to
West  Texas  Intermediate crude oil narrowed 97 cents to $14.14 a
barrel. Refineries on the East Coast, where Nymex futures are
delivered, process oil from  Europe  and West Africa, which is
traded relative to Brent.  Stockpiles of distillates, including heating oil and
diesel, rose 288,000 barrels to 164.4 million in the week ended
Feb. 4, the Energy Department reported yesterday. Demand dropped
5.4 percent to an average 3.68 million barrels a day, the lowest
level in three weeks.  Gasoline for March delivery lost 5.62 cents, or 2.2
percent, to settle at $2.4698 a gallon, after reaching a 28-
month high yesterday. The gasoline crack spread, based on March
contracts, dropped $2.38 to $17 a barrel, after reaching the
highest level yesterday since July 2007.  ‘Follow-Up’  “It’s a follow-up the day after a bearish report,” said
Gordon Elliott, a risk management specialist at FCStone LLC in  St. Louis Park ,  Minnesota . “We have an exceptional amount of
gasoline in store.”  Stockpiles of gasoline rose 4.66 million barrels to 240.9
million barrels in the week ended Feb. 4, the largest total
since March 1990. Demand sank to a 10-month low and production
surged 2.8 percent.  The March contract’s discount to April futures widened 1.03
cents to 14.91 cents.  “‘You probably have a lot of product backed up because of
the bad weather we’ve seen the last couple of days,” said Tom Knight, vice president of trading and supply at Truman Arnold
Cos. in Texarkana, Texas.  Regular gasoline at the pump, averaged nationwide, added
0.4 cent to $3.119 a gallon yesterday, AAA said on its  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
