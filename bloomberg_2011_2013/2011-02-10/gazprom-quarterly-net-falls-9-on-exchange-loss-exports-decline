OAO Gazprom,  Russia ’s monopoly gas
exporter, said profit fell 9 percent in the third quarter from a
year earlier because of an exchange loss, while rising prices
compensated for a decline in European sales.  Net income fell to 159 billion rubles ($5.4 billion), the
Moscow-based company said today on its website, meeting the
average estimate of eight analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.
Gazprom said it had a foreign exchange loss of 6.8 billion
rubles after a gain of 42.5 billion rubles a year earlier.  “In Europe the drop was serious, and it will continue in
the fourth quarter,” Alexander Nazarov, an analyst at IFC
Metropol said by phone. “January 2011 export figures give some
reason for optimism, but that is the cold winter and favorable
situation on the  spot market  in  Europe .”  Sales rose 15 percent to 786 billion rubles, as price
increases at home and abroad compensated for lower volumes. Gas
exports to Europe, the Middle East and  Asia  plunged 21 percent
to 31 billion cubic meters, according to a presentation posted
on Gazprom’s website. Volumes in Russia and former Soviet
republics were little changed at 41 billion cubic meters and 15
billion cubic meters, respectively.  “I don’t see Gazprom reaching 150 billion cubic meters to
Europe in 2011,” Nazarov said.  Pre-Crisis Supply  Gazprom Deputy Chief Executive Officer Valery Golubev said
yesterday that exports to Europe may return to the pre-crisis
level this year as rising spot prices make competing liquefied
natural gas supplies less attractive. The company shipped 158.8
billion cubic meters to Europe in 2008, which plunged to 140.6
billion in 2009.  Russia’s move to lift an export duty on gas to Ukraine
helped support revenue in the so-called FSU market, Nazarov
said. Net gas sales to the former  Soviet Union  rose 58 percent
to 102 billion rubles, while net export sales to other markets
rose about 3 percent to 246 billion rubles, Gazprom said.  Earnings before interest and tax rose 26 percent to 197
billion rubles.  In late April, Russia agreed to slash the price Ukraine
pays for gas by 30 percent in exchange for an extension of its
navy’s lease on a Black Sea port. Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin 
said the government was covering the discount by cutting the
export tax.  To contact the reporter on this story:
