South  Korea ’s producer-price
inflation rate climbed at the fastest pace in more than two
years, bolstering the case for the central bank to raise
borrowing costs for a second straight month today.  Producer prices increased 6.2 percent in January from a
year earlier, the biggest gain since November 2008, compared
with a 5.3 percent advance in December, the  Bank of Korea  said
in a statement in  Seoul  today. Prices advanced 1.6 percent from
December, the fastest pace in more than two years.  The Bank of Korea will raise its benchmark policy rate by a
quarter percentage point to 3 percent at its meeting today,
according to nine of 12 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News.  “The BOK needs to act more aggressively to keep inflation
expectations from running out of control,” Kwon Young Sun, an
economist at Nomura Holdings Inc. in  Hong Kong , said before the
report. “The success of rate hikes will depend on how much the
won appreciates to curb import prices.”  Consumer prices climbed 4.1 percent from a year earlier in
January, matching their biggest increase since 2008 and
breaching the central bank’s 4 percent ceiling. Finance Minister
Yoon Jeung Hyun said on Feb. 9 the government needs to act
“preemptively” to curb inflation as price gains can hurt
growth.  To contact the reporter on this story:
