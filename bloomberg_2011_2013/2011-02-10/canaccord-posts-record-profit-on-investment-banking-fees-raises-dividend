  Canaccord Financial Inc .,  Canada ’s
largest independent brokerage by assets, said third-quarter
profit almost tripled to a record on higher investment-banking
fees. The company raised its dividend by 50 percent to 7.5 cents
a share.  Net income for the period ended Dec. 31 rose to C$42.7
million ($42.8 million), or 51 cents a share, compared with
C$15.1 million, or 27 cents, in the year earlier period, the
Toronto-based brokerage said today in a statement. Revenue rose
47 percent to a record C$254.8 million from C$173.2 million.  Canaccord benefited from higher investment-banking fees
from a year earlier, before its takeover of Genuity Capital
Markets. Canaccord bought Toronto-based Genuity in April for
C$285.9 million.  “This is clearly an impressive result from Canaccord
Financial, and speaks to the greater diversification in revenue
streams the company now maintains,” said Macquarie Capital
Markets analyst Sumit Malhotra, who forecast a dividend increase
in his Jan. 28 note.  Canaccord said it earned 54 cents a share excluding
acquisition costs. The company was estimated to earn 31 cents a
share excluding items, the average estimate of four analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg News.  Canaccord fell 25 cents, or 1.5 percent, to C$16 by the 4
p.m. close of trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange. The stock
has risen 13 percent this year.  The firm’s Canaccord Genuity investment-banking unit had
profit of C$55.9 million before taxes, more than double a year
earlier. Wealth management had C$9 million in profit, ending six
consecutive quarterly losses.  Canaccord Genuity led 44 transactions to raise C$1.6
billion in the quarter, and was involved in 138 deals. The
company had revenue of C$25.2 million for advising companies on
transactions, four times more than the same period a year
earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
