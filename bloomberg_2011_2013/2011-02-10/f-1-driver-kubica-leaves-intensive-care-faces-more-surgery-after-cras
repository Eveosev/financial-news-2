Formula One driver  Robert Kubica 
will have further surgery today after being moved from intensive
care as he continues his recovery following a high-speed rally
crash in  Italy .  Kubica, who suffered multiple fractures in the Feb. 6
accident near Genoa, will undergo operations on his foot and
upper arm in the Santa Corona Hospital in Pietra Ligure, his
Lotus Renault GP team said yesterday.  The 26-year-old, who finished eighth in last year’s F-1
world championship, underwent a seven-hour operation five days
ago to rebuild the functions of his right forearm. Lotus Renault
said Feb. 8 that he’ll remain at the hospital for two to three
weeks before a decision is made about where to continue his
rehabilitation.  The U.K.-based team has begun the search for his
replacement, giving first reserve Bruno Senna and former
Williams driver Nick Heidfeld the chance to press their claims
this weekend at a testing session in Jerez,  Spain . The season-
opening Bahrain Grand Prix is March 13.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
