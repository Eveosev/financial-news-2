Tow-truck operator Matthew Gowen
moved from  Dallas  to  Seattle  three years ago, landing a gig
riding a bicycle rickshaw that he expected would be temporary.  “Here I am, still sitting on the same bike,” said Gowen,
29, shifting his pedals outside a Starbucks Corp. coffee shop
in Seattle, the largest city in the U.S. Pacific Northwest,
centered on Washington and Oregon states.  The region that was a darling of the 1990s, when companies
including Starbucks and Microsoft Corp. hired workers by the
thousands and influenced the popular culture, is still drawing
migrants like Gowen, according to 2010 Census data released
yesterday. It’s the jobs that are scarcer.  “People move here because they really want to live
here,” said  Charles Rynerson , senior demographic analyst for
the Population Research Center at Portland State University,
referring to the Northwest’s scenic beauty and pace of life.
“To some extent they may have to accept less opportunity.”    Washington ’s population increased 14.1 percent to
6,724,540 between 2000 and 2010, census data show. While that
was above the national average of 9.7 percent and enough to
gain an additional seat in the  U.S. Congress , it was the
slowest growth for the state since the 1930s.  Oregon’s population rose 12 percent to 3,831,074 since
2000, the slowest pace since the 1980s, census figures show.  Northwest Remade  After decades in which lumber, fishing and airplane
manufacturing were mainstays of the regional economy, the
Northwest remade itself into a technology powerhouse through
the growth of companies such as Redmond, Washington-based
Microsoft and  Santa Clara , California-based  Intel Corp .  Hillsboro, a town west of Portland, expanded with lofts
and brownstones for workers commuting to two Intel computer-
chip plants. Intel’s Oregon workforce rose to 18,000 by 2006
from 14,000 in 2001 -- and it has more employees in  Oregon  than
any other site in the world. Today, the company employs 16,000.
Microsoft boosted employment in the Puget Sound region
surrounding Seattle by 83 percent to 40,337 at the end of last
month from 22,013 in January 2001, company figures show.  The population of Redmond, east of Seattle, grew 19.6
percent to 54,144, census data show.  Stalwarts Flagged  More recently, the region’s stalwarts flagged. Microsoft
undertook its first companywide layoffs in 2009 as the
recession sapped demand, and rivals including Google Inc. made
inroads in the software market. The company’s stock has
declined 5.5 percent in the past decade as of Feb. 18.  Starbucks, whose shares jumped almost six-fold from 2000
to 2006, said in 2009 it would cut 6,700 jobs and curtail
growth after expanding from a few Seattle espresso stands to
more than 10,000 U.S. stores.  The company has since resumed opening stores, if at a
slower pace. Chief Executive Officer  Howard Schultz  said in
November the company will open 500 stores in the fiscal year
that began in October, with 400 outside the U.S. It opened
1,669 stores in fiscal 2008.  Boeing Co., founded in Seattle in 1916 by lumberman
William E. Boeing, moved its headquarters to Chicago in 2001
and said in 2009 it would start an assembly line for its 787
jetliner in Charleston,  South Carolina , instead of Everett,
Washington. Boeing employed 73,800 people in Washington last
month, down 5.6 percent from 78,200 in January 2001, the
company said.  Washington’s jobless rate was 9.3 percent in December,
just below the national average of 9.4 percent that month. In
Oregon, it was 10.6 percent in December, seventh-highest in the
nation. Both states had jobless rates of 5.2 percent in
December 2000.  Collapse in Housing  Construction is one reason for higher unemployment.
Portland and Seattle are both lagging the national recovery
from the collapse in housing prices. Seattle home prices fell 6
percent in December from a year earlier and  Portland ’s fell 7.8
percent, according to the S&P/Case-Shiller Index.  Bend, the fastest-growing Oregon city of more than 50,000
in the past decade, experienced a reversal as the  construction
industry  weakened. For years, Bend locals prospered building
second homes for Californians who came to ski in the Cascade
Mountains and play golf in the high desert to the east, beyond
the soaking Oregon rain.  Unemployment in Bend more than doubled to a seasonally
adjusted 14.5 percent in December from 6.3 percent in January
2008, according to the Oregon Employment Department. The
population in Bend rose to 76,639 in 2010 from 52,029 in 2000,
a 47.3 percent increase.  ‘Portlandia’ Parody  Newcomers to Portland, whose population climbed 10.3
percent to 583,776, also weren’t deterred by a decline in jobs.
An Independent Film Channel show called  “Portlandia”  parodied
the city this year as the place “where young people go to
retire.”  The cable show, created by  Saturday Night Live  comedian
Fred Armisen and Carrie Brownstein, a guitarist for the now-
defunct Portland rock band Sleater-Kinney, portray a slacker
utopia. Characters raise organic poultry, manage feminist book
stores, and scavenge food from dumpsters to minimize waste in
America.  The parody hits the mark, said Paul Maziar, who moved to
Portland in 2009 from  New York City , where he was working at a
marketing firm. Maziar, 30, said he fell in love with Oregon
during a four-month visit, and moved without a job. Now he’s a
valet and bellhop at the luxury Governor Hotel in downtown
Portland while he puts his energy into writing poetry and
hosting monthly readings.  ‘Hard Everywhere’  “The economy isn’t what it should be, but it’s been hard
everywhere,” said Maziar, who savors the city’s bike-friendly
culture. “I got a boost from Portland for my soul.”  Dylan Reiff, a disc jockey for dance parties, decided to
move from  Chicago  after working on an event in Portland -- and
having an all-night bar-hopping political discussion.  “I knew there weren’t jobs,” said Reiff, 28. “It’s the
people, the nature and the culture.”  Reiff has been in Portland since November. He worked for
two months playing music at a strip club and left, he said,
because dancers were stingy sharing their tips. He’s still
looking for a full-time job while on contract as an emcee of
video-game tournaments around the country.  Growth has added pressure on the region to pay for the
roads, bridges and schools that all its new residents require.
In Washington, which is borrowing about $1 billion a year for
transportation projects including a new car tunnel beneath
Seattle, debt is $2,226 per capita, eighth in the country and
more than double the $936 national median, said Jim McIntire,
the state treasurer.  ‘Level of Debt’  “It’s not  Michigan ; we’ve been a pretty attractive
place,” McIntire said in an interview. “But in the past
decade, we’re reached a level of debt that’s going to require
that we exercise greater fiscal discipline.”  So far, income growth has compensated for the borrowing
and helped maintain the state’s bond rating. Total income in
the state rose 45 percent since 2000, 5 percent faster than the
nation, McIntire said in a December report.  Moody’s Investors Service rates Washington’s bonds Aa1,
the second-highest rating.  Standard & Poor’s  also has assigned
Washington its second-highest rating, AA+.  There are signs that employment is stabilizing now, and
the state will benefit from higher exports of agricultural
goods and airplanes because of a weaker dollar, said Arun Raha,
the chief economist for the state of Washington.  “We’re lagging the nation, but we’ll catch up,” Raha
said. “I think by 2012 we’ll be ahead of the nation.”  Balancing on his rickshaw in downtown Seattle, Gowen said
he’s come to another conclusion about his adopted state after
sending out dozens of applications for jobs that might offer
medical benefits and pay more than $3 a ride.  “It’s a great place. We’re just overpopulated.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
