South African Department of Mineral
Resources Director General Sandile Nogxina declined to comment
on a Miningmx report that he will quit after 13 years in the
post.  Nogxina, 53, has offered his voluntary retirement and is in
talks with the department, the Johannesburg-based Internet news
service said yesterday, citing people close to the ministry it
didn’t identify. The split is amicable, it said.  His contract expires at the beginning of next year, Nogxina
said in a phone interview from  Cape Town  today, adding that he
is unable to comment on whether he will serve out his full term.
Bheki Khumalo, a spokesman for the Pretoria-based ministry, said
he hasn’t been informed over whether Nogxina will leave when
called on his mobile phone for comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
