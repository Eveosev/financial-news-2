  Ghana ’s cedi strengthened against
the  U.S. dollar  as foreign investors bought the currency ahead
of a Feb. 16 government bond sale.  The cedi traded at 1.5165 per dollar at 11:50 a.m. in
Accra, from 1.5210 at 9 a.m., according to data from Standard
Bank Group Ltd.’s Ghanaian unit.  “We’ve seen some offshore inflow of dollars ahead of the
bond auction next week,” said Chris Nettey, a currency trader
with the lender, in a phone interview today. “That’s added
strength to the currency.”  The cedi is likely to appreciate to 1.51 against the dollar
by tomorrow and reach 1.50 next week, Nettey said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
