The dollar gained against most of
its major counterparts as a report in  Washington  signaled U.S.
unemployment may be declining, while data in Europe and
Australia spurred speculation economic growth is stalling.  The yen reached a one-month low versus the greenback as U.S.
jobless claims dropped last week to the least since July 2008
and two-year Treasury yields were at almost an eight-month high.
The euro fell for the first time in four days versus the dollar
as stocks slipped, curbing demand for higher-yielding assets.
Australia’s dollar slumped after full-time employment dropped.  “This is broad-based dollar strength; it’s a safe haven
play,” said  Michael Woolfolk , senior currency strategist in New
York at Bank of New York Mellon Corp., the world’s largest
custodial bank, with more than $20 trillion in assets under
administration. “With equity markets lower, players wanted to
dial back risk a little bit.”  The dollar gained 1 percent to $1.3603 per euro at 5 p.m.
in  New York , from $1.3733 yesterday. It touched $1.3577, the
strongest level in two days. The U.S. currency rose 1.1 percent
to 83.23 yen, from 82.36, and reached 83.37, the highest level
since Jan. 12. The euro rose 0.1 percent to 113.20 yen, compared
with 113.09 yen yesterday.  The greenback remained higher versus most peers as Egyptian
President  Hosni Mubarak , in a televised speech, delegated the
powers of the presidency to his deputy,  Omar Suleiman . Mubarak
refused to bow to the calls of protesters demanding his
immediate ouster and pledged to die on Egyptian soil.  Stocks earlier pared losses on speculation Mubarak would
resign. The MSCI World Index of equities was down 0.3 percent
after earlier falling 1 percent. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
closed little changed after earlier declining 0.7 percent.  Treasury Yields  Yields on U.S. Treasuries rose, burnishing the appeal of
dollar-denominated debt, after the unemployment-claims report
and a 30-year bond sale that drew less-than-average demand. The
2-year yield rose three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point,
to 0.83 percent, within five basis points of the highest level
since May. The benchmark 10-year yield rose five basis points to
3.69 percent, within nine basis points of the highest level
since April.  The pound rose against most major counterparts on
speculation the  Bank of England  will be forced to raise its
benchmark interest rate before year-end, even after it left the
rate unchanged at 0.5 percent today.  U.K. Bond Program  Sterling gained 0.9 percent to 84.49 pence per euro. The
central bank’s Monetary Policy Committee also left its bond
program at 200 billion pounds ($322 billion).  U.S. applications for jobless benefits decreased by 36,000,
more than forecast, to 383,000 in the week ended Feb. 4, Labor
Department figures showed today. Economists anticipated claims
would fall to 410,000, according to the median estimate in a
Bloomberg News survey. The total number of people receiving  unemployment insurance  fell, while those collecting extended
payments increased.  “It’s giving more guidance to what the jobless number
could be next time,” said Brian Kim, a currency strategist at
UBS AG in  Stamford ,  Connecticut . “People are saying there’s a
continuing trend.”  The euro fell versus most of its major counterparts amid
concern  Portugal ’s funding costs are becoming unsustainable.
Speculation has increased the nation will have to follow Ireland
in tapping the European Financial Stability Facility if yields
on 10-year bonds remain above 7 percent.  Portuguese Debt  Yields on 10-year Portuguese debt reached 7.64 percent
today, the highest level since the introduction of the euro in
1999, before trading at 7.3 percent.  Norway’s krone depreciated as much as 1.7 percent to 5.8532
versus the dollar in the biggest intraday drop since Nov. 26,
before trading at 5.8322. The annual underlying inflation rate
was 0.7 percent in January,  Statistics Norway  said today. The
median forecast of 10 economists in a Bloomberg News survey was
for 1.1 percent.  The euro also weakened amid speculation Bundesbank
President  Axel Weber ’s exit from the race to succeed ECB
President  Jean-Claude Trichet  will delay an attempt to contain
inflation by boosting borrowing costs.  Weber would leave his job as president of the Bundesbank
about a year before his term expires in April 2012, said a
person who talked to him yesterday. The German central-bank
chief today reversed a plan to comment on his intentions. He
said he spoke with German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  and they
agreed not to disclose the content of the discussion.    Australia ’s dollar fell versus the greenback after an
employment report for January fueled speculation the economy is
growing too slowly to prompt the central bank to raise interest
rates. While overall employment rose by 24,000 jobs, full-time
employment fell by 8,000, data showed.  The Aussie tumbled as much as 1.1 percent to $1.0010 in the
biggest intraday drop since Jan. 27 before trading at $1.0044.    Colombia ’s peso strengthened for the first time in three
days on speculation a free-trade agreement with the U.S. will be
approved this year. It rose 0.4 percent to 1,881.48 per dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
