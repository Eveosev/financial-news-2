Vattenfall AB, the Swedish state-
owned utility, and Amsterdam-based Nuon Energy NV applied for
funds from the sale of 4.4 billion euros ($6 billion) of carbon
dioxide permits to help projects that capture emissions.  “We have applied for the NER300 funding,’’ Melanie Poort, a
spokeswoman for Amsterdam-based Nuon Energy NV said by
telephone. “It’s for the second phase of our newly built power
plant in Eemshaven, Groningen.”  Klaus Aurich, a spokesman for Vattenfall, said in an e-mail
that the company ‘‘did submit applications under the NER300
program in different categories.’’  Vattenfall entered its Jaenschwalde carbon capture and
storage project in the German state of Brandenburg for the
European Commission funding program, Aurich said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
