Jerry Sloan of the  Utah Jazz , the
longest-tenured coach in the  National Basketball Association ,
has resigned in the middle of his 23rd season with the team, KSL
Radio in Salt Lake City  reported  without saying where it got the
information.  Sloan, who took over the Jazz in 1988 when Frank Layden
retired, had signed a one-year extension on Feb. 7. Jazz
assistant coach Phil Johnson also stepped down, said KSL, which
didn’t give a reason for their departures.  Sloan, 68, has a career record of 1,221-803 and led the
Jazz to the NBA finals in 1997 and 1998, losing both series to
the Chicago Bulls and  Michael Jordan . He was inducted into the
Pro Basketball Hall of Fame as a coach in 2009.  Sloan spent 11 years in the NBA as a player for the Bulls
and Baltimore Bullets, and got his first head coaching job in  Chicago  from 1979-82. Sloan has 1,127 career wins with the Jazz
and is the only coach in NBA history with more than 1,100
victories for a single franchise.  Utah has a 31-23 record and is 3 1/2 games behind the
first-place Oklahoma City Thunder in the Western Conference’s
Northwest Division.  To contact the reporter on this story:
