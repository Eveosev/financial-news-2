BentleyForbes Group Inc. , the
closely held owner of Atlanta’s Bank of America Plaza, said it
asked for a loan on the 55-story  office tower  to be put in
special servicing so a debt restructuring can be explored.  The $363 million loan on the building, the tallest in the
U.S. Southeast, was transferred yesterday to special servicer
LNR Partners from  Wells Fargo & Co ., according to New York-based
credit-rating company Fitch Ratings.  “BentleyForbes requested the loan for Bank of America
Plaza in Atlanta to be moved to special servicing to begin the
process of reviewing options on the underlying  capital
structure ,” Tony Manos, the company’s chief operating officer,
said today in a statement. LNR and BentleyForbes will work
together “to determine next steps moving forward,” he said.  Payments on the loan are current, according to Manos.
BentleyForbes bought the 1.25 million-square-foot (116,000-
square-meter)  Bank of America Plaza  for $438 million in 2006,
the year before commercial real estate prices peaked. Atlanta’s
construction boom left the city with one of the highest vacancy
rates among major U.S. markets after the credit crisis threw the
economy into recession, according to Cushman & Wakefield Inc.  To contact the reporters on this story:
