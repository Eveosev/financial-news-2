  American International Group Inc .
property-casualty units were cut by  Fitch Ratings  after the
bailed-out insurer boosted reserves by $4.1 billion because
claims costs were higher than the firm had forecast.  The financial-strength rating was dropped to A from A+ as
Fitch “views AIG’s recent record of adverse reserve development
as a significant outlier relative to that of the company’s large
commercial insurance lines competitors,” the ratings firm said
today in a statement on the New York-based insurer. The
company’s “recent history of reporting significant adverse
reserve development raises concerns about the company’s ability
to generate consistent run-rate underwriting results.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
