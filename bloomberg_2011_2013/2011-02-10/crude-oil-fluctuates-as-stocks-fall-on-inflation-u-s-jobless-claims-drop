Oil climbed in electronic trading in
New York after Egyptian President  Hosni Mubarak  failed to resign
in a speech late today and instead delegated powers to his
deputy, Omar Suleiman.  Oil rose as Mubarak refused to bow to the calls of
protesters crammed into the center of Cairo demanding his
immediate ouster. He spoke after floor trading ended and crude
settled up 2 cents in New York. Egyptian unrest sent oil to two-
year highs last month.  “What we don’t know is if this is 1979 Iran all over again
or if it’s completely different,” said Stephen Schork,
president of the Schork Group Inc. in Villanova, Pennsylvania.
Islamic clerics rose to power in  Iran  in 1979, ousting the U.S.-
backed shah. The largest group opposing Mubarak is the  Muslim
Brotherhood .  Oil for March delivery jumped 85 cents, or 1 percent, to
$87.56 a barrel at 5:15 p.m. in electronic trading on the  New
York Mercantile Exchange . Earlier, it settled at $86.73 a
barrel, 16 percent higher than a year earlier.  Crude oil more than doubled in 1979 when the regime of
Iran’s Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi was toppled, slashing the
nation’s oil exports. Iran is OPEC’s second-largest oil producer
after  Saudi Arabia .  Egypt  controls the  Suez Canal  and the Suez-
Mediterranean Pipeline, through which 2.5 percent of global oil
production moves, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  Egyptian Unrest  Hundreds of thousands of people have demonstrated in
Cairo’s Tahrir Square since Jan. 25 seeking an end to Mubarak’s
30-year rule.  New York  oil futures surged to $92.84 a barrel on
Jan. 31, the highest price since October 2008, amid concern that
shipments through the canal would be disrupted and that
political unrest in Egypt could spread to the Middle East’s big
oil producers.  Egypt’s top military body is staying in session in response
to the “legitimate” demands of the people, according to a
statement today.  The  International Energy Agency  and OPEC said in reports
today that if unrest in Egypt halts oil shipments through the
canal, flows can be diverted through the SuMed pipeline and
other export routes.  Closure of the canal would have the biggest impact on Saudi
Arabian and Iranian crude exports, while the most-affected
customers would be China and  Spain , the IEA said.  Crude advanced earlier as U.S. jobless claims fell to the
lowest level since July 2008 in a Labor Department report and
the IEA and OPEC boosted their global oil-demand forecasts.  The number of Americans filing first-time claims for  unemployment insurance  decreased by 36,000 to 383,000 in the
week ended Feb. 4, Labor Department figures showed today.
Economists forecast claims would fall to 410,000, according to
the median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey.  Demand Forecasts  The IEA raised its 2011 consumption estimate by 140,000
barrels a day, and the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries said it will have to pump 400,000 barrels a day more
than it estimated last month.  Global oil demand will increase by 1.5 million barrels, or
1.7 percent, to 89.3 million a day this year, the IEA said today
in its monthly Oil Market Report. OPEC’s estimate of global
consumption this year is 1.8 percent lower than the IEA’s at
87.7 million barrels a day.  OPEC will reduce oil shipments this month as demand for
winter fuels in the Northern Hemisphere fades, according to
tanker-tracker Oil Movements.  Loadings will slip to 23.79 million barrels a day in the
four weeks to Feb. 26, down 0.6 percent from 23.94 million in
the period ended Jan. 29, the tanker-tracker said today in a
report. The data exclude Angola and  Ecuador . It’s the first
monthly drop since the four weeks ended Feb. 5.  Heating Oil  Heating oil for March delivery tumbled 5.82 cents, or 2.1
percent, to $2.7107 a gallon on the Nymex, the biggest drop
since Nov. 17, as a forecast for higher temperatures in the U.S.
Northeast increased speculation that demand for home-heating
fuel will drop.  “There’s temperature moderation on the horizon,” said  John Kilduff , a partner at Again Capital LLC, a New York-based
hedge fund that focuses on energy.    Brent crude  for March settlement fell 20 cents to $101.62 a
barrel at 5:03 p.m. in New York, paring an earlier decline. The
contract dropped 95 cents, or 0.9 percent, to settle at $100.87
a barrel on the ICE Futures Europe exchange in  London .  Brent cost $14.14 a barrel more than New York futures at
the settlement. The differential rose to a record $15.11 a
barrel yesterday.  “A lot of what we are seeing is due to the spread between
WTI and Brent,” said  Kyle Cooper , director of research for IAF
Advisors in Houston. “The spread between the two grades has got
to come back in line. A Brent premium of $2 or $3 makes sense,
not $15, especially given that WTI is a higher-grade crude.”  Oil volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was 1.02
million contracts as of 5:23 p.m. in New York. Volume totaled
985,397 contracts yesterday, 37 percent above the average of the
past three months. Open interest was 1.55 million contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
