The  National Football League  and its
players’ union will today conclude two days of talks in  Washington  aimed at moving closer to an agreement on a new labor
contract for the U.S.’s most-watched sport.  Representatives from the league and the  National Football
League Players Association  met Feb. 5 in  Dallas  for what NFL
Commissioner Roger Goodell called “beneficial” talks. The
sides decided to schedule additional sessions this week. Goodell
said Feb. 4 that “intensive, round-the-clock” negotiations
with the union were needed to reach an agreement.  NFL owners voted in 2008 to opt out of the labor deal after
this season, two years early, saying it doesn’t account for
costs such as those to build stadiums. Union Executive Director
DeMaurice Smith has said players already help with such costs by
calculating their share of league revenue, which is about 59
percent, after omitting $1 billion for items such as stadium
costs, the NFL Network and NFL.com.  Owners want players to take an 18 percent cut in their
share of revenue, which the union opposes. Other disputed topics
include expanding the regular season to 18 games from 16, a
rookie salary cap and health care.  The  players  say that the NFL plans to lock them out if a
new agreement isn’t in place when the current deal expires March
3. Goodell has said the league is focused on reaching an
agreement.  NFLPA spokesman Carl Francis confirmed the latest meetings
-- which were first reported by  Walt Disney Co .’s ESPN -- in an
e-mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
