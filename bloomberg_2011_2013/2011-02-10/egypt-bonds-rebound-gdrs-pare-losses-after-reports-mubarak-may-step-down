The  Market Vectors Egypt Index ETF 
pared its advance after Egyptian President  Hosni Mubarak  said he
will remain in office until elections in September.  The exchange-traded fund gained 0.5 percent to $17.80 at 4
p.m. New York time after climbing as much as 6.1 percent earlier
today, the biggest intraday rally since Feb. 1. Mubarak,
speaking in a televised address, refused to bow to the calls of
protesters crammed into the center of Cairo demanding his
immediate ouster. Later in the speech he delegated his powers to
his deputy,  Omar Suleiman .  “I decided to transfer powers of the presidency to the vice
president according to constitutional guidelines,” Mubarak, 82,
said at the presidential palace in Cairo, pledging to die on
Egyptian soil.  Egyptian dollar bonds gained. Yields on the 5.75 percent
dollar bonds due April 2020 fell for the first time in three
days, declining 11 basis points to 6.48 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
