LDK Solar Co., a Chinese maker of
solar energy products, plans to sell yuan-denominated bonds to
be settled in U.S. dollars, according to a person familiar with
the matter.  Citigroup Inc. and Morgan Stanley are managing the sale of
notes after a series of investor meetings in  Hong Kong ,
Singapore and London, said the person, who asked not to be
identified because the details are private. The deal will be
benchmark in size, which typically means at least $500 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:  Shelley Smith  in Hong Kong at
