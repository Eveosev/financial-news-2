  BP Plc â€™s Russian oil venture agreed
on an 18-year gas supply contract worth at least 240 billion
rubles ($8 billion) with OAO Inter RAO UES, a state-run power
utility, said Mikhail Slobodin, a TNK-BP vice president.  TNK-BP will deliver 3 billion to 3.5 billion cubic meters
of gas a year to the Nizhnevartovsk power plant, Slobodin told
reporters today. The Moscow-based oil venture owns just over 25
percent of the generator.  To contact the reporter on this story:
