  Bank of America Corp . overpaid for
Merrill Lynch & Co. in a deal struck the same day Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc. filed for bankruptcy in 2008, billionaire  Warren Buffett  said.  Ken Lewis, then the chief executive officer of Charlotte,
North Carolina-based Bank of America, “paid a crazy price, in
my view,” Buffett said in remarks released today by the
Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission. “He could have bought them
the next day for nothing because Merrill was going to go when
Lehman went.” Bank of America completed its $18.5 billion
purchase of Merrill Lynch in January of 2009.  To contact the reporters on this story:
