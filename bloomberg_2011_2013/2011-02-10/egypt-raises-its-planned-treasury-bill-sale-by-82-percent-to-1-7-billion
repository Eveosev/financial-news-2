  Egypt , rocked by the worst political
turmoil in 30 years, increased the size of Treasury bills at
auctions today and Feb. 13 by 82 percent as it struggles to fund
a deficit and rebuild an economy hurt by two weeks of protests.  The finance ministry plans to sell a combined 10 billion
pounds ($1.7 billion) of 91-day, 182-day and 266-day bills
compared with a previous 5.5 billion pounds, according to
central bank data on Bloomberg. It will auction 3.5 billion
pounds of the six-month notes today.  “Given that appetite from local banks was pretty strong
for the previous auction, now they want to increase the offer to
test the market again,” said John Sfakianakis, chief economist
at Banque Saudi Fransi. “For sure it will be oversubscribed
even if they don’t have appetite from international investors.”  Demonstrations aimed at ending President  Hosni Mubarak ’s
three-decade-old rule pushed the yields on local Treasury bills
to the highest level in two years and weakened the currency. The
central bank’s purchases of pounds this week has helped  currency
markets  return to an “orderly” state, Deputy Central Bank
Governor Hisham Ramez said yesterday.  The Ministry of Finance, which was seeking to sell 15
billion pounds of debt at an auction on Feb. 7, raised 13
billion pounds. The average yield on the 91-day bills rose 147
basis points to 10.97 percent and the average yield on 182-day
bills climbed 86 basis points to 11.5 percent. The yield on the
273-day bills gained 120 basis points to 11.65 percent.  Rising Yields  The yield on the 5.75 percent dollar bond maturing in April
2020 gained 23 basis points to 6.59 percent yesterday, the
highest since Feb. 2, according to Bloomberg composite prices.
The cost of insuring the nation’s sovereign debt dropped less
than 1 basis point from yesterday’s London close to 354 today,
according to CMA London prices. Egypt’s stock exchange shut Jan.
27 after losing 16 percent that week as protests intensified.  The central bank, which sells the notes for the Ministry of
Finance, will auction 3 billion pounds of three-month bills and
3.5 billion pounds in 266-day notes on Feb. 13, according to
central bank data.  Protests that began Jan. 25, inspired by an uprising
thatousted Tunisian President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali on Jan.
14, have left about 300 people dead, according to United Nations
estimates. Egypt’s foreign minister Ahmed Aboul Gheit said in
comments to  Al Arabiya  aired this morning it will take four
months to change the country’s constitution after the
administration of U.S. President  Barack Obama  criticized
Mubarak’s government for not sufficiently addressing the demands
of protesters.  Rebuild Economy  Spending may push Egypt’s deficit into “double digits” in
2011 from 8.1 percent in the fiscal year that ended in June,  Standard & Poor’s  said on Feb. 1. Egypt’s transition government,
led by Vice President  Omar Suleiman , has promised higher wages
for government workers and  unemployment benefits  to those who
lost jobs in the past two weeks in an effort to placate
protesters.  Inflation accelerated to an annual rate of 10.8 percent in
January from 10.3 percent in the previous month, the state-run
Central Agency for Public Mobilization and Statistics, said on
its website today.  “The government needs the money to rebuild the economy,”
Mona Mansour, a director at the research department of CI
Capital, an Egyptian investment bank, said today. Egypt will
need to fund the planned 15 percent increase in wages and
pensions announced by Finance Minister Samir Radwan, she said.  The Egyptian pound strengthened from a six-year low this
week after the central bank intervened to slow declines. The
currency declined 0.1 percent to 5.8863 against the  U.S. dollar 
as of 10:28 a.m. in Cairo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
