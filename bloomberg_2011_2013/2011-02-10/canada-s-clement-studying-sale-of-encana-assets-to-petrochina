Canadian Industry Minister Tony
Clement is studying the planned sale of a 50 percent stake in  Encana Corp .’s Cutbank Ridge gas assets to PetroChina Co.,
according to a statement from his office.  “The Minister is looking to see how the Investment Canada
Act applies to the proposed transaction,” Gemma Collins,
Clement’s director of communications, said in an e-mailed
statement.  Under the Investment Canada Act, the government can block
large transactions if it finds they don’t provide a “net
benefit” to the country.  To contact the reporter on this story:
