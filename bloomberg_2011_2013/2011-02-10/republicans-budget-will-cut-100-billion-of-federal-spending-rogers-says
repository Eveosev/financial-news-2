House Republicans will seek $100
billion in spending cuts this fiscal year, $26 billion more than
planned earlier, a top Republican said after coming under
pressure from party members who said savings announced yesterday
were inadequate.  “Our intent is to make deep but manageable cuts in nearly
every area of government, leaving no stone unturned and allowing
no agency or program to be held sacred,” House Appropriations
Committee Chairman Harold Rogers, a Kentucky Republican, said in
a statement. “We are continuing to work to complete this
critical legislation.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
