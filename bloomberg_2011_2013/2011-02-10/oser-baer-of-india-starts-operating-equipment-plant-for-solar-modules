  First Solar Inc ., the world’s
biggest maker of thin-film photovoltaic panels, won an order for
25 megawatts of modules from  Moser Baer India Ltd .  Delivery is expected by June 30, the companies said in a
joint statement. They didn’t disclose the value of the deal or
where the modules would be used.  Moser Baer, India’s second-biggest solar cell manufacturer,

300 megawatts of power at peak hours when the sun is strongest,
according to the statement.  Moser Baer’s two power units, Moser Baer Clean Energy Ltd.
and Moser Baer Projects Pvt., are jointly developing 1,200
megawatts of renewable energy projects, including hydropower and
