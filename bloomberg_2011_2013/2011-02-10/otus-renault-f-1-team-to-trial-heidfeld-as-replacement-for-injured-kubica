The Lotus Renault Formula One team
will give Nick Heidfeld the chance to prove himself as a
possible replacement for injured driver  Robert Kubica  in testing
this weekend.  Heidfeld, 33, who has raced for five different teams in an
11-year career, will test alongside No. 2 driver Vitaly Petrov
as well as first reserve Bruno Senna in Jerez,  Spain , Lotus
Renault said last night in an e-mailed statement.  “The team will give mileage to Bruno Senna and will also
evaluate Nick Heidfeld, who is a potential replacement for
Robert Kubica as a race driver,” Lotus Renault said.  Kubica, 26, is recovering in an Italian hospital after
suffering multiple fractures during a Feb. 6 rallying accident.
He underwent a seven-hour operation four days ago to rebuild the
functions of his right forearm and will have further surgery
today to stabilize fractures to his right shoulder and right
foot. The season-opening Bahrain Grand Prix is March 13.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
