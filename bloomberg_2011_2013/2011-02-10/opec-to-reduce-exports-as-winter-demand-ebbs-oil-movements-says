The Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries will reduce oil shipments this month as
demand for winter fuels in the northern hemisphere fades,
according to tanker-tracker Oil Movements.  Loadings will slip to 23.79 million barrels a day in the
four weeks to Feb. 26, down 0.6 percent from 23.94 million
barrels a day in the period to Jan. 29, the tanker-tracker said
today in a report. The data exclude  Angola  and Ecuador. It’s the
first monthly decrease since the four weeks to Feb. 5.  OPEC said in a monthly report today that supply concerns
that have pushed oil through $100 a barrel in  London  are
“unfounded.” Brent traded around $101 today amid speculation
unrest in  Egypt  may disrupt Middle East oil exports. Global
crude demand will slide by 0.4 percent in the second quarter
while refiners perform seasonal maintenance, according to OPEC.  Exports from Middle Eastern producers, including non-OPEC
members Oman and Yemen, will fall by 1.6 percent to 17.58
million barrels a day, Oil Movements’ data show.  A total of 484.73 million barrels of crude will be on board
tankers in the month to Feb. 26, down 0.3 percent from the Jan.
29 figure of 486.08 million, according to Oil Movements, which
calculates shipments by keeping a tally of tanker-rental
agreements. Its figures exclude crude held on board ships used
as floating storage.  OPEC’s members are Algeria, Angola, Ecuador,  Iran , Iraq,
Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar,  Saudi Arabia , the United Arab
Emirates and Venezuela. Iraq is exempt from the quota system.  To contact the reporter on this story:
