Egyptian President  Hosni Mubarak 
will decide “within hours” whether he will step down or not,

the president plans to step down today. “The decision will be
taken within hours by the governing bodies of the country and by
the authorities of the country and by the president of the
country. He has to decide himself whether he leaves or not.”  Mubarak will address the nation from his headquarters in
