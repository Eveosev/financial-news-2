  Rolls-Royce Group Plc , the world’s
second-largest aircraft-engine maker, posted its first decline
in annual profit in almost a decade because of the cost to fix
faulty A380 superjumbo engines and develop new turbines.  Earnings, excluding revaluation of currency hedging
contracts, fell to 719 million pounds ($1.16 billion) from 728
million pounds, the London-based company said. Analysts
predicted 713.7 million pounds. Rolls-Royce said it incurred
costs of 56 million pounds from the explosion of an engine in
mid-flight on Nov. 4.  The disintegration of the Trent 900 engine on the  Qantas
Airways Ltd . flight forced the airline to temporarily ground its
A380 fleet, and manufacturer Airbus SAS had to take some new
engines off the assembly line to swap for faulty ones already in
service. The companies have vowed to claw back costs from Rolls-
Royce. “Modest” additional costs from the Trent 900 failure
may arise in 2011, Chief Executive Officer John Rose said today.  “The bulls can’t say it was tremendous and the bears can’t
say it was bad,” said Jason Adams, an analyst at Nomura
International with a “buy” rating on Rolls-Royce. “There’ll
be some relief in the market that it sounds like the financial
liabilities from the Trent 900 fallout have been contained.”  Rolls-Royce shares fell 1.3 percent to 647 pence in  London 
trading as of 8:37 a.m.  Airbus Disruption  The bulk of the Trent 900 costs have now been booked, and
details of settlements with clients are commercially sensitive,
Rose said, when asked if charges could extend beyond 2011.
The company is “working hard to minimize disruptions” to
Airbus’s A380 delivery schedule this year, he said.  The CEO declined to give specifics on the production ramp-
up required to facilitate deliveries and said it was ”too
early” to tell whether Airbus’s delivery schedule for the year
will be affected. Airbus had aimed to deliver about 25 A380s
this year, equipped with both Trent 900s and with  power plants 
made by the Engine Alliance, a joint venture of  General Electric
Co . and United Technologies Corp.’s Pratt & Whitney.  Rose, who will step down next month after 14 years at the
helm, said he plans to take a “long holiday.”  The 58-year-old parts with a forecast that underlying
earnings will show “good” growth in 2011 and a pledge to boost
the full-year dividend by 6.7 percent to 16 pence a share.  Rolls-Royce will boost spending on research and development
this year to fund more young programs such as the Trent XWB,
designed for Airbus SAS’s forthcoming A350 plane. R&D costs
totaled 923 million pounds in 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
