Real Madrid is the richest soccer
team by sales for a sixth straight year, according to accountant
Deloitte LLP. Manchester City climbed the most of the top 20
clubs and AS Roma dropped six places.  Real hosted last year’s Champions League final, helping
boost sales through June 2010 by 9.3 percent to 438.6 million
euros ($600 million), Deloitte said.  Barcelona  was the next-
biggest earner as more broadcast revenue helped sales increase
by 8.8 percent to 398.1 million euros.  Real Madrid and Barcelona lead the so-called “Money
League” partly because Spanish clubs negotiate their own
television rights deals, unlike teams in  England ’s Premier
League.  Manchester United  was third in the list as sales rose 3
percent to 286.4 million pounds ($461 million), or 349.8 million
euros.  The combined revenue of the 20 clubs in the list rose 8
percent to 4.3 billion euros.  “We expect a battle between  Spain ’s two super clubs for
top spot in the Money League for the next few years at least,”
Deloitte said in its report.  In November, champion Barcelona and Real Madrid, who lead
the Spanish league again this season, agreed to a collective
bargaining accord with smaller Spanish league clubs from 2015.
This would reduce the two biggest teams’ share of television
revenue to 30 percent from 50 percent, according to league
officials.  Inter Overtaken    Manchester City  rose nine places to 11th as income climbed
more than 40 percent to 152.8 million euros. Spending on players
by owner Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan helped improved
sponsorship deals with companies such as Etihad Airways and
apparel maker Umbro Plc, Deloitte said.  In October, City said its loss in the year ended May 31
widened to 121.3 million pounds from 92.6 million pounds the
year before. Wages rose 61 percent to 133.3 million pounds.  Inter Milan remained ninth and was overtaken by AC Milan,
now seventh, even after an unprecedented season when it won the
Champions League and the Italian league and cup. AC Milan’s
income rose 20 percent to 235.8 million euros on more broadcast
money, while Inter’s revenue gained 14 percent to 224.8 million
euros, Deloitte said.  AC Milan “faces a struggle” to maintain the same level of
TV income because Italian soccer league now sells broadcast
rights collectively from this season, Deloitte said.  Roma Dropped  Roma dropped six places to 18th as sales fell 16 percent to
122.7 million euros. Failure to qualify for last season’s
Champions League reduced its television income, Deloitte said. A
group of U.S. investors led by Boston Red Sox partner Thomas DiBenedetto is in exclusive talks to buy the Italian club from
UniCredit SpA and the Sensi family, both parties said last week.  While Roma is back in the Champions League this season, it
will need to accelerate plans for a new stadium “to compete
with its European peers in the longer term,” Deloitte said.
“We do not anticipate return to the Money League top 10 for
Roma in the foreseeable future.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
