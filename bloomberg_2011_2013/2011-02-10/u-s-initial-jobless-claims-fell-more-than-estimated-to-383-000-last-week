The number of Americans filing
first-time claims for  unemployment insurance  fell to the lowest
level since July 2008 last week, showing further strength in the
labor market after the jobless rate declined to a 21-month low.  Applications for jobless benefits decreased by 36,000, more
than forecast, to 383,000 in the week ended Feb. 4, Labor
Department figures showed today. Economists forecast claims
would fall to 410,000, according to the median estimate in a
Bloomberg News survey. The total number of people receiving
unemployment insurance fell, while those collecting extended
payments increased.  A slowdown in firings means U.S. companies may begin
creating enough jobs to keep unemployment going down after the
rate’s biggest two-month decline since 1958. Federal Reserve
Chairman Ben S. Bernanke yesterday said the jobless rate will
likely stay high “for some time” as companies remain reluctant
to add to payrolls.  “The labor market is improving,” said Brian Jones, an
economist at Societe Generale in  New York  who projected claims
would drop to 385,000. “Fingers crossed, if the weather can
hold off this week, we should get a pretty decent snap back in
non-farm payrolls and maybe another drop in the jobless
rate.”  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index expiring next
month fell 0.5 percent to 1,312.80 at 8:34 a.m. in New York. The
yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which moves inversely to
price, rose to 3.68 percent from 3.65 percent late yesterday.  Economist Estimates  Estimates in the Bloomberg News survey of 51 economists
ranged from 385,000 to 450,000. The Labor Department initially
reported the prior week’s figure as 415,000.  A Labor Department official said the claims are still
unwinding previous effects of bad winter weather.  The four-week moving average, a less volatile measure, fell
to 415,500 from 431,500 the prior week.  The number of people continuing to collect jobless benefits
fell by 47,000 in the week ended Jan. 29 to 3.89 million.
Economists forecast the number would decline to 3.9 million.
Figures for continuing claims do not include the number of
workers receiving extended benefits under federal programs.  Those who’ve used up their traditional benefits and are now
collecting emergency and extended payments increased by 84,000
to 4.64 million in the week ended Jan. 22.  Jobless Rate  The  unemployment rate  among people eligible for benefits,
which tends to track the jobless rate, held at 3.1 percent.  Eighteen states and territories reported an increase in
claims, while 35 had a decrease.  Initial jobless claims reflect weekly firings and tend to
fall as job growth -- measured by the monthly non-farm payrolls
report -- accelerates.  Awaiting signs of sustained  job creation , central bank
policy makers are likely to keep  interest rates  near zero and
press ahead with plans to buy $600 billion in  Treasury
securities  to boost the pace of recovery.  Earlier this week a Labor Department report showed job
openings in the U.S. decreased by 139,000 to 3.06 million, the
fewest since September. The number of people hired also dropped
along with the number of workers fired.  Employers added a fewer-than-forecast 36,000 jobs to
payrolls in January as the unemployment rate unexpectedly fell
to 9 percent, the lowest since April 2009, according to Labor
Department figures released Feb. 4. Unemployment dropped to 9.4
percent in December from 9.8 percent the previous month.  Fed Chairman Bernanke told the House Budget Committee
yesterday that while the declines in the jobless rate in
December and January “do provide some grounds for optimism,”
companies need to hire more to reduce joblessness.  “With employers reportedly still reluctant to add to their
payrolls, it will be several years before the unemployment rate
has returned to a more normal level,” Bernanke said.  More Jobs  President  Barack Obama  this week urged leaders of U.S.
companies to create more jobs after he worked to improve the
business climate. A free-trade agreement with  South Korea , a
deal to extend Bush-era tax cuts, and proposals to support
infrastructure and innovation foster better conditions for
business investment, Obama said in a Feb. 7 speech to the U.S.
Chamber of Commerce.  “I’m hoping that all of you are thinking what you can do
for America,” Obama said. “Ask yourselves what you can do to
hire more American workers, what you can do to support the
American economy and invest in this nation.”  Continental Airlines said Feb. 7 it will eliminate 500 jobs
in Houston as it combines with  United Airlines , moving its
headquarters to  Chicago  from the Texas city where an estimated
3,000 people in management and administration are employed.  “We’re going through a careful process of trying to
determine the right organizational structure and location for
each department,”  Julie King , a spokeswoman for Continental,
said in an interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
