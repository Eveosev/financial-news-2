Investments in gold funds in  India ,
the world’s largest consumer of bullion, will top mutual fund
equity investments in the next three to four years, according to
Reliance Capital Asset Management Ltd.  Reliance Capital yesterday launched a gold fund-of-fund
which allows investments as small as 100 rupees ($2.19) a month.
The money raised will be invested in bullion through its gold-
backed exchange-traded fund, Sundeep Sikka, chief executive
officer of Reliance Capital Asset Management, said in a phone
interview yesterday.  Demand for gold as an investment in India surged 73 percent
in the 12 months ended Sept. 30, according to the World Gold
Council. Indian mutual funds had $1.65 trillion rupees of equity
investments as of Jan. 31, data on the Association of  Mutual
Funds  in India  website  shows.  “I am very bullish, this gold category will beat that in
the next 3 to 4 years time,” said Sikka, referring to mutual
funds investments in equities. “It’s a very simple thing - only
40 million investors are in the mutual fund industry, compared
to 500 million people are investors of gold in India.”  The gold fund is the first of its kind in India, Sikka
said. Investors don’t need to hold a so-called Demat account to
invest in the fund, he said.  “We are not selling gold to mutual fund investors, we are
getting gold investors to the mutual fund industry,” he said.
“In the long term we see the dollar weakening. With the overall
global environment, gold will be a good investment.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
