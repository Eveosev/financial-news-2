South African cement sales declined
4.6 percent to 641,860 metric tons in January compared with a
year earlier, the Cement & Concrete Institute said in an e-
mailed statement today.  Last month had one more sales day than January last year,
which, if taken into account, means sales fell by 9.1 percent,
the institute said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
