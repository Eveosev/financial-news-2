Nigerian police denied permission
for a demonstration in the capital, Abuja, by a local rights
group that wanted to show support for protesters in  Egypt  who
are demanding the end of President  Hosni Mubarak ’s 30-year rule.  “Now is not the time for this,” Umar Shehu, the deputy
police commissioner in charge of operations in Abuja, said by
phone today. The demonstration was due to take place in front of
the Egyptian Embassy.  The Civil Rights Congress called the protest to urge  Nigeria  and West African nations to take a “clear position” on
the unrest in Egypt, the group’s leader, Shehu Sani, said by
phone. The police’s decision to stop the march violated
fundamental human rights, he said.  “We will seek legal opinion from our counsel and then
we’ll take the next step,” he said. “We won’t do the protest
at all cost because we can’t guarantee the safety of our
people.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
