U.K. stocks fluctuated between gains
and losses as Egyptian President  Hosni Mubarak  defied calls for
his immediate resignation, increasing concern that the region
will become more unstable.    Ocado Group Plc  had a record drop as the John Lewis
Partnership Plc’s pension fund sold its entire shareholding in
the online grocer.  Carillion Plc  advanced 4.2 percent after
agreeing to buy Eaga Plc.  Guinness Peat Group Plc  surged 8.7
percent after announcing plans to sell assets and return the
proceeds to shareholders.  The benchmark  FTSE 100 Index  slipped 7.95, or 0.1 percent,
to 6,012.06 at 9:20 a.m. in  London , having earlier risen by the
same amount. The gauge has climbed 0.3 percent this week,
bringing its rally since March 2009 to 71 percent. The FTSE All-
Share Index also fell 0.1 percent today, while Ireland’s ISEQ
Index advanced 1.1 percent.  Mubarak, 82, reiterated he intends to stay on as president
of  Egypt  until September in a broadcast announcement last night,
raising concern his administration will fail to quell unrest
that the United Nations says has resulted in 300 deaths over the
past two weeks. The protests, inspired by the popular revolt in
Tunisia, have sparked concern contagion will grip a region that
holds more than 50 percent of the world’s known oil reserves.  ‘Regional Consequences’  “The chance of conflict has increased significantly,”
Timothy Ash, head of emerging-markets research at Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc, wrote in an e-mailed note late yesterday.
“Further instability in Egypt will have significant regional
consequences, raising concern over possible disruption of trade
through the Suez canal, oil prices, the regional peace process
and perhaps even further knock-on effects.”  Ocado lost 15 percent to 243.5 pence, the biggest drop
since its initial public offering in July, after  John Lewis ’s
pension plan sold its entire stake in the company for 265 pence
a share. The fund had 57.3 million Ocado shares, or a 10.4
percent holding, according to Bloomberg data.  Carillion Plc, which manages buildings for companies
including BT Group Plc, gained 4.2 percent to 401.4 pence as the
company agreed to buy energy-services provider Eaga for about
306.5 million pounds ($492 million).  Guinness Peat Group surged 8.7 percent to 37.5 pence, the
biggest gain since June. The owner of the world’s largest thread
maker is planning to sell most of its investments and return the
proceeds to shareholders. The assets are valued at about 610
million pounds, the company said.    Regal Petroleum Plc  lost 1.3 percent to 36.75 pence as Geo-
Alliance Oil-Gas Public Ltd. and Heamoor Ltd. said they don’t
plan to make a takeover offer for the oil and gas producer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
