Wheat futures plunged the most since
November on speculation that the highest prices in 29 months
will slow demand and encourage farmers to plant more.  U.S. exporters sold 507,310 metric tons in the week ended
Feb. 3, down 10 percent from a week earlier, the  U.S. Department
of Agriculture  said today. U.S.  spring-wheat  planting begins in
April, and the area sown with winter wheat for this year’s crop
is 9.8 percent bigger than last year, the USDA said last month.
Wheat futures are up 69 percent in the past year.  “High prices beget low prices,” said Dan Kuechenmeister,
the manager of the commodities department at RBC Dain Rauscher
in  Minneapolis . “All the agriculture markets are providing
great incentive to try to produce a big crop.”  Wheat futures for March delivery fell 23.25 cents, or 2.6
percent, to settle at $8.6275 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the  Chicago  Board of Trade, the biggest drop since Nov. 16.  Yesterday, the price touched $8.9325, the highest for a
most-active contract since Aug. 25, 2008, after the USDA cut its
 outlook  for global grain supplies. Drought last year slashed
output in  Russia , floods eroded crops in Canada and  Australia ,
and dry weather in the U.S. threatened winter crops.  Wheat was the fourth most-valuable U.S. crop in 2009 at
$10.6 billion, behind corn, soybeans and hay, government data
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
