(Corrects year of earlier offering in fifth paragraph.)  Facebook Inc. may allow employees to
sell as much as $1 billion of shares in an offering that would
place the company’s value at $60 billion, the Wall Street
Journal reported on its All Things Digital blog, citing
unidentified people close to the situation.  The social-networking company wants to give employees a
chance to sell shares because an initial public offering isn’t
likely for at least a year,  All Things Digital  said.  A recent $1.5 billion investment led by  Goldman Sachs Group
Inc . valued Facebook at $50 billion. Investor demand for the
company is soaring on private markets as advertisers pay for the
attention of a user base that’s ballooned to more than 500
million. Ad spending on Facebook will more than double to $4.05
billion this year, according to researcher EMarketer Inc.  Facebook plans to start reporting financial results by
April 2012 even if it hasn’t held an IPO, according to a
document sent to prospective investors. The company would be
forced to make disclosures because it expects to have at least
500 shareholders by the end of this year, a threshold that makes
reporting results necessary under U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission rules, a person who reviewed the document said last
month.  In July 2009, Facebook allowed employees to sell as much as
$100 million in stock for $14.77 a share under an agreement with
Digital Sky Technologies, a Russian investment firm.  To contact the reporter on this story:
