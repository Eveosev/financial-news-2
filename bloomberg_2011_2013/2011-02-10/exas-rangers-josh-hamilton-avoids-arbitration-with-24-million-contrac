Texas Rangers outfielder  Josh Hamilton , the American League’s reigning Most Valuable Player,
avoided arbitration by agreeing to a two-year, $24 million
contract,  MLB.com said .  Hamilton, 29, received a $3 million signing bonus and will
make $7.25 million this season and $13.75 million in 2011,  Major
League Baseball  said on its website.  Hamilton was seeking $12 million a year, with an
arbitration hearing scheduled for Feb. 14, while the Rangers
were offering $8.7 million per season. The Rangers haven’t gone
to arbitration with a player since 2000.  Hamilton won his first MVP award even after fractured ribs
forced him to miss most of September, the final full month of
the regular season. He won the AL batting title with a .359
average, hit 32 home runs and drove in 100 runs to help the
Rangers win 90 games and make the playoffs for the first time
since 1999. Texas made it all the way to its first  World Series ,
losing to the  San Francisco Giants .  Hamilton originally was selected by Tampa Bay with the
first overall pick in the 1999 amateur draft. He didn’t reach
the major leagues until 2007 because of drug and alcohol
addiction. He has been an All-Star three straight seasons with
the Rangers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
