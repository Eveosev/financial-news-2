  Telkom SA Ltd . will present
proposals on voluntary severance and early retirement packages
on Feb. 15, trade union Solidarity said.  The company indicated to the union that it won’t negotiate
the content of the proposed packages, Solidarity spokesperson
Marius Croucamp said in an e-mailed statement today. The
packages take effect on April 1, a day after the expiry of a
2009 agreement between labor organizations and Telkom that
guaranteed employees’ job security until March 31.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
