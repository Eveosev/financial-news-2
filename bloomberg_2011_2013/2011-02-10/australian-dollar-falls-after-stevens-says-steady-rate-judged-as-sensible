The Australian dollar slid toward a
1 1/2-week low after Reserve Bank Governor Glenn Stevens told
parliament in Canberra policy makers had judged that keeping
interest rates steady was sensible.  The so-called Aussie touched $1.0013 before trading at
$1.0017 as of 9:52 a.m. in Sydney, from $1.0044 yesterday in  New
York . The currency reached $1.0010 yesterday, the weakest since
Feb. 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
