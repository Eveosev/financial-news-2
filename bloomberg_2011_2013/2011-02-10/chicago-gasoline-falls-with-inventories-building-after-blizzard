  Chicago  spot gasoline weakened with
government data showing Midwest inventories of the fuel
increased for the sixth consecutive week and levels on a product
pipeline system rose after severe weather curbed demand.  Gasoline stocks in Padd 2, which includes Chicago, rose 1.4
percent to 54 million barrels, the highest level since October,
according to the Energy Department. Early this month, Chicago
registered its third-largest snowstorm on record.  “Everything just shut down and that creates no demand,”
Lewis Adam, president of ADMO Energy LLC, a supply consultant in  Kansas City , said in a telephone interview. Inventories have
gained on the Magellan Midstream Partners LP pipeline that
carries fuel from Gulf Coast refineries to the Midwest, he said.  The discount for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in
Chicago weakened 4.5 cents to 13 cents a gallon versus futures
traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 4:20 p.m.,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It is the lowest level
since Nov. 24. Prompt delivery fell 10.12 cents to $2.3398 a
gallon.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel for the hub weakened 1 cent to a
discount of 7 cents a gallon.  To contact the reporter on this story:
