  Egypt ’s President  Hosni Mubarak  said
he’ll stick to his plan of remaining in office until elections
due in September, quashing rumors he planned to meet the demands
of protesters by handing over power.  In a televised address today, Mubarak said Egypt’s army
will oversee a transition period that will help meet “just”
demands from protesters. He said initial proposals for
constitutional change include canceling six articles of the
charter. Mubarak also said he has given orders for the
cancellation of Egypt’s emergency law once the current protests
end.  To contact the reporter on this story:
