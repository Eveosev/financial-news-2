OPEC’s compliance with record supply
cuts dropped to a two-year low in January, as the  United Arab
Emirates ,  Angola , Libya and Venezuela boosted production, the  International Energy Agency  said.  The 11 members bound by quotas pumped 27.2 million barrels
a day last month, implying compliance of 44 percent, the Paris-
based IEA said today in its monthly report. That’s down from 45
percent in December.  Daily supply from all 12 nations of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries, including Iraq, increased by
280,000 barrels to 29.85 million, it said. Output declined from  Iran  and  Nigeria .  “In the wake of higher prices and stronger demand, market
attention in January focused on whether the producer group will
formally increase production ahead of the next scheduled
ministerial meeting in Vienna on June 2,” the IEA said.  OPEC, responsible for about 40 percent of world crude
supply, announced its biggest-ever supply cuts in late 2008 as
global demand collapsed. The decision set a cap at 24.845
million barrels a day for 11 of its members. Adherence to the
reduction eased last year and in 2009 as prices rebounded.  The compliance percentages are calculated based on the 11
nations targeting a 4.2 million barrel-a-day reduction from a
base production rate of 29.045 million barrels a day in
September 2008.    Saudi Arabia , OPEC’s largest producer, pumped 8.6 million
barrels a day in January, unchanged from December, the IEA said.  Iraq’s daily output rose 210,000 barrels to the highest in
more than two decades, reaching 2.66 million barrels a day last
month, the organization said.  OPEC’s 12 members are Algeria, Angola, Ecuador, Iran, Iraq,
Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab
Emirates and Venezuela. Iraq is exempt from the quota system.  To contact the reporter on this story:
