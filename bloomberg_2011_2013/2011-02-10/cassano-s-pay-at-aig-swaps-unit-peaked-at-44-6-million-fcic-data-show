  Joseph Cassano , whose derivative
bets on subprime mortgages drove  American International Group
Inc . into a U.S. bailout, was paid more than $40 million in 2003
and in 2006.  Cassano’s net cash compensation at New York-based AIG was
$44.6 million in 2003, according to a  document  released by the
Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission on its website.  Cassano stepped down in 2008 after the company reported a
$5.29 billion quarterly loss fueled by credit-default swaps from
his unit protecting investors against losses on mortgage-linked
securities. The FCIC has said financial firms were uninformed
about the risk of derivatives and that soaring pay on  Wall
Street  encouraged reckless trades.  “When clarity mattered most, Wall Street and  Washington 
were flying blind,” FCIC Chairman Phil Angelides said in June.
“In the case of derivatives, my fellow commissioners and I are
seeing something we’ve seen many times in our investigation:
enormous risk, reckless leverage, and early warning signs being
ignored.”  AIG was bailed out in September 2008 in a rescue that
swelled to $182.3 billion. Cassano’s net cash compensation in
2006 was $43.7 million, the FCIC document shows. The total in
the eight years through 2007 was about $280 million, a figure
previously reported by U.S. Representative Henry Waxman.  To contact the reporter on this story:
