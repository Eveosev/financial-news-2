Facebook Inc. may explore a $1
billion tender offer of shares owned by its employees that may
place the company’s value at $60 billion, the Wall Street
Journal reported, citing unidentified people close to the
situation.  The reason for the offering is to give liquidity to the
employees because an initial public offering isn’t likely for at
least a year, the Journal said.   A recent $1.5 billion investment by  Goldman Sachs Group
Inc . valued the company at $50 billion, the Journal said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
