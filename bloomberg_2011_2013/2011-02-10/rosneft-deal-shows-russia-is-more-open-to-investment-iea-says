  BP Plc ’s $8 billion share swap with
OAO Rosneft last month shows that Russia is more open to foreign
investment than in the past, according to the International
Energy Agency.  “It may signal the Russian government’s realization that
it requires  cash flow , project management experience and
technology from the majors,” the Paris-based  adviser  said today
in its monthly Oil Market Report. “This marks a significant
change from the status quo, in which offshore areas are
currently open only to state controlled Russian companies.”  The BP deal, which gives the London-based producer access
to exploration in the Arctic Kara Sea, is the biggest so far
between a Western company and Rosneft.  Exxon Mobil Corp . signed
a $1 billion agreement to explore in the  Black Sea , and Royal
Dutch Shell Plc is also seeking partnership with Rosneft for
upstream projects.  Russia may be more willing to make concessions to western
companies now after the country’s oil supply growth weakened
since 2005, the  IEA said . Russia’s offshore basins are largely
unexplored and are key to future growth, according to the
report.  “The deal may mark a more realistic attitude towards
foreign investment in its hydrocarbons sector by the Russian
government,” the IEA said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
