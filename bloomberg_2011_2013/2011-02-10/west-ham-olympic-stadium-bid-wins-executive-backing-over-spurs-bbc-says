English Premier League soccer club
West Ham United won executive support in its bid to use  London ’s
Olympic stadium after next year’s Summer Games, the British
Broadcasting Corp. reported.  Executives from the Olympic Park Legacy Company have
decided that West Ham’s offer, which would retain the athletics
track, is better than a bid from rival London club Tottenham,
the BBC said, without saying where it got the information.  The Olympic Park Legacy Company’s board will vote tomorrow
to recommend a preferred bidder for the stadium in east London,
the legacy company  said yesterday  on its website. The decision
will be subject to approval by the U.K. government and London
Mayor  Boris Johnson .  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
