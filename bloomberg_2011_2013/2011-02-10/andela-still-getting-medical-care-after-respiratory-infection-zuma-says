  Nelson Mandela , South  Africa ’s first
black president who contracted an acute respiratory infection
last month, is still receiving medical care and is being kept
comfortable, said President Jacob Zuma.  “We need to accept the reality that President Mandela, who
is loved by all of us, young and old, men and women, black and
white, is not young anymore,” Zuma said in his state-of-the-
nation address to Parliament in  Cape Town  today. “He will from
time to time visit medical facilities for checkups, which is
normal for a person of his age.”  Mandela spent two nights in a Johannesburg hospital last
month, prompting widespread concern over the 92-year-old’s
health. The Nobel peace-prize winner served for five years as
president following  South Africa ’s first all-race elections in
1994.  The public should allow Mandela’s “family and the medical
team the space to look after him, on our behalf, in privacy,”
Zuma said. “We owe him that much given his love of this country
and its people, and the contribution he has made to South
Africa, Africa and the world.”  Mandela suffered from tuberculosis in Robben Island prison,
where he spent most of his 27-year jail term for fighting
against the apartheid government, and has also had respiratory
infections in the past. He was treated for prostate cancer in
2001.  To contact the reporter on this story:
