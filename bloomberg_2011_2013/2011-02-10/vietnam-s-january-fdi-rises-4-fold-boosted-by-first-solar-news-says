Vietnam’s total registered foreign
investment reached about $1.2 billion in January, a fourfold
increase on a year earlier, largely due to U.S. solar power
company  First Solar Inc . receiving an investment permit to build
a $1 billion factory, Vietnam News reported, citing the Foreign
Investment Agency.  First Solar expects to begin construction of the plant,
near  Ho Chi Minh City , this month and be ready for operations
next year, Vietnam News reported, citing Tymen de Jong, First
Solar’s vice president. The company will invest $300 million in
the project’s first phase, which will last until 2012, according
to the newspaper.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
