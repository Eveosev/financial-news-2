  Credit Suisse Group AG ,  Switzerland ’s second-biggest bank, cut variable compensation by
25 percent for 2010, Chief Financial Officer  David Mathers  told
journalists on a conference call today.  The Zurich-based bank paid about 6.85 billion Swiss francs
($7.13 billion) in bonuses for 2009, meaning its bonus pool for
2010 shrank to about 5.14 billion francs.  Credit Suisse follows Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and JPMorgan
Chase & Co. in cutting 2010 compensation for traders, investment
bankers and other employees in response to a drop in revenue and
increased regulatory pressure.  UBS AG , Switzerland’s biggest
bank, said this week it cut the 2010 bonus pool by 10 percent to
4.3 billion francs, including 1.55 billion francs deferred into
future years.  “We think it’s probably competitive pay but obviously it
also represents a disciplined approach,” Credit Suisse Chief
Executive Officer Brady Dougan told Bloomberg Television in an
interview today.  Members of the executive board will not get any cash bonus
for 2010, Dougan told journalists at a press conference in
Zurich, adding that the bank will publish more details on
compensation in its annual report planned for March.  Credit Suisse cut its goal for profitability today to
reflect stricter capital rules and reported fourth-quarter
earnings that missed analysts’ estimates. The bank will now aim
for return on equity of more than 15 percent, down from a
previous target of more than 18 percent. Net income rose 6
percent to 841 million francs, less than the 928 million-franc
estimate of analysts.  Credit Suisse said in January that it will lower the cash
portion of bonuses and defer awards for more people, as it cut
the threshold for deferred compensation to 50,000 francs for
2010 from 125,000 francs previously.  “Credit Suisse’s compensation structure from 2010 is one
of the most stringent compensation rules globally,” JPMorgan
Cazenove analysts led by  Kian Abouhossein  wrote in a January
note to clients.  To contact the reporters on this story:
