Vue Entertainment Ltd., the U.K.
cinema operator bought by  Doughty Hanson  & Co. last year, is in
negotiations to purchase a European chain in a deal valued as
much as 500 million pounds ($802 million), according to a person
with direct knowledge of the talks.  Vue is negotiating with four to five mainland  Europe  cinema
operators after deciding not to pursue U.K. rivals  Cineworld
Group Plc  or Odeon & UCI Cinemas Group on competition concerns,
the person said, declining to be named as the talks are
confidential.  Private-equity firm Doughty Hanson in November agreed to
buy Vue, the U.K.’s third-largest cinema operator, from managers
and an affiliated investment fund,  Och-Ziff Capital Management
Group , for 450 million pounds. Vue’s management team, including
founder and Chief Executive Officer Tim Richards, would “be
reinvesting in the transaction,” Doughty Hanson said at the
time.  Initially, London-based Vue aimed to buy a competitor in
the U.K. or mainland Europe with funds from the Doughty Hanson
acquisition, the person said. A spokesman for Vue declined to
comment.  No investment bank has yet been hired, said the person,
adding that Vue plans to reach an agreement this year.  Vue Entertainment operates more than 650 cinema screens
with more than 140,000 seats in the U.K. and Ireland, according
to the company’s website. Vue also operates a nine-screen cinema
in Faro,  Portugal  and a 13-screen cinema in Taipei, Taiwan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
