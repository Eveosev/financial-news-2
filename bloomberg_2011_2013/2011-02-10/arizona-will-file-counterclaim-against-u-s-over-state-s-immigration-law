  Arizona  plans to file a counterclaim
today to the federal challenge of a state immigration law that
requires police officers to check the immigration status of
people stopped for questioning.  Governor Janice Brewer and Attorney General Tom Horne
announced the plan today at a news conference in Phoenix, saying
the federal government failed to control the border that the
16th-most-populous state shares with  Mexico .  “It’s the federal government’s responsibility to protect
the public safety, health and welfare of the people of our
country,” Brewer said.  Brewer in April signed the law, which spurred protests and
court challenges, including the U.S. Justice Department lawsuit.
Opponents argued the measure would invite racial profiling.
Brewer has said the law responds to the federal government’s
failure to curb illegal immigration.  Under the law, an officer can ask a person about his or her
status after having a “reasonable suspicion” that another law
has been broken, according to Brewer’s website.  President  Barack Obama  has criticized the measure and urged
Congress to overhaul the nation’s immigration policies, saying
in April that failure to do so would lead to “misguided”
efforts such as Arizona’s law.  The state had an estimated 460,000 illegal immigrants as of
January 2009, according to a Department of Homeland Security
 report . Its total population was 6.6 million that year,
according to Census figures.  Illegal immigration costs the state $1 billion a year,
Brewer said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
