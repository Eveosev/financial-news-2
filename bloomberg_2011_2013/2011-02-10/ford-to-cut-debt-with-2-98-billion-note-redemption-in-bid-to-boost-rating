  Ford Motor Co ., the second-largest
U.S. automaker, will redeem $2.98 billion in convertible notes
in March as the company works on gaining an investment-grade  credit rating .  The 6.5 percent Cumulative Convertible Trust Preferred
Securities will be redeemed for about $50.87, including unpaid
distributions, Dearborn, Michigan-based Ford said today in a
statement. Holders also can convert their notes into shares at a
rate of 2.877 shares per trust security, the company said.  Ford reduced debt by $14.5 billion last year, with
obligations in its automotive operations falling to $19.1
billion at the end of 2010 from $33.6 billion a year earlier,
the company said. Ford said it had $20.5 billion in automotive
cash as of Dec. 31, the first time cash exceeded liabilities
since the second quarter of 2008.  "We believe this strengthens our balance sheet," said David
Brandi, Ford’s assistant treasurer. "We recognize we still have
more to do to strengthen the balance sheet."  The action, which will result in a first-quarter cost of as
much as $60 million, will reduce annual interest expenses by 
about $190 million, Ford said.  Moody’s Investors Service changed its outlook on Ford to
positive from stable on Jan. 28. Moody’s said in a statement
that Ford’s progress in improving its balance sheet “could
support a rating upgrade during the next 12 to 18 months.”
Moody’s rates Ford Ba2, the second level below investment grade,
and  Standard & Poor’s  rates it BB-, three steps below.  Ford lost its investment-grade ratings in 2005 as rising
gasoline prices and falling truck sales led to $30 billion in
losses from 2006 through 2008. Ford earned $6.56 billion in
2010, the most since 1999.  To contact the reporter on this story:
