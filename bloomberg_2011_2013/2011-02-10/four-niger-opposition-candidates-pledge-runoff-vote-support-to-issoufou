Four opposition candidates who
contested the first round of Niger’s presidential election last
month pledged their support to Mahamadou Issoufou in the March
12 runoff, he said today.  The four candidates received about 28 percent of the Jan.
31 vote. Issoufou, who got 36.1 percent, is running against
Seini Oumarou, the candidate of ex-President Mamadou Tandja’s
party, who won 23.2 percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
