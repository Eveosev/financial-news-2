More fans who bought tickets
for temporary seating at the  Super Bowl  five days ago are
going to get compensation.  The  National Football League  will give a face-value
refund or a ticket to any future Super Bowl to about 2,000
fans whose entry to Cowboys Stadium in Arlington,  Texas ,
was delayed Feb. 6 because of installation problems with
other temporary seating.  The offer is separate to the ones made to about 400
fans who were prevented from taking their seats for the
Super Bowl, the NFL said yesterday in an e-mailed
statement.  NFL officials have contacted 260 of the 400 fans who
had to watch the game on television screens inside the
stadium, the statement said. Those fans can accept $2,400
and a ticket for next year’s Super Bowl, or a ticket for
any future Super Bowl plus airfare and hotel
accommodations.  “We screwed it up, I can’t change that,” NFL
Executive Vice President Eric Grubman told ESPN 970-AM in
Pittsburgh yesterday. “If that would have happened to me,
I would be furious.”  Should next year’s Super Bowl in Indianapolis be
canceled because of a work stoppage caused by a lack of a
new collective bargaining agreement between team owners and
the players’ union, ticketholders can opt to attend the
subsequent title game.  The NFL and Dallas Cowboys owner  Jerry Jones  installed
13,000 temporary seats in a bid to break the Super Bowl
attendance record. Fire marshals allowed 11,740 seats to be
used, taking the attendance for the game to 103,219, 766
fewer than watched the 1980 Super Bowl at the Rose Bowl in  Pasadena ,  California .  Suing Cowboys’ Jones  Some Cowboys season-ticket holders who say they were
promised prime Super Bowl seats and were instead given
folding chairs with obstructed views are suing Jones, his
team and the NFL. The plaintiffs are seeking more than $5
million in actual damages, which can be tripled under
Texas’ trade law, in addition to unspecified punitive
damages.  The  Green Bay Packers  beat the Pittsburgh Steelers 31-
25 to secure a fourth Super Bowl title and record-extending
13th NFL championship.  TICKETS ELIGIBLE FOR FACE-VALUE REFUND
