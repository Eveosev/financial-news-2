Niger presidential candidate
Mahamadou Issoufou said if he is elected in a March 12 runoff he
won’t revise mining contracts signed between Niger and several
foreign companies.  “I would not cancel and revise the contracts. The state’s
action is continuity,” Issoufou said during an interview on the
Panafrican television station Vox Africa. Nigeriens “certainly
have the feeling that Niger has not benefited sufficiently from
the uranium markets,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
