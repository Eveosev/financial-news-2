  China ’s oil demand growth may slow
“noticeably” this year as the economy expands at a reduced
pace and the country improves  energy efficiency , according to
the  International Energy Agency .  China, which consumes more oil than any country except the
U.S., may boost efficiency as it burns more natural gas and
restricts car use, according to the energy security adviser to
the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Fuel
demand may increase 6 percent this year, from 12 percent in
2010, the IEA said today in its monthly Oil Market Report.  “The economy should cool down slightly, gasoil shortages
ease and oil intensity fall,” the Paris-based agency said.
“New sources of energy should provide some degree of inter-fuel
substitution.”  Crude futures in  New York  have rallied 17 percent in the
past year as emerging economies including China led a global
economic recovery. The IEA estimated the country’s fuel demand
was 9.39 million barrels a day in 2010, up 0.6 percent from the
9.34 million forecast in its previous report Jan. 18. This
year’s consumption may rise to 9.96 million, the agency said.  Gross domestic product in China may expand 9.5 percent this
year, compared with about 10 percent in 2010, according to the
median estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg. Government
measures to curb auto sales in the country, the world’s largest
car market, will further slow oil demand growth, according to
the IEA. Beijing had 306,865 applications for February’s lottery
of 20,000 new license plates for private cars, the official
Xinhua News agency said yesterday.  “China’s oil demand outlook has become increasingly
crucial for global oil balances,” the IEA said. “We remain
cautious so far, expecting China’s oil demand to rise by a much
more modest but nonetheless significant 570,000 barrels a day.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
