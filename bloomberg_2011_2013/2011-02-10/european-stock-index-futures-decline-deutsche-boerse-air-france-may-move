European stocks declined for a third
day, the longest stretch of losses since November, amid growing
concern that accelerating global inflation will lead to higher
borrowing costs.    Air France-KLM  Group tumbled 7.7 percent after reporting an
unexpected loss.  Credit Suisse Group AG  and Danske Bank A/S sank
more than 5 percent as earnings missed analysts’ estimates.  Deutsche Boerse AG  climbed 4.6 percent after the operator of the
Frankfurt exchange said it’s in talks to buy NYSE Euronext.  The benchmark Stoxx  Europe  600 Index fell 0.2 percent to
286.78 at the 4:30 p.m. close in  London . The gauge reached the
highest level since September 2008 earlier this week amid
optimism that the economic recovery is accelerating and policies
to support indebted countries using the euro will succeed. The
rally had pushed the measure to about 16 times the reported
earnings of its companies, near the highest level in nine
months, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “Institutional investors have been selling in the last few
days because of a fear of inflation,” said Martin Huefner,
chief economist at Assenagon GmbH in Munich, which has more than
$4.7 billion in client assets. “The optimistic view of a
cyclical recovery might be a bit exaggerated. We’re also a bit
worried about the performance of stocks in emerging markets.”  Benchmark Indexes  National benchmark indexes retreated in 14 of the 18
western European markets. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 dropped 0.5
percent, while France’s CAC 40 gained 0.1 percent and  Germany ’s
DAX advanced 0.3 percent. Greece’s ASE plunged 3.5 percent as  EFG Eurobank Ergasias SA  tumbled 9 percent to 4.33 euros.  The Stoxx 600 pared a decline of as much as 1 percent as a
report showed the number of Americans filing first-time claims
for  unemployment insurance  fell to the lowest since July 2008
last week.  In the U.K., the  Bank of England  kept up emergency stimulus
and maintained the benchmark interest rate at a record low of
0.5 percent today, as forecast by all economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News. Former rate setter DeAnne Julius said yesterday
that the bank needs to tighten policy “sooner rather than
later” or risk losing credibility.  Air France plunged 7.7 percent to 12.57 euros, the biggest
drop in a year. Europe’s second-biggest airline by sales posted
an unexpected loss in its fiscal third quarter of 46 million
euros ($62.6 million) and cut its full-year forecast.
Analysts had forecast net income of 60 million euros.  Lufthansa, IAG  Rival  Deutsche Lufthansa AG  dropped 2.5 percent to 15.50
euros. International Consolidated Airlines Group SA, owner of
British Airways and Iberia Lineas Aereas de Espana, slid 3.3
percent to 251 pence.  Credit Suisse, Switzerland’s second-largest bank, lost 5.8
percent to 42.1 francs, the biggest drop since May. Fourth-
quarter net income rose to 841 million francs ($871.3 million)
from 793 million francs a year earlier, missing the 928 million-
franc average projection of 18 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.
The bank said it will now aim for a return on equity, a measure
of profitability, of more than 15 percent, down from more than
18 percent previously.  Danske Bank sank 11 percent to 125.1 kroner after Denmark’s
largest lender said it plans a share sale of about 20 billion
kroner ($3.65 billion) and reported fourth-quarter profit that
missed estimates.    Diageo Plc  dropped 4.6 percent to 1,195 pence after the
world’s biggest distiller reported first-half revenue and profit
that missed analysts’ estimates as growth in developing markets
failed to offset declines in European countries including
Ireland and Greece.  TGS, Deutsche Boerse  TGS Nopec Geophysical Co. ASA slumped 4.4 percent to 137.6
kroner after reporting fourth-quarter net income of $56.6
million, down from $58.7 million a year earlier.  Deutsche Boerse advanced 4.6 percent to 61.10 euros. The
company’s acquisition of NYSE Euronext in an all-stock
transaction would create the world’s biggest exchange operator.
The combined organization would host publicly traded companies
worth about $15 trillion, or 28 percent of global stock-market
value, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Alcatel-Lucent SA rallied 19 percent to 3.16 euros, the
biggest gain since October 2008.  France ’s largest
telecommunications equipment maker posted fourth-quarter net
income that beat analysts’ estimates as revenue surged in its
networks division.  To contact the reporter on this story:  Julie Cruz  in Frankfurt at
