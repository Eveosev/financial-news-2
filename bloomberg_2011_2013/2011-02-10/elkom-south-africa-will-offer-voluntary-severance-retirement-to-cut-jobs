Telkom  South Africa  Ltd.,  Africa ’s
largest fixed-line phone company, will present proposals on
voluntary severance and early retirement to managers at the
company next week.  The reopening of a program to reduce staff numbers comes
about six weeks before the end of a moratorium on forced job
cuts. The company declined to say how many people the plan will
target, in an e-mailed response to questions today.  The voluntary packages will be offered from Feb. 21 to Mar.
18, according to an e-mailed statement from Solidarity, a labor
union with members at Telkom. The payments will take effect from
April 1.  The proposed staff reductions will cause Telkom to lose
“extremely skilled employees with irreplaceable and critical
expertise,” Solidarity said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
