The U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission is investigating whether exchange-traded funds are
being used to hide  insider trading , a person with knowledge of
the probe said.  The funds, which usually track an index and trade like
stocks, enable buyers to bet on price changes without trading
futures. An investor with non-public information about a company
may be able to hide illegal orders by trading in a fund that
includes that stock instead of buying or selling the equity
directly, the person said.  The number of exchange-traded funds has surged since they
were created in 1993, widening investorsâ€™ access to different
assets, including commodities. The SEC has said it is using
data-driven techniques to find patterns of insider trading and
market manipulation.  The probe was previously reported by the Financial Times.  To contact the reporter on this story:
