Brazil’s former central bank head  Henrique Meirelles  accepted President Dilma Rousseff’s
invitation to lead the country’s Olympic authority, according to
a government official with knowledge of the matter.  The announcement will be made after Congress approves the
creation of the Olympic body, said the official, who asked not
to be identified as the discussions aren’t yet public. Meirelles
declined to comment by telephone yesterday. The president’s
office also declined to comment.  Brazil will host the summer Olympics in 2016, two years
after the country is the site of soccer’s  World Cup .  To contact the reporter on this story:
