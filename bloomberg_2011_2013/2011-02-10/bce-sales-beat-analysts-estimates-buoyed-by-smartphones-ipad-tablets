  BCE Inc .,  Canada ’s largest phone
company, reported fourth-quarter sales that beat analysts’
estimates as the number of customers it signed up to data plans
for smartphones like Apple Inc.’s iPhone surged.  Sales climbed 0.7 percent to C$4.68 billion ($4.69
billion), the Montreal-based company said today in a statement.
Analysts predicted C$4.54 billion, the average of estimates
compiled by Bloomberg. Profit excluding restructuring and other
charges was 60 Canadian cents a share, compared with the
analysts’ consensus of 61 cents.  Chief Executive Officer George Cope is broadening BCE’s
range of top-line smartphones and adding tablets to its product
mix to respond to fresh competition from new carriers Wind
Mobile, Public Mobile and Mobilicity, which offer no-frills,
unlimited talk and text packages.  Bell, BCE’s main consumer brand, added 156,708 new mobile
phone subscribers on contract last quarter, a 43 percent jump
from a year earlier, and generated C$52.34 in average revenue
per customer. That was above an estimate of 94,000 new
subscribers and sales of C$52.23 per subscriber from Maher Yaghi, an analyst at Desjardins Securities Inc., who rates BCE a
“buy.”  “This is likely the best average revenue performance in
the wireless industry for the quarter,” Yaghi said in a
research note today.  In the first nine months of 2010, Bell gained 38 percent of
the share of new postpaid customers among the three main
Canadian carriers, Cope said on a conference call with analysts.  Bell is trying to wrest the title of Canada’s largest
wireless carrier from  Rogers Communications Inc . and lengthen
its lead over  Telus Corp ., the country’s third-largest. Rogers,
which reports fourth-quarter results on Feb. 16, had a 29
percent share of the incumbent’s news subscribers, with Telus,
claiming 33 percent, BCE showed in slides during the conference
call.  “It’s all about the growth in market share that took
place,” Cope said on the call.  Net income rose to C$439 million, or 58 cents a share, from
C$350 million, or 46 cents, a year earlier.  BCE fell 45 Canadian cents, or 1.2 percent, to C$36.14 at 4
p.m. on the Toronto Stock Exchange. The shares climbed 22
percent last year.  Bell revenue should grow 1 percent to 2 percent this year,
and earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization
should climb by 2 percent to 4 percent helped by cost cuts and
wireless growth, the company said. BCE expects adjusted earnings
per share of C$2.90 to C$3. Analysts had forecast C$2.92,
according to a Bloomberg survey.  BCE doesn’t plan share buybacks in 2011 though may consider
repurchasing stock in 2012, Chief Financial Officer Siim Vanaselja said on the call.  To contact the reporter on this story:
