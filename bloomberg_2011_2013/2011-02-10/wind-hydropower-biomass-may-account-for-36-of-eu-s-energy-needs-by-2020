Power from wind farms, hydro-power
and biomass plants may account for as much as 36 percent of
energy consumption in the European Union by 2020, according to a
report released by the regionâ€™s transmission system operators.  The use of non-fossil fuel generation across the EU could
trim carbon dioxide released in 2020 by as much as 57 percent or
as little as 26 percent compared with 2009, the European Network
of Transmission  System Operators  for Electricity said today.  If the EU achieves reductions at the top end of these
estimates, the bloc will succeed in cutting 2020 emissions by 20
percent from 1990 levels. The union, aiming to be a leader in
the worldwide fight against  climate change , aims to reduce the
release of carbon dioxide by as much as 95 percent in 2050.
Members also want to get 15 percent of their energy from
renewable sources by the end of the decade.  The net generating capacity from fossil fuels is expected
to decline to about 435,000 megawatts in 2020, the organization
said in the report. Electricity from renewable energy sources
will almost double from 288,000 megawatts today to 512,000
megawatts by the end of the decade, with wind projects making
the largest contribution. Power from nuclear reactors and pump
storage hydro plants will increase slightly over the period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
