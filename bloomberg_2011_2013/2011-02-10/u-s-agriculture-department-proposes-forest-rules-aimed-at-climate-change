The  U.S. Department of Agriculture 
today released a final  proposed rule  to protect national
forests from threats including  climate change , while promoting
job growth in rural areas.  The planning rule aims to increase protection for the 193
million acres (78 million hectares) of forests and grassland
supervised by the  U.S. Forest Service , the USDA said in a
statement. The government will also require that the best
available scientific data be used in making plans for land and
water resources. Local information would also have to be taken
into account.  The rule “will provide the tools to the Forest Service to
make our forests more resilient to many threats, including
pests, catastrophic fire and climate change,” Agriculture
Secretary  Tom Vilsack  told reporters on a conference call.  While the USDA looks to seek further protection for plants
and animals, Vilsack said the rule does not favor any one
special interest. He said the “full suite” of multiple uses
would be considered, including grazing, timber, energy and
mineral interests.  The plan is open for public comment until May 16. The
Forest Service is an agency of the USDA.  Bart Semcer, the senior representative of the  Sierra Club 
in Washington, said the rule appears to be a “step in the
right direction.”  “We’re pleased to see that are taking a look at climate
change,” Semcer said in a telephone interview. “We’re looking
forward to working with the agency to make the rule as strong
as possible.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
