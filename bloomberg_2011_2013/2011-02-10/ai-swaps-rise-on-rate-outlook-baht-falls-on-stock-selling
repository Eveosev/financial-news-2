  Thailand ’s interest-rate swaps rose
to the highest level since 2009 on speculation the central bank
will boost borrowing costs to curb accelerating inflation.  The Bank of Thailand raised the one-day bond-repurchase
rate by a quarter point to 2.25 percent on Jan. 12 and signaled
further increases, citing inflationary pressures. Consumer
prices rose 3.03 percent in January from a year earlier, the
most in five months, according to official data released on Feb.
1. The baht declined for a second day after global funds sold
$191 million more local equities than they bought this week
through yesterday.  “Thailand will continue to raise rates, and the swap
markets are pricing in potential gains in the short-term policy
rate,” said  Hideki Hayashi , a global economist at Mizuho
Securities Co. in Tokyo. “Close attention will be paid to the
inflation data.”  The one-year onshore swap, the fixed cost needed to receive
a floating payment, rose two basis points to 2.115 percent as of
3:34 p.m. in Bangkok. It reached 2.135 percent, the highest
level since June 2009.  Benchmark borrowing costs will climb to 2.75 percent by the
end of June, according to the median forecast of 15 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg. Policy makers meet next on March 9.  The yield on the 3.125 percent bond December 2015 was
unchanged at 3.55 percent after rising for four straight days
through yesterday. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  The baht slid 0.1 percent to 30.75 per dollar also on
concern  China ’s interest-rate increase this week will reduce
demand for Thai goods in the nation’s biggest export market.  Asia ’s largest economy bought 12 percent of Thai shipments in
December, official data show.  “There is some concern on the export outlook from China’s
tightening, weighing on the regional currencies,” Mizuho’s
Hayashi said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
