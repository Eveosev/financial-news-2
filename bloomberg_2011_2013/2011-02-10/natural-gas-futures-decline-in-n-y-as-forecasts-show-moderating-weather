Natural gas futures fell, settling
below $4 for the first time in 12 weeks, on forecasts of warmer-
than-normal weather next week that would reduce demand for the
heating fuel.  Gas dropped for the third day this week after the  National
Weather Service  said temperatures will be above normal in the
U.S. East, Midwest and South from Feb. 15 to Feb. 19. The
weather has been mostly colder than normal this month and in
January. Futures rose briefly after the Energy Department
reported stockpiles declined 209 billion cubic feet last week.  “The market is looking beyond last week’s stockpiles,”
said Carl Neill, an energy consultant at Risk Management Inc. in
Atlanta. “The weather has completely flip-flopped from cold to
mild, and that’s all you need to pressure the market right
now.”  Natural gas for March delivery fell 5.8 cents, or 1.4
percent, to $3.986 per million British thermal units on the  New
York Mercantile Exchange , settling below $4 for the first time
since Nov. 16. Gas has declined 25 percent from a year ago.  Analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg showed an expected
stockpile drop of 197 billion cubic feet. A survey of Bloomberg
users released five minutes before the stockpile report forecast
a decline of 198 billion.  Five-Year Average  The storage drop was bigger than the five-year average
decline of 159 billion cubic feet, department data showed. At
2.144 trillion cubic feet, the storage level was 2.1 percent
below the five-year average, declining to a deficit for the
first time since Jan. 15, 2010. A deficit to year-earlier
supplies widened to 4.4 percent from 2.9 percent.  “People are taking the storage number with a bit of a
grain of salt,” said  Cameron Horwitz , an analyst in Houston at
Canaccord Genuity. “It looks like  weather forecasts  are
trending towards a little bit warmer and the storage withdrawals
should be smaller heading into the beginning of the injection
season.”  The low temperature in  New York  on Feb. 18 may be 40
degrees Fahrenheit (4.4 Celsius), 11 degrees above normal,
according to AccuWeather Inc. in  State College ,  Pennsylvania .
The low in Cincinnati may be 37, 10 degrees above normal.  U.S. heating demand will be 14 percent below normal levels
from Feb. 11 to Feb. 17, according to Weather Derivatives in
Belton,  Missouri .  About 52 percent of U.S. households use natural gas for
heating, according to the Energy Department.  Production Forecast  The U.S. raised its forecast for natural gas production in
2011 by 1.5 percent as stronger demand from  power plants  and
industrial users boosts prices.  Marketed gas production will average 62.32 billion cubic
feet a day in 2011, up from 61.38 billion estimated in January,
the Energy Department said on Feb. 8 in its monthly  Short-Term
Energy Outlook .  Gas futures volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was
