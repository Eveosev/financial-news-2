Treasuries declined as first-time
claims for  unemployment insurance  fell to the lowest since July
2008 before the government sells $16 billion of 30-year bonds.  Ten-year note yields rose, reversing yesterday’s declines
after a $24 billion sale of the securities drew the most demand
on record from foreign central banks. Yields on 30-year bonds
were at almost the highest in 10 months before today’s auction,
which completes three sales this week totaling $72 billion. The
Federal Reserve will release an updated schedule for its debt-
buying plan today.  “The jobless claims data were strong and provide some
optimism that the labor market is still recovering, though the
market will still have to see more,” said Guy LeBas, chief
fixed-income strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott LLC in
Philadelphia. “The market’s focus is the auction, and we are
seeing a pretty good concession in yields that should help it go
well.”  Thirty-year bond yields rose four basis points to 4.75
percent at 11:38 a.m. in  New York , according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The 4.25 percent security maturing in November 2040
fell 17/32, or $5.31 per $1,000 face value, to 92 3/32.  High Levels  U.S. 10-year yields reached a nine-month high of 3.77
percent yesterday. Thirty-year bonds reached 4.79 percent, the
most since April 12.  Applications for jobless benefits decreased by 36,000, more
than forecast, to 383,000 in the week ended Feb. 4, Labor
Department figures showed today. Economists forecast claims
would fall to 410,000, according to the median estimate in a
Bloomberg News survey.  The  University of Michigan  consumer sentiment index rose to
75 this month from 74.2 in January, according to the median
forecast of economists in a Bloomberg survey before the report
tomorrow.  The 30-year bond to be sold today yielded 4.75 percent in
pre-auction trading. Last month’s sale of 30-year bonds drew a
yield of 4.515 percent, compared with 4.410 percent at the
December auction.  The Jan. 13 auction’s bid-to-cover ratio, which gauges
demand by comparing the amount bid with the amount offered, was
2.67, versus 2.74 at the December sale of the securities and an
average of 2.68 for the past 10 offerings.  Central Bank Demand  Indirect bidders, a class of investors that includes
foreign central banks, bought 37.8 percent of the bonds at the
January sale and 49.5 percent at the December sale, the most
since July 2009. That compares with a 38.29 percent average for
the past 10 auctions.  Direct bidders, non-primary-dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, purchased 12.4 percent of
the securities at the last sale, compared with 8.1 percent in
December and an average of 15.1 percent at the past 10 auctions.  Indirect bidders bought 71.3 percent of the 10-year notes
at yesterday’s sale, compared with 53.6 percent in January and
an average of 46.4 percent for the past 10 sales.  “The market is getting ready for the bond auction and
pricing in the concession,” said  Thomas Tucci , managing
director and head of rates trading at Royal Bank of Canada in
New York, one of 20 primary dealers that trade directly with the
Fed. “The duration and risk of the security will make people
defensive around the auction.”  Bernanke Talks  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  told the House Budget
Committee yesterday that while the declines in the jobless rate
in December and January “do provide some grounds for
optimism,” he cautioned that “it will be several years before
the  unemployment rate  has returned to a more normal level.”  The central bank has purchased $320.7 billion of Treasuries
as part of its $600 billion debt-purchase plan to bolster the
economy. The Fed will announce dates and sizes of further
purchases at 2 p.m. on its  website . The Fed has held its short-
term interest rate target at almost zero since December 2008.    Brian Sack , the Fed Bank of New York’s markets group chief,
said the central bank’s asset-purchase program has supported the
economic recovery by easing market conditions.  “The  Federal Reserve ’s balance sheet actions have helped
to make broader financial conditions more accommodative,” Sack
said in the text of remarks given in Philadelphia yesterday.  Treasuries have lost 1.2 percent this year, compared with
5.9 percent gain last year for the overall Treasury market,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
