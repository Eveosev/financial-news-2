MidAmerican Energy Holdings Co., the
power provider owned by  Warren Buffett ’s  Berkshire Hathaway
Inc. (BRK/A) , completed 300 megawatts of wind farms in California ahead
of the expiration of a tax credit at the end of this year.  MidAmerican Renewables LLC completed the 168-megawatt
Pinyon Pines Wind I and the 132-megawatt Pinyon Pines Wind II
projects near Tehachapi, the Des Moines-based company said today
in a statement. The 100  Vestas Wind Systems A/S (VWS)  3-megawatt
turbines will supply  Edison International (EIX) ’s Southern California
Edison with electricity under long-term contracts.  Developers are racing to finish projects before the
production tax credit, which provides incentives to wind farms
completed before Dec. 31, expires. The tax credit has helped
make wind the largest source of new capacity in the U.S. this
year.  “We are pleased to have met our timeline for building the
two projects and placing them in service before year-end 2012,”
Tom Budler, president of MidAmerican Wind, said in the
statement.  With the two projects, MidAmerican Renewables now has more
than 1.2 gigawatts of energy assets in operation or under
construction, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
