Wheat rose the most in four weeks as
export sales surged to the highest in almost two years in the
U.S., the world’s biggest shipper. Corn and soybeans climbed.  Exporters sold 1 million metric tons of wheat in the week
ended Dec. 20, the most since Jan. 13, 2011, and the fourth
straight weekly increase, government data showed today. Prices
have fallen 9.8 percent this month, boosting the appeal of U.S.
supplies for overseas buyers, said  Brian Hoops , the president of
Midwest Market Solutions.  “This is something we’ve not seen from the wheat market
for a while, in terms of export business,” Hoops said in a
telephone interview from Springfield,  Missouri . “It’s an
indication we’re at a level where we’re going to stimulate
demand.”  Wheat futures for March delivery climbed 0.8 percent to
settle at $7.7875 a bushel at 2 p.m. on the Chicago Board of
Trade, the biggest advance since Nov. 27. The price is up 19
percent this year, the largest gain among the 24 commodities
tracked by the Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot Index.  Corn futures for March delivery rose 0.4 percent to $6.94 a
bushel in  Chicago . The price has dropped 7.8 percent in
December, heading for the largest monthly decline since May.  Soybean futures for March delivery added 0.3 percent to
$14.18 a bushel on the CBOT.  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, followed by soybeans, hay
and wheat, U.S. government data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
