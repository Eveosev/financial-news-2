Ethanol’s discount to gasoline
narrowed as inventories slipped while gasoline supplies jumped
to a nine-month high.  Inventories of ethanol in the U.S. were 20.3 million
barrels a day in the week ended Dec. 21, down 523,000 barrels
from the week before, the Energy Department reported today.
Production advanced to 834,000 barrels a day, the first increase
in three weeks, according to department data. Gasoline
stockpiles climbed 3.78 million barrels to 223.1 million, the
most since March 23.  Ethanol’s discount to gasoline narrowed to 60.59 cents a
gallon based on January futures contracts. Yesterday’s
differential of 61.83 cents was the widest since September.  Denatured ethanol for January delivery declined 0.9 cent to
$2.194 a gallon on the  Chicago  Board of Trade, the lowest
settlement since June 26.  In cash market trading, ethanol was unchanged in  New York 
at $2.285 a gallon, on the  Gulf Coast  at $2.215, on the West
Coast at $2.35 and in Chicago at $2.185, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Gasoline for January delivery fell 2.14 cents, or 0.8
percent, to settle at $2.7999 a gallon on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . The contract covers reformulated gasoline,
made to be blended with ethanol before delivery to filling
stations. January contracts will expire at the close of floor
trading Dec. 31.  ‘Poor’ Margins  Corn for March delivery rose 0.4 percent to $6.94 a bushel
in Chicago. The price has dropped 7.8 percent in December,
heading for the largest monthly decline since May.  Based on March contracts for corn and ethanol, producers
are losing 30 cents on each gallon of the fuel made, up from 28
cents yesterday, excluding the revenue that can be pocketed from
the sale of dried distillers’ grains, a byproduct of ethanol
production that can be fed to livestock, according to data
collected by Bloomberg.  “It continues to be a poor margin situation for ethanol
plants,”  Jason Ward , a market analyst at Northstar Commodity
Investments LLC, a Minneapolis-based risk management company
that specializes in agribusiness and renewable fuel, said in a
e-mail today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
