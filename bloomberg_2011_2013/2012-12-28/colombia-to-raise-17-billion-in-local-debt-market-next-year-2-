(Corrects previous plans for foreign debt sale in fourth
paragraph in story published Dec. 28)  Colombia  plans to raise 3 trillion
pesos ($1.7 billion) through asset sales next year that may
include a 1.5 percent stake in the oil company  Ecopetrol SA (ECOPETL) ,
Finance Minister  Mauricio Cardenas  said.  The assets would include companies in the electricity and
mining industries, Cardenas told reporters in Bogota today. The
sales will help bring the consolidated budget, which includes
states, municipalities and state-run companies, into balance
next year after a shortfall equivalent to 0.4 percent of gross
domestic product this year, he said.  The government also plans to raise 30 trillion pesos in the
local  bond market  next year, of which 23 trillion pesos will be
raised through bond auctions, Cardenas said.  The government expects the central government deficit to
remain at 2.4 percent of GDP, unchanged on this year. The
government will sell $2.6 billion of bonds overseas, money that
won’t be brought into the country, Cardenas said. In June, the
government said it would need to raise 28 trillion pesos in the
local market in 2013 and sell $2 billion in overseas debt.  GDP will expand about 4.8 percent next year, up from 4
percent in 2012, Cardenas forecast.  The yield on Colombia’s benchmark 10 percent bonds due in
July 2024 has fallen 193 basis points this year, to 5.7 percent.
The peso has appreciated 10.1 percent to 1,760.75 per  U.S.
dollar , the biggest gain after the Polish zloty and Hungarian
forint among currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
