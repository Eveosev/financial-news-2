Bankia SA (BKIA) , the lender that received
the biggest Spanish bailout, fell as much as 34 percent after
saying it would be ejected from the nation’s main stock index.  Shares in the Valencia, Spain-based lender traded 25
percent lower at 0.41 euros at 12.22 p.m. in  Madrid , giving it a
market value of 820 million euros ($1 billion). Bankia said in a
 filing  last night that it would leave the IBEX 25 on Jan. 2
after the index committee took “special measures” due to its
recapitalization.  Bankia, formed in 2010 from the merger of seven Spanish
savings banks and listed on the stock exchange in July last year
at a price of 3.75 euros, has plunged in value after losses
linked to real estate led it to take 18 billion euros of
European funds to clean up its balance sheet.  In a first stage of its recapitalization, Bankia will issue
10.7 billion euros in contingent convertible bonds to be bought
by its parent company that will convert into ordinary shares
next year as part of a capital reduction.  Spain ’s bank rescue
fund, known as FROB, said the aim of the process is to make
 shareholders  the first to bear losses linked to Bankia group’s
restructuring.  To contact the reporter on this story:
