David McIlwain has left  Royal Bank
of Scotland Group Plc (RBS) , where he was director of retail
structured products, according to online records of the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.  McIlwain worked at the Edinburgh-based bank since August
2010 after departing Morgan Stanley in July 2009, according to
Finra. McIlwain declined to comment when reached on his mobile
phone.  RBS will eliminate 3,800 jobs at the investment-banking
division by the fourth quarter of next year, compared with an
earlier target of 3,500, according to slides based on a
 presentation  delivered by John Hourican, chief of markets and
international banking, to analysts on Sept. 24. About 3,000 of
the  cuts  will be completed this year, RBS said.  Ed Canaday , a spokesman for the bank, declined to comment.  RBS is the 17th-biggest underwriter of structured notes in
the U.S., distributing $3.7 million of the securities in five
trades, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
