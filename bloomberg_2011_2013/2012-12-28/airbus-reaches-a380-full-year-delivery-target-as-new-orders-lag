Airbus SAS said it has delivered its
30th A380 plane, achieving its 2012 target as production
outpaces new orders for the second year in a row.  The final A380 for the year was delivered yesterday,
Toulouse, France-based Airbus said in an e-mail. With four new
A380s ordered through November against a target of 30, Airbus’s
backlog for its flagship aircraft has shrunk to 160 units.  Airbus has struggled to secure new commitments for the A380
as demand has sagged in difficult economic conditions for
airlines and amid concern a component in the aircraft’s wing is
prone to cracking. Regulators are expected to approve a fix to
the wing flaw early next year.  Production of A380s, which increased from 18 in 2010 and 26
last year, is expected to dip in 2013 as Airbus repairs existing
aircraft and delivers new planes with wings that will not need
mending. Production should rebound in 2014 as Airbus works to a
goal of delivering profitable A380s from 2015.  British Airways (IAG)  is scheduled to be the only new A380
operator next year. The International Consolidated Airlines
Group SA unit is buying 12 A380s which will have 469 seats four
classes, London-based BA said in a statement on Dec. 11.  Airbus is on track to end the year with more orders and
aircraft built than it projected at the start of the year even
as the plane manufacturer relinquishes the title as the largest
maker of commercial airliners to  Boeing Co. (BA)   To contact the reporter on this story:
