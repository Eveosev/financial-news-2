Gasoline fluctuated after a report
that U.S. inventories of the motor fuel increased last week and
as President Obama prepared to meet with Congressional leaders
about the looming fiscal deadline.  Futures swung between gains and losses after the industry-
funded  American Petroleum Institute  reported yesterday that
 gasoline stockpiles  rose 2.41 million barrels in the seven days
ended Dec. 21. Today’s White House meeting comes four days
before more than $600 billion in spending cuts and tax increases
are set to take effect.  “Gasoline is under pressure as supplies have built and the
market is just waiting to see if any headline comes out today
from President Obama’s meeting and if Congress will take any
action on Sunday evening,” said  Andy Lipow , president of Lipow
Oil Associates LLC in Houston.  Gasoline for January delivery gained 0.08 cent to $2.8221 a
gallon at 9:33 a.m. on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , after
swinging between $2.8058 and $2.8383. Prices are up 3.2 percent
this week, extending this year’s advance to 5.1 percent. Volume
was 30 percent below the average of the past 100 days.  The Republican-led House called a Sunday session for the
evening of Dec. 30. If the deadline passes without a budget
deal, the risk is that the U.S. would fall into another
recession, which could reduce demand for  consumer goods  and oil
products.  Energy Department  The Energy Department is scheduled to report last week’s
inventories at 11 a.m. today, two days later than usual because
of the Christmas holiday. The department will probably report
that gasoline stockpiles rose 850,000 barrels, according to the
median estimate of 10 analysts in a Bloomberg survey.  The survey projected the department will report that  
heating oil and diesel   supplies  declined 850,000 barrels. API
reported that distillate inventories rose 2.95 million barrels.  Heating oil for January delivery climbed 0.22 cent to
$3.0745 a gallon. Prices are up 1.7 percent this week and have
gained 4.8 percent this year. Volume was 62 percent below
average.  The average nationwide cost for regular gasoline rose 1.8
cents to $3.279 a gallon, AAA said today on its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
