MagicJack VocalTec Ltd. (CALL)  rallied the
most in 10 weeks in  New York  after Chief Executive Office Daniel Borislow resigned, saying he hopes his departure will curb
short-selling that contributed to a three-month slump in the
Israeli technology company.  Shares of the Netanya, Israel-based company that offers
voice-over-Internet services jumped 10 percent to $17.95 at the
close of trading on volume that was four times the three-month
daily average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Shares
have plunged 33 percent since Sept. 12.  Borislow will concentrate on marketing and product
development, relinquishing the post of CEO on Jan. 1 to Gerald Vento, the company said in a statement today. Vento was chief
executive of TeleCorp PCS Inc., which was sold to  AT&T Inc. (T)  in
2002, MagicJack said.  “Short sellers aren’t going to have the excuse of Dan
Borislow anymore,” the CEO and founder of MagicJack, said in a
call with investors today. “We’re turning the company over to a
seasoned veteran who knows how to build a company.”  Short sellers have increased bearish bets on MagicJack to a
record. Wagers against the stock have  jumped  tenfold to 12
percent of shares outstanding this year, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg and Markit, a London-based research firm.  To contact the reporter on this story:
