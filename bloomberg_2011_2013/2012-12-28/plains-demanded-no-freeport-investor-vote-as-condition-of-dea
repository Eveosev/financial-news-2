Plains Exploration & Production Co. (PXP) ,
which earlier this month agreed to be bought by  Freeport-McMoRan
Copper & Gold Inc. (FCX) , told Freeport it wasn’t interested in a deal
if it required a vote by the acquirer’s shareholders, according
to a filing.  Plains terminated talks with Freeport on the deal in
September and restarted them a month later, Houston-based Plains
said today in a filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
