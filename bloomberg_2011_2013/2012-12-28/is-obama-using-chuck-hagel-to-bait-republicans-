Republican Senator Chuck Hagel may not be the best  candidate  to lead the Pentagon. He's an idiosyncratic figure, which is the source of both his appeal and various concerns about him. Here is National Review editor Rich Lowry,  writing in Politico , trying to understand Obama's motive in floating Hagel's name for secretary of defense: Or maybe second-term Obama is settling into the stiletto ways of  Washington  and is eager to give Republicans another opportunity to portray themselves as an angry, dysfunctional mess unwilling to participate in an orderly democratic process. Presidents generally pay a price for nasty nomination fights. But a Hagel nomination -- or extended trial balloon -- might offer political rewards as well as costs. The  attacks  on Hagel from the right have been mostly ideological,  questioning  his loyalty to  Israel , his  ambiguous  stance toward  Iran , including a seeming reluctance to use harsh sanctions, and his  willingness  to be an aggressive champion of defense spending. As a senator, his refusal to view the Iraq war as a vital and clear-cut march of freedom annoyed Republican colleagues. “Hagel’s heresy on the  Iraq war  overshadowed the rest of his record,” Connie Bruck  wrote  in the  New Yorker , Yet many Americans will have a difficult time understanding how a conservative Republican from  Nebraska  nominated by a liberal Democrat from  Illinois  could possibly be so far outside the political mainstream. They may conclude that it's his accusers, including Republican Senators Lindsey Graham and  John McCain , who are too close to the edge (and so soon after playing too near a cliff!). Meanwhile, the spectacle of Republicans attacking one of their own for ideological impurity will do little to refurbish the party brand in those states where the purple people reside. Maybe Obama genuinely thinks Hagel would be a stellar defense secretary. Or maybe he'll leave Hagel  flapping in the breeze , as he did  Susan Rice  before she withdrew from consideration for secretary of state. But if the president wants an encore to the fiscal cliff drama to reinforce his portrayal of Republicans as too venal, too partisan and too intransigent to govern, an ugly fight over Hagel might do the trick.
