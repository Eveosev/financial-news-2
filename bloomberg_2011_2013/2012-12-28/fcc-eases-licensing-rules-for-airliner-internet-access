The U.S. Federal Communications
Commission today moved to ease licensing requirements for in-
flight Internet services.  “These new rules will help airlines and broadband
providers offer high-speed Internet to passengers,” FCC
Chairman  Julius Genachowski , who has pushed the  Federal Aviation
Administration  to relax its restrictions on in-flight use of
electronic devices including Apple Inc.’s iPad, said in an e-
mailed statement.  The FCC, which shares regulation of in-flight
communications with the FAA, has since 2001 authorized companies
to offer  Internet service  on a case-by-case basis, the agency
said in a news release.  The new rules set up a way to establish that systems meet
standards for not interfering with aircraft controls, a step
toward getting FAA approval, the FCC said.  The agency in an  order  set rules for satellites to
communicate with mobile devices used by aircraft passengers and
crews. In such systems, an antenna on the airplane communicates
with satellites, and mobile technologies such as Wi-Fi spread
signals within the aircraft’s hull, the FCC said.  The new rules will allow “faster, more efficient”
licensing of the technologies, the agency said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
