Outokumpu Oyj (OUT1V)  signed a 250 million-
euro ($330 million) forward start facility with Nordea Bank AB,
extending the maturity of a loan to January 2014 from June 2013.  The Finnish steelmaker, which completed its acquisition of
 ThyssenKrupp AG (TKA) ’s Inoxum unit today, agreed to the debt deal
earlier this month, it said in a stock exchange statement. The
forward start facility, a type of loan that locks in financing
terms before existing debt matures, will replace a 400 million-
euro loan signed in April 2012 when it comes due next year,
Outokumpu said.  Outokumpu agreed to buy Inoxum on Jan. 31 in a deal valuing
the German unit at about 2.8 billion euros. ThyssenKrupp
received a 29.9 percent stake in Outokumpu and a 1.25 billion-
euro loan note. The Espoo, Finland-based Outokumpu assumed 133
million euros of Inoxum’s debt and 338 million euros of pension
liabilities.  Selling Inoxum is part of ThyssenKrupp’s strategy to reduce
its reliance on steel and expand other operations as waning auto
and construction industry demand for the material reduces its
 profit margins .  To contact the reporter on this story:
