Facebook Inc. (FB)  has patched a security
vulnerability that would have allowed hackers to turn on users’
webcams without their knowledge and post videos to their
profiles.  The bug was discovered in July by two computer-security
researchers in  India , according to Fred Wolens, spokesman for
Facebook. Aditya Gupta and Subho Halder, founders of a
consulting firm called  XY Security , reported their findings to
Facebook, which paid them $2,500 for the information,
Bloomberg.com reported on its Tech Blog. Facebook seems to have
deemed this particular bug as “serious” because the company
paid five times its usual price, the two researchers said.  Facebook is one of a few technology companies -- along with
 Google Inc. (GOOG)  and  Mozilla Corp. , maker of the Firefox browser --
encouraging outsiders to hack into their products in return for
payouts. Some companies, notably  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) , have  shunned 
“bug bounties” because they might wind up rewarding criminals.  An investigation by Facebook when it fixed the webcam hole
found that no users appeared to be affected, Wolens said.  “This vulnerability, like many others we provide a bounty
for, was only theoretical, and we have seen no evidence that it
has been exploited in the wild,” Wolens wrote in an e-mail.
“Essentially, several things would need to go wrong -- a user
would need to be tricked into visiting a malicious page and
clicking to activate their camera, and then after some time
period, tricked into clicking again to stop/publish the video.”  Bounty Reward  Many companies choose to pay researchers such as XY
Security for bugs because the alternative can be much worse.
Such information can fetch high prices on the black market from
criminals who try to find ways to shake down Internet surfers,
costing site administrators more in the end.  Facebook’s “peeping Tom” bug could have been exploited on
either Windows or Mac computers, the researchers said. The
Facebook vulnerability found by XY Security was related to how
the site verified requests to record and post webcam video, they
said. People who had previously granted Facebook’s site access
to their webcams would have been vulnerable, he said.  Facebook, Google and Mozilla have paid researchers more
than $2 million combined through their bounty programs,
according to the companies. Google has paid as much as $60,000
(plus a free laptop) for  information  about weaknesses in its
Chrome Web browser, and Facebook has  expanded  its program to
cover not only the Facebook site but also the company’s
corporate network.  Before reporting the webcam bug to Facebook, Gupta and
Halder had been building a reputation in the tech industry as
professional bug-bounty hunters. The researchers, who are in
their early-20s, had previously reported software
vulnerabilities to Apple, Google, Microsoft and  EBay Inc. (EBAY) ’s
PayPal, they said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
