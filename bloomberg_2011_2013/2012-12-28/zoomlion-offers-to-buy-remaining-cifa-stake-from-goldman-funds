Zoomlion Heavy Industry Science and
Technology Co. ,  China ’s second-biggest construction equipment
maker by market value, offered $236 million to buy the remaining
41 percent stake in a unit from  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  and
other investors.  Zoomlion (1157)  will fund the purchase with its own cash, the
company said in a statement to the Shenzhen stock exchange
today. The unit, Zoomlion CIFA (H.K) Holdings Co., was formed
after the Chinese equipment maker and investors including
Goldman acquired Compagnia Italiana Forme Acciaio SpA, known as
CIFA, in 2008.  “This will accelerate Zoomlion’s push for international
expansion,” the company said in a separate e-mailed statement.
“Zoomlion will better integrate CIFA’s business.”  Zoomlion bought its 60 percent stake in the Italian company
for 163 million euros ($215 million) as it sought advanced
technologies in concrete pump manufacturing. Zoomlion and bigger
rival  Sany Heavy Industry Co. (600031)  are stepping up overseas
 acquisitions  after demand at home slowed following Chinese
government curbs on the property market.  Goldman owns 12.8 percent of Zoomlion CIFA, while Chinese
private-equity company Hony Capital has 17.8 percent. Chinese-
Italian buyout fund Mandarin Capital Partners holds 8.9 percent.
The three investors had paid 108 million euros for the stake. In
2009, CIFA management bought a 1.1 percent holding.  Zoomlion fell 1.4 percent to close at HK$11.52 in Hong Kong
trading. The city’s benchmark Hang Seng Index rose 0.2 percent.
The announcement was made after trading hours.  Concrete machinery was the biggest  revenue  contributor to
Zoomlion last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
company’s first-half profit rose 21 percent to 5.6 billion  yuan 
as the focus on concrete pumps helped offset slumping demand for
excavators.  Sany Heavy (631) , China’s biggest maker of excavators, and a
partner paid 360 million euros for German concrete-pump maker
Putzmeister Holding GmbH in April.  To contact the reporter on this story:
