Hungary’s Constitutional Court
struck down legislation that would have led to mandatory voter
registration, a requirement that the political opposition said
infringed on basic rights.  The rule, attached to a new constitution introduced by
Prime Minister  Viktor Orban ’s government this year, was
discarded on “formal, procedural” grounds, according to a
 statement  on the Budapest-based court’s website today. The court
will review the content of the registration requirement in a
separate inquiry, it said.  “Parliament, acting in its capacity to create a
constitution, is also bound by procedural and legislative
rules,” the court said. “Laws that break these guidelines are
void.”  Opposition parties and civic groups had said mandatory
registration would infringe on citizens’ fundamental rights and
lead to a lower turnout favoring the ruling Fidesz party. Orban
said the law would help avoid excluding hundreds of thousands of
voters who live and work abroad.  To contact the reporter on this story:
