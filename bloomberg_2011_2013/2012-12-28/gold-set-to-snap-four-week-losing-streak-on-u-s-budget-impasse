Gold futures fell, capping the
longest run of weekly declines in two years, as a rally by the
dollar curbed demand for the metal as an alternative investment.  The greenback rose to a two-week high against a basket of
currencies ahead of President  Barack Obama ’s meeting with
Democratic and Republican congressional leaders as a U.S. budget
deadline approaches. Obama is set to propose a scaled-back
package to avert tax and spending changes that may trigger a
recession in 2013, a Democratic aide with knowledge of the talks
said.  “It’s the dollar that is keeping gold quiet today,” Phil Streible, a senior commodity broker at R.J. O’Brien &
Associates, said in a telephone interview. “We are seeing some
flight to cash.”  Gold futures for February delivery fell 0.5 percent to
settle at $1,655.90 an ounce at 1:41 p.m. on the Comex in New
York. This week, the metal dropped 0.3 percent, the fifth
straight decline and the longest slump since January 2010.  This year, gold has climbed 5.7 percent, heading for the
12th straight annual gain, after central banks from the U.S. to
 China  increased fiscal stimulus to bolster their economies.  Silver futures for March delivery slipped 0.9 percent to
$29.975 an ounce. This week, the price dropped 0.8 percent, the
fifth straight decline. The metal has climbed 7.4 percent this
