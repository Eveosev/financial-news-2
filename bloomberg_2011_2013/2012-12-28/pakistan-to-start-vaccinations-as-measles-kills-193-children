Pakistan  will start a vaccination
drive next week to stem an outbreak of measles that has killed
193 children this year in the southern province of Sindh.  Eighty seven deaths were reported this month alone, Masood
Solangi, the Sindh government’s director of public health, said
today in a telephone interview. The vaccines will be sent to the
cities of Ghotki, Sukkur, Khairpur, Kashmore, Shikarpur, Larkana
and Qambar, he said.  Catch-up Campaign will begin on Dec. 31 and last for 10
days, seeking to immunize 3 million children in the age of nine
months to 10 years, health department spokesman Saleem Khan said
yesterday. A total of 2,225 cases of measles were reported in
Pakistan this year, Solangi said.  “This is the worst situation of measles in the history of
the country,” Solangi said. “The authorities will initially
administer a dose of vitamin A to children to stop the disease
from spreading.”  Lack of commitment by local doctors and administrators,
combined with defective storing of vaccines lead to the deaths,
Solangi said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
