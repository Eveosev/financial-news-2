Tin  stockpiles  in warehouses
monitored by the London Metal Exchange rose 1.5 percent to
12,750 metric tons, the highest since June 6.  Most of the gain was from deliveries to Port Klang and
Johor,  Malaysia , according to data from the LME today. Tin
stockpiles have climbed 4.6 percent this year. Lead stockpiles
dropped 1.3 percent to 323,400 tons, the lowest since Nov. 8, on
declines in Port Klang and Johor, according to the exchange.  Aluminum canceled warrants jumped 3.4 percent to a record
2.24 million tons, the data show. Nickel canceled warrants
dropped 14 percent to 11,658 tons, the biggest drop since June 7
to the lowest since Oct. 26. Canceled warrants are orders to
take metal out of warehouses.  Tin for delivery in three months fell 0.4 percent to
$23,300 a ton by 12:26 p.m. in London, trimming this yearâ€™s
advance to 21 percent, the most of the six main metals on the
LME. Nickel is down the most of the metals this year after
falling 8.3 percent and aluminum is up 2.7 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
