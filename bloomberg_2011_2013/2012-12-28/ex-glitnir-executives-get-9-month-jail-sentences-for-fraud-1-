Larus Welding, the former chief
executive officer of failed Icelandic lender Glitnir Bank hf,
and Gudmundur Hjaltason, an ex-director at the bank, were
sentenced to nine months in jail for fraud, a court ruled.  The executives were sentenced today by the  Reykjavik
District Court . They were indicted 12 months ago for having
“misused their position and grossly endangered the bank’s
funds” by lending 102 million euros ($134 million) to Milestone
ehf without guarantees or collateral, the prosecutor said then.  The executives are the first bankers from Iceland’s three-
largest lenders to be sentenced to jail for activities related
to the island’s financial and economic collapse in 2008. Glitnir
was the first of Iceland’s biggest banks to fail, triggering the
biggest recession in six decades and sending the krona down as
much as 80 percent against the euro on the offshore market.  Welding was this month also indicted on separate charges for
his role in approving a 6 billion-krona ($47 million) loan to
holding company FS38 ehf.  Welding and Hjaltason couldn’t be immediately reached
through their lawyers, Ottar Palsson and Thordur Bogason,
respectively.  To contact the reporter on this story:
