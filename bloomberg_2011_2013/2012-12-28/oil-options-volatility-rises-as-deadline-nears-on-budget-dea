Crude options volatility rose as the
deadline neared for reaching a  federal budget  deal before
automatic spending cuts and tax increases take effect.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
February, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a
gauge of options prices, was 25.56 percent on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange  as of 2:55 p.m., an increase from 24.95
percent yesterday.  February-delivery crude oil declined 7 cents to settle at
$90.80 a barrel on the Nymex. Prices have fallen 8.1 percent
this year.  President  Barack Obama  was set to propose a scaled-back
fiscal package at a meeting today with congressional leaders to
avert tax and spending changes that could trigger a recession in
2013, a Democratic aide with knowledge of the talks said.  The most active options in electronic trading today were
February $85 puts, which fell 1 cent to 52 cents a barrel on
volume of 2,453 contracts at 3 p.m. in  New York . February $95
calls were the second-most active, with 1,252 lots exchanged as
they held steady at 65 cents a barrel.  Bets that prices would fall, or puts, accounted for 64
percent of electronic trading volume.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on open-
outcry volume, where the bulk of options activity occurs.  In the previous session, bearish bets accounted for 62
percent of the 80,786 contracts traded.  February $80 puts were the most active options yesterday
with 7,325 contracts changing hands. They fell 2 cents to 17
cents a barrel. February $72 puts were unchanged at 3 cents a
barrel on 5,529 lots.  Open interest was highest for February $105 calls with
36,976 contracts. Next were March $70 puts at 29,037 lots and
