South Korea’s won headed for a sixth
weekly gain as signs of a pickup in the economy attracted funds
from abroad and exporters repatriated income.  Government bonds 
advanced.  The current-account surplus  widened  to a record $6.88
billion in November, central bank data showed today. Industrial
 output  expanded 2.3 percent from the previous month, the biggest
gain since January and exceeding the 0.8 percent median forecast
in a Bloomberg News survey. Overseas funds bought $295 million
more Korean shares than they sold this week through yesterday,
exchange data show. The  Bank of Korea  said yesterday it will use
policy to maintain the economy’s growth potential.  The won appreciated 0.3 percent to 1,071.30 per dollar as
of 9:39 a.m. in  Seoul , according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
It rose 0.1 percent today and touched 1,070.75, the strongest
level since Dec. 18. This year’s 7.6 percent advance is the
biggest among  Asia ’s 11 most-traded currencies. Local financial
markets will closed Dec. 31 and Jan. 1, before opening an hour
later than usual on Jan. 2.  “The won started trading stronger on the current-account
surplus and exporters will be selling dollars as the year-end
approaches,” said Byeon Ji Young, a Seoul-based currency
analyst for Woori Futures Co. “Still, there are concerns the
government may intervene to prevent the won from appreciating on
the year’s last trading day.”  One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves
in exchange rates used to price options, increased eight basis
points this week to 4.98 percent. It was 13.55 percent at the
end of 2011.  Growth Outlook  The yield on  South Korea ’s 2.75 percent bonds due September
2017 fell one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 3
percent this week, Korea Exchange prices show. The rate fell
three basis points today. The one-year interest-rate swap
increased one basis point from Dec. 21 to 2.81 percent .  “Positive industrial output data is countered by the
 finance ministry  cutting growth forecasts yesterday and the
central bank pledging to focus on economic growth,” said Ahn
Soo Jin, a fixed-income trader in Seoul at Busan Bank.  The finance ministry cut its 2013 growth forecast to 3
percent, from a September projection of 4 percent, and lowered
its estimate for expansion this year to 2.1 percent from 3.3
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
