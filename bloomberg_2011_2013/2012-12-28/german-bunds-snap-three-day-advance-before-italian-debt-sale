German 10-year bonds snapped a
three-day advance as Italy prepared to sell as much as 6 billion
euros ($7.95 billion) of government debt.  Benchmark 10-year yields dropped to a  two-week low 
yesterday amid concern U.S. lawmakers wonâ€™t reach an agreement
on budget negotiations in time to stop more than $600 billion in
tax increases and spending cuts for 2013 starting to take effect
in January. Italy plans to auction five- and 10-year securities.  German 10-year yields rose one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 1.32 percent at 7:14 a.m. London time. The
rate fell to 1.31 percent yesterday, the lowest since Dec. 13.
The 1.5 percent bond maturing in September 2022 dropped 0.065,
or 65 euro cents per 1,000-euro face amount, to 101.60.  The Italian Treasury last sold 10-year bonds on Nov. 29 at
an average yield of 4.45 percent. It auctioned five-year notes
at 3.23 percent the same day.  German bonds returned 4.4 percent this year through
yesterday, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. Italian
bonds earned 21 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
