Palm oil  rose for a second week,
reaching the highest level since the beginning of November, on
optimism record inventories in Malaysia will decline as the low-
production season reduces supplies and export taxes are cut.  The contract for March delivery climbed 0.6 percent to
2,497 ringgit ($816) a metric ton on the Malaysia Derivatives
Exchange, the highest settlement level for the most-active price
since Nov. 1. Futures added 3.7 percent this week, following a
5.9 percent gain the previous week, the best performance in a
year.  Indonesia cut its tax on shipments in January to 7.5
percent from 9 percent this month, Bachrul Chairi, acting
director general for foreign trade, said yesterday.  Malaysia  has
set its export-tax rate at zero for January. Output in Malaysia,
where  reserves  reached an all-time high of 2.56 million tons
last month, typically declines over the first quarter.  The gain is driven by expectations “palm stocks will slowly
ease due to the low-production cycle during the first quarter
next year, and higher exports, especially to China, after a new
tax implementation,” said Chandran Sinnasamy, head of trading
at LT International Futures Sdn in  Kuala Lumpur .  Palm oil has advanced 13 percent since dropping to a three-
year low of 2,217 ringgit on Dec. 13. The edible oil may be the
best-performing agricultural commodity in 2013 as demand
rebounds, according to Rabobank International.  Soybeans for March delivery climbed 0.5 percent to $14.205
a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade.  Soybean oil  for delivery
in March added 0.9 percent to 49.16 cents a pound.  Palm oil for May delivery dropped 0.7 percent to close at
6,964  yuan  ($1,117) a ton on the  Dalian Commodity Exchange .
Soybean oil for May was little changed at 8,642 yuan a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
