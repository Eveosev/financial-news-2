U.S. stocks fell for the week,
giving the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index its biggest drop in about
two months, as investors watched budget talks in  Washington .  A measure of  energy  shares dropped the most among the 10
main industry groups in the  S&P 500 (SPX) , retreating 3 percent.  Coach
Inc. (COH)  and Amazon.com Inc. decreased more than 4.5 percent as
retailers slumped after the Christmas holiday.  Apple Inc. (AAPL) , the
world’s most valuable company, slipped 1.9 percent.  The S&P 500 slid 1.9 percent for the week to 1,402.43. The
Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 252.73 points, or 1.9 percent,
to 12,938.11. Both gauges ended the week at the lowest levels
since Nov. 27.  “The discussions about a budget agreement have taken over
everything,” said  Richard Sichel , who oversees about $1.8
billion as chief investment officer at Philadelphia Trust Co. He
spoke in a Dec. 28 phone interview. “We need to get that off
the front page. It just brings negativity to the market.”  The S&P 500 has fallen 4.3 percent after reaching the
highest level since 2007 in September as President  Barack Obama ’s re-election set up a budget showdown with the
Republican-controlled House of Representatives. The benchmark
gauge has risen 3.6 percent since its November low on bets a
compromise will be reached to avoid more than $600 billion in
automatic tax increases and spending cuts that are set to start
taking effect in January. The so-called fiscal cliff could lead
to an economic slowdown in early 2013, according to the
Congressional Budget Office.  Unusual Session  The S&P 500 tumbled 1.1 percent on the final day of the
week, its biggest drop since Nov. 14, amid concern Obama and
Republicans were no closer to a compromise. Democratic and
Republican U.S. Senate leaders said after markets closed for the
week that they will try to come up with a budget plan by Dec. 30
that the chamber can pass.  Obama met on Dec. 28 with House Speaker John Boehner and
Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, both Republicans, and
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and House Minority Leader
Nancy Pelosi, both Democrats. The Republican-led House called an
unusual Sunday session for the evening of Dec. 30, though the
leaders didn’t say what action they planned to take.  Stocks are up for the year amid global stimulus measures
and better-than-estimated  corporate earnings . The S&P 500 has
risen 12 percent so far in 2012, driven by gains in financial
shares and companies which rely on consumer discretionary
spending. The S&P 500 is 4.3 percent above the average year-end
estimate of Wall Street strategists in January of 1,344. On
average, they predict the index to rise to 1,531 next year.  ‘Rising Confidence’  The S&P 500 is trading at 14.3 times reported earnings, or
below its average since the 1950s of 16.46, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. It needs to rise 12 percent to reach its
October 2007 record of 1,565.15.  “I expect 2013 to deliver a gain for the S&P 500, breaking
the all-time high,” said James Paulsen, the chief investment
strategist at Minneapolis-based Wells Capital Management, which
oversees about $325 billion. “Rising confidence in a sustained
recovery will be the primary catalyst driving valuations
higher.”  All  10 groups  in the S&P 500 retreated this week as energy
and utility companies had the biggest losses. The Morgan Stanley
Cyclical Index of companies most-tied to the economy dropped 1.4
percent.  Holiday Sales  A measure of S&P 500 companies which rely on consumer
discretionary spending dropped 1.6 percent. Coach, the largest
U.S. luxury handbag maker, slid 5.7 percent to $54.30.
 Amazon.com (AMZN) , the world’s largest online retailer, slid 4.6
percent to $245.18.  U.S. holiday sales growth slowed by more than half this
year after gridlock in Washington soured consumers’ moods and
 Hurricane Sandy  disrupted shopping, MasterCard Advisors
SpendingPulse said.  Retail sales grew by 0.7 percent from Oct. 28 through Dec.
24, the research firm said, without providing a dollar figure.
Sales grew at a 2 percent pace in the same period a year ago.
SpendingPulse tracks total U.S. sales at stores and online via
all payment forms.  Apple Slumps  Apple paced losses in technology shares, slipping 1.9
percent to $509.59. The company’s stock has dropped 27 percent
from a Sept. 19 record high, building up pressure on Chief
Executive Officer  Tim Cook  to introduce a new hit product and
fend off Google Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co.  Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ)  erased 4.6 percent to $13.68, leading
losses in the Dow. The U.S. Justice Department opened an
investigation relating to Autonomy Corp. after the personal-
computer maker accused the software company of misrepresenting
its performance before Hewlett-Packard bought it last year.
Justice Department representatives informed the company on Nov.
21 of the probe, Hewlett-Packard said in a regulatory filing.  Marvell Technology Group Ltd. (MRVL)  sank 14 percent to $7.17
after the stock was downgraded at JMP Securities LLC, which
cited numerous headwinds. The maker of chips for computers and
mobile phones tumbled 10 percent on Dec. 26 as a U.S. jury
ordered it to pay $1.17 billion, a penalty that may be tripled,
for infringing patents on integrated-circuit technology held by
Carnegie Mellon University.  Financial Shares  Financial shares in the S&P 500 fell 1.4 percent as a
group. JPMorgan Chase & Co. dropped 1.7 percent to $43.24.
 Citigroup Inc. (C)  erased 1.2 percent to $39.01.  Research In Motion Ltd. (RIM)  gained 8.1 percent to $11.79. The
maker of the BlackBerry smartphone rebounded after erasing about
a quarter of its market value following its earnings report.
While the company raised concerns about declining service fees,
investors may have overestimated the impact of the change on
earnings per share, Kevin Smithen, an analyst at Macquarie
Securities USA Inc. in New York, said.  The shares tumbled 23 percent on Dec. 21 after Chief
Executive Officer Thorsten Heins said users who do not want
enhanced services, including advanced security, are expected to
generate “less or no service revenue.”  Smith & Wesson Holding Corp. (SWHC)  advanced 1.1 percent to $8.18
as the gunmaker expanded its stock repurchase program by $15
million. The shares have lost 14 percent since the day before a
gunman killed 20 students in a Connecticut elementary school on
Dec. 14. The stock trade at more than $11 at the end of
September.  To contact the reporter on this story:
