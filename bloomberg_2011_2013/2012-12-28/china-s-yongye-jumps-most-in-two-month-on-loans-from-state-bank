Yongye International Inc. (YONG) , a Chinese
maker of fertilizers, surged the most in more than two months in
New York after the company said the country’s state-owned bank
offered to fund its going-private deal.  Shares soared 15 percent to $5.70 at 1:05 p.m. in New York,
the biggest rally since Oct. 15, the day Chairman Wu Zishen and
Morgan Stanley’s private equity unit proposed the takeover.  Yongye, based in Beijing, signed a $99 million one-year
loan agreement with  China Development Bank  Corp., according to
its  filing  with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
China Development Bank agreed to provide debt financing of as
much as $232 million to finance the deal, Yongye said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
