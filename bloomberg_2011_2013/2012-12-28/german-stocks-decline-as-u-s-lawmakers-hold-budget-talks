German stocks declined as U.S.
President  Barack Obama  meets with congressional leaders for
budget talks and as House of Representatives plan a session on
Dec. 30, seeking to reach a deal that averts a fiscal crisis.  ProSiebenSat.1 Media AG (PSM)  fell 1.1 percent after it was fined
by German regulators. Porsche SE advanced 6.3 percent after a
U.S. appeals court dismissed a law suit against the company.  The DAX Index lost 0.3 percent to 7,636.18 at 11:08 a.m. in
Frankfurt. The benchmark gauge has still rallied 29 percent so
far this year as the European Central Bank and the Federal
Reserve expanded asset purchases. The broader HDAX Index also
fell 0.3 percent.  Obama summoned congressional leaders to a White House
meeting three days before a year-end deadline to avoid $600
billion in spending cuts and tax increases, amid increasing
concern that the time is too short to reach a deal.  Obama, who had been negotiating one-on-one with House
Speaker  John Boehner , will meet today with Republicans Boehner
and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, and Senate Majority
Leader  Harry Reid  and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, both
Democrats. The meeting will be held at 3 p.m. Washington time.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
