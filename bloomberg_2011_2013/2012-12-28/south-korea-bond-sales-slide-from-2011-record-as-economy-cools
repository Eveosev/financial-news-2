Company bond sales in South  Korea 
retreated from a record set in 2011 this year as slowing
economic growth at home damped investor appetite for debt.  Korea Electric Power Corp. (015760)  led the offerings to 54.8
trillion won ($51.1 billion) as of Dec. 28, a 4.4 percent
decline from the same period of 2011, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. The 12 months to Dec. 31 is poised to be the
second-biggest year for corporate note sales in the country,
after 57.3 trillion won of debt was sold in 2011, the data
dating back to 1999 show.  South Korea’s economy grew 1.5 percent in the three months
to Sept. 30, the slowest pace in three years. The holding firm
of Woongjin Group, whose interests span energy, chemicals and
manufacturing, and its construction unit filed for bankruptcy
protection in September, undermining the confidence of investors
already rattled by worsening economic prospects. Bond sales will
probably be little changed in 2013, even with borrowing costs
expected to remain at record lows, according to KB Investment &
Securities Co., the top underwriter of corporate debt this year.  “Unless sentiment toward lower-rated companies improves
significantly, we expect sales volumes to be similar to 2012,”
Kim Jae Yean, a director at KB Investment & Securities’ debt
capital markets division, said in a Dec. 27 e-mailed response to
questions. Companies will continue to benefit from low interest
rates next year, Kim said.  Borrowing Costs  The Bank of Korea kept borrowing costs unchanged at 2.75
percent on Dec. 13 after 25 basis-point cuts in July and
October. Although Governor Kim Choong Soo said a rapid rebound
in growth is “unlikely,” the central bank said in its
statement the nation is poised for a “moderate” export-led
recovery and inflation will remain low, bolstering the view
rates will remain on hold.  KB Investment & Securities managed 8.37 trillion won of
note sales this year, giving it a 15.3 percent market share,
according to Bloomberg data. The Seoul-based unit of  KB
Financial Group Inc. (105560) , which owns the country’s largest lender,
was the No. 1 ranked arranger for a second consecutive year, the
data show.  Top Three  Woori Investment & Securities Co. (005940)  held its No. 2 position,
arranging 7.94 trillion won of debt for a 14.5 percent market
share. Korea Investment & Securities Co. ousted Samsung
Securities Co. to round out the top three, managing 7.9 trillion
won of sales for a 14.4 percent share, the data show.  Average yields on bonds sold by South Korean companies
rated AA- fell to 3.31 percent on Dec. 27, from 4.21 percent in
the end of 2011, Korea Financial Investment Association data
show. The  extra yield  investors demand to own the notes over
similar-maturity government debt has narrowed 29 basis points
this year to 48 basis points as of Dec. 27, the data show.  “The spread may widen as investors are increasingly driven
by risk aversion,” Kim Dae Young, a managing director who’s in
charge of debt sales at Woori Investment & Securities, said by
phone from  Seoul  yesterday. “It may take a while for investor
sentiment toward corporate bonds to stabilize.”  Slower Growth  South Korea’s government lowered its growth forecasts for
this year and 2013 yesterday as Europe’s debt crisis caps demand
for the nation’s exports. Gross domestic product will expand 3
percent next year, the Finance Ministry said in a statement,
less than the 4 percent predicted in September.  Financial Supervisory Service Governor Kwon Hyouk Se said
earlier this month the country’s regulators are considering
steps to help stimulate debt sales by lower-rated companies,
which may face a funding “crunch” next year on slowed economic
growth.  Korea Electric Power Corp., rated A+ by Standard & Poor’s,
was the nation’s biggest corporate borrower in 2012, with its
units selling 2.35 trillion won of notes, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Hyundai Heavy Industries Co. (009540) , the world’s
largest shipbuilder, followed with 1.95 trillion won of sales.  There are no further bond sales planned for the rest of
this year, according to preliminary data compiled by Bloomberg.  “In terms of rates and investor demand, this year has been
good for companies with some even raising funds in advance to
take advantage of the trend,” said Hwang Won Ha, a credit
analyst at HMC Investment Securities Co. “It’s difficult to
expect aggressive debt sales from companies next year as the
weak economy weighs on their spending plans.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
