Oil headed for the biggest weekly
gain since September in New York as U.S. lawmakers scheduled
talks aimed at averting automatic tax increases and spending
cuts that threaten the economy of the world’s largest consumer.  West Texas Intermediate climbed as much as 0.7 percent,
extending this week’s advance to 2.7 percent. Congressional
leaders plan to meet with President  Barack Obama  today, seeking
to resolve a budget impasse before at least $600 billion in
fiscal measures take effect on Jan. 1. House Majority Leader
 Eric Cantor  announced the chamber will meet Dec. 30 for its
first Sunday session in more than two years. U.S. stockpiles
shrank last week, an industry report showed yesterday.  “Prices could jump if U.S. politicians strike a deal on
avoiding the fiscal cliff,” said Michael Poulsen, an analyst at
Global Risk Management Ltd. in Middelfart, Denmark, who predicts
Brent, the benchmark grade for half the world’s oil, will be
little changed in the first quarter, averaging $112 a barrel.
“If no deal is struck, prices are likely to trade sideways at
current levels.”  WTI for February delivery climbed as much as 62 cents to
$91.49 a barrel in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  and was at $91.02 at 12:24 p.m. London time. The volume
traded for all contracts was about 34 percent below the 100-day
average. Futures are set for their first annual drop since 2008.  Brent for February settlement on the London-based ICE
Futures Europe exchange increased as much as 58 cents, or 0.5
percent, to $111.38 a barrel. The volume was 50 percent less
than the 100-day average. It was at a premium of $19.62 to WTI,
down from $19.93 yesterday, the narrowest closing spread in
almost 10 weeks.  Budget Meeting  Senate Majority Leader  Harry Reid , House Speaker  John Boehner , House Minority Leader  Nancy Pelosi  and Senate Minority
Leader  Mitch McConnell  are scheduled to attend the meeting with
Obama in  Washington  today, said White House spokeswoman  Amy Brundage . Cantor announced plans on Twitter for the Dec. 30
House session, without saying what action the chamber may take.  A failure to reach an agreement on the budget plan might
push the U.S. into a recession in the first half of 2013,
according to the nonpartisan  Congressional Budget Office .  WTI has declined 7.9 percent this year as the U.S. shale
boom deepened the glut at Cushing,  Oklahoma , America’s biggest
storage hub. That’s left it at an average $17.47 a barrel below
Brent this year, compared with a premium of about 95 cents in
the 10 years through 2010. Brent has risen 3.7 percent in 2012.  U.S. Stockpiles  U.S. crude inventories fell 1.17 million barrels to 370.5
million last week, the lowest in nine weeks, the industry-funded
 American Petroleum Institute  said yesterday. An Energy
Department report today may show a drop of 1.75 million,
according to the median estimate of 10 analysts  surveyed  by
 Bloomberg News . Supplies at Cushing, the delivery point for WTI
contracts, climbed 2.23 million barrels to a record 49.2
million, the API data showed.  The API collects stockpile information on a voluntary basis
from operators of refineries, bulk terminals and pipelines. The
government requires that reports be filed with the Energy
Department for its weekly survey.  Crude may rise next week as stronger economic growth boosts
demand, according to a separate Bloomberg survey. Nine of 18
analysts and traders, or 50 percent, forecast crude will advance
through Jan. 4. Eight respondents, or 44 percent, predicted a
decrease. Last week, 39 percent projected a gain.  Applications for U.S. unemployment-insurance payments fell
by 12,000 to 350,000 in the week ended Dec. 22, bringing the
average over the past month to the lowest in more than four
years, Labor Department data showed yesterday. Purchases of new
houses rose 4.4 percent to the highest level since April 2010,
according to the Commerce Department.  To contact the reporters on this story:
