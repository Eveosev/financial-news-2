Airline insurance claims for plane
accidents will drop below $1 billion this year for the first
time since 1991 as passenger fatalities and aircraft destroyed
hit record lows, advisory firm Ascend estimates.  Claims for aircraft losses and legal liabilities this year
will total about $980 million, or $300 million less than last
year, Ascend said in a report. Claims are almost half the $1.8
billion in premiums written in the period, it said.  The  International Air Transport Association  said earlier
this month that western-built jets suffered 0.19 “hull loss”
accidents per million flights this year through November as the
industry headed to its safest year on record. IATA’s figures
didn’t reflect the Dec. 25 crash of an Air Bagan Fokker 100 jet
in Myanmar in which one person on-board died and the out-of-
production aircraft was destroyed.  “Airline fatal accident rates have been steadily improving
and, on average, operations are now twice as safe as they were
15 years ago,”  Paul Hayes , head of safety at Ascend said in a
statement. “With such a benign insurance claims year and
increasing capacity in the market, we believe that premium
income will continue to fall in 2013.”  There is concern premium levels are “too low to be able to
maintain the market in the longer term,” Hayes said. Premiums
have declined for three years and for 2012 were more than $800
million below the 2003 level when they reached $2.7 billion, the
highest in the last 10 years.  Africa Improvements  In the first 11 months of this year, North Asian and North
American carriers had the lowest accident rates and African
carriers had the highest, according to IATA.  Measures being introduced in  Africa  to improve pilot
training and enhance safety audits are designed to help bring
airline safety in the region in line with current global
standards by 2015, Guenther Matschnigg, IATA’s senior vice
president for safety, said on Dec. 13.  The June 3 crash of a Dana Air MD-80 in  Nigeria  was the
deadliest accident this year, killing 153 people on-board and 10
on the ground, Ascend said. Of the four deadliest accidents in
2012, in which almost 90 percent of all fatalities occurred, two
were in Africa, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
