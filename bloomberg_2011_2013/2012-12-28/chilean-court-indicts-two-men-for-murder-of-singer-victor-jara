A Chilean court ordered the arrest
of two men, Hugo Sanchez and Pedro Barrientos, for the murder of
singer Victor Jara following a military coup in the South
American nation 39 years ago.  Jara was shot 44 times while being held in military custody
at  Chile â€™s national stadium in the days after  Augusto Pinochet 
seized power on Sept. 11, 1973, the court found according to a
copy of the resolution forwarded by e-mail by the press office
of the Chilean judiciary today. Five more men were indicted as
accomplices in the killing.  Since Barrientos is out of the country, the court ordered
an international arrest warrant to be issued.  Both men are former army officers, La Tercera reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
