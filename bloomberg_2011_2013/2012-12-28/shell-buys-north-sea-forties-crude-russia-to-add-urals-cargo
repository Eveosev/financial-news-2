Royal Dutch Shell Plc bought a cargo
of  North Sea  Forties blend at a higher premium than the previous
trade. Trafigura Beheer BV failed to find a buyer for a Brent
crude shipment for a second day.  Russia will add a 60,000 metric-ton top-up cargo of Urals
grade to January exports from the Black Sea port of
Novorossiysk, according to a final loading program obtained by
Bloomberg News.  North Sea  Shell purchased Forties lot F0107 for loading from Jan. 13
to Jan. 15 from Trafigura at a 5 cent premium to Dated Brent, a
Bloomberg survey of traders and brokers monitoring the Platts
pricing window showed. That’s up from a Dec. 24 deal at parity
to the benchmark.  Trafigura failed to find a buyer for Brent lot B0105 at a
95 premium to Dated Brent. That’s 20 cents less than its offer
yesterday.  Reported crude trading typically occurs during the Platts
window, which ends at 4:30 p.m.  London  time. Before the session,
Forties loading in 10 to 25 days rose to 4 cents less than Dated
Brent, data compiled by Bloomberg show. That compares with a
discount of 9 cents yesterday.  Brent for February settlement traded at $110 a barrel on
the ICE Futures Europe exchange in London at the close of the
window, compared with $110.15 in the previous session. The March
contract was at $108.93 a discount of $1.07 to February.  Mediterranean/Urals  There were no bids or offers for Russian Urals grade,
according to the Platts survey.  The Urals differential to Dated Brent in the Mediterranean
widened 22 cents to minus $1.01, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. That’s the most since Oct. 26. In northwest  Europe ,
the  discount  to Dated Brent increased 8 cents to $1.35, the data
showed. That’s the most since Oct. 9.  “The higher supply appears to already be taking its toll
on the European market for sour crude as assessments have
recently come under pressure,” Vienna-based consultants JBC
Energy GmbH said today in a report.  Novorossiysk will now handle 3.295 million tons in January,
or 779,108 barrels a day, according to the plan. That’s up 7.4
percent from a revised 3.069 million tons this month. Next
month’s plan includes two 80,000 ton cargoes of Siberian Light
and 30 lots of Urals.  A total of 5.4 million tons, or 1.277 million barrels a
day, will be shipped from Primorsk in 54 lots, according to the
final program. That’s unchanged from the preliminary program
obtained by Bloomberg on Dec. 26 and up 17 percent from a
revised 4.605 million tons in December.  There are 16 shipments of Urals totaling 1.6 million tons,
planned from Ust-Luga on the  Baltic Sea , according to the
program, down from 1.8 million tons this month. There is one
free position at the port in the final January program.  OAO Rosneft and OAO Surgutneftegas awarded tenders for the
sale of a total of 800,000 tons of Urals for loading in January
from Primorsk and Ust-Luga to BP Plc, Shell, Total SA, ENI SpA
and Talmay Trading, according to two people with knowledge of
the matter who asked not to be identified because the
information is confidential.  West Africa  Qua Iboe blend dropped 2 cents to $2.46 a barrel more than
Dated Brent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Equatorial Guinea  added a cargo of Zafiro crude to its
January export program, according to a revised loading schedule
obtained by  Bloomberg News .  The nation will now ship two 1 million barrel lots of
Zafiro and Ceiba as well as two 650,000 barrel consignments of
Aseng grade next month, the revised program showed. Exports will
total 189,286 barrels a day in January compared with 235,484
barrels this month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
