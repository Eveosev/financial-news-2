Ethanol  production  in the U.S.
advanced for the first time in three weeks, while inventories of
the fuel additive retreated.  Output rose 1.5 percent to 834,000 barrels a day in the
week ended Dec. 21, the highest level since Nov. 30, an Energy
Department report showed today. Stockpiles slid 2.5 percent to
20.3 million barrels, falling from the highest level since June
15 the previous week.  Imports declined to  26,000 barrels  a day from 37,000 in the
week earlier period, the department said. Ethanol-blended
gasoline made up about 89 percent of the total U.S. gasoline
pool, down from 93 percent in the week ended Dec. 14.  Denatured ethanol for January delivery was little changed
at $2.20 a gallon at 11:13 a.m. on the Chicago Board of Trade.  To contact the reporter on this story:
