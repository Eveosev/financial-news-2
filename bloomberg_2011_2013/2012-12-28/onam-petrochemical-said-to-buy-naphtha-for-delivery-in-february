Honam Petrochemical Corp. (011170)  bought at
least two cargoes of naphtha for delivery to  South Korea  in the
first half of February, according to three traders who
participate in the market.  The company paid a premium of about $15 to $17 a metric ton
to Japan benchmark prices, the traders said, asking not to be

Honam may have purchased as many as eight cargoes, according to
two of the traders.  A cargo typically contains about 25,000 to 30,000 tons of
naphtha.  To contact the reporter on this story:
