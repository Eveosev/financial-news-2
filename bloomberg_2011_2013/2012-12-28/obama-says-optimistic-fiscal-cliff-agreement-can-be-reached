President  Barack Obama  said he’s
“modestly optimistic” Congress can pass a bill to avert more
than $600 billion in tax increases and spending cuts set to take
effect in January.  “Let’s not miss this deadline,” Obama said at the White
House, following a meeting with the Democratic and Republican
leaders of Congress.  “The American people are not going to have any patience
for a politically self-inflicted wound to our economy,” he
said. The Congressional Budget Office has said that if Congress
doesn’t act, the tax and spending changes might cause a
recession in the first half of 2013.  Obama said that Senate Majority Leader  Harry Reid , a Nevada
Democrat, and Republican Leader Mitch McConnell of  Kentucky 
agreed to work on “a potential agreement.” If that can’t be
done, he called for a vote on his plan that he outlined Dec. 21.  To contact the reporter on this story:
