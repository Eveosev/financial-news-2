Chile ’s peso was headed for its
third annual rally in four years as economic growth beat
forecasts, inflation slowed and the price of copper rose.  The peso appreciated almost 0.1 percent to 479.63 per U.S.
dollar at 11:09 a.m. in Santiago, extending its advance in 2012
to 8.3 percent, the biggest among 25 emerging-market
counterparts after the currencies of  Poland ,  Hungary  and
Colombia. The peso climbed 4.6 percent in the second half of the
year, the most among major Latin American currencies. Copper,
Chile’s main export, has risen 4.5 percent this year.  Chile’s currency also strengthened as the nation’s interest
rates attracted investors who were able to profit by borrowing
in dollars and investing in pesos. Chile’s central bank has left
its  benchmark  rate at 5 percent since January, compared with the
U.S. target of zero to 0.25 percent.  “The difference between local and U.S. rates means its
more attractive to invest in Chile than other countries,” said
Francisco Schneider, the head of foreign exchange at Celfin
Capital SA in Santiago. “You can make more money in Chilean
deposits. The high price of copper, the strong, stable economy
and low inflation also make it attractive to invest here.”  The currency should trade in a range of 470 to 500 per
dollar next year, Schneider said.  Gross domestic product expanded 5.7 percent in the third
quarter from a year earlier, beating analysts’ estimates for a
second straight quarter.  Unemployment in Chile fell to 6.2 percent in November , the
lowest since the National Statistics Institute reset its index
in 2009, and retail sales rose 10.7 percent last month from a
year earlier, reports showed today.  International investors in the peso forwards market lowered
their bets against the currency to $5.1 billion on Dec. 26 from
$9.8 billion on June 29. At the end of 2011 international
investors had a $6.1 billion short peso position, according to
data published by the central bank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
