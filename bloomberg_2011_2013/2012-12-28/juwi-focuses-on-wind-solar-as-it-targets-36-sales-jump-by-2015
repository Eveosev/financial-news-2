Juwi Holding AG, a German renewable
energy developer, said it will focus on wind and solar projects
as it seeks to increase sales by 36 percent by 2015.  Juwi this year cut jobs, withdrew from developing heating
plants fueled by wood and facilities that make wood pellets and
reduced investment in electric mobility and biogas projects as
it carried out a “necessary consolidation,” the Woerrstadt-
based company said in an e-mailed statement today. Sales climbed
10 percent to 1.1 billion euros ($1.5 billion), it said.  “Our projections indicate that the total turnover of the
Juwi group will increase  to nearly 1.5 billion euros by 2015,”
Chief Financial Officer Martin Winter said in the statement.
German and international wind and solar projects will contribute
most to future sales, it said.  Juwi, which employs about 1,800 people in 15 countries
including the U.S., South Africa and  India , said it has
developed wind and solar projects with a total capacity of about
2,500 megawatts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
