Natural gas futures advanced in New
York, capping the second straight weekly gain, on speculation
that a cold start to January will drive up heating-fuel demand.  Gas rose 1.7 percent as forecasters including Commodity
Weather Group LLC predicted below-normal temperatures for most
of the lower 48 states over the next six to 10 days. An Energy
Department report today showed U.S. stockpiles fell 72 billion
cubic feet last week to 3.652 trillion, in line with estimates
by  analysts  and Bloomberg users.  “At this point this is the coldest weather we’ve come
across in the Northeast and the prices are following that,”
said  John Woods , president of JJ Woods Associates and a trader
on the floor of the  New York Mercantile Exchange . The stockpile
number “came in exactly where we thought it would come in. It
was a non-event.”  Natural gas for February delivery rose 5.7 cents to settle
at $3.469 per million British thermal units on the Nymex. Prices
gained 0.5 percent this week and have increased 16 percent this
year, heading for the first annual gain since 2007. Futures
trading volume was down 58 percent from the 100-day average as
of 2:33 p.m.  Options volume jumped in late trading. The most active
contracts were February $4.20 calls, which fell 0.2 cent to 0.7
cent on volume of 5,636 lots as of 3 p.m. February $2.90 puts
slid 0.6 cent to 0.6 cent on volume of 5,233. Puts accounted for
52 percent of trading.  “For natural gas the winter months are like the  Super
Bowl , where this is the main event for the year,” said Tom Saal, senior vice president of energy trading at INTL Hencorp
Futures LLC in Miami. “When the forecasts change from above
normal to below normal, they will have an impact on pricing.”  Cold Weather  Temperatures will be below average across most of the lower
48 states over the next six to 10 days, according to forecasters
including Commodity Weather Group LLC in Bethesda,  Maryland .  The low in  Detroit  on Jan. 3 may be 11 degrees Fahrenheit
(minus 12 Celsius), 10 below normal, and the next day Boston’s
low may be 8 below the usual reading at 15 degrees, according to
AccuWeather Inc. in  State College ,  Pennsylvania .  About 50 percent of U.S. households use gas for heating,
department data show.  “If we do get some cold weather, you are seeing some calls
for sizable withdrawals,” said  Gene McGillian , an analyst and
broker at Tradition Energy in  Stamford ,  Connecticut .  The five-year average U.S. inventory drop in the week ended
Dec. 21 was 140 billion cubic feet, department data show. A gas
 surplus  to the average expanded to 12.8 percent from 10.2
percent the previous week.  Price Outlook  Gas prices  will be higher in 2013 as more normal demand in
the heating season from November through March erodes stockpiles
that ballooned last winter, the department said its Dec. 11
 Short-Term Energy Outlook . The surplus widened to 61 percent by
the end of March after the fourth-warmest U.S. winter on record
reduced gas consumption amid record production.  Gas at the  Henry Hub  in Erath,  Louisiana , the delivery
point for New York futures, will average $3.68 per million Btu
in 2013, up 32 percent from this year, according to the monthly
report.  The Energy Department expects gas  production  to increase
0.5 percent in 2013 to 69.59 billion cubic feet a day from an
all-time daily high of 69.22 billion this year.  Stockpiles have reached  record highs  for four straight
years as hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, made it economical
to extract gas from shale deposits such as the Marcellus in the
Northeast, department data show.  The  gas-rig count  rose by two this week to 431, the most
since the week ended Oct. 5, data from Baker Hughes Inc. show.
The total has dropped 47 percent this year.  The U.S. produced 83 percent of its energy in the first
nine months of the year, on track to be the highest level since
1991, U.S. Department of Energy data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
