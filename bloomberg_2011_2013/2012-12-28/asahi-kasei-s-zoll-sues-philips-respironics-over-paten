Asahi Kasei Corp. (3407) ’s Zoll unit sued
 Royal Philips Electronics (PHIA) ’ Respironics Inc. alleging
infringement of a U.S. patent with equipment used to monitor
patients being treated for sleep-disordered breathing.  Zoll, based in Chelmsford, Massachusetts, contends
Respironics is wrongly using protected technology for data
collection, covered by a 2004 patent, in its Philips
 EncoreAnywhere  respirator, according to a complaint filed
yesterday in federal court in Wilmington, Delaware.  “Respironics does not have a license or permission to use
the patent,” and “Zoll will continue to suffer additional
irreparable injury” if a judge doesn’t stop the infringement,
plaintiff’s lawyers said in court papers.  The patent covers a system of data-collection and
management for medical devices worn by patients, with electronic
readings transmitted over the Internet to a doctor’s office or
other location.  A spokeswoman for Murrysville, Pennsylvania-based
Respironics, Maryellen Bizzack, didn’t immediately return voice
and e-mailed messages seeking comment on the lawsuit.  The case is Zoll v. Respironics, 12-cv-1778, U.S. District
Court, District of  Delaware  (Wilmington).  To see the patent, click: 6,681,003.  To contact the reporter on this story:
