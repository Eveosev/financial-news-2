Banco do Brasil SA , Latin America’s
biggest lender by assets, jumped to a three-month high as
Brazilian banks rallied after the central bank reduced  reserve
requirements  to spur flagging investments.  The lender’s shares rose 2.5 percent to 25.69 reais at 5
p.m. in  Sao Paulo , the highest since Sept. 27. It was the best
performance on the MSCI Brazil/Financials Index, which advanced
1.5 percent.  Large banks that provide loans for investment in machines,
equipment and other capital goods can deduct as much as 20
percent of reserve requirements, the central bank said in a
statement yesterday. The change applies to lenders with a
minimum of 6 billion reais ($2.9 billion) in total equity, and
the monetary authority said it expects the measure to create 15
billion reais in fresh credit.  “It’s very good news for banks,” Sandro Fernandes, a
trader at brokerage Corval, said by phone from  Belo Horizonte ,
Brazil. “The Brazilian government has been pressuring banks to
lend more, and this measure has the same spirit.”  President  Dilma Rousseff ’s administration has demanded that
banks reduce borrowing costs, ordered power utilities and phone
companies to cut prices, capped car imports from Mexico and
lowered taxes on  consumer goods  to boost domestic spending and
spur growth in Latin America’s biggest economy.  Banco do Brasil rose 38 percent from this year’s low on
July 17 through yesterday. The benchmark Bovespa index increased
12 percent during the same period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
