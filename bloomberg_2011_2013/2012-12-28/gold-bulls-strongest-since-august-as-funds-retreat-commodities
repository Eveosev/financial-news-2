Gold traders are the most bullish in
four months as U.S. lawmakers near a deadline for budget talks,
at a time when hedge funds are cutting bets on higher prices.  Fifteen of 19 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg expect prices
to rise next week and one was bearish. A further three were
neutral, making the proportion of bulls the highest since Aug.
24. Investors bought 60 percent more this year through gold-
backed  exchange-traded products  compared with 2011, boosting
holdings to a record on Dec. 20 and which are now valued at
$140.5 billion, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Bullion is headed for a 12th consecutive annual gain, the
longest run in at least nine decades, as central banks from
Europe to China pledge more steps to spur economic growth. Hedge
funds that were the most bullish in 13 months in October have
since pared wagers by 43 percent as lawmakers failed to agree on
a deal to avert more than $600 billion of automatic tax
increases and spending cuts scheduled to start next month.  “The problems we’ve seen over the last year haven’t
disappeared,” said Thorsten Proettel, a commodities analyst at
Landesbank Baden Wuerttemberg in Stuttgart, Germany. “There is
still lots of potential for trouble in the world and that is a
good reason for people to stay in gold or buy more.”  The metal advanced 5.9 percent to $1,656.19 an ounce in
London this year, even after heading for a third consecutive
monthly drop. The Standard & Poor’s GSCI gauge of 24 commodities
dropped less than 0.1 percent and the MSCI All-Country World
 Index (MXWD)  of equities climbed 13 percent. Treasuries returned 2.3
percent, a Bank of America Corp. index shows.  Debt Purchases  The Federal Reserve said Dec. 12 it would buy $45 billion
of Treasury securities a month from January, adding to $40
billion a month of existing mortgage-debt purchases. Gold rose
70 percent as the Fed bought $2.3 trillion of debt in two rounds
of monetary easing from December 2008 through June 2011. The
European Central Bank, Bank of Japan and China have all pledged
to do more to bolster their economies.  Investors buying bullion as a hedge against inflation and a
weaker dollar generally earn returns only through price gains.
The U.S. Dollar Index, a measure against six currencies, is
headed for the first annual drop in three years. As Europe still
contends with a three-year debt crisis, U.S. Treasury Secretary
Timothy F. Geithner said there’s “significant uncertainty”
around tax and spending policies, according to a letter to
congressional leaders Dec. 26.  Gold Holdings  ETP holdings gained 274.9 metric tons this year and reached
a record 2,632.5 tons on Dec. 20, equal to almost a year of mine
production, data compiled by Bloomberg and Barclays Plc show.
Nations from Brazil to Iraq to Russia are buying metal to add to
reserves. Options traders are also bullish, with the 13 most
widely held contracts conferring the right to buy at prices from
$1,750 to $2,700 from January to November, Comex data show.  Speculators are becoming less positive, reducing their net-
long position to 112,421 futures and options in the week to Dec.
18, the least since August, U.S. Commodity Futures Trading
Commission data show. Hedge funds’  bets  on a rally this year
were on average 28 percent lower than in 2011.  There are signs that physical demand is slowing, with U.S.
Mint sales of American Eagle gold coins at 69,500 ounces so far
this month, 49 percent less than the November total, data on its
website show. The mint’s sales are down 25 percent this year.  Record Average  While prices averaged a record $1,668 so far this year,
they’re yet to beat the all-time high of $1,921.15 set in
September 2011. Gold will probably peak next year because of
improving U.S. growth, even as the Fed expands stimulus, Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. said in a Dec. 5 report. It still expects an
average of $1,750 in 2014.  The drop of as much as 8.9 percent since Oct. 5 pushed gold
below its 200-day moving average last week for the first time
since August. Prices slid almost 10 percent in seven weeks after
falling below the measure in March.  The 14-day relative-strength index was at 31.8 yesterday,
near the level of 30 that indicates to some analysts who study
such charts that a gain in prices may be imminent.  In other commodities, eight of 18 traders and analysts
surveyed expect copper to rise next week, six were bearish and
four were neutral. The metal for delivery in three months, the
London Metal Exchange’s benchmark contract, climbed 4 percent to
$7,903 a ton this year.  Sugar Survey  Three of eight people surveyed expect raw sugar to fall
next week and four predict little change. The commodity slid 16
percent to 19.52 cents a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in New York
this year.  Fourteen of 28 people surveyed anticipate a gain in corn
prices next week and 10 said the grain will drop, while 13 of 30
said soybeans will decline and 12 expect higher prices. Twelve
of 26 traders predicted rising wheat prices and 10 were bearish.
Corn rose 6.8 percent to $6.9075 a bushel this year as soybeans
advanced 17 percent to $14.1625 a bushel in Chicago. Wheat
gained 19 percent to $7.765 a bushel.  The S&P GSCI gauge is heading for its worst performance
since 2008. Money managers cut bullish bets across 18 U.S.
commodities to the lowest level in almost six months, according
to CFTC data. While the International Monetary Fund cut its 2013
growth forecast twice since July, it expects a 3.6 percent
global expansion next year, from 3.3 percent this year.  “The fiscal cliff is certainly having some impact on price
action on a day-to-day basis, although markets at the moment are
pretty quiet,” said Colin O’Shea, the head of commodities at
Hermes Investment Management Ltd. in London, which manages about
$2.3 billion of raw-material assets. “A resolution of the
fiscal cliff in some form could provide a short-term impact on
the market. We may see increased inflation going forward which
will bode well for commodities.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
