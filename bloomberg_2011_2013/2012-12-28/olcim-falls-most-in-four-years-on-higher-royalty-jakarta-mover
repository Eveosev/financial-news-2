PT Holcim  Indonesia , a unit of the
world’s largest cement maker, plunged the most in more than four
years in Jakarta trading after it agreed to pay higher royalty
fees.  Holcim Indonesia slumped 17 percent to 2,900 rupiah today,
the steepest decline since October 2008 and the  biggest drag  on
the benchmark  Jakarta Composite Index (JCI) , which gained 0.8 percent.
Trading volume for the stock was more than 13 times its three-
month daily average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The company, based in Jakarta, signed a royalty agreement
with Holcim Technology Ltd. on Dec. 26, as part of a move to
standardize licensing agreement globally, according to a
statement to the stock exchange. Under the new accord, Holcim
will pay a 4 percent tariff rate next year and 5 percent in 2014
and beyond. This compares with the  current rate  of 2.5 percent,
according to Rusli Setiawan, a company spokesman.  “This will hit the company’s margin and bottom line,”
said Triwira Tjandra, a Jakarta-based analyst at Ciptadana
Securities. “My calculations suggest this could push down the
earnings by 25 percent to 33 percent from the current level.”  Holcim Indonesia shares  have climbed 64 percent this year
before today’s decline, outperforming the 12 percent gain in the
benchmark index. That compares with its competitors PT
Indocement Tunggal Prakarsa and PT Semen Gresik, whose shares
have risen 32 percent and 40 percent respectively in the same
period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
