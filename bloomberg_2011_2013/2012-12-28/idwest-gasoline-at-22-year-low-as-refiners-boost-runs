Midwest gasoline fell to the weakest
level in more than  two decades  as low crude prices and strong
profit margins encouraged refiners to process more oil, adding
to a glut in the region.  Midwest refiners last week processed an average of 3.48
million barrels of oil a day, 6.1 percent higher than the five-
year average of  3.28 million , according to the Energy
Department. The profit, or  crack spread,  from turning oil into
refined products in the Midwest for this time of year is the
highest since at least 2006, data compiled by Bloomberg data
showed.  Conventional gasoline  in the Midcontinent, or Group 3
market, weakened 3.5 cents to a discount of 39 cents below
futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange at 2:40 p.m., the
lowest level since at  least 1990 . Conventional gasoline to be
blended with ethanol, or CBOB, in  Chicago  was unchanged at a
discount of  28 cents .  “The number one thing putting pressure on prices is the
cheap crude oil,” Lewis Adam, president of ADMO Energy LLC, a
supply consultant in  Kansas City ,  Missouri , said by phone today.
“As refiners access this cheaper crude, they are running at
this outrageous capacity.”  West Texas Intermediate oil for February delivery fell 7
cents to settle at $90.80 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange .  The 5-3-2 crack spread, a measure of refining
profitability, for Midwest gasoline and diesel over West Texas
Intermediate was $34.93 a barrel at 3:34 p.m., down from $36.08
yesterday. Profits have more than doubled so far this year,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  ‘Pressure’  Inventories of  motor fuel  in the Midwest, known as PADD 2,
increased 467,000 barrels to 50.3 million in the week ended Dec.
21, the highest level for this time of year since 2006,
department data showed. U.S. demand for gasoline fell by 10,000
barrels to 8.61 million barrels a day.  “It’s the overall supply of crude out there, and not just
crude but crude at very low prices,” Carl Larry, president of
Oil Outlooks LLC, said in a phone interview from Houston.
“Midwest PADD 2 refineries are running well over 90 percent.
We’re not going to see a large demand for products so it’s
keeping pressure on prices.”  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel  in the region weakened 1.62 cents
to 6.5 cents a gallon below heating oil futures, the widest
discount since Feb. 22. The same fuel was unchanged in Chicago
at a discount of 7 cents.  Midwest supplies of  distillates  including heating oil and
diesel gained 371,000 barrels to 25.8 million, a second
consecutive weekly advance, the department said today. Demand
slipped about 12 percent to 3.71 million barrels a day.  “We’re going to continue to see low gasoline and diesel
prices for the next month or two,” Larry said. “Then we’ll
pick back up depending how soon the season breaks and we see
more demand.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
