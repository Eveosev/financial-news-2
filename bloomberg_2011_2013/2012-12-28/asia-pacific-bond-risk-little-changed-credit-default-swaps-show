The cost of insuring corporate and
sovereign bonds from non-payment in the Asia-Pacific region was
little changed, according to credit-default swap traders.  The Markit iTraxx  Japan  index was quoted at 158 basis
points as of 10:36 a.m. in  Tokyo , Deutsche Bank AG prices show.
The measure, which has ranged from 136.2 to 229.5 this year, is
down 64.8 basis points this quarter, on track for its biggest
three-month decline since the period ended June 2009, according
to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan was also little changed at 111 basis
points as of 8:48 a.m. in Singapore, Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc prices show. The gauge has ranged from 107 to 209.9
basis points this year and is down 96 basis points, its biggest
12-month decline since 2009, according to CMA, which is owned by
McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the
private market.  The Markit iTraxx  Australia  was steady at 124.5 basis
points as of 10:47 a.m. in Sydney, according to Westpac Banking
Corp. prices. The benchmark has ranged from 120.2 basis points
to 211.1 basis points this year and is down 56 basis points,
also on track for its biggest 12-month drop since 2009, CMA
prices show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
