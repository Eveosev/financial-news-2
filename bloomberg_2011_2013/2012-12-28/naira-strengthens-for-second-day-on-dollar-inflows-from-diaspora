Nigeria ’s naira strengthened for a
second day, reaching the highest in more than two months, as
citizens living abroad returned for the holiday period,
increasing the supply of dollars.  The currency of  Africa ’s biggest oil producer appreciated
0.6 percent to 156 a dollar at 2:13 p.m. in Lagos, the
commercial capital. The naira has risen 4 percent this year, the
second-best performer in Africa, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  “Many Nigerians in the diaspora have come home with
dollars, which has increased the supply,” Pabina Yinkere, head
of research at Vetiva Capital Management Ltd., said by phone
from Lagos today.  Remittances to sub-Saharan African countries from citizens
abroad are forecast to increase 6.3 percent to $24 billion, the
 World Bank  said in June. Nigeria, Kenya, Sudan, Senegal and
 South Africa  are the largest recipients of remittances in sub-
Saharan Africa, with about 69 percent of the funds in 2010 from
migrants in the U.S. and Western Europe, according to the bank.  The yield on Nigeria’ $500 million of Eurobonds due January
2021 declined one basis point to 4.008 percent today.  Ghana’s cedi fell 0.2 percent to 1.9050 per dollar in
Accra, the capital. The currency of West Africa’s second-largest
economy has fallen 0.6 percent this week and 16 percent this
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
