Magnum Hunter Resources Corp. (MHR)  said
it may have “second thoughts” about selling assets in the
Eagle Ford shale after getting results from two wells.  The Rhino Hunter No. 1 and Zebra Hunter No. 1 wells, both
in Lavaca County,  Texas , “are by far our best producers since
we initiated drilling operations in this play in 2010,” Gary
Evans, chairman and chief executive officer of Magnum Hunter,
said in a statement today.  “With these consistent results, and the significant
reserve additions we are seeing from new wells that are
now exceeding 500,000 barrels of oil equivalent per well, our
management and board may very well have second thoughts about
our decision to possibly completely divest these properties at
this time,” Evans said.  The CEO said last month that the company was shopping the
assets and may have “some sort of understanding” on a sale of
its 26,000 acres in the Eagle Ford by the end of the year.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
