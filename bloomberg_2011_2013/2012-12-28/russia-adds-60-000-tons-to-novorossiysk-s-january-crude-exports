Russia  will add a 60,000 metric-ton
top-up cargo of Urals crude to January exports from the Black
Sea port of Novorossiysk, a final loading program obtained by
 Bloomberg News  showed.  Novorossiysk will handle 3.295 million tons in January, or
779,108 barrels a day, according to the plan. That’s up 7.4
percent from a revised 3.069 million tons this month. Next
month’s plan includes two 80,000 ton cargoes of Siberian Light
and 30 lots of Urals blend.  A total of 5.4 million tons, or 1.277 million barrels a
day, will be shipped from Primorsk in 54 lots, according to the
final program. That’s unchanged from the preliminary program
obtained by Bloomberg on Dec. 26 and up 17 percent from a
revised 4.605 million tons in December.  There are 16 shipments of Urals crude totaling 1.6 million
tons, or 378,323 barrels a day, planned from Ust-Luga on the
 Baltic Sea , according to the program, down from 1.8 million tons
this month. There is one free position at the port in the final
January program.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
