U.K. 10-year gilts rose this week,
with yields falling the most in a month, as speculation U.S.
lawmakers will fail to reach agreement in time to avoid the so-
called fiscal cliff boosted demand for safer assets.  Ten-year yields fell to the  lowest  in more than two weeks
today as concern increased whether U.S. leaders will find a way
to avoid the more than $600 billion in spending cuts and tax
increases that will start in January. The pound strengthened
against all its 16 major counterparts before U.K. reports next
week that economists say will show improvement in house prices,
consumer credit and mortgage lending.  “The rally in gilts in the past week can largely be
attributed to concerns about the U.S. fiscal cliff,” said
Abhishek Singhania, a fixed-income strategist at Deutsche Bank
AG in  London . “Poor liquidity conditions have also had an
effect.”  The  10-year gilt  yield fell six basis points, or 0.06
percentage point, this week to 1.82 percent at 5 p.m. London
time. The rate was little changed today after dropping as much
as four basis points to 1.77 percent, the lowest since Dec. 11.
The 1.75 percent bond due in September 2022 traded at 99.36.  U.S. congressional leaders plan to meet with President
 Barack Obama  today and House Republicans said they will convene
Dec. 30 as lawmakers seek to avoid the spending cuts and tax
gains.  Annual Return  Gilts returned 3 percent this year through yesterday,
according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. German bunds gained
4.4 percent and Treasuries earned 2.2 percent.  The pound strengthened 0.5 percent to 81.82 pence per euro
after gaining as much as 0.7 percent, the biggest increase since
Dec. 6. Sterling appreciated 0.4 percent to $1.6157.  Mortgage approvals rose to 54,000 last month from 52,982 in
October, according to a median forecast of 15 analysts in a
Bloomberg News survey, before the data is released on Jan. 3.  Bank of England Deputy Governor Charlie Bean said last
month the central bank’s Funding for Lending program, which
started in August, is showing a “clear sign” of feeding
through to households.  The Nationwide Building Society will say U.K. home prices
fell 0.9 percent in December from a year ago, less than
November’s 1.2 percent drop, according to a Bloomberg survey
before the data is released next week. An index of construction
output climbed to 49.5 from 49.3, a separate survey showed ahead
of the Jan. 3 report from Markit Economics.  “We see some signs of the U.K. economy stabilizing,” said
 Geoffrey Yu , a currency strategist at UBS AG in London. “We
expect the pound to continue to outperform the euro next year.”  The pound has appreciated 1.5 percent in 2012, according to
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes, which track 10
developed-market currencies. The euro declined 0.7 percent and
the dollar fell 2.8 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
