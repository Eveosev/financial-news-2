Japanese stocks rose, with the
 Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  capping its biggest yearly advance
since 2005, as the yen weakened after consumer prices and
industrial production data fueled speculation the central bank
will respond to calls for more stimulus.  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  gained 1.9 percent to its highest close
in two years. Toshiba Corp. jumped 5 percent after saying it’s
in talks to sell its stake in an atomic-power unit.  Tokyo
Electric Power Co. (9501) , owner of the reactors at the center of last
year’s nuclear disaster, fell 6.4 percent after being sued by
U.S. sailors who claim they were exposed to radiation.  The Nikkei 225 gained 0.7 percent on the year’s last
trading day to close at 10,395.18, the highest since March 10,
2011. The measure climbed 23 percent in 2012. The broader  Topix
Index (TPX)  increased 0.7 percent to 859.80 today, with about eight
stocks rising for every seven that fell.  “We’ve entered a positive cycle of a weaker yen and higher
stock prices,” said Juichi Wako, a senior strategist at Tokyo-
based Nomura Holdings Inc. “We’re likely to see more capital
flowing in from investors as the risk of not owning Japanese
stocks becomes stronger.”  The Topix has risen about 19 percent since Nov. 14, when
the former government said it would hold a general election in
December and as a more pro-stimulus  Liberal Democratic Party ,
led by Shinzo Abe, took power. Japan’s markets are shut for the
first four days of next week for the New Year holidays.  The gauge trades at 1 times book value, meaning that
companies can be bought for roughly the value of their assets.
The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index trades for 2.1 times book value.  Fiscal Cliff  Futures on the  S&P 500  were little changed today after
 House Republicans  announced the chamber will meet on Dec. 30 --
its first Sunday session in more than two years -- as lawmakers
seek a budget deal before a year-end deadline. Unless a
compromise is reached, more than $600 billion in automatic tax
increases and spending cuts will come into effect in January.  Exporters rose after the yen fell as worsening consumer
price and output data boosted the case for increasing monetary
and fiscal stimulus to spur growth. Abe has called for unlimited
monetary easing and a 2 percent inflation target in a bid to
revive the economy, which last quarter fell into its fifth
technical recession in 15 years.  Toyota, the world’s biggest carmaker, rose 1.9 percent to
4,005 yen, providing the single  biggest boost  to the Topix
index. The automaker rose 56 percent this year.  Honda Motor Co. gained 1.1 percent today to 3,145 yen.
Canon Inc., the world’s biggest camera maker, increased 2.1
percent to 3,340 yen.  Yen Forecast Cut  The yen touched 86.64 per dollar today, the weakest since
Aug. 3, 2010. Forecasts for  Japan ’s currency were cut by
JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Nomura Holdings Inc., which cited Abe’s
plan to spur inflation.  Consumer prices excluding fresh food fell 0.1 percent from
a year earlier in November, the statistics bureau said today in
 Tokyo . A separate report showed industrial production fell 1.7
percent from October. The slide was worse than all 27 estimates
in a Bloomberg News survey with a median forecast of a 0.5
percent decline.  Among other stocks that rose, Toshiba jumped 5 percent to
337 yen. The company is in talks to sell a stake in its
Westinghouse Electric atomic-power unit as industry growth
slows, Toru Ohara, a spokesman for Tokyo-based Toshiba, said.  Gains in the Topix were limited as Tokyo Electric Power led
a decline by power suppliers. The utility lost 6.4 percent to
206 yen after a report it is being sued by eight U.S. sailors
claiming they were exposed to radiation and the utility lied
about the dangers.  The Nikkei 225’s 14-day Relative Strength Index, a measure
of trading momentum, rose to 79 today. Some investors view a
reading above 70 as a sign the market is overbought.  The  Nikkei Stock Average Volatility Index (VNKY)  fell 3.1 percent
to 22.45, indicating traders expect a swing of about 6.4 percent
on the gauge over the next 30 days. Trading volume on the Nikkei
225 was about 24 percent above the 30-day average.  To contact the reporters on this story:
