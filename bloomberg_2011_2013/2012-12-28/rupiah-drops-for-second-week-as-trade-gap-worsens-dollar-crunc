Indonesia ’s rupiah gained by the
most in more than a week as the trade shortfall is forecast to
have narrowed last month, easing concern there is a lack of
dollars in the local market. Government bonds declined.  November’s  trade deficit  will be $342 million, compared
with $1.5 billion in October, a Bloomberg survey shows before
data due Jan. 2. As the gap shrinks, the pressure on the rupiah
will lessen, Bank Indonesia Governor Darmin Nasution said today.
Financial markets will be closed on Dec. 31 and Jan. 1.  “It seems demand for dollars is sufficiently met,” said
Wiwig Santoso, the Jakarta-based head of treasury and markets at
PT DBS Bank Indonesia, the local unit of Southeast Asia’s
largest lender.  The rupiah strengthened 0.3 percent today to 9,638 per
dollar as of 5:02 p.m. in Jakarta, the most since Dec. 18,
prices from local banks compiled by Bloomberg show. It advanced
0.2 percent this week. The rupiah is the worst-performing
currency this year among Asia’s 10 most-active excluding the yen,
falling 5.9 percent.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves
in exchange rates used to price options, was steady at 5.7
percent today and this week, from 13.2 percent at the end of
last year. It is poised for the biggest annual drop since 2009.  The yield on the government’s 7 percent bonds due May 2022
climbed one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 5.20
percent today, closing prices from the Inter Dealer Market
Association show. The yield rose two basis points this week and
fell 90 basis points, or 0.9 percentage point, in 2012,
declining for a fourth year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
