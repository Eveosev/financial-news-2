Serbia’s economy contracted 2.5
percent in the third quarter from a year earlier as agriculture
and construction extended declines, the national statistics
office in Belgrade said today.  The decline in gross domestic product exceeded the the
statistics office’s preliminary forecast for a 2.2 percent
contraction in the third quarter.  GDP fell a revised 0.6 percent in the second quarter from a
year earlier, compared with a previously forecast 0.8 percent
contraction, and declined a revised 2.3 percent in the first
three months rather than the originally estimated 2.5 percent
drop, the statistics office said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
