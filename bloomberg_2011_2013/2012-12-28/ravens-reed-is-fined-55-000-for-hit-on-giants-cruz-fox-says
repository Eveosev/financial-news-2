Baltimore Ravens safety Ed Reed was
fined $55,000 by the National Football League for an illegal hit
on  New York  Giants receiver  Victor Cruz , Fox Sports said, citing
an unidentified person familiar with the discipline.  Reed had received a personal foul penalty for the helmet-
to-helmet hit on Cruz during the fourth quarter of the Ravens’
33-14 win on Dec. 23. Cruz said after the game he thought it was
a clean hit.  Reed, who earlier this week was selected to the Pro Bowl
for the ninth time in his 11-year career, last month had a one-
game suspension for illegal hits reduced to a $50,000 fine.  To contact the reporter on this story:
