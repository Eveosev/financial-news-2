The eastern spur of the  New Jersey
Turnpike  was closed this morning after a state trooper crashed
through a guardrail and drove off the road.  The trooper was taken by helicopter to the hospital, said
 Tom Feeney , a turnpike authority spokesman, who didn’t know the
officer’s condition. One lane of the spur is open during the
accident investigation, and all traffic out of the Lincoln
Tunnel is being diverted to Route 3, Feeney said.  Sergeant Adam Grossman of the state police said the
accident occured about 8:20 a.m.  New York  time near milepost 113
in Secaucus. The trooper’s car overturned and the officer was
trapped, Grossman said. No other cars were involved.  Grossman declined to identify the trooper or specify his
injuries, though he said he was airlifted to University Hospital
in Newark with non-life threatening injuries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
