Ghana’s economic growth, set to beat
the African average for a sixth year in 2013, risks boosting
imports and fueling further weakness in the region’s third-worst
performing currency, according to  Standard Bank  Group Ltd. and
 Ecobank Transnational Inc. (ETI)   The cedi, which has declined 14 percent against the U.S.
currency this year, may slump to 2.15 a dollar over the next 12
months, according to Ecobank’s head of economic research, Angus Downie. Samir Gadio, emerging-markets strategist at Standard
Bank, sees the Ghanaian unit at 1.95 a dollar by the end of
2013. It weakened 0.3 percent to 1.9065 a dollar by 2:15 p.m. in
the capital, Accra, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “We expect the cedi to depreciate, driven by continued
strong demand for imports, both of capital and consumer goods,”
Downie said in an e-mailed response to questions on Dec. 20.
“We think real gross domestic product will expand by around 8
percent in 2013 due to robust domestic demand and growth in
exports.”  Since the start of oil exports in December 2010,  Ghana ’s
expansion has spurred demand for imported fuel, food and
consumer products. Growth in the 67.4 billion-cedi ($35 billion)
economy is forecast to reach 8.2 percent in 2012 year and 7.8
percent in 2013, outpacing the 5.7 percent projection for next
year in sub-Saharan  Africa , according to the  International
Monetary Fund .  Exchange Rate  Ghana will continue to attract investment into energy,
construction and services industries, Sampson Akligoh, head of
research at Databank Financial Services Ltd. in Accra, said by
phone on Dec. 20. “We see this trend continuing together with
the associated demand for dollars to import inputs,” he said,
forecasting the cedi at 2.01 a dollar by the end of 2013.  The  Bank of Ghana  sells dollars from its gross foreign
reserves to companies, pegging the amount offered at irregular
sales to demand in a bid to steady the exchange rate. It sold
$4.2 billion in the year to Nov. 13.  As the cedi dropped 18 percent in the first half of 2012,
the central bank also boosted rates on its benchmark  three-month 
Treasury bills to make local assets more attractive than dollar
investments and stem the currency’s decline. The yield reached
23.12 percent on Oct. 19, the most in almost three years.  At the latest auction on Dec. 21, the rate was 23.08
percent, the highest in Africa. That compares with  Kenya ’s 91-
day  rate  of 8.14 percent, while its currency lost 1.1 percent
this year.  Nigeria ’s naira has gained 3.2 percent in 2012 and
it’s three-month borrowing costs were 12.02 percent at the Dec.
19 auction.  Dollar Deposits  Ghana also this year re-introduced bills with maturities of
30, 60, and 270 days to provide other ways to invest in cedis.
Lenders were asked to keep reserves on dollar deposits accounts
in cedis and provide 100 percent cover for cedi accounts held by
foreign financial institutions.  “If Bank of Ghana continues with these measures, the cedi
will gain to as much as 1.7 a dollar next year,” Benjamin
Dzoboku, treasurer at  HFC Bank Ghana Ltd. (HFC)  in Accra, said in an
interview on Dec. 19. The currency has gained 2.2 percent in the
second half of 2012.  The 91-day yield will decline next year in line with
falling government financing needs, London-based Gadio said in
an e-mailed response to queries on Dec. 20. It may drop as much
as 1,000 basis points, or 10 percentage points, by the last
auction in 2013, he said.  The  budget deficit  may narrow to between 4.5 percent and 5
percent of gross domestic product next year as spending slows
after the election campaigns of 2012 drove up expenditure, Gadio
said. The fiscal gap widened to 7.3 percent of GDP in the nine
months through September from 1.9 percent a year earlier,
according to the central bank.  “The key challenge for Ghana is to achieve a sustainable
growth path that does not destabilize the country’s external
fundamentals and  exchange-rate  dynamics,” Gadio said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
