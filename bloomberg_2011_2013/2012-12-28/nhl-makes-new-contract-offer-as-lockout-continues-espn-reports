The National Hockey League made a
new collective-bargaining offer to its players as the two sides
try to end the 104-day lockout and avoid canceling the season.  Deputy Commissioner Bill Daly said in a statement that the
league won’t discuss details of the proposal until the players’
association reviews the offer.  The package, which was presented yesterday, calls for
player contracts to be limited to six years, down from the eight
years the players sought, ESPN reported on its website, citing a
player it didn’t identify. The owners originally offered a five-
year ceiling.  “We are hopeful that once the union’s staff and
negotiating committee have had an opportunity to thoroughly
review and consider our new proposal, they will share it with
the players,” Daly said. “We want to be back on the ice as
soon as possible.”  Jonathan Weatherdon, a spokesman for the players’
association, didn’t immediately respond to an e-mail seeking
comment on Daly’s statement.  No formal bargaining sessions are scheduled. The sides last
met on Dec. 13 with no progress.  The league has canceled 625 games, or 51 percent of the
season, through Jan. 14. In 1994-95, an NHL lockout ended Jan.
11 and a 48-game schedule began on Jan. 20. A lockout wiped out
the 2004-05 season, the only time an entire schedule was lost to
a labor dispute in a major North American sports league.  The NHL has insisted that a 48-game schedule would be
required to avoid losing the whole season again.  The sides are arguing over how to split revenue and other
issues, including salary arbitration and the length of
unrestricted free agency. League revenue grew to $3.3 billion
last season, up 50 percent from $2.2 billion in 2003-04.  Under the previous agreement, players received 57 percent,
or $1.9 billion, of the income. The remaining $1.4 billion, or
43 percent, was shared among the league’s 30 team owners. The
league this time has offered a 50-50 split.  NHL players have been locked out since Sept. 16, the day
after the old contract expired.  To contact the reporter on this story:
