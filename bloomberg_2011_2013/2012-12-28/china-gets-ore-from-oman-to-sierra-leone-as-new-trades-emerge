China, buyer of 65 percent of the
world’s  iron ore  cargoes, expanded the destinations it got the
commodity from this year with the first reported spot shipments
from Oman, the Philippines and  Sierra Leone .  Fourteen Capesize vessels, the largest dry-bulk ships used
to transport iron ore, were hired on single-cargo charters to
China from the three countries in the first 51 weeks of 2012,
according to data from  Clarkson Plc (CKN) , the world’s largest
shipbroker, that go back to 2009.  Four were booked to carry a total of 720,000 metric tons of
ore from Subic Bay in the Philippines while the same number of
vessels shipped 660,000 tons from Pepel in Sierra Leone,
according to Clarkson. Six transported 890,0000 tons from Sohar,
Oman. All were hired to take cargoes to China, according to the
data, which don’t cover shipments under long-term charters.  Vale SA (VALE3) , the world’s largest iron-ore producer, started
operating a floating transshipment station at Subic Bay in
February that offloads the steelmaking commodity from its
largest vessels onto smaller ships. The Rio de Janeiro-based
miner also delivers ore to Sohar on its largest ore carriers.  China imported 674.6 million tons in the first 11 months of
2012, according to Customs  data  compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
