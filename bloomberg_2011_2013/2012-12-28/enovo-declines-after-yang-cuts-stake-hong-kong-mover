Lenovo Group Ltd. (992) , the world’s
biggest maker of personal computers, fell the most in more than
two months in  Hong Kong  trading after Chief Executive Officer
 Yang Yuanqing  cut his stake in the company.  Lenovo dropped as much as 2.9 percent, headed for the
biggest decline since Oct. 8.  The stock  fell 2.6 percent to
HK$7.12 as of the noon trading break on the Hong Kong exchange,
trimming its gains in the past six months to 9.7 percent.  Yang sold 29 million shares at an average price of HK$7.04
each Dec. 24, reducing his stake in the Beijing-based company to
9.04 percent from 9.32 percent, Lenovo said in a  filing  to the
Hong Kong stock exchange.  “The share price has gone up quite a bit in the past few
months, and Yang might be looking to pocket some gains,” Louis
Tse, a Hong Kong-based director of VC Brokerage Ltd., said by
phone today. Any action by Yang, who is also Lenovo’s chairman,
could be price-sensitive, he said.  Lenovo overtook  Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ)  as the biggest PC maker
in the third quarter, accounting for 15.7 percent of shipments,
according to Stamford, Connecticut-based Gartner Inc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
