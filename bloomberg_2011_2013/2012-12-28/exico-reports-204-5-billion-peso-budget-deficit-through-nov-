for next year with no deficit when investment in Petroleos
Mexicanos is excluded. This year’s approved deficit was 0.4
percent of gross domestic product. The spending portion of the
budget was published in the official gazette  yesterday .  The nation’s debt is forecast to reach 37.5 percent of
gross domestic product this year and is expected to decline to
37 percent next year,  Miguel Messmacher , the deputy finance
minister for revenue, said in a Dec. 7 interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
