Cattle futures rose on signs of
increasing demand for U.S. beef and shrinking animal supplies.
Hogs fell.  Beef-export sales were 23,722 metric tons (52.3 million
pounds) in the week ended Dec. 20, up 24 percent from the four-
week average, U.S. Department of Agriculture data showed today.
Yesterday, wholesale  beef  rose to the highest in almost two
weeks. Feedlots have fewer cattle available for sale, said  Lane Broadbent , a vice president at KIS Futures in  Oklahoma City .  “Our show-list size continues to get tighter,” Broadbent
said in a telephone interview. “After the first of the year,
beef demand usually shows back up again” because people have
been eating turkey and ham for the Thanksgiving and Christmas
holidays, he said.  Cattle futures for February delivery rose 0.2 percent to
$1.3335 a pound at 10:23 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange. Through yesterday, the price gained 9.6 percent this
year.  Feeder-cattle futures for March settlement climbed 0.4
percent to $1.543 a pound.  Hog futures for February settlement fell 0.1 percent to
86.9 cents a pound. Through yesterday, the price climbed 3.2
percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
