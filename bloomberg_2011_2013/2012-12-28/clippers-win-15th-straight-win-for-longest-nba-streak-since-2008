Reserve Matt Barnes scored 21 points
to lead the Los Angeles Clippers to a 106-77 win over the Boston
Celtics for their 15th straight victory, the longest National
Basketball Association streak since the 2008-09 season.  The Celtics won 19 games in a row four years ago.  Jamal Crawford came off the bench to score 17 points for
the Clippers,  Blake Griffin  had 15 points and  Caron Butler  added
14 on their home court last night. The Clippers last lost a game
against the New Orleans Hornets on Nov. 26.  “This is a new time for the organization and team,”
Clippers Coach Vinny Del Negro said. “We expect to win, but in
order to do that, we have to go out there and perform at a high
level, play the right way and play the way we’re capable of. If
we do that, good opportunities will present themselves.”  The Clippers improved their record to an NBA-best 23-6. The
Celtics fell to 14-14.  Kevin Garnett  scored 16 points and  Paul Pierce  and Courtney Lee each added 12 for the Celtics, who had 18 turnovers that the
Clippers converted to 26 points.  Also yesterday, the Oklahoma City Thunder snapped a two-
game losing skid with a 111-105 overtime victory against the
Dallas Mavericks.  Kevin Durant  finished with 40 points for the
Thunder, who are a half-game behind the Clippers at 22-6.  To contact the reporter on this story:
