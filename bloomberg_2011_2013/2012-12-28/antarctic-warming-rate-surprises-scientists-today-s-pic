The ice sheet covering West Antarctica has warmed twice as fast as expected -- 4.3 degrees Fahrenheit (2.4 degrees Celsius) since 1958, according to a  study  published this week in the journal  Nature Geoscience . That's three times the average rise in global temperatures of about  0.8 degrees Celsius  since the early 20th century.  Glaciers and rock outcrops in Marie Byrd Land, West Antarctica during an  IceBridge  flight on Oct. 17, 2011 from NASA’s DC-8 aircraft.
