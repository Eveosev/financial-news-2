Swaps prices fell for thermal coal
from  Indonesia , the world’s largest exporter of the fuel for
power stations, according to Ginga Petroleum Singapore Pte.  The swap for Indonesian sub-bituminous coal with a
calorific value of 4,900 kilocalories a kilogram in the first
quarter of 2013 dropped 30 cents to $63.70 a metric ton on a
net-as-received basis yesterday, Ginga said in an e-mail today.
The January contract declined 30 cents to $63.25.  Contracts for coal with a heating value of 5,500
kilocalories a kilogram for shipment to South  China  in the first
quarter fell 15 cents to $85.15 a ton on a net-as-received
basis, the energy broker said. The January contract was 15 cents
lower at $84.75 a ton.  A commodity swap is a financial agreement whereby a
floating price is exchanged for a fixed rate over a specified
contract period. About 60 percent of Indonesia’s coal is
classified as sub-bituminous. Higher moisture levels and a lower
carbon content reduce the heating value compared with better-
quality stock. Sub-bit coal has fewer than 6,100 kilocalories
per kilogram, according to the Indonesian energy ministry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
