Taiwan’s government bonds were
poised for a weekly drop, with benchmark 10-year yields rising
the most in almost five months, after the government announced
plans to boost issuance of the securities.  Sales will total NT$275 billion ($9.5 billion) in the
coming quarter, 22.2 percent more than in the same period of
2012, the Ministry of Finance said Dec. 22. The offerings will
include 15-year securities for the first time since 2005. The
Taiwan dollar strengthened 4.3 percent this year as overseas
investors boosted their holdings of the island’s stocks by $4.8
billion, according to exchange data.  “There’ll be more sales next quarter, and it’ll create
pressure on liquidity,” said  Albert Lee , a Taipei-based fixed-
income trader at Cathay United Bank Co. “Yields will probably
keep on rising in early 2013.”  The yield on the 1.125 percent bonds due September 2022
rose two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 1.169
percent this week, according to Gretai Securities Market. That’s
the biggest increase for benchmark 10-year bonds since the
period ended Aug. 3. The yield, which was little changed today,
fell 12 basis points in 2012 and Lee forecast it will climb to
1.2 percent by the end of March.  The Taiwan dollar strengthened 0.3 percent this week to
NT$29.036 against its U.S. counterpart as of 10:25 a.m. local
time, according to data from Taipei Forex Inc. It appreciated
0.3 percent today, having erased a gain of that magnitude in the
final minutes of trading yesterday on suspected intervention by
the central bank.  Intervention Mandate  The monetary authority has bought the greenback to counter
gains in the island’s currency on most days in the past eight
months, according to traders who asked not to be identified. The
central bank’s mandate is to keep relative exchange-rate
stability and to intervene in the event of abnormal moves,
Governor Perng Fai-Nan said on Dec. 19.  One-month implied volatility in the  Taiwan dollar , a
measure of expected moves in exchange rates used to price
options, climbed 26 basis points to 3.26 percent from the end of
last week. It was 6.3 percent at the start of the year.  The  overnight interbank lending  rate was 0.393 percent, up
from 0.389 percent at the end of last week, a weighted average
compiled by the Taiwan Interbank Money Center shows.  To contact the reporter on this story:
