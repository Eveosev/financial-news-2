Italian 10-year bonds erased a
decline, leaving the yield on the securities little changed at
4.52 percent as of 10:29 a.m. London time. The rate earlier
climbed as much as five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point,
to 4.58 percent.  Italy sold 3 billion euros of the 10-year securities at an
average yield of 4.48 percent today. That compares with a rate
of 4.45 percent at a previous auction on Nov. 29.  To contact the reporter on this story:
