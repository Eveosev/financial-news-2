(Corrects college reference in third paragraph of story
that moved yesterday.)  Peter Boockvar , the equity
strategist at Miller Tabak & Co., is leaving the trading firm
after 18 years to join Omega Advisors Inc., the $7 billion hedge
fund run by  Leon Cooperman  and Steve Einhorn.  His new role at Omega will be as a strategist and money
manager, New York-based Boockvar wrote in an e-mail today. Omega
invests mainly in U.S. stocks and has returned on average 13
percent annually since Cooperman founded it in 1991, Bloomberg
Markets reported in its August issue. Einhorn, vice chairman of
the firm, joined in 1999, according to the New York-based hedge
fund’s  website .  Boockvar, 43, also had a role as a sales trader on the
equity desk at  Miller Tabak . He previously worked in the
corporate bond research department at Donaldson, Lufkin &
Jenrette, the firm’s  website  shows. He graduated from George
Washington University.  To contact the reporter on this story:
