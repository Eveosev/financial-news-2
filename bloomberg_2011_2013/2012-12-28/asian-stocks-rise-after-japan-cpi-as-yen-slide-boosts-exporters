Asian  stocks  rose, with Japanese
shares posting their biggest annual advance since 2005, after a
report that the country’s consumer prices fell fanned
speculation the central bank will respond to government calls
for more asset purchases.  Canon Inc. (7751) , the world’s biggest camera maker, increased 2.1
percent, leading gains among Japanese exporters.  Toshiba (6502)  Corp.
climbed 5 percent after the manufacturer said it’s in talks to
sell a stake in its Westinghouse Electric atomic-power unit. BHP
Billiton Ltd., Australia’s largest oil producer, advanced 1.1
percent after crude and metal prices rose.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  climbed 0.6 percent to 129.59
as of 6:31 p.m. in Tokyo, heading for the highest close since
August 2011. Two shares climbed for each that fell. The
measure’s increase was limited by a further decline in the yen,
which reduced the value of the Japanese companies that account
for one-in-three of the Asia-Pacific gauge’s constituents.  “Central banks are going to keep  interest rates  low and
provide more stimulus that will keep equity markets propped up
as it has done this year,” said  Kumar Palghat , managing
director and founder of Kapstream Capital, which oversees at
least $5.2 billion. “There will be some resolution to the
fiscal cliff talks.”  The Asia-Pacific measure advanced 14 percent this year, the
biggest rise since 2010, as the U.S. and Chinese economies
showed signs of recovery and central banks around the world took
action to shore up growth.  Today was the final trading day of the year for Japanese
equity markets. The  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average gained 23 percent
this year, its biggest  yearly  gain since 2005. The measure,
which rose 0.7 percent today, closed yesterday at its highest
level since the day before 2011’s record earthquake triggered
the worst nuclear crisis in 25 years.  Subaru Surge  Exporters climbed. Canon gained 2.1 percent to 3,340 yen.
 Li & Fung Ltd. (494) , the maker of clothes and toys that gets more
than 80 percent of sales abroad, rose 0.5 percent to HK$13.52.  Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd., which makes Subaru branded
vehicles, climbed 1.7 percent to 1,076 yen, the highest close
since July 1989, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
company rose 131 percent this year and is the best-performing
Japanese stock in the MSCI Asia Pacific Index.  Core consumer prices in Japan fell 0.1 percent in November
from a year earlier, bolstering the case for Prime Minister
Shinzo Abe to push for further monetary easing.  Futures on the  S&P 500  gained 0.1 percent. Democrat and
Republican congressional leaders in the U.S. plan to meet with
President  Barack Obama  today as lawmakers seek to resolve an
impasse before at least $600 billion in spending cuts and tax
gains begin in January. House Republican leaders also announced
the chamber will meet on Dec. 30.  Last Day  Today is the final trading day of the year in  South Korea ,
 Taiwan ,  Indonesia ,  Thailand ,  Vietnam  and the Philippines.
Thailand’s SET Index has surged 36 percent this year, the
biggest advance by any Asian benchmark gauge after Pakistan’s
Karachi 100 Index.  Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index gained 0.2 percent today,
extending this year’s advance to 23 percent. The city’s exchange
will be open for a half day of trading Jan. 31.  China’s Shanghai Composite rose 1.2 percent today and has
climbed 1.5 percent in 2012. South Korea’s Kospi gained 0.5
percent, extending this year’s increase to 9.4 percent.
Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index added 0.5 percent today and surged
15 percent this year.  Toshiba climbed 5 percent to 337 yen after a spokesman for
the Tokyo-based company said it’s in discussions with three
parties on a possible sale of as much as 16 percent in the
Westinghouse nuclear construction business.  Tepco Lawsuit  Tokyo Electric Power Co. slumped 6.4 percent to 206 yen as
the owner of the power plant which had the world’s biggest
 nuclear disaster  since 1986 was sued by eight U.S. sailors
claiming they were exposed to radiation and the utility lied
about the dangers. “We can’t comment as we have not received
the complaint document yet,” Yusuke Kunikage, a Tepco
spokesman, said by phone yesterday.  PT Bumi Resources slumped 73 percent in 2012 in Jakarta,
the biggest slide among companies on Asia’s benchmark stocks
index. Bumi is at the center of a dispute between its founders
 Nathaniel Rothschild  and Indonesia’s Bakrie Group amid ongoing
investigations in London and Indonesia into possible financial
anomalies.  Sharp Corp. (6753)  tumbled 55 percent this year as the TV maker
warned last month about its ability to survive amid competition
from overseas rivals. Japan’s largest liquid-crystal-display
maker is selling as much as 9.9 billion yen ($121 million)
selling shares to Qualcomm Inc. in a bid to restore its balance
sheet.  United Spirits Ltd. posted the largest gains among Asian
