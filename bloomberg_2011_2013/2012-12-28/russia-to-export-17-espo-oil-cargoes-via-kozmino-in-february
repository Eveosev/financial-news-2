Russia  plans to ship 17 cargoes of
East Siberia-Pacific Ocean crude, or ESPO, from the Pacific port
of Kozmino in February, according to a final loading program
obtained by  Bloomberg News .  Kozmino, in the country’s  Far East , will load 1.7 million
metric tons of ESPO blend in 100,000 ton lots, or 401,968
barrels a day, one cargo less than planned for January. Two of
the cargoes will be transported to the port via railroad tankers
and the remainder through the second phase of the ESPO pipeline,
which opened Dec. 25.  The ESPO pipeline, Russia’s most expensive infrastructure
project, starts at fields in east Siberia and in the second
phase was extended to Kozmino from Skovorodino near the Chinese
border.  The February program also includes one 100,000 ton rail
cargo for loading at Kozmino Feb. 27 to March 2.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
