Fluxys (FLUX)  SA, a Belgian natural-gas
pipeline operator, agreed to acquire a 32 percent stake in the
Medgaz link from Spain’s  Iberdrola SA (IBE)  and  Endesa SA (ELE) , expanding
its access to supplies from North Africa.  Fluxys will buy 20 percent from Iberdrola and 12 percent
from Endesa for about 233 million euros ($308 million), the
Brussels-based company said today in a statement. The deal is
dependent on Medgaz shareholders not executing their right to
purchase the stake.  Fluxys has a pipeline network stretching more than 4,100
kilometers (2,500 miles), bringing gas to consumers in Belgium
as well as transporting fuel across borders to other markets.
The Medgaz stake gives it access to a 210-kilometer link running
from  Algeria  to Spain, which can transport 8 billion cubic
meters of gas a year.  “The pipeline is a strategically important link for
bringing Algerian gas to Europe and it will further gain
significance once the interconnection between the Spanish and
French markets has become stronger,” Fluxys said. The company
expects the transaction to close in the first half of 2013.  Iberdrola, Spain’s largest utility, is selling assets to
reduce debt and bolster profit. It has disposed of about 500
million euros of assets this year, it said today, as part of a
plan to divest 2 billion euros’ worth by the end of 2014.  The Medgaz deal price includes a 16 million-euro loan to
the pipeline venture from Iberdrola, the Bilbao-based company
said in a  statement .  Fluxys Belgium, a unit of Fluxys, rose 2.6 percent to 32.75
euros as of 3:46 p.m. in Brussels. Iberdrola dropped 2.1 percent
to 4.112 euros in  Madrid . Endesa fell 1.5 percent to 16.88
euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
