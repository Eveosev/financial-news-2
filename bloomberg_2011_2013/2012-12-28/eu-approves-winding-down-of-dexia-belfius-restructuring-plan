Belfius Bank NV (CCBG) , nationalized by the
Belgian government, will be able to refocus on its core banking
and insurance businesses as part of a restructuring plan
approved by European Union regulators that will wind down most
of  Dexia SA. (DEXB)   The European Commission approved the “orderly resolution”
of the Dexia group, the sale of its subsidiary Dexia Municipal
Agency and the restructuring of Belfius, according to a
statement by the EU regulator in Brussels today. Dexia
shareholders last week voted to continue the company’s
activities, approving a 5.5 billion-euro ($7.25 billion)  capital
increase  by the Belgian and French governments and avoiding a
default on 386.5 billion euros of debt.  Belgium  in 2011 bought
the local consumer-banking unit, now called Belfius.  The EU approval allows Dexia to receive state guarantees of
85 billion euros and the recapitalization from  France  and
Belgium. The bank, whose shares have lost almost all their
value, reported a  loss  for the third quarter of 1.23 billion
euros.  “The plan will allow the orderly resolution of the
group,” EU Competition Commissioner  Joaquin Almunia  said in the
statement. “The approved plan ensures that the continued market
presence of  some parts  of the Dexia group is truly justified,
without artificially keeping alive a failed  business model , and
that competition distortions resulting from the aid received are
minimized.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
