U.S. political wrangling over
averting the so-called fiscal cliff is unlikely to influence
Standard & Poor’s AA+ credit rating on the nation.  “We believe that this characterization still holds,”  the
New York-based unit of McGraw-Hill Cos. said today in a
statement. S&P has a negative outlook of the U.S. rating, as do
Moody’s Investors Service and Fitch Ratings, which assign the
nation their top grades.  S&P stripped the U.S. of its AAA grade on Aug. 5, 2011,
citing the government’s lack of a plan to rein in its debt load
and weakening “effectiveness, stability, and predictability of
American policy making and political institutions.”  President  Barack Obama  is meeting today at the White House
with congressional leaders as they seek to avoid tax and
spending changes that could trigger a recession in 2013.  Failure to reach an agreement would trigger fiscal
consolidation that would be “vulnerable to reversal,” S&P
said. An agreement this weekend will likely signal “that the
tax cuts of 2001 and 2003 are extended for some period and
additional measures are insufficient to place the U.S. medium-
term public finances on a sustainable footing.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
