Netflix Inc. (NFLX) , the world’s largest
video-subscription service, doubled the annual compensation of
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  Reed Hastings  to $4
million.  Hastings, 52, will receive $2 million in salary in 2013,
along with $2 million in  stock options , according to a
regulatory  filing  today by the Los Gatos, California-based
company. The executive received a $500,000 salary this year and
$1.5 million in option allowances, a reduction in stock
compensation from 2011.  Netflix has risen 29 percent in 2012, with one trading day
left in the year. The shares peaked at $298.73 in July 2011
before sliding on investor concern over looming competition, a
series of marketing missteps, losses overseas and fewer than
expected new subscribers this year. The service suffered a
disruption on Christmas Eve.  Third-quarter net income fell 88 percent to $7.68 million,
or 13 cents a share, from $62.5 million, or $1.16, a year
earlier, as the company bore costs to pursue expansion outside
the U.S., according to an October report. Analysts had forecast
profit of 5 cents, the average of 29 estimates.  Sales rose 10 percent to $905.1 million from a year
earlier, beating the $904.9 million average of 29 estimates.  Netflix fell 1.3 percent to $89.33 at the close in New
York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
