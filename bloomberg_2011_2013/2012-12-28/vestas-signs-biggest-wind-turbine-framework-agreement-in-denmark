Vestas Wind Systems A/S (VWS) , the largest
maker of  wind turbines , signed its biggest framework agreement
to supply onshore machines in its home market of  Denmark .  The first 17 megawatts of the 184-megawatt, three-year deal
are “firm and unconditional” and will be delivered next year,
the Aarhus-based company said today in a  statement . It didn’t
name the “long-term” Danish customer or give financial terms.  The accord includes “long-term service agreements” that
will secure jobs in the country’s wind industry, Klaus Steen
Mortensen, president of Vestas Northern  Europe , said in the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
