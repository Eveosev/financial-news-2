than 5 percent after the regulator said it will ease bond
financing for securities firms. Kweichow Moutai Co. and SAIC
Motor Corp. led gains for consumer staples and discretionary
companies after the  China  Securities Journal reported the
government may introduce measures to boost consumption in areas
such as autos, household electronics and solar.  “We’ll see more policies aimed at boosting consumption
next year and that’ll help  China’s economy  sustain its growth,”
said Wu Kan, a Shanghai-based  fund manager  at Dazhong Insurance
Co., which oversees $285 million. “With the economy
stabilizing, the uptrend for stocks is quite firm.”  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  rose 1.2 percent to 2,233.25

have relaxed rules for subdebt issued by brokerages, such as
broadening the range of investors allowed to subscribe to their
sub-debt,” He Zongyan, an analyst at Shenyin & Wanguo
Securities Co., said by telephone in Shanghai. “This signals
that regulators are ready to introduce more measures in the
future to enable the transformation of brokerages from
traditional stockbroking to capital intermediaries.”  Government Support  The Shanghai Composite this week erased this year’s loss of
