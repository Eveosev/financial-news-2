Temasek Holdings Pte,  Singapore ’s
state-owned investment company, boosted its stake in  Olam
International Ltd. (OLAM)  by another percentage point in the past week
after saying the commodity trader is an attractive long-term
investment.  Two units controlled by Temasek bought around 24 million
shares between Dec. 20 and today, lifting its deemed interest to
19 percent from 18 percent, according to an Olam filing. One
purchase of 100,000 shares was made on the market today, the
filing said.  Temasek, Olam’s second-biggest shareholder, last week
raised its stake from 16 percent to 18 percent, saying that it’s
“pleased” to have the opportunity to add to its holdings. Olam
“represents a reasonably attractive investment over the long
term,” it said. Temasek earlier this month backed Olam’s
proposed bond offering, agreeing to buy any rights not taken up
by other investors.  Temasek referred to its earlier comments on Olam in an e-
mailed response to queries today.  Jim Rogers , chairman of Rogers Holdings, plans to take part
in the offering, according to a report today in The Straits
Times newspaper. Rogers’s stake in Olam is “quite small,” the
report said. Rogers didn’t respond to an e-mail seeking comment.  Shares in Olam rose as much as 2.6 percent before trading
1.3 percent higher at S$1.545 as of 1:27 p.m. in Singapore. They
have slumped 11 percent since Nov. 19, the day short-seller
 Carson Block  questioned the company’s liquidity and accounting
practices at a London conference.  Kewlram Singapore Ltd., which owns 20 percent of Olam as
its  biggest shareholder , also said it will support the offering
of $750 million in bonds and as much as $500 million in
warrants.  To contact the reporter on this story:
