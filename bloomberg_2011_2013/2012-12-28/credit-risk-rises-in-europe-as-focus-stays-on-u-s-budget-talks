Credit risk rose in  Europe  as U.S.
lawmakers arranged to meet as they seek to avoid more than $600
billion in spending cuts and tax gains that will start in
January.  The Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of credit-default swaps
on 50 mostly junk-rated companies increased 13.5 basis points to
478 basis points at 1:43 p.m. in  London . The gauge tumbled 275
basis points since the end of 2011 and is headed for the best
year since 2009.  President  Barack Obama  meets congressional leaders today to
discuss the country’s budget plans before a year-end deadline.
Lawmakers gave little sign they intend to act together,
disputing which party would be responsible for missing the
deadline.  “Markets are not holding their breath,” Ishaq Siddiqi, a
London-based market strategist at ETX Capital, said in a note to
clients. There are “ongoing concerns that the  U.S. economy  is
now firmly on course to go over the fiscal cliff,” he wrote.  The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of credit-default swaps on
125 investment-grade companies increased three basis points to
117. The gauge tightened 56 basis points this year, the first
decline in three years.  The Markit iTraxx Financial Index of credit-default swaps
on the senior debt of banks and insurers rose three basis points
to 142. The gauge fell 18.5 basis points this month and 136.5
this year, the biggest decline since 2005 when data first
started being collected.  A basis point on a credit-default swap contract protecting
10 million euros ($13.2 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
