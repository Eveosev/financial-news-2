Italy’s five-year notes dropped,
pushing yields to the highest level in more than a week, as
borrowing costs increased at a sale of 5.9 billion euros ($7.8
billion) of government debt maturing in 2017 and 2022.  Ten-year bonds posted a  weekly loss  as the nation is due to
hold elections in February, with Prime Minister  Mario Monti 
saying he won’t run. German 10-year bund yields fell to a two-
week low amid speculation U.S. lawmakers will fail to reach an
agreement on averting $600 billion of tax increases and spending
cuts taking effect in January, boosting demand for euro-region’s
safest assets.  “We see a risk of underperformance in the new year with
supply and going into the elections,” said  Christoph Rieger ,
head of fixed-rate strategy at Commerzbank AG in  Frankfurt .
German bunds “will be supported with  risk aversion  still high
and with supply pressures in the periphery,” he said, referring
to the euro-area’s higher-yielding government-bond markets.  Italy’s five-year yield rose six basis points, or 0.06
percentage point, to 3.30 percent at 4:47 p.m.  London  time,
after climbing to 3.35 percent, the highest since Dec. 18. The
3.5 percent note maturing in November 2017 fell 0.25, or 2.50
euros per 1,000-euro face amount, to 100.99.  The yield on the nation’s 10-year bond dropped three basis
points to 4.50 percent, after rising to 4.58 percent, also the
most since Dec. 18. The rate has increased three basis points
this week.  Rally Stalls  A rally in Italian bonds this year that pushed the 10-year
yield to as low as 4.35 percent on Dec. 19 from a 2012 high of
7.18 percent on Jan. 6, is stalling ahead of elections in
February. Monti, who has overseen austerity measures and
declines in bond yields since taking office in November 2011,
said on Dec. 23 he would consider being the candidate for a
party backing his economic agenda.  “Once the elections are out of the way and any accidents
are averted,” yields could go lower again, Commerzbank’s Rieger
said, without providing forecasts.  Italy sold 2.87 billion euros of notes due in November 2017
at an average yield of 3.26 percent, compared with 3.23 percent
at a Nov. 29 auction. The Rome-based Treasury also allotted 3
billion euros of 10-year bonds at 4.48 percent. That’s up from
4.45 percent the last time the securities were sold on Nov. 29,
 Bank of Italy  data showed.  German 10-year yields fell one basis point to 1.30 percent,
after dropping to 1.29 percent, the lowest since Dec. 11. U.S.
Treasuries advanced for a third day, with the 10-year note yield
sliding three basis points to 1.71 percent.  Obama Meeting  U.S. congressional leaders plan to meet with President
 Barack Obama  today and  House Republicans  said they will convene
Dec. 30. The president returned early from his holiday in  Hawaii 
yesterday as lawmakers disputed which party would be responsible
for missing the deadline for a debt deal, a failure that could
hurt the U.S. credit rating and cause an economic recession. The
meeting will be held at 3 p.m. Washington time.  German bunds may underperform Treasuries “on the margin”
if there’s no deal to avert the fiscal cliff, as the  budget
crisis  is more a U.S. story, Abhishek Singhania, a strategist at
Deutsche Bank AG in London, said in an interview, forecasting
that the  extra yield  investors get for holding Treasuries
instead of bunds may fall to 35 basis points.  Ten-year bunds yielded 40 basis points less than similar-
maturity Treasuries today, compared with three basis points more
on Feb. 2, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  French Bonds  France ’s bonds declined as data showed the economy grew
less than originally estimated in the third quarter. Ten-year
yields rose two basis points to 1.99 percent.  France’s  gross domestic product  expanded 0.1 percent in the
three months through September, compared with an initial
estimate of a 0.2 percent increase, the state statistical
institute Insee said. The economy shrank 0.1 percent in the
second quarter, Insee said, unchanged from the previous
estimate.  German bonds returned 4.4 percent this year through
yesterday, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. Italian
bonds earned 21 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
