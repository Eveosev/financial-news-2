German power for 2014 fell to a
record as mild weather and weak holiday-season demand resulted
in negative short-term prices, pushing down longer contracts.
The 2013 contract gained before its Dec. 31 expiration.  The benchmark year-ahead baseload contract rose 15 cents to
44.15 euros ($58.38) a megawatt-hour, broker data compiled by
Bloomberg show. The more-actively traded  contract for 2014  fell
0.4 percent to 45.40 euros as of 5:20 p.m. Berlin time, a record
for the 2014 contract and the lowest price for the second-year
contract since March 2009. Baseload power is delivered around
the clock.  Prices for power to be delivered Dec. 31 fell as low as
minus 18 euros a megawatt-hour, as above-average temperatures
and high generation from wind turbines curbed demand for power
from plants fired by fossil-fuels.  In  Frankfurt , the maximum temperature for Sunday is
forecast at 7 degrees Celsius (45 Fahrenheit), compared with the
10-year seasonal average of 1 degree. Wind output in  Germany  is
predicted to rise to more than 15 gigawatts in the next two days
from less than 5 gigawatts today, according to the website of
 Meteologica SA , a Madrid-based weather forecaster.  Some generators have taken their thermal units offline to
account for the priority access of wind power granted by the
German government. Others have left theirs running as older
units incur costs when they are switched off and it’s cheaper to
accept negative prices for several hours or even days than to
shut down plants.  In  France , prices for Dec. 31  peakload power , to be
delivered from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m., dropped to a record. The price
slid as much as 42 percent to 9 euros a megawatt-hour, the
lowest since Bloomberg started compiling broker data in
September 2007.  Nordic power for 2014 delivery fell as much as 0.3 percent
to 37.50 euros a megawatt-hour while the first-quarter 2013
contract gained 0.9 percent to 40.35 euros as of 5:20 p.m. local
time on Nasdaq OMX Group Inc.’s energy exchange in Oslo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
