Hungaryâ€™s  current-account  surplus
widened more than estimated in the third quarter.  The surplus was 780 million euros ($1 billion), compared
with a revised 478 million euro surplus in the second quarter
and a surplus of 328 million euros a year earlier, the central
bank in Budapest said in an e-mailed statement. The median
 projection  in a Bloomberg survey of four economists was for a
628 million-euro surplus.  The seasonally adjusted current-account surplus was 616
million euros, the Magyar Nemzeti Bank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
