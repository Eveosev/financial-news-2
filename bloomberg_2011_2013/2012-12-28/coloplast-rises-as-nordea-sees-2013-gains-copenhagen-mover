Coloplast A/S (COLOB)  rose in Copenhagen
trading after Nordea Bank AB forecast further gains for the
stock in 2013.  The world’s largest maker of ostomy and urology products
 rose  as much as 0.7 percent to 278.80 kroner, with trading
volume at 6 percent of the three-month daily average as of 10:23
a.m. in the Danish capital.  “Coloplast’s increased focus on emerging markets will
boost sales, while further cost improvements will ensure that
profits rise even faster,” Mikkel Petersen, an analyst at
Nordea, said in a note. Nordea has a buy rating and a 12-month
price target of 282 kroner.  Coloplast has gained 68 percent this year, beating the 28
percent increase in the  OMX Copenhagen 20 (KFX)  index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
