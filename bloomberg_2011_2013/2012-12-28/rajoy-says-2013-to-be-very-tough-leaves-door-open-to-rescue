Spanish Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy 
said 2013 will be “very tough” amid the sixth year of an
 economic  slump. He refused to exclude seeking a bailout for the
euro area’s fourth-largest economy.  “We still have ahead of us a very tough year, especially
the first half, and we have to persevere with reforms,” Rajoy
told a press conference today called to mark his first year in
office. As of today, Spain doesn’t plan to ask for aid, though
the “very useful” instrument remains available, he said.  Rajoy told Spaniards to brace for a difficult year as
 unemployment  exceeds 26 percent and the Bank of Spain estimates
the economy contracted for a sixth quarter in the last three
months of the year. Measures to overhaul the economy, including
changes to pension rules, and budget discipline will remain the
priorities next year, he said, even as the European Commission
has eased pressure on the government to meet budget targets.  Rajoy declined to estimate where the deficit will end the
year, compared with a target of 7.4 percent of gross domestic
product that includes the costs of bailing out banks. The
deficit was 9.4 percent of GDP last year. The EU isn’t seeking
more cuts from  Spain  until 2014, by which time the recovery
should be bolstering revenue, he said.  “A gigantic effort has been made,” Rajoy said. “Never
has so much been asked of a country that’s in a recession and
with the financing problems there are now.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
