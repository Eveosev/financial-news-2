China ’s ruling Communist Party, in
its official newspaper, called on  Japan  to not “play tricks”
with history after comments by a Japanese official cast doubt on
whether newly elected Prime Minister Shinzo Abe would uphold a
1993 apology to women forced into sex slavery in World War II.  Any “muddling or distortion” of Japan’s wartime
atrocities will hurt the victims of its past militarism and give
Asian nations reason to be highly wary of the new government, a
commentary published in today’s People’s Daily newspaper said.
The article’s author was identified as Zhong Sheng, whose name
sounds in Chinese like “voice of China” and for whom no
personal details were given.  Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said
yesterday the apology needed to be reviewed by experts and
historians before Abe’s administration supported it. The
comments add to tensions arising from a dispute over control of
islands in the  East China Sea  that’s strained relations between
 Asia ’s biggest economies and led Japan to dispatch fighter jets
in response to Chinese planes sent to “patrol” the islands.  The People’s Daily commentary, which noted Suga’s comments,
said Japan would “never receive the forgiveness and respect of
Asian countries” if it held the “wrong attitude toward
history.”  Abe, who won a second term as prime minister this month,
said in March 2007 during his earlier stint in office that there
was “no evidence” Japan’s military forced women into
prostitution during its occupation of Asia in World War II. That
statement brought protests from  South Korea  and clashed with a
1993 study by Japan’s Cabinet Office that said women “were
recruited against their own will.”  Then-Chief Cabinet Secretary Yohei Kono said in a statement
at the time that the government offered “its sincere apologies
and remorse.”  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
