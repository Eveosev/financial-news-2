The euro-area recession probably
eased for a second month in December as executives were more
optimistic about an economic recovery and turmoil in financial
markets subsided, the Eurocoin index showed.  The gauge measuring economic activity in the 17-nation
region rose to minus 0.27, the highest since July, from minus
0.29 in November, the London-based Center for Economic Policy
Research and the Bank of  Italy , which co-produce the index, said
in an e-mailed report.  The indicator, which includes price developments, stock-
market performance, industrial production and business and
 consumer confidence  readings, seeks to provide a real-time
estimate of economic growth. The next update will be published
on Jan. 25.  To contact the reporter on this story:
