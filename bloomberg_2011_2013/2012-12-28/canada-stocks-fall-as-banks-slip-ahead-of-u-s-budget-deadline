Canadian  stocks  fell as U.S.
President  Barack Obama  summoned congressional leaders to a White
House meeting three days before a deadline to avoid the so-
called fiscal cliff.  Bank of Nova Scotia retreated 0.4 percent and Manulife
Financial Corp., the nation’s largest insurer, slipped 0.7
percent. Silvercorp Metals Inc. lost 1.2 percent as the price of
the metal headed for a fifth straight weekly decline.  The Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index dropped 37.41
points, or 0.3 percent, to 12,336.36 at 10:30 a.m. in Toronto.
The equity gauge has gained 3.2 percent this year, trailing
markets in every developed nation in the world except Portugal
and Spain.  Obama, who had been negotiating one-on-one with House
Speaker  John Boehner , will meet today with Republicans Boehner
and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, and Senate Majority
Leader  Harry Reid  and House Minority Leader  Nancy Pelosi , both
Democrats. The meeting will be held at 3 p.m. Washington time.  U.S. lawmakers are seeking to avoid more than $600 billion
in spending cuts and tax increases that are just days away from
taking effect. Failure to avert the fiscal cliff will probably
send the U.S. into a recession in the first half of the year,
according to the Congressional Budget Office.  To contact the reporter on this story:
