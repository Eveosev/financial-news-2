Japan’s Finance Minister Taro Aso
said the  Bank of Japan (8301) ’s next governor should be someone with
managerial experience and that an academic isn’t appropriate for
the position.  “They don’t have experience managing organizations,” Aso
said in response to a question on whether the next governor
should have an academic background. The BOJ’s next leader should
“know how to manage an organization and language skills are
desirable.”  Officials from Aso’s  Liberal Democratic Party  have
criticized BOJ Governor Masaaki Shirakawa for failing to reverse
more than a decade of deflation. Shirakawa’s five-year term ends
on April 8, while his deputies Hirohide Yamaguchi and Kiyohiko Nishimura exit in March.  The government plans to map out its plans for fiscal
stimulus and an extra budget by around the middle of January,
before the BOJ’s next meeting, Aso said today.  Shirakawa got his master’s degree in economics in 1977 at
the  University of Chicago . Shirakawa served for 34 years at the
BOJ before leaving in 2006 to teach at  Kyoto University . He
returned to the central bank as governor in 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
