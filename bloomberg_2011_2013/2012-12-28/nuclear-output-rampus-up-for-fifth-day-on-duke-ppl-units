Nuclear-power production gained for
a  fifth day  in the U.S., led by boosts at  PPL Corp. (PPL)  and  Duke
Energy Corp. (DUK)  reactors in  Pennsylvania  and South Carolina.  Total production gained 0.5 percent to 91,492 megawatts, or
90 percent of capacity, the  highest level  since Sept. 14,
according to U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission data compiled by
Bloomberg. Output was  3.8 percent  less than a year ago with nine
of 104 reactor offline.  PPL’s Susquehanna 2, which can generate 1,140 megawatts,
operated at 15 percent of capacity compared with 1 percent
yesterday. The unit began supplying electricity to the grid
today for the first time since it automatically shut Dec. 16
during a turbine valve test, according to a company statement.  “An unrelated issue with the positioning of a valve in one
of the unit’s main water pumps during startup activities
extended the out-of-service time,” PPL said. Susquehanna is
about 50 miles (80 kilometers) northwest of Allentown.  The 1,129-megawatt Catawba 1 reactor owned by Duke returned
to service today after completing a refueling outage that began
in late November, Mary Kathryn Green, a company spokeswoman
based at the plant, said in an e-mail. The unit is about 17
miles southwest of  Charlotte ,  North Carolina .  Southeast Output  Output in the NRC’s  Southeastern region , from Florida to
Virginia, gained 1 percent to 27,837 megawatts, the biggest
increase in the U.S. The  Tennessee Valley Authority ’s 1,104-
megawatt Browns Ferry 2 reactor contributed to the advance as it
operated at 89 percent of capacity, up from 78 percent
yesterday.  Generation increased by 0.7 percent to 23,930 megawatts in
the commission’s Northeastern region covering Maryland to  Maine .
That’s 4.1 percent higher than the  same day  a year ago as all
reactors in the region were operating, according to NRC data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Reactor maintenance shutdowns, usually undertaken in the
U.S. spring or fall when energy use is lowest, may increase
consumption of natural gas and coal to generate electricity. The
average refueling down time was 43 days in 2011, according to
the  Nuclear Energy Institute .  To contact the reporter on this story:
