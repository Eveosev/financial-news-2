(Correct decline in oil rigs in third paragraph.)  Oil rigs in the U.S. dropped for the
sixth week in a row, paring a 10th straight annual gain.  Oil rigs fell by 13 to 1,327 the week, data posted on  Baker
Hughes Inc. (BHI) â€™s website show. For the year, oil rigs rose 11
percent. The number of oil rigs has risen every year since 2002,
when there were 136.  The decline capped the second consecutive quarterly drop,
according to data from the Houston oilfield-services company. In
the fourth quarter, oil rigs fell by 83.  The  total rig count  fell a fifth straight week, by 11 to
1,763. Gas rigs rose by two to 431.  The natural gas rig count has shrunk to less than a third
of its peak in August 2008 because of a switch from dry gas to
more profitable crude and natural gas liquids drilling.  To contact the reporter on this story:
