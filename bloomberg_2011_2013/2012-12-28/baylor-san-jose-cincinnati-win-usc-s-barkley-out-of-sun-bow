Glasco Martin rushed for 98 yards
and three touchdowns as Baylor University upset No. 17
University of California at Los Angeles 49-26 in college
football’s Holiday Bowl.  No. 24  San Jose  State defeated Bowling Green State 29-20 in
yesterday’s Military Bowl, and the University of Cincinnati beat
Duke University 48-34 in the Belk Bowl.  University of Southern California quarterback Matt Barkley,
projected as one of the top picks in the 2013 National Football
League draft, had his college career ended prematurely with a
sore right shoulder. After missing USC’s regular-season finale
against  Notre Dame , he’ll also be absent from the Sun Bowl
against Georgia Tech on Dec. 31.  “It’s a tough day,” Barkley said yesterday. “I’ve worked
as hard as I could to get back for this game, but nature’s not
allowing it and the doctors aren’t allowing it, which is the
most important thing.”  Max Wittek will start in place of Barkley, who hurt his
shoulder against UCLA, said coach  Lane Kiffin .  “I’m at peace,” said Barkley, adding that he’s looking
ahead to April’s NFL draft. “I do have peace and I know that
whatever the case is right now, I can make it into a great case
come April, which is what my goal is now.”  Barkley’s Records  Barkley owns 20 school records and 10 Pac-12 marks. He’s
the Pac-12’s leader in total offense (12,214), yards passing
(12,327), completions (1,001), touchdown passes (116) and
combined rushing and passing touchdowns (122). He’s also the
only player in league history to have 2,500 yards or more of
total offense four times.  At Qualcomm Stadium in  San Diego , Baylor jumped out to a
21-0 lead on Martin’s four-yard touchdown run followed by back-
to-back touchdown passes by Nick Florence. Martin then ran 26
yards for a touchdown and Lache Seastrunk rushed 43 yards as the
Bears took a 35-10 halftime lead.  Martin and Florence each added one-yard touchdown runs in
the second half for Baylor. Florence completed 10 of 13 passing
attempts for 188 yards and two touchdowns for the Bears (8-5).  Brett Hundley connected on 26 of 50 passing attempts for
329 yards and three touchdowns, including one on the game’s
final play, for the Bruins (9-5).  Spartans Win  At RFK Memorial Stadium in  Washington , Dale Fales completed
33 of 43 passing attempts for 395 yards and two touchdowns to
lead the Spartans (11-2) to the win.  Fales connected with Kyle Nunn on a 33-yard scoring pass in
the first quarter and hooked up with Chandler Jones on an 18-
yard touchdown pass in the third quarter. Austin Lopez kicked
two field goals, De’Leon Eskridge ran one yard for a score and
San Jose State added a safety on a blocked punt.  Tyler Tate kicked two field goals in the first half for the
Falcons (8-5), while Anthon Samuel and John Pettigrew added
rushing touchdowns in the second half.  At Bank of America Stadium in  Charlotte ,  North Carolina ,
Brendon Kay passed for 332 yards and four touchdowns as
Cincinnati rallied from a 13-point first-quarter deficit to beat
Duke. The Bearcats scored two touchdowns in the final 44 seconds
to snap a 34-34 tie.  Trailing 16-3 at the end of the first quarter, Kay passed
for two touchdowns in the second quarter to give Cincinnati a
17-16 halftime advantage.  Tony Miliano’s field goal and George Winn’s 46-yard
touchdown run extended Cincinnati’s lead to 27-16 before Duke
recaptured the lead, 31-27, on Sean Renfree’s 10-yard scoring
pass to Conner Vernon and Brandon Connette’s two-yard touchdown
throw to David Reeves.  Kay completed a 25-yard pass to Chris Moore and an 83-
yarder to Travis Kelce in the fourth quarter for a 41-34 lead
with 44 seconds left. Cincinnati clinched the win as Nick Temple
scored on a 55-yard interception return of Renfree with 14
seconds remaining.  To contact the reporter on this story:
