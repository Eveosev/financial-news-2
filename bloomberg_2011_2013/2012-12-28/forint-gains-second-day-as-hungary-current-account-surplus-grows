The forint gained for a second day
after data showed  Hungary ’s current-account surplus widened more
than analysts expected and as demand for riskier assets
increased.  The currency appreciated 0.4 percent to 290.71 per euro by
3:49 p.m. in Budapest. The forint gained 8 percent this year,
the second-best performance among more than 100 currencies
tracked by Bloomberg. Poland’s zloty has rallied 9.5 percent.
Yields on Hungary’s 10-year government bonds fell two basis
points to 6.16 percent today, matching the lowest since October
2005.  The current account surplus was 780 million euros ($1
billion), compared with 328 million euros a year earlier, the
central bank in Budapest said in an e-mailed statement today.
The median projection in a Bloomberg survey of four economists
was for a 628 million-euro surplus. Emerging-market stocks
headed for the highest close since April as U.S. lawmakers
arranged meetings before a budget deadline and on speculation
 China  will take steps to boost domestic consumption.  “Fundamentally, the strong external balance position could
be supportive for the forint  exchange rate ,” Orsolya Nyeste, a
Budapest-based economist at Erste Group Bank AG, wrote in a
research report on the current-account release.  The positive effect on the currency from the surplus will
probably be weakened by the Magyar Nemzeti Bank’s easing cycle,
Nyeste added. Policy makers have cut the  benchmark rate  by 1.25
percentage points since August to 5.75 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
