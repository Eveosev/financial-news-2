Fed funds, the U.S. overnight inter-
bank lending  rate , opened at 0.18 percent, within the Federal
Reserve’s target of zero to 0.25 percent.  Fed funds closed at 0.28 percent yesterday after trading
from 0.01 percent to 0.28 percent and averaging 0.16 percent,
according to ICAP Plc, the world’s largest inter-dealer broker.  The central bank will acquire Treasuries maturing from
February 2021 to November 2022. The purchases are part of the
Fed’s program to replace short-term debt in its portfolio with
longer-term Treasuries in an effort to keep borrowing costs low.  The central bank plans to purchase from $4.25 billion to
$5.25 billion of securities today, according to the New York
Fed’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
