Portugal ’s  budget deficit  narrowed
to 5.6 percent of gross domestic product in the nine months
through the third quarter, the statistics institute said.  That compares with a deficit of 6.7 percent in the same
period of 2011, the Lisbon-based National Statistics Institute
said today in an e-mailed statement.  Portugal, which received an international bailout last
year, has already been given more time by its creditors to
narrow its budget deficit after  tax revenue  missed forecasts and
the economy heads for a third year of contraction in 2013. The
government projects GDP will fall 1 percent next year after a
contraction of 3 percent this year.  The government aims to reach a deficit of 5 percent in 2012
instead of the previous goal of 4.5 percent, Finance Minister
Vitor Gaspar said on Sept. 11 after European Union and
International Monetary Fund officials agreed on the targets. It
aims for a deficit of 4.5 percent in 2013 rather than 3 percent.
It will only cut the deficit below the EU’s 3 percent limit in
2014, when it targets a 2.5 percent gap.  The government last year narrowed the budget gap to 4.4
percent following the transfer of banks’ pension funds to the
state.  To contact the reporter on this story:
