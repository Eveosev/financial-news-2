India ’s rupee and South Korea’s won
led gains in Asian currencies this week as global money managers
boosted holdings of the region’s assets on signs of a pickup in
the world economy.  The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia Dollar Index had its first
weekly advance in December after data showed Chinese industrial
companies’ profits rose for a third month in November while
South Korea’s current-account surplus widened to a  record  $6.9
billion. International funds plowed $1.6 billion into the stock
markets of India, Taiwan and South Korea this week, exchange
data show. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index of regional  shares  rose
for a sixth week.  “Strength in Taiwan and Korean currencies is related to a
cyclical recovery in the region’s export-oriented economies,”
said  Ju Wang , a senior foreign-exchange strategist in  Hong Kong 
at HSBC Holdings Plc. “Both are closely linked to China and
recent data suggest some recovery is happening. Solid net
inflows into emerging-market funds continue.”  The rupee strengthened 0.5 percent this week to 54.7750 per
dollar in Mumbai, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
won appreciated 0.4 percent to 1,070.53 while Malaysia’s ringgit
advanced to 3.0640 from 3.0645 at the end of last week. Taiwan’s
dollar weakened 0.1 percent to NT$29.136, after strengthening as
much as 0.3 percent earlier.  The Asia Dollar Index, which tracks the region’s 10 most-
active currencies excluding the yen, advanced 0.2 percent this
week to 118.09.  Signs of Recovery  Taiwan’s factory output rose 5.85 percent in November from
a year earlier, the fastest pace in nine months, official data
showed on Dec. 24. South Korea’s industrial  production  rose 2.9
percent, beating the median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey
for a 0.8 percent gain, according to a report yesterday.  China’s  yuan  strengthened yesterday, paring a weekly loss,
before U.S. lawmakers resumed budget negotiations to avert more
than $600 billion in spending cuts and tax increases that take
effect in January. President  Barack Obama  said yesterday at the
White House that he was “modestly optimistic” a deal could be
reached.  The People’s Bank of China bolstered the  reference rate  by
0.08 percent to 6.2896 per dollar. The yuan rose 0.04 percent
yesterday to 6.2335, paring the weekly loss to 0.06 percent.  “The trade and investment demand for yuan and Chinese
assets has steadily increased, providing support to the
currency,” said Bruce Yam, a currency strategist at Sun Hung
Kai Financial Ltd. in Hong Kong. “No politician could afford to
derail a recovery in the world’s largest economy, so risk
appetite has improved on hopes that it’ll be solved.”  Elsewhere,  Thailand ’s baht and the Philippine peso were
little changed for the week at 30.60 per dollar and 41.058,
respectively. Indonesia’s rupiah rose 0.2 percent to 9,638,
while Vietnamese dong advanced 0.1 percent to 20,838.  For the year, South Korea’s won gained 7.7 percent, the
most among the 11 most-traded Asian currencies, followed by the
peso and  Singapore dollar . Yesterday was the last trading day of
2012 for financial markets in South Korea, Taiwan, Indonesia,
Thailand and the  Philippines .  To contact the reporter on this story:
