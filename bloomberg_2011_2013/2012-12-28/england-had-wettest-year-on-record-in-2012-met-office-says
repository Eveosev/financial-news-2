England  had its wettest year on
record in 2012, the Met Office said, citing provisional figures.  About 1,096 millimeters (43 inches) of rain fell in England
from Jan. 1 to Dec. 26, the most for any calendar year since
records began in 1910, the national weather  forecaster  said on
its website yesterday. Records were broken in northern and
eastern England, the Midlands and east Anglia.  The U.K. had 1,291.2 millimeters of rain on average this
year through Dec. 26, just 46 millimeters below the record set
in 2000, the Met Office said. Temperatures and sunshine hours
across the country were near normal in 2012, according to the
report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
