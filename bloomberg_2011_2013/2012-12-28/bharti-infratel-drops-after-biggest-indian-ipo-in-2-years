Bharti Infratel Ltd. (BHIN) , a unit of
 India ’s largest wireless operator, slumped on its trading debut
after raising 41.7 billion rupees ($761 million) in the
country’s biggest initial public offering in two years.  The  shares  dropped 13 percent to 191.65 rupees at the close
in Mumbai today, compared with a 0.6 percent gain in the
benchmark BSE India  Sensitive Index. (SENSEX)   Bharti Infratel, the New Delhi-based unit of
telecommunications operator  Bharti Airtel Ltd. (BHARTI) , set the listing
price at 220 rupees apiece.  “The IPO price was probably too high and the return on
investment isn’t very attractive,” said Deven Choksey, managing
director at K.R. Choksey Shares & Securities Pvt. in Mumbai,
which didn’t recommend buying the stock in the initial sale.
“The IPO served as an exit option for older investors and isn’t
likely to generate much returns for existing investors.”  Bharti Infratel’s  return on capital  was 3.1 percent in the
year ended March 31, compared with parent Bharti Airtel’s 5.3
percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  About 10 percent of Bharti Infratel’s stock was sold in the
IPO, with retail investors paying 210 rupees a share. The sale
to institutions and wealthy individuals was at 220 rupees
apiece.  Today’s decline reduced Bharti Infratel’s market value to
$6.6 billion from $7.6 billion at the listing price. In 2008,
KKR & Co., the New York-based buyout firm, agreed to invest $250
million in Bharti Infratel, valuing the company at $12.5
billion.  Bharti Airtel  increased  0.1 percent to 319.05 rupees today.  Exit Option  The stock was marketed at between 210 rupees and 240 rupees
each, according to the IPO  prospectus . Institutions and wealthy
individuals bid for all of the 148.4 million shares reserved for
them, while retail investors sought to acquire 12.2 million
shares, according to data on the National Stock Exchange’s
website on Dec 14.  The listing will provide an exit for companies such as
Temasek Holdings Pte, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Citigroup
Inc., which bought a $1 billion stake in 2007. As part of the
offering, Bharti Infratel sold shares to 18 anchor investors,
including Alliance Bernstein and Wellington Management Co., who
agreed to hold the stock for at least 30 days.  Bharti Infratel operates 34,220 towers used by mobile-phone
companies, its prospectus shows. Revenue, including of units,
rose 11 percent to 94.52 billion rupees in the year ended March
31, according to the prospectus.  NMDC Sale  Bharti Infratel’s IPO was the largest since state-owned
 Coal India Ltd. (COAL)  raised about 154.8 billion rupees in October
2010. It comes after India’s government this month raised 58.3
billion rupees by selling a 10 percent stake in  NMDC Ltd. (NMDC) , the
nation’s largest iron ore producer. Initial offerings by PC
Jeweller Ltd. and Credit Analysis & Research Ltd. were
oversubscribed several times.  Indian stocks are poised for their biggest annual advance
since 2009, after Prime Minister  Manmohan Singh  eased rules to
allow more overseas investment to revive economic growth and
avert a downgrade of the nation’s credit rating.  To contact the reporter on this story:
