Dwyane Wade of the Miami Heat was
suspended one game without pay by the National Basketball
Association for flailing his leg and striking Ramon Sessions of
the  Charlotte  Bobcats in the groin.  Wade, who is averaging 20.2 points, 4.6 assists and 4.2
rebounds per game for the Eastern Conference-leading Heat
(20-6), will miss tonight’s game in  Detroit  against the Pistons
(9-22), the NBA said in a  release last night .  Wade, 30, made contact with Sessions with 8 minutes, 12
seconds remaining in the fourth quarter of the Heat’s 105-92 win
over the Bobcats on Dec. 26.  The league also fined Dwight Howard of the Los Angeles
Lakers $35,000 for the flagrant foul he got for hitting Denver’s
Kenneth Faried in the face during the third quarter of the
Nuggets’ 126-114 win on Dec. 26. He was ejected for the play.  Howard, 27, who is averaging 17.5 points and 11.8 rebounds
per game, has three flagrant fouls for the season. Two more and
he’ll receive an automatic one-game suspension.  To contact the reporter on this story:
