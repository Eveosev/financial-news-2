U.S. stocks pared losses as
President  Barack Obama  was said to plan to offer a scaled-back
budget package at a meeting with lawmakers today.  The Standard & Poorâ€™s 500 Index was down less than 0.3
percent at 1,414.29 at 10:46 a.m. in New York after earlier
slipping more than 0.8 percent.  At a White House meeting today, Obama will offer a scaled-
back package to avoid the fiscal cliff, an unidentified
