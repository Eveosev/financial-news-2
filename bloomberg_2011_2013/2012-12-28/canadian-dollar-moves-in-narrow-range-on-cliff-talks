The Canadian dollar weakened to a
month low on concern U.S. lawmakers will fail to reach an
agreement to avert spending cuts and tax increases that may push
the nation’s biggest trading partner into recession.  The currency has gained 2.4 percent this year versus its
U.S. counterpart, erasing last year’s 2.3 percent loss. The
currency fell against the majority of its most traded peers as
U.S. President  Barack Obama  stood by his demand to allow tax
increases for Americans with annual incomes above $250,000 in a
meeting with Congressional leaders to avert some of the effects
of tax and spending changes set to begin in January.  “Everybody is sitting on their hands waiting for some sort
of a conclusion on this fiscal cliff discussion,” said Aaron Fennell, a futures specialist at  Bank of Nova Scotia (BNS) ’s
ScotiaMcLeod unit, by phone from Toronto. “It doesn’t really
matter what happens, but once we have more details, more
information, then traders can start coming into the market.”  The loonie, as the Canadian dollar is known for the picture
of the aquatic bird on the C$1 coin, fell 0.2 percent to 99.70
cents per  U.S. dollar  at 5 p.m. in Toronto. One loonie buys
$1.003.  Crude oil, the country’s biggest export, fell 0.1 percent
to $90.80 per barrel in  New York . The Standard & Poor’s 500
Index fell 1.1 percent.  Yields Decline  Canada ’s 10-year government bonds rose, with yields falling
0.03 basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 1.77 percent.
The 2.75 percent security due in June 2022 gained 22 cents to
C$108.48.  “Markets are concerned about the U.S. and the fiscal cliff
and nothing being resolved,” David Bradley, director of
foreign-exchange trading in Toronto at Scotia Capital Inc. unit
of the Bank of  Nova Scotia , said by phone from Toronto. “Just
watch out for headlines and see how that moves equities, and
that’s what should impact the Canadian dollar.”  The Canadian economy is expected to grow 1.8 percent next
year, its slowest rate since the 2009 recession, according to a
survey of 29 economists by Bloomberg news.  Futures traders decreased bets that the Canadian dollar
will gain against the U.S. dollar, figures from the Washington-
based Commodity Futures Trading Commission show.  The difference in the number of wagers by  hedge funds  and
other large speculators on an advance in the Canadian dollar
compared with those on a drop, known as net longs, was 63,352 on
Dec. 25, compared with 74,278 a week earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
