Iran ’s naval forces started a six-
day military exercise around the Strait of Hormuz, a chokepoint
for 20 percent of the world’s traded oil, the official  Islamic
Republic News Agency  reported.  The drill, which covers a large area extending to the Sea
of Oman and the north of the Indian Ocean, is aimed at
“displaying the readiness of armed and naval forces to defend
Iran’s waterway and national interests,” Iranian Navy Commander
Habibollah Sayari said today according to IRNA. The exercise
will involve testing defensive and missile systems, combat
vessels and submarines, Sayari said on Dec. 25.  Iran is entangled in a conflict with world powers over its
nuclear program, which they say may be intended to develop
atomic weapons, a charge the Persian Gulf country rejects.
 Israel  has said that “all options are on the table” to stop
Iran from building a weapon, including a military offensive.  Iran regularly announces progress in its domestically built
military equipment and routinely holds military exercises to
display its readiness in the face of perceived threats by the
U.S. and Israel. Iranian military officials announced in
September plans to hold a military exercise in the country’s
southern waters before the end of the Iranian calendar year on
March 20, 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
