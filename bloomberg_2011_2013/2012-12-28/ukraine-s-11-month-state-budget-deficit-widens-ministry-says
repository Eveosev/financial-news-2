Ukraine’s state budget gap ballooned
almost fourfold in the first 11 months of the year as spending
rose 17.5 percent, the  Finance Ministry  said.  The shortfall from January through November rose to 41.2
billion hryvnia ($5.1 billion) from 11.1 billion hryvnia a year
earlier, the Kiev-based ministry said in a statement on its
 website  today.  Ukraine raised 6.7 billion hryvnia from January to November
by selling state assets, the ministry said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
