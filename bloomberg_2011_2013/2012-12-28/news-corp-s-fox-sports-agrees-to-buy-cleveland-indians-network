News Corp. (NWSA) ’s Fox Sports Media Group
agreed to buy regional sports network SportsTime Ohio, gaining
the TV rights to Major League Baseball’s Cleveland Indians.  The deal will last more than 10 years, according to a
person familiar with the situation. Fox Sports will pay about
$230 million for SportsTime Ohio and $40 million a year for the
rights, said the person, who asked not to be named because the
contract details are private.  SportsTime Ohio has been broadcasting Indians games for the
past seven seasons. Fox Sports Ohio, which carried the games
prior to the 2006 season, serves more than 5 million homes in
Ohio and parts of Kentucky, Indiana, Pennsylvania, New York and
 West Virginia , according to a statement.  News Corp. has increased its spending on sports as the
company collects higher programming fees on its networks from
pay-TV providers such as  Comcast Corp. (CMCSA)  and  DirecTV. (DTV)  The Rupert
Murdoch-controlled company agreed last month to buy 49 percent
of the Yes Network, the cable network that carries New York
Yankees games, in a deal that valued that asset at about $3
billion. Fox Sports is also competing with Time Warner Cable
Inc. to secure TV rights for the Los Angeles Dodgers.  “The acquisition of SportsTime Ohio solidifies our
business in Ohio,” Jeff Krolik, Fox Sports Networks’ executive
vice president, said in the statement. “We look forward to once
again showcasing the Indians.”  News Corp. fell 1.1 percent to $24.61 at the close in  New
York . The shares have gained 38 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
