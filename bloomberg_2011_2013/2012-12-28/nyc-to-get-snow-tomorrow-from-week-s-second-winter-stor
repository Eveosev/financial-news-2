New York City  may receive as much as 4 inches (10 centimeters) of snow tomorrow as the second winter storm of the week moves along the East Coast.  The system is expected to move through the Ohio Valley and then offshore, brushing the coast as it turns onto a northeasterly track, according to the  National Weather Service . Philadelphia and Newark, New Jersey, may also receive 4 inches, while Baltimore may get 3.  “It’s a pretty typical winter setup for us,” said Dan Hoffman, a weather service meteorologist in Upton, New York. “We’re on the cool side so we will get snow. It doesn’t look like a major event.”  The storm comes on the heels of a more powerful system that dumped more than a foot of snow across the Midwest to New England and spawned tornadoes from Texas to  North Carolina . That storm, now  threatening Newfoundland  with gusts as high as 90 miles (145 kilometers) per hour, has been blamed for the deaths of at least 17 people across the U.S., according to the  Associated Press .  The latest storm has prompted winter storm advisories from Arkansas to New Jersey. A freezing-rain advisory has also been issued for parts of Arkansas,  Oklahoma ,  Missouri  and  Tennessee .  Cincinnati may receive 2 to 4 inches of snow later today as the storm moves east and Pittsburgh is expected to get about 3 inches tomorrow, according to the weather service.  In  New York , skies will clear and temperatures fall after the storm passes, Hoffman said.  “The best chance for snow tomorrow is between 11 a.m. and 11 p.m.,” he said. “By Sunday morning, it will all be cleared out and breezy and cool.”  There is a slight chance for light snow on New Year’s Eve in  New York , he said. The weather service is predicting mostly cloudy skies for Dec. 31 to Jan. 1.  To contact the reporter on this story: Brian K.
