Asia’s fuel oil crack spread is
poised to widen for a third week, signaling increased losses for
refiners turning crude into residual fuels.  Royal Dutch Shell
Plc (RDSA)  sold gasoil for a third day in Singapore.  Fuel Oil  Hin Leong Trading Pte bought 20,000 metric tons of 180-
centistoke high-sulfur fuel oil from OAO Lukoil for Jan. 17 to
Jan. 21 loading, according to a Bloomberg News survey of traders
who monitored the Platts window. The transaction was at a
discount of $3 a ton to benchmark quotes.  Fuel oil’s  discount  to Asian marker Dubai crude widened 23
cents to $8.54 a barrel at 2:33 p.m. Singapore time, according
to data from PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a broker. The crack spread
has widened 2.6 percent so far this week.  The premium of 180-centistoke fuel oil to 380-centistoke
grade was unchanged after declining to $9 a ton, PVM data show.
This  viscosity spread  has narrowed 12 percent this week,
indicating bunker, or marine fuel, gained more than supplies
used in power stations.  Middle Distillates  Shell sold 150,000 barrels of  gasoil , or diesel, with 0.5
percent sulfur, to Hin Leong for Jan. 23 to Jan. 27 loading,
according to the Bloomberg survey. Europe’s biggest oil company
paid the  Singapore  trader a discount of $2.40 a barrel to
January prices.  Gasoil’s premium to Dubai crude dropped 4 cents to $19.77 a
barrel at 2:33 p.m. Singapore time, according to PVM. This  crack
spread , a gauge of processing profit, has shrunk 3.8 percent so
far this week.  Jet fuel  was unchanged after climbing to a premium of 40
cents a barrel to gasoil, PVM data showed. This  regrade  has
turned positive from a 10-cent discount last week, meaning it is
more profitable to make aviation fuel over diesel.  Light Distillates  The premium of Japan naphtha to London-traded Brent crude
futures was little changed at $118.91 a ton at 5:21 p.m.
Singapore time, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. This
crack spread, a measure of the profit from making the
petrochemical and gasoline feedstock, has widen 2.1 percent so
far this week. It’s set to advance for a second week.  Shell sold 25,000 tons of open-specification naphtha for
second-half February delivery to Itochu Corp. at $965 a ton,
according to the Bloomberg survey. Mabanaft GmbH sold an similar

first-half March delivery to BP and bought a first-half May

showed. The March shipment traded at a premium of $30 a ton to
the May cargo.  The Swiss trader also sold 25,000 tons of naphtha for
first-half March delivery to Shell and bought a parcel for
first-half April, the survey showed. The March shipment traded
at a premium of $15.50 a ton to April. Glencore further sold a
cargo for second-half February to Marubeni and bought a first-
half March shipment. The February cargo traded at a premium of
$7 a ton to the March lot.  BP Plc sold 50,000 barrels of 92-RON gasoline, loading Jan.
12 to Jan. 16, to PetroChina Co. at $120.30 a barrel, the survey
showed.  Tenders  Mangalore Refinery & Petrochemicals Ltd. offered to sell
245,000 tons of refined oil products for loading from end-
January to February from New Mangalore, the company said in
