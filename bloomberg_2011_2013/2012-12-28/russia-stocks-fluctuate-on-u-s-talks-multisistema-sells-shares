Russian equities headed for their
first weekly decline in four as industrial shares retreated amid
concern talks between U.S. President  Barack Obama  and lawmakers
may not yield a budget deal.  The Micex Index slid 0.3 percent to 1,474.60 by 3:53 p.m.
in Moscow, heading for a 0.2 percent drop in the week. Of the 50
stocks in the gauge, 19 climbed, one was little changed and 30
dropped. The measure has added 5.2 percent this year. OAO
Mostotrest, the bridge and road builder part-owned by President
Vladimir Putin’s judo partner Arkady Rotenberg, sank 4.7
percent. OAO Mechel,  Russia ’s largest coking-coal producer, lost
1.2 percent, extending this year’s drop to 25 percent.  Congressional leaders plan to meet with Obama today and
House Republicans will convene Dec. 30 as U.S. lawmakers seek to
avoid more than $600 billion in spending cuts and tax gains that
will start in January. Industrial and health-care shares led
declines on the Micex, losing more than 1.7 percent on average.  “Investors are concerned that if the U.S. doesn’t reach a
budget deal, we’ll see another round of economic crisis,” Slava Smolyaninov, head of research at UralSib Capital, said by phone
from Moscow. “A potential downgrade of the U.S. government debt
is a high risk.”  Failure to reach a budget agreement would push the U.S.
into recession for the first half of 2013, the nonpartisan
Congressional Budget Office has said. The amount of shares
traded on the Micex was 33 percent below the 100-day average,
data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Multisistema IPO  Russian (INDEXCF)  markets close from today for New Year and Christmas
holidays, with trading restarting Jan. 8.  OAO Multisistema, a water utility service company,
yesterday raised 98 million rubles ($3.2 million) in an initial
public offering on the Moscow Exchange, according to a statement
from the bourse today. The company sold 10 million shares at 9.8
rubles apiece, after planning to list up to 35 million shares.  Multisistema, which sold shares in the fourth IPO by a
Russian company this year, cited “unfavorable” market
conditions. Share placements by Russian companies this year
raised $3.6 billion, according to today’s Sberbank CIB note.  The  RTS Index (RTSI$) , Russia’s dollar-denominated equity gauge,
decreased 0.6 percent to 1,526.13. The  Bloomberg Russia-US
stocks (RUS14BN)  measure rose 0.8 percent to 97.96 yesterday. The gauge
has added 8.2 percent this year.  The  Market Vectors Russia ETF (RSX) , the largest dedicated
Russian exchange-traded fund, increased 1.2 percent to $29.28,
gaining by the most since Dec. 18. The RTS Volatility Index,
which measures expected swings in the stock futures, declined
1.6 percent to 23.62 points.  Year’s Worst  Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index was poised for a 0.1 percent
gain in the year. The  Russian Depositary Index (RDXUSD)  was steady at
1,722.90. Most metals fell on the London Metal Exchange,
including tin, nickel and aluminum.  Crude oil, Russia’s main export, climbed 0.1 percent to
$90.99 in New York. The country receives about half of its
budget revenue from the oil and natural gas industry.  OAO OGK-2, the wholesale power generator controlled by OAO
Gazprom, added 0.4 percent to 34.37 kopeks, paring its loss in
the year to 54 percent. The stock is the Micex’s worst performer
this year.  OAO Sollers, a Russian automaker that works with Ford Motor
Co., increased 1.2 percent to 680 rubles, extending its 124
percent rally this year. The shares are the best performer on
the Micex this year.  OAO Aeroflot, Russia’s biggest airline, rose 2.3 percent,
the most on the Micex today. The shares have lost 12 percent
this year.  The gauge trades at about 5.4 times  estimated earnings .
That compares with a multiple of 10.6 times for the MSCI
 Emerging Markets  Index, which has gained 15 percent this year.  Russian equities have the lowest valuations based on
estimated earnings among 21 emerging markets tracked by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
