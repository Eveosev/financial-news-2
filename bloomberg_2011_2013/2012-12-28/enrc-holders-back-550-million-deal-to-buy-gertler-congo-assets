Eurasian Natural Resources Corp. (ENRC) 
shareholders backed a $550 million deal to buy out Israeli
billionaire Dan Gertler from a company holding interests in
copper and cobalt licenses in the Democratic Republic of Congo.  Shareholders at a London meeting today voted 99.2 percent
in favor of the cash bid for 49.5 percent of Camrose Resources
Ltd., which is indirectly owned by a Gertler family trust, the
company said in a statement.  ENRC, which produces ferroalloys and iron ore as well as
copper, bought its 50.5 percent stake in Camrose from Gertler,
39, for $175 million in 2010. ENRC said Dec. 7. that the latest
deal will simplify its structure and create cost savings across
its operations in the region. The Camrose assets produce about
100,000 metric tons of copper annually and estimated 2013
capital expenditure is about $300 million.  Camrose lost $14.8 million in the six months through June
30 and had gross assets of $326 million at that date, according
to ENRC. Camrose holds about 64 percent of Vancouver-based
mining company  Africo Resources Ltd. (ARL) , according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
