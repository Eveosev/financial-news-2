The Turkish lira appreciated for a
second day and bond yields fell as foreign-exchange sales by
companies for year-end tax payments outweighed a less-than-
expected fall in the nation’s trade deficit in November.  The lira gained 0.1 percent against the dollar to 1.7872 at
5:05 p.m. in Istanbul, the strongest level since Dec. 20. The
currency earlier dropped as much as 0.2 percent. Yields on
benchmark debt fell one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point,
to 6.15 percent.  “Companies are selling foreign-exchange for tax
payments,” Emir Baruh, a currency trader at Akbank TAS, said in
e-mailed comments.  The trade  gap  was $7.16 billion in the month, the
statistics office in Ankara said on its website today, bigger
than the $6 billion median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of
five economists. The deficit fell from $7.57 billion a year ago.
Imports rose 13 percent to $21 billion, increasing for the first
time since May. Exports rose 25 percent to $13.8 billion.  The lira gained 5.8 percent this year, the third-largest
gain in emerging  Europe  after the Polish zloty and the Hungarian
forint. The currency sank 18 percent last year in the biggest
depreciation globally as the  current-account deficit  hit a
record high at 10 percent of gross domestic product.  Yields on two-year lira benchmark bonds fell 486 basis
points this year, heading for the biggest annual fall since
2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
