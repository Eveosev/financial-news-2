Leighton Holdings Ltd. (LEI) ,  Australia ’s
biggest construction company, won contracts worth a combined
A$1.2 billion ($1.3 billion) for  Inpex Corp. (1605) ’s Ichthys liquefied
natural gas project in northern Australia.  A unit of the Sydney-based company was awarded a A$923
million contract to develop infrastructure for the project’s
onshore site near Darwin, and a four-year maintenance contract,
Leighton, which is ultimately controlled by Madrid-based
 Actividades de Construccion y Servicios SA , said in a stock
exchange filing.  The awards boost Leighton’s contracts from the oil and gas
industry to more than A$4.5 billion, as Australia aims to
surpass Qatar as the world’s biggest exporter of LNG by 2020.
Leighton, which in May forecast profit of A$400 million to A$450
million in the year to Dec. 31, has fallen 6 percent this year
and is on course for the third consecutive year of declines.  “We see the LNG and coal seam methane markets offering
significant opportunities for the Leighton Group,” Leighton
Chief Executive Officer Hamish Tyrwhitt said in the statement.  Ichthys is a $34 billion project between Inpex and  Total
SA. (FP)  The venture, with a planned capacity of 8.4 million metric
tons a year, is expected to start production by the end of 2016
and is among more than A$200 billion of planned LNG projects in
the country.  Leighton rose 0.3 percent to A$17.89 in Sydney compared
with a 0.5 percent gain for the benchmark S&P/ASX 200 Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
