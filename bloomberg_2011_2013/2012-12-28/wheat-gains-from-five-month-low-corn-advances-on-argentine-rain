Wheat rebounded from a five-month
low on speculation that a government report today may show a
gain in U.S. export sales after prices dropped. Soybeans and
corn also increased.  U.S. export sales of wheat in the week ended Dec. 20 may
total 500,000 metric tons to 1 million tons, up from about
431,000 tons in the same week last year, according to a
Bloomberg News survey. The  U.S. Department of Agriculture  is
scheduled to release figures at 8:30 a.m. in  Washington . Wheat
prices have tumbled 10 percent this month.  “Grains have been weighed down by the lack of fresh export
sales,” Arnaud Saulais, a broker at Starsupply Commodity
Brokers in Nyon,  Switzerland , said in an e-mailed report today.
“High U.S. wheat exports numbers today could be seen as a
buying signal.”  Wheat for March delivery climbed 0.7 percent to $7.775 a
bushel by 6:16 a.m. on the  Chicago  Board of Trade. Futures
dropped to $7.645 yesterday, the lowest level since July 2.
Prices are still headed for a 19 percent advance this year.  Trading in wheat in Chicago was about 60 percent lower than
the 30-day average for the time of day, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  In Paris, milling wheat for March delivery rose 0.8 percent
to 250.25 euros ($329.89) a ton on NYSE Liffe. The most-active
contract is up 28 percent this year.  Soybeans for March delivery climbed 0.5 percent to $14.2125
a bushel on the CBOT, heading for an 18 percent increase this
year. Corn for March delivery gained 0.4 percent to $6.9425 a
bushel, up 7.4 percent in 2012.  Argentina Rains  Rain has delayed corn and soybean planting in  Argentina  and
the harvesting of wheat crops. The country is the world’s
second-largest corn exporter and third-biggest shipper of
soybeans. One million hectares (2.47 million acres) were
affected by excessive rain, delaying wheat harvesting by 11
percent and corn sowing by 5 percent compared with the previous
season, the Buenos Aires Cereals Exchange said yesterday.  The rain “has been a little bit of concern for soybeans
not being able to get planted and also for wheat, it will
downgrade some of that,” said  Michael Pitts , a commodity sales
director at National Australia Bank Ltd.  To contact the reporters on this story:
