The U.S. hog-breeding herd on Dec. 1
rose unexpectedly on speculation that producers locked in costs
for feed, avoiding eroding margins.  About 5.817 million  sows  were being held back for breeding
at the start of this month, up 0.2 percent from 5.803 million a
year earlier, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said today in a
quarterly report. The breeding herd rose 0.5 percent from the
end of the previous quarter, the USDA said.  Ten analysts in a Bloomberg News survey expected the herd
to decline 0.8 percent, on average, as rising prices for corn,
the main ingredient in livestock feed, damped profit prospects.
The grain has climbed 7.3 percent this year, reaching a record
$8.49 a bushel on Aug. 10, after the worst U.S. drought since
the 1930s cut production.  “People aren’t feeling the pain economically because
they’re using futures to manage their risk,”  Mark Greenwood ,
who oversees $1.4 billion of loans and leases to the hog
business as a vice president at AgStar Financial Services Inc.
in Mankato,  Minnesota , said in an interview before the report.
“That’s why I think we haven’t seen the liquidation. The people
who are left are pretty darn good at risk management.”  The average producer in AgStar’s portfolio made $5 to $10 a
head in 2012, Greenwood said. Farmers may make $5 a head next
year, he said.  The inventory of all hogs and pigs totaled 66.348 million
on Dec. 1, little changed from 66.361 million a year earlier,
the USDA said. Analysts expected a 0.5 percent drop.  Chicago Futures  Hog futures for February settlement fell 0.7 percent to
settle at 86.375 cents a pound at 1 p.m. on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange. The price has climbed 2.5 percent this
year. The USDA released its report after the markets closed.  The inventory of hogs to be sold for slaughter was 60.531
million, little changed from 60.558 million a year earlier, the
USDA said. Analysts expected a 0.7 percent decline.  Sows averaged 10.15 pigs per litter in the three months
ended Nov. 30, a record for the quarter and up from 10.02 a year
earlier, the USDA said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
