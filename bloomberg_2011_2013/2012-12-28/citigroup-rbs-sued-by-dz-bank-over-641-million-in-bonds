Citigroup Inc. (C) ,  Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc  and  UBS AG (UBS)  were sued in separate cases in New
York, accused of fraud in the sale of a total of $845 million in
mortgage securities.  DZ Bank AG sued Citigroup and RBS, while HSH Nordbank AG
sued UBS and RBS, according to papers filed today in New York
State Supreme Court. The German banks say offering materials
contained misrepresentations about loans backing the securities,
leading to losses.  “Defendants’ wrongdoing has led directly to plaintiffs’
damages, which include both realized losses and loss of market
value on the securities,” DZ Bank and another entity, DG
Holding Trust, said in the Citigroup filing.  The cases add to claims against Wall Street banks over
mortgage loans bundled into securities and sold during the U.S.
housing boom. DZ Bank and HSH Nordbank have previously sued
other lenders, including Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Bank of
America Corp. and  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)   The DZ Bank case against Citigroup involves $362 million in
securities, while its RBS claims stem from $279 million in
securities, according to court papers. The HSH Nordbank case
against UBS is over $150 million in bonds, and its RBS suit
involves $54 million.  Law Firm  All the cases were filed by the same New York-based law
firm,  Labaton Sucharow LLP .  Scott Helfman, a spokesman for New York-based Citigroup,
and Megan Stinson, a spokeswoman for Zurich-based UBS, declined
to comment on the filings. A spokesman for Edinburgh-based RBS
couldn’t be reached for comment.  The cases are Deutsche Zentral-Genossenschaftsbank AG v.
Citigroup Inc., 654566-2012; Deutsche Zentral-
Genossenschaftsbank AG v.  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS) ,
654569-2012; HSH Nordbank AG v.  UBS AG (UBSN) , 654574-2012; and HSH
Nordbank v. RBS Holdings USA Inc., 654575-2012, New York State
Supreme Court ( Manhattan ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
