Anna Fenninger beat overall  World
Cup  leader  Tina Maze  to take the giant slalom in Semmering,
Austria.   Austria’s Fenninger won the two-run race on the Panorama
course 103 kilometers south-west of Vienna in a combined time of
two minutes, 13.09 seconds. Maze of  Slovenia  finished second at
1.10 second back, while France’s Tessa Worley was third at 1.18
second behind.  Fenninger’s victory today meant she leapfrogged overall
defending World Cup champion Lindsey Vonn in the rankings to
take fourth place with 450 points.  Maze, who has dominated the women’s World Cup this season
in the technical events, extended her lead in the overall
standings to 999 points. Germany’s Maria Hoefl-Riesch, who
finished fourth today, is second with 582 points. Maze also
leads the giant slalom standings.    Mikaela Shiffrin, a 17-year-old American who won her first
World Cup race last week in Sweden, finished in eighth place.
Her team mate and former Olympic giant slalom champion  Julia
Mancuso  was 25th.     Vonn, the Olympic downhill champion, didn’t compete in
Austria. She is taking a break from skiing to regain strength
after being hospitalized last month with a stomach infection.
Vonn is now fifth in the overall standings, with 414 points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
