The Romanian leu weakened for a
third day, its longest losing streak since Dec. 5,  as companies
bought euros to cover their foreign-currency needs.  The leu dropped 0.2 percent to 4.4384 per euro by 4:37 p.m.
in Bucharest today. The currency is up 2.2 percent since
Romanians elected lawmakers on Dec. 9, making it the best
performer among emerging-market currencies tracked by Bloomberg
in the period.  “A pickup of the natural commercial demand for hard
currency” is weakening the leu, Mihai Tantaru, an economist at
ING Bank  Romania  SA in Bucharest, said in a note today. “We see
the leu caught in the range of 4.42-4.44 against the euro for
this year’s last couple of sessions,” he said.  The leu appreciated to the strongest level in more than
seven months this week on improved investor appetite as Prime
Minister Victor Ponta’s new government won a confidence vote in
parliament on Dec. 21. Ponta is counting on a two-thirds
majority in the legislature to pass a 2013 budget and start
talks with the International Monetary Fund and the European
Union in January to renew the nation’s stability accord.  Yields on Romania’s 2016 euro-denominated bonds fell two
basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 2.98 percent today,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
