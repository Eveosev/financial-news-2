Russian equities are underperforming
emerging-market stocks by the most in four years as concern the
government isn’t safeguarding shareholder interests curbs
foreign investment in the market.  Russia’s Micex Index has gained 11 percent this year in
dollar terms while the  Bloomberg Russia-US Equity Index (RUS14BN)  is set
for an 8 percent advance, trailing the 15 percent rally in the
MSCI  Emerging Markets  Index. The gap is the biggest since 2008,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. American depositary
receipts of  OAO RusHydro (RSHYY) , the state-run hydropower producer,
were the worst performers in the Russia-US index this year while
 OAO Gazprom (OGZPY) , the natural-gas monopoly, lost 11 percent.  Russia is ranked the most corrupt nation among the Group of
20 advanced economies in Berlin-based Transparency
International’s 2012 Corruption Perceptions Index. President
Vladamir Putin’s government approached Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
to help rehabilitate the nation’s image and attract investment.  “People have avoided stocks, like Gazprom, where there is
massive interference in the business by the government,”
Jonathan Neill, who helps oversee $250 million at FPP Asset
Management, including Gazprom shares, said yesterday by phone
from  London . “People fear that the company isn’t independent.”  More than half of trading in the Russian companies takes
place in London and its stocks’ valuations are the cheapest
among the biggest emerging markets.  Lower Dividends  Gazprom spent $53 billion on capital projects last year,
more than  PetroChina Co. (857) ’s $46 billion and $36.8 billion at
 Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) , leaving just 7 percent of earnings to pay as
dividends, the least of the world’s 10 largest energy companies.
Gazprom lost 0.1 percent to $9.47 in  New York  yesterday. Gazprom
shares traded in Moscow fell 0.6 percent to 143.91 rubles, or
$4.74, and have plunged 16 percent this year. One ADR equals two
ordinary shares.  George Rizhinashvili, a deputy chairman at RusHydro, said
on Dec. 18 that the government’s share in the company will
increase to as much as 66 percent from the current 60.5 percent,
after completing an additional share issuance. RusHydro dropped
0.9 percent to $2.32 in New York, adding to an annual decline of
23 percent. Shares traded in Moscow were little changed at 73
kopecks, or 2 U.S. cents. One ADR equals 100 shares.  “Russian companies are undervalued, but they’re
undervalued for a reason,” Michael Kotov, a trader at  Alfa Bank 
in Moscow, said by phone yesterday. “There is corruption, lack
of transparency, a defunct justice system.”  Emerging Valuations  The Bloomberg Russia-US gauge fell 0.1 percent to $97.88 in
New York as  futures  expiring in March on Moscow’s dollar-
denominated RTS Index advanced 0.4 percent to 153,590. The 50-
stock Micex Index slipped 0.2 percent to 1,474.72, a second day
of declines.  The Russian benchmark  trades  at 5.5 times estimated profit,
trailing the Bovespa’s 17.8, the Sensex’s 15.4, and the Shanghai
Composite’s 11, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The  Market Vectors Russia ETF (RSX) , the largest dedicated
Russian exchange-traded fund, increased 0.4 percent to $29.40,
the highest price in a week. The RTS Volatility Index, which
measures expected swings in the  stock futures , added 0.9 percent
to 24.22 points.  Ruble futures rose 0.1 percent to 30.773 per dollar
yesterday. The currency has gained 5.7 percent against the
dollar this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
