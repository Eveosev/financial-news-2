China’s yuan strengthened as the
central bank raised the currency’s fixing for the first time in
seven days before U.S. lawmakers resume budget negotiations.  The People’s Bank of China bolstered the  reference rate  by
0.08 percent, the most since Nov. 12, to 6.2896 per dollar. U.S.
President  Barack Obama  plans to meet with Democratic and
Republican congressional leaders at the White House today in an
attempt to avert at least $600 billion in spending cuts and tax
increases that take effect in January. The  Shanghai Composite (SHCOMP)  of
shares rose 0.1 percent today, taking its advance this month to
11.5 percent, the most since October 2010.  “The trade and investment demand for yuan and Chinese
assets has steadily increased, providing support to the
currency,” said Bruce Yam, a currency strategist at Sun Hung
Kai Financial Ltd. in Hong Kong. “No politician could afford to
derail a recovery in the world’s largest economy, so risk
appetite has improved on hopes that it’ll be solved.”  The  yuan  rose 0.04 percent to 6.2336 per dollar as of 10:27
a.m. in Shanghai, according to the China Foreign Exchange Trade
System. The spot is allowed to trade as much as 1 percent on
either side of the fixing. The currency fell 0.06 percent this
week, paring this year’s gain to 0.97 percent.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves
in exchange rates used to price options, was unchanged at 1.8
percent today and has declined 93 basis points, or 0.93
percentage point, this year.  The People’s Bank of China issued rules allowing companies
in the Qianhai district in Shenzhen to borrow yuan from banks in
Hong Kong, according to a statement yesterday.  In  Hong Kong ’s offshore market, the yuan was steady at
6.2288 per dollar, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards strengthened 0.05 percent
to 6.3315 per dollar, a 1.5 percent discount to the onshore spot
rate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
