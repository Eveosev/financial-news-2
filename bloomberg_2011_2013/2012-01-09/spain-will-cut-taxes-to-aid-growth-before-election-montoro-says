Spain ’s government will cut taxes to
a level lower than they were when the  People’s Party  took power
late last year before the next general election due in 2015,
Budget Minister Cristobal Montoro said.  “We believe in stimulating our economy cutting taxes,”
Montoro said in an interview on COPE radio station today. “At
the end of this legislature all of us will be paying less tax.”  Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy  raised taxes last month on
incomes and property 10 days after taking power, even after
pledging tax cuts during the election campaign. Spain’s 2011
budget deficit probably widened to 8 percent of gross domestic
product compared with a 6 percent target, the government said on
Dec. 30.  “We had a country teetering on the edge of the abyss,”
Montoro said. “We had to act decisively.”  Montoro said he plans to impose caps on spending and
borrowing by Spanish regional governments with penalties for
those who don’t comply, similar to the European Union’s latest
proposals for imposing budget discipline on members of the
single currency area. He said the government has no plan to
increase the sales-tax rate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
