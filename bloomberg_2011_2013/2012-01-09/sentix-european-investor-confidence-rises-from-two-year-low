European investor confidence rose
from a 2 1/2 year low in January as expectations grew that the
euro region will avoid a prolonged recession.  An index measuring sentiment in the 17-nation euro area
increased to minus 21.1 from minus 24 in December, which was the
lowest reading since July 2009, the Limburg, Germany-based
Sentix research institute said in an e-mailed statement today. A
gauge of expectations rose 7 points to minus 23.5, while an
indicator for current conditions fell to minus 18.8 from minus
17.3 in December.  “The year has started with a glimmer of light,” Sentix
said in the statement. “The improvement in expectations is
necessary to avert a protracted recession in the euro area.”  Euro nations including Italy and  Spain  are winning a
reprieve from record-high borrowing costs as investors give
efforts to reduce debt the benefit of the doubt. At the same
time, the European Commission cut its 2012 growth forecast by
more than half to 0.5 percent in November, and last week
Luxembourg Prime Minister  Jean-Claude Juncker  said the region is
“on the brink of a recession of which one doesn’t yet know its
scope.”  Sentix said 884 investors participated in its monthly
survey, which was conducted Jan. 5-7. The results are never
revised.  To contact the reporter on this story:
