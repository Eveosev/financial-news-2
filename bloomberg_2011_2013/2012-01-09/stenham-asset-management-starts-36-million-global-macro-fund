Stenham Asset Management , a London-
based investment-management company that oversees $2.7 billion,
started Stenham Helix, a global fund-of-hedge-funds.  The $36 million fund, which will invest in fixed-income,
equities, commodities and currencies, requires a minimum
investment of $25,000, according to a statement on Jan. 6.
Participants can exit the fund with 35 days’ notice, compared
with as much as 95 days for some of its other funds.  “Clients have a big appetite for global macro,” Javier
Uribarren, the London-based investment director at Stenham
Advisors Plc, said in a phone interview. “It’s been one of the
strategies that has, historically, outperformed at times of
market stress.”  The fund has a target return of 5 percent to 6 percent more
than the London interbank offered rate, or Libor.  To contact the reporter on this story:
