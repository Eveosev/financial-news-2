The pound may weaken more than 2
percent to $1.5130 within three months if it declines below a
level of so-called support, Societe Generale SA said, citing
trading patterns.  Sterling slid 0.8 percent last week and if it falls below
the $1.5360 level that represents the lows seen last month, any
rebound will become less likely, technical strategists Hugues Naka and Fabien Manac’h wrote today in a note to clients.  There’s an increasing chance the pound will fall below the
$1.5360 “support level” and weaken to $1.5270, close to the
October 2011 low in the next one to two weeks, Paris-based Naka
said today by telephone. The currency will “then test the
tentative support line, which comes at $1.5130” in around three
months, he said.  The pound gained 0.1 percent to $1.5446 at 1:16 p.m. in
 London . The currency dropped to $1.5362 on Dec. 29, the weakest
since Oct. 6, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Sterling
last traded at $1.5130 in July 2010.  Support refers to an area where analysts anticipate orders
to buy a currency and its related instruments. The stronger the
support, the more selling is needed to drop below that level.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to forecast changes in a
security, commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
