rose to the highest level since October as management changes in
the country’s biggest companies led the  Bloomberg Israel-US 25
Index  to outperform shares in the U.S. and  Europe .  The gauge of the largest Israeli companies traded in New
York has jumped 6.7 percent this year to the highest since Oct.
28, outperforming the  Standard & Poor’s 500  Index’s 1.8 percent

Communications Co. (PTNR)  also announced management changes on Jan. 8.
Gas companies surged yesterday after signing a $5 billion
agreement to supply gas from the Tamar field.  “If you look at the sectors that led the outperformance,
the changes in Teva’s management and the natural-gas contracts
that were signed, helped start 2012 in a positive way,” said
Ori Licht, the head of research at I.B.I.-Israel Brokerage &
Investments Ltd. in Tel Aviv.  The  Finance Ministry  said yesterday investors demanded

Myers Squibb Co.’s Jeremy Levin will replace Shlomo Yanai as CEO

competition from newer treatments.  “What really affected the market is Teva,” Saar Golan, a
trader at Clal Finance Batucha Brokerage Ltd., said by phone
from Tel Aviv. “Teva’s gain had a lot to do with the
unhappiness with Yanai.”  Partner,  Israel ’s second-largest mobile phone provider,

Partner, after shares  dropped  more than 50 percent last year, as
the government steps up efforts to boost competition in the
local cellular market and on mounting concern about his
investment company Tao Tsuot Ltd.’s debt problems.  “Investors were asking for a certain premium for Partner
because of Ben-Dov,” said Licht. “The fact that he’s taking a
step back might be a good thing.”  Bank Leumi, Israel’s largest bank by assets, said on Jan. 1
that Galia Maor will step down as CEO in the second quarter
