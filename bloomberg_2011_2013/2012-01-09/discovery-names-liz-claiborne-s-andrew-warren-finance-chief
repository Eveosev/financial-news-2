Discovery has said it doesn’t plan to fill the COO role.  “With Andy on board, and with the strategic realignments
we announced today, I am confident that Discovery is very well
positioned to continue delivering on our strategy for
sustainable long-term growth in the U.S. and around the world,”
Chief Executive Officer David Zaslav, said in the statement.  The Wall Street Journal earlier reported the hire.  Discovery rose 0.7 percent to $41.56 in  New York  at the
