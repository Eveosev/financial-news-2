Late rains in  Malawi  may reduce the
country’s agricultural production, according to the southeast
African country’s Farmers Union.  Rains in the southern African nation, which usually start
between October and November, have only just come to several
districts and some farmers have pulled up plantings, the union
said.  “Malawi’s southern region will be affected most because
this is the area where rains come first,” Felix Jumbe, the
union’s president, said in an interview today in the capital,
Lilongwe. “We have received reports that some farmers from the
region uprooted seedlings due to wilting.”  President Bingu wa Mutharika last week said hunger may loom
because of a poor crop outlook. The country needs a recovery
plan, Jumbe said. “The farmers who have uprooted their
seedlings must be helped quickly,” he said. “We also need to
plan on which crops to promote in the wake of adverse weather
conditions,” Jumbe said, adding that now that rains have
started, “there is hope the impact will be minimal.”  It’s too early to predict agricultural production losses,
Secretary for Agriculture Erica Maganga said today by phone from
Lilongwe.  “We will carry out crop estimates sometime in April,”
Maganga said. “That is the only time we will know how much
damage the rains have caused on agriculture production.”  Malawi relies on tobacco for 60 percent of its foreign
exchange earnings, with tea the second-largest earner. Corn is
the country’s staple food.  To contact the reporter on this story:
