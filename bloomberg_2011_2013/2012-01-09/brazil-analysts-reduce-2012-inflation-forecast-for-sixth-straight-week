Economists covering  Brazil  cut their
forecast for consumer prices increases this year for a sixth
consecutive week, after inflation unexpectedly slowed in
December, allowing the central bank to meet its target for an
eighth straight year.  Consumer prices will increase 5.31 percent this year,
according to the median forecast in a Jan. 6  central bank survey 
of about 100 economists published today, from a forecast of 5.32
percent the previous week.  Central bank President Alexandre Tombini said last week
that price pressures have eased “significantly” after annual
inflation slowed in December to within the bank’s target range
for the first time in nine months. Economists expect policy
makers to cut  interest rates  half a percentage point to 10.5
percent at their Jan. 17-18 meeting, and to 9.5 percent by the
end of the year, the survey found.  Tombini said in a statement last week that inflation will
slow to the midpoint of the target range by the end of 2012.
Brazil  targets (BZMTTARG)  inflation of 4.5 percent, plus or minus two
percentage points.  Economists held their estimate for economic growth this
year at 3.3 percent. Brazil’s economy grew 2.87 last year,
according to the survey, unchanged from the previous week’s
forecast.  Brazil’s economy contracted in the third quarter for the
first time in more than two years, while industrial output fell
2.5 percent in November from a year earlier.  The yield on the interest rate futures contract maturing in
January 2013, the most traded in  Sao Paulo  today, fell one basis
point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 10.06 percent at 12:09 p.m.
in Brasilia. The real appreciated 0.8 percent to 1.8415 per
dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
