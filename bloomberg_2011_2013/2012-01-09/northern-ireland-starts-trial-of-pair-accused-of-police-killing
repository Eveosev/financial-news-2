The trial of two men accused of the
murder of a policeman in Northern Ireland three years ago opened
in  Belfast  today, with the prosecution alleging a tracking
device and forensics link the pair to the killing.  Brendan McConville, 40, and John Paul Wootton, 20, are
charged with killing policeman Stephen Carroll in Craigavon,
county Armagh, on March 9, 2009, after police were lured to an
estate in the town. Carroll was shot in the head as he sat in
his patrol car. Both men deny the charges.  The prosecution said a tracking device showed a car
owned by Wootton was in the area of the shooting when it took
place and left shortly afterward. Later investigations found the
car contained a coat that showed evidence of firearms residue. A
DNA profile on McConville was discovered on the coat.  Carroll was the first policeman to be killed in  Northern
Ireland  since the  Police Service of Northern Ireland  was formed
in 2001. Dissident republicans, who oppose Northern Ireland’s
peace process and its U.K. link, said they killed him, part of a
terrorist campaign to reignite a conflict that claimed more than
3,500 lives before largely ending with a 1998 peace deal.  Judge Paul Girvan, who is trying the case without a jury,
today denied a defense application to have evidence relating to
the tracking device ruled inadmissible. Wootton’s mother, Sharon
Wootton, is also charged with attempting to pervert the course
of justice. She denies the charge.  To contact the reporter on this story:
