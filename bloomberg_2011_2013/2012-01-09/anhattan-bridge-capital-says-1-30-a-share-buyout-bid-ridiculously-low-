Manhattan Bridge Capital Inc. (LOAN) , which
lends to investors in New York metropolitan area real estate,
received a takeover offer of $1.30 a share, or $5.62 million, a
bid the company dismissed as “ridiculously low.”  Investment firms Capstone Equities LLC and G Asset
Management made the offer on Dec. 29, a day after Manhattan
Bridge Capital shares closed at 90 cents, according to a
statement released by Capstone today. The firms said they urged
Great Neck, New York-based Manhattan Bridge Capital to hire an
investment bank to find a higher offer, be liquidated or both.  “Manhattan Bridge Capital is trading at a material
discount to its liquidation value,” Joshua Zamir, a Capstone
managing principal, said in the statement. “We believe the best
course of action is for the company to be taken private or
liquidated,”  Assaf Ran, Manhattan Bridge Capital’s chairman and chief
executive officer, said he doesn’t think the offer is serious
and has no plans to hire an investment bank.  “The offer is ridiculously low,” Ran said in a telephone
interview. The bid is about 50 percent of Manhattan Bridge
Capital’s book value, he said. “They are totally disregarding
the value of the business and the fact the company is profitable
and growing.”  Manhattan Bridge Capital will respond to Capstone and G
Asset Management in the next few days, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
