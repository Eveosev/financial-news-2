GT Advanced Technologies Inc. (GTAT) , a U.S.
supplier of solar manufacturing equipment, won an order for
$101.3 million of reactors and related systems to produce
polysilicon amid a worldwide glut of the main material in solar
cells.  The sale is GT Advanced’s first “to one of the large
incumbent polysilicon producers,” Chief Executive Officer Tom
Gutierrez said today in a statement. The order will be included
in the Merrimack, New Hampshire-based company’s backlog for the
third quarter of fiscal 2012, which ended Dec. 31.  The customer, which wasn’t named, signed an engineering
services contract with GT Advanced in its second fiscal quarter
and this is the first system purchase from the equipment maker.  Prices (SSPFPSNO)  for polysilicon fell 65 percent last year to $26.52
a kilogram at the end of December as production surged and
demand growth slowed for solar panels.  GT Advanced rose 0.1 percent to $7.61 at the close in  New
York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
