The cost of hauling  iron ore  and coal
fell to a four-month low, extending this year’s decline to 47
percent, amid concerns a Chinese economic slowdown will curb
steel production, the biggest driver of global shipping demand.  Rates to hire a capesize ship, the largest in the fleet of
dry-bulk vessels, dropped 6.1 percent to $14,535 a day,
according to the London-based Baltic Exchange. That’s less than
half the 2011 high of $32,889 reached on Dec. 12, according to
exchange data.  “Concerns about a Chinese economic slowdown mean that
there are real risks to weaker Chinese  steel production (CHMMCRST)  growth
in 2012, which the capesize sector is highly leveraged to,”
Natasha Boyden, an analyst at New York-based  Cantor Fitzgerald 
LP, wrote today in an e-mailed report.  The Baltic Dry Index, a measure of charter costs for four
classes of vessels, declined 2.9 percent to 1,308 points,
according to the exchange, which publishes rates for more than
50 maritime routes. That’s the lowest level since Aug. 15. The
gauge has fallen 25 percent in 2012, as earnings for the other
vessel types also declined, while at a lower pace than
capesizes.  A surge in new vessels being delivered from shipyards in
January will entrench hire costs for the fleet of 1,335 capesize
ships at current lows, Cantor Fitzgerald said. Rainy weather in
Australia and  Brazil , the largest exporters of iron ore, also
cut  shipments (AUITIROV)  amid falling demand ahead of the Chinese New Year
shutdown later this month, the investment bank said.  China ’s  steel production (IISICHIN)  has declined for six straight
months, falling to 49.8 million metric tons in November,
according to the most recent data from the World Steel
Association.  Seaborne Trade  Iron ore, coking coal used in steel making, and steel
products account for 51 percent of dry-bulk seaborne trade,
estimated at 3.4 billion tons in 2011, according to  Germany ’s
 DVB Bank SE (DVB) , which specializes in transportation lending. An
estimated 63 percent of the 1-billion tons of ore shipped by sea
in 2011 went to China, according to UBS AG.  There may be a “significant slowdown in the coming
months” in global steel production if the world economy slips
into recession, DVB said in a report Jan. 6. Chinese steel
production was expected to expand 11.6 percent to 700 million
tons in 2011, DVB forecast.  Weakening Chinese demand for ore in the past two weeks
contributed to the “freefall” in the Baltic Dry Index, BOCOM
International, a Hong Kong-based subsidiary of China’s Bank of
Communications Co., said in a report today. The index will
average 1,250 to 1,300 this year, as much as 19 percent lower
than 2011, as the oversupply of new ships weighs on freight
rates, BOCOM forecast.  Fleet Expansion  The dry bulk fleet will expand by 4.5 percent in the first
six months, driving hire costs lower,  Maritime Strategies
International Ltd . said in a report e-mailed Jan. 6. Capesize
rates won’t rise, on average, until March when they’ll reach
$18,000 a day, the London-based shipping consultancy said.  Contracts used to bet on or hedge future ore-shipping costs
for the first quarter of 2012 traded at $12,750 a day by 3:36
p.m. in London, according to Clarkson Securities Ltd.  Panamaxes, the largest ships that navigate the Panama
Canal, fell 2.1 percent to $12,020 a day, according to the
 Baltic Exchange . Supramax vessels, which carry about 25 percent
less cargo than panamaxes, slid 1.2 percent to $11,487 a day,
the lowest rate since Feb. 8. Handysize ships, the smallest
tracked by the index, fell 0.7 percent to $8,062.  To contact the reporter on this story:
