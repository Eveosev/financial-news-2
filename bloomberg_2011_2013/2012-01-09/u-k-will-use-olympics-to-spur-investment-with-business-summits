The U.K. government will host a
series of conferences and seminars during the London  Olympic
Games  to boost investment in Britain.  The meetings, starting with a Global Investment Conference
including central-bank governors, trade ministers and company
chiefs on July 26, will generate more than 1 billion pounds in
additional revenue for British businesses, the  U.K. Trade and
Investment  agency said in an e-mailed statement today.  “This summer’s Olympics will put the eyes of the world on
Britain as we host not just an unparalleled sporting spectacle,
but also a chance for companies from across the globe to
interact and do business here in the U.K.,” Prime Minister
 David Cameron  said. “We are working hard to make sure the whole
country can seize this once-in-a-generation opportunity.”  The program of meetings will run throughout the Olympic
Games, which start on July 27 and continue until Aug. 12, as
well as during the Paralympics between Aug. 29 and Sept. 9, UKTI
said.  Each day will be themed, including a day focused on China-
U.K. partnerships on July 28 and two days on “the journey to
smart energy” on Aug. 6 and 7. The list of summits published
today does not include one dedicated to financial services.  To contact the reporter on this story:
