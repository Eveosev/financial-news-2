The  European Central Bank ’s  financing (PLBLTOTL) 
to Portuguese lenders rose for a second month in December, the
Bank of  Portugal  said.  ECB financing increased to 46.0 billion euros ($58.7
billion) from 45.69 billion euros in November, the Lisbon-based
central bank said today on its website. ECB financing levels
peaked at 49.1 billion euros in August 2010.  Portugal in April became the third euro-area country to
seek a bailout after Greece and Ireland, and will receive 78
billion euros under the agreement with the  International
Monetary Fund  and the European Union. The aid plan earmarks 12
billion euros for Portugal’s lenders if needed.  As part of the aid plan, Portugal’s lenders were required
to raise Core Tier 1 capital ratios to 9 percent by the end of
2011 and 10 percent by the end of 2012. According to European
Banking Authority rules, they also need a 9 percent capital
ratio by the end of June after marking their sovereign debt
holdings to market prices.  The Portuguese central bank said on Dec. 8 that the
country’s lenders needed to raise 6.95 billion euros in capital
to meet the EBA target, which was calculated using figures from
the end of September. Since then Portuguese banks have carried
out capital increases to reduce their shortfalls.  To contact the reporter on this story:
