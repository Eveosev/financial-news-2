Rice exports (US42EXIN)  from  India , the world’s
second-largest producer, may more than double this year on a
record crop and as importers seek alternative to expensive
supplies from Thailand, a shippers’ group said.  Shipments, including aromatic basmati rice, may total 6
million metric tons in the year ending March 31, compared with
2.2 million tons a year earlier, said Vijay Setia, president of
the All India Rice Exporters’ Association. Traders have exported
more than 1.8 million tons of non-basmati rice since India ended
a three-year ban in September, he said.  Rising Indian exports may weigh on futures, which posted
the first annual gain in three years in Chicago in 2011, and
fill a shortfall in supplies from  Thailand . Cheaper rice, staple
for half the world’s population, may further cool global  food
costs (FAOFOODI) , which dropped for a fifth month in November, according to
the  United Nations .  “Higher exports from India are pulling global prices
lower,” Setia said. “India needs to ship value-added rice to
get better prices.”  Global rice harvest is forecast to rise 3 percent to 480.4
million tons in 2011, the United Nations’  Food and Agriculture
Organization  said Dec. 8. Rice futures in Chicago gained 4
percent last year after Thailand, the largest exporter, started
a state rice-buying policy at guaranteed prices in October even
as the worst floods since 1942 wreak damage on farms.  Thailand’s rice  exports (5787766)  may drop to 9 million tons in 2012
from an estimated 10 million tons a year earlier as the
government’s purchase boosts prices, Deputy Commerce Minister
Poom Sarapon said Dec. 23.  Stockpiles Increase  India won’t curb shipments as domestic stockpiles are
comfortable, Food Minister K.V. Thomas said last week. State
inventories climbed 16 percent to 29.7 million tons as of Jan. 1
from a year earlier, the Food Corp. of India said on Jan. 6.  “India will not think of a ban until it fears that local
prices are going to increase,” Ajay Jain, assistant vice
president at Almondz Commodities Ltd., said in by phone in New
Delhi. “The rice crop is good in India and other countries and
the global prices may remain stable.”  Rough-rice futures for March delivery advanced as much as
0.7 percent to $14.785 per 100 pounds on the  Chicago  Board of
Trade today and was at $14.705 at 9:26 a.m. in Mumbai.  Indian traders have contracted to ship 2.24 million tons of
basmati rice in the nine months through Dec. 31. more than the
2.16 million tons a year ago, Setia said. The contracts may rise
to 3.5 million tons for the full-year, while actual shipments
may be 2.5 million tons, he said.  Shipments fetched an average $968 a ton in 2011 as against
$1,110 a ton a year earlier, he said.  India may harvest a record 102 million tons in 2011-2012
season ending June after farmers boosted rice planting and the
crop escaped damage from floods or pest attacks, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
