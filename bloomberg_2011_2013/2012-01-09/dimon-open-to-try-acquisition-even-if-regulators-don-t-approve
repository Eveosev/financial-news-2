JPMorgan Chase & Co . Chief Executive
Officer  Jamie Dimon  said he would be willing to attempt a
takeover of another U.S. lender even if regulators weren’t
likely to approve.  “We would probably be willing to do something even if we
might end up with some egg in our face,” so long as the deal’s
price is attractive, said Dimon, 55, whose New York-based
company acquired Washington Mutual and Bear Stearns Cos. in
2008. JPMorgan is already the nation’s largest bank with $2.3
trillion in assets and is pushing up against rules that blocks
banks from controlling more than 10 percent of all deposits in
the U.S.  It would be “very hard” for the company to acquire a
failing institution in  Europe , Dimon said today at a JPMorgan
health-care conference in  San Francisco . It would be a
“catastrophe” if there was a disorderly breakup of the
European Union, he said.  “If it made a lot of sense, I’d go to the board and we
would have a conversation to see if it’s worth taking the
political risk,” Dimon said in an interview today with CNBC.  To contact the reporters on this story:
