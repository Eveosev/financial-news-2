Erdal Aksoy and Saffet Batu Aksoy
resigned from the executive board of  Petkim Petrokimya Holding
AS (PETKM) , Turkeyâ€™s biggest chemicals maker controlled by Socar &
Turcas Enerji AS, Petkim said in a statement to the Istanbul
Stock Exchange today.  Turcas Petrol AS (TRCAS) , a Turkish fuel retailer owned by Aksoy
Holding AS, sold its 25 percent stake in Socar & Turcas Enerji
to the State Oil Co. of Azerbaijan, known as Socar, on Dec. 30.
Turcas also bought 18.5 percent of Socar & Turcas Rafineri AS
from Socar & Turcas Enerji, as part of a plan to shift its
business from petrochemicals to fuel retailing and refining.  To contact the reporter on this story:
