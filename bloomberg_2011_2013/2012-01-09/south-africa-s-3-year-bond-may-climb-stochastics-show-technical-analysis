South African three-year bonds are
set to rally as a decline that pushed the yield to a three-week
high today is overdone, ETM Analytics said, citing trading
patterns.  The stochastic oscillator for the 13.5 percent securities
was 27.5 today, below the 30 threshold that signals the bonds
may have declined too fast and are poised the strengthen.  Stochastics “suggest the bond is oversold, and that the
yield may begin to moderate in the week ahead,”  George Glynos ,
an economist at Johannesburg-based ETM Analytics, wrote in e-
mailed comments. “We continue to maintain our bullish view of
South African benchmark bonds relative to U.S. Treasuries.”  The yield on the 2015 bonds rose 12 basis points since Jan.
3 to 6.87 percent, the highest since Dec. 20, as concern that
 Europe ’s debt crisis may spread to  Hungary  damped investor
appetite for riskier, emerging-market assets. Foreign investors
were net sellers of 607 million rand ($74 million) of South
African bonds last week, according to  JSE Ltd. data (SABO) .  Stochastics measure the price of a security relative to its
highs and lows during a particular period. A reading above 70
indicates a security may have weakened too much and could
appreciate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
