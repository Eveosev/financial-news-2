Rangers Football Club Plc (RFC) , the
Scottish soccer champions, may delist its shares in May, after
they were suspended from trading on the PLUS market today
because the club missed the year-end deadline for publication of
its audited accounts.  Rangers had been due to publish accounts for the year ended
June 30 by the end of 2011. The delay is because of the club’s
tax tribunal with the U.K. tax authorities, it said in a
statement today. The shares had traded at 12.5 pence before they
were suspended.  “The board is currently considering the merit of
maintaining its listing on the PLUS market after 6 May 2012
being the date 12 months following the acquisition of the 85.3
percent holding of the company by The Rangers FC Group Ltd.,”
it said in a statement.  Businessman Craig Whyte bought the club last year from
Scottish entrepreneur  David Murray .  HM Revenue & Customs  is
claiming 40 million pounds ($62 million) in unpaid taxes from
Rangers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
