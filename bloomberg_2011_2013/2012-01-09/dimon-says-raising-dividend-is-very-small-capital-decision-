JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  Chief Executive
Officer  Jamie Dimon  said raising the company’s 25-cent dividend
wouldn’t have as much impact on capital as other measures.  The bank may renew a stock-buyback program at least as big
as last year, when the New York-based company repurchased $8
billion of shares, Dimon said today in an interview with CNBC.
Acquiring shares is generally a faster way to distribute more
capital to shareholders than increasing dividends, he said.  Raising the dividend is “a very small capital decision
relative to other capital decisions,” he said.  Dimon, 55, said he supports buying back shares when the
price falls below intrinsic value. The bank is trading below
book value, meaning investors believe the firm is worth less
than its stated assets. The stock has  fallen (JPM)  34 percent from a
high in May 2007 to $35.30 on the  New York  Stock Exchange today.  “We’re not the kind of people that will buy back stock at
any price,” Dimon said. “We prefer to spend that money when
the stock is cheap, but it may not be so cheap by the time we
have the opportunity to do that.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
