Josh McDaniels  rejoined the  New
England  Patriots as an offensive assistant, a day after
offensive coordinator Bill O’Brien left to take over as the head
football coach at Penn State.  McDaniels was the St. Louis Rams’ offensive coordinator
last season, the same role he held with the Patriots from 2006
through the 2008 National Football League season. He was an
assistant on coach Bill Belichick’s staff from 2001-08.  McDaniels will be an assistant through the end of the
season, the Patriots said in a  statement .  New England is the top seed in the American Football
Conference and the Patriots will host the  Denver Broncos  on Jan.
14 in the second round of the NFL playoffs. McDaniels was the
Broncos’ head coach in 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
