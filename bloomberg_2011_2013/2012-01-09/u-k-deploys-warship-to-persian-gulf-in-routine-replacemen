The U.K.’s Royal Navy said it’s
deploying one of its most modern destroyers, HMS Daring, to the
 Persian Gulf  in a “long planned” and “routine” replacement
of another ship.  The move is not in reaction to developments in relation to
 Iran , a navy spokesman, who declined to be identified in line
with government policy, said in a telephone interview today,
confirming a report in the Daily Telegraph newspaper.  Iran has threatened to close the strategically important
Straits of Hormuz in retaliation for sanctions over its nuclear
program. The EU is discussing imposing a ban in Iranian oil
imports when foreign ministers meet on Jan. 30.  “The Royal Navy has had a continuous presence East of Suez
for many years, including the Armilla patrol and its successors
since 1980,” the Ministry of Defense said in an e-mailed
statement. “While the newly operational Type 45 destroyer  HMS
Daring  is more capable than earlier ships, her deployment East
of Suez has been long planned, is entirely routine and replaces
a frigate on station.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
