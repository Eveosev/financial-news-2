Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  said U.S.
and Asian lenders will boost their share of commodity trade
financing as European banks curb loans, making disruptions in
the markets unlikely while traders’ borrowing costs may rise.  Jeffrey Currie , head of commodities research, commented
today in an interview in  London .  “Thus far there is not much evidence of significant market
disruptions due to a lack of trade credits in Asia and America.
The core of disruptions seems to be within the European Union.
The overall stock of trade credits is unlikely to change
significantly, only the ownership, as European banks exit these
businesses and sell them to the U.S. or Asian buyers.  ‘‘Ultimately, after the transfers are completed, the
lasting impact is that it will likely cost more for commodity
operators to access this type of funding.’’  On the impact of trade finance difficulties on different
markets:  ‘‘Commodities are being impacted equally by the trade
finance problems, but the price reactions have been different.
This is because size of the impact relative to the market is
different and the underlying fundamental stories are different.  ‘‘Oil has much tighter inventories and is a much larger
global market, so it’s not reacting to the same degree as the
smaller markets. Other markets, say copper or aluminum, were
much harder hit because they are smaller markets, more exposed
to  Europe  and they have higher inventory levels from which de-
stocking could occur.’’  To contact the reporter on this story:
