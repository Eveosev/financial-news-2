The world’s first online
contemporary-art fair is set to expand with three new events in
2012, following the hiring of a new chief executive officer,
director and technical team.  The first edition of the VIP Art Fair, held last January,
was billed as an unprecedented event where collectors were able
to access 2,000 works and connect with more than 130 dealers
from 30 countries. The debut suffered from teething problems
such as a jammed chat system.  After that, 25 percent of the first-time participants --
including Michael Werner Gallery and L&M Arts from  New York  --
haven’t returned. Big names such as Gagosian,  White Cube  and
Hauser & Wirth remain among about 115 dealers signed up for VIP
2.0, which previews on Feb. 2.  “We’ve now hired our own in-house technical team and have
completely re-architected the site,” Lisa Kennedy, the fair’s
new chief executive, said in a telephone interview. “It will
now be able to handle a lot more traffic and many more
simultaneous queries.”  VIP will also be holding events devoted to works on paper
and photography running from April 20-22 and July 13-15
respectively. A three-day “Vernissage” (preview) will be held
from Sept. 7-9, the fair said today in an e-mailed statement.  “The Vernissage will be a smaller, shorter event in which
dealers spread the word about what’s new and fresh before the
Fall season starts,” said Kennedy. VIP is hoping for about 50
dealers at this weekend event, she said.  The fair has received angel funding from two international
art collectors. Selmo Nissenbaum, based in  Brazil , and the
Australian Philip Keir, have invested a total of $1 million, VIP
said in the statement.  Kennedy, 43, was hired in October from Quidsi Inc., a
subsidiary of Amazon.com Inc., where she had been executive
vice-president of e-commerce. Liz Parks, a former head of sales
at Artnet, has been appointed director of the fair.  VIP 2.0 will be open online through Feb. 8.  Freud Collection  A private collection of prints by  Lucian Freud , who died at
the age of 88 in July last year, may sell for as much as 1.5
million pounds ($2.31 million) at an auction next month.  The 45 etchings are being sold at  Christie’s International (CHRS) 
by Marc Balakjian, proprietor of north London-based Studio
Prints. The stand-alone Feb. 15 auction will include six further
etchings on loan from the printers’ archive.  Balakjian collaborated for more than 25 years with Freud,
who would etch his subjects directly from life with the copper
plate on an easel. Editions range in size from 10 to 50 prints.  The auction includes “Woman Sleeping,” a study of Sue
Tilley, the model for Freud’s “Benefits Supervisor Sleeping,”
which sold for a record $33.6 million in 2008. The print, dating
from 1995, is valued at 30,000 pounds to 50,000 pounds.  Freud’s 1987 etching of U.K. lawyer Arnold Goodman in
yellow pajamas -- the only print to include color -- and the
2000 study of a pet whippet, “Pluto Aged Twelve,” both carry a
low estimate of 50,000 pounds.  Bordeaux Test  The auction market for top Bordeaux will be tested on Jan.
25 when a European collection of more than 6,000 bottles comes
under the hammer at Sotheby’s in London with an estimate of 1.4
million pounds to 1.8 million pounds. The event follows a trio
of wine sales in  Hong Kong  valued at more than $25 million.  The auction also comes after a year in which the benchmark
 Liv-ex Fine Wine 100 index (LIVX)  declined 15 percent. The collection
spans five decades from 1953 to 1995 and includes more than 100
cases from the highly rated 1982 vintage.  Price Outlook  “We’re in a period of consolidation,”  Miles Davis ,
partner at Wine Asset Managers LLP, said in an interview.
“People are still wondering if prices have hit the bottom yet.
We are following a similar pattern to 2008 and 2009. I suspect 
the market will improve by the end of the year.”  Asian buyers, who dominate the auction market for fine
wines, were unwilling to pay ever-higher prices for First Growth
Bordeaux in 2011.  Sotheby’s (BID)  2012 estimates have been adjusted
accordingly.  Cases of Chateau Lafite-Rothschild 1982 carry minimum
valuations of 22,000 pounds and 16,000 pounds each. The same
wine was selling for a record HK$1.03 million ($132,700) a case
at Sotheby’s, Hong Kong, in October 2010.  A case of Chateau Petrus 1982 is the most valuable lot in
the collection, with an estimate of 36,000 pounds to 44,000
pounds. The most affordable is a double magnum of Chateau Clinet
1986 at 160 pounds to 220 pounds.  (Scott Reyburn writes about the art market for Muse, the
