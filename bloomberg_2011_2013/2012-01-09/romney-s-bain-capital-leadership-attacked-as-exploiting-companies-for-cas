For months,  Mitt Romney  has seldom
been challenged on his claim that his leadership at Bain Capital
LLC offers evidence that he knows how to create jobs. That has
ended as his Republican rivals are accusing him of exploiting
companies and firing workers in a quest to make millions.  “Those of us who believe in free markets and those of us
who believe that, in fact, the whole goal of investment is
entrepreneurship and job creation, would find it pretty hard to
justify rich people figuring out clever, legal ways to loot out
a company,” former U.S. House Speaker  Newt Gingrich  told
reporters in Manchester, New Hampshire, yesterday, ahead of the
state’s Jan. 10 presidential primary.  Gingrich’s charges will be amplified in  South Carolina , the
next primary state, with a 30-minute, independently produced
television advertisement bought by a political action committee
run by his former aides called “Winning Our Future” and funded
by supporters, according to  Rick Tyler , an adviser to the PAC
and onetime Gingrich campaign spokesman. The trailer for the ad
posted on a website calls Romney a “corporate raider” and says
he’s akin to others on Wall Street motivated primarily by greed.  The Gingrich attack, echoed during the weekend by other
Republican candidates, marks the first time the field of a half-
dozen contenders has taken aim at him on this issue. Romney, who
also sought the nomination in 2008, won the Jan. 3 Iowa caucuses
by eight votes and is favored to win in  New Hampshire .  Firing People  Romney, speaking to business leaders in Nashua, New
Hampshire, this morning, extolled the virtues of the free
market, in a comment likely to be seized upon by his opponents.  “I like being able to fire people who provide services to
me,” he said, speaking about the need to change the delivery of
health care in the U.S. “If someone doesn’t give me a good
service that I need, I want to say I’m going to go get someone
else to provide that service to me.”  Gingrich is seeking to stop Romney’s momentum before the
primaries in South Carolina on Jan. 21 and  Florida  on Jan. 31.
Enhancing the Gingrich-aligned PAC’s ability to run the ad is a
$5 million donation to Winning Our Future from  Sheldon Adelson ,
a longtime supporter of the former speaker. That contribution
was confirmed yesterday, on condition of anonymity, by a person
close to Adelson, chairman of  Las Vegas Sands Corp. (LVS)   Tyler said no date has been scheduled for when the attack
ad will run in South Carolina.  ‘Corporate Mugger’  “Mitt Romney is not a capitalist,” Tyler said of the
former private-equity executive and onetime Massachusetts
governor. “He is a predatory corporate mugger. If you ever
wonder why so many manufacturing jobs are overseas, you need to
look no further than Mitt Romney. He can claim thousands of jobs
created, only those jobs were created in  Mexico  and  Southeast
Asia .”  Adelson was the biggest donor to Gingrich’s former
political committee, American Solutions for Winning the Future,
contributing $7 million, according to the Center for Responsive
Politics, a Washington-based research group. He already gave the
maximum $2,500 to Gingrich’s presidential campaign.  Eddie Mahe , a Republican strategist not associated with any
campaign, said Adelson’s donation could be a game-changer for
the underfunded Gingrich.  “They can buy prime time with that kind of money on every
station in South Carolina two or three times,” Mahe said.
“Clearly, they have the financial capacity to saturate South
Carolina and maybe even through Florida.”  ‘Happy to Discuss’  A Romney aide said the criticism by Gingrich is similar to
that aired by President  Barack Obama  and groups such as
Moveon.org that oppose Republicans.  “It’s surprising that it’s coming in the Republican
primary, but that’s fine,” said Romney strategist Stuart Stevens. “We’re happy to discuss it anytime.”  The Gingrich assault is a moment of payback. He was rising
in the polls before the Jan. 3  Iowa  caucuses until an outside
committee run by former Romney aides, Restore Our Future, began
running negative ads. Overall, the PAC and the Romney campaign
spent an estimated $3.7 million on ads through Jan. 5, according
to New York-based Kantar Media’s CMAG. Gingrich and Winning Our
Future spent $628,640 in the same time frame.  In December, 45 percent of all ads airing in Iowa
criticized Gingrich. After leading opinion polls from mid-
November to mid-December, he finished fourth in Iowa.  ‘Insult’ to Campaign  Gingrich isn’t the only Republican to seize on Romney’s
Bain experience for criticism.  Former Pennsylvania Senator  Rick Santorum  questioned
whether Romney’s business background prepared him for the
presidency during a debate in Manchester on Jan. 7. And onetime
Utah Governor Jon Huntsman Jr., campaigning in New Hampshire
today, described Romney as out of touch with “the economic
realities.”  Speaking today in Anderson, South Carolina, Texas Governor
Rick Perry said it was an “insult” for Romney to campaign in
the southern state after Bain’s work caused the downsizing of
companies there.  In an effort to neutralize the attacks, Romney is seeking
to cast himself as an average worker who had, at times, feared
losing his job.  “I know what it’s like to worry whether you’re going to
get fired,” he told voters in Rochester, New Hampshire. “There
were a couple of times I worried whether I was going to get a
pink slip.”  ‘Other People’s Money’  His campaign was unable to provide examples of when Romney
-- a multimillionaire whose father, George, was chief executive
officer of American Motors Corp. and a former Michigan governor
-- was afraid of getting fired.  Romney, who spent most of his career at Bain, has begun
detailing some of his work at the firm, a period of his life
that he’s previously referred to only in vague terms.  Addressing hundreds of voters gathered in the Rochester
opera house, Romney focused on the  venture capital  investments
he made, rather than the private equity buyouts for which his
firm is best known.  “For a while I worked in what’s called venture capital --
what is that?” he asked the crowd of voters, describing how he
used investment capital to develop small companies. “When you
have other people’s money and your own invested in something,
you’re very careful with it.”  He recounted stocking shelves in the first Staples store
and the company’s early office, a low-budget affair with
naugahyde chairs and an old table.  Job Creator  Bain invested a total of $5 million in Staples, said
Romney. The firm made $13 million when the company went public
in 1989. Today, Staples is the world’s largest office supply
company with 90,000 employees and a presence in more than 26
countries.  Romney has also argued that he created more jobs than he
eliminated through Bain’s deals.  In a Jan. 6 interview with Bloomberg Television, Romney
said he had created “well over 100,000 more jobs than those
that were lost.”  That number is an estimate, since Bain doesn’t track the
total jobs created by its investments and won’t release complete
information about the deals made during Romney’s time there.  Dade Behring  A Bloomberg News review of several Bain deals during
Romney’s tenure found that not all Bain’s investments were
beneficial for workers. Several companies ran into trouble,
laying off hundreds of workers, filing for bankruptcy, facing
federal fines, or lawsuits from shareholders who said they were
misled by management. One example was Dade Behring Inc., a
Deerfield, Illinois-based medical-testing company, where Bain
cut least 1,600 jobs after taking over the company.  The  Wall Street  Journal reported today that it looked at 77
businesses in which Bain invested during Romney’s time there to
assess his record. It found that 22 percent of the companies
either filed for bankruptcy or shut down by the eighth year
after the Bain investment. The newspaper also found that Bain
produced excellent returns for its investors, although most of
the gains came from just 10 deals.  At the Romney event in Nashua, today, union officials
questioned whether Romney understood the impact of layoffs.  “There are real people working at those companies,” said
Julie Kushner, an executive with the  United Auto Workers . “When
their jobs fail they have nowhere to go. I don’t think he gets
that part.”  ‘Story of Greed’  Allies of Gingrich are seizing on stories of job losses.
The almost three-minute trailer for the web-video, now on a
Winning Our Future website, kingofbain.com, calls the movie “a
story of greed” and includes interviews with people who worked
at companies taken over by Bain.  The ad was made by Republican strategist Jason Meath, a
former partner in a firm that made commercials for Romney’s 2008
campaign. Tyler said the PAC bought the film from Meath.  “Wall Street’s corporate raiders made billions of
dollars,” the narrator says. “This film is about one such
raider and his firm.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
