(Corrects spelling of Mogadishu in headline.)  Somalia ’s rebel al-Shabaab group
accused Djiboutian forces of shelling a mosque in the Somali
capital, Mogadishu, and threatened to retaliate, Shabelle News
reported.  An unspecified number of people were killed and injured in
the attack on the al-Hidaya mosque on Jan. 7, the Mogadishu-
based agency said today, citing Sheikh Mohamed Abu Abdirahman,
the representative for al-Shabaab in the Banadir region.  Djiboutian soldiers form part of the African Union Mission
in Somalia, which has almost 10,000 peacekeepers in the Horn of
Africa country. The mission said in an e-mailed statement on
Jan. 8 that it was investigating the incident in which a cleric
was killed and “several” other people were injured.  To contact the reporter on this story:
