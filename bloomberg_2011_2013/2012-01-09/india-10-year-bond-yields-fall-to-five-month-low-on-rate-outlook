India ’s 10-year bonds gained for a
third day, pushing yields to a five-month low, on speculation
the central bank will start easing monetary policy as growth and
 inflation (INFINFY)  slow.  Benchmark 10-year yields, which rose 65 basis points last
year as the  Reserve Bank of India  boosted its repurchase  rate (INRPYLD) 
seven times, have declined 37 basis points in 2012. The central
bank may cut the amount of cash lenders must set aside as
reserves by 50 basis points from 6 percent on Jan. 24 and then
follow up with a reduction in borrowing costs in the weeks after
that, according to J. Moses Harding, an executive vice president
at IndusInd Bank Ltd. in Mumbai.  “A reversal in the rate cycle is on the cards as the
growth and inflation numbers are giving some comfort to the
 Reserve Bank ” that there is room to cut rates, Harding said.
“That outlook is bullish for bonds.”  The yield on the 8.79 percent bonds due November 2021 fell
three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 8.20 percent in
Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading system. That is
the lowest level for benchmark 10-year rates since Aug. 10.  The wholesale-price index rose 7.68 percent in December,
less than 9.11 percent in November and the slowest pace in two
years, according to a Bloomberg survey of economists before data
due next week. Industrial  production (INPIINDY)  contracted 5.1 percent in
October from a year earlier, the first drop since June 2009,
official data show.  Economic growth in  Asia ’s third largest economy will be
about 7 percent this year ending March 31, Prime Minister
 Manmohan Singh  said yesterday, less than a December prediction
of 7.5 percent.  The cost of one-year interest-rate swaps, or derivative
contracts used to guard against fluctuations in funding costs,
rose three basis points to 7.76 percent, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
