Abu Dhabi  stocks retreated the most
in almost three weeks paced by  Emirates Telecommunications  Corp.
on speculation fourth-quarter earnings may disappoint.  Emirates Telecommunications, the  United Arab Emirates ’
biggest telephone company known as Etisalat, decreased 1.3
percent.  National Bank of Abu Dhabi (NBAD) , the country’s second-
biggest bank by assets known as NBAD, dropped the most in almost
11 months. Abu Dhabi’s  ADX General Index (ADSMI)  declined 1.1 percent,
the most since Dec. 21, to 2,360.96 at the 2 p.m. close in the
emirate. The  Bloomberg GCC 200 Index (BGCC200)  slipped 0.5 percent.  “There aren’t very big expectations from market
participants for fourth-quarter results,” said Sebastien Henin,
who helps oversee $100 million at The National Investor in Abu
Dhabi. “Unless there is a major local catalyst, we expect
markets to remain trading sideways.”  Etisalat, the company with the  heaviest weighting (ETISALAT)  on Abu
Dhabi’s stock index, may report earnings on Feb. 9. The phone
company’s fourth-quarter income may decline 5 percent from the
year earlier to 1.91 billion dirhams ($520 million), according
to an  estimate (ETISALAT)  by Beltone Financial Holding. Etisalat’s third-
quarter profit fell 1 percent as expenses increased.  The company’s shares retreated 1.3 percent to 9.03 dirhams,
the lowest level since Dec. 22. Last year, the stock slumped 15
percent, compared with a 12 percent decline in the general
index. NBAD fell 3.7 percent to 10.45 dirhams today.  Saudi Arabia ’s Tadawul All Share Index fell 0.4 percent and
Qatar’s  QE Index (DSM)  decreased 0.2 percent. Kuwait’s  gauge (KWSEIDX)  lost 0.5
percent, Oman’s benchmark stock  index (MSM30)  declined 0.1 percent and
Bahrain’s  measure (BHSEASI)  retreated 0.3 percent. The  DFM General Index (DFMGI) 
climbed less than 0.1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
