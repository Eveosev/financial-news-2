The lira climbed to its highest level
in a month as the central bank sold dollars and JPMorgan Chase
& Co. said it favored  Turkey ’s currency over the South African
rand.  The Turkish currency appreciated 0.5 percent to 1.8696 per
dollar at 2:54 p.m. in Istanbul, rising for a second day and
heading for the highest level since Dec. 9. The lira has gained
1.1 percent this year, making it the best-performing among
emerging-market currencies in  Europe , the Middle East and
 Africa , according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The lira weakened the most among emerging-market currencies
last year, down 18 percent, as inflation ended last year at
10.5% which was twice the central bank’s target. The bank has
spent $15 billion to prop up the lira since August. It refrained
from providing funds to banks today at its lower 5.75 percent
one-week repo funding rate, signaling continuation of tight
monetary policy.  “The central bank’s backstop for the lira is stronger than
ever while official policy support for the rand remains weak,’
JPMorgan said in a weekly report on  emerging markets  published
Jan. 6.  Investors should buy the lira at  4.33 rand per lira (TRYZAR)  and
exit after the  exchange rate  rises 6.3 percent to 4.60,
according to JPMorgan. The central bank sold $150 million today
in two additional auctions of $50m each under a policy announced
Dec. 6 and a regular sale of $50m.  If the lira price action becomes unfavorable, the
investment bank suggested investors abandon th trade at 4.15.
The lira weakened 0.2 percent against the rand to 4.3599, down
for a fifth day.  Yields on two-year Turkish debt dropped 19 basis points, or
0.19 percentage point, to 11.27 percent, in its biggest decline
since Dec. 29, a Turk Ekonomi Bankasi index of the securities
showed.  To contact the reporters on this story:
