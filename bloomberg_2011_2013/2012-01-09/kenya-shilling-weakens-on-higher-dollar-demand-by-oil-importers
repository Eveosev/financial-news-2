Kenya ’s shilling depreciated for the
second day on increased dollar demand from oil importers.  The currency of  East Africa ’s biggest economy weakened as
much as 0.8 percent to 87.65 per dollar and traded 0.4 percent
down at 87.35 at 2:12 p.m. in Nairobi.  “The shilling has weakened due to increased dollar demand
by oil importers,” John Muli, a trader at Nairobi based African
Banking Corp., said in a phone interview today.  Kenya’s central bank accepted all of the 3.05 billion
shillings ($34.9 million) of bids it received for seven-day
 repurchase agreements , after offering 3 billion shillings, said
a trader at the Nairobi-based bank. The bank accepted the offers
at a rate of 17.508 percent, the trader said.  In a repurchase agreement an investor agrees to sell a
security to another trader, while at the same time arranging to
buy it back at a future date and at a pre-determined price.  The Tanzanian shilling gained for a second day, the longest
winning streak this year, as the central bank sold dollars.  The currency appreciated 0.1 percent to 1,588 per dollar at
2:02 p.m. in  Dar es Salaam , the commercial capital, the longest
streak since Dec 29.  “The central bank has intervened selling dollars to the
market today, and more inflows are coming in from the non-
governmental organisations,” Hamis Mwakibete, Head Trading
Commercial Bank of Africa Tanzania Ltd., said by phone from Dar
es Salaam, the commercial Capital.  Uganda ’s currency remained unchanged at 2,455 to the
dollar.  To contact the reporters on this story:
