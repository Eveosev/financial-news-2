Delek Drilling-LP (DEDRL)  and its partners in
 Israel ’s Tamar gas field signed a $5 billion agreement to supply
Dalia Power Energies Ltd. with natural gas for 17 years.  Dalia will begin receiving gas in the second half of 2014,
Netanya, Israel-based Delek Drilling and its partners said in a
filing today with the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange. Israel is
encouraging the development of independent power producers to
introduce competition in a market monopolized by state-owned
Israel Electric Corp.  “This is one of several deals that we expect to come,”
Richard Gussow, an analyst at Deutsche Bank AG in Tel Aviv, said
by telephone today. “The price is in line with the market. The
new IPPs will be fairly significant customers of the natural
gas.”  Tel Aviv-based Dalia Power is building a power station
using natural gas at the Tzafit site in central Israel. Once
completed, the plant would supply some 8 percent of national
energy consumption, making it one of the country’s  biggest
privately operated  power stations, Dalia said on its website.  Delek Drilling rose 1.3 percent to 14.68 shekels at 10:04
a.m. in  Tel Aviv . The TA-25 benchmark index rose 0.1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
