An Afghan army soldier opened fire on
U.S. troops during a game of volleyball, killing one of the men
and wounding three others, an Afghan official said today.  The shooting at a joint military base yesterday erupted
after a “verbal dispute,” Mohammad Jan Rasoul Yar, the deputy
governor of Zabul province, where the incident took place, said
by phone today. The Afghan gunman was shot dead by American
service personnel, he said.  The U.S.-led  International Security Assistance Force  in
 Afghanistan  confirmed an incident last night in an e-mailed
statement during which one of its soldiers was killed
“apparently by a member of the Afghan National Army.”  The Taliban have claimed in the past to have infiltrated
Afghan forces to carry out attacks on international troops or
government officials. Two French soldiers were shot dead Dec. 6
when an Afghan soldier opened fire on them in Kapisa province
north of Kabul, the capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
