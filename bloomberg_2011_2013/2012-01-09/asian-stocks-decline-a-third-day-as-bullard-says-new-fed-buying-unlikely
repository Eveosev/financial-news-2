(Corrects job title in third paragraph of story that
originally ran Jan. 9.)  Asian  stocks (MXAPJ)  reversed losses as
shares of Chinese lenders and developers rallied after  China ’s
new lending and money supply increased. Exporters dropped after
a  Federal Reserve  official said the central bank probably won’t
begin a new round of bond purchases.  Samsung Electronics Co. (005930) , the world’s second-biggest maker
of mobile phones by sales, decreased 2.3 percent in  Seoul .  HTC
Corp. (2498)  sank 5.2 percent in Taipei as the maker of smartphones
posted its first drop in quarterly profit in two years.
Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd. and China Overseas
Land & Investment Ltd. led a rally among China’s lenders and
developers as the new loans and money supply data stoked
speculation the government is already taking steps to ease a
cash crunch.  “It shows the government’s policy of fine-tuning monetary
policies is taking effect,”  Ha Jiming , vice chairman and chief
investment strategist in Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s investment
management division for China, said in an interview  with
Bloomberg Television today. “The government is able to engineer
a soft landing, maintaining economic growth at around 8 percent.
The market this year will have some opportunities.”  The  MSCI Asia Pacific excluding Japan Index (MXAPJ)  gained 0.2
percent to 397.04 as of 6:44 p.m. in  Hong Kong , erasing losses
of as much as 1.3 percent earlier. The measure gained 0.9
percent last week as manufacturing growth from the U.S.,
 Australia , China and  India  added to signs the global economy may
withstand  Europe ’s debt crisis.  Australia’s  S&P/ASX 200 Index (AS51)  lost 0.1 percent after the
country’s retail sales unexpectedly stalled. South Korea’s Kospi
Index dropped 0.9 percent. The Philippine Stock Exchange Index
jumped to a five-month high after central bank chief Amando
Tetangco said he anticipates easing monetary policy this
quarter.  Shanghai Share Rally  China’s Shanghai Composite Index climbed 2.9 percent on
speculation the government is taking steps to improve liquidity
as the economy slows. Hong Kong’s  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  gained 1.5
percent, reversing earlier losses of as much as 1.6 percent.
Japanese markets were closed today for a holiday.  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPH2)  climbed 0.1
percent, erasing losses of as much as 0.5 percent today. The
gauge fell 0.3 percent in  New York  on Jan. 6 as a drop in the
U.S. unemployment rate to 8.5 percent, the lowest since February
2009, failed to extend a weekly rally.  Exporters to the U.S. declined after Bullard said the
Federal Reserve “probably could wait and see for now” before
deciding whether there is a need for more accommodative
policies.  Europe Risk Remains  Samsung Electronics dropped 2.3 percent to 1.016 million
won in Seoul.  James Hardie Industries SE (JHX) , a building materials
supplier that counts the U.S. as its biggest market, lost 0.7
percent to A$6.70 in Sydney.  “An improving U.S. economy doesn’t necessarily mean we’re
firmly in a recovery,” said Lee King Fuei, a Singapore-based
fund manager at Schroders Plc, which oversees about $326 billion
of assets globally. “The question is how sustainable that will
be. Europe remains a risk. We’ll probably see more pain before
we see a resolution.”  German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President
Nicolas Sarkozy will meet today in Berlin for the first time in
2012 as they seek to craft a plan to rescue the euro over the
next three months.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  lost 17 percent in 2011 as
China took steps to cool its property market and Europe
struggled to resolve its debt crisis. The  S&P 500  Index broke
even for the year and the Stoxx Europe 600 Index dropped 11
percent. Stocks in the Asian gauge were valued at 12 times
estimated earnings on average as of Jan. 6, compared with 12.1
times for the S&P 500 and 9.9 times for the Stoxx 600.  Smartphone Rivals  HTC, Asia’s second-largest smartphone maker, dropped 5.2
percent to NT$457 in Taipei. The company said fourth-quarter net
income dropped 26 percent from a year earlier to NT$11 billion
($364 million) amid competition from Apple Inc. and Samsung
Electronics.  E Ink Holdings Inc. (8069) , a Taiwanese maker of liquid crystal
displays, sank 6.9 percent to NT$35.75, the most on the MSCI
Asia Pacific Excluding Japan Index. The company’s December sales
slid 84 percent from a year earlier to NT$365.70 million.  Among stocks that advanced, ICBC, the world’s biggest
lender by market value, climbed 2.8 percent to HK$4.84 in Hong
Kong. China Construction Bank Corp., the nation’s No. 2 lender,
gained 2 percent to HK$5.54.  China Overseas Land (688) , the largest
Chinese developer listed in Hong Kong, rose 2.7 percent to
HK$12.74.  China Resources Land Ltd. (1109) , a state-owned real estate
company, increased 2 percent to HK$12.32.  ‘Soft Landing’  Chinese new loans totaled 640.5 billion yuan ($101 billion)
last month, the highest amount since April, the People’s Bank of
China said in a statement yesterday. That exceeded the estimates
of all 18 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. M2, a measure of
money supply, rose 13.6 percent, the fastest pace since July, it
said. That compared with the 12.9 percent median of 18
estimates.  “This is better-than-expected monetary data, suggesting
monetary conditions have started to ease,” said Liu Li-Gang, a
Hong Kong-based economist with Australia & New Zealand Banking
Group Ltd., who previously worked at the World Bank. Liu said he
expects that the central bank may cut the reserve requirement
again before the Lunar New Year on Jan. 23. “Such easing will
help ensure a soft landing for the Chinese economy,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
