William Daley  is resigning as
President Barack Obama’s chief of staff and will be replaced by
White House budget director  Jacob Lew , administration officials
said.  Obama plans to announce the changes in a statement at the
White House, according to the officials, who weren’t authorized
to comment publicly.  The switch won’t happen until the end of the month, as Lew
is finishing the administration’s budget proposal to Congress
due to be presented in the first week in February. Daley’s
resignation was earlier reported by the Los Angeles Times.  Daley, 63, has been scaling back his White House role for
months. In November, he handed off some day-to-day management
duties to Peter Rouse, a senior adviser to the president. In
October, he said he planned to leave the administration after
the 2012 elections.  Daley, a former JPMorgan Chase & Co. executive and U.S.
Commerce secretary, was brought to the White House in January
2011 to improve relations with the business community after the
2010 midterm elections, in which Democrats lost control of the
 House of Representatives .  Obama named Lew as his director of the Office of Management
and Budget in July 2010. Lew, 56, previously served in the State
Department and he was budget director under former President
 Bill Clinton .  To contact the reporter on this story:
