Amgen Inc. (AMGN) , the world’s largest
biotechnology company, will see revenue accelerate this year as
sales of its cancer medicines grow and win wider regulatory
approval, the next chief executive officer said.  Robert Bradway, the company’s president and chief
operating officer, will replace CEO Kevin Sharer, who is
retiring, in May. By then, the  Thousand Oaks , California-based
company is expecting U.S. regulators to have decided whether to
expand the use of its drug Xgeva to include preventing or
delaying the spread of prostate cancer to bones.  Xgeva, already approved by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration to reduce fractures in cancer patients, and
Prolia, used to treat osteoporosis in menopausal women, exceeded
$500 million in revenue in 2011, their first full year on the
market, Bradway said today at JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s annual
health-care conference in  San Francisco .  Adding a new use for Xgeva “is an important new
opportunity,” Bradway said, without specifying how much an
approval would add to sales. “The biggest opportunity by far
and for us in 2012 is to continue to grow the market.”  Amgen shares have gained 13 percent in the past 12 months,
short of the 21 percent jump gained by the Standard and Poor’s
Supercomposite Biotechnology Index. The company’s stock fell
less than 1 percent to $64.20 at 4 p.m. in  New York .  Analysts have said they expect Xgeva sales to reach $1.78
billion by 2014, the average estimate in a Bloomberg survey.
Overall revenue will likely increase 3 percent to $16.02 billion
this year from $15.51 billion in 2011, the analysts estimated.  Amgen has also sought to protect its former core anemia
therapies, Aranesp and Epogen, from further declines and new
challengers by locking buyers into long-term contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
