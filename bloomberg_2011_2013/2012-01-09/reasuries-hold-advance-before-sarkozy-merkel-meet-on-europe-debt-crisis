U.S. two-year swap spreads narrowed
to the least in a month after a Federal Reserve report showed
 consumer credit (CICRTOT)  surged by the most in 10 years, signaling
households are more willing to borrow and spend.  Treasuries, which were little changed today, have failed to
extend 2011’s rally as the world’s biggest economy shows signs
of improving. Benchmark 10-year yields were still within 30
basis points of the record low, reflecting demand for the
relative safety of America’s debt during the European fiscal
crisis. The U.S. is scheduled to auction $32 billion of three-
year notes today, after a sale of the securities last month drew
record bidding.  “The flight to quality continues, and that is keeping
yields low,” said Hiroki Shimazu, an economist in  Tokyo  at SMBC
Nikko Securities Inc., a unit of  Japan ’s third-largest publicly
traded bank by assets. “It’s difficult to say when yields will
rise, but the time is getting near because the  U.S. economy  is
expanding.”  Ten-year  rates (USGG10YR)  rose one basis point to 1.97 percent as of
10:45 a.m. in Tokyo, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices.
The 2 percent security maturing in November 2021 declined 3/32,
or 94 cents per $1,000 face amount, to 100 1/4. The yield slid
to 1.67 percent on Sept. 23, the least ever.  Narrower Spread  The  difference (USSP2)  between two-year swap rates and the yield on
same maturity Treasuries shrank to 39 basis points today, the
least since Dec. 8.  Investors use swaps to exchange fixed and floating
interest-rate obligations. The difference, the gap between the
fixed component and the Treasury rate, is a gauge of investor
demand for higher-yielding assets versus sovereign debt.  Japan’s 10-year rate held at 0.98 percent, declining from
1.2 percent a year ago.  U.S.  consumer credit  increased by $20.4 billion in
November, the most since November 2001, Fed figures showed
yesterday in  Washington . The  unemployment rate  fell to 8.5
percent last month, the least since February 2009, the Labor
Department reported Jan. 6.  Treasuries have handed investors a 0.3 percent loss in
January, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes.
U.S. company bonds have returned 0.2 percent, and Treasury
Inflation Protected Securities gained 0.6 percent, the figures
show.  The MSCI All Country World  Index (MXWD)  of stocks has returned 1.3
this year including reinvested dividends, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Rally Halted  The figures mark a reversal from 2011, when Treasuries
surged 9.8 percent for their biggest rally in three years while
the MSCI index slid 6.9 percent.  Treasuries fluctuated yesterday amid skepticism that
 Europe ’s debt crisis will be resolved after the leaders of
Germany and  France  said rules for closer fiscal union among the
euro-area nations may be ready a month early.  The three-year notes scheduled for sale today yielded 0.38
percent in pre-auction trading. The record low auction  rate (USN3YTA)  was
0.334 percent set in September. The prior sale of the securities
last month drew a yield of 0.352 percent, with investors
submitting  bids (USN3YBC)  for an unprecedented 3.62 times the amount of
debt offered for this maturity.  The U.S. is also scheduled to sell $21 billion of 10-year
debt tomorrow and $13 billion of 30-year bonds on Jan. 12.  To contact the reporter on this story:
