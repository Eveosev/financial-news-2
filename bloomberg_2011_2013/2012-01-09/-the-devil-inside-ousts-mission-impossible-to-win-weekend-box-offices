The exorcism film “The Devil
Inside” opened in first place with $33.7 million in sales at
U.S. and Canadian theaters, knocking off  Tom Cruise ’s “ Mission
Impossible : Ghost Protocol” after a two-week run at the top.  “Mission: Impossible” dropped to second place with $19.9
million,  Hollywood.com Box-Office  said today in an e-mailed
statement. Viacom Inc.’s Paramount Pictures released both films.  Box-office sales rose 28 percent in the first full weekend
of the new year, giving studios and theater owners a fast start
to 2012. Domestic ticket sales declined 3.4 percent last year
and attendance dropped 4.2 percent to a 16-year low.  “‘Devil Inside’ just took the whole industry by
surprise,”  Jeff Bock , a box-office analyst for Exhibitor
Relations Co. in Los Angeles, said in a telephone interview. “A
horror film that comes out at this time of year is expected to
open at $5 million to $10 million. It’s usually a wasteland for
films that come out in January.”  The movie, which cost about $1 million, won over audiences
in spite of critical reviews. Of 28 on rottentomatoes.com, 26
were negative. The film is about a woman who is controlled by an
evil presence and her daughter’s effort to free her by arranging
for an exorcism.  The movie features Fernanda Andrade, Bonnie Morgan and Evan
Helmuth. “The Devil Inside” was expected to have sales of
$14.1 million, according to researcher Box Office Mojo.  ‘Mission: Impossible’  Bock said the film was helped by a social-media campaign
aimed at younger people that used  Facebook ,  Twitter  and other
websites to spread messages that teenagers shouldn’t see the
film. It was a strategy similar to one used for “Paranormal
Activity,” a low-budget horror film propelled by Internet
marketing and word of mouth to the top spot in October 2009.  “The viral marketing team at Paramount was the same team
that launched ‘Paranormal Activity,’ so they had an inside scoop
into what makes a viral and grassroots success,” Bock said.  In “Mission: Impossible,” Cruise returns as  Ethan Hunt ,
leader of an elite special-operations squad that takes on the
government’s most difficult assignments. This time, team members
go underground to clear their names after being falsely
implicated in a bombing at the Kremlin. The movie also features
 Jeremy Renner  and  Simon Pegg .  ‘ Dragon Tattoo ’  “Mission: Impossible” was expected to have weekend sales
of $15.8 million, according to Box Office Mojo. It has collected
$169.6 million in U.S. and Canadian theaters since its Dec. 16
release, Hollywood.com said.  “ Sherlock Holmes : A Game of Shadows,” fell to third place
from second with sales of $13.7 million. The film from  Time
Warner Inc. (TWX) ’s Warner Bros. features Robert Downey Jr. as the
cerebral sleuth created by novelist Arthur Conan Doyle.  “The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo,” from  Sony Corp. (6758) , was
fourth with $11.4 million in its third weekend. Rooney Mara
stars as Lisbeth Salander, a computer hacker employed by a
security firm. She joins with a journalist, played by  Daniel Craig , to investigate a chain of homicides. The film is an
English-language remake of a Swedish adaption of the novel by
Stieg Larsson.  “Alvin and the Chipmunks: Chipwrecked,” from  News Corp. (NWSA) ’s
Fox studio, was fifth with $9.5 million. The movie is the third
in a series that began in 2007. The picture has generated $111.6
million since it was released on Dec. 16, according to
Hollywood.com.  Weekend revenue for the top 12 films rose to $126.2 million
from a year earlier, Hollywood.com said. Through Jan. 8, revenue
and attendance in 2012 have both risen 13 percent. The amounts
below are based on actual ticket sales for Jan. 6 though
yesterday.  To contact the reporters on this story:
