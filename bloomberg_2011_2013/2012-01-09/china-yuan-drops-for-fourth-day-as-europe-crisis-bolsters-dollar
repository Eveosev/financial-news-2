The yuan fell for a fourth straight
day as speculation  Europe ’s debt crisis will worsen prompted
investors to cut holdings of emerging-market assets, bolstering
the  U.S. dollar .  German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  and French President
Nicolas Sarkozy meet today to flesh out new rules for fiscal
discipline in the euro area after Spain’s 10-year bond yield
jumped the most in nearly 17 years last week. Central bank
Governor Zhou Xiaochuan said China may expand the yuan’s trading
band when capital inflows and outflows are balanced, the Xinhua
News Agency reported yesterday. The Dollar Index, a gauge of the
greenback’s strength, rose to its highest since August 2010.  “Today’s move is mainly a reflection of the dollar’s
regained strength overseas,” said  Liu Dongliang , a senior
analyst in Shenzhen at  China  Merchants Bank Co., the nation’s
sixth-biggest lender. “Zhou’s comments show the band may be
widened pretty soon. There will be more two-way fluctuations in
the yuan’s exchange rate.”  The yuan weakened 0.08 percent to 6.3146 per dollar as of
4:30 p.m. in Shanghai, according to the China Foreign Exchange
Trade System. It strengthened 4.7 percent last year, the best
performance among Asia’s 10 most-traded currencies excluding the
yen.  The central bank set the reference rate at 6.3236 today,
the weakest level since Dec. 22. The currency has been allowed
to trade 0.5 percent on either side of the so-called central-
parity rate since May 2007.  In Hong Kong’s offshore market, the yuan dropped 0.09
percent to 6.3123 per dollar. Twelve-month non-deliverable
forwards were little changed at 6.3435, a 0.3 percent discount
to the onshore spot rate.  --Judy Chen. Editors: James Regan, Ven Ram  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
