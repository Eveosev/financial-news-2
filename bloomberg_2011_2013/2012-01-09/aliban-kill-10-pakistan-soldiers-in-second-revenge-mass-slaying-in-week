Taliban militants killed 10 Pakistani
security personnel in the country’s northwestern border region,
the second such mass slaying in a week.  The men had been seized Dec. 24 in the Orakzai region near
the country’s frontier with  Afghanistan  during a fight between
Taliban guerrillas and Pakistani forces, Ehsanullah Ehsan, a
spokesman for the Tehreek-e-Taliban  Pakistan , said by phone from
an undisclosed location today.  Kismat Ali Khan, a local government official, said in a
phone interview that 10 bodies had been found in the area
without saying whether the men had been members of the army or
paramilitary police units. Militants executed 15 Frontier
Constabulary troops last week. Ehsan said those slayings were
revenge for an army operation that left several Taliban
militants dead, including a prominent commander.  Prime Minister  Yousuf Raza Gilani ’s government is
attempting to negotiate with militants behind attacks that the
New Delhi-based  South Asia Terrorism  portal says have killed
almost 9,000 civilians and security personnel since 2009. Gilani
in October convened a conference of political leaders that
advocated a conciliatory approach to the guerrillas amid public
pressure to end nearly seven years of fighting.  To contact the reporter on this story:
