Spain’s markets regulator proposed
sanctions against Jaime Botin for hiding information about his
stake in  Bankinter SA (BKT) ,  El Confidencial reported , citing
unidentified people in the financial industry with knowledge of
the situation.  Botin, the brother of  Banco Santander SA (SAN)  Chairman  Emilio Botin , last July said that his investment company Cartival held
an additional 7.85 percent of Bankinter on top of the 16 percent
it had declared after a family foundation was dissolved, the
news website reported. The notification followed an order by
Spanish tax authorities to the Botins to regularize hidden
accounts in Switzerland, El Confidencial said.  The regulator concluded Jaime Botin had committed an
offense that should lead to a financial sanction and a ban on
holding a position of responsibility in any company quoted on
the stock exchange, El Confidencial said.  Spain ’s new Economy
Minister Luis de Guindos will have to decide on the case, the
news website reported.  A spokeswoman for the market regulator declined to comment
on the report. A person who answered the phone at Cartival’s
office in Madrid said the person who could respond to media
inquiries wasn’t immediately available. No one at Bankinter was
immediately able to comment on the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
