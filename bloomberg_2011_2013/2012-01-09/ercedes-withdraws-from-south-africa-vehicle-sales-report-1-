Daimler-AG (DAI) ’s South African unit will
not report domestic new-vehicle sales data to the local
automakers’ group as the German company deals with an
investigation into anti-competitive practices in  Europe .  Mercedes-Benz SA (Pty) Ltd. will not participate in the
domestic new-vehicle sales and export sales reporting, the
National Association of Automobile Manufacturers of  South Africa 
said in an e-mailed statement today. The group did not say how
long Daimler would refrain from reporting data.  Daimler, based in Stuttgart,  Germany , ordered the unit to
stop providing figures as a commission in Europe investigates
allegations of anti-competitive behavior in Europe, according to
the statement.  “Naamsa understands that the global directive by Daimler
AG is precautionary in nature,” the association said in a
statement.  Mercedes-Benz SA sold 2,106 new vehicles in November,
making it the sixth-largest automaker by sales in the country,
according to Naamsa. It accounted for 4.2 percent of the 49,499
new vehicles sold in November.  The group is scheduled to release data for December at 12
p.m. Johannesburg time tomorrow. The median  estimate (NAAMTSYY)  of three
analysts in a Bloomberg survey is for a gain of 8.5 percent from
a year earlier.  -- Editors: Hilton Shone, Emily Bowers  To contact the reporters on this story:
