The cost of protecting corporate and
sovereign bonds in  Asia  from default rose from last weekâ€™s
closing prices, according to traders of credit-default swaps.  The  Markit iTraxx Asia (ITRXAGE)  index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan rose two basis points to 208.5 basis
points as of 8:34 a.m. in  Hong Kong , Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc prices show. The gauge is set for its highest close
since Dec. 21, according to data provider CMA.  The  Markit iTraxx Australia (ITRXAAE)  index was little changed at 181
basis points as of 11:21 a.m. in Sydney, according to Westpac
Banking Corp. The measure ranged between 100 and 239 basis
points in 2011, according to CMA, which is owned by CME Group
Inc. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the privately
negotiated market.  The market in  Japan  is closed today for a public holiday.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
