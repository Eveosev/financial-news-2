Overseas  investors (FIINNET)  bought a net  251
million rupees (FIINNET$)  ($4.75 million) of Indian stocks on Jan. 6 and
Jan. 7, taking their investment in the equities this year to
10.3 billion rupees, according to the nation’s market regulator.  Foreigners bought 18.5 billion rupees of shares and sold
18.3 billion rupees over the two days, according to data from
the Securities & Exchange Board of  India . They bought a net 20.9
billion rupees of bonds in the period, the data  show .  Offshore funds pulled out 27.1 billion rupees from local
equities last year, compared with record flows of 1.33 trillion
rupees in 2010, as  Europe ’s debt crisis threatened the global
economy and cooled demand for emerging-market assets. That led
to a 25 percent drop in the  BSE India Sensitive Index (SENSEX) , the
second worst annual loss, and sent the rupee to an all-time low.  India’s $1 trillion stock market,  Asia ’s fifth-biggest, is
influenced by flows from overseas. Inflows from abroad surged to
a record in 2010, making the Sensex the best performer among the
world’s top 10 markets. The largest-ever outflow in 2008 led to
the biggest annual slump of 52 percent.  Foreign  funds (FIINFIIN)  have placed 4.454 trillion rupees in stocks
and 1.283 trillion rupees in bonds since they were allowed into
the country in 1993. They invested 421 billion rupees in bonds
last year.  The regulator provides data on shares bought and sold by
large investors, including trades in the primary and secondary
markets, with a delay of at least a day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
