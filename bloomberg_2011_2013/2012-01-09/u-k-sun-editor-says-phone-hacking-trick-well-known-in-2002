Dominic Mohan, editor of  Rupert Murdoch ’s U.K. Sun tabloid, said phone-hacking had been “well-
known” in the industry as long ago as 2002, when he was
recorded joking about it.  “I can’t remember my exact words,” Mohan said of a speech
he made, “very briefly” at an informal awards ceremony for
showbusiness reporters in April 2002. “It was well-known. There
had been several articles printed about this.”  The Sun editor was giving evidence to an inquiry into media
practices in  London  set up in the wake of reports that Murdoch’s
News of the World paper hacked a murdered schoolgirl’s phone in
2002. He was asked about remarks he’d made when he’d been
showbusiness editor of The Sun. At the time,  the Guardian 
recorded him saying that rival paper the  Daily Mirror  got its
scoops due to “lack of security” at a mobile phone operator.  Mohan said it had been “a cheap shot at the Mirror,”
after the paper had had a good year of stories. “There were
rumors in the industry. There’s always rumors in the industry,
but this wasn’t based on any evidence.” He said he couldn’t
remember if there had been similar rumors about The Sun.  To contact the reporter on this story:
