A recommendation by one of  Denmark ’s
two mortgage associations to phase out one-year covered bonds
would be ’’credit positive,’’ Moody’s Investors Service said.  Eliminating the bonds, used to finance 20- and 30-year
mortgages with adjustable  interest rates , would reduce lenders’
refinancing risk, which is ’’significant,’’ Oscar Heemskerk,
senior credit officer, and Alexander Zeidler, senior analyst,
said today in a note.  Denmark’s Mortgage Bankers’ Federation, whose members
include the mortgage arm of Denmark’s largest lender,  Danske
Bank A/S (DANSKE) , began lobbying last year to replace the bonds with
longer-dated securities. Soeren Holm, group managing director
for finance at Nykredit A/S,  Europe ’s biggest issuer of covered
bonds backed by home loans, said in November that Moody’s
exaggerates the refinancing risk.  The one-year bonds have climbed more than tenfold since
2000 to reach 1.2 trillion kroner ($205 billion) in the third
quarter, or just below 70 percent of the country’s economy,
Moody’s said. They account for about half of total outstanding
mortgage debt, the ratings company said. Measures to reduce the
annual refinancing risk, including holding several auctions a
year, aren’t enough, Moody’s said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
