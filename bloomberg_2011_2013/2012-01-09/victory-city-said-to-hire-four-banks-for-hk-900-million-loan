Victory City International Holdings
Ltd. (539)  hired four banks to help it borrow HK$900 million ($116
million), according to a person familiar with the matter.  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) ,  Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (11) , Citic Bank
International Ltd. and Mizuho Corporate Bank Ltd. will help to
organize the loan for the Hong Kong-based maker of knitted
fabric and dyed yarn. The banks began marketing the three-and-a-
half year facility to other lenders last week, the person said,
asking not to be identified because the details are private.  Proceeds will be used for working capital and to refinance
debt, according to the person. Money can be lent in either Hong
Kong or U.S. dollars and the loan will pay a margin of 293 basis
points more than the Hong Kong interbank offered rate, the
person said.  Victory City  reported  revenue of HK$2 billion and profit of
HK$270 million for the six months ended Sept. 30, according to
financial statements on its website. The company’s website says
it is one of the world’s largest knitted fabric makers with more
than 2,000 staff.  It has HK$928 million of loans  maturing (539)  before the end of
2013, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Banks lending the equivalent of HK$100 million or more will
receive a so-called all-in rate of 355 basis points while banks
contributing HK$70 million to HK$99 million will get a rate of
350 basis points, the person said. Those providing HK$40 million
to HK$69 million will receive 345 basis points.  Visits for bankers to two of Victory City’s factories in
 China  will take place from Feb. 13 and lender have been asked to
make commitments by Feb. 17, the person said. The loan has an
average life of 2.8 years, according to the person.  To contact the reporter on this story:
