Turkey ’s Religious Affairs Presidency
outlined plans for a 10-day trip to  Saudi Arabia  for school
children during their semester break, drawing accusations from
opposition politicians and teachers’ unions that it is trampling
the country’s principle of secularism, Vatan  reported .  In a Jan. 5 note to provincial education directorates, the
state’s religious watchdog proposed a trip for elementary- and
high-school students covering five days each in Mecca and
Medina, the Istanbul-based newspaper said. Muslims visit the
cities for the religious pilgrimage of Hajj during the last
month of the Islamic calendar or for a visit known as an umrah
at any other time of the year. The presidency is offering
packages ranging from 760 euros ($970) to 875 euros for students
and teachers.  The government is turning national education into religious
education, said lawmaker Nur Serter, from the main opposition
 Republican People’s Party , according to Vatan. It also cited the
chairmen of the Egitim-Is and Egitim-Sen unions as saying the
government is seeking to shape society with religious tenets and
remove science from education.  To contact the reporter on this story:
