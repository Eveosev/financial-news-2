Persimmon Plc (PSN) , the U.K.’s second-
largest homebuilder by market value, said its average selling
price fell as the company sold more homes to first-time buyers.  Full-year revenue was 1.53 billion pounds ($2.36 billion),
the York, England-based company said today in a statement. That
compares with 1.61 billion pounds, the average of 16 analyst
estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The selling price declined by 2
percent to 164,000 pounds.  “Whilst the general economic backdrop to the U.K. housing
market remains challenging, we have experienced encouraging
levels of visitors, resilient sales reservations, low
cancellation rates and stable prices,” the company said in the
statement.  Homebuilders are focusing on single-family houses and
buying discounted land to improve their margins after sales
volumes declined on tighter lending, government cuts and a
worsening economic outlook. Prices across the U.K. will fall 2
percent this year, according to real estate broker  Savills Plc. (SVS)   The company completed 9,360 homes in 2011, down from 9,384
a year earlier.  To contact the reporters on this story:
