Chile’s government estimates copper
prices will fluctuate between $3 and $4 a pound this year,
averaging close to $3.50, Santiago-based newspaper La Tercera
 reported , citing Deputy Mining Minister Pablo Wagner.  Chile’s government, which in October estimated copper would
average $3.7 a pound in 2012, expects state-owned copper company
Codelco’s contributions to the state to fall below levels seen
in 2010 and 2011 because of lower prices and higher costs, the
newspaper reported on its  website .  Mining Ministry press officials didn’t answer telephone
calls from Bloomberg seeking comment. Chile is the biggest
copper-producing nation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
