England  all-arounder  Tim Bresnan  will
miss the cricket Test with Pakistan that starts Jan. 17 after a
setback with his elbow.  Bresnan had surgery on his right elbow in November to
remove a bone fragment, and the joint “flared up” during his
recent training, the England and Wales Cricket Board said today
in an e-mailed statement. The player will return to England to
recover and will be replaced by Graham Onions.  “I’m obviously gutted not to have an opportunity to play
in the Test series but I knew that, looking at my rehabilitation
program, it was always going to be touch and go to get me ready
for the series,” Bresnan said in the statement. “The priority
for me now is to get myself ready for the one-day series in
February.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
