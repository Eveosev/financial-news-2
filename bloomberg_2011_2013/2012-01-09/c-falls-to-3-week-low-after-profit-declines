HTC Corp. (2498) , Asia’s second-largest
smartphone maker, fell to its lowest in three weeks in Taipei
trading after posting its first quarterly profit decline in two
years and the slimmest operating margin since at least 2008.  The shares dropped as much as 4.2 percent to NT$462, the
lowest intraday level since Dec. 20, and traded down 3.8 percent
at NT$463.50 as of 11:58 a.m in Taipei. The stock was the
second-biggest contributor to the benchmark  Taiex (TWSE)  index’s 0.6
percent decline.  HTC’s fourth-quarter net income dropped 26 percent to NT$11
billion ($364 million), missing the average of 11 analyst
estimates for profit of NT$11.6 billion. Shipments and sales may
fall further this quarter as competition from Apple Inc. and
Samsung Electronics Co. dent demand for its handsets.  “We don’t think HTC’s monthly sales and shipments will
pick up until after it strengthens its product portfolio at the
 Mobile World Congress  in February,” Richard Ko, who rates the
stock “neutral” at KGI Securities Co. in Taipei, wrote in a
Jan. 6 report after the earnings announcement. “We suggest
investors revisit the stock after the firm launches new products
at the MWC.”  Operating  margin (2498) , which tracks the percentage of sales less
operating costs, dropped to 12.8 percent, according to Bloomberg
calculations.  Citigroup Inc. cut its 2012 and 2013 earnings estimates for
HTC by 19 percent each, citing expectations of market share
losses to Apple and Samsung.  To contact the reporters on this story:
