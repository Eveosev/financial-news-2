Biocon Ltd. (BIOS)  said its experimental
drug itolizumab met the main goal of a late-stage clinical
trial, reducing the severity of psoriasis.  An interim analysis of the 200-person study showed that
patients taking the drug had a response rate of 46 percent after
28 weeks, the Bangalore, India-based company said in an
e-mailed statement today. The drug was safe and well-tolerated,
with an infection rate of about 10 percent, the drugmaker said.  Biocon plans to speed up development of the drug for other
autoimmune diseases, such as multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid
arthritis, it said. Itolizumab is a so-called monoclonal
antibody, which are made in a lab to mimic natural substances
that stimulate the human immune system to attack disease-causing
cells. Psoriasis is a chronic skin ailment.  “This could possibly become the first novel biologic
developed and approved from  India  and is an important milestone
for Biocon,” Chairman Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw said in the
statement. “We look forward to taking this molecule to the
market across multiple indications with a global partner.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
