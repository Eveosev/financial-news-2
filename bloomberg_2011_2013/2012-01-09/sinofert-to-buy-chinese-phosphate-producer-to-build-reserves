Sinofert Holdings Ltd. (297) , the Hong
Kong-listed fertilizer unit of  China ’s biggest chemicals
supplier, agreed to buy a phosphate producer based in Yunnan
province for 1.38 billion yuan ($218 million) to build reserves.  The Sinochem Corp. unit will acquire Xundian Lomon
Phosphorus Chemical Co. from Tibet Longsheng Investment
Management Co. and Sichuan Lomon Corp., Sinofert said in a
statement to the Hong Kong stock exchange today.  Chinese chemical fertilizer producers including China
National Offshore Oil Corp. are adding reserves of crop
nutrients to meet rising demand in the world’s most populous
nation. Xundian Lomon, which holds exploration licenses for four
mines in southwestern Yunnan province, is capable of producing
300,000 metric tons of feed-grade phosphate, Sinofert said.  “This will expand the company from a trading and
production-oriented company into one of the major domestic
phosphate-resource owning companies in the PRC,” said Sinofert,
whose second-largest shareholder is  Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan. (POT)   Sinofert rose 2.4 percent to close at HK$2.15 in Hong Kong
trading, the largest gain since Dec. 23. The benchmark  Hang Seng 
index advanced 1.5 percent.  The purchase will be funded internally and with bank loans,
Sinofert said.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
