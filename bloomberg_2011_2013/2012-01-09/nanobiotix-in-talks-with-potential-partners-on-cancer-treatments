Nanobiotix SA, a French developer of
cancer treatments that interact with radiation therapy, is in
talks with about 10 potential partners, Chief Executive Officer
Laurent Levy said.  Some companies are interested in Nanobiotix’s “whole
platform,” while others are focused on one or more  products ,
Levy said in an interview. Nanobiotix, based in Paris, has
received some offers already and aims to agree on a partnership
in the next six months, he said. Levy declined to comment on
which companies are involved in the talks.  Nanobiotix is a spinoff of the  State University of New York 
and funded by venture capital firms including Matignon
Technologies, OTC Asset Management, Cap Decisif, Amorcage Rhone-
Alpes, CIC Vizille and Masseran Gestion-CGE, according to its
 website . Its experimental NanoXray products allow for higher
doses of radiation in the tumor without increasing damage to
healthy tissue, according to the website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
