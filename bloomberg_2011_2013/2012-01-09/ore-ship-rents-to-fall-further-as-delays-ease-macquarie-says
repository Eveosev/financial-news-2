Rents for capesize ships that carry
dry-bulk commodities will extend this year’s 44 percent drop and
may return to levels reached in 2011 that were the lowest in
almost a decade, said Macquarie Capital (Europe) Ltd.  More of the vessels will be seeking cargoes as unloading
delays ease at ports in  China  at the same time that iron-ore
shipments from Australia and Brazil experience a seasonal
weather-related drop, Macquarie said in a report e-mailed Jan.
6. China, the world’s largest steelmaker, imported about two-
thirds of the 1 billion metric tons of iron ore carried at sea
in 2011.  The average rate to charter a capesize fell to $15,477 on
Jan. 6, according to the London-based  Baltic Exchange , which
assesses freight costs for seaborne bulk commodities on more
than 50 international routes. That compares with $27,512 on Dec.
23. A capesize can haul about 160,000 tons of cargo.  “This drop in the physical market is only set to get
worse,” Macquarie said. “As such, freight rates could well be
headed back toward first-half 2011 levels.”  Daily capesize  rates (BCAVRT)  averaged $8,546 in the first six
months of 2011, data from the exchange show, while first- and
second-quarter rents were the lowest since the final three
months of 2001. Capesizes need to earn about $18,000 a day to
break even, Oslo-based Pareto Securities AS said in a report
published last month.  The capesize fleet of 1,355 ships accounts for about 40
percent of total dry-bulk capacity, according to data from
Clarkson Research Services Ltd., a unit of the world’s largest
shipbroker.  Australia and  Brazil  are the two biggest global exporters
of iron ore, a raw material for producing steel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
