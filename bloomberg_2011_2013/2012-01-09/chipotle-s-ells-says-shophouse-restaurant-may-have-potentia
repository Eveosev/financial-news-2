Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. (CMG)  Co-Chief
Executive Officer Steve Ells said the company’s ShopHouse
Southeast Asian Kitchen test store in  Washington  has been a hit
with customers and may have potential for growth.  “At ShopHouse, there’s a line out the door every day,”
Ells said today in a telephone interview. “It’s well
received.”  Ells declined to say whether the company plans to open more
ShopHouse locations.  Chipotle, which opened ShopHouse in September, has sought
to draw customers by selling meat made from naturally raised
animals and sourcing local ingredients. At ShopHouse, customers
move along a service line and tailor their meals, similar to
Chipotle’s format.  Ells, a classically trained chef who opened the first
Chipotle in 1993, spent more than a year perfecting the
ShopHouse menu, which includes Chinese broccoli, eggplant and
pork meatballs. A ShopHouse rice or noodle bowl goes for $6.50
to $7.50, while a Chipotle burrito is about $7 to $8.  Chipotle fell 2.6 percent to $339.74 at the close in  New
York . The shares gained 59 percent last year.  Revenue at the Denver-based chain, which operates more than
1,100 U.S. stores, climbed 24 percent to $591.9 million in the
quarter ended Sept. 30, marking the sixth straight quarter in
which sales increased at least 20 percent.  Chipotle is adding stores in London and Paris and will also
make a push in  Germany  as it expands in  Europe , said Ells, 46.
The company’s interactive format, in which diners customize
orders, is “pretty universally accepted and appreciated,” he
said.  “While domestic is our main area of growth, ShopHouse and
international are ways to sort of seed potential for the
future,” Ells said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
