Gold prices, down 16 percent from a
record in September, are headed into a bear market at $1,300 an
ounce this year, according to  technical analysis  by Lance Roberts at Streettalk Advisors LLC.  The weekly moving-average convergence-divergence graph, a
measure derived by subtracting a long-term trend from a shorter
one, is indicating prices are likely to decline further, said
Roberts, Streettalk’s chief executive officer. Since the end of
September, an MACD chart using 26- and 12-week moving averages
has been below a nine-week measure known as the signal line, and
the gap has been widening.  “The sell signal remains strong, and so there is still
some time before we see more buyers than sellers,” Roberts said
in a telephone interview from Houston. “The trend is negative,
so we have to be more cautious.”  On Dec. 29, gold futures on the Comex in New York settled
19 percent below their record close of $1,891.90 on Aug. 22,
about 1 percentage point shy of the 20 percent needed for a  bear
market . After reaching a record $1,923.70 on Sept. 6, the price
fell to $1,523.90 on Dec. 29, the lowest since July 7.  Roberts said bullion will decline to $1,300 this year, a
drop of almost 20 percent from the Jan. 6 closing price of
$1,616.80.  If the indicator line in an MACD chart falls below the
signal line, it is pointing to lower prices, and if it crosses
above the shorter-term moving average, the indication is
bullish, Roberts said.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
