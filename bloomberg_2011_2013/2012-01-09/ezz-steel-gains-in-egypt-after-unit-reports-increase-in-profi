Ezz Steel (ESRS) , an Egyptian manufacturer
of the metal, headed for the biggest daily gain in more than two
weeks after its unit Al Ezz Dekheila Steel Co. reported higher
nine-month profit than last year.  Shares of the Cairo-based company advanced 3.3 percent to
3.76 Egyptian pounds at 10:57 a.m. in Cairo, poised for the

49 percent. The index rose 0.4 percent today.  The Alexandria-based Ezz Dekheila said today its nine-month
profit rose 0.5 percent to 562 million pounds ($93 million) from
a year earlier. Ezz Steel owns 53 percent of Ezz Dekheila,
according to Bloomberg data. Ezz Steel hasnâ€™t yet reported
