Sugar and Integrated Industries Co.,
a state-run Egyptian company, is seeking to buy between 50,000
and 80,000 metric tons of raw sugar.  The sweetener is for delivery between March and May,
Hussein Ahmed, a purchasing manager at the company, said by
telephone from Cairo today.  The tender probably will be “about price checking,”  Naim Beydoun , a broker at Swiss Sugar Brokers, said in a report e-
mailed yesterday. “The Egyptian market is well supplied, and
domestic prices keep slowly ticking down.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
