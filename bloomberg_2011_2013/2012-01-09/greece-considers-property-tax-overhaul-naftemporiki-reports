Greece  is considering whether to
replace a temporary special property tax and current real-estate
levies with a single tax,  Naftemporiki  said, without citing
anyone.  The proposed tax would be based on actual market values in
a given area, using data compiled by the  Bank of Greece , rather
than the lower values assumed by the government and would
increase revenue from property taxes above the 7 billion-euro
($8.9 billion) target for the next four years, the Athens-based
newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
