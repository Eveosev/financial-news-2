refueling-tanker aircraft next year from  Airbus Military , an arm
of  European Aeronautic, Defence & Space Co. (EAD) , Agence France
Presse quoted the countryâ€™s defense minister as saying.  France plans to place an order in 2013 for planes that
would be delivered four years later, to replace aging aircraft,
AFP quoted Defense Minister Gerard Longuet as telling
journalists, without specifying how many planes will be ordered.  Airbus so far has won orders for 28 A330 tankers from
