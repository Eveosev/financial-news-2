China-U.S. relations have been
consistent during administrations of both U.S. political parties
over four decades, suggesting that Republican presidential
candidates’ criticisms of  China  go against a broader trend, Vice
Foreign Minister Cui Tiankai said today.  “Over these decades China-U.S. relations have kept moving
forward,” Cui told reporters in Beijing today. “Although there
have been different presidents in office, the China policy of
different administrations has been fairly consistent” since
President  Richard Nixon  visited China 40 years ago.  Leading Republican presidential candidates, including
former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney, have criticized China
on the campaign trail.  Romney said he would press a case against China at the
 World Trade Organization  for manipulating its currency in order
to artificially lower prices and run a  trade surplus . The U.S.
had a $273 billion trade deficit with China in 2010. The U.S.
and China are the world’s two biggest economies.  “Many of the candidates mention China’s name in the
presidential campaign,” Cui said. “I’m also quite curious, how
much knowledge do they have about the nature of the China-U.S.
relationship?”  To contact the reporter on this story:
