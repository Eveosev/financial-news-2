Thierry Henry  scored the only goal
as Arsenal beat Leeds in English soccer’s F.A. Cup.  Henry, who joined the Gunners last week on a two-month loan
from Major League Soccer’s New York Red Bulls, scored in the
78th minute after coming on as a second-half substitute during
the third-round match at the Emirates Stadium in  London .  It was Henry’s first start in his second spell with
Arsenal. He scored a club-record 226 goals for the north London
team before leaving for Barcelona in 2007.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
