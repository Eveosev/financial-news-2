A former  WJB Capital Group Inc. 
employee asked a court to help him collect a bonus of about
$54,000 that he says he’s owed by the company, which shut down
its brokerage operations this month.  WJB Capital “cannot or will not pay” a minimum guaranteed
cash bonus for 2011, the ex-employee, John L. Newman, said in a
filing today in New York State Supreme Court. WJB Capital said
last week that it was closing its brokerage operations because
of “financial issues.”  Newman plans to file an arbitration claim against WJB
Capital with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority,
according to the court filing. He’s seeking a court order
directing the company to segregate the bonus amount so that any
arbitration award “is not rendered ineffectual.”  A spokesman for New York-based WJB Capital couldn’t
immediately be reached for comment.  The case is Newman v. WJB Capital Group Inc., 650056-2012,
New York State Supreme Court ( Manhattan .)  To contact the reporter on this story:
