CEZ AS (CEZ) , the biggest power utility in
the  Czech Republic , will probably reduce the size of its planned
tender for new nuclear reactors to two from as many as five,  E15 
reported, citing Chief Executive Officer Daniel Benes.  CEZ had planned to seek a contract for two additional
reactors at its Temelin plant with an option for three more
reactors at other sites, the Prague-based newspaper reported.  Wholesale electricity prices will be “stagnant” this
year, E15 quoted Benes as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
