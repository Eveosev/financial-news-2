Steve Stricker  holds a five-shot lead
entering the final round of the U.S. PGA Tour’s season-opening
Hyundai Tournament of Champions in Hawaii.  Stricker, 44, birdied his final four holes yesterday at the
Plantation Course in Kapalua, Maui, to get to 19-under par
through three rounds. Defending champion Jonathan Byrd is tied
with  Webb Simpson  and Martin Laird at 14-under par.  Stricker has captured 11 PGA Tour titles and has won five
of the past six events in which he’s held a 54-hole lead.
Today’s final round is scheduled to conclude before the start of
college football’s national championship game.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
