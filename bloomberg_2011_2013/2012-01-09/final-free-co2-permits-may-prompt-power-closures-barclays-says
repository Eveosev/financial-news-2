The final grant of free-of-charge
European Union carbon allowances to power utilities next month
may be followed by a wave of fossil-fuel station closures, said
a Barclays Capital analyst.  “Incentives for closing plants should increase after
February, when the last free allocations of carbon permits are
given,”  Trevor Sikorski , an analyst at the bank in  London , said
today in an e-mailed research note. “After that occurs, the
only reason not to close plants would be for ancillary-service
revenue that could be earned for providing system back-up to
balance the variable nature of renewable generation,” he said.  Potential sales in the first quarter of this year by
factories with spare allowances means carbon permits will
probably fall rather than rise, Sikorski said. The second phase
of the greenhouse-gas market, the world’s largest, runs through
2012 and most utilities will need to pay for allowances after
that year instead of receiving free grants.  Western Europe will need to retire about 148 gigawatts of
coal-station capacity alone in the 25 years through 2035 in
order to help keep temperatures from rising more than 2 degrees
Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit), the  International Energy
Agency  in Paris estimated in November. That’s enough to supply
about 300 million EU homes. The U.S. will need to retire 182
gigawatts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
