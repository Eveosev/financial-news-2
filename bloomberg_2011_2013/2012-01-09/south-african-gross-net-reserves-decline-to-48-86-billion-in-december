South African gold and foreign-
currency reserves dropped in December as the price of bullion
declined and the dollar gained, reducing the value of holdings
in other currencies.  Gross  reserves (SANOGR$)  decreased to $48.86 billion from $49.65
billion in November, the Pretoria-based  Reserve Bank  said on its
 website  today. The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of five
economists was for reserves to fall to $48.82 billion.  Net (SANOFP$) 
reserves slipped to $47.87 billion from $48.63 billion in
November.  “The decrease in the gross reserves was primarily due to
the decline in the gold price, which led to a sizable downward
valuation adjustment in the  gold reserves ,” the Reserve Bank
said in the statement. “The appreciation of the  U.S. dollar 
against other major currencies also resulted in a decline.”  Gold slid 9.7 percent last month, the biggest slump since
September. Gold reserves, which accounts for about 14 percent of
gross holdings at the central bank, fell to $6.27 billion, the
bank said. The dollar gained against 13 of the 16 major
currencies tracked by Bloomberg, cutting the value of holdings
of euros, pounds and other foreign exchange.  The rand was little changed at 8.1784 per dollar at 8:20
a.m. in Johannesburg from 8.1757 on Jan. 6. The yield on  South
Africa ’s 13.5 percent bonds due in 2015 was unchanged at 6.85
percent.  -- Editors: Vernon Wessels, Ben Holland  To contact the reporters on this story:
