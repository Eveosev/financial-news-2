Cocoa surged the most since October
2009 as a labor stoppage threatened to disrupt supplies from
 Nigeria , the world’s fourth-biggest producer. Sugar and coffee
also advanced.  Nigerian workers began a national strike today, which may
shut ports, after fuel costs more than doubled. Growers in the
nation aren’t selling crops after prices paid to farmers fell
more than 40 percent and the government’s removal of fuel
subsidies left them facing higher costs, the head of the Cocoa
Association of Nigeria said on Jan. 4.  Higher prices may lift costs for companies including
Hershey Co., Nestle SA and Barry Callebaut AG, the world’s top
bulk-chocolate maker. Last year, cocoa tumbled 31 percent, the
largest annual loss since 1999, as output rose in  Ivory Coast ,
the biggest grower.  “Whenever you see a country being immobilized, you run the
risk of exports not moving at all,”  Hector Galvan , a senior
commodities broker at RJO Futures in Chicago, said in a
telephone interview. “Nigeria is not Ivory Coast, but when all
is said and done, it’s one of the top producers.”  Cocoa for March delivery jumped 7 percent to settle at
$2,170 a metric ton at 12:02 p.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in New
York, the biggest gain since Oct. 5, 2009.  Supplies will trail demand by 29,000 tons in the season
started Oct. 1, Rabobank International forecast. If weather in
West Africa turns “unconstructive,” the shortage may widen,
the bank said in a report on Jan. 5. Ghana is the second-biggest
producer, and  Indonesia  is third.  The European Cocoa Association will release fourth quarter
statistics on grindings, a measure of demand, on Jan. 13.  Raw-sugar futures for March delivery rose 0.2 percent to
close at 23.34 cents a pound in  New York . The sweetener tumbled
27 percent last year as output climbed in  Europe  and Asia.  Arabica-coffee futures for March delivery increased less
than 0.1 percent to $2.2185 a pound on ICE. The commodity fell
2.2 percent last week.  In  London , cocoa, refined sugar and robusta coffee advanced
on NYSE Liffe.  To contact the reporter on this story:
