 A “medium-intensity” earthquake in
central  Chile  has produced no immediate reports of damage,
injury or interruption of services, the government emergency
service, known as Onemi, said on its website.  The temblor, which affected the regions of Coquimbo,
Santiago and O’Higgins at about 6:30 p.m. local time, measured
IV on the Mercalli seismic scale in Tiltil, located in the
northern area of the Santiago metropolitan area, Onemi reported.
The  U.S. Geological Survey  said on its website that the
epicenter of the 5.1-magnitude temblor was 122 kilometers (76
miles) north-northwest of capital Santiago.  Chile, which in February 2010 was hit by an 8.8-magnitude
earthquake, is the world’s largest producer of copper. Most of
the mines are in the country’s northern region.  To contact the reporter on this story:
