Canaan Partners, a global venture
fund with $3.5 billion under management, has raised $600 million
to invest in technology and health-care companies.  Canaan, based in Menlo Park,  California , will spend two-
thirds of the fund on digital media, Internet, mobile and other
technology companies, and a third is designated for
pharmaceutical, medical device and health-care investments, the
company said today in a statement.  This is Canaanâ€™s ninth fund. Previous investments included
Advanced BioHealing Inc., maker of Dermagraft, a bio-engineered
skin substitute used to treat diabetic foot ulcers, which was
acquired by Shire Plc in May for $750 million, and flash storage
maker SandForce Inc., was acquired by LSI Corp. for $370M
earlier this month.  Almost 40 U.S. venture capital funds raised $5.6 billion in
the fourth quarter of 2011, a 162 percent increase from the
previous quarter, the  National Venture Capital Association  said
today in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
