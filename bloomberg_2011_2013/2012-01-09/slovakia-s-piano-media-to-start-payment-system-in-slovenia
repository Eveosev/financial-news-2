Piano Media AS, the Slovak company
that started a payment system for access to online media, has
set up a similar system in Slovenia, its second European
venture.  Eight Slovenian media companies, including newspaper Delo,
have joined the project that will place a so-called pay-wall to
their digital content, Bratislava-based Piano Media said in an
e-mailed statement. Readers will have access to their content
from Jan. 16 for a monthly subscription fee of 4.89 euros
($6.24), it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
