Ford Otomotiv Sanayi AS (FROTO) , Ford’s
Turkish production unit, says exports are growing by 60 percent
a year, led by sales of Transit Connect vans to the U.S.,
 Hurriyet newspaper  reported.  The company has surpassed expectations by selling more than
100,000 vehicles in the Americas since it began exporting there
two and a half years ago, the newspaper said, citing Chief
Executive Officer Nuri Otay.  The company has invested $1 billion to bring out three new
models in three years, including a new version of the Transit,
to be sold from the end of this year, Hurriyet said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
