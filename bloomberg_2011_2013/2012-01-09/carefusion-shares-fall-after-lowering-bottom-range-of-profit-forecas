CareFusion Corp. (CFN) , the maker of
infusion pumps and hospital products, dropped the most in two
years after second-quarter profit missed analyst estimates and
the company lowered the bottom end of its full-year forecast.  CareFusion  fell (CFN)  8.6 percent to $23.28 at the close in  New
York , the company’s biggest decline since Aug. 24, 2009. The
shares have fallen 8 percent in the past 12 months.  Earnings excluding one-time items for the three months
ended Dec. 31 were 41 cents to 45 cents a share, the San Diego-
based company said in a statement today. The preliminary results
missed the average estimate of 46 cents by 15 analysts surveyed
by Bloomberg. Fiscal full-year results will be $1.75 to $1.90,
down from a previous profit forecast of $1.80 to $1.90.
CareFusion plans to release full results on Feb. 2.  “The revenue shortfall in largely higher margin products
and increased pricing pressure in lower margin products led to
gross margin pressure and the earnings per share shortfall,”
wrote  Joanne Wuensch , an analyst with BMO Capital Markets in New
York, in a note to investors today.  CareFusion didn’t cut full-year sales estimates, Wuensch
said.  “The good news is management does not believe that it is
losing market share in clinically differentiated products, there
does not appear to be a change in the patient procedural volumes
or the capital expenditure spending environment, and it
reiterated its goal for 20 percent plus operating margins
exiting 2014,” Wuensch said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
