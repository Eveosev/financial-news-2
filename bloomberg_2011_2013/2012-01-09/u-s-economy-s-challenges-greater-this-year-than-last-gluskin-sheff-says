David Rosenberg , chief economist and
strategist at Gluskin Sheff & Associates Inc., said the  U.S.
economy  faces more challenges in 2012 than last year, while he
backed away from his prediction the nation was facing a near-
certain recession.  “Certainly, we’re not in a recession right now,”
Rosenberg said in an interview on Bloomberg Television’s “In
the Loop” with Betty Liu. Nonetheless, he said, “I still
believe the economy is still fragile and this recovery is still
quite spotty.”  The effects of the European recession and a slowdown in
 China  will weigh on U.S. exports and industrial production this
year, he said. Even last week’s stronger-than-forecast  jobs
growth (USURTOT)  number of 200,000 for December may end up being revised
down to about 140,000, when holiday hiring at delivery companies
and other seasonal factors are taken into account, he said.  Rosenberg, who in a Bloomberg Radio interview last Aug. 5
gave 99 percent odds the U.S. would fall back into a recession,
said today he didn’t have “as much conviction” as before that
the U.S. faced another slump.  “As challenging as the year was in 2011, I expect 2012 is
going to be even more challenging,” Rosenberg said in the
interview from Toronto. “When you consider all the headwinds
coming from overseas:  Europe  is in a recession now, it was not
in a recession a year ago; we’re now talking about hard-landing
risks in China, we weren’t talking about that a year ago.”  For all of 2011, monthly payroll growth averaged 137,000,
and total jobs growth was 1.64 million after a gain of 940,000
in 2010. Even with the gains, little headway has been made in
recovering the 8.75 million jobs lost as a result of the
recession that ended in June 2009.  The U.S. economy will end up growing about 1.5 percent to
1.75 percent in 2011, Rosenberg said. He didn’t provide
forecasts for this year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
