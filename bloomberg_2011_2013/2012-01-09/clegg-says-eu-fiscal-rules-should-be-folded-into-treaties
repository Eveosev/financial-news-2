U.K. Deputy Prime Minister  Nick Clegg 
called for changes to the way euro-area countries monitor each
other’s spending to be “folded into” existing treaties to
prevent multiple rulebooks governing members of the 27-nation
European Union.  “We believe that it should, over time, be folded into
existing treaties so that you don’t get permanent two parallel
treaties working separately from each other,” Clegg told
reporters in London today following talks with leaders from
European liberal parties, which included EU Economic and
Monetary Affairs Commission Olli Rehn and Dutch Prime Minister
Mark Rutte. “We all see this as a temporary arrangement.”  Prime Minister  David Cameron  angered the Liberal Democrats,
the junior partner in Britain’s governing coalition, by refusing
to back treaty changes aimed at ending the crisis in the euro
region. Clegg said last month that Britain is already working
with  Europe  to get “back into the mainstream of the debate”
after Cameron’s veto.  Clegg said new rules should be limited as much as possible
to monitoring fiscal policy and prevented from straying into
broader areas of economic management.  Separately, Clegg said the U.K. would support “politically
and financially” the  International Monetary Fund , when asked if
the U.K. would consider increasing its contribution to the
Washington-based lender to help it deal with the euro-region
crisis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
