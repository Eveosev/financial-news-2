Germany  in 2012 may turn into a grain
importer for the first time in 25 years,  Frankfurter Allgemeine
Zeitung  reported, citing projections from Georg Keckl, a
statistics official for the state of Lower Saxony.  Domestic production this season will meet 96 percent of
demand as more corn is used in biogas-plants, Keckl said,
according to the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
