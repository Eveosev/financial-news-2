Teck Resources Ltd. (TCK/B) , the largest
Canadian diversified mining company, agreed to buy  SilverBirch
Energy Corp. (SBE)  for about C$435 million ($425 million) to acquire
the rest of the Frontier  oil-sands  project that it doesn’t
already own.  SilverBirch investors will get C$8.50 and one share of a
new company, SilverWillow Energy Corp., for each of their
shares, Vancouver-based Teck said today in a statement.
SilverWillow will hold most of Calgary-based SilverBirch’s
assets except for its 50 percent stake in Frontier and the
Equinox oil-sands project in northeastern  Alberta .  “The Frontier ownership structure is simplified, our
exposure to oil sands leases not amenable to mining is reduced,
and Teck now has the opportunity to explore new potential
partnerships and other alternatives to move Frontier towards
development,” Teck Chief Executive Officer Don Lindsay said in
the statement.  Teck is investing in oil sands to diversify its business,
which is currently reliant on coal, copper and zinc. The company
is the world’s second-largest producer of metallurgical coal
that’s exported by sea and coal accounted for 51 percent of its
sales in the third quarter of 2011, according to  data (TCK/B)  compiled
by Bloomberg.  The Frontier oil-sands project is expected to begin
production in late 2021, according to Teck’s website.  Oil-Sands Deals  SilverBirch rose 33 percent to C$9.61 at the close in
Toronto. Teck fell 1.8 percent to C$37.65.  The cash portion of the bid is 32 percent more than the 20-
day volume-weighted average price of SilverBirch’s shares,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The average premium
paid in pending and completed takeovers of Canadian oil
exploration and production companies announced in the past 12
months and worth $100 million or more is 31 percent, according
to Bloomberg data.  The SilverBirch deal comes six days after Cretaceous
Oilsands Holdings Ltd., a unit of PetroChina Co., said it will
acquire the 40 percent of the MacKay River oil-sands project
that it doesn’t already own from Athabasca Oil Sands Corp. for
$673 million.  China ’s Cnooc Ltd. in November completed its acquisition of
Canadian oilsands producer Opti Canada Inc. for $34 million in
cash and the taking on of $2.4 billion in debt.  Teck said it will contribute to SilverWillow C$25 million
in working capital and Teck’s 50 percent interest in several
oil-sands leases that are currently jointly owned with
SilverBirch.  RBC Dominion Securities and TD Securities are SilverBirch’s
financial advisers and Cassels & Graydon LLP and Torys LLP are
its legal counsel. Stikeman Elliott LLP is Teck’s legal counsel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
