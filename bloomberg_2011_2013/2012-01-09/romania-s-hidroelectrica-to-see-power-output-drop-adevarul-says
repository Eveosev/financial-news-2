Hidroelectrica SA,  Romania ’s state-
owned hydropower generator, will see its output drop about 40
percent in the first quarter as drought keeps rivers’ water
levels low,  Adevarul  reported, citing Chief Executive Officer
Dragos Zachia-Zlatea.  Energy prices will rise as a result, Zachia-Zlatea said,
according to the Bucharest-based newspaper.  The company estimates a gross profit in 2012 of about 85
million euros ($108 million), Adevarul said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
