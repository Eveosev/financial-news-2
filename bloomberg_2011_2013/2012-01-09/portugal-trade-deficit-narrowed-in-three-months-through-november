Portugal ’s trade deficit narrowed in
the three months through November from the same period a year
earlier as exports rose and imports fell, the country’s

billion) from 5.15 billion euros in the same period of 2010, the
Lisbon-based institute said today in an e-mailed report. Exports
rose 15.1 percent and imports dropped 3.6 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
