ALL America Latina Logistica SA (ALLL3) ,
 Latin America ’s largest railroad company, fell in  Sao Paulo 
after Brazil said it will enact freight rate methodology changes
that could cut prices as much as 40 percent.  ALL dropped 0.8 percent to 9.42 reais at the close of
trading after earlier sinking as much as 2.5 percent. The
benchmark Bovespa index rose 0.8 percent.  Brazil’s land transportation agency, known as ANTT, said in
a statement that it plans to adjust the formula for calculating
the maximum rates railroad companies are allowed to charge. The
changes may lower rates by as much as 40 percent, said a press
official at the agency who asked not to be identified in
accordance with internal policy.  “We still haven’t had access to the details of this new
methodology, but the end result of it will inevitably be the
reduction of the maximum allowed tariff for all the
concessions,” Renata Faber and Thiago Macruz, analysts at Itau
Corretora de Valores SA, wrote in a note to clients. “The fact
that the Brazilian government, through ANTT, is trying to
decrease rail freight prices in  Brazil  should indeed increase
investor risk perception towards ALL’s investment story.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
