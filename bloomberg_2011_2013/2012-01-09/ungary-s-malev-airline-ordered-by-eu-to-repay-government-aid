Malev Zrt. (MALEV) ,  Hungary ’s unprofitable
state-owned airline, was ordered by European Union regulators to
repay loans and guarantees it got from the Hungarian government.  The European Commission said Hungary gave Malev financial
help from 2007 to 2010 when the company wouldn’t have received
financing on similar terms “nor possibly any financing at all”
from any private investor “given its consistently difficult
financial situation.”  “Hungary now needs to recover the unlawful aid,” the
Brussels-based authority said in a statement today. The country
must calculate exactly how much aid to reclaim from Malev, said
a press officer for the commission in Brussels who can’t be
identified according to official policy.  Malev may have to pay back “tens of billions of forint”
because of the EU probe, Development Minister Tamas Fellegi said
on Dec. 5. Hungary is seeking a buyer for Malev after it took a
95 percent stake to replace Russian bank Vnesheconombank as
controlling shareholder when a previous privatization failed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
