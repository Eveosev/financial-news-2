Peru ’s sol rose to highest in more
than three years as optimism the Andean country will withstand
the global slowdown boosted demand for its currency.  The sol was little changed at 2.6930 per  U.S. dollar  at
today’s close, from 2.6940 on Jan. 6, according to Deutsche Bank
AG’s local unit. The currency earlier gained to 2.6910, its
strongest since April 2008.  Concern that  Europe ’s debt crisis and sluggish U.S. growth
will slow Peru’s commodity-dependent economy led local banks to
boost their dollar holdings towards the end of last year. Banks
are reducing those holdings as the risk of a global recession
diminishes and the Andean nation’s growth outlook remains
intact, said Pedro Tuesta, a Washington-based economist at 4Cast
Inc.  “Peru’s economy is still going very strong and will
probably have the highest growth in the region this year,
despite slower private investment,” Tuesta said.  Peru, the world’s third-largest copper and zinc producer,
will probably grow 5.5 percent this year, after while exports
rise to $48 billion from $43 billion in 2011, Cabinet Chief
Oscar Valdes said Jan. 5. Gross domestic product rose 5.1
percent in October.  The central bank bought dollars for a second day to temper
gains in the currency. The bank purchased $2 million and paid an
average 2.6920 soles per dollar, it said on its website.  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-
denominated bond due August 2020 climbed two basis points, or
0.02 percentage point, to 5.71 percent, according to prices
compiled by Bloomberg. The security’s price fell 0.13 centimo to
114.25 centimos per sol.  To contact the reporter on this story:
