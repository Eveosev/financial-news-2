U.K. Foreign Secretary  William Hague 
said he was “extremely disappointed by Iran’s decision to start
enrichment operations at its Qom facility.”  “At a time when the international community is asking Iran
to provide assurances of the peaceful nature of its programme,
this is a provocative act which further undermines Iran’s claims
that its programme is entirely civilian in nature,” he said in
an e-mailed statement today.  “Iran only acknowledged the facility at Qom after its
existence became known,” Hague said in the statement. “Its
size, location, and clandestine nature raise serious questions
about its ultimate purpose. Iran can provide no credible
rationale for producing so much 20% enriched uranium. Its claim
to be enriching for the Tehran Research Reactor does not stand
up to serious scrutiny.  Iran  already has sufficient enriched
uranium to power the reactor for more than five years and has
not even installed the equipment necessary to manufacture fuel
elements.”  “If Iran has nothing to hide, it should seek every
opportunity to reassure the international community of its
peaceful intentions,” according to the statement. “We
therefore call on Iran to stop immediately the production of 20%
uranium and to engage seriously with the E3+3 about the
international community’s concerns. In the absence of this
international pressure on Iran will only increase further”.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
