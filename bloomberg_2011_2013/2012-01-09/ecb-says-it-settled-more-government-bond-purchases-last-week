The  European Central Bank  bought more
 government bonds  last week.  The Frankfurt-based ECB said it settled 1.1 billion euros
($1.4 billion) of bond purchases in the week ended Jan. 6,
compared with 462 million euros the previous week. The ECB will
take seven-day term deposits tomorrow to absorb the 213 billion
euros of liquidity created since its  bond program (ECBCSMP)  started on May
10 last year, a practice it employs to ensure the purchases
don’t fuel inflation.  The ECB loaned banks a record 489 billion euros for three
years on Dec. 21 in an effort to keep credit flowing to the
economy during the sovereign debt crisis. The central bank cut
its 2012 euro-area growth forecast to 0.3 percent last month.  ECB officials have resisted calls from investors and
governments to backstop the currency bloc and combat the turmoil
by boosting bond purchases. The ECB says it’s up to governments
to solve the crisis, and asking the central bank to rescue
states would damage its independence and credibility.  To contact the reporter on this story:
