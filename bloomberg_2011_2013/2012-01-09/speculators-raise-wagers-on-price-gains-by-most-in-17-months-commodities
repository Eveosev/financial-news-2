Hedge funds  raised their wagers on
higher commodity prices by the most since July 2010 after signs
of accelerating U.S. growth bolstered optimism that demand for
raw materials will strengthen.  Money managers expanded their combined net-long positions
across 18 U.S. futures and options by 25 percent to 671,915
 contracts (.MMLOSH)  in the week ended Jan. 3, Commodity Futures Trading
Commission data show. Bullish bets on cotton rose the most since
April 2009 and those on coffee doubled. Crude-oil holdings
reached a three-week high.  Prices for metals and bulk commodities such as coal rose at
least 85 percent of the time since 2004 when global industrial
production strengthened, Macquarie Group Ltd. estimates. U.S.
unemployment fell to the lowest in almost three years, and it
joined China,  Australia ,  Germany ,  India  and the U.K. in
reporting manufacturing gains. Almost $253 billion was added to
the value of global equities last week on speculation economies
will skirt a slump as Europe’s debt crisis deepens.  “You’ve been seeing a risk-on trade across the board, not
just in commodities,” said John Bailey, the founder and chief
executive officer of Stamford, Connecticut-based Spruce Private
Investors LLC, which advises investors holding about $3 billion
of assets. “Between a calming in Europe and better-than-
expected numbers in the U.S., including employment and housing,
that has led to a risk-on attitude among managers.”  Index (MXWD)  Gains  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot Index of 24 raw materials
rose 2.6 percent last week and reached a seven-week high on Jan.
5. The MSCI All-Country World  Index (MXWD)  gained 0.8 percent, touching
a one-month high on Jan. 4. The U.S. Dollar Index, a measure
against six trading partners, added 1.3 percent, and the yield
on 10-year Treasuries advanced 0.8 percentage point, Bloomberg
Bond Trader prices show.  Thirteen of the 24 raw materials tracked by the GSCI gauge
advanced, led by a 5.3 percent gain in  Brent crude , a 4.6
percent increase in heating oil, and a 4.7 percent jump in
gasoil. Cotton increased 4.4 percent, the third consecutive
advance, and gold rallied 3.2 percent, the biggest gain since
the week ended Dec. 2.  Cotton for March delivery rose 0.6 percent to settle at
96.44 cents a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in  New York . Crude for
February delivery dropped 0.2 percent to $101.31 a barrel on the
New York Mercantile Exchange. Gold futures for February delivery
slipped 0.5 percent to $1,608.10 an ounce on the Comex.  ‘Economy Is Back’  The U.S. expanded at a rate of 1.8 percent in 2011 and will
probably grow 2.1 percent in 2012, according to the median of 70
economist estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Employers added more
workers to payrolls than projected in December, Labor Department
figures showed on Jan. 6.  Manufacturing (NAPMPMI)  expanded in December at
the fastest pace in six months, the Institute for Supply
Management said on Jan. 3.  “The economy is back,”  Chris Rupkey , the chief financial
economist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd., wrote in a
report Jan. 6. “Despite some evidence of slowing in places like
Canada, Brazil, China, and of course  Europe , the prospect for
continued growth in the U.S. is a bright one.”  The S&P GSCI Spot index rallied 16 percent since reaching a
10-month low in October on signs of increasing optimism for
economic growth. President  Barack Obama  said Jan. 6 that the
U.S., the world’s biggest economy, is “starting to rebound,”
after the Labor Department reported that the  unemployment rate 
fell to 8.5 percent, the lowest since February 2009. The gauge
rose 0.1 percent to settle at 662.57 today.  For all of 2011, U.S. employers added 1.64 million workers,
the most since 2006, after an increase of 940,000 in 2010. Even
with the gains, little headway has been made in recovering the
8.75 million jobs lost during the recession that ended in June
2009.  Funds Shrink  The S&P GSCI  Total Return (SPGSCITR)  Index is still 13 percent below
the 29-month high reached in April, and 2011 marked the first
annual slump for the measure since the recession. On Jan. 6, the
dollar rose to a 13-month high against a basket of major
currencies, curbing the investment appeal of raw materials,
which are typically priced in the currency.  Investors pulled $689.4 million from commodity funds in the
week ended Jan. 4, according to data from Cambridge,
Massachusetts-based EPFR Global, which tracks money flows. Gold
and precious-metals outflows totaled $193.4 million, said  Brad Durham , the managing director of research. The outflows were
smaller than the previous week, when investors withdrew $936
million from commodity funds, he said.  Funds cut their bearish bets on copper by 50 percent to a
net-short position of 2,011 contracts. That’s the least bearish
since the week ending Nov. 8.  Barclays Capital  raised its
forecast for this year’s shortage in copper supply on Jan. 6,
citing import demand from  China , the world’s biggest user of the
metal, and mine disruptions.  ‘Doing Better’  “Some of the risk-on trade is back because the economy
here is doing better,” said  Michael Strauss , who helps oversee
about $27 billion of assets as chief investment strategist at
Commonfund in Wilton, Connecticut. “China seems to be managing
their process better, and Europe has shown some signs of at last
recognizing and at least trying to address their problems.”  Bets (.MMCTNET)  on higher cotton prices surged by 8,303 to 14,986
contracts, the CFTC data show. Cotton traded on ICE Futures U.S.
in New York increased in seven of the past eight sessions. The
Confederation of Indian Textiles Industry said Jan. 5 that
production in the country, the world’s largest exporter after
the U.S., may be smaller than forecast.  “It could be another year on for cotton in general,” said
 Peter Sorrentino , a senior  fund manager  at Huntington Asset
Advisors in Cincinnati who helps oversee $14.5 billion of
assets. “Some of these things are definitely under-owned.
Prices could see a spike on just shortfalls in supply.”  Farm Goods  A  measure (.AGLOSH)  of 11 U.S. farm goods showed speculators raised
bullish bets in agricultural commodities by 35 percent for a
second consecutive week, reaching 368,783, the highest since the
week ended Nov. 15. Corn wagers rose 30 percent to 192,500, the
biggest gain since the week ended July 13, 2010. Net-long
positions in soybeans increased 39 percent to 33,020, the most
bullish holding since early November.  Speculators raised bets on higher crude-oil prices by 4.1
percent to 200,307 contracts, the CFTC data show. Wagers on
heating oil rose 34 percent, the most since October, and
gasoline bets gained 9.9 percent. Crude traded on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange  exceeded $102 a barrel every day last week,
peaking at $103.74 on Jan. 4, the highest since May 11.  “‘There was definitely a cleaning house of sorts in many
commodities towards the end of the year, and that resulted in
shorter-term oversold conditions in some commodities,’’ said
 Michael Cuggino , who helps manage about $15 billion of assets at
Permanent Portfolio Funds in  San Francisco . ‘‘It’s not
surprising to me that buying has perked up a little bit early in
the new year. The global growth story is still there.’’  To contact the reporter on this story:
