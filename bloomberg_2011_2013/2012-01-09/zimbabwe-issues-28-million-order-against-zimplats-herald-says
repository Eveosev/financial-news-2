The Zimbabwean government issued a
$28 million order against mining company  Zimplats Holdings Ltd. (ZIM) 
to recover outstanding royalties, the Herald reported, without
saying where it got the information.  More than $7 million has been deducted from the mining
company’s bank account after the Zimbabwe Revenue Authority
served notice on it on Nov. 16, the Harare-based newspaper said.  Zimplats was still paying royalties at 2.5 percent after
the  finance ministry  increased the rate to 3.5 percent, it said.
The rate is set to increase to 5 percent this month.  The matter is “currently before the courts and awaiting a
trial date,” Alice Lourens, a spokeswoman for Johannesburg-
based  Impala Platinum Holdings Ltd. (IMP) , which owns Zimplats, said
in an e-mailed response to a query today. “We cannot comment
further at this stage,” she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
