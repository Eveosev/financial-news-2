Taiwan , which imports more than 99
percent of its crude needs, bought more oil in December as
 Formosa Petrochemical (6505)  Corp. increased purchases.  Shipments climbed 5.5 percent from a year earlier to 24.9
million barrels last month, the  Ministry of Finance  said in
Taipei today. The island’s December oil bill increased 38
percent to $2.79 billion, the ministry said in a statement.  Formosa Petrochemical, Taiwan’s only publicly traded
refiner, bought extra crude and naphtha cargoes in case supplies
from Iran are cut amid sanctions against the country and its
threat to shut a Middle East oil transit route, company
president Tsao Mihn said on Jan. 6.  To contact the reporters on this story:
