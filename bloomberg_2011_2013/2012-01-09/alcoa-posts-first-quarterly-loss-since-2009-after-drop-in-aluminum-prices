Alcoa Inc. (AA) , the largest U.S.
aluminum producer, reported its first quarterly loss in more
than two years after prices for the lightweight metal tumbled.  The fourth-quarter net loss was $191 million, or 18 cents a
share, compared with net income of $258 million, or 24 cents, a
year earlier, the New York-based company said yesterday in a
statement. The loss excluding restructuring costs was 3 cents a
share, matching the average projection from 18 estimates
compiled by Bloomberg. Sales rose 6 percent to $5.99 billion.  The loss is Alcoa’s first on an  adjusted basis  since the
second quarter of 2009, when the company was dealing with a
slump in aluminum prices that followed the global financial
crisis. Aluminum fell in 2011, with the benchmark three-month
price in London averaging 11 percent lower in the fourth quarter
than a year earlier, and Alcoa said last week it would close 12
percent of its smelting capacity.  The loss “makes it very much an uphill battle” to meet
analysts’ expectations in 2012,  Jorge Beristain , an analyst at
Deutsche Bank AG who recommends  holding  the stock, said by phone
yesterday. Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortization must “essentially double in the next quarter and
then stay at that level for the next four,” he said.  Alcoa rose 0.2 percent to $9.44 in New York. Aluminum for
delivery in three months on the London Metal Exchange gained 2.7
percent to $2,164 a metric ton at 8:31 p.m. London time.  Index Decliner  The company is the first in the  Dow Jones Industrial
Average (INDU)  to report earnings for the quarter. The stock sank 44
percent last year, the second-biggest decline in the  index  after
Bank of America Corp.’s 58 percent slump.  The aluminum producer will cut its global smelting capacity
by 531,000 tons. U.S. smelters at Alcoa,  Tennessee , and
Rockdale,  Texas , will be affected, it said Jan. 5. Alcoa said
yesterday it will curtail output at smelters in Portovesme,
 Italy , and La Coruna and Aviles in  Spain  as part of the plan.  Aluminum supply has exceeded demand and inventories have
soared, leaving some smelters unprofitable at current metal
prices. Global output exceeded demand by 953,516 tons in the
first three quarters of 2011, according to  data  compiled by
Bloomberg Industries.  Demand Outlook  Chief Executive Officer  Klaus Kleinfeld  said yesterday that
global aluminum demand will grow 7 percent this year, compared
with 11 percent in 2011. That expansion, combined with
production cuts, will lead to a market deficit of 600,000 tons
in 2012, Alcoa said.  Aerospace sales growth will be 10 percent to 11 percent in
2012, the company said yesterday in an analyst  presentation .
European auto- and truck-manufacturing output and construction
sales will decline. Beverage-can and packaging sales will grow
by as much as 5 percent in  Europe , and by as much as 20 percent
in  China , Alcoa said.  European aluminum demand won’t expand in 2012, compared
with growth of 1 percent last year, it said. Chinese demand will
increase 12 percent this year, down from 15 percent.  Alcoa is a fully integrated aluminum producer. It mines
bauxite, an ore that contains aluminum, and refines it into
alumina, the raw material used by smelters. As well as selling
aluminum to industrial users, Alcoa makes products such as can
sheet and components for cars and aircraft.  Alcoa’s aluminum output increased 5.4 percent to 962,000
tons in the quarter. Its alumina production rose 1.4 percent to
4.18 million tons.  The company’s previous quarterly loss on a GAAP basis was
in the first quarter of 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
