MetLife Inc. (MET)  was upgraded to “buy”
at  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  as the largest U.S. life insurer
weighs scaling back or exiting businesses to meet targets for
shareholder returns.  Christopher Giovanni, an equity analyst at Goldman Sachs,
cited the insurer’s business review and goal of reducing
variable annuity sales in a report today. He previously had a
“neutral”  rating (MET)  on the New York-based company.  MetLife Chief Executive Officer  Steven Kandarian , 59, has
said “everything is on the table” as he retools the insurer
after the $16 billion acquisition of American Life Insurance Co.
in 2010, which added to international operations. The firm
announced a deal with General Electric Co.’s finance unit last
month to divest most of the deposits at MetLife Bank as the
insurer seeks to limit regulation by the  Federal Reserve .  MetLife’s push to reduce sales of variable annuities, the
equity-linked retirement products, may “be followed by further
initiatives to increase focus on its higher returning global
initiative and return of capital when it (finally) abandons Fed
oversight,” Giovanni said in the report.  MetLife said in October that the Fed had rejected its
proposal to raise its dividend and resume share buybacks. The
insurer is subject to the oversight because of its size and
ownership of the bank.  MetLife rose 1.1 percent to $33.26 at 4 p.m. in New York.
The insurer has slid 28 percent in the last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
