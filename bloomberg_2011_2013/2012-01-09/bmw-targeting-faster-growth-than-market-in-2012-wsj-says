(Corrects year-earlier production in second paragraph.)  Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW)  is
targeting faster growth than the overall market in 2012, the
Wall Street Journal Europe  reported , citing an interview with
Chief Executive Officer  Norbert Reithofer .  BMW will expand production at its Spartanburg, South
Carolina, plant to 350,000 vehicles in the mid- to long-term,
the WSJ also quoted Reithofer as saying. The plant produced
about 300,000 vehicles last year, according to the WSJ.  To contact the reporter on this story:
