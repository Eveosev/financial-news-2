Sugar refineries in the  Persian Gulf 
may switch to using sugar from  India , the world’s second-largest
producer, according to Swiss Sugar Brokers.  Refineries may buy from the Asian nation instead of top
global producer Brazil to exploit a more-than $45 a metric ton
difference in freight costs, Naim Beydoun, a broker at the
Rolle, Switzerland-based company, wrote in a report e-mailed
yesterday.  Al Khaleej Sugar Co., the world’s biggest sugar refiner, is
located in Dubai.  To contact the reporter on this story:
