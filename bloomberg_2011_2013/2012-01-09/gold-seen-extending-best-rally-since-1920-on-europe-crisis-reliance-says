Gold may extend its best rally since
at least 1920 as investors seek a store of wealth amid Europe’s
debt crisis and expectations of slowing global growth and rising
inflation, according to Reliance Capital Asset Management Ltd.  “The current global macroeconomic environment is very
conducive for higher gold prices,” said Sundeep Sikka, Mumbai-
based chief executive officer of the  money manager , which runs
 India ’s second-biggest gold exchange-traded fund. “The
fundamental outlook for gold remains extremely bullish and
paints a rosy picture for gold bulls.”  Bullion reached a record $1,921.15 in September as
investors sought to diversify away from equities and some
currencies amid the European debt crisis and signs of slowing
economic growth. The metal may average $1,766 an ounce this year
and trade as high as $2,055, according to a London Bullion
Market Association survey of traders and analysts.  “The rise in volatility across all assets makes investors
jittery about their investments,” Sikka said in e-mailed
responses. “We see gold continuing to attract interest even in
2012. Investors are looking for a haven to park their money as
the  market sentiment  for equity is uncertain.”  Bullion rose 10 percent in 2011 for an 11th year of gains,
beating the 1.2 percent decline in the Standard & Poor’s GSCI
Total Return Index of 24 commodities and the 9.4 percent retreat
in the MSCI All-Country World Index of equities. Gold for
immediate delivery fell 0.4 percent to $1,611.13 an ounce as of
11:24 a.m. in Mumbai.  Prices may fall in the “near term” as some investors lock
in gains, Sikka said. He didn’t give specific price forecasts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
