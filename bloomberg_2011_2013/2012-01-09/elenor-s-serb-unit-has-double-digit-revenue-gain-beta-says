Telenor ASA (TEL) ’s Serbian  unit  had
“double digit” revenue growth last year after it increased
market share and the number of clients rose to 3.1 million,  Beta 
 news agency  reported, citing the chief executive officer.  The result, which Kjell Morten-Johnsen did not specify,
narrowed the revenue gap between the Telenor  unit  and its main
local rival in mobile phone services,  MT:S  of state-run Telekom
Srbija AD, the report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
