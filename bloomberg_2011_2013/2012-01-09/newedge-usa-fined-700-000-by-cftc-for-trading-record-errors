Newedge USA LLC, the broker with the
most U.S. segregated customer funds, will pay $700,000 to
resolve regulatory claims that the firm submitted flawed trader
reports and violated an earlier order to improve accuracy.  Newedge turned in large-trader reports with eight types of
errors from March through July of last year including
overstatements and understatements of positions and open
interest, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission said in an
order released in  Washington  today. The regulator also found
that the brokerage, a unit of Paris-based Newedge Group SA,
failed to comply with a Feb. 7 order to improve its reporting.  “Today’s action should send a message to the industry that
the commission expects its reporting rules to be strictly
adhered to, and that the commission will sanction those who fail
to adhere to prior commission orders,” CFTC Enforcement
Director David Meister said in a statement. Newedge’s reporting
“has greatly improved” since July, the CFTC said.  The company, which didn’t admit or deny the allegations,
regrets that “certain reports required corrections” during the
firm’s re-engineering efforts, Kevin Russell, a spokesman for
Newedge, said in an e-mail statement.  “Newedge has elected to settle with the CFTC because
of these lapses,” Russell said.  Newedge ranked first among futures brokers with $20.8
billion in U.S. customers’ segregated funds on Oct. 31,
according to  CFTC data .  To contact the reporter on this story:
