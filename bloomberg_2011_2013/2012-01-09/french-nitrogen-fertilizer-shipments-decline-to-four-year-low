French nitrogen-fertilizer shipments
dropped 19 percent to the lowest level in at least four years
from the start of July to the end of October, national
fertilizer-industry association Unifa said.  Nitrogen deliveries in  France , the European Union’s largest
crop grower, fell to 691,000 metric tons in the first four
months of the year begun July 1 from 851,000 tons a year
earlier, Paris-based Unifa said in an e-mailed statement today.  France is the EU’s biggest user of crop nutrients,
according to the International Fertilizer Industry Association.
The country’s grain farmers typically buy fertilizer for next
year’s crop after most harvesting is done in September.  Potassium-fertilizer shipments in France fell 5.3 percent
to 251,000 tons in the May-October period, while phosphate
deliveries slid 23 percent to 183,000 tons, Unifa said.  The association tracks nitrogen sales on the basis of a
year that starts July 1, while the marketing year for potassium
and phosphorus begins May 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
