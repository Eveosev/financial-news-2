The cost for European banks to borrow
in dollars declined to the lowest in almost 10 weeks, according
to a money-market indicator.  The three-month cross-currency  basis swap , the rate banks
pay to convert euro interest payments into dollars, was at 98
basis points below the euro interbank offered rate at 9:30 a.m.
in  London . That’s the lowest since Oct. 31 and compares with
minus 101 on Jan. 6.  The one-year basis swap was at 88 basis points less than
Euribor, compared with minus 87 on Jan. 6, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  A measure of banks’ reluctance to lend to one another in
 Europe  was little changed. The Euribor-OIS spread, the
difference between the borrowing benchmark and overnight index
swaps, held at 94 basis points. It widened to 101 basis points
on Dec. 1, 2011, the biggest gap since January 2009.  Lenders increased  overnight deposits (ECBLDEPO)  at the  European
Central Bank  to an all-time high, placing 463.6 billion euros
($591.5 billion) with the Frankfurt-based ECB on Jan. 6. That
exceeds the previous record of 455 billion euros set a day
earlier.  Three-month Euribor (EUR003M) , the rate banks say they pay for three-
month loans in euros, fell for a thirteenth day, the longest
declining streak since January 2010. The rate fell to 1.276
percent from 1.288 percent on Jan. 6.  One-week Euribor (EUR001W)  declined
for an eleventh day to 0.546 from 0.564 percent on Jan. 6.  To contact the reporter on this story:
