The  premium (USCSHLSE)  for Heavy Louisiana Sweet
oil over Light Louisiana Sweet crude widened to the largest
margin in more than two weeks.  The gap between the two oils increased 20 cents to $1.50 at
2:24 p.m. in  New York , according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
That’s the largest margin between the two grades since Dec. 23.  Light Louisiana Sweet (USCSLLSS) ’s premium to West Texas Intermediate
lost 20 cents to $11.50 a barrel.  Heavy Louisiana Sweet (USCSHLSE) ’s
premium was unchanged at $13 over the U.S. benchmark.  Heavy oils typically produce a larger proportion of
distillate fuels and less gasoline than light oils. Ultra low
sulfur diesel in the U.S. Gulf rose 0.1 cent to $3.0537 a
gallon, while 87-octane unleaded was 1.54 cents higher at
$2.717.  Thunder Horse’s premium increased $1.45 to $12.45. Mars
Blend added 50 cents to $9 over WTI.  Poseidon (USCSPOSE) ’s premium widened
50 cents to $8.75 a barrel.  Southern Green Canyon (USCSSGCN)  gained $1 to $8 over WTI.  West Texas
Sour (USCSWTSM) ’s discount widened 20 cents to $2.30 a barrel.  Syncrude (USCSSYNS)  weakened 75 cents to a $2.50 a barrel discount
compared to WTI. Syncrude is a light, low-sulfur synthetic oil
derived from the  tar sands  in  Alberta .  Western Canada Select (USCSWCAS) ’s discount to WTI widened by 35 cents
to $18.25 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
