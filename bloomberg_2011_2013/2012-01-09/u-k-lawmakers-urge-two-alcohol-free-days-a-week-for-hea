A panel of British lawmakers said the
government should recommend people have two alcohol-free days a
week for health reasons.  Parliament’s Science and Technology Committee concluded the
 Department of Health  should review its current safe-drinking
guidelines, which recommend not regularly exceeding four units
of alcohol a day for men and three for women. A unit is
equivalent to about half a British pint (0.6 of a U.S. pint) of
low-strength beer, a 25-milliliter measure of whisky and half a
175-milliliter glass of wine.  The committee was looking at whether there was a case for
increasing the limits in the light of evidence about some health
benefits from alcohol. It cautioned against such a change.  “Unfortunately, public understanding of how to use the
guidelines and what an alcohol unit looks like is poor, although
improving,”  Andrew Miller , the opposition  Labour Party  lawmaker
who chairs the committee, said in an e-mailed statement today.
“The evidence we received suggests that the guidelines should
not be increased and that people should be advised to take at
least two drink-free days a week.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
