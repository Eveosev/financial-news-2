The European Union is considering
bringing forward a meeting of foreign ministers to Jan. 23, from
Jan. 30, that will discuss a possible embargo on imports of
 Iranian (OPCRIRAN)  oil, an EU diplomat said.  Officials are checking whether all ministers can attend the
earlier date, which is being changed so that the meeting doesn’t
coincide with a gathering of EU leaders set for Jan. 30, said
the diplomat, who declined be identified, citing government
policy.  The U.S. tightened economic sanctions against Iran
over its nuclear program on Dec. 31, and the European Union is
weighing a ban this month on purchases of Iranian crude.  Crude oil gained in the last three weeks, partly on concern
that Iran may close the Strait of Hormuz at the mouth of the
 Persian Gulf  in retaliation for any further sanctions.  Hormuz, the waterway between  Iran  and Oman, carries about
20 percent of the world’s traded oil, according to the U.S.
Energy Department.  To contact the reporter on this story:
