Venus Williams  withdrew from the
Australian Open a week before the start of the year’s first
Grand Slam tennis tournament because of health issues.  Williams, 31, a seven-time Grand Slam singles champion and
runner-up at the Australian Open in 2003, announced the decision
today on her  website . She also said she has “every intention to
return” to the WTA tour in February.  “After several months of training and treatment, I am
making steady progress to top competitive form,” Williams said.
“My diet and fitness regimen have allowed me to make great
strides in terms of my health, and I am very close to being
ready to return.”  Williams didn’t give specifics on her condition. She has
been receiving treatment for Sjogren’s syndrome, an autoimmune
disease that can cause fatigue and joint pain. She announced the
diagnosis last year in  New York  at the  U.S. Open , the season’s
final Grand Slam tournament, withdrawing from the event after
playing one match.  Williams is 100th in the WTA world rankings after being
limited to four tournaments on the women’s tour last year. Her
best result was at Wimbledon, where she reached the fourth
round.  The Australian Open starts Jan. 16 in  Melbourne .  To contact the reporter on this story:
