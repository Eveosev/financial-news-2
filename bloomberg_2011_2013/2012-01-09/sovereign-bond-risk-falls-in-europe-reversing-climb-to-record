The cost of insuring against default
on European sovereign debt fell, reversing an earlier rise,
according to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of swaps on 15
governments declined two basis points to 380 at 11:30 a.m. in
London, after climbing to a record 386. A decline signals
improvement in perceptions of  credit quality .  The cost of insuring corporate and financial debt rose,
according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. Contracts on the Markit iTraxx
Crossover Index of 50 companies with mostly high-yield credit
ratings increased six basis points to 757.  The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings rose 2.25 basis points to 179.5 basis
points. The Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to senior debt
of 25 banks and insurers climbed 4.5 basis points to 295 and the
subordinated index increased three to 528.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($12.8 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
