The  London 2012 Olympics  ticket
resale website remains suspended, four days after computer
glitches stopped orders from being processed on the site, run by
Live Nation Entertainment Inc.’s  Ticketmaster  division.  “Ticketmaster is looking into it,” a spokeswoman for the
 London  2012 organizing committee, who declined to be identified,
said in an interview. She didn’t put a timeframe on when the
site will be back online. “It won’t go live again until we know
the issues are resolved.”  Ticketmaster declined to comment, saying it planned to
release a statement this afternoon in London.  The resale of tickets bought directly from the organizers
runs until Feb. 3 via the buyer’s ticketing account on the
official London 2012 website. The website was partially
suspended Jan. 6 after thousands of people went online to buy
and sell tickets on the opening day. The site allows ticket
holders to resell their seats at face value.  Also last week, the local operating committee said a
“human error” was to blame for selling 10,000 tickets too many
for the synchronized swimming competition. Some 3,000 people
have been contacted and offered tickets for different sports,
including swimming and athletics.  To contact the reporters on this story:
