BHP Billiton Ltd. (BLT) , the biggest mine
operator, is among companies in the industry whose earnings will
probably fall this year on lower prices for commodities from
copper to coal, according to Deutsche Bank AG.  “Global growth has been lower than we expected six months
ago,” Deutsche Bank analysts Robert Clifford, Grant Spore and
Gaetan De Buyer wrote in a report today. “We now see 2012 as a
year of declining earnings for the miners,” they wrote in the
note, cutting earnings estimates by an average 40 percent.  BHP may report earnings of $3.73 a share, down 8 percent
from a year earlier, Deutsche Bank said, cutting its prior
forecast of a 10 percent gain.  Anglo, the largest platinum and diamond producer, may post
earnings of $4.79 a share, down 28 percent from the bank’s prior
estimate for 2012, the analysts wrote. In addition, Aquarius
Platinum Ltd. may swing to a loss of 8 cents a share from the
bank’s previous forecast for 2012 of a 10 cent profit.  Deutsche Bank has cut its 2012 copper forecast 19 percent
and outlook for coal burned in  power plants  by 5.4 percent.  Commodity prices have fallen 17 percent from a May peak in
the past 12 months, based on the Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB
commodity futures price  index (CRY) . Credit Suisse said Jan. 6 miners
will have “muted earnings and  cash flow .” Commodities are set
for a “difficult environment” in 2012, UBS AG said Nov. 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
