KazMunaiGas Exploration Production (RDGZ) ,
the London-listed unit of  Kazakhstan ’s state energy company,
said oil output fell 7 percent last year after labor strikes
curtailed operations.  KazMunaiGas EP produced 12.3 million metric tons of crude,
944,000 tons less than in 2010, the Astana-based producer said
today in a statement. It attributed most of the decline to its
Uzenmunaigas unit in the west of the country, where a work
stoppage over pay began in May.  The strike capped gains from oil sales in Kazakhstan, the
biggest producer in the former  Soviet Union  after  Russia , as
prices rose from October. KazMunaiGas EP, which said the
stoppage was illegal, fired about 1,300 workers involved in
protests in Mangistau, its biggest production region, in August.
The unrest has persisted, with violence erupting on independence
day last month, killing 16 and leaving about 100 injured.  The labor conflict resulted in the resignation of
KazMunaiGas EP Chief Executive Officer Askar Balzhanov on Dec.
22. President  Nursultan Nazarbayev  also replaced the head of
parent company KazMunaiGaz National Co., Bolat Akchulakov, and
fired his own son-in-law Timur Kulibayev, who headed the
country’s sovereign-wealth fund.  Nazarbayev, who has been in power since 1989, said during a
Dec. 22 visit to Mangistau that the oil workers’ demands were
“just” and the government and KazMunaiGas EP hadn’t solved the
dispute in a “timely manner.”  KazMunaiGas EP agreed to set up two so-called service
companies with more than 2,000 employees in Mangistau.  Capital
spending  is forecast to be 19 percent higher this year, reaching
126.5 billion tenge ($850 million), it said. The company plans
to raise crude output 6 percent to 13.06 million tons this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
