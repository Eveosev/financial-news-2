Zhengzhou China Resources Gas Co. (3928) 
plans to delist from the  Hong Kong  stock exchange on Feb. 14
after  China Resources Gas Group Ltd. (1193)  increased its stake,
Zhengzhou said in a statement to the Hong Kong stock exchange.  China Resources Gas now owns 60.39 percent of the company
in Hong Kong and China, up from 56.87 percent previously,
according to the statement.  China Resources Gas is expanding the number of city-gas
projects it operates in China to meet demand for the cleaner-
burning fuel. Privatizing Zhengzhou would reduce potential
conflicts in allocating resources and investment, China
Resources Gas said Oct. 19.  Trading of both companies were suspended today. Zhengzhou
closed at HK$16.08 Jan. 6, after surging 8.5 percent since Oct.
20 when the privatization plan was announced.  China  Resources
Gas closed at HK$11, down 0.5 percent.  Sales of piped natural gas rose 34 percent to 735 million
yuan in the six months ended June 30, Zhengzhou said in its
first-half earnings report Sept. 9. The company had 1 million
residential customers, 2,856 commercial customers and 96
industrial customers at the end of the period, according to
report.  To contact the reporters on this story:
