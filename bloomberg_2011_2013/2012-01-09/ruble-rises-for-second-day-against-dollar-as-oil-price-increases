The ruble strengthened for a second
day against the dollar as Urals crude oil,  Russia ’s chief export
earner, climbed to an eight-week high.  The Russian currency appreciated 0.2 percent to 31.94 at
the close in Moscow, after gaining 0.9 percent last week. The
ruble was little changed at 40.6025 per euro, leaving it steady
at 35.8381 against the central bank’s target dollar-euro basket.  Urals rose 0.3 percent to a seven-week intraday high of
$111.56 per barrel. Russia, the world’s biggest oil producer,
will need the commodity to trade at an average $125 a barrel in
2012 to balance its budget, according to finance ministry
estimates.  “There’s macroeconomic factors like the oil price” and
the European debt crisis moving the market, Peter Szopo, head of
research at  Alfa Bank , said by telephone.  German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  and French President
 Nicolas Sarkozy  met for the first time this year today to flesh
out a new rulebook for fiscal discipline negotiated at a Dec. 9
summit that seeks to create a “fiscal compact” for the 17-
member euro area. The European Union is Russia’s largest trading
partner.  Russia’s markets are open during the country’s New Year
holidays until Jan. 10. The ruble first traded against the
dollar on the Micex exchange at 10:12 a.m. in Moscow today,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg, 12 minutes after the
market opened. The first trade against the euro came at 11:08
a.m.  “It makes sense from a trading point of view to have the
markets open, as  London  is trading,” Szopo said.  Russia’s 140 billion rubles of domestic bonds due August
2016 fell, pushing the yield up one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 8.15 percent. The yield on dollar debt
maturing in 2020 was three basis points lower than on Jan. 6, at
4.544 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
