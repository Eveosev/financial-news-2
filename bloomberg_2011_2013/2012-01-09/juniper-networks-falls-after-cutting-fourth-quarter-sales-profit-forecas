Juniper Networks Inc. (JNPR)  tumbled in late
trading after saying fourth-quarter revenue and profit were
probably lower than forecast, citing weaker-than-expected demand
for routers from telecommunications-service providers.  Sales based on preliminary results were $1.11 billion to
$1.12 billion in the quarter, less than an earlier company
prediction of $1.16 billion to $1.22 billion, Sunnyvale,
California-based Juniper said in a statement today. Per-share
earnings, excluding certain expenses, were 26 cents to 28 cents,
compared with a prior forecast of 32 cents to 36 cents.  While Juniper didn’t say why U.S. carriers are cutting
spending,  Verizon Wireless  said two months ago that it was
investing less in older wireless technology to focus on
expanding the size of data plans for smartphone customers.
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. last month cut its rating on Adtran
Inc., a maker of high-speed digital transmission products,
citing a decline in  capital expenditures  by top carriers.  Juniper fell 6.4 percent to $20.15 at 4:16 p.m. in extended
New York trading after the revised outlook was released. The
stock has tumbled 43 percent in the past year, while larger
competitor  Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO)  has fallen 9.5 percent. The
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index was little changed.  Juniper plans to provide full fourth-quarter results on
Jan. 26. In addition to a drop in sales and profit, the company
said its operating margin will be below the previous forecast of
21 percent to 23 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
