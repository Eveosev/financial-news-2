Medtronic Inc. (MDT) , the world’s largest
maker of heart-rhythm devices, is looking for acquisitions
abroad and has about $2 billion a year to spend, Chief Executive
Officer Omar Ishrak said.  Medtronic generates about $4 billion annually in free cash,
and uses about half of it for dividends and to buy back shares,
Ishrak said today at the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference in
 San Francisco . The remaining money is available for
 acquisitions (MDT) , provided the right targets are found, he said.  The Minneapolis-based company will only consider purchases
that trigger little or no reduction in earnings per share,
according to Ishrak. Any acquisition erodes profit would be
accompanied by cost-cutting to reduce the damage, he said.  “We need to have a far more disciplined approach to
acquisitions,” said Ishrak, who is targeting purchases in
growth markets where the company can take a leadership position.
“That may be tough, but we’ll have to find a way to do it. It’s
going to be a big hurdle to get any form of dilution from us.”  Since most of Medtronic’s cash is earned outside the U.S.,
the company may shift expenses abroad or repatriate foreign
profits, he said. “We’ll by nature have to target non-U.S.
acquisitions simply from where our cash is,” Ishrak said.  If the company’s efforts to find  investments (MDT)  and
acquisitions fail to turn up anything that fits the
requirements, it may return more cash back to shareholders, he
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
