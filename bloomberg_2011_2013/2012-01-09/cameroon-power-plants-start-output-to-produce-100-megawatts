Four diesel-fueled thermal plants in
Cameroon have started tests to produce 100 megawatts of
electricity amid plans to boost supplies, said Akamba Zengue, an
official with the Electricity Development Corp.  The plants at Bamenda, Yaounde, Mbalmayo and Ebolowa are
part of Cameroonâ€™s emergency plan to increase output as
construction continues at two hydroelectricity projects, he told
reporters in Yaounde, the capital, yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
