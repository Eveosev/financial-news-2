South African  cement sales rose for
the first time in four years in 2011.  Sales climbed 3.2 percent to 11.2 million metric tons last
year compared with 2010, when they fell 7.8 percent, the
Johannesburg-based  Cement & Concrete Institute  said in an e-
mailed statement today. Sales retreated 1.8 percent to 732,961
tons in December from a year earlier, it said.  The  Reserve Bank  has kept its benchmark rate at a 30-year
low since January 2011 as it seeks to stave off the impact of a
possible recession in Europe because of a deepening debt crisis.  “A long-term recovery in South African cement demand is
long overdue and latest industry trends indicate that further
decline is unlikely,”  Pretoria Portland Cement (PPC)  Co., South
Africa’s biggest maker of the building material, said in a
statement on Nov. 8.  Pretoria Portland Cement’s shares declined 22 percent last
year. The stock fell 0.4 percent to 26.95 rand by 4:06 p.m. in
Johannesburg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
