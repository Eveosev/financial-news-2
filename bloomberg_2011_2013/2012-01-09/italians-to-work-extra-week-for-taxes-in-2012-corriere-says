Italians will have to work an extra
week in 2012 than last year to pay all taxes and contributions
following austerity measures passed by the government, Corriere
della Sera reported, citing its own calculations.  Some Italians will have to work 171 days, seven days more
than in 2011, before they pay the equivalent of all their taxes
and contributions, according to the weekly business supplement
of the newspaper.  --  To contact the reporter on this story:
