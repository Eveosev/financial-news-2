Federal Communications Commission
Chairman  Julius Genachowski  proposed measures to keep companies
from billing the government for providing duplicate subsidized
telephones to poor homes.  “Much of the program’s recent growth stems from waste and
abuse, and that can’t continue,” Genachowski said in a speech
in Washington today. Proposed rules, to be sent to fellow
commissioners tomorrow, include creating a national database
listing households eligible for the subsidy, Genachowski said.
The changes require a majority vote from the agency.  The FCC said in March that “in many cases multiple”
wireless companies seek reimbursement for service to the same
residence. The program that provides the payments climbed to
$1.3 billion in 2010 from $667 million in 2000, according to the
agency.  Recent increases stem mainly from the addition of prepaid
wireless service from America Movil SAB’s TracFone, a marketer
of subsidized SafeLink phones, according to a November report
from the  Government Accountability Office , the investigative arm
of Congress.  The low-income assistance is part of an $8 billion program
that pays providers to extend service to rural areas, schools
and libraries. The program operates under a 1996 law designed to
make quality telecommunications service available to all,
according to the FCC.  The fund’s growth has led federal officials to increase
fees that consumers pay to support it.  To contact the reporter on this story:
