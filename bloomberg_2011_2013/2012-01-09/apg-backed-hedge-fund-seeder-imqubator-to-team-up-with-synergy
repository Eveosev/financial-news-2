IMQubator , backed by APG, asset
manager for the biggest Dutch pension fund, has teamed up with
Hong Kong-based Synergy Fund Management to provide capital to
hedge funds in  Asia  to start up or accelerate fundraising.  Synergy, led by Eliza Lau, a former chief executive officer
and chief investment officer of Sail Advisors Ltd., will help
IMQubator find Asian managers, the  Hong Kong  firm said in an e-
mailed statement today. IMQubator will, in turn, advise Synergy
