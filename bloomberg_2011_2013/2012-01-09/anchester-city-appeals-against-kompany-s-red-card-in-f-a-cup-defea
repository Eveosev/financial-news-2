Manchester City said it has appealed
against the red card shown to  Vincent Kompany  in yesterday’s 3-2
loss against  Manchester United  in English soccer’s F.A. Cup.  The Football Association has “confirmed that a hearing
will be held ahead of Wednesday evening’s Carling Cup semifinal
first leg at home to Liverpool,” City  said in a statement  on
its website.  Kompany was dismissed after 12 minutes yesterday at the
Etihad Stadium for a two-footed challenge on Nani. He protested
that he won the ball.  City’s captain would miss four matches if the suspension is
upheld, including both legs of the Carling Cup semifinal.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
