The rand advanced for the first time
in four days, following gains in the euro as the leaders of
Germany and  France  pledged to accelerate a plan to rescue the 17-
nation currency.  South Africa ’s currency appreciated 0.1 percent at 8.168 as
of 5:39 p.m. in Johannesburg, after declining 0.3 percent. It
retreated 0.1 percent against the euro to 10.4061.  The euro, the currency of 30 percent of South Africa’s
trade, gained against the majority of its most-traded peers
after German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President
 Nicolas Sarkozy  said they may complete their new budget rule
book one month ahead of schedule and speed capital contributions
to the bailout fund being set up to stem the debt crisis.  “Markets are likely to take their cue from these
developments,” with the rand likely to react to “changes in
risk sentiment,” Nomvuyo Guma, a Johannesburg-based currency
strategist at Standard Bank Group Ltd., wrote in e-mail
comments.  South Africa’s 8.25 percent bonds due 2017 increased for a
second day, driving the yield down two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 7.53 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
