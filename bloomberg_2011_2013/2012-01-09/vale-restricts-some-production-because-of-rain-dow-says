Vale SA (VALE3) , the world’s biggest  iron ore 
exporter, had “momentary halts” in production in Minas Gerais
state because of heavy rain, Dow Jones Newswires reported.  Rail transport of iron ore from the mines is now
progressing normally, Dow Jones said, citing an unnamed
spokesman for the company. Vale’s press offices in Rio de
Janeiro and Minas Gerais declined to comment when contacted by
Bloomberg News by telephone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
