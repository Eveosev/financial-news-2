Rallies in stocks and gasoline will
push prices toward the highest levels ever in 2012 even as U.S.
Treasury yields hold near record lows.  So say Douglas Kass of Seabreeze Partners Management Inc.,
Citigroup Inc.’s Edward L. Morse and Christopher Low of FTN
Financial, forecasters whose predictions for equities, energy
and bonds proved prescient in 2011. Repeating the feat with
their calls for 2012 would require an unprecedented breakdown in
price relationships across markets after correlations reached
the tightest levels ever.  “They can’t all be right,” Chad Morganlander, a  Florham
Park , New Jersey-based money manager at Stifel Nicolaus & Co.,
which oversees more than $107 billion in client assets, said in
a telephone interview on Jan. 5. “Strategists provide a
valuable role in the financial community, but flexibility of
institutional and individual investors is paramount.”  The diverging views follow a year of near-record volatility
in which just two of 12 Wall Street forecasters tracked by
Bloomberg came within 60 points of the S&P 500’s close and FTN’s
Low was the only economist out of 72 to predict the 10-year
yield would slip to 2 percent. Hedge fund managers posted their
second-worst return on record and investors pulled money from
mutual funds that buy U.S. stocks for a fifth straight year.  Lockstep Moves  Taken together, the outcomes foreseen by Kass and Low would
mean a reversal in lockstep moves between the  S&P 500  and 10-
year yields that have never been greater. Their 30-day
correlation coefficient averaged 0.62 in 2011, the highest
annual level in Bloomberg data going back to 1962. A coefficient
of 1 means assets are moving in unison.  The S&P 500 as of last week had gained 1.6 percent this
year to 1,277.81 after reports on hiring, manufacturing and
construction spending exceeded economist forecasts, spurring
speculation that growth is accelerating in the U.S. The S&P 500
rose 0.2 percent to 1,280.70 today. The average price for a
gallon of gasoline has risen 2.9 percent this year to $3.374,
according to the American Automobile Association, while  10-year
Treasury yields (USGG10YR)  have climbed to 1.97 percent from 1.88 percent.  Kass said in December 2010 that the S&P 500 would end 2011
at 1,257. The benchmark gauge for U.S. equities lost 0.04 point
to 1,257.60 last year, the smallest annual change since 1947.
Now, he says the index will surpass its March 2000 level of
1,527.46, a 21 percent rally from the end of 2011.  ‘Near-Fatal Affliction’  “ Europe  will morph from a near-fatal affliction to a
condition that can be tolerated,” Kass said in a telephone
interview on Jan. 4. “The  U.S. economy  is going to surprise to
the upside,” he said. “Stocks are very, very cheap and I
haven’t felt like this in a long time.”  Low took the opposite view of Kass on Europe in projecting
the yield on benchmark 10-year U.S. notes will hold at 2
percent. The rate peaked at 3.77 percent last year before
finishing within a quarter-percentage point of a record low at
1.88 percent, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices.  “There still hasn’t been a permanent solution for Europe,
there is still lots of uncertainty about the direction of fiscal
policy,” Low said in a telephone interview on Jan. 4. “As far
as the economic picture goes, so many sectors aren’t
contributing.”  Morse, New York-based head of commodities research at
Citigroup Global Markets Inc., says gasoline will climb 19
percent to a $4 a gallon because of the closure of refineries in
the Northeast U.S. Crude oil this year may head the opposite
direction as the dollar strengthens, he said in a Jan. 5
telephone interview.  Dollar Appreciation  “We expect at Citi to see continued dollar appreciation
against the euro -- if not all of 2012, the first half of it,
which should have a drag on commodity prices to the degree that
other factors like the closure of the  Strait of Hormuz  won’t
stand in the way,” Morse said, referring to the oil tanker
shipping route  Iran  has threatened to close.  Morse predicted in 2011 that Europe’s benchmark Brent crude
price would reach a record over its U.S. counterpart. The
premium compared with West Texas Intermediate oil grew to the
widest level ever $27.88 on Oct. 14.  The S&P 500 ended 2011 about 8.3 percent below the 1,371
average strategist estimate from 12 months earlier, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. The gap compares with a 13-year
average of 7.2 percent and is the biggest miss since 2008, when
the index’s 38 percent retreat left it 45 percent below the mean
projection.  ‘Hard Enough’  “Getting the direction right is hard enough, then getting
the absolute level correct is more difficult, particularly if
your underlying assumption around volatility changes,” Barry Knapp, the New York-based head of U.S. equity strategy at
Barclays Plc, said in a telephone interview on Jan. 5.  Knapp raised his forecast for where the S&P 500 would end
2011 to 1,450 from 1,425 in February before taking that forecast
to 1,325 in September and 1,260 in October. The strategist said
in June investors should expect a range between 1,250 to 1,350
on the benchmark index until the end of the year.  War, revolution and natural disasters usually can’t be
anticipated and require reassessment of the market, Morse said.  “The beginning of the Libyan disruption took place before
I left Credit Suisse on Feb. 22, and among the last things I did
was revise an oil outlook based on an assumption that this
disruption was going to last at least six months,” he said.  Strategists and investors struggled last year to anticipate
market moves amid Europe’s sovereign-debt crisis, concerns over
the U.S. economic rebound, uprisings in the  Middle East  and
 Japan ’s March 11 earthquake undermined traditional forecasts.  Dan North, chief U.S. economist at Euler Hermes ACI in
Owings Mills, Maryland, predicted the benchmark 10-year Treasury
note would rise to 5.5 percent at the start of last year. The
estimate was the furthest off in a survey on 51 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg.  “There was a lot to deal with,” North said. “Last year,
the things that economists would academically call exogenous
events -- one-time, outside-of-the-economic-sphere things --
happened again and again and again.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
