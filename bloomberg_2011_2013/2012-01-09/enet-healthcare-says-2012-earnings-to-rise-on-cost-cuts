Tenet Healthcare Corp. (THC) , the third-
largest U.S. hospital operator, said it expects profit before
some items to rise this year as it cuts costs and signs up more
doctors.  Tenet projects earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion in
2012, the Dallas-based company said today in a statement. The
fourth quarter of 2011 may have been hurt by deferral of some
Medicare incentive payments because of a change in accounting
methods, Tenet said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
