Bets on dollar strength have reached
“extreme” territory for the first time since March 2010,
according to Morgan Stanley, citing an aggregate measure
including client flow data and market futures positions.  Buying of the U.S. currency last week by Morgan Stanley’s
clients reached the 85th percentile of the past two years,
Calvin Tse, a London-based currency strategist at the company,
said in an interview. Euro short positions increased, with
 currency trading  by Morgan Stanley clients reaching the 40th
percentile, below the 50th percentile mark that tends to
separate net selling from buying, Tse said.  “This is the first time dollar positioning has been in
extreme long territory since March 2010,” Tse wrote in a report
to clients published today.  The dollar has rallied as slowing global growth and
 Europe ’s debt crisis damped demand for other nations’ currencies
and increased the appeal of the world’s reserve tender.  The U.S. currency rose 1.9 percent to $1.2717 per euro last
week in its biggest five-day advance since Dec. 16. The dollar
depreciated 0.2 percent to $1.2742 at 10:15 a.m. in  New York .
Against the yen, the dollar fell 0.2 percent to 76.85.  Futures trading on the International Monetary Market showed
net dollar long positions reached 126,909 contracts in the week
ended Jan. 3, according to the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission. The measure, which aggregates dollar positions
against the yen, euro, Australian dollar, Swiss franc, Canadian
dollar, pound, Mexican peso and  New Zealand dollar , rose to a
record high 166,591 contracts on Nov. 29.  European Talks  German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  and French President
 Nicolas Sarkozy  held talks in Berlin today to flesh out a new
rulebook for fiscal discipline negotiated at a Dec. 9 summit
that seeks to create a “fiscal compact” for the euro area. The
region has bailed out three nations as its sovereign-debt crisis
roiled investor confidence.  Industrial production in  Germany , Europe’s biggest economy,
dropped 0.6 percent in November after a 0.8 percent increase in
the previous month, a report showed today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
