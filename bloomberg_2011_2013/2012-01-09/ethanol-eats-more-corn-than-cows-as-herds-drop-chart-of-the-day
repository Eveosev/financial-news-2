Ethanol refiners are consuming more
of the U.S. corn crop than livestock producers and will remain
the top users until at least 2014 as government mandates and
exports boost fuel demand, according to North American Risk
Management Services Inc.  The CHART OF THE DAY shows that corn use for ethanol rose
almost fourfold from 1.323 billion bushels in 2005 to 5.021
billion, exceeding 40 percent of the total harvest last year.
Feed, which previously accounted for the biggest share of the
crop, fell 22 percent during the period to 4.792 billion as
livestock and poultry farmers turned to alternative feed,
including dried distillers grain, an ethanol byproduct.  Ethanol may consume as much as 5.1 billion bushels of corn
in the year that began Sept. 1, or 41 percent of the crop,
according to  Jerry Gidel , a market analyst for Chicago-based
North American Risk Management. Feed demand is forecast to drop
to 4.6 billion bushels, the lowest since 1990, after the U.S.
cattle herd on July 1 fell to the smallest for that date since
at least 1973 and chicken producers curbed output because of
poor profit margins from high corn costs, government data show.  “Demand for corn from ethanol producers will likely exceed
feed consumption for at least another 24 months,” Gidel said.
“While the growth in ethanol production will slow, it will take
awhile before meat production expands.”  Chicken output fell 7 percent to 2.943 billion pounds in
November, from 3.165 billion a year earlier, the  U.S. Department
of Agriculture  said on Dec. 23. Wholesale boneless chicken-
breast meat was $1.49 a pound on Jan. 6, below the prior five-
year weekly average of $1.5141 and down from a record $2.625 in
June 2004, USDA data show. U.S. chicken production has exceeded
beef since 1996 and first topped pork in 1988.  “Until chicken producers can consistently make more than
$1.65 for breast meat, they will be slow to increase
production,” Gidel said. “It will take more than two years to
get expansion rolling in the cattle industry.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
