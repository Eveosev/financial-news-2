Chile posted a  trade surplus  of $394
million in December, less than analysts expected, following a
drop in exports from a year earlier, the central bank said.  Exports fell 17 percent to $6.3 billion, while imports
surged 14 percent to $5.9 billion, the bank said today on its
website. The median estimate of six analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg was for a surplus of $958 million. In the full year,
the world’s top  copper producer  posted a trade surplus of $10.6
billion, down from $15.9 billion in 2010.  The trade surplus will shrink to $4.8 billion this year as
the average price of copper slips 13 percent, according to bank
forecasts published Dec. 20. Falling metal prices are one of the
earliest symptoms  Chile  has felt from  Europe ’s sovereign-debt
crisis, Finance Minister Felipe Larrain said last week.  “The effect of the external crisis already has impacted
our country somewhat,” he told reporters in Santiago by
telephone from Paris. “The main mechanism first of all is the
price of copper and secondly a stronger deceleration in the
industrial sector.”  Chilean  copper exports  dropped to $3.2 billion in December
from $3.7 billion in November and $4.6 billion a year ago. The
metal’s price slumped 21 percent last year.  The peso gained 0.2 percent to 510.08 per  U.S. dollar  at
8:32 a.m. Santiago time from 510.93 on Jan. 6.  Industrial production rose 2 percent in November from the
previous year after declining in October, while economic growth
accelerated to 4 percent in November from 3.4 percent in
October, latest official data show.  Gross domestic product expanded 8.3 percent in the first
half of 2011 before moderating to 4.8 percent in the third
quarter, according to central bank data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
