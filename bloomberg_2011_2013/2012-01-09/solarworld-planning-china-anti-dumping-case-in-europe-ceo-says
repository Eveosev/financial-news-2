Solarworld AG (SWV) ,  Germany ’s largest
solar-panel maker, plans to initiate anti-dumping proceedings
against Chinese competitors in  Europe , Chief Executive Officer
Frank Asbeck said.  Solarworld seeks to join forces with European peers to take
its case to the European Commission’s competition agency after
Chinese panels were allegedly dumped in recent months on German
markets at below-market costs, Asbeck said yesterday.  A year-end solar-panel installation rush in Germany, which
added a record 3 gigawatts in December according to the grid
regulator, was sparked in part by “massive” panel inventory
from Chinese manufacturers installed in large-scale solar plants
at “dumping prices,” Asbeck said in a phone interview.  The country’s solar industry had struggled with slowing
demand in the first nine months of 2011, affected by rising
competition from manufacturers in  China .  Solon SE (SOO1) , based in
Berlin, and Solar Millennium AG of Erlangen, Germany, filed for
insolvency last month. Q-Cells is looking for a buyer.  SolarWorld Industries America Inc., the Hillsboro, Oregon-
based division of Germany’s largest photovoltaic panel maker,
last October asked the U.S. government to slap duties on more
than $1 billion of Chinese imports for allegedly undercutting
U.S. manufacturers unfairly using state aid.  To contact the reporter on this story:
