The pound retreated from a 16-month
high against the euro after the leaders of Germany and  France 
met to craft a plan for rescuing the 17-nation common currency.  Gilts were little changed after German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President  Nicolas Sarkozy  held talks in Berlin
to work on a new rulebook for fiscal discipline negotiated at a
Dec. 9 summit. Gains in the pound were also tempered after
Lloyds Bank Corporate Markets said its index of U.K.  job
security  fell to the lowest since the measure began in 2004.  The pound’s retreat “is mostly due to a better euro,”
said Jane Foley, a senior foreign-exchange strategist at
Rabobank International in London. “I think we’ll hear some
positive rhetoric from the politicians after the talks today,
but I don’t think we’ve seen anything that will significantly
change the crisis.”  The pound was little changed at 82.56 pence per euro at
4:57 p.m.  London  time, after rising to 82.22 pence, the
strongest since Sept. 10, 2010. Sterling gained 0.1 percent to
$1.5441. The U.K. currency was little changed at 118.71 yen.  Merkel welcomed progress on talks on the fiscal pact at a
joint press conference with Sarkozy after their meeting and said
there was “very close agreement” between their two countries.
She said euro-area leaders will discuss making the European
bailout fund “more efficient” and that Germany and France were
ready to examine how to speed up capital payments into the
European Stability Mechanism bailout fund.  Job Security  An index of job security in the U.K. slid to minus 33 from
minus 21 in November, the unit of Lloyds Banking Group Plc said
in an e-mailed report. An index of consumers’ inflation
expectations dropped 5 points from November to 65, the lowest
since December 2009.  The  Bank of England  will leave its bond-purchase target
unchanged at its next meeting on Jan. 12, according to all but
one of 41 economists in a Bloomberg News survey. The nine-member
Monetary Policy Committee will leave the benchmark  interest rate 
at a record-low 0.5 percent, a separate survey showed.  The  10-year (GUKG10)  gilt yield fell one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 2.01 percent. The 3.75 percent bond due
September 2021 gained 0.118, or 1.18 pounds per 1,000-pound face
amount, to 115.268.  Two-year (GUKG2)  yields dropped two basis points to
0.39 percent.  Gilts have returned 18 percent in the past year, according
to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of
Financial Analysts Societies. German  government bonds  have
gained 9.6 percent and U.S. Treasuries added 10 percent, the
indexes show.  Sterling has advanced 2.8 percent in the past six months
according to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes, which track
10 developed-nation currencies, the third best performer after
the yen and the dollar.  To contact the reporters on this story:
