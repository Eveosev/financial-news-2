Latvian consumer prices grew at the
slowest pace in 10 months in December as communications and
education costs fell.  The inflation rate dropped to 4 percent from 4.2 percent
the previous month, the  statistics office  in the capital, Riga,
said today on its website. The median estimate of three
economists in a Bloomberg  survey was 4.1 percent (LACPYOY) . Consumer
prices were unchanged from November.  To contact the reporter on this story:
