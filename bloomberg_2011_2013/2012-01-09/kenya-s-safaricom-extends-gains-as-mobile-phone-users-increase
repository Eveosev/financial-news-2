Safaricom Ltd. (SAFCOM) , Kenya’s biggest
mobile-phone operator, gained for a second day after the
industry regulator announced it added more customers than
competitors did.  The stock gained as much as 5 percent to 3.15 shillings and
traded 3.3 percent higher at 3.10 shillings as of the 3:00 p.m.
close in the capital, Nairobi, the longest winning streak since
Dec. 22.  “Increased trading on Safaricom is expected as investors
react to the regulator’s released statistics,” Nairobi-based
Kestrel Capital East Africa Ltd. said in an e-mailed note to
clients today. “The counter closed with pent up demand at the 3
shilling level on Friday.”  Mobile subscribers in the east African nation increased 4.8
percent to 25.3 million in the quarter ended September, Kestrel
said.  During the quarter, Safaricom, which is 40 percent owned by
 Vodafone Plc (VOD) , recorded the highest number of new customers at
593,177, followed by Airtel Networks Kenya Ltd., controlled by
Delhi-based  Bharti Airtel Ltd. (BHARTI) , with 557,567 new subscriptions,
the  Communications Commission of Kenya  said in a statement on
its website on Jan. 6. Essar Telecom Kenya Ltd., a unit of Essar
Group of India, added 46,742 new customers while Telkom Kenya
Ltd., a unit of  France Telecom SA (FTE) , took on 16,683 new clients.  To contact the reporter on this story:
