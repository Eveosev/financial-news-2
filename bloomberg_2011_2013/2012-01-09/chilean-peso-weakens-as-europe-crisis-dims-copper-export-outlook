Chile ’s peso rose to the strongest
level in a month as speculation that  China  will act to spur
growth bolstered appetite for riskier, emerging-market assets.  The peso gained 1 percent to 508.23 per  U.S. dollar , the
highest since Dec. 7, from 513.47 yesterday. Chile’s one-year
interest-rate swap yield rose 3 basis points, or 0.03 percentage
point, to a two-month high of 4.66 percent.  Copper, which accounts for half of Chile’s exports, rose
the most in a week as imports of the metal into China advanced
for a seventh month. China’s overall import growth fell to a
two-year low, spurring bets the government will use monetary
easing to boost domestic demand. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
climbed to the highest level in five months as Alcoa Inc.’s
revenue beat analysts’ estimates.  “Today markets are very positive; commodities are rising
and copper is gaining more than 2 percent,” said Eugenio Cortes, head of currency forwards at Euroamerica Corredores de
Bolsa SA. “The peso may move between 507 and 514, with a higher
probability of breaking 507 and testing 500 per dollar.”  Chilean economists forecast policy makers will delay a
decision to reduce  borrowing costs  after inflation exceeded
estimates last month, according to a survey published by the
central bank today.  The bank will keep the benchmark  interest rate  at 5.25
percent this week, analysts said, after forecasting a cut in
last month’s survey. Borrowing costs will fall to 5 percent in
February and to 4.25 percent by the end of 2012, according to
the median estimate of economists in the survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
