Citadel Capital SAE (CCAP) , an Egyptian
private equity company, said one of its investment funds agreed
to sell its stake in National Petroleum Co. Egypt Ltd. to  Sea
Dragon Energy Inc. (SDX)  for $147.5 million.  Golden Crescent Investments Ltd. will receive $60 million
in cash and 350 million shares of Sea Dragon at 25 cents each,
the Cairo-based company said in an e-mailed statement today. The
transaction is due to be completed by late February or early
March, it said.  “This is the first of several transactions to which we
have alluded in recent months that will see  Citadel Capital 
rationalize its portfolio through the divestiture of some non-
core investments,” Citadel Capital Chairman Ahmed Heikal said
in the statement.  Shares of Citadel (CCAP)  retreated 2.8 percent to 2.43 Egyptian
pounds, the lowest level since they were listed in December
2009, at the 2:30 p.m. close in Cairo. The stock plunged 72
percent last year compared with a drop of 49 percent for the
benchmark  EGX 30 Index. (EGX30)   To contact the reporter on this story:
