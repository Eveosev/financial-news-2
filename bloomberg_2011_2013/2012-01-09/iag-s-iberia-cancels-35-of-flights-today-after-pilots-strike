Iberia, the Spanish airline unit of
 International Consolidated Airlines Group SA (IAG) , canceled 109
flights today as pilots’ union Sepla called a strike to protest
against the creation of a lower-cost carrier for short-haul
flights, following strikes last month.  Iberia canceled 35 percent of its flights today, including
international and national trips, affecting about 11,600
passengers, the Madrid-based company said in a statement today.
Sepla said it will also call a strike on Jan. 11.  The company, which merged with British Airways last year to
create IAG, plans to transfer planes to the Iberia Express unit
this year to boost the profitability of domestic and European
services.  Iberia said it offered alternative flights with Iberia and
other airlines to customers affected by the strikes. It also
offered ticket refunds for those who didn’t want to fly.  Spain ’s government set a minimum of services last week for
the pilots’ strikes, saying the airline has to offer 50 percent
of flights between Spanish cities more than 500 kilometers (311
miles) apart and on international routes of more than six hours.  -- Editors: Robert Valpuesta, David Risser.  To contact the reporter on this story:
