The  European Central Bank  said
overnight deposits from commercial banks rose to a record.  Euro-area banks parked 463.6 billion euros ($591 billion)
with the Frankfurt-based ECB on Jan. 6, up from the previous
record of 455.3 billion euros set a day earlier. That’s the most
since the euro was introduced in 1999.  The ECB last month loaned 523 banks a record 489 billion
euros for three years to keep credit flowing to the 17-nation
euro economy during the sovereign debt crisis. It loaned the
money at its  benchmark rate (EURR002W)  of 1 percent. The surge in deposits
suggests banks are placing excess cash back with the ECB at the
overnight rate of 0.25 percent, incurring a loss rather than
lending it for more elsewhere.  Deposits “have to stay high, given the excess liquidity in
the system,” said  Laurent Fransolet , head of fixed income
strategy at  Barclays Capital  in London. “Banks cannot do
anything except redeposit, so deposit-facility usage will remain
very high.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
