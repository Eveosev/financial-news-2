Tim Tebow  and the Denver Broncos’
one-play overtime win over the Pittsburgh Steelers drew the best
preliminary television rating for a National Football League
wild-card playoff game in 24 years.  The 29-23 win last night at Mile High Stadium in Denver,
which included a career-high 316 yards passing by Tebow, was
seen on CBS in an average of 25.9 percent of homes in the top 56
U.S. television markets, the  CBS Corp. (CBS)  network said in a
statement. That’s the best first-round rating since a game
between the Seattle Seahawks and Houston Oilers in 1988, which
also went to overtime and drew a 26.7.  The New York Giants’ 24-2 home win yesterday over the
 Atlanta Falcons  drew an 18.9 major-market rating on Fox,  Lou D’Ermilio , a spokesman for the  News Corp. (NWSA)  network, said in an e-
mail.  The Broncos’ win, which snapped a three-game losing streak,
came as Tebow ran for one touchdown and passed for two others,
including an 80-yarder to Demaryius Thomas that ended the game
on the first play from scrimmage of the extra period,
eliminating the six-time Super Bowl champion Steelers. The
overtime drew a 31.6 television rating.  Tebow led the team to five fourth-quarter comebacks for
victories in the regular season. The 24-year-old Tebow, a devout
Christian, was one of the dominant storylines of the NFL season,
spawning a fad known as “Tebowing” through his kneel-and-pray
pose after victories.  Patriots Game  Denver also won overtime games against the  San Diego
Chargers  and  Chicago Bears  during a six-game winning streak that
put them into playoff contention. The run was snapped in a 41-23
home loss on Dec. 18 to the New England Patriots (13-3), the
team they’ll face in Foxborough, Massachusetts, on Jan. 14.  Denver, which won the AFC West title with an 8-8 record,
played in the first round as a division champion against the
Steelers (12-5), who gained one of two wild cards in each
conference for the teams with the best records among non-
division winners. The Patriots, with the conference’s best
record, got a first-round bye.  The New Orleans Saints’ 45-28 win over the Detroit Lions
two nights ago on Comcast Corp.’s NBC earned a 19.3 major-market
rating. It was the third-highest rating for the primetime
Saturday wild-card game since the 1999 season, though lower than
last year’s 20.8 rating for the  New York  Jets’ 17-16 win over
the  Indianapolis Colts .  The early NFL game on Jan. 7, a 31-10 win by the Houston
Texans over the  Cincinnati Bengals  that was also aired on NBC,
drew a 15.3 major-market rating, lower than last year’s 18.3
rating for the Seattle Seahawks’ win over the Saints.  In other second-round playoff games, the Saints (14-3) will
be at the San Francisco 49ers (13-3) on Jan. 14, while the
Texans (11-6) visit the Baltimore Ravens (12-4) and the Giants
(10-7) play at the defending Super Bowl-champion Green Bay
Packers (15-1) on Jan. 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
