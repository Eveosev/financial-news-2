Following is the text of U.S. employment trends index
from the Conference Board.  The Conference Board Employment Trends Index increased 0.66% in December to
104.32, from the revised figure of 103.64 in November. The December figure is also
up 4.7 percent from the same month a year ago.  “Job growth is picking up some steam in the U.S.,” says  Gad Levanon , Director
of Macroeconomic Research at The Conference Board. “The Employment Trends Index has
been signaling this growth for three straight months now. However, last Friday’s
employment data -- with a reported gain of 200,000 jobs in December -- likely
overstates the trend. We don’t expect overall economic activity to grow fast enough
to sustain such rapid job gains throughout the first half of 2012.”  This month’s strength in the ETI was driven by positive contributions from six
of the eight components. The improving indicators include “Jobs Hard to Get”
responses from The Conference Board Consumer Confidence Survey, Initial Claims for
 Unemployment Insurance , Part-Time Workers for Economic Reasons,  Job Openings ,
 Industrial Production , and Real Manufacturing and Trade Sales.  The Employment Trends Index aggregates eight labor-market indicators, each of
which has proven accurate in its own area. Aggregating individual indicators into a
composite index filters out “noise” to show underlying trends more clearly.  The eight labor-market indicators aggregated into the Employment Trends Index
include:  Percentage of Respondents Who Say They Find “Jobs Hard to Get” (The Conference
Board Consumer Confidence Survey)  Initial Claims for Unemployment Insurance (U.S. Department of Labor)  Percentage of Firms With Positions Not Able to Fill Right Now (National
Federation of Independent Business Research Foundation)  Number of Employees Hired by the Temporary-Help Industry ( U.S. Bureau of Labor
Statistics )  Part-Time Workers for Economic Reasons (BLS)  Job Openings (BLS)  Industrial Production (Federal Reserve Board)  Real Manufacturing and Trade Sales (U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis)  The Conference Board publishes the Employment Trends Index monthly, at 10 a.m.
ET on the Monday that follows each Friday release of the Bureau of Labor Statistics
