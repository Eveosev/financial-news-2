The  Philippines  must increase
borrowing from the domestic market to take advantage of “ample
liquidity” and curb foreign-currency risks, central bank
Governor Amando Tetangco said in an interview in Manila.  This will “limit the impact on the exchange rate of strong
capital inflows,” the governor said today. “This is a sensible
policy, given the prevailing uncertainty in the global economy
as well as the European debt crisis.”  The central bank is asking Congress to approve amendments
to its charter that will allow it to sell its own debt to
achieve greater flexibility in maintaining monetary stability,
he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
