The yield on  Egypt ’s 10-year dollar
bonds rose to a record amid investor concern about political
tensions and deteriorating finances.  The rate on the 5.75 percent notes maturing in April 2020
gained 15 basis points, or 0.15 percentage point, to 8.42
percent at 12:14 p.m. in Cairo. The  Finance Ministry  plans to
sell 6.5 billion Egyptian pounds ($1.1 billion) of treasury
bills and bonds at auctions today.  Voters in the North African country are scheduled to
complete elections for the lower house of parliament in the next
two weeks, leading up to the first anniversary of the revolt
that ousted former President  Hosni Mubarak . An International
Monetary Fund mission will visit on Jan. 15 to resume talks on a
$3.2 billion loan, Al Ahram newspaper reported yesterday. The
government had turned down the funds in June.  “There’s some pessimism in the market about where the
country is going,” said Gabriel Sterne, a London-based senior
economist at Exotix Holdings Ltd. “Egypt needs a heavy dose of
traditional IMF medicine, including reducing  budget deficit  and
cutting fuel subsidies.”  International reserves (EGIRES)  declined to $18.1 billion in
December from $20.2 billion the previous month. Reserves reached
$36 billion in December 2010. “The decline in reserves is a
genuinely worrying development over the last two months,”
Sterne said.  The government is offering 2 billion pounds of three-month
bills and 3.5 billion pounds of nine-month notes at the sale,
according to  Central Bank  of Egypt data on Bloomberg. It is also
seeking 1 billion pounds from the sale of seven-year bonds.  Egypt last issued seven-year bonds in October at an average
yield of 14.52 percent. Political tensions have lifted the
country’s borrowing costs. The average yield on nine-month bills
rose to 15.307 percent at the previous sale on Dec. 28, the
highest level since Bloomberg started tracking the data in 2006.  To contact the reporter on this story:
