Solon SE (SOO1) , a German solar-panel maker
in bankruptcy proceedings, is in talks with a “handful” of
possible buyers as a bid deadline was set for the month’s end.  They include “domestic and international strategic
investors, including from  Asia ,” Ruediger Wienberg, insolvency
administrator at HWW Wienberg Wilhelm, said by phone today.  The company has a “strong introduced brand and a
professional, functioning sales network,” Wienberg said in an
earlier e-mailed statement. “I, therefore, see chances to find
a strong partner for Solon, willing to invest in the future.”  Solon fell 6.3 percent to 40.5 euro cents by the Frankfurt
close, erasing an earlier gain of as much as 18 percent and
giving the company a value of 7 million euros ($8.9 million).  Wages for employees have been secured through February and
the company’s sales are continuing, according to the statement.  Solon became Germany’s first publicly traded solar company
to file for insolvency in December after the failure of talks
with creditors on extending a year-end deadline to repay 275
million euros to lenders including Deutsche Bank AG.  Germany  is
the world’s biggest solar market.  To contact the reporter on this story:
