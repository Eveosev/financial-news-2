Lionel Messi  was crowned soccer’s
best player for a record third straight time last night to cap a
year in which his Barcelona team won the  Champions League , the
Spanish championship and the Club World Cup.  The Argentine forward, 24, joins former World Cup winners
 Zinedine Zidane  of France and Ronaldo of Brazil as three-time
winners. He took the prize ahead of his Barcelona teammate  Xavi Hernandez  and Real Madrid forward Cristiano Ronaldo.  Last year, Messi became the first player to claim the
current  FIFA  Ballon d’Or trophy, a prize created when soccer’s
ruling body merged its top player accolade with France Football
magazine’s award. France’s  Michel Platini  won that prize three-
straight times between 1983 and 1985.  Messi’s alliance with Xavi and  Andres Iniesta  has helped
Barcelona win titles in Spain and  Europe . He scored in the 3-1
Champions League final victory over  Manchester United  that gave
Barcelona its second European Cup win in three seasons, two
weeks after the team retained its Spanish league title. Messi
scored two goals in Yokohama, Japan, last month to give
Barcelona the FIFA World Club Cup as well.  “I just try to enjoy every moment,” Messi told reporters
before the award ceremony in Zurich. “I’ve been able to enjoy
some great experiences and win titles.”  Messi polled the highest number of votes from national team
coaches, captains and selected journalists. FIFA’s original
award, established in 1991, didn’t survey the media.  Runaway Winner  Messi received 48 percent of the votes, Ronaldo got 22
percent and Xavi 9.2 percent. They were shortlisted following a
vote that included 23 players.  Manchester United manager  Alex Ferguson , whose teams have
lost to Barcelona in two Champions League finals, said Messi
ranks among the game’s all-time greats. He likened him to fellow
Argentine  Diego Maradona , Pele and Alfredo di Stefano.  “Messi could play in any generation,” Ferguson said.
“The Barcelona team right now, with Lionel in their side, are
an extraordinary side.”  Ferguson was awarded FIFA’s Presidential Award for his
success during three decades as a manager. Last season he won
his 12th Premier League title with United, a record 19th in all
for the Red Devils.  Nicknamed “the Flea” because of his 5-foot-6 1/2 (1.69-
meter) frame, Messi trained at Barcelona’s academy after moving
to Spain from Argentina for treatment of a growth deficiency
when he was 13. He made his debut at 16.  The forward’s contract runs to 2016 and has a 250 million-
euro ($323 million) buyout clause.  Argentina Record  Messi so far has been unable to match his club success on
the international stage. Last year’s Copa America host Argentina
was eliminated in the quarterfinals by eventual winner Uruguay.
Messi failed to score in the competition.  Platini said Messi probably requires a  World Cup  win to be
considered the greatest, saying Maradona retains the fame he has
because of Argentina’s 1986 World Cup win, not because of the
titles he won at club level with Napoli.  “The World Cup is something special,” Platini told
reporters. “The World Cup would stay in the minds of the
people.”  With 31 goals in 27 games this season, Messi is on course
to beat the Barcelona record he set in April by scoring 53 goals
in a season.  Messi’s manager at Barcelona, Pep Guardiola, was named
Coach of the Year ahead of Ferguson and Real Madrid’s  Jose Mourinho .  Brazilian forward Neymar beat United’s  Wayne Rooney  and
Messi to the award for Goal of the Year for his strike in a
league game for Santos, while Japan’s Homare Sawa was named best
female player.
