Financial companies in Britain (F3BANK)  may
have shed almost a tenth of their jobs by the end of the first
quarter since the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.,
according to a survey by Britain’s biggest business lobby group.  In the fourth quarter, banks, insurers and asset managers
probably cut 9,000 jobs, and may shed 11,000 workers in the
first three months this year, the survey by the  Confederation of
British Industry  estimated. The new losses would mean that since
Lehman’s collapse in 2008, about 101,000 jobs will have been
lost in an industry that employs 1.05 million people in the
U.K., or about 9.6 percent, the CBI said.  “Most notably, headcount fell in banking; that was the
fastest rate of fall,”  Ian McCafferty , the confederation’s
chief economic adviser, said at a conference with journalists
before the research was published.  Job vacancies at London’s financial-services firms fell by
43 percent in December, the biggest drop in two years, a
separate survey by recruiter  Astbury Marsden  showed today.  The number of new job openings in the City, London’s main
financial district, declined to 1,490 in December from 2,620 in
the year-earlier period, Astbury Marsden said in a statement.
That’s the biggest fall since January 2010.  The total number of City vacancies created in 2011 fell 8
percent to 54,020 from the year-earlier period, Astbury Marsden
said. There were 3.16 qualified candidates for each City job in
2011 compared with 2.17 in 2010, Astbury Marsden said.  Revenue Rises  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) ,  Europe ’s largest bank, and  Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc (RBS)  said in August they planned to cut 30,000 and
2,000 jobs respectively.  Barclays Plc (BARC)  said it would eliminate
about 3,000 positions and  Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY)  said it plans
to lose 15,000 jobs.  The CBI survey found 53 percent of firms saw sales rise in
the quarter to December and 24 percent reported a fall.  “In spite of that, firms are less optimistic than they
have been,” McCafferty said. “As a result they are expecting a
slight moderation in activity over the course of the coming
quarter.”  The CBI and PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, which helped
compile the report, surveyed 106 banks, insurers, customer-owned
lenders, investment managers and securities firms from Nov. 21
to Dec. 7.  To contact the reporters on this story:
