U.S. Interior Secretary  Ken Salazar 
will announce a 20-year ban on uranium mining near the Grand
Canyon, according to an environmental group monitoring the issue.  Salazar will impose a moratorium today on new mining claims
on 1 million acres of public land around the Arizona tourist
site, according to a representative of the group who spoke on
condition of anonymity before the official announcement.  A press conference scheduled in  Washington  will be about
the “conservation of the Grand Canyon,” the Interior
Department website said. Agency spokesman Adam Fetcher declined
in an e-mail to provide details, which were reported earlier by
the New York Times and the  Associated Press .  In the  proposal  for the ban, published Oct. 26, the Obama
administration planned to permit previously allowed mines, as
well as development on existing claims. As many as 11 mines may
operate in the area near the national park in the next two
decades, the Interior Department said in October.  Environmental groups including the San Francisco-based
Sierra Club have said mine-related waste threatens the region’s
land, wildlife and drinking water.  Twelve lawmakers including Republican Senators  John McCain 
of Arizona, and Orrin Hatch and  Mike Lee  of Utah, introduced a
 bill  on Oct. 12 to prevent the administration from imposing the
ban. The bill number is S. 1690.  The action would declare a “‘de facto’ wilderness” on
land that had been accessible for mining, according to a
statement posted on McCain’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
