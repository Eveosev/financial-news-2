The Philippine central bank’s
monetary board has approved a plan to allow the country to
invest some reserves in  China ’s currency as part of
diversification, according to Governor Amando Tetangco.  Any investments in the yuan will be part of the central
bank’s non-reserve assets until the currency is fully
convertible, Tetangco said in an interview today.  “There’s been a shift in some currencies” in the reserves,
Tetangco said. The  Philippines  has included the Australian
dollar, while reducing its investment in the euro, he said.  Between 50 percent and 60 percent of the Philippines’ $75
billion reserves are in U.S. currency, followed by the yen,
Tetangco said. He declined to say how much investment in the
euro the country holds.  To contact the reporters on this story:
