Ethanol futures advanced to a five-
week high in  Chicago  as bad weather in  South America  threatens
corn crops.  Futures followed corn higher on speculation South American
corn has been damaged by hot, dry weather, which could translate
to increased demand for U.S. supply. Ethanol is made from the
grain in the U.S.  “They know we’re going to have shortages of corn in South
America,” said  Dan Flynn , a trader at PFG Best in Chicago.
“That’s going to play right into the hands of the ethanol
market. It’s going to be more expensive to make.”  Denatured ethanol for February delivery rose 3.5 cents, or
1.6 percent, to settle at $2.258 a gallon on the Chicago Board
of Trade, the highest price since Dec. 5. Futures have fallen
0.8 percent in the past year.  In cash market trading, ethanol in the U.S. Gulf declined 3
cents, or 1.3 percent, to $2.295 a gallon and in  New York  the
additive increased 1.5 cents, or 0.7 percent, to $2.315,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in Chicago added 1 cent, or 0.5 percent, to $2.205
a gallon and on the West Coast, the biofuel climbed 1 cent, or
0.4 percent, to $2.33.  Corn futures for March delivery rose 8.5 cents, or 1.3
percent, to $6.52 a bushel in Chicago, gaining for the first
time since Jan. 3. One bushel makes at least 2.75 gallons of
ethanol.  To contact the reporter on this story:
