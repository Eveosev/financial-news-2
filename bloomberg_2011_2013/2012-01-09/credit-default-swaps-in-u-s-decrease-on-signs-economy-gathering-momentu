A benchmark gauge of U.S. company
credit risk decreased for the first time in four days on
evidence America’s economic recovery may weather  Europe ’s
sovereign-debt turmoil.  The Markit CDX North America Investment Grade Index of
credit-default swaps, which investors use to hedge against
losses on corporate debt or to speculate on creditworthiness,
fell 0.8 basis point to a mid-price of 119.3 basis points at
5:11 p.m. in New York, according to Markit Group Ltd.  The gauge slid earlier by as much as 1.1 basis points as
French President Nicolas Sarkozy won the backing of German
Chancellor  Angela Merkel  for a tax on financial transactions.
Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis President James Bullard said
on Jan. 7 in Chicago that the central bank probably won’t begin
a new round of bond purchases after “encouraging” data last
week showing the  U.S. economy  gained 200,000 jobs in December.  Corporate portfolio managers “are not incentivized to do
anything one way or another,”  Adrian Miller , fixed-income
strategist at Miller Tabak Roberts Securities LLC in New York,
said by e-mail. They’re “content to see what comes out of
today’s Merkel-Sarkozy meeting,” he said.  The index, which typically falls as investor confidence
improves and rises as it deteriorates, fell to 118.1 basis
points on Jan. 3, the lowest since Oct. 28.  Credit swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails
to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A
basis point equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10
million of debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
