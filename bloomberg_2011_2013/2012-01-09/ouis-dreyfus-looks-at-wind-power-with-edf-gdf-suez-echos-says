Louis Dreyfus Armateurs SAS is
talking to EDF Energies Nouvelles SA and GDF Suez SA about
participating in a wind-power generating venture sought by the
French state,  Les Echos  reported, without saying where it got
the information.  Louis Dreyfus’s role would be to provide transport for
subassemblies of  wind turbines  to the port where they’ll be
assembled, as well as installing and maintaining the cables that
link the wind-power turbines to the exterior, the newspaper
said. EDF and GDF Suez are each leading groups to compete for the
business.  France is seeking to boost renewable energy such as solar
and wind. It has no offshore wind power now, and is aiming to
install about 1,200 wind turbines, by 2020.  Link to Company News:{985491Z FP <Equity> CN}
