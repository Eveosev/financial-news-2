Argentina may force companies
including  YPF SA (YPFD)  to sell premium gasoline for the price of
lower-quality fuel in the case of shortages, El Cronista
reported, without saying how it got the information.  The measure means  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) ,  Petroleo
Brasileiro SA (PETR4)  and other distributors would have to sell premium
gasoline at an 18 percent discount, the Buenos Aires-based
newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
