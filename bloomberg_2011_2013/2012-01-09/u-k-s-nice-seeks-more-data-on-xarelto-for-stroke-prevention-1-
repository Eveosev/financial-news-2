The U.K.’s National Institute for
Health and Clinical Excellence requested more information about
trial results for  Bayer AG (BAYN) ’s Xarelto blood-thinner for stroke
prevention before making a decision on approving the drug.  “The population included in the single trial presented by
the manufacturer as evidence of rivaroxaban’s cost-effectiveness
was not reflective of all the people with atrial fibrillation in
the U.K. who would be eligible for treatment with the drug,”
the agency, known as NICE, said today in an e-mailed statement.
Rivaroxaban is the chemical name for Xarelto.  Xarelto, taken once a day, is vying with drugs developed by
Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH, Pfizer Inc. and Bristol-Myers Squibb
Co. to become the dominant replacement for warfarin, the half-
century-old standard of care for preventing stroke in heart
attack victims and other patients. Peak sales of Xarelto may
exceed 2 billion euros ($2.6 billion) a year, Bayer said last
month.  Xarelto “represents a significant potential benefit for
people with atrial fibrillation because it doesn’t require
regular monitoring and dose adjustments,” NICE said in the
statement.  Public comments on the draft decision will be accepted
until Jan. 30, NICE said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
