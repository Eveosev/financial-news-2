Krauss-Maffei Wegmann GmbH plans to
buy the armor-plating unit of EDAG GmbH,  Financial Times
Deutschland  said, citing spokesmen from both German companies.  EDAG makes armor plates for carmaker Audi in Ingolstadt,
 Germany  and  Mexico  while Krauss-Maffei supplies protection
systems for Bayerische Motoren Werke AG, the German newspaper
said. The companies plan to expand the civilian business both at
home and abroad to cushion the impact of tightening of military
budgets, FTD said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
