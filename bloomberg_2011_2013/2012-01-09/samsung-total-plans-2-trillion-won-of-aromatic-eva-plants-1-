Samsung Total Petrochemicals Co. (SAMTPCZ) , an
ethylene producer owned by Samsung Group and Total SA, plans to
spend 2 trillion won ($1.7 billion) building an aromatic complex
and an ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer plant by 2014.  The proposed aromatic complex in Daesan, southwest of
Seoul, will have an annual output capacity of 1 million metric
tons of paraxylene and 420,000 tons of benzene, the company said
in an e-mailed statement today. Paraxylene is a raw material to
make synthetic fibers, while benzene is used to make
petrochemical products such as styrene.  The plant for EVA, used in electrical cable and adhesives,
will have a capacity of 240,000 tons a year when it’s completed
by April 2014, the Daesan-based company said.  Samsung Total’s revenue will rise to 12 trillion won in
2015 after the projects are completed, from an estimated 7
trillion won in 2011, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
