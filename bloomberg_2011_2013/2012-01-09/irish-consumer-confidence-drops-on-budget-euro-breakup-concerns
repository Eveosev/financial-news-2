Irish  consumer confidence (IECSINDX)  plunged the
most in a decade in December as the government unveiled new
budget cuts and households grew more concerned about a breakup
of the euro area.  The consumer sentiment index fell to 49.2 from 60.1 in
November, and the 10.9-point drop was the biggest since August
2001, KBC Bank Ireland and the Economic & Social Research
Institute in Dublin said today in an e-mailed statement. A gauge
of consumers’ outlook for the economy dropped to the lowest in
11 months.  “We previously cautioned that the rise in consumer
sentiment in October looked somewhat excessive,” said  Austin Hughes , chief economist at KBC Bank Ireland, referring to the
gauge’s surge to 63.7 from 53.3 in September. “We think the
drop in the index in December may also be exaggerated.”  A gauge of consumers’ view of current economic conditions
fell to 74.2 from 80.1, while expectations for the next 12
months dropped to 32.4, the lowest since January 2011, from
46.6.  To contact the reporters on this story:
