Russia , the world’s biggest energy
exporter, may reduce  duties  on most oil shipments abroad by 8.9
percent from Aug. 1 after Urals prices fell, while extending tax
breaks for offshore fields and highly viscous crude.  The standard export duty may fall to $336.60 a metric ton,
or $45.92 a barrel, from $369.30 a ton this month, according to
Bloomberg calculations based on Finance Ministry data.  Russia’s government is extending tax breaks for offshore
and hard-to-recover resources to stimulate output and meet
President  Vladimir Putin ’s goal of keeping production at more
than 10 million barrels a day, a post-Soviet high. Oil and gas
provided half of budget revenue last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
