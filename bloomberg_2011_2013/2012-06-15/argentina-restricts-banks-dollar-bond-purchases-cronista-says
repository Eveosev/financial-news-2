Argentina ’s central bank is banning
banks from buying dollar-denominated bonds locally and then
paying for them abroad, El Cronista reported citing central bank
sources it didn’t name.  The measure comes as lenders increasingly use this
arrangement to pull U.S. currency from the country, the Buenos
Aires-based newspaper said. About $50 million per month was
leaving Argentina through such transactions, Cronista said.  The mechanism is similar to the so-called blue chip swap,
where investors buy securities locally using pesos and then sell
them abroad to get dollars, except banks use dollars to buy the
bonds, Cronista said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
