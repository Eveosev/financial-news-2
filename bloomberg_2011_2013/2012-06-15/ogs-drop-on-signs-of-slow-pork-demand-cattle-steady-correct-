(Corrects production forecast and estimate in second
paragraph to 2012 output estimates.)  Hog prices fell, heading for the
biggest drop in almost four weeks on speculation that demand for
pork in the U.S. will slow. Cattle were little changed.  Meatpackers processed 1.573 million hogs in the first four
days of this week, down 2.3 percent from the same period a week
earlier, U.S. Department of Agriculture data showed. Pork
production in the U.S. will rise 2.7 percent to 23.4 billion
pounds (10.6 million metric ton s) in 2012 from a year earlier,
the government said in a report  June 12.  “Longer-term pork fundamentals, both supply and demand,
are quite negative,”  Dennis Smith , a senior account executive
at Archer Financial Services in Chicago, said in a telephone
interview. “Overall, I’m just not bullish on the hog market.”  Hog futures for August settlement slid 0.8 percent to 92.25
cents a pound at 10:16 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
A close at that level would be the biggest decline for the most-
active contract since May 21. Prices rose 10 percent this year
through yesterday.  Wholesale  pork  climbed 2.6 percent to 91.58 cents
yesterday, the highest since Nov. 7, USDA data show. Prices are
up 7.5 percent this year.  “The product is a really forced affair,” Smith said.
“The packers are able to ask higher prices and receive it, but
only because we’ve tightened up a little bit on the supplies.”  Cattle futures for August delivery fell 0.2 percent to
$1.16825 a pound in  Chicago . Through yesterday, the commodity
was down 3.6 percent in 2012.  Feeder-cattle futures for August settlement added 0.2
percent to $1.5655 a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
