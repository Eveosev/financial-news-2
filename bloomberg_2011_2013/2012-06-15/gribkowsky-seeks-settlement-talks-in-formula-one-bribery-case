The former Bayerische Landesbank
executive on trial for allegedly soliciting bribes to facilitate
the 2005 sale of Formula One racing is holding talks with
prosecutors to resolve the case.  Judges in Munich today postponed closing arguments in the
trial against Gerhard Gribkowsky to give both sides time for the
talks, Margarete Noetzel, a spokeswoman for the court, said in
an e-mailed statement. Gribkowsky’s lawyers sought the
negotiations, she said.  Gribkowsky, who managed Munich-based BayernLB’s interest in
Formula One as the bank’s chief risk officer, was charged with
accepting bribes, breach of trust and  tax evasion . Prosecutors
said at a trial that started in October that he received $44
million to facilitate the sale of the bank’s 47 percent stake to
CVC Capital Partners Ltd.  Gribkowsky demanded $50 million from Formula One Chief
Executive Officer  Bernie Ecclestone  as a reward for consenting
to the sale and threatened to disclose possible tax violations
by a family trust run by Ecclestone’s then wife, prosecutors
said.  Gribkowsky’s defense has denied the charges and he hasn’t
made any statements to the court.  German criminal procedure rules allow talks to reach an
“understanding” on the progress and outcome of a trial. Part
of such an agreement could include a confession.  To contact the reporter on this story:
