The European Stability Mechanism,
the euro-area’s permanent rescue fund, should provide loans
directly to lenders to support the region’s banking system, the
BusinessEurope employers’ federation said.  “Action should be taken both by using the existing
available tools and by considering other means which can
effectively stabilize European banks and protect the entire  euro
zone ,” the group said in a statement published out of
Copenhagen today.  The ability for the ESM to lend directly to banks should 
come with rights to impose "strict conditions and the necessary
means to do oversight," the federation said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
