Gasoline rose the most in almost
four weeks as demand for the motor fuel surged and on
speculation the  Federal Reserve  will act to boost the  U.S.
economy .  Futures gained after deliveries of the fuel to wholesalers
surged 5.6 percent last week to the highest level since August,
based on Energy Department data. Manufacturing in New York
expanded in June at the slowest pace in seven months and U.S.
industrial production slipped.  “This week’s sizeable increase in demand might have
something to do with it,” said  Gene McGillian , an analyst and
broker at Tradition Energy in Stamford, Connecticut.  Gasoline for July delivery rose 2.53 cents, or 1 percent,
to settle at $2.7017 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . It was the third consecutive gain and the largest
increase since May 21.  New York  Fed’s general economic  index  dropped to 2.3 this
month from 17.1 in May. The Federal Open Market Committee meets
June 19-20, two days after a national election in Greece that
may deepen a debt crisis in Europe that threatens U.S. economic
growth.  Industrial production in the U.S. fell 0.1 percent last
month, below the median forecast of a 0.1 percent increase in a
Bloomberg News survey.  Heating oil for July delivery rose 1.87 cents, or 0.7
percent, to $2.6465 a gallon.  Regular gasoline at the pump, averaged nationwide, fell 0.8
cent to $3.524 a gallon yesterday, according to AAA. It was the
lowest price since Feb. 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
