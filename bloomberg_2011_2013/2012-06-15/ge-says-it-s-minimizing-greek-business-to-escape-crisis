General Electric Co. (GE) , the world’s
biggest maker of  jet engines , power generation equipment and
health-care imaging devices, said it’s minimizing business done
in Greece to reduce effects of the sovereign-debt crisis.  GE has no more than 100 million euros ($126 million) in
sales in Greece, mostly in the health care industry, said
Ferdinando Beccalli-Falco, head of GE’s European and North Asian
operations, said today at a press briefing in Frankfurt. The
manager said he isn’t aware of any unusual delays in payments
from Greek customers, which don’t include state institutions.  “We have built in firewalls and minimized the amount of
business we do in Greece,” Beccalli-Falco said. “We are taking
all the steps necessary,” he said, without elaborating.  To contact the reporters on this story:
