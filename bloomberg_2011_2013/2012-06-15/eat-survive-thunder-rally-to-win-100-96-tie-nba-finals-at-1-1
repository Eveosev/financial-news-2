LeBron James  scored 32 points as the
Miami Heat survived a fourth-quarter rally by the Oklahoma City
Thunder to win 100-96 and even the National Basketball
Association Finals at one game each.  The Thunder, who trailed 27-15 after the first quarter and
78-67 at the end of the third, got within two points of Miami
with 37 seconds remaining in the game before James hit two free
throws to seal the victory.  “We withstand rallies,” James said in a televised
interview. “I was glad I had a good bucket and some free throws
down the stretch.”  Dwyane Wade  had 24 points and Shane Battier added 17 for
the Heat, who never trailed at Chesapeake Energy Arena in
Oklahoma City last night.  Chris Bosh  contributed 16 points and
15 rebounds.  Kevin Durant scored 32 points and  Russell Westbrook  had 27
for the Thunder, who suffered their first defeat in 10
postseason games at home after overcoming a 13-point deficit in
Game 1 to win 105-94.  “We did a good job of contesting their shots more than we
did in Game 1,” James said.  The best-of-seven series now moves to Miami for games on
June 17, 19 and 21.  To contact the reporter on this story:
