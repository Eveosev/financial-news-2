Ethanol tumbled as corn, the primary
ingredient in the fuel additive, fell the most in three weeks.  Futures followed corn lower on concern that demand for the
grain will wane because of larger crops overseas. One bushel of
corn makes at least 2.75 gallons of ethanol.  “Everyone’s kind of unwinding stuff today,” said Will Babler, a broker at First Capitol Risk Management in Galena,
 Illinois . “People are trying to get out of everything heading
into the weekend.”  Denatured ethanol for July delivery slumped 3.8 cents, or
1.8 percent, to settle at $2.027 a gallon on the Chicago Board
of Trade, the lowest price since June 5 and the steepest decline
since June 1. Prices have fallen 8 percent this year.  In spot market trading, ethanol in  New York  fell 1.5 cents,
or 0.7 percent, to $2.10 a gallon and in Chicago the additive
dropped 1.5 cents to $2.03, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Ethanol on the West Coast was unchanged at $2.175 a gallon
and in the U.S. Gulf the biofuel lost 1.5 cents to $2.09.  Corn for July delivery tumbled 22 cents, or 3.7 percent, to
$5.795 a bushel in  Chicago .  To contact the reporter on this story:
