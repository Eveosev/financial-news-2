Doux SA, the French maker of fresh
and frozen poultry products, is set to receive a 35 million euro
line of credit within days to pay its suppliers and avert a
breakdown in deliveries, according to  Les Echos .  A consortium of banks including Barclays Plc, Credit
Agricole SA and Credit Mutuel de Bretagne has agreed to provide
the line of credit to maintain Douxâ€™s operations, the newspaper
reported, citing an unidentified person in the government.  Doux, which recently entered  bankruptcy protection , has
been a cause of concern at the Agricultural Ministry, led by
Stephane Le Foll, according to the newspaper, and the credit is
expected to permit normal operations at its factories for
several months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
