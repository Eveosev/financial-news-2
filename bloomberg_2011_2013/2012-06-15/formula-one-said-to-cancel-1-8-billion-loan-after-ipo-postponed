Formula One, the auto-racing series
partly owned by  CVC Capital Partners  Ltd., canceled $1.8 billion
of loans sold last month after postponing an initial public
offering, according to two people with knowledge of the matter.  Formula One is notifying lenders that the debt transaction
wonâ€™t be completed as it was conditional upon the company
pricing the IPO by June 30, said the people, who asked not be
named because the deal is private. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and
Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc arranged the loans, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Formula One Chief Executive Officer  Bernie Ecclestone  said
last month that the planned stock sale may not take place until
later this year because of time pressures and a volatile equity
market. Shareholders led by CVC Capital Partners intended to
raise as much as $3 billion by selling stakes in the business in
 Singapore .  The loan refinancing includes a $1.25 billion portion
paying interest at 350 basis points more than the  London 
interbank offered rate, according to Bloomberg data. A basis
point is 0.01 percentage point.  A $2.27 billion credit facility Formula One raised in April
will remain in place as the refinancing loan is canceled, said
the people.  Ed Moore, a spokesman in London for CVC Capital Partners,
declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
