Eileen Rominger, the former  Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  executive who joined the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission last year, will step down next month as head
of the agency’s investment management unit.  Rominger, 57, is retiring from the SEC in July after nearly
18 months heading the unit in charge of developing tougher rules
for  money market funds , according to a statement released by the
agency today. SEC commissioners are divided on whether and how
to further regulate money funds and have been unable to reach
consensus on putting a proposal out for comment.  “Eileen understood the importance of a fair and efficient
investment management industry to the well-being of investors
everywhere,” SEC Chairman  Mary Schapiro  said in the agency’s
statement. “Her practical insights and steady leadership served
investors well.”  Rominger, who previously served as global chief investment
officer for Goldman Sachs Asset Management, joined the SEC in
February 2011 as one of the wealthiest people to ever work at
the agency. She reported $57.5 million in income from Goldman
Sachs in a disclosure form covering 2010 and 2011.  Before she leaves the agency, Rominger is scheduled to
deliver separate speeches this month in  Washington  to the Mutual
Fund Directors Forum and the Insured Retirement Institute.  To contact the reporter on this story:
