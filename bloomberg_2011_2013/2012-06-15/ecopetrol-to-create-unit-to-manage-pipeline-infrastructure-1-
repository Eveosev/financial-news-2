Ecopetrol SA (ECOPETL) ,  Colombia ’s largest oil
company, will create an infrastructure unit to meet rising
demand for pipeline capacity as oil production climbs.  The unit, called Cenit SAS, will oversee management and
expansion of the company’s pipeline holdings, Ecopetrol Chief
Executive Officer Javier Gutierrez said at a news conference
today in Bogota.  Ecopetrol is investing in pipeline infrastructure as
capacity lags oil production increases in Colombia,  South
America ’s third-largest crude producer.  Oil exports  rose to $28
billion last year, from $16.5 billion in 2010,  accounting for
49 percent of the Andean nation’s exports.  “This change will favor other companies more than it
favors Ecopetrol, since they will have greater access to these
pipelines,” said Juan David Pineros, an oil and gas analyst at
Colombian brokerage Interbolsa SA, in a telephone interview from
Medellin.  The new unit will be wholly owned by Ecopetrol, and will
let other energy companies use its transport system under
“clear and transparent” rules, according to the the statement.  The plan will help Ecopetrol meet its production targets,
Gutierrez said. The Bogota-based company aims to produce 1.3
million barrels a day in 2020.  The Colombian government owns 88.5 percent of Ecopetrol,
which has a higher market capitalization than the rest of the
Colcap Index combined.  To contact the reporter on this story:
