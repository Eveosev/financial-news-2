(Corrects currency in second paragraph.)  OSX Brasil SA (OSXB3) , the Brazilian
shipbuilder  controlled  by billionaire  Eike Batista , gained the
most in four months after securing loans for 2.7 billion reais
($1.3 billion) from two banks. The company’s bonds dropped.  OSX increased 5.4 percent to close at 13.10 reais in Sao
Paulo trading, the most since Feb. 13. Yields on OSX’s dollar
notes due in 2015, which the company sold in March, fell 6 basis
points to 8.77 percent, the lowest since May 31.  OSX said yesterday its board approved contracting two 1.35
billion-reais credit lines, one with Brazil’s development bank,
known as BNDES, and the other with the Caixa Economica Federal.
Both loans are on behalf of its subsidiary OSX Construcao Naval
SA.  Batista, Brazil’s wealthiest person, founded OSX to supply
vessels for his oil company  OGX Petroleo e Gas Participacoes SA (OGXP3) ,
as well as other oil companies. The company delivered its first
ship last year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
