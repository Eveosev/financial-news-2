Emerging-market stock funds ended
five consecutive weeks of outflows in the week ended June 13 on
speculation central banks may take steps to counter the global
economic slowdown, EPFR Global said.  Developing-nation  equity  funds registered inflows of $919
million, according to a report e-mailed today by the Cambridge,
Massachusetts-based data provider. Total net investment into
emerging-market funds has totaled $17.6 billion in 2012 compared
with outflows of $13.84 billion for the same period of 2011.  So-called Global Emerging-Market funds, or GEM funds,
recorded a net inflow for the week of $1.2 billion, the biggest
increase since the first week of March, the data show. Asian
funds excluding  Japan  recorded a net outflow of $302 million,
 Cameron Brandt , EPFR director of research, said by e-mail today.  Latin American equity funds posted inflows of $97 million,
their first since early May, while Russia-dedicated equity funds
registered net outflows of $33 million as the price of Brent
slipped below $98 a barrel, its lowest since January 2011.  The average emerging-market equity portfolio posted a 1.42
percent gain for the week, boosting the 2012 advance to 2.37
percent, Brandt said.  Emerging-market bond funds registered inflows of $361
million, Brandt said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
