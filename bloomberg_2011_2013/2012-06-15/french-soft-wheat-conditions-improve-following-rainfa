French soft wheat rated “good” or
“excellent” climbed for a ninth consecutive week in the seven
days ended June 11, crop office FranceAgriMer said. Corn and
durum wheat conditions deteriorated.  Soft wheat with top ratings rose to 73 percent from 72
percent a week earlier, the Montreuil-sous-Bois, France-based
office wrote on its  website  today. At the same time a year ago,
26 percent was rated “good” or “excellent” after a spring
drought stunted wheat growth.  Wheat plants have enough soil moisture to last until
harvest after two months of rain,  France ’s wheat-growers’
association said earlier this week. The precipitation helped
soft wheat recover from frost damage in February, it said.  France is the European Union’s largest wheat producer, and
was the world’s second-largest exporter of the grain in 2011,
International Trade Centre data show.  The ratings are the average for eight regions representing
54 percent of France’s soft-wheat area, the crop office wrote.  Durum  wheat rated “good” or “excellent” fell 1
percentage point to 57 percent, based on three regions that make
up 58 percent of French production, the data show.  Corn  with top
ratings also slipped 1 percentage point, to 69 percent.  Winter  barley  with “good” or “excellent” ratings
climbed to 66 percent from 65 percent. Spring barley rated in
the top two categories advanced 1 percentage point to 84
percent, with the grain judged “excellent” rising to 29
percent from 25 percent a week earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
