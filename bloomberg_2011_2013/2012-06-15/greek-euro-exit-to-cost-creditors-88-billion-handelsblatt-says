A Greek exit from the euro zone may
cost private creditors 70 billion euros ($88 billion),
 Handelsblatt  reported, citing an estimate by Ansgar Belke, a
professor for macroeconomics at the University of Duisburg-
Essen.  The move would lead to a default by  Greece â€™s government,
meaning European banks would have to write off the largest part
of their investment, the newspaper cited Belke as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
