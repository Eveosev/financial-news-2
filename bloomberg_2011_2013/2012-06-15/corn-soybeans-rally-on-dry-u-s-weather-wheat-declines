Corn and soybean futures rose on
speculation that warm, dry weather in parts of the Midwest next
week will stress crops in the U.S., the world’s biggest grower
and exporter. Wheat declined.  Most fields from  Missouri  to  Ohio  will get less than 0.5
inch (1.3 centimeters) of rain over the next five days, said
Kyle Tapley, an agricultural meteorologist for MDA Information
Systems Inc. in Gaithersburg,  Maryland . Temperatures will
average about 10 degrees Fahrenheit above normal during the next
seven days, making soils drier, he said.  “The crops need rain, and there doesn’t appear to be much
relief coming,” Ron Mortensen, the president of Advantage Ag
Strategies Ltd. in Fort Dodge,  Iowa , said in a telephone
interview. “The crops are holding up well for the moment, but
they are going to deteriorate quickly with the heat.”  Corn futures for December delivery, the contract with the
highest open interest, rose 0.2 percent to $5.1725 a bushel at
10:07 a.m. on the  Chicago  Board of Trade, paring the contract’s
decline for the week to 4.9 percent. The contract for July
delivery, before the harvest, fell 2.8 percent to $5.845,
heading for the first drop in three sessions.  Soybean futures for November delivery rose 0.5 percent to
$13.1575 a bushel on the CBOT. The contract for July delivery
rose less than 0.1 percent to $13.8675.  Dry to severe-drought conditions covered 60 percent of the
Midwest on June 12, compared with 1 percent a year earlier, U.S.
 Drought Monitor  data showed yesterday. About 66 percent of the
 corn  crop was in good or excellent condition as of June 10, down
from 72 percent a week earlier, the  U.S. Department of
Agriculture  said June 11. About 60 percent of the soybean crop
got the top ratings, compared with 65 percent a week earlier.  Wheat futures for December delivery fell 0.7 percent to
$6.62 a bushel in Chicago.  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $76.5 billion in
2011, followed by soybeans at $35.8 billion, government data
show. Wheat is the fourth-largest at $14.4 billion, behind hay.  To contact the reporter on this story:
