European Central Bank Executive
Board member Peter Praet said more European integration,
including governments giving up some sovereignty, will need to
take place to put the monetary union on a sounder footing.  “Further steps will need to be taken in order to
supplement the single monetary policy with a more integrated
framework for bank supervision, resolution and deposit
insurance, as well as far more extensive coordination of
government policies affecting competitiveness,” Praet said at a
conference in  Frankfurt  today. “If we are to achieve this,
euro-area countries will inevitably need to surrender more
national sovereignty and increase their coordination of national
policies.”  He reiterated comments by ECB President Mario Draghi today
that “monetary policy cannot provide a lasting solution to the
underlying problems causing persistent” heterogeneity in the
euro area.  European policy makers are debating the future design of a
more integrated single currency as a debt crisis that has seen
four countries appeal for bailouts highlights its shortcomings.
Yields on  Spain ’s 10-year debt rose to a euro-era record today
after Moody’s Investors Service cut the nation’s credit rating
to one step above junk, citing its rising debt burden and
weakening economy.  Praet also said that while the central bank will pay
“close attention” to asset prices, concerns that excess
liquidity will fuel inflation threats “are not warranted at the
current juncture.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
