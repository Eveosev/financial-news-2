ATP Oil & Gas Corp. (ATPG)  surged the most
in more than three years after the company sued the U.S.
government for more than $68 million in damages for suspending
offshore drilling following the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill.  The government “improperly and illegally” suspended all
offshore drilling and “unlawfully delayed” the issuance of
permits once the ban was lifted, ATP said in a lawsuit filed
yesterday in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims in  Washington .  “ATP has incurred significant financing costs to obtain
working capital to replace revenue ATP lost from delayed
production,” according to the Houston-based company’s
complaint.  Charles Miller , a Justice Department spokesman, declined to
comment on the lawsuit.  An April 20, 2010, explosion aboard the Deepwater Horizon
drilling rig, owned by  Transocean Ltd. (RIG) , killed 11 workers and
prompted the U.S. to halt deep-water drilling for seven months.  ATP rose 30 percent to $5.23 in Nasdaq Stock Market
trading, the biggest gain since Nov. 26, 2008. The shares have
declined 29 percent this year.  The case is ATP Oil & Gas Corp. v. U.S., 12-00379, U.S.
Court of Federal Claims (Washington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
