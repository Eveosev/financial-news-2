CVC Capital Partners Ltd.’s HK$2.5
billion ($322 million) loan to fund the purchase of assets from
 City Telecom HK Ltd. (1137)  attracted about 10 banks in the first phase
of syndication, according to three people familiar with the
matter.  The lenders joining the so-called early-bird phase of
syndication, which closed this week, include BNP Paribas SA,
Credit Agricole SA, Chinatrust Commercial Bank, General Electric
Capital Corp., ING Groep NV, Mizuho Corporate Bank Ltd.,
Natixis, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp., Taipei Fubon Commercial
Bank Co. and United Overseas Bank Ltd., the people said,
declining to be identified because the details are private. One
additional bank may join as a senior lender, they said.  The loan pays a margin of 450 basis points and a fee of
about 350 basis points to banks joining as sub-underwriters with
commitments of $55 million, the people said. Banks joining in
the early-bird phase of syndication get an additional 25 basis
points in fees, they said.  Edward Moore, an external spokesman for CVC at public
relations firm Brunswick Group LLP in  London  didn’t immediately
respond to an e-mail sent outside office hours seeking comment
on the financing.  The loan was underwritten and arranged by JPMorgan Chase &
Co. and Standard Chartered Plc, another person familiar with the
matter said on April 18. A decision on whether the loan will be
marketed more widely in general syndication has not been made,
said the people who spoke today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
