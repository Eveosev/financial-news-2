Swansea City appointed Michael Laudrup as its manager on a two-year contract as the Welsh club
prepares for its second season in soccer’s Premier League.  Laudrup, a former  Denmark  international whose last coaching
role was at Spain’s Real Mallorca, replaces  Brendan Rodgers  who
joined Liverpool on June 1. The appointment was announced on the
club’s website.  Swansea finished 11th in its first season in the top flight
since 1983 after starting the campaign as one of the favorites
to be relegated. The team won plaudits for its freeflowing style
of play.  The 47-year-old Laudrup resigned at Mallorca in September
2011 after 14 months in charge. He’s also coached at Brondby,
Getafe and Spartak Moscow, and was assistant manager of
Denmark’s national team from 2000 to 2002.  Laudrup’s playing career included spells at Juventus,
Barcelona and Real Madrid. He scored 37 goals in 104
internationals for Denmark over 16 years, often playing
alongside his younger brother Brian.  Laudrup is the second Danish manager of the club following
Jan Molby in the mid 1990’s.  To contact the reporter on this story:
