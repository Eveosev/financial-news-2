China ’s money-market rate was set
for its biggest weekly gain in two months on speculation demand
for cash will increase as the end of the quarter approaches.  The seven-day repurchase rate, a gauge of interbank funding
availability, rose for a fourth day even after the central bank
lowered the yields on 28- and 91-day repurchase contracts this
week. The  finance ministry  sold 15 billion  yuan  ($2.4 billion)
of 273-day bills at an average yield of 2.27 percent, according
to a trader at a  finance company  that participates in government
debt auctions. That compared with the  2.20 percent  rate on
similar-maturity debt in the secondary market.  “Banks may need more money to boost their loan-to-deposit
ratios to meet quarter-end requirements,” said Guo Caomin, a
bond analyst at Industrial Bank Co. in  Shanghai . “The high
auction yield on short-term debt shows cash supply is getting
tight.”  The seven-day  repurchase rate  increased 27 basis points
this week to 2.73 percent as of 11:25 a.m. in Shanghai, the
biggest increase since the five days through April 6, according
to a weighted average rate compiled by the National Interbank
Funding Center. The rate rose three basis points, or 0.03
percentage point, today.  The one-year swap contract, the fixed cost needed to
receive the floating seven-day repurchase rate, climbed 17 basis
points in the week to 2.56 percent, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. The rate dropped one basis point today.  The central bank sold 91-day  repurchase agreements 
yesterday at 3.05 percent, from 3.14 percent a week ago,
according to a statement on its website. It cut the rate on 28-
day repos by five basis points to 2.75 percent on June 12.  The yield on the 3.14 percent government bond due February
2017 rose 13 basis points this week to 2.90 percent, according
to the Interbank Funding Center. The rate dropped one basis
point today.  -- Judy Chen . Editors: Andrew Janes, Ven Ram  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
