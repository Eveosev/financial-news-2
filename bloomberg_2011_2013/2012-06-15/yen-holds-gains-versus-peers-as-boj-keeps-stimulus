The yen held gains against the
dollar and euro after the  Bank of Japan (8301)  refrained from adding to
stimulus measures after the conclusion of a policy meeting
today.  Japanâ€™s currency climbed 0.4 percent to 79 per dollar as of
12:05 p.m. in  Tokyo . It added 0.5 percent to 99.79 against the
euro.  The central bank kept its asset-purchase fund at 40
trillion yen ($505 billion) and a credit lending program at 30
trillion yen, matching the forecasts of 13 economists surveyed
by Bloomberg News. The decision was announced in Tokyo today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
