Burger King Worldwide Holdings Inc.,
the fast-food chain that will go public again after merging with
a company owned by  William Ackman , has formed a joint venture to
open 1,000 stores in China.  The agreement with the Kurdoglu family and private-equity
firm Cartesian Capital Group LLC to open the restaurants in the
next five to seven years is Burger King’s largest development
deal, the Miami-based company said in a statement today. The
joint venture will have the exclusive right to open stores in
China, where Burger King has 63 locations.  The Whopper seller will face  Yum! Brands Inc. (YUM) ’s 4,600 KFC
and Pizza Hut locations in China, as well as competition from
 McDonald’s Corp. (MCD)  In April, Burger King said its owner, 3G
Capital Inc., will get $1.4 billion to transfer the chain to
 Justice Holdings Ltd. (JUSH) , a special-purpose acquisition company
founded by Ackman.  The Kurdoglu family operates Burger King’s largest
international franchisee, TAB Gida Industry & Trade Co., which
has more than 450 stores in Turkey. Cartesian Capital is based
in New York.  Burger King has more than 12,500 restaurants worldwide, of
which about 90 percent are franchised.  To contact the reporter on this story:
