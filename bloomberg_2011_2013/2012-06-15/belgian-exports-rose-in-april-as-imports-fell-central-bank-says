Belgian exports rose 0.2 percent in
April from a year earlier to 19.8 billion euros, while imports
fell 0.4 percent to 19.9 billion euros, the  National Bank of
Belgium  said.  That left the country with a trade deficit of 45.7 million
euros, the central bank said today in an e-mailed statement,
citing preliminary figures. Belgiumâ€™s trade surplus in March was
revised to 149.1 million euros from 2.1 million euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
