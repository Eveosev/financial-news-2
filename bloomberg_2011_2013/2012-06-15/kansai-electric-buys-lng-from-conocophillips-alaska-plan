Kansai Electric Power Co. (9503)  purchased
a shipment of liquefied natural gas from a ConocoPhillips plant
in south-central  Alaska  that the U.S. producer had previously
planned to mothball.  Kansai received the shipment on a tanker at the company’s
terminal in western  Japan  on May 25, Kazushige Akita, a
spokesman, said in a phone interview today. He declined to
discuss the size of the cargo or whether Kansai planned
additional purchases.  The shipment arrived on a tanker that can carry as much as
126,750 cubic meters of gas, according to Bloomberg ship-
tracking data.  ConocoPhillips planned to preserve the plant in Nikiski on
the Kenai Peninsula for possible future use after buying
 Marathon Oil Corp. (MRO) ’s 30 percent stake in the facility, the
company said in October.  Tokyo Electric Corp. and Tokyo Gas Co. previously had a
joint deal to buy LNG from the plant. The contract, signed in
1969, expired in March 2011. Nobody answered a call to
 ConocoPhillips (COP) ’ press office in Houston out of office hours.  To contact the reporter on this story:
