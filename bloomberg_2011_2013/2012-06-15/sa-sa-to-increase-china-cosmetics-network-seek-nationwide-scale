Sa Sa International Holdings Ltd. (178) , a
cosmetics retailer in Hong Kong, plans to expand its network in
 China  by 51 percent as it seeks to gain nationwide scale in the
world’s fastest-growing major economy.  The number of stores will rise to 71, Guy Look, Sa Sa’s
chief financial officer, said at a press conference in Hong Kong
today. Sa Sa lost HK$38 million ($4.9 million) in China in the
year ended March 31, its third straight loss, according to
earnings published today. Growth in areas including Hong Kong
and  Malaysia  boosted total net income 35 percent to HK$689.7
million.  Sa Sa, which doubled sales in China last year, is seeking
to deepen relationships with suppliers and mall operators in the
11 provinces where it operates and is “well positioned” to
become a national chain, management said in a statement today.
China’s retail sales grew 13.8 percent in May, trailing
economists’ forecasts, and the government has set a 2012
economic growth target of 7.5 percent.  “Our consumer base has expanded, but the turnover is not
large enough,” Chairman Simon Kwok said at the press conference
today. “It’s more important to improve our network,” he said,
when asked about investment losses in the country.  To contact the reporter on this story:
