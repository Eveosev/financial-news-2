Investors’ expectations that a high-
impact event will affect the U.K. financial system dropped in
the first half of 2012, a  Bank of England  survey showed.  The poll showed 36 percent of respondents said the
probability such an occurrence was high or very high in the
short term, down from 55 percent in the final six months of
2011, the central bank said in its Systemic Risk Survey
published in  London  today. The results are taken from a poll of
73 market participants from April 16 to May 15.  During the survey period, “euro-area developments were
fast moving,” the report said. “Indeed, for some questions,
there was evidence of higher perceptions of risk in responses
that were received in the latter part of the survey period.”  The Bank of England and U.K. Treasury announced yesterday
new plans to boost bank liquidity and stoke lending to guard
against threats from the turmoil in the euro area. Governor
 Mervyn King  said the deterioration in economic conditions since
the bank published quarterly forecasts May 16 may warrant an
increase in monetary stimulus.  Respondents to the  bank’s survey  said the risk with the
biggest potential impact came from sovereigns, followed by an
economic downturn. This is a shift from 2008, where the top
risks came from a failure of a financial institution, property
price declines and market disruption. Confidence in the
stability of the U.K. financial system over the next three years
“remained low,” the report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
