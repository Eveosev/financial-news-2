Asian stocks rose, with the regional
benchmark index recording its biggest weekly gain in almost five
months, on optimism that central banks from China to the U.S.
will take new steps to fuel growth tempered concerns Europe’s
debt crisis will worsen.  Li & Fung Ltd. (494) , a supplier of toys and clothes to Wal-Mart
Stores Inc., jumped 5.9 percent this week in Hong Kong. Komatsu
Ltd., a Japanese construction machinery maker that gets 14
percent of its revenue from China, gained 2.3 percent in Tokyo.

percent on a plan to buy back as much as 10 percent of its stock.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index rose 2.4 percent to 114.16 this
week, the most in almost five months, before elections this
weekend that may determine Greece’s future in the euro. The
gauge has dropped more than 11 percent from its peak this year
on Feb. 29 amid concern growth is slowing in  China  and the U.S.
and as European policy makers failed to stem concern about the
debt crisis.  “There’s quite a high chance that the U.S. may do more
easing,” Terrace Chum, a Hong-Kong based  fund manager  at
Manulife Asset Management, which oversees $220 billion. “People
are expecting an interest-rate cut in China. There is
expectation that Greece may not part from the European Union.
But all these could turn around very quickly.”  Gains in stocks were limited on concern about Europe’s debt
crisis. Spanish bond yields surged the most in four months as
the government sought a bailout of 100 billion euros ($125
billion) for its banks. The nation’s credit rating was cut three
steps to Baa3 by Moody’s Investors Service, which cited Spain’s
increased debt burden, weakening economy and limited access to
 capital markets .  Stimulus Hopes  Companies linked to the U.S. advanced after data on June 14
showed more Americans applied for jobless benefits and consumer
prices dropped by the most in three years, giving the Federal
Reserve room to spur growth. A policy-setting meeting is
scheduled June 19-20.  Li & Fung rallied 5.9 percent to HK$15.20 this week.  Honda
Motor Co. (7267) , a Japanese carmaker that gets more than 40 percent of
its sales in  North America , gained 1.7 percent to 2,533 yen in
Tokyo.  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  increased 1.1 percent this
week, after data showed China’s consumer prices increased the
least in two years in May and industrial output and retail sales
trailed estimates, adding pressure for more stimulus after the
first interest-rate cut in three years.  Komatsu climbed 2.3 percent to 1,885 yen this week.  Sino-
Ocean Land Holdings Ltd. (3377) , a real estate developer in China,
surged 16 percent to HK$3.75.  DeNA, Gree  DeNA soared 23 percent to 1,993 yen this week after saying
it will spend as much as 20 billion yen ($254 million) buying
back up to 10 percent of its stock.  Gree Inc., DeNA’s closest domestic rival, also gained on
hopes it may follow DeNA in buying back shares, said  Mitsuo Shimizu , an analyst at Iwai Cosmo Securities Co. in Tokyo. Gree
jumped 25 percent to 1,710 yen this week. The two stocks were

companies this week.  Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  climbed 1.3 percent this
week, while South Korea’s Kospi Index rose 1.2 percent.
