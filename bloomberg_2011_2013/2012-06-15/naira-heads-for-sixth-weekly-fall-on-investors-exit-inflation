The naira weakened for a third day,
heading for its sixth weekly decline as foreign investors exited
the Nigerian market on concern inflation may rise.  The currency of  Africa ’s biggest oil producer depreciated
0.3 percent to 163.495 per dollar on the  interbank market  as of
4:09 p.m. in Lagos, the commercial capital. The naira has slid
0.7 percent against the U.S. currency this year, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Inflation in the West African nation accelerated to 12.9
percent in April after the government partly removed fuel
subsidies in January, boosting gasoline costs. It is still below
the 14.5 percent peak the central bank forecasts for the third
quarter. Governor Lamido Sanusi said May 22 total “hot money”
in  Nigeria  is under $5 billion.  “We take this figure to represent offshore holdings of
naira debt, and understand that most of the players who are not
dedicated Africa/frontier investors have now exited the
market,” Gregory Kronsten and Olubunmi Asaolu, analysts at FBN
Capital Ltd. in  London , wrote in a note to clients today.  Nigerian benchmark Bonny Light crude has plunged 23 percent
from a peak in March this year. Oil is the country’s biggest
export.  “All bets are off if the oil price continues to slide”
for the central bank to be able to maintain a stable naira, the
FBN Capital analysts wrote.  The central bank sold $400 million at a foreign-currency
auction on June 13, the most since Feb. 8. The regulator sells
the U.S. currency at auctions and direct to lenders at interbank
trading to stabilize the naira.  The yield on Nigeria’s domestic bonds due 2018 was
unchanged at 15.57 percent, according to the June 14 data on the
Financial Markets Dealers Association website. Yields on the
nation’s $500 million of Eurobonds due 2021 fell three basis
points to 5.5486 percent.  Ghana ’s cedi weakened 0.3 percent to 1.9275 per dollar in
Accra, the capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
