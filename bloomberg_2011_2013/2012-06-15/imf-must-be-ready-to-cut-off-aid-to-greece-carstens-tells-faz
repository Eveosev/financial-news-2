The  International Monetary Fund  must
stand ready to stop aid to Greece if the country’s next
government doesn’t stick to the terms of its rescue, according
to Agustin Carstens, Mexico’s central bank governor, the
 Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung  reported.  “If the terms of the IMF’s loan are openly rejected, if
there’s no readiness for discussion, no readiness to fulfill the
conditions, the IMF has to take a harder position,” the
newspaper cited Carstens as saying in an interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
