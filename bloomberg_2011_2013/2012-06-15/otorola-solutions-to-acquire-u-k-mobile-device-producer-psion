Motorola Solutions Inc. (MSI) , a U.S.
maker of walkie-talkies and radio-tracking chips, agreed to buy
 Psion Plc (PON)  for 123.9 million pounds ($193 million) to expand in
heavy-duty mobile computing devices.  Motorola Solutions is making an all-cash offer of 88 pence
a share, or 45 percent more than Psion’s closing price
yesterday, the Schaumburg, Illinois-based manufacturer said
today in a statement. The takeover will help earnings in the
first year after completion, Motorola Solutions said.  The U.S. company, which took over management this year of
Norway’s emergency-communications network, makes the ET1 tablet
for corporate customers. London-based Psion’s product line
includes the EP10 low-cost personal organizer and Omnii portable
devices for logistics management. The U.K. company said its
board unanimously recommends shareholders accept the offer.  Psion  jumped  as much as 48 percent to 89.75 pence, the
biggest intraday gain since 1998, and was trading 45 percent
higher at 87.75 pence as of 3:25 p.m. in  London . Motorola
Solutions gained as much as 1.5 percent to $48.08 and was up 1.2
percent in  New York  Stock Exchange composite trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
