OAO GMK Norilsk Nickel (NILSY)  rose to a
one-month high in U.S. trading after UBS AG added the stock to
its Key Call list for emerging markets today, reiterating a
recommendation investors buy shares of the company.  American depositary receipts of Norilsk, the world’s
largest producer of nickel and palladium, gained 2.4 percent to
$16.08 at 11:48 a.m.  New York  time, heading for the highest
close since May 16. The  Bloomberg Russia-US Equity Index (RUS14BN)  of the
most-traded Russian companies listed in the U.S. rose 1.5
percent to 87.27.  “Norilsk Nickel has underperformed base metals recently,
partly due to fund outflows from Russia, creating a good buying
opportunity,” Matthew Gilman and  Nick Nelson , strategists at
UBS in London, wrote in an e-mailed report today. “The
company’s cost advantage is likely to allow it to enjoy strong
profitability throughout any industrial cycle globally.”  OAO Gazprom (OGZPY) , the world’s largest gas exporter, and  OAO
Surgutneftegas (SGTPY) , Russia’s fourth-biggest oil producer, are also
on the Emerging Europe,  Middle East  and Africa Key Calls list,
UBS AG said in the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
