Chinese police arrested 235 suspects
in a probe into transnational telecom fraud aimed at citizens in
the Republic of  Korea , Xinhua reported today, citing a statement
released by the Ministry of Public Security.  The arrests were made in five provinces and the
perpetrators allegedly conducted more than 1,200 fraudulent acts
involving more than $15.7 million, Xinhua said. The  suspects
rang people in the Republic of Korea and fraudulently tried to
obtain their bank account details. Cash from victimsâ€™ accounts
was then sent to accounts in banks in the Republic of Korea for
cash withdrawal or further transfers, the agency said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
