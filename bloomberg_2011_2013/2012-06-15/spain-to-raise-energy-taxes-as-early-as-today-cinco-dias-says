Spain  may approve new energy taxes
today designed to raise 4.3 billion euros to help cover the
higher costs of generating low-carbon electricity and to avoid
raising power prices directly,  Cinco Dias  reported.  The three tax increases are part of a group of new rules
that may be approved by the cabinet of ministers or delayed to
its meeting a week from today, the newspaper said, citing
unidentified people in the power industry.  One measure would introduce a so-called green tax on fuel
of about 4 euro cents a liter to help spread the extra burden of
switching away from polluting fuels beyond power users to
drivers and the  transportation industry , the report said.  The other measures would raise the current 5 percent tax on
electricity generation as well as create a new tax on
“production” of power largely affecting wholesale suppliers of
power from coal- and gas-fired plants, Cinco Dias said.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
