Chicago gasoline fell the most in a
week since 2008 as Citgo Petroleum Corp. and  BP Plc (BP)  finished
maintenance on refineries that supply the hub.  BP started a crude unit at the Whiting plant in Indiana and
Citgo finished planned maintenance at the 170,500-barrel-a-day
Lemont, Illinois, facility this week.  Conventional, 87-octane gasoline in Chicago dropped 13
cents to a discount of 2 cents a gallon versus futures traded on
the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 4:29 p.m., according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt delivery fell 10.47 cents to
$2.6817 a gallon. The hub was at a premium of 37.5 cents a
gallon on June 11.  Chicago gasoline tumbled 39.5 cents this week, the most
since the period ending Sept. 19, 2008, following Hurricanes
Gustav and Ike.  Gasoline inventories in the Midcontinent, or PADD 2 region,
decreased for the seventh straight week in the period ended June
8, the Energy Department reported June 13.  The same fuel in the  Gulf Coast  narrowed its discount 1.87
cents to 8.38 cents a gallon, the strongest level since Feb. 21.  To contact the reporter on this story:
