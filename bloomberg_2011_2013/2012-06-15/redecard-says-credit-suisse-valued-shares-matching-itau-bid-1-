Redecard SA (RDCD3)  said  Credit Suisse Group
AG (CSGN)  valued its shares in line with  Itau Unibanco Holding SA (ITUB4) ’s
11.8 billion-real ($5.75 billion) bid for the company.  Credit Suisse calculated shares of Barueri, Brazil-based
Redecard to be worth from 34.66 reais to 38.12 reais, according
to a regulatory filing today. Sao Paulo-based Itau, Latin
America’s biggest bank by market value, offered 35 reais on Feb.
7 to buy out  Brazil ’s second-largest card-payment processor and
delist it from the Sao Paulo exchange.  Lazard Asset Management LLC, which owns 10 percent of
Redecard, requested a second appraisal in April, arguing that
the first, by NM Rothschild & Sons Ltd., undervalued the
company. Rothschild’s appraisal valued the stock at between
34.18 reais and 37.59 reais, according to an April 5 regulatory
filing by Redecard. The bank achieved the range using a free-
cash-flow calculation and another one based on the share price
of  Cielo SA (CIEL3) , Redecard’s larger competitor.  Itau, which is Redecard’s  largest  shareholder with a 50
percent stake, has said it won’t raise its bid even with a
higher appraisal by Credit Suisse, and may give up its buyout
plan entirely, according to an April 30 filing. Lazard is the
second-biggest investor.  Redecard fell 1 percent in Sao Paulo since Itau announced
the offering, compared with a gain of 22 percent for Cielo.
Brazil’s benchmark stock index dropped 14 percent in the same
period.  Redecard and its shareholders raised 4.07 billion reais
selling 150.8 million stocks at 27 reais each in an initial
public offering in July 2007. In March 2008, Citigroup Inc. sold
40.69 million Redecard’s stocks at 26 reais each in a public
offering of 1.06 billion reais. The New York-based bank sold
another 82 million Redecard’s shares at 24.50 reais each,
raising 2.01 billion reais, in March 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
