  Egis Gyogyszergyar Nyrt. (EGIS) , a
Hungarian drugmaker owned by Laboratoires Servier, ended a five-
day decline after announcing positive clinical trial results for
a rheumatoid arthritis treatment.  The shares  gained  as much as 1.8 percent to 14,250 forint
and were trading at 14,100 forint as of 10:03 a.m. in Budapest.  Clinical trials of a biosimilar medicine developed by South
Korean partner  Celltrion Inc. (068270)  yielded positive results for the
treatment of joint inflammation, Egis said late yesterday. The
medicine is to be marketed by Egis in former Soviet states and
12 other countries in central and eastern  Europe , according to
the statement.  “This product could be among the first two products Egis
will distribute from 2013 in the central and eastern European
region,” Gergely Palffy, a Budapest-based analyst at KBC
Securities, said in an e-mailed note to clients today. “The
other is the biosimilar version of Roche’s Herceptin, a
blockbuster with close to $5 billion in sales.” Palffy rates
Egis shares a buy with a fair value estimate of 17,453 forint.  Egis signed an agreement with Celltrion in February 2010 to
distribute eight biosimilar drugs developed and made by the
Korean company in 17 East European and former Soviet Union
countries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
