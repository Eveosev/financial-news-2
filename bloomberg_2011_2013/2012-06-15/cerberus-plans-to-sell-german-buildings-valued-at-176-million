Cerberus Capital Management LP, the
private-equity firm that invests in distressed real estate,
plans to sell German commercial properties valued at about 140
million euros ($176 million).  The 23 buildings are mainly offices, according to a
statement from Corpus Sireo Holding GmbH, the Cologne-based
asset manager hired to market the units. They are located in
cities such as Berlin, Frankfurt and Dusseldorf.  Cerberus buys underperforming assets with the aim of
investing in them and then selling at a profit. Last year, the
New York-based company hired Corpus Sireo to market 11
commercial properties in  Germany . In May, Cerberus bought 22,000
apartments in a 985 million-euro debt restructuring from the
liquidator of Speymill Deutsche Immobilien Co.  Cerberus didnâ€™t immediately return a call for comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
