Asian currencies rose for a second
week on speculation leaders of the Group of 20 nations will
announce measures to combat a global economic slump when they
meet next week for talks in  Mexico .  The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia  Dollar Index  climbed 0.3
percent after  Bank of England  Governor Mervyn King said June 14
that the case for more stimulus in the U.K. “is growing” as
Europe’s debt crisis worsens. U.S. data showed consumer prices
dropped in May by the most in three years, giving the  Federal
Reserve  room for more monetary stimulus before a policy meeting
next week. The Philippine peso led gains as the government
sought improved credit ratings and exports rose more than
economists forecast.  “Global policy makers are more proactive and the market is
hoping for some kind of bazooka from the Federal Reserve or the
G-20 summit next week,” said Roy Teo, a currency strategist in
 Singapore  at ABN Amro Private Bank. “That could stimulate
economic confidence and activities.”  The peso strengthened 2.4 percent this week to 42.255 per
dollar in Manila, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. South
Korea’s won climbed 0.8 percent to 1,165.75, Thailand’s baht
rose 0.7 percent to 31.47 and Malaysia’s ringgit advanced 0.7
percent to 3.1630.  The MSCI Asia-Pacific Index of stocks rose 2.4 percent this
week, the most since January. The Fed holds its open-market
committee meeting on June 19-20, while G-20 leaders gather for a
summit on June 18-19. Spain’s credit rating was cut three levels
by Moody’s Investors Service this week after the nation sought a
100 billion euros ($126 billion) bailout for its banks. Greece
will hold a June 17 election that may determine whether it stays
in the euro.  Fund Inflows  “If  Europe ’s crisis worsens, that will adversely impact
other nations and central banks in the developed nations will
take action to support their economies,” said  Yuji Kameoka ,
chief currency strategist at Daiwa Securities Co. in Tokyo.  The Asia Dollar Index, which tracks the region’s 10 most-
used currencies excluding the yen, has rebounded 0.8 percent
from 113.68 on June 1, the lowest level since September 2010.  Emerging-market stock funds had $920 million of inflows in
the past week, while bond funds attracted $361 million,
according to reports published by Citigroup Inc. and Morgan
Stanley that cited data from EPFR Global.  Peso Rally  The peso rallied after Finance Secretary Cesar Purisima
asked rating companies on June 13 to upgrade the nation’s junk-
grade status. Standard Chartered Plc said June 14 it expects the
 Philippines  to have an investment-grade rating by 2014.
Government reports this week showed exports rose 7.6 percent in
April from a year earlier, after shrinking 0.8 percent in March
while remittances climbed 5.3 percent in April.  “There’s a lot of hope on the upgrade,” said Andy Ji, a
strategist in Singapore at  Commonwealth Bank of Australia. (CBA)  “The
fiscal situation is good and the macro outlook is positive.
Remittances have always been strong.”  Central banks in the Philippines, South Korea, Thailand and
Indonesia kept their benchmark  interest rates  on hold this
month, while China on June 8 lowered its borrowing costs for the
first time in four years. Exports from Asia’s largest economy
increased 15.3 percent in May from a year earlier, exceeding all
29 estimates in a Bloomberg survey, data showed June 10.  Yuan Fixing  The  yuan  appreciated 0.08 percent from a week ago to 6.3651
per dollar. The central bank fixed its  reference rate  yesterday
at 6.3089, 0.97 percent stronger than the June 14 closing level.
The currency is allowed to fluctuate as much as 1 percent from
the fixing and the stronger reference rate may deflect criticism
of the nation’s exchange rate at the G-20 talks.  “The fixing is China’s pre-emptive move to ease any
pressure on appreciation at the G-20 meetings,” said Stella Lee, president of Success Futures & Foreign Exchange Ltd. in
 Hong Kong .  The U.S. contends that China is keeping the yuan
artificially weak to boost exports and calls for appreciation
are heating up as President  Barack Obama  prepares for a November
election. Germany will call attention to a number of issues
including China’s exchange rate at the G-20 talks, two German
government officials said in Berlin on June 12.  Elsewhere among Asian currencies, Taiwan’s dollar advanced
0.2 percent to NT$29.931 versus the greenback. India’s rupee
fell 0.1 percent to 55.4975, while Indonesia’s rupiah gained 0.9
percent to 9,385. Vietnam’s dong advanced 0.2 percent to 20,958.  To contact the reporters on this story:
