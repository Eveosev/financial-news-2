Tropical Storm Carlotta, bearing 70
mile-per-hour (110 kilometer-per-hour) winds, is on the brink of
becoming a hurricane as it nears  Mexico ’s southern Pacific
coast, the National Hurricane Center said.  Carlotta is 355 miles southeast of the popular resort of
Acapulco and moving northwest at 10 mph, the center said in an
 advisory  at 5 a.m. Pacific time. As much as 12 inches (30
centimeters) of rain and dangerous surf may accompany the storm,
the NHC said.  A  hurricane warning  is in effect for coastal communities
from Salina Cruz to Punta Maldonado as the center of Carlotta
will move near or over the coast late today or tomorrow, the
Miami-based NHC said. A  hurricane watch  extends east of Salina
Cruz to Barra de Tonala and west of Punta Maldonado to Acapulco.  “Satellite imagery shows that Carlotta is becoming better
organized and it is forecast to become a hurricane during the
next several hours,” the NHC said. A storm gets a name when top
winds reach 39 mph. It becomes a hurricane with 74 mph winds.  The storm is the third of the Eastern Pacific hurricane
season, which began May 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
