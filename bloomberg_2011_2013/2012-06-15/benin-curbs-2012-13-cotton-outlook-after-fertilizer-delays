Benin  curbed its forecast for cotton
production this season after Africa’s fifth-biggest producer of
the crop had difficultly in getting fertilizer, Minister of
Development Marcel de Souza said.  The West African nation expects output of 350,000 metric
tons to 410,000 tons, less than an earlier projection of 420,000
tons, he told reporters today in Porto Novo, the capital.  “The government is still looking for 49,000 tons of
fertilizer,” he said. Benin has already purchased 27,500 tons
at a cost of 8.5 billion  CFA francs  ($16 million), de Souza
said.  Cotton accounts for 30 percent of Benin’s gross domestic
product, de Souza said. “Government cannot allow this sector to
fail,” he said.  To cover the costs of cotton production, the country has
asked for a loan from the West  African Development Bank , Finance
Minister Jonas Gbian said. As well as the fertilizer costs, the
country has provided farmers with insecticide and herbicide, he
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
