The U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission pressed  Facebook Inc. (FB)  executives to explain in more
detail how a user shift to mobile devices could impact the
company’s profits, according to documents made public today.  “Assuming that the trend toward mobile continues and your
mobile monetization efforts are unsuccessful, ensure that your
disclosure fully addresses the potential consequences to your
revenue and financial results rather than just stating that they
’may be negatively affected,’” the agency wrote to Facebook on
Feb. 28.  Facebook shares have fallen about 24 percent since the
stock began trading at $38 on May 18 in part because of concern
about the company’s mobile strategy.  Facebook amended its IPO filing on May 9, about a week
before its $16 billion sale, to say that its revenue may be
negatively affected by users accessing the site on mobile
devices rather than personal computers. The company said its
ability to make money off mobile users was “unproven.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
