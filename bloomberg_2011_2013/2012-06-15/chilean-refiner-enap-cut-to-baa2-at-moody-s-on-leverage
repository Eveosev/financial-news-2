Empresa Nacional del Petroleo,
Chile’s unprofitable state-owned oil refiner, had its  credit
rating  cut one level at Moody’s Investors Service  Enap, as the Santiago-based company is known, was reduced
to Baa2, the second lowest investment-grade rating, from Baa1,
Moody’s said in an e-mailed statement, citing high debt levels
and two straight quarterly losses.  Higher oil prices and a narrower gap between light and
heavy crude prices have hurt the company’s finances in the past
six months, Moody’s said, adding the rating may be cut further.  “Without a significant capital infusion from the Chilean
government we believe the company will be challenged in
materially reducing debt levels to a level more consistent with
its underlying credit assessment,” Moody’s wrote.  Investors demanded an extra yield, or spread, of 251 basis
points, to buy Enap’s 10-year bonds instead of U.S. Treasury
note. Enap has $218 million of bonds coming due this year and a
$110 million next year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
