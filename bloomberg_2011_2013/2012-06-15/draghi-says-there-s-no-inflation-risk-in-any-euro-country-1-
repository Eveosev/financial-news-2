European Central Bank President
 Mario Draghi  said there are no inflation risks in the 17-nation
euro area and the ECB will continue to provide liquidity to
solvent banks.  “Inflation expectations remain well anchored and there is
no inflation risk in any euro-area country,” Draghi said in a
speech in Frankfurt today. “And should risks to price stability
emerge, the Eurosystem has sufficient tools at its disposal to
absorb excess liquidity.”  The ECB has lent banks more than 1 trillion euros ($1.26
trillion) for three years at its benchmark rate, which it held
at a record low of 1 percent last week. With the sovereign debt
crisis damping growth and price pressures, Draghi said on June 6
that “a few” ECB policy makers had called for a rate cut.  He said today that the ECB’s commitment to  price stability 
“will continue to guide our policy in the time to come.”  Draghi also said a blueprint for the future of Europe’s
monetary union that he is working on with European Union
President  Herman Van Rompuy , Luxembourg’s Jean-Claude Juncker
and European Commission President  Jose Barroso  will be published
“very soon.”  “Markets and people need to be reassured that we are still
travelling together,” Draghi said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
