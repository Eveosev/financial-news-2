Royal Bank of Canada , the country’s
largest lender by assets, will stop selling some insurance
products as regulations and the economy push “significant
change” in the industry.  “We regularly review our product portfolio, pricing,
operations and distribution, and adapt, as needed, to evolving
client and shareholder expectations, as well as increased
regulatory requirements and the economic environment,” Kerry
Gaetano, a spokeswoman for the Toronto-based bank, said today in
an e-mail. “These factors, collectively, are driving
significant change within the industry.”  Royal Bank’s  insurance unit  will stop selling seven
products that include life coverage and protection for
disability, critical illness and long-term care as of June 23,
Gaetano said. Those products represent “a small portion” of
the company’s sales, she said.  Sales of RBC Universal Life and Term 100 life insurance
through brokers will be suspended, she said. Royal Bank will
stop selling five “living benefits” products including Long
Term Care, Critical Illness Recovery Plan Level Premiums to age
100, and Quantum, a disability product.  Royal Bank’s insurance business had net income of C$151
million ($147.6 million) in the three months ended April 30,
about 9.8 percent of the lender’s quarterly profit, according to
 financial  statements. The unit had revenue of C$926 million in
the period, with almost half from Canadian insurance.  To contact the reporter on this story:
