Kenya’s  All-Share Index (NSEASI)  gained for a
fourth day, climbing 0.3 percent to 65.31 in Nairobi.  Mauritius’s  SEMDEX Index (SEMDEX)  fell for the first time in three
days, weakening 0.2 percent to 1,788.74 by the close in  Port
Louis . The Nigerian Stock Exchange All-Share Index slid 0.3
percent to 21,184.58 in Lagos, according to an e-mailed
statement from the bourse. The  FTSE/Namibia Overall Index (FTN098)  rose
0.1 percent to 892.12 in Windhoek.  Kenya Airways Ltd. (KNAL)  , sub-Saharan Africa’s third-
biggest airline by passengers, dropped 5.8 percent to 13.10
shillings, the lowest close in almost eight years, on a poor
earnings outlook, reflecting the challenging economic
environment for carriers.  “The outlook is not that good because of what is happening
in the euro zone,” Davis Mika, a Nairobi-based independent
analyst, said in a phone interview today. “That will put
pressure on the revenue.”  Mumias Sugar Co. (MSUG)  , Kenya’s biggest producer of the
sweetener, surged 6.6 percent to 6.50 shillings, the highest
close since Nov. 2, on improving cane yields following several
months of heavy rains.  UAC of Nigeria Plc  (UACN NL), a Nigerian company with
interests in food products, logistics and real estate services,
rose for a fifth day, the longest winning streak in almost three
months, advancing by 5 percent to 31.75 naira.  “There is room for an upside given the current price, as
it traded at an average price of 39 naira for most of 2011,”
Akinbamidele Akintola, a Lagos-based equity analyst with
 Renaissance Capital , said by phone today. There is a “decent
demand for UACN stocks, which is driven by the restructuring
going on in the company,” including the acquisition of a stake
in it by  Tiger Brands Ltd. (TBS)  of South Africa, Akintola said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
