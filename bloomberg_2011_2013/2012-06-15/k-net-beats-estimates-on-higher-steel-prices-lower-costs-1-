OAO Magnitogorsk Iron & Steel,
Russian billionaire Victor Rashnikov’s steelmaker, posted its
first profit in three quarters as prices for finished steel rose
and costs for raw materials fell.  Net income of $15 million in the first three months of 2012
compared with a loss of $67 million in the fourth quarter of
2011, MMK, as the metals company is known, said today in a
statement. The average estimate of 10 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg was for a loss of $10.4 million.  MMK is struggling to cope with a $4.2 billion debt burden
which resulted from the expansion of steel-making capacities in
 Russia  and the acquisition of a mill in Turkey. The company may
scrap plans to acquire Australian iron ore producer  Flinders
Mines Ltd (FMS)  as a result of a court challenge.  Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortization increased 44 percent to $293 million.  The net debt to Ebitda ratio climbed to 3.1, keeping MMK
“the second most leveraged name in the universe after  Mechel (MTLR) ,”
said Igor Lebedinets, an analyst at VTB Capital, referring to
Russia’s largest producer of coal for steelmakers.  The average price for MMK’s steel products rose 6 percent
to 7 percent since the beginning of the year, the company said
in a statement. “At present prices are experiencing a
correction, which is expected to continue into the middle of the
third quarter,” MMK said.  The company’s MMK Metalurji mill in  Turkey  remained
unprofitable in the quarter. Its Ebitda loss narrowed to $18
million from $67 million in the fourth quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
