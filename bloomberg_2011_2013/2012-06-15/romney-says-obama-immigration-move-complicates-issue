Republican presidential candidate
 Mitt Romney  said President  Barack Obama ’s decision to
immediately stop deporting some illegal immigrants brought to
the U.S. as children will make it more difficult to overhaul the immigration
system in the long run.  “We have to find a long-term solution, but the president’s
action makes reaching a long-term solution more difficult,”
Romney told reporters during a campaign swing in  New Hampshire .
“If I’m president we’ll do our very best to have that kind of
long-term solution that provides certainty and clarity for
people who come into this country through no fault of their own
by virtue of the action of their parents.”   Announcing his decision at the White House earlier today,
Obama said some illegal immigrants brought to the U.S. as
children will be made eligible for work permits.  The new policy affects about 800,000 undocumented
immigrants who were brought to the U.S. before age 16, have been
in the country for at least five years, have no criminal record
and are in school or have a high school diploma or equivalent.  Trent Lott, the former Republican Senate leader from
 Mississippi  who is supporting Romney, said Obama’s action is
politically calculated and signals that the president’s campaign
believes it needs to lean disproportionately on Latino voters.  “Some in the Hispanic community will appreciate it, but
that kind of thing should be done legislatively and it continues
to encourage illegal conduct,” Lott said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
