Russia completed its grain and
legumes sowing and planted 44.4 million hectares (110 million
acres), including 29.9 million hectares of spring crops, the
 Agriculture Ministry  said.  That compares with last yearâ€™s total of 43.5 million
hectares, and 29.5 million hectares for spring grains, the
ministry said in an e-mailed statement today.  Corn sowing rose by 307,000 hectares year-on-year and
reached 1.9 million hectares, the ministry said. Oilseed sowing
declined 1 million hectares to 9.4 million hectares, including
6.2 million hectares of sunflower seeds, 1.4 million hectares of
soybeans and 979,000 hectares of rapeseed.  Buckwheat sowing covered about 1.1 million hectares, or
161,000 hectares more than a year earlier, and sugar-beet
planting declined 128,100 hectares to 1.1 million hectares,
according to the statement.  Farmers started the grain harvest in the southern Krasnodar
region, reaping 1,000 hectares of winter barley, the ministry
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
