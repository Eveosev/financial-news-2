President  Barack Obama  expressed
irritation after he was twice interrupted by shouted questions
from a reporter while making a statement about his
administration’s change in policy on deportations.  Several minutes into Obama’s statement, a reporter who
later identified himself as Neil Munro from  The Daily Caller , a
website, shouted, “Why do you favor foreigners over American
workers?”  “Excuse me, sir,” Obama said. “It’s not time for
questions, sir.”  The second time Munro began asking the question before
Obama was finished, the president was visibly irritated.  “The next time I’d prefer you let me finish my statements
before you ask that question,” Obama said. When Munro
persisted, Obama said, “I didn’t ask for an argument. I’m
answering your question.”  Daily Caller editor Tucker Carlson said in a statement
posted on the website that Munro was doing the job he was
assigned.  “A reporter’s job is to ask questions and get answers,”
Carlson said. “Our job is to find out what the federal
government is up to.”  “We’re proud of Neil Munro,” he said.  Munro, in the statement, said he didn’t intend to interrupt
the president. “I timed the question believing the president
was closing his remarks,” Munro said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
