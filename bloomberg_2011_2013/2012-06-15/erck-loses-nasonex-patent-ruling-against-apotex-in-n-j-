Merck & Co. (MRK) ’s patent for the allergy
drug Nasonex isn’t infringed by Apotex Inc., a federal judge
ruled.  U.S. District Judge Peter Sheridan said today that Merck’s
Schering unit had “failed to present credible evidence” of
infringement, according to a court filing in Trenton, New
Jersey. Sheridan also denied Apotex’s claim that Schering’s
patent was invalid.  Schering sued Apotex in 2009, claiming that it had filed a
new-drug application with the  U.S. Food and Drug Administration 
for a generic nasal spray that would infringe Schering’s
patents. The patent at issue in this ruling expires in 2018,
Merck said in a statement today.  “We’ll very likely appeal and seek an injunction,”  Ron Rogers , a spokesman for  Whitehouse Station , New Jersey-based
Merck, said in a telephone interview. “As far as we know, the
FDA has not approved Apotex’s application. We do not expect
generic competition near-term.”  Elie Betito, a spokesman for Toronto-based Apotex, didn’t
immediately return messages seeking comment on the ruling.  Apotex claimed that its proposed product -- a nasal spray
to reduce symptoms of rhinitis -- has an active ingredient
that’s different from Schering’s, according to court papers.  The case is Schering Corp. v. Apotex, 09-06373, U.S.
District Court, District of  New Jersey  (Trenton).  To contact the reporter on this story:
