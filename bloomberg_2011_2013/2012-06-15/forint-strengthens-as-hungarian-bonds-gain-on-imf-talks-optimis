Hungary’s forint strengthened as
bonds gained and the cost of insuring the country’s debt fell
after the government said it is moving closer to securing
bailout talks with the  International Monetary Fund .  The Hungarian currency gained 0.4 percent to 294.65 per
euro by 4:23 p.m. in Budapest. Rising bonds cut the benchmark
June 2022 yield 11 basis points, or 0.11 percentage point, to
8.48 percent, poised for the lowest close this week.  The European Union’s most-indebted eastern member will
submit a new central bank law to parliament next week to meet
conditions set by IMF and the EU for financial-aid talks,  Mihaly
Varga , the country’s chief bailout negotiator, said today.
Investors should buy Hungary’s 2014 Eurobonds as the country
“progresses towards an IMF deal,” according to a BNP Paribas
SA report today.  Varga’s pledge is “at face value a market positive, albeit
given the history herein I think that investors will remain
somewhat skeptical in terms of adopting a seeing-is-believing
stance,” Timothy Ash, head of emerging-market research at Royal
Bank of Scotland Group Plc, wrote in an e-mail to clients today.  Hungarian five-year credit default swaps, which decline as
perceptions of creditworthiness improve, dropped five basis
points to 562. A close at that level would be the lowest in four
weeks and would mark a 22 basis-point weekly drop, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
