Canadian stocks  rose as oil’s rally
helped energy companies snap a two-day losing streak amid
speculation central banks will take steps to bolster growth.  Energy stocks in the Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index
advanced 1.4 percent, the most in more than a week, as  Encana
Corp. (ECA)  jumped 5.7 percent.  Research In Motion Ltd. (RIM)  advanced 5.3
percent, the biggest rally since March.  The S&P/TSX gained 58.48 points, or 0.5 percent, to
11,524.90, erasing a weekly loss and paring  losses  for the year
to 3.6 percent. The benchmark gauge tumbled 6.3 percent in May,
sinking to the lowest level since October during the month.
Energy shares in the index slipped 11 percent this year through
yesterday, while raw-material companies lost 9.1 percent.  “There’s been a substantial decline in energy prices,
crude and natural gas,” Jamie Robertson, chief investment
officer at McLean & Partners Wealth Management in Calgary, said
in a phone interview. The firm manages C$900 million ($879
million). “Some people’s ears are perking up to the low
prices.”  Policy makers from the U.K. to  Japan  and  Canada  stepped up
warnings about the threat to world financial markets should
Europe fail to contain its debt crisis, with speculation rising
that they are prepared to act if Greek elections this weekend
spark turmoil in the markets.  Oil Rises  Energy producers in the S&P/TSX rose as  oil prices  advanced
for a second day. The index  trades  for 15.6 times reported
earnings, near the 2 1/2-year low of 14.9 reached earlier this
month. Crude slumped to an eight-month low of $81.07 this week.  Suncor Energy Inc. (SU)  rose 1.7 percent to C$29.01.  Canadian
Natural Resources Ltd. (CNQ)  rose 1.3 percent to C$27.64. Natural gas
provider Encana rose 5.7 percent to C$22.60.  Research In Motion rallied 5.3 percent, the most since
March 30, to C$11.17. The BlackBerry maker is down 25 percent
this year, and fell yesterday after Nokia Oyj, another phone
manufacturer that’s lost market share to Apple Inc. and Google
Inc., reduced its earnings forecast and announced as many as
10,000 job cuts.  Royal Bank of Canada , the nation’s largest lender, rose 0.8
percent to C$51.24, trimming its year-to-date slump to 1.4
percent.  Manulife Financial Corp. (MFC)  rose 1.6 percent to C$10.74.  Raw-materials companies advanced as copper capped its first
weekly gain since April.  Teck Resources Ltd. (TCK/B) , the nation’s
biggest diversified mining company, advanced 1.2 percent to
C$32.94. Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc., the largest
fertilizer producer, rose 1.3 percent to C$39.29, following two
days of losses.  Finning International Inc. (FTT) , a seller of Caterpillar Inc.
equipment, rose 6.3 percent to C$24.18.  Gold stocks in the index defied the longest rally in gold
