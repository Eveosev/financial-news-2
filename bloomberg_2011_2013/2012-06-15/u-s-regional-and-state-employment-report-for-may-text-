18 states had no change, the  U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics 
reported today. Forty-nine states and the District of Columbia

while only one state experienced an increase. The national
jobless rate, at 8.2 percent, was essentially unchanged from
April, and 0.8 percentage point lower than May 2011.  In May 2012, nonfarm payroll employment increased in 27 states
and the District of Columbia, decreased in 22 states, and was
unchanged in  Maine . The largest over-the-month increase in
employment occurred in California (+33,900), followed by  Ohio

rate in May, 9.4 percent, while the Midwest again reported the

a statistically significant unemployment rate change. In
contrast, significant over-the-year rate changes occurred in
three regions: the Midwest and South (-1.2 percentage points
each) and West (-1.1 points). (See table 1.)  Among the nine geographic divisions, the Pacific continued to
report the highest jobless rate, 10.1 percent in May. The West
North Central again registered the lowest rate, 5.8 percent. No
division recorded a statistically significant over-the-month
unemployment rate change. Eight divisions had measurable rate
changes from a year earlier, all of which were decreases. The
largest of these over-the-year declines occurred in the East
South Central (-1.6 percentage points).  State Unemployment (Seasonally Adjusted)  Nevada continued to record the highest unemployment rate among
the states, 11.6 percent in May. Rhode Island and  California 
posted the next highest rates, 11.0 and 10.8 percent,

27 states reported jobless rates significantly lower than the
U.S. figure of 8.2 percent, 5 states and the District of
Columbia had measurably higher rates, and 18 states had rates
that were not appreciably different from that of the nation.  No state experienced a statistically significant unemployment
rate change over the month. However, 28 states reported
statistically significant rate changes from a year earlier, all
of which were decreases. The largest of these occurred in
Michigan and Nevada (-2.1 percentage points each) and Florida
and Mississippi (-2.0 points each).  Nonfarm Payroll Employment (Seasonally Adjusted)  In May, 14 states recorded statistically significant over-the-
month changes in employment, 9 of which were increases. The
largest statistically significant job gains occurred in
California (+33,900), Ohio (+19,600), and  New Jersey  (+17,600).  Over the year, 23 states and the District of Columbia
