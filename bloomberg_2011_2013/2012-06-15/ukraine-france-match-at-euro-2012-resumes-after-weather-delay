The match between Ukraine and France
at the European soccer championship has resumed after being
suspended because of lightning and heavy rain.  Referee Bjorn Kuipers pulled the players off the field
after just five minutes at Donbass Arena in Donetsk, Ukraine. It
restarted at 8 p.m. local time following a delay of about 55
minutes.  The match is the second for both teams in Group D. Ukraine
has three points and can clinch a spot in the quarterfinals with
a victory. France and  England  have one point each and  Sweden  has
none. England plays Sweden later tonight in Kiev.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
