(Corrects speed in kilometers in first paragraph.)  Hurricane Carlotta developed into a
Category 2 storm, with winds of 105 miles (169 kilometers) per
hour, as it moves northwest in the Pacific near the southern
coast of  Mexico , the U.S. National Hurricane Center said in an
advisory shortly before 5 p.m. East Coast time.  The system may grow stronger later today before weakening
as the center of the hurricane nears land. The stormâ€™s center
will probably move over or near the coast between Puerto Angel
and Acapulco overnight, the center said. It is now 280 miles
east-southeast of Acapulco.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
