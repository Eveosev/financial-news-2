My  column  today chronicles how Spanish banks for years violated accounting rules by using a technique called  dynamic provisioning , with the European Union's full encouragement. The piece quotes extensively from the  transcript  of an April 2009 meeting of the monitoring board that oversees the trustees for the London-based  International Accounting Standards Board . Here's a longer excerpt from that transcript, which offers a revealing look at the behind-the-scenes debate about the proper role of accounting standards in global finance. The discussion here is between  Charlie McCreevy , then the EU's commissioner for financial services, and  Robert Glauber , one of the accounting board's trustees. Glauber is a former chief executive officer of the National Association of Securities Dealers and teaches at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government. McCreevy, who at the time was the chief enforcer of EU laws affecting banking and markets, said he knew  Spain 's banks were violating International Financial Reporting Standards -- and that this was a good thing. Glauber was aghast. As we now know, violating the accounting rules didn't work so well for Spanish banks in the end, although it did help them mask their losses for a while. Spain is seeking $125 billion from its European neighbors to bail them out. (Jonathan Weil  is a Bloomberg View columnist.  Follow  him on Twitter.)
