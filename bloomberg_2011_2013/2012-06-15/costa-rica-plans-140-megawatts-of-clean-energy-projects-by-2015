Instituto Costarricense de
Electricidad,  Costa Rica ’s state-run utility, will develop 100
megawatts of wind farms and 40 megawatts of small hydroelectric
plants through 2015 as the Central American nation seeks to
become “carbon neutral.”  Grupo ICE, as the company is known, will auction contracts
to supply electricity from the facilities which are expected to
cost $350 million, Ulises Zuniga Blanco, an engineer at the  San
Jose , Costa Rica-based utility’s Investment Strategic Process
department, said today in an e-mail.  Costa Rica has committed to cutting its net contribution to
global warming to zero in 2021 by matching the amount of
 greenhouse gases  it emits with tree plantings, Blanco said.  “In the case of electricity, the aim is to stop burning
petroleum derivatives,” Blanco said. “The projects included in
this process will contribute to this objective of carbon
neutrality.”  Developers will have until July 27 to propose projects of
as much as 20 megawatts once the bid is announced in the
nation’s official gazette, he said. The winners will be selected
September.  The wind farms are expected to start producing electricity
in 2014 and the hydroelectric plants the following year, he
said.  Companies must offer to sell power at rates below $117.1 a
megawatt hour for the wind farms and $136.3 for the
hydroelectric plants, he said. The nation will hold another
auction for power contracts in 2013.  Costa Rica produced about 4 percent of its power from wind
farms in 2011 and 73 percent from hydroelectric plants, Grupo
ICE said in its power-generation expansion  plan  for the period
2012-24. No new fossil-fuel plants are planned after 2015,
according to the plan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
