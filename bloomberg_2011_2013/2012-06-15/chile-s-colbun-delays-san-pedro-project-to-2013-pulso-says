Colbun SA (COLBUN) , Chile’s third-largest
power producer, will postpone construction of its San Pedro
hydroelectric project until the end of 2013, Santiago-based
newspaper Pulso said.  The company ordered new engineering studies for the 150-
megawatt hydroelectric plant to fix errors, Pulso reported,
citing a high ranking company executive that it didn’t identify.  Colbun’s corporate communications office didn’t answer a
phone call or respond to an e-mail request for comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
