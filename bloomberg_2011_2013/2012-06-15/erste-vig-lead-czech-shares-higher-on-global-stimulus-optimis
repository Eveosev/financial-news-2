Vienna Insurance Group AG (VIG)  and  Erste
Group Bank AG (RBAG)  led a third day of gains for Czech shares as
speculation that central banks may step up measures to boost
economies drove investors to riskier assets.  VIG rose 1.9 percent, the most since June 5, to 739 koruna.
Erste added 0.7 percent to 359.4 koruna, paring weekly losses to
1.6 percent. The  PX (PX)  index, in which the two Austrian companies
have a combined 31 percent weighting, advanced 0.5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
