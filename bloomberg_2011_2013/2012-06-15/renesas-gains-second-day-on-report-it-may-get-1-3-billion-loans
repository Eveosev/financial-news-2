Renesas Electronics Corp. (6723)  surged for
a second day in Tokyo trading after the Nikkei newspaper said
the chipmaker may get 100 billion yen ($1.3 billion) in loans
from its major shareholders and lenders.  The world’s biggest maker of microcontrollers for cars rose
7.9 percent to 341 yen, the highest intraday level since May 11,
as of 10:14 a.m. on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, after climbing 15
percent yesterday.  Japan ’s benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock Average
was little changed.  Renesas also plans to cut as many as 14,000 jobs and close
or sell half of its 19 domestic plants as part of the company’s
revival, the report said.  NEC Corp. (6701) ,  Hitachi Ltd. (6501)  and  Mitsubishi
Electric Corp. (6503) , its three biggest shareholders, are in final
talks to provide 50 billion yen in loans to the chipmaker, the
Nikkei newspaper reported today, without saying where it got the
information. The Mainichi newspaper reported yesterday the
shareholders would provide loan guarantees for that amount.  Four lenders including  Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. (8306) 
and  Mizuho Financial Group Inc. (8411)  will use a commitment line to
provide another 50 billion yen in loans to Renesas, the Nikkei
report said.  The shareholders and banks may reach agreement on the aid
as early as next week, the newspaper said.  Formed in Mergers  Renesas spokesman Yoichi Kobayashi, Hitachi spokesman
Hirotaka Ohno and NEC spokesman Takehiko Kato declined to
comment on the Nikkei report. Mitsubishi Electric also declined
to comment through a spokesman, who declined to be named, citing
company policy.  Renesas was formed in 2010 after the merger of money-losing
chipmakers Renesas Technology Corp., a venture between Hitachi
and Mitsubishi Electric, and NEC Electronics Corp. The new
company has lost money every year since.  The chipmaker’s semiconductors are used in products from
automobiles to consumer electronics for tasks including
triggering air bags in cars and controlling  DVD players . The
company’s  customers  include Apple Inc. and Sony Corp., according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
