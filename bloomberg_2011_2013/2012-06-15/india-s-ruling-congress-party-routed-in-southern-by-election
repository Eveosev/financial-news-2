India ’s ruling  Congress party  was
routed in a provincial by-election in the southern state of
Andhra Pradesh by a breakaway faction.  The YSR Congress, led by  Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy , won 15 of
the 18 seats for which elections were held this week, according
NDTV 24X7 news channel. Jagan Reddy, 39, the son of the former
chief minister the state who died in a helicopter crash in 2009,
is in prison on charges of corruption.  The defeat of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh’s party follows
its rout in state elections earlier this year. It lost the polls
in the nation’s most populous state  Uttar Pradesh , where the
party’s leader-in-waiting Rahul Gandhi led the campaign.  The Congress party, which got 16 of 18 seats in the 2009
elections in  Andhra Pradesh , won two seats in this by-election,
NDTV said. The YSR Congress Party also won a parliamentary seat
in the poll, it said.  Jagan Reddy, one of the country’s richest politicians,
started the YSR Congress after the Congress party rejected his
bid for the chief minister’s post. The election for these seats
became necessary after Congress legislators were disqualified
for joining Jagan Reddy’s party and voting against the governing
party during a confidence vote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
