ISS Shipping India Pvt, a port
agent, comments on delays loading and unloading cargoes at the
nation’s terminals.  ISS commented by e-mail today:  “With more and more private ports opening up, the delays
have considerably reduced. The turn-around time in a government-
run port is the same though i.e. it can go up to seven to 10
days depending upon the commodity that is being discharged.
Further, during monsoons most ports prohibit operations at their
outer anchorage resulting in a delay, thereby increasing the
turnaround time.”  “Delays at Kandla are any where between seven to 10 days
and not 20 days.”  “The private-run ports do not face any delays in port
development projects the only delay that occurs is the clearance
from various ministries like shipping, finance, environment,
defense, fisheries etc.”  “Once they have received the clearances, then it depends
upon the private company’s financial ability to complete the
same on time. The infrastructure in government-run ports are
poor, however the privately-run ports, being cash rich, have
good infrastructure to run the operations.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
