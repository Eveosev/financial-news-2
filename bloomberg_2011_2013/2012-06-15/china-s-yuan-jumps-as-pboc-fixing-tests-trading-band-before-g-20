The yuan jumped the most in eight
weeks as the central bank strengthened its  reference rate  to the
limit, helping fend off criticism of  China ’s currency policy in
the run-up to next week’s Group of 20 meeting.  The People’s Bank of China raised the daily  fixing  by 0.16
percent, the most since May 2, to 6.3089 per dollar today. That
was 0.97 percent stronger than yesterday’s closing level in
 Shanghai  and the currency is allowed to trade no more than 1
percent on either side of the fixing. Global leaders, including
Chinese President  Hu Jintao , will meet in Mexico June 18-19 for
the G-20 meeting. China widened the yuan’s daily trading band to
1 percent from 0.5 percent on April 16.  “The fixing is China’s pre-emptive move to ease any
pressure on appreciation at the G-20 meetings,” said Stella Lee,
president of Success Futures & Foreign Exchange Ltd. in Hong
Kong. “The wider  yuan  trading band has given more room for
China to do so before major summits with trading partners.
Investors are also betting global central banks will work
together to bolster growth.’  The yuan rose 0.08 percent today, the most since April 17,
to close at 6.3651 per dollar in Shanghai, according to the
China Foreign Exchange Trade System. It also gained 0.08 percent
since June 8, the first weekly advance since May 6. One-month
volatility, a measure of exchange-rate swings used to price
options, was unchanged at 2.2 percent.  The U.S. contends that China is keeping the yuan
artificially weak to boost exports and calls for appreciation
are heating up as President  Barack Obama  prepares for a November
election.  Germany  will call attention to a number of issues
including China’s exchange rate at the G-20 talks, two German
government officials said in Berlin on June 12.  Won, Ringgit  Currencies advanced across most of Asia’s emerging-market
economies today amid speculation policy makers worldwide will
unveil fresh stimulus measures as Europe’s debt crisis weighs on
global economic growth.  In Hong Kong’s offshore market, the yuan climbed 0.05
percent to 6.3670 per dollar, extending this week’s gain to 0.08
percent. Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards advanced 0.18
percent to 6.4075, a 0.7 percent discount to the onshore spot
rate. The contracts strengthened 0.27 percent this week, the
best performance since the five days ended Jan. 27.  To contact the reporter on this story:
