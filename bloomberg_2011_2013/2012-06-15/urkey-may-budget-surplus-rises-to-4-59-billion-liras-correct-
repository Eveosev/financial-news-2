Turkey  had a budget surplus of 4.59
billion liras ($2.5 billion) in May, an increase of 62 percent
from a year ago, after payments on interest slid an annual 41
percent on lower debt repayments.  The surplus rose from 2.84 billion liras in May 2011, the
 Finance Ministry  said on its  website  today.  Spending, excluding interest payments, climbed 18 percent
annually to 23.8 billion liras, outpacing a 14 percent increase
in revenue to 30.8 billion liras. Tax income rose 14 percent to
26.5 billion liras, the ministry said.  Turkey has targeted a budget deficit of 1.5 percent of
gross domestic product this year after posting a gap of 1.4
percent in 2011. The economy needs to grow at 4 percent this
year in order for the government to meet its budget goals,
Finance Minister  Mehmet Simsek  said on May 24 in an interview
with NTV television.  “After large debt redemptions in January to April the
Treasury is enjoying a light schedule and the impact of this on
the budget is likely to be the same in June as well,”  Inan
Demir , chief economist at Finansbank AS in Istanbul, said in a
telephone interview today.  The Treasury repaid 1.7 billion liras in domestic debt in
May compared with 17.2 billion liras in April. It’s due to repay
1.6 billion liras in June and 3.2 billion liras in July,
according to a borrowing plan published on the Treasury’s
website.  The so-called primary surplus, which excludes interest
costs, was 7 billion liras in May compared with 6.9 billion
liras in May 2011.  Yields on two-year lira bonds fell five basis points to
9.11 percent today. They’ve declined 190 basis points this year,
the most in major  emerging markets  after  Brazil .  The budget posted a deficit of 432 million liras in the
first five months, an increase of 85 percent from a year ago.
Turkey’s deficit goal for this year is 21.1 billion liras, the
statement said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
