Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne  is planning to extend tax breaks given to film makers in
the U.K. to other creative industries, the Treasury said.  Animation companies and makers of television programs and
computer games will be given reliefs similar to the 5 billion
pounds ($7.8 billion) that movie makers already get. The
Treasury will begin consulting the industries on June 18.  The tax breaks, which will be determined after the
consultation, are intended to make the U.K. one of the most
generous places for creative industries and attract program
makers such as Home Box Office Inc., the Treasury said. Osborne
said he wanted to help the industries in his March 21 budget.  A “high-end television tax relief” aims to support
productions with budgets above 1 million pounds an hour so that
shows such as Titanic, with a largely U.K. cast and writers, are
produced locally rather than in countries such as Canada and
 Hungary .  Osborne will also seek to encourage video-games producers
to build more blockbusters such as  Square Enix Holdings Ltd. (9684) ’s
Tomb Raider. Animators will also be given a tax break to
encourage franchises such as Aardman Animation’s Wallace &
Gromit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
