Ambienta SGR SpA, an Italian
private-equity company that focuses on environment-related
companies, agreed to invest 10 million euros ($12.6 million) in
the U.K. offshore wind engineer  FoundOcean Ltd. , in anticipation
of 50 percent revenue growth as  Europe  promotes the use of
turbines at sea.  Ambienta will buy 35 percent of FoundOcean’s equity, the
Milan-based company said today in an e-mailed statement.  Private-equity companies are showing interest in businesses
that service offshore wind farms, as Europe installs turbines at
sea to curb emissions. Riverstone Holdings LLC bought Seajacks
International Ltd., a jack-up vessel operator, before selling it
to  Marubeni Corp. (8002)  in March.  FoundOcean, based in Buckinghamshire,  England , provides
subsea and offshore foundation grouting to the offshore wind and
oil and natural-gas industries. The company’s sales doubled to
12 million pounds ($19 million) last year from 2009, driven by
new offshore wind contracts.  FoundOcean’s customers include the German utility  RWE AG (RWE) 
and it expects revenue to increase by 50 percent this year,
according to the statement.  “FoundOcean is well positioned to continue its growth,
capturing market share in offshore wind and expanding
internationally into key markets,” Ambienta Chief Executive
Officer Nino Tronchetti Provera said in the statement, citing
Germany and areas in Africa and Asia.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
