Montenegro will probably be declared
ready to start European Union entry talks later this month,
giving another nudge to the bloc’s expansion in the Balkans, a
draft document showed.  A June 28-29 summit of EU leaders will “endorse” a
decision expected on June 26 “to open accession negotiations
with Montenegro,” according to a draft statement obtained by
Bloomberg News.  No timeline will be set for the entry process, which would
make Montenegro the third ex-Yugoslav republic in the EU.
Slovenia became a member in 2004 and  Croatia  is scheduled to
join in mid-2013.  With a population of 625,000, Montenegro sells 56 percent
of its exports to the 27-member bloc and unilaterally uses the
euro as its currency.  To contact the reporters on this story:
