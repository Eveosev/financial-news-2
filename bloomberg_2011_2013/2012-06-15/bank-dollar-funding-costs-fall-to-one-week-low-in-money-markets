The cost for European banks to
borrow in dollars fell for a third day to the lowest level in
more than a week, according to a money-markets indicator.  The three-month cross-currency  basis swap , the rate banks
pay to convert euro interest payments into dollars, was 50 basis
points below the euro interbank offered rate at 10:25 a.m. in
London, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Thatâ€™s the lowest cost since June 6 and compares with minus
54 basis points yesterday. The cost has declined from 59 basis
points below Euribor on June 4, which was the most expensive in
three months.  The one-year basis swap was 55 basis points below Euribor,
from minus 57 basis points yesterday and minus 67 on June 4. A
basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  Prices in the forward market for three-month Euribor
relative to overnight indexed swaps -- known as the FRA/OIS
spread -- dropped to 34 basis points from 36.  The Euribor/OIS spread was little changed at 40 basis
points. The measure has ranged from 37 basis points to 42 basis
points since the end of March. The  three-month Euribor  benchmark
dropped to 0.662 percent, from 0.663 percent yesterday.  Lenders cut  overnight deposits  at the Frankfurt-based
European Central Bank yesterday, placing 699.6 billion euros
($884 billion) from 704 billion euros the day before.  To contact the reporter on this story:
