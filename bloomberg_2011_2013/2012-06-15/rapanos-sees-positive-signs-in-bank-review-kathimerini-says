A review of loan portfolios for
Greek banks by BlackRock Solutions and the  Bank of Greece (TELL)  showed
lending tactics differed from those in the U.S. which led to a
real estate bubble,  Kathimerini reported , citing the head of the
Hellenic Bank Association, Vassilios Rapanos.  “Two BlackRock officials, making statements to the foreign
press recently, underlined their positive surprise for their
findings regarding the quality of loan portfolios of Greek
banks,” Kathimerini cited Rapanos as saying.  Rapanos said Greek banks are “victims” of the financial
crisis and that “constant attacks” against banks and their
shareholders should stop, according to the Athens-based
newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
