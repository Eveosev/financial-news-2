Private incomes in the U.K. fell by
almost 8 percent in real terms in the three years through March
2011 as earnings failed to keep pace with inflation and
unemployment climbed, the  Institute for Fiscal Studies  said.  The drop left private incomes 5 percent below their level
in 2003-04, the first year of comparable data, the London-based
research group said in a report published today, citing
government data.  The figures, based on incomes before taxes and benefits,
underline the damage inflicted by the global financial crisis
and the ensuing  recession , which saw Britain lose 7 percent of
its economic output in the deepest slump since World War II.  “Unless the economy performs much better than expected in
the next few years, it looks likely that households’ private
incomes will still be below their peak for some years,” said
Jonathan Cribb, a research economist at the IFS.  Private incomes fell 1.1 percent in real terms in 2008-09
and by 2.8 percent in the following 12 months, reflecting higher
 unemployment , the IFS said. A 4.1 percent decline in 2010-11 was
largely explained by a pickup in the rate of  inflation , it said.  Unemployment benefit payments triggered by the recession
provided some relief to households during the period, the IFS
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
