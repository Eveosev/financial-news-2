Japan ’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  may
surge 23 percent by the end of the year as profits grow and
investors seize upon the lowest valuations of any major Asian
benchmark, said Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities Co.’s
Chief Equity Strategist Chisato Haganuma.  The shares are cheap, especially when cashflow and
dividends are taken into consideration, said Haganuma in an
interview in  Kuala Lumpur  June 13. Earnings per share for the
Nikkei will expand 66 percent in the next 12 months, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. The gauge has a price-to-book
ratio of 1.08, compared with a multiple of 1.2 for the regional
MSCI Asia Pacific Index, the data show.  “Japanese stocks are now bottoming out,” Haganuma said.
“I’m quite bullish. You may find better investment
opportunities in the Tokyo market rather than emerging  Asia .
Asian economies enjoy very robust economic growth, I totally
agree, but on the other hand, if you look at cashflow of the
individual company, some cases, not so good.”  The Nikkei has fallen 16 percent from this year’s high on
March 27 as  Europe ’s debt crisis intensified, driving up the yen
and threatening exports at a time when growth in the U.S. and
 China  shows signs of slowing. The broader Topix Index dropped on
June 4 to its lowest level since 1983.  Japanese companies are struggling with the legacy of last
year’s natural and nuclear disasters, with the Nikkei 225
trading 18 percent below the level it was prior to the country’s
biggest earthquake on record.  Haganuma forecast the Nikkei will climb to 10,500 by the
end of 2012. The gauge closed at 8,568.89 yesterday. The Nikkei
225 will end the year at 10,700, according to the median
estimate of 17 stategists surveyed by Bloomberg.  Singapore ’s Straits Times Index trades at 1.26 times the
value of net assets while companies in Hong Kong’s Hang Seng
Index are valued at 1.31. Gauges in  Shanghai , Mumbai and Sydney
all trade higher. A reading below 1 means a firm can be bought
for less than the value of its assets.  Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities is a joint venture
between Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. and Morgan Stanley.  To contact the reporters on this story:
