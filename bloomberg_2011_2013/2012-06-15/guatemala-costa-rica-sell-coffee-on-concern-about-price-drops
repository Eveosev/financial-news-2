Coffee growers in  Costa Rica  and
Guatemala, Central America’s second-biggest producer, are
stepping up sales on concerns prices will fall further,
according to Volcafe, a unit of trader ED&F Man Holdings Ltd.  Arabica coffee on ICE Futures U.S. in  New York  has fallen
33 percent so far this year as traders sold the futures on
anticipation of a record harvest in  Brazil , the world’s biggest
grower. The commodity is the worst performer on the Standard &
Poor’s GSCI index of 24 raw materials.  “Some producers and intermediaries are offering their
remaining coffee, fearing the bear move will continue,” Volcafe
said in a report e-mailed today, commenting on Guatemala.  Growers in Costa Rica “are interested in selling the last
current crop coffees amidst a falling ICE market,” the
Winterthur, Switzerland-based trader said in the report.  Tropical Storm Carlotta, which developed into a Category 1
hurricane today on a path to the southern coast of  Mexico , could
affect the southern regions of Guatemala next week, Volcafe
said. Carlotta, with winds of 80 miles (129 kilometers) per
hour, was 330 miles southeast of  Acapulco , Mexico, shortly
before 11 a.m. Eastern time, the U.S. National Hurricane Center
said. The system is moving northwest at 12 miles per hour.  While business was “rather slow” in Guatemala, demand was
“noted from several directions” in Costa Rica, according to
the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
