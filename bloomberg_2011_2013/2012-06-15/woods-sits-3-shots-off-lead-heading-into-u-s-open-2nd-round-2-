Tiger Woods trails  Jim Furyk  by
three shots at the U.S. Open, where four European players are
making a run at the top of the leaderboard.  Woods, who began today tied for the lead with fellow
Americans Furyk and David Toms, had four bogeys on his first
eight holes today and is 3 over midway through the third round
at San Francisco’s Olympic Club.  Furyk, the 2003 U.S. Open champion who is playing in the
final pairing with Woods, had two bogeys and a birdie through
eight holes today and is the only player on the course not above
par.  Nicholas Colsaerts of Belgium is a shot behind Furyk at 1
over. The 2010  U.S. Open  winner,  Graeme McDowell  of Northern
Ireland, was at 2 over, along with England’s Lee Westwood and
Fredrik Jacobson of Sweden.  Woods, who is seeking to end a four-year drought in golf’s
major championships, is tied with seven other players at 3 over
-- including Jason Dufner, first-round leader Michael Thompson
and Beau Hossler, a 17-year-old high school junior from Southern
California who briefly held the tournament lead yesterday.  The weather today is warmer and sunnier than in the
previous two days, making the course quicker and less forgiving
as it dries out.  Five-time U.S. Open runner-up  Phil Mickelson , who made the
cut by one shot, shot his second straight 1-over 71 today on his
42nd birthday and is 8 over for the tournament.  “It’s a long, difficult day, even though it’s my
birthday,” Mickelson told reporters.  To contact the reporters on this story:
