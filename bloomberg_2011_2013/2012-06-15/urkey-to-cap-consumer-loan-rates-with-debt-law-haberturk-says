The Turkish government will impose a
ceiling on interest rates for consumer and credit card loans
through a new debt law which is planned to take effect on July
1, Haberturk newspaper reported.  Annual interest on consumer and credit card loans may be as
much as 13.5 percent, or 50 percent more than the official
interest rate set at 9 percent by the Cabinet in 2006, the
Istanbul-based newspaper said, citing the related article of the
debt law.  The law also sets an upper limit of 18 percent, or double
the official interest rate, for annual interest on overdue
payments charged by financial and commercial institutions,
according to the newspaper.  Click here for web link   To contact the reporter on this story:
