Japan ’s  Topix Index (TPX)  rose, with the
benchmark rising for a second week, after U.S. unemployment
fueled speculation central banks will take new steps to fuel
growth. Trading volume was below average ahead of elections this
weekend that may determine Greece’s future in the euro.  Renesas Electronics Corp. (6723) , a chipmaker that has lost more
than a quarter of its value this year, climbed 1.3 percent after
a report it will shut or sell half its plants and cut as much as
30 percent of its workers.  DeNA Co. (2432)  surged 12 percent after the
social-gaming company said it plans to buy back as much as 10
percent of its shares.  Honda Motor Co. (7267) , which depends on  North
America  for 44 percent of its sales, slid 0.4 percent as the yen
strengthened.  The Topix advanced 0.1 percent to 726.57 at the close of
trading today, extending its weekly advance to 1.2 percent. The
measure pared gains today after the Bank of Japan refrained from
expanding its asset purchases, sending the yen higher. Volume
was 27 percent below the 100-day average. The  Nikkei 225 Stock
Average (NKY)  added less than 0.1 percent to 8,569.32.  Markets “believe that low inflation plus increasingly soft
labor-market numbers equals another round of quantitative
easing,” said Matthew Sherwood, Sydney-based head of research
at Perpetual Investments, which manages about $23 billion.
“Investors are on guard for the Greek election on June 17.  The Topix has fallen 17 percent from this year’s high on
March 27 as  China ’s economic growth slowed and on concern
Europe’s debt crisis is spreading. Shares on the index are
valued at 0.86 times book value, near levels seen in 2008 after
the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. A number below one
means investors can buy a company for less than the value of its
assets.  Volatility Rises  The  Nikkei 225 Volatility Index (VNKY)  rose 4.5 percent to 28.98
today, the highest level in almost two weeks. The number
indicates traders expect a swing of about 8.3 percent on the
gauge over the next 30 days.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index added 0.1
percent today. The gauge added 1.1 percent yesterday after data
showed more Americans applied for jobless benefits and consumer
prices dropped by the most in three years. Weaker economic data
give the  Federal Reserve  room to spur an economy that’s
generating little growth or inflation. A policy-setting meeting
is scheduled June 19-20.  The Bank of Japan kept its asset-purchase fund at 40
trillion yen and a credit lending program at 30 trillion yen,
matching the forecasts of 13 economists surveyed by Bloomberg
News. The decision was announced in  Tokyo  today.  Yen Strength  ‘‘Nobody expected the  Bank of Japan  to make a move, but the
yen is going to strenghten as more investors expect easing from
the Federal Reserve,” said Yasuhiko Hirakawa, a portfolio
manager at Tokyo-based DIAM, which manages the equivalent of $55
billion.  Bloomberg News reported that U.K. Chancellor of the
Exchequer  George Osborne  and  Bank of England  Governor Mervyn
King are preparing two programs to increase the flow of credit.
Reuters said central banks of major economies are prepared to
take action if needed to boost liquidity in financial markets if
the June 17 Greek elections cause tumultuous trading, citing
officials linked to the Group of 20 nations.  Renesas advanced 1.3 percent to 320 yen. The stock gained
for a second day after the Nikkei newspaper said the maker of
micro-controllers said will cut as many as 14,000 jobs and close
or sell half of its 19 domestic plants. The chipmaker may get
100 billion yen in loans from shareholders and lenders, the
Nikkei said, without saying where it got the information.  DeNA Surges  DeNA gained as much as 21 percent, the most on an intraday
basis since the company was listed in 2005, after saying it will
spend as much as 20 billion yen to buy back up to 10 percent of
its outstanding shares. The shares traded at 1,996 yen, up 13
percent.  Exporters fell as the yen appreciated against the dollar in
Tokyo. A stronger yen reduces the value of overseas income at
Japanese companies when repatriated.  Honda dropped 0.4 percent to 2,533 yen.  Kyocera Corp. (6971) , an
electronic components maker that gets more than half of its
sales outside Japan, slid 0.8 percent to 6,500 yen. Canon Inc.,
a camera maker that gets 80 percent of its revenue overseas,
lost 0.5 percent to 3,195 yen.  To contact the reporters on this story:
