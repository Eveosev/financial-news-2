Uruguay will give Canadian airline
Jazz Air Inc. 30 days to indicate its willingness to increase
its stake in Montevideo-based airline Pluna Lineas Aereas
Uruguayas SA, Uruguay Transport Minister Enrique Pintado said
today in Montevideo.  The government will take control of Pluna’s management and
financing until a new investor buys Leadgate Investment’s stake
in the company, Pintado said. Jazz Air already owns 33 percent
of Pluna, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
