Spadel SA (SPA) , the Belgian bottler of
 mineral water , estimates that first-half volume sales of water
will decline 2.2 percent,  De Tijd  reported, citing Chief
Executive Officer Marc du Bois.  “We sold more in the first three months of the year, but
since then it’s going wrong,” the newspaper cited Du Bois as
saying after the company’s annual general meeting.  Du Bois said circumstances are “extremely difficult,”
according to the newspaper. “There is absolutely no room for
maneuver for prices, while our raw materials have become
remarkably more expensive,” Du Bois was quoted as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
