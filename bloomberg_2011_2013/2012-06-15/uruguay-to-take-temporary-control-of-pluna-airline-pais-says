Uruguay is set to take temporary
control of Montevideo-based airline Pluna Lineas Aereas
Uruguayas SA, El Pais said, citing people involved in the
negotiations it didn’t identify.  The government will take control of the airline’s
management and financing until a new investor buys Leadgate
Investment’s 75 percent stake in the company, El Pais said.
Canadian airline Jazz Air Inc., which already owns 33 percent of
Pluna, is interested in extending its stake, the Montevideo-
based newspaper said.  Shares of Leadgate Investments, a consortium of investors
from Uruguay,  Germany , Argentina and the U.S., will go to a
trust administered by the country’s securities exchange,
according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
