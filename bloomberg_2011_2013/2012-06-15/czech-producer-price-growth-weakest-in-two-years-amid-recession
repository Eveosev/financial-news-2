Czech producer prices grew at the
slowest pace in two years in May as policy makers debate whether
to cut  interest rates  amid a recession.  Producer prices  rose 1.7 percent from a year earlier,
compared with a 2.2 percent increase in April, the Prague-based
Czech Statistics Office said in a statement. The reading was
lower than the median forecast of 1.8 percent in a Bloomberg
survey of nine analysts. Prices were unchanged from the previous
month.  Policy makers are assessing the impact of the government’s
tax increases on inflation and the effects of the euro area’s
sovereign-debt crisis on the economy. The central bank’s board
split three ways over monetary-policy settings at the last
meeting on May 3 as members saw diverging inflation risks.  Four board members voted to keep the benchmark two-week
repurchase rate unchanged at a record low of 0.75 percent in
May. Two policy makers, including Governor Miroslav Singer,
sought a quarter-point cut in the main rate, which hasn’t
changed in two years, while one rate setter wanted an increase
to 1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
