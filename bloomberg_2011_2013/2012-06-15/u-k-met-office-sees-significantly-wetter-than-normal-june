The U.K. has been “significantly”
wetter than normal in June, and some areas in the south have
received double the amount of rainfall they would normally get
during the whole month, the  Met Office  said.  An average 55.5 millimeters (2.2 inches) of rain has fallen
across the U.K. this month, the country’s weather forecaster
said today on its  website . That represents about 76 percent of
the amount of rainfall the country normally would receive in all
of June. Usually by this time, it’s received about 43 percent of
its monthly average, the Met Office said.  The county of West Sussex and Greater London have had more
than 100 millimeters of rain, double or almost double the normal
amount for the month, the Met Office said. June temperatures
have been about 1.4 degrees Celsius (2.5 degrees Fahrenheit)
below the average, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
