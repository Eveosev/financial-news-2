Kenya ’s shilling headed for a second
weekly gain as the central bank encourages lenders to deposit
money, draining cash out of the market and tightening money
supply.  The currency of East  Africa ’s largest economy appreciated
0.3 percent to 84.70 a dollar by 1:54 p.m. in Nairobi, on course
for its strongest closing level since June 7, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. It climbed less than 0.1 percent this
week, after adding 1.5 percent last week.  “The central bank has actively been in the market for the
last two weeks,” Peter Mutuku, a currency trader with Nairobi-
based Bank of Africa, said in a phone interview. “That’s
sending strong signals to show they are doing whatever is
necessary to make sure the shilling doesn’t go back to the
problems it had in 2011.”  The currency hit a record low on Oct. 11, weakening 25
percent from January 2011 to the lowest level since at least
1988, as inflation soared to almost 20 percent and the current-
account deficit widened.  Kenya’s central bank, which uses open market operations to
reduce  money supply  and support the shilling, today offered 2
billion shillings ($23.6 million) in  repurchase agreements  and
term-auction deposits in a sale ending at 1:45 p.m. The central
bank on June 5 re-introduced the deposits as a measure for
“liquidity management,” according to a statement on its
website.  Term-auction deposits offer maturities of 14, 21 and 28
days and are paid back with interest, while the tenor of repos
is typically seven days or less and the securities are offered
at a discounted yield, according to a research note from
Nairobi-based Sterling Capital Ltd e-mailed June 11.  Uganda ’s shilling erased earlier losses, climbing 0.1
percent to 2,495 a dollar for the first gain in three days,
while Tanzania’s currency appreciated 0.3 percent to 1,580.  To contact the reporter on this story:
