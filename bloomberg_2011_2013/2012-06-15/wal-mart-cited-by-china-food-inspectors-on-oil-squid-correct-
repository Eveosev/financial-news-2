(Corrects spelling of province in second paragraph)  Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) , the world’s
largest retailer, was cited by the Beijing  Food Safety 
Administration for selling sesame oil and squid with hazardous
levels of chemicals.  The products were produced in March by companies in China’s
Hebei and Shandong provinces, the Beijing Food Safety
Administration said in a  statement  released June 13. The squid
and sesame oil were removed from store shelves immediately, Wal-
Mart spokeswoman Christina Lee said in an e-mail today.  “We urged the suppliers to strictly abide by relevant
state regulations and supply products that meet all national
standards,” Lee said.  China this week unveiled measures to improve food safety,
including tighter supervision and harsh punishments for
violators, according to the official Xinhua News Agency. Police
in  China  arrested Wal-Mart workers in Chongqing in October amid
a probe of allegations the retailer mislabeled ordinary pork as
organic. They were released in May.  To contact the reporter on this story:
