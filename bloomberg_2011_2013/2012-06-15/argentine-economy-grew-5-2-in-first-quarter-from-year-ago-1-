Argentina ’s economy  expanded  at the
slowest pace since 2009 in the first quarter, hampered by a
slowdown in Brazil and drought-hit harvests.  South America’s second-biggest economy grew 5.2 percent
from the year earlier, the National Statistics Institute said in
Buenos Aires today. Expansion exceeded the 4.8 percent median
 estimate  of eight economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The economy
grew 0.9 percent from the fourth quarter of 2011.  A shortage of rain that affected soybean and corn crops,
reduced demand in neighboring Brazil, Argentina’s main trade
partner, and restrictions on  imports  that led to a shortage of
parts for manufacturers, contributed to the slowdown. The
country, which expanded an average of 7.7 percent a year from
2003 to 2011, will expand 3.5 percent this year, according to a
June 14 report by the  United Nations . That would be the weakest
growth since 2009, when the economy expanded 0.9 percent.  Vehicle production fell 24 percent in May from a year
earlier as exports plunged 46 percent, the Argentine Automakers
Association said June 5. About 80 percent of auto exports are
sold to Brazil.  The slowdown in demand from Brazil prompted  Renault (RNO) 
Argentina SA, the country’s third-biggest car producer, to cut
shifts this month.  The Buenos Aires Cereals Exchange last month forecast that
the drought will reduce this year’s soybean harvest to 39.9
million tons from the previous season’s 49.2 million tons, while
corn output will drop 16.5 percent to 19.3 million tons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
