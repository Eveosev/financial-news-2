Investors should buy assets in U.S.
dollars and other currencies of strong developed nations because
 Japan  may default within five years, said Takeshi Fujimaki,
former adviser to billionaire investor  George Soros .  “Japan is likely to default before  Europe  does, which
could be in the next five years,” the president of Fujimaki
Japan, an investment advising company in  Tokyo , said in an
interview yesterday. Japanese should hold foreign-currency
products, such as those denominated in the greenback, Swiss
franc, sterling, Australian and Canadian dollars, Fujimaki said.  Should the Japanese government default, the yen may weaken
to 400-500 per dollar, and the yields on benchmark 10-year bonds
could surge above 80 percent, according to Fujimaki. “I’m
buying dollars in case of an emergency,” he said.  The yen rose 0.6 percent to 78.91 per dollar as of 6:07
a.m. in  London  from its close in  New York  yesterday. The
currency touched the postwar high of 75.35 per dollar on Oct. 31
and has averaged about 103 over the past decade. Japan’s 10-year
 yields  were little changed at 0.855 percent. Rates on June 4
dropped to 0.79 percent, the lowest since June 2003.  Five-year credit-default swaps that insure Japan’s debt
from nonpayment were at 90.9 basis points yesterday, up from a
seven-month low of 90.1 on March 27, according to CME Group
Inc.’s CMA. The contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange
for the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its
debt agreements. A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  Ballooning Debt  Japan’s public borrowings, the world’s biggest, will
balloon to 245.6 percent of its annual economic output in 2014,
up from 67.3 percent in 1984, an estimate by the International
Monetary Fund shows. Japanese Prime Minister  Yoshihiko Noda  is
struggling to gather support for his plan to double the 5
percent sales tax by 2015 to help reduce debt.  “The yen and the JGB market are in a bubble,” Fujimaki
said. “With the gigantic debt Japan has accumulated, a thin
needle, or even a gentle breeze may pop this. Events in Europe
can possibly trigger this to blow up.”  Greeks vote in a general election on June 17 after
balloting in May failed to produce a coalition government. The
result may determine whether  Greece  abides by spending
reductions imposed upon it to receive two international bailouts
and stay in the euro. The euro currency bloc may break up in the
next 5 to 10 years, Fujimaki said.  Default or Inflate  “There’s no way out of Japan’s crisis,” Fujimaki said.
“The only option left for Japan is either default or print
money into hyper-inflation.”  The  Bank of Japan  left the size of its asset-purchase fund
unchanged at a policy meeting today. The central bank kept the
fund at 40 trillion yen ($507 billion) and a credit lending
program at 30 trillion yen, matching the forecasts of 13
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.  Fujimaki’s agreement with  Soros Fund Management , once the
world’s biggest hedge fund group, ended in October 2000. He has
since written a book and lectured at  Waseda University  and
Hitotsubashi University in Tokyo. He was born in 1950.  To contact the reporter on this story:
