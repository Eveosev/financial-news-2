Germany , the European Union’s
second-largest grain producer, had a dry and sunny May that
reduced rainfall by 26 percent from average levels, the national
weather service said.  “It was rather dry, and richer in sunshine than normal,”
Offenbach, Germany-based Deutscher Wetterdienst said in a  report 
on its website today.  Average rainfall last month was 52.8 millimeters (2.1
inches), 18.8 millimeters below the average for the 1981-2010
period, the weather office said. May’s average temperature in
Germany was 14.2 degrees Celsius (57.6 degrees Fahrenheit), 1.2
degrees above the norm for the 30-year period, it said.  Last month was the 11th-warmest May since the start of the
20th century and the seventh-sunniest since 1951, according to
the report. In terms of rainfall, the month ranked as the 34th-
driest since 1901, the office reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
