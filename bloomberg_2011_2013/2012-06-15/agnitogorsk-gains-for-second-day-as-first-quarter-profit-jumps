OAO Magnitogorsk Iron & Steel,
Russian billionaire Victor Rashnikovâ€™s steelmaker, climbed after
posting an unexpected profit in the first quarter as prices for
finished products increased and costs for raw materials fell.  Magnitogorsk rose 1.3 percent to 9.292 rubles by the close
in Moscow, the biggest advance since June 7 and the second day
of gains.  Profit for the period was $14 million compared with a loss
of $67 million in the fourth quarter of last year, MMK, as the
metals company is known, said today in a statement. That beat an
average loss of $10.4 million estimated by 10 analysts surveyed
by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
