Samsonite International SA (1910) , the
world’s largest branded-luggage maker, described three brands as
“completely safe,” after the Hong Kong Consumer Council said
handles on those models contained carcinogens.  The handles of some Samsonite luggage models contain
materials which could cause cancer, Choice Magazine, a monthly
magazine published by Hong Kong Consumer Council, said in its
June edition. The immediate danger is minimal, the magazine
said.  Samsonite  shares  fell 16 percent to HK$12.08 in Hong Kong
trading today after the council’s report. The Mansfield,
Massachusetts-based luggage company in a statement issued today
said it had sent samples to an independent laboratory for
testing and that the Tokyo Chic, Cubelite and Westlake lines
mentioned by the publication were safe to use.  “Based on the independent test results as well as on
specialist expert opinion, we are absolutely confident that
consumers can continue to use our luggage without any safety or
health concerns at all,” Ramesh Tainwala, Samsonite’s Asia-
Pacific & Middle East president, said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
