Uganda ,  Africa ’s third-biggest tea
grower, reduced its forecast for the 2012 crop by 1.8 percent
after a drought in the first quarter cut yields, the Uganda Tea
Association said.  The output estimate was revised to 54 million kilograms
(119 million pounds) from an initial forecast of 55 million
kilograms in January, George William Ssekitoleko, the
association’s executive secretary, said by phone today from
Kampala, the capital.  “The drought in January to March affected the blossoming
of leaves since the crop needs good rains,” he said.
“Production will drop for the second year after we got a record
level in 2010.”  Tea is one of the main foreign-exchange earners for Uganda,
 which consumes about 3 percent of its annual crop and exports
most of its leaves through the world’s largest tea auction at
Mombasa, in neighboring  Kenya . Uganda, which is Africa’s largest
coffee exporter, experienced the worst drought in 60 years this
season, leading to food shortages.  This may be the second annual decline in output after
production dropped to 56 million kilograms in 2011 from 59
million kilograms a year earlier, he said.  A local unit of  McLeod Russell India Ltd. (MCLR) , the world’s
biggest tea producer, accounts for a quarter of the nation’s
annual crop, according to the association.  Kenya and Malawi are the biggest growers of tea in Africa.  To contact the reporter on this story:
