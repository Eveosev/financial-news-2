OAO Rosneft, Russia’s biggest oil
producer, gained the most in two weeks after President  Vladimir Putin  called on Chief Executive Officer  Igor Sechin  to boost the
company’s dividend.  The shares rose 2 percent to 201.18 rubles by the close in
Moscow, the biggest gain since May 31. Oil producer OAO Tatneft
surged 4.2 percent, while OAO Gazprom Neft gained 1.5 percent.  Sechin agreed to consider raising the company’s dividend
payout to 25 percent of net income this year from 11.5 percent
in comments at a meeting in Tuapse, on Russia’s Black Sea coast.  “This is a call to all  oil companies  to raise their
dividends,” Vadim Bit-Avragim, a Moscow-based portfolio manager
at Kapital Asset Management, which holds Rosneft shares, said by
phone. “Rosneft is the face of the oil sector.”  Rosneft’s board recommended increasing the 2011 dividend 25
percent to 3.45 rubles ($0.12) per share on April 28. The board
of OAO Gazprom,  Russia ’s natural-gas export monopoly,
recommended a record 2011 dividend of 8.97 rubles a share.
Gazprom traded up 2.8 percent at 156.33 rubles.  “This will likely be considered a floor for dividend
payouts for the industry,” Dmitry Loukashov, an oil and gas
analyst at VTB Capital, said by telephone from Moscow today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
