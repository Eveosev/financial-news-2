The future of the euro doesn’t
depend on the outcome of  Greece ’s parliamentary elections on
June 17, Germany’s Economy Minister Philipp Roesler told  Bild am
Sonntag  in an interview.  Europe  has a “resilient system” to weather the crisis and
the euro “may become one of the most stable currencies in the
world” once the measures are implemented, he was cited as
saying.  Roesler added that any future government will have to
continue the course of austerity and reform, and that there will
be no additional funds without reforms, Bild reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
