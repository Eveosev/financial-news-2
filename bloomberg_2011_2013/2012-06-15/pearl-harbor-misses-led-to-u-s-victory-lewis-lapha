The  Pearl Harbor  losses inflicted by
 Japan  were staggering.  More than 3,500 were killed or injured. Eight battleships,
three light cruisers, three destroyers and four auxiliary craft
were sunk or heavily damaged. The Navy lost 92 planes, while the
Army saw 77 destroyed and 128 damaged.  (To listen to the podcast, click  here .)  When Chester W. Nimitz flew into Pearl Harbor on Christmas
Day 1941 to take control of the Pacific fleet, he saw that the
attack could have been much worse.  Aircraft carriers and submarines, which would dominate in
the coming Pacific battles, were left intact.  The dry docks and maintenance facilities were pretty much
unscathed. Most important, the surviving oil tanks held 4.5
million barrels of fuel, which meant that the fleet need not
head back to the West Coast.  These strategic blunders cost Japan victory in the Pacific.  I spoke with Walter Borneman, author of “The Admirals:
Nimitz, Halsey, Leahy and King -- The Five-Star Admirals Who Won
the War at Sea,” on the following topics:  1. Annapolis  2. Subs and Carriers  3. Pearl Harbor  4. Midway  5. U.S. Industrial Might  To buy this book in  North America , click  here .  ( Lewis Lapham  is the founder of  Lapham’s Quarterly  and the
