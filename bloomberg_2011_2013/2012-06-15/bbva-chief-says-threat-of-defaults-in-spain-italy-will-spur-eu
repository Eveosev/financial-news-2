Chairman  Francisco Gonzalez  said the threat of debt defaults
sweeping through  Spain  and  Italy  and wrecking global growth will
force European officials to act to stop the debt crisis.  “There has to be movement, otherwise we’ll start to head
toward the scenario -- which I don’t believe in -- which is
defaults for Spain and Italy,” Gonzalez said during a
discussion in Santiago de Compostela yesterday  broadcast  on
radio station Cadena Ser’s website. “The economic impact of
that would be so far-reaching for Spain,  Europe  and the world,
that I just can’t see it. This is going to get fixed.”  German Chancellor Angela Merkel yesterday rejected
“seemingly easy” solutions to the financial turmoil, resisting
calls by France, Spain and Italy for the  European Central Bank 
to fund southern European nations that are being squeezed out of
debt markets. The yield on Spain’s 10-year debt touched a euro-
era record of 6.998 yesterday after Moody’s Investors Service
cut the sovereign’s rating to one step from junk.  Bankers and politicians across southern Europe are lobbying
Germany and the ECB to buy their debt and stimulate economic
growth after bond-market contagion accelerated following a 100
billion-euro ($126 billion) bank-rescue package for Spain
approved on June 9.  Shares of BBVA, Spain’s second-biggest bank, have tumbled
28 percent over the past year as the country’s second recession
in three years pushed up unemployment and raised concerns about
undisclosed real-estate losses that lenders may be carrying on
their balance sheets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
