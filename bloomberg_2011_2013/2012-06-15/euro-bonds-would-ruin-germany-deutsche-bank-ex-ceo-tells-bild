Germany has supplied all the aid it
can answer for and collectivizing the euro area’s debts with
joint bonds or a redemption fund would push the country into
ruin, Hilmar Kopper,  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) ’s former chief executive
officer, wrote in Bild-Zeitung.  Joint debt, dubbed euro bonds, would increase Germany’s
risk to more than its economic output, reduce its  credit rating ,
boost interest rates on its borrowings and increase its
budgetary burden, said Kopper, who is now supervisory board
chairman at HSH Nordbank AG.  To contact the reporter on this story:
