Investors will be “skeptical”
about  Hungary ’s willingness to reach an international-loan
agreement even after the government pledged to meet the terms
for starting talks,  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc  said.  Hungary will submit a new central bank law to Parliament
next week, which may pave the way for the negotiations to begin
before September,  Mihaly Varga , Hungary’s chief negotiator, told
state television channel M1 today.  A disputed law on the monetary authority has held up talks
on a loan from the  International Monetary Fund  since the
government asked for financial assistance in November. Hungary
has room to maneuver and copy a tactic by Turkey, which after
more than a year and half of bailout negotiations announced in
March 2010 it no longer needed aid, according to RBS.  “Hungary still, though, has lots of cards to play a
‘ Turkey ’ with the market and the IMF, keeping the market warm
over the prospects of a new IMF agreement without actually
signing on the dotted line,” Timothy Ash, head of emerging-
market research at RBS in London, wrote in a note to clients
today. “If forced, Hungary will sign a new IMF agreement, but I
still sense that if they can get by without one, they will
still.”  While the delay has limited gains in the forint, the
currency has risen 6.5 percent against the euro this year, the
third-most among 31 major currencies tracked by Bloomberg behind
the Colombian peso and the Turkish lira.  Hungary hasn’t sold international debt this year and has
met financing needs from forint-denominated bond sales. Local-
currency  debt  held by foreign investors rose to a record 4.32
trillion forint ($18.5 billion) on May 29, according to the
government debt management agency’s Bloomberg page.  To contact the reporter on this story:
