Yale University  agreed to settle a
complaint that it failed to eliminate sex discrimination on
campus, the U.S. Education Department said.  The office received a complaint in March 2011 that a
“sexually hostile environment existed on campus” at  New Haven ,
Connecticut-based Yale, the department of education’s Office of
Civil Rights said today in a  statement .  The complaint followed an incident in October 2010, when
fraternity pledges chanted sexually aggressive comments outside
the university’s Women’s Center located on Old Campus, where
most freshman students live, according to the statement. Members
of the Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity had shouted “No Means
Yes” and other slogans as part of its initiation ceremony that
month.  Yale worked with the office of  civil rights  during the
investigation, according to today’s statement. The agreement
provides that the university will continue to improve and
publicize resources and programming aimed at responding to and
preventing sexual harassment and violence.  The university said in a statement that it is satisfied
that the office of civil rights closed its investigation without
any finding of non-compliance.  “Yale has sought to engage the entire community to combat
sexual misconduct in a transparent, consistent and comprehensive
manner,” according to the university’s statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
