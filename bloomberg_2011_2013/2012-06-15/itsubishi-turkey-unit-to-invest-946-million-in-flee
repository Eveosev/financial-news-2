Ekim Turizm Sanayi & Ticaret AS,
 Turkey ’s largest car-fleet rental company in which  Mitsubishi
Corp. (8058)  holds a stake, plans to invest 750 million euros
($946 million) over four years to triple the number of vehicles.  The investment will expand the fleet to 80,000 cars from
26,000, Vural Ak, the founder and majority owner of the
Istanbul-based company, said in a telephone interview today. The
fleet will be about 30,000 vehicles at the end of this year.  Intercity Rent-a-Car , as the unit is known, also may sell
shares through an initial public offering next year if market
conditions are favorable, Ak said. “We may delay the IPO plan a
little further if the conditions are not good.”  Ak owns 53 percent of the company, while Mitsubishi Corp.
has 36 percent and  Mitsubishi UFJ Lease & Finance Co. Ltd. (8593) , a
unit of the Japanese conglomerate, holds 11 percent, Ak said.  The company, which controls 25 percent of the Turkish
market for car-fleet rentals according to its  website , intends
to increase sales 10 percent this year to 250 million euros,
Ak said.  The company has a “big growth potential because of the low
fleet-rental penetration in the Turkish market,” Ak said. About
130,000 of Turkey’s 16 million motor vehicles are supplied by
fleet-rental companies, he said. “Nearly 23 percent of Turkey’s
total cars belong to companies or institutions, and that shows
the potential,” he said.  Intercity has a 92 percent contract-renewal rate among
customers, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
