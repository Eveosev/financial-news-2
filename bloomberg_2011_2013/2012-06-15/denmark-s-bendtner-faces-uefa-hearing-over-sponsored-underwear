Denmark  striker Nicklas Bendtner
faces a disciplinary hearing after showing an unofficial
sponsor’s name on his underwear during a goal celebration at
Euro 2012.  European soccer governing body UEFA said on its website
that Bendtner broke Law 4 of the soccer regulations regarding
uniforms. UEFA will hear the case on June 18.  Bendtner lifted his shirt and lower his shorts a bit to
show the name of a gambling company on the top of his underwear
after scoring his second goal in Denmark’s 3-2 loss to Portugal
two days ago. Sponsor advertising is not allowed on player
uniforms.  Denmark plays  Germany  in its final group match in Lviv,
Ukraine, in two days.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
