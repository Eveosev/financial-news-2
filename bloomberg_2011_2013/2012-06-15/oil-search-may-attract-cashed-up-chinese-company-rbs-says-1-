Oil Search Ltd. (OSH) ,  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) ’s
partner in a $15.7 billion natural gas project in  Papua New
Guinea , may attract a takeover bid, potentially from a Chinese
buyer, Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc said.  “We see a distinct possibility that a cashed-up Chinese
major could take a swing at Oil Search,” Philipp Kin, a Sydney-
based analyst at RBS, wrote in a report yesterday. “PNG has
vast potential for more gas and oil discoveries.”  Papua New Guinea’s largest oil producer and Exxon should
find sufficient reserves to underpin an expansion of their
liquefied natural gas development, while Oil Search’s stock
price only reflects a 15 percent chance of it going ahead,
according to RBS, which has a “buy” rating on the shares. Oil
Search also may sign a high-profile partner to develop fields in
the Gulf of Papua region, Kin wrote.  Port Moresby-based Oil Search has started the largest
drilling program in its history and is seeking supplies to
support further LNG production units. The company is reviewing
Gulf of Papua partnership offers, Oil Search said in April.  A spokeswoman for Oil Search in Sydney declined to comment
on the RBS report.  Shares of Oil Search  closed unchanged at A$6.67 in Sydney,
valuing the company at A$8.9 billion ($8.9 billion). The S&P/ASX
200 Index increased 0.4 percent.  “Sovereign risk would probably be an impediment for any
prospective buyer,” including a Chinese company, RBS said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
