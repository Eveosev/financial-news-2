Panama ’s government expects to raise
$750 million by selling its stake in a local unit of  Cable &
Wireless Worldwide Plc (CW/)  after lawmakers approve the deal as early
as next week, Finance Minister Frank De Lima said.  The Central America government will sell about half of its
49 percent holding in CW Panama on the Panamanian stock exchange
and place the rest of its shares in a sovereign wealth fund, De
Lima said.  London-based Cable & Wireless, which can still oppose the
sale, has the first option to buy 5 percent of its shares back,
he said.  “They could block it if they wanted to,” De Lima said in
an interview in Panama City. “But they’re on board.”  Cable & Wireless  “respects” the government’s decision and
will wait for lawmakers to vote on the sale before deciding on
whether to exercise its right to 5 percent, the company said in
an e-mailed statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
