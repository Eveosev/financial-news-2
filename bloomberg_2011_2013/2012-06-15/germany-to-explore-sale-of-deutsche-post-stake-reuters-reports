Germany asked investment banks to
explore a possible sale of at least part of its 30.5 percent
stake in  Deutsche Post AG (DPW) , Reuters reported, citing three
unidentified people familiar with the process.  The stake, held through state-controlled lender KfW, has a
market value of 4.9 billion euros ($6.2 billion), the news
service said.  No bank has been formally mandated, Reuters said, adding
that Deutsche Post, KfW and Germanyâ€™s finance ministry declined
to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
