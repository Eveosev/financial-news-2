OAO Transneft,  Russia ’s oil pipeline
operator, said it hasn’t filled all the available crude export
slots in June from the nation’s  Baltic Sea  ports.  The 10 free positions of Urals for loading in June from
Ust-Luga and Primorsk weren’t taken up because of increased
domestic demand for crude, Igor Dyomin, a spokesman for the
company, said today by phone from Moscow.  The full loading plan for June is made up of 60 slots from
Primorsk and 13 from Ust-Luga. Those shipments were estimated at
7.33 million metric tons, according to a final loading program
obtained by Bloomberg News on May 25.  Of that, cargoes totaling 700,000 tons from Primorsk
haven’t been allocated, while 300,000 tons from Ust-Luga haven’t
been assigned.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
