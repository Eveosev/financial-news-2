Ghana ’s cedi retreated for the
second week to the lowest on record against the U.S. currency as
importers bought dollars.  The currency of the world’s second biggest cocoa producer
depreciated 0.3 percent to 1.9275 by 2:57 p.m. in Accra, the
weakest level since June 1993, when Bloomberg began compiling
the data. That brings the cedi’s loss this week to 1 percent,
adding to last week’s 0.9 percent decline.  “Dollar demand is still firm from the manufacturing and
the commerce industry,” Jacob Brobbey, a currency trader at the
local unit of Barclays Bank Plc, said by phone today. “Mining
companies sold dollars this week but it was not much, compared
to demand on the market.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
