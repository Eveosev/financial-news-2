Indian stocks rose, capping a second
weekly advance for the benchmark index, on speculation central
banks in India,  Europe  and the U.S. may act to boost economies
amid faltering growth and as local companies paid higher taxes.  Tata Motors Ltd. (TTMT) , India’s biggest automaker, surged 6
percent after Chairman Ratan Tata bought the company’s shares
and sales at its Jaguar Land Rover unit rose more than analysts
estimated. Asian  stocks  climbed as the stimulus optimism
countered concerns Europe’s debt crisis will worsen.  Hindustan
Unilever Ltd. (HUVR) , the Indian unit of the world’s second-largest
consumer goods company, climbed 2 percent to a record.  The  BSE India Sensitive Index (SENSEX) , or Sensex, jumped 1.6
percent to 16,949.83 at close. The gauge rose 1.4 percent this
week.  Bank of England  Governor Mervyn King said yesterday the
case for looser policy is “growing,” while U.S. economic data
may support the case for further stimulus from the  Federal
Reserve , which meets for two days from June 19.  “Global optimism drove Indian equities after we saw a good
correction yesterday,” said Anita Gandhi, a director at Arihant
Capital Markets Ltd. in Mumbai. “Markets believe the  Reserve
Bank  of India will certainly ease monetary policy. The question
is what would be the quantum of easing.”  The RBI may lower  rates  for a second time this year at its
policy review on June 18 amid the slowest economic expansion in
nine years, economists say, even as data yesterday showed
 wholesale prices  accelerated for a second month in May.  Interest-rate Outlook  The central bank will cut a key rate by 25 basis points to
7.75 percent, according to 19 of 25 economists in a Bloomberg
survey. Four predict the central bank will leave the rate
unchanged and two forecast a 50-basis-point cut.  China  cut borrowing costs on June 7 for the first time in
more than three years, two days after  Australia  reduced rates.  India’s  inflation  quickened a faster-than-estimated 7.55
percent, after rising 7.23 percent in April. The median of 37
forecasts in a Bloomberg survey was for a 7.5 percent gain. A
separate report showed a drop in exports and imports last month.  Economic  expansion  in the first quarter was the weakest in
almost a decade as a policy gridlock in the ruling coalition
undermined Prime Minister  Manmohan Singh ’s efforts to revive
the economy and the debt crisis in Europe, India’s top trading
partner, crimped exports. Government data earlier this week
showed factory output grew less than analysts estimated in
April, adding to the case for a rate cut.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  climbed 1 percent at 4:44 p.m.
in Mumbai today.  European stocks  advanced for the first time in
three days, with the  Stoxx Europe 600 Index (SXXP)  gaining 1.1 percent.  Greek Vote  On June 17, almost 10 million Greeks will vote for the
second time in six weeks after a May 6 ballot failed to result
in a government. The constitution permits a third election too.
Exit polls will be released when voting ends at 7 p.m.  The Sensex rallied 4.7 percent last week, its best weekly
advance this year, amid speculation the RBI would ease monetary
policy. The gauge has climbed 9.7 percent this year and  trades 
at 13.3 times estimated earnings. The  MSCI Emerging Markets
Index (MXEF)  trades at 10 times.  Tata Motors surged 6 percent to 240.3 rupees, the biggest
rally in four months. The company reported deliveries at its
British luxury-automobile unit increased 35 percent to 30,094
vehicles in May, exceeding the 28,175 average estimate of 11
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Ratan Tata bought 425,000 shares
at 233.87 rupees apiece yesterday, the company said in a
separate stock exchange filing.  Advance Tax  Hindustan Unilever climbed 2 percent to a record 449.45
rupees. The company is paying 1.4 billion rupees of tax for the
quarter ending June, compared with 950 million rupees last year,
said a deputy commissioner at Mumbai’s income tax department,
who declined to be identified citing rules.  Companies pay tax in advance based on their estimated
income for the year, a measure monitored by investors as an
indicator of profitability.  ICICI Bank Ltd. (ICICIBC) , the second-largest lender, jumped 3.3
percent to 845.70 rupees, the most since May 25. The bank
increased advance-tax payment 25 percent, the official said.
 HDFC Bank Ltd. (HDFCB)  advanced 2.5 percent to 547.55 rupees.  Coal India Ltd. (COAL) , the world’s largest producer of the fuel,
rallied 2.6 percent to 339.70 rupees, the most since April 26,
and Larsen & Toubro, India’s largest engineering company, gained
2.1 percent to 1,323.75 rupees.  India VIX, which measures the cost of protection against
losses in the S&P CNX Nifty Index, slid 0.7 percent to 25.54.
The Nifty jumped 1.7 percent to 5,139.05 while its June futures
settled at 5,147.70. The  BSE-200 Index (BSE200)  rose 1.5 percent to
2,074.76. Combined trading volume on  India ’s top two exchanges
was 690.65 million shares yesterday, compared with a 12-month
daily average of 906.39 million.  Overseas  investors  were net buyers of local shares for a
sixth straight day on June 13, purchasing a net  $49 million  of
stocks and taking their total investment this year to $8.56
billion, data from the regulator show. They cut holdings by $273
million in May, a second consecutive month of net sales.  To contact the reporter on this story:
