Bank Zachodni WBK SA (BZW) , the Polish
unit of Spain’s Banco  Santander (SAN)  SA, headed for its steepest fall
in three weeks after a downgrade from  Fitch Ratings .  The stock slid 1.7 percent to 228 zloty as of 1:56 p.m. in
Warsaw, the biggest decline on a closing basis since May 23.
Zachodni will merge with Kredyt Bank SA, which Santander bought
from KBC Groep NV this year.  Fitch lowered Zachodni’s rating to BBB from A- yesterday
following the downgrade of its parent company and an
“assessment of the credit profile of the entity emerging from
the planned merger” with Kredyt Bank SA, the agency said in a
 statement .  Santander, Spain’s biggest lender, is looking to expand in
 Poland  to diversify its earnings as profit at home slumped
following Spain’s property crash. The lender’s first-quarter
profit dropped 24 percent to 1.6 billion euros ($2 billion) as
souring loans crimped income from its home market, Brazil and
the U.K, it said April 26.  Fitch affirmed  Kredyt Bank (KRB) ’s at BBB, removing it from
rating watch positive. The lender was unchanged at 13.25 zloty.  KBC sold Kredyt as part of its strategy to repay 7 billion
euros of rescue funds it received from the Belgian government
during the credit crisis.  Polish financial markets regulator is “surprised” by
Fitch’s decision as Zachodni has “high and stable profits‘‘ and
is ‘‘well-capitalized,’’ it said in a statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
