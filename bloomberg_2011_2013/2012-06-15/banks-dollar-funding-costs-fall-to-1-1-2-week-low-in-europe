The cost for European banks to
borrow in dollars declined to a 1 1/2-week low, according to a
money-markets indicator.  The three-month cross-currency  basis swap , the rate banks
pay to convert euro interest payments into dollars, was 50 basis
points below the euro interbank offered rate at 9:15 a.m. in
London, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s from
minus 54 basis points yesterday and compares with minus 59 on
June 4, which was the most expensive in three months.  The one-year basis swap was 54 basis points below Euribor
from minus 57 yesterday. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  Prices in the forward market for three-month Euribor
relative to overnight indexed swaps -- known as the FRA/OIS
spread -- fell to 33 basis points from 36.  The Euribor/OIS spread widened to 40 basis points from 39.
The measure has ranged from 37 basis points to 42 basis points
since the end of March.  Lenders cut  overnight deposits  at the Frankfurt-based
European Central Bank yesterday, placing 700 billion euros ($884
billion) from 704 billion euros the day before.  To contact the reporter on this story:
