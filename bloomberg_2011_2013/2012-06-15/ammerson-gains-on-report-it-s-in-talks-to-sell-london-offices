Hammerson Plc (HMSO)  rose by the most in
nine days in  London  trading after Property Week reported that
the property company is in talks to sell 13 offices and
development sites in the U.K. capital to  Brookfield Office
Properties Inc. (BPO)   Hammerson, the U.K.’s third-largest real-estate company by
market value, gained as much as 2.7 percent. The London-based
company may sell the commercial properties for more than 500
million pounds ($777 million),  Property Week  said, citing people
with knowledge of the negotiations.  Hammerson Chief Executive Officer David Atkins said in
February he planned to sell the London office portfolio and
focus on shopping centers. Hammerson declined to comment on the
report in an e-mailed statement and no one was immediately
available to comment at New York-based Brookfield Office
Properties, the owner of the city’s World Financial Center.  The U.K. company was up 6.7 pence, or 1.6 percent, at 418.6
pence at 11:35 a.m. in London, valuing the company at almost 3
billion pounds. The shares have declined 12 percent in the past
12 months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
