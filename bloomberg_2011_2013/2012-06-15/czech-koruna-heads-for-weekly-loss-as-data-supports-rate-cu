The koruna extended its weekly loss
against the euro after Czech economic data added support for an
interest-rate reduction as early as this month.  The Czech currency depreciated 0.4 percent to 25.595 per
euro by 2:21 p.m. in  Prague , the most among major emerging-
market peers tracked by Bloomberg. The koruna has slipped 0.7
percent since the end of last week.  Industrial producer prices rose at the slowest annual pace
in two years in May, slowing to 1.7 percent from a 2.2 percent
advance in April, the Czech Statistics Office said today. Anti-
inflationary risks are prevailing in the economy, central banker
Lubomir Lizal said on June 12 after data a day earlier showed
consumer price increases in May were the slowest in five months.  “The Czech National Bank may cut its rates already at the
end of June,”  David Marek , chief economist at Patria Finance AS
brokerage in Prague, wrote in an e-mail to clients today. The
slowdown in producer prices “supports an idea of easing
monetary policy,” he said.  Gross domestic product fell 0.8 percent in January to March
from the previous three months, a second consecutive quarterly
contraction, the statistics office said last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
