U.S. stocks rose, giving the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index its first back-to-back weekly gain
since April, amid speculation central banks will take steps to
stimulate growth and contain a prolonged debt crisis in Europe.  All  10 S&P 500 groups  advanced.  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  surged
4 percent, pacing gains among financial companies, after Chief
Executive Officer  Jamie Dimon  testified about his bank’s $2
billion trading loss.  Cabot Oil & Gas Corp. (COG)  jumped 9.7 percent
as a rally in natural-gas prices helped lift energy shares.
 Johnson & Johnson (JNJ)  climbed 4.8 percent after getting clearance
for its Synthes Inc. acquisition.  Facebook Inc. (FB)  surged 11
percent, its first weekly increase since its May debut.  The S&P 500 rose 1.3 percent to 1,342.84 for the week,
extending its 2012 advance to 6.8 percent. The  Dow (INDU)  Jones
Industrial Average climbed 212.97 points, or 1.7 percent, to
12,767.17, building on the previous week’s 3.6 percent increase.  “I’m pretty convinced that they will keep throwing money
at it and trying to buy more time” to tame the European crisis,
 Jeffrey Saut , chief investment strategist at Raymond James &
Associates in St. Petersburg, Florida, said in a telephone
interview. His firm oversees $350 billion. “It means the
 Federal Reserve  is going to have to have some liquidity event to
keep the U.S. dollar from spiking substantially higher, and that
in turn probably gives us another leg up in the stock market.”  Equities rose as signs of a global economic slowdown
spurred speculation about stimulus measures. Policy makers from
the U.K. to Japan and Canada stepped up warnings about the
threat to  financial (S5FINL)  markets should Europe fail to contain its
crisis. In the U.S., reports showing a decline in retail sales,
industrial production and  consumer confidence  added to evidence
of economic weakness before Federal Reserve policy makers meet
June 19-20 to decide whether more stimulus is needed.  Greek Elections  The Fed meeting follows Greek elections on June 17 that may
determine whether the country upholds austerity measures
attached to international aid and remains in the euro bloc. A
victory by Syriza, the party that promises to renege on Greece’s
end of the bailout deal, could speed the nation’s exit from the
euro.  “Everyone is on the sideline because they are fearing if
Greece decides to leave the euro, and it’s not orderly, that
will create uncertainty and the market will get hammered,”
Frank Ingarra, who helps manage $1.4 billion at Greenwich,
Connecticut-based NorthCoast Asset Management LLC, said in a
June 14 phone interview.  Alternating Days  Concern that  Greece  may leave the common currency helped
drive the S&P 500 down 9.9 percent from this year’s peak on
April 2 through June 1. The index then alternated between gains
and losses for seven days starting June 6, a streak not seen
since October, as investors shifted between optimism about
further stimulus and concern over Europe’s debt crisis.  Financial companies in the S&P 500 climbed 1.9 percent as a
group for the week. JPMorgan jumped 4 percent to $35.03. Dimon
told the Senate Banking Committee that a switch to a new risk
model in the first quarter may have helped fuel the $2 billion
trading loss and the bank has shifted back to the old system.  Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  rallied 4.5 percent to $7.90 for the
second-biggest gain in the Dow, while  Morgan Stanley (MS)  added 4.3
percent to $14.30.  Cabot Oil advanced 9.7 percent to $36.20, helping energy
shares in the S&P 500 increase 2.5 percent. Natural-gas futures
surged 14 percent on June 14, the most in 33 months, after the
Energy Department said stockpiles rose less than analysts had
estimated.  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  added 2.9 percent to $83.22.  J&J gained 4.8 percent, the most in the Dow, to $66.01. The
world’s biggest health-care products company said its $19.7
billion purchase of Synthes, the largest acquisition in its 126-
year history, will add 3 cents to 5 cents a share to 2012
earnings.  Facebook Growth  Facebook, which raised $16 billion in the May 17 initial
public offering, advanced 11 percent to $30.01. The world’s
largest social-networking company said it plans to introduce
real-time bidding for advertising on its site, a technology used
by Google Inc. and other Web companies to more effectively
target ads to consumers. The stock slumped 29 percent in the
previous three weeks amid concern ad  revenue growth  isn’t
keeping pace with surging membership.  Edwards Lifesciences Corp. (EW)  rallied 11 percent to $97.52.
The company won the backing of Food and Drug Administration
advisers for an expanded use of its Sapien heart valve as an
alternative to open-heart surgery.  St. Jude Medical Inc. fell 8.8 percent, the most in the S&P
500, to $35.55. The company’s Durata, a wire used to connect
life-saving defibrillators to the heart, was linked to a rare
and dangerous defect in one patient in a report to U.S.
regulators.  AK Steel Holding Corp. (AKS)  sank 8.3 percent to $5.32. The
fourth-largest U.S. steelmaker by shipments was cut to sell from
neutral by Goldman Sachs & Co., which said there is “no relief
in sight” for falling steel prices. The shares have lost 36
percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
