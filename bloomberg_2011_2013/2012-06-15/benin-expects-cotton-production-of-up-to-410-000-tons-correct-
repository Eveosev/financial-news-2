(Corrects to remove cultivation figure in first
paragraph.)  Benin expects to produce 350,000
metric tons to 410,000 tons of cotton this, Minister of
Development Marcel de Souza said.  This is down from an initial estimate of 420,000 tons
because  Africa â€™s fifth-biggest producer of the commodity, has
had difficulty getting fertilizer, de Souza told reporters today
in Porto Novo, the capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
