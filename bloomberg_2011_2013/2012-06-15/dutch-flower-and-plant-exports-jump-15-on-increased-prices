Dutch  flower  and plant exports
jumped 15 percent in May, boosted by rising shipments to  Russia 
and northern Europe as well as higher wholesale prices.  Exports climbed to 638 million euros ($806 million) from
552 million euros a year earlier, the Aalsmeer, Netherlands-
based Dutch Agricultural Wholesale Board for Flowers and Plants
wrote in a  report  on its website today.  Germany , Europe’s largest economy, is the main market for
flowers from the Netherlands. Flower and plant exports to the
country rose 7 percent in the year’s first five months, in
contrast with falling sales to France, Italy, Spain and Greece.  “Plant and flower exports from the Netherlands to southern
European destinations through May are difficult,” the board
wrote. “Due to the lack of confidence in the economy, spending
on flowers and plants in these countries is falling more and
more.”  Consumers in southern  Europe  still buy flowers for special
occasions such as weddings and funerals, the board said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
