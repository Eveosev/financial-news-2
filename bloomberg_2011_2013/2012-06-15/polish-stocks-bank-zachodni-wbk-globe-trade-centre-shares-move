Poland’s  WIG20 Index (WIG20)  climbed 1.2
percent to 2,233.38 at the close in Warsaw, bringing its gain
for the week to 3.4 percent.  The following were among the most active stocks on the
 Warsaw Stock Exchange  today. Stock symbols follow company names.  Bank Zachodni WBK SA (BZW)  , the Polish unit of Spain’s
Santander SA, slid 1.7 percent to 228 zloty, the steepest drop
in three weeks after Fitch Ratings lowered its rating to BBB
from A- yesterday.  Globe Trade Centre SA (GTC)  , the country’s second-
largest property developer by market value, rose 0.8 percent to
6.35 zloty, the highest level in more than five weeks, after
agreeing to sell a real-estate project in Warsaw.  Grupa Lotos SA (LTS PW), Poland’s second-largest oil
refiner, jumped 6.6 percent to 27.47 zloty, its biggest daily
advance in more than eight months, as speculation that central
banks will take steps to shelter economies from Europe’s debt
crisis lifted commodities and emerging-market stocks.  PKO Bank Polski (PKO)  , Poland’s biggest lender, added 2
percent to 32.98 zloty, the strongest closing level in more than
six weeks, as the Bank of England’s comments on easing credit
boosted confidence central banks will provide economic stimulus
to the global economy and buoyed financial stocks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
