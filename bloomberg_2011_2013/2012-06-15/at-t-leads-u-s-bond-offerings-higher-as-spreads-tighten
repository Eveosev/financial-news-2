Sales of U.S. corporate bonds rose
for the second straight week, the first back-to-back gain in
three months, as borrowers took advantage of tightening relative
yields.  AT&T Inc. (T) , the largest U.S. phone company, and Louisville,
Colorado-based Zayo Group LLC led borrowers issuing $17.4
billion, a 6 percent increase from the five days ended June 8,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The extra yield
investors demand to hold corporate debt rather than
Treasuries with similar maturities narrowed 3 basis points this
week through yesterday to 315 basis points, or 3.15 percentage
points, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s U.S.
Corporate & High Yield Master index.  Symantec Corp. joined AT&T as sales reached $6.9 billion on
June 11, the busiest start to a week in more than two months.
While issuers rushed to the market on growing optimism that
financial contagion can be contained following  Spain ’s request
for a 100 billion euro ($126 billion) bank bailout, the pace
slowed in advance of elections on June 17 in  Greece  that may
determine the future of the  euro zone .  “Issuers are being very opportunistic,” said  James Kochan , chief fixed-income strategist in  Menomonee Falls ,
 Wisconsin , at Wells Fargo Fund Management LLC. That means
“coming to market as quickly as they can” in strong conditions
and holding off if the environment becomes less favorable, he
said.  Offerings last rose for two straight weeks in the period
ended March 9, when sales soared to a record $60.1 billion,

auction since Spain’s bank rescue request, putting more pressure
on European leaders to step up their response to the debt
crisis. The Treasury sold 4.5 billion euros of debt, including 3
billion euros of its three-year benchmark bond to yield 5.3
percent, the highest yield since December.  In Greece, the vote will turn on whether residents, in a
fifth year of recession, accept open-ended austerity to stay in
the euro or reject the conditions of a bailout and risk the
turmoil of becoming the first to exit the 17-member currency.
World leaders have said they’d prefer a pro-euro result,
underscoring concern that the region’s crisis will infect
markets globally.  “We’ve just been rotating among these European names,”
 Thomas Chow , a  money manager  at Delaware Investments in
Philadelphia with about $170 billion under management, said in a
telephone interview. “We’re really substituting Ireland for
Greece, Greece for  Portugal , Portugal for Spain. And the next
name on the block is Italy.”  Investment Grade  Investment-grade sales fell this week, with borrowers
issuing $15.7 billion of notes, after $16 billion in the
previous week, Bloomberg data show.  Spreads fell 1 basis point this week to 225 basis points
through yesterday, according to the Bank of America Merrill
Lynch U.S. Corporate Master index. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point. Yields dropped to 3.44 percent from 3.46
percent on June 8.  Dallas-based AT&T issued $1.15 billion of 1.7 percent,
five-year bonds to yield 105 basis points more than Treasuries
and $850 million of 3 percent, 10-year debt, a reopening, with a
135 basis-point spread, Bloomberg data show.  The notes due June 2017 rose 0.1 cent from the issue price
to 99.92 cents on the dollar as of yesterday to yield 1.72
percent, according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of
the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.  High Yield  Symantec (SYMC) , the world’s biggest seller of security software,
offered $600 million of 2.75 percent, five-year notes at a
relative yield of 210 basis points and $400 million of 3.95
percent, 10-year bonds at 245 basis points, Bloomberg data show.  Issuance by speculative-grade borrowers recovered, with
sales of $1.7 billion boosted by Zayo’s $1.25 billion offering,
Bloomberg data show. Sales compare with $392 million last week.  The sale yesterday from the Internet connectivity provider
was the largest in a month for a high-yield issuer, with
proceeds to be used for its acquisition of  AboveNet Inc. (ABVT)   Zayo sold $750 million of 8.125 percent senior secured
notes due January 2020 to yield 698 basis points more than
similar-maturity Treasuries and $500 million of 10.125 percent
senior debt due July 2020 at a spread of 883 basis points,
Bloomberg data show.  Spreads on speculative-grade bonds declined 10 basis points
this week to 685 basis points, according to the Bank of America

to help finance its acquisition by Centerbridge Partners LP,
