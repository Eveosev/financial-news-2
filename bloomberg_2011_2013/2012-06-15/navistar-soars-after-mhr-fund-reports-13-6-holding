Navistar International Corp. (NAV)  soared
as much as 12 percent after after MHR Fund Management LLC
disclosed a 13.6 percent stake in the truckmaker, more than
billionaire investor  Carl Icahn ’s 11.9 percent holding.  Navistar, the maker of International brand trucks, rose 8.2
percent to $31.10 at 11:13 a.m. in  New York  after climbing to
$31.07 earlier. New York-based MHR is run by  Mark Rachesky , a
former protege of Icahn’s.  Chief Executive Officer Daniel Ustian has revamped
management as Navistar struggles to meet 2010 federal emission
standards for one of its truck engines. The company reported a
second-quarter loss, excluding some costs, of $137 million or
$1.99 a share. The truckmaker lowered its full-year profit
forecast to a range of break-even to $2 a year. In February, it
had projected a profit of as much as $5.75 a share.  MHR “may seek to engage in discussions with management”
about how the company is run, according to a regulatory filing.
Icahn lifted his ownership in the Lisle, Illinois-based
truckmaker, according to a regulatory filing last week. It had
been 10.6 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
