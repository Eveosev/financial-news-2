Any multiyear rally in U.S. stocks
may depend on a signal that the  bond market  has yet to send,
according to  Michael Hartnett , Bank of America Corp.’s chief
global equity strategist.  Bond yields have to reach “an inflection point” before
shares can move into what’s known as a secular bull market if
history is any guide, Hartnett wrote in a June 12 report.  The CHART OF THE DAY compares the  Dow Jones Industrial
Average  and the yield on 10-year Treasury notes since 1900, as
Hartnett did in his report. The yield figures were compiled by
Yale University Professor Robert J. Shiller and obtained from
his website.  Hartnett highlighted three inflection points in the past
century, as shown in the chart. They foreshadowed stock-market
booms during the 1920s, after World War II, and throughout most
of the 1980s and 1990s.  A comparable surge in share prices is unlikely, he wrote,
“until Treasury yields rise in response to stronger growth and
a healthier global economy.” The 10-year yield fell to a record
1.4387 percent this month.  Even so, lower yields are giving investors more incentive
to shift into stocks from bonds, the New York-based strategist
wrote. He estimated that it will take a 0.6 percent yield for
the 10-year’s return in the next 12 months to match stocks’
20th-century average of 10.5 percent a year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
