Weather in the U.K. that’s been
“exceptionally wet” since April increased river and reservoir
levels and reduced farmers’ need to irrigate crops, the
Environment Agency said.  About 29 millimeters (1.1 inches) of rain fell in east-
central  England  this week and  Wales  received 63 millimeters, the
agency said in a  report  on its website dated yesterday.
Precipitation totals so far in June have been larger than long-
term averages for the month in many regions, it said.  Groundwater supplies remain low in some areas, with four
water companies maintaining restrictions on public use, the
agency said. Thames Water, Anglian Water and Southern Water
lifted hosepipe bans yesterday.  “The exceptionally wet weather since April has meant that
river and reservoir levels have significantly improved, easing
pressure on the environment and water supplies,” National
Drought Coordinator Polly Chancellor said in the report.
“Despite the lifting of water restrictions in some parts of the
southeast, we urge people to continue to use water wisely.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
