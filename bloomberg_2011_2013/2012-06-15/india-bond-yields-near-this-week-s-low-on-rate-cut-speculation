Indian government bond yields were
near this week’s lowest level on speculation the central bank
will reduce borrowing costs to help boost a slowing economy.  The  Reserve Bank  of  India  will lower the benchmark
 repurchase  rate by 25 basis points to 7.75 percent, according to
19 of 25 economists in a Bloomberg News survey before a policy
review on June 18. Four predicted the central bank will leave
the rate unchanged and two forecast a 50 basis point cut.
Factory output rose 0.1 percent in April from a year earlier
after a revised 3.2 percent drop in March, official data showed
earlier this week.  “Slowing growth appears to be a bigger worry for the
government than stubborn inflation,” DBS Bank Ltd. said in a
note. “A 25 basis point cut in the repurchase rate seems
likely.”  The yield on the government’s 8.15 percent bonds due June
2022 was little changed at 8.05 percent in Mumbai, according to
the central bank’s trading system. The rate touched 8.04 percent
on June 13, the lowest level this week.  The benchmark wholesale-price  index  rose 7.55 percent in
May from a year earlier, after climbing 7.23 percent in April,
the commerce ministry said yesterday. That was more than the 7.5
percent median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey.  One-year  interest-rate swaps , or derivative contracts used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, rose four basis
points to 7.58 percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
