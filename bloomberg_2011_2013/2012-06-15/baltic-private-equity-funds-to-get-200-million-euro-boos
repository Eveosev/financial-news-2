Baltic private-equity funds will
receive at least 200 million euros ($252 million) of new
investment next year, according to an Estonian lobby group.  Half of the funds will be supplied through the Baltic
Innovation Fund, due to be set up by mid-September by the
European Investment Fund and the governments of Estonia, Latvia
and  Lithuania , the Tallinn-based the Estonian Private Equity and
Venture Capital Association said in an e-mailed statement today.  The new investment vehicle will put the money into several
regional funds that will, in turn, raise at least another 100
million euros of private capital, to be invested in local
companies, it said.  The fund will be “highly significant” in the Baltic
region, where 80 percent of private-equity deals are worth less
than 5 million euros and private-equity investment relative to
gross domestic product is seven times below the European
average, the association said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
