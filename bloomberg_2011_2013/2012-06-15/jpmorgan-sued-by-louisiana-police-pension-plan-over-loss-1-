JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  was sued by a
Louisiana police pension fund for alleged  securities fraud  tied
to a trading loss of at least $2 billion.  The Louisiana Municipal Police Employees Retirement System
claimed the biggest U.S. bank and top officials including Chief
Executive Officer  Jamie Dimon  misled investors about its risk
management and financial condition from February 2010 to May
2012.  “Defendants made false and misleading statements and
concealed material information relating to the company’s trading
practices, hedging of risk, risk management, and exposure to
risk of loss,” according to the complaint filed today in U.S.
District Court in Manhattan.  The police pension plan is seeking class-action, or group,
status on behalf of all who bought JPMorgan Chase common stock
from February 2010 to May 2012, a number which may be in the
tens of thousands, according to the complaint. It is also
seeking unspecified compensatory and punitive damages.  Joseph Evangelisti , a spokesman for the New York-based
bank, declined to comment on the allegations.  In May, Dimon announced the lender lost $2 billion as a
result of “egregious mistakes” by its Chief Investment Office.
Ina Drew, who led that office, retired after Dimon’s
announcement and was replaced by Matt James.  The case is Louisiana Municipal Police Employees Retirement
System v. JPMorgan Chase & Co., 12-cv-4729, U.S. District Court,
Southern District of  New York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
