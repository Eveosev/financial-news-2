European soccer’s governing body is
looking into reports from match observers that Croatian
supporters engaged in racist behavior in their team’s game
yesterday with Italy.  Two monitors from UEFA-appointed Football Against Racism
 Europe  have filed a report stating as many as 500 supporters in
the Croatian section subjected Italy striker  Mario Balotelli ,
who is of Ghanian descent, to monkey chants throughout the game
in Poznan,  Poland . A banana was also thrown onto the field.  “This was the worst incident inside a stadium during the
tournament because of the scale of the numbers,” Piara Pawar,
executive director of FARE, said in a telephone interview. The
observers report also includes details of far-right banners
displayed by Croatian fans.  The investigation is the latest into supporters during the
16-team tournament being co-hosted by Ukraine and Poland. UEFA
has already fined the Russian and German federations for
misbehavior by supporters.  “To their credit Italian fans sung Balotelli’s name to try
and drown out the chants from Croatian fans,” Powar said. “It
was fairly consistent throughout the game.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
