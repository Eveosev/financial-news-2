South Korean stocks fell the most
among Asia’s benchmark indexes as  Samsung Electronics Co. (005930) 
dropped after production lines at its display unit were
temporarily halted yesterday.  Samsung Electronics, which makes up 17 percent of the
benchmark Kospi Index, dropped 3.5 percent, leading technology
stocks lower.  SK Hynix Inc. (000660) , the world’s second-largest maker of
computer memory chips, declined after Woori Bank sold the
company’s shares at a discount.  The Kospi fell 0.7 percent to 1,858.16 at the close in
 Seoul , paring this week’s gain to 1.2 percent. Samsung Display
Co., created from a spinoff of Samsung Electronics’ liquid-
crystal-display division, said four lines were halted for 11
minutes after a  power failure  yesterday. The lines have resumed
operation and potential damage from the stoppage is being
assessed, it said.  “The plant stoppage, though temporary, appears to be
affecting sentiment on Samsung shares today, with exact damage
yet to be disclosed,” Im Jeong Jae, a Seoul-based  fund manager 
at Shinhan BNP Paribas Asset Management Co., which oversees
about $28 billion, said by phone today.  Samsung Electronics shares also fell after the Electronic
Times reported the company has a shortage of parts for new
Galaxy S3 smartphones, according to Lim Dori, an analyst at
Shinyoung Securities Co.  SK Hynix lost 2.1 percent to 23,400 won. Woori Bank sold
Hynix shares at 23,300 won apiece, a 2.5 percent discount to
yesterday’s closing price.  To contact the reporter on this story:
