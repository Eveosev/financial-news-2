U.K. stocks  rose, with the FTSE 100
Index climbing for a second week, as lenders rallied after the
 Bank of England  unveiled measures to combat an escalation of the
euro area’s debt crisis.  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS)  and  Lloyds Banking Group
Plc (LLOY)  both jumped more than 4 percent as Bank of England Governor
 Mervyn King  said they will provide billions of pounds of cheap
emergency aid to the industry. Mining companies also advanced
amid optimism that central banks around the world will take
coordinated action to support growth.  The FTSE 100 rose 0.2 percent to 5,478.81 at the close in
London, extending its weekly advance to 0.8 percent. Gains were
limited today as investors awaited the outcome of this weekend’s
elections in Greece. The broader FTSE All-Share Index gained 0.4
percent and Ireland’s ISEQ Index rose 2.2 percent.  “Given there is so much uncertainty, markets do like the
idea of any sort of decisive action by policy makers, let alone
anything that is stimulative,” said  Richard Hunter , head of
equities at Hargreaves Lansdown Plc in London. “As a result,
banks have been marked higher.”  U.K. stocks declined yesterday as  Spain’s borrowing costs 
surged to a euro-era record after Moody’s Investors Service
downgraded the nation’s credit rating. The  FTSE 100 (UKX)  has  dropped
8.2 percent  from its 2012 high in March.  Almost 10 million Greeks will vote on June 17. The
country’s president called the poll after the previous election
on May 6 failed to produce a coalition of parties capable of
forming a majority government.  U.K. Lenders Surge  A gauge of U.K. banks  rallied to a one-month high after the
BOE unveiled a “funding-for-lending” program that will allow
lenders to swap assets with the central bank in return for money
they can loan to companies and households. The U.K. Treasury
said a 5 percent increase in lending would inject about 80
billion pounds ($125 billion) into the economy.  The BOE will also activate an unused facility to put at
least 5 billion pounds a month into the financial system to
bring down borrowing costs.  RBS surged 7.9 percent to 247.6 pence, Lloyds added 5.2
percent to 31.3 pence and  Barclays Plc (BARC)  advanced 4.2 percent to
200.8 pence.  Mining companies climbed with base metal prices as central
banks from the U.K. to Japan and Canada increased their warnings
about the threat to world financial markets should the euro area
fail to contain its debt crisis. They spoke as Group of 20
leaders prepare to meet in  Mexico  next week amid the weakest
international economy since 2009.  Coordinated Stimulus  Reuters reported that central banks are preparing for
coordinated action to provide liquidity if needed after Greece’s

gained 1.3 percent to 1,800 pence. Rio Tinto Group,  the third
largest , added 2.4 percent to 2,935 pence and Vedanta Resources
Plc increased 6.3 percent  to 960 pence.  Taylor Wimpey Plc (TW/)  led housebuilders higher, climbing 3.9
percent to 46.16 pence.  Persimmon Plc (PSN)  advanced 2.2 percent to
580 pence and  Barratt Developments Plc (BDEV)  surged 6 percent to 133.4
pence.  U.K. house prices rose the most in nine months in May,
according to Acadametrics Ltd. The average price in England and
 Wales  climbed 0.5 percent to 223,207 pounds from April,
Acadametrics and LSL Property Services Plc said in a report in
London today. From a year earlier, values gained 1.9 percent.  Premier Foods Plc (PFD)  surged 9.4 percent to 87.5 pence after
the maker of Oxo cubes and Ambrosia custard agreed to sell its
pickles unit for 41 million pounds to help pay down debt.  Aggreko Plc (AGK)  dropped 4.4 percent to 2,066 pence after the
world’s largest supplier of mobile power supplies said first-
