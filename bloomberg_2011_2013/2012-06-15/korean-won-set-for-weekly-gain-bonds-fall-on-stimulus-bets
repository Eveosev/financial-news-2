South Korea ’s won had its biggest
weekly gain since March and  government bonds  fell as reports
fueled speculation central banks worldwide will take steps to
combat a global economic slump.  Bank of England Governor Mervyn King said yesterday that
the case for more stimulus in the U.K. “is growing.” U.S.
reports showed jobless claims unexpectedly climbed last week and
consumer prices dropped by the most in more than three years,
giving the Federal Reserve room for more monetary stimulus
before a policy meeting next week. Spain sought a 100 billion
euro ($126 billion) bailout for its banks last weekend and
Greece will hold a June 17 election that may determine whether
it remains in the euro. Leaders from the Group of 20 nations
will meet June 18-19 to discuss  Europe ’s debt crisis.  The won gained 0.8 percent this week to 1,165.75 per dollar
at the close in Seoul, the biggest gain since the five days
ended Mar. 2, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
currency rose 0.2 percent today and touched 1,161.28 earlier,
the strongest since May 22.  “The currency strengthened earlier on bets the Fed may
provide more monetary stimulus, but closed little changed as
importers bought the dollar and investors covered their short
positions ahead of the Greek election,” said Cho Young Bok, a
Seoul-based currency trader at Daegu Bank. A short position is a
bet an asset will decline in value.  The currency’s one-month implied volatility, a measure of
exchange-rate swings used to price options, dropped 32 basis
points, or 0.32 percentage point, this week to 10.22 percent.  Bonds Fall  Federal  Reserve Bank  of Chicago President  Charles Evans 
said on June 12 that he would support measures to generate
faster job growth in the world’s largest economy. The  Kospi (KOSPI) 
Index rose 1.2 percent this week as overseas funds bought $360
million more of the nation’s shares than they sold in the last
four days.  The yield on the government’s 3.5 percent bonds due March
2017 climbed five basis points this week to 3.40 percent, Korea
