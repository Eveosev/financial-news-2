Vietnam  will accelerate spending and
boost bank lending to bolster an economy which grew at the
weakest pace since 2009. Stocks climbed amid optimism the
measures will lift corporate earnings.  The government expects to boost disbursement to 21 trillion
dong ($1 billion) a month for the rest of the year, with funds
from the state budget as well as loans and grants from
multilateral agencies such as the  World Bank  and donor nations,
Nguyen Xuan Phuc, deputy prime minister, told the National
Assembly today in Hanoi.  The measures “will help increase market demand, reduce
companies’ stockpiles and sufficiently help businesses and
bolster the economy,” Phuc said. The government’s full-year
credit-growth target is 12 percent to 13 percent, he said.  The Ho Chi Minh City Stock Exchange’s  VN Index (VNINDEX)  rose 1.8
percent to 432.87 at 1:23 p.m.  Bao Viet Holdings (BVH) , the country’s
largest listed insurer, climbed 3.5 percent to 50,000 dong,
heading for the biggest advance since June 7.  Joint-Stock
Commercial Bank for Foreign Trade of Vietnam  or Vietcombank, the
biggest listed lender by market value, climbed 3.8 percent to
30,300 dong.  Gross domestic product expanded 4 percent in the first
quarter, the weakest pace since 2009. Vietnam’s  economy  may
expand 4.31 percent in the first half of the year, Phuc said.
Growth may be as low as 5.2 percent in 2012, Deputy Minister of
Planning & Investment Cao Viet Sinh, said in an interview on
June 5, which would be the slowest pace in more than a decade.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
