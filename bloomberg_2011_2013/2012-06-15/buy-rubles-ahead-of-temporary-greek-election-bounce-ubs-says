Investors should buy rubles against
the dollar to profit from a temporary bounce in risk assets
after Greek elections on June 17, according to UBS AG.  Buying the ruble at 32.40 to the dollar provides a
potential 4.5 percent gain,  Bhanu Baweja , emerging-market
strategist at UBS in  London , wrote in an e-mail to clients.
Investors should abandon the trade if the ruble weakens to
33.05, he said.  Riskier currencies may bounce if Greek parties supporting a
European bailout win the election, Baweja said. If they don’t,
higher yielding assets can still rise as global policy makers
may be forced to support markets, he said. Any surge in riskier
assets will prove temporary, due to the euro zone’s structural
problems, and a lack of sufficient policy response to weakening
growth in the U.S. and  China , Baweja said.  “This long risk recommendation is really just a tactical
play that investors may or may not choose to participate in,”
he said. “We have very little confidence in growth improving
over the medium term.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
