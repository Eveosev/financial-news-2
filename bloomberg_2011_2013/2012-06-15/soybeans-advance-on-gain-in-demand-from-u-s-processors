Soybeans rose for the first time in
three days in  Chicago  on signs of stronger demand for supplies
from domestic processors in the U.S., the world’s biggest
grower, and from buyers overseas.  U.S. processors crushed 138.3 million bushels of soybeans
in May, up 5 percent from April and 15 percent more than a  year 
earlier, the Washington-based National Oilseed Processors
Association said yesterday. U.S. export sales totaled about 1
million metric tons of soybeans in the week ended June 7, double
the prior week, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said.  “The situation is still looking very tight,” Erin FitzPatrick, an analyst at Rabobank International, said by phone
from London. “There is a tight U.S. balance sheet, and we don’t
have a major harvest coming on line until 2013, except for the
U.S.”  November-delivery soybeans advanced 0.6 percent to $13.17 a
bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade by 1:16 p.m. London time.
Prices are down 1.2 percent this week on speculation that rains
in parts of the U.S. Midwest will aid crop prospects.  U.S. soybean reserves will drop to 140 million bushels on
Aug. 31, 2013, down 20 percent from 175 million at the end of
the current marketing year, the USDA said June 12. Soybean
futures have climbed 8.9 percent this year as dry weather cut
production in  South America , spurring leading global importer
 China  to buy more U.S. supplies.  “The export-sales data is bullish,”  Hiroyuki Kikukawa ,
general manager for IDO Securities Co. in  Tokyo , said by e-mail
today. “Supply is fundamentally tight.”  Corn for December delivery was little changed at $5.1575 a
bushel. The contract is headed for a 5.2 percent loss this week.
Wheat for December delivery slipped 0.2 percent to $6.65 a
bushel, leaving the contract set for a 1.2 percent weekly drop.  U.S. export sales of corn for delivery this marketing year
and next tumbled 57 percent to 169,784 tons in the week of June
7 from the prior period, the USDA said. Wheat sales totaled
432,871 tons, less than a third of the previous week’s amount.  In Paris, November-delivery milling wheat fell 0.5 percent
to 205 euros ($258.48) a ton on NYSE Liffe.  To contact the reporter on this story:
