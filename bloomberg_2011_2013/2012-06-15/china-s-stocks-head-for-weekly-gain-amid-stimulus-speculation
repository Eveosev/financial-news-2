China’s stocks  rose, capping a
weekly gain, on speculation the government will ease monetary
policy and global central banks will take action to bolster
economies amid Europe’s sovereign debt crisis.  Industrial Bank Co. and Huaxia Bank Co. jumped more than 3
percent on the prospect the central bank will cut lenders’
reserve-requirement ratios for a fourth time since November.
 Jiangxi Copper Co. (600362)  led gains among commodity producers as metal
and oil prices increased. China Vanke Co. paced declines for
developers on speculation this week’s rally was excessive.  “The market perceives a reserve-requirement ratio cut is
likely given the weak momentum of the economy,” Dai Ming, a
 fund manager  at Shanghai Kingsun Investment Management &
Consulting Co., said by phone. “Banking stocks are pretty cheap
and there’s no room for their stocks to drop further.”  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  rose 10.9 points, or 0.5
percent, to 2,306.85 at the close, capping a 1.1 percent gain
this week. The  CSI 300 Index (SHSZ300)  added 0.3 percent to 2,568.05
today. The  Bloomberg China-US 55 Index (CH55BN) , the measure of the most-
traded U.S.-listed Chinese companies, slid 0.5 percent in  New
York  yesterday.  Speculation the government will boost infrastructure
spending and ease monetary policy have pushed the Shanghai index
up 4.9 percent in 2012 after two years of declines. The central
bank reduced deposit and lending rates for the first time since
2008 last week. Stocks in the measure are valued at 10 times
estimated earnings, compared with the five-year average of 17.8,
weekly  data  compiled by Bloomberg.  RRR Cut  China can further cut its reserve ratio as M2 growth is
“relatively slow” this year, according to a report by
researchers at the  Chinese Academy of Social Sciences  published
in the People’s Daily. Allowing banks to set aside less cash as
reserves may encourage them to lend money to cash-strapped
smaller companies.  Industrial Bank, part-owned by a unit of HSBC Holdings Plc,
jumped 4.1 percent to 12.95  yuan . Huaxia Bank, partly owned by
Deutsche Bank AG, added 3.6 percent to 9.50 yuan.  Industrial &
Commercial Bank of China Ltd. , the nation’s biggest listed
lender, rose 0.8 percent to 3.98 yuan.  The 16 banks trading on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock
exchanges trade at an average of 1.1 times their book value,
compared with the multiple of 1.74 for the Shanghai Composite,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Thirty-day  volatility  in the Shanghai index was at 15.55
today, compared with this year’s average of 18.53. About 7.2
billion shares changed hands in the gauge yesterday, 18 percent
lower than the daily average this year.  Global Stimulus  Monetary policy makers from the U.K. to Japan and Canada
stepped up warnings about the threat to world financial markets
should  Europe  fail to contain its debt crisis.  Bank of England 
Governor  Mervyn King  said the central bank will activate a
sterling liquidity facility to aid banks, and plans to have a
form of credit easing operating to boost lending as the case for
looser policy “is growing.”  Greece will hold general elections on June 17, which may
determine if the nation upholds austerity conditions attached to
international aid, and could lead to the first ouster from the
euro area. Almost 10 million Greeks will vote for the second
time in six weeks after a May 6 ballot failed to yield a
government.  Europe is China’s biggest export market, making up about 18
percent of the nation’s overseas sales, according to Shenyin &
Wanguo Securities Co.  Jiangxi Copper, China’s biggest producer of the metal,
gained 1.2 percent to 24.97 yuan.  Tongling Nonferrous Metals
Group Co. (000630) , the second largest, added 1.5 percent to 21.20 yuan.
Zhuzhou Smelter Group Co., the nation’s biggest producer of
refined zinc, climbed 2.3 percent to 11.11 yuan. Copper prices
advanced 0.8 percent, while oil rose 0.9 percent in New York.  Developers Decline  Threadneedle Investments is buying shares of consumer-
discretionary companies and property developers because growth
is picking up and the central bank may reduce reserve ratios,
Gigi Chan, a fund manager at the company, which has $123.1
billion in assets under management, said in an interview in
Singapore yesterday.  A measure tracking developers on the Shanghai Composite
dropped 1 percent today, paring this week’s gain to 3.6 percent.
Developers jumped after the central bank cut  interest rates  for
the first time since 2008 last week.  Vanke, the nation’s biggest listed property developer, fell
1.8 percent to 9.11 yuan. Poly Real Estate Group Co., the second
largest, slid 2.3 percent to 14.37 yuan.  China Merchants
Property Development Co. (000024)  lost 3.9 percent to 24.97 yuan.  Yili Plunges  Inner Mongolia Yili Industrial Group Co., China’s biggest
dairy producer by sales, tumbled by the 10 percent daily limit
to 21.85 yuan after saying it recalled some of its products.
Mercury can damage the central nervous system and the lungs or
cause  birth defects , with children especially vulnerable.  Chinese Internet stocks fell in New York, led by  Youku
Inc. (YOKU) ’s first decline in two weeks, as  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN)  and
Deutsche Bank AG reduced their growth forecast for Asia’s
largest economy. The iShares FTSE  China 25 Index Fund (FXI) , the
biggest U.S.-listed China exchange-traded fund, rose 0.2 percent
to $33.75 yesterday.  --Zhang Shidong. Editors: Allen Wan, Chan Tien Hin  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
