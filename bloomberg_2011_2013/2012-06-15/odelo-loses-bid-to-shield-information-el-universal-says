Grupo Modelo SAB (GMODELOC) , Mexico’s largest
brewer, lost a bid for a court order that would have allowed it
to shield information requested by antitrust regulators, El
Universal columnist Alberto Aguilar  wrote today , without saying
how he obtained the information.  Officials at the court in Mexico City declined to comment
on the case by telephone. Jennifer Shelley, a spokeswoman for
Grupo Modelo, declined to comment. The country’s antitrust
agency is investigating the beer market after a 2010 complaint
by  SABMiller Plc (SAB)  that said Modelo and  Heineken NV (HEIA)  unfairly limit
competition.  To contact the reporter on this story:
