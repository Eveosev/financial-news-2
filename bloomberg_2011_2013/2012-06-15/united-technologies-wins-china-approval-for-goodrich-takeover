United Technologies Corp. (UTX)  won
Chinese regulatory approval for its $16.5 billion acquisition of
Goodrich Corp., pending the sale of units making electrical
parts for planes.  The maker of Sikorsky helicopters and Pratt & Whitney jet
engines would have to shed operations in England and Ohio, as
well as a stake in Aerolec, a venture with  Thales SA (HO) , Chinaâ€™s
commerce ministry said in a  statement  on its website today.
United Technologies will have at least six months to sell the
units, the ministry said.  Hartford, Connecticut-based United Technologies also this
week offered unidentified concessions to European Union
regulators to ease approval for the deal, as it seeks to add a
maker of aircraft landing gear and jet-turbine casings. The
acquisition should close next month, Chief Financial Officer
Greg Hayes said yesterday at a conference in  Chicago .  --Alexandra Ho. Editors: Neil Denslow, Dave McCombs  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
