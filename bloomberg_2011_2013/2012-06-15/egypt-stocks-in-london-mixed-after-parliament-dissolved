Egyptian stocks listed in  London 
were mixed after Egypt’s highest court ordered parliament
dissolved and cleared the way for Ahmed Shafik, ousted President
Hosni Mubarak’s last premier, to run for the presidency in
tomorrow’s election.  Global depositary receipts of  Commercial International Bank
Egypt SAE (CBKD)  gained 3.3 percent to $4.08.  Orascom Telecom Holding
SAE (OTLD)  fell 1.3 percent to $2.34.  Orascom Construction Industries (ORSD) 
gained 0.7 percent to $39.53.  Egypt’s dollar bond due in 2020 rose, with the yield
falling two basis points to 7.0 percent.  The twin rulings issued yesterday by the constitutional
court strained the country’s transition and unraveled gains by
the Muslim Brotherhood, whose political arm held the largest
bloc of seats in parliament’s lower house.  -- Editors:  Chris Peterson , Thomas Mulier  To contact the reporters on this story:
