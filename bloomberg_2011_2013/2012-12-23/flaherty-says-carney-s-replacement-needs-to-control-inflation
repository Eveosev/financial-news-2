Canadian Finance Minister  Jim Flaherty  said it’s important that the next governor of the Bank
of Canada maintain “solid monetary policy” and control
inflation.  “Inflation is very dangerous,” Flaherty said in an
interview today with the CTV television network’s “Question
Period” program. “The Americans are printing a lot of money,
so are others around the world, so we have to watch that we
never go back to the ’70s and ’80s where inflation got out of
control in Canada.”  Governor  Mark Carney , who has kept the key lending rate at
1 percent for more than two years, will leave the central bank
June 1 to take the same job with the  Bank of England . Flaherty
has “a lot of respect” for  Bank of Canada  Senior Deputy Governor
Tiff Macklem, a possible front-runner to succeed Carney, he said
Dec. 5.  “Continuity matters,” Flaherty said. “But what really
matters is to have a person who will maintain solid monetary
policy and control inflation.”  Flaherty also said he doesn’t expect additional steps will
be needed to cool the Canadian housing market in 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
