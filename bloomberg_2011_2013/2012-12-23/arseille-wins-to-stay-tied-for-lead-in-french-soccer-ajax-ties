Marseille beat Saint Etienne 1-0
yesterday to move level on points atop  France ’s Ligue 1 as many
of Europe’s top soccer leagues entered mid-season breaks. Ajax
slipped three points behind the leaders in the Netherlands.  Paris Saint-Germain, Lyon and Marseille all have 38 points
following wins this weekend. Andre Ayew scored for Marseille as
it recorded a 12th victory in 19 matches.  PSG, top on goal difference, won 3-0 at Brest on Dec. 21,
while Lyon beat Nice 3-0 two days ago. Fourth-place Rennes is
six points back after a 4-2 victory at Ajaccio.  Defending champion Montpellier lost 4-2 against Lille and
sits in 11th position.  Ajax was held to a 0-0 tie at Utrecht yesterday and is now
tied on 37 points with Feyenoord, a 2-1 winner against Groningen,
three points behind Eredivisie leaders  PSV Eindhoven  and  FC
Twente .  PSV thrashed NAC Breda 6-1 two days ago, and Twente won 3-0
at  AZ Alkmaar  on Dec. 21.  In La Liga, Barcelona takes a nine-point lead into the
winter break, with archrival Real Madrid 16 points adrift in
third spot.  Lionel Messi  got his competition-leading 26th goal in
Barcelona’s 3-1 win at Valladolid two days ago, with second-
place  Atletico Madrid  a 1-0 winner against Celta Vigo on Dec. 21.  Real Madrid slumped to a 3-2 defeat at Malaga. Coach Jose Mourinho dropped Spain goalkeeper Iker Casillas for the match
against a team that is now two points back in fourth position.  Lazio moved second in  Italy ’s Serie A following a 1-0 win
at Sampdoria two days ago, as Inter Milan was held to a 1-1 tie
by Genoa.  Juventus, a 3-1 winner at Cagliari on Dec. 21 with two
injury-time goals, tops the standings on 44 points, Lazio has 36,
with  Inter Milan  and Fiorentina on 35. Fiorentina defeated
Palermo 3-0.  Among other matches, Roma beat AC Milan 4-2 and Napoli
defeated last-place Siena 2-0.  The Bundesliga was already on its mid-season break, with no
matches scheduled until the weekend of Jan 19-20, when Dutch
league games also resume. Serie A and La Liga return two weeks
earlier, with Ligue 1 games scheduled to restart from Jan. 11.  To contact the reporter on this story:
