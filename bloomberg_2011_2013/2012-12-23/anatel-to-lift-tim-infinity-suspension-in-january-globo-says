Brazilian regulator Anatel will lift
suspensions on unlimited calling plans such as  Tim Participacoes
SA (TIMP3) ’s Infinity Day starting in January, O Globo reported, citing
an interview given by Anatel superintendent Bruno Ramos to G1.  Anatel ordered Tim to suspend the Infinity Day plan in
November over service-quality concerns, O Globo said. Rivals  Oi
SA (OIBR4)  and  America Movil SAB (AMXL) , owner of Claro, will be free to start
similar plans after the regulator’s concerns also prevented
those programs from being activated in November, O Globo cited
Ramos as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
