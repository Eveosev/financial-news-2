The Denver Nuggets won 110-88 to
hand the Charlotte Bobcats their 15th consecutive National
Basketball Association loss.  Kosta Koufos scored 16 points and Kenneth Faried and Andre Iquodala each added 15 points for the Nuggets on their home
court last night at Pepsi Center.  Denver improved to 15-13 to hold third place in the five-
team Western Conference’s Northwest Division, seven games behind
the Oklahoma City Thunder.  The Bobcats, who fell to 7-20, are in fourth place in the
five-team  Southeast Division  of the Eastern Conference.
Charlotte is 12 ½ games behind the  Miami Heat  and three games
ahead of the  Washington Wizards  (3-22) who have lost seven
straight.  Charlotte hasn’t won a game since Nov. 24 when the Bobcats
defeated the Wizards 108-106 in double overtime.  Ramon Sessions led the Bobcats with 23 points and Byron Mullens added 16 points and 14 rebounds.  The Bobcats had 13 turnovers that were converted into 22
