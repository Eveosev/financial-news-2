Matt Ryan  threw four touchdown
passes as the  Atlanta Falcons  defeated the Detroit Lions 31-18
to clinch the No. 1 seed and home-field advantage through the
National Football Conference playoffs.  Lions receiver  Calvin Johnson , who caught 11 passes from
quarterback Matt Stafford for 225 yards last night, surpassed
 Jerry Rice ’s National Football League single-season record for
yards receiving of 1,848. His three receptions for 70 yards in
the first quarter broke Herman Moore’s single-season franchise
record for yards receiving.  “When Matt and I are on the field together, some special
things can happen,” Johnson told reporters after the game. “We
said before the game that we wanted to try to get it tonight.”  Johnson broke Hall of Fame wide receiver Rice’s 17-year
mark set in 1995 and ended the game with 1,892 yards. The new
record was set on his 10th reception of the game that went for 26
yards with three minutes, five seconds left in the fourth
quarter. He is now 108 yards shy of becoming the first player in
NFL history to register 2,000 receiving yards in a season, the
Lions said.  Johnson also became the first player with 100 yards
receiving in eight straight games and the first with 10
receptions in four games in a row.  Ryan completed 25 of 32 passing attempts for 279 yards for
the Falcons, who improved to 13-2 last night at Ford Field in
 Detroit .  Ryan connected with Roddy White twice on 44 and 39-yard
scoring passes and Julio Jones had a 16-yard reception to give
the Falcons a 21-6 halftime advantage. Jason Hanson kicked field
goals of 34 and 38 yards for the Lions, who lost their seventh
straight game to fall to 4-11.  The Lions came within five points after Mikel Leshoure’s
one-yard scoring run in the third quarter and Hanson’s 20-yard
field goal at 1:32 of the fourth quarter.  Ryan connected with Michael Palmer and Matt Bryant kicked a
20-yard field goal to secure the victory for the Falcons.  The Lions earned a safety with just over a minute to play
when Kyle Vanden Bosch tackled  Michael Turner  in the end zone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
