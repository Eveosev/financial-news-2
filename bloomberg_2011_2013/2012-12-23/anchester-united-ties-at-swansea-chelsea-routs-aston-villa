Manchester United was held to a 1-1
tie at Swansea City, ending a run of five straight wins in
English soccer’s Premier League as it failed to restore a six-
point lead. Chelsea routed Aston Villa 8-0 to move into third.  France fullback Patrice Evra put United ahead on 16 minutes
today, with Michu replying after 29 minutes at Swansea’s Liberty
Stadium. Ramires got two of Chelsea’s goals, half of which were
scored by Brazilians.  “We’ve thrown two points away really,” United manager
Alex Ferguson told Sky Sports. “We absolutely battered them. It
was a great performance in the second half. It is unbelievable
we didn’t win the match.”  United tops the standings on 43 points after its first
league draw of the season, four points ahead of second-place
Manchester City. Chelsea, which has played one less match, has
32 points, with four teams a further two points back.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
