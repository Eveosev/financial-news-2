Air Arabia PJSC (AIRARABI)  rallied to a 21-
month high on bets the  Middle East ’s biggest no-frills airline
will boost its dividend payment as profit jumps.  The shares advanced 2.7 percent to 80.2 fils, the highest
level since March 2011, extending their seven-day gain to 9.1
percent. The stock was the  second-most  traded by volume on the
benchmark  DFM General Index (DFMGI) , which rose 0.4 percent. The shares
trade at a gross dividend yield of 7.5 percent, compared with
3.9 percent for the benchmark measure, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  Air Arabia’s 2012  profit may jump 44 percent  to 387 million
dirhams ($105 million), according to the average estimate of
eight analysts on Bloomberg. The Sharjah-based airline last paid
a  cash dividend of 0.06 dirham  a share for 2011, when profit
dropped 12 percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  “Investors are positioning themselves in anticipation of
the dividends for 2012,” said Samer Darwiche , Dubai-based
analyst at Gulfmena Investments Ltd. “The company had good
operational results in 2012 and now approaching year end,
investors are betting on a dividend yield of 9 percent to 10
percent.”  Eight analysts recommend investors buy Air Arabia shares,
while four have a hold recommendation on the stock and one
advises selling it, according to  data compiled by Bloomberg . Air
Arabia’s 14-day relative strength index rose to 85 today. A

poised to decline.  To contact the reporter on this story:
