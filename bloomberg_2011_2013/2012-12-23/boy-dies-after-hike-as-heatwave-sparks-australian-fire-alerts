A 14-year Scottish boy died after a
bushwalk in  Australia ’s remote northwest, as a heatwave brought
temperatures as high as 44 degrees Celsius (111 degrees
Fahrenheit) and prompted fire warnings in four states.  The boy collapsed after becoming dehydrated on a walk with
his father in the Cape Range National Park, close to the Pilbara
iron-ore mining region in Western Australia state, according to
an e-mailed statement from police spokeswoman Ros Weatherall. He
later died in Exmouth Hospital, according to the statement.  Australia’s Bureau of Meteorology said there was an
 “extreme” risk of fire  in the area today due to gusty winds
and temperatures forecast to hit  44 degrees  Celsius. Alerts of
extreme fire risk were also issued across South Australia state,
while lower-grade  warnings  were put out for New South Wales and
Victoria states, where the country’s second-largest city
 Melbourne  is  forecast  to see a high temperature of 39 degrees
Celsius.  Residents of a swathe of northern and western Victoria were
 banned  from lighting barbecues or campfires and advised against
driving through vegetation to avoid sparking fires.  Australia’s hot, dry climate makes bushfires a major risk
in the southern summer months. The worst fires in the country’s
history, the so-called Black Saturday blazes,  killed 173 people 
as they swept through rural Victoria on Feb. 7, 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
