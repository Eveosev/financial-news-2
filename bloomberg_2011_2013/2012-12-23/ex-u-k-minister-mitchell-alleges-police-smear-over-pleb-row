Andrew Mitchell , former Chief Whip
of the U.K.’s ruling  Conservative Party , said that elements
within London’s Metropolitan Police conducted a “smear
campaign” against him that led to his resignation.  Mitchell quit his government role in October after the Sun
newspaper reported he abused police guards, calling them
“plebs” when they refused to let him cycle through the main
gate of Downing Street. Writing in the Sunday Times today,
Mitchell said he never used the term and that he told Prime
Minister  David Cameron  that he had not used the “awful toxic
language” attributed to him.  “Suddenly I realised I was being stitched up,” he wrote.
“I knew it was false but I didn’t know what to do.”  Two people were arrested last week in an investigation of
the matter by the police. A  report by Channel 4 News  on Dec. 18
said a police officer had posed as a member of the public and
falsely claimed to have witnessed the events in an e-mail to his
lawmaker.  The sender of the e-mail “is a serving police officer and
member of the diplomatic protection squad,” Mitchell said
today. Some members of the police force have conducted “a smear
campaign against me in pursuit of their own particular agenda,”
he said.  Metropolitan Police Commissioner Bernard Hogan-Howe,
Britain’s most senior police officer, has curtailed his
Christmas break to return to London, the Sunday Times reported,
without saying where it got the information.  To contact the reporters on this story:
