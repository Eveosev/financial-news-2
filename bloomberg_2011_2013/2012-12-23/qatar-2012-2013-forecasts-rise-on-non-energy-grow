Qatar, the world’s biggest liquefied
natural gas exporter, has raised its forecasts for economic
growth this year and in 2013 as non-energy industries expand.  The nation’s real gross domestic product will increase 6.3
percent in 2012, compared with a previous forecast of 6.2
percent, while economic growth in 2013 may rise to 4.8 percent
compared with an estimate of 4.5 percent in June, the General
Secretariat for Development Planning said in a statement today.  Half of Qatar’s economy will be based on petroleum
production next year, the government said. The country’s
economic growth was the fastest in the world in 2011 and 2010,
according to the  International Monetary Fund . The expansion was
driven by the completion of 14 gas liquefaction plants, raising
exports of the fuel. No further plants are planned amid a
moratorium on development of the North Field, the world’s
largest gas reservoir.  Construction will pick up as infrastructure projects begin
to take effect after delays “and we are also expecting growth
in high value-added services such as financial services,
transportation and communication,” Frank Harrigan, director of
the department of economic development at the planning body,
told reporters today. “All of the growth will come from non-oil
and gas” until about 2015, when a natural gas project called
Barzan begins operation, he said.  ‘Robust’ Growth  Qatar’s economic expansion is based on “robust” growth in
the non-oil and gas industries, the government body said. The
government forecasts 9.3 percent expansion in those industries
this year, and 9.6 percent in 2013. The government revised its
2012 nominal GDP, which reflects the cost of oil, to 14.7
percent from 11.2 percent amid higher-than-forecast crude
prices. The country’s 2012 fiscal surplus is estimated at 7.9
percent of GDP, and 5.3 percent of GDP in 2013, the planners
said.  Qatar, which is hosting the 2022 soccer  World Cup , plans to
spend $138 billion on infrastructure from 2011 to 2016, greater
than 10 percent of GDP through 2016, the government said today.
The spending amounts to a 42 percent increase from what was
projected by the planners in 2010. The country is building a $35
billion rail and metro network, new highways, sports stadiums,
an international port and an international airport.  Infrastructure ‘Challenges’  The planning department reported “challenges to ensuring
delivery” of infrastructure projects amid rising costs and
planning delays caused by the large volume of projects during
the next decade.  Risks to economic expansion are “mainly external”
including the debt crises afflicting countries in the euro area
and “geopolitical developments” that threaten shipping of oil
and gas, the government said. At the start of this year,  Iran 
threatened to shut the  Strait of Hormuz , through which Qatar
exports all its gas. The planners warn that “demand and
supply” fundamentals suggest “downside risks” for  oil prices .  Still, Qatar’s exposure to the euro-area crisis is
“limited and contained,” Harrigan said. Crude oil would have
to fall below $50 per barrel “to shift the projected fiscal
surplus for 2013 to deficit,” the planners said in the report.  To contact the reporters on this story:
