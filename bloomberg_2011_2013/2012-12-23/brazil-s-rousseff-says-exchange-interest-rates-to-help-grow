Brazil can grow in a more
sustainable way, due to more realistic exchange rates, together
with lower taxes and  interest rates , President  Dilma Rousseff 
said yesterday.  Policy makers will continue to work to drive down taxes
next year, Rousseff said at an event in the southern state of
Rio Grande do Sul. Brazil is working to eliminate infrastructure
and logistics bottlenecks, Rousseff added.  A copy of the speech was provided by Rousseff’s press
office.  To contact the reporter on this story:
