The European Union should provide a
“safe haven” in all member states for Syrian refugees to
ensure they don’t face detention and deportation in countries
such as  Greece ,  Human Rights Watch  said.  Easing access by simplifying visa procedures and providing
temporary residence permits to Syrians throughout the EU would
reduce the burden on  Syria ’s other neighbors, where more than
500,000 Syrians have fled, the New York-based organization said
in a  statement  today.  Greece, the main E.U. point of entry for undocumented
migrants, deported 44 Syrian nationals in the first 11 months of
this year and has only granted protection to six Syrians since
March 2011, Human Rights Watch said. Some 9,000 Syrians have
been apprehended in Greece since the beginning of last year, the
organization said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
