French Prime Minister Jean-Marc
Ayrault said President  Francois Hollande ’s socialist government
is implementing  Europe ’s most leftist agenda,  Journal du
Dimanche  quoted him as saying today.  ’’We run Europe’s most left-wing policies,’’ JDD cited
Ayrault as saying. “It’s true. We must accept it. I am not a
social-liberal.” The newspaper did not say which policies
Ayrault was referring to.  The Prime Minister, one of the least popular in France’s
modern history, told JDD he will revamp his communications
strategy next year to explain how he wants to create a “new
French model.”  The government, composed of Socialist and Green party
members, has increased school staff to bolster education and
implemented a 75 percent tax on millionaires as well as pledged
to protect  France ’s welfare system. In his 2013 budget law,
Ayrault plans to add 10 billion euros ($13.2 billions) worth of
taxes on private people and as much for companies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
