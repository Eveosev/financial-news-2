North Korea ’s rocket launch earlier
this month was a possible test of technology for an
intercontinental ballistic missile,  South Korea ’s Defense
Ministry said after analyzing debris from the rocket.  “North Korea’s long-range missile used existing missile
technologies,” the  ministry  said in a statement on a government
briefing website today. North Korea “used red-fuming nitric
acid as an oxidizer unlike other space rockets using liquid
oxygen.” The rocket is estimated to have a range of more than
10,000 kilometers (6,200 miles), according to the website.  North Korea launched the rocket on Dec. 12, saying it
successfully placed a satellite into orbit, in defiance of
international sanctions and showcasing the nuclear-armed
totalitarian regime’s progress in ballistic missile technology.  South Korean military officials recovered part of the
rocket debris in waters off the west of the country and analyzed
it from Dec. 14 to Dec. 18 with 42 experts involved, according
to today’s statement.  Red-fuming nitric acid was used for Nodong and Scud
missiles by the former  Soviet Union , and it can be stored in
normal temperature and is very toxic, the  Defense Ministry  said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
