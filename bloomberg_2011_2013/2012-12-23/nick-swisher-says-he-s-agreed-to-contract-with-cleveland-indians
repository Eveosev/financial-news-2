Nick Swisher has agreed to join the
 Cleveland  Indians.  “Hey Cleveland, are you ready? Because I’m coming home,”
Swisher posted on his Twitter account today.  The 32-year-old outfielder, who spent the past four Major
League Baseball seasons with the  New York  Yankees, has agreed to
a four-year contract worth $56 million, making him the biggest
free-agent signing in Indians history,  MLB.com reported . Swisher
also has a $14 million option for 2017, it said.  Cleveland hired Terry Francona as manager after finishing
fourth in the five-team American League Central Division
following a 94-loss season. Francona led the Boston Red Sox to a
World Series title in 2004, breaking the team’s 86-year
championship drought, and again in 2007.  The deal with Swisher is pending a physical and probably
won’t be officially announced until after Dec. 25, MLB.com said.  The Indians will lose their second-round pick in next
year’s draft as compensation for Swisher and the Yankees will
get an extra selection following the first round,  ESPN said .  A switch-hitter, Swisher batted .272 with 24 home runs and
93 runs batted in last season.  “Thank you N.Y. for the kindness and support you’ve shown
me the past four years,” Swisher posted on Twitter. “It’s been
an amazing experience and I’ve loved every minute of it.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
