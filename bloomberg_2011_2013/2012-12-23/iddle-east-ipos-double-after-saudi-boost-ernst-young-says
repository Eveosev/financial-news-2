The  Middle East  and North Africa’s
pipeline of initial public offerings may be improving after
Saudi companies helped the region more than double sales this
year to $2 billion, Ernst & Young International said.  Share sales in the region gained from $844 million in 2011
“hinting that the markets are inching towards better results,”
the consultancy said in a statement today. Companies in Saudi
Arabia, the largest Arab economy, raised the most in 2012 after
seven sales valued at a combined $1.4 billion, Ernst & Young
said. United Arab Emirates companies came in second with $277
million, while Oman was third with $264.4 million, it said.  “The outlook for 2013 will be to a great extent influenced
by investor sentiments, against the backdrop of regional
developments,” Phil Gandier, head of transaction advisory
services for MENA, said in the statement. “ Saudi Arabia  and the
U.A.E. will continue to be the regional hubs of IPO activity for
investors in 2013.”  Arab uprisings that ousted leaders in  Tunisia ,  Egypt , Libya
and Yemen, as well as Europe’s debt crisis, slowed regional
share sales in the past two years. Saudi IPOs have picked up as
companies sought funds amid government plans to invest more than
$500 billion to build infrastructure, develop industry and
create jobs.  The benchmark Tadawul All Share Index advanced 7.4 percent
this year after falling 3.1 percent in 2011, while average
volumes on the exchange rose to 346 million shares from 213
million, according to  data compiled  by Bloomberg. Trading
volumes for Dubai’s benchmark index have averaged 160 million
shares this year after a two-year slump took them to 67 million
shares for 2011, the lowest since 2006.  In the fourth quarter, MENA companies raised $339.8 million
from share sales, up 50 percent from the year-earlier period and
compared with $252.3 million in the third quarter, Ernst & Young
said.  Dallah Healthcare Holding Co. (DALLAH)  raised $144 million in Saudi
Arabia, the region’s biggest IPO in the fourth quarter, while  Al
Izz Islamic Bank (BKIZ)  sold $106 million of shares and listed them on
the  Muscat Securities Market .  To contact the reporter on this story:
