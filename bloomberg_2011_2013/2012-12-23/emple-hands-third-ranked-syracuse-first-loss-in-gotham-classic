Khalif Wyatt scored a career-high 33
points as Temple University upset third-ranked Syracuse
University 83-79 for the Orange’s first loss of the college
basketball season.  In other games involving teams in the Top Five, it was No.
4  Arizona  73, East Tennessee State 53 and No. 5 Louisville 78,
Western Kentucky 55.  Wyatt was 15 for 15 from the free-throw line and hit 8 of
17 field goals, including two 3-pointers in the Chevrolet Gotham
Classic last night at Madison Square Garden in New York.  “I always wanted to play here because all the great
players had a chance to play here,” Wyatt told reporters.
“This was a chance for us to show everyone that Temple is a
real program.”  The Temple Owls shot 81 percent from the foul line against
56 percent for the Orange.  Anthony Lee had 21 points and nine rebounds for the Owls,
who improved to 9-2 after outscoring Syracuse 45-39 in the
second half to overcome a two-point halftime deficit.  “We wanted to go inside and out and that meant me going up
strong and fighting for rebounds,” Lee said. “That’s playing
the Temple game.”  C.J. Fair scored 25 points and Brandon Triche added 17 for
the Orange, who fell to 10-1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
