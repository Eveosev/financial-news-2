Raul Ibanez , who hit strategic home
runs in the  New York  Yankees’ postseason games, has agreed to
join the Seattle Mariners for the third time, MLB.com reported,
citing a person familiar with the one-year deal.  The Mariners have to make a move on the 40-man Major League
Baseball team’s roster before they can confirm the contract with
Ibanez, MLB.com said.  Ibanez, 40, played for Seattle from 1996-2000 and 2004-08.
Last season as a Yankee, he hit .240 with 19 home runs and 62
runs batted in.  Ibanez batted .318 with three home runs in the Yankees’
eight playoff games last season. In Game 3 of the American
League Division Series against the  Baltimore Orioles , he tied
the game with a solo home run in the bottom of the ninth inning,
and won it with a walk-off homer in the 12th.  Ibanez has a career batting average of .278 with 271 home
runs and 1,116 RBIs in 1,947 games over 17 years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
