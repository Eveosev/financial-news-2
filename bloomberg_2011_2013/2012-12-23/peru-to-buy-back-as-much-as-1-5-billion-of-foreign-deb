Peru  will buy back as much as $1.5
billion of foreign debt next year as part of measures to slow
the appreciation of its currency, the sol, Finance Minister
Miguel Castilla said.  The government will tap its fiscal surplus to prepay
“expensive” dollar debt, Castilla told reporters in Lima
today.  Peru’s central bank and the banking regulator will take
steps to ease pressure on the local currency, which is trading
at a 16-year high, Castilla said. The central bank has bought
$13.5 billion in the spot market, increased reserve requirements
and proposed restrictions on local banks’ dollar sales this year
to combat appreciation.  “Peru is very attractive and the capital entering the
country is mainly long term.” Castilla said. “It’s important
to mitigate the effects of this influx of capital.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
