Argentina ’s central bank President
Mercedes Marco del Pont said the bank’s ban on the acquisition
of dollars for savings hasn’t had an impact on the nation’s
economic activity and won’t be lifted, Tiempo Argentino
reported, citing an interview.  The measure has been “assimilated” much faster than
expected, Marco del Pont told the Buenos Aires-based newspaper.  Marco del Pont forecast the nation’s economy will grow 2.4
percent this year and 4.5 percent to 5 percent in 2013, the
newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
