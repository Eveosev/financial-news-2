A Shanghai-based firm has started
construction on a $1.6 billion property project in Vientiane,
the capital city of Laos, boosting Chinese presence in the
 Association of Southeast Asian Nations ’ smallest economy.  Shanghai Wanfeng Group, the closely held developer of
shopping malls in China, reached agreement with the Lao
government in December 2011 to develop 365 hectares (900 acres)
around That Luang Lake into a commercial, residential and
tourist complex. Construction began yesterday, according to the
Chinese official news agency Xinhua and the company’s website.  Chinese firms, from dam builders to mall developers are
boosting investment in Laos, a new member of the  World Trade
Organization  with an economy that’s  forecast  by the
 International Monetary Fund  to grow 8.0 percent in 2013.  China CAMC Engineering Co. (002051)  completed the first phase of a
$100 million residential project on a 1.6 kilometer (1 mile)
section of the Mekong river waterfront in time to accommodate
leaders attending the ninth Asia-Europe Meeting in November. The
Yunnan Provincial Overseas Investment Co., a Chinese government
investment arm, is developing another property project in the
city valued at $40 million.  China ’s total investment in Laos is $3.3 billion this year,
making China the third-largest foreign investor in the
landlocked nation of 6 million people, after Thailand and
Vietnam, Xinhua news agency reported citing the Ministry of
Trade.  China’s investments in ASEAN have increased 31 percent in
the first 11 months of this year, the ministry had said, without
