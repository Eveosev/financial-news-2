(Corrects spelling of Burgan Bank in headline.)  Burgan Bank SAK (BURG) , the third-biggest
Kuwaiti lender by assets, completed the purchase of 99.3 percent
of Istanbul-based Eurobank Tekfen AS amid growing interest from
Persian Gulf banks to expand operations in  Turkey .  The 627 million-lira ($349 million) deal was completed on
Dec. 21 after the Kuwait-based lender secured approval from
Turkish and local regulatory bodies, Burgan Bank said in a
statement to the Kuwait Stock Exchange today.  Persian Gulf lenders are eying opportunities to expand in
Turkey, capitalizing on European banks pressured by the debt
crisis needing to sell investments.  Qatar National Bank SAQ (QNBK) , the
Middle East’s biggest lender, may be targeting Finansbank AS,
owned by National  Bank of Greece (TELL)  SA, according to analysts.  Burgan Bank also acquired a loan portfolio from a
subsidiary of the previous owner, which was  Greece ’s  Eurobank
Ergasias SA (EUROB) , as part of the deal, according to the statement.
The portfolio included 42.3 million euros ($55.8 million) and
$79.6 million, the bank said.  Shares of Burgan Bank were unchanged at 530 fils at the
close in  Kuwait City  today after rising 1.9 percent following
the announcement. The stock is up 17 percent this year, compared
with a 2.6 percent increase in Kuwait’s  benchmark stock index .  To contact the reporter on this story:
