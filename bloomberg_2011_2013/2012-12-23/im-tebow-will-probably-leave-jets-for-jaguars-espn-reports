Tim Tebow  is almost certain to leave
the New York Jets for the Jacksonville Jaguars at the end of the
National Football League season,  ESPN reported , citing league
sources it didn’t identify.  The move will be completed after the Jets agree to the
quarterback’s expected request to be released, making him an
unrestricted free agent, the broadcaster said.  Tebow, who joined the Jets in March from the Broncos after
Peyton Manning signed with Denver, has completed six of eight
pass attempts for 39 yards this season, while rushing for 102
yards on 32 carries as part of the team’s wildcat offense. Jets
coach  Rex Ryan  opted to bench  Mark Sanchez  and start today’s
game against San Diego with  Greg McElroy  at quarterback.  The Jaguars, who play in the area of northeast Florida
where Tebow grew up, this season slumped to 1-9 behind
quarterback Blaine Gabbert, a first-round draft choice in 2011.
Since Chad Henne took over as starter after Gabbert was placed
on season-ending injured reserve with a shoulder injury, the
team has gone 1-3.  To contact the reporter on this story:
