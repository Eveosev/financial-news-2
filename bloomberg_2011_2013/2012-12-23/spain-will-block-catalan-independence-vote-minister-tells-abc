Spain ’s government will block any
independence referendum held in Catalonia, Foreign Minister Jose
Manuel Garcia-Margallo said, according to ABC.  “The government is prepared to make sure the referendum
doesn’t happen: the legal instrument it uses to do so is
secondary,” the Madrid-based newspaper quoted him as saying in
an interview. “Spaniards can be confident that it won’t
tolerate secession in any part of the territory.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
