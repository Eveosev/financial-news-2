Egypt  plans to hold an auction for
the right to use land in the  Gulf of Suez  to build wind-power
plants with the capacity to produce 600 megawatts, the
Electricity and Energy Ministry said in an e-mailed statement.  The north African country will offer investors six plots of
land, with an area of 15 square kilometers (3,707 acres) each,
the Cairo-based ministry said today, citing Electricity Minister
Mahmoud Balbaa.  Under auction rules, investors will be entitled to at least
2 percent of the power generated, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
