Egyptian stocks  fell for the first
time in four days as concern that the government will fail to
revive economic growth overshadowed initial results showing a
draft constitution won approval.  Palm Hills Developments SAE, a developer of luxury real
estate, tumbled the most since Dec. 6. Orascom Telecom Holding,
a mobile phone operator, dropped 2.1 percent.  The  EGX 30 Index (EGX30)  declined 1.5 percent to 5,362.16 at the
close in Cairo, the biggest retreat since Dec. 10. The benchmark
gauge has still advanced 48 percent this year, the sharpest
rally since 2007. Elsewhere in the Middle East, the Bloomberg
GCC 200 Index of the biggest companies in the six-nation Gulf
Cooperation Council, slipped 0.2 percent today.  “In theory, the constitution’s approval means we’re on the
road to stability,” said Ashraf Akhnoukh, Cairo-based manager
for Middle East and North Africa markets at Commercial
International Brokerage Co. “But in reality, the economy
remains a huge challenge and it’s a big question whether this
government will be able to stimulate recovery.”  Islamists who support President Mohamed Mursi said 64
percent of voters backed the charter. Still, unrest in the month
leading up to the vote had forced the government to delay a $4.8
billion International Monetary Fund loan seen crucial to revive
the economy, which U.K.-based consulting firm Maplecroft says
won’t grow enough over the next three years to prevent
unemployment from rising.  The volume of shares changing hands in Egyptian stocks was
50 percent more than the average of the last 10 days, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Plunging Reserves  Growth may average 3 percent over the next three years,
according to Maplecroft. The pound, subject to managed float, is
trading at the lowest level since 2004 as the country struggles
to stem the decline in foreign-currency reserves, which have
plunged 58 percent since last year’s uprising.  Palm Hills declined 2.8 percent to 2.45 pounds. Orascom
Telecom dropped to 3.82 pounds.  Dubai’s  DFM General Index (DFMGI)  gained 0.4 percent to 1,606.92 at
the close in the emirate, the highest since Dec. 10.  Air Arabia (AIRARABI)  rose 2.7 percent to 80.2 fils, the highest since
March 2011. The company was the  second-most traded stock  in the
index. Air Arabia’s 2012 profit may jump 44 percent to 387
million dirhams ($105 million), according to the average
estimate of eight analysts on Bloomberg.  Payout Expectation  “Investors are positioning themselves in anticipation of
the dividends for 2012,” said Samer Darwiche, Dubai-based
analyst at Gulfmena Investments Ltd.  The Sharjah-based airline last paid a cash dividend of 0.06
dirham a share for 2011, when profit dropped 12 percent, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  Abu Dhabi’s ADX General Index rose 0.5 percent, Oman’s
MSM30 Index gained 0.3 percent and Bahrain’s measure added 0.7
percent. Kuwait’s index fell 0.3 percent, Qatar’s QE Index
retreated 0.2 percent and Saudi Arabia’s Tadawul All Share Index
dropped 0.2 percent.  Israel ’s TA-25 Index declined 0.5 percent. The country’s
benchmark bonds rose, pushing the yield down two basis points to
3.74 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
