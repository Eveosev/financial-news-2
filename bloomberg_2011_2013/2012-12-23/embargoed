Russian President Vladimir Putin has
tabbed developing nuclear and arms businesses as key to a goal
of doubling trade with  India  as he visits the South Asian
nation.  Russia  seeks to reach $20 billion in  annual trade  with
India by 2015, compared with a projected $10 billion this year,
Putin said in an interview with India’s The Hindu newspaper,
coinciding with his official visit.  India, Russia’s leading arms customer, has increased
defense spending over the past decade and Putin, who returned to
the Kremlin this year, seeks to fend off growing competition
from the U.S. and  Europe  for contracts. The two countries will
consider developments in missiles, fighter jets and transport
aircraft, according to the article, distributed by the Kremlin.  Russia also expects an agreement with India for the
construction of more nuclear power plants “in the nearest
future,” Putin said in the interview. The countries plan to
start operations at the Kudankulam plant to reduce energy
deficit in southern India, he added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
