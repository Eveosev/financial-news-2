Workers and visitors at Australian
national parks in New South Wales risk being shot dead if a ban
on hunting is lifted next year, the Sun-Herald newspaper
 reported  citing a state government paper.  There is a high risk to families, hunters, parks’ workers
and people living adjacent to the sites from “projectiles
causing death and serious injury”, according to the briefing
document cited by the Sydney-based newspaper. The paper, dated
Dec. 10, was produced by the  Office of Environment and Heritage ,
which operates within New South Wales Premier Barry O’Farrell’s
office, the paper said.  O’Farrell’s government said on May 30 that 79 of the
state’s national parks would be  opened  to people hunting feral
animals such as pigs, dogs, cats and goats. The same day, the
government announced it was going ahead with plans to sell
state-owned electricity generators after  securing support  from
the Shooters and Fishers Party, which has  two seats  in the 93-
member state  legislative assembly .  The document was leaked to members of the opposition Labor
and Green parties and passed to the newspaper on Friday, the
Sun-Herald said.  Robyn Parker, the state’s environment minister, said in an
e-mailed statement to  Bloomberg News  today that the  risk
assessment  produced in the government paper was “routine
procedure” and hunters will have to pass tests and be licensed
club members before they’re allowed to shoot in the parks.  “Safety will always be paramount,” Parker said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
