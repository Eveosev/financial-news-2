paid its partners as much as 269.8 million pounds ($436 million)

paid them a year earlier, after the hedge fund’s investment
performance beat rivals.  The highest-paid partner, who wasn’t identified, got 78.9
million pounds, up from 64.8 million pounds in the year earlier,
according to a filing by the London-based fund posted Dec. 22 on
the U.K. Companies House website. Brevan Howard had 49
designated members during the period, meaning each partner
