Maria das Gracas Foster, chief
executive officer of  Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4) , said Brazilâ€™s
gasoline price increases are about 6 percent lower than
forecast, O Globo reported.  Petrobras expected prices to increase by 15 percent between
2012 and 2016, and so far, prices have risen 7.83 percent, O
Globo cited her as saying. Increasing gasoline prices as much as
possible next year would be beneficial to Petrobras, Foster told
O Globo.  Petrobras wants to retain its exploration and production
division in  Argentina  while divesting from other areas of that
country, Foster told O Globo. Petrobras also expects to take on
$18 billion in debt next year, Foster said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
