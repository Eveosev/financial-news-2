A  petition  on the White House
website seeking to extend travel restrictions to Russian
lawmakers who proposed to ban the adoption of Russian orphans in
the U.S. surpassed 25,000 signatures, triggering a review.  Russia ’s lower house of parliament, the Duma, proposed the
adoption ban in retaliation for a law approved by Congress this
month that imposes a visa ban and asset freeze on Russian
officials suspected of involvement in the death of lawyer Sergei Magnitsky and other human-rights abuses.  Magnitsky, a Russian tax attorney, died in 2009 in a Moscow
prison after saying he was abused and denied medical care to
force him to withdraw allegations of a $230 million  tax fraud  by
officials.  The web petition to U.S. President  Barack Obama ’s
administration called the Magnitsky law “a profoundly pro-
Russian step” in battling corruption and expressed outrage over
the Duma proposal, which will “jeopardize the lives and
wellbeing” of orphans.  The White House will review any petition made on its
website that gains more than 25,000 e-signatures in less than 30
days, according to the site. The petition, created on Dec. 21 by
an Alexander V, has had more than 34,000 signatures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
