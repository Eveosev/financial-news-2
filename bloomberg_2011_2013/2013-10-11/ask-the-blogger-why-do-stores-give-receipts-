Okay, so no one asked me this; I saw it on Twitter, from my friend Brian Beutler, re-tweeting Business Insider's Joe Weisenthal: "Wondered this for years. RT  @TheStalwart : Why aren’t physical receipts always opt-in?" As it happens, there’s an easy answer to this question: Because except in a few places (such as taxi cabs and hotels), the receipts aren’t mostly for you. They’re for the employer. Ask yourself: Why does Banana Republic give you a receipt? Are you going to deduct your new sweater? Charge it to your employer? Are you unaware how much you just paid three seconds ago? Are you going to go home and laboriously enter your purchases in a ledger kept for just this purpose? No, no, no and no, in most cases. So why do they give you a receipt? And it's not necessarily for returns. Instead, it's mostly so employees can’t steal. The history of the cash register is, by and large, the history of theft prevention. Oh, they were originally created as tallying machines for very high-volume businesses. But it was hard to convince businesses that they needed to spend $150 or $200 on a machine to hold cash, at a time when a good workman might earn a dollar or two a day. The great innovation of the  National Cash Register company  was to market registers not so much as adding machines but as devices for preventing theft. Here’s Walter Friedman’s " Birth of a Salesman " on how these machines were made ubiquitous: That’s why cash registers ring loudly when the cash drawer opens -- so that a clerk with decent mental arithmetic skills can’t pretend to register your sale and then pocket the cash. And that’s why you get a physical receipt -- so that the clerk can’t ring up part of your sale, and then siphon the rest into his own pocket. They give you a receipt every time, annoying as it is, because they know you’ll glance at the total and notice if it’s very different from what you just paid. And maybe ask the clerk why, in the hearing of their manager.
