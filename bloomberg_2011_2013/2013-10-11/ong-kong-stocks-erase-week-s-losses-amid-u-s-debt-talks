Hong Kong  stocks  rose, with the
city’s benchmark index erasing losses for the week, as U.S.
lawmakers continued talks on raising the nation’s debt limit to
avoid a default.  The  Hang Seng Index  climbed 1.6 percent to 23,316.87 as of
9:33 a.m. in Hong Kong, poised for an 0.8 percent advance this
week. The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index, also known as the
H-share index, added 1.7 percent to 10,637.58.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rallied by the most since 
January yesterday as House Speaker  John Boehner  and other party 
leaders met with President  Barack Obama  at the White House to 
negotiate. Republicans proposed a short-term increase in the 
debt ceiling that would reduce prospects for a default by
pushing the lapse of U.S. borrowing authority to Nov. 22 from
Oct. 17.  “Both sides are trying to step away from that cliff next
week,” said  Stephen Halmarick , Sydney-based head of investment
markets research at Colonial First State Global Asset
Management, which oversees about A$170 billion ($161 billion).
“People are assuming there will be some resolution before the
17th, but there’s clearly a long way to go.”  Futures on the  S&P 500  were little changed percent today.
The Republican proposal wouldn’t end the partial shutdown of the
federal government, which is going into its eleventh day.  The  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  gained 1.3 percent this year through
yesterday and traded at 11 times estimated earnings, compared
with 15.3 for the S&P 500.  Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing Ltd. yesterday announced it
raised the discount for using some U.S. Treasury bills as
collateral to take into account a possible U.S. default. The
change only affects the clearing house for index futures and
options, bourse spokeswoman Lorraine Chan said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
