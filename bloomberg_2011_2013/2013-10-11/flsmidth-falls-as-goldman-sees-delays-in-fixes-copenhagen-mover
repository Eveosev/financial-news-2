FLSmidth & Co. A/S (FLS)  fell in
Copenhagen trading after Goldman Sachs Global Investment
Research said profit at the Danish mining equipment maker will
stall through 2015 as a restructuring process drags on.  FLSmidth fell as much as 2.5 percent to 280.70 kroner,
making it the biggest loser in the Nasdaq OMX Copenhagen 20
Index. The stock declined 1.8 percent to 282.70 kroner at 9:46
a.m. in the Danish capital, with volume at 27 percent of the
three-month daily average.  FLSmidth, which has  missed  analyst profit estimates in its
last six quarterly reports, presented on Aug. 23 a restructuring
plan which it said will boost profits by eliminating 1,100 jobs
and cutting other costs. Goldman said in a note distributed
today that the plan won’t lift the company fast enough out of
its “trough year in margins,” and lowered its  recommendation 
on the stock to neutral from sell.  “Given the poor demand outlook for mining, we now believe
that restructuring will still be required post 2013 and
therefore do not expect as fast margin recovery as we did
before,” Goldman said in the note. The Copenhagen-based company
faces “too strong a headwind” in its markets, the bank said.  Goldman cut its price estimate on the share to 310 kroner
from 325 kroner. The average price target of 14 analysts
covering the stock is 346 kroner, according to estimates
compiled by Bloomberg.  “Key downside risks include failure to execute on the
materials handling restructuring, lower metal prices, slowing
global growth, project execution issues,” Goldman said.  FLSmidth’s restructuring plans targets an increase in
earnings before interest, tax and amortization of 750 million
kroner ($135 million) in 2015. The company, which has  missed 
analyst net income estimates in its last six quarterly reports,
is scheduled to publish third-quarter earnings on Nov. 6.  To contact the reporter on this story:
