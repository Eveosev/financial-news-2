Gasoline fell, following crude lower
after the  International Energy Agency  estimated that non-OPEC
oil output would rise by the most since the 1970s and as the
partial U.S. government shutdown lurched into its 11th day.  Futures sank as much as 1.7 percent after rising the most
in three weeks yesterday. Producers outside the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries, including the U.S. and  Canada ,
will increase 2014 production by a near-record 1.7 million
barrels a day to 56.4 million, the IEA said, boosting its
forecasts from a month ago by 300,000 barrels a day. The U.S.
Energy Information Administration announced it will cease
operations at the end of the day because of the shutdown.  “Another day goes by that we don’t see government data,
and people are losing faith in economic growth,” said Carl Larry, president of Oil Outlooks & Opinions LLC in Houston.
“That coupled with the IEA report seeing stronger production is
flushing out everyone who went long yesterday.”  Gasoline for November delivery fell 3.32 cents, or 1.2
percent, to $2.6649 a gallon at 10:02 a.m. on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange  on trading volume that was 26 percent below
the 100-day average.  The motor fuel’s  crack spread  versus WTI widened 46 cents
to $10.77 a barrel. The  premium  to Brent fell 55 cents to 97
cents.  Pump prices , averaged nationwide, fell 0.6 cent to $3.345 a
gallon, 46.8 cents below a year ago, Heathrow, Florida-based AAA
said today on its website.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel for November delivery fell 4.86
cents, or 1.6 percent, to $3.0214 a gallon on trading volume
that was 37 percent above the 100-day average.  ULSD’s  premium  versus WTI narrowed 18 cents to $25.75 a
barrel. The  crack spread  over Brent fell $1.25 to $15.89.  To contact the reporters on this story:
