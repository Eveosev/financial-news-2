The cost of insuring Asia-Pacific
corporate and sovereign bonds from non-payment declined to the
lowest in about three weeks, according to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index dropped 5 basis points to
115.5 basis points as of 11:35 a.m. in Sydney, according to
Westpac Banking Corp. The index is on course for its biggest
one-day fall since Sept. 19 and its lowest close since that date
also, according to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  declined 4 basis points to 142 as of
8:34 a.m. in  Hong Kong , Australia & New Zealand Banking Group
Ltd. prices show. The gauge is set for its lowest close since
Sept. 23, according to CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos.
and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the private market.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index fell 6 basis points to 89
basis points as of 9:42 a.m. in  Tokyo , Deutsche Bank AG prices
show. The index is on track for its biggest one-day decrease
since Sept. 19 and its lowest close since that date also,
according to CMA.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
