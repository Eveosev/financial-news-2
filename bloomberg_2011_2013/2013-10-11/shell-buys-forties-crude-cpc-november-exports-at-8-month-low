     Oct. 11 (Bloomberg) -- Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  bought a cargo
of  North Sea  Forties crude at a bigger premium than yesterday.
 Statoil ASA (STL)  failed to sell Oseberg and Ekofisk grades. Workers
at the Grangemouth refinery voted to strike, a move that may
close the Forties Pipeline System.  Shell declared force majeure on Bonny Light exports
yesterday after shutting its Trans Niger oil pipeline in  Nigeria 
for the fifth time in three months because of leaks caused by
thieves. The Caspian Pipeline Consortium will cut November
shipments to the least in eight months, even with the inclusion
of a cargo from the Kashagan field, a preliminary loading
program obtained by Bloomberg News showed.  North Sea  Shell bought Forties for loading Nov. 3 to Nov. 5 from  BP
Plc (BP/)  at 30 cents a barrel more than Dated Brent, according to a
Bloomberg survey of traders and brokers monitoring the Platts
pricing window. That compares with a trade at a 15-cent premium
yesterday.  BP failed to sell a second cargo of Forties for Oct. 24 to
Oct. 26 at 24 cents a barrel less than Dated Brent, while  Total
SA (FP)  didn’t find a buyer for the grade loading Oct. 22 to Oct. 24
at a discount of 15 cents, the survey showed.  Statoil didn’t manage to sell one Oseberg cargo for Oct. 31
to Nov. 2 at $1.60 a barrel more than Dated Brent, and another
shipment of the grade for Nov. 3 to Nov. 5 at a premium of
$1.90, according to the survey. These are the first offers since
June 21.  Statoil was unable to sell Ekofisk for Oct. 28 to Oct. 30
at $1.30 a barrel more than Dated Brent, 30 cents less than its
offer yesterday, the survey showed.  Brent for November settlement traded at $110.67 a barrel on
the ICE Futures  Europe  exchange at the close of the window,
compared with $111.41 from the previous session. The December
contract was at $109.88, a discount of 79 cents to November.  U.K.’s Unite union served a seven days notice of 48-hour
strike planned at Grangegmouth refinery on Oct. 20 at 7 a.m.
local time, the union said in an e-mailed statement. The plant
powers the Forties Pipeline System to which over 80 offshore  oil
fields  are connected.  A very large crude carrier left the Forties loading
terminal Hound Point in  Scotland  for  South Korea  yesterday, the
first tanker to ply this route in four months, ship-tracking
data from Bloomberg show.  The Artemis Glory was booked by Shell for $4.4 million,
according to reports from Poten & Partners and Optima
Shipbrokers Ltd. The shipment is the first to make the voyage
since the Maersk Sandra set sail on June 7, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  Urals/Mediterranean  There were no bids or offers for Urals on the Platts window
for a second day. The grade traded on Oct. 8 at a discount of 90
cents a barrel delivered to Augusta,  Italy .  CPC, operator of the only oil-export link in  Russia  that
has shared foreign ownership, will ship 2.56 million metric tons
in November compared with 2.95 million tons in October, the
schedule showed. That’s equal to 663,170 barrels a day, the
least since March, and is down 10.4 percent from this month.  The CPC program comprises 10 cargoes of 134,000 to 135,500
tons each and 14 consignments of 80,000 to 93,500 tons,
according to the plan.  Exxon Mobil Corp. will load 85,000 tons of Kashagan crude
on Nov. 29, the first shipment from the $48 billion oil project
in  Kazakhstan  that was delayed by eight years. Exxon was
originally allocated one cargo from the field in October, which
was removed from the final loading program.  ONGC Videsh Ltd. offered 600,000 barrels of Azeri Light for
Nov. 18 to Nov. 20 loading from  Turkey ’s port of Ceyhan,
according to a tender document obtained by  Bloomberg News  today.
Bids are due 2:30 p.m. India time on Oct. 18, and will stay
valid until 6:30 p.m. the same day.  Saudi Arabian Oil Co. will supply full volume in November
to customers in Europe, unchanged from this month, according to
two refinery officials with knowledge of the matter.  West Africa  Shell lost about 300,000 barrels a day of crude from the
closing of the Trans Niger Pipeline and Nembe Creek Trunkline,
the company’s Nigerian unit said in an e-mailed statement today.
Force majeure, a legal clause excusing a company from meeting
its commitments because of events beyond its control, was
declared at noon local time yesterday, Shell said.  The entire TNP system, comprising the 24-inch and 28-inch
pipelines, was closed at least five times since early July due
to multiple leaks from theft connections, the company said. A
total of 189 breaches have been repaired on the two links from
January to September this year, according to the statement.  PT Pertamina bought at least 1 million barrels of Nigerian
Qua Iboe for delivery in December via a tender, according to
three traders who participate in the market, asking not to be
identified because the information is confidential. The company
bought two cargoes, one of them said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
