Ghana ’s government is willing to
gradually increase electricity and water tariffs in the future
and will discuss rising utility prices with unions to avoid
planned protests.  The government will not overturn recent rate increases,
Deputy Information  Minister  Murtala Muhammed Ibrahim said in an
interview with Live 91.9 FM today. The  Trades Union Congress ,
which represents 18 labor groups, gave the government on Oct. 9
a 10-day ultimatum to reduce utility prices.  “We want to find a solution to this without demonstrations
and strikes,” Ibrahim said. “We understand the concerns of the
TUC.”  Inflation in West Africa’s second-largest continent
quickened to 11.9 percent in September, the highest this year,
because of a record low cedi and rising gasoline prices. Ghana
raised electricity prices as much as 78.9 percent and the fee
for water as much as 52 percent, the utilities commission said
last month.  To contact the reporters on this story:
