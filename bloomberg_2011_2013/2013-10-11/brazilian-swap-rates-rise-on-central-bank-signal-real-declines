Brazil’s swap rates climbed to a
three-week high on speculation the central bank will raise the
target lending rate to 10 percent after signaling this week that
it will maintain the pace of borrowing cost increases.  Swap rates on contracts due in January 2015 rose four basis
points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 10.32 percent at 10:12 a.m.
in  Sao Paulo , the highest level on a closing basis since Sept.
17. They are up 18 basis points this week. The real depreciated
0.2 percent to 2.1856 per  U.S. dollar , paring its gain this week
to 1.2 percent, still the biggest among emerging-market
currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  Policy makers raised borrowing costs on Oct. 9 by a half-percentage point for a fourth straight time and repeated
language from their August statement that the increases will
ensure slower inflation next year. Inflation was still more than
a percentage point above the central bank’s 4.5 percent target
at 5.86 percent in September.  “The statement by the monetary policy committee shows the
central bank is focused on inflation,”  Luciano Rostagno , the
chief strategist at Banco Mizuho do Brasil in Sao Paulo, said in
a telephone interview.  Finance Minister  Guido Mantega  said in an interview that
policy makers aren’t prevented from raising benchmark rate to 10
percent or higher if needed, Reuters reported. The Finance
Ministry’s press office didn’t immediately respond to a request
for comment from  Bloomberg News .  To contact the reporters on this story:
