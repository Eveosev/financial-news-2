ArcelorMittal SA (MT)  opened a welded
blanks factory, its third plant in Slovakia, to serve carmakers
with assembly factories in the east European country.  The company spent 10 million euros ($13.6 million) to build
the facility, which will have a production capacity of as much
as 2 million parts annually for carmakers such as  Volkswagen AG (VOW) ,
ArcelorMittal said in a statement today. The plant, located in
Senica, western Slovakia, will employ 100 people by 2018 when
the capacity is set to double.  While ArcelorMittal has shut down factories in western
Europe to cope with falling demand, the eastern part of the
continent “is still a growth area,” Robrecht Himpe, chief
executive officer of the company’s Flat Carbon Europe unit told
reporters in Senica.  ArcelorMittal is benefiting from Slovakia’s position as a
central European hub for the car industry. Volkswagen,  PSA
Peugeot (UG)  Citroen and  Kia Motors Corp. (000270)  have factories in the euro-area country, which have been followed by suppliers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
