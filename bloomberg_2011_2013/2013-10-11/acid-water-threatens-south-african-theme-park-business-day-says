Tsogo Sun Holdings Ltd. (TSH) ,  South
Africa ’s biggest hotel and leisure operator, may see one of its

Department of Water Affairs, the newspaper reported, citing the
department’s senior manager, Marius Keet.  The “environmentally critical level” of water had been
raised from 179 meters (587 feet) below surface level to 126
meters, the Johannesburg-based newspaper reported. The water
level is currently 28 meters from the critical level, Business
Day said.  Tsogo shares have gained 17 percent this year, valuing the
company at 32.76 billion rand ($3.32 billion).  To contact the reporter on this story:
