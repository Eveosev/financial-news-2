India ’s 10-year government bonds
capped a second week of gains, the longest stretch since May,
after the Reserve Bank of India rolled back some measures taken
to shore up the rupee following a rebound in the currency.  RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan reduced the  marginal standing
facility  by 50 basis points to 9 percent this week, the second
cut in less than a month, as the currency rebounded 13 percent
from a record low of 68.845 per dollar on Aug. 28. He also cut
the bank rate to 9 percent, while keeping the main repurchase
rate at 7.5 percent. India sold 150 billion rupees ($2.5
billion) of notes as planned at a weekly auction today.  The yield on the 7.16 percent notes due May 2023 dropped 12
basis points, or 0.12 percentage point, this week to 8.49
percent in Mumbai, according to prices from the central bank’s
trading system. The rate climbed seven basis points today.  “We believe the balance of risks has turned in favor of
Indian government bonds following the adjustment in yields, the
stabilization of the rupee and an improvement in the current-account” deficit, Barclays Plc analysts including Singapore-based Rohit Arora wrote in a report dated yesterday. “The
unwinding of liquidity-tightening measures” is likely to
improve domestic investor confidence, they added.  India’s current-account deficit widened less than forecast
to $21.8 billion in the three months ended June, compared with
$18.1 billion in the previous period, data showed last week. The
median of 26 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey was for a $23
billion  shortfall  in the broadest measure of trade.  Index Inclusion  Bonds rose yesterday after a report said India is in talks
with JPMorgan Chase & Co. and other managers for inclusion in
their indexes. Ten-year notes slumped in each of the last four
months, the longest run of losses since 2009, as the RBI raised
interest rates and curbed funding support to banks to stem the
rupee’s slide. The currency rose 0.5 percent to 61.08 per dollar
today, completing a second week of gains.  Rajan unexpectedly raised the key repurchase rate by 25
basis points on Sept. 20, the first increase since 2011, to curb
the fastest consumer-price increases among the four largest
 emerging markets . He also cut the marginal standing facility
rate to 9.5 percent from 10.25 percent the same day as part of
steps to ease cash supply.  One-year interest-rate swap, a derivative contracts used to
guard against fluctuations in funding costs, plunged 28 basis
points to 8.38 percent in a sixth week of declines, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. The rate fell one basis point today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
