Taiwan dollar forwards headed for
the worst week in more than two months on speculation the
central bank will seek to curb a rally in the  spot market  that
threatens exports.  Shipments (TWTREXPY) , which account for about three-quarters of the
economy, slumped 7 percent in September from a year earlier,
official data showed this week, as the  International Monetary
Fund  cut a forecast for the island’s 2013 growth to 2.2 percent
from 3 percent. The spot rate gained 1.5 percent in the past
month as global funds injected $3 billion into domestic stocks.
Policy makers will step in to maintain an orderly market should
irregular factors such as short-term capital flows cause excess
volatility, the central bank said in a Sept. 26 statement.  “Intervention has intensified,” said Andrew Tsai, an
economist at KGI Securities in Taipei. “September exports fell,
so the market, corporations and the central bank are all
concerned. The trend is still one of gradual appreciation, but
just at a slower pace.”  One-month non-deliverable forwards fell 0.2 percent from a
week ago to NT$29.335 per  U.S. dollar  as of 10:24 a.m. in
Taipei, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the
biggest decline since the five days ended Aug. 2. The contracts
were little changed today.  Overseas investors bought $262 million more Taiwanese
equities than they sold this week through Oct. 9, taking this
year’s net purchases to $6.6 billion, exchange data show. Local
markets were shut yesterday for a holiday.  Spot Market  In the spot market, the local dollar strengthened 0.4
percent this week and 0.5 percent today to NT$29.399 against the
greenback, prices from Taipei Forex Inc. show.  The currency dropped 0.4 percent in the final 16 minutes of
trading on Oct. 9 amid suspected intervention by the central
bank. The monetary authority has sold the local dollar in the
run-up to the close on most days since March 2012, according to
traders who asked not to be identified.  The yield on the 1.75 percent government notes due
September 2023 increased one basis point this week and two basis
points today to 1.67 percent, according to Gretai Securities
Market.  One-month implied volatility, a gauge of expected moves in
the  exchange rate  used to price options, dropped 17 basis
points, or 0.17 percentage point, this week and eight basis
points today to 3.83 percent.  The  overnight interbank lending rate  was steady today and
this week at 0.388 percent, a weighted average compiled by the
Taiwan Interbank Money Center showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
