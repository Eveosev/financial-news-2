Howard Schultz is a really nice guy. He runs a nice company that gives people somewhere they can always stop for a hot drink, a comfy chair and a clean bathroom. Starbucks is consistently ranked as one of the  best places to work , because of its decent wages, excellent benefits and free coffee. Schultz, the chief executive officer, is obviously a big reason that those things happen (though of course an affluent demographic  also makes a big difference ). Anyway, Schultz is clearly a nice guy. But he seems to be suffering from a common delusion of nice guys, which is that if folks only understood how much they were dismaying nice guys like Howard Schultz, they would stop whatever misbehavior is causing the anguish. Earlier this week,  Starbucks Corp  announced that it would give a free tall coffee to anyone who buys another customer a drink at Starbucks. Which is nice. However, as USA Today reports, it just also made  another announcement : Here's the problem: Although Schultz has lots of customers who are Republicans, his product is culturally identified with an affluent professional elite that not only overwhelmingly votes Democratic, but has been known to make snotty remarks about those NASCAR-watching, woman-hating, racist and homophobic mouth-breathers who vote Republican. It’s like trying to stop your best friend from drinking by getting his ex-wives to sign a petition. It’s hard to make a convincing case that they’ve actually got his best interests at heart. Now, as it happens, I do think that raising the debt ceiling and calling off the shutdown are in the best interests of both the Republicans and the American people, if for no other reason than because failure to do so is  hurting  the Republicans with the voters they’ll need come November 2014. But I’m not going to tell them that while sipping a pumpkin soy milk latte.
