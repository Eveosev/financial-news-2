European stocks  climbed for a second
day amid optimism U.S. lawmakers will agree to lift the debt
limit, removing the imminent threat of default.  Royal Mail  Group Ltd. jumped 38 percent on its first day of
trading in  London . Actelion Ltd. advanced 4 percent to lead a
rally in health-care companies. Swedish Match AB tumbled the
most in almost four months after saying earnings at its U.S.
cigars and chewing-tobacco unit will decline.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index rose 0.4 percent to 311.61 at
the close of trading. The benchmark gauge surged 1.7 percent
yesterday as House Republican leaders presented proposals to
raise the $16.7 trillion U.S. debt limit for six weeks without
policy conditions. The index has increased 0.6 percent in the
past five days after sliding for two straight weeks.  “The positive sentiment from yesterday’s rally is spilling
over to today’s trading day,” Patrick Kraehenbuehl, a portfolio
manager at Umblin AG in Zurich, said in a telephone interview.
“It was a very strong signal that was sent to investors, a
first positive approach from both sides. However, it won’t be an
easy stroll to come to a compromise. Markets may be a bit overly
enthusiastic.”  National benchmark indexes advanced in 13 of the 18 western
European markets. The U.K’s FTSE 100 rallied 0.9 percent and
Germany’s  DAX (DAX)  climbed 0.5 percent to close at a record.  France ’s
CAC 40 was little changed.  Debt Talks  President  Barack Obama  met with Republican leaders
yesterday after House Speaker  John Boehner  said he would offer a
measure to push back the possibility of a U.S. default until
Nov. 22.  Without congressional action to raise the  debt limit , the
U.S. will exhaust its borrowing authority on Oct. 17. The
government of the world’s biggest economy has been partially
shut down since Oct. 1 after lawmakers failed to pass a budget.  Royal Mail, Britain’s 360-year-old postal service, jumped
38 percent to 455 pence on its trading debut in London. The
initial public offering was the U.K.’s biggest sale of state
assets since British Rail was broken up in the 1990s.  Actelion, a Swiss drugmaker, rose 4 percent to 63.55 Swiss
francs as health-care shares contributed the most to the Stoxx
600’s gain. Shire Plc climbed 2.7 percent to 2,445 pence in
London, while  Roche Holding AG , the world’s biggest maker of
cancer drugs, gained 1.8 percent to 238.90 francs.  Genmab A/S, the Danish developer of cancer drugs, added 2.3
percent to 236.90 kroner. The company said its ofatumumab drug
showed a significant reduction in cumulative number of new brain
lesions in a multiple sclerosis study.  EMS Rises  EMS-Chemie Holding AG (EMSN)  advanced 3.1 percent to 321.25
francs. The chemical maker said nine-month sales climbed 7
percent to 1.44 billion francs ($1.58 billion) and forecast that
the economy will remain favorable in coming months.  “Growth seems likely to even accelerate in the fourth
quarter,” Patrick Rafaisz, an analyst at Vontobel Holding AG,
wrote in a note to clients. “EMS-Chemie’s top-line performance
is once again impressive.”  Swedish Match (SWMA) , the maker of Longhorn snuff, sank 4.2
percent to 221.30 kronor, the most since June 20. Third-quarter
operating profit at its U.S. cigars and chewing tobacco unit,
which accounts for about a fifth of revenue, fell by as much as
60 million kronor ($9.2 million) from a year earlier.  Neste Oil  Neste Oil Oyj, the Finnish refiner that said last month
it’s benefiting from increased renewable-fuel sales in  North
America , plunged 7.5 percent to 15.58 euros. The U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency is considering scaling back
legal requirements on the use of ethanol fuels next year,
according to an internal proposal provided to Bloomberg.  Geberit AG, the Swiss maker of toilets and bathroom-piping
systems, fell 1.6 percent to 236.90 francs. Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. recommended selling the shares, citing a disappointing
outlook for growth in its most profitable products.  EON SE and RWE AG,  Germany ’s biggest utilities, dropped 3.6
percent to 13.74 euros and 2.1 percent to 26.78 euros,
respectively. A gauge of utility stocks in the Stoxx 600 slid
0.6 percent for the only drop out of 19 groups.  To contact the reporter on this story:
