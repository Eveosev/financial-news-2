Justin Verlander  pitched eight
scoreless innings and  Miguel Cabrera  hit a two-run homer as the
Detroit Tigers reached their third consecutive American League
Championship Series with a 3-0 win at the Oakland Athletics.  The Tigers won the best-of-five division series three games
to two and advanced to the ALCS against the Boston Red Sox.  Verlander, who threw a four-hit shutout with 11 strikeouts
in a Game 5 division win at Oakland last year, was almost as
good this time. He only allowed three hitters to reach base and
struck out 10 before Joaquin Benoit took over in the ninth,
getting three outs for the save.  The A’s didn’t have a baserunner until Josh Reddick walked
with one out in the sixth inning. Their first hit came in the
seventh on a two-out single by Yoenis Cespedes, and Reddick
singled with two outs in the eighth.  After Verlander and A’s starter Sonny Gray each went
through the lineup once without allowing a hit, the Tigers got
four hits and two runs in the fourth on Cabrera’s home run.  Detroit added a run in the sixth on a run-scoring groundout
by Omar Infante.  The A’s have now lost their last six winner-takes-all
games, including last year’s Game 5 against the Tigers. The last
time they won such a game was in the 1973  World Series  against
the  New York  Mets.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
