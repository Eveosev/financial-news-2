Spirit Airlines Inc. (SAVE)  surged to a
record after the discount carrier said a benchmark revenue gauge
climbed more than forecast last quarter amid higher bookings.  The shares  jumped  15 percent to $39.11 at the close in New
York, the highest closing price since the airline’s initial
public offering in May 2011. Spirit has more than doubled this
year compared with a 19 percent gain for the Standard & Poor’s
500 Index.  Revenue from each seat flown a mile increased as much as 9
percent in the third quarter, the Miramar, Florida-based company
said yesterday in a filing. Spirit in September projected growth
in the mid-single digit range. Traffic last month also surged 29
percent compared with a year earlier, according to the filing.  The guidance prompted Stephen Trent, an analyst at
Citigroup Inc. in New York, to upgrade his rating on the shares
to buy from hold. Duane Pfennigwerth, an analyst at Evercore
Partners, boosted his price target to $45 a share from $41 and
raised his third-quarter profit forecast.  “Results like this should be increasingly hard to ignore
and, in our view, Spirit should see multiple expansion over
time,” Pfennigwerth, who rates the shares overweight, said in a
note yesterday.  Spirit is scheduled to report quarterly results on Oct. 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
