BG Group Plc (BG/) ’s Lake Charles LNG
project will add almost 2 billion cubic feet a day to U.S. gas
exports by 2021 and help limit higher prices,  Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. (GS)  said in a report yesterday.  The terminal will bring U.S. exports of liquefied natural
gas to 7.7 billion cubic feet-a-day, assuming 8.7 billion cubic
feet-a-day of liquefaction capacity is built, Goldman Sachs
analyst Samantha Dart in  London  said in an e-mailed report.  The U.S. investment bank predicts the Lake Charles export
project will get necessary financing for construction, with a
final investment decision expected in 2015, according to Dart.  “From the perspective of the global LNG market, this means
that the balance from 2020 will likely be softer than we
previously expected, as future demand will have more supply
available to draw from,” Dart said. “However, at this point we
do not expect the 2020-2023 market balance to be as soft as in
2016-2017, when we expect global liquefaction capacity to rise
significantly.”  The Lake Charles project got  approval  on Aug. 7 from the
Department of Energy to export LNG to countries who do not have
a free trade agreement with the U.S.  To contact the reporter on this story:
