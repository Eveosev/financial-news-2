Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE) ,  Germany ’s
biggest phone company, and  China Petrochemical Corp. (386)  led $21
billion of U.S. corporate bond sales this week, the second
straight period below the 2013 average, as the partial
government shutdown sidelined issuers.  Deutsche Telekom sold $5.6 billion in notes of its  T-Mobile
USA Inc. (TMUS)  unit while China Petroleum, known as the Beijing-based
Sinopec Group, issued $2.75 billion, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. While sales rose from  $11.9 billion  last week,
offerings compare with this year’s weekly average of $30
billion.  President Barack Obama and House Republican leaders remain
at odds over terms even as they move toward an agreement to
extend the nation’s borrowing authority that might postpone a
potential U.S. default. Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew warned
yesterday that the congressional deadlock over the U.S. debt
limit was starting to stress financial markets and a default
would lead to serious repercussions.  “The U.S. government shutdown has had a marked impact on
equities and new issuance,” Robert Smalley, the  Stamford ,
Connecticut-based head of the investment-grade and leveraged
finance credit analyst group at UBS AG, wrote in an Oct. 9
report on financial bonds. “Fixed-income investors remain
generally cautious as the new-issue calendar has ground to a
halt.”  Yellen Nomination  The extra yield investors demand to own corporate bonds
rather than government debentures narrowed to 218 basis points
yesterday from 222 basis points on Oct. 4, according to Bank of
America Merrill Lynch index data. Yields were little changed at
4.09 percent, and compare with a record low of 3.35 percent on
May 2.  Borrowing rates remain below a 15-month high of 4.37
percent in September amid speculation that Janet Yellen,
nominated this week by President  Barack Obama  to lead the
Federal Reserve, will keep interest rates at a record low to
spur the economy.  Obama and House Republicans met for 90 minutes at the White
House yesterday in the first sign that the parties might resolve
the fiscal impasse without negative economic consequences from a
default as the halt in government operations moved into its 11th
day.  Sinopec Offering  Deutsche Telekom sold T-Mobile debt in five parts maturing
between 2019 and 2023 after the offering was boosted from an
initial $3.1 billion. The $1.25 billion of 6.542 percent notes
due 2020, sold at a relative yield of 460 basis points, traded
at 103.5 cents on the dollar to yield 5.89 percent at 9:54 a.m.
in New York, according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system
of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.  Sinopec, Asia’s biggest refiner, issued debt in three parts
with the largest portion, $1.5 billion of 4.375 percent, 10-year
securities, trading at 99.15 cents on the dollar to yield 4.48
percent at 10:13 a.m., Trace data show.  Sales of investment-grade debentures reached at least $11.4
billion, compared with  $10.6 billion  last week and a 2013 weekly
average of  $22.7 billion , Bloomberg data show. Offerings of
speculative-grade bonds reached at least $9.4 billion, compared
with  $1.3 billion  last week and an average this year of $7.3
billion.  High-risk, high-yield bonds are rated below Baa3 by Moody’s
Investors Service and lower than BBB- at Standard & Poor’s.  Issuers planning sales include Neiman Marcus Group offering
$1.56 billion of eight-year notes, including securities that
allow it to pay interest with extra debt, according to a filing
by the Dallas-based company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
