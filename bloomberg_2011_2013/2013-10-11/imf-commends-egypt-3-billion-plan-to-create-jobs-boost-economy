The International Monetary Fund
commended  Egypt ’s plan to boost public spending by $3 billion to
create jobs and stimulate economic growth as political unrest
keeps private investment subdued.  “We do think it’s a good idea,” Masood Ahmed, head of the
Middle East and Central Asia department at the IMF, said in a
briefing today in  Washington .  The stimulus is financed by aid from Saudi Arabia, the
United Arab Emirates and  Kuwait , which have pledged $12 billion
to Egypt since the military toppled Islamist President Mohamed Mursi in July. The Gulf money offers Egypt a “window” to carry
out reforms that would direct more spending toward capital
investment, Ahmed said.  The flow of aid led Egypt to halt plans to seek a $4.8
billion loan from the IMF, an agreement it had struggled to
secure for more than two years following the ouster of President
 Hosni Mubarak  in a 2011 uprising.  Egypt’s economy will grow 2.9 percent in 2014, according to
the median estimate of 16 economists surveyed by Bloomberg, from
about 2.2 percent in the fiscal year that ended in June. That’s
still below the government’s target of 3.5 percent, and the 5
percent average during Mubarak’s last decade in power.  The military-backed interim government is seeking to cap
spending on fuel subsidies, distributing them through smart
cards to prevent abuses. Egypt’s subsidy bill surged to 120
billion pounds ($17.4 billion) in the last fiscal year, from 40
billion pounds in 2006.  To contact the reporter on this story:
