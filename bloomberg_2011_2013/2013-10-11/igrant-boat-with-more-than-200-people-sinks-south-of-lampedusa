A migrant boat carrying more than
200 people sank south of Lampedusa,  Italy , the second such
tragedy in the area this month.  Dead bodies were spotted about 60 to 70 miles off the
island by the Italian Navy when helicopters arrived to drop
flotation devices for the survivors, Enrico Pacioni, a spokesman
for the Navy, said today by telephone. A naval vessel arrived at
the site and was pulling survivors from the water and a second
ship was on its way, he said.  The island of Lampedusa, about halfway between Sicily and
the Tunisian coast, is a common destination for undocumented
migrants seeking entry into the European Union. Last week, at
least 310 people died after their ship capsized on its way to
Lampedusa, a tragedy that was memorialized by an Oct. 9 visit to
the island by Italian Prime Minister Enrico Letta and European
Commission President  Jose Manuel Barroso .  Rescue efforts are still under way and a count of survivors
and deaths can’t be made until they are completed, Pacioni said.
The boat’s destination is thought to have been Lampedusa, while
its point of departure was unknown, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
