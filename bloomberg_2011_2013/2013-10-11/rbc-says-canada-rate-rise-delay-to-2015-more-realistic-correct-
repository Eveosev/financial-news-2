(Corrects date reference in second paragraph.)  The  Bank of Canada  may delay raising
its policy interest rate until the first half of 2015, Royal
Bank of Canada’s capital markets unit said today.  “There is a non-trivial risk that our current 3Q 2014
policy call may be threatened,” Ian Pollick, RBC economist,
said in a note to clients. “A move to 1H 2015 is becoming more
realistic.”  RBC said it will wait until the central bank issues its
monetary policy report later this month before making any
adjustment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
