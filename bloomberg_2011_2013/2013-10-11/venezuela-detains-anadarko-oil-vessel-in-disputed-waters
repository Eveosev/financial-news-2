Anadarko Petroleum Corp. (APC) , the third-largest independent U.S. oil and natural gas producer, said it’s
working for the release of a research vessel and its crew after
Guyana said Venezuela detained the ship in disputed waters
yesterday.  The MV Teknik Perdana “was under contract to our company
and conducting a seafloor survey on behalf the government of
Guyana,”  John Christiansen , a spokesman for the Woodlands,
Texas-based company, said in an e-mail today.  Venezuela intercepted the vessel while it was surveying the
seabed at the Roraima offshore license, Guyana’s Ministry of
 Foreign Affairs  said in a  statement  posted on its website today.
The ship was escorted to Venezuela’s Margarita Island and its
crew arrested, Guyana said. A spokeswoman for the Venezuelan
Navy had no immediate comment.  Guyana said the ship was in its territorial waters when the
incident occurred. The Guyanese government granted Anadarko the
offshore license last year.  Venezuela and Guyana have had border disputes since 1841,
according to the U.S.  State Department . Venezuela has said its
border extends as far east as the Essequibo River, a dispute
that extends to nearby Atlantic waters rich in natural gas.  To contact the reporters on this story:
