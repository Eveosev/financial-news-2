The Caspian Pipeline Consortium will
reduce November shipments to the least in eight months, even
with additional exports from the Kashagan field, a preliminary
 loading program  obtained by  Bloomberg News  showed.  CPC, operator of the only oil-export link in Russia that
has shared foreign ownership, will ship 2.56 million metric tons
in November compared with 2.95 million tons in October, the
schedule showed. That’s equal to 663,170 barrels a day, the
least since March, and is down 10.4 percent from this month.  The CPC program comprises 10 cargoes of 134,000 to 135,500
tons each and 14 consignments of 80,000 to 93,500 tons,
according to the plan.  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  will load 85,000 tons of Kashagan crude
on Nov. 29, the first shipment from the $48 billion oil project
in Kazakhstan that was delayed by eight years. Exxon was
originally allocated one cargo from the field in October, which
was removed from the final loading program.  Production at Kashagan was halted again after traces of gas
were detected during a routine inspection of a pipeline,
according to the project’s operator, North Caspian Operating
Consortium. The field was also shut on Sept. 24 because of a
leak and resumed flow on Oct. 6.  The CPC pipeline, in which  Chevron Corp. (CVX)  is the biggest
corporate shareholder with a 15 percent stake, carries crude
from Kazakhstan’s western fields to a terminal near Russia’s
Novorossiysk port on the  Black Sea . Russia owns 31 percent of
the pipeline and Kazakhstan 21 percent. Exxon,  OAO Lukoil (LKOH)  and a
joint venture between  OAO Rosneft (ROSN)  and Shell are among the other
shareholders.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
