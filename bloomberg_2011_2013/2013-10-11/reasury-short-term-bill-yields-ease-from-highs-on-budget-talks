Rates on Treasury bills maturing in
November and December jumped for a second day as officials in
 Washington  worked on a short-term budget agreement that may push
the possibility of a default back six weeks.  Rates on securities due in October fell from their highest
levels this week as U.S. lawmakers discussed a House Republican
proposal to postpone the deadline for Congress to lift the debt
ceiling to Nov. 22 from Oct. 17. Benchmark 10-year notes held a
second weekly decline. The U.S. sale of $13 billion of 30-year
bonds yesterday drew the highest demand since February after
lackluster three- and 10-year notes sales earlier in the week.  “All we’ve done is roll the risk out some -- we’ve kicked
the can down the road a bit,” said  Brian Edmonds , the head of
interest-rates trading in New York at  Cantor Fitzgerald , one of
21 primary dealers that trade with the  Federal Reserve . “I
don’t think it’s pricing in a significant default. That would be
a 10 percent bill. It’s more of an inconvenience trade and
cheapening.”  Rates on debt due on Nov. 29 rose four basis points, or
0.04 percentage point, to 0.16 percent as of 5 p.m. New York
time, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices, after adding
eight basis points yesterday. They were negative Sept. 30.  The rate on $120 billion in bills due Oct. 17 dropped 11
basis points to 0.20 percent after touching 0.51 percent
yesterday. The rate on $93 billion in bills due Oct. 24 fell
five basis points to 0.26 percent after climbing as high as 0.50
percent yesterday.  Treasury 10-year  note yields  rose one basis point or 0.01
percentage point to 2.69 percent after falling as much as four
basis points earlier. They gained four basis points this week.
The price of the 2.5 percent security due in August 2023 fell
11/32, or $3.44 per $1,000 face amount, to 98 12/32.  Volume, Volatility  Treasury trading volume at ICAP Plc, the largest inter-dealer broker of  U.S. government debt , dropped 40 percent to
$243.7 billion, from $409 billion yesterday, the highest level
since Sept. 18. The average this year is $315.8 billion.  Volatility in Treasuries as measured by the Bank of America
Merrill Lynch MOVE index dropped to 77.11, the lowest level
since Sept. 25. It climbed on Sept. 5 to 114.2, the highest
level in two months. It touched a record low 49 in May.  Historically Low  Although rates on bills have risen, they pale by historical
measures. Treasury one-month  bill rates  have averaged 1.5
percent in the past 10 years. During that time the rate touched
a high of 5.26 percent in November 2006 and dropped to a low of
negative 0.09 percent in December 2008.  The overnight Treasury general collateral repo rate opened
at 0.2 percent, according to ICAP Plc, the world’s largest
inter-dealer broker, down from the open yesterday of 0.27
percent. It opened at 0.09 percent at the start of the week.  Credit-default swaps insuring against losses on U.S.
Treasuries for five years were at 35 basis points, versus 40 at
the end of last week, according to Bloomberg data. They have
fallen 9 percent this week, the biggest decline since the five
days through Sept. 13.  Swaps on Treasuries were the ninth most traded of 1,000
entities tracked by the Depository Trust & Clearing Corp. in the
week through Oct. 4, up from 147th two weeks before, with 87
trades covering a gross $2.3 billion of debt.  There are now 953 contracts covering a net $3.6 billion of
Treasuries outstanding, the most in a year and up from a more
than two-year low of $3.1 billion on Sept. 20.  Treasury Auctions  Yesterday’s Treasury bond sale drew a 2.64 bid-to-cover
ratio, compared with an average of 2.47 at the past 10 bond
offerings. The auctions of $30 billion in three-year debt on
Oct. 8 and $21 billion in 10-year securities the next day drew
lower-than-average demand. They were the first sales of coupon
securities since the government shutdown began.  The Fed today purchased $1.56 billion in Treasuries
maturing between May 2038 and February 2043 as part of its
commitment to lower borrowing costs.  House Republicans  offered a plan to raise the U.S. debt
limit and end a partial government shutdown that would require
President  Barack Obama  to accept policy conditions attached to a
spending measure, said two congressional aides. Obama has
insisted that he won’t accept conditions for ending the
shutdown, which is in its 11th day.  Staff members for Obama and House Speaker  John Boehner 
worked into the night yesterday after Boehner proposed the
short-term debt limit increase.  ‘Major Accidents’  “The debt-ceiling debate will be resolved without major
accidents,” Nicola Mai, senior vice president and sovereign
credit analyst at Pacific Investment Management Co., said in an
interview on Bloomberg Television’s “The Pulse” with  Francine Lacqua . “Politicians realize there is significant consequences
to this and that’s why last night we saw some opening on the
part of Republicans and Democrats in debt negotiations.”  The  extra yield  investors get for buying one-month
securities instead of 91-day securities reached 28.9 basis
points on Oct. 8, the biggest difference since March 2008,
according to closing-market data. The spread was 19.8 basis
points today.  The longer-dated bills usually yield more than their one-month counterparts. In 2013, investors have been able to earn
almost one basis point on average by buying the longer-dated
security.  ‘Political Game’  “This is a political game right now,” said  Michael Franzese , senior vice president of fixed-income trading at ED&F
Man Capital Markets in New York. “It’s a good proposal and the
sense is that it gets them to the table to talk. People think
they are not going to default, and if they are not going to
default, then they put their money into bills.”  Two years ago,  one-month bill rates  climbed to 0.17 percent
in the days before the Aug. 2, 2011, deadline set by the
Treasury to avoid a default. They were at 0.015 percent in
December 2012 before a year-end trigger of automatic spending
cuts and tax increases.  The  three-month rate  climbed to 0.09 percent before the
August 2011 deadline, and it rose as high as 0.081 percent in
the week before Dec. 31, 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
