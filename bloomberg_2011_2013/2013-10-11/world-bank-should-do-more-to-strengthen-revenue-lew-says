The  World Bank  should do more to
strengthen its revenue base and tighten its budget, U.S.
Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew said.  “We support ongoing analysis and work to optimize the
World Bank’s use of its existing financial resources,” Lew said
according to the text of a statement he’s giving to the
Development Committee during meetings of the  International
Monetary Fund  and World Bank in Washington today.  “Due consideration should be given to achieving cost
efficiencies within the administrative budget, strengthening the
revenue base, and leveraging the existing capital base,” Lew
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
