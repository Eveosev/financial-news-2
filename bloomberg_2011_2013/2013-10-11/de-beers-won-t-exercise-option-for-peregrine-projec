Canadian gem explorer Peregrine
Diamonds Ltd. dropped the most ever after it said  De Beers , the
world’s largest diamond producer, won’t exercise its right to
acquire control of the Chidliak project in the Canadian Arctic.  Peregrine  plunged  35 percent to 43 cents at the close in
Toronto, the biggest decline since the shares were listed in
January 2006.  Peregrine was verbally notified by De Beers of its decision
regarding Chidliak, the Vancouver-based company said today in a
statement.  De Beers, a unit of  Anglo American Plc (AAL) , had the right to
form a joint venture with Peregrine that would have given it a
50.1 percent stake in Chidliak. Under the terms of the venture,
De Beers would have helped fund a feasibility study of the
diamond project.  Chidliak  is located 120 kilometers (75 miles) from Iqaluit,
the capital of  Canada ’s Nunavut territory. The final results of
an evaluation of the mine’s ore are expected in the first
quarter, Peregrine said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
