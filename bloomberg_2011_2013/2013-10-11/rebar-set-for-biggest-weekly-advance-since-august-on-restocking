Steel reinforcement-bar futures in
 Shanghai  climbed, heading for the biggest weekly gain in eight
weeks, as traders stepped up purchases for winter stockpiling
and as raw material prices gained.  Rebar for delivery in January on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange gained as much as 0.7 percent to 3,621 yuan ($592) a
metric ton, before trading at 3,612 yuan at 10:43 a.m. local
time. Futures have gained 0.7 percent this week, the most since
the five days through Aug. 16.  Rebar inventory in  China  fell 1.8 percent to 6.29 million
tons as of Sept. 27, the lowest since the week ended Jan. 25,
according to Shanghai Steelhome Information Technology Co.
Traders increased buying to replenish inventories, said Ren
Xinlei, an analyst at Luzheng Futures Co. in Jinan.  “The winter restocking process looks normal, so we remain
bullish on the rebar market,” Ren said. “Rebar is also
supported by production costs as iron ore and coking coal prices
have climbed.”  Iron ore  for immediate delivery at Tianjin port rose for a
third day, adding 0.9 percent to $133.0 a dry ton yesterday,
according to a price index compiled by The Steel Index Ltd.  The average spot price of rebar gained 0.2 percent to 3,507
 yuan  a ton yesterday, according to Beijing Antaike Information
Development Co.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
