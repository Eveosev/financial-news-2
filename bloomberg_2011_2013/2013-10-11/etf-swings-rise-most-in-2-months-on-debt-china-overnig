Chinese stocks rose for a third day
in  New York  on speculation U.S. lawmakers were making progress
toward avoiding a default.  Seaspan Corp. (SSW)  jumped 9.8 percent
after scrapping plans for an additional offering.  The Bloomberg China-US Equity Index of the most-traded
Chinese stocks in the U.S. added 0.9 percent to 104.68
yesterday, trimming its weekly decline to 0.1 percent.
Container-ship operator Seaspan’s jump pared the weekly slide to
the biggest since May 2012. Bona Film Group surged 20 percent
this week, while web retailer  E-Commerce China Dangdang Inc. (DANG) 
posted the biggest slump since August.  House Republicans  offered a plan to raise the debt limit
and end the shutdown that would require President  Barack Obama 
to accept policy conditions attached to a spending measure, said
two congressional aides, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
 China ’s September exports probably grew at the slowest pace in
three months, according to the median estimate of 36 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg. The government will report economic data
from gross domestic product to industrial output next week.  “The market will likely remain volatile until we have
firmer details that an agreement on the U.S. debt limit is
forthcoming,”  Michael Wang , an emerging-markets strategist at
Amiya Capital LLP in London, said by e-mail yesterday. “I
expect China’s economic data to be largely OK in September but
could show a slowing improvement from August.”  The iShares China  ETF (FXI) , the largest Chinese exchange-traded
fund in the U.S., climbed 0.6 percent to $38.36 in New York for
a second weekly rally. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index added 0.6
percent for a weekly advance of 0.8 percent.  Sale Terminated  Seaspan, based in  Hong Kong , rallied for the first time in
eight days, surging to $21.61.  The company said yesterday it terminated an offering of
common shares and convertible notes to raise funds. It had
planned to sell 5.7 million shares and $125 million of bonds,
according to its statement Oct. 7.  WuXi PharmaTech Cayman Inc. (WX) , a biotechnology research
company based in Shanghai, surged 8.2 percent in a second day of
rally to $29.19, after slumping 8.1 percent the first three days
of the week. Oppenheimer & Co. lifted its price estimate for
Wuxi by 14 percent to $32 in a note dated Oct. 10, citing an
improving biotech funding environment in China and the company’s
manufacturing potential.  Beijing-based Dangdang, the nation’s biggest online book
seller, sank 14 percent this week to $10.28. That was the
largest weekly retreat since the end of August.  Share Dilution  NQ Mobile Inc. (NQ) , a mobile-security service provider, dropped
7.4 percent this week to $20.10. It added 2.1 percent yesterday.  The Beijing-based company sold $150 million of convertible
notes due 2018 on Oct. 9. The conversion price was about $25.61
per ADR, it said in a statement that day.  “NQ’s convertible bonds sale caused concern about its
share value dilution, and also the conversion price wasn’t very
attractive,” Jun Zhang, an analyst at Wedge Partners Corp. in
Greenwood Village, Colorado, said by phone Oct. 10.  Overseas shipments probably grew 5.5 percent in September
from a year earlier, according to the Bloomberg News survey.
That would compare with August’s 7.2 percent and 9.8 percent in
September 2012.  China’s economy  may have expanded 7.8 percent in
the last three months, a separate survey by Bloomberg showed.
The growth rate was 7.5 percent in the second quarter.  Bona Film, based in Beijing, added 3.8 percent yesterday to
$6.84, the highest level since March 2011. Its 20 percent weekly
jump was the biggest on the China-US gauge.  The Hang Seng China Enterprises  Index (HSCEI)  gained 0.6 percent
this week to 10,580.75, the biggest increase in three weeks. The
Shanghai Composite Index jumped 2.5 percent to 2,228.15,
rallying the most in a month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
