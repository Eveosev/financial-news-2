JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) , the largest
U.S. lender, said it will halt clearing services for about 500
foreign banks and discontinue checking accounts for
“politically exposed persons” in other nations.  The changes are part of a strategy of “de-risking through
client selection,” the New York-based bank said today in a
presentation on its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
