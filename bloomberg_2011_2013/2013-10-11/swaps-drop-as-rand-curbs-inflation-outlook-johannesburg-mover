South African one-year  interest-rate
swaps , used to speculate on borrowing costs, dropped to the
lowest level in more than two months as the rand stabilizes,
easing  inflation (SACPIYOY)  expectations.  One-year swaps declined two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 5.37 percent by 1:10 p.m. in Johannesburg,
the lowest since July 22, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. They declined an eighth day, the longest losing
streak since September 2011, signaling that investors are paring
bets of higher  interest rates  over the next 12 months.  “With the rand having remained fairly stable at around 10
for a dollar, and inflation coming in line with expectations and
expected to show renewed declines, some of the hiking fears are
being priced out,” Carmen Nel, a Cape Town-based fixed-income
analyst at Rand Merchant Bank, said by phone today.  The rand’s three-month implied volatility versus the dollar
fell 21 basis points to 14.4 percent, the lowest since July 29.
Declining volatility indicates that options traders see narrower
price swings in the currency in the coming months.  Inflation in  Africa ’s largest economy is forecast to
average 5.9 percent this year, according to central bank
estimates and below the monetary policy committee’s upper target
of 6 percent. Reserve Bank Governor Gill Marcus has held the key
repurchase rate at 5 percent since July 2012, the lowest in 30
years. The rand gained 0.2 percent to 9.8899 per dollar,
advancing a fourth day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
