French Finance Minister Pierre Moscovici said the Group of Seven nations could decide to
address  Japan ’s foreign-exchange policy if needed.  Japan’s actions to weaken the yen have not been “at the
heart of the discussions” among global finance ministers
meeting in Washington this week, Moscovici said in a speech
today at the Council on Foreign Relations. He said ministers
would continue to monitor and discuss the issue.  “The G-7 probably will be or would be the right place to
make some comments and, if necessary, action,” Moscovici said.  “The general view is that currencies finally must reflect
economic fundamentals, in one country and another country, and
this also applies to Japan,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
