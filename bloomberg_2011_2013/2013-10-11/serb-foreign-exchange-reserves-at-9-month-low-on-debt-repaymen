Serbian foreign-exchange reserves
fell in September to the lowest level this year so far as the
government repaid almost 250 million euros to international
creditors, the central bank said.  The reserves dropped to 10.44 billion euros ($14.17
billion) in September from 10.69 billion euros in August,
Belgrade-based Narodna Banka Srbije said in an e-mailed
statement today. Net reserves, excluding the money commercial
lenders keep with the central bank and funds from the
 International Monetary Fund , dropped to 6.77 billion euros from
almost 7 billion euros in August.  The government repaid 151.6 million euros to international
creditors, 52 million euros to the IMF and 42.2 million euros to
bondholders as euro-denominated debt matured.  The National Bank of Serbia sold 90 million euros in
September to prop up the dinar, which depreciated a nominal 0.2
percent against the euro.  Interbank foreign-currency trading rose 11.7 percent on the
month to 687 million euros, bringing the nine-month total to
7.24 billion euros, the bank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
