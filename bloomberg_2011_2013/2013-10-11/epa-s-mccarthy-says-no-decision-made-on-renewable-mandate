The U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency has made no final decision about its proposal for
renewable fuel mandates for 2014, the agency’s administrator
said today, responding to reports about a draft the EPA had
circulated.  “The Obama administration remains firmly committed to
furthering the development of all biofuels,”  Gina McCarthy , the
EPA administrator, said in an e-mailed statement today.  A proposal from the agency dated Aug. 26 would cut the
mandate to 15.21 billion gallons for renewable fuels in 2014
instead of the 18.15 billion gallons  established by a 2007 law ,
according to a copy provided to Bloomberg. The agency would call
for the use of 13 billion gallons of conventional corn-based
ethanol and 2.21 billion gallons of advanced biofuels such as
biodiesel, down from 13.8 billion gallons and 2.75 billion
gallons respectively  this year , it said.  The administration of President  Barack Obama , which has the
ability under the law to adjust the legal requirements, could
revamp the plan before the EPA issues it in the coming weeks.
After that, the proposal would be open for comment from “all
stakeholders” before being finalized by the agency, McCarthy
said today.  Under the Renewable Fuel Standard, refiners such as  Exxon
Mobil Corp. (XOM)  must use a certain amount of those fuels each year,
with their target determined by their share of the fuel market.  The 2007 law mandates the use of 14.4 billion gallons of
corn-derived ethanol in 2014 and 15 billion in 2015. Lobbyists
for refiners such as  Valero Corp. (VLO)  say that requirement is too
high, and have pressed both Congress to scrap the entire program
and EPA to lower the requirements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
