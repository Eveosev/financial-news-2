Low  interest rates  intended to help
Europe emerge from recession aren’t creating risks of new
bubbles, Dutch Central Bank Governor Klaas Knot said today.  “In Europe I’m not too concerned about the low interest
rates,” Knot told reporters in Washington. He said the euro
area is now out of recession, a positive step as it seeks to
move past its financial and sovereign debt crisis.  Policy makers around the world need to weigh the advantages
and disadvantages of monetary policy designed to spur recovery,
he said.  “If we look at the United States, then there are some
markets, the  junk bonds  and certain corporate bond markets where
you can question where the pricing is in line with the relevant
risks,” Knot said. “These are examples of cons of the monetary
policy. But besides these cons, there are also pros of course.”  Knot declined to comment on what strategy the  Federal
Reserve  should take as it weighs when to adjust its approach.  “I don’t comment on the monetary policy of our colleague,
it should always go in that direction which is best for the
stability of the American economy and the world economy,” Knot
said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
