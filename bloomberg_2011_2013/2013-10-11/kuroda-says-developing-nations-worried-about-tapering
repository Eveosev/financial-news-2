Policy makers from some emerging
market economies voiced their concerns about the impact of an
eventual reduction in monetary stimulus from developed nations,
according to  Bank of Japan  Governor Haruhiko Kuroda.  “There were some opinions from emerging market economies
that speculation of reduced monetary stimulus from the developed
countries could lead to volatility in financial markets and
capital flows,” Kuroda said today in a press conference in
 Washington .  A month since the U.S. Federal Reserve surprised investors
by deciding not to slow its asset-purchase program, Group of 20
officials today pledged that future changes to monetary policy
would be “carefully calibrated and clearly communicated.”  Alert to complaints from  emerging markets  that they could
suffer once stimulus is withdrawn, the group promised to monitor
“spillovers” in which actions taken by one economy hurt
another.  Japanese Finance Minister Taro Aso said in a joint
appearance with Kuroda that  Japan  was praised for its policies
balancing economic growth and fiscal consolidation. He also
repeated that an inability to raise the U.S. debt ceiling would
hurt other nations as well as the U.S.  To contact the reporter on this story:
