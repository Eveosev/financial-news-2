Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew
urged European leaders to move toward a full banking union and
said some countries still need to adopt market-determined
exchange rates.  Europe ’s economic recovery “remains weak, unemployment is
high and fiscal contraction along with deleveraging in the
banking and business sectors will continue to act as headwinds
to growth,” Lew said in a statement to the International
Monetary and Financial Committee during the IMF’s meetings in
 Washington  today.  The global economy “faces headwinds from fiscal drag,
private sector deleveraging, and inadequate global
rebalancing,” Lew said. For the U.S., “our work begins at
home.” He reiterated the Obama administration’s position that
the government shutdown must end and the federal debt limit
needs to be raised.  In Europe, “further progress is also needed in moving
toward a full banking union, which includes not only a single
supervisory mechanism but also resolution authority,
recapitalization capacity, credible  deposit insurance , and some
degree of risk-sharing among members.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
