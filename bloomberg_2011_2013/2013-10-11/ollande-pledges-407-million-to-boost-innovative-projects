French President  Francois Hollande 
said the government will spend 300 million euros ($407 million)
to subsidize innovative projects and boost growth in seven
priority areas, including  energy storage  and big data.  A tender will start Dec. 1. A committee of public and
private sector experts will select projects, granting them about
200,000 euros by the end of the first quarter 2014, to
quickstart development, Hollande  told  reporters near Paris
today. The jury will award subsidies of 2 million euros or more
to the most promising projects at a later stage, provided that
private investors commit the same amount, he said.  “Tomorrow’s growth is in innovation,” Hollande said. “We
have all the assets to be leaders in 10 to 15 years.”  The plan, based on a  report  devised by the 2030 Innovation
Committee, headed by former  Areva SA (AREVA)  head  Anne Lauvergeon , aims
to revive the economy as French exporters lost market share and
corporate investment sagged amid rising taxes and red tape.
Other priority areas include rare metals recycling, seabed
mining, new vegetable proteins and chemicals and the
digitalization of health care.  Hollande last month called on executives from carmakers to
software developers and textile manufacturers to help France
make 34 new high-tech products, including an electric plane, an
ultra-low-energy-consumption car and a faster high-speed train,
within a decade.  To contact the reporter on this story:
