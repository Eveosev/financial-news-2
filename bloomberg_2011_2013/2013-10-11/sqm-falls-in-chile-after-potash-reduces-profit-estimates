Soc. Quimica & Minera de Chile SA ,
the country’s largest fertilizer producer, headed for the
longest losing streak since 2011 after its largest North
American peer reduced profit estimates on lower potash sales.  SQM fell for an eighth day, dropping 2.2 percent to 13,700
pesos at 1:09 p.m. in Santiago, the longest run of losses since
December 2011. Chile’s benchmark index advanced 0.2 percent.  Potash Corp of Saskatchewan Inc.  lowered its profit
forecast today after clients delayed purchases on expectations
that prices will continue to fall. The company, which is also
the second-largest shareholder in SQM, said third-quarter
earnings will probably be about 41 cents a share compared with a
July projection of 45 to 60 cents.  “This is making people believe that profits will be even
lower than what they expected and is pressuring the stock,”
Felipe Ruiz, an analyst at Banco de Credito & Inversiones, said
by telephone from Santiago.  The world potash market was shaken at the end of July after
OAO Uralkali, the biggest producer, exited a joint trading
venture with Belarus supplier Belaruskali that had propped up
prices of the commodity.  Analysts expect  SQM to report profit of 47 cents a share,
the average of three estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
