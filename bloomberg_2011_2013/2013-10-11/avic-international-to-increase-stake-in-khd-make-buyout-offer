Avic International Holdings Ltd. (161) , a
Hong Kong-listed unit of China’s biggest aerospace company, said
it will boost its holding in German industrial-plant builder  KHD
Humboldt Wedag International AG (KWG)  and make a buyout offer.  The Shenzhen, China-based company will buy 19 percent of
KHD from 12 sellers for 61 million euros ($83 million),
increasing its stake to 39 percent, according to a Hong Kong
stock exchange filing yesterday. MFC Industrial Ltd. is one of
the companies disposing of KHD shares.  Avic also said it will join companies owned by Singaporean
businessman Yap Lian Seng to make an offer for KHD at 6.45 euros
a share, or a total consideration of 195.5 million euros. Yap
will own 58 percent of KHD and Avic 42 percent if all holders
accept the offer.  KHD jumped 24 percent to close at 6.31 euros on Frankfurt’s
Xetra exchange after the offer was announced.  To contact the reporter on this story:
