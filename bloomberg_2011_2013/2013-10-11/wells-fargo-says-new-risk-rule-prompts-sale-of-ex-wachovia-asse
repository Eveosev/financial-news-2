Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC)  said it sold an
asset with a “ punitive  risk weighting” in the third quarter to
help boost its capital ratio under new international standards.  The structured asset inherited from Wachovia Corp. was
worth a “few billion dollars,” Tim Sloan, chief financial
officer of the San Francisco-based bank, said in an interview
today. Wells Fargo sold the asset because the amount of capital
needed to back it wasn’t worth the return, he said. The asset
was kept at the holding company and was performing, he said.  U.S. banks have been  disposing  of riskier assets and
winding down businesses to comply with rules proposed by the
 Basel Committee on Banking Supervision  designed to head off
another global credit crisis. Wells Fargo said its Basel III
Tier 1 common equity ratio, which measures equity divided by
assets adjusted for risk, stood at 9.54 percent when it reported
third-quarter results today.  “Once the rules were finalized, we looked at it and said
from a risk-return standpoint, let’s just sell this and let’s
just move on,” Sloan said. “It’s not like we have 10s and 20s
of billions of dollars of things like that lying around.”  Wells Fargo outbid  Citigroup Inc. (C)  to buy Wachovia five
years ago after the North Carolina-based lender all but
collapsed during the 2008 financial crisis. Wells Fargo is the
biggest U.S. home lender and the most valuable domestic bank by
market value.  To contact the reporter on this story:
