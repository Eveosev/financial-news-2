Japanese  shares  rose, with the  Topix (TPX) 
index capping its longest winning streak in a month, as U.S.
lawmakers said they will continue talks on raising the nation’s
debt limit to avoid a default.  Panasonic Corp., a consumer-electronics company that gets
14 percent of its sales from the Americas, added 2.8 percent.
Orix Corp. jumped 3.8 percent as consumer lenders gained the
most among the Topix’s 33 industry groups. Nikon Corp. climbed
4.2 percent after Nomura Holdings Inc. raised its rating on the
camera maker.  Fast Retailing Co. (9983) , Asia’s largest clothing
retailer, sunk 3.2 percent to lead declines on the Nikkei 225
Stock Average after its profit forecast missed estimates.  The Topix climbed 1.6 percent to 1,197.17 at the close in
 Tokyo , with all the gauge’s sectors advancing. The measure rose
2.9 percent this week after two weeks of declines. The Nikkei
225 added 1.5 percent to 14,404.74.  “The likelihood of a short-term debt ceiling increase is
looking very strong and the U.S. is unlikely to default, so
there’s some sense of security,” said Osamu Koizumi, a Tokyo-based executive officer at Meiji Yasuda Asset Management Co.,
which oversees the equivalent of $18 billion in assets. “But
there’s still a long way to go. The yen is weakening on that
now, so for the stock market, which is so sensitive to the
currency, that’s good news.”  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index were little
changed today. The U.S. equity gauge jumped 2.2 percent
yesterday, the biggest rally since January, as House Speaker
John Boehner and other party leaders went to the White House to
negotiate.  Debt Negotiations  President  Barack Obama  did not accept or reject House
Republicans’ proposal for a short-term increase in the debt
ceiling that would reduce prospects for a default. The plan
would push the lapse of U.S. borrowing authority to Nov. 22 from
Oct. 17. It wouldn’t end the partial shutdown of the federal
government, which is going into its eleventh day.  “We’re going to be continually flung around by
developments from the U.S.,” said Juichi Wako, a Tokyo-based
equity strategist at Nomura Securities Co., the nation’s biggest
brokerage. “But given it looks like they took a step forward,
extreme risk aversion is retreating.”  The yen fell 0.2 percent against the dollar to 98.40, from
as strong as 97.34 yesterday. Against the euro, the Japanese
currency fell 0.4 percent to 133.17. A weaker yen boosts
overseas earnings for exporters when repatriated.  Exporters Advance  Panasonic, which gets almost half its revenue abroad,
gained 2.8 percent to 955 yen.  Nintendo Co. (7974) , which relies on the
Americas for most its sales, added 1.5 percent to 11,420 yen.
Toyota Motor Corp., Asia’s biggest carmaker, rose 0.9 percent to
6,410 yen.  The Topix Other Financing Business Index gained 3.2 percent
for the biggest increase among Topix groups, followed by paper
makers and steel producers. Orix, which issues rental, real
estate and consumer loans, gained 3.8 percent to 1,611 yen.  Earnings per share for companies on the Topix will rise 35
percent in the next 12 months, according to analyst  estimates 
compiled by Bloomberg.  “We’re about to head full-swing into earnings season and
expectations are for companies to raise earnings one-after-another,” Nomura’s Wako said. “The condition of earnings is
improving.”  Matsuya Co. jumped 5.7 percent to 1,277 yen after the
department-store operator raised its profit forecast 43 percent
to 1 billion yen ($10.1 million). Nippon Express Co. added 3.5
percent to 497 yen on a Nikkei newspaper report that the freight
transporter’s first-half operating profit rose 10 percent to 17
billion yen as domestic demand recovered.  Broccoli Co., a publisher of manga and video games, surged
27 percent to 381 yen after half-year net income jumped 157
percent.  Fast Retailing  Among stocks that fell, Fast Retailing dropped 3.2 percent
to 33,450 yen. The maker of Uniqlo casual apparel expects net
income of 92 billion yen for the year ending August 2014,
compared with a 99.3 billion yen estimate from analysts surveyed
by Bloomberg. The retailer said discounts were hurting domestic
earnings.  The Topix traded at 1.25 times  book value  today, compared
with 2.49 for the S&P 500 and 1.74 for the Stoxx Europe 600
Index. The Japanese gauge’s 30-day historic volatility was at
18.32 today, compared with its five-year median of 19.31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
