Mexican  industrial production 
unexpectedly fell in August from the year earlier as
construction and mining activity tumbled.  Output contracted 0.7 percent, the national statistics
institute said on its website today, compared with the median
estimate for a 0.1 percent expansion from 16 economists surveyed
by Bloomberg. Construction tumbled 5.1 percent and mining output
dropped 2.2 percent. Manufacturing increased 1.6 percent and
utilities rose 1.7 percent from the year earlier.  Production expanded 0.5 percent in August from July, the
agency said, more than the 0.1 percent median estimate.  The government has cut its forecast for 2013 growth three
times this year, to 1.7 percent from 3.5 percent, after the
economy in the first half of the year expanded at the slowest
pace since 2009, exports stagnated and public spending fell.
Policy makers surprised analysts by cutting the benchmark
interest rate for a second time this year on Sept. 6, pushing it
to a record-low 3.75 percent, saying the economy suffered an
unexpected slowdown in the second quarter.  All 24 economists in a survey released by Citigroup Inc.â€™s
Banamex unit this week expect the bank to reduce borrowing costs
again by year-end after Hurricanes Ingrid and Manuel last month
left at least 157 people dead, with flooding that decimated
crops, disrupted deliveries and emptied hotels.  The peso erased its gain from before the report, falling
0.2 percent to 13.1182 per U.S. dollar at 8:21 a.m. in Mexico
City.  To contact the reporter on this story:
