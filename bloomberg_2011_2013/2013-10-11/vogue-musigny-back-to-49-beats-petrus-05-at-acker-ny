Nineteen bottles of Musigny Vieilles
Vignes Comte de Vogue Burgundy back to 1949 took top slot at an
Acker Merrall & Condit sale in  New York , beating Petrus 2005 and
La Tache 1988 Domaine de la Romanee-Conti into second place.  The Musigny, from the years between 1949 and 2004, sold for
$20,910 including fees, compared with the presale upper estimate
of $20,000, according to data on Acker’s website from the Oct. 5
sale. The lot included bottles from 1966, 1969, 1971 and 1972,
which rank among the producer’s six costliest vintages of the
past half century, according to merchant prices tracked by the
London-based Liv-ex market on its Cellar Watch website.  The demand for rarer  Bordeaux  and older Burgundy vintages
at auction is in contrast to the muted appetite in recent months
for more widely-available Bordeaux wines on the investment
market. The Liv-ex Fine Wine 50 Index has risen just 1 percent
this year, with declines since mid-March, leaving it still down
31 percent since the peak of the market in June 2011.  “Some of the Burgundies are still fetching high prices”
amid selling pressure in the broader fine wine market,  Chris Smith , an investment manager at The Wine Investment Fund in
London, said by telephone. The fund, invested in Bordeaux,
manages $50 million.  A case of La Tache ’88 DRC Burgundy and a half-case of
Petrus 2005 from Bordeaux’s Pomerol region each fetched $19,680,
while 12 bottles of Petrus 1980 sold for $15,990 and a case of
Rousseau Chambertin 1988 Burgundy and a dozen bottles of Chateau 
Mouton-Rothschild 1982 Pauillac each went for $14,760.  Following is a table of major wine auctions held so far
this year, with the total sold. Links are to auction websites or
