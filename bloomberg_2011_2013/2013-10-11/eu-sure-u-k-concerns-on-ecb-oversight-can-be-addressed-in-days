The European Commission is confident
that outstanding British concerns on a draft law to give the
European Central Bank oversight powers can be solved quickly,
commission spokeswoman  Chantal Hughes  said.  The U.K. last month invoked its right to put the bill,
already approved by  member states  and the European Parliament,
through a parliamentary scrutiny process.  “We are aware of the U.K. concerns,” Hughes, a
spokeswoman for  Michel Barnier , the EU’s financial-services
chief, said by e-mail. “We’re confident we can sort any
remaining issues in the next few days. A final agreement on the
single supervisory mechanism is imperative. We cannot afford
delay.”  EU leaders agreed last year that the ECB should be given
oversight powers as a first step to building a banking union
that would break the links between banks and sovereigns, and so
boost confidence in the bloc’s financial system.  The British concerns center on voting procedures in the
European Banking Authority, an EU agency that coordinates the
work of national regulators across the bloc, according to three
EU officials who can’t be named because the discussions aren’t
public.  The U.K. seeks a guarantee that an agreement on voting
arrangements in the EBA, reached earlier this year, won’t be
overturned, the official said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
