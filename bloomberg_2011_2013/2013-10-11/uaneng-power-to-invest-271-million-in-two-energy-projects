Huaneng Power International Inc. (902) 
plans to invest 1.66 billion  yuan  ($271 million) in a gas-power
project and a wind farm in  China  as the nation seeks to reduce
carbon-emissions from fuels such as coal.  The listed unit of China’s biggest electricity producer
plans to use bank loans and internal funds to pay for a 1.21
billion yuan gas-fired distributed power plant in the Guangxi
Zhuang Autonomous Region with generating capacity of as much as
237 megawatts, the Beijing-based company said in a statement to
the Hong Kong stock exchange today.  China, the world’s largest emitter of atmospheric
pollutants, plans to raise the proportion of power it gets from
natural gas to at least 7.5 percent in 2015 from 4.7 percent in
2012 to help pare emissions.  Huaneng also plans to spend 445 million yuan on a wind
project in  Hunan province , which will have an installed capacity
of 48 megawatts, it said. Funding will come from bank loans and
internal resources, it said.  Wind power installations around the world will drop by
almost a quarter this year to their lowest level since 2008
because of policies in  Europe  and the U.S., according to
Bloomberg New Energy Finance.  Cumulative wind capacity was almost three times that of
solar power at the end of 2012, with 278,000 megawatts of
turbines operating compared with about 104,000 megawatts of
panels, BNEF data show.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
