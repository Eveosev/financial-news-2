Tokyo Electric Power Co. (9501) , the
world’s largest power utility serving 29 million people in the
Tokyo area, received Japan’s first spot cargo of liquefied
natural gas from  Angola , ship-tracking data show.  The Lobito, with a capacity of about 155,000 cubic meters,
docked at Futtsu terminal today in Tokyo Bay, according to
transmissions captured by IHS Fairplay on Bloomberg. It was
scheduled to arrive yesterday.  The ship loaded the supercooled gas at Angola LNG’s
terminal in Soyo and departed Aug. 11, the data show.  Japan, the world’s largest buyer of LNG, doesn’t have any
long-term contracts with Angola, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The Tepco-owned Futtsu terminal has a capacity of
20.2 million metric tons a year and receives term shipments from
Indonesia, Malaysia, Qatar, Australia, Oman, Abu Dhabi, Brunei
and Russia, the data show.  The Lobito’s shipment is the third cargo produced by the
Chevron Corp.-led Angola LNG plant, which started in June. The
project’s first and second cargoes were delivered to Brazil and
 China .  To contact the reporter on this story:
