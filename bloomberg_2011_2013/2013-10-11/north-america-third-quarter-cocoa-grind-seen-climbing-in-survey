North America ’s cocoa grind, a
measure of demand, may have risen 5.1 percent in the third
quarter as chocolate makers buy the raw material to rebuild
inventories, a survey showed.  In the three months ended Sept. 30, processing probably
rose to 128,071 metric tons from 121,890 a year earlier,
according to the average of 10 analysts and traders surveyed by
 Bloomberg News .  Spot prices for  cocoa butter , a byproduct of the commodity
used in chocolate bars, rose to a five-year high of $7,904 a
metric ton on Sept. 27. Bean  stockpiles  at facilities monitored
by ICE Futures U.S. have fallen to the lowest since February,
exchange data show.  “This tells me that demand has been strong and that buyers
are willing to pay up,” Sterling Smith, a futures specialist at
Citigroup Inc. in Chicago, said in a telephone interview. “When
demand picks up in the cash market, you typically see some
tightening of warehouse inventory.”  The  National Confectioners Association  will release the
data at 4 p.m. on Oct. 17 in Washington. West Africa accounts
for about 70 percent of world production, and  Ivory Coast  and
Ghana are the biggest growers.  Cocoa prices in  New York  surged 22 percent this year
through yesterday. In the 12 months started Oct. 1, world
production may trail demand by 173,000 tons, followed by a
shortage of 113,000 the following season, according to Macquarie
Group Ltd.  To contact the reporters on this story:
