Natural gas futures jumped in New
York, capping the biggest weekly gain in almost 11 months, as
forecasts for unusually cool U.S. weather signaled an early
start to the peak heating-demand season.  Gas settled at a three-month high as below-normal
temperatures were expected from the Great Lakes to the Rocky
Mountains from Oct. 16 through Oct. 25, according to MDA Weather
Services.  Chicago ’s low on Oct. 21 may be 35 degrees Fahrenheit
(2 Celsius), 9 below normal, AccuWeather Inc.’s website showed.  “We have a bout of cold weather coming through and that’s
propping up the price,” saidEric Bickel, a natural gas analyst
at Schneider Electric in Louisville,  Kentucky . “The fourth
quarter becomes more sensitive to weather dynamics when you see
the first bit of heating load.”  Natural gas for November delivery gained 5.3 cents, or 1.4
percent, to $3.776 per million British thermal units on the New
York Mercantile Exchange, the highest settlement price since
July 19. Volume was 7.8 percent above the 100-day average at
2:35 p.m. The futures gained 7.7 percent this week, the most for
any week since Nov. 16. Gas is up 13 percent this year.  The discount of November to December futures narrowed 0.1
cent to 15.3 cents. November gas traded 24.7 cents  below  the
January contract, compared with 25.3 cents yesterday.  Gas Options  December $5 calls were the most active options in
electronic trading. They were 0.1 cent higher at 0.7 cent per
million Btu on volume of 1,410 at 3:18 p.m. Calls accounted for
59 percent of trading volume. Implied volatility for November
at-the-money options was 31.96 percent at 2:45 p.m., compared
with 30.14 percent yesterday.  The outlook turned colder for the central U.S. six to 10
days from now, said MDA in Gaithersburg,  Maryland . The Northeast
and mid-Atlantic states will see lower readings from Oct. 21
through Oct. 25.  New York City’s low on Oct. 22 may be 5 below normal at 43
degrees, according to AccuWeather in State College,
 Pennsylvania .  Almost half of U.S. households rely on gas for heating
while 39 percent use electricity, data show from the Energy
Information Administration, the statistical arm of the Energy
Department. The heating season from November through March is
the peak period for  gas consumption .  Gas inventories rose 90 billion cubic feet last week to
3.577 trillion, above the five-year average increase of 84
billion for the period, the EIA said yesterday. A  surplus  to the
five-year average widened to 1.6 percent from 1.4 percent the
previous week.  EIA Shutdown  The EIA said it would cease operations and furlough its
staff today because of the U.S. government shutdown.  Jonathan Cogan , a spokesman for the agency in  Washington , said in an e-mailed statement that “data releases and analyses will not be
published during the furlough.”  There are ample supplies of gas before the heating season,
but several weeks of report delays would increase uncertainty,
Bickel said. “It’s the worst possible time for the gas market”
to not have supply data with the advent of the peak-demand
period, he said.  U.S. gas output will increase 1.2 percent this year to
average 70 billion cubic feet a day from an all-time high of
69.18 billion in 2012, the EIA estimated in its Oct. 8  Short-Term Energy Outlook . The 2013 estimate was raised from 69.91
billion the prior month as new wells at shale deposits make up
for lower output in some dry-gas reserves.  Exelon LNG  Exelon Corp. (EXC) , the biggest U.S. nuclear generator, is
financing startup Annova LNG LLC, which plans to export
liquefied natural gas to energy importers such as South Korea
and  Chile , said two people briefed on the transaction. Annova
asked the Energy Department this week for approval to ship as
much as 7 million tons a year from a proposed Texas facility,
said the people, who asked to not be identified because the
information isn’t public.  The Energy Department has so far approved proposal from
four LNG terminals expected to come online in late 2015 through
2018. Their combined gas-processing capacity would be 6.37
billion cubic feet a day.  The number of  dry-gas rigs  fell by 9 this week to 369, the
fewest since July 26, Baker Hughes Inc. data today showed. The
rig count is down 14 percent this year.  Increased pipeline and processing capacity slated to come
online at the end of the year in the Marcellus and Utica shale
regions of the Northeast will spur production growth, Shiyang Wang, a New York-based analyst with Barclays Plc, said in a note
to clients today.  “This should keep prices range bound during the 2013-14
winter season,” averaging $3.90 per million Btu during the
final three months of this year and $4 in the first quarter of
2014, Wang said.  The U.S. produced 87 percent of its own energy in the first
six months of this year, on pace to be the highest annual rate
since 1986, EIA data show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
