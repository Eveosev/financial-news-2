Mesoblast Ltd. (MSB)  climbed the most in
eight months in Sydney trading after agreeing to buy a stem-cell
business of  Osiris Therapeutics Inc. (OSIR)  for as much as $100 million
to gain new treatments.  The maker of stem-cell therapies  rose  as much as 11
percent, the largest advance since Feb. 7, and was up 6.2
percent to A$5.82 as of 11:47 a.m. in Sydney trading.  Mesoblast will buy the mesenchymal stem-cell unit of
Osiris, including Prochymal, a treatment for acute graft versus
host disease, Columbia, Maryland-based Osiris said in a
statement. The price tag includes as much as $50 million in
payments if certain trial and regulatory milestones are met, and
Osiris may also receive royalties on sales of certain products,
Melbourne-based Mesoblast said in a separate statement today.  Prochymal has received conditional approval in  Canada  and
New Zealand for use in children with acute graft versus host
disease, and is available under an access program in the U.S.
for treating both children and adults, according to Osiris’s
statement. The illness is a  complication  that can occur after a
stem-cell or bone-marrow transplant in which the newly
transplanted donor cells attack the transplant recipient’s body,
according to Medline Plus.  To contact the reporter on this story:
