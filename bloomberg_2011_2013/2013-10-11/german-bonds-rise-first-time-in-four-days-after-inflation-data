Italy’s  government bonds  advanced
for a second day as European stocks rose on optimism U.S.
lawmakers will reach an agreement on raising the nation’s debt
limit to avert a default.  Spanish, Greek and Portuguese bonds also climbed. Italian
10-year yields fell for a second day as the nation auctioned 6
billion euros ($8.1 billion) of securities due between 2016 and
2028. German 10-year bunds advanced after European Central Bank
President  Mario Draghi  said yesterday a pledge to keep  interest
rates  low explicitly allows for cuts in borrowing costs if
market volatility resumes.  “Everyone is focusing on the U.S. and there is maybe some
relief that is spreading to risky assets like peripheral bonds
today,” said Christian Lenk, a fixed-income analyst at DZ Bank
AG in  Frankfurt . “All in all it’s a solid Italian auction,
especially for the 15-year, which saw better demand. As we’ve
seen already this week, even 30-year Spanish government bonds
are finding good demand.”  The yield on Italian 10-year bonds fell six basis points,
or 0.06 percentage point, to 4.28 percent at 4:25 p.m. London
time. The 4.5 percent security due in March 2024 rose 0.485, or
4.85 euros per 1,000-euro face amount, to 102.175.  The rate on similar-maturity Spanish debt slid four basis
points to 4.30 percent, Greek 10-year yields fell 23 basis
points to 8.85 percent, while the rate on Portuguese 10-year
bonds dropped 16 basis points to 6.24 percent.  Stocks Advance  The Stoxx Europe 600  Index (SPX)  of shares added 0.4 percent,
while the MSCI Asia Pacific Index was up 1.3 percent. The
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index was little changed after surging 2.2
percent yesterday, the biggest gain since Jan. 2.  President  Barack Obama  and House Republican leaders were
moving toward an agreement to extend the nation’s borrowing
authority even as they remained at odds over terms for ending
the partial government shutdown.  They met for 90 minutes at the White House yesterday after
House Speaker  John Boehner  of  Ohio  said he would offer a measure
to postpone a potential U.S. default to Nov. 22 from Oct. 17.
The developments were the first sign that the president and
House Republican leaders could resolve the fiscal impasse
without negative economic consequences from a default as the
halt in government operations moved into its 11th day.  Italian Auctions  The Rome-based Treasury sold 3.5 billion euros of three-year notes at an average yield of 2.25 percent, compared with a
rate of 2.72 percent at a previous auction on Sept. 12. It
allotted 15-year bonds at a yield of 4.59 percent, down from
4.88 percent last month.  Italy sold 5 billion euros of seven-year bonds via banks on
Oct. 9, while  Spain  allotted 4 billion euros of a new 30-year
benchmark security the same day.  Speaking at the Economic Club of  New York , Draghi said that
the path of policy rates also remains conditional on the outlook
for inflation,  “The Governing Council has unanimously agreed to
incorporate an easing bias that explicitly provides for further
rate reductions, should the volatility in money market
conditions return to the levels observed in early summer,”
Draghi said.  Annualized consumer-price  inflation  in  Germany , calculated
using a harmonized European Union method, was 1.6 percent last
month, the same as in August, the Federal Statistics Office in
Wiesbaden said.  Germany’s 10-year bund yield dropped two basis points to
1.85 percent after climbing to 1.88 percent, the  highest  since
Sept. 24.  Volatility on Portuguese bonds was the highest in euro-area
markets today, followed by those of Greece and Spain, according
to measures of 10-year debt, the yield spread between two- and
10-year securities, and credit-default swaps.  Italian bonds gained 5.1 percent this year through
yesterday, according to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes. Spain’s
returned 9.1 percent and Germany’s lost 2 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
