Taiwan ’s opposition party filed for
a no-confidence vote against Premier Jiang Yi-huah over
allegations he violated the constitution in the handling of a
probe into the speaker of the legislature.  The no-confidence motion, set to be held Oct. 15, requires
more than of the legislature’s support. The ruling Kuomintang
hold 65 of 112 seats in Taiwan’s Legislative  Yuan . The
opposition  Democratic Progressive Party  holds 40 seats.  Jiang’s predecessor, Sean Chen, survived a no-confidence
vote last year over his stewardship of the economy. Chen
resigned earlier this year after street protests over the
economy, and Ma appointed Jiang in February.  Su Tseng-chang, who leads the Democratic Progressive Party,
said last month Ma and Jiang violated Taiwan’s constitution in
attempting to oust parliament speaker Wang Jin-pyng from the
Kuomintang.  An appeals court upheld a temporary halt on Wang’s
expulsion, preserving his position as leader of the legislature.
Ma said on Sept. 11 that phone tap evidence showing Wang tried
to interfere in the commercial prosecution of an opposition
lawmaker made him unfit to lead.  To contact the reporter on this story:
