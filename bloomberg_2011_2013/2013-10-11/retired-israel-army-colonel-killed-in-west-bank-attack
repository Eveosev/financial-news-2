An Israeli reserve army colonel was
killed in a suspected terrorist attack that saw him bludgeoned
to death outside his  West Bank  home, according to a military
spokesman.  The Israeli army established checkpoints across the
northern Jordan River Valley region in order to locate the
perpetrators and security personnel were searching the area,
according to a text message sent by the army to journalists
today. The army said the man’s wife saw two Palestinians attack
her husband and said the assault was motivated by nationalism.
Even so, other possibilities are being examined, it said.  The incident occurred less than a week after a nine-year-old Israeli girl was slightly injured when she was stabbed while
playing in the West Bank settlement of Psagot. That followed a
series of attacks in the West Bank at the end of September, when
an Israeli soldier was killed by a Palestinian who had worked
with him at a restaurant in the coastal city of Bat Yam. Two
days later, another soldier was shot by a Palestinian sniper in
Hebron.  According to Israel Police spokesman Mickey Rosenfeld, the
officer’s wife told security forces her husband was
investigating a disturbance outside their home around 1 a.m.
this morning and was attacked by men armed with iron bars and
axes. IDF forces detained five Palestinian suspects while
combing the area, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
