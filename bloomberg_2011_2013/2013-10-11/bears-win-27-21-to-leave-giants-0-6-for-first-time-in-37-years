The  Chicago  Bears won 27-21 to leave
the New York Giants winless through the first six games of a
National Football League season for the first time in 37 years.  Brandon Marshall caught two touchdown passes last night as
the Bears ended a four-game losing skid against New York at
Soldier Field in Chicago to improve to 4-2. The Giants, who won
the Super Bowl two years ago, haven’t had a worse start since
they lost the first nine games of the 1976 season.  “Good win, we got a little banged up so we’ve got some
time to get healthy for next week,” Chicago quarterback Jay Cutler told the NFL Network in a televised interview. “We’re
playing well, we just got to keep getting better.”  The opening drive ended after 53 seconds with Eli Manning’s
league-worst 13th interception of the season. The Giants escaped
unscathed as the Bears failed on a fourth-and-two play at New
York’s 4-yard line.  Five plays later, Tim Jennings picked off another Manning
pass and returned the ball 48 yards for a touchdown.  On the Giants’ next possession, Manning tossed two 16-yard
passes and another of 17 yards as New York advanced to Chicago’s
4-yard line. Brandon Jacobs then bulldozed his way in for the
tying score, taking his contribution on the drive to 28 yards on
five carries.  The Giants, who entered the game with a league-low average
of 56.8 yards rushing per game, ran for 56 yards on their
opening three drives.  Cutler then marched the Bears 86 yards on eight plays,
culminating with a 10-yard pass to Marshall for a touchdown.  Marshall’s Second  New York countered again as Manning threw a deep pass to
Rueben Randle, who shook off two defenders to complete a 37-yard
scoring play.  The touchdown sequence continued on the next possession as
Cutler found Marshall from three yards for his second touchdown
catch of the game to make it 21-14 to Chicago. Robbie Gould then
kicked a 40-yard field goal to give Chicago a 24-14 lead at
halftime.  After Gould kicked a 52-yard field goal early in the third
period, Jacobs, who ended the game with 106 yards on 22 carries,
barreled into the end zone for a second time for a one-yard
score at the end of the quarter to make it 27-21 for Chicago.  New York’s chances evaporated when Jennings got his second
interception on Manning’s third pick of the game with less than
two minutes remaining.  To contact the reporter on this story:
