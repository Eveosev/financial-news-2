U.S. Secretary of State  John Kerry 
arrived in Afghanistan today on an unannounced visit to discuss
a pending security pact between the nations with Afghan
President  Hamid Karzai .  Kerry and Karzai agreed during an Oct. 5 phone call that a
visit to Kabul now by the top U.S. diplomat would be useful to
inject momentum into negotiations over a U.S.-Afghan Bilateral
Security Agreement before the Oct. 31 target date for reaching a
deal, two U.S. officials traveling with Kerry said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
