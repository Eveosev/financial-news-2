Ethanol fell for the first time in
five days after the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said it
may scale back requirements on its use. Renewable Identification
Numbers, or RINs, sank to the lowest since February.  The biofuel tumbled 0.6 percent. A proposal from the EPA
would cut the mandate to 15.21 billion gallons for renewable
fuels in 2014 from 18.15 billion established by a 2007 law,
according to an internal document provided to Bloomberg.  The agency would call for the use of 13 billion gallons of
conventional corn-based ethanol and 2.21 billion gallons of
advanced biofuels, down from 13.8 billion and 2.75 billion
respectively this year, according to the proposal. RINs, which
rose to a record $1.43 a gallon on July 18, are certificates
attached to each gallon of biofuel that are submitted to the
government and can be traded among companies.  “The whole focus right now is the EPA,” said Justin Dirico, manager of the biofuels desk at Eagle Energy Brokers LLC
in New York. “There’s a rumor they’re going to reduce the 2014
requirements, which will affect ethanol further down the curve
but we’re still seeing a bit of the effect today. Producers are
locking in positive margins now.”  Denatured ethanol for November delivery dropped 1.1 cents
to settle at $1.718 a gallon on the  Chicago  Board of Trade.
Futures are down 22 percent this year.  RINs for 2013 slumped 12 cents to 30 cents a gallon, the
lowest level since Feb. 19, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. That compares with a value of 7 cents at the end of
2012. Advanced RINs, which cover biodiesel and Brazilian
sugarcane-based ethanol, dropped 10 cents to 42 cents a gallon.  Easier Mandate  “If the mandate will be a lot easier to achieve, I can
assume there won’t be a lot of demand for RINs,” Christina McGlone, a strategist at Deutsche Bank AG, said today in a
telephone interview from Greenwich,  Connecticut .  The proposal, dated Aug. 26, just days before a plan was
officially submitted to the White House for review, may be
revamped before going into law.  “At this point, EPA is only developing a draft proposal,”
Gina McCarthy, administrator of the EPA, said in a statement.
“The agency has made no final decision on the proposed
renewable fuel standards for 2014.”  Under the current renewable fuels standard, refiners such
as  Valero Energy Corp. (VLO) , the world’s largest independent refining
company, and Exxon Mobil Corp. must use a certain amount of
those fuels each year, with their target determined by their
share of the fuel market.  Valero Costs  Bill Klesse , Valero’s chief executive officer, wrote the
EPA on Sept. 9 asking it to waive volume requirements under the
program, citing higher costs for RINs.  Refiners retain the certificates to show compliance or to
trade it to another party. At the time, RINs had increased
because of falling gasoline demand and higher biofuel
consumption targets.  “Any relief from the Renewable Fuel Standard would be
welcome and appreciated, but Valero’s RINs costs for this year
are still expected to be between $600 million and $800
million,” said Bill Day, a company spokesman based in San
Antonio.  Gasoline for November delivery sank 3 cents, or 1.1
percent, to settle at $2.6681 a gallon on the New York
Mercantile Exchange.  Ethanol’s discount  to gasoline narrowed 1.9 cents to 95.01
cents a gallon. The spread settled yesterday at the highest
level since Sept. 13.  In cash market trading, ethanol rose 8 cents to $2.205 a
gallon on the U.S. West Coast, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The biofuel added 3 cents on the Gulf Coast to $2.18,
3 cents in Chicago to $2.08 and 1.5 cents in New York to $2.315.  New York’s premium to Chicago narrowed 1.5 cents to 23.5
cents a gallon, while the West Coast traded at a premium of 2.5
cents to the Gulf Coast, from a discount of 2.5 cents yesterday.  To contact the reporters on this story:
