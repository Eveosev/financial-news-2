At 15,  Benjamin Franklin ’s youngest
sister, Jane, got married. He’d helped her learn to read, but
she was never a facile writer.  At the same age, young Ben was working on his brother’s
paper, the New-England Courant. To get published, he assumed a
pen name, becoming the perspicacious widow Silence Dogood.  (To listen to the podcast, click  here .)  In her fortnightly letters, Mrs. Dogood let it be known
that she hated hoop skirts, was “a mortal enemy to arbitrary
government and unlimited power” and made scathing remarks about
Harvard alumni.  Ben was so convincing as the widow, offers of marriage
rolled in. But this was just the beginning -- he went on to
become the most famous American on the planet.  Poor and obscure, Jane had a dozen children and didn’t
leave her small domestic circle. Ben never mentioned her in his
autobiography.  I spoke with Jill Lepore, author of “Book of Ages: The
Life and Opinions of Jane Franklin,” on the following topics:  1. Reading & Writing.  2. A Room of One’s Own.  3. Revolutionary Widow.  4. Correspondence.  5. Book of Ages.  To buy this book in North America, click  here .  ( Lewis Lapham  is the founder of  Lapham’s Quarterly  and the
former editor of Harper’s magazine. He hosts “The World in
