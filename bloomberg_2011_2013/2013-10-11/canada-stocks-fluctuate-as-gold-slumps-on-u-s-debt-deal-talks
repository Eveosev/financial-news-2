Canadian  stocks  fell, after climbing
the most since July yesterday, as the jobless rate unexpectedly
slipped to a five-year low while gold producers sank amid
speculation the U.S. will avoid a default.  Goldcorp Inc. and Barrick Gold Corp. slumped at least 3.1
percent as the price of the metal sank to the lowest since July.
Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc. lost 1.6 percent after cutting
its profit forecast after buyer estimates of lower prices
delayed sales.  Peregrine Diamonds Ltd. (PGD)  plunged 35 percent after
De Beers told the company it wouldn’t exercise its right to
acquire control of Peregrine’s Chidliak project in the Arctic.
 Tricon Capital Group Inc. (TCN)  jumped 8 percent after being named a
“top pick” by an analyst at  RBC Capital Markets .  The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index (SPTSX)  fell 2.30 points,
or less than 0.1 percent, to 12,892.11 at 4 p.m. in Toronto, for
a weekly gain of 1.1 percent. The index is up 3.7 percent this
year. Trading volume was 23 percent lower compared with the 30-day average.  “Now that the chances of a deal getting done have risen,
the demand for actual gold is weakening,” said Anish Chopra,
 fund manager  with TD Asset Management Inc. in Toronto. He helps
manage C$216 billion ($208 billion). “They’re talking now, but
we don’t know the details. If over a shorter time frame there
are no announcements of anything concrete, the market will take
that as a negative. There needs to be follow-through.”  Unemployment (CANLXEMR)  in Canada declined to 6.9 percent in September
from 7.1 percent a month earlier, the lowest since December
2008, as young people dropped out of the labor market,
 Statistics Canada  said.  Job creation  slowed to 11,900 from
59,200 in August. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg had projected
a 10,000 job increase and an unchanged jobless rate.  Debt Deal  U.S. President  Barack Obama  met with Senate Republicans
today as the two sides move closer to a deal to raise the debt
limit ahead of a potential default on Oct. 17. Senator  Orrin Hatch  of  Utah  said Obama is open to changing a tax on medical
devices in the future. Both sides are weighing a potential
short-term increase in the debt limit that would postpone a
default to Nov. 22.  Barrick Gold dropped 3.9 percent to C$17.81 and Goldcorp
lost 3.1 percent to C$24.48 as raw-materials producers sank 1.8
percent as a group, most in the S&P/TSX.  The S&P/TSX Gold Index retreated 3.4 percent to a three-month low as all 24 stocks in the measure declined. Gold for
December delivery fell 2.2 percent to $1,268.20 an ounce in  New
York , the lowest since July 10. Gold, seen as a safe haven for
investors in volatile markets, has plunged 24 percent this year
and fell for a second straight week.  Potash Forecast  Potash Corp., North America’s largest producer of the
fertilizer, slid 1.6 percent to C$32.46. The company said
yesterday that third-quarter  earnings  would be about 41 cents a
share, down from the 45 to 60 cents estimated in July. The
company is expected to officially release its earnings on Oct.
24.  TMX Group Ltd. (X) , owner of the Toronto Stock Exchange,
tumbled 6.2 percent to C$43.15, the most since at least
September 2012. Jeff Fenwick, analyst with Cormark Securities
Inc., lowered his rating for the stock to  reduce , the equivalent
of sell, on continued weak trading volumes and financing in the
third quarter.  “We have yet to see evidence of any cyclical improvement
in TMX’s various operating segments,” Fenwick said in a report.  Peregrine Diamonds sank 35 percent to 43 Canadian cents,
its biggest loss ever, after being notified by  De Beers  of its
decision not to form a joint venture at Chidliak, the company
said. De Beers would have helped fund a feasibility study of the
diamond project in Nunavut.  Tricon Rating  Tricon Capital, a residential real estate asset manager,

price target of C$9.50. Tricon has four buys, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Air Canada (AC/B) , the nation’s largest airline, climbed 1.6
percent to C$4.97 for a third day of gains and extended a five-year high. Air Canada is the best-performing stock in the

reporting better-than-forecast  earnings .  To contact the reporter on this story:
