European Union carbon permits had
their biggest weekly decline since May 10 after the  European
Investment Bank  said it will sell allowances from the 28-nation
bloc’s reserves.  Carbon for December dropped 3.1 percent today to close at
4.62 euros ($6.25) a metric ton on the ICE Futures Europe
exchange in  London , the seventh decline and the longest daily
losing streak since July 2012. The contract fell 9.6 percent
this week.  The EIB in Brussels said Oct. 8 it will start selling in
November 100 million tons of allowances from a reserve set aside
for new entrants to the EU’s emissions trading system,
equivalent to about 5 percent of annual supply. That will start
hitting the market just as the EU may begin handing out its
allocation of free permits for 2013, U.K. government data show.  “The combination of these two could be quite
significant,” Matteo Mazzoni, an analyst at NE Nomisma Energia
Srl in Bologna,  Italy , said by phone today. The impact from the
EIB sales may be “yet to come.”  Carbon has fallen in the last quarter of each of the past
five years. Unless EU policymakers make progress on fixing a
surplus of permits, the price may decline below 4 euros by the
end of the year, Mazzoni said.  United Nations Certified Emission Reductions for December
dropped 3.6 percent today to close at 53 euro cents a ton, the
third weekly decline. Emission Reduction Units for December
climbed 6.7 percent to 32 cents a ton, the first gain since Oct.
