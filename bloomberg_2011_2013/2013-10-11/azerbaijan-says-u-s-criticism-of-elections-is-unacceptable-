Azerbaijan ’s Foreign Ministry
rejected as “unacceptable” U.S. criticism of the Caspian Sea
nation’s Oct. 9 presidential election that gave incumbent
candidate  Ilham Aliyev  another five-year term.  “This approach brings into question the sincerity of the
U.S. in its relations with Azerbaijan,” the ministry said today
on its  website . “Being fully biased and unacceptable, it also
amounts to disrespect for Azeri citizens who freely expressed
their will in the election,” the ministry said.  Aliyev, 51, won a third term with 84.6 percent of the
votes, the Central Election Commission in Baku said yesterday.
Camil Hasanli, the candidate backed by opposition parties, got
5.5 percent and eight other contenders divided up the remaining
ballots.  Marie Harf, a spokeswoman for the Department of State,
yesterday said that the U.S. agreed with an assessment by the
57-nation Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe
that the elections “fell short of international standards” and
were undermined by “serious shortcomings.”  “The  United States  urges the government of Azerbaijan to
respect the freedoms of peaceful assembly, association, and
speech,” Harf said in a  statement .  Azerbaijan, the largest oil producer in the former  Soviet
Union  after Russia and Kazakhstan, is a U.S. ally, handling 30
percent of all non-military shipments to  Afghanistan . The Muslim
nation of 9 million between Russia and Iran also operates the
only non-Russian outlet of Caspian oil to Europe.  To contact the reporter on this story:
