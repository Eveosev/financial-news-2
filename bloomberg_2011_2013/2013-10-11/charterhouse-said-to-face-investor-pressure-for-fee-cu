Charterhouse Capital Partners LLP,
manager of a 4 billion-euro ($5.4 billion) private-equity fund,
is under pressure to cut the fees it charges as it seeks more
time to spend the fund it raised four years ago, two people with
knowledge of the matter said.  The firm plans to  ask investors  next month to extend the
fund’s investment period, which expires in March, by a further
12 months, said the people who asked not to be identified
because they weren’t authorized to speak publicly. Charterhouse
has spent about 2.5 billion euros of it so far, the people said.  Private-equity firms typically pool money from pension
plans and endowments for a 10-year period with companies bought
within the first five years and sold over the second five. They
get to keep 20 percent of the profit from investments and, in
Charterhouse’s case, charge investors an annual management fee
equivalent to 1.5 percent of the fund, or 60 million euros.  In informal talks with Charterhouse, a group of the fund’s
major investors has pressed the firm to base the management fee
on the amount the firm has spent instead of the total value of
the fund, the people said. That would cut Charterhouse’s fee by
about 12.5 million euros.  Gary Sunderland, a spokesman for Charterhouse based in
 London , declined to comment. Charterhouse Capital Partners IX
had a net internal rate of return of 8.3 percent as of June 30,
according to  figures published  by the Florida Retirement System,
an investor.  To contact the reporter on this story:
