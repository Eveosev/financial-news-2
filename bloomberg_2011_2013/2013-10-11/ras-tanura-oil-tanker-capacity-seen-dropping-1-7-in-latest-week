The combined carrying capacity of
 oil tankers  calling at  Saudi Arabia ’s Ras Tanura declined 1.7
percent in the week ended Oct. 5, vessel-tracking data compiled
by Bloomberg show.  The implied capacity of vessels calling at the world’s
largest crude-export complex fell to the equivalent of 9.17
million barrels a day from 9.33 million barrels for the prior
week, according to signals gathered by IHS Maritime, a Coulsdon,
England-based research company. The data may be incomplete
because not all transmissions are captured.  The Ras Tanura complex, including Ras al-Ju’aymah, is the
biggest global crude terminal, according to the website of Saudi
Arabian Oil Co., known as  Saudi Aramco . Tankers hauling crude
from the  Persian Gulf  may call at other loading ports before or
after Ras Tanura, indicating they might have collected partial
cargoes elsewhere.  The table below lists the destination countries of tankers
calling at Ras Tanura in the latest week as of about 10:30 a.m.
London time. The percentages represent the share of the total
number of ships loading at the terminal that each country is due
to receive.  Very large crude carriers are assumed to carry 2 million
barrels apiece, twice as much as Suezmax tankers. The tally
excludes vessels smaller than Aframaxes, each holding about
650,000 barrels.  To contact the reporter on this story:
