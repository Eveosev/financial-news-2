Spot diesel fuel in the U.S.
Midcontinent slumped to the biggest discount in more than eight
months as the  slowest corn harvest  in four years crimped
farmers’ demand for the fuel.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel  in Group 3, the region spanning
north from Tulsa, Oklahoma, to  Minnesota  and North Dakota,
weakened 0.63 cent to 3 cents below futures on the  New York 
Mercantile Exchange at 2:33 p.m., the largest discount since
Jan. 25, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Demand for diesel, which usually peaks during the months
from September to November when farmers use the fuel to power
combines, is materializing slower this year as farmers wait to
harvest crops planted late because of wet weather conditions,
said Steve Mosby, vice president of supply consultant ADMO
Energy LLC in Kansas City, Missouri.  The corn harvest was  12 percent complete  on Sept. 27, the
smallest amount for the time of year since 2009, according to
U.S. Department of Agriculture data compiled by Bloomberg.
 Soybean collection  was 11 percent done, compared with 41 percent
last year, the data showed. Scheduled updates of the estimates
are delayed because of the federal government’s  extended
shutdown .  The  3-2-1 crack spread  in Group 3, a rough measure of
refining margins based on West Texas Intermediate oil in
Cushing,  Oklahoma , dropped for the first time in five days. The
differential fell 19 cents to $12.09 a barrel, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
