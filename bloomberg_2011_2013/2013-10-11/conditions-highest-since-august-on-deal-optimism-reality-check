Financial conditions improved to the
strongest level since August as Republican and Democratic
congressional leaders worked on a short-term budget agreement
that diminishes the risk of a government debt default next week.  The  Bloomberg U.S. Financial Conditions Index (BFCIUS)  rose 0.07 to
1.467, the strongest level since Aug. 13. The gauge measures
stress in the markets by combining everything from money-market
rates to yields on government and corporate bonds to volatility
in equities. During the debt-ceiling debate of August 2011, the
index fell as low as negative 1.631.  “It seems there is progress being made toward resolution
and the risk of default on the part of the  U.S. Treasury  has
eased, or at least postponed,” said  Christopher Sullivan , who
oversees $2.25 billion as chief investment officer at the United
Nations Federal Credit Union in New York. “Although there is
still uncertainty about the process, there is optimism that the
political fears will give way to some type of agreement.”  House Republicans  offered a plan to raise the U.S. debt
limit and end a partial government shutdown that would require
the President  Barack Obama  to accept policy conditions attached
to a spending measure, said two congressional aides.  Republicans sent a list of policy options to the White
House following a meeting yesterday, said the aides, who spoke
on condition of anonymity. Obama has insisted that he won’t
accept conditions for ending the shutdown, which is in its 11th
day.  Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew said before Congress
yesterday that the U.S. needs to boost the debt limit by Oct. 17
or risk defaulting on its payments.  Treasuries  Rates on debt due on Nov. 29 rose four basis points, or
0.04 percentage point, to 0.16 percent as of 5 p.m.  New York 
time, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices, after adding
eight basis points yesterday. They were negative Sept. 26.  The rate on $120 billion in bills due Oct. 17 dropped 11
basis points to 0.20 percent after touching 0.51 percent
yesterday. The rate on $93 billion in bills due Oct. 24 fell
five basis points to 0.26 percent after climbing as high as 0.50
percent yesterday.  Treasury 10-year note yields rose one basis point to 2.69
percent, raising a weekly increase to four basis points. The
price of the 2.5 percent security due in August 2023 fell 1/32,
or 31 cents per $1,000 face value, to 98 12/32.  Rate Derivatives  The U.S. two-year interest-rate swap spread, a measure of
debt-market stress, fell 0.75 basis point to 12.63 basis points.
The gauge typically narrows when investors favor assets such as
corporate bonds and widens when they seek the perceived safety
of  government securities . The measure has dropped from this
year’s high of 19.55 on June 21.  Credit  A gauge of U.S. company credit risk fell. The Markit CDX
North American Investment Grade Index, a credit-default swaps
benchmark that investors use to hedge against losses or to
speculate on creditworthiness, fell 4.8 basis points to a mid-price of 78.74 basis points, according to prices compiled by
Bloomberg. The index, which typically climbs as investor
confidence in credit deteriorates and falls as it improves, has
averaged 81.8 this year.  Currencies  The Bloomberg U.S.  Dollar Index , which tracks the greenback
against 10 major currencies, fell 0.1 percent to 1,012.38. The
index has traded in a range of 1,007.9 and 1,038.63 the past
three months. The greenback gained 0.4 percent to 98.58 yen. The
Japanese currency weakened 0.6 percent to 133.51 per euro.  Stocks  The  Standard & Poor’s 500  increased 0.6 percent to
1,703.20, erasing losses since the start of the government’s
partial shutdown that began Oct. 1. The  Dow Jones Industrial
Average  climbed 111.04 points, or 0.7 percent, to 15,237.11.  Volatility  The  CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) , or VIX, fell 4.6 percent to
15.72, after approaching its closing high for the year of 20.49
in June and compared with a low of 11.3 in March. Volatility in
Treasuries as measured by the Bank of America Merrill Lynch MOVE
index fell to 80.08 yesterday, compared with the average this
year is 72.3.  Currency swings as measured by the JPMorgan Global
Volatility Index fell for a second day to 8.41, versus a 2013
average of 9.38.  Energy, Commodities  West Texas Intermediate crude oil for November delivery
slid $1.24, or 1.2 percent, to $101.77 a barrel on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange .  Gold futures for December delivery fell 1.9 percent to
$1,272.10 an ounce on the Comex in New York. Prices dropped 2.9
percent this week amid speculation that the Federal shutdown
that has furloughed 800,000 workers would be short-lived.  Copper futures for delivery in December rose 0.7 percent to
$3.2725 a pound on the Comex in New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
