SolarCity Corp. (SCTY) , the U.S. rooftop-solar power provider that’s risen fivefold since its initial
public offering in December, expects to boost annual installed
capacity almost 90 percent next year.  SolarCity plans to deploy 475 megawatts to 525 megawatts of
photovoltaic projects in 2014, up from an estimated 278
megawatts this year, the San Mateo, California-based company
said today in a statement. The stock rose 23 percent to $47.18
at the close in New York, the biggest gain since May 17.  Demand is surging for residential solar projects financed
by SolarCity and peers including Sunrun Inc. and Sungevity Inc.,
which install rooftop projects at little to no upfront cost to
customers. In  California , the top solar market, 68 percent of
new residential projects were  installed  through these
arrangements in the second quarter, up from 48 percent two years
earlier, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association.  SolarCity installed 78 megawatts in the third quarter, and
now has 72,506 power contracts that will provide about $1.74
billion in revenue over their lifetimes. The company owns the
rooftop projects and customers sign long-term agreements to buy
the electricity. It’s targeting 1 million customers, or 6,000
megawatts installed, within five years.  To contact the reporters on this story:
