Fannie Mae , the government-controlled mortgage-finance company, is seeking to sell its
first notes tied to the risk of homeowner defaults at lower
relative yields than those offered in  Freddie Mac ’s debut deal,
according to a person with knowledge of the transaction.  A $337.5 million, BBB- rated slice of the debt may pay
about 2.25 percentage points more than the one-month London
interbank offered rate, said the person, who asked not to be
named because the terms aren’t set. A riskier $337.5 million
unrated portion may price at a spread of 5.75 percentage points
more than the benchmark. Freddie Mac sold similar bonds at
spreads of 3.4 percentage points and 7.15 percentage points more
than Libor in July.  U.S. regulators see the notes as a way to reduce the
dominance of the two government-controlled firms and assess if
they’re charging enough to guarantee their traditional mortgage
bonds, embracing a risk-sharing approach that may play a central
role in the future of the $9.3 trillion U.S. mortgage market.  The deal by Washington-based  Fannie Mae (FNMA)  may be completed
early next week, the person said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
