New York  Jets tight end Kellen Winslow Jr. was given a four-game suspension without pay for
violating the National Football League’s performance-enhancing
drug policy.  Winslow, in his first season with the Jets, will be
eligible to return to the team Nov. 4, the day after the Jets’
game against the New Orleans Saints, the league said in a
statement distributed by the team. Details of the violation
weren’t disclosed.  Winslow said “it came as a huge surprise” when he was
told he had tested positive for a banned substance.  “I have investigated all possible sources since learning
of the positive test, including possible medical causes, but
frustratingly, I do not know the source,” he said in a
statement. “I do not take supplements that list any banned
ingredients, but the NFL policy is very strict, so I am
accountable for the results.”  The 30-year-old Winslow has 17 catches, the most on the 3-2
team, for 169 yards and two touchdowns this season.  A 2007 Pro Bowl participant, he has 455 career receptions
and 25 touchdowns since being selected sixth overall by the
Cleveland Browns in the 2004 NFL draft. He’s also played for the
Tampa Bay Buccaneers and New England Patriots.  Winslow played just two games after breaking his leg during
his rookie season and missed the entire 2005 campaign after
injuring himself in a motorcycle accident.  The Jets host the Pittsburgh Steelers on Oct. 13 and the
New England Patriots on Oct. 20, then play at the Cincinnati
Bengals on Oct. 27.  To contact the reporter on this story:
