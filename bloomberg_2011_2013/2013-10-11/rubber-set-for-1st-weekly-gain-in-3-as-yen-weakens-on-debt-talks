Rubber is heading for the first
weekly climb in three as optimism grew that U.S. lawmakers will
lift the debt ceiling to avert a default, weakening  Japan ’s
currency and boosting the appeal of yen-based futures.  The contract for March delivery rose as much as 2.7 percent
to 266.3 yen a kilogram ($2,709 a metric ton) on the Tokyo
Commodity Exchange, the highest level since Oct. 1. Futures
traded at 265.5 yen at 10:17 a.m. and gained 4.4 percent this
week, the first rally since five days through Sept. 20.  The yen dropped to 98.37 per dollar, the lowest level this
month. Talks between Republican lawmakers and President  Barack
Obama  will continue as they try to seek a “path forward” on
the debt ceiling, according to Republican House Majority Leader
 Eric Cantor . The White House said “no specific determination
was made” during an initial 90-minute meeting between the
parties in Washington.  “Optimism that the U.S. will avert a default spurred
investors to buy back riskier assets,” said  Kazuhiko Saito , an
analyst at broker Fujitomi Co. “A weaker yen is another support
to futures in Tokyo.”  Rubber for January delivery on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange rose 0.7 percent to 20,450  yuan  ($3,344) a ton
yesterday.  Thai rubber  free-on-board fell 0.3 percent to 79.25
baht ($2.52) a kilogram yesterday, according to the Rubber
Research Institute of Thailand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
