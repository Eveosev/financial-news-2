Consol Energy Inc. (CNX) , the largest U.S.
coal producer by market value, rose the most in more than two
months after saying it’s continuing to review its structure and
is considering “all options” to unlock value.  Consol gained 2.9 percent to $37.86 at 3:05 p.m. It earlier
climbed as much as 6.6 percent, the biggest intraday increase
since July 25.  The Canonsburg, Pennsylvania-based company commented today
in a statement. Consol may sell coal mines or other assets and
four or five parties are bidding, industry newsletter Coal &
Energy Price Report said yesterday, without saying where it got
the information.  Consol produces coal from reserves in Pennsylvania,  West
Virginia , Virginia and Utah, and natural gas from the Marcellus
and other shale deposits. It first said in July it was looking
at its corporate structure to boost the share price.  The options Consol is looking at include the sale of
infrastructure and lower-quality gas assets, a possible
restructuring as a master limited partnership, and separating
the coal businesses, David Gagliano, an analyst at Barclays Plc
in New York, said in a Sept. 13 note.  Master limited partnerships are structured to pay cash to
unitholders, shielding the partnership from corporate taxes.
Many MLPs are energy-related because  tax code  limits the
structure primarily to natural-resources businesses.  To contact the reporter on this story:
