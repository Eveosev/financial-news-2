Palm oil  retreated for the first
time in six days on speculation that imports from India, the
world’s biggest buyer, will decline before the country’s record
oilseed harvest.  The contract for delivery in December slid as much as 0.6
percent to 2,376 ringgit ($747) a metric ton on the Bursa
 Malaysia  Derivatives, the biggest drop since Oct. 4. Futures
traded at 2,378 ringgit by the midday break, trimming this
week’s gain to 3.2 percent, the biggest such advance since the
five days ended Aug. 16. Palm for physical delivery in October
was at 2,380 ringgit yesterday, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  India’s imports probably fell 22 percent to 650,000 tons in
September from a year earlier, according to a Bloomberg survey.
The Solvent Extractors’ Association of  India  will release data
next week. India is on the cusp of the biggest oilseed crop ever
as production of soybeans and peanuts increases, according to
Atul Chaturvedi, chief executive officer of Adani Wilmar Ltd.  Prices declined “as demand from India slowed before the
new oilseed crop harvest,” said Gnanasekar Thiagarajan, a
director at Commtrendz Risk Management Services in Mumbai.  Inventories in Malaysia, the world’s second-biggest
producer, increased 7 percent to 1.78 million tons last month
from August and output gained 10 percent to 1.91 million tons,
Malaysian Palm Oil Board data showed yesterday.  Soybeans for delivery in November dropped 0.2 percent to
$12.8525 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, while  soybean
oil  for December slid 0.7 percent to 40.95 cents a pound.  Refined palm oil for January delivery was unchanged at
5,610  yuan  ($917) a ton on the  Dalian Commodity Exchange  and
soybean oil declined 0.3 percent to 7,072 yuan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
