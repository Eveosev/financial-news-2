Light Louisiana Sweet oil’s discount
to European benchmark Brent fell to a 16-month low as more shale
production made its way to the  Gulf Coast  while refinery
maintenance reduced crude demand in the region.  LLS, the light, sweet benchmark on the Gulf Coast, weakened
by $1.24 to a discount of $6.81 a barrel to Brent at 2:03 p.m.,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It’s the largest
discount since May 24, 2012.  Refineries in Louisiana and  Texas  with a combined capacity
of 2.3 million barrels a day are undergoing maintenance during
October, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “It’s been underpinned by a huge amount of refinery
maintenance and outages,” said Amrita Sen, chief oil analyst
for Energy Aspects Ltd. in  London . “That’s really been a
problem for LLS.”  The  Louisiana Offshore Oil Port , the largest waterborne
petroleum import terminal in the U.S., received 140,000 barrels
of Texas crude a day in July, according to data from the state’s
Department of Natural Resources.  LOOP received its first tanker of domestic crude in August
2012 after making modifications to one of its three offshore
buoys to allow receipts from smaller domestic vessels, such as
those carrying Eagle Ford crude out of Texas.  The Port of  Corpus Christi  in Texas shipped out 367,535
barrels of crude a day in August, up 91 percent from that month
in 2012, according to data on the port’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
