Yue Xiu Group, a trading arm of
 China ’s Guangzhou city government, is obtaining a $1 billion
short-term loan to finance its potential bid for part of  Chong
Hing Bank Ltd. (1111) , three people familiar with the matter said.  The four banks providing the one-year loan are  Bank of
Taiwan , DBS Bank Ltd., Mega International Commercial Bank Co.
Ltd. and Nomura Holdings Inc., the people said, asking not to be
identified because the details are private. The bridge facility
will initially pay interest of about 300 basis points more than
the London interbank offered rate, the people said.  Liu Chong Hing Investment Ltd. (194) , Chong Hing Bank’s
controlling shareholder, said this week Hong Kong’s smallest
family-run lender remained in talks with Yue Xiu Group and other
independent third parties on a possible stake sale. Chong Hing
Bank, in which the founding Liu family controls about 60
percent, said in August it had been approached by potential
buyers of interests.  Yue Xiu Group’s Guangzhou-based spokesperson didn’t answer
two phone calls or reply immediately to an e-mail seeking
comment on the financing today. Chong Hing Bank’s shares were
trading 0.2 percent higher at HK$33.15 as of 1:04 p.m. in  Hong
Kong .  Chong Hing Bank Chief Executive Officer Lau Wai-man said in
March the lender was open to proposals from prospective buyers
for all or part of the bank. Takeover speculation has mounted
since November, when Lau became the first CEO from outside the
Liu family.  To contact the reporter on this story:
