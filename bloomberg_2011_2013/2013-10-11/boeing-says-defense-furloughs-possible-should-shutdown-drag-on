Boeing Co. (BA)  said it may furlough
workers at its defense, space and security unit should the U.S.
government’s partial shutdown continue.  Workforce reductions could be triggered by customers
issuing stop-work orders, limited access to federal
installations where its employees work, funding cuts or a
shortage of government inspectors, Dan Beck, a Boeing spokesman,
said in an e-mail yesterday. He declined to say how many
employees may be idled.  The unit accounted for about 40 percent of Boeing’s $81.7
billion in 2012  revenue . The partial closing of government
operations began Oct. 1 with furloughs of about 800,000 federal
workers. Federal agencies award more than $500 billion a year,
or a rough average of $1.4 billion a day, to tens of thousands
of contractors.  Large contractors, such as Boeing, whose workers deal with
many shuttered agencies, are feeling the effects of the stoppage
even after the Pentagon recalled about 90 percent of its 350,000
furloughed employees on Oct. 5, said  Howard Rubel , a New York-based defense and aerospace analyst with Jefferies LLC.  “It’s no different from the paper boy,” Rubel said in a
phone interview. “If the guy you’re giving the paper isn’t
paying, why are you delivering it?”  Boeing, based in  Chicago , said Oct. 4 that it expected
furloughs as soon as this week and would continue working with
customers and suppliers to maintain normal operations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
