Corn futures traded in  South Africa ,
the continent’s largest producer of the grain, fell as further
gains by the rand made imports cheaper.  White corn for delivery in December, the most-active
contract, declined 2.1 percent to 2,326 rand ($235) a metric ton
by the close on the South African Futures Exchange in
Johannesburg. The drop was the biggest since July 15. Yellow
corn for the same delivery month lost 2 percent, the most in
more than a week, to 2,142 rand a ton.  The rand gained for a fourth day against the dollar after
the end of a strike at  Anglo American Platinum Ltd. (AMS) , the world’s
biggest producer of the metal, over planned job cuts. The
currency traded at 9.8964 per dollar at 2:39 p.m. in
Johannesburg.  “White and yellow corn are down sharply today due to the
rand, which is stronger than yesterday,” Brink van Wyk, a
trader at BVG (Pty) Ltd., said in an e-mailed response to
questions.  A meal made from white corn is a staple food in South
Africa and the yellow variety is mostly fed to animals.  Wheat for delivery in December lost 0.4 percent to 3,434
rand a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
