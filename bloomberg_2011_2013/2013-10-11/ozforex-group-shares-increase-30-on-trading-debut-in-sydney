OzForex Group Ltd. (OFX) , which raised
about A$440 million ($416 million) in Australia’s largest
initial public offering this year, rose 30 percent in its debut
on the Australian Securities Exchange.  Shares in the Sydney-based online foreign exchange company
climbed to as much as A$2.59 in initial Sydney trading compared
with the A$2 that investors paid for the stock in the IPO. Part-owners  Carlyle Group LP (CG) ,  Macquarie Group Ltd. (MQG)  and Accel Partners
raised the money in Australia’s third-largest IPO in three
years.  OzForex’s opening may embolden companies waiting to sell
shares to Australian investors. Nine Entertainment Co., an
Australian television broadcaster part-owned by  Apollo Global
Management LLC (APO)  and Oaktree Capital Group LLC, may sell shares in
December to raise as much as A$1.2 billion, the Australian
newspaper reported Sept. 24 without citing anyone.  Macquarie, Carlyle and Accel together owned 63 percent of
OzForex before the IPO and have exited the firm, according to
the offer prospectus.  OzForex posted net earnings of A$17.1 million on net
operating income of A$52.1 million in the year ended March 31
and forecast net profit of A$18.6 million in the year through
March 2014, the prospectus shows. It completed more than 460,000
transactions worth in excess of A$9.1 billion in fiscal 2013, it
said.  Including OzForex, Australian IPOs have raised about $1.9
billion this year, a 46 percent rise from the $1.3 billion
raised in 2012, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The IPO is the third-largest in the country in three years,
Bloomberg data show.  Shopping Centres Australasia Property Group (SCP) 
raised $483 million in  October 2012 and rail company  Aurizon
Holdings Ltd. (AZJ)  raised $4.2 billion in October 2010, the data
show.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Macquarie arranged OzForex’s
IPO, according to offer documents.  To contact the reporters on this story:
