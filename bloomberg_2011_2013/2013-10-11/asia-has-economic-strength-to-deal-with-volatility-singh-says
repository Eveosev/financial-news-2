Asia  will remain the global economic
growth leader and the economies there are strong enough to deal
with financial market volatility, Anoop Singh, director of Asia-Pacific at the  International Monetary Fund , said at a press
conference in Washington.  “Asia as a whole continues to grow robustly,” said Singh.
Capital outflow from the region has been “orderly,” he said
today.  Singh said monetary policies in the region remain “very
accommodative,” which provides “insurance” against economic
slowdown.  In some countries, policy makers need to further increase
interest rates to stem inflation, he said. The biggest concern
is that the necessary tightening of financial conditions becomes
“disorderly,” he said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
