ET Solar Group Corp., a closely held
Chinese photovoltaic-panel company, provided 4.8 megawatts of
equipment for two projects in  Chile â€™s central Combarbala region.  The 2.4-megawatt solar farms called PSF Pama and PSF Lomas
Coloradas will be connected to the grid by the end of the year,
Nanjing, China-based ET Solar said today in a statement. Coener
SpA is building the plants and they will be owned by local
investment company Andacollo de Inversiones.  To contact the reporter on this story:
