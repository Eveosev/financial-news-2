Infosys Ltd. (INFO) ,  India ’s second-largest
software exporter, reserved $35 million for a potential
settlement tied to a U.S. probe into the company’s use of visas.  The company is “engaged in discussions” to reach a civil
resolution with the U.S. Attorney’s office which is
investigating compliance with visa laws, Bangalore-based Infosys
said in an e-mailed statement. The company declined to elaborate
on the talks, which it said are continuing.  Infosys, which reported earnings today, resolved two
whistle-blower cases in Alabama and  California  in the past 14
months after employees alleged it misused so-called B-1 visas,
temporary business permits, to avoid limits on H-1B employment
visas. Proposed changes to immigration laws in Congress, which
would limit the ability of large Indian companies to access H-1B
visas, may damage Infosys’ business model of relying on North
America for more than 60 percent of its revenue.  Infosys reported second-quarter net income of 24.1 billion
rupees ($394 million) in the three months ended September. That
missed the 26.6 billion-rupee median of 46 analysts’ estimates
compiled by Bloomberg, due to the company’s 2.2 billion rupee
provision for “visa-related matters.” according to the
company’s statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
