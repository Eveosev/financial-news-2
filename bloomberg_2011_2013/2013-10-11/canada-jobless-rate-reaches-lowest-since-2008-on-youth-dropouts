Canada ’s  jobless rate  unexpectedly
fell to the lowest in almost five years in September as young
people dropped out of the labor market, helping pull the
participation rate to the lowest in more than a decade.  Unemployment declined to 6.9 percent, the lowest since
December 2008, from 7.1 percent in August, Statistics Canada
said today in Ottawa.  Job creation  slowed to 11,900 in September
from 59,200 in August as 21,400 workers ages 15 to 24 left the
 labor force . Economists surveyed by  Bloomberg News  projected a
10,000 job increase and an unchanged jobless rate, according to
median forecasts.  “It’s nice to see at least moderate job creation, but the
pace has cooled,”  David Watt , chief economist at the Canadian
unit of HSBC Holdings Plc, said. “I don’t expect a burst of job
creation like we saw late last year. It’s disappointing at this
stage of the economy to see such weak labor force growth.”  Slowing job creation and signs of discouraged workers come
a week after the  Bank of Canada  cut its economic growth forecast
for the rest of the year with Senior Deputy Governor Tiff Macklem citing an “elusive” pickup in exports and investment.
Employment growth has slowed after domestic spending and
employment gains pulled Canada out of a recession triggered by
the 2008 global financial crisis.  The  unemployment rate  declined “as fewer youths searched
for work,”  Statistics Canada  said in its report today.  Currency, Bonds  Canada’s dollar strengthened 0.1 percent to C$1.0386 versus
its U.S. counterpart at 12:03 p.m. in Toronto. One Canadian
dollar buys 96.28 U.S. cents. Government benchmark two-year bond
yields were unchanged at 1.20 percent.  The  participation rate  fell to 66.4 percent from 66.6
percent, reaching the lowest since February, 2002.  That development is “very disappointing,” Watt said in an
e-mail. “I would have thought that more would have been getting
drawn back into the labor force,” he said. “Instead the labor
force is not keeping pace with the population.”  The jobs number confirm the “softening trend” in the
domestic economy, said  David Tulk , chief Canada macro strategist
with TD Securities in Toronto. Today’s data probably won’t have
major implications for the Bank of Canada, he said.  Full-time employment rose by 23,400 in September and part-time work fell by 11,500 positions. Private companies added
73,600 workers and public-sector employment fell by 16,300.  Remains Positive  The report shows the “overall long-term trend in Canada
remains positive,” Finance Minister  Jim Flaherty  said in an e-mailed statement. “Not only were more jobs created in
September, but we saw solid gains in the private sector and in
full-time employment.”  Finance, insurance real estate and leasing led the job
gains by industry with an increase of 33,200 in September.
Natural resources employment rose by 18,900.  Manufacturing employment fell by 26,000 and construction by
14,100, Statistics Canada said. Public administration positions
fell by 17,400, and has dropped by 7.2 percent over the last
seven months, according to the report. Flaherty’s last budget
had a plan to shrink the federal workforce to help eliminate the
country’s deficit.  Workers designated by Statistics Canada as employees rose
by 57,300, and the self-employed category fell by 45,400.  Average hourly  wages  of permanent employees rose 1.83
percent in September from a year earlier, exceeding the prior
reading of 1.55 percent.  The slow wage gains and “discouraged” young workers damp
the strength suggested by the drop in the unemployment rate,
said  Jimmy Jean , a strategist in the fixed-income group at
Desjardins Capital Markets in  Montreal .  “There is hardly a reason for the Bank of Canada to
believe that the unemployment rate decline implies that labor
market slack is improving,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
