The  U.S. Treasury  Department
received $570.1 million last month from the sale of  General
Motors Co. (GM)  shares as the government continues winding down its
investment in the automaker.  Through the end of September, the U.S. government has
recovered $36 billion of the $51 billion it spent to bail out
and restructure Detroit-based GM, the Treasury  said  yesterday in
a report to Congress. The report doesn’t say how many shares
were sold during the month or at what price.  Treasury said in a September report its GM stake had been
reduced to 7.3 percent. Following its 2009 bankruptcy, the
automaker went public again in 2010, leaving the U.S. Treasury
as its largest shareholder. The government began selling down
its stake in December as GM repurchased $5.5 billion of shares.
The Treasury said at that time it would sell the rest of its
remaining shares within 15 months.  The government may complete selling its GM stake before the
year is over, Chief Executive Officer Dan Akerson has said.  The U.S. investment in GM was the biggest piece of an
industry bailout that became a centerpiece of President  Barack Obama ’s first term.  The government is exiting GM as investor confidence has
risen while the company introduces 18 new or redesigned vehicles
in the U.S.. The product surge is transforming its lineup into
one of the freshest in the industry from the one of the oldest.  GM gained 1.4 percent to $35.35 at the close in  New York .
The restructured company held its initial public offering in
2010 at $33 a share. The shares have climbed 23 percent this
year, outpacing the 19 percent increase for the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index.  To contact the reporters on this story:
