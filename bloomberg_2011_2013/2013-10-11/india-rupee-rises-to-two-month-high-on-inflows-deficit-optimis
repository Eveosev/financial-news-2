India ’s rupee rose to the highest
level in almost two months on speculation policy makers will
succeed in efforts to boost capital inflows and rein in the
current-account deficit.  Policy makers are in talks with JPMorgan Chase & Co. about
getting Indian debt into international indexes, Finance Minister
Palaniappan Chidambaram said in Washington yesterday. A
concessional currency-swap window offered to local lenders last
month attracted $5.6 billion so far,  Reserve Bank  of India
Governor Raghuram Rajan said Oct. 4. The trade deficit narrowed
in September to the lowest level since March 2011, official data
showed Oct. 9.  “The rupee’s progress is gathering momentum for now,”
 Paul Mackel , head of Asian currency research at HSBC Holdings
Plc in  Hong Kong , wrote in a research report today. The
prospects are “high” that the government may achieve or exceed
its goal of narrowing the current-account deficit to $70 billion
in the year through March 2014, he wrote.  The rupee gained 0.4 percent this week and 0.3 percent
today to 61.1750 per dollar as of 10:11 a.m. in Mumbai,
according to prices from local banks compiled by Bloomberg. It
touched 61.0700 earlier, the strongest since Aug. 13. One-month
implied volatility, a measure of expected moves in the  exchange
rate  used to price options, rose six basis points, or 0.06
percentage point, since Oct. 4 to 15 percent.  India’s current-account deficit in the year through March
2014 may be about 14 percent lower than the  Finance Ministry  has
targeted, easing pressure on the rupee, Chakravarthy Rangarajan,
chairman of the Prime Minister’s Economic Advisory Council, said
in an Oct. 9 interview.  International Finance Corp., the  World Bank ’s investment
unit, plans to sell a record $1 billion of rupee bonds offshore
to fund investments in India, it said Oct. 9.  One-month onshore rupee forwards fell 0.2 percent today to
61.71 per dollar, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Offshore non-deliverable contracts advanced 0.7 percent to 61.68. Forwards
are agreements to buy or sell assets at a set price and date.
Non-deliverable contracts are settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
