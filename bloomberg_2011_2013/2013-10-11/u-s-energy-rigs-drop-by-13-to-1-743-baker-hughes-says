Rigs targeting oil and natural gas
in the U.S. declined by 13 this week to 1,743, according to
 Baker Hughes Inc. (BHI)   Oil rigs  fell by five to 1,367, data posted on the
company’s website show. The  gas  count dropped nine to 369, the
Houston-based field services company said. Miscellaneous rigs,
which usually drill for geothermal energy, rose one to seven.  The  count  declined in September by the most in nine months,
losing 32, as producers leveraged new technologies to shorten
drill times and bore more wells off single pads. The advances
have weakened demand for new rigs and helped boost domestic oil
production to the highest level in more than two decades.  West Texas Intermediate crude for November delivery fell
$1.55, or 1.5 percent, to $101.46 a barrel at 1:11 p.m. on the
 New York  Mercantile Exchange, up 10 percent in the past year.  U.S. oil output totaled 7.81 million barrels a day last
week, near a 24-year high, according to the EIA, the Energy
Department’s statistical arm. Stockpiles rose by 6.81 million
barrels, or 1.9 percent, to 370.5 million.  Natural gas for November delivery rose 4.9 cents, or 1.3
percent, to $3.772 per million British thermal units on the
Nymex, up 4.7 percent from a year ago.  U.S. gas stockpiles  rose 90 billion cubic feet last week to
3.577 trillion, the EIA said yesterday. Supplies were 3.7
percent below year-earlier inventories, the agency said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
