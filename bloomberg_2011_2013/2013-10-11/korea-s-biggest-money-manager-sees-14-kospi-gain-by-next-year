South Korea ’s benchmark stock  index 
will probably gain 14 percent to a record by 2014 as the
improving global economy lifts earnings at exporters, said
Samsung Asset Management Co.  Investors should favor technology and communication
companies, automakers and retailers, Nam Dong Joon, chief
investment officer at South Korea’s biggest private money
manager by assets, said by phone from  Seoul . The Kospi may climb
to 2,300 next year, surpassing the 2,228.96 peak reached in May
2011, Nam said. The gauge rose 1.1 percent to 2,023.84 at 1:22
p.m. in Seoul.  The Kospi rallied 14 percent from this year’s low on June
25 as data showed the economy expanded 1.1 percent in the three
months through June and exports jumped at a quicker-than-estimated 7.7 percent rate in August. Overseas investors plowed
a net $7.1 billion into South Korean shares last month, the most
on record, according to exchange data compiled by Bloomberg.  “Economies in developed markets, led by the U.S., are
recovering, which will boost demand for South Korean exporters,”
Nam said. His firm manages about 126 trillion won ($118 billion)
in assets.  The  U.S. economy  expanded at a 2.5 percent annualized rate
in the second quarter from the previous three months,
accelerating from 1.1 percent growth in the first quarter.
 Europe ’s economy emerged from its longest-ever recession in the
second quarter.  Samsung Electronics Co.,  Asia ’s biggest technology company,
and Hyundai Motor Co., the automaker that got more than half its
sales from overseas in 2012, account for about 24 percent of the
Kospi by weighting.  Accumulated net income for the 763 companies on the  Kospi  (KOSPI) 
will climb as much as 15 percent to 115 trillion won ($107
billion) in 2014, Nam said.  The Kospi index has advanced 1.3 percent this year, lagging
behind the 13 percent rally by the MSCI All-Country World Index.
The Korean gauge is  valued  at 1.1 times net assets, a 46 percent
discount to the MSCI global measure.  To contact the reporter on this story:
