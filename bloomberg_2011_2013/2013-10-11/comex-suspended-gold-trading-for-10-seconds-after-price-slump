CME Group Inc.’s Comex halted
trading in December gold futures for about 10 seconds today at
8:42 a.m. New York time, said Damon Leavell, a spokesman for the
exchange.  The December contract fell about $20 within a minute before
trading was suspended, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Leavell
declined to comment on the size of the trade that led to the
halt. The “stop-logic” mechanism gives traders the opportunity
to provide additional liquidity and prevent excessive price
movements.  Gold prices dropped 23 percent this year through yesterday,
plunging into a bear market in April, as equities rallied and
amid concern that the Federal Reserve will slow the pace of its
stimulus program, eroding demand for the metal as a hedge
against inflation. Prices fell to three-month low today amid
optimism that U.S. lawmakers are moving toward ending the budget
impasse and raising the nation’s debt limit.  “Gold is deeply entrenched in the bear market, and
speculation about the political parties reaching some kind of an
agreement makes it more difficult to make a case for gold,”
 Adam Klopfenstein , a senior market strategist at Archer
Financial Services Inc. in  Chicago , said in a telephone
interview. “The technical stops made it worse.”  Gold futures for December delivery fell 2.2 percent to
$1,268.90 an ounce at 11:08 a.m. on the Comex in New York, after
touching a three-month low of $1,259.60.  To contact the reporter on this story:
