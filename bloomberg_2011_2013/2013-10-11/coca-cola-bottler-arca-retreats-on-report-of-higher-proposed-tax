Arca Continental SAB, Latin
America’s second-biggest Coca-Cola bottler, extended its third
straight weekly decline after a newspaper reported that
lawmakers are considering a higher proposed tax on soda.  The  shares  fell 1.2 percent to 82.16 pesos at 11:35 a.m. in
Mexico City, extending the weekly slump to 2.1 percent. The
benchmark IPC index of 35 Mexican companies rose 1.1 percent and
was little changed for the week.  Lower-house lawmakers from the ruling Institutional
Revolutionary Party and the opposition Democratic Revolutionary
Party plan to increase the rate of a proposed tax on sodas,
Reforma reported today on its website. The move would tax sodas
2 pesos per liter instead of 1 peso under an earlier bill,
Reforma said, citing unidentified negotiators from both parties.  “That’s surely what’s hitting the share price,” Karla Miranda, an analyst at Corporativo GBM SAB, said in a telephone
interview from Mexico City. “For several weeks, beverage
company stocks have been reacting to rumors about news on the
soda tax.”  Arca Continental’s Mexico drinks unit accounted for 76
percent of its sparkling-beverage volume during the first half
of the year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
