Copper rose for a second day ahead
of Chinese trade data that may show sustained demand from the
biggest metals user and as U.S. politician continued talks to
avoid a debt default.  The contract for delivery in three months on the London
Metal Exchange gained 0.4 percent to $7,170.25 a metric ton at
10:03 a.m. in  Shanghai , trimming a second weekly decline.  Imports by  China  probably expanded 7 percent in September
from a year earlier, according to the median of 42 estimates in
a Bloomberg survey. President  Barack Obama  didn’t accept or
reject House Republicans’ plan to increase the debt limit as the
two sides pledged to keep talking tonight about avoiding default
and ending the partial government shutdown.  “We may see a relatively high copper imports for September
tomorrow as recent economic indicators show a stable Chinese
economy,” said Yu Yi, an analyst with SDIC CGOG Futures Co. in
Beijing.  Stockpiles tracked by the LME fell to 512,450 tons, the
lowest since March 8, daily exchange figures showed.  Futures for delivery in December climbed 0.3 percent to
$3.2585 a pound on the Comex in New York. The January contract
on the Shanghai Futures Exchange increased 0.7 percent to 51,780
 yuan  ($8,471) a ton.  On the LME, zinc, nickel and lead also rose, while aluminum
fell and tin was unchanged.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
