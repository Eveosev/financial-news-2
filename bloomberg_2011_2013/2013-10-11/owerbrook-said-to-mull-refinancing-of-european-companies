TowerBrook Capital Partners LP, the
former private-equity arm of Soros Fund Management LLC, is
considering refinancing European companies it owns, according to
two people with knowledge of the matter.  TowerBrook held preliminary discussions about replacing
existing borrowing for U.K.-based ventilation company Volution
Group Ltd. with new loans and possibly paying itself a dividend,
said the people, who asked not to be identified because the
talks are private. Volution was bought by London-based
TowerBrook last year in a deal valued at 163 million pounds
($259 million), the people said.  The private-equity firm is planning to seek new financing
for London-based retailer Phase Eight Fashion & Designs Ltd.,
one of the people said. It will also look at securing new terms
on other companies it owns, including French-based automotive-equipment maker Autodistribution SA, the person said.  Private-equity companies are refinancing and extracting
cash from the businesses they own as borrowing costs are at
record lows and and deal activity remains subdued. Debt
financing for dividend payouts rose to 7.3 billion euros ($9.9
billion) this year, almost triple the amount for the same period
in 2012, according to  Fitch Ratings .  TowerBrook, which was spun out of  George Soros â€™s fund-management business in 2005, will probably not buy any more
companies this year, one of the people said. It bought British
aircraft-interiors maker AIM Aviation Ltd. for 160 million
pounds last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
