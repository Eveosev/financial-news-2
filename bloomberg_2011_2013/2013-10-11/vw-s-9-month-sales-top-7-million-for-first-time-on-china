Volkswagen AG (VOW) ’s nine-month sales
topped 7 million vehicles for the first time as demand in China
more than offset a decline in Europe.  Deliveries rose 4.8 percent to 7.03 million cars and
trucks, the Wolfsburg, Germany-based automaker, the region’s
largest, said today in a statement. September sales gained 7
percent to 856,900 vehicles.  The maker of VW, Audi and Porsche vehicles is relying on
growth in China, the world’s largest auto market, to balance
slumping demand in Europe, where sales are set to drop for a
sixth straight year. VW has a goal of passing  General Motors Co. (GM) 
and  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  by 2018 to become the world’s biggest
auto manufacturer.  “Thanks to a broad-based, international positioning and a
convincing product range we were able to respond well to the
continuing uncertainty in the euro zone and the challenging
overall market situation,” Christian Klingler, VW sales chief,
said in the statement.  VW’s nine-months sales in China rose 18 percent to 2.35
million cars and sport-utility vehicles, boosted by locally
produced vehicles such as Audi’s Q3 and Q5 SUVs. European
deliveries contracted 2.4 percent to 2.73 million vehicles.  Chinese Performance  September sales in China were an estimated 15.4 percent,
“slightly behind” industrywide figures reported today,
“perhaps reflecting weaker performance outside of the VW brand
and Audi,”  David Arnold , a London-based industry specialist at
 Barclays Capital , said in a report to clients.  VW rose as much as 0.8 percent to 175.4 euros and was
trading up 0.6 percent at 2:01 p.m. in Frankfurt. The stock has
gained 1.7 percent this year, valuing the automaker at 79.4
billion euros ($108 billion).  The German company is in talks on increasing its stake in a
joint venture with  FAW CAR Co. (000800)  as part of its push to expand in
China. It plans to lift the holding to 50 percent from the
current 40 percent, Chief Executive Officer  Martin Winterkorn 
said in an interview published Sept. 15 in Frankfurter
Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung. Volkswagen operates a second Chinese
joint venture with  SAIC Motor Corp. (600104)   VW is working expand its model lineup in China 29 percent
by 2015 to attract a broader range of customers. It will offer
90 cars, sport-utility vehicles, vans and heavy trucks in the
country compared with about 70 models now,  Jochem Heizmann , head
of Volkswagen’s Chinese business, said in April.  The manufacturer outlined a strategy in March to increase
production capacity in China 60 percent by 2018 under a 9.8
billion-euro project that includes building factories and
increasing the Chinese workforce 33 percent to more than 100,000
employees in the period.  To contact the reporters on this story:
