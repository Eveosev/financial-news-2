Prague  wants the  National Geographic
Channel  to apologize for a “defaming” report that pictured
petty crime in Prague, alleging that it featured paid actors
instead of real fraudsters.  “The police report we have suggest that the scenes in the
report were manipulated and don’t depict any real situations,”
Prague city council member  Lukas Manhart  said on Czech state TV
channel  CT24  today. “We need to meet with the channel’s
representatives and if it’s confirmed, ask for at least an
apology.”  The report, which aired in November 2012, is part of the
National Geographic Channel series  Scam City . It shows several
situations including a dealer selling fake drugs, or a cheating
taxi driver.  The fraud portrayed in the documentary is a “true
rendering” of real situations and traps, which can happen to
tourists in any other city, the channel said in an e-mailed
statement. The National Geographic has “absolute trust” that
its production team stuck to shooting protocols for using hidden
cameras and follow-up interviews, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
