Evraz Plc (EVR) ,  Russia ’s largest
steelmaker, fell for the first time in five days and the most in
a week, as  Renaissance Capital  said a rally for producers is
overdone.  Evraz declined 1.5 percent to 128.90 pence by the close in
 London , the biggest drop since Oct. 1. The amount of shares
traded was equivalent to about 27 percent of the three-month
average. OAO Severstal, the nation’s second-largest producer of
the alloy, lost 0.3 percent to $8.875 and added 0.4 percent to
287.10 rubles in Moscow. Evraz has gained 37 percent since the
start of August, while Severstal’s Moscow shares have risen 16
percent in the same period.  RenCap named the companies its “least favored” and
predicted a “short-term downward correction” in the next 30 to
45 days, according to an e-mailed note today. Steel stocks may
see a stronger selloff if concern about the pace of global
growth increases, RenCap said.  “We saw quite strong growth in metal producers’ shares,
however it was unfounded because commodity prices remained
unchanged,” Vasiliy Kuligin, a RenCap analyst in Moscow, said
by phone. “Soon we may see a correction.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
