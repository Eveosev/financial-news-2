Wells Fargo & Co ., the fourth-biggest U.S. bank, extended the maturity of some borrowing in
short-term money markets through the end of the month to prepare
for a possible U.S. default.  “We’ve ‘termed out’ some repo financing over the end of
the month,” Chief Financial Officer Timothy Sloan said in an
interview today. Most market participants may have done the same
as the U.S. closed in on its debt ceiling, he said. “We make
sure we have adequate liquidity in all of our operating
entities,” he said.  Banks braced for the prospect of a default as the dispute
among lawmakers and President  Barack Obama  over the U.S. budget
shut down parts of the government and left the nation within
days of being unable to pay all its bills. Wells Fargo Chief
Executive Officer  John Stumpf  called the developments
troublesome and said the uncertainty was hurting the economy.  Extending the maturities didn’t increase costs materially
since the lender isn’t too reliant on financing through money
markets such as  repurchase agreements , Sloan said. The small
size of its securities unit also means the challenge of how to
account for Treasuries as collateral isn’t a big concern, he
said.  “If you look at the size of our broker-dealer operation
relative to the whole company, they are a relatively small
percentage of our total assets,” Sloan said. “So it’s not
overly expensive.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
