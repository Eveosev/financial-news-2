Madagascan President  Andry Rajoelina 
was removed from a list of candidates for his job before an
election this week, along with the wife of ousted leader Marc Ravalomanana and former President Didier Ratsiraka.  The list of presidential candidates now contains 31 names,
compared with the original 41, a statement dated yesterday on
the website of the Antananarivo-based High Constitutional Court
showed. One candidate withdrew and others were dropped from the
list because of irregularities, according to the statement,
which gave no further details.  The presidential vote, scheduled for Aug. 23, will be the
first in the Indian Ocean island nation since Rajoelina removed
Marc Ravalomanana from power in 2009 in an army-backed coup. The
 Southern African Development Community  and the  African Union  in
July asked Rajoelina, Ratsiraka and Lalao Ravalomanana to step
down as candidates.  Rajoelina was listed as a candidate in May, after saying in
January he had opted against running in an agreement brokered by
the SADC.  Marc Ravalomanana , who also agreed in January not to
run, now lives in exile in South Africa.  Madagascar’s $10 billion economy is forecast to expand 2.6
percent this year, speeding up from 1.9 percent in 2012,
according to International Monetary Fund data. That compares
with average growth of 5.6 percent for all of sub-Saharan
Africa. The country is the world’s second-largest producer of
vanilla and cloves.  To contact the reporters on this story:
