BP Plc (BP/)  leaked oil from a pipeline in
Alaska’s North Slope, according to a report made to the National
Response Center.  The pipeline released about 50 gallons of oil on land as it
was being bled down for a “system safeout,” according to the
report. The incident happened yesterday at 2:36 p.m. local time,
the report said.  U.S. companies must notify the response center if they
release hazardous substances in excess of reportable quantities,
according to the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation, and Liability Act, commonly known as Superfund.  Bloomberg News  could not immediately verify the information
in the filing was accurate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
