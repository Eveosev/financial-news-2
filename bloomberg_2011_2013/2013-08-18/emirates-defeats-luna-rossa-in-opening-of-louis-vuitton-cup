Emirates Team  New Zealand  had two
men go overboard before winning the first race against  Italy ’s
Team Luna Rossa’s damaged catamaran in the Louis Vuitton Cup
finals.  The Italian team fixed their damaged daggerboard and
started the race before being forced to withdraw yesterday, as
Emirates finished the 9.95 nautical-mile course in 31 minutes,
three seconds.  The sailing teams are vying for the victory in the best-of-13 championship series in  San Francisco Bay . The winner
advances to the America’s Cup against defending champion Oracle
Team USA starting Sept. 7.  Yesterday’s second race was postponed when the wind
exceeded the 19.4-knot (22.32 mph) limit. Two races will be held
today and a makeup race tomorrow depending on the winds.  Emirates teammates Chris Ward and Rob Wadell were thrown
overboard when the front of the hulls dipped under water on a
sharp turn. They were pulled from the bay by a rescue boat.  Two five-leg races of about 25 minutes each are scheduled
each day through Aug. 30 until one of the teams tallies seven
victories.  To contact the reporter on this story:
