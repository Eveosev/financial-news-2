Mark Sanchez  connected with Jeff Cumberland for a touchdown as the  New York  Jets defeated the
Jacksonville Jaguars 37-13 in a National Football League
preseason game.  Sanchez directed five scoring drives as he fights to keep
his starting position with the team. Rookie Geno Smith, who sat
out last nightâ€™s game with a sprained ankle, is competing for
the starting quarterback job for the Jets (1-1).  Sanchez, who played through three quarters, completed 13 of
23 passing attempts for 169 yards, one touchdown and one
interception on the goal line in the first drive of the second
quarter at MetLife Stadium in  East Rutherford ,  New Jersey .  Kahlil Bell scored on runs of one yard and five yards in
the third quarter for the Jets, while Mike Edwards fell on a
fumbled football in the end zone for a touchdown with two
minutes, 44 seconds left in the game.  Blaine Gabbert was 13 of 16 for 165 yards and a touchdown
for the Jaguars (0-2) before leaving the game with a sprained
thumb.  To contact the reporter on this story:
