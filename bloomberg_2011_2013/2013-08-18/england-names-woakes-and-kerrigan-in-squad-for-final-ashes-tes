England named the uncapped duo  Chris
Woakes  and Simon Kerrigan in a 14-man squad for the fifth and
final Ashes cricket Test against Australia, starting Aug. 21 at
the Oval in London.  The inclusion of Lancashire’s Kerrigan gives England the
option of using two spin bowlers. Warwickshire’s Woakes is an
all-rounder.  England leads the five-match series 3-0 after winning the
first two games, drawing the third and taking the fourth by 74
runs. It’s the first time England has won three consecutive
series against Australia since 1956.  England squad: A.N. Cook (capt.), J.M. Anderson, J.M.
Bairstow, I.R. Bell, S.C.J. Broad, S.T. Finn, S.C. Kerrigan,
K.P. Pietersen, M.J. Prior, J.E. Root, G.P. Swann, C.T.
Tremlett, I.J.L. Trott, C.R. Woakes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
