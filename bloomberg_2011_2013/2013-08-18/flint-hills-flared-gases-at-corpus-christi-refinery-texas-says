Flint Hills Resources LLC said it
flared gases after a leak was discovered yesterday at its Corpus
Christi West refinery, according to a  Texas  regulatory filing.  The refinery had reported emissions of benzene, hydrogen
sulfide, nitrogen oxide and other gases to the U.S. National
Response Center. Flint Hills said it conducted flaring yesterday
from 7:35 p.m. until 11:35 p.m. while conducting repair work on
a fluidized catalytic cracker unit, according to a report posted
on the website of the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality.  The leak was plugged and no emissions were detected as of
2:49 a.m. today, the filing said. The plant is located in Corpus
Christi, Texas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
