The biggest  earnings surprise  by
Chinese companies traded in New York since at least 2005 sparked
the best weekly advance this year for  E-House (EJ)  China Holdings
Ltd. to  Phoenix New Media Ltd. (FENG)   Twenty-six of the 29 companies on the Bloomberg China-US
Equity Index that have reported earnings since July 22 beat
analysts’ estimates, the most since quarterly data compiled by
Bloomberg going back to 2005. The measure advanced 2.3 percent
last week, led by E-House. The Shanghai Composite Index fell 0.6
percent on Aug. 16 after the market’s shares were roiled by a
trading error at Everbright Securities Co. that spurred a 53
percent surge in volumes.  Sina Corp., provider of a Twitter-like service, climbed for
a sixth week after reporting adjusted earnings that exceeded
estimates by 75 percent and on prospects its partnership with
Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. will boost sales. Online travel
agency  Ctrip.com International Ltd. (CTRP)  surged 19 percent on Aug. 1
as second-quarter net income beat the mean forecast by 38
percent. E-House’s adjusted profit was more than double
analysts’ projections.  “We’ve seen some good results from these Chinese Internet
names mostly, after the stocks had struggled through last year
or so,” Derrick Irwin, a portfolio manager of the Wells Fargo
Advantage  Emerging Markets  Equity Fund, who helps manage $10.9
billion of assets in  Boston , said by phone Aug. 15. “Also we
are also seeing signs of some degree of consolidation and some
strategic re-positioning in the industry, which I think really
helps the thesis.”  Weibo Revenue  Sina’s shares climbed 2.5 percent last week to $79.99,
after reaching $82.90 Aug. 13, the highest level in 21 months.  The Shanghai-based company  posted  adjusted net income of
$14.2 million in the second quarter, or 21 cents per share. That
compared with the 12-cent mean estimate of nine analysts
compiled by Bloomberg. Revenue of Sina’s Weibo unit,  China ’s
biggest Twitter-like social media, surged 205 percent from a
year earlier, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Charles Chao
said in an earnings call Aug. 13.  Sina sold an 18 percent stake in Weibo to Alibaba, China’s
biggest e-commerce company, for $586 million in April as the
companies work to compete with Tencent Holdings Ltd. on social
e-commerce. Alibaba is allowing shoppers to log on to its Taobao
Marketplace using their Weibo accounts. The two companies are
also developing mobile payment systems, mobile gaming and
videos.  E-House gained 31 percent last week to $6.07, its biggest
five-day jump this year. The American depositary receipts have
climbed 48 percent this year.  E-House Earnings  Adjusted net income  at the Shanghai-based company increased
by 127 percent from a year earlier to $15.3 million in April-June, compared with analysts’ mean projection of $7.25 million,
it said in an Aug. 16 statement. Sales rose 43 percent from a
year earlier.  “E-House’s earnings beat by a big margin,” Tian X. Hou,
the founder of T. H. Capital LLC, which compiles research on
U.S.-traded Chinese companies, said by phone from  New York  Aug.
16. “Most Chinese Internet companies have released better-than-expected results as Wall Street had lowered their expectations
earlier.”  Ctrip, China’s biggest online travel agency, added 8.9
percent last week to a two-year high of $46.03. The Shanghai-based company reported July 31 net income surged 76 percent in
April-June while sales climbed 28 percent.  Phoenix New Media Ltd., a Beijing-based Internet and
television news outlet, soared 23 percent to $8.91, extending
gains into a fifth week.  Second-quarter profit jumped 120 percent in April-June
while sales increased 29 percent to 364.2 million  yuan  ($59.5
million), according to its Aug. 12 statement. That exceeded its
own forecast of 341 million yuan given in May.  The iShares China Large-Cap  ETF (FXI) , the largest Chinese
 exchange-traded fund  in the U.S., advanced 4.7 percent last week
to $36.16, rising the most since January. The Standard & Poor’s
500 Index slipped 2.1 percent in the week, dropping the most
since June, as investors weighed data showing housing starts
climbed in July while a gauge of  consumer confidence  fell.  To contact the reporter on this story:
