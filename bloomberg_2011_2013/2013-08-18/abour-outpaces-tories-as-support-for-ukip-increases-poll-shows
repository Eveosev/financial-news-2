Britain’s opposition Labour Party
widened its lead over Prime Minister David Cameron’s
Conservatives and the U.K. Independence Party gained more
support, a poll showed.  Support for Labour was up one point to 37 percent, with the
Tories’ rating staying unchanged at 28 percent, according to a
ComRes poll commissioned by the Sunday Mirror and Independent on
Sunday newspapers and compared with a survey in July. UKIP,
which opposes Britain’s membership of the European Union, gained
one point to 19 percent, its highest rating in a ComRes online
survey of voters. Support for coalition partners the Liberal
Democrats was unchanged at 8 percent.  Cameron is counting on a revival in  Britain’s economy  and a
more buoyant housing market to boost approval ratings for the
Conservatives, as the government pushes on with its austerity
program. While the economy is showing signs of recovery,
unemployment remains at 7.8 percent.  Britons’ support for workers from other parts of the EU
coming to the country is also waning. Asked whether they
supported free movement of workers within the EU, 23 percent
agreed while 57 percent expressed opposition, the poll showed.
That compared to 58 percent approval in May 2009.  ComRes interviewed 2,001 British adults online on Aug. 14
and Aug. 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
