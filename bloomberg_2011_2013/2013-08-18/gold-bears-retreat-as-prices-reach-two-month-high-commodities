Speculators cut bullish and bearish
bets on gold simultaneously for the first time in two months as
prices advanced to the highest since mid-June on signs of
strengthening physical demand.  The net-bullish position rose 18 percent to 56,604  futures
and options  by Aug. 13, as the 17 percent contraction in short
bets exceeded the 3 percent drop in long wagers, U.S. Commodity
Futures Trading Commission data show. Net-long  holdings  across
18 U.S.-traded commodities expanded 23 percent as the position
in silver more than doubled and investors turned positive on
copper for the first time since February.  Gold tumbled a record 23 percent last quarter as some
investors lost faith in the metal as a store of value. The rout
spurred losses for billionaire  John Paulson , who joined  George
Soros  in selling bullion holdings in three months ended June 30,
government filings showed last week. Lower prices spurred demand
in  India  and China, the top buyers, driving global coin and bar
purchases to record in the second quarter and jewelry purchases
to the highest since 2008, the World Gold Council said Aug. 15.  “People became more interested in holding gold as the
price dropped,’ said Tom Stringfellow, the president of San
Antonio-based Frost Investment Advisors LLC, which manages about
$9 billion. ‘‘Sometimes it’s too far too fast, and in this
market, there’s money always looking for relative value.”  Gold Rally  Prices jumped 4.5 percent to $1,371 an ounce on the Comex
in New York last week, the biggest gain since July 12. Thirteen
analysts surveyed by  Bloomberg News  expect the metal to rise
this week, with a further four bearish and five neutral. That’s
the highest proportion of bulls since March 8. Futures declined
0.4 percent to $1,365.70 today.  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot Index of 24 commodities
advanced 2.4 percent last week. The MSCI All-Country World Index
of equities slid 1 percent. The Bloomberg  Dollar Index , a gauge
against 10 major trading partners, gained 0.5 percent, and the
Bloomberg U.S. Treasury Bond Index dropped 1.1 percent.  Global bar and  coin  sales soared 78 percent last quarter
from a year earlier to 507.6 metric tons as demand more than
doubled in India and China, World Gold Council data show. That’s
valued at about $22.4 billion at today’s price. Jewelry demand
jumped 37 percent to 575.5 tons.  China ’s consumption rose 54
percent to 706.4 tons in the first half, putting it on track to
overtake India as the biggest user, the China Gold Association
said Aug. 12.  JPMorgan Outlook  Demand in India and possible mine strikes in  South Africa 
may boost prices in the next four to five weeks before an
industry conference in Denver, JPMorgan Chase & Co. said in a
report Aug. 15. The metal may rally to $1,420 by the end of the
year as the decline in prices attracts investors, central banks
and fabricators, Jeffrey Christian, a managing partner at CPM
Group, said in an interview in Jaipur, India, last week.  Declining equities and a weaker dollar have helped support
gold,  Suki Cooper , a New York-based analyst at Barclays Plc,
said in a report Aug. 16. The  S&P 500 Index  fell 2.1 percent
last week, the most since June. Bullion tumbled 18 percent this
year as the  S&P 500  advanced to a record Aug. 2.  Strengthening physical demand wasn’t enough to compensate
for sales from  exchange-traded products  last quarter, driving
overall demand down 12 percent to a four-year low, the World
Gold Council said. Paulson & Co., the largest  investor  in the
SPDR Gold Trust, the biggest bullion ETP, cut its stake by 53
percent in the second quarter to 10.2 million shares, a filing
to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission showed Aug. 14.
The stake was valued at $1.35 billion on Aug. 16, compared with
$1.21 billion at the end of the quarter.  Hedge Funds  Soros Fund Management LLC sold 530,900 SPDR shares last
quarter, valued at $63.2 million as of June 28, an  SEC filing 
showed. Third Point LLC, run by billionaire hedge-fund manager
 Daniel Loeb , sold all of its 130,000 SPDR shares, valued at
$15.5 million at the end of the quarter. SPDR gold  holdings 
climbed 0.5 percent last week, the first gain since December.  Gold tumbled into a  bear market  in April, reaching a 34-month low on June 28, amid speculation the  U.S. economy  gained
enough traction for the  Federal Reserve  to begin curbing
stimulus. Prices surged 70 percent from December 2008 to June
2011 as the central bank bought more than $2 trillion of  debt ,
increasing demand for a hedge against inflation.  Stimulus Cuts  A Bloomberg survey this month showed 65 percent of
economists expect Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  to reduce the $85
billion of monthly asset purchases in September, probably
starting with a cut of $10 billion.  “Gold has until this point been a store of value in times
of instability,” said Chad Morganlander, a Florham Park, New
Jersey-based fund manager at Stifel Nicolaus & Co. whose company
oversees about $130 billion of assets. “If one believes we are
hitting a point of self-sustaining recovery in the U.S.,
investors may want to underweight or eliminate their gold
exposure.”  Money managers pulled $36.28 million from precious-metal
funds in the week ended Aug. 14, according to Cambridge,
Massachusetts-based EPFR Global, which tracks money flows.
Commodity funds had inflows $29.89 million.  Net-long positions in crude slipped 0.7 percent to 308,786
contracts, CFTC data show. West Texas Intermediate gained for
six straight sessions through Aug. 16, the longest rally since
April. Prices gained 1.4 percent last week amid concern that
clashes in Egypt will disrupt Middle East supply.  Money managers held a net-long position in  copper  of 7,041
contracts, after betting on lower prices for 24 consecutive
weeks, the longest bearish stretch since July 2009, the CFTC
data show. Factory output in China, the biggest metals consumer,
jumped more than estimated last month, government data showed
Aug. 9. Futures rose 1.8 percent last week.  Silver Wagers  Bullish  silver  wagers jumped to 11,423 contracts from 4,358
a week earlier. Prices surged 15 percent in New York last week,
the most since September 2008. Holdings of the metal through
ETPs reached a record Aug. 16.  A measure of net-long positions across 11 agricultural
products totaled 80,339 futures and options, government data
show. That compares with a net-short holding of 9,713 last week,
the first bearish outlook in records going back to June 2006.
The S&P GSCI Agriculture Index of eight commodities rose 2
percent last week.  Investors held a record net-short position in corn of
123,221 contracts versus 113,072 a week earlier. Prices in
 Chicago  climbed 2.3 percent last week after the  U.S. Department
of Agriculture  said the number of unseeded acres surged from the
prior year because of wet weather in May and June.  U.S. Exporters  Bullish cotton wagers jumped 25 percent to 79,292, the
highest since September 2010. Prices rose 4.9 percent last week,
the most in two months. Soybean  holdings  rebounded 8.3 percent
to 47,177, snapping three weeks of declines. U.S. exporters
reported selling 284,000 tons to China on Aug. 16, following a
sale of 110,000 tons reported Aug. 14.  China’s exports and imports rebounded by more than
estimated last month, customs data showed Aug. 8. Sales of food
and beverages boosted retail gains in the nation, while steel
products, nonferrous metals, power and cement showed faster
output in July, according to Lu Ting, Bank of America Corp.’s
head of Greater China economics in  Hong Kong . The dollar has
dropped 1.5 percent against 10 major currencies since mid-July.  “The latest reports from China indicate the economy is
stabilizing,” said Adrian Day, who manages about $170 million
of assets as the president of Adrian Day Asset Management in
Annapolis,  Maryland . “In the last month, the dollar has been
relatively weak. If we see a continuation of that trend, and
that looks as though it could continue, that would be positive
for commodities.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
