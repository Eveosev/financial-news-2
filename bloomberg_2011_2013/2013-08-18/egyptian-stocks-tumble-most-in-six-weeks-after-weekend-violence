Egyptian shares fell the most in two
months as Islamists called for more protests following a
government crackdown that has left at least 800 people dead.
Borrowing costs rose for the first time in seven weeks at an
auction today.  The benchmark EGX 30 Index slumped 3.9 percent, the most
since June 12, to 5,334.55 at the 1:30 p.m. close in Cairo.
About 332 million Egyptian pounds ($48 million) of shares
traded, compared with a one-year daily average of 391 million
pounds. Commercial International Bank  Egypt  SAE, the country’s
biggest publicly traded lender, led a list of 29 decliners with
a 5.4 percent dive. The market will close one hour early
tomorrow as it did today, the bourse said in an e-mail.  Stocks slid as concerns of an escalation of violence grew
following calls by supporters of former Islamist President
Mohamed Mursi to continue demonstrations demanding his
reinstatement. At least 173 people died in weekend clashes that
followed the violent breakup of pro-Mursi protest camps on Aug.
14. The stock market closed Aug. 15 in the first unscheduled
shutdown since January 2011, when it suspended trading for
almost two months.  “The closure Thursday without prior notice brings back to
memories of 2011 and the possibility that it could happen again,
considering the hostile security situation on the ground,”
Wafik Dawood, director of institutional sales at Cairo-based
Mega Investments Securities, said by phone.  Yields Rise  Egypt sold 5.5 billion pounds at an auction of treasury
bills today, with the yield on  three-month notes  rising 18 basis
points from last week to 11.44 percent, according to central
bank data on Bloomberg. The yield on  nine-month bills  advanced
three basis points to 12.41 percent. Yields on both maturities
had plunged 311 and 260 basis points, respectively, since the
military deposed Mursi July 3. A 6.5 billion-pound auction,
canceled Aug. 15 amid the unrest, will be held tomorrow,
according to central bank data on Bloomberg.  The sales are part of a government effort to raise a record
200 billion pounds this quarter to fund a  budget deficit  that
widened to about 14 percent in the year that ended in June from
10.8 percent a year earlier.  The European Union said it will “urgently review” its
relations with Egypt in a meeting of senior diplomats tomorrow.
The announcement follows President  Barack Obama ’s cancellation
of a U.S. military exercise with Egypt scheduled for next month.
The U.S. provides the North African country’s army with $1.3
billion in annual aid.  Credit Risk  The yield on Egypt’s benchmark $1 billion of 5.75 percent
eurobonds due in 2020 has jumped 85 basis points, or 0.85 of a
percentage point, from Aug. 14 to 9.18 percent on Aug. 16. That
corresponded with a 4.3 percent drop in the price of the
securities in the same period, the biggest in 14 months. Five-year credit default swaps, contracts which insure the country’s
debt against default, climbed to 810 basis points, according to
CMA data, ranking Egypt among the 10-riskiest credits in the
world.  Commercial International fell the most in more than eight
months to 35.63 pounds. Orascom Telecom Holding SAE dropped 4
percent to 4.36 pounds, the lowest close in more than a month.
Oriental Weavers Co., the country’s biggest carpets
manufacturer, advanced 0.4 percent after its second-quarter
profit almost doubled to 98.5 million pounds.  Gulf Shares  In the Gulf,  Dubai’s (DFMGI)  benchmark index retreated for a third
day, falling 0.2 percent led by Emirates NBD PJSC, as shares
