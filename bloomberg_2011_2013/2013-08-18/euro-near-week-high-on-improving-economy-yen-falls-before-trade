The euro approached a two-week high
against the yen before German reports this week that analysts
said will show the region’s largest economy is gaining momentum.  The euro gained versus most of its 16 major peers before a
report this week based on surveys of  purchasing managers  will
show services and manufacturing in the bloc expanded this month
at the fastest pace in two years, according to analysts in a
Bloomberg News survey. The yen weakened after  Japan ’s  trade
deficit  widened in July.  New Zealand ’s dollar climbed against
all of its 16 major counterparts after services industries
expanded and producer prices increased.  “The data could be supportive” of the euro, said  Marcus Hettinger , a currency strategist at Credit Suisse Group AG in
Zurich. “The PMI should show that the economic recovery is
gaining traction in the  euro zone .”  The euro rose 0.3 percent to 130.39 yen at 10:48 a.m. in
 London  after advancing to 130.72 on Aug. 15, the highest level
since Aug. 6. The common currency was little changed at $1.3337.
The yen weakened 0.3 percent to 97.79 per dollar.  Europe ’s shared currency will probably trade between $1.32
and $1.34 this week, Credit Suisse’s Hettinger said. The median
of analysts’ and strategists’ forecasts compiled by Bloomberg is
for the euro to end next month at $1.30 and decline to $1.27 by
year-end.  German Growth  German producer prices rose 0.2 percent in July, the first
increase in six months, the Federal Statistics Office will say
tomorrow, according to a Bloomberg survey. A gauge of
manufacturing climbed to 51.1 this month from 50.7 in July and
the services index increased to 51.7 from 51.3, an Aug. 22
report from Markit Economics will show separate survey showed.
Readings above 50 indicate growth.  The euro has strengthened 5.1 percent this year, the best
performer among 10 developed-nation currencies tracked by
Bloomberg Correlation Weighted Indexes. The dollar rose 3.9
percent, while the yen slumped 8.9 percent.  A composite index of services and manufacturing output in
the euro area rose to 50.9 in August from 50.5 in July,
according to the median estimate of 23 analysts in a Bloomberg
survey before the report on Aug. 22.  Japan’s imports outpaced exports by 1.02 trillion yen in
July, compared with the median estimate for a 773.5 billion yen
gap, the Ministry of Finance said in  Tokyo . It was the biggest
deficit since January, when it was a record 1.63 trillion yen.  ‘Yen Negative’  “Japan’s external balance remains deeply in deficit and
that’s obviously a yen negative,” said Callum Henderson,
Singapore-based global head of currency research at Standard
Chartered Plc.  The Bloomberg U.S. Dollar Index, which tracks the currency
against 10 major counterparts, was little changed at 1,022.27
after climbing 0.5 percent last week.  The  Federal Reserve  will release the minutes of its July
30-31 meeting on Aug. 21. Investors and analysts will be looking
for clues on when central bankers plan to reduce its $85 billion
in monthly asset purchases. Officials will begin to reduce the
central bank’s bond buying next month, according to 65 percent
of economists surveyed by Bloomberg from Aug. 9-13.  The  New Zealand dollar  climbed for a fourth day against its
U.S. peer, rising 0.4 percent to 81.40 U.S. cents, after being
as high as 81.49 cents, the most since May 29. The kiwi jumped
0.6 percent to 79.50 yen.  A gauge of services industries expanded to 58.1 last month,
the most since October, from 55.1 in June, Business New Zealand
and Bank of New Zealand Ltd. said. Producer input and output
prices rose in the second quarter from the previous three
months, according to  Statistics New Zealand .  Aussie Gains  Australia ’s dollar strengthened 0.2 percent to 92.03 U.S.
cents after advancing to 92.33, the highest since July 29. It
gained 0.3 percent to 89.84 yen.  India ’s rupee plunged to a record low, sliding as much as
1.9 percent to 62.825 per dollar before trading at 62.70,
according to prices from local banks compiled by Bloomberg. It
weakened 1.3 percent last week.  Indonesia ’s rupiah fell to a four-year low against the
dollar after the nation’s current-account deficit widened to a
record last quarter. The rupiah slid 1 percent to 10,533 per
dollar after reaching 10,608, the weakest since June 2009.  To contact the reporters on this story:
