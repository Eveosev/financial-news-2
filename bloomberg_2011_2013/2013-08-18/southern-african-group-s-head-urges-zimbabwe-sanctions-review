Joyce Banda, chairwoman of the
Southern African Development Community, called on western
nations to review sanctions against  Zimbabwe  after the country’s
presidential election last month.  “I want the West to review its position on the sanctions
in Zimbabwe,” Banda, who also is Malawi’s president, said in
remarks at the closing of an SADC summit meeting held in her
country’s capital, Lilongwe. “Zimbabweans deserve better and
Zimbabweans have suffered enough.”  Sanctions against Zimbabweans including President Robert Mugabe were imposed in 2003 by U.S. President George W. Bush, a
Republican, and were continued under his Democratic successor,
 Barack Obama . Mugabe was re-elected for another five-year term.
The SADC has 15 members including Angola and Mozambique.  To contact the reporter on this story:
