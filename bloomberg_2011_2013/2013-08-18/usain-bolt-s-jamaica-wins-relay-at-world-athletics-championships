Jamaica’s Usain Bolt anchored his
nation to victory in the 400-meter relay yesterday on the final
day of the World Athletics Championships.  Nesta Carter, Kemar Bailey-Cole, Nickel Ashmeade and Bolt
had a time of 37.36 seconds, ahead of the U.S. and Britain.  The British team then lost the bronze medal as it was
disqualified for a faulty baton handover, and  Canada  was
promoted to third. It was the sixth time in seven major
championships that British sprinters have been unable to get the
baton around safely.  Six-time Olympic gold medalist Bolt, the current 100m world
record holder, was winning his third title at these world
championships, having taken the 100m and 200m events. He’s now
won a record-equaling eight golds in his career at the worlds.  “I am very satisfied. It’s a wonderful energy that’s
coming out,” Bolt said in addressing the crowd, after dancing
in delight following his team’s victory.  Jamaica’s women’s team regained the 400m relay title in a
time of 41.29 seconds.  France  was second and the U.S. third.  Also yesterday, Asbel Kiprop of  Kenya  retained his men’s
1,500m title in 3 minutes, 36.28 seconds, with Matthew
Centrowitz of the U.S. second in 3:36.78.  Kiprop’s compatriot Eunice Jepkoech Sum won the women’s
800m in 1:57.38.  Germany ’s Christina Obergfoll won the women’s
javelin event with a throw of 69.05m, and Teddy Tamgho of France
took the men’s triple jump crown with a leap of 18.04 metres.  To contact the reporter on this story:
