Chelsea beat Hull City 2-0 to give
coach  Jose Mourinho  victory in his first Premier League soccer
game since returning to the club where he won the title in 2005
and 2006. Tottenham won 1-0 at Crystal Palace.  Oscar and  Frank Lampard  scored for the Blues at Stamford
Bridge. Lampard had a penalty kick saved before Oscar struck in
the 13th minute. Lampard added the second goal 12 minutes later
with a dipping free kick that goalkeeper Allan McGregor failed
to tip over.  Roberto Soldado  converted a penalty kick on his debut as
Tottenham won in today’s other defeat for a promoted team.  Soldado, Spurs’ record 26 million-pound ($41 million)
signing from Valencia, scored in the 50th minute at Palace after
Dean Moxey handled  Aaron Lennon ’s cross.  Yesterday, champion Manchester United won 4-1 at Swansea
and Arsenal was upset 3-1 at home by Aston Villa. Liverpool beat
Stoke 1-0 and Fulham had a 1-0 victory at Sunderland.
Southampton had a 1-0 win at West Brom, West Ham beat promoted
Cardiff 2-0 and Norwich drew 2-2 with Everton.  Tomorrow, Newcastle visits Manchester City, which is
bidding to win back the title it relinquished last season.  To contact the reporter on this story:
