Polyus Gold International Ltd. (PLZLY)  is
trading more in line with the precious metal and less with
Moscow’s benchmark stock index since  Russia ’s largest gold
producer abandoned its home market in June 2012 for  London .  The correlation for Polyus with the metal climbed to a
record on Aug. 12 in  New York , while that with the  Micex index (INDEXCF) 
sank 35 percent over the past year, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. Since the company moved its primary listing to
London to lure investment and boost valuations, its forward
price-to-earnings ratio has climbed to about 19 from 10 at the
beginning of the year, compared with 5.2 for the 50-stock Micex.  “By moving its listing to London, the company wanted to
widen its investor base and distance itself from Russia-related
risks,” Vladimir Sergievskiy, an analyst at Barclays Plc in
London who rates the stock the equivalent of hold, said by phone
Aug. 16. “The company’s revenue directly depends on the price
of gold and it’s just natural when the stock’s correlation with
the metal strengthens.”  Jersey-based Polyus gained 2.1 percent to 208 pence in
London Aug. 16, advancing for a third week, while global
depositary receipts climbed 2.2 percent to $3.20 in New York.
The Bloomberg-Russia-US Equity  Index (RTSI$)  of most-traded Russian
stocks rose for a second week and futures on the dollar-denominated RTS gauge expiring in September slipped 0.5 percent
to 131,400 in U.S. hours Aug. 16.  Polymetal, Evraz  Polyus, in which billionaire Suleiman Kerimov holds 40
percent, became the third Russian metals producer to move its
primary listing to London last year after Polymetal
International Plc, a silver and gold miner, and  Evraz Plc (EVR) , a
steelmaker, moved their listings to London from Moscow in 2011.
The 30-day average turnover for the 10 biggest Russian companies
tracked by Bloomberg in London is about 54 percent greater than
in Moscow.  The Micex gauge, the cheapest among 21  emerging markets 
tracked by Bloomberg, trades at 5.2 times estimated earnings,
compared with ratios of 13 for India’s  S&P BSE Sensex Index (SENSEX) ,
11.9 for Brazil’s  Ibovespa (IBOV)  and 8.3 for China’s  Shanghai
Composite Index (SHCOMP) , according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “Polyus’s main listing in London and the company now being
under British jurisdiction protects it from Russian risks even
as their production base remains in Russia,” Andrey Tretelnikov, an analyst at Rye, Man & Gor Securities, said by
phone from Moscow Aug. 14. “It was strategically right
decision. The market values Polyus higher than comparable
Moscow-listed stocks.”  Gold Bulls  Gold traders are the most bullish in five months on signs
that demand is picking up. Thirteen analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg expect prices to rise this week, four were bearish and
five neutral, the highest proportion of bulls since March 8.
Consumer buying of the metal jumped 53 percent in the second
quarter from a year earlier, almost making up for the record
sales of exchange-traded products backed by bullion, World Gold
Council data show.  Gold had the biggest weekly gain since July 12 as futures
for December delivery rose 4.5 percent last week to $1,371 an
ounce on the Comex in New York.  Polyus Gold’s 130-day correlation coefficient with the
metal rose to a record-high 0.37 in New York Aug. 9, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. The ADR’s coefficient with the
nation’s Micex benchmark index decreased to 0.11 on Aug. 16,
compared with 0.17 in May.  Gazprom Neft  The Bloomberg Russia-US gauge slumped 0.3 percent to 91.26
Aug. 16, trimming its weekly gain to 0.4 percent. The  Market
Vectors Russia ETF (RSX) , the largest exchange-traded fund dedicated
to Russian equities, slipped 0.9 percent to $26.28 Aug. 16,
paring its first weekly gain in four weeks to 0.5 percent. The
RTS Volatility Index, which measures expected swings in the
 stock futures , decreased 2.1 percent to 22.25.  The Micex Index slipped 0.2 percent last week to 1,380.31.
The dollar-denominated RTS Index also fell 0.2 percent last week
to 1,323.42 in Moscow.  OAO Gazprom Neft (GZPFY) , the country’s fourth-largest oil
producer, rose 3.2 percent last week to $18.96, advancing for a
third consecutive week, the longest stretch of weekly gains
since February.  To contact the reporter on this story:
