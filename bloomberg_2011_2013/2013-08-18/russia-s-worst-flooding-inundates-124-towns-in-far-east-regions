Russia’s worst flooding inundated
124 towns in five regions in the country’s  Far East , affecting
more than 34,000 people.  Rain continues to fall, the national weather center said on
its website today. The water level in the Amur River near the
city of Khabarovsk topped 6.49 meters (21 feet) by 8 p.m. local
time, exceeding the historic record, according to the
Emergencies Ministry.  The five regions have declared a state of emergency. The
ministry evacuated 19,211 people from the Amur, Khabarovsk and
Jewish Autonomous regions as of 7 a.m. Moscow time today,
according to its data. President  Vladimir Putin  held a
videoconference yesterday with regional governors and defense,
health and emergency officials to discuss the flooding.  “We have never seen such a large-scale flood in our
country’s history,”  Alexander Frolov , chief forecaster at the
weather center, said yesterday on state television channel
Rossiya 24.  Floods in the Amur region are hindering preparations for
winter and swamping open-pit coal mines, state news service RIA
Novosti reported, citing Oleg Kozhemyako, the local governor.  To contact the reporter on this story:
