Israel’s benchmark  government bonds 
fell, pushing yields to the highest in almost two months, as
better-than-forecast economic growth increased bets the Bank of
Israel will keep interest rates unchanged this month.  The yield on the 4.25 percent notes due March 2023 gained
five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 3.89 percent,
the highest since June 24, at the close in Tel Aviv.  One-year
interest-rate swaps , an indicator of investor expectations for
rates over the period, fell one basis point to 1.15 percent on
Aug. 16. The benchmark  TA-25 Index (TA-25)  of equities rose 0.2 percent.  The Israeli economy expanded an annualized 5.1 percent in
the second quarter compared with a revised 2.7 percent in the
previous quarter, driven by an increase in exports and  consumer
spending , the Central Bureau of Statistics said. The median
estimate of eight economists surveyed by Bloomberg was 3
percent. Israel’s purchasing managers index increased in July to
47.6 from 46 in the previous month, Bank Hapoalim said.  “The good economic data should postpone another  interest
rate  cut at the end of this month,” Assaf Rosenberg, head of
fixed-income sales at Excellence Nessuah Investment House Ltd.,
in  Ramat Gan , Israel, said by phone.  The central bank’s monetary policy committee, led by
interim Governor Karnit Flug, will hold interest rates at 1.25
percent on August 26, according all 15 analysts  surveyed  by
Bloomberg. The Bank of Israel has gradually lowered interest
rates from 3.25 percent in 2011 to help boost economic growth.  Annual inflation accelerated to 2.2 percent from 2 percent
after the government increased sales taxes, the statistics
bureau said Aug. 15. The government’s target range for annual
inflation is 1 percent to 3 percent. Economic growth is forecast
to slow to 3.2 percent in 2014, from 3.8 percent this year, the
central bank said June 24.  The  Finance Ministry  will tomorrow sell a combined 1.2
billion shekels ($336 million) in government bonds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
