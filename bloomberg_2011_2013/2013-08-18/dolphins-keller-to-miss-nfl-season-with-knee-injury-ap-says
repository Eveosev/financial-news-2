Dustin Keller  will miss the National
Football League season with a right knee injury, leaving the
 Miami Dolphins  without an experienced tight end, the Associated
Press reported.  Keller was hurt in a tackle by D.J. Swearinger during the
second quarter of a 24-17 defeat at the Houston Texans
yesterday, AP said.  Keller signed a $4.25 million, one-year contract with the
Dolphins in March after five seasons with the New York Jets, AP
said.  Options to replace Keller include fourth-round draft pick
Dion Sims and Michael Egnew, who played in two games last year
after being drafted in the third round, AP said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
