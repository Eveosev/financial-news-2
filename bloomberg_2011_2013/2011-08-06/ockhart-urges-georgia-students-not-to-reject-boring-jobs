President  Dennis Lockhart  urged a group of graduating college
students to widen their job search and be open to all
opportunities.  “There are no boring jobs if you set out to improve
whatever you touch,” Lockhart said today to students graduating
from the  University of Georgia  in Athens.  Lockhart, 64, a former Georgetown University professor,
urged the audience not to follow the example of some of his
former students who were “quick to dismiss a particular job
opportunity as below them, or worse, boring.”  “Respect your work,” Lockhart said. “It is one of life’s
blessings.”  U.S. college graduates enter a labor market weighed down by
9.1 percent unemployment in July. Payrolls rose last month by
117,000 workers after a 46,000 increase in June that was larger
than earlier estimated, the Labor Department said yesterday in
 Washington .  Lockhart didn’t comment on the  U.S. economy  or monetary
policy in his remarks.  The Federal Open Market Committee is scheduled to meet Aug.
9 amid signs the two-year-old U.S. economic recovery slowed in
response to higher energy prices and disruptions in the supply
of goods from Japan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
