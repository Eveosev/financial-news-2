Nick Leeson , the trader whose $1
billion of bad trades in 1995 caused the collapse of Barings
Bank, apologized to his former boss, the  BBC  reported.  A BBC radio program brought together Leeson and Peter Norris, now chairman of Virgin Group Holdings, and Leeson
apologized for the first time, the BBC  said on its website .
Leeson served more than three years in a Singapore prison for
hiding losses for forging documents and deceiving auditors, the
BBC said. Barings was Britainâ€™s oldest merchant bank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
