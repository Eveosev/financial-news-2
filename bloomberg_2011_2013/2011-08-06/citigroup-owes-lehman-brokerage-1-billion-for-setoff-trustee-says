Citigroup Inc. (C) , which seized $1
billion pledged to it by  Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ) ’s
brokerage and froze $300 million of the defunct firm’s assets,
must pay the money back because it wasn’t protected by so-called
‘safe harbor’ law governing securities transactions when it set
off the funds against money owed, the trustee for the bankrupt
brokerage said in a court filing yesterday.  Citigroup has said the trustee’s lawsuit fails on
“multiple” legal grounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
