The  New York Yankees  defeated the
 Boston  Red Sox 3-2 for their eighth straight victory and moved
into sole possession of first place in the American League East
Division for the first time since July 6.  Curtis Granderson had a run-scoring single and Nick Swisher
added a run-scoring double as the Yankees scored all their runs
in the sixth inning to overcome a 2-0 deficit last night at
Boston’s Fenway Park.  Boone Logan, the second of six  New York  pitchers, threw one
inning for the victory. Mariano Rivera pitched the ninth,
striking out two, for his 29th save.  New York is 69-42. The Red Sox dropped to 68-43 with their
second straight home loss.  In other American League games, it was Toronto 5, Baltimore
4; Detroit 4, Kansas City 3 in 10 innings; Tampa Bay 8, Oakland
4; the Chicago White Sox 5, Minnesota 3; Texas 8, Cleveland 7 in
11 innings, and the Los Angeles Angels defeating the Seattle
Mariners 1-0 in 10 innings.  Dan Uggla extended his hitting streak to 26 games with a
two-run single as the  Atlanta Braves  won 4-1 at the  New York
Mets , who lost their fifth straight game and fell below .500 at
55-56.  Craig Counsell singled as a pinch-hitter in the ninth
inning for the Milwaukee Brewers in their 8-1 win at Houston,
breaking his 0-for-45 slump and getting his first hit since June
10. The Major League Baseball record is 46 consecutive at-bats
without a hit, set in 1909 by Bill Bergen of the Brooklyn
Superbas.  The Chicago Cubs won 4-3 at home against the Cincinnati
Reds; the San Diego Padres won 15-5 at Pittsburgh; St. Louis
defeated Florida 3-2; the Los Angeles Dodgers won 7-4 at Arizona;
the Philadelphia Phillies won 9-2 for their second straight win
at the  San Francisco  Giants in a rematch of last year’s National
League Championship Series, and  Washington  won 5-3 at Colorado.  Rockies pitcher Juan Nicasio was hit in the head with a
line drive in the second inning and was taken from the field on
a stretcher. The Rockies announced during the eighth inning that
Nicasio was resting comfortably while undergoing tests at a
hospital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
