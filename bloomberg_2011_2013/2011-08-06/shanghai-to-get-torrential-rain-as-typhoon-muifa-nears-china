Typhoon Muifa, which may be the
strongest storm to hit  China  this year, will bring torrential
rain to  Shanghai  and the neighboring province of Zhejiang, the
National Meteorological Center said today.  The storm, currently moving on China’s East Sea, may land
in eastern Zhejiang or Jiangsu province tonight or tomorrow, the
forecaster said on its  website . Ships should immediately seek
shelter from the storm’s winds, it said.  Hundreds of thousands of people were evacuated and Air
China Ltd. canceled more than 30 flights on the approaching
storm, the official Xinhua News Agency reported yesterday. Muifa
may affect 10 provinces and its rains may continue for more than
10 days, the Ministry of Water Resources said on Aug. 4.  --William Bi. Editor: Paul Tighe  To contact the reporter on this story:
