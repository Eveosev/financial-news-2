Saudi Arabian shares tumbled for a
third day, sending the benchmark index to its largest intraday
drop since March, amid rising concerns about the global economy
after Standard & Poor’s cut the U.S.’s credit rating for the
first time.  Saudi Basic Industries Corp. (SABIC) , or Sabic, the world’s biggest
petrochemicals maker, fell the most in five months.  Al Rajhi
Bank (RJHI) , the kingdom’s largest publicly traded lender by market
value, reached its lowest price since March.  The 147-company  Tadawul All Share Index (SASEIDX)  slumped 5.5 percent
to 6,073.44, the steepest decline since March 1, at the 3:30
p.m. close in Riyadh. All 15 industry groups fell. The gauge has
fallen 10.5 percent from the year-high of 6,788.42 on Jan. 16.  “The Saudi market is reacting to the steep declines in
global markets over the weekend,” said Asim Bukhtiar, an equity
analyst at Riyad Capital. “Growing concerns of the U.S.
relapsing into recession are driving sentiment.”  U.S. stocks fell the most in 32 months this week and
European stocks posted their biggest weekly loss since November
2008. The  S&P 500  slumped 7.2 percent, the biggest weekly drop
since November that year. The Stoxx 600 Europe Index tumbled 9.9
percent to 238.88 this past week, the gauge’s lowest level in 13
months.  Oil tumbled 9.2 percent this week, the biggest drop since
the week ended May 6. Crude for September delivery was settled
at $86.88 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Saudi
Arabia holds 20 percent of the world’s proven oil reserves.  U.S. Downgrade  “The combination of the global equity and commodities
meltdown during the Saudi weekend, and to a lesser extent the
expected downgrade by S&P, is having an impact on all sectors of
the market,” said Fuad Aghabi, a director at Ajeej Capital, in
Riyadh.  Standard & Poor’s  downgraded the U.S.’s AAA credit rating
for the first time since 1941. S&P lowered the U.S. one level to
AA+ while keeping the outlook at “negative”. The U.S.
immediately lashed out at S&P, with a Treasury Department
spokesman saying the firm’s analysis contains a $2 trillion
error. The rating may be cut to AA within two years if spending
reductions are lower than agreed to,  interest rates  rise or
“new fiscal pressures” result in higher general government
debt, the New York-based firm said yesterday.  “At this point, the impact of the ratings downgrade is not
evident,” said Bukhtiar. “Regional markets will take their cue
from global markets on Monday when they open.” Saudi Arabia’s
holdings of foreign securities rose 12 percent this year to a
record 1.32 trillion riyals ($350 billion) as of June 30, Saudi
central bank data show.  Sabic,  Al Rajhi   Sabic slumped 5.8 percent to 97.75 riyals, the sharpest
decline since March 1. Al Rajhi declined 5.2 percent to 68.25
riyals, the lowest price since March 2.  National
Industrialization Co. (NIC) , known as Tasnee, dropped 7.3 percent, the
sharpest fall since April 4, to 39.30 riyals.  A total of 144 shares dropped while one stock gained.
Rabigh Refining and Petrochemicals Co. sank 9.9 percent to 22.60
riyals and  Kingdom Holding Co. (KINGDOM)  weakened 9.6 percent to 7.10
riyals.  “This is a reaction to global instabilities, however, the
fundamentals of the Saudi market remains strong, evidenced by
very good first-half results,” said Aghabi.  Saudi Arabia’s stock exchange is the only Gulf Arab bourse
open on Saturdays.  To contact the reporter on this story:
