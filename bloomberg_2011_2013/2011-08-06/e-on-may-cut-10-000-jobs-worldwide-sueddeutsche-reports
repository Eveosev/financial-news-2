E.ON AG (EOAN) ,  Germany ’s biggest utility,
may cut as many as 10,000 jobs worldwide as it seeks savings in
the wake of an accelerated phase-out of nuclear power at home,
the  Sueddeutsche Zeitung  newspaper reported, citing no one.  The Dusseldorf-based company’s supervisory board may
discuss the payroll outlook at a meeting next week, the
newspaper said. Carsten Thomsen-Bendixen, a spokesman for E.ON,
declined to comment on the report today.  “E.ON is currently considering adjustments in its
strategy,” said Thomsen-Bendixen by phone. “No decisions have
so far been taken.”  To contact the reporter on this story: Brian Parkin in Berlin at
