The majority of the French public
said they didn’t have confidence that the country’s current crop
of political leaders, including President  Nicolas Sarkozy , are
capable of cutting debt, according to an Ifop poll.  When asked to choose between Sarkozy and Socialist Party
leader and candidate Martine Aubry, 28 percent chose the
president as more able to control the debt, 20 percent chose
Aubry, and 52 percent said they didn’t have confidence in
either, according to the poll for Sud-Ouest Dimanche newspaper.  When the choice was Sarkozy and  Francois Hollande , who is
leading in the polls to win the Socialist Party’s nomination, 27
percent opted for the president, 25 percent for the challenger,
and 48 percent for neither.  France holds presidential elections next May. The poll,
which involved 1,001 people questioned online, follows a survey
in June where 61 percent of the French said  France  could suffer
a debt crisis similar to Greece’s.  To contact the reporter on this story:
