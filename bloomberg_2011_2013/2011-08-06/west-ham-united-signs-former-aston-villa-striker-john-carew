West Ham signed former Aston Villa
striker  John Carew , the east London club said on its website.  Carew is the fifth signing of the offseason for West Ham,
which was relegated to the second-tier Championship from the
Premier League after last season.  The 31-year-old scored 54 goals in 133 games for Villa. He
spent the second half of last season on loan at Stoke.  Carew did not sign his contract in time to play in
tomorrowâ€™s season opening game against Cardiff at Upton Park.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
