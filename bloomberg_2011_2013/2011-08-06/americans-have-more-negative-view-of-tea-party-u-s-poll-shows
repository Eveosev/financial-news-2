Americans have a more negative view
of the conservative  Tea Party  movement after the debate over
raising the U.S. debt limit, according to a New York Times/CBS
News survey.  Forty percent of respondents have an unfavorable perception
of the group, which supports tax reductions and lower government
debt, the  New York Times  reported today. That compares with 18
percent, who had a “not favorable” view in an April 2010
survey.  The Tea Party may have benefited from a lower public
profile people last year, when 46 percent of respondents claimed
they hadn’t heard enough about it to form an opinion, the paper
said. The figure stood at 21 percent this year, it reported.  The paper didn’t say how many people were polled or give a
margin of error.  To contact the reporter on this story:
