Chelsea has reached an agreement with
Anderlecht on the signing of striker Romelu Lukaku, the Premier
League club said on its website.  The move is subject to the 18-year-old Belgian passing a
medical exam and agreeing to a personal contract. Lukaku has
been linked with a move to the Blues for most of the offseason.  “He is a very interesting young prospect and we have been
able to position ourselves to be able to get this kind of
talent,” Chelsea manager Andre Villas-Boas said.  Lukaku scored 16 goals for Anderlecht last season. He’s
also scored once in 10 appearances with the Belgian national
team.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
