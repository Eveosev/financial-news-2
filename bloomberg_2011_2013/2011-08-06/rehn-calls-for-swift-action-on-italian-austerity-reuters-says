Olli Rehn, the European Union’s
Economic and Monetary Commissioner, said he supports  Italy ’s
moves to accelerate austerity plans and that reforms should be
implemented swiftly, Reuters reported today, citing a telephone
interview with the official.  Italy’s actions to cut its debts at a faster pace in order
to achieve a balanced budget by 2013, as announced by the
country’s Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi yesterday, will help
improve confidence and could aid growth, Rehn said, according to
Reuters. He declined to comment on whether Italy’s actions would
spur the  European Central Bank  to buy Italian bonds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
