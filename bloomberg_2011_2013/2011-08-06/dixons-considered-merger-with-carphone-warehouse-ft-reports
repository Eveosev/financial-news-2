Dixons Retail Plc (DXNS)  considered a merger
with  Carphone Warehouse Group Plc (CPW)  earlier this year, though
talks broke down over valuations, Mark Kleinman reported in his
In The Loop column in the  Financial Times .  The talks were advanced enough for the companies to agree
on a new board, Kleinman said, citing unidentified people close
to the negotiations. Dixons spokesman Mark Webb when contacted
by phone said the company never comments on rumors or
speculation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
