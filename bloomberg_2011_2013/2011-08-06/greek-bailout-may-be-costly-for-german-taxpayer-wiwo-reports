Greece â€™s new rescue package forged by
euro region leaders last month could be costly for German
taxpayers even if the Greek government repays all the aid,
 Wirtschaftswoche  business weekly reported, citing a study.  German taxpayers faced a 38.6 billion-euro ($55.1 billion)
bill if Greece returned all aid by 2020, said the magazine in a
pre-released report citing the Berlin-based  DIW  economic
institute. If Greece pays off just a third of the aid the bill
would rise to 65.5 billion euros ($93.5 billion), the magazine
said.  The DIW based its findings mainly on potential costs linked
to European Financial Stability Facility and potential losses on
Greek debt held by the  European Central Bank .  To contact the reporter on this story:
