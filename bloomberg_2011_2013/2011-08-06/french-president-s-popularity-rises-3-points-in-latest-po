French President  Nicolas Sarkozy ’s
popularity is recovering from record lows, according to a poll.  The number of French with confidence in the president rose
three percentage points this month to 24 percent, while those
expressing a lack of confidence fell five points to 70 percent,
according to a Harris Interactive poll for  Le Parisien .  Confidence in Prime Minister  Francois Fillon  rose one point
to 32 percent, with those not having confidence falling four
points to 61 percent.  Sarkozy is benefiting from his actions to stem the European
debt crisis which have reinforced his presidential image, Jean-
 Daniel Levy , head of Harris’ opinion division, said in a
commentary in the newspaper.  The internet-based poll questioned 1,000 people on Aug. 3
and Aug. 4. No margin of error was given.  To contact the reporter on this story:
