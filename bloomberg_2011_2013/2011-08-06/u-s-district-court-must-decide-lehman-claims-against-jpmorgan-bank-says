JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) , sued for
$8.6 billion by bankrupt  Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ) , said the
defunct firmâ€™s common law claims against it must be decided by a
U.S. district court judge rather than a bankruptcy judge.  In a court filing yesterday in  Manhattan , the New York-
based bank said the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in the Anna Nicole
Smith case limited the power of bankruptcy judges to rule on
such claims.  To contact the reporter on this story:
