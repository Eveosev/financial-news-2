Australia ’s economic outlook is
favorable, with activity “expected to bounce back in the second
quarter” of the year, the  International Monetary Fund  said.  “We project real GDP growth of 2 percent for calendar year
2011 and 3.5 percent in 2012 on the back of strong demand for
commodities and private investment in mining and liquefied
natural gas,” the IMF said in a  statement  on its website
yesterday. “We expect employment to grow at a slower pace than
in recent years but the  unemployment rate  should remain below 5
percent in 2011 and 2012.”  The country’s external current account deficit is expected
to narrow to 1 percent of GDP in 2011 before “progressively
widening to about 6.5 percent of GDP in the medium term,”
assuming the real effective  exchange rate  remains at its current
level, the IMF said.  Australia’s recovery is being driven by a mining boom, with
trade at “historic highs reflecting strong demand for
commodities from  China  and other Asian economies,” according to
the Washington-based IMF.  The risks to Australia’s economy are “broadly balanced,”
the fund said.  “An upside risk is that investment in the resource sector
could be larger than expected, boosting growth and adding to
inflation pressures,” the IMF said. “On the downside, a key
risk is that the global recovery stalls or Asian growth falters,
impacting demand for commodities.”  The Australian dollar had the biggest weekly decline
against its U.S. counterpart since May 2010 on Aug. 5 after the
 Reserve Bank  of Australia lowered its forecast for 2011 economic
growth.  The RBA cut its forecast for growth in 2011 to an average
of 2 percent from its May 6 estimate of 3.25 percent. It
increased its estimate for the increase in 2012 gross domestic
product to 4.5 percent from 4.25 percent. The estimates assumed
the cash rate to be unchanged over the forecast period, compared
with “the technical assumption in May of a 50 basis points rise
by mid-2013,” the RBA said on Aug. 5.  To contact the reporter on this story:
