Ezcorp Inc. (EZPW) , a U.S. operator of pawn
shops, is buying a 53 percent interest in Australia’s Cash
Converters, the Times of  London  reported without saying where it
got the information.  Cash Converters, which has 200 mostly franchised stores in
London and 160 stores in Australia, is expected to list on the
London Stock Exchange Aug. 8,  the Times  said. Ezcorp’s purchase
comes after regulators banned payday loans in at least 13 U.S.
states and the number of pawn shops in Britain rises, according
to the paper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
