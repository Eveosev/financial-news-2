Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4) ’s investment
plans may be affected by the slump in global stock and bond
markets, Folha de S.Paulo  reported , citing Chief Executive
Officer Jose Sergio Gabrielli.  The state-owned oil company needs to raise as much as $91
billion to finance investments in coming years and the recent
decline in the company’s shares may make that effort more
difficult, Folha said, citing Gabrielli.  To contact the reporter on this story:
