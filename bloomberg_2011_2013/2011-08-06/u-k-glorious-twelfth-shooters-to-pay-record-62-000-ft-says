Hunters will pay record prices of
about 38,000 pounds ($62,000) per day to shoot grouse in the
U.K. this year, the  Financial Times  reported, citing sports
agents.  Quoted prices for exclusive shooting rights are holding at
around last year’s level of 150 pounds to 160 pounds per brace
of two birds, with the final cost higher than earlier because of
an increase in taxes, the newspaper said.  A typical day may now cost 38,000 pounds before agents’
commissions, insurance and travel costs. Higher prices, sluggish
economic growth and a breeding season disrupted by dry weather
hasn’t diminished demand for shooting, the FT said.  Hunters refer to Aug. 12 as “the glorious twelfth”
because it marks the beginning of the season for grouse, a
family of birds also known as moor game found in the British and
Irish countryside.  To contact the reporter on this story:
