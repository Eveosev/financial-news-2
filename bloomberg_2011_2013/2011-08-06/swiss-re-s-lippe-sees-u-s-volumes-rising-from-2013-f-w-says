Swiss Re Ltd. Chief Executive Officer
Stefan Lippe said third party risk volumes in the company’s U.S.
business will expand “strongly” from 2013 after a quota share
agreement with  Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A)  expires, Finanz und
Wirtschaft reported today, citing an interview.  Swiss Re will see “higher than average growth potential”
in the U.S. as prices rise, while investors have told the CEO
that they would prefer the insurer to use capital reserves for
expansion rather than share buybacks, the Swiss newspaper
reported, citing Lippe.  To contact the reporter on this story:
