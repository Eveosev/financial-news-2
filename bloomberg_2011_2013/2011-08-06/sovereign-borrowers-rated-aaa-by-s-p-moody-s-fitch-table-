Following is a table of the remaining
sovereign borrowers with AAA ratings from  Standard & Poor’s ,
Moody’s Investors Service and Fitch Ratings, and those with a
top ranking from at least one of the firms, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  S&P cut the U.S. late yesterday by one level to AA+ and
said the rating could be lowered further to AA within two years
if spending reductions are lower than agreed to, interest rates
rise or “new fiscal pressures” result in higher general
government debt.
