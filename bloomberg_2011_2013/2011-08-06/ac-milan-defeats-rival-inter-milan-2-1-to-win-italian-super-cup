AC Milan came from behind to defeat
rival Inter Milan 2-1 and win the Italian Super Cup for a record
sixth time.  The game, the traditional season opener between the Serie A
champion and Italian Cup winner, was played at the Bird’s Nest
Stadium in Beijing to help promote soccer in  Asia .  Wesley Sneijder , who’s been linked with a move to the
Premier League, scored with a free kick in the first half to
give Inter the lead.  Milan, which won its 18th Serie A title last season, tied
the score in the 60th minute on Zlatan Ibrahimovic’s header.
Kevin-Prince Boateng then scored the game-winner with 22 minutes
left when he tapped in the rebound after Alexandre Pato’s shot
hit the post.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
