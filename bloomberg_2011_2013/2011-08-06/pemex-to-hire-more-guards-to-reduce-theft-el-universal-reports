Petroleos Mexicanos ,  Latin America ’s
biggest oil producer, plans to hire 280 employees and improve
its security equipment in an attempt to reduce vandalism and
theft, newspaper El Universal reported today on its  website .  The company has 1,144 employees guarding 288 company
installations across  Mexico , the newspaper reported, citing an
unidentified person at Pemex’s corporate administration
department. The theft of oil has been a problem for years and
has since become more prevalent with other products like
gasoline, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
