European governments must act to
inspire more confidence and stimulate the economy to react to
market turbulence, Spanish Governance Minister Ramon Jauregui
said.  “The European Union July 21 accords are complex and
markets react much faster than governments can work,” Jauregui
said in an interview today with Spanish radio Cadena Ser.  Spain  is not particularly targeted by the markets which are
“attacking the heart of the euro”, including countries like
 Italy , Belgium and even France, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
