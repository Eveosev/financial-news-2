Jordan has “faith” that the dollar
and dollar debt “will continue to be the prime benchmark for
risk-free debt,” Jordan’s Central Bank Governor Faris Sharaf
said today by telephone.  “The commodity market is a dollar-based market, and the
U.S. government remains a risk-free debt,” even after  Standard
& Poor’s  downgrade of the U.S. credit rating to AA+, Sharaf
said.  “Jordan transacts in dollars with the rest of the world,
so the dollar will always be the dominant currency, and we are
willing to accept U.S. risk even with S&P’s action.”  Jordan has about $11.5 billion in foreign currency
reserves, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
