General and local elections in
Mauritania, set for Oct. 16, can be postponed if the majority
and the opposition agree, President Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz said
in a television debate today in Nouakchott.  The debate was organized to commemorate the second
anniversary of the president taking office after his election on
July 18, 2009. The currency reserves of the central bank total
$511 million, except oil, against $165 million in 2008, Aziz
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
