The Church of England has told
companies that it will vote against any executive bonuses that
it considers unjust, the  Financial Times  reported, citing an
unidentified spokesman.  The Church Commissioners, which manage a 5.3 billion-pound
($8.7 billion) investment and property portfolio for the Church,
told companies that it wonâ€™t back any pay deals that give
executives bonuses in excess of four times their salary.  To contact the reporter on this story:
