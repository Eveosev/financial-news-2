Chelsea has instructed several
agents to find a buyer for striker Didier Drogba, the Times
reported.  Chelsea has yet to decide if it will keep Drogba, who has
one year remaining on his contract, and is keen to access his
value, the Times said. The 33-year-old wants to stay, but may be
forced out if the club receives an offer in excess of 10 million
pounds ($16 million), the newspaper said.  Drogba has scored 94 Premier League goals since joining
Chelsea from Marseille in 2004. Marseille had hoped to bring
him back but would be unable to match his 100,000-pounds-per-
week salary, the Times said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
