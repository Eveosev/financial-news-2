A group of attackers in  Nigeria 
threw an explosive at a police patrol in the northeastern city
of Maiduguri and fought a gun battle with officers before four
of them were arrested, police said.  Nobody was hurt by the blast, the second in two days in the
city that is the capital of Borno state.  “The impact shattered
the windscreen of the rear vehicle” in the patrol group, the
police said in a statement handed to reporters.  Nigeria, Africa’s biggest oil producer, is voting today in
an election to choose a president to lead the nation until 2015.
President  Goodluck Jonathan , a southern Christian, is being
challenged by 18 rivals, with northern Muslims Muhammadu Buhari
and Nuhu Ribadu among the top contenders. Nigeria,  Africa ’s most
populous nation, is roughly split between a mainly Muslim north
and a predominantly Christian south.  Authorities in Nigeria’s north have blamed a group known as
Boko Haram, which draws inspiration from  Afghanistan ’s Taliban
movement, for a spate of bomb attacks and killings targeting
government officials and the security forces since last year.  There was a blast late yesterday at a Maiduguri office of
the Independent National Electoral Commission, Police
Commissioner Mike Zuokumor told reporters. Earlier in the day
two people, including a soldier, were killed and seven others
injured when unknown gunmen opened fire on residents in the
city’s Gwange distract, according to police.  To contact the reporter on this story:
