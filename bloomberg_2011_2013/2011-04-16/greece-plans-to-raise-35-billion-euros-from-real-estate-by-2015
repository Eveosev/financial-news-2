Greece  plans to raise 35 billion
euros ($50.5 billion) from state-owned real estate assets by
2015, according to a report released yesterday by the Greek
 Finance Ministry .  “The state owns a vast portfolio of real estate assets
that today is underdeveloped or is exploited by uncontrolled,
private vested interests,” the Finance Ministry wrote in the
presentation, adding that the development and management of the
assets is an “obligation for the state.”  The plan is part of a 50 billion euro asset-sale program to
reduce Greece’s public debt, the highest in the European Union
as a percentage of gross domestic product.  The government will value and register all state-owned
commercial real estate assets and record them for the first time
in a single land registry, according to the presentation.  Greece is the only country in  Europe  without a centralized
registry of deeds. About 40 percent of registered state
properties are disputed and an additional 25 percent don’t have
enough data on their legal status and are “questionable,”
Finance Minister  George Papaconstantinou  told lawmakers last
month.  Greek and international banks will create real estate
investment portfolios grouping the assets and four of them will
be presented by 2012, according to the presentation. The first
will be put forward in June.  Other measures to be taken this year by the government to
ensure the success of the plan will include legally establishing
long-term leaseholds, defining conditions for vacation and
tourist accommodation and speeding up processes for obtaining
building and development licences, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
