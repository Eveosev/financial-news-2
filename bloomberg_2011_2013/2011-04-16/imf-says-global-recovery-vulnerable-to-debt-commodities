The  International Monetary Fund 
said strengthening global growth is “vulnerable” to risks from
debt and commodity prices and that greater surveillance is
needed to prevent another crisis.  “There’s a sense around the table in all the discussions
that we’re still in a fragile situation,” Singapore Finance
Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam said at a press briefing in
Washington today. “We need to develop the ability of the fund
to address risk proactively. We’ve learned from very painful
experience in the past few years that nothing is isolated.”  He said that “there are significant vulnerabilities still
in the global economic and financial system.”  The IMF said in a statement today that “the global
recovery is gaining strength but remains vulnerable.” The
committee called for “enhanced financial sector oversight of
risks related to shadow banking activities” and agreed “to
maintain momentum to tackle noncooperative jurisdictions,”
according to the statement.  Asked about inflation in  China ,  Dominique Strauss-Kahn , the
IMF’s managing director, said at the same press briefing that it
is “still under control, and I don’t expect it will be out of
control.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
