GDF Suez (GSZ)  SA’s Electrabel SA and
EDF’s SPE-Luminus unit may pay 55 percent less than anticipated
for a Belgian levy on nuclear power producers,  Le Soir  reported,
citing a report from the Belgian National Bank.  The companies may face a bill of as much as 900 million
euros ($1.3 billion) as part of a deal with the government to
keep nuclear plants open, Le Soir said. That would be 1.1
billion euros less than energy regulators estimated, according
to the newspaper. Electrabel will pay 87 percent of the levy and
SPE 13 percent, Le Soir said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
