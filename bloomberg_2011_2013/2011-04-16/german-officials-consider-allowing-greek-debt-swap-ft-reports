German officials are considering
allowing holders of Greek debt to swap them for safer
securities, the Financial Times reported, citing unindentified
Chancellery and Finance Ministry officials.  Under the plan, bondholders would swap Greek debt
securities, at market prices, for less risky securities that
would be guaranteed by Eurozone nations. Another option being
considered would be for a trust to buy the bonds and extend
their maturity or retire them, the paper reported.  The plans would only work if the Greek government accepted
them, the paper cited an official as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
