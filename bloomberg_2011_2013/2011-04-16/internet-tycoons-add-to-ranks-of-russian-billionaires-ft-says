The number of billionaires in
 Russia  surged to a record last year as commodity prices rose and
the nation’s stock market advanced, the  Financial Times 
reported, citing the Russian edition of Forbes.  Internet tycoons helped swell the ranks of Russia’s
wealthy, with the number of billionaires rising to 101 in 2010
from 62 a year earlier, the newspaper reported. Yuri Milner,
chairman of Mail.ru Group Ltd. with an estimated wealth of $1
billion, joined the list of the nation’s top 100 wealthiest
people this year, it said.  The co-founders of Internet search-engine Yandex, Arkady
Volozh and Ilya Segalovich, were also included in the list.  To contact the reporter on this story:
