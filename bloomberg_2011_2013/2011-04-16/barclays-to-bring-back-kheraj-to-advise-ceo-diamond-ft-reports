Barclays Plc (BARC)  will name Naguib Kheraj as vice chairman next week, four years after the
executive left the bank, the  Financial Times  reported.  Kheraj, who advised the lender on its failed takeover bid
for ABN Amro Holding NV, will advise Chief Executive Officer  Bob Diamond  and Finance Director Chris Lucas on a range of issues as
part of the role, the newspaper said.  Giles Croot, a spokesman for Barclays, declined to comment
