A group of U.S. investors agreed to
buy a controlling stake in three-time Italian soccer champion AS
Roma and will make a mandatory buyout offer for the rest of the
club.  A newly created company, 60 percent controlled by a group
led by Boston Red Sox partner Thomas DiBenedetto and 40 percent
by bank  UniCredit SpA (UCG) , is purchasing about 67 percent of AS Roma
for 60.3 million euros ($87 million), or 0.6781 euro a share,
according to a stock-exchange statement late yesterday.  Roma, which last won the Italian title in 2001, was put up
for sale in July because the Sensi family accumulated debt of
more than 300 million euros with Milan-based UniCredit. The bank
agreed to swap the debt for equity and jointly owns a 67 percent
stake in the team with the Sensi family’s oil company,
Italpetroli.  The new investors will proceed with a mandatory buyout
offer for AS Roma at 0.6781 euro per share, compared with
yesterday’s closing price of 1.166 euros.  The deal, which requires regulatory approval, would result
in the U.S. investors becoming the only foreign group to control
a team in  Italy ’s top league.  To contact the reporter on this story:
