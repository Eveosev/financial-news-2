The Edinburgh and Manchester
International art festivals, the two largest of their kind in
the U.K., are turning to overseas funding as they face spending
cuts from their own government, the Financial Times reported.  The National Ballet of  China ’s ‘The Peony Pavilion,’ which
will appear at the Edinburgh festival this year, is subsidized
by that nation’s own government. Overseas sponsorship for the
festival has risen six-fold in the past five years, the paper
reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
