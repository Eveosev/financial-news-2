Saudi Arabian shares closed little
changed as worse-than-estimated earnings at Saudi banks offset
optimism surging oil prices would further bolster the economy of
the world’s largest crude producer.  Al Rajhi Bank (RJHI) , Saudi Arabia’s largest publicly traded
lender by market value, and  Samba Financial Group (SAMBA)  tumbled, while
 Saudi Basic Industries Corp. (SABIC) , the world’s largest petrochemicals
maker, climbed to the highest level in three months.  The 146-company Tadawul All Share Index advanced less than
0.1 percent to 6,604.97 at the 3:30 p.m. close in Riyadh, the
gauge’s highest level since April 11, as more than two stocks
climbed for every one that dropped. The gauge declined as much
as 0.2 percent and climbed as much as 0.4 percent during intra-
day trading.  “The market lacks direction today on mixed signals
regarding bank results announced last week,” said Asim Bukhtiar, an equity analyst at Riyad Capital. “The results
failed to meet lofty expectations of a dramatic turnaround in
banks’ performance in the first quarter.”  Al Rajhi  reported last week a 1 percent increase in first-
quarter profit to 1.7 billion riyals ($453 million), while
Samba, the Kingdom’s second-largest lender, reported a 7 percent
drop in first-quarter net income to 1.12 billion riyals as
income from special commissions dropped.  “Investors can’t seem to reconcile continually
disappointing Samba results with an optimistic outlook,”
Bukhtiar said. “We think the rebound will occur in the second
quarter.”  Al Rajhi dropped 0.7 percent to 75.75 riyals, the lowest
level since March 19, while Samba tumbled 0.5 percent to 54.75
riyals, the lowest since March 21.  Sabic jumped 0.9 percent to 109.50 riyals, the highest
since Jan. 18.  Oil rose for a third day in  New York  yesterday. Crude oil
for May delivery climbed $1.55 to settle at $109.66 a barrel on
the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Prices are up 28 percent from
a year ago.  Kingdom Holding Co. (KINGDOM)  dropped 4.4 percent, the most since
March 15, to 8.70 riyals, after the investment company
controlled by billionaire Prince Alwaleed bin Talal said it’s
willing to give up disputed land in Egypt in return for
investments the Saudi company had made.  Saudi Cement (SACCO)  Co. gained 2.3 percent, the most since March
20, after the kingdom’s second-biggest cement producer reported
a 19 percent increase in first-quarter net income.  Saudi Arabia’s stock exchange is the only Gulf Arab bourse
open on Saturdays.  To contact the reporter on this story:
