NATO doesn’t have a joint
operations center with the Libyan rebels opposing the forces of
 Muammar Qaddafi , a NATO official said after a rebel spokesman
told journalists a “joint operations room” was coordinating
NATO air attacks and the movement of rebel forces.  NATO doesn’t have any day-to-day coordination function with
the opposition forces and doesn’t have any troops on the ground,
an official of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization said in an
interview. He asked not to be named for reasons of operational
protocol.  A spokesman for the rebels’ National Transitional Council,
Abdul Hafiz Ghoga, said earlier “there is a joint operations
room,” replying to a question on coordination at a news
conference in Benghazi on how NATO and the council’s forces are
coordinating their efforts against Qaddafi’s troops. Ghoga
declined to give more details.  NATO is coordinating the enforcement of a United Nations
resolution designed to protect civilians in  Libya  by using a no-
fly zone and an embargo of weapons shipments to the country.  The NATO official said that while there may be personnel
from individual nations that are performing a liaison function,
they don’t act under NATO command. The only coordination is
diplomatic, he said.  The official also denied press reports that NATO member
countries were running out of munitions needed for the Libya
mission.  To contact the reporters on this story:
