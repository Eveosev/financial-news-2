Eurasian Natural Resources Corp.
held an emergency board meeting yesterday amid a split between
directors of the mining company,  The Daily Telegraph  reported,
without citing anyone.  The composition of the board was discussed at the meeting,
which was the third in a fortnight, with some directors expected
to leave, according to the newspaper. There have been
disagreements between British non-executives, management and
