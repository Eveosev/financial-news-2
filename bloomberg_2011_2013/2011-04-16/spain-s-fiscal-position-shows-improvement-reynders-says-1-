Belgian Finance Minister  Didier Reynders  said Spain’s fiscal position has improved and that he
doesn’t see an immediate need for a “solution” in countries
besides Greece, Ireland and Portugal.  The only possibility is “for Spain to have a better
position than before,” Reynders said today in an interview with
Bloomberg News in Washington. Spain is showing “a very good
improvement and I am sure that it will be enough.”  Portugal last week followed Greece and Ireland in seeking
an international bailout and is being told by European policy
makers to implement tougher fiscal policy to obtain it. European
Union Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner  Olli Rehn  said
this week he’s “quite confident” the financial-aid package
being negotiated for  Portugal  will result in the debt crisis
being contained.  Asked if Greece will restructure its debt, Reynders said
policy makers didn’t discuss that, and instead “we discuss the
capacity for Greece” as well as Portugal and Ireland “to go
back to a better fiscal situation.” In addition, “we are
preparing stress tests for the banks” in  Europe , he said.  Spanish Finance Minister Elena Salgado said April 8 that a
financial bailout is “completely out of the question” after
neighboring Portugal asked for external aid.  To contact the reporter on this story:
