European Central Bank Vice
PresidentVitor Constancio said that it’s “very likely” that
 Portugal  was the last euro nation to need external aid.  “I certainly think it is very likely and that’s what we
hope markets will appreciate that  Europe  has created the
mechanisms to deal with the problem and that some more
vulnerable situations were dealt with,” Constancio said in an
interview at an event in  New York  yesterday. “I hope that
markets will think the same.”  He also said that it’s too early to tell when the ECB will
phase out its non-standard measures, saying that policy makers
“depend on the evolution of the situation and our
assessments.” The ECB has “already dismantled part of them and
they are temporary by nature.”  Constancio declined to comment on possible measures to deal
with euro-region banks that are reliant on ECB liquidity, saying
“when we have something to say, we will say it and not
before.”   To contact the reporter on this story:
