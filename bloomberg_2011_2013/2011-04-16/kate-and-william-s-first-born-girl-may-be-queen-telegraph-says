Prince William  and Kate Middleton’s
first-born child would accede to the throne regardless of the
child’s sex under plans to reform rules that govern the line of
succession, according to  the Daily Telegraph .  The U.K. government is examining ways to scrap the
principle of male primogeniture in order to grant any future
princesses the same rights as male heirs, the newspaper
reported, without saying where it got the information. Deputy
Prime Minister  Nick Clegg , who is responsible for constitutional
reform, has raised the matter at the Privy Council and has
obtained the Queen’s consent, according to the Telegraph. The
Privy Council advises on matters of state.  -- Editors: Andrew Blackman, Will Kennedy  To contact the reporter on this story:
