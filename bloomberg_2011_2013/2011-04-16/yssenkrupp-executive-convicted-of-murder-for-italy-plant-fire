     April 16 (Bloomberg) --A ThyssennKrupp AG executive was
convicted of murder in  Italy  yesterday for a fire at a steel
plant there in 2007, which killed seven workers.  Harald Espenhahn, ThyssenKrupp’s chief executive officer in
Italy, was sentenced to 16 1/2 in prison for the fire, which
broke out on a treatment line at the Acciai Speciali Terni plant
in Turin on Dec. 6, 2007.  Five other executives were convicted of manslaughter and
sentenced up to 13 1/2 in prison, according to Italian news
agency ANSA.  The conviction is “incomprehensible,” and the fire was a
“tragic accident,” the Essen, Germany-based steelmaker said in
an e-mailed statement.  Attorneys for Espenhahn have filed an appeal, Erwin Schneider, a spokesman for ThyssenKrupp, said in an e-mailed
statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
