Global economic growth will likely
slow next year, with  Europe  being “most pessimistic,” said Lou Jiwei, head of China’s $300 billion sovereign wealth fund.  Lou said he is concerned about the fourth quarter of this
year and all of 2012. The China Investment Corp. Chairman,
speaking at the Boao Forum for Asia held in the southern Chinese
province of Boao, cited banks’ balance sheets, debt
restructuring and sluggish demand as reasons for why he’s “most
pessimistic” about Europe.  The euro posted its biggest weekly decline since November
against the yen and dropped from a 15-month high versus the
dollar on concern a bailout for Greece may fail to prevent the
first default by a country in the 17-nation currency region.  Lou’s pessimistic outlook hasn’t stopped  China  Investment
Corp. from looking for investment opportunities in some parts of
Europe, he said. China’s sovereign wealth fund is interested in
opportunities in the European infrastructure sector, Lou said,
without giving more details.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
