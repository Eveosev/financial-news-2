The U.S.  Federal Aviation
Administration  said it suspended an air traffic controller today
“for falling asleep while on duty during the midnight shift”
at the Miami Air Route Traffic Control Center.  “According to a preliminary review of air traffic tapes,
the controller did not miss any calls from aircraft and there
was no operational impact,” the FAA said in a statement on its
website.  The FAA said the suspension was made “early this morning’
and there were 12 controllers on duty and two managers.   FAA Administrator Randy Babbitt today said he is
prohibiting scheduling practices that have been identified as
those most likely to result in air traffic controller fatigue.
The changes will be effective within 72 hours, according to the
statement.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
