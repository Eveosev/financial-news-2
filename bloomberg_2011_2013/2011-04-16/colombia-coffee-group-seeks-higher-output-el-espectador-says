Colombia ’s National Federation of
Coffee Growers wants production in the Andean nation to rise to
as much as 10 million bags this year, daily  El Espectador 
reported.  Luis Genaro Munoz, the federation’s chief executive, said
higher prices and increased volume so far this year have him
“dreaming” of higher production for 2011, up from the 9.5
million bags previously forecast, the daily cited him as saying.  Munoz also seeks to boost coffee consumption in Colombia by
30 percent over the next five years from 1.2 million 60-kilogram
(132 pounds) bags currently, El Espectador said.  Colombian coffee production climbed 24 percent to 779,000
bags in March from 629,000 bags in the same month of 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
