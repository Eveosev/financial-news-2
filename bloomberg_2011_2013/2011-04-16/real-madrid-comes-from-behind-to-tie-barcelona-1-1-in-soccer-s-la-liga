Real  Madrid , playing with 10 men,
came from behind to tie Barcelona 1-1 in a matchup of the top
two teams in Spanish soccer’s La Liga.  Cristiano Ronaldo’s penalty kick in the 82nd minute earned
Real the home draw last night at the Bernabeu Stadium. It
canceled out an earlier penalty from  Lionel Messi , after Raul Albiol received a red card for fouling  David Villa  in the area.  The draw keeps Barcelona eight points ahead of second-
place Real with six games remaining in the season. It was the
first of four meetings between the teams over the next 16 days.  Ronaldo had the game’s first chance with a long free kick
that was caught by goalkeeper Victor Valdes. Messi then tried
to chip the ball over Iker Casillas, who made the save.  Ronaldo charged into the Barcelona area in the 33rd minute
but was unable to shoot as Adriano slid to clear the ball away.
Casillas than saved Messi’s shot 10 minutes later and Adriano
cleared  Sergio Ramos ’s header off the line just before
halftime.  Ronaldo hit the goalpost with a free kick in the 50th
minute. Albiol was then sent off two minutes later fouling
Villa and Messi converted from the spot for his 49th goal of
the season.  Real tied the game with eight minutes left on Ronaldo’s
penalty, his 41st goal of the season, after Marcelo was fouled
by  Dani Alves . Real’s Sami Khedira had one final shot in the
90th minute which Valdes dived to his right to save.  The two teams will play in the Copa del Rey final in three
days before meeting in the Champions League semifinals April 27
and May 3.  To contact the reporter on this story:
