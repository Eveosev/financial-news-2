Hard Rock, the restaurant, hotel
and casino chain owned by the Seminole Indian tribe, is scouting
locations in  London  for its first U.K. hotel, the Financial
Times reported, without saying where it got the information.  The group is seeking to tap the booming London hotel market
and has assessed several venues including the Odeon West End
cinema site on Leicester Square. Hard Rock aims to open a hotel
with as many as 250 rooms that will achieve a five-star rating,
the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
