The  Federal Aviation Administration 
says it will change air traffic controllers’ work schedule rules
after the agency suspended a controller who was caught napping
while on duty.  FAA Administrator Randy Babbitt today said he is
prohibiting scheduling practices that have been identified as
those most likely to result in fatigue, following at least five
reports of controllers falling asleep at work. The changes will
be effective within 72 hours, according to a FAA statement.  Discussions with the National Air Traffic Controllers Union
are under way and more details will be released soon, the FAA
said.  A controller at the Miami Air Route Traffic Control Center
was suspended today “for falling asleep while on duty during
the midnight shift,” the FAA said.  “According to a preliminary review of air traffic tapes,
the controller did not miss any calls from aircraft and there
was no operational impact,” the FAA statement said. The FAA
said the suspension was made early this morning and there were
12 controllers on duty and two managers.  On April 13, Babbitt and Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood announced that the FAA would place an additional air
traffic controller on the midnight shift at airport control
towers and other facilities where previously there was only one.  Henry Krakowski, the FAA’s chief operating officer,
resigned April 14 after the sleeping incidents were reported.
David Grizzle, the FAA’s chief counsel, took the job as the
agency seeks a replacement.  To contact the reporters on this story:
