Kingdom Holding Co. (KINGDOM)  dropped the
most in a month in Riyadh trading after saying itâ€™s willing to
give up disputed land in  Egypt  in return for investments the
Saudi company had made.  Kingdom, controlled by billionaire Prince Alwaleed bin
Talal, tumbled 4.4 percent to 8.70 riyals, the biggest drop
since March 15.  The  investment company  offered three options to the
Egyptian prosecutor general to settle the dispute over 100,000
feddans (103,800 acres) of land it owns at Toshka, Riyadh-based
Kingdom said in a statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
