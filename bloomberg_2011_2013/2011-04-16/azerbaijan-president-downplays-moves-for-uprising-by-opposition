Riot police and plain-clothes
security officers prevented  Azerbaijan ’s opposition from
rallying in the capital and detained demonstrators.  The main opposition parties Musavat, People’s Front,
National Independence and several other groups had called for a
rally in Baku to demand political and economic reform. The
Public Chamber, an  umbrella organization  for opposition groups,
said nearly 60 people were detained. Three foreign journalists
were said to be among those held.  Police cordoned off one of Baku’s main parks to prevent
demonstrators coming together and there was a greater-than-usual
security present throughout the center of the city.  Opponents of President Ilham Aliyev’s regime are
campaigning for greater democratic freedoms in the oil-rich
former Soviet republic. Protesters won’t be able to replicate
uprisings in the Middle East that toppled regimes in Egypt and
 Tunisia , Aliyev said yesterday in state-run newspapers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
