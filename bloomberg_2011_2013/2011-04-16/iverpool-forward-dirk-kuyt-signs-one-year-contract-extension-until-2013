Liverpool forward Dirk Kuyt signed
a one-year contract extension, the Premier League soccer club
said.  The agreement runs until 2013, Sports-Promotion, Kuyt’s
management company, said on its website. The 30-year-old has
scored 61 goals in 235 appearances since joining Liverpool from
Feyenoord in 2006.  “When you see his performances, it’s obvious why we wanted
him to stay,” Damien Comolli, Liverpool’s director of football,
said on the club’s website. “I don’t think Dirk even
contemplated talking to other clubs because from day one he said
he wanted to stay, and the longer the better.”  Kuyt has scored 11 goals in all competitions this season,
including a hat trick in a 3-1 Premier League win over
 Manchester United  on March 6. Liverpool, which is sixth in the
league, visits second-place Arsenal tomorrow.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
