The euro fell the most since
November against the yen and dropped from a 15-month high versus
the dollar on concern a bailout for  Greece  may fail to prevent
the first default by a country in the 17-nation currency region.  New Zealand ’s dollar surged this week to a three-year high
versus the greenback on speculation accelerating inflation won’t
hamper the economy. The U.S. currency touched the lowest level
this month versus the yen on bets the  Federal Reserve  will
reaffirm after its April 26-27 meeting its plan to keep
borrowing costs low to support the economic growth.  “The  risk premium  in the periphery has re-emerged,” said
 Mark McCormick , a currency strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman
& Co. in New York. “People are becoming concerned with the
probability of countries like Greece and Ireland having to
potentially restructure their debt.”  The euro fell 2.3 percent to 119.96 yen yesterday, from
122.76 on April 8, in the biggest weekly decrease since a 2.5
percent drop in the five days ended Nov. 26. The euro
depreciated 0.4 percent to $1.4430, from $1.4483, after rising
above $1.45 for the first time since January 2010.  The dollar dropped 1.9 percent to 83.13 yen, from 84.76,
after touching 82.96 this week, the lowest level since March 31.  Sweden’s krona advanced to a two-week high against the euro
on speculation the Riksbank will increase its target lending
rate by a quarter-percentage point to 1.75 percent on April 20.
The krona appreciated 0.7 percent to 8.9243 versus the euro
after touching 8.9241 yesterday, the strongest since April 1.
The currency gained 0.3 percent to 6.1848 versus the dollar.  Canadian Dollar  The Canadian dollar slid from a three-year high versus the
greenback, dropping for the first time since the week ended
March 18. The  Bank of Canada  held its target lending rate at 1
percent at its meeting April 12 and said currency appreciation
“could create even greater headwinds” for the economy.  The loonie slid 0.4 percent to 95.92 cents versus the
greenback after touching 95.27 on April 8, the strongest level
since November 2007.  The New Zealand dollar rallied as Finance Minister Bill English said yesterday in a Bloomberg Television interview that
the nation’s accelerating inflation won’t hamper the economy.
Reserve Bank Governor Alan Bollard said this week the economy
will get a boost from higher farm export prices, which will
underpin the nation’s currency and may stir inflation.  The kiwi appreciated 2.1 percent to 79.95 cents after
touching 79.97 yesterday, the highest level since April 2008.
The  New Zealand dollar  was little changed at 66.46 yen.  Greece’s Yield Spread  The extra yield investors demand to hold Greek 10-year debt
instead of equivalent German securities widened to 10 percentage
points, the most since before the euro’s debut in 1999. Greece’s
10-year yield climbed to a record high of 13.84 percent.  Germany ’s Zeit newspaper reported April 14 that a
restructuring of Greek sovereign debt may involve imposing
losses of 50 to 70 percent on investors. Ireland’s credit rating
was cut two levels by Moody’s Investors Service to the lowest
investment grade as the government struggles to lower the  budget
deficit  and restore economic growth.  “Increased worries about defaults in the periphery are
weighing yet again on the euro,” said  David Mann , New York-
based head of research in the Americas at  Standard Chartered .  Finland’s anti-euro bloc is set to win record support at
tomorrow’s election, forcing the country’s biggest parties to
take a tougher stance on bailouts as they try to woo voters
tired of rescuing fiscal failures.  True Finns  Support for political groups opposed to euro-area rescues
was 47.3 percent in the latest poll by  Helsingin Sanomat ,
published April 12. The True Finns, whose leader Timo Soini said
taxpayers in the Nordic country shouldn’t have helped bail out
Greece or Ireland, has seen its support soar to 16.9 percent
from 6.9 percent a year ago.  The Dollar Index, which IntercontinentalExchange Inc. uses
to track the greenback versus the currencies of six major U.S.
trading partners, fell 0.3 percent to 74.820 after touching
74.617, the lowest level since December 2007.  Fed Vice Chairman  Janet Yellen  said this week in  New York 
that an increase in food and fuel costs will have only a
temporary impact on inflation and  consumer spending  and warrants
no reversal of record monetary stimulus.  The Fed will hold the target lending rate at zero to 0.25
percent at its meeting ending April 27, according to all of the
economists in a Bloomberg News survey.  The yen rallied 2.3 percent to 86.67 versus the Canadian
dollar on reduced demand for assets related to economic growth
as  China  said inflation reached the fastest pace in more than
two years, reviving speculation the world’s second-largest
economy will cool growth.  “Chinese inflation backs expectations the People’s Bank of
China is likely to tighten policy in the months ahead so that
could mean slower global growth, which tends to unsettle
investor appetite for risk and inspire demand for safety and the
yen,” said  Joe Manimbo , a market analyst in  Washington  at
Travelex Global Business Payments, a currency-exchange network.  To contact the reporters on this story:
