Iran ’s Persian Gulf Star refinery,
under construction in the southern city of Bandar Abbas, is 40
percent complete, Deputy Oil Minister Alireza Zeighami said.  Iran expects the first phase of the refinery which has a
production capacity of 120,000 barrels a day to come on stream
“in the next two years,” Zeighami, who also heads the  National
Iranian Oil Refining and Distribution Co. , told reporters in
Tehran today.  The Persian Gulf Star will be the first of Iran’s planned
new refinery to start and its total output capacity will be
360,000 barrels a day, Zeighami said. Iran seeks to build seven
new refineries at a total cost of $25.8 billion, he said. Other
planned facilities are Pars, Anahita, Hormoz, Khuzestan, Caspian
and Shahriyar.  Iran, the second-largest oil producer in the Middle East
after  Saudi Arabia , has relied on imports for as much as 40
percent of its gasoline needs because it lacks the refining
capacity to meet domestic consumption.  Iranian officials say the country succeeded in curbing
domestic consumption after rationing subsidized gasoline since
2007 and following the implementation in December of a five-year
plan to phase out energy subsidies.  Iran produces about 54 million liters of gasoline a day
currently and targets a daily output of 99.7 million liters at
the end of 2015, Zeighami said.  The Persian Gulf Star is mostly privately owned, while 40
percent of its shares belong to NIORDC, the official said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
