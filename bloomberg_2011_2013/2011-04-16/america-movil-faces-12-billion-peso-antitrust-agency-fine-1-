America Movil  SAB, Latin America’s
largest mobile-telephone company, said Mexico’s antitrust agency
levied a fine of 12 billion pesos ($1.03 billion) against its
Mexico unit for anticompetitive practices.  The fine stems from an investigation started in November
2006, America Movil said in a statement to the Mexican stock
exchange. The agency’s resolution is related to practices in the
market for completing calls to mobile networks, the company
said.  The company “is analyzing the legal reach, basis and
motivation of this resolution with the purpose of imposing all
and every one of the defense measures at its disposal,” America
Movil said in the statement.  Recently, competitors of America Movil, which controls 71
percent of  Mexico ’s mobile-phone market, have complained over
high interconnection fees. Eduardo Perez Motta, chief of the
antitrust agency, said in March that his agency may decide on
mobile-telephone dominance in July.  America Movil, whose largest shareholder is Mexican
billionaire  Carlos Slim , controls Telefonos de Mexico SAB, the
nation’s largest fixed-line and Internet provider, and Telmex
Internacional SAB, the regional fixed-line unit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
