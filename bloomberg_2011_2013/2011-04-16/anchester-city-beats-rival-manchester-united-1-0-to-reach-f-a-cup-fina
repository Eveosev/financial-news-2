Manchester City beat rival
Manchester United 1-0 to reach the final of English soccer’s
F.A. Cup for the first time in 30 years.  Yaya Toure scored the only goal at Wembley Stadium in
London to send City to its ninth final. United’s  Paul Scholes 
received a red card in the 72nd minute for a foot-first lunge on
Pablo Zabaleta.  “It’s fantastic,” City goalkeeper  Joe Hart  told ITV. “It
means the world. It’s just a great day for us.”  City will face Bolton or Stoke in the final May 14 at
Wembley.  United’s Dimitar Berbatov had the best scoring chances in
the first half. He was first stopped point-blank by Hart after
getting behind the defense, then sent a pass from Nani over the
crossbar from close range.  City took the lead seven minutes into the second half after
United’s Michael Carrick gave the ball away to Toure, who
carried it past Nemanja Vidic into the area and put a shot past
goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar. Scholes was then sent off with 18
minutes left for his lunge into Zabaleta’s thigh.  City lost to Tottenham in a replay in its last appearance
in the final in 1981. The Blues last won the F.A. Cup in 1969.  To contact the reporter on this story:
