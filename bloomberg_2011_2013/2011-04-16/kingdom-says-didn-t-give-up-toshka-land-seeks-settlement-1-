Kingdom Holding Co. (KINGDOM) , the  investment
company  controlled by Saudi billionaire Prince Alwaleed bin
Talal, said it didn’t give up a contested 100,000 feddans
(103,800 acres) of land it owns at Toshka in southern  Egypt .  “Kingdom Holding applied for a settlement, not a waiver,
to the Egyptian prosecutor general, by offering three options,”
the Riyadh based company said in a statement published on the
website of the  Saudi stock exchange  today.  Kingdom said its first option was to give all of the land
to the Egyptian government in return for reimbursement of the
investments it has made since buying the property in 1998. Its
second option was to sell back 50 percent of the land for 50
Egyptian pounds ($8.4) a feddan. The company also proposed
selling its unit,  Kingdom Agricultural Development Co. , which
owns the land, in an initial public offering in Egypt, “after
conducting a fair assessment of its assets by an ad hoc
agency,” according to the statement.  The land is part of the Toshka development project, which
is intended to use water diverted by canal from the Aswan High
Dam reservoir to reclaim land in Egypt’s western desert.
Kingdom’s original acquisition came under criticism after a
revolution in Egypt that ended the 30-year rule of President
 Hosni Mubarak .  To contact the reporter on this story:
