     April 16 (Bloomberg) --The German parliament should be
under no deadline pressure to decide whether to end the
country’s nuclear energy program, German Bundestag President
Norbert Lammert said in an  interview  in today’s Die Welt.  The amount of time the parliament needs for the legislative
process depends on the bill presented, he said in the interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
