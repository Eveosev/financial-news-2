The ruble rose for a second day
against the dollar, earlier touching the strongest level since
May, as oil climbed to a four-month high and the government
signaled the central bank is resisting an interest rate cut.  Russia’s currency climbed 0.1 percent to 30.2250 per dollar
by 11:50 p.m. in Moscow, after reaching 30.1650, the highest
level since May 11. The ruble strengthened 0.2 percent to
40.2150 against the euro and increased 0.2 percent against Bank
Rossii’s target dollar-euro basket to 34.7205.  Crude oil, Russia’s biggest export, gained 0.7 percent in
New York to $96.24 per barrel. Bank Rossii is resisting the
government’s calls to cut interest rates, First Deputy Prime
Minister  Igor Shuvalov  said in a Jan. 18 interview. Russia’s
central bank left borrowing costs unchanged this month after
unexpectedly raising rates in September.  “Ruble appreciation is logical and justified given the
level of the  oil prices  and the relatively high domestic
interest rates,”  Denis Korshilov , head of fixed income,
currencies and commodities of Citigroup Inc. in Moscow, said by
phone.  The yield on Russia’s ruble bond due February 2027 rose one
basis point to 7.02 percent after the  Finance Ministry  announced
the guidance for tomorrow’s placement of two ruble-denominated
issues totaling 50 billion rubles ($1.7 billion).  The Ministry plans to sell 35 billion of bonds maturing in
December 2019 and 15 billion rubles of notes due January 2028.
Yield guidance is 6.47 percent to 6.52 percent on the first
issue and 7 percent to 7.1 percent on the second.  The yield guidance for the longer bond was higher than
expected, according to  Luis Costa ,  emerging markets  strategist
at Citigroup Inc. in London.  “Secondary trading might respond to that adjusting yields
slightly up,” he said by e-mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
