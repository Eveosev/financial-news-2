A gauge of U.S. corporate credit
risk fell as 75 percent of companies that have reported profits
for the last quarter exceed analyst estimates.  The Markit CDX North American Investment Grade Index, a
credit-default swaps benchmark used to hedge against losses or
to speculate on creditworthiness, fell 1 basis point from Jan.
18 to a mid-price of 86.1 basis points as of 5:07 p.m. in New
York, according to prices compiled by Bloomberg. Bond markets
were closed yesterday for the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday.  Confidence that the economy is gaining strength is
building, as 63 of the 84 companies in the  Standard & Poor’s  500
Index that have reported fourth-quarter earnings beat forecasts,
data compiled by Bloomberg show. Among information technology
companies, 15 of 18 reported positive surprises.  The credit-swaps index typically falls as investor
confidence improves and rises as it deteriorates. The contracts
pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails to meet its
obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A basis point
equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10 million of
debt.  Google Inc., owner of the world’s largest search engine,
said today that fourth-quarter profit excluding certain items
rose to $10.65 a share. Analysts had projected per-share
earnings of $10.50.  International Business Machines Corp., the world’s biggest
computer-services provider, forecast earnings in 2013 will be at
least $16.70 a share. That compares with the $16.64 average
estimate of analysts tracked by Bloomberg.  High Yield  The  risk premium  on the Markit CDX North American High
Yield Index declined 2.7 basis points to 436.3 basis points,
Bloomberg prices show. High-yield, high-risk debt is rated below
Baa3 by Moody’s Investors Service and lower than BBB- at
Standard & Poor’s.  Tenet Healthcare Corp. (THC) , the third-largest publicly traded
U.S. hospital chain, sold $850 million of bonds to fund
repurchases of outstanding debt. The 4.5 percent notes due April
2021, rated B1 by Moody’s, yield 307 basis points more than
similar-maturity Treasuries, Bloomberg data show.  Proceeds will fund purchases of Tenet’s $714 million of 10
percent, first-lien debt due May 2018, the Dallas-based company
said in a statement.  The average relative yield on junk-rated debt was little
changed at 4.74 percentage points, Bloomberg data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
