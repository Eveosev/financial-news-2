The Nikkei 225 Stock Average may
reach 15,000 if Japan’s inflation rate reaches 2 percent,
according to Tomomi Yamashita, a senior  fund manager  at Shinkin
Asset Management Co. in Tokyo, which oversees about 500 billion
yen ($5.6 billion).  On the  Bank of Japan (8301) ’s policy decision today to adopt a 2
percent inflation target and shift to Federal Reserve-style
open-ended asset purchases:  “The long-term trend for Japanese stocks is still up. The
fact that the government and the BOJ are working together is
very positive. Also, if the inflation target of 2 percent is
reached, we could see the Nikkei 225 rise to 15,000.  ‘‘The BOJ are now on the same page as central banks
globally in increasing easing measures to stimulate the economy.
They are all lined up now.  ‘‘The volatility of stocks is increasing, which means
investors risk appetite is also increasing.  ‘‘The question now is what the actual government policies
will be and that’ll become the focus from here on.’’  To contact the reporter on this story:
