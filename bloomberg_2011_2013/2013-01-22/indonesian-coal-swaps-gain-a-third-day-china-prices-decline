Swaps prices gained a third day for
thermal coal from  Indonesia , the world’s largest exporter of the
fuel, according to Ginga Petroleum Singapore Pte.  The swap for Indonesian sub-bituminous coal with a
calorific value of 4,900 kilocalories a kilogram in the second
quarter added 10 cents to $65.60 a metric ton on a net-as-
received basis yesterday, Ginga said in an e-mail today. The
February contract rose 15 cents to $64.65 a ton.  Contracts for coal with a heating value of 5,500
kilocalories a kilogram for shipment to South  China  in the
second quarter dropped 40 cents to $86.70 a ton on a net-as-
received basis, the energy broker said. The February contract
fell 30 cents to $85.60 a ton.  China’s benchmark price for domestic coal may average 650
 yuan  ($105) a ton this year, according to a report from Sanford
C. Bernstein & Co. today. The fuel at Qinhuangdao port was
unchanged at a range of 620 to 630 yuan a ton as of Jan. 20,
according to data from the China Coal Transport and Distribution
Association yesterday.  A commodity swap is a financial agreement whereby a
floating price is exchanged for a fixed rate over a specified
contract period. About 60 percent of Indonesia’s coal is
classified as sub-bituminous. Higher moisture levels and a lower
carbon content reduce the heating value compared with better-
quality stock. Sub-bit coal has fewer than 6,100 kilocalories
per kilogram, according to the Indonesian energy ministry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
