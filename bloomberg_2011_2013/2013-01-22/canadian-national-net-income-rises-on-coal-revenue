Canadian National Railway Co. (CNR) 
forecast profit growth for 2013 that may fall short of analysts’
estimates as the country’s biggest railroad confronts increased
pension expenses.  Diluted earnings per share will have “high single-digit
growth” from adjusted profit of C$5.61 ($5.65) per share in
2012, the Montreal-based company said today in a statement.
Analysts projected C$6.17, the average of 29  estimates  compiled
by Bloomberg, implying a 10 percent increase in 2013.  Chief Executive Officer Claude Mongeau said Canadian
National faces the “challenge” of pension and increased
depreciation expenses totaling about C$150 million. The shares
fell 1 percent to C$93.77 in Toronto trading, their biggest
single-day drop since Nov. 14. They rose 13 percent last year.  “The guidance for 2013 is probably the most important
driver here,” David Tyerman, an analyst at Canaccord Genuity in
Toronto, said in a telephone interview. “It’s a little lower
than what people were expecting. Then again, these guys have a
track record of being conservative.”  Free  cash flow  in 2013 will probably be C$800 million to
C$900 million,  Canadian National  said. That’s short of the
C$1.62 billion estimate in a Bloomberg survey of 11 analysts.  Economic Growth  Canadian National’s forecasts for this year are predicated
on North American industrial production increasing by about 2
percent, Chief Financial Officer Luc Jobin said on a conference
call with analysts.  The economy across  North America  is “sluggish but it’s
constructive,” Mongeau said on the conference call. Canadian
National expects 2013 revenue to outpace gross domestic product
as the company transports more crude and lumber, and staffing
will probably increase by 1 percent, he said.  Fourth-quarter net income rose to C$610 million, or C$1.41
a share, from C$592 million, or C$1.32, a year earlier, the
company said. Excluding some items, Canadian National had been
expected to earn C$1.41 a share, the average  estimate  of 29
analysts, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Revenue rose
6.6 percent to C$2.53 billion, the Montreal-based company said
in a statement.  Canadian National raised its quarterly dividend to 43 cents
a share, a 15 percent increase. The  dividend  will be paid on
March 28 to shareholders of record as of March 7, the company
said in a separate statement.  Commodity Shipments  The company’s trains carried more oil during the quarter
amid rising demand from shippers. Petroleum and chemicals
revenue rose 13 percent to C$427 million, while coal revenue
climbed 15 percent to C$171 million even as volume fell 6
percent. Grain and fertilizer revenue advanced 11 percent.
Canadian National has said it may move twice as many carloads of
crude oil this year as it did last year.  Operating ratio, an industry benchmark of cost against
revenue, improved to 63.6 percent in the quarter from 64.7
percent in the same period a year earlier. The ratio for all of
2012 was 62.9 percent, an improvement of 0.6 percentage point.  Mongeau told analysts he doesn’t expect top executives to
depart for  Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd. (CP) , which is led by former
Canadian National CEO  Hunter Harrison .  “We have a winning team and I think we’re having fun
together, and I don’t see us losing people,” Mongeau said. “If
we do, we have huge bench strength and we will carry forward and
continue to win in the marketplace.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
