Japanese  stocks  fell as the yen
strengthened after the  Bank of Japan (8301)  doubled its inflation
target while waiting until next year to start open-ended asset
purchases like the ones already adopted by the  Federal Reserve .  Exporters Honda Motor Co. and Canon Inc. fell more than 1.6
percent.  Sumitomo Mitsui  Financial Group Inc. dropped 1.4
percent to lead declines among Japan’s biggest lenders. Kirin
Holdings Co. climbed 3.2 percent after a report the beverage
maker may sell its stake in Singapore-based Fraser & Neave Ltd.  The  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  retreated 0.4 percent to close
at 10,709.93 in Tokyo after jumping as much as 1 percent
immediately after the central bank’s the decision. Trading
volume was 25 percent above the 30-day average. The broader
 Topix Index (TPX)  lost 0.4 percent to 901.15. The yen gained 0.6
percent against the dollar.  “There are still a lot of skeptics,” said Stephen Corry,
a Hong Kong-based chief investment strategist at LGT Group, a
private bank and asset manager that oversees about $102 billion.
“The big question now is will the combined fiscal and monetary
stimulus work? The yen does look oversold and the Nikkei looks
overbought.”‘  The Topix has risen about 25 percent since elections were
announced on Nov. 14 on optimism the central bank would add to
stimulus amid pressure from Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s new
government. The gauge is trading at 1.07 times book value,
compared with 2.04 for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 1.15
for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  Exporters Fall  Carmakers, banks and electronic appliance makers exerted
the  biggest drags  among the Topix’s 33 industry groups.  Honda, which gets about 80 percent of its revenue outside
Japan, lost 2.3 percent to 3,340 yen and was the  biggest
contributor  to declines on the Nikkei 225. Canon fell 1.7
percent to 3,275. Sumitomo Mitsui, Japan’s second-largest bank
by market value, fell 1.4 percent to 3,255 yen.  The BOJ doubled its inflation target to 2 percent, a result
forecast by 21 of 23 economists surveyed  Bloomberg News . The
Bank also said it will shift next year to open-ended asset
purchases like those announced by the Fed in September. Japan’s
central bank said it will buy about 13 trillion yen ($145
billion) in Japanese  government bonds  and treasuries per month
starting next January.  “There is little ‘bold’ here,”  Julian Jessop , chief
global economist at  Capital Economics  in London said in a note
today. “It is debatable that the new ‘open-ended’ easing will
result in any more asset purchases than would have happened
anyway under the current policy.”  Yen Rebounds  The yen rebounded from near its weakest level in 2 1/2.
Japan’s currency has tumbled almost 17 percent in the past year,
the biggest decline among the 10 developed-nation currencies
tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. A stronger
yen cuts the value of earnings for Japanese exporters.  The 25-day historic volatility on the Nikkei 225 reached
21.88 today, its highest level since December 2011. The  Nikkei
Stock Average Volatility Index (VNKY)  fell 6.6 percent to 22.48,
indicating traders expect a swing of about 6.4 percent on the
benchmark gauge over the next 30 days.  Among stocks that rose, Kirin gained 3.2 percent to 1,081
yen after Kyodo news reported the beverage maker may sell its 15
percent stake in Fraser & Neave. Kirin said it hasn’t made a
decision on the sale. The Kyodo report was unattributed.  Fast Retailing Co. climbed 1.4 percent to 22,900 yen,
giving the Nikkei 225 its biggest boost, after the Hong Kong
Economic Journal reported its Uniqlo clothing unit may list
shares in the city.  To contact the reporters on this story:
