Petroleos de Venezuela SA , the state
oil company, said that its total debt rose at a slower pace last
year after it curtailed dollar-bond sales.  Indebtedness at PDVSA, as the company is known, climbed 15
percent to $40 billion after it sold $3 billion in dollar bonds
in May to the South American country’s central bank and raised
12.2 billion bolivars ($2.8 billion) throughout the year in
local debt, according to a report on the company’s website
today.  PDVSA’s debt soared 40 percent in 2011 when it issued $10
billion of dollar bonds. The oil company’s benchmark securities
due in 2017 returned 42 percent last year as yields plunged 6.26
percentage points to 8.74 percent on bets that President  Hugo
Chavez ’s worsening health would lead to a new government.  The Caracas-based company obtained a  credit line  from the
China Development Bank Corporation in February 2012 for $500
million to be used for oil services, of which $271 million had
been used at the end of the year, according to the report.  PDVSA also signed a credit line of $1 billion with Credit
Suisse AG for the expansion of the Puerto La Cruz refinery, of
which $478 million had been used by the end of 2012.  For Related News and Information:  To contact the reporters on this story:
