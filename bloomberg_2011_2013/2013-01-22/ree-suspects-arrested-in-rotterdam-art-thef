Three men have been arrested in
Romania on suspicion of involvement in the theft of paintings
from the Kunsthal Museum in Rotterdam, Dutch police said.  None of the seven paintings stolen on Oct. 16, in one of
the most spectacular art heists in recent years, have been
recovered, according to Roland Ekkers, a spokesman for the
Rotterdam-Rijnmond police.  The paintings included works by Pablo Picasso,  Claude
Monet ,  Henri Matisse ,  Paul Gauguin  and Lucian Freud.  The three men were arrested for 29 days late yesterday
under a warrant issued by a Bucharest court, according to the
Romanian private television channel Antena 3, which cited police
officials it didn’t identify. Dutch police could give no
information on the identity or nationality of the three men.  The paintings stolen were Picasso’s “Tete d’Arlequin;”
Monet’s “Waterloo Bridge, London” and “Charing Cross Bridge,
London;” Freud’s “Woman with Eyes Closed;” Matisse’s “La
Liseuse en Blanc et Jaune;” Gauguin’s “Femme Devant une
Fenetre Ouverte, dite la Fiancee,” and Meyer de Haan’s
“Autoportrait.”  Muse highlights include  Manuela Hoelterhoff  on arts,  Martin
Gayford  on London art exhibitions and  John Mariani  on wine.  To contact the reporter on this story:
