Drillisch AG (DRI) , a German provider of
telephone services, rose to the highest level in almost 12 years
after saying it plans to increase its dividend for 2012.  The stock  jumped  as much as 5.3 percent and was up 2.6
percent at 12.17 euros at 1:30 p.m. on the Frankfurt exchange.
The stock soared 57 percent last year and now has a market value
of 640 million euros ($854 million).  Drillisch, based in Maintal, plans to increase its 2012
dividend to 1 euro a share from 70 euro cents a year earlier,
based on the “positive business trend in 2012” and the “sound
liquidity” of the company, it said in a statement today. It
bought back 3.66 million shares worth 38.5 million euros as part
of its already-announced buyback plan, the company said.  Drillisch is scheduled to report full-year earnings on
March 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
