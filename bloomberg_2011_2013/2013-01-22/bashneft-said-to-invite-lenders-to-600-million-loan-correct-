(Corrects name of rating company in fifth paragraph in
story published Jan. 10.)  OAO Bashneft (BANE) , the Russian oil
producer controlled by billionaire Vladimir Evtushenkov’s AFK
Sistema, is said to be seeking a three-year loan for as much as
$600 million.  Lenders have been invited to commit $50 million each to the
facility, according to a person with knowledge of the deal who
asked not to be identified as the terms are private. The pre-
export financing, a type of loan usually backed by cash flows
linked to the borrower’s export contracts, is being coordinated
by BNP Paribas SA and will pay an all-in margin of 315 basis
points, the person said. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  Sergey Verezemskiy, a Moscow-based spokesman for Bashneft,
declined to comment on the financing.  The company raised a three-year $300 million loan in August
2011 paying a margin of 155 basis points, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. BNP Paribas, Deutsche Bank AG, Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. and ING Groep provided the debt.  Bashneft, which is rated Ba2 by Moody’s Investors Service
and an equivalent BB ranking from  Fitch Ratings , reported a 34
percent increase in third-quarter earnings before interest,
taxes, depreciation and amortization to $962 million compared
with the same period a year earlier, it said Nov. 19.  To contact the reporter on this story:
