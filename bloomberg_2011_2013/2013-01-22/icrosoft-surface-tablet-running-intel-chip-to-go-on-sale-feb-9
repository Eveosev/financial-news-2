Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) , the world’s largest
software maker, said its Surface tablet computer running the new
Windows 8 Pro software will be available Feb. 9, the first
versions of the machine powered by Intel Corp. chips.  Surface Windows 8 Pro, which runs on an Intel Core i5
processor, will go on sale in the U.S. and Canada starting at
$899, the company said today in a statement. It will be
available with 64 or 128 gigabytes of memory.  An earlier iteration of Surface that contains a chip with
 ARM Holdings Plc (ARM)  technology went on sale in October for $499 to
$699. Microsoft hasn’t disclosed how many units it has sold of
that version, called Surface Windows RT. That machine will go on
sale in 14 additional markets worldwide in the coming weeks,
Microsoft said today.  Shares of Microsoft fell less than 1 percent to $27.15 at
