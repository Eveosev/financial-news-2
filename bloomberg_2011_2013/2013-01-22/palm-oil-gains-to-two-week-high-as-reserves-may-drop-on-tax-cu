Palm oil advanced to the highest
level in two weeks on speculation that a cut in export taxes
will reduce record stockpiles in  Malaysia , the second-biggest
producer after Indonesia.  The contract for delivery in April climbed as much as 1.7
percent to 2,461 ringgit ($810) a metric ton on the Malaysia
Derivatives Exchange, the highest level for the most-active
contract since Jan. 7. Futures were trading at 2,448 ringgit at
12:01 p.m. in Kuala Lumpur.  Inventories will drop 16 percent to 2.2 million tons by
March, the most since 2010, after tariffs were reduced to zero
this month, according to the median of six analyst and trader
estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Futures will rally to 2,800
ringgit by the end of this quarter, the median of 13 estimates
shows. The country will maintain the zero tariff on crude  palm
oil  shipments through February to draw down the stockpiles,
which stood at an all-time high of 2.63 million tons in December.  “Since February’s export tax still remains zero, it’s
likely to attract more CPO exports,” said Donny Khor, associate
director for futures and options at OSK Investment Bank Bhd. in
Kuala Lumpur, referring to crude palm oil by its initials.
“This should reduce” reserves, he said.  Production in January may be about 16 percent to 17 percent
lower than the 1.78 million tons a month earlier and February
output is expected to dip further, said Khor. Output is usually
lowest in the first two months of the year.  Refined palm oil for delivery in May rose 0.7 percent to
6,796  yuan  ($1,093) a ton on the  Dalian Commodity Exchange .
 Soybean oil  for September was unchanged at 8,846 yuan a ton.  Soybeans for March delivery gained 0.8 percent to $14.41 a
bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade. Soybean oil for delivery
in March climbed 0.9 percent to 52.13 cents a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
