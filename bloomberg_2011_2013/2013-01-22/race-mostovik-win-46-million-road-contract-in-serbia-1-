Trace Group Hold AD (T57) , Bulgaria’s
biggest road construction company, won a 3.83 billion dinar ($46
million) contract to build a road section in southeastern Serbia
in a joint venture with Russian builder NPO Mostovik OOO.  The 5-kilometer (3.1-mile) link involves construction of
eight bridges, two overpasses, a cross section and tunnels in
two years, the Sofia-based company said on its website today.
The project is part of a highway linking the Serbian city of Nis
with Macedonia and will be funded by the  European Investment
Bank , the  World Bank  and the Serbian government.  Koridori Srbije d.o.o., Serbia’s state-run road company,
has invited the Bulgarian-Russian joint venture to sign the
contract, according to the statement.  Trace seeks to expand abroad and is taking part in
construction tenders in the Balkans, Russia, the  Middle East  and
North Africa, it said. Trace International EOOD, a unit of the
company, is now building roads in Germany, the Balkans, Saudi
Arabia and Azerbaijan, it said.  The company had a 2 million lev ($1.36 million) loss in the
third quarter on declining domestic orders. Trace Hold shares
rose 1.4 percent to 3.6 lev at 12:56 p.m. in Sofia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
