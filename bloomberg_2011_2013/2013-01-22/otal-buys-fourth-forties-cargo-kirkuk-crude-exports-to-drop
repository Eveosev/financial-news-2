Total SA bought two cargoes of  North
Sea  Forties crude, its fourth in one week, as prices rose to the
most in a week. Glencore International Plc failed to buy Russian
Urals grade in the Mediterranean.  Iraq plans to reduce exports of its Kirkuk crude in
February from the Turkish port of Ceyhan to 15 cargoes, three
less than this month, according to a loading program obtained by
Bloomberg News.  North Sea  Total bought Forties lot F0217 for loading Feb. 8 to Feb.
10 at a 40 cent premium to Dated Brent from Chevron Corp. and
F0208 for loading Feb. 11 to Feb. 13 at 35 cents more than the
benchmark from Royal Dutch Shell Plc, a Bloomberg survey of
traders and brokers monitoring the Platts pricing window showed.
The deals compare with a Jan. 17 trade at plus 20 cents and are
the highest since Jan. 15.  The Paris-based company also bid for Forties cargoes
loading Feb. 5 to Feb. 7 at a 60 cents more than Dated Brent and
a Feb. 7 to Feb. 11 consignment at plus 45 cents without finding
a seller, according to the survey. Total last week chartered the
very large crude carrier Mesdar to load on Feb. 5 to Feb. 10
from Hound Point in the U.K. to  South Korea .  Reported crude trading typically occurs during the Platts
window, which ends at 4:30 p.m. London time. Forties loading in
10 to 25 days rose 5 cents to 52 cents a barrel more than Dated
Brent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Brent for March settlement traded at $112.04 a barrel on
the ICE Futures  Europe  exchange in London at the close of the
window, compared with $111.64 in the previous session. The April
contract was at $111.07, a discount of 97 cents to March.  Mediterranean/Urals  Glencore bid unsuccessfully for 80,000 metric tons of Urals
for Feb. 1 to Feb. 5 at a 5 cent premium to Dated Brent on a
delivered basis to Augusta,  Italy , according to the Platts
survey. That’s the first bid since Jan. 2 and compares with a
Dec. 13 deal at a 25 cent discount.  The Urals differential to Dated Brent in the Mediterranean
narrowed 3 cents to minus 27 cents a barrel, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the least since Dec. 17. In
northwest Europe, the  discount  shrank to 81 cents from $1.17
yesterday, the data showed. That’s the smallest spread since
Dec. 21.  Four  oil tankers  are waiting at Novorossiysk,  Russia ’s
largest commercial port, to pick up crude cargoes after storms
since Jan. 15 delayed shipments, according to OAO Transneft.  One 80,000-ton tanker loaded yesterday during an easing of
the storm, Igor Dyomin, a Transneft spokesman, said by phone
from Moscow. The storms are forecast to continue until Jan. 24,
he said.  OAO Surgutneftegas issued a tender to sell one 100,000-ton
cargo of Urals for loading from Feb. 8 to Feb. 9 from the Baltic
port of Ust-Luga, two people with knowledge of the matter said.  PKN Orlen SA, Poland’s largest oil company, is seeking to
buy 100,000 tons of Urals for loading from either Primorsk or
Ust-Luga on Feb. 4 to Feb. 8, according to two people with
knowledge of the matter.  West Africa  Benchmark Nigerian Qua Iboe blend fell 1 cent to $2.13 a
barrel more than Dated Brent, Bloomberg data show. That’s the
least since Dec. 4.  Nigeria  will reduce crude exports in March to the least in
four months, according to preliminary loading programs obtained
by  Bloomberg News .  Daily exports are scheduled to be 2.05 million barrels
compared with 2.16 million in February, according to the plans.
The African nation will ship 69 cargoes in March, totaling 63.57
million barrels, the schedule showed. That compares with 65
lots, or 59.49 million barrels, due to be shipped next month.  Ghana and  Chad  plan to keep exports of their Jubilee and
Doba grades unchanged at three cargoes each in March, according
to loading program plans obtained by Bloomberg News.  Ghana will ship three 950,000 barrel lots of its Jubilee
grade, or 91,935 barrels a day, the plan showed. Exports of Doba
blend will also total three 950,000 barrel consignments, a
separate schedule showed.  PT Pertamina,  Indonesia ’s state-owned oil company, issued a
tender to buy low-sulfur crudes for delivery in April, a
document obtained by Bloomberg News showed.  The tender closes at 3 p.m. Singapore time on Jan. 24 with
offers valid until 6 p.m. the following day. Cargoes are for
