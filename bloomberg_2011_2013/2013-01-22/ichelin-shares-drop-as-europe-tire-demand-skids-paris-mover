Michelin & Cie (ML)  and  Continental AG (CON) 
fell the most in more than three months after the French company
said demand for tires slumped across Europe last month.  Michelin  shares  declined as much as 4.10 percent, the
biggest intraday drop since Oct. 16, and were down 2.3 percent
at 1:20 p.m. in Paris. Continental fell as much as 3.8 percent,
the most since Oct. 16, and was down 1.2 percent in  Frankfurt .  Sales of tires used in new vehicles fell 16 percent in
Europe and 2 percent in North America last month, the Clermont-
Ferrand, France-based manufacturer said yesterday on its
 website . Sales of replacement tires dropped 7 percent in Europe
and 8 percent in  North America , Michelin said.  Auto suppliers are feeling the pinch from the economic
downturn in Europe. Car sales in December fell 16 percent in the
region, the steepest monthly decline in more than two years,
according to the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association.  “Production is at a standstill at car and truck
producers,” said Hans-Peter Wodniok, an analyst at Fairesearch
GmbH & Co.  Volkswagen AG’s Audi brand halted production before
Christmas and resumed it only around Jan. 10, according to
Wodniok, suggesting January will also be “very very slow.”  The slowdown has hit other auto suppliers such as Faurecia,
Europe’s biggest maker of car interiors. The company released
preliminary annual earnings about a month ahead of the scheduled
date as its financial debt swelled to 1.81 billion euros ($2.42
billion) at the end of 2012, from 1.53 billion euros six months
earlier.  To reduce spending, companies are slashing jobs. Faurecia,
which is 57 percent-owned by PSA Peugeot Citroen, plans to cut
about 3,000 jobs in Europe, or 7.5 percent of the workforce, by
the end of this year.  Peugeot is eliminating 11,200 jobs in  France , or 17 percent
of its workforce there, and closing a factory on the outskirts
of Paris. General Motors Co. is shuttering a plant in  Germany ,
putting 3,100 positions at risk, while Ford’s European division
is halting operations at three factories and cutting 5,700
posts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
