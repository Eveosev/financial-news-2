U.K. government bonds advanced after
demand increased as the Debt Management Office sold 1.75 billion
pounds ($2.78 billion) of 10-year securities.  Two-year  yields  fell from the highest level in a week after
a report showed the  budget deficit  widened in December, spurring
demand for safer assets. Investors bid for 2.9 times the amount
of the 10-year securities allotted at the auction, up from a so-
called bid-to-cover of 1.69 at the previous sale of similar-
maturity bonds last month. The pound strengthened.  “We’ve had a pretty strong 10-year auction and the market
was a little short,” said Simon Peck, a fixed-income strategist
at Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc in London. “For the next
few weeks I think we’ll stay in a range in the 10 year. The 2
percent level has been tough to break.” A short position is a
bet an asset will decline in value.  The benchmark 10-year gilt yield fell four basis points, or
0.04 percentage point, to 2.02 percent at the 5 p.m. close in
 London . The 1.75 percent security maturing September 2022 rose
0.315, or 3.15 pounds per 1,000-pound face amount, to 97.66. The
two-year rate dropped one basis point to 0.40 percent after
rising to 0.42 percent, the most since Jan. 11.  The Debt Management Office sold 4 percent securities due in
March 2022 at an average yield of 1.897 percent. It last
auctioned 10-year bonds on Dec. 11 at 1.803 percent.  U.K. government bonds handed investors a loss of 1.7
percent this month through yesterday, according to indexes
compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of Financial
Analysts Societies. German bunds dropped 1.3 percent and
Treasuries fell 0.3 percent.  Pound Gains  The pound advanced against the dollar, snapping a seven-day
decline, and rose from an almost 11-month low versus the euro.  The U.K. currency strengthened 0.2 percent to 83.93 pence
per euro after depreciating to 84.41 pence, the weakest level
since Feb. 29. Sterling gained 0.2 percent to $1.5856 after
falling to $1.5806 yesterday, the lowest since Aug. 31.  The pound is poised to strengthen versus the dollar after
its recent decline, according to BNP Paribas SA. Strategists
including London-based James Hellawell recommended buying the
U.K. currency at $1.5860 in an e-mailed report today. The pound
may appreciate toward $1.6185, they wrote.  The pound dropped 2.5 percent this year, the worst
performance among the 10 major currencies tracked by Bloomberg
Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The euro advanced 1.2 percent and
the dollar gained 0.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
