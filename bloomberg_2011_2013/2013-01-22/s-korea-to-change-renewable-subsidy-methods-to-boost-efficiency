South Korea ’s government, which has
spent $2.6 billion to foster a domestic market for clean energy,
plans to change the way it subsidizes renewables to encourage
private energy providers to take more initiatives on their own.  Under the plan, a certain amount of subsidies will be paid
depending on the renewable source and its energy yield rather
than a set ratio of subsidies in excess of base tariffs, the
 Ministry  of  Knowledge Economy  said in an e-mail today.  “So far, the government has led” the creation of the
renewable energy market, Vice Minister Cho Seok said in the
statement. The revision “will motivate the private market to
make commitments for self-survival and competitiveness.”  The government has spent 2.77 trillion won ($2.6 billion)
in subsidies and loans from 1993 to 2012 to bolster renewable
energy use in homes, buildings and other facilities. The push
gave  Korea  renewable energy capacity equivalent to 320,000
tonnes of oil equivalent, the ministry said today.  In 2012, the government introduced a compulsory quota
requiring that the country’s power generators get 2 percent of
their energy from renewable sources. The renewable portfolio
standard, or RPS, will be raised to 10 percent by 2022.  To contact the reporter on this story:
