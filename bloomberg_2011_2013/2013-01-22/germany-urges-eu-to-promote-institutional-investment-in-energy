The European Union must make it
easier for institutional investors such as insurers to finance
energy infrastructure in the bloc, German Economy Minister
Philipp Roesler said.  There’s potential to create a “special risk classification
for investments in energy infrastructure,” Roesler said today
at a conference in Berlin. He’s discussed the idea with  Michel Barnier , the EU’s financial services chief, he said.  The changes could form part of the EU’s Solvency II rules,
which are designed to make firms in the region allocate the same
capital reserves against the risks they take. The implementation
of the regulations has been delayed from last year as German,
British and French insurers lobby over their impact on long-term
savings products.  Roesler’s proposed changes may help finance power-line
projects and grid connections for offshore wind farms, he said.
Institutional investors are interested in financing energy
infrastructure that offers “robust” long-term returns at a
time of low  interest rates , he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
