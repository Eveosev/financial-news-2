Malaysian ringgit forwards dropped
to their lowest level in almost two weeks as speculation about
the timing of the general election drove investors to pare
holdings in the country’s stocks.  The benchmark FTSE Bursa Malaysia KLCI  Index (FBMKLCI)  of shares sank
2.4 percent yesterday, the biggest loss since September 2011.
The gauge fell 0.7 percent today. Prime Minister Najib Razak,
who must dissolve parliament by April 28, saw his approval
rating drop to a 16-month low in December, the Merdeka Center
for Opinion Research said in a Jan. 10 statement.  “The elections are becoming a rather sensitive issue,”
said Choong Yin Pheng, senior manager for fixed income and
economic research at Hong Leong Bank Bhd. in Kuala Lumpur.
“That could be part of the reason that’s contributing to the
currency’s weakness.”  Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards fell 0.1 percent to
3.0937 per dollar as of 4:24 p.m. in Kuala Lumpur, after
retreating 0.8 percent yesterday, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. They touched 3.1057 earlier, the weakest level since
Jan. 9. The contracts to buy or sell the ringgit in a year
traded at a 1.9 percent discount to the spot rate. Non-
deliverable forwards are settled in dollars.  The ringgit declined 0.1 percent to 3.0388 per dollar, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. One-month implied volatility, a
measure of expected moves in the exchange rate used to price
options, rose 15 basis points, or 0.15 percentage point, to 5.37
percent.  A government report tomorrow may show Malaysian consumer
prices rose 1.4 percent in December from a year earlier,
compared with 1.3 percent in November, according to the median
estimate of 15 economists in a Bloomberg survey.  Government bonds advanced. The yield on the 3.172 percent
notes maturing in July 2016 fell one basis point to 3.16
percent, according to Bursa Malaysia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
