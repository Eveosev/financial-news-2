Ashaka Cement Plc (ASHAKACE) , a Nigerian unit
of  Lafarge SA (LG) , fell the most in almost nine years as a technical
signal indicated the shares had been overbought.  The stock fell 9.9 percent to 20 naira by the close in
Lagos, Nigeria’s commercial capital, its biggest daily decline
since May 13, 2004. More than 1.7 million securities changed
hands, 1.8 times the three-month daily average, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ashaka had rallied 24 percent this year before today’s
retreat, pushing its 14-day  relative strength index  to 79.3
yesterday. A reading above 70 suggests a security is overvalued
and will probably fall. The stock gain compares with 11 percent
for Lafarge Cement Wapco Plc in the same period, and a 9.3
percent advance for  Dangote Cement Plc (DANGCEM) , Nigeria’s biggest
company by market value.  “The stock is falling on technicalities as short-term
retail investors believe it has been over bought,” Pabina
Yinkere, head of research at Lagos-based Vetiva Capital
Management Ltd., said by phone today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
