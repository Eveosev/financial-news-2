Iron ore may tumble 21 percent by
the year-end as global supply increases, undermining a rally
that pushed the price of the steel-making raw material to the
highest level in 15 months, according to Bank of America Corp.  The commodity may fall to $110 a ton by the end of the year
from $140 a ton in the first quarter, the bank said in a report
dated yesterday. Ore with 62 percent iron content delivered to
the Chinese port of Tianjin rose 0.6 percent to $145.90 a dry
ton yesterday, according to  data  from The Steel Index Ltd.  Bank of America’s outlook tallies with forecasts this month
from Deutsche Bank AG and JPMorgan Chase & Co. that prices are
poised to retreat in the second half as supply gains. Iron ore
has surged 68 percent since slumping to a three-year low in
September as growth in China, the biggest buyer, accelerated for
the first time in two years and mills restocked inventories.  “The recent price rally is unsustainable and should come
off in the second half of the year as more supply begins to come
on line,” Bank of America said. Prices will “remain supported
over the winter due to seasonal factors,” it said.  China ’s coldest winter in 28 years curbed its domestic
production of iron ore, according to a Jan. 10 report from
Credit Suisse Group AG. Imports rose to a record 70.94 million
tons last month, customs data show. The world’s second-largest
economy buys about 65 percent of seaborne trade.  New Supply  Deutsche Bank said on Jan. 8 that prices will drop below
$120 in the second half from about $170 in the first six months,
predicting that the theme of 2013 may be “a tale of two
halves.” Prices will drop from an average $145 a ton in the
first quarter to $120 a ton in the fourth quarter as new supply
comes on stream, JPMorgan Chase said on Jan. 16.  Global seaborne supply may gain 7 percent in 2013 from a
year earlier, according to Deutsche Bank, which said Australian
shipments may climb 14 percent and Brazilian exports may
increase 12 percent.  Rio Tinto Group (RIO) , the second-largest mining
company, said on Jan. 15 its expansion in the Pilbara to 290
million tons by the year-end is on track, with output set to
rise to 360 million tons by the first half of 2015.  “There are new mines coming on, especially toward the end
of the year, so we might see some weakness there,” Hsi Han Pin,
global head of commodities research at Standard Chartered Plc,
said in an interview in  Seoul  today after a briefing. “But are
we seeing iron ore prices trending downwards, say, below $100?
No, we are not.”  Largest Steelmaker  Baoshan Iron & Steel Co. (600019) , China’s largest steelmaker, said
today it raised prices for hot-rolled products and most cold-
rolled products by 200  yuan  ($32) a ton for March delivery.
China’s economic growth accelerated in the final quarter of 2012,
data showed on Jan. 18, as government efforts to revive demand
drove a rebound in industrial output and retail sales. Gross
domestic product expanded 7.9 percent in the three months.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is more bullish on iron ore,
predicting another year of “exceptional prices,” according to
a Jan. 16 report that increased its full-year forecast to $144 a
ton from $140. While the global market is set for oversupply,
that’s two years away, Goldman said.  Ore in Tianjin rallied to $158.50 on Jan. 8, the most
expensive since October 2011. Last year, the price advanced 4.6
percent after slumping 19 percent the previous year.  Inventories held at Chinese ports fell 4.4 percent to 69.71
million tons on Jan. 18, the lowest level since September 2010,
according to data from Beijing Antaike Information Development
Co. The holdings dropped 24 percent in the final quarter of 2012,
the biggest decline since at least the third quarter of 2006.  Iron ore is measured in dry tons, or metric tons less
moisture. At Tianjin port moisture can account for 8 percent to
10 percent of the ore’s weight. Australia and  Brazil  are the two
biggest exporters and accounted for about 73 percent of world
seaborne supply in 2012, according to Credit Suisse.  To contact the reporter for this story:
