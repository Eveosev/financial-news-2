STR Holdings Inc. (STRI) , a supplier of
materials for solar panels, will lose its biggest customer this
quarter,  First Solar Inc. (FSLR) , and hired  UBS AG (UBSN)  to review its
strategic options.  First Solar, the largest maker of thin-film photovoltaic
panels, “will begin a transition away from STR in the first
quarter of 2013,” the Enfield, Connecticut-based company said
today in a statement.  First Solar accounted for about $39 million in sales for
STR last year, according to the statement. Analysts expect STR
to report total sales of $94.7 million for 2012. STR had $81.9
million in cash at the end of the year.  STR said its decision to hire UBS in December wasn’t
related to losing First Solar.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
