Hungarian Prime Minister  Viktor
Orban ’s ruling party kept its lead over the Socialists, the
biggest opposition party, MTI reported, citing an Ipsos poll.  Fidesz had 19 percent support among eligible voters,
compared with 16 percent for the Socialists, unchanged from the
previous month, the state news service said today, citing an
Ipsos poll “in the middle of January.” The radical nationalist
Jobbik party was third with 6 percent, MTI reported.  Fifty-two percent said they don’t support any party, the
news service said, without citing a margin of error. Fidesz led
the Socialists 41 percent to 32 percent among decided voters,
with Jobbik third at 12 percent, MTI said. Former premier  Gordon
Bajnai ’s Egyutt 2014 movement had 8 percent backing among
decided voters, MTI said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
