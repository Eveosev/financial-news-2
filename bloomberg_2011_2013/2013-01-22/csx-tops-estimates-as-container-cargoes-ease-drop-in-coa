CSX Corp. (CSX) , the largest East Coast
rail carrier, posted higher fourth-quarter profit than analysts
estimated as container-car and merchandise shipments rose.  Net income  in the period was $443 million, or 43 cents a
share, compared with $457 million, or 43 cents, a year earlier,
the Jacksonville, Florida-based company said in a statement
today. That beat the  average  of 39 cents forecast by 27 analysts
in a Bloomberg survey.  Growth in container shipments of  consumer goods , spurred by
a shift among shippers to rail delivery from trucks, is helping
compensate for declines in coal and agricultural volumes.
Intermodal cargo, which can be shipped by rail, sea or highway,
climbed 2.8 percent at CSX, outpacing an advance of 2.7 percent
for the largest North American rail carriers, according to
Association of American Railroads data.  “Coal is a fairly significant headwind,” Logan Purk, a
St. Louis-based analyst at Edward Jones & Co. who recommends
buying CSX shares, said in a telephone interview. Intermodal
traffic “is still doing well” and CSX will see “healthy
growth in that market, especially as they continue to take share
from trucks.”  CSX climbed 1.6 percent to $21.15 at 6:41 p.m., after the
close of regular trading in  New York . The shares had previously
fallen 8.8 percent in the past 12 months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
