Swiss stocks  declined for a third
day as the  Bank of Japan (8301)  refrained from adding any immediate
stimulus and as investors awaited a U.S. report on the sales of
previously owned houses.  Kuehne & Nagel International AG slid 2.1 percent after
Credit Suisse Group AG recommended selling the company’s shares.  The  Swiss Market Index (SMI)  lost 0.5 percent to 7,297.56 at 9:45
a.m. in Zurich. The gauge has still rallied  7 percent  in 2013,
the best start to a year since the measure was formed in 1988.
The broader Swiss Performance Index dropped 0.4 percent today.  The  volume of shares  changing hands in SMI-listed companies
was 19 percent lower than the average of the last 30 days, data
compiled by Bloomberg showed.  The Bank of  Japan  delayed its new open-ended asset
purchases program until the next year, disappointing some
investors. The central bank plans monthly buying of 13 trillion
yen ($145 billion) of securities from January 2014.  Bank of Japan Governor Masaaki Shirakawa and six of his
nine fellow board members voted for a 2 percent inflation
target, to be achieved “at the earliest possible time.” This
pace of price increases has not been sustained in Japan since
the early 1990s.  Purchases of  previously owned houses  in the U.S. climbed to
a 5.1 million annual rate in December, the strongest since
November 2009, economists said before a report from the National
Association of Realtors figures at 10 a.m. Washington time.  In the euro area, finance ministers seek an agreement in
the first half of this year on how and when the 500 billion-euro
European Stability Mechanism can bypass governments and provide
direct help to banks.  Kuehne & Nagel (KNIN)  fell 2.1 percent to 110.10 francs after
Credit Suisse downgraded the stock to underperform from
outperform, meaning investors should sell the shares.  To contact the reporter on this story:
