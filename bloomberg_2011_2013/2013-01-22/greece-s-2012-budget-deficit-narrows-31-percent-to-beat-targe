Greece ’s budget deficit narrowed 31
percent in 2012, slightly more than an initial estimate earlier
this month, as the government cut spending and revenue dropped
less than anticipated.  The budget gap, excluding spending by state-controlled
enterprises, narrowed to 15.7 billion euros ($21 billion) from
22.8 billion euros in 2011, according to final figures released
today by the Athens-based  Finance Ministry . The figure is
smaller than a preliminary estimate of 15.9 billion euros made
on Jan. 10, and beat the government’s 16.3 billion-euro target.  In November, Greece’s coalition government approved new
austerity measures to obtain aid under two bailouts from the
European Union and the  International Monetary Fund . The IMF
estimates the economy contracted 6 percent last year, the fifth
year of recession.  The primary deficit, which excludes debt-service costs, was
3.5 billion euros compared with a goal of 4.6 billion euros. Net
revenue fell 3.7 percent to 51.9 billion euros. That compared
with a target of 52.4 billion euros and was 200 million euros
more than the January estimate.  Spending dropped to 67.6 billion euros from 76.7 billion
euros, beating a target of 68.7 billion euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
