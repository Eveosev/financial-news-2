CEZ AS (CEZ) , the largest Czech energy
producer, risks losing as much as 200 million euros ($266
million) in Albania after a regulator revoked its license.  CEZ bought Albania’s power distributor in 2009 for 102
million euros and has invested 90 million to 100 million euros
in repairs and expansion, Barbora Pulpanova, a spokeswoman for
the Prague-based company, said by phone. The utility will seek
to exercise a 60 million-euro guarantee from the World Bank that
was negotiated before it entered the Balkan country, she said.  The Albanian energy regulator revoked CEZ’s license in the
country yesterday following almost a year of disputes over
tariffs and taxes, as well as unpaid electricity bills from
local utilities. CEZ has argued that the regulator ordered it to
pay state-owned power producers higher tariffs without allowing
the Czech utility to raise prices for customers.  “We’re now taking steps toward starting international
arbitration,” Pulpanova said. “At this point it’s unclear how
much, if anything, we can get back.”  Albania’s treatment of CEZ is “very disappointing” and
sends “a very negative signal” that’s damaging Czech-Albanian
relations, Czech Prime Minister Petr Necas said in a statement
today. The spat throws doubt on Albania’s ability to guarantee
fair market conditions and casts a shadow on the country’s image
in the European Union, Necas said in the statement.  The company said it plans to sell its 76 percent stake in
CEZ Shperndarje, the Albanian distributor. CEZ is scheduled to
release full-year earnings on Feb. 28.  To contact the reporter on this story:
