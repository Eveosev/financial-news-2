Trinidad and Tobago  agreed to a
$246.5 million loan from the  Inter-American Development Bank ,
the first part of a three-phase wastewater program designed to
stem the discharge of raw sewage in Trinidad’s waters.  The signing of the loan last week with IDB President Luis
Alberto Moreno and Trinidad government officials allows two
wastewater treatment plants to be constructed in San Fernando
and Malabar. It’s the largest loan that the bank has in any
country in the English-speaking Caribbean, according to the IDB.  The Washington-based lender said in a website statement
that the accord is the first stage of a five-year, $546.5
million water works program to improve environmental conditions
on the island by curbing the release of untreated wastewater
into the Caribbean, integrating a sewer network and expanding
sewage collection. The loan is for 25 years with a 5-1/2 year
grace period and a variable  interest rate  based on Libor, it
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
