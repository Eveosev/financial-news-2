The U.K. is set to relax planning
laws to allow  developers  to convert unused  office space  into
homes in a bid to increase the supply of affordable housing and
stimulate the flagging economy.  “This government is committed to getting brownfield land
and empty buildings back into productive use,” the Department
for Communities and Local Government said today in an e-mailed
statement. “We are currently looking to make it easier to
convert empty and under-used commercial space into residential
use.”  The City of  London , the U.K. capital’s main financial
district, will be granted an exemption when the new rules are
announced by Planning Minister Nick Boles later this week,
according to a person with knowledge of the matter who asked not
to be identified because the plans aren’t public. Authorities
from the borough told ministers empty offices will be occupied
by businesses again when the British economy recovers, the
person said.  The measures are part of Prime Minister  David Cameron ’s
relaxation of planning laws to encourage building. The premier
has eased the obligations on developers to build affordable
housing and allowed bigger extensions on private homes without
local authority permission.  The government has also given 16,500 first-time buyers help
getting on the housing ladder under an extension of the FirstBuy
Scheme, under which would-be homeowners without a deposit are
given an equity loan of up to 20 percent of the purchase price.  To contact the reporter on this story:
