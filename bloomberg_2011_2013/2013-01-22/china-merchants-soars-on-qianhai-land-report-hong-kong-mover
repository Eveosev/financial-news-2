China Merchants Holdings
International Co. (144) , a port operator whose parent owns land in
Shenzhen’s Qianhai district, jumped the most in three years
after a report on talks between officials and property owners
there.  China Merchants Holdings gained 8.8 percent, the most since
June 1, 2009, to close at HK$28.40 in Hong Kong trading today.
It was the biggest percentage gainer in the city’s benchmark
 Hang Seng Index (HSI) , which rose 0.29 percent to 23,659.  Shenzhen officials may soon review land policies for
Qianhai, the Hong Kong Economic Times reported today, without
saying how it got the information. China seeks to develop the
Qianhai special zone, a 15-square-kilometer (5.8-square-mile)
area on Shenzhen’s west side, into a financial services hub.  About 27.5 percent of the land in Qianhai is owned by
shipping box maker  China International Marine Containers Group (2039) 
Co. and logistics service provider  Shenzhen International (152) 
Holdings Ltd. and China Merchants Group Ltd., parent of China
Merchants Holdings, the newspaper said, citing its own
calculation.  China International Marine gained 18 percent to HK$16.46 in
Hong Kong trading. Shenzhen International soared 21 percent, the
most since April 2000, to close at HK$1.09.  Calls to China Merchants’ press office went unanswered
today.  Qianhai will be a test ground for freer  yuan  use and
capital-account convertibility, China’s National Development and
Reform said last year. Companies in Qianhai will be encouraged
to sell yuan-denominated bonds in Hong Kong and to experiment
with cross-border loans in the Chinese currency, the National
Development and Reform Commission said in June.  Shenzhen, which adjoins Hong Kong, was  China ’s first
special economic zone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
