Shenzhen Investment Ltd. (604) , a company
backed by the namesake Chinese city, will buy land there from
shareholder Shum Yip Group Ltd. for 4.15 billion  yuan  ($667
million) in stock, as it plans mixed-use projects.  Shenzhen Investment will issue 1.41 billion new shares to
fund the purchase, boosting Shum Yip’s stake in Shenzhen
Investment to 59.7 percent from 44.4 percent, according to a
Hong Kong stock exchange filing yesterday. After increasing its
stake, Shum Yip will seek a waiver from making a buyout offer
for the company, Shenzhen Investment said.  Shenzhen Investment is buying land at the junction of
Caitian Road and Sungang Road Shenzhen’s Futian district. The
company plans a 170,720-square-meter (1.84 million square feet)
residential project on the northern portion of the site and a
618,190-square-meter office, hotel and commercial services
complex on the southern part.  The  shares  of Shenzhen Investment will resume trading in
Hong Kong today after a three-day suspension pending the
announcement, according to the filing.  The stock fell 2 percent
to HK$3.36 on Jan. 17.  To contact the reporter on this story:
