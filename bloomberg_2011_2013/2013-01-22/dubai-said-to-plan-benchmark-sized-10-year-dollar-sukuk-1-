Dubai raised $1.25 billion in 10-
year sukuk and its first 30-year bonds as the Persian Gulf
emirate took advantage of tumbling borrowing costs, according to
six people familiar with the matter.  The government sold $750 million in Islamic bonds at 3.875
percent and $500 million in 30-year notes at 5.375 percent,
according to the people, who asked not to be named because the
details are private. Dubai last tapped global bond markets in
April when it borrowed a similar amount, including $650 million
of 10-year sukuk at a 6.45 percent coupon.  Dubai’s borrowing costs have tumbled as the emirate’s
economy recovers from the brink of default in 2009. The
government plans to more than double economic growth to an
average of 4.6 percent through 2015, according to the bond
prospectus, compared with 1.75 percent between 2008 and 2011.  “This new deal is proof that Dubai has regained market
confidence which has allowed them to bring down their borrowing
costs significantly,” said Hakim Azaiez, the head of investment
at GCA Asset Management in  London . “Dubai pulled themselves out
of the crisis with phenomenal momentum.”  ‘Growing Exponentially’  The sukuk issuance is the first sovereign sale in the six-
nation Gulf Cooperation Council this year, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Sales of bonds that comply with Islam’s
ban on interest surged to a record $21 billion in the region
last year as borrowing costs plunged. The yield on Dubai’s 6.396
percent sukuk due in 2014 dropped 344 basis points, or 3.44
percentage points, in 2012 to 2.13 percent, the data show.  “Appetite for Islamic paper is growing exponentially, and
sentiment toward Dubai is incredibly positive,” Ghassan Chehayeb, research director for the Middle East and North Africa
at Exotix Ltd., said today. “The emirate has significant
refinancing needs in 2015/2016, so it is critical that they
continue to manage this challenging maturity schedule in
advance.”  Dubai, the second-biggest sheikhdom in the  United Arab
Emirates , raked up $113 billion in debt to turn itself into a
regional hub for commerce, transport and financial services,
before teetering on the brink of default in 2009. Dubai state-
linked maturities, not including restructured loans, amount to
about $7 billion this year, almost $32 billion in 2014 and $9.6
billion in 2015, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch
estimates.  ‘Improved Significantly’  The emirate’s credit risk dropped more than peers in the
 Middle East  last year as state-linked companies paid and
restructured debt. The cost of insuring the emirate’s unrated
bonds for five years has retreated 15 basis points this month to
210 yesterday, according to data provider CMA, which is owned by
McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the
privately negotiated market.  “Investor’s perception for Dubai credit risk has improved
significantly in 2012 and the strong risk-on momentum continues
into 2013,” Apostolos Bantis, a credit analyst at Commerzbank
AG in London, said yesterday.  The government hired  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) ,  Standard Chartered
Plc (STAN) ,  Emirates NBD PJSC (EMIRATES) ,  Dubai Islamic Bank PJSC (DIB)  and  National
Bank of Abu Dhabi PJSC  to arrange the sale, the people said.  Islamic Hub  Dubai plans to create an  Islamic finance  council to
regulate equity and fixed-income products as it seeks to become
a hub for the industry, taking on centers such Bahrain and
 Malaysia , home to the world’s biggest sukuk market. Islamic
finance will become one of the economy’s “core” industries,
the government said this month.  The premium investors demand to own Dubai’s bonds over
Malaysia’s 3.928 percent Shariah-compliant notes due June 2015
narrowed five basis points this month to 75 today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
