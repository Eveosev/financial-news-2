Ontario Finance Minister Dwight Duncan said the province’s deficit in the fiscal year that began
in April will be C$11.9 billion ($12 billion), not including a
C$500 million reserve, narrowing from the C$14.8 billion he
previously forecast.  The improvement in Ontario’s fiscal outlook comes from
higher corporate taxes after the province reassessed returns
from 2011 and earlier, and savings of more than C$1 billion
stemming from ending the practice of letting the province’s
teachers save up sick days, Duncan said.  Duncan made the comments in a speech to the Canadian Club
of Toronto. While the speech did give deficit estimates for
later years, Duncan said  Canada ’s most-populous province needs
C$2.5 billion in spending cuts over the coming years to meet its
budget goals, without elaborating.  “What we’ve done so far is the low-hanging fruit” of
deficit reduction, Duncan said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
