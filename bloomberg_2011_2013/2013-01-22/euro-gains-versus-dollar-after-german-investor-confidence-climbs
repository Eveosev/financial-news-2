The euro advanced against the
dollar, reversing its decline, after a report showed German
investor confidence increased more than economists predicted
this month to the strongest in 2 1/2 years.  Europe ’s common currency advanced 0.2 percent to $1.3339 at
10:06 a.m. London time, after earlier falling by 0.4 percent.  The ZEW Center for European Economic Research in Mannheim
said its index of investor and analyst expectations, which aims
to predict economic developments six months in advance, climbed
to 31.5 from 6.9 in December. That’s the highest since May 2010.
Economists forecast a gain to 12, according to the median of 39
estimates in a Bloomberg News survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
