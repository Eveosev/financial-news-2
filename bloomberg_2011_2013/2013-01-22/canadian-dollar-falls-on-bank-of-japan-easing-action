The Canadian dollar traded at almost
the lowest level this year against its U.S. counterpart as the
Bank of Canada is projected to maintain its benchmark interest
rate at one percent in a decision tomorrow.  The currency weakened versus the majority of its most-
traded peers after a report showed Canadian retail sales slowed
in November. Canada’s dollar fell against the yen, trimming a
gain this month, after the  Bank of Japan (8301)  said it will conduct
open-ended asset purchases starting in 2014, later than
estimated.  “We’re a long way from getting back to normal  interest
rates ,” said Aaron Fennell, a futures specialist at  Bank of
Nova Scotia (BNS) ’s ScotiaMcLeod unit, by phone from Toronto. “If
they do start raising rates in Canada, they’re going to do so
very cautiously, 25 basis points at a time. They’ll probably do
it two times and then lay off for a while to see what happens.”  The loonie, as the Canadian dollar is known for the image
of the waterfowl on the C$1 coin, rose 0.1 percent to 99.19
cents per U.S. dollar at 5 p.m. in Toronto, after falling to
99.46. It reached 99.47 on Jan. 18, the lowest level since Dec.
31. One loonie buys $1.0082.  It fell 0.9 percent to 89.43 per yen, paring a 2.3 percent
gain this month.  Options Data  Options traders became more bearish on the Canadian dollar.
The three-month so-called 25-delta risk reversal rate, which
measures the premium charged for the right to buy the  U.S.
dollar  against the loonie versus contracts to sell, traded as
high as 0.92 percentage point, the most since Nov. 27. It
averaged 1.5 percentage points during the past 12 months.  Futures of crude oil, Canada’s biggest export, rose 0.7
percent to $96.24 per barrel and the  Standard & Poor’s  500 stock
Index rose 0.4 percent.  Canada’s benchmark 10-year bonds rose, pushing the yield
down two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 1.91
percent. The 2.75 percent note maturing in June 2022 added 19
cents to C$107.16.  The Bank of Canada will announce further details on Jan. 24
for a Jan. 30 10-year note auction.  The central bank will keep the benchmark interest rate at
one percent when it announces its policy decision at 10 a.m.
tomorrow, according to the median forecast of 24 economists in a
Bloomberg survey. The  Bank of Canada  has kept its policy
interest rate at 1 percent since September 2010, the longest
pause since the 1950s, and has said since April that borrowing
costs may rise.  Economic Data  Retail sales rose 0.2 percent to C$39.4 billion ($39.7
billion) after October’s gain was revised down to 0.5,
 Statistics Canada  said today in Ottawa. Economists surveyed by
 Bloomberg News  forecast that retail sales would be unchanged
from the previous month, according to the median of 23
forecasts. Retail sales less autos fell 0.3 percent, from a
projected gain of 0.1 percent in a survey of 19 economists.  “I think for retail sales it was kind of a mixed report in
the sense that there were revisions to the October report and so
the upward surprise on headline was counterbalanced by a
downward surprise less autos, which was all counterbalanced by
what happened to the previous month’s revisions,” said  Camilla Sutton , head of currency strategy at Bank of  Nova Scotia , by
phone from Toronto. “So the market might have been a bit
confused by retail sales.”  Yen Trade  The Bank of  Japan  said it will conduct open-ended asset
purchases of 13 trillion yen a month starting next year and set
a 2 percent inflation target in a bid to weaken its currency and
end two decades of stagnation, disappointing investors who had
expected more immediate action to drive down the currency.  “There’s been so much yen weakness over the last two
months or so, I think it was natural to see some profit-taking
after the Bank of Japan announcement,” said Elsa Lignos, senior
currency strategist at Royal Bank of  Canada , by phone from
 London . Investors are “beginning to question whether the Bank
of Japan can really do enough to weaken the yen.”  Japan’s five-year note yield fell to 0.15 percent, the
lowest level since the government started selling the debt in
February 2000.  The loonie has fallen 1.7 percent during the past six
months versus nine developed-nation peers tracked by Bloomberg
Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The euro has gained 6 percent
while the greenback has dropped 4.6 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
