Azvi Grupo  of Spain won a $52.4
million contract to build a highway in  Serbia , expanding its
business in the biggest former Yugoslav republic.  Azvi has 24 months to build a 6.1-kilometer (3.79 miles)
stretch between Grdelica and Predejane, part of the highway
linking Serbia’s southern town of Nis with the Macedonian
border, the Sevilla-based company said on its website today.  Serbia is building roads and improving infrastructure as
part of a broader effort to attract foreign investment. Funding
for the project will come from the European Investment Bank, the
World Bank and the Serbian government.  Trace Group Hold AD (T57) , Bulgaria’s biggest road builder, said
today it won a $46 million contract to build a 5-kilometer
section of the same highway.  To contact the reporters on this story:
