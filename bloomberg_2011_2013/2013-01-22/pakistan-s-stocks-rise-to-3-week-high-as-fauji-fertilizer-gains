Pakistan’s (KSE100)  stocks rose to a three-
week high, led by Fauji Fertilizer Co., the biggest maker of the
farming material, which reports earnings tomorrow.  The Karachi Stock Exchange 100 Index gained 1.5 percent to
16,894.09, the highest close since Dec. 31. Fauji Fertilizer
rose 1.5 percent to 120.36 rupees, the biggest contributor to
the benchmark index’s advance.  Lucky Cement Ltd. (LUCK) , due to report
profit on Jan. 28, rose 1.6 percent to 153.46 rupees.  “Investors are confident that the earning season will be
pretty good this quarter,” Khurram Schehzad, head of research
at Arif Habib Ltd., said by phone.  Arif Habib, a Karachi-based brokerage, forecasts overall
earnings to rise as much as 15 percent in the three months to
Dec. 31 from a year earlier, he said. The KSE 100 trades for 6.9
times estimates for this year’s profit, the lowest among 15
Asia-Pacific benchmark indexes tracked by Bloomberg.  The KSE 100 tumbled 3.2 percent on Jan. 15, the biggest
drop since August 2011, after the nation’s  Supreme Court  ordered
the arrest of Prime Minister Raja Pervez Ashraf. The gauge has
climbed 4.9 percent since then, after the chairman of the anti-
corruption agency told the chief justice Jan. 17 there isn’t
enough evidence to arrest the prime minister and others accused
of graft in awarding power contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
