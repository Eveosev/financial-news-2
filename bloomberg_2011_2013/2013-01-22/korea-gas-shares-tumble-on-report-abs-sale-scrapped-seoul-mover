Korea Gas Corp. (036460) , the world’s biggest
liquefied natural gas importer, tumbled the most in more than
three years in Seoul trading after a report that the company
scrapped its plan to sell asset-backed securities.  Korea Gas retreated 9.3 percent to 70,300 won as of 9:57
a.m. on the Korea Exchange, heading toward its steepest loss
since Sept. 30, 2009. The stock was the  worst performer  on the
MSCI Asia Pacific Index.  Korea Gas decided not to sell 5.4 trillion won ($5.1
billion) of asset-backed securities after getting guidelines
from the Korea Accounting Standards Board, the Korea Economic
Daily reported today, citing an unidentified company official.
The utility had earlier tried to sell ABS with receivables as
collateral to lower debt levels.  “The news is hurting sentiment but I think today’s decline
is excessive,” Shin Ji Yoon, an analyst at KTB Investment &
Securities Co., said by telephone today. “If this sale is
canceled, there are other alternatives to help improve its
finances such as a tariff increase.”  Korea Gas hasn’t determined its position on the sale “for
the moment,” Song Jae Ho, a spokesman at the utility, said by
telephone today. Daishin Securities Co. reduced its share-price
estimate on Korea Gas to 90,000 won from 93,000 won, citing
lower chances of an ABS sale.  To contact the reporters on this story:
