The cost of insuring corporate and
sovereign bonds in the Asia-Pacific region from non-payment
dropped, according to credit-default swap traders.  The Markit iTraxx  Japan  index declined 1.5 basis points to
136.5 basis points as of 9:21 a.m. in  Tokyo , according to
Deutsche Bank AG prices. The measure is set for its lowest close
since March 19, according to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan retreated one basis point to 106 as of
8:29 a.m. in  Singapore , Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc prices
show. The benchmark, which has ranged from 102.8 to 110.1 this
year, is poised for its lowest close since Jan. 14, according to
CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices
quoted by dealers in the private market.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index dropped one basis point
to 114 as of 10:35 a.m. in Sydney, according to Australia & New
Zealand Banking Group Ltd. prices. The gauge is also set for its
lowest close since Jan. 14, CMA prices show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
