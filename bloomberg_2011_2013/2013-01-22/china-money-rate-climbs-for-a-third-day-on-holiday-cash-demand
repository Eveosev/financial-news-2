China’s money-market rate rose for a
third day on speculation cash supply will wane as the Lunar New
Year holiday approaches.  The People’s Bank of China conducted 43 billion  yuan  ($6.9
billion) of seven-day reverse-repurchase operations today,
according to a trader required to bid at the auctions. The yield
was kept unchanged at 3.35 percent, the trader said.  The seven-day  repurchase rate , which measures interbank
funding availability, climbed six basis points to 3 percent as
of 10:16 a.m. in  Shanghai , according to a weighted average
compiled by the National Interbank Funding Center. The overnight
 rate  dropped one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 1.93
percent.  “Liquidity will probably become tight before the
holiday,” said Wang Huane, a senior bond trader at Qilu Bank Co.
in Jinan, the capital of eastern Shandong province. An overnight
rate of close to 2 percent is “very rare” and “can’t last
long,” she said.  The one-year interest-rate swap, the fixed cost needed to
receive the floating seven-day repo rate, gained one basis point
to 3.15 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
