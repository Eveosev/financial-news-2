Europe ’s largest airports are
returning to normal operations after five days of heavy
disruptions related to ice and snow.  London ’s  Heathrow Airport , Europe’s busiest hub, has
scrapped 10 flights today as a result of weather conditions
elsewhere in Europe, after canceling 196 yesterday. British
Airways said operations are on their way back to normal with
some cancellations as a result of aircraft availability and
weather. Deutsche  Lufthansa  AG listed 76 canceled flights on its
website, compared with more than 500 yesterday.  Airports across Europe ground to a halt at times since Jan.
17 after snowfall covered runways and freezing rain coated
planes with thick layers of ice. Vienna received the most
snowfall in 26 years, and Charles de Gaulle and Orly airports in
Paris had been limited to 60 percent of service.  Fraport AG said 45 flights had been canceled today at
 Frankfurt , Europe’s third busiest hub, and inbound flights were
limited to 25 per hour between 9 a.m. and 11 a.m. local time.
Munich airport,  Germany ’s second busiest, said operations were
back to normal with no more weather-related cancellations.  To contact the reporters on this story:
