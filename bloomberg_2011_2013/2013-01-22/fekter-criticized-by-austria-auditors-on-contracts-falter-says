Austrian Finance Minister Maria Fekter’s spending on consultants and political allies when she
led the  Interior Ministry  was criticized by the country’s audit
court, Falter newspaper  reported .  The court audited the Interior Ministry’s accounts during
the period when it was led by Fekter, from 2008 to 2011,
spokeswoman Doris Grabherr said today via phone. She declined to
give further details because the findings are preliminary.
Fekter’s press office at the  Finance Ministry  declined to
comment and pointed to a statement by the Interior Ministry.  “All procurement transactions are carried out within the
legal framework,” the Interior Ministry said in an  OTS
statement , adding that the draft copy of the report shouldn’t
have been made public.  Fekter awarded contracts of 360,000 euros ($479,000) to
coaches and communications advisers, Falter reported. Most of
those awards went to a company linked to former Interior
Minister Ernst Strasser, the newspaper said. Strasser, who went
on to become a member of the European Parliament after leaving
the ministry, was sentenced last week to four years in prison
after being found guilty of corruption and influence peddling.  The draft audit report obtained by Falter called the 1
million euros spent on an Interior Ministry website
“incomprehensible” and said that 40 percent of awarded
contracts were missing data, according to the paper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
