Pork inventories in the U.S. rose 14

percent from the end of November.  Commercial pork  output  in the first 11 months of 2012
totaled 21.297 billion pounds (9.66 million metric tons), 2.9
percent more than in the same period in the previous year,
government data show.  “We still had big production,”  Don Roose , the president
of U.S. Commodities Inc., said in a telephone interview from
 West Des Moines ,  Iowa , before the report. “I don’t see that we
