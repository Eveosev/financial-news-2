Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) , the world’s
largest retailer, will sell  Research In Motion Ltd. (RIMM) ’s new
BlackBerry 10 in Canada and possibly the U.S., giving the
smartphone maker another ally in its comeback effort.  Wal-Mart’s Canadian unit is taking pre-orders from
customers for the phone, which Waterloo, Ontario-based RIM will
debut on Jan. 30, said Alex Roberton, a Wal-Mart Canada
spokesman, following a meeting at Bloomberg’s Toronto office.  Wal-Mart is still confirming its plans for BlackBerry 10 in
the U.S., spokeswoman Sarah Spencer said, declining to comment
further.  RIM is counting on enthusiasm for the BlackBerry 10,
especially in Canada where earlier models first appeared more
than a decade ago, to reverse six  quarters  of declining sales
and make the brand competitive again with  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s iPhone.
RIM shares have nearly tripled since late September on optimism
for its prospects of a recovery.  RIM jumped 13 percent to $17.90 at 4 p.m. in New York, its
highest since Dec. 1, 2011.  Wal-Mart, based in Bentonville, Arkansas said today it will
spend C$450 million ($453 million) building new outlets and
renovating stores in Canada, and expects to have 379 locations
in the country by the end of the month.  To contact the reporters on this story:
