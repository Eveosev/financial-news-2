Most Chinese stocks dropped as
losses for consumer-staples producers and drugmakers
overshadowed gains for banks.  About two shares declined for every one that advanced on
the Shanghai Composite Index, which rose 0.1 percent to 2,330.32
at the 11:30 a.m. local time break. The CSI Index added 0.3
percent to 2,617.45. Stock indexes erased losses after the
official Xinhua News Agency reported China Securities Regulatory
Commission Chairman  Guo Shuqing  as saying that it’s necessary to
intervene in the stock market at “key moments.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
