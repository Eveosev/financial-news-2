Indonesia ’s rupiah forwards climbed
to the strongest level in a month on optimism rising commodity
prices will boost the nation’s export earnings and help narrow
the trade deficit.  The Commodity Research Bureau’s BLS Spot Index for all
commodities reached 487.44 on Jan. 18, the highest level since
Oct. 18. Indonesia is the world’s biggest exporter of tin and
palm oil. The nation’s  trade balance  remained in deficit for a
second month in November as overseas shipments fell for an
eighth month, official data show. The central bank will unveil
measures to boost the exchange rate to between 9,400 per dollar
and 9,600, Investor Daily Indonesia reported yesterday, citing
Governor  Darmin Nasution .  “Commodity prices are positively correlated with the trade
balance, where a narrowing deficit will support the rupiah,”
said Mika Martumpal, a currency analyst at PT Bank CIMB Niaga in
Jakarta. “Bank Indonesia’s pledge to support the exchange rate
also lends good sentiment.”  The currency’s one-month non-deliverable forwards rose 0.3
percent to 9,758 per dollar as of 3:20 p.m. in Jakarta, after
reaching 9,748 earlier, the strongest level since Dec. 20, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. That’s 1 percent weaker than the
spot rate, which fell 0.5 percent to 9,663, prices from local
banks compiled by Bloomberg show.  The rupiah’s one-month implied volatility, a measure of
expected moves in exchange rates used to price options, dropped
25 basis points, or 0.25 percentage point, to 6.5 percent. A
daily  fixing  used to settle the derivative contracts was set at
9,761 today by the Association of Banks in  Singapore .  The yield on the 5.625 percent government bonds due May
2023 lost one basis point to 5.24 percent, the lowest since Jan.
10, according to prices from the Inter Dealer Market Association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
