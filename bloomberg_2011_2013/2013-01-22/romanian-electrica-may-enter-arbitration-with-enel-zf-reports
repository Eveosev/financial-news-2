Electrica SA , a Romanian state-owned
power distributor, may enter arbitration with  Enel SpA (ENEL)  over the
sale of a minority stake in one of Electrica’s former units to
the Italian utility, Enel,  Ziarul Financiar  reported.  Electrica, which seeks to raise about 500 million euros
($668 million) from the sale of a 13.57 percent stake in Enel’s
unit, may ask the Paris-based Arbitration Court to resolve a
dispute after the Italian company challenged the formula to
determine the stake sale price, the Bucharest-based newspaper
said, citing unidentified people with knowledge of the matter.  The sale of Electrica’s minority stake is part of an option
from a 2008 contract when Enel bought a majority stake in the
Romanian energy company, known as Electrica Muntenia Sud.  To contact the reporter on this story:
