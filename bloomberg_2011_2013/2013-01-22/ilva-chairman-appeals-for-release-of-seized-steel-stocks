Bruno Ferrante, chairman of Gruppo
Riva SpA’s Ilva unit, asked prosecutors to release steel stocks
seized by a court so the company can pay workers and carry out
environmental improvements at its plant in southern  Italy ,
according to an e-mailed statement.  Prosecutors in July ordered the seizure of about $2 billion
of Ilva assets and demanded the arrest of some executives on
suspicion they knowingly neglected environmental controls at the
plant in Taranto, contributing to high cancer rates in the area.
Milan-based Riva disputes responsibility for health risks in the
region.  The standoff has proven to be a headache for the government
of Prime Minister  Mario Monti , which has been trying to keep the
plant operating while responding to the health concerns. Monti’s
government passed an emergency decree to keep the plant open,
while the Riva family has threatened to close the plant
entirely.  Ilva accounts for 30 percent of Italy’s steel production
and about 12,000 jobs in a city where unemployment tops 30
percent. Ilva generates 75 percent of the province of Taranto’s
gross domestic product, according to the company.  Fabio Riva, a company vice president and son of Ilva owner
Emilio Riva, was arrested today in  London , news agency Ansa
reported. In December, prosecutors issued a European arrest
warrant for Fabio Riva, Ansa previously reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
