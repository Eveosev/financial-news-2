Diesel-making capacity in  Europe  has
increased by 360,000 barrels a day in the past five years even
as crude refineries are halted, a trend that may boost  gasoline 
processing margins, according to JBC Energy GmbH.  The growth in hydrocrackers, a unit that mostly produces
middle distillates such as diesel and gasoil, coincided with a 1
million barrel-a-day drop in European crude refining capacity in
the same period, the Vienna-based researcher said today in a
research note.  “The ongoing shift toward middle distillate production at
the expense of gasoline is not a regional European phenomenon,
but rather a global trend,” JBC Energy said.  A lack of gasoline blending components, used to create
high-octane grades, during the summer driving season in Europe
and  North America  may have caused some of the “spikes in
gasoline cracks witnessed last year,” JBC Energy said. Crack is
the spread between an oil-product and crude, and is also a
measure of refinery profitability.  European gasoline crack, or premium to  Brent crude , reached
a five-year high of $18.07 a barrel on Sept. 26, according to
data from PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a crude and refined products
broker in  London . It was $7.74 as of 10:22 a.m. today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
