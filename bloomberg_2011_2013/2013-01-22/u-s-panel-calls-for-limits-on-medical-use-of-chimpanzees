Most of the chimpanzees supported by
the U.S. government for medical research should be retired
because their use provides little benefit for biomedical
discoveries, a panel recommended.  The government should retire 93 percent of the almost 700
chimpanzees it houses or supports, transferring them to a
federal sanctuary, and maintain a population of 50 for future
research, a National Institutes of health task force said in a
 report .  “In light of evidence suggesting that research involving
chimpanzees has rarely accelerated new discoveries or the
advancement of human health for infectious diseases, with a few
notable exceptions such as the hepatitis viruses, the NIH should
emphasize the development and refinement of other approaches,”
such as genetically altered mice, the group said.  The report released yesterday follows an earlier review
sought by the health institutes in response to complaints from
U.S. senators and animal-rights groups.  The NIH, based in Bethesda,  Maryland , stopped breeding the
chimpanzees in 1995. Animal rights groups led by the Washington-
based  Humane Society  of the  United States  have called on
Congress and the government to end chimpanzee research.  The agency will review the recommendations and take public
comment on the report for 60 days before announcing a decision
in late March, the NIH said in a  statement  on its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
