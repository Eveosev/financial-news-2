Lowe’s Cos. (LOW) , the second-largest U.S.
home-improvement retailer, plans to hire 45,000 seasonal
workers, 13 percent more than a year earlier, and add 9,000
permanent employees as the housing rebound spurs remodeling.  All of the positions are part-time and aimed at improving
service to customers, Mooresville, North Carolina-based Lowe’s
said today in a statement. The permanent workers will be
assigned to the stores’ busiest weekday shopping times. Lowe’s
added about 40,000 seasonal workers last year.  The increased hiring signals Lowe’s expects higher sales at
stores open at least a year, said  Colin McGranahan , an analyst
at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. Sales of existing U.S. homes last
year rose to the highest level in five years on rising prices,
historically low  mortgage rates  and stronger employment.  “Housing is growing nicely, and the home-improvement
market should grow as well,” McGranahan, who’s based in  New
York , said today in an e-mail. He rates Lowe’s market perform,
the equivalent of a hold.  Spending on home improvement may accelerate this year after
rising an estimated 9 percent in 2012, according to the Joint
Center for Housing Studies at  Harvard University . The center
projects homeowner-improvement spending will rise 11 percent to
an annualized $127 billion in the first quarter, followed by
increases of 17 percent in the second quarter and 20 percent in
the third quarter.  Sales of existing homes will rise about 7.2 percent to 4.98
million this year, the highest since 2007, according to the
median estimate of economists and housing analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg. Prices will gain 3.3 percent after an estimated 4.5
percent jump in 2012, according to the forecasters.  For all of 2012, 4.65 million homes were sold despite an
unexpected drop in December due to a shrinking supply of houses,
figures from the National Association of Realtors in  Washington 
showed today.  Lowe’s rose 1.2 percent to $37.44 at the close in New York.
 Home Depot Inc. (HD) , the largest U.S. home-improvement retailer,
advanced 0.4 percent to $65.75.  To contact the reporter on this story:
