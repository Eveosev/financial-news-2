Usinas Siderurgicas de Minas Gerais
SA ,  Brazil ’s second-biggest steelmaker by market value, fell to
a five-week low after  Banco BTG Pactual SA (BBTG11)  cut the stock to sell
and said prices for the metal aren’t likely to rise.  Usiminas, as the  Belo Horizonte , Brazil-based company is
known, slumped 4.6 percent to 11.48 reais at 1:19 p.m. in Sao
Paulo after earlier reaching 11.45 reais, the lowest intraday
price since Dec. 17. The stock had doubled over the past six
months.  “We are downgrading Usiminas after its strong six-month
performance,” BTG Pactual analysts Edmo Chagas, Antonio Heluany
and Gregory Goldfinger wrote in a note to clients dated today.
“The market is too enthusiastic about a potential earnings
improvement, and we see significant room for disappointment.”  BTG estimates Usiminas will post earnings before interest,
taxes, depreciation and amortization of 1.6 billion reais ($780
million) this year, less than the 1.8 billion reais average
estimate of 15 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Steel prices are unlikely to rise given excess global
capacity in the industry, the analysts wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
