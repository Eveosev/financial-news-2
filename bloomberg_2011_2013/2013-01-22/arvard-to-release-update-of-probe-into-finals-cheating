Harvard University  said it completed
its investigation of plagiarism on a final exam last year and
would provide an update after students and faculty return from
winter break next week.  About 125 Harvard undergraduates who took a popular
government class were under scrutiny for alleged plagiarism on
their take-home final. Harvard’s Administrative Board has
informed each student “of the disposition of his or her
individual case,” the school said in an e-mailed statement.  Harvard, based in Cambridge,  Massachusetts , has called the
suspected plagiarism the most widespread cheating scandal in
living memory. Students may have collaborated or copied answers,
officials have said. About 20 students and graduates went to the
media to defend their actions, saying that such behavior was
tacitly condoned by the professor and teaching fellows in the
class, which they identified as Introduction to Congress.  “The cases were exceptionally complex and involved far
more students than any other set of cases in recent memory,
requiring great amounts of time and effort from the staff and
faculty involved,” Harvard said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
