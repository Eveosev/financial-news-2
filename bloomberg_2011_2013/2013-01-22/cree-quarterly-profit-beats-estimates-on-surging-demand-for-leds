Cree Inc. (CREE) , a maker of energy-
efficient lighting products, reported quarterly profit that
jumped 69 percent as demand for its light-emitting diodes
surged.  Net income for the second fiscal quarter ending Dec. 31
rose to $20.4 million, or 18 cents a share, from $12.1 million,
or 10 cents, a year earlier, the Durham, North Carolina-based
company said today in a statement. That beat the 14.5-cent
average estimate of 17 analysts compiled by Bloomberg.  Cree expects sales of $325 million to $345 million in the
current quarter, higher than the $322.6 million expected by
analysts.  Cree jumped 14 percent to $37.99 at 4:34 p.m. after the
close of regular trading in New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
