Azerbaijan  exported less crude oil
in 2012 as the Caspian Sea nation cut production for a second
year. The country also delivered less natural-gas overseas.  The largest oil producer in the former  Soviet Union  after
Russia and Kazakhstan shipped 34.9 million metric tons, down 6.7
percent, according to data published on the  website  of the State
Customs Committee. Exports of natural gas declined by 1.4
percent to 6.99 billion cubic meters, the data showed.  Azerbaijan produced 43 million tons of oil in 2012, a drop
of 5.3 percent, the committee said Jan. 17. Output of marketable
natural gas expanded 5.4 percent to 17.2 billion cubic meters.  The country exports gas to Turkey, Russia and Georgia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
