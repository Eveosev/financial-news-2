European gasoil futures advanced to
the highest level in 12 weeks high amid a cold snap and as
refiners curbed production because of falling margins.  Gasoil for February delivery jumped as much as $8.75, or
0.9 percent, to $973.25 a metric ton on the ICE Futures  Europe 
exchange in  London . That was the most since Oct. 30 and is above
the five-year seasonal average. The contract was at $970.50 as
of 1:15 p.m. local time.  “Temperatures across the European Union have plummeted,
helping push gasoil prices higher,” Abhishek Deshpande, an oil
markets analyst at Natixis SA said today in an e-mailed response
to questions. “On the supply side, refineries in Europe and
 Russia  have reduced their processing rates in response to the
deteriorating margins,” with some plants in northwest Europe
making losses since mid-December, he said.  France’s Lavera refinery, the Netherlands’ Pernis plant and
Exxon Mobil Corp.’s Fawley in the U.K. were among the sites
operating at reduced rates, the  International Energy Agency  said
Feb. 18, citing press reports.  Freezing temperatures were recorded in Frankfurt,
Amsterdam, Stockholm and Vienna today, according to data from
CustomWeather Inc.  Hundreds of European flights were disrupted yesterday after
snow and ice swept through the continent.  Heathrow airport  in
London, Europe’s busiest hub, scrapped 196 flights yesterday, or
about 15 percent of the total. The temperature may fall to minus
4 degrees Celsius (25 Fahrenheit) tomorrow in London, according
to a forecast from the  U.K. Met Office .  To contact the reporter on this story:
