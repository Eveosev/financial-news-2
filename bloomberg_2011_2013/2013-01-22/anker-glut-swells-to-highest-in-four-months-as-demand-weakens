The glut of supertankers competing
for 2 million-barrel cargoes of Persian Gulf oil expanded to the
highest in more than four months, driving down freight rates as
demand for the ships weakens.  There are 22 percent more very large crude carriers for
hire over the next 30 days than cargoes, according to the median
estimate of seven shipbrokers and owners in a Bloomberg News
survey today. That’s 2.5 percentage points more than last week,
and the biggest excess since Sept. 5.  Demand is “very slow,” with only one of the tankers
booked yesterday, RS Platou Markets AS, an Oslo-based investment
bank, said in an e-mailed note today. Vessels booked two months
ago are now returning to the Persian Gulf seeking employment,
swelling supply, said Per Mansson, managing director of
shipbroker Norocean Stockholm AB, who has worked in the industry
for 31 years.  “December and January did not pick up as we thought,”
Mansson said by phone from the city.  “It’s going to be tough.
We will work with a big overhang of vessels every month.”  Daily  returns  for tankers hauling 2 million barrels of
crude to  Japan  from  Saudi Arabia  slumped 11 percent to $8,994,
according to the London-based Baltic Exchange yesterday. That
was the first time since Nov. 12 earnings were below $10,000.  To contact the reporter on this story:
