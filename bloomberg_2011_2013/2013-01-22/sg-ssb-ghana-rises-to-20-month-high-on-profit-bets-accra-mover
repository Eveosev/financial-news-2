SG-SSB Ltd. (SGSSB) , a Ghanaian unit of
 Societe Generale SA (GLE) , rose to the highest in more than 20 months
on speculation profit increased last year.  The stock gained 1.8 percent to 56 pesewas by 1:54 p.m. in
the capital, Accra, the highest since May 10, 2011.  Net income advanced to 22.3 million cedis ($11.7 million)
in the nine months through September, from 14.5 million cedis a
year earlier, SG-SSB said on Oct. 25. Full-year profit is
expected to be 30 million cedis, according to Derrick Mensah,
research analyst at SIC Financial Services Ltd. in Accra.  “The bank introduced new technology-backed products for
retail customers in the later part of last year, which I’m sure
gave them more business,” he said in a phone interview.  The annual results are expected by the second week in
February, Mensah said.  There was no response to telephone calls made to the office
of Gilbert Hie, managing director of SG-SSB.  To contact the reporter on this story:
