Serbiaâ€™s energy regulator set higher
natural gas prices for households and business consumers for the
first time in 15 months as the state-owned gas monopoly seeks to
trim losses.  As of Feb. 1, homes will pay 8.6 percent more on average,
or 44.4 dinars ($0.53) per cubic meter of gas, while a 9.5
percent increase for small and medium-sized businesses brings
their average price to 40.42 dinars per cubic meter, the
Belgrade-based  Energy Agency  said in an e-mailed statement.  Large industrial consumers pay 39.13 dinars per cubic meter
following a 10 percent price increase on Jan. 15.  The regulator allowed price increases following evidence
that Srbijagas JP, the sole importer and main local gas
supplier, was selling gas below the cost of imports.  Srbijagas  has relied on sovereign-backed loans to bolster
liquidity as the government kept gas prices below market levels
amid recession, high unemployment and high inflation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
