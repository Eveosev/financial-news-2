Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  co-Chief Executive
Officer Anshu Jain said he was sickened by the manipulation of
interbank lending rates.  “The Libor affair sickens us all,” Jain told clients and
investors during a panel discussion in Koenigstein, a town near
Germany’s financial capital Frankfurt, late yesterday. “I don’t
think any CEO thought this was a possibility. It sickens me the
most of all the scandals.”  Regulators from  Canada  to Switzerland are investigating
whether more than a dozen banks, including Deutsche Bank, were
colluding to rig the rate. Deutsche Bank says it has set aside
reserves for possible financial damages related to Libor,
without specifying their value.  Jain, 50, declined to comment in detail about the alleged
rigging of Libor, the benchmark for more than $300 trillion of
securities, citing ongoing probes and litigation. It is clear
that the level of wrongdoing varied across banks, he said.  Barclays Plc (BARC)  CEO Bob Diamond resigned in July after his
bank said it manipulated the rate. The firm was fined 290
million pounds ($459 million) by regulators.  UBS AG (UBSN) ,
Switzerland’s biggest bank, is paying 1.4 billion Swiss francs
($1 billion) for trying to rig global interest rates.  Deutsche Bank said in July that an internal investigation
found misconduct by individual employees, though no wrongdoing
by any current or former members of the board.  To contact the reporter on this story:
