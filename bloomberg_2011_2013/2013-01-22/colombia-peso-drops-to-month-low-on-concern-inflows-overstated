Colombia ’s peso fell the most since
August on speculation investors overestimated the amount of
foreign investment flows coming into the Andean country.  The peso depreciated 0.6 percent to 1,777.70 per  U.S.
dollar  at the close of trading in Bogota, the biggest drop since
Aug. 15. The peso reached 1,750.50 on Jan. 2, the strongest
intraday level since July 2011.  “People are realizing the move we saw earlier this year in
the peso was exaggerated,”  Camilo Perez , the head analyst at
Banco de Bogota SA, the country’s second-biggest bank, said in a
phone interview from Bogota. “So far we haven’t been seeing the
strong inflows that justified the rally.”  Finance Minister  Mauricio Cardenas  told reporters last week
that the government will use “all its ammunition” to stem
gains in the peso, which are making the nation’s coffee, flower
and banana exporters less competitive. He ruled out  capital
controls , which he said aren’t effective.  The yield on Colombia’s 10 percent peso-denominated debt
due in 2024 fell one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to
5.29 percent, according to the central bank. That is the lowest
level on a closing basis since the government began issuing the
securities in 2009.  Colombia sold $1 billion of 10-year dollar bonds today to
yield 2.718 percent, Public Credit Director Maria Fernanda
Suarez said in an interview. Investor demand was more than three
times the amount offered, she said. Deutsche Bank AG and Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. managed the sale.  To contact the reporter on this story:
