Draegerwerk AG & Co. KGaA, a German
medical-equipment manufacturer, said it exceeded an earnings
target after generating a higher number of orders for more
profitable products such as ventilators at the end of 2012.  Earnings before interest and tax were as much as 9.7
percent of revenue last year according to preliminary data, the
Luebeck, Germany-based company said today in an e-mailed
statement. Draegerwerk had said its so-called Ebit margin would
be in the “mid-range” of 8 percent to 9.5 percent, according
to the statement.  Sales rose 5.3 percent to almost 2.4 billion euros ($3.2
billion) in 2012 from a year earlier while order intake gained
4.8 percent to “a good” 2.4 billion euros, the company said.
Excluding currency effects, sales increased 2.6 percent while
order intake advanced 2.2 percent, according to the statement.  Sales should rise at about the same rate this year as they
did in 2012 when excluding currency effects, Draegerwerk said.
The company’s Ebit margin will be 8 percent to 10 percent
depending on individual markets and products, according to the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
