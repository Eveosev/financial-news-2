Yields on  Peru ’s benchmark bonds due
in 2020 held within two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point,
of a record low even as the steepest yield curve ever attracted
foreign investors to longer-dated securities.  The yield on the government’s sol-denominated debt due in
2020 rose one basis point to 3.72 percent at the close of
trading in Lima, according to prices compiled by Bloomberg. It
closed at 3.70 percent on Jan. 15, the lowest since the
securities were first issued in February 2006. The sol was
little changed at 2.5535 per U.S. dollar today.  Investors from outside Peru have begun to place bets that
the  yield curve  will flatten with yields on long bonds falling
relative to shorter-dated bonds, said Diego Alvarez, a trader at
Banco Internacional del Peru in  Lima .  “The curve remains near historic lows,” Alvarez said.
“We are seeing foreigners selling in the belly of the curve
after a long time and buying in the long part. We believe they
expect the curve to flatten.”  In the last week, yields on shorter-dated Peruvian
 government bonds  fell while the yield on the longest bonds rose.
The yield on Peru’s 9.91 percent debt due in 2015 fell 24 basis
points to 2.06 percent since Jan. 15. prices. The yield on its
bonds due in 2042 rose eight basis points to 4.93 percent.  The central bank bought $50 million in the  spot market 
today to weaken the sol. It paid an average 2.5543 soles per
 U.S. dollar .  To contact the reporter on this story:
