Argentina’s Planning Minister Julio de Vido is pressuring Chubut authorities to amend a new oil law
to accommodate  BP Plc (BP/) ’s local unit, La Nacion said, citing an
unidentified provincial official.  De Vido met with billionaire Carlos Bulgheroni, who
operates the BP unit, Pan American Energy LLC, and Chubut
Governor Martin Buzzi, and asked the latter to be open-minded in
negotiations with the producer to resolve differences over the
law approved in December, the Buenos Aires-based newspaper said.  Pan American Energy, or PAE, is operated by 40 percent
owner Bridas Corp., a venture between the Bulgheroni family and
China’s state-owned producer  Cnooc Ltd. (883) , La Nacion said, citing
the undisclosed Chubut official.  The Argentine government wants to remain in good standing
with Bridas as it’s proceeding with a planned partnership deal
to jointly develop Vaca Muerta shale formation with state-owned
producer  YPF SA (YPFD) , La Nacion said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
