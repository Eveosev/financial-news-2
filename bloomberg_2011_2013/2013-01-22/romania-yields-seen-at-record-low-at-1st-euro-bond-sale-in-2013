Yields at  Romania ’s first euro-
denominated bond sale this year are expected to fall to a record
after the nation’s inclusion in benchmark emerging-market
indexes increased the appeal of its debt.  The  Finance Ministry  will sell 150 million euros ($199
million) of three-year bonds in the local market, according to a
calendar published on Bloomberg. The average yield may fall to
between 3.15 percent and 3.25 percent, the lowest for this
maturity, according to analysts at Erste Group Bank AG in Vienna
and Piraeus Bank Romania SA in Bucharest. That compares with a
rate of 3.4 percent in a sale on Nov. 16, according to the
central bank’s data.  “We are expecting the government to borrow significantly
above the notional amount, paying yields at around 3.25
percent,” Bucharest-based analysts at Piraeus, including Camil Apostol, wrote in a note today.  Romania’s local currency debt is eligible for inclusion in
the  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) ’s GBI-EM Index Series in a rebalance on
March 1, the U.S. bank said on Jan. 15. Barclays Plc also said
on Nov. 6 it will add Nigeria and Romania to its emerging-market
local-currency government bond index from March.  The country plans to issue euro-denominated bonds on a
quarterly basis this year as it is scheduled to repay 1.76
billion euros of state debt maturing this year, the Finance
Ministry said on its website. It has raised 10.3 billion lei ($3
billion) of leu-denominated debt this month, the most since the
central bank started recording the data in 2005.  “We expect solid demand and the ministry to accept bids
around a yield of 3.15 percent,” traders at Vienna-based Erste
wrote in a note today.  The leu weakened 0.3 percent to 4.3643 per euro at 11:34
a.m. in Bucharest, depreciating for a third day.  To contact the reporters on this story:
