Sky Oesterreich GmbH lost a
challenge at the European Union’s highest court over whether
exclusive television content can be accessed free-of-charge by
broadcasters.  Such rights “have asset value and do not constitute mere
commercial interests or opportunities,” the  EU Court of Justice 
said in a statement today.  Sky  Austria ,  owned  by  Sky Deutschland AG (SKYD) , challenged a
decision forcing it to grant the country’s state-run television
broadcaster, ORF, free access to images of matches involving
Austrian teams it got under an exclusive contract with European
soccer governing body UEFA. Sky argued this requirement, which
stems from  EU law , as “seriously unfair” and restricting its
property right.  “EU law already provided for the right to make short news
reports, while limiting the amount of compensation to the
additional costs directly incurred in providing access to the
signal” when Sky bought the rights, the Luxembourg-based EU
court said. “Sky cannot rely on an established legal position
enabling it to exercise its exclusive broadcasting rights
autonomously.”  Sky said it sought clarification “in the name of all
owners of exclusive rights” on whether providing such content
for free “constitutes a disproportionate intervention in the
basic right of ownership,” according to an e-mailed statement.
The decision won’t change the company’s practice since 2010 to
cooperate with other stations, it said.  The case is: C-283/11, Sky Oesterreich GmbH v.
