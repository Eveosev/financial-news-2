German electricity for next-day
delivery rose as forecasts of declining wind generation
indicated lower supplies.  Baseload German power for Wednesday , for delivery around
the clock, climbed as much as 10 percent to 58 euros ($77.05) a
megawatt-hour and was last traded at 56.90 euros at 1:45 p.m.
Berlin time, according to broker data compiled by Bloomberg.
Day-ahead power settled at 59.74 euros in a daily auction on
EPEX Spot SE, according to data on Bloomberg. Wind generation
tomorrow will drop to almost zero from a maximum of 10 gigawatts
today,  Meteologica SA , a Madrid-based weather forecaster, said
on its website.  February power gained for the first time in 11 days. The
contract rose as much as 2.1 percent to 45.50 euros a megawatt-
hour, recovering from yesterday’s record low of 44.50 euros.  Profitability for German gas-fed power  plants for 2014 fell
3.5 percent to minus 14.72 euros a megawatt-hour, the lowest
since Bloomberg started tracking the data in 2009. The country’s
shift to renewable energy sources has cut into the profits of
gas-fed  power plants  that remain offline when intermittent solar
and wind power floods the grid.  More than 45 percent, or 50,000 megawatts, of central
European gas and power capacity needs to be closed to stabilize
profits, according to Per Lekander, a Paris-based analyst for
 UBS AG. (UBSN)   “European power generation cannot be stabilized through
cost cuts,” he said today in an e-mailed note. “The solution
should instead be large-scale capacity closures.”  In  France , total demand rose 2.1 percent to 489.5 terawatt-
hours in 2012 as the coldest weather in three decades drove up
use of home heating, the country’s grid operator said today.
French industrial power demand fell 4 percent last year as car
and steel factories slowed output amid an economic slump,
according to a statement from  Reseau de Transport d’Electricite .  To contact the reporter on this story:
