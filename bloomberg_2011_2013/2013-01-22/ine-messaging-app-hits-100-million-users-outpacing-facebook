Line , an instant messaging app run
by the owner of South Korea’s biggest Internet search engine,
registered 100 million users since the start of operations in
June 2011, almost triple the pace of growth for Facebook.  Subscribers to the service, which allows users to customize
messages with graphic images called “stickers”, send photos
and make free calls, climbed from about 11 million in December
2011, operator  NHN Corp. (035420)  said in a  statement  on its website Jan.
18. Line is available for download for free on smartphones
running  Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s Android and  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s iOS software and
on personal computers.  The application, which counts  Snoop Dogg  among its users,
reached the 100 million milestone in 19 months, versus 49 months
for Twitter Inc.’s service and 54 months for Facebook’s social
network, NHN said. Growth was helped by the increasing
popularity of smartphones, shipments of which are estimated by
researcher IDC to have climbed  45 percent  last year.  Line also attracted company users ranging from Coca Cola
Co. and Kentucky Fried Chicken Japan Ltd. to Panasonic Corp. and
Walt Disney Co., according to the application’s listings. The
Japanese Prime Minister’s Office drew 1 million followers since
registering in October, compared with the 124,857 it has on
Twitter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
