European coal for 2014 delivery
increased the most in 11 days as oil gained after  Japan ’s
central bank said it will expand asset purchases to lift the
world’s third-biggest oil consumer out of recession.  Thermal coal for 2014 delivery to Amsterdam, Rotterdam or
Antwerp rose as much as 0.7 percent to $99.50 a metric ton as of
