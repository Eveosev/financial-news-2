Soichiro Monji, chief strategist at
Tokyo-based Daiwa SB Investments Ltd., which manages the
equivalent of about 6 trillion yen ($67 billion), speaks on the
 Bank of Japan (8301) ’s policy decision today and its impact on the
market.  The BOJ set a 2 percent inflation target and said it will
shift to Federal Reserve-style open-ended asset purchases from
January 2014. The Nikkei 225 Stock Average fell 0.7 percent at 2
p.m. in Tokyo after jumping as much as 1 percent after the
announcement.  “The market got speculative buying when investors jumped
on headlines without looking to the content of the announcement.  ‘‘As they regained calmness, they realized there’s not much
new. Open-ended asset purchases were unexpected by some folks
including myself, but it’s the same in that they will keep
buying  government bonds .”  “The correction in the market will be big because shares
were overbought and the yen was sold too much.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
