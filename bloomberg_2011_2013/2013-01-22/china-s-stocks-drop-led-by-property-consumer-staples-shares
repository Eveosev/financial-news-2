China’s stocks  fell for the first
time in three days, led by property developers, after valuations
for the benchmark index approached eight-month highs.  Poly Real Estate Group Co. (600048) , the nation’s second-largest
developer, declined 2.1 percent, paring gains since the end of
August to almost 50 percent. Tsingtao Brewery Co.,  China ’s
second-biggest brewery by volume, dropped 1.2 percent as
Citigroup Inc. turned negative on the stock. China Citic Bank
Corp. climbed 3.1 percent to lead bank stocks higher.  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  slid 0.6 percent to 2,315.14
at the close. The index is valued at 12.8 times reported profit,
near the highest level since May,  data  compiled by Bloomberg
show. The  CSI 300 Index (SHSZ300)  lost 0.5 percent to 2,596.90. The  Hang
Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  advanced 0.5 percent.  “There’s profit-taking so we need a few sessions of
consolidation before it can go higher,” said Deng Wenyuan, an
analyst at Soochow Securities Co. in Suzhou, near  Shanghai .  The Shanghai measure has risen 18 percent since approaching
a four-year low on Dec. 3 amid signs of an economic recovery and
on speculation urban development will increase construction
demand.  Chinese stock losses accelerated in the afternoon after the
official Xinhua News Agency responded to China Securities
Regulatory Commission Chairman  Guo Shuqing ’s comments that
intervention in the stock market is necessary at “key
moments.”  Guo was cited by Xinhua as saying that it’s necessary to
intervene as the market is not mature. He was speaking at a
government national securities and futures supervision meeting.
The immaturity of any stock market shouldn’t be an excuse for
market intervention, Xinhua said in an unsigned commentary
posted on its Sina microblog.  Property Valuations  “The Xinhua report might indicate that there will be less
government intervention from now on,” said Wei Wei, an analyst
at West China Securities Co. in Shanghai. “That’ll damp
expectations that the government will bolster the market the
next time there are any big slumps.”  The CSRC has expanded foreign investor quotas to buy
stocks, cut trading fees and pushed companies to increase
dividends since Guo became chairman in 2011. The Shanghai index
fell in 2010 and 2011 before gaining 3.2 percent last year.  The gauge’s average trading volumes were 25 percent higher
than the 30-day average today. Its 30-day  volatility  was at
20.4, compared with last year’s average of 17.1.  A gauge of property stocks in the Shanghai Composite slid
1.4 percent today, the most among five industry groups. The
measure has rallied 21 percent since Dec. 3.  Poly Real Estate lost 2.1 percent to 13.68  yuan . The stock
had jumped 54 percent through yesterday since Aug. 29 on
expectations rising property sales will boost profit.  Consumer Staples  China Merchants Property Development Co. (000024) , the third
largest, lost 0.9 percent to 29.74 yuan. Gemdale Corp., the
fourth biggest, fell 1.3 percent to 6.81 yuan.  Tsingtao Brewery lost 1.2 percent to 33.53 yuan. The beer
industry may see more competition and overcapacity pressure in
2013, Citigroup said in a report dated yesterday.  Investors
should stay cautious on consumer-staples producers as “sector
growth is slowing,” Citigroup said.  Wuliangye Yibin Co., the nation’s second-largest liquor
maker, slid 1.7 percent to 26.36 yuan. Sichuan Swellfun Co., the
Chinese liquor maker that’s a partner of Diageo Plc, fell 2.7
percent to 18.39 yuan.  Citic Bank rose 3.1 percent to 4.68 yuan. Bank of Ningbo
Co., part-owned by  Singapore ’s Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp.,
jumped 6.2 percent to 11.48 yuan. Ping An Bank Co. gained 4
percent to 2048 yuan.  “The valuations of banking stocks are still low,” said
 Wang Zheng , the Shanghai-based chief investment officer at
Jingxi Investment Management Co., which manages $120 million.
“Lots of investors who missed out on the rally are buying
banking stocks, which have a valuation advantage.”  The 14 banks trading on the  Shanghai Stock Exchange  are
valued at an average of 6.5 times reported earnings, compared
with the multiple of 12.9 for the Shanghai Composite, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
