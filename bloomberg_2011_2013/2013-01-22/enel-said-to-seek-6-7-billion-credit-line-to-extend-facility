Enel SpA (ENEL) ,  Italy ’s biggest power
company, is seeking a 5 billion-euro ($6.7 billion) credit line
to extend a facility due in 2015, according to five people with
knowledge of the deal.  The company sent lenders a request last week for the five-
year loan, said the people, who asked not to be identified as
the terms are private. Banks have two weeks to commit to the
forward-start loan, locking in financing terms before the
existing debt matures, the people said.  Enel, based in Rome, is offering to pay initial interest of
195 basis points more than the euro interbank offered rate if it
uses the facility, two of the people said. The margin will rise
to 225 basis points if the  credit line  is fully drawn, they
said. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  The new loan will replace Enel’s 10 billion-euro revolving
credit facility maturing April 2015 that paid initial interest
of 85 basis points more than benchmarks, the people said. Under
a revolver, repaid money can be borrowed again.  A Rome-based spokeswoman for Enel declined to comment on
the transaction and asked not to be identified citing company
policy.  Enel has  ratings  of BBB+ from Standard & Poor’s and Fitch
Ratings, the third-lowest investment-grade ranking, and a Baa2
grade from Moody’s Investors Service.  To contact the reporter on this story:
