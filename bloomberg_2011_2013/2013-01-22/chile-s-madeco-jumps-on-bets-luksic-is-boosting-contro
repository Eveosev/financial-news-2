Madeco SA (MADECO) , the Chilean copper wire
producer, headed toward an eight-month high on speculation the
controlling Luksic family may be increasing its stake as the
company’s board considers a breakup.  Madeco advanced 3.8 percent to 20.5 pesos at 11:02 a.m. in
Santiago, the highest price on a closing basis since May. Traded
volume reached 674 million shares, 9.3 percent of the stock
outstanding, or about about 176 times the daily average over the
past three months.  “It may be that the Luksices are buying stocks from small-
cap funds before its planned split of the company,” German Guerrero, a partner at brokerage and asset management firm MBI
Servicios Financieros in Santiago, said in a phone interview.  Quinenco SA (QUINENC) , the holding company of the heirs of Andronico
Luksic, controls Santiago-based Madeco with a 55.4 percent
stake, according to Quinenco’s website. Pilar Rodriguez, an
investor relations officer at Quinenco, didn’t immediately
respond to a phone call seeking comment.  Madeco’s board has instructed management to begin studying
the steps required to separate the company into two, according
to a filing with regulators on Jan. 7. One part would contain
Madeco’s holding in French wire producer  Nexans SA. (NEX)  The second
would consist of interests in industrial units such as packaging
company Alusa SA and metal tubes producer Madeco Mills SA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
