Brazil ’s swap rates rose as a boost
in industrial confidence fueled speculation that the central
bank will increase borrowing costs this year.  Swap rates due in July 2014 climbed two basis points, or
0.02 percentage point, to 7.40 percent at 10:13 a.m. in Sao
Paulo after falling eight basis points yesterday, the most since
Dec. 6. The real fell 0.1 percent to 2.0433 per dollar.  The industrial confidence index increased to 106.6 in
January, the highest level since June 2011, the Getulio Vargas
Foundation reported today in a preview. Industrial capacity rose
to 84.5 percent.  “Swap rates are on the rise after there was an improvement
in industrial confidence and capacity,”  Luciano Rostagno , the
chief strategist at Banco WestLB do Brasil in Sao Paulo, said in
a phone interview. “There was also a jump in confidence in
 Germany , and if it is confirmed that the German economy is
improving, that will help the European recovery and favor growth
in Brazil.”  The ZEW Center for European Economic Research in Mannheim
said its German index of investor and analyst expectations
jumped to 31.5 this month from 6.9 in December. That is the
highest level since May 2010  To contact the reporters on this story:
