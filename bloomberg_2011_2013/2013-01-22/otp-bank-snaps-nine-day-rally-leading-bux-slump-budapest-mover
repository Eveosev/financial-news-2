OTP Bank Nyrt. (OTP) ,  Hungary ’s largest
lender, snapped a nine-day rally to drop the most in three
months on concern the central bank may deploy unconventional
methods for monetary easing under its next president.  The shares fell 3.1 percent to 4,549 forint by the close in
Budapest after advancing 11 percent in the past nine trading
sessions. The benchmark BUX stock  index  slid 2.3 percent, the
biggest slide on a closing basis since June and the worst
performance today among 94 indexes tracked by Bloomberg
worldwide.  Hungary’s government may nominate Economy Minister  Gyorgy
Matolcsy  to replace central bank President Andras Simor in
March, hvg.hu reported. Matolcsy has urged the bank to “bravely
use unorthodox tools” and follow the  European Central Bank  in
providing stimulus for the economy.  “The Hungarian market is among the worst performers partly
because of the rumors that the government plans to gobble up the
central bank,” Zsolt Balasy, a Budapest-based equities analyst
at Bayerische Landesbank’s MKB unit, said in a telephone
interview today.  A 19 percent rally in the past two months pushed OTP’s
 relative-strength index  as high as 81 yesterday, above the 70
level which indicates an excessive rally to some analysts. The
RSI last stood at 65.  “As soon as sentiment deteriorates slightly, there is a
correction in this stock,” Balasy said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
