Norfolk Southern Corp. (NSC) , the second-
largest U.S. eastern railroad, posted fourth-quarter profit that
topped analysts’ estimates as container-car shipments curbed the
effects of falling coal revenue.  Net income  dropped 14 percent to $413 million, or $1.30 a
share, from $480 million, or $1.42 a year earlier, the Norfolk,
Virginia-based company said today in a statement. That topped
the  average estimate  of $1.19 from 27 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg.  Profit at Norfolk Southern, which got 31 percent of its
2011 revenue from coal, has been pressured as utilities switch
to cheaper natural gas and the European economic slump trims
metallurgical exports. Coal cargoes at the largest North
American rail carriers fell about 14 percent in the quarter, and
11 percent at Norfolk Southern, according to data from the
Association of American Railroads.  “If you look outside of coal, they have shown very strong
growth,” Walter Spracklin, a Toronto-based analyst at Royal
Bank of Canada, said in a telephone interview. “Intermodal is a
bright star in Norfolk Southern’s portfolio.”  Revenue from coal in the fourth quarter dropped 23 percent
to $657 million, as coal carloads fell 13 percent, Norfolk
Southern said today. Container-shipment sales climbed 5 percent
to $584 million, while volumes rose 4 percent.  Total sales fell 4 percent to $2.68 billion, compared with
the average estimate from analysts of $2.67 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
