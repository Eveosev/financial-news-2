Tickets for the Super Bowl between the Baltimore Ravens and San Francisco 49ers are down almost 12 percent on the resale market from last year’s game to an average of $3,278.39, with suites priced at more than $300,000.  There are about 4,200 tickets on the secondary market for the Feb. 3 National Football League title game at the Superdome in New Orleans, according to ticket-aggregator  TiqIQ . The cheapest tickets are listed at $2,050, while a 30-person suite is going for $315,000.  The average price is 11.7 percent lower than listings at this date a year ago for the National Football League championship game between the New York Giants and the New England Patriots in Indianapolis, according to TiqIQ, with a final average price of $2,955.56. Company spokesman Chris Matcovich said today in an e-mail that prices typically drop on the secondary market as game-day approaches because brokers who bought tickets don’t want to get stuck with them.  “Unlike a regular-season game where a broker may eat a few hundred dollars a ticket if he or she can’t sell them, in terms of the Super Bowl every ticket is worth $850 or more, so they will be more willing to come down from their ask price as game approaches,” Matcovich said.  Face value for Super Bowl tickets is $850 to $1,250, NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy said today in an e-mail.  The 49ers rallied from a 17-point road deficit to beat the Atlanta Falcons 28-24 two days ago and secure their first berth in the league championship game since 1995. The Ravens return to the Super Bowl for the first time in 12 years after a 28-13 victory over the New England Patriots that evening.  Last Dance  The Super Bowl is set to be the last NFL game for Ravens linebacker Ray Lewis, a 13-time Pro Bowl selection who says he is retiring after 17 seasons. It also is the first time two brothers have coached against each other in the championship game -- 50-year-old John Harbaugh of the Ravens is 15 months older than Jim Harbaugh of the 49ers.  “I don’t know if we had a dream this big,” John Harbaugh said after the Ravens’ victory. “We’ll try to stay out of that business; we’ll let the two teams duke it out as much as possible.”  The Super Bowl between the Pittsburgh Steelers and Green Bay Packers after the 2010 season was the most expensive on the secondary market in the past five seasons, according to TiqIQ. That game had an final average ticket listing of $3,649.91, and a lowest price of $2,260.
