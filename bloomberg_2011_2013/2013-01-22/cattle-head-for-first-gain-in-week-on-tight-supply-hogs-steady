Cattle futures climbed for the first
time in more than a week on signs of tightening beef supplies.
Hog prices were little changed.  Japan  will allow imports of U.S. beef from cattle up to 30-
months old, up from 20 months, as early as Feb. 1, Health
Minister Norihisa Tamura told reporters in  Tokyo  today. The Food
Safety Commission recommended the change in October, saying it
wouldn’t increase health risks. Cargill Inc. said last week that
it will idle a beef-processing plant because of shrinking
supplies of animals.  There’s been a “double confirmation of tight beef
supplies,”  Dennis Smith , an analyst at Archer Financial
Services in Chicago, said in a telephone interview. “We had
confirmation from Cargill last week,” he said, followed by
Japan’s move, acknowledging “how tight beef supplies are going
to get this year.”  Cattle futures for April delivery rose 0.7 percent to
$1.307 a pound at 9:54 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
A gain today would be the first increase for the most-active
contract since Jan. 14.  Japan was the biggest buyer of U.S. beef before an outbreak
of mad cow disease in 2003. It lifted a two-year ban in 2005
that was imposed to safeguard against the brain-wasting ailment.  Feeder-cattle futures for March settlement increased 0.4
percent to $1.4695 a pound on the CME.  Hog futures for April settlement added 0.1 percent to 88.2
cents a pound in  Chicago .  -- With assistance from Aya Takada and Yasumasa Song in Tokyo.
