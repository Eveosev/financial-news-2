French cyclist Steve Houanard has
been suspended for two years after testing positive for the
banned substance  Erythropoietin, or EPO, the  International
Cycling Union  said.  The 26-year-old Ag2r-La Mondiale rider tested positive for
the endurance-boosting drug during an out-of-competition test in
September, the UCI said in an e-mailed statement today. Houanard
has accepted his suspension, it said.  The UCI further said it has asked the Belgian National
Cycling Federation RLVB to start a “disciplinary procedure”
against rider Leif Hoste for a violation of anti-doping rules on
the basis of his blood profile in his biological passport.  To contact the reporter on this story:
