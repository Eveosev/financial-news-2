Centro Retail Australia (CRF)  shareholders
today approved a plan to change the mall operator’s name to
Federation Centres.  About 99.8 percent of investor votes cast at a special
meeting today were in favor of the change, the Melbourne-based
group said in regulatory filing. The corporate re-branding cost
is about A$1.5 million ($1.58 million) and the cost to replace
signage at the group’s malls is about A$7.5 million, it said.  The change follows the restructure of debt-laden  Centro
Properties Group  and its managed funds that allowed the company
to erase A$2.9 billion of loans accumulated during a U.S. buying
spree in 2006 and 2007. The company has sold off its overseas
assets, settled a class action lawsuit by investors, and reduced
and refinanced debt.  “It is now time to draw a defining line on the past to
clearly identify it from our future,” Chairman Bob Edgar said
in the statement. “Our vision is to be a pure property REIT
with a simplified structure –- a shopping center owner and
manager in the Australian market.”  The company will rebrand 24 malls by December and the rest
of its shopping centers over the next two years, it said.  Centro  shares  rose 32 percent in 2012, and have fallen 0.9
percent to A$2.25 this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
