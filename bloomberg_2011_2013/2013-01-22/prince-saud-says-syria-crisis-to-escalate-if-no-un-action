The  United Nations  must act to end
violence in Syria, where President Bashar al-Assad’s actions
make negotiations impossible, Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal said.  “Damascus was carpet bombed,” Prince Saud said in Riyadh
today, when asked if  Saudi Arabia  is pushing for talks between
the main rebel group, the National Coalition of Syrian
Revolutionary and Opposition Forces, and Assad’s government.
“How can we conceive of the possibility of a negotiated
solution with someone who does that to his own country, his own
people, his own history?”  The General Assembly must get involved if the Security
Council continues to fail to muster enough support to intervene,
Prince Saud said.  Russia and  China  blocked two  Security Council  resolutions
to force an end to the civil war, which began in March 2011 and
has claimed the lives of at least 60,000 people as fighting
increasingly splits Syria along sectarian lines.  Saudi Arabia, a Sunni Muslim monarchy, is among countries
that have recognized the main Syrian opposition fighting to oust
Assad, whose core support is among Syrians from the Alawite
community affiliated with Shiite Islam.  In December, the U.S. Defense Department said the Assad
government appeared to be starting to use its arsenal of Scud
ballistic missiles. A month later, an analysis by the UN showed
an increase in the average number of documented deaths to 5,000
a month since July 2012, from around 1,000 a month previously.  To contact the reporters on this story:
