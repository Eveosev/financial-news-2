U.K. stocks  erased their decline as
investors awaited a U.S. house-sales report and earnings from
Google Inc. and Johnson & Johnson.  Ocado Group Plc (OCDO)  surged 5 percent after saying  Stuart Rose 
will take over as the online grocer’s chairman.  Rightmove Plc (RMV) 
rose 2.6 percent after UBS AG upgraded the shares.  The FTSE 100 gained 2.34 points, or less than 0.1 percent,
to 6,183.32 at 10:26 a.m. in London, erasing a tumble of 0.5
percent. The equity benchmark has  gained 4.8 percent  so far this
year as U.S. lawmakers agreed on a compromise budget. The
broader FTSE All-Share Index was unchanged today, while
Ireland’s ISEQ Index added 0.2 percent.  Britain’s cold snap risks pushing the economy into a
triple-dip recession as Bank of England Governor  Mervyn King 
completes his final months in office. Heavy snow affecting most
of the country threatens to hurt retail sales and construction.
 Economists already forecast  that gross domestic product shrank
in the final three months of 2012. King, who steps down in July,
may give his outlook for the economy when he delivers his first
speech of 2013 to businessmen in Belfast this evening.  In Asia, the Bank of Japan set a 2 percent inflation target
and said it will introduce Federal Reserve-style open-ended
asset purchases in its strongest commitment yet to ending two
decades of deflation.  In the U.S.,  sales  of existing houses climbed 1.2 percent
to a 5.1 million annual rate last month, the most since November
2009, according to the  median estimate of economists  surveyed by
Bloomberg. The National Association of Realtors publishes the
figures at 10 a.m. New York time. A report on Jan. 25 may show
that new-house sales rose to a 385,000 annual pace, the largest
number since April 2010.  Fresnillo Plc (FRES) , the world’s biggest primary silver producer,
led a gauge of European mining companies lower, falling 2.7
percent to 1,727 pence.  To contact the reporter on this story:
