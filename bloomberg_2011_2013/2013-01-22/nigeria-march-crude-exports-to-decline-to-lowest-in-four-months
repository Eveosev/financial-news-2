Nigeria ,  Africa â€™s largest oil
producer, will reduce crude exports in March to the least in
four months, according to preliminary loading programs obtained
by  Bloomberg News .  Daily exports are scheduled to be 2.05 million barrels
compared with 2.16 million in February, according to the plans.
The African nation will ship 69 cargoes in March, totaling 63.57
million barrels, the schedule showed. That compares with 65
lots, or 59.49 million barrels, due to be shipped next month.  The country will export 12 consignments of its benchmark
Qua Iboe grade in March, two more than a revised schedule for
next month, according to the program. The total includes three
lots that were deferred from February. Exports of Bonny Light
blend will fall by two to five cargoes.  Nigeria will also ship eight cargoes of Forcados, seven of
Agbami, five each of Akpo and Bonga, four of Brass River, three
lots of Amenam, Erha, Escravos and Usan, two each of Antan, EA
Blend, Okono and Yoho and one lot each of Abo, Okwori and
Pennington, the plans showed.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
