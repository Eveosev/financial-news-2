European Union pig prices were
stable following a decline last week as slaughterers reduced a
meat surplus, according to industry group Interessengemeinschaft
der Schweinehalter Deutschlands e.V.  Hog prices in  Germany , the EU’s biggest producer, were
unchanged at 1.596 euros ($2.12) a kilogram (2.2 pounds), Damme,
Germany-based ISN wrote in an online  report  today. That’s after
prices dropped last week from 1.626 euros.  Pork accounts for about half of the meat consumption in the
EU. Per-capita consumption of pork in the 27-nation bloc is set
to fall to 40.26 kilograms this year from 41.15 kilograms in
2012 due to the economic downturn and high levels of
unemployment, the EU forecast last week.  “With the onset of winter, the slaughter-pig prices in
 Europe  are stabilizing,” ISN wrote. “The overhang built up
over the year-end is now finally reduced and slaughter-pig
prices can finally hold their ground.”  Spanish, Dutch, Belgian and Austrian pig prices were also
unchanged, while in Denmark the price of a kilogram of pork
climbed a 10th of a cent to 1.657 euros, ISN said. French prices
fell to 1.58 euros a kilogram from 1.603 euros.  “In  France , the price listing has for a long time defied
the European trend toward weakness and now has succumbed,
because demand is too weak in comparison with the available
supply,” ISN wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
