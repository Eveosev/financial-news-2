South Korea’s won erased losses,
rebounding from this month’s low, as the yen strengthened after
the  Bank of Japan (8301)  said it will wait until next year to begin
open-ended asset purchases. Government bonds rose.  Japan’s central bank adopted a 2 percent inflation target
after its policy meeting today and said it will buy 13 trillion
yen ($145 billion) of assets a month from January 2014 to lift
the economy out of deflation. The won earlier fell to this
month’s low as global funds sold more Korean equities than they
bought and Finance Minister Bahk Jae Wan said today currency
appreciation could hurt exporters such as automakers.  “The detail of the BOJ easing is a little underwhelming in
terms of the timing and quantum, which led to some corrections
in the dollar-yen and won levels,” said Sim Moh Siong, a
currency strategist at Bank of Singapore Ltd. “The won today
reflects adjustments to market positions, and may not be related
to fundamentals.”  The won closed at 1,062.30 per dollar, little changed from
1,062.88 yesterday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It
dropped as much as 0.5 percent to 1,066.77, the weakest since
Dec. 31. The currency touched 1,054.49 on Jan. 15, a level not
seen since August 2011, after rallying 8.3 percent in 2012.  Before today’s meeting, the yen had lost 6 percent against
the dollar in the past month amid speculation that the BOJ would
unveil a new round of asset purchases to drag  Japan ’s economy
out of its third recession since 2008.  Most Vulnerable  “The market is watching the dollar-yen movement and if it
worsens, the situation for Korean carmakers will deteriorate,”
said Lee Jin-Ill, a currency trader in  Seoul  at Hana Bank. “The
central bank tries to intervene at 1,055.”  The won’s near-term appreciation may be limited by the hit
to the nation’s export competitiveness as the yen slumps,
Barclays Plc said in a report on Jan. 17. The won is “the most
susceptible” to yen weakness versus its regional peers and
risks central bank intervention, the bank said.  The won fell 0.6 percent yesterday, the biggest loss since
Sept. 20, as foreign investors pared their stock holdings. Net
sales totaled $169 million yesterday and $466 million last week,
exchange data show.  Higher Volatility  One-month implied volatility in the won, a gauge of
expected moves in exchange rates used to price options, jumped
40 basis points, or 0.40 percentage point, to 5.90 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It touched 6.05
percent, the highest since Nov. 16.  Bahk said today the won’s volatility will affect earnings
forecasts by local automakers. The government will increase
financial support for small- to mid-sized companies to hedge
their currency risks, the ministry said in a statement.  South Korea is studying various measures to reduce
volatility in capital flows and currency movements, Vice Finance
Minister Shin Je Yoon said Jan. 16. Central bank Governor Kim
Choong Soo said Jan. 14 the nation will take an “active”
response on the won if needed.  The yield on South Korea’s 2.75 percent bonds due September
2017 dropped one basis point to 2.84 percent, Korea Exchange
