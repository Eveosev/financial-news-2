The European Agency for the
Cooperation of Energy Regulators picked software from  Nasdaq OMX
Group Inc. (NDAQ) , as it gears up to oversee wholesale gas and
electricity trading in the European Union.  The SMARTS surveillance platform can be used to detect
insider trading and market manipulation and will help enforce EU
energy market regulations, New York-based Nasdaq OMX said in an
e-mailed statement on Jan. 18. No commercial details of the
agreement were disclosed.  “The technology helps to identify and assess suspicious
patterns of behavior,” Paul McKeown, vice president of market
technology at Nasdaq OMX, said by phone from  New York  on Jan.
18. The  platform  can “break down all orders and transactions to
find out what was done, when was it done and who did it.”  The regulators’ group, known as ACER, is tasked with
safeguarding integrity and transparency of the market and
detecting  insider trading  and market manipulation. The agency
will next year gain access to all transactions in spot and
derivatives products for power and gas from all EU trading
venues and bilateral transactions, under strengthened monitoring
powers defined under the EU regulation on energy market
integrity and transparency, called  Remit .  The Nasdaq OMX software is already used in the Nordic
wholesale power market, as well as by financial regulators and
stock exchanges worldwide, Volker Zuleger, ACER’s head of market
monitoring department, said yesterday by phone from Ljubljana,
Slovenia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
