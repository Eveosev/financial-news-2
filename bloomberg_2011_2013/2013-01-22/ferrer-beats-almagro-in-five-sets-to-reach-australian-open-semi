No. 4 seed  David Ferrer  fought back
from two sets down to beat Nicolas Almagro and reach his second
Australian Open tennis semifinal.  Ferrer defeated his fellow Spaniard 4-6, 4-6, 7-5, 7-6
(7-4), 6-2 at Rod Laver Arena in Melbourne to lift his record
against Almagro to 13-0. Tenth-seeded Almagro served for the
match three times as Ferrer completed the fourth comeback from
2-0 down of his career.    Ferrer, who led the men’s tour with seven tournament
victories in 2012 and tuned up for Melbourne Park by defending
his Auckland title, will face top-seeded Novak Djokovic of
Serbia or Tomas Berdych of the Czech Republic for a place in the
Jan. 27 men’s final.  Li Na , the No. 6 seed from China, earlier became the first
woman to reach the final four by ending fourth-seeded Agnieszka Radwanska’s 13-match winning run in 2013 with a 7-5, 6-3
victory. She’ll meet the winner of today’s all-Russian
quarterfinal matchup between No. 2 seed  Maria Sharapova  and
Ekaterina Makarova.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
