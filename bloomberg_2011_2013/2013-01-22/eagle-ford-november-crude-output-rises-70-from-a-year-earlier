EOG Resources Inc. (EOG)  and other
drillers increased production in November by 70 percent from a
year earlier in South Texas’s Eagle Ford shale formation.  The nine geographic fields that make up the majority of the
play yielded 358,826 barrels of crude a day, according to
preliminary data released yesterday from the  Texas Railroad
Commission , which oversees oil and gas drilling. Daily output
was 211,333 barrels in November 2011.  The production totals typically increase as the state
receives revised, corrected or late reports. October production
increased to 376,123 barrels a day from the initial estimate of
323,098 barrels last month.  EOG is the largest leaseholder in the Eagle Ford play, with
644,000 net acres.  Chesapeake Energy Corp. (CHK)  is next with 490,000,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Growing production out of Eagle Ford is helping fuel a
renaissance in Texas crude. The  state  produced 2.1 million
barrels a day in October, the highest monthly level since April
1987, according to the U.S. Energy Department’s Energy
Information Administration.  Plains Marketing LP’s  posted price  for Eagle Ford oil today
was $108.53 a barrel, between today’s benchmark settlement
prices of $96.24 for West Texas Intermediate and $112.42 for
Brent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
