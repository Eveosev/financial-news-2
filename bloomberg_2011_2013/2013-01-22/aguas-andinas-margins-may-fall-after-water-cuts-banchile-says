Aguas Andinas SA (AGUAS/A) ,  Chile ’s largest
publicly traded water utility, may experience margin pressures
in the first quarter after a mudslide caused by heavy rain
forced the company to cut service to clients in the capital.  Aguas Andinas suspended operations at three plants that
provide drinking water for 33 percent of its customers including
homes and businesses after a mudslide on the Maipo River
yesterday near Santiago made the water too murky to be filtered,
Banchile Inversiones said in an e-mailed note.  The rest of Aguas Andinas’ clients will have to be serviced
through emergency wells and water tanks, which will increase
costs, Banchile said in today’s note.  “We can’t rule out some downward pressure on the stock,”
Banchile said. Aguas Andinas series A  shares  declined for a
second day and were down 0.1 percent to 346 pesos at 1 p.m. in
Santiago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
