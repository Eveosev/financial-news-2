The  yuan  in Hong Kong declined to
the lowest in more than a week on speculation  China ’s plans to
increase the frequency of money-market operations spurred demand
for dollars.  Premier Wen Jiabao urged gradual yuan capital account
convertibility, China National Radio reported yesterday. The
People’s Bank of China said on Jan. 18 it will start daily
short-term liquidity operations, the so-called SLOs involving
contracts maturing in less than seven days, as additional tools
to manage cash supply.  Wen’s call complements the PBOC’s plans for more frequent
money-market operations, which will reduce spikes in short-term
rates and lower their average levels, said Darius Kowalczyk, a
Hong Kong-based strategist at Credit Agricole CIB. “This would
reduce the support for onshore and offshore yuan spot from rate
differentials.”  The currency slid 0.04 percent to 6.1975 per dollar as of
10:12 a.m. in Hong Kong’s offshore market, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. It touched 6.1985, the weakest level since Jan.
11. Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards were little changed at
6.2813, a 1 percent discount to the onshore spot rate.  In  Shanghai , the yuan traded at 6.2211 per dollar, little
changed from yesterday’s close of 6.2213, according to the China
Foreign Exchange Trade System. The People’s Bank of China set
the  reference rate  0.01 percent weaker at 6.2796 per dollar
today. The spot is allowed to trade as much as 1 percent on
either side of the central bank’s fixing.  “Any correction in the Chinese foreign-exchange spot
market should be viewed as a buying opportunity,” Kowalczyk
said.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves
in exchange rates used to price options, was steady at a three-
month low of 1.35 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
