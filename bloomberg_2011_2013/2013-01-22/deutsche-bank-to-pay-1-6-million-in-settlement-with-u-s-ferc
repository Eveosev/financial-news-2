Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  will pay $1.6
million to resolve a dispute with the  Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission , averting a legal showdown with the U.S. agency that
said a unit manipulated California’s power markets in 2010.  The bank within 10 days will pay a $1.5 million civil
penalty and hand over $172,645 in profits, plus interest --
similar to what the agency proposed last year -- the FERC said
in a statement today.  The Frankfurt-based bank didn’t admit or deny the
violations, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
