CIC Insurance Group Ltd. (CIC) ,  Kenya ’s
second-biggest insurer by premiums, jumped to the highest in
more than four months amid speculation investments in real
estate will boost income.  The shares climbed 1.3 percent to 4 shillings by the close
in the capital, Nairobi, the highest level since Sept. 10. About
144 percent of the three-month average volume of shares traded,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  CIC is in the process of acquiring 417 acres of land for
723 million shillings ($8.28 million) in Isinya, Kenya, as part
of a plan to diversify, it said Jan. 10.  “We saw an increase in local investor interest after they
announced the company intends to acquire some land,” Moses Waireri, a research analyst at Nairobi-based Genghis Capital,
said in a phone interview today. “We believe that the outlook
for the real estate sector in 2013 remains good.”  CIC shares have jumped 13 percent this year, outpacing the
10 percent advance on the  Nairobi Securities Exchange All-Share
Index. (NSEASI)   To contact the reporter on this story:
