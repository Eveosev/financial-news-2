Barclays Plc (BARC) , Britain’s second-
largest bank, has started to consult with 9,000 U.K. employees
as it prepares to eliminate jobs at its investment bank.  The bank sent a memorandum to employees today, a London-
based spokesman said. This “exercise is being carried out so
that we can start to effect some of the strategic changes”
whose results will be announced on Feb.12, the London-based bank
said in a statement today.  Barclays Chief Executive Officer  Antony Jenkins  is
overhauling the culture at the bank and focusing on more
profitable businesses amid tougher capital requirements and
banking scandals.  The bank  was fined a record 290 million pounds
($460 million) in June for manipulating Libor, leading to the
resignations of its former CEO, chairman and chief operating
officer.  Investment-banking head  Rich Ricci  has said the bank would
review products and services that could harm the bank’s
reputation. He cited parts of the bank’s tax advisory business
and the sale of structured products to small-and medium-sized
businesses.  Sky News reported the consultation earlier today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
