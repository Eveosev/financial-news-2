Iran  and world powers can’t agree on
a venue for this month’s planned negotiations over the Iranian
nuclear program, according to Russian Deputy Foreign Minister
Mikhail Bogdanov.  “We’ve more or less agreed on the timing but there are
different opinions about the location,” Bogdanov told reporters
outside Moscow today.  The venue for the negotiations must be decided early this
week to avoid postponement, Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said Jan. 18.  Russia is part of the so-called P5+1 group along with
China, France, Germany, U.K. and U.S, which is negotiating with
Iran over its nuclear activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
