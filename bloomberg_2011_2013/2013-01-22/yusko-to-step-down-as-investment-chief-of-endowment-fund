Mark Yusko said he’s stepping down
as chief investment officer of the $3.5 billion Endowment Fund,
citing management differences with Salient Partners LP,
according to a letter sent to clients.  The fund is managed by a joint venture of Houston-based
Salient, which handles marketing, and Yusko’s Morgan Creek
Capital Management LLC, based in Chapel Hill,  North Carolina ,
which oversees the assets. The fund mimics the strategies of big
endowments such as those at  Yale University  and the Ford
Foundation, using investments in hedge funds, private equity and
real estate to augment stock and bond holdings.  “After nearly a decade of working with our joint venture
partner in Texas, we found ourselves differing on material
aspects of how to best run an Endowment portfolio and run the
business, so we decided that a change was appropriate,” Yusko
wrote in the letter, a copy of which was obtained by  Bloomberg
News .  Salient said in October that it would limit withdrawals to
5 percent of assets as of Dec. 31, after clients pulled more
than $1 billion during 2012 amid lackluster returns.  Yusko, 49, couldn’t immediately be reached for comment.
Chris Moon, a spokeswoman for Salient, didn’t immediately return
a phone call seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
