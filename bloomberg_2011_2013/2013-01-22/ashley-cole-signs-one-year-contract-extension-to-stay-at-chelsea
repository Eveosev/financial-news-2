Chelsea defender  Ashley Cole  signed
a one-year contract extension to stay with the Premier League
soccer club through the end of next season.  Chelsea didn’t disclose financial terms of the agreement on
its website. The Daily Mail reported it’s worth almost 200,000
pounds ($317,000) per week, making Cole the world’s highest-paid
defender. The 32-year-old had drawn interest from Real Madrid,
Paris Saint-Germain and  Manchester United  with his current
contract due to expire at the end of this season, the Mail said.  Cole has spent seven seasons at Chelsea, after signing from
Arsenal, winning the  Champions League , Premier League and the
League Cup. He’s also captured four F.A. Cup titles with the
Blues, giving him a record seven in total.  “Being here for seven years and being at Arsenal before
that playing for trophies, you never lose that hunger,” Cole
said. “I wanted to stay at Chelsea because we are always
fighting and challenging for trophies. That desire and the will
to want to win things have not gone.”  Cole has scored seven goals in 293 appearances for Chelsea
and has twice been voted the club’s player of the year by his
teammates. He’s also played 99 times for England to set a
national record for a fullback.  To contact the reporter on this story:
