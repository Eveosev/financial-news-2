The death toll from an outbreak of
the H1N1 virus in the West Bank and  Gaza Strip  has risen to 21,
all the victims children or elderly people.  Since the beginning of winter, 19 people have died in the
West Bank and two in Gaza, Dr. Asad Rimlawi, director of public
health at the Palestinian Ministry of Health in the West Bank,
said in a telephone interview.  A total of 640 people have been infected by the virus, also
known as Swine Flu, Rimlawi said. Authorities are promoting the
use of vaccinations and general community awareness, he added.  Gregory Hartl , spokesman for the  World Health Organization ,
said that outbreaks of flu during colder months are not unusual.  “It’s the northern hemisphere, it is winter so there will
be flu,” he said in a telephone interview. “Which specific
virus causes the most illness varies from year to year, but
certainly H1N1 is now a seasonal influenza virus and we expect
it to cause illness.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
