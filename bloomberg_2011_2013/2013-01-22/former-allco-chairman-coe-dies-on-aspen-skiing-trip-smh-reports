David Coe, who led  Allco Finance
Group  in a failed bid for  Qantas Airways Ltd. (QAN)  before the asset
management firm collapsed during the global financial crisis,
has died, the Sydney Morning Herald reported.  Coe, 58, died of a suspected heart attack during a skiing
trip in Aspen, Colorado, the newspaper  reported , citing three
friends and colleagues of Allcoâ€™s former executive chairman.  Allco, part of a group that bid unsuccessfully for Qantas
in 2007, handed operations to outside managers in November 2008
after breaching loan obligations. Creditors decided to wind up
the firm in May 2009.  Allco had borrowed to buy assets such as wind farms and
aircraft, emulating a model pioneered by  Macquarie Group Ltd. (MQG) 
The strategy backfired in 2008, as debt markets seized up and
bankers forced it to sell holdings as prices slumped.  Coe is survived by his wife Michelle and three sons, the
Morning Herald said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
