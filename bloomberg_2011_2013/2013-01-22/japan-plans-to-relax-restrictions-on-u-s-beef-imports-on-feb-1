Japan  will ease restrictions on U.S.
beef imports next month, boosting supplies to restaurant chains
such as  Yoshinoya Holdings Co. (9861) , after food safety authorities
said the change wouldn’t increase health risks.  “We will implement the relaxation as early as Feb. 1”
after explaining the decision to the public, Health Minister
Norihisa Tamura told reporters in  Tokyo  today. The Food Safety
Commission recommended the change in October.  Japan, the biggest buyer of American beef before an
outbreak of mad-cow disease in 2003, will allow imports of beef
from cattle up to 30-months old, from 20 months previously. It
lifted a two-year ban in 2005 that was imposed to safeguard
against the brain-wasting disease.  The new rule will widen opportunities for U.S. shippers
such as  Tyson Foods Inc. (TSN)  and Cargill Inc. Beef, along with auto
and insurance, is a sector the U.S. asked Japan to reform before
joining negotiations over the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade
pact.  Yoshinoya suspended sales of its popular “gyudon” beef
bowl during the ban. Lighter restrictions will increase beef
supply and may reduce purchasing costs for Japanese retailers,
according to Susumu Harada, senior director at the Tokyo office
of U.S. Meat Export Federation.  Yoshinoya shares gained 0.3 percent to 107,800 yen ($1,205)
at the 11:30 a.m. break in Tokyo.  The U.S. was the largest exporter to Japan after  Australia 
in 2003, supplying 267,583 metric tons worth 128.5 billion yen,
according to data from the agriculture ministry. Tyson,  JBS SA (JBSS3) ,
Cargill Inc. and National Beef Inc. are the biggest U.S. beef
suppliers to Japan, according to the federation.  In the first half of 2012, Japan purchased 56,887 tons of
U.S. beef, 10 percent more than a year earlier. Total imports
amounted to 240,815 tons, of which 64 percent was from
Australia.  To contact the reporters on this story:
