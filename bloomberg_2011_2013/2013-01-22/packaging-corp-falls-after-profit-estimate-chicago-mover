Packaging Corp. of America , the
fourth-largest U.S. maker of corrugated shipping boxes, fell the
most in more than a year after forecasting first-quarter profit
will be less than analysts expect.  Packaging Corp. fell 3.5 percent to $38.61 at 12:21 p.m. in
 New York . Earlier the shares dropped 5.4 percent, the biggest
intraday decline since Sept. 22, 2011.  First-quarter profit will be about 56 cents a share, the
 Lake Forest , Illinois-based company said in a statement today.
That compares with the 63-cent average  estimate  of eight
analysts compiled by Bloomberg.  “We expect lower containerboard production and higher
operating costs compared to the fourth quarter with two less
mill production days and annual maintenance downtime,” Chief
Executive Officer Mark Kowlzan said in the statement.  The company today said fourth-quarter net income rose to
$61 million, or 63 cents a share, from $39.5 million, or 40
cents, driven by higher prices for container board and
corrugated packaging. Profit excluding a gain of $3 million from
state income tax adjustments and other one-time items missed by
a penny the 62-cent  average  of 12 estimates compiled by
Bloomberg.  Packaging Corp. is the fourth-largest U.S. producer of
corrugated shipping boxes after  International Paper Co. (IP) ,  Rock-
Tenn Co. (RKT)  and closely held Georgia-Pacific LLC, according to an
investor presentation on Rock-Tenn’s  website . Container board is
the specialized paper used to make corrugated shipping boxes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
