Brent crude  advanced to the highest
level in more than a week as  Japan ’s central bank said it will
expand asset purchases to lift the world’s third-biggest oil
consumer out of the recession.  Futures rose as much as 0.7 percent to the highest since
Jan. 10. The  Bank of Japan (8301)  will introduce open-ended asset
purchases from January 2014 to boost the economy. Euro-area
finance ministers yesterday approved a payout of 9.2 billion
euros ($12.3 billion) to Greece this month.  “Expectations for stimulus in Japan have been propping up
markets in otherwise thin trading,” said  Andrey Kryuchenkov , an
analyst at VTB Capital in London who predicts Brent may find
resistance at $112.50 a barrel this month.  Brent for March settlement climbed as much as 77 cents to
$112.48 a barrel, and traded for $112.11 as of 1:21 p.m. on the
ICE Futures Europe exchange in London. The average volume of all
contracts was 17 percent higher than the 100-day average. The
benchmark was at a premium of $16.08 to New York crude futures.
The spread was $15.16 on Jan. 17, the narrowest level based on
closing prices since July 24.  West Texas Intermediate for February delivery, which
expires today, was at $95.53 a barrel, down 3 cents, in
electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . The more
active March contract was at $95.95. Yesterday’s transactions
will be booked with today’s trades for settlement purposes as
there was no floor trading because of the  Martin Luther King Jr .
Day holiday in the U.S.  Brent Forecast  Brent is forecast to trade from $107 to $118 a barrel in
the first quarter of this year, barring unexpected supply
disruptions in North Africa and Syria,  Gordon Kwan , the head of
research at Mirae Asset Securities Hong Kong Ltd., said in a
report dated today.  The BOJ will purchase about 13 trillion yen ($145 billion)
of assets per month while setting a 2 percent inflation target,
the bank said in Tokyo today. The nation hasn’t had sustained
price gains of that size in two decades. Japan accounted for 5
percent of global crude demand in 2011, according to  BP Plc (BP/) ’s
Statistical Review of World Energy. The U.S. consumed 21 percent
and  China  used 11 percent.  Quantitative-easing programs by the BOJ are “a short- to
medium-term plus for world growth and commodities, including
oil,” said Ric Spooner, a chief market analyst at CMC Markets
in Sydney. “The broad view with Europe is that the immediate
risks that were before us in the middle of last year have been
removed now that  Greece  has been given liquidity support.”  Oil’s advance in New York may stall as a technical
indicator shows futures have climbed too quickly for further
gains to be sustainable. The 14-day relative strength index is
above 71 for a third day, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. A reading higher than 70 signals a market is
overbought and may drop.  Libya Output  WTI declined 7.1 percent in 2012 as the U.S. shale boom
deepened a supply glut at Cushing,  Oklahoma , America’s largest
storage hub and the delivery point for New York futures. That
left it at an average discount of $17.47 a barrel to Brent last
year, compared with a premium of about 7 cents in the five years
through 2010. Brent, the benchmark grade for more than half the
world’s crude, advanced 3.5 percent last year.  Libya , which holds Africa’s biggest crude reserves, is
pumping 1.1 million barrels a day and is targeting output of 1.7
million barrels, Oil Minister Abdulbari Al-Arusi said in an
interview in Tripoli yesterday. The country’s daily output may
rise to 2 million barrels in two years, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
