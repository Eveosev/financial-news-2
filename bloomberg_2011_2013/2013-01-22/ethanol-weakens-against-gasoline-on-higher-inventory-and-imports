Ethanol’s discount to gasoline
widened to the largest gap in more than a week on ample
stockpiles and higher imports for the fuel additive.  The spread swelled 1.41 cents as gasoline surged on
speculation that refinery repairs will reduce inventories.
Ethanol  stockpiles  in the week ended Jan. 11 were 20.4 million
barrels, up 4.2 percent from a year earlier, while  imports 
averaged 27,000 barrels a day, compared with none a year ago,
the Energy Information Administration said.  ‘Gasoline won’t hold ethanol up, it’s more from corn,’’
said Peyton Feltus, president of Randolph Risk Management Inc.
in  Dallas . “While ethanol is closely related to gasoline, it’s
born of corn.”  The grain-based additive was 43.59 cents cheaper than
gasoline, based on prompt-month settlement prices for both
commodities, the highest level since Jan. 11. The spread was
42.18 cents Jan. 18.  Denatured ethanol for February delivery advanced 1.9 cents,
or 0.8 percent, to $2.394 a gallon on the Chicago Board of
Trade, the highest level since Dec. 6. Prices have advanced 12
percent in the past year.  In cash market trading, ethanol on the West Coast jumped 9
cents, or 3.7 percent, to $2.555 a gallon and in the U.S. Gulf
the additive increased 6 cents, or 2.5 percent, to $2.455, data
compiled by Bloomberg shows.  Spot Prices  Chicago  ethanol gained 4.5 cents, or 1.9 percent, to $2.39
a gallon and in New York the biofuel rose 1 cent to $2.455.  Gasoline for February delivery climbed 3.31 cents, or 1.2
percent, to $2.8299 a gallon on the New York Mercantile
Exchange.  Corn for March delivery gained 1 cent to $7.285 a bushel in
Chicago. One bushel makes at least 2.75 gallons of ethanol.  U.S. ethanol makers have tempered production in the face of
higher corn prices caused by drought and the supply glut.  Output in the week ended Jan. 11 fell to 784,000 barrels a
day, the lowest since the U.S. Energy Department’s statistical
unit began tracking weekly data in June 2010.  Aemetis Inc. (AMTX) , a U.S. ethanol producer, idled production at
its plant in Keyes,  California , citing “unprofitable market
conditions for corn ethanol,” and will upgrade the operation to
make fuel from sorghum as well, it said today.  Abengoa SA (ABG) , a Spanish engineering and renewable energy
company, said Jan. 16 it halted output at ethanol mills in York
and Ravenna,  Nebraska , until market conditions improve.  To contact the reporter on this story:
