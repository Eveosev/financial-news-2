Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  said 36 of its new
warrants and nine discount certificates will start trading on
the  Istanbul Stock Exchange  tomorrow.  Deutsche Bank will have a total of 142 warrants and 24
discount certificates trading on the exchange with the new
additions, Albert Krespin, chief executive officer of the
lender’s Istanbul-based brokerage unit, said by e-mail today.
Some of the discount certificates will be based on the shares of
 Turkiye Vakiflar Bankasi TAO (VAKBN) , Turkey’s third-largest state
lender, he said.  A warrant is a tradable certificate representing an option
to buy shares at a specific price before a predetermined date.
Discount certificates enable the investor to acquire an
underlying instrument at a discount to the direct investment.  Warrants started trading on the Turkish exchange in 2010,
and their volume rose to 3 billion liras ($1.7 billion) last
year from 2.8 billion liras in 2011, according to data on the
exchange  website .  Total warrants issued amounted to 40 million liras at end-
October 2012, according to the  Capital Markets Board.  Currently
only Deutsche Securities and Is Invest,  Turkey ’s largest
brokerage by trading volume, issue warrants on the exchange.
Erste Group Bank AG started issuing turbo certificates last
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
