The global surplus for natural
rubber may shrink this year and next from a record in 2012
because of rising demand in the U.S. and in  China , the biggest
consumer, according to the  International Rubber Study Group .  Production is set to outpace consumption by 179,000 metric
tons this year and 153,000 tons in 2014, said senior economist
Lekshmi Nair, who estimates last year’s glut at 460,000 tons.
The Singapore-based IRSG is an inter-governmental group of 35
producing and consuming nations and 120 industry members.  Rubber, used in tires and gloves, surged 51 percent from a
three-year intraday low in August as growth in China accelerated
last quarter for the first time in two years and U.S. housing
starts jumped to a four-year high in December. Thailand,
Indonesia and  Malaysia , the biggest shippers, agreed in August
to limit exports to boost prices, increasing costs for
tiremakers such as  Bridgestone Corp. (5108) , the world’s largest.  “Continued expansion in Asia, especially in China, will
drive prices higher,” said Prachaya Jumpasut, managing director
of The Rubber Economist in  London , who has studied the commodity
for more than 30 years.  Rubber for delivery in June lost 0.3 percent to 310.3 yen a
kilogram ($3,499 a metric ton) on the Tokyo Commodity Exchange
by 12:42 p.m. local time. Futures dropped to 205.6 yen on Aug.
14, the lowest since October 2009.  Demand in China may rise 7.2 percent this year after
growing 4.5 percent in 2012, according to IRSG. Consumption in
the U.S. will expand 4.5 percent after contracting 6.3 percent
last year, the group estimates.  ‘Pent-up Demand’  Imports by  India , the second-biggest user, will decline in
January and February because of a drop in domestic prices and a
slowdown in the automobile industry, Niraj Thakkar, president of
the All India Rubber Industries Association, said yesterday.
Still total purchases will be 10 percent to 15 percent higher in
2012-2013 ending March 31 from a year earlier, he said.  “Consumption is recovering because of pent-up demand”
from last year when growth stagnated, said Nair in a phone
interview yesterday. “That will help narrow the surplus.”  Global demand and production have climbed every year to
record levels since 2010, according to IRSG. Consumption will
increase to 11.6 million tons this year and to 12.3 million tons
in 2014, the group estimates. Production will advance to 11.8
million tons this year and to 12.5 million tons in 2014. Demand
was 10.9 million tons last year and output was 11.4 million tons.  Global stockpiles at the end of 2012 may have risen to 2
million tons, the highest level since 2005, from 1.56 million a
year earlier because of the export curbs by the Southeast Asian
countries, representing 67 percent of world supply, Nair said.  The countries agreed to limit shipments by 300,000 tons
from October to March to boost prices and to cut down aging
trees, aiming to remove another 150,000 tons of annual output.  Supplies in the first quarter will probably be lower than
that of last year because of the program to limit sales is in
place during a seasonally low production period, which stretches
from February through May, Nair said without providing estimates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
