The Brazilian government plans to
auction 10,000 kilometers of new railways in April and June in
an investment estimated at 91 billion reais ($44.5 billion),
according to the top official at  Brazil ’s state planning
company.  Vale SA, MRS Logistica and ALL America Latina Logistica are
among companies that showed interest in operating the railways,
Planning and Logistics Co. head Bernardo Figueiredo said in an
interview in Brasilia. Auction rules will be published in March
and May, he said.  The Brazilian government last year announced plans to sell
licenses to non-state companies to build and operate railways,
roads, ports and airports with the goal of boosting economic
growth. In August, President Dilma Rousseff said railroad
concessions would amount to 91 billion reais in investment.  New regulations prohibit companies that build railways from
operating them, a practice that was previously allowed,
Figueiredo said. The railways will be used to transport grain,
minerals, fertilizer, fuel and steel, as well a passenger
trains, he said.  “The government wants to end monopolies in railways, end
privileges and open rail to competition,” he said.  The first round of auctions in April will be for 2,600 km
of railroads while the second round in June will be for 7,400 km
more, Figueiredo said. Auction winners must build the railroads
within five years, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
