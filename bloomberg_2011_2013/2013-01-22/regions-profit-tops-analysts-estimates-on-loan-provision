Regions Financial Corp. (RF) ,  Alabama ’s
biggest bank, reported fourth-quarter earnings that beat
analysts’ estimates as its net interest margin, a gauge of
lending profitability, widened.  Net income was $265 million, or 18 cents a share, compared
with a loss of $548 million, or 48 cents, a year earlier, when
the lender posted a non-cash charge tied to the sale of the
Morgan Keegan brokerage, the Birmingham-based bank said today in
a statement. Excluding some one-time items, profit was 22 cents,
compared with the 21-cent  average estimate  of 26 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg.  Regions’ net interest margin, the difference between what
it pays on deposits and charges for loans, widened to 3.1
percent from 3.08 percent in both the third quarter and a year
earlier. Chief Financial Officer  David Turner  told investors in
November the bank’s margin could widen or narrow by two basis
points. Loan growth is expected to be in the low single digits
in 2013, Regions said today in a slide presentation.  “These guys haven’t had much growth, they’ve had a lot of
runoff in their portfolio, so the fact that their guidance is
calling for low single-digit growth in 2013 is incrementally
positive,” said  Michael Rose , an analyst with Raymond James &
Associates Inc. The net interest margin in the fourth quarter
was “at the higher end of expectations,” Rose said.  Regions climbed 1.1 percent to $7.51 at 8:43 a.m. in  New
York . The shares advanced 51 percent in the 12 months through
Jan. 18.  Losing Years  Full-year net income was $1.12 billion, compared with a
loss of $215 million in 2011. It was the bank’s first annual
profit following four consecutive years of losses.  Regions reduced its provision for loan losses to $37
million in the fourth quarter from $295 million a year earlier.  Total revenue in the period was $1.35 billion, compared
with $1.36 billion in the last quarter of 2011. Revenue from
fees increased 5.7 percent to $536 million. Mortgage income
surged 58 percent to $90 million.  In December, the company was upgraded two levels by Moody’s
Investors Service on improved asset quality. Regions is in a
“better position to weather another real estate cycle” after
cutting write-offs and overdue loans, Moody’s said at the time.  Total loans declined 4.6 percent to $74 billion from a year
earlier. That was driven by a 28 percent decrease in investor
real-estate loans, which fell to $7.72 billion. The company said
in the slide presentation that commercial and industrial loan
commitments increased 12 percent during the past year, which
could imply future loan growth, Rose said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
