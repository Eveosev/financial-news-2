Russia  sees the 22-month civil war
in Syria turning into a “prolonged” conflict as it started
evacuating its citizens from the Middle Eastern country, Deputy
Foreign Minister Mikhail Bogdanov said.  “At the start there were forecasts that it would last for
two or three or four months, and it’s going on already for two
years,” Bogdanov told reporters outside Moscow today. “The
military and political situation could develop in different ways
but we believe it could have a prolonged character.”  Russia is helping its nationals who wish to leave Syria and
has prepared contingency plans for the closing of the Russian
embassy in Damascus after suspending operations by its consulate
in the commercial hub Aleppo, Bogdanov said.  Russia,  Syria ’s main international backer, has about 30,000
citizens in the country according to state media. Russian
authorities today evacuated about 50 Russians who crossed the
border with Lebanon on three buses and who will be flown to
Moscow, news service RIA Novosti said.  Russia, which has blocked UN sanctions against Syria during
the conflict, has a naval base in the Syrian port of Tartus and
billions of dollars of arms contracts with the country. After
the overthrow of Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein in 2003 and Libyan
leader Muammar Qaddafi in 2011, Syria is the last major customer
for Russian weapons in the region.  The Syrian president inherited power in 2000 from his
father, Hafez al-Assad, a Soviet ally who ruled for three
decades and received weapons and financial support for the Arab
standoff against  Israel .  To contact the reporter on this story:
