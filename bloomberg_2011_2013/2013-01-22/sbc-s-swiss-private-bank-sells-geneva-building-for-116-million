HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) ’s Swiss private
bank sold the last office it owns in Geneva for 108 million
francs ($116 million) after cutting jobs in the Alpine country.  The office on Quai du General Guisan is being acquired by
Hong Kong’s Wyatt Estates II Ltd., according to the Geneva
property register. The bank is relocating client-facing staff to
a rented riverside office, which it is renovating for 70 million
francs, HBSC’s Swiss unit said in an e-mailed statement today.  “Geneva is our stronghold in Switzerland,” Franco Morra,
chief executive officer of HSBC’s Swiss unit, said in the
statement.  HSBC,  Europe ’s largest bank, made a “slight reduction” in
headcount in Switzerland to 1,700 employees last year, said
David Bruegger, a Zurich-based spokesman for the firm. HSBC is
renting offices in Switzerland amid a wider initiative to sell
real estate assets, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
