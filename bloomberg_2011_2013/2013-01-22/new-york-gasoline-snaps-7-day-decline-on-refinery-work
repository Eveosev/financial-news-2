New York  Harbor gasoline
strengthened for the first time in more than a week as refiners
including  Delta Air Lines Inc. (DAL)  and Philadelphia Energy Solutions
conducted work at plants on the U.S. East Coast.  Delta’s  Trainer refinery  in  Pennsylvania , which last month
shut a fluid catalytic cracker, is expected to need until the
last week of January to complete repairs, according to two
people familiar with operations. A hydrodesulfurization unit and
a cumene unit shut this month for planned maintenance at the
 Philadelphia refinery , regulatory filings show.  A separate section of the Philadelphia plant is expected to
shut for 60 days of work next week, according to a separate
person familiar with operations. That may shrink supplies on the
East Coast, where the Trainer and Philadelphia plants represent
about 42 percent of  refining capacity . The sites can process a
combined 540,000 barrels a day.  Reformulated 84-octane gasoline in New York gained 0.5 cent
to trade at a discount of 1.5 cents a gallon to futures on the
 New York Mercantile Exchange  at 3:14 p.m., the first advance
since Jan. 10. Conventional gasoline to be blended with ethanol
in New York rose  0.58 cent  to 1.52 under futures.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel  gained 0.62 cent to trade at 5.5
cents above heating oil futures. The East Coast’s stockpiles of
 distillates , including heating oil and diesel, retreated 1.7
percent to 42.5 million barrels last week, the Energy
Information Administration, an agency of the Energy Department,
said Jan. 16.  Motor-fuel supplies rose 1 percent to 53.4 million barrels
as refineries in the area processed about 1.1 millions barrels
of crude and other feedstock a day. The 3-2-1 crack spread, a
measure of New York Harbor refining profitability based on Brent
oil in  Europe , rose 94.45 cents to $8.7702 a barrel at 3:52
p.m., the highest level since Jan. 11.  To contact the reporter on this story:
