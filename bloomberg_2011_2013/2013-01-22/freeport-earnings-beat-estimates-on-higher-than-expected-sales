Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. (FCX) ,
which agreed in December to buy two energy companies for $9
billion, reported fourth-quarter earnings that beat analysts’
estimates as copper sales rose more than expected and costs
fell.  Profit excluding an environmental expense and an insurance
gain was 74 cents a share, beating the 72-cent average of 20
 estimates  compiled by Bloomberg. Copper sales rose 18 percent to
972 million pounds, the Phoenix-based company said today in a
statement. That beat Freeport’s Oct. 22 forecast of 930 million
pounds.  Metal volumes were better than expected because of higher
production in North and South America, Freeport said. Copper and
gold sales increased from a year earlier when the company’s
Grasberg mine in Indonesia, its biggest operation, was affected
by a strike. The company’s net cash costs declined to $1.54 a
pound of copper from $1.57 a year earlier.  Jorge Beristain , an
analyst at Deutsche Bank AG in  Stamford , Connecticut, had
estimated costs of $1.63.  Freeport, the world’s biggest publicly traded copper
producer, fell 16 percent on Dec. 15, the day it announced an
agreement to buy  Plains Exploration & Production Co. (PXP)  and  McMoRan
Exploration Co. (MMR)  for cash and stock. Freeport said at the time it
couldn’t find a suitable copper acquisition.  Gold Increase  “The fourth-quarter volumes and fourth-quarter costs were
slightly better than management had guided on its third-quarter
earnings call, but the eventual ramifications of the Plains and
McMoRan deals obviously overwhelm any incremental good news or
bad news from a single quarter,” Daniel Rohr, an analyst with
 Morningstar Inc. (MORN)  in  Chicago , said in a telephone interview.  Freeport rose 4.6 percent to $35.19 at the close in New
York.  Fourth-quarter net income increased to $743 million, or 78
cents a share, from $640 million, or 67 cents, a year earlier.
Revenue climbed 8.4 percent to $4.51 billion.  Gold sales were 254,000 ounces in the period, up from
133,000 ounces in the fourth quarter of 2011.  Copper for delivery in three months on the London Metal
Exchange averaged $7,924 a metric ton in the quarter, 5.2
percent more than a year earlier.  Cobalt Deal  Freeport, which also operates in Africa, repeated its 2013
copper sales forecast of 4.3 billion pounds. The company plans
to increase copper output from 3.66 billion pounds in 2012 to
more than 5 billion pounds a year in 2015, it said in the
statement.  Freeport and  Lundin Mining Corp. (LUN) , its partner in the Tenke
Fungurume copper and cobalt mine in the  Democratic Republic  of
Congo, agreed yesterday to buy  OM Group Inc. (OMG) ’s cobalt unit for
as much as $435 million.  Freeport will own 56 percent and Lundin 24 percent of a
joint venture acquiring the cobalt chemical refinery and sales
business in Kokkola, Finland, and La Generale des Carrieres et
des Mines, the Congolese state mining company, will own the
remainder.  To contact the reporter on this story:
