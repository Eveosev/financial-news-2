Chinese authorities freed 1,281
abducted foreign women last year as criminal gangs shifted their
human-trafficking networks to Asia after a crackdown in  North
America , the state-run  China  Daily newspaper said today.  While most victims were from neighboring countries, police
also rescued women from South American nations such as Colombia,
the newspaper said, citing Chen Shiqu, director of the Ministry
of Public Security’s human trafficking task force.  Human-trafficking got worse in the region in 2012 because
of successful efforts to tackle it in the U.S. and Canada, the
newspaper said, citing Dai Peng, a professor of criminal
investigation at the People’s Public Security University of
China.  The newspaper said 84 abducted foreign children were also
rescued and sent home.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
