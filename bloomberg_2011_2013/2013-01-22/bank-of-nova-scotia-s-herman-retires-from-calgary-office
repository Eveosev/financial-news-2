Bank of Nova Scotia  Managing
Director Mark Herman retired after spending more than a dozen
years at the lender’s Calgary investment-banking office.  Herman’s retirement was announced by Toronto-based
Scotiabank in a Jan. 8 internal memo. Herman joined the bank’s
Calgary office in 1999 after spending 14 years at the
investment-banking units of two other Canadian lenders, the memo
said.  Herman’s experience included debt and equity financings,
advisory work and mergers and acquisitions assignments,
according to his company  biography.   He was also involved in developing foreign asset income
trusts, a new corporate structure that mimics  Canada ’s once
popular income trusts, including the initial share sale of
Calgary-based  Eagle Energy Trust (EGL-U)  in 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
