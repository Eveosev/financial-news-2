Ukraineâ€™s grain shipments slowed
month-on-month in December as wheat exports fell,  UkrAgroConsult 
said, citing preliminary data.  Ukraine exported 2.8 million metric tons of grains last
month, compared with 3.1 million tons in November, the Kiev-
based researcher said today in an e-mailed note.  The government set wheat export limits at 6.05 million tons
for the marketing year and shipped 5.6 million tons as of Dec.
6. UkrAgroConsult declined today to give shipment figures for
the grain last month.  About 12.58 million tons of grains have been shipped since
the marketing year began July 1, UkrAgroConsult said. That
compares with 8.47 million tons in the year-earlier period.  The researcher expects total grain shipments to reach 21.1
million tons this marketing year, while the Agriculture Ministry
forecast is for 23.2 million tons, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
