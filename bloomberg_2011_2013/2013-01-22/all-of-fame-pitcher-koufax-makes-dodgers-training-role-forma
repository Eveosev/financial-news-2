Hall of Fame pitcher  Sandy Koufax 
has rejoined the Los Angeles Dodgers as a special adviser, a
role in which he’ll attend spring training to work with pitchers
and consult with the team throughout the season.  Koufax, 77, a three-time Cy Young Award winner who was a
member of four World Series championship teams in Los Angeles,
had been an occasional spring-training visitor with the Dodgers
when the team was owned by  Frank McCourt . Guggenheim Partners
purchased the Dodgers for $2.15 billion in an auction last year
after McCourt put the team into bankruptcy in June 2011.  In his new role, Koufax will officially be an adviser to
Dodgers Chairman  Mark Walter . Dodgers spokesman Joe Jareck said
Koufax will spend an “extended period” at spring training
after visiting the team’s practice complex in Phoenix for a day
or less in recent years. He has made similar visits with the New
York Mets, who are owned by  Fred Wilpon , one of Koufax’s high
school friends.  “I’m delighted to be back with the Dodgers,” said Koufax,
who in 1972 became the youngest player inducted into the Hall of
Fame, at age 36. “I’m looking forward to spending time with the
team during spring training and to contributing in any way I can
to help make the team a success.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
