Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann
said the  Bank of Japan ’s independence is under threat and warned
that government interference in monetary policy could start to
impact on exchange rates.  “Already, alarming attacks can be seen, for example in
 Hungary  or in  Japan , where the new government is interfering
massively in the affairs of the central bank, pressuring for a
yet more aggressive monetary policy that’s threatening the end
of central bank autonomy,” Weidmann, who also sits on the
European Central Bank’s Governing Council, said in a speech in
Frankfurt last night. “A consequence, whether intended or not,
could be the increasing politicization of the exchange rate.”  The Bank of Japan earlier today set a 2 percent inflation
target and said it will shift to Federal Reserve-style open-
ended asset purchases next year in a bid to end two decades of
deflation. The move comes after new Prime Minister Shinzo Abe,
who is due to choose a successor for BOJ Governor Masaaki
Shirakawa in April, pushed for looser monetary policy and a
weaker yen.  “Until now, the international monetary system has come
through the crisis without rounds of competitive devaluations,”
Weidmann said. “I very much hope it stays that way.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
