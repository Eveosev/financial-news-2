European Union emission permits had
the biggest one-day increase since December 2011, after a surge
in bidding at an auction and as nations consider a temporary fix
to a glut of permits.  EU carbon for December jumped 10 percent after the sale,
held by the European Energy Exchange AG, had a bid-to-offer
ratio of 3.8, the highest since Nov. 2. An auction by  Germany  on
Jan. 18 failed, even after EEX extended it by 15 minutes,
prompting prices to drop to a record yesterday.  Permits advanced 50 cents to close at 5.45 euros ($7.25) a
metric ton on  London ’s ICE Futures Europe exchange. Volume for
the benchmark contract was 28.4 million tons, the highest since
Dec. 21. Certified Emission Reduction credits for December rose
8.8 percent to 37 euro cents a ton.  EU nations including the U.K. and Germany are considering
whether to support a plan by the European Commission in Brussels
to temporarily cut supply by 900 million metric tons in order to
deal with the glut.  The low carbon price “calls into question just how serious
the EU is about mitigating  climate change ,” said Caroline Pitt,
consulting director at Utilyx Holding Ltd. in London, which
provides energy and carbon advice.  Policy makers need to give investors more comfort to
encourage them to spend on emission reductions, she said today
in an e-mailed note.  To contact the reporter on this story:
