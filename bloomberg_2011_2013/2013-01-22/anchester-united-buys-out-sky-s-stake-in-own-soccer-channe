Manchester United bought out British
Sky Broadcasting Plc’s stake in the English soccer club’s own
television channel for an undisclosed price.  The record 19-time English champion purchased Sky’s one-
third stake in the operation, which employs 60 people and is
offered through subscription in the U.K. and Ireland as well as
through other means internationally. The soccer club announced
the transaction today in an e-mailed statement.  The channel was set up in 1998 by Sky, United and U.K.
broadcaster  ITV Plc (ITV) , which the team bought out in 2007. United
now owns the entire business, which it will operate as a
subsidiary.  “This latest acquisition is a natural progression and is
indicative of the club’s desire to have full control of the
content generating and distribution capabilities across all of
its businesses,” United said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
