Manhattan  had a record number of
commercial real estate sales last year as landlords rushed to
complete deals before an expected tax increase, according to
Massey Knakal Realty Services.  Transactions totaled 1,148 for the area south of 96th
Street on the east side and below 110th Street on the west side,
the New York-based brokerage said in a report today. That
represents about 4.2 percent of the area’s properties, the most
since Massey Knakal began keeping records in 1984.  Sales were fueled by rising demand for apartments and
retail properties, said Robert Knakal, co-founding partner of
the brokerage. Volume jumped toward the end of the year as
owners sought to finish deals before an expected increase in the
U.S. capital-gains tax, he said.  “Tax policies almost always have an impact on what happens
in the marketplace,” Knakal said in a telephone interview.
“People were rushing to get transactions done.”  About 38 percent of the year’s sales were in the fourth
quarter, a record for a single three-month period, according to
the report.  “Typically, we sell 30 to 40 buildings in a month,”
Knakal said. “We sold 120 buildings in December.”  Transactions last month included TIAA-CREF’s purchase of a
49 percent stake in the Frank Gehry-designed luxury apartment
tower in the financial district.  Buyers paid $30.3 billion for Manhattan commercial real
estate in 2012, the most since $52.5 billion in 2007, when 999
properties changed hands, according to Massey Knakal. Sales that
year were driven by easy access to securitized credit, which
dried up in 2008 after banks lost billions on bad mortgages.  To contact the reporter on this story:
