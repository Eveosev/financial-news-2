Former  Banca Monte dei Paschi di
Siena SpA  Chairman  Giuseppe Mussari  quit as  Italy ’s top banking
lobbyist as scrutiny of the lender’s use of derivatives deepens.  The resignation is effective immediately, he said in a
letter posted to the Italian Banking Association today. He
leaves as Monte Paschi, where he was chairman from 2006 until
April, comes under growing pressure to disclose the extent of
losses it faces on derivatives.  The lender fell 5.7 percent to 27.75 cents in Milan trading
today, the biggest decliner in  Europe ’s 46-member Stoxx 600
Banks Index, after Il Fatto Quotidiano reported Monte Paschi’s
former managers signed contracts with  Nomura Holdings Inc. (8604)  three
years ago that will reduce 2012 earnings by 220 million euros
($293 million). Nomura said in a statement Mussari “fully
reviewed and approved” the trade.  “I always acted according to the law,” Mussari, 50,
wrote. “I took the decision to not damage the association.”  Monte Paschi said on Jan. 17 it will review its accounts
after  Bloomberg News  first reported that the lender engaged in a
derivative with Deutsche Bank AG in 2008 that obscured losses
before the Siena-based bank sought a government bailout. The
Italian lender, which was bailed out in 2009, is seeking 500
million euros more from taxpayers, bringing the total cost of
its rescue to 3.9 billion euros.  To contact the reporters on this story:
