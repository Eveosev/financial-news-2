The United Nations Security Council,
overcoming past objections by China, tightened sanctions on
 North Korea  in response to its UN-prohibited rocket launch last
month.  The world organization’s decision-making body voted
unanimously in favor on binding measures that build on a series
of travel bans and asset freezes passed in 2006 and 2009. The
resolution, drafted by the U.S., imposes sanctions on North
Korea’s space agency and adds provisions targeting North Korea’s
illicit smuggling of sensitive items.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
