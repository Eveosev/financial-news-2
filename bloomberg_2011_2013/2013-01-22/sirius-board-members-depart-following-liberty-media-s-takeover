Sirius XM Radio Inc. (SIRI) , the satellite-
radio broadcaster, said three directors have resigned from the
company’s board following a takeover by Liberty Media Corp.  Leon Black , Lawrence Gilberti and Jack Shaw have stepped
down from the board, Sirius said today in a regulatory filing.
The New York-based company has named Mark Carleton, Robin
Pringle and Charles Tanabe to fill the vacancies. Interim Chief
Executive Officer James Meyer, who took over after the
resignation of Mel Karmazin last year, also joined the board.  Liberty Media, controlled by billionaire  John Malone ,
gained majority control of Sirius last week after purchasing 50
million shares of the radio operator. Liberty owns a 50.2
percent of Sirius, according to today’s filing.  Liberty Media, based in Englewood, Colorado, plans to spin
off its stake in Sirius, Malone said in July. Malone helped
Sirius avoid bankruptcy in 2009, investing $530 million to pay
off loans in exchange a 40 percent equity stake. Liberty has
made billions on the deal as Sirius shares have increased more
than 19-fold from 16 cents on Feb. 17, 2009, when the loan was
announced, to $3.15 at the close today in  New York .  Liberty Media rose 0.2 percent to $110.74 at the close in
New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
