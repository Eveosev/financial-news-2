Japanese  stock futures  were little
changed a day after the Bank of Japan opted to hold off on new
monetary stimulus until next year, shifting the emphasis on to
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to end two decades of deflation.
Australian shares rose.  American Depositary Receipts  of  Canon Inc. (7751) , a camera maker
that gets 80 percent of sales outside Japan, lost 1.4 percent as
the yen strengthened further after the close of Japan’s equity
markets yesterday.  Boral Ltd. (BLD)  climbed 1.2 percent after the
Australian building materials company increased its profit
forecast. BHP Billiton Ltd. gained 1 percent in Sydney as the
world’s largest mining company said iron-ore production
increased 3 percent.  Futures on Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average expiring in
March closed at 10,650 in  Chicago  yesterday, down from 10,700 at
the close in Osaka, Japan. They were bid in the pre-market at
10,630 in Osaka at 8:05 a.m. local time. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200
Index gained 0.4 percent, heading for the highest closing level
since May 2011. New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index advanced 0.3 percent.  The Bank of Japan meeting “marked yet another faltering
step on the path toward reflation,” said David Homan, New York-
based director of macro strategy at Credit Suisse Group AG. The
decision “leaves a lot of steps still to come. The reality for
reflation still looks more like a slow-burning fuse.”  While Bank of Japan Governor Masaaki Shirakawa’s board said
yesterday it will buy  government bonds  indefinitely to help
achieve a 2 percent inflation target, there were caveats. The
BOJ said the policy will only start next year and the increase
in asset purchases will top out at 10 trillion yen ($113
billion). The yen advanced the most in eight months against the
dollar.  Election Boost  Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average has risen 24 percent since
elections were announced on Nov. 14 on optimism the central bank
would add to stimulus amid pressure from Prime Minister Abe’s
new government.  The MSCI Asia-Pacific Index traded at 14.3 times average
estimated earnings compared with 13.5 for the Standard & Poor’s
500 Index and 12.1 times for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Futures on the  S&P 500 Index  rose 0.1 percent today. The
gauge climbed 0.4 percent yesterday after better-than-forecast
earnings from companies including Travelers Cos. and Freeport-
McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc.  The  Bloomberg China-US Equity Index (CH55BN)  of the most-traded
Chinese shares in the U.S. rose 0.1 percent to 101.79 yesterday
in New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
