Kenya ’s shilling depreciated for a
third day, heading for the weakest in more than a year as
businesses accumulated dollars before elections in March.  The currency of  East Africa ’s biggest economy fell as much
as 0.5 percent to 87.45 a dollar by 3:36 p.m., the lowest on a
closing basis since Jan. 4, 2012, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The shilling has dropped 1.6 percent this year,
compared with a 1.5 percent decline in Tanzania’s shilling and
4.5 percent for  South Africa ’s rand, the continent’s worst
performer.  “The shilling is under pressure from businesses which have
started hedging their dollar positions ahead of the general
elections in March,” Bernard Matimu, chief dealer at NIC Bank,
said by phone. “Elections bring uncertainty in the market and
from previous elections, businesses prefer to accumulate dollars
in advance.” He expects the shilling to weaken to 88 a dollar
by the end of March.  The vote will be the first since a disputed 2007 poll
sparked two months of violence in which more than 1,100 people
died. The shilling will probably weaken before the ballot and
end the year at 88 a dollar provided the elections pass without
violence, Morgan Stanley said in a Jan. 14 note.  The shilling’s retreat today will be the biggest one-day
decline since July 31 if it closes at 87.45.  “There is some flight to safety because of uncertainty
ahead of the elections,” Vimal Parmar, head of research at
Burbidge Capital Ltd, said by phone from Nairobi.  The Ugandan shilling weakened 1.1 percent to 2,703.95 a
dollar, while Tanzania’s shilling depreciated less than 0.1
percent to 1,608.50 per dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
