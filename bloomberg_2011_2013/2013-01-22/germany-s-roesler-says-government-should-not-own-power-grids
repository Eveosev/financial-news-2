Germany  shouldn’t buy into power
grids as such a move is not the best way to manage the energy
switch to renewables from nuclear power, according to Economy
Minister Philipp Roesler.  The calls for government ownership of  power lines  are
“wrong,” as private investors are eager to finance its
modernization, Roesler said today at an energy conference in
Berlin.  “All is ready so that the grid expansion can be brought
forward,” Roesler said.  German  Chancellor Angela Merkel ’s government last month
backed a plan to lay about 2,800 kilometers (1,740 miles) of new
transmission lines and upgrade 2,900 kilometers of existing
cables by 2022. The opposition  Social Democratic Party  called on
the government to take control of the grids to eradicate delays
in building new lines and connecting offshore wind farms to the
network.  Power supply has moved to the center of Germany’s political
agenda since Merkel decided in 2011 to replace nuclear reactors
with more fossil-fired plants and a growing share of clean-
energy sources. Federal grid regulator Bundesnetzagentur says
the grids need upgrades as the country adds wind farms and solar
parks, whose output varies with the weather.  Roesler said he’s “optimistic” the government can reform
Germany’s EEG clean-energy subsidy system before federal
elections this fall to reduce surging costs. Owners of  wind
turbines  and solar panels should not be paid subsidies if the
power can’t be sold on the market, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
