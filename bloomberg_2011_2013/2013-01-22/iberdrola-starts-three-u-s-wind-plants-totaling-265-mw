Iberdrola SA (IBE) , Spain’s biggest
utility, started up three U.S. wind farms with a combined
electricity generation capacity of more than 265 megawatts.  The Manzana park in California is among the biggest
operated by the Bilbao, Spain-based company, with 126  General
Electric Co. (GE)  1.5-megawatt turbines providing capacity of 189
megawatts, Iberdrola said today in an e-mailed  statement .  The other two farms are the 48-megawatt Groton site in  New
Hampshire  with 24 Gamesa Corp. Tecnologica SA machines, and the
28.5-megawatt Hoosac plant in Massachusetts with 19 GE turbines.  Iberdrola, the second-biggest operator of wind farms in the
U.S. with more than 5,700 megawatts of installed capacity, says
it’s a “strategic” market and it will use 1.7 billion euros
($2.3 billion) or 16 percent of its investment from 2012 through
2014 in the U.S., mainly on grid and renewable energy projects.  To contact the reporter on this story:
