U.S. Steel Corp. (X)  continues talks
with the Slovak government on a possible exit from the country
after the administration offered incentives to stay, Premier
 Robert Fico  said.  The largest U.S. steel producer by volume has said it is in
negotiations to sell its Slovak plant, one of the largest
employers in the eastern euro-area member country. The
administration has offered the company incentives related to
electricity charges, transportation and environment, Fico said.  “There have been proposals, which U.S. Steel considers
interesting and feasible,” Fico said at a press conference in
Bratislava, Slovakia, today. “Both parties are strongly
interested to continue in talks and find a solution that the
investor could stay.”  The Pittsburgh-based steelmaker is scaling back operations
in  Europe , where slowing demand is weighing on prices and
shipments. A year ago, it sold its Serbian mill for $1,
triggering a $450 million charge.  U.S. Steel bought its Slovak operations in 2000 for $475
million. The Kosice-based plant, whose annual capacity is 5
million tons, has two coke batteries, three blast furnaces and
units that produce sheets, tin-mill products and pipes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
