Australia ’s dollar dropped, halting
a two-day gain, after data showed consumer prices increased last
quarter by less than economists forecast, giving the  Reserve
Bank  scope to cut borrowing costs further.  The so-called Aussie fell against all but one of its 16
major counterparts after the Bureau of Statistics said the
 consumer price index  advanced 0.2 percent from the previous
three months, compared with the median forecast of economists in
a Bloomberg News survey of a 0.4 percent increase. The trimmed
mean gauge of core inflation rose 0.6 percent from the previous
quarter, compared with a forecast gain of 0.7 percent.  The inflation data “does allow the RBA to ease further if
it seems necessary,” said  Annette Beacher , head of Asia-Pacific
research for TD Securities Inc. in Singapore. “The Australian
dollar has fallen on the headline just because the outcome was
marginally lower than consensus.”  Australia’s dollar dropped 0.3 percent to $1.0538 as of
4:09 p.m. in Sydney from the close yesterday. It fell 0.6
percent to 93.21 yen. New Zealand’s dollar traded little changed
at 84.05 U.S. cents and slid 0.3 percent to 74.34 yen.  Yields on Australia’s 10-year government bonds declined six
basis points, or 0.06 percentage point, to 3.3 percent.  Traders see about a 47 percent chance the Reserve Bank of
Australia will lower its key rate by a quarter percentage point
to a record low 2.75 percent at a Feb. 5 meeting, little changed
from yesterday,  interest-rate swaps  data compiled by Bloomberg
show.  Aussie-Yen  Today’s inflation figures are unlikely to trigger an
immediate reduction in borrowing costs, according to TD’s
Beacher. The RBA has cut its  benchmark  by 1.5 percentage points
since November 2011.  The Aussie fell against the yen for a fourth day amid
speculation the  Bank of Japan (8301)  failed to meet market expectations
for monetary stimulus.  The BOJ yesterday agreed to set a 2 percent inflation
target urged by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, while pushing back
open-ended asset purchases until next year.  Australia’s currency gained 14 percent over the past three
months versus its Japanese counterpart and reached 95.03 yen on
Jan. 18, the most since August 2008.  “Policy measures put in place by the BOJ, on balance,
probably disappointed the market,” said  Andrew Salter , a
currency strategist in Sydney at  Australia & New Zealand Banking
Group Ltd. (ANZ)  “I think we’ve had a near-term peak in the Aussie-
yen.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
