  UBS AG (UBSN) , Switzerland’s biggest bank,
said Andre Cronje, the former head of wealth management in the
U.K. and Jersey, was appointed as chief operating officer for
the investment bank.  The appointment is effective today, the Zurich-based firm
said in an internal memo to employees from  Andrea Orcel , head of
the investment bank, and Ulrich Koerner, COO of the company.  Cronje has been with UBS since 2000. James B. Broderick, a
former head of  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) ’s asset-management business
in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, replaced Cronje in the
wealth-management role earlier this month.  “Andre’s experience from investment banking, wealth
management and corporate center, as well as his international
perspective, is a major asset as we seek to reposition ourselves
and further our partnership across the Group, and particularly
with wealth management,” the memo said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
