(Corrects currency conversion in second paragraph.)  Grainger (GRI)  Plc, the U.K.’s largest
publicly traded residential landlord, and a unit of asset
manager APG agreed to buy a residential property portfolio for
349.4 million pounds ($554 million).  APG,  Europe ’s largest pension fund asset manager with 325
billion euros ($434 billion) under management, will invest 158
million pounds in GRIP, a trust set up to buy the G:res1
property portfolio, Grainger said in a statement today. The U.K.
company owns a 26.2 percent stake in the portfolio and will
invest the capital raised from its sale and an additional 9.1
million pounds in GRIP.  GRIP will focus on renting out properties in greater London
and may also invest in developing homes for leasing.  London 
rents rose 6 percent in the year through October, according to
an index compiled by HomeLet. The G:res1 portfolio was set up by
Grainger in 2005.  “Prospects for the greater London rental market are
promising,” Robert-Jan Foortse, head of European real estate at
Heerlen, the Netherlands-based APG, said in the statement.
“This transaction demonstrates our willingness and aptitude for
working with investment managers to modernize, recapitalize and
extend the life of existing vehicles owning good quality real
estate.”  The new fund will be renewed every five years. It will seek
additional equity from financial institutions to allow
additional home purchases.  To contact the reporter on this story:
