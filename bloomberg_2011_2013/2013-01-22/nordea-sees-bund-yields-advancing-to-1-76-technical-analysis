German 10-year bond yields may rise
to an eight-month high of 1.76 percent after climbing above a
key level of so-called resistance,  Nordea Bank AB (NDA)  said, citing
trading patterns.  The bund yield, which was at 1.61 percent at 12:14 p.m. in
 London , will rise further if it closes higher than 1.598
percent, a level that represents a  23.6 percent Fibonacci 
retracement going back 12 months, the bank said in an e-mailed
note today.  “The short-term target is 1.76 percent,” wrote Nordea
analysts including Jonas Thulin, the Stockholm-based head of
alpha strategy. “These coming days are vital in setting the
next move. A close above 1.598 percent, would clearly signal
more upside.” The last time the yield reached 1.76 percent was
on April 26.  The bank said near-term resistance, an area on a bond-price
graph at which analysts would expect to find buy orders
clustered, is seen at 1.608 percent. Investors should exit this
trade if the yield falls to 1.508 percent, the bank said.  Fibonacci analysis is based on the theory that prices rise
or fall by certain percentages after reaching a high or low.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security,
currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
