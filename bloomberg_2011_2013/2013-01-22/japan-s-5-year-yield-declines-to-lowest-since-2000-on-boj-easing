Japan’s five-year note  yield  fell to
the lowest level since the government started selling the debt
in February 2000, after the central bank said it will shift to
open-ended asset purchases to help end deflation.  Demand for 20-year bonds was limited after the  Bank of
Japan (8301)  set a 2 percent inflation target today. The BOJ will buy
about 13 trillion yen ($146 billion) in assets per month from
January 2014, including about 2 trillion in Japanese  government
bonds  and about 10 trillion yen in treasury bills, it said.  “This isn’t the end to the BOJ’s easing,” said Tadashi Matsukawa, who helps oversee the equivalent of $1.5 billion as
head of fixed-income investment at PineBridge Investments Japan
Co. in Tokyo. “Bond losses present a buying opportunity.”  The yield on the five-year note dropped to as low as 0.14
percent before trading at 0.15 percent at 5 p.m. in Tokyo,
unchanged from yesterday, according to  Japan  Bond Trading Co.,
the nation’s largest interdealer debt broker. The price of the
0.2 percent security maturing in December 2017 was 100.243.  Japan’s 20-year yield rose one basis point to 1.745
percent. The benchmark 10-year rate was little changed at 0.73
percent, after touching 0.725 percent, the lowest since Dec. 14.
A basis point to 0.01 percentage point.  The BOJ said today in a statement that it aims to achieve a
new  inflation  target at “the earliest possible time.” It
previously said it would ease until 1 percent inflation is “in
sight.” The central bank sees a gain in consumer prices of 0.9
percent for the fiscal year starting April 2014, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
