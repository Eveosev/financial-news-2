Airlines may earn as much as 1.3
billion euros ($1.7 billion) after they passed onto customers
the costs of European pollution curbs and won a freeze on their
carbon trading obligations, a report showed.  Carriers may cash in between 436 million and 872 million
euros after they raised ticket prices following their inclusion
in the European Union emission trading system last year,
environmental research institute CE Delft said in the report.
The windfall gains may rise by further 243 million to 486
million euros after the EU proposed to temporarily exempt from
its carbon system flights into and out of the region, according
to the report.  “Passengers have paid toward fighting  climate change , it
is unjust for airlines to retain these windfall profits,” said
Bill Hemmings, aviation manager at lobby group Transport &
Environment, which commissioned the report.  The 27-nation EU decided to include aviation in its
emissions trading system from 2012 after airline discharges in
the region doubled over two decades. The expansion of the
European cap-and-trade program abroad triggered opposition from
countries including the U.S.,  China  and  Russia , which argued the
 United Nations ’ aviation panel is the forum to tackle emissions
from the industry.  While the proposed exemption for foreign flights is due to
be officially adopted by European governments later this year,
airlines will have to comply with the pollution limits on routes
within  Europe . The EU wants to lead the fight against climate
change and is pushing for a global deal to cut pollution from
airlines.  “Air carriers should act responsibly and contribute these
additional profits to the UN’s Green Climate Fund, created to
support developing countries’ initiatives to tackle the impacts
of climate change,” Hemmings said in an e-mailed statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
