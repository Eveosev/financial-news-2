Renren Inc. (RENN) , China’s equivalent of
Facebook Inc., introduced two applications for smartphone users
as it contends with rising competition in the world’s largest
internet market.  The new apps include Bobo, which records and modifies
users’ voices, for instance, to make them sound like cartoon
characters, the Beijing-based company said in a statement today.
Meimei is photo app that detects human faces in images and then
improves the lighting and complexion.  The company has added the software as it faces slowing
growth caused by weaker advertising and competitors introducing
rival products.  Tencent Holdings Ltd. (700) , China’s largest internet
company, has drawn more than 300 million users since introducing
a social-network application called WeChat about two years ago.  Renren has fallen about 20 percent in the past year in  New
York  trading.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
