Hideo Shimomura, who helps oversee
the equivalent of $67 billion in Tokyo as chief fund investor at
Mitsubishi UFJ Asset Management Co., comments on the  Bank of
Japan (8301) ’s policy decision today.  The BOJ announced said it will buy about 13 trillion yen
($146 billion) in assets per month beginning in January 2014,
including about 2 trillion yen in  government bonds  and about 10
trillion yen in bills.  “At the moment, they are buying under three years. Though
it wasn’t clearly announced, I suppose they won’t change. They
will continue that. They’re not ready to expand and purchase the
whole yield curve because it’s seen as monetizing the debt.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
