Cyrela  Brazil  Realty SA, Brazil’s
biggest homebuilder by revenue, dropped the most in six weeks
after reporting preliminary 2012 sales that trailed some
analysts’ estimates.  Shares fell 2.7 percent to 18 reais at the close of trading
in Sao Paulo, the steepest decline since Dec. 11. The  BM&F
Bovespa Real Estate Index (IMOBBV)  declined 0.8 percent.  Cyrela said in a regulatory filing yesterday that sales
including partners fell 7.6 percent to 6 billion reais
($2.9 billion). Analysts at  Banco Bradesco SA (BBDC4) ’s brokerage had
projected 6.4 billion reais.  “On the whole, Cyrela’s results were no different than its
peers’, in our view,” Banco Bradesco analysts including Luiz Mauricio Garcia wrote in a note to clients published today. “It
is reasonable to anticipate some underperformance, as the market
was expecting more.”  Sao Paulo-based Cyrela’s fourth-quarter sales were 1.08
billion reais, while sales including partners were 1.7 billion
reais, according to the filing. Sales in the year-ago period
were 1.98 billion reais, data compiled by Bloomberg  show .  EZ Tec Empreendimentos & Participacoes SA, the country’s
fourth-biggest homebuilder by market value, dropped 3.1 percent
to 26.50 reais, the biggest decline since Sept. 14. The
company’s fourth-quarter sales fell 16 percent year over year,
totaling 210.3 million reais, according to a regulatory filing
yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
