Warren Buffett , the billionaire
chairman of  Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A) , will add a five-kilometer
run this year to an annual-meeting weekend known for featuring
snacks like ice cream and candy.  Buffett will fire the starting gun for the run on Sunday,
May 5, which will proceed through Omaha, Nebraska, the city
where Berkshire is based, the company said in a statement today.  The annual meeting attracts thousands of investors from
around the world who fill Omaha’s CenturyLink Center to hear
Buffett share his thoughts on investing, the economy and
corporate governance. Buffett has used the meeting to highlight
an investment in  Coca-Cola Co. (KO) , the world’s largest soft-drink
maker, and Berkshire operating units like See’s Candies and the
Dairy Queen ice cream business, maker of the Dilly Bar.  “A 5k will be the perfect complement to the See’s Candies,
Dilly Bar and Cherry Coke everyone will enjoy while here,”
Buffett, 82, said in the statement.  The race is being sponsored by Brooks, the Berkshire unit
that makes running sneakers. The annual meeting is scheduled for
May 4.  To contact the reporter on this story:
