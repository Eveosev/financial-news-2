Louisiana is poised to sell $249
million in highway bonds this week with transportation debt
beating top-rated municipal securities in 10 of the last 13
years.  The offering will fund restoration and improvement of about
690 miles (1,110 kilometers) of roads, bond documents say. The
deal, with a 2033 final maturity, is expected to sell Jan. 23,
Whitman Kling, Jr., director of the Louisiana State Bond
Commission, said in an e-mail.  The total return for  transportation securities  has exceeded
that for the $3.7 trillion muni market in all but three years
since 2000, according to  Standard & Poor’s  index data. In 2012,
the segment returned 15.2 percent, including price change and
interest, against 14.3 percent for the  broader index .  Truck and trailer registration taxes and fees will back
payments to bondholders. While revenue in fiscal 2013 is
expected to total $51 million, a 16 percent decrease from the
previous year, that’s an improvement from a prior forecast, said
 Fitch Ratings . The company gives the securities an AA- rating,
fourth-highest.  Such volatility isn’t unusual. Fitch said that vehicle fees
have been affected by “multiple hurricanes” in the Pelican
State and the 2010 Deepwater Horizon drilling rig explosion,
which sparked the largest offshore  oil spill  in U.S. history.  2012 Law  The offering is a first for the bond program, which was
established through legislation in 2012 to fund state roads
ineligible for federal dollars, S&P said in a press release.  Louisiana had about $10.4 billion of tax-supported debt as
of December, according to the offering statement. A state bond
maturing in 2022 traded Jan. 18 with a yield of 1.74 percent,
compared with a benchmark 10-year index at 1.69 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
