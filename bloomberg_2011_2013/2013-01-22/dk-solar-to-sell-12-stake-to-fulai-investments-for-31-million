LDK Solar Co. (LDK) , a Chinese
photovoltaic manufacturer with more than $3.1 billion in  debt ,
agreed to sell about a 12 percent stake to Fulai Investments
Ltd. for $31 million.  LDK plans to issue 17 million new shares at $1.83 each and
offered two board seats to Fulai, the Xinyu, China-based solar
company said in a regulatory filing today. The new shares will
boost LDK’s total outstanding to about 144 million, according to
 data  compiled by Bloomberg.  LDK, the biggest maker of wafers for solar cells after GCL-
Poly Energy Holdings Ltd., last month hired Citigroup Inc. to
help renegotiate its liabilities. Fulai is incorporated in the
British Virgin Islands, according to the filing.  LDK’s American depositary receipts, each worth one ordinary
share, rose 7.7 percent to $1.97 at the close in  New York . They
have declined 59 percent in the past year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
