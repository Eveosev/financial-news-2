Morrison & Foerster LLP  opened an
office in Singapore, which will be led by Eric Piesner, firmwide
managing partner for Asia and head of the firm’s Asia real
estate practice.  “We already have a substantial base of business with a
Singapore nexus, including clients with M&A, real estate,
project finance, dispute resolution, TMT, private equity and tax
needs,” Piesner said in a statement. “We see our presence in
Singapore as an opportunity to further help clients in these and
other areas.”  The office is MoFo’s fifth in Asia and 16th worldwide. The
firm also has offices in  Hong Kong , Beijing,  Shanghai  and  Tokyo .
The firm’s recent transactions in Asia include SoftBank’s $20.1
billion acquisition of a 70 percent stake in Sprint Nextel. Firm
lawyers have also worked on Wal-Mart’s Global e-Commerce
division’s increased investment in China’s Yihoadian as well as
Hitachi’s $4.8 billion sale of Hitachi Global Storage
Technologies to  Western Digital .  Piesner, who focuses his practice on cross-border real
estate transactions throughout Asia, is joined in the office by
Tokyo corporate and tax partner Eric Roose, along with several
associates.  Fees  Glaxo Accord Said to Spur Lawyer Fight Over $143 Million in Fees  GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK) ’s settlement of Avandia drug cases
triggered a challenge by nine law firms who object to a bid by
lead attorneys for almost three-quarters of a $143 million fee
fund, including one seeking about $2,700 per hour, according to
two people familiar with the matter.  Attorneys suing on behalf of users of the diabetes
medicine, who said it caused heart attacks and strokes, filed
objections to the fee request in Philadelphia federal court,
said the people, who asked not to be identified because the
matter isn’t public. The contested amount is sought by a court-
appointed group of plaintiffs’ lawyers picked to recommend how
much attorneys in the cases should be paid, the people said.  Six law firms on that fee committee asked for 71 percent of
the fund set aside by U.S. District Judge Cynthia Rufe for the
Avandia cases before her, according to the people. The committee
lawyers put the most time and money into efforts to collect
evidence that Glaxo allegedly mishandled warnings about
Avandia’s risks, Dianne Nast, a lawyer who led the group, said
in an interview.  “These were the folks who were the most active in working
on the case, so it’s only natural they are in line for a larger
share of the fees,” Nast said. The fee fund, between 6 and 7
percent of the total settlement, according to the people, means
the total accord may be worth more than $2 billion. As a result,
the average payout for the 40,000 users of Avandia involved in
the litigation would be about $50,000 -- before legal fees.  Joseph Zonies , a Denver-based attorney who served as one of
the lead lawyers in the Avandia cases before Rufe, is slated to
collect more than $24.4 million, the highest recommended fee,
according to the people. Zonies put in more than 18,000 hours of
work on the case and his fee would amount to $1,341-an-hour for
his efforts, the people said. He declined to comment on the fee
recommendation. Another lawyer,  Vance Andrus , is seeking almost
double that per-hour amount, according to the people.  Plaintiffs’ lawyers in product liability cases work on a
contingency fee basis. While per-hour calculations may be much
higher than attorneys who regularly work at an hourly rate,
lawyers who work on contingency are often forced to spend
millions of dollars of their own money to pursue a case and
aren’t guaranteed payment in the end, unless they win or settle.  Benedict Morelli, a New York-based lawyer who according to
the court’s docket objected to the fee recommendations, and
Samuel Lanham, a Maine attorney who also objected, didn’t return
calls for comment on their objections.  Glaxo, the U.K.’s biggest drugmaker, has said it paid more
than $3 billion to settle federal and state government claims
that it illegally marketed Avandia, once the world’s best-
selling diabetes pill, and other medications.  The lawyers on the fee-advisory group headed by Nast
included Zonies, Andrus, Thomas Cartmell,  Bryan Aylstock ,
 Stephen Corr ,  Paul Kiesel  and  Bill Robins III , according to
court records. Cartmell, Andrus and Kiesel declined to comment
on the fee recommendations. Aylstock, Corr and Robins didn’t
return calls seeking comment.  For more, click here.  News  Obama Takes Oath as Lawyers Open Offices to Clients  A crowd of hundreds of thousands of people, a smattering of
celebrities and many Republicans, gathered yesterday to witness
President  Barack Obama  take his second oath of office on the
steps of the U.S. Capitol. Some lawyer-lobbying firms opened
their offices to clients and other guests, who could grab a meal
or a drink, and watch the festivities on television.  Holland & Knight LLP’s new offices overlooked the end of
the parade route on Pennsylvania Avenue, and offered guests
mini-paninis and popcorn, while K&L Gates LLP, a couple of
blocks away, had chili and carrot and celery sticks for its
visitors.  “Public policy is shaped in a lot of different venues, in
a lot of different discussions and in a lot of different
formats,” said Manny Rouvelas, a partner at K&L Gates.  Among those in attendance at the Capitol on the chilly,
overcast morning, were rap artist Jay-Z, actress  Angela Bassett 
and former House Speaker  Newt Gingrich , who unsuccessfully
sought the Republican nomination last year to challenge Obama.  A batch of senators in their inaugural finery stood near
the president. Republican Senator  Orrin Hatch  of  Utah  sported a
cowboy hat.  Arizona  Senator  John McCain , the president’s 2008
Republican challenger, snapped pictures of the crowd with his
smartphone. Singers John Mayer and Katy Perry also made their
way through the crowd. “Proud,” Perry told reporters when
asked how she felt about being at the inauguration.  “We are made for this moment and we will seize it so long
as we seize it together,” Obama said as applause rose.  For more, click here.  Paul Weiss Report Says NBA Should Consider Replacing Hunter  New York   law firm  Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison
LLP said National Basketball Association players should consider
replacing  Billy Hunter  as their union chief after he focused on
personal interests ahead of the organization.  Hunter, 70, didn’t do anything illegal, the law firm said
after conducting a nine-month investigation. It said Hunter
failed to manage conflicts of interest and hid the fact that his
contract as executive director of the National Basketball
Players Association wasn’t properly approved.  “Mr. Hunter’s actions have also called into question his
stewardship of union resources, reflected poor judgment or
raised serious doubts about his interest in policies and
procedures to protect the union’s interests,” Paul, Weiss said
in the report.  The firm said in a statement that it reviewed thousands of
documents, including financial and governance records and e-
mail. It said it also interviewed more than three dozen people,
including union employees, vendors and executive committee
members.  Hunter, who took over the union in 1996, said in an e-
mailed statement that he was pleased the 229-page  report 
“recognized that I have not engaged in criminal acts nor was I
involved in misappropriation of union funds.”  Theodore V. Wells Jr., co-chairman of the litigation
department at Paul, Weiss who led the investigation, said in a
statement that Hunter wasn’t given an advance copy of the firm’s
findings.  “This has been a truly independent review,” he said.  For more, click here.  Chicago’s Biggest Office Project Since 2008 Gets Anchor Tenant  The law firm McDermott Will & Emery LLP agreed to be the
anchor tenant for a 45-story  office tower  that Hines and the
real estate arm of Canada’s biggest pension-fund manager are

the building, which will be the city’s first such project since
the 2008 financial crisis, according to the statement.  “We received a very attractive package from the
developer,” Jeffrey Stone, co-chairman of the law firm, said in
a telephone interview. “We’re catching the market in a good
place at a good time.”  Demand for  office space  in the nation’s third-largest city
is climbing. Chicago’s office- vacancy  rate was 18.7 percent in
the fourth quarter, down from a high of 19.1 percent in the
first quarter of 2011, according to  Reis Inc. (REIS) , a New York-based
real estate research firm.  Moves  Paul Hastings ,  Jones Day , K&L Gates: Non-U.S. Partners  Paul Hastings LLP hired Weil Gotshal & Manges LLP’s London

explains how his firm has built a software program called the
Rosetta Project, which translates the firm’s financial data into
narratives that explain how well a partner’s practice is
performing and why. “Lawyers can relate to stories where
they’re the protagonist -- the obstacles that they face or the
opportunities that they face can be presented as tales, rather
than a collection of numbers,” he says.  Alber tells Bloomberg Law’s Lee Pacchia that a sample
report might say “Bob Smith had a great year last year. His
collections were 20 percent above the previous year and his
profitability is improving. The reason his profitability is
improving is because he’s made some changes in leverage. But
he’s got some opportunities” to improve his pricing.  Terminal Users: Click here to play now.  To contact the reporter on this story:
