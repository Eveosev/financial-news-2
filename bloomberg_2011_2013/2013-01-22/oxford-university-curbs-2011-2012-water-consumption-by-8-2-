Oxford University’s total water
consumption fell 8.2 percent during the 2011-2012 annual review
period, saving the equivalent of almost 29 million liters (7.65
million gallons), the school said today.  The U.K. university said on its website that the reduction
was achieved by implementing the first year of the school’s
water-management strategy, including refurbishing washrooms and
upgrading equipment in university departments such as science
laboratories.  Link to water review: { http://www.water.ox.ac.uk/oxford -
