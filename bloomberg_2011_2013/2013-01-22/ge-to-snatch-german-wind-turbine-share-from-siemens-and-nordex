General Electric Co. (GE)  plans to win a
“double-digit” share of  Germany ’s onshore wind market in two
years, taking orders from peers like  Siemens AG (SIE)  and  Nordex SE. (NDX1)   GE developed a 2.5-megawatt turbine for low wind speeds
that will help it benefit from surging installations in southern
Germany, Stephan Reimelt, chief executive officer of the Energy
Germany division, said in an interview in Berlin. GE will
present the turbine at a conference in Vienna next month.  “We have the first orders and we’re very optimistic that
the product will be successful,” Reimelt said today. “In
Europe, Germany is currently the place where things are
happening.” GE is “well on track” to achieve its projection
of doubling sales in the country by 2015, he said.  Germany,  Europe ’s biggest power market, plans to replace
nuclear reactors with fossil fuel-fired plants and renewable
energy, and build or upgrade 5,700 kilometers (3,500 miles) of
power lines. The nation, GE’s current focus in Europe, offers a
“huge” market for managing energy-related data, Reimelt said.  GE has carried out European acquisitions in the past two
years led by the $3.2 billion purchase of Converteam, a French
maker of power-conversion products. GE this month announced it
would buy Berlin-based energy planning company BLS Energieplan
GmbH to strengthen its offerings in the energy industry.  Reimelt declined to comment on other possible deals. “It’s
obvious that the German Mittelstand is highly innovative,” he
said. “That’s interesting to any company with a global focus.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
