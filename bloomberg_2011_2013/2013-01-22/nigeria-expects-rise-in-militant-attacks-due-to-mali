Nigeria  boosted security on its
borders in anticipation of increased attacks by Boko Haram
militants after it sent troops to help expel Islamists from
northern  Mali , a military spokesman said.  “If they’re part of al-Qaeda in the Maghreb, if they’re in
support of the northern Mali crisis, there’s every possibility
that they will heighten their attacks,” Colonel Mohammed
Yerima, director of information at Nigeria’s  Defense Ministry ,
said today in an interview in Abuja, the capital. “On our own
side, we’re strategizing how to counter them.”  Nigeria, Africa’s largest oil producer and most populous
nation, is battling an insurgency by Boko Haram Islamists that
has killed hundreds of people since 2009. The group, whose name
means “Western education is a sin,” has carried out bomb and
gun attacks in the mainly Muslim north and Abuja.  Nigeria is contributing 1,200 troops to join France and
soldiers from other West African countries in Mali to recapture
territory lost to Islamist militants and ethnic Touareg
separatists. The crisis may spill into Nigeria if not brought
under control, President  Goodluck Jonathan  told lawmakers on
Jan. 17.  Gunmen opened fire at a convoy of soldiers in the central
Nigerian Kogi state Jan. 19 as they were on their way to join
the West African Force in Mali, leaving two dead, the army said
on Jan. 20.  To contact the reporter on this story:
