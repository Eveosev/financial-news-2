Spain ’s Treasury aims to cover as
much as 13 percent of its planned gross debt issuance for 2013
in January after investors bought 7 billion euros ($9.3 billion)
of 10-year bonds in a syndicated sale that saw record demand.  The Treasury may end the month with total issuance of 27
billion euros depending on the final results of bill sales, the
Economy Ministry in Madrid said in an e-mailed statement late
yesterday. That compares with a goal of 215 billion to 230
billion euros of bonds and bills for the whole year.  Foreign investors bought more than 60 percent of a new
benchmark 10-year bond issued yesterday. Around a quarter of the
allotted amount was bought by investors from the U.K., 17
percent from euro-region nations, 7 percent from  Nordic
countries , 3 percent from the  Middle East  and 3 percent from the
U.S., according to the statement.  Spain is taking advantage of a rally in securities of so-
called peripheral countries to fast-track debt sales as it faces
a 24 percent increase in  net funding needs  this year. The
 European Central Bank ’s pledge to help nations bring down yields
may curb borrowing costs until a recovery, Prime Minister
 Mariano Rajoy  said last month.  The yield on Spain’s  10-year benchmark bond  was unchanged
at 5.11 percent at 9:13 a.m. in Madrid today, compared with a
euro-era record of 7.75 percent on July 25, before ECB President
 Mario Draghi  pledged to backstop the region’s fourth-largest
economy.  Record Volume  The security, which matures on Jan. 31, 2023, and has a 5.4
percent coupon, was sold by six banks at 365 basis points more
than the mid-swap rate, or an average yield of 5.403 percent,
according to Spain’s Treasury. That compares with 5.290 percent
when it last auctioned 10-year debt on Dec. 5.  Demand was around 22.7 billion euros and was shared among
more than 350 investor accounts, the highest volume in the
history of the Treasury’s syndicated sales, the ministry said.  The sale bodes well for the country’s issuance plans in the
short term, said Lyn Graham-Taylor, a fixed-income strategist at
Rabobank International in  London . Spain will probably seek to
sell more long-dated bonds, although it is hard to see issuance
of debt dated much longer than 10 years, he said by telephone.  Asset managers represented 40 percent of the amount placed
yesterday and banks 34 percent, the ministry said. Pension funds
and insurance companies bought 13 percent and central banks 7
percent.  Sign of Credibility  The Treasury decided to go ahead with the syndication after
Spain’s short-term borrowing costs dropped and it saw high
demand at a sale of 2.8 billion euros of bills, the ministry
said. Economy Minister Luis de Guindos yesterday told reporters
in Brussels that the debt sales are “a clear indication of the
Spanish economy’s credibility.”  De Guindos said 2012 budget data expected in the coming
weeks will be “positive.” Still, the European Commission
yesterday said the nation will probably miss its deficit target
of 6.3 percent of output in 2012 even if the most recent budget
cuts produce their full impact in the last quarter.  “What will stand out in the end is the huge effort Spain
has made to reduce its public deficit in a very complicated
environment,” de Guindos said. Spain’s  planned austerity 
measures through 2014 will be sufficient, he said.  Economists forecast Spain’s recession will deepen in 2013,
the fifth year of its economic slump. That will undermine
efforts to tackle the second-largest deficit in the euro area,
at 9.4 percent of gross domestic product in 2011, they say.  To contact the reporters on this story:
