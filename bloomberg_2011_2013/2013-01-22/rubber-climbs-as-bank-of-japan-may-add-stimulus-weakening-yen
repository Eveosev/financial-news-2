Rubber rose after the  Bank of Japan (8301) 
announced open-ended asset purchases and adopted a 2 percent
inflation target.  Rubber for delivery in June gained as much as 1 percent to
314.7 yen a kilogram ($3,523 a metric ton) before trading at
312.2 yen at 2:45 p.m. on the Tokyo Commodity Exchange. Futures
have advanced 3.2 percent this year.  The BOJ said it will buy about 13 trillion yen in assets
per month from January 2014, including about 2 trillion yen in
Japanese  government bonds  and about 10 trillion yen in treasury
bills. The move to double the inflation goal was forecast by 21
of the 23 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The  Japanese yen 
gained after the outcome, reversing earlier losses.  Rubber is also being supported by optimism that Chinese
buyers will build up stockpiles ahead of New Year holidays and
after  Thailand , the biggest producer, approved funding for the
state rubber purchase program, said Chaiwat Muenmee, an analyst
at DS Futures Co. in Bangkok.  The Thai government yesterday approved a plan by Rubber
Estate Organization to disburse 5 billion baht ($168 million)
from the state-run Bank for Agriculture & Agricultural
Cooperatives to continue the rubber purchase program, government
spokesman Tossaporn Serirak said. Thailand has spent 17.4
billion baht in buying 182,446 tons of rubber from farmers above
market rates, he said yesterday.  Rubber for delivery in May rose 1.3 percent to 26,095  yuan 
($4,195) a ton on the Shanghai Futures Exchange.  China  imported
2.18 million tons of natural rubber last year, a rise of 3.6
percent on year, according to the Beijing-based Customs General
Administration.  Thai rubber free-on-board was unchanged at 98.70 baht
($3.32) a kilogram today, according to the Rubber Research
Institute of Thailand.  To contact the reporters on this story:
