South African wheat futures rose for
a third day as global prices climbed on concern that cold
weather in  Russia  and a persistent drought in the U.S. will curb
global supplies.  Wheat for March delivery, the most active contract,
increased 0.4 percent to 3,644.20 rand ($412) a metric ton by
the close on the South African Futures Exchange in Johannesburg.  Wheat climbed to a one-month high on the Chicago Board of
trade as winter-kill caused by freezing temperatures affected 9
percent of the 15.7 million hectares (38.8 million acres) sown
with winter grains in Russia, the Agriculture Ministry said
yesterday. Drought may persist in the U.S. Great Plains and
spread across  Texas  in the next three months, according to the
Climate Prediction Center.  “We are following the international prices as they are up
today on concern of dry weather,” Brink van Wyk, a trader at
BVG (Pty) Ltd., said by phone from  Pretoria .  South Africa is a net importer of wheat and sub-Saharan
Africa’s largest producer after  Ethiopia . The country imported
30,972 tons of the grain in the week to Jan. 18, Pretoria-based
South African Grain Information Service said in a statement on
its website today.  White corn gained 1.1 percent to 2,227 rand a ton, while
the yellow variety increased 1.1 percent 2,146 rand a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
