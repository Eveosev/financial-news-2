An Iranian court ruled that  Central
Bank  Governor Mahmoud Bahmani should be dismissed over illegal
movements of money in the banking system, a charge denied by the
central bank, state-run media reported.  The  Supreme Court  of Audit’s ruling isn’t final and Bahmani
has 20 days to appeal, while the government may oppose it and
force a review of the verdict, said Rahmatollah Sharifi, the
head of public relations at the court, according to the official
 Islamic Republic  News Agency  and Tehran-based  Donya-e-Eqtesad 
newspaper. The Central Bank denied that such a ruling had been
issued, according to the  Mehr  news agency.  Bahmani is accused of “illegal overnight withdrawal of
money from bank accounts to make up for the difference between
official and open market exchange rates,” IRNA said. The ruling
was issued after he failed to turn up for a hearing, the Tehran-
based  Etemaad  newspaper said today.  Iran ’s central Bank has come under criticism from members
of parliament for failing to stabilize the national currency,
which has plunged about 60 percent against the dollar in the
past six months. Inflation has quickened and the economy is
under strain amid tighter U.S. and European Union sanctions
aimed at curbing  Iran’s nuclear program .  Bahmani recently asked to retire from his post, Mehr
reported on Jan. 20 without saying where it got the information.
The governor said his request for retirement wasn’t “anything
new,” and that he’s currently “making all efforts to fulfill
his responsibilities,”  Fars  news agency reported today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
