BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the world’s
largest mining company, reported a 31 percent gain in copper
production at its Escondida mine in  Chile  in the last quarter on
higher grades and after completing a maintenance program.  BHP’s  production  from the mine, in which it owns a 57.5
percent stake, rose to 161,500 tons in the three months ended
Dec. 31 from 123,400 tons in the same period a year earlier, the
Melbourne-based company said today in a statement. Escondida,
which is located in Chile’s Atacama Desert, accounted for more
than half of BHP’s copper output in the quarter, according to
the statement.  “Production benefited from the transition to higher grade
ore feed and the successful completion of large-scale
maintenance programs,” BHP said in the statement.  The increase will help BHP meet its target for a 20 percent
gain in copper output from the mine in fiscal 2013, the company
said. BHP’s total copper output rose 5 percent to 295,200 tons
in the quarter, lower than the 303,000 ton median estimate from
three analysts compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
