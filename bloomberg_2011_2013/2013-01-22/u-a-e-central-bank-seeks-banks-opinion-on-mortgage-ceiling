The United Arab Emirates’ central
bank has asked the nation’s lenders for opinion on a planned
mortgage ceiling, the state-run news agency WAM reported.  The central bank sent a questionnaire to the lenders
requesting their opinion on loan-to-value ratios for individuals
buying their first and subsequent houses, WAM said citing the
document. It requested the banks to respond by end of January,
according to WAM.  The country plans to issue regulations governing the
mortgage market in six to nine months, central bank governor
Sultan Bin Nasser Al-Suwaidi said in comments published
yesterday in state-owned newspaper al-Ittihad.  The central bank last month notified the banks of a
decision to cap mortgages for foreigners and nationals at 50
percent and 70 percent of the property values respectively.  The directives were meant to “draw their attention to
certain standards that are expected to be adopted under the new
system,” Suwaidi said.  For Related News and Information:  To contact the reporter on this story:
