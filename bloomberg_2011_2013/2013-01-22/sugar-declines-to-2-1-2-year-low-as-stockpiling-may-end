Sugar fell to the lowest level in
more than 2 1/2 years in  London  as imports may decline after
consuming countries re-built stockpiles. Cocoa slid.  China  imported about 270,000 metric tons of sugar last
month,  data  from Beijing-based customs on Bloomberg showed. That
was down from about 490,000 tons in the same period a year
earlier. Chinese sugar imports are set to drop to 2 million tons
in 2012-13 from 4.2 million tons a year earlier,  according to 
the  U.S. Department of Agriculture . Russian imports will be
900,000 tons in 2012-13, up from 750,000 tons in 2011-12 while
still down from 2.5 million tons in 2010-11, when the nation was
the world’s largest raw sugar buyer, the data showed.  “Now that stocks have been rebuilt, producers are
beginning to ask who will buy their sugar in 2013,”  Jonathan Kingsman , managing director at researcher Kingsman SA, owned by
McGraw-Hill Cos., said in a statement e-mailed today.  White, or refined, sugar for March delivery fell 0.7
percent to $486.40 a ton by 11:24 a.m. on NYSE Liffe in London.
The price touched $486.20, the lowest for a most active contract
since July 2010. Raw sugar for March delivery was 0.4 percent
lower at 18.29 cents a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in  New York .  Millers in Brazil may make more ethanol at the expense of
sugar next year if the country’s government raises the price of
gasoline, potentially boosting demand for hydrous ethanol, which
powers the country’s fleet of so-called flex-fuel cars, and
increases the amount of anhydrous ethanol blended into gasoline.  Gasoline Prices  “The problem is that, for the moment at least, sugar still
pays better than ethanol,” Kingsman said. “The Brazilian
government is considering raising their domestic gasoline price
and, by extension, the price of ethanol, but are worried about
the negative effect that might have on domestic inflation. For
the moment the political decision-making process is blocked.”  Robusta coffee for March delivery was little changed at
$1,969 a ton on NYSE Liffe. Arabica coffee for March delivery
was 1 percent lower at $1.5475 a pound on ICE Futures.  Carryover coffee stockpiles in  Brazil , the world’s top
producer, were 28.4 million bags as of Jan. 1, Terra Forte
Exportacao e Importacao de Cafe Ltda. said by e-mail yesterday.
That compared with 23.75 million bags a year earlier. The figure
includes the government’s inventories, said Jayme Leme Neto,
export manager at the Sao Joao da Boa Vista-based exporter. A
bag of coffee weighs 132 pounds.  Cocoa for March delivery was down 0.3 percent at 1,479
pounds ($2,344) a ton in London. Cocoa for March delivery slid
0.8 percent to $2,267 a ton in New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
