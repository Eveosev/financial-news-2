Assurant Inc., the insurer of
foreclosed homes, said it recorded a $27 million pretax charge
in the fourth quarter tied to the 2007 acquisitions of two
mortgage insurance brokers in the U.K.  “Persistency rates of the acquired business declined
significantly following actions by an independent underwriter of
the business, resulting in the impairment charge,” New York-
based Assurant said today in a regulatory filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
