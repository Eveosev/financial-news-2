Colombia plans to sell 10-year bonds
abroad as soon as today in its first dollar offering in a year,
according to a person familiar with the sale.  The South American country plans to issue the securities to
yield 0.9 percentage point above Treasuries in a benchmark-sized
sale, said the person, who asked not to be identified because
terms aren’t set. The yield on Colombia’s bonds maturing in 2021
rose 0.05 percentage point to 2.39 percent after touching a
record low 2.22 percent in October, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. Benchmark typically means at least $500 million.  Banco Davivienda SA (PFDAVVND) , Colombia’s third-biggest bank, is also
selling bonds abroad. The bank may sell $500 million of five-
year notes to yield 2.25 percentage points above Treasuries,
according to a person familiar with the offering.  BBVA Banco Continental SA (CONTINC1) , a Peruvian lender, plans to sell
$300 million of bonds as soon as today, according to a person
familiar with the sale. The securities, due in 3 1/2 years, may
yield about 2.05 percentage points above Treasuries, said the
person, who asked not to be identified because terms aren’t set.  In  Mexico , retailer Grupo Famsa SA plans to sell $40
million of one-year bonds as soon as next week, said a person
familiar with the sale who asked not to be identified because
terms aren’t set.  To contact the reporter on this story:
