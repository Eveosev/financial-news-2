Copper reached a one-week high in
 New York  after the  Bank of Japan (8301)  said it will shift to open-
ended asset purchases to help spur economic growth.  Central bank officials voted to adopt a 2 percent inflation
target and will begin the asset purchases next year.  Japan  is
the world’s fourth-biggest user of the metal. Copper prices
climbed 6.3 percent last year as central banks in the U.S.,
Europe and China increased efforts to boost economies.  “Japan’s central bank pledged to do what’s needed to boost
economic growth, and that’s given everything a bit of a bullish
tone today,” Matt Zeman, a strategist at Kingsview Financial in
Chicago, said in a telephone interview. “The copper market is
looking pretty good right now.”  Copper futures for delivery in March rose 0.7 percent to
settle at $3.705 a pound at 1:17 p.m. on the Comex in New York,
after touching $3.7075, the highest since Jan. 11. Floor trading
was closed yesterday for the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday.  Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. (FCX) , the biggest publicly
traded producer, today reported fourth-quarter earnings that
beat analyst estimates as sales of the metal increased more than
expected.  On the  London  Metal Exchange, copper for delivery in three
months climbed 1 percent to $8,133 a metric ton ($3.69 a pound).  Aluminum, lead and zinc increased in London. Tin and nickel
fell.  To contact the reporters on this story:
