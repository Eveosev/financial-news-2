Deloitte LLP, administrators for  HMV
Group Plc (HMV) , said it remains “hopeful” that Britain’s biggest
seller of CDs and DVDs will survive after Hilco, a U.K. retail
restructuring firm, bought the chain’s secured debt.  Deloitte will “work closely” with Hilco “as we continue
to seek a positive outcome,” joint administrator Nick Edwards
said today in an e-mailed statement. “Stores continue to trade
and at this time we remain hopeful of securing a long-term
future for HMV.”  Deloitte is trying to stabilize Maidenhead, England-based
HMV while seeking a buyer after being appointed as administrator
last week.  HMV is among specialist U.K. retailers that have been hurt
by growing competition from supermarkets and Web retailers such
as  Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN)  The Jessops camera chain this month became
the first failure of 2013 when administrators shut all 187
stores. That followed the collapses last year of the Comet
electronics chain, JJB Sports Plc, Game Group Plc and Clinton
Cards Plc.  To contact the reporters on this story:
