Japanese  stocks  swung between gains
and losses before the  Bank of Japan (8301)  decides whether to yield to
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s demands for increased economic
stimulus and a doubling of its inflation target.  GS Yuasa Corp. lost 0.6 percent as it faces a second
government probe into batteries for Boeing Co.’s 787 Dreamliner
fleet. Kirin Holdings Co. climbed 4.2 percent after a report it
may sell its stake in Fraser & Neave Ltd. Fast Retailing Co.
climbed 1.6 percent after the Hong Kong Economic Journal
reported its Uniqlo clothing unit may list shares in the city.  The  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  slipped 0.4 percent to
10,705.53 as of the 11:30 a.m. trading break in Tokyo after
gaining 0.5 percent earlier. Volume on the Nikkei 225 was about
10 percent below the 30-day intraday average ahead of the BOJ
decision.  “The focus is on the BOJ decision,” said Takashi Miyazaki, a senior strategist who helps oversee about $70
billion at Mitsubishi UFJ Asset Management Co. in  Tokyo . “A lot
of the expectation has been priced into stocks already. If the
results fall below expectations then we’ll likely see a
correction, but the long-term trend is still up and investors
who were late in buying may support the market going forward.”  The broader  Topix Index (TPX)  retreated 0.5 percent to 900.6,
erasing earlier gains of 0.3 percent.  Japan ’s broadest equity
measure has risen about 25 percent since elections were
announced on Nov. 14 on optimism Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’ new
government will pressure the central bank to add economic
stimulus.  Economists’ Estimates  All 23 economists in a Bloomberg News survey said the BOJ
will announce additional asset purchases at the end of a two-day
meeting today, with a median estimate for a 10 trillion yen
increase. The BOJ will adopt Abe’s desired 2 percent inflation
target, all but 2 of the economists said.  “There’s a lot riding on the Bank of Japan meeting
today,”  Shane Oliver , Sydney-based head of strategy at AMP
Capital Investors Ltd. told Bloomberg Television. The firm
manages about $126 billion. “The change of economic policy in
Japan, the switch to much easier monetary policy, is a huge
positive.”  The Topix Index last week capped its longest weekly winning
streak since 1986. The Tokyo  Mothers Index (TSEMOTHR)  of emerging companies
yesterday recorded its highest close since March 9, 2011, before
a record earthquake and tsunami devastated northern Japan.  The Nikkei Stock Average Volatility Index fell 5 percent to
22.87, indicating traders expect a swing of about 6.6 percent on
the benchmark gauge over the next 30 days. The Topix is trading
at 1.07 times book value, compared with 2.04 for the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index and 1.6 for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
