Polish bond yields declined after
policy maker Andrzej Bratkowski said the central bank should cut
its benchmark rate by another percentage point in the coming
months.  The yield on notes maturing in April 2018 fell two basis
points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 3.53 percent by 4:01 p.m.
in Warsaw. The zloty weakened less than 0.1 percent to 4.1710
per euro.  Without further rate reductions the economy will
“stagnate,” Bratkowski said in an interview in Warsaw
yesterday. Governor Marek Belka said on Jan. 9 that a “certain
round” of monetary-policy easing may be coming to an end after
the bank shaved the main rate by a cumulative 75 basis points to
4 percent since November.  Bratkowski’s “comments may give an important impetus to
the rates market,” Aleksandra Bluj, an analyst at PKO Bank
Polski SA in Warsaw, said in an e-mailed note today.  Investors in the forward rate agreements market expect the
central bank will reduce borrowing costs by another 84 basis
points, based on a gap between nine-month contracts and three-
month Warsaw Interbank Offered Rate compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
