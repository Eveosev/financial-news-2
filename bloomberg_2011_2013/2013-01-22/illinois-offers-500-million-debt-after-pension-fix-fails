Illinois  plans to issue $500 million
of general-obligation bonds as soon as Jan. 30 in the first sale
since lawmakers failed to restructure the lowest-funded state
retirement system in the U.S.  The bonds will be offered by competitive sale, with
proceeds used for school construction and transportation
improvements, according to John Sinsheimer, the director of
 capital markets . It’s the first issuance this year by the state,
which may sell about $2 billion of debt in 2013, he said.  The yield penalty on debt sold by Illinois and its
localities widened to the most in a month since lawmakers ended
their 2012 session on Jan. 8 without acting to shore up the
state’s pensions. The  premium  to AAA munis grew to 1.47
percentage points on Jan. 18, the most since Dec. 12, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “The bidders are sophisticated buyers,” Sinsheimer said.
“We’ll be interested to see how the spreads come out.”  The bonds will have maturities ranging from one year to 25
years, according to Sinsheimer.  Illinois is the lowest-rated U.S. state by Moody’s
Investors Service at A2, five steps below Aaa. Moody’s, Standard
& Poor’s and Fitch Ratings all have a negative outlook on the
state, showing potential for further downgrades. Its pension
systems face a $97 billion unfunded liability that rises by $17
million each day.  The state’s plans have just 39 percent of the assets needed
to cover projected obligations for five major groups of public
employees, according to the Civic Federation, a Chicago-based
nonprofit research group.  To contact the reporter on this story:
