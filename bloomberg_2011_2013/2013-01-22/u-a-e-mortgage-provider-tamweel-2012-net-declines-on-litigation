Tamweel PJSC (TAMWEEL) , the mortgage provider
that  Dubai Islamic Bank PJSC (DIB)  plans to take over, said 2012
profit dropped 29 percent as it made provisions for litigations.  Net income for the year fell to 72.5 million dirhams ($20
million), or 7 fils a share, compared with 102 million dirhams,
or 10 fils a share, in 2011, the company said in a statement to
the Dubai bourse today. Total operating profit climbed to 603.3
million dirhams from 601 million dirhams in 2011, it said.  Profit declined because of “exceptional provisions
relating to certain ongoing litigations for which the company
made full provision while continuing to fight its rights,”
Tamweel said, without elaborating.  The company suffered after the 2008 property market crash
when house prices in Dubai plunged more than 65 percent. Real
estate prices started to rally in some areas in 2012 as tourism
and retail industries rebounded. The average sale price of a
mid-range villa soared 31 percent in the year to December, data
from property broker Cluttons LLC show.  Average home prices in the United Arab Emirates should
increase between 10 percent and 15 percent over an 18-month
period, Tamweel Acting Chief Executive Officer Varun Sood said
in the statement. Dubai Islamic Bank on Jan. 3 offered to take
over Tamweel through a share swap, four days after the U.A.E.
central bank issued guidelines restricting home loans.  Last year, Tamweel’s income from Islamic financing assets
and investing assets dropped 1.1 percent to 552 million dirhams,
the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
