Crude options volatility fell below
19 percent for the first time in at least six years as the
underlying futures continued to climb.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
March, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 18.54 percent on the New York Mercantile
Exchange as of 3:40 p.m., compared with 19.25 percent Jan. 18.  It was the first time that volatility for the front-month
options contract has dipped below 19 percent since at least
March 2006, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. April
options volatility slipped to 20.35 from 21.67 on Jan. 18.
Volatility for options on the rolling second-month contract was
the lowest since January 1996.  Oil futures for March delivery rose 64 cents to $96.68 a
barrel on the Nymex, the fourth straight increase. February-
delivery crude futures, which expire today, gained 68 cents to
$96.24 a barrel, the highest settlement since Sept. 17.  Rising crude prices have damped the enthusiasm of oil
producers who buy puts, or bets that prices will fall, said Jim Colburn, a vice president and energy options broker at Jefferies
Bache LLC in New York.  “The market has got quiet,” Colburn said. “There’s no
urgency to buy puts right now when we’re going higher.”  The most-active options in electronic trading today were
March $83 puts, which fell 5 cents to 6 cents a barrel on volume
of 2,929 contracts at 2:53 p.m. in New York. March $90 puts were
the second-most active with 2,366 lots. They declined 14 cents
to 35 cents a barrel.  Puts Volume  Puts accounted for 62 percent of electronic trading volume
