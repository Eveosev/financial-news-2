The U.S. Supreme Court left intact
federal limits on sulfur dioxide emissions from power plants and
other industrial facilities, turning away an appeal by a copper-
producing unit of  Grupo Mexico SAB. (GMEXICOB)   The justices today let stand a federal appeals court
decision that upheld a 2010  Environmental Protection Agency  rule
setting the acceptable limit for sulfur dioxide in the air at 75
parts per billion over a one-hour period.  Grupo Mexicoâ€™s  Asarco  unit argued unsuccessfully that the
limit would impose unreasonable costs, requiring companies to
spend $1.5 billion to comply. Another copper smelter,  Freeport-
McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. (FCX) , said in court papers that it will
have to spend hundreds of millions of dollars installing
pollution-control systems at its Miami facility.  Asarco operates a copper smelter in Hayden, Arizona.  Five states joined Asarco in challenging the rule at the
appeals court level. Only Asarco sought Supreme Court review.
The Obama administration urged the  high court  to reject the
appeal.  In tightening the sulfur-dioxide limits, the EPA pointed to
research indicating that even short-term exposure can lead to
respiratory illness. Power plants  account  for more than 70
percent of sulfur dioxide in the air, according to the EPA.  The case is Asarco v. EPA, 12-510.  To contact the reporter on this story:
