A measure of price swings in the
 exchange-traded fund  tracking developing-nation shares slipped
to the lowest level in at least 10 years as economic data from
the U.S. and  China  showed signs of improvement.  Fifty-day volatility on the  iShares MSCI Emerging Markets
Index  dropped to 11.59, the lowest level since at least January
2003, when Bloomberg started compiling the data. The ETF slipped
0.2 percent to $44.71 in  New York  today, declining for the first
time in three days.  China’s economic growth accelerated for the first time in
two years last quarter amid government efforts to revive demand,
data released Jan. 18 showed. In the U.S., initial jobless
claims for the week ended Jan. 12 fell to a five-year low,
pointing to further improvement in the labor market, while
housing starts climbed 12.1 percent in December. European
Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  said today that the
“darkest clouds” over the euro area have subsided.  “You’ve got increased global risk appetite on the back of
better Chinese news flow, better-than-expected U.S. data and the
fact that Europe appears to be stabilizing,”  Alec Young , a
global equity strategist at S&P Capital IQ, said by phone in New
York. “When there’s more nervousness around you see more
volatility, but it’s been nice and steady recently.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
