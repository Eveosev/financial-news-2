Sears (SHLD)  Holdings Corp.’s employee
pension fund sold a portion of the $250 million in company debt
that it bought more than two years ago to help fund lump-sum
payments to retires.  The Sears Holdings Pension Trust, overseen by the State
Street Bank and Trust Co., on Jan. 9 sold $10.25 million
principal amount of Sears 6.625 percent senior secured notes,
which mature in 2018, according to a paper filing last week with
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The  retirement plan 
filed to sell another $1 million of the bonds on Jan. 10, the
document shows.  The  Hoffman Estates , Illinois-based retailer disclosed in a
September filing that it would seek to increase the funding
level of its pension plan so that Sears could offer lump-sum
settlements to retirees under legislation adopted last year.
Sears said in that filing it would be “beneficial” to offer
such payments to reduce the company’s exposure to gross pension
obligations, which totaled $6.1 billion for the fiscal year
ended Jan. 28, 2012.  “We have to fund those lump sums for people who elected
it,” Chris Brathwaite, a Sears spokesman, said in a telephone
interview. “It’s not an indicator of the investment committee’s
view on the bonds.”  Billionaire  Edward Lampert , who together with his  hedge
funds  holds a 56.5 percent stake in Sears, is slated to take
over as chief executive officer next month. Sears, beset by
declining revenue, has been selling stores and other assets to
raise cash.  Sears Loss  Sears said on Jan. 7 that it will report a net loss of as
much as $360 million for the fourth quarter ended Feb. 2. The
results will include a $450 million noncash charge related to
pension settlements, tied to a voluntary offer to eligible
employees.  The pension fund received $9.74 million from the Jan. 9
bond sale, according to the filing, suggesting that the debt was
sold at a 5 percent discount to face value. The retailer’s 6.625
percent bonds traded at 95.375 cents on the dollar to yield 7.63
percent as of 4:19 p.m. today, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Sears issued $1 billion of the debt in 2010 after doubling
the size of the offering, and said at the time that it would
sell an additional $250 million of the notes to its domestic
 pension plan . The notes were priced to yield 451 basis points,
or 4.51 percentage points, more than similar-maturity
Treasuries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
