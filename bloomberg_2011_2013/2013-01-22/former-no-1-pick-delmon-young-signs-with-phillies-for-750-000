Former No. 1 draft pick  Delmon Young 
signed a one-year, $750,000 free-agent contract with the
Philadelphia Phillies after a season in which he helped the
Detroit Tigers reach the  World Series .  Young, 27, hit .267 with 18 home runs and 74 runs batted in
over 151 games for the Tigers last season. Young was voted the
Most Valuable Player of the American League Championship Series
and batted .313 with three homers and a team-leading nine RBI in
13 postseason games for Detroit, which lost to the  San Francisco
Giants  in the World Series.  Young was suspended by  Major League Baseball  for seven
games in May for yelling anti-Semitic obscenities during a
drunken altercation at a New York hotel.  The Phillies’ outfield lost Juan Pierre this offseason
after trading Shane Victorino and  Hunter Pence  in July. John Mayberry, Domonic Brown, Laynce Nix, Ben Revere and Darin Ruf
are other outfielders on the Phillies’ roster.  “Delmon is an experienced major-league bat who will add
some depth to our relatively inexperienced outfield and another
layer of competition for playing time there as well,” Phillies
General Manager Ruben Amaro Jr. said in a statement.  Young, the first pick in the 2003 first-year player draft,
is a .284 career hitter with 89 homers and 482 RBI in 880 games
for the Tampa Bay Rays, Minnesota Twins and Tigers. He received
a 50-game minor-league suspension in 2006 for throwing a bat at
an umpire following a called third strike.  The Phillies went 81-81 last season, when they traded
Victorino and Pence after falling out of playoff contention. It
was the first time in six years they missed the postseason.  To contact the reporter on this story:
