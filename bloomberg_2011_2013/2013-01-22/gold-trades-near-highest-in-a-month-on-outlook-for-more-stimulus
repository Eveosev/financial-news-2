Gold futures rose in  New York  after
the  Bank of Japan (8301)  announced stimulus measures, increasing demand
for the precious metal as a store of value.  The central bank said today it will buy about 13 trillion
yen ($146 billion) in assets per month from January 2014 and set
a 2 percent inflation target. Bullion gained 7 percent last year
as stimulus programs in the U.S., Europe and Japan enhanced the
appeal of the precious metal as an alternative to currencies.  “This is definitely bullish for gold,”  James Cordier , the
founder of Optionsellers.com in Tampa, Florida, said in a
telephone interview.  Gold futures for February delivery rose 0.4 percent to
settle at $1,693.20 an ounce at 1:44 p.m. on the Comex in New
York. Last week, prices jumped 1.6 percent and climbed to
$1,697.80, the highest price for a most-active contract since
Dec. 18. The exchange was closed yesterday for a public holiday.  India, the biggest bullion consumer in 2011, raised  import
duties  on gold and platinum to 6 percent immediately from 4
percent. Physical gold purchases will probably slow
significantly after being very strong early this year, said Nick Trevethan, senior commodities strategist at  Australia & New
Zealand Banking Group Ltd. (ANZ)   “We will definitely see the effect of this news on
physical demand,” Optionsellers.com’s Cordier said.  Silver futures for March delivery climbed 0.8 percent to
$32.177 an ounce in New York.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , platinum futures for
April delivery gained 1.5 percent to settle at $1,698.50 an
ounce. The metal has rallied 10 percent this month on concern
supplies will tighten. Anglo American Platinum Ltd., the world’s
biggest producer, said on Jan. 15 it will cut jobs and output in
 South Africa .  Palladium futures for March delivery rose 1 percent to
$729.90 an ounce on the Nymex, the highest settlement for a
most-active contract since Sept. 16, 2011.  To contact the reporters on this story:
