National Fuel Gas Co. (NFG) , owner of
utilities in Buffalo and Niagara Falls,  New York , rose the most
in more than 14 months after reporting company-record results
from wells in the Marcellus Shale of Pennsylvania.  National Fuel, based in Williamsville, New York, climbed
4.9 percent to $53.74 at the close in New York, the biggest
increase since Oct. 27, 2011.  Six gas wells completed on a pad in Pennsylvania flowed at
an average of 17.8 million cubic feet per day, with five of the
six having the highest peak production rates in the Marcellus
for the company, according to a statement today.  The wells are among 15 it expects to have producing into
its Trout Run pipeline system in  Pennsylvania  by the end of the
month, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
