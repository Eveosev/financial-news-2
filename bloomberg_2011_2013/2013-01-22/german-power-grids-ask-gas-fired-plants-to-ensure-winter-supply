German power-grid operators Tennet
TSO GmbH and TransnetBW GmbH asked four gas-fired plants in the
south of the country to secure transport capacity for the fuel
to avoid production outages that almost led to a collapse of the
electricity grid in February last year.  Tennet,  Germany ’s second-biggest network operator, asked
EON Kraftwerke GmbH, the fossil plant-unit of Germany’s biggest
utility,  EON SE (EOAN) , to make sure Irsching 5 and Franken 1 and 2 in
Bavaria are ready to produce power even if there are gas supply
bottlenecks.The plants have a combined net capacity of 1,669
megawatts, according to the company’s website.  “We have asked to secure transport capacities for
January,” Ulrike Hoerchens, a spokeswoman for Tennet, said
today by phone from Bayreuth, Germany. “At the end of the
month, we will review the situation.”  Last winter, the nation’s power grid was close to collapse.
Some gas plants hadn’t booked enough space in the gas grid to
secure around-the-clock delivery of the fuel and had to stop
generating gas as pipeline operators gave priority to those
units that had contracts for around-the-clock supply.  Southwestern German grid operator TransnetBW asked EnBW
Kraftwerke AG, the plant operating unit of Karlsruhe-based
utility  EnBW Energie Baden-Wuerttemberg AG (EBK) , to secure gas supply
for its 353-megawatt gas power plant RDK4 in Karlsruhe, Regina
Koenig, a spokeswoman for TransnetBW based in Stuttgart, said
today by phone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
