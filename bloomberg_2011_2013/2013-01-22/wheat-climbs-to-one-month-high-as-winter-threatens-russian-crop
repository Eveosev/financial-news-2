Soybeans surged to the highest in
more than a month as dry weather threatens crops in  South
America  and demand for U.S. inventories increases. Corn also
rose, while wheat fell.  Dry weather in soybean- and corn-growing areas of Brazil,
including  Rio Grande  do Sul and Parana, “bears watching,”
forecaster Telvent DTN said in a report today. U.S. exporters
sold 120,000 metric tons of soybeans to China, the Department of
Agriculture said in a report today. Since Sept. 1, China has
purchased 1.09 million tons from the U.S., the world’s biggest
shipper, for the current season and 300,000 tons for next year,
USDA data show.  “The weather in Brazil and most of  Argentina ” is boosting
prices, Tomm Pfitzenmaier, a partner at Summit Commodity
Brokerage in Des Moines,  Iowa , said by telephone. “We had some
Chinese purchases, so that’s supportive of prices.”  Soybean futures for March delivery gained 1.6 percent to
settle at $14.5175 a bushel at 2 p.m. on the  Chicago  Board of
Trade. The price earlier touched $14.6075 a bushel, the highest
since Dec. 19.  Corn futures for March delivery climbed 0.1 percent to
$7.285 a bushel on the CBOT. The price has advanced in 10 of the
past 11 sessions. The most-active contract has gained 4.3
percent this month. The exchange was closed yesterday for a
public holiday.  Wheat futures for March delivery fell 1.5 percent to
$7.7925 a bushel in Chicago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
