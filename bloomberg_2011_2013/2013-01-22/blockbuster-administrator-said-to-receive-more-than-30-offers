 Blockbuster Entertainment Ltd. has
generated more than 30 expressions of interest from retailers
and private-equity firms, said a person familiar with the
matter.  Deloitte LLP is still weeks away from a decision and there
is no front-runner for the U.K. DVD rental chain, said the
person, who declined to be identified because the matter is
private. The simultaneous search for buyers of  HMV Group Plc (HMV)  may
be slowing the process as firms bid for both companies, the
person said. Deloitte is also handling HMV’s administration.  Blockbuster last week became the third major U.K. retailer
this year to enter administration, a form of insolvency
protection. Deloitte is seeking a buyer for the 528-outlet chain
and has said at least 160 stores will be closed. More stores
closures are likely beyond those that are already planned, they
said. Savills has been appointed to advise on the company’s
store portfolio, it said today.  No one at Blockbuster U.K. was available for comment and a
spokesman for Deloitte declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
