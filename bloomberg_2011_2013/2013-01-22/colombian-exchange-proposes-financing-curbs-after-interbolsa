The Colombian stock exchange
proposed curbs stock-repurchase agreements after the nation’s
largest broker, Interbolsa SA, used them to finance bets on a
textile company and later collapsed.  The rules aim to reduce risk while boosting confidence and
liquidity, according to a draft posted late yesterday on the
website of the exchange,  Bolsa de Valores de Colombia SA .
Repurchase agreements on an issuer’s shares would be capped at
25 percent of shares in circulation, according to the draft.  “It’s completely normal after a financial crisis to have a
regulation that changes existing rules to avoid something
similar going forward,” Bolsa President Juan Pablo Cordoba said
today at a press conference in Bogota. “We’ll change them to
improve confidence and give more security to operations in the
market.”  The exchange is discussing the proposed rules with the
Finance Ministry, he said.  Interbolsa was seized by regulators after a liquidity
crisis when it was unable to secure funding to cover obligations
including stock-repurchase agreements on textile company
Fabricato SA, the brokerage’s chief executive officer, Rodrigo
Jaramillo, said Nov. 2.  To contact the reporter on this story:
