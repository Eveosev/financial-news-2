Most investors said it is premature
to immediately resume sales of inflation-indexed bonds because
they don’t expect enough demand from domestic investors,
according to Ministry of Finance officials.  The majority of institutional investors said they aren’t
considering buying the so-called linkers, the ministry officials
told reporters in  Tokyo  today. Some primary dealers, those
obliged to bid at the government auctions, suggested the
resumption of sales should be delayed until the second half the
fiscal year ending March 2014, according to the officials, who
spoke on condition of anonymity because of ministry policy.  A few dealers said there is some interest for linkers from
overseas investors, the official said. The ministry stopped
offering the notes in August 2008 because of falling demand amid
deflation.  Some participants saw scope for increasing issuance of 2-
year notes and 30-year bonds in the fiscal year starting April,
while others said there’s room to further expand debt offering
for 5- and 10-year securities, according to the Ministry
officials.  The government said on Jan. 15 it will sell 2.7 trillion
yen of 5-year notes per month in February and March, an increase
of 200 billion yen each month, and sell 2.4 trillion yen in 10-
year bonds in the two months, an increase of 100 billion yen
each month.  Japan ’s benchmark 10-year bond  yield  fell half a basis
point, or 0.005 percentage point, to close at 0.73 percent
today, according to Japan Bond Trading Co., the nation’s largest
interdealer debt broker.  To contact the reporters on this story:
