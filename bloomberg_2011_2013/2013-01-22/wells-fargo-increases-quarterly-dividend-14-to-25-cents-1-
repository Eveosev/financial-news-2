Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC) , the bank that
counts billionaire  Warren Buffett ’s company as its largest
shareholder, raised its quarterly dividend by 14 percent after
reporting a record profit for 2012.  The 3-cent increase brings the  payout  to 25 cents, the San
Francisco-based company said today in a statement. Investors who
own the stock as of Feb. 1 will be paid on March 1.  Among them is Buffett’s  Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A) , the Omaha,
Nebraska-based insurer and investment company that holds a  stake 
of about 8 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
higher dividend means another $50.7 million annually for
Berkshire, based on the 422.5 million-share stake listed as of
Sept. 30. The lender’s stock yields about 2.9 percent.  Wells Fargo said the new dividend was part of the bank’s
2012 capital plan, which passed Federal Reserve review last
year. U.S. banks this month are asking the Fed to approve a new
round of dividend increases and share buybacks, with Wells
Fargo’s plan submitted Jan. 4, the bank said.  Led by  John Stumpf , Wells Fargo is the biggest U.S. home
lender and the leader by stock-market value. The company
reported a record profit for 2012, with net income rising 19
percent to $18.9 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
