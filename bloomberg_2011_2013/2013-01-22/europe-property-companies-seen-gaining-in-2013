Publicly traded real estate
companies in  Europe  may have a 10 percent rise in net asset
value this year as their yields are at historic highs compared
with five- and 10-year corporate bonds and  U.K. government debt ,
Morgan Stanley analysts said.  Real estate equities have for the past 15 years typically
risen in value when property yields offer historically wide
premiums over corporate bonds and gilts, analysts including
Christopher Fremantle wrote in a research note yesterday.  “On the few occasions that the spread has been this wide
in the last 15 years, real estate equities have responded
positively in absolute share price terms,” the analysts wrote.  Morgan Stanley recommended investing in large diversified
U.K. real estate companies such as  Land Securities Group Plc (LAND)  and
 British Land Co. (BLND)  Major U.K. property companies have historically
led continental Europe “at inflection points in” NAV growth
and on average their debt matures later, the analysts wrote.  “We continue to believe in value stabilization during
2013” and “our confidence in NAV growth for the listed sector
is improving,” the analysts wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
