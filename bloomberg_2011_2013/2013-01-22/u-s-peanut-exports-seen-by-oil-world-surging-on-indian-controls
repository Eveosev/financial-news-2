U.S. peanut exports are forecast to
jump 83 percent in the current season as Chinese buyers turn to
American producers to replace Indian supplies, Oil World said.  U.S. shipments of peanuts, also known as groundnuts, are
predicted to climb to 350,000 metric tons in the 2012-13 crop
year through September, the Hamburg-based industry researcher
wrote in an e-mailed report today. That compares with 191,000
tons in the previous period.  India , the biggest exporter of the legume in 2011-12, has
implemented controls that will cause shipments to fall
“severely,” according to Oil World. Most of the nation’s
producers lack the food-safety systems required to meet new
standards for aflatoxin levels set by the government, it said.  “The Indian government’s decision to control exports of
groundnuts will have major repercussions on world trade,” Oil
World said. “We hear that demand from Chinese buyers has
shifted to the U.S. to at least partly compensate.”  India’s peanut exports are predicted to slump to 240,000
tons from 696,000 tons, according to Oil World. Deliveries by
 Argentina  may increase to 600,000 tons in 2012-13 from 530,000
tons, based on the report.  “U.S. groundnut exports to  China  were negligible in recent
years but are likely to increase massively in coming months,”
Oil World wrote. “Prices are likely to appreciate on the world
market, given that a large part of the supplies from the major
exporter India is withheld.”  Oil World said it expects “stiff competition” for peanuts
from other origins, primarily the U.S. and Argentina. Peanuts
were among commodities for which costs rose in the quarter
through October, Orrville, Ohio-based J.M. Smucker Co., whose
 Jif  brand is the leader in the U.S. peanut-butter market, said
Nov. 16 as it reported earnings for the period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
