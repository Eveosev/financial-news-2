Banco do Brasil SA , Latin America’s
biggest lender by assets, may disburse more than 1.5 billion
reais ($734.5 million) of loans for wind farms this year, up
from 1.3 billion reais last year, as the renewable energy
becomes cheaper.  The total amount will depend on how many wind developers
sign contracts to sell energy in government-organized auctions
for new power capacity this year, Renato Proenca, executive
manager of the commercial department for Brasilia-based Banco do
Brasil, said today in an e-mail.  Construction costs of wind farms have fallen in recent
years, making them more competitive with other sources of
energy, the bank said Jan. 18 in a statement.  “In the short to medium term, the expectation is that this
type of energy will increase its participation in  Brazil ’s
energy matrix by more than 6 percent,” Paulo Rogerio
Caffarelli, its vice president of wholesale, international
business and private banking, said in the statement.  The bank has lent more than more 1.5 billion reais to
hydroelectric projects since 2010, according to the statement.  Wind farms produce about 2 percent of Brazil’s power now,
up from 0.03 percent in 2001, Banco do Brasil said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
