The following is the text of
 Canada ’s retail sales report for November as released by
Statistics Canada.  Retail sales edged up 0.2% to $39.4 billion in November, a
fifth consecutive monthly sales gain. Higher sales at motor
vehicle and parts dealers as well as electronics and appliance
stores more than offset declines at most store types.  In volume terms, retail sales rose 0.8%.  Gains were reported in 4 of 11 subsectors, representing 32%
of retail trade.  Sales at motor vehicle and parts dealers rose 1.8% in
November. New car dealers (+1.6%) led the increase, rising for a
sixth straight month. Gains were also reported in the “other
motor vehicle dealers” industry (+3.9%) and used car dealers
(+3.9%). Automotive parts, accessories and tire stores declined
0.6%, partially offsetting the gain in October.  Sales advanced at electronics and appliance stores for the
third time in four months, rising 8.9%. Sales in this subsector
can be affected by the timing of new product releases. Despite
recent gains, sales in this industry for the first 11 months of
2012 were 5.1% lower than the same period in 2011.  Following three consecutive monthly declines, furniture and
home furnishings stores reported a 3.9% sales gain in November.
This increase came from higher sales at furniture stores (+3.5%)
and home furnishings stores (+4.6%).  Gasoline station sales declined 2.3% in November, mainly
reflecting lower prices at the pump.  Sales at building material and garden equipment and
supplies dealers (-1.4%) decreased for the fourth month in a row.  Food and beverage store sales decreased 0.3% in November,
after advancing for three straight months. This decline
reflected lower sales at supermarkets and other grocery stores
(-0.4%) and at convenience stores (-3.5%). Gains were reported
at beer, wine and liquor stores (+0.5%) and speciality food
stores (+1.1%).  General merchandise store sales declined 0.6%. Receipts at
department stores fell 0.7%, a third consecutive monthly decline.
Sales at “other general merchandise stores” decreased 0.5%.  Sales up in six provinces  Retail sales rose in six provinces in November. Ontario
(+0.4%) reported the largest gain in dollar terms, in part a
result of higher sales at new car dealers. This was the third
rise in sales in Ontario in four months.  Nova Scotia retail sales advanced 1.2% in November, more
than offsetting sales declines in September and October.  Retail receipts in British Columbia (+0.3%) and
Saskatchewan (+0.3%) increased following flat sales in October.  Sales in Alberta were relatively flat after four
consecutive monthly increases.  Following a 1.5% gain in October, sales in  Quebec  edged
down 0.1% in November.  New Brunswick (-0.4%) and Newfoundland and Labrador (-0.4%)
both reported a second decline in three months.  Note to readers  All the data in this release are seasonally adjusted and in
