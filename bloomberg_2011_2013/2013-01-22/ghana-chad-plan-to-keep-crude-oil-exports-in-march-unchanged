Ghana and  Chad  plan to keep exports
of their Jubilee and Doba crudes unchanged at three cargoes each
in March, according to loading program plans obtained by

grade, or 91,935 barrels a day, the plan showed.  Exports of Doba blend will also total three 950,000 barrel
consignments, a separate schedule showed. Exxon Mobil Corp.

compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to work
out their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
