Lithuanian prosecutors are
investigating claims that $13 million allegedly stemming from a
Russian tax fraud may have been laundered through  Ukio Bankas (UKB1L) ,
the  Baltic News Service  reported, citing prosecutor Donatas
Puzinas.  The probe was initiated in response to a request by
investment fund Hermitage Capital Management, where deceased
lawyer Sergei Magnitsky uncovered the alleged embezzlement, the
newswire said. Prosecutors have temporarily frozen offshore
accounts at Ukio containing 40,000 litas ($15,430), with only
incoming payments allowed, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
