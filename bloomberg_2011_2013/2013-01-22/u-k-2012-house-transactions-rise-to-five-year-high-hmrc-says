U.K. property transactions increased
by 5.6 percent last year to reach a five-year high, according to
the government’s tax office.  Completed house sales with a value above 40,000 pounds
($63,400) increased to 932,000 compared with 883,000 in 2011,
Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs Office said on its website
today. That’s the most since 2007 when 1.6 million transactions
were recorded.  To contact the reporter on this story:
