Saudi Telecom (STC) , the kingdom’s largest
telephone company, abandoned a plan to bid for  Iraq ’s fourth
mobile-phone license after delays in awarding the contract,  MEED 
reported, citing Ghassan Hasbani, the company’s chief executive
officer for international operations.  Saudi Telecom will only be interested in the license if it
receives “concrete” information from the government, Hasbani
