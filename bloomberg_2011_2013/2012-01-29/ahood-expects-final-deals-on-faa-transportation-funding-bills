U.S. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood said he expects Congress to give final approval to a
long-term authorization of the  Federal Aviation Administration ,
which has been on a temporary footing since 2007.  LaHood said he also is optimistic for agreement on a
transportation funding bill to be approved in the coming weeks.  He said Senate Majority Leader  Harry Reid  and House Speaker
 John Boehner  have reached an agreement on an FAA bill and he
believes Congress will pass it in a couple of weeks.  “The FAA is done, that’s a done deal, they’re going to
vote on it,” LaHood said while attending the opening of a car
exhibit in Dearborn, Michigan. “There is an agreement, it will
be a multi-year bill and we’re very happy about it.”  A bill to extend FAA programs through Feb. 17 -- the 23rd
extension since 2007 -- was approved Jan. 26 by the Senate on a
voice vote. The House passed an identical extension earlier this
week.  LaHood said the Senate soon will take up a transportation
funding bill which has been stymied by disagreements between the
House and Senate. He said Senators  Barbara Boxer , a California
Democrat, and  James Inhofe , an Oklahoma Republican, have put
together a two-year bill that the Senate will soon debate. He
said a transportation bill will be introduced in the House next
week.  “The president talked about a six-year transportation bill,
paid for, in the State of the Union,” LaHood said. “There are
a lot of moving parts here, things are moving.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
