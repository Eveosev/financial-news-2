Employers probably added workers to
payrolls in January, showing companies are gaining confidence
the U.S. expansion will weather  Europe ’s slump, economists said
before reports this week.  Employment grew by 150,000 after rising by 200,000 in
December, according to the median forecast of 68 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News. The jobless rate may have held at an
almost three-year low of 8.5 percent. Other reports may show
manufacturing accelerated this month and consumer confidence
picked up.  “The labor market is on firmer footing and manufacturing
entered the year more upbeat,” said Ellen Zentner, a senior
economist at Nomura International Securities LLC in  New York .
“Improvement in the labor market will go far in supporting the
economic recovery in 2012.”  More hiring and larger wage gains are needed to ensure that
consumer spending, which accounts for about 70 percent of the
economy, strengthens after growing at the weakest pace of any
post-World War II expansion. Concern that the jobless rate
remains too high is among reasons the  Federal Reserve  last week
said it will keep  interest rates  low for a longer period.  The Labor Department’s jobs report is due Feb. 3. Payroll
estimates in the Bloomberg survey ranged from increases of
100,000 to 225,000. The  jobless rate , which was 9.1 percent a
year ago, is projected to hold at the lowest since early 2009.  Seasonal Dismissals  The projected gain in January payrolls is smaller than the
prior month’s increase as economists, including Zentner,
forecast about 40,000 temporary holiday workers hired by
delivery companies like  United Parcel Service Inc. (UPS)  and  FedEx
Corp. (FDX)  were dismissed this month.  Private payrolls are forecast to rise by 168,000 in
January, after a 212,000 gain the prior month, the biggest back-
to-back gain since March-April, according to the survey median.
Manufacturing payrolls are forecast to rise by 11,000 after a
23,000 gain.  Norfolk Southern Corp. (NSC) , the second-biggest railroad in the
eastern U.S., said it plans to add to payrolls this year. The
Norfolk, Virginia-based company said it will hire more engineers
and mechanics, Chief Financial Officer James Squires said on a
Jan. 24 conference call.  With this week’s jobs report, the government will issue its
annual benchmark update, which aligns the data with corporate
tax records and covers the period from April 2010 to March 2011.
The Labor Department estimated in September that payrolls for
the 12 months would be increased by 192,000.  Economic Growth  The government last week reported the economy grew at a 2.8
percent annual pace in the fourth quarter after a 1.8 percent
gain in the prior three months. The growth rate excluding a jump
in inventories was 0.8 percent, the report showed.  Consumer spending  rose at a 2 percent pace last quarter,
less than the median forecast of economists surveyed. Household
purchases climbed 2.2 percent in 2011 after an increase of 2
percent in 2010, the weakest two-year performance of any
expansion since the end of World War II.  A report from the  Institute for Supply Management  on Feb. 1
will show its  factory index  rose to 54.5 this month, the highest
since June, from 53.9 in December. Two days later, a report from
the Commerce Department may show  factory orders  increased 1.5
percent in December after a 1.8 percent gain the prior month,
according to the estimates of economists surveyed.  Service Industries  Another survey from the Tempe, Arizona-based ISM on Feb. 3
may show a gauge of  non-manufacturing  companies, which make up
almost 90 percent of the economy, rose to 53.2 this month, the
highest since August, from 52.6 in December, according to
economists’ estimates. For both the ISM gauges, measures greater
than 50 signal growth.  Consumer confidence  has also picked up. The  Conference
Board (CONCCONF) ’s sentiment index rose to 68 in January from 64.5 the
prior month, according to economists’ estimates before the Jan.
31 report. That would be the highest level since February.  Consumer purchases rose 0.1 percent in December for a third
consecutive month, economists estimated the Commerce Department
will report tomorrow. Incomes rose 0.4 percent after a 0.1
percent gain in November, the survey showed.  Home prices  continue to fall as housing remains a weak link
in the recovery. The  S&P Case-Shiller (SPCS20Y%)  index of prices in 20
cities fell 3.3 percent in November from a year earlier,
compared with a 3.4 percent decline in the 12 months ended in
October, economists forecast the group will say on Jan. 31.
