Partner Communications Co. (PTNR)  and
 Cellcom Israel Ltd. (CEL)  led declines in Tel Aviv, narrowing the gaps
with their U.S.-traded shares, amid concern increasing
competition will erode profit.  The  shares  of Partner,  Israel ’s second-largest mobile-phone
company, slid to the lowest level in more than seven years,
dropping 3.3 percent to 29.60 shekels, or the equivalent of
$7.90, at 2:36 p.m. in Tel Aviv. The U.S.  shares  closed at $7.61
on Jan. 27. Cellcom  slumped  4.2 percent to 54.11 shekels or
$14.44, the lowest on record. The New York-traded shares closed
at $14.62.  “There is a negative sentiment in the whole
telecommunication sector following the increased competition on
the back of the regulation,” said Ilanit Sherf, an analyst at
Psagot Investment House Ltd. in Tel Aviv who has “sell”
recommendations on Partner and Cellcom.  Israel’s Communications Ministry, seeking to boost
competition in the mobile-communication and fixed-line markets,
has forced providers to cut interconnect fees and issued
licenses to new mobile-phone and virtual operators. The ministry
also is seeking to introduce a ‘‘wholesale’’ fixed- line market.
Citigroup Inc. last week recommended investors sell the shares
of Partner and cut price the estimates on both Partner and
Cellcom by more than 50 percent.  Bezeq Israeli Telecommunication Corp. (BEZQ) , the country’s
largest telecommunications company, headed for the lowest close
since March 2009, declining 2.8 percent to 6.32 shekels.  Hot
Telecommunication System Ltd. (HOT) , Israel’s second-biggest fixed
line operator, declined 2.4 percent to 42.94 shekels, the lowest
since October 2010.  Separately,  Globes reported  today that Ilan Ben-Dov, who
owns a stake in Partner through his holdings in Scailex Corp.,
may sell all his shares of Partner, without saying from where it
got the information. Scailex Corp. declined to comment on the
report in a statement read over the phone.  Scailex is owned 78.71 percent by Suny Electronic Ltd.,
which is 73.14 percent by Ben-Dov, and 3.59 percent directly by
Ben-Dov, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Scailex said
Dec. 26 it planned to sell part of its 44.54 percent stake in
Partner.  To contact the reporter on this story:
