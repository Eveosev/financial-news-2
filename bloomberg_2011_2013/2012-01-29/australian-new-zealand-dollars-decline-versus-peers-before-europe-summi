The Australian and  New Zealand 
dollars weakened as European Union leaders met to discuss the
region’s debt crisis at a summit in Brussels.  The so-called Aussie slid versus most of its 16 major
counterparts as concern increased Greek bailout negotiations
will hinder efforts to resolve  Europe ’s financial crisis. New
Zealand’s currency, nicknamed the  kiwi , halted its longest
advance in 10 months as Asian stocks fell, extending a global
slump in shares.  “We’re still quite a long way from solving the issues in
Europe, and market cynicism can certainly raise its ugly head
again,” said  Thomas Averill , managing director in Sydney at
Rochford Capital, a currency and interest-rate risk-management
company. “Before the Aussie and kiwi get some support again,
you’re going to need to see a bit of a dip.”  Australia ’s dollar declined 0.8 percent to $1.0577 at 11:05
a.m. in  New York , and slid 1.2 percent to 80.77 yen. New
Zealand’s currency fell 0.8 percent to 81.84 U.S. cents, ending
a six-day advance, the longest since March. It dropped 1.2
percent to 62.5 yen.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index lost 0.8 percent. The  Standard
& Poor’s 500 Index  dropped 0.8 percent and the Stoxx Europe 600
Index retreated 1 percent.  EU leaders met to put the finishing touches on a German-led
deficit-control treaty and endorse the statutes of a 500
billion-euro ($654 billion) rescue fund to be set up this year.
While Greece and its private creditors said Jan. 28 they expect
to complete a debt-swap deal to reduce the nation’s obligations
in coming days, it now requires 145 billion euros for the second
bailout, 15 billion euros more than was agreed in October,  Der
Spiegel  reported Jan. 28.  To contact the reporter on this story:
