Germany ’s Maria Hoefl-Riesch earned
her first  World Cup  victory of the season at today’s super-
combined event in St. Moritz,  Switzerland  to deny Lindsey Vonn a
third straight win.  Hoefl-Riesch, last season’s overall World Cup champion,
beat Vonn of the U.S. by 0.03 seconds, with  Austria ’s Nicole Hosp another 0.48 seconds back.  Vonn had won a super-combined and a downhill in the past
two days in St. Moritz to move to 49 career victories and
increase her lead in the World Cup standings.  The American, aiming for a fourth overall title, now leads
second-place Tina Maze of Slovenia by 387 points.  The men’s super-G race in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany
was canceled because of heavy fog.  To contact the reporter on this story:
