General Healthcare Group, the U.K.’s
biggest private hospital operator, has been forced to accept a
cut in fees from health-care group Bupa of as much as 6 percent,
the Sunday Telegraph said, without citing anyone.  General Healthcare, with 2.3 billion-pound debts ($3.6
billion), is facing pressure to restructure part of its loans,
the newspaper reported today, without saying where it had got
its information.  The private hospital operator generates enough cash to
cover all its capital needs, the paper said, citing Stephen Collier, its chief executive officer. He didn’t comment on the
reduction of fees, between three and six percent, that was
forced on the company by Bupa, the newspaper reported.  General Healthcare was “very pleased” about the three-
year agreement it signed with Bupa, the newspaper cited Collier
as saying.  For Related News and Information:  To contact the reporter on this story:
