Republican presidential candidate
 Newt Gingrich  said today that only a strong finish in Florida’s
primary election will save his “totally unique” campaign.  With his campaign down to about $600,000 after his South
Carolina primary victory, Gingrich, a former U.S. House speaker,
said he was trailing rival  Mitt Romney , a former Massachusetts
governor, among Florida’s early voters who cast ballots before
the Jan. 31 primary and needs a strong vote on election day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
