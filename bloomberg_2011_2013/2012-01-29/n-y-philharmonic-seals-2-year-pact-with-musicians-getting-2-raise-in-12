The  New York Philharmonic  and its
musicians agreed a two-year contract, which leaves pay unchanged
this season and raises it two percent for 2012 to 2013,
according to K.C. Boyle, the spokesman for  Local 802 of the
American Federation of Musicians .  Management “dropped its plans for drastic cuts to health
insurance and a radical reduction in pension benefits,”
according to a Jan. 28 statement from the musicians’ union that
didn’t include pay details. Eric Latzky, a Philharmonic
spokesman, didn’t return an e-mail for comment.  The Philharmonic, which was founded in 1842 and is the
oldest U.S. symphony, had $24 million of unfunded pension
obligations as of Aug. 31, 2011, according to its annual report.
Philharmonic net assets declined by $1.5 million last season to
$176.6 million.  Minimum pay for the Philharmonic is about $141,000,
according to a summary of the prior contract, which expired on
Sept. 20, 2011, and was posted on the Internet by the
 International Conference of Symphony and Opera Musicians . Boyle
couldn’t immediately confirm the minimum pay figure.  Stars of the Philharmonic, which counts  Credit Suisse Group (CSGN) 
AG as global sponsor, earn multiples of the minimum.  Glenn
Dicterow , violin soloist and concertmaster, got $519,000 in pay
and benefits in 2009-10, according to the orchestra’s tax
return. The principal trumpeter, French horn player, flautist
and cellist made from $325,000 to $385,000.  Alan Gilbert , named
music director in September 2009, had salary, fees and benefits
of $753,000.  The Philharmonic begins a European tour on Feb. 2,
performing a Beethoven violin concerto and Prokofiev symphony in
Cologne,  Germany .  To contact the writer of this column:
