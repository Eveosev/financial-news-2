Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) ’s head of wealth
management Pierre de Weck said he expects a flow of client money
back to  Germany  after a tax agreement with  Switzerland  comes
into force, Der Sonntag reported.  So far, he’s not seeing that happening, de Weck told the
newspaper in an interview. He also said the “white money”
strategy will only improve Switzerland as a financial center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
