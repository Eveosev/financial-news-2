Truett Tate, vice-chairman in charge
of client coverage at  Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY) , is unlikely to
survive a management shake-up led by Chief Executive Officer
Antonio Horta-Osorio, the Sunday Telegraph said, without citing
anyone.  The management changes, which was discussed at a board
meeting on Jan. 26 and is meant to reduce the number of people
reporting to Horta-Osorio, is expected to be announced as soon
as this week, according to the newspaper.  Nicole Sharp, a spokeswoman for Lloyds, declined to comment
