Itau Unibanco Holding SA (ITUB4) , Latin
America’s largest bank by market value, is considering
acquisitions in Latin America and the U.S., Chief Executive

and Mexico, and eventually Peru, Setubal  told  the newspaper in
an interview from Davos, Switzerland. An acquisition in the U.S.
also is possible, he said. The bank isn’t looking at Europe,
Asia or the  Middle East , Setubal said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
