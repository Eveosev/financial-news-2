Venezuelan President  Hugo Chavez 
appointed Vice President Elias Jaua as temporary agriculture
minister while Juan Carlos Loyo receives medical treatment.  Jaua won’t be replaced as vice president until August when
he starts his campaign for governor of Miranda state, Chavez
said.  “I am going to assume tasks that I assigned to you, Jaua,
when I became ill,” Chavez said today on state television
during his weekly “Alo Presidente” program. “I am going to
assume all of them while Jaua will be focused 99 percent on
agricultural issues.” Chavez didn’t indicate the nature of
Loyo’s medical treatment.  Chavez has said he will replace some members of his
cabinet, including Jaua, in mid-2012 as the officials prepare to
run for governorships in December elections. Chavez, who has
ruled  South America ’s largest oil producer since 1999, will seek
a third consecutive six-year term in presidential elections
scheduled for October.  Chavez, who had two operations in June in Cuba to remove a
cancerous tumor in his pelvic area, resumed normal activities at
the start of the year following four rounds of chemotherapy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
