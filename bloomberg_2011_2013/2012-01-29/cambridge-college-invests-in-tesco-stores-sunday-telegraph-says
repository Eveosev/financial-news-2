Trinity, the wealthiest college at
the U.K.’s  Cambridge University , bought a 50 percent share in a
group of 11  Tesco (TSCO)  Plc stores, the Sunday Telegraph reported,
without saying where it obtained the information.  The college purchased the outlets jointly with a Tesco unit
in a transaction funded through the issue of a 450 million-pound
($708 million) mortgage-backed security, the newspaper said.
Tesco, which aims to realize profit of 250 million pounds to 350
million pounds a year from property transactions, declined to
identify the third party, saying only that it is an “excellent,
experienced property investor,” the Telegraph reported.  The 11 stores involved in the deal are worth 440 million
pounds, according to the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
