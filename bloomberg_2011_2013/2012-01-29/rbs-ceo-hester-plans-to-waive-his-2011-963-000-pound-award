Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS) 
Chief Executive Officer  Stephen Hester  will waive his 2011
bonus, amid increasing pressure for him to forgo the award.  Hester, 51, has been at the center of a political furore
over executive pay since the announcement on Jan. 27 that he is
to receive 3.6 million shares on top of his 1.2 million-pound
($1.9 million) salary. RBS spokesman David Gaffney said by
telephone today Hester has decided not to accept the award.  The U.K.’s opposition Labour Party said earlier today it
would force a vote in Parliament over Hester’s bonus, which
would have increased the pressure on him to forgo the 963,000-
pound award.  RBS, which is 83 percent owned by the U.K., has fallen 35
percent in the past year and the state-controlled bank said this
month it plans to cut 4,800 jobs. Chairman  Philip Hampton  waived
a 1.4 million-pound shares award at the weekend.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
