The euro failed to extend last
week’s advance against the dollar before European Union leaders
meet in Brussels today to discuss the region’s debt crisis.  The yen maintained a two-day gain versus the 17-nation euro
as Italy prepares to sell bonds today after its credit grade was
downgraded by  Fitch Ratings . Demand for the euro was supported
amid speculation Greece and its private-sector creditors will
reach an agreement on a debt swap this week.  “Even with a resolution, the bottom line is that there’s
going to be tough medicine having to be swallowed by Europe,”
said Gavin Stacey, chief interest-rate strategist at  Barclays
Capital  in Sydney. “There is a greater risk of a pullback in
euro strength.”  The euro traded at $1.3213 as of 8:39 a.m. in  Tokyo  from
$1.3220 on Jan. 27 in  New York . It strengthened 2.2 percent
against the dollar last week. The common currency was little
changed at 101.40 yen, following a 0.1 percent drop on Jan. 27.
The dollar fetched 76.74 yen from 76.70.  Barclays’ Stacey predicts the euro will decline to $1.20 by
the middle of this year.  Italy  is scheduled to sell debt today maturing in 2016,
2017, 2021 and 2022.  Fitch cut the credit ratings of Italy, Spain and three
other euro-area countries on Jan. 27, saying they lack financing
flexibility in the face of the regional debt crisis.  Italy, the euro area’s third-largest economy, was cut two
levels to A- from A+. Spain was also lowered two grades, to A
from AA-. Ratings on Belgium, Slovenia and Cyprus were also
reduced, while Ireland’s was maintained.  Greece and its creditors are “close” to an agreement on a
debt exchange within a framework outlined by Luxembourg Prime
Minister  Jean-Claude Juncker , according to a Jan. 28 statement
from the  Institute of International Finance , which is
negotiating on behalf of private bondholders.  EU chiefs will meet in the Belgian capital today to put the
finishing touches on a German-led deficit-control treaty and
endorse the statutes of a 500 billion-euro ($661 billion) rescue
fund to be set up this year.  -- Editors: Benjamin Purvis, Naoto Hosoda  To contact the reporters on this story:
