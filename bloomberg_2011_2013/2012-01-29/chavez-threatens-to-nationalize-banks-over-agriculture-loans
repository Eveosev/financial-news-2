Venezuelan President  Hugo Chavez 
threatened to nationalize the country’s banks if they don’t hand
over 40 billion bolivars ($9.31 billion) that make up the
agriculture loans to be made in 2012.  Chavez, speaking on state television, cited Banesco Banco
Universal, BBVA Banco Provincial and Mercantil Banco Universal
for giving loans to industrial producers and not to small
farmers.  “If you don’t comply with this, I’m willing to nationalize
those private banks,” Chavez said.  Chavez asked Vice President Elias Jaua to meet with the
country’s bankers this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
