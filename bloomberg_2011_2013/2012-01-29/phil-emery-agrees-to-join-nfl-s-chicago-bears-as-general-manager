Phil Emery, director of college
scouting for the  Kansas City Chiefs , has agreed to join the
 Chicago Bears  as general manager.  Emery, who has worked in the National Football League for
14 seasons, succeeds Jerry Angelo, who was fired Jan. 3 after 11
years with the Bears. The team ended the season 8-8.  Emery was an area scout for the Bears from 1998-2004,
during which time the team drafted Pro Bowl wide receiver Marty Booker, linebackers Brian Urlacher and Lance Briggs, kick
returner Jerry Azumah, safety Mike Brown, cornerbacks Charles Tillman and Nathan Vasher and defensive tackle Tommie Harris.
Chicago won the National Football Conference Central in 2001.  Emery was director of college scouting for the  Atlanta
Falcons  between 2004-08 before going to the Chiefs for three
years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
