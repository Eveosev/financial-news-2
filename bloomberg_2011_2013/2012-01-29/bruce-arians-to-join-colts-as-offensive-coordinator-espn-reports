Bruce Arians is set to be named the
offensive coordinator for the  Indianapolis Colts , who are trying
to turn around after their worst season in 20 years, ESPN
reported, citing a person familiar with the transaction.  Arians, 59, held the same job with the Pittsburgh Steelers
until his contract wasn’t renewed after the past season, the
sports network said.  He will fly to Indianapolis tomorrow to sign the contract,
according to ESPN.  The Colts, without the direction of quarterback Peyton Manning who is recovering from neck surgery, ended the season 2-
14. Indianapolis has the first pick in the draft this year and
ESPN has said the Colts will take Stanford University
quarterback  Andrew Luck .  During Arians’s five years with coach  Mike Tomlin , the
Steelers shifted focus to passing to benefit quarterback Ben Roethlisberger, ESPN said. Steelers President Art Rooney II
wants the team to return to a blue-collar identity on offense,
ESPN reported, citing the person familiar with the move.  To contact the reporter on this story:
