Top-ranked Novak Djokovic has won
the third set of the Australian Open final and leads two sets to
one against  Rafael Nadal .  Djokovic won the second set 6-4 and the third set 6-2 after
Nadal took the opener 7-5. Nadal has a 133-1 record in Grand
Slam matches in which he has won the first set.  The three sets between the baseliners so far has lasted
three hours, 11 minutes. The first set alone was 1 hour, 20
minutes long -- two minutes shorter than the entire women’s
final yesterday in which Victoria Azarenka of Belarus defeated
Russian Maria Sharapova 6-3, 6-0.  Nadal, the No. 2 seed from  Spain , is trying to avoid
becoming the first man to lose three straight championship
matches in majors since tennis’ professional era began in 1968.
Nadal, 25, lost finals at Wimbledon and the U.S. Open to
Djokovic last year.  Djokovic, 24, from Serbia, is seeking his third Australian
Open title and is trying to join  Rod Laver , Pete Sampras,  Roger
Federer  and Nadal as the only men to win three Grand Slam titles  in a row since the Open era began in 1968.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
