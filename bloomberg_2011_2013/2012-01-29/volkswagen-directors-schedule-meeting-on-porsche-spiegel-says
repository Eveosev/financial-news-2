Volkswagen AG (VOW3) ’s supervisory board
scheduled an extraordinary meeting over a draft plan to combine
with Porsche SE’s automotive business,  Der Spiegel  said.  The directors will meet on Feb. 14, the magazine said in a
preview of an article for its next edition. Germany’s  Finance
Ministry  already has the draft plan, under which Volkswagen will
pay 3.9 billion euros ($5.1 billion) plus tax, Der Spiegel said.  The plan would incur a “low three-digit million” amount
in tax for Volkswagen, instead of the 1 billion euros previously
envisaged, according to the magazine.  Volkswagen doesn’t comment on possible company meetings,
spokeswoman  Christine Ritz  said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
