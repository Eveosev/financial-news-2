Top-ranked Novak Djokovic has won
the second set to even up his Australian Open final against
 Rafael Nadal .  Djokovic won the second set 6-4 after Nadal took the
opening set 7-5. The second set ended on a double fault by
Nadal, who earlier saved three set points.  The two sets between the baseliners has lasted two hours,
26 minutes. The first set alone was 1 hour, 20 minutes long --
two minutes shorter than the entire women’s final yesterday in
which Victoria Azarenka of Belarus defeated Russian Maria
Sharapova 6-3, 6-0.  Nadal has a 133-1 record in Grand Slam matches in which he
has won the first set.  Nadal, the No. 2 seed from  Spain , is trying to avoid
becoming the first man to lose three straight championship
matches in majors since tennis’ professional era began in 1968.
Nadal, 25, lost finals at Wimbledon and the U.S. Open to
Djokovic last year.  Djokovic, 24, from Serbia, is seeking his third Australian
Open title and is trying to join  Rod Laver , Pete Sampras,  Roger
Federer  and Nadal as the only men to win three Grand Slam titles  in a row since the Open era began in 1968.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
