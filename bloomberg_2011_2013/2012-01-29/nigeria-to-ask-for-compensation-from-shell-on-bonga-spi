     Jan. 29 (Bloomberg)-- Nigeria will “soon” ask for
compensation for an  oil spill  from  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) ,
Europe’s largest oil company, President  Goodluck Jonathan  said.  A spill last month from the 200,000 barrel-a-day Bonga
field off Nigeria, which produces nearly 10 percent of Nigeria’s
crude, led Shell to stop production from the facility, the
company said on Dec. 21. The export line at Bonga leaked almost
40,000 barrels of crude during a tanker loading, according to
Shell estimates, making it Nigeria’s worst offshore spill in
more than a decade.  Nigeria will be asking for compensations “with a view to
reaching an amicable solution to the problem,” Jonathan said in
a meeting with Ban Ki-Moon, the United Nations secretary-
general, on the sidelines of the 18th African Union Ordinary
Session of the heads of state and governments in  Addis Ababa ,
the Ethiopian capital, according to a statement e-mailed today.  A phone call by Bloomberg to Shell’s office in Lagos,
Nigeria, after hours was unanswered, and there was no answer at
the mobile phone number of a company spokesman  To contact the reporter on this story:
