Wegelin & Co.’s owners got between
500 million Swiss francs ($548 million) and 600 million francs
in the sale of the Swiss private bank to Raiffeisen Group, Der
Sonntag reported, without saying where it got the information.  The bank’s partners decided on the sale because clients
were withdrawing funds over the last weeks, the newspaper said,
citing unidentified bankers. Joerg Denzler, a spokesman for
Wegelin, declined to comment on the article when contacted by
Bloomberg News.  Konrad Hummler, Wegelin’s managing partner, told Sonntag in
an interview that the bank was “a victim of a bigger affair”
and the sale was “the right solution at the right moment”
though he’s not “triumphant.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
