French banks intend to cut bonus
payments for 2011 by between 40 percent and 50 percent,  Le
Journal du Dimanche  reported, without saying where it obtained
the information.  BNP Paribas SA (BNP@FP) , with about 3,000 traders, has allocated 500
million euros ($659 million) for payouts, down from 1 billion
euros a year earlier, according to the report.  Societe Generale
SA (GLE)  will probably reduce its budget to 400 million euros from 730
million euros, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
