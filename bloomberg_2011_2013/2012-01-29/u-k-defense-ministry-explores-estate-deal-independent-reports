The U.K. Ministry of Defence has
started to discuss the management of its property and
infrastructure worth 20 billion pounds ($31 billion) with about
12 companies, the Independent on Sunday reported, without saying
where it got the information.  Britainâ€™s government wants a minimum of one private partner
to look after its defense structure while the ministry is
reorganized, the paper reported, without citing anyone. Bidding
for the contract is expected to begin within three months, the
newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
