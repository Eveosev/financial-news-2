Twenty-seven Egyptian political
parties and organizations called on the ruling military council
to move up the date for registration for the first presidential
elections since the ouster of  Hosni Mubarak .  The groups want registration to start on Feb. 11 instead of
April 15, the state-run Middle East News Agency reported, citing
a joint statement. Balloting should take place within 60 days
from the start of registration, the groups said in the
statement, MENA said.  The organizations include the April 6 Youth Movement, one
of the groups that organized the anti-Mubarak uprising, and the
Islamist Wasat party. The new parliament, which held its first
session on Jan. 23, is dominated by the Muslim Brotherhoodâ€™s
Freedom & Justice Party and the Islamist Nour party, which were
not signatories to the statement.  Thousands of protesters have been demonstrating in a number
of cities around  Egypt , including Cairo, since Jan. 25, which
marked the first anniversary of uprisings that led to the
downfall of Mubarak. Many of the protesters are demanding
earlier presidential elections. The ruling military council has
said it will transfer power to civilians once the president has
been elected.  To contact the reporters on this story:
