Rafael Nadal  has won the fourth set
of the Australian Open final, evening his match with top-ranked
Novak Djokovic at two sets apiece.  The second-seeded Nadal won the fourth set 7-6 (7-5) after
Djokovic won the second set 6-4 and the third set 6-2. Nadal
took the opener 7-5. Nadal has a 133-1 record in Grand
Slam matches in which he has won the first set.  The match between the baseliners so far has lasted
four hours, 40 minutes, including a 10-minute rain delay. The
first set alone was 1 hour, 20 minutes long -- two minutes
shorter than the entire women’s final in which Victoria Azarenka
of Belarus defeated Russian Maria Sharapova 6-3, 6-0.  Nadal, from  Spain , is trying to avoid becoming the first
man to lose three straight championship matches in majors since
tennis’ professional era began in 1968. Nadal, 25, lost finals
at Wimbledon and the U.S. Open to Djokovic last year.  Djokovic, 24, from Serbia, is seeking his third Australian
Open title and is trying to join Rod Laver,  Pete Sampras ,  Roger
Federer  and Nadal as the only men to win three Grand Slam titles
in a row since the Open era debuted in 1968.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
