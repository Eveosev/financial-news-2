South Africa  should place all state-
owned enterprises under one ministry if it wants to fulfill the
ruling African National Congress’s vision of a developmental
state focused on growth, the Sunday Times said, citing Public
Enterprises Minister  Malusi Gigaba .  Gigaba, whose ministry is in charge of power utility Eskom
Holdings SOC Ltd. and ports and railway operator Transnet SOC
Ltd., said the matter needs to be resolved through discussion,
the Johannesburg-based  paper  said. The department of public
enterprises controls eight of the country’s 300 to 500 state-
owned enterprises, the paper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
