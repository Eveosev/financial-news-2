Malcolm Walker , chief executive
officer of Iceland Foods Ltd., secured the backing of Canadian
pension fund Alberta Investment Management Corp. to finance a 1
billion pound ($1.6 billion) bid for the U.K. budget grocery
chain, the Sunday Times said, citing an interview with Walker.  “If I can buy the business with my management team, I will
do that at the right price,” he was quoted as saying by the
newspaper. “If not, we’ll sell our shares and move on.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
