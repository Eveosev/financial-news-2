Unipol Gruppo Finanziario SpA (UNI) ,
 Italy ’s third-biggest insurer, plans to raise as much as 1.1
billion euros ($1.45 billion) by selling new shares as it seeks
to merge with rivals to become the No. 2.  Unipol agreed to buy new shares in  Premafin Finanziaria
SpA (PF) , the controlling investor in the country’s second-biggest
insurer,  Fondiaria-SAI SpA (FSA) , the Bologna, Italy-based company
said in a stock-exchange statement yesterday. Unipol will buy
the shares in Premafin through a capital increase reserved to it
for as much as 400 million euros.  Unipol signed a letter of intent on Jan. 13 to take control
of Premafin and merge with unprofitable Fondiaria and its unit
 Milano Assicurazioni SpA. (MI)  Under the plan approved yesterday,
Unipol will finance Premafin through the capital increase so it
can participate in Fondiaria’s share sale.  “There are some potential benefits to the industrial
integration of the groups given the significant opportunities to
extract cost synergies and benefit from economies of scale,”
Alberto Villa, an analyst at Intermonte SIM SpA, wrote in a Jan.
19 report.  The merger among the four companies will help Fondiaria to
boost capital after the Florence-based insurer said Sept. 23
that it expects to report a net loss in 2011 of about 925
million euros. The company’s solvency ratio is about 90 percent,
below the European regulator’s minimum requirement of 100
percent.  The transaction is conditional on approval by the Italian
insurance regulator Isvap, stock market watchdog Consob and the
antitrust agency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
