GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK) , the U.K.’s
largest drugmaker, is seeking an acquisition in Turkey as it
struggles to become profitable in the country,  Hurriyet  said,
citing the company’s emerging markets president.  Potential targets include producers of cardiovascular drugs
or businesses with production facilities that would add value to
Glaxo’s operations, Hurriyet cited Abbas Hussain as saying.  Glaxo has failed to make a profit or increase revenue in
Turkey in the past three years as a result of the country’s drug
pricing policy, which has caused the company to cut costs and
refrain from adding staff, Abbas told the newspaper. The
drugmaker remains upbeat on its prospects there, he said.  Glaxo is evaluating options and many companies in  Turkey 
fit its criteria, though finding one that’s for sale is
difficult, Hurriyet cited Abbas as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
