Walter Kielholz, a  Credit Suisse
Group AG (CSGN)  board member and its former chairman, said there is no
“cheap solution” to the dispute with the U.S. about undeclared
bank accounts,  SonntagsZeitung  reported.  Switzerland won’t be able to avoid further “weakening” of
banking secrecy practices and banks will probably have to pay
“high amounts,” Kielholz told the newspaper in an interview.  Kielholz also said that he expects Swiss banks to cut
“several thousands” of jobs to reduce costs and that bonuses
will fall as much as 50 percent, with  investment banking 
affected the most, the newspaper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
