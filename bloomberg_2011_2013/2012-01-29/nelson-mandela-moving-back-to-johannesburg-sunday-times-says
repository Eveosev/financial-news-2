Nelson Mandela ,  South Africa ’s first
black president, is moving back to Johannesburg today after
spending several months at his house in Qunu in the Eastern Cape
province, Sunday Times reported, citing Presidential Spokesman
Mac Maharaj.  Mandela, who was hospitalized in January last year for an
acute respiratory infection, is in good health, the
Johannesburg-based  paper  quoted Maharaj as saying. Mandela is
moving to the city as “routine maintenance” will be undertaken
at his Qunu home, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
