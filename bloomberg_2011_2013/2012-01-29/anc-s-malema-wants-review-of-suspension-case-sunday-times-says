Julius Malema , the suspended
president of the youth wing of South Africa’s ruling African
National Congress, wants his case referred back to the party’s
national disciplinary committee for review, the  Sunday Times 
said, citing people it didn’t identify.  Malema and his fellow suspended leaders, who have been
calling for the nationalization of the country’s mines, want the
opportunity to discuss mitigating factors, the newspaper said.
An appeal is under consideration by the ANC’s appeals committee,
led by businessman  Cyril Ramaphosa , the Sunday Times said.  The Youth League leaders were found guilty last year of
sowing division and bringing the ANC into disrepute.  To contact the reporter on this story:
