Dany Bahar, chief executive officer
of Group Lotus PLC, is looking for investors to help him buy the
Norwich, U.K.-based luxury sports cars company, the Sunday Times
said, without citing anyone.  Bahar, who is seeking a backer who could provide 500
million pounds ($786 million) in debt, may compete with Genii
Capital, the Luxembourg-based investment firm that already owns
the Lotus Formula One team, the newspaper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
