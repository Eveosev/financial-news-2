Volker Kauder , the floor leader for
German Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s Christian Democrats, blocked a
plan to put unused funds from the euro region’s financial
backstop into its permanent successor,  Bild am Sonntag  reported.  Merkel wanted to endorse combining the lending power of the
European Financial Stability Facility and the 500 billion-euro
($659 billion) European Stability Mechanism, the euro region’s
future permanent financial backstop. Christian Democrat members
of parliament opposed the move because Germany then would be
liable for more than the 211 billon euros originally approved,
prompting Merkel to drop the plan, BamS said, citing parliament
members it didn’t name.  To contact the reporter on this story:
