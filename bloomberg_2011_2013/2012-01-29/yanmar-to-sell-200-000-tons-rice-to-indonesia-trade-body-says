Myanmar agreed to sell 200,000
metric tons of white rice to  Indonesia â€™s state food agency
Bulog, the Myanmar Rice Industry Association said.  Exports of the grain will begin in February, the
association said in a statement e-mailed today. That will be the
first shipment to Indonesia since exports to the Southeast Asian
buyer were halted more than 10 years ago, the association said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
