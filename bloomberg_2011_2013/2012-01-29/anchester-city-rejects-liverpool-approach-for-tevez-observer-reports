Manchester City  rejected an approach
for  Carlos Tevez  from Premier League rival Liverpool, which was
prepared to offer its record signing Andy Carroll in a swap,  the
Observer reported .  Liverpool, which signed Carroll from Newcastle a year ago
for 35 million pounds ($55 million), made the proposal on Jan.
26 but it was immediately rejected by City, the newspaper said,
without citing anyone.  Tevez, valued by City at 25 million pounds, is likely to
remain with the club for the rest of the season according to his
adviser Kia Joorabchian, the Observer reported.  City remains open to offers for its Argentina striker who
has now been on strike for 11 weeks, the newspaper said.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
