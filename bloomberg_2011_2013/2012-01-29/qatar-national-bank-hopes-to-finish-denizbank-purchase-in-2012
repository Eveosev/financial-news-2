Qatar National Bank SAQ (QNBK) , the Persian
Gulf country’s largest lender, “hopes” to complete the
purchase of Turkey’s  Denizbank AS (DENIZ)  this year if “the price is
right,” the chairman said.  “The negotiations are going on and to have a bank of that
size, you need a lot of offers,” Yousef Hussain Kamal told
reporters at the bank’s general assembly.  Qatar National is the last serious bidder for Denizbank
after the withdrawal of HSBC Holdings Plc and OAO Sberbank,
people familiar with the process said earlier this month.  “You will have to ask the seller,” Kamal said when asked
if Qatar National is the sole bidder.  Denizbank is the latest lender struggling to find buyers as
the region’s fiscal woes continue and some of the world’s
largest financial institutions seek to raise cash by divesting
units and portfolios. Lenders including Deutsche Bank AG and
 France ’s Societe Generale SA have announced plans to shed more
than $1 trillion in assets, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  “We are in negotiations to buy a bank in Turkey that will
cost us a lot,” Kamal told shareholders during the assembly.
“I cannot acquire that bank if I distributed more profit than
necessary.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
