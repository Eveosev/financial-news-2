French President  Nicolas Sarkozy 
said the euro-region’s financial crisis is stabilizing thanks to
measures taken by European leaders.  “We can say -- with caution -- that we see elements of
financial stability in  France , in  Europe  and in the world,”
Sarkozy said in a nationally televised interview in Paris today.
“Europe is no longer at the edge of the cliff.”  The comments came on the eve of a European Union summit in
Brussels where where leaders are set to put the finishing
touches on a German-led deficit-control treaty and endorse the
statutes of a 500 billion-euro ($661 billion) rescue fund to be
set up this year.  Greece  and its private creditors said Jan. 28 they expect
to complete a deal in coming days after bondholders signaled
they would accept European government demands for a bigger cut
in debt holdings.  Efforts to hold the 17-member euro area together come
against a deteriorating economic outlook, with the euro economy
set to contract by 0.5 percent this year, according to the
median of 19 economist forecasts compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
