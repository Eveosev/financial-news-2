AstraZeneca Plc (AZN) , the U.K.â€™s second-
biggest drugmaker, is set to announce more job cuts after
beginning a cost-cutting program in 2010, the Sunday Times
reported today, without citing anyone.  Two years ago, chief executive  David Brennan  said more than
10,000 jobs would be lost by 2014, the newspaper said. The
target may be extended significantly when the company announces
its annual results on Feb. 2, the newspaper said. The drugmaker
may spend more than $3 billion on buying back shares this year,
the paper said, citing analysts.  AstraZeneca declined to comment, the newspaper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
