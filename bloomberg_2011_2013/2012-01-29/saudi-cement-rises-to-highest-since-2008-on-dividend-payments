Saudi Cement Co. (SACCO)  rose to the highest
level since July 2008 after  Saudi Arabia â€™s largest producer of
the building material by market value recommended paying a
better-than-expected second-half cash dividend.  The  shares  gained 5.1 percent to 77 riyals at 11:59 a.m. in
Riyadh. They earlier rose as much as 7.2 percent.  The board of the Dammam, Saudi Arabia-based company
proposed a second-half  dividend  of 4.5 riyals a share after
paying 2 riyals for the first six months, it said in a statement
after the market closed yesterday. The company paid a dividend
of 4 riyals in 2010, according to data posted on the  Saudi
bourse website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
