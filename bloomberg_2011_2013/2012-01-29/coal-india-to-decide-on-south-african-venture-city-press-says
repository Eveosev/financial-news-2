producer of the fuel, will decide tomorrow whether to proceed
with a joint venture with the government of  South Africa ’s
Limpopo province, Johannesburg-based  City Press  reported without
saying where it got the information.  The deal to mine coal in the province will be signed in
March, pending approval by the company’s board, the paper said.
The Limpopo provincial government, which was placed under
administration by the national government due to financial
mismanagement, will hold a 26 percent stake in the venture, it
