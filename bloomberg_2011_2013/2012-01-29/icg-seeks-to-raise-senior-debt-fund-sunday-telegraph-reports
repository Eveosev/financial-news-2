Intermediate Capital Group Plc, (ICP) 
 Europe ’s largest provider of debt for leveraged buyouts, plans
to raise a senior-debt fund from institutional investors, the
Sunday Telegraph reported, citing the company.  Intermediate Capital, which manages 12 billion euros ($15.9
billion), said it’s “actively considering” the plan, according
to the newspaper. It would be the first time the debt provider
has raised a senior-debt fund and reflects the withdrawal of
banks from the buyout market, the newspaper said.  A spokesman for Intermediate Capital said a decision would
be made “reasonably shortly,” the Telegraph reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
