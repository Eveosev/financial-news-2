Iran ’s parliament drafted
legislation calling for the government to halt oil exports to
 Europe  until the European Union cancels its planned ban on the
country’s crude,  Fars  news agency reported, citing a lawmaker.  The bill would also require Iran to embargo imports from
countries participating in the EU ban, Nasser Sodani, the deputy
head of the parliament’s energy commission, said yesterday,
according to the state-run news agency. Iranian lawmakers
planned to debate the bill in parliament today, Fars reported on
Jan. 27.  The EU decided last week to stop importing Iranian oil from
July 1, raising pressure on the nation over its nuclear program.
The bloc postponed its ban to give members including Greece and
Italy time to find alternative suppliers. Iranian officials have
threatened to retaliate by disrupting shipping in the  Strait of
Hormuz , a conduit for 20 percent of global oil. Europe is Iran’s
No. 2 customer after  China , taking 450,000 barrels of Iranian
crude a day, according to the U.S. Energy Department.  “If we are supposed to pay the cost of these sanctions in
six months, then let Europe deal with an increase in oil prices
and pay the cost right now,” Mohammad Reza Bahonar, Iran’s
deputy parliamentary speaker, said yesterday, according to the
state-run  Mehr  news agency.  Iran is the second-largest producer in the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries after  Saudi Arabia , pumping 3.575
million barrels a day of crude in December, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg News.  To contact the reporter on this story:
