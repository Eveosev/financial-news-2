JSE Ltd. (JSE) , the operator of South
Africa’s stock exchange, is in talks with exchanges in Brazil,
Russia, India and China to expand its products and increase the
number of foreign listings,  City Press  reported, citing Chief
Executive Officer Nicky Newton-King.  China is “likely to yield interesting prospects,” while
India may pose regulatory hurdles, he said, according to the
Johannesburg-based. The JSE will continue to seek technical co-
operation with other African exchanges, and the Nigerian  capital
markets  show good prospects, she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
