Ryanair Holdings Plc (RYA)  plans to return
profit to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks in
2013 and 2014 as it keeps its fleet at current levels, the
Sunday Times reported, citing an interview with Chief Executive
Officer  Michael O’Leary .  The Dublin-based carrier will have no new planes next year
or in 2014 “no matter what happens,” the newspaper said,
citing O’Leary. That will allow Ryanair to generate 800 million
euros ($1.06 billion) in “free cash” annually that can be
returned to shareholders, O’Leary said in the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
