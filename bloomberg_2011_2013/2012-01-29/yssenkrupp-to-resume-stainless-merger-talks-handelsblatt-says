ThyssenKrupp AG (TKA)  will resume talks on
merging its Inoxum stainless unit with  Outokumpu Oyj (OUT1V)  tomorrow,
Handelsblatt reported, citing unidentified people close to the
negotiations.  A first round of talks that began Jan. 27 ended without an
agreement, the newspaper said. As part of the deal, ThyssenKrupp
is asking Outokumpu to keep Inoxum’s German plants open,
Handelsblatt said in a preview of an article for tomorrow’s
edition.  Outokumpu values the ThyssenKrupp unit at 2.5 billion euros
($3.3 billion), according to Handelsblatt.  -- Editors:  To contact the reporter on this story:
