Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) , the worldâ€™s
largest retailer, may be interested in  Carrefour SA (CA)  stores
should the French retailer decide it needs to sell outlets, the
Independent on Sunday said, citing a person close to Wal-Mart.  Steuart Walton, a grandson of Wal-Mart founder Sam Walton,
is leading a European expansion drive and is keeping tabs on the
difficulties faced by Carrefour, which is said to be close to
hiring a successor to Chief Executive Officer Lars Olofsson, the
newspaper reported, without saying where it got the information.  To contact the reporter on this story:
