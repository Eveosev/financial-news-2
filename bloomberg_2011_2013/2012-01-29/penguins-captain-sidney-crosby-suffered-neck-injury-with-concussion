Pittsburgh Penguins captain  Sidney Crosby , who hasn’t played since Dec. 5, had a neck injury in
addition to a concussion, the National Hockey League team said.  Crosby will be checked by specialists during the next few
days, the team said yesterday. Dr. Robert S. Bray, a
neurological spine specialist based in  Los Angeles , discovered
the neck injury in addition to a concussion.  “Dr. Bray reports that the neck injury is fully healed,”
the team said yesterday.  Crosby, 24, has been skating and working out for the past
week. The Penguins, who own third place in the Eastern
Conference’s five-team Atlantic Division, have won seven
straight games.  “The most important goal all along has been Sidney’s
return to full health, and we are encouraged that progress
continues to be made,” the team said.  Crosby sustained back-to-back head injuries in the Winter
Classic on Jan. 1, 2011, against the  Washington Capitals  and
again four days later against the Tampa Bay Lightning. He missed
the rest of the season.  He returned to the ice this season for eight games until he
was sidelined when concussion-like symptoms returned during a
game against the  Boston Bruins  on Dec. 5. Last season, he scored
12 points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
