Rafael Nadal  has won the first set
7-5 in the Australian Open final against top-ranked Novak
Djokovic, who is seeking his third straight Grand Slam tennis
title.  The players traded service breaks midway through the set,
and Nadal earned another break to take a 6-5 lead. The Spaniard
then served out the set, which lasted 1 hour, 20 minutes.  Nadal, the No. 2 seed, is trying to avoid becoming the
first man to lose three straight championship matches in majors
since tennisâ€™ professional era began in 1968. Nadal, 25, lost
finals at Wimbledon and the U.S. Open to Djokovic last year.  Djokovic, 24, from Serbia, is seeking his third Australian
Open title and is trying to join Rod Laver,  Pete Sampras ,  Roger
Federer  and Nadal as the only men to win three Grand Slam titles
in a row since the Open era began in 1968.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
