Angela Merkel  will back French
President  Nicolas Sarkozy ’s bid for re-election,  Le Monde
reported , citing a Paris speech by Hermann Groehe, secretary
general of the German chancellor’s Christian Democratic Union.  “Nicolas Sarkozy is the man who is needed at the Elysee
palace, today and in the future,” Le Monde quoted Groehe as
saying at a meeting of Sarkozy’s Union for a Popular Movement
yesterday. “Angela Merkel will support Nicolas Sarkozy during a
campaign meeting this spring.”  France holds a first round of elections on April 22 and the
two leading candidates face a run-off on May 6.  To contact the reporter on this story:
