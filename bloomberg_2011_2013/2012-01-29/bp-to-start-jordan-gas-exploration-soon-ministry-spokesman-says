BP Plc (BP\)  will start drilling
exploratory wells at the Risha natural gas deposit in Jordan,
near the border with  Iraq , to assess reserves in the next few
weeks, an Energy Ministry spokesman said.  “If it is proven that the volume of gas in the field is
feasible for commercial purposes, the development of the  gas
field  will begin immediately,” Fayez Abu Gaoud said in a
telephone interview from the capital, Amman, today.  BP will draft a detailed report on the volume of gas
reserves in the field after drilling the wells, he said, without
specifying when the report would be submitted. Initial BP
studies show that production at Risha can reach 330 million
cubic feet a day if not more, depending on the reserves
discovered, Jordan’s official news agency Petra reported June
12, 2011.  London-based BP agreed in October 2009 to join  Jordan ’s
state-owned National Petroleum Co. to explore and develop Risha,
which occupies an area of about 7,000 square kilometers (2,700
square miles). The kingdom has agreed with Iraq to jointly
develop the Risha field, Iraqi State Minister Ali al-Dabbagh
said last March.  Jordan, which fills almost all of its energy needs through
imports, hopes to attract $14 billion of investments for
renewable energy, oil shale and nuclear power.  To contact the reporter on this story:
