The U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission is investigating a collateralized debt obligation
transaction in which  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  allowed U.S. hedge fund
Paulson & Co. to select mortgage-backed securities,  Der Spiegel 
reported.  For a CDO called “START,” the bank allowed Paulson to bet
against the securities without telling other investors, the
German magazine said on its  website . Goldman Sachs settled a
suit by the SEC for $500 million over a similar transaction,
according to Der Spiegel.  Like other lenders, Deutsche Bank is faced with lawsuits
brought forward by retail and institutional clients who have
lost money in the financial crisis, Deutsche Bank spokesman
Frank Hartman said when contacted by Bloomberg News. The lender
look into the claims carefully and, if they prove wrong, will
defend itself vigorously, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
