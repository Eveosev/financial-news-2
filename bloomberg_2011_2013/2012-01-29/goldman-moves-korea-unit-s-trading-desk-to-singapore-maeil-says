Goldman Sachs Asset Management Ltd.
relocated its Korean unit’s stock-trading desk to the Asia-
Pacific headquarters in  Singapore  late last year in a bid to cut
costs and improve efficiency, the Maeil Business Newspaper
reported, citing financial industry officials that it didn’t
identify.  Bloomberg calls to Seoul-based Christopher Jun, a  Goldman
