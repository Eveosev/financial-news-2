The  Dallas Stars  fired General
Manager Jim Nieuwendyk after the team missed the  National Hockey
League  playoffs for a fifth straight year, while the  Colorado
Avalanche  dismissed coach Joe Sacco.  The Stars will introduce Nieuwendyk’s successor during a
news conference today at American Airlines Center in Dallas, the
team said in a statement on its website. Detroit Red Wings
Assistant General Manager Jim Nill will succeed Nieuwendyk, the
Detroit Free Press and ESPN reported.  “It’s time to take this organization in a different
direction with our intentions set on returning to the elite of
the National Hockey League,” Stars owner  Tom Gaglardi  said in
the team’s statement. “I’m confident we have found the right
general manager to return us to the pathway of success.”  Dallas lost 3-0 to the  Red Wings  two days ago to finish the
season in last place in the Western Conference’s Pacific
division with a 22-22-4 record for 48 points.  The victory extended the Red Wings’ run of postseason
appearances to 22 straight years.  Nieuwendyk became the Stars’ general manager in May 2009.  Sacco was fired by the Avalanche after they finished with
the worst record in the Western Conference and the second-worst
mark in the NHL at 16-25-7. Sacco had a 130-134-30 record since
taking on his first NHL head coaching job in 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
