The  Miami Heat  won 88-77 to sweep
the Milwaukee Bucks and become the first team to reach the
second round of the National Basketball Association playoffs.  LeBron James scored a game-high 30 points at BMO Harris
Bradley Center in Milwaukee for the NBA champion Heat, which
took the best-of-seven series four games to none.  Dwyane Wade 
missed the game with a bruised right knee.  The top-seeded Heat will meet the Brooklyn Nets or the
Chicago Bulls for a place in the Eastern Conference finals. The
fifth-seeded Bulls can eliminate the Nets, the No. 4 seed, with
a win in Game 5 of their series tomorrow at the Barclays Center
in Brooklyn.  Also today in the Eastern Conference, the Boston Celtics
won 97-90 in overtime to avoid being swept by the  New York 
Knicks. New York leads the series by three games to one.  In the West, a win for the second-seeded San Antonio Spurs
tonight would give them a 4-0 series win over the  Los Angeles
Lakers , while the Golden State Warriors will seek to move 3-1
ahead of the Denver Nuggets with a home win.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
