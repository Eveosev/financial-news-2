Former U.K. Chancellor of the
Exchequer Ken Clarke said the British economy may take another
three years to “heal.”  Prime Minister  David Cameron ’s government, in which Clarke
is a minister without portfolio, is reducing spending at a
slower pace than most European countries in a strategy that will
gradually restore growth to the economy, Clarke said in an
interview with  Sky News  today.  “We’re cutting spending more slowly than almost any of the
other western European sovereign debt-infected countries,” he
said. “So long as that pace is good enough to heal the economy,
get us back to growth as soon as we possibly can, that’s the way
to proceed.”  The impact of the global financial crisis meant that
process could be slow, Clarke said. Unlike many countries in
 Europe , the U.K. has retained investor confidence, he said.  “We’re bouncing along the bottom, not achieving normal
growth because we’re in the middle of a financial crisis
gripping the western world,” he said. “We’re coping and our
head’s above the water but we’ve got one or two, three years
even still to go. We’ve got to be allowed to do this job.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
