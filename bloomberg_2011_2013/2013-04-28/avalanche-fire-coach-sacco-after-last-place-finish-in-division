The  Colorado  Avalanche fired coach
Joe Sacco after the team finished last in its National Hockey
League division.  “A change of leadership behind the bench is needed,”
Avalanche General Manager Greg Sherman said in a statement on
the team’s website today.  Sacco took on his first NHL head coaching role in 2009 and
went 130-134-30.   The Avalanche yesterday lost 3-1 to the Minnesota Wild to
end the regular season with the worst record in the Western
Conference and the second-worst in the NHL. Colorado finished
fifth in the Northwest Division with a 16-25-7 mark for 39
points.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
