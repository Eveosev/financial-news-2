 David Beckham, who plays soccer
for French side Paris Saint-Germain, is the wealthiest of
Britain and Irelandâ€™s current and former sportsmen, worth 165
million pounds ($225 million), according to the Sunday Times
Sport Rich List 2013.  Soccer players dominate the rankings of the top 100
richest, whose wealth grew to 3.23 billion pounds this year, an
increase of 6.7 percent from 2012, said the newspaper, which
published the list today.  Players and managers in soccer account for 49 places on the
list, the newspaper said. Thirty-four are from Manchester City,
Manchester United and Chelsea, it said.  Motor sports has the second-biggest share of total wealth,
with ex-Formula One racing-driver Johnny Dumfries, a Scottish
peer, ranked No. 5 with 110 million pounds. Rugby comes third,
according to the list.  To contact the reporter on this story:
