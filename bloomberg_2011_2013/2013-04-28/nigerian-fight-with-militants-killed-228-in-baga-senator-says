A battle between Nigerian soldiers
and suspected Islamist militants a week ago left 228 people dead
in the northeast town of Baga, according to an official from the
region.  “I went to three different graveyards and the total number
of those buried stood at 228, while over 4,000 houses were
burnt,” Maina Ma’aji Lawan, a senator representing the area at
the Nigerian National Assembly, told reporters yesterday. The
president’s office said the figures may be “grossly
exaggerated.”  Baga residents buried at least 185 bodies, Lawan Kole, a
local government official in the Kukawa area council, said April
22. The fight began April 19 after a military patrol was
attacked near a mosque where Boko Haram fighters have hidden
weapons in the past, Austin Edokpaye, a spokesman for the joint
military task force in charge of security in the region, said
April 21.  The government of  Africa ’s top oil producer has battled
Boko Haram since 2009 as the sect carried out gun and bomb
attacks in the mainly Muslim north and the capital Abuja that
have killed hundreds of people. President Goodluck Jonathan’s
office said April 23 that the government will investigate
whether the military complied with rules of engagement.  Jonathan said April 17 that he set up a committee that will
draft a plan to grant amnesty to Boko Haram members and disarm
the group in a 60-day period. The announcement came less than a
week after Boko Haram’s leader, Abubakar Shekau, said the group
won’t accept a government amnesty.  To contact the reporter on this story:
