The  Boston  Celtics beat the New
York Knicks 97-90 in overtime to avoid being swept in the first
round of the National Basketball Association playoffs.  Paul Pierce led the Celtics at TD Garden in Boston with 29
points and eight rebounds, Jeff Green contributed 26 points and
Kevin Garnett had 13 points and 17 rebounds for the home team.
Carmelo Anthony scored 36 points for New York and Raymond Felton
supplied another 27 for the Knicks.  New York leads the best-of-seven series by three games to
one and can secure their first series win in the postseason
since 2000 with a victory at Madison Square Garden in New York
on May 1. No team has ever won a seven-game series in the NBA
playoffs after losing the first three games.  Boston hasn’t lost in the first round since 2005, while
today’s victory means it avoided being swept for the first time
since the Indiana Pacers won a first-round series 4-0 against
the 17-time NBA champion a year earlier.  The Celtics beat the Knicks 4-0 the last time the teams met
in the postseason, in 2011.  Boston led 22-17 at the end of the first quarter and 54-37
at halftime at TD Garden in Boston. The Celtics extended their
advantage to 20 points before being outscored 30-14 in the third
quarter as New York closed to 68-65 with one quarter to play.  Anthony tied it at 82 points apiece with three minutes, 33
seconds remaining before Felton gave the Knicks their first lead
of the game with 1:17 to play. Garnett tied it with a jump shot
with 1:07 to play before Jason Terry scored nine points in
overtime as Boston outscored New York 13-6 to prevent the Knicks
sealing their first playoff series win since 2000.  Also today in the Eastern Conference, the NBA champion
Miami Heat can sweep the Bucks with a win in Game 4 of their
best-of-seven series at BMO Harris Bradley Center in  Milwaukee .  In the West, a win for the second-seeded San Antonio Spurs
would give them a 4-0 series win over the Los Angeles Lakers,
while the Golden State Warriors will seek to move 3-1 ahead of
the Denver Nuggets with a home win.  To contact the reporter on this story:
