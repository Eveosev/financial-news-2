John Terry  faces a ban from playing
for England if he goes through with an attempt to return to the
national soccer team, the Mail on Sunday reported.  Any attempt by Chelsea’s former England captain to make
himself available will be met by action under the players’ new
code of conduct, the Mail said, citing unidentified sources at
the Football Association.  Terry wants to return to the national side in time for the
2014  World Cup  in  Brazil , the Guardian reported yesterday. The
32-year-old retired from international soccer last September as
he faced an F.A. hearing for racially abusing QPR’s Anton
Ferdinand in a Premier League match. He’d earlier been acquitted
of the charge in a London court, but was still suspended four
games and fined 200,000 pounds ($309,000) by the F.A.  Under the new code of conduct, any player guilty of racial
abuse will be barred from playing for the national team, the
Mail said. The ban could be applied to Terry retrospectively,
the newspaper added.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
