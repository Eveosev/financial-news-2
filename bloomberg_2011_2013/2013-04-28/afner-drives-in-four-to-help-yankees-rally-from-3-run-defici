Travis Hafner hit a three-run homer
in the third inning and followed with a run-scoring triple in
the seventh to help the  New York Yankees  defeat the Toronto Blue
Jays 5-4 in a Major League Baseball battle of division rivals.  Hafner started the rally for the Yankees (14-9), who were
down three runs going into the bottom of the fourth inning at
Yankee Stadium. He drove home  Vernon Wells  and  Kevin Youkilis  in
the fourth inning. Wells scored on the triple in the seventh.  CC Sabathia (4-2) allowed four runs on nine hits and struck
out four in eight innings. Joba Chamberlain tallied his first
save after giving up two hits and striking out one in the ninth
for the Yankees, who have won three straight games.  Esmil Rogers (1-2) surrendered two runs on two hits in two-
thirds of an inning in relief for the Blue Jays (9-16).  To contact the reporter on this story:
