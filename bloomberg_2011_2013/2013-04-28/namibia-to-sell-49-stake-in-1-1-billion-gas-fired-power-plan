Namibia  Power Corp., a state-owned
electricity supplier, plans to sell 49 percent of the $1.1
billion gas-fired power plant it’s building.  The southwest African nation by March 2014 will announce
the winning bidders for the engineering and design of the Kudu
gas field and the construction of the 800-megawatt plant it will
feed, Muyenga Muyenga, the project’s manager, said in an e-
mailed reply to questions on April 26. The offshore field is
about 200 kilometers (124 miles) off the southern Namibian town
of Oranjemund, according to the Mines and Energy Ministry.  “The rough estimated cost of the Kudu gas-field
development will be about $1 billion, whereas the rough estimate
for the Kudu power station is about $1.1 billion,” he said.
“NamPower currently has 100 percent shareholding in KuduPower
(Pty) Ltd., and it is in the process of farming out 49 percent
to prospective strategic equity partners.”  Namibia plans to exploit offshore gas fields to produce
electricity and reduce reliance on imports, which comprised 53
percent of power used in the year through July, NamPower said in
its  2012 annual report . The country will probably face a power
shortfall in 2016 because of growing demand, according to the
Economist Intelligence Unit.  The nation also wants to reduce its 54 percent interest in
the Kudu gas field to 30 percent, Managing Director Obeth
Kandjoze said on April 23.  Maamba Talks  NamPower held informal talks with Maamba Collieries Ltd.,
the Nava Bharat Singapore Pte Ltd. unit that’s building a coal
mine and power plant in Zambia, over the potential construction
of another 300-megawatt plant, said Reiner Jagau, the general
manager of power-system development at the utility. The plant
would be built near Katimo Mulilo on the Namibian side of the
border it shares with Zambia, burning coal imported from Maamba,
he said in an e-mailed response to questions.  “Namibia cannot afford two base-load  power plants  such as
Kudu and coal,” Jagau said. “Currently, NamPower is
concentrating its efforts to finalize the Kudu feasibility study
to be able to take an  investment decision  by the first quarter
of 2014.”  The government wants the first gas production from the
offshore field by 2018. Exploration off Namibia, where 18 wells
have been drilled, has so far focused on Kudu, still untapped
since its discovery in 1997.  Namibia is the world’s largest producer of offshore
diamonds and the fourth-biggest uranium producer. The country
had installed capacity of 1,108 megawatts as of July 2012,
according to NamPower’s annual report. One megawatt is enough
electricity to light about 500 to 1,000 U.S. homes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
