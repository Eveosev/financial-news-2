A fire broke out in the wreckage of
a collapsed Bangladeshi garment factory as rescuers were
attempting to cut through a steel rod to reach a woman trapped
in the rubble, the  Associated Press  reported.  At least three rescue workers were injured in the fire, AP
said, citing volunteer rescuer Syed Al-Amin Roman. Firefighters
were trying to get the blaze under control, AP said.  Rescuers were still trying to reach possible survivors in
other parts of the destroyed eight-story building four days
after the collapse, AP said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
