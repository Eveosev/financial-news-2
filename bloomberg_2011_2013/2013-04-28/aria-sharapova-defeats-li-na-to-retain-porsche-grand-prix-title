Rafael Nadal  beat his Spanish
compatriot Nicolas Almagro in straight sets for a record-
extending eighth title in tennis’s ATP Barcelona Open today.  Second-seeded Nadal defeated the No. 4 seed 6-4, 6-3 to
bounce back from his loss to world No. 1 Novak Djokovic of
Serbia in the Monte Carlo Masters last weekend.  Nadal, an 11-time Grand Slam winner currently ranked No. 5
by the ATP, returned in February after a seven-month layoff
because of a knee injury. Since then he’s also won titles in Sao
Paulo, Acapulco and Indian Wells, California.  Russia’s  Maria Sharapova  beat  Li Na  of China in straight
sets to retain her WTA Porsche Grand Prix title.  Top seed Sharapova, ranked world No. 2 by the WTA tour, won
6-4, 6-3 in Stuttgart, Germany. It was her second tournament
success this season after victory at  Indian Wells .  Lukas Rosol of the Czech Republic had a 6-3, 6-2 win over
Spain’s Guillermo Garcia-Lopez in the final of the ATP BRD
Nastase Tiriac Trophy in Bucharest. It was a first ATP Tour
title for Rosol, who beat Nadal in the second round of Wimbledon
last year.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
