J.R. Smith won’t be on the court
tonight when the New York Knicks try to sweep the  Boston Celtics 
in the first round of the National Basketball Association
playoffs.  The 27-year-old guard was suspended without pay for one
game after he hit Celtics’ guard  Jason Terry  in the chin during
the Knicks’ 90-76 win April 26 at TD Garden in Boston. He was
charged with a flagrant foul two and ejected with seven minutes,
six seconds remaining in the game.  “I don’t think he’s tried to hurt anyone last night,”
coach  Mike Woodson  told reporters yesterday. “It looked like a
basketball play, trying to clear space to me.”  The 27-year-old guard averaged 18.1 points per game in the
regular season. During the first three playoff games, he
averaged 16.3 points.  The Knicks, who lead the best-of-seven Eastern Conference
series 3-0, can eliminate the Celtics tonight with a victory.  To contact the reporter on this story:
