U.K. banks  may increase lending to
British businesses in 2013 for the first time in four years,
according to research by  Ernst & Young LLP ’s Item Club.  Lending to companies may rise by 3 percent to 440 billion
pounds ($681 billion) this year and by 8.5 percent in 2014,
after a drop of 5 percent in 2012, the London-based economic
forecasting group said today. Declining bad loans and better
access to wholesale markets will trigger the increase, it said.  “Behind the scenes banking fundamentals have quietly been
improving and banks are now in a better position to be able to
provide funds to the wider economy,” said Andy Baldwin, head of
financial services in  Europe ,  Middle East , India and  Africa , at
Ernst & Young.  Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne ’s Funding for
Lending Scheme, a program to boost lending giving banks access
to about 82 billion pounds of cheap loans, will help restore
confidence and stimulate demand from consumers and small
companies, Ernst & Young said. Britain avoided a triple-dip
recession in the first quarter with a 0.3 percent rise in gross
domestic product.  -- Editor: Jon Menon  To contact the reporter on this story:
