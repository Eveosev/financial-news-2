A no-alcohol hotel opened yesterday
in the Red Sea resort town of Hurghada, state-run Middle East
 News Agency  said, amid charges by the country’s opposition that
an Islamist agenda is taking root.  The Lorwah hotel is an attempt to promote “a new tourism
approach” that avoids entertainment forbidden by Islam,  resort
owner Yasser Kamal told MENA. The hotel also has one women-only
floor with a swimming pool and concert hall guarded by female
security, he said.  Alcohol bottles lined up on a bar were broken in the
hotel’s opening ceremony, MENA reported late yesterday.  On Twitter and Facebook, critics assailed the move as
Islamist encroachment on tourism and another clampdown on
personal freedoms under President Mohamed Mursi, elected in June
as the Muslim Brotherhood’s candidate. In February, the
government stopped licensing stores to sell alcohol in some
urban areas  To contact the reporter on this story:
