Manchester United’s Robin van
Persie scored against his former team as the newly crowned
Premier League champion drew 1-1 at Arsenal.  Bottom clubs Reading and Queens Park Rangers were relegated
after they drew 0-0 today. Chelsea beat Swansea 2-0 to move
ahead of Arsenal into third spot.  Theo Walcott gave Arsenal a second-minute lead and the home
team went on to control the first half at the Emirates Stadium.
United came back into the game after Van Persie leveled from the
penalty spot in the 44th minute.  United has 85 points, and cannot now beat Chelsea’s record
Premier League points haul of 95. Last year’s champion
Manchester City has 71, followed by Chelsea (65), Arsenal (64)
and Tottenham (62). A top-four finish brings Champions League
qualification.  The Reading-QPR result at the Madejski Stadium leaves both
teams on 25 points, with three games left. Wigan has 32 points
and Aston Villa -- which hosts Sunderland tomorrow -- has 34.
Wigan will meet Villa on the last day of the season.  Chelsea’s win maintains its challenge for a top-four place.
Oscar and Frank Lampard, with a penalty, got the goals just
before halftime.  Yesterday, Liverpool won 6-0 at Newcastle, Manchester City
defeated West Ham 2-1, and Everton had a 1-0 victory over
Fulham. West Brom won 3-0 at Southampton , Stoke beat Norwich 1-
0 and Tottenham drew 2-2 at Wigan.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
