Syrian rebels trying to oust
President Bashar Al-Assad fought with government forces at two
military air bases in the north of the country, the Syrian
Observatory for  Human Rights  said.  Clashes raged inside the Abu Zhuhoor base in northwestern
Idlib province and the Kweiras military air base in Aleppo, the
 U.K.-based group  said in an e-mailed statement today. The
fighting in Abu Zhuhoor killed an unknown number of government
forces, it said.  Syrian rebels have tried to weaken Assadâ€™s military
supremacy by seizing air bases across the country. Government
forces have attacked with helicopters and fighter jets as they
lose territory. The uprising against Assad, which began in March
2011, has killed more than 70,000 people, according to United
Nations estimates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
