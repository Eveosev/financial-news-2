Delek Automotive Systems Ltd. (DLEA) 
dropped the most in almost two months on bets Israeli government
steps to lower car prices and boost competition will hurt
profitability at the importer of Mazda cars.  Delek Automotive’s stock plunged 4.3 percent, the biggest
decline  since March 17 , to 36.88 shekels at the close in Tel
Aviv, bringing the company’s  market value  to 3.44 billion
shekels ($954 million). Trading was more than twice the three-
month daily average volume. The shares gained 26 percent last
year as the company’s profit more than doubled. The benchmark
TA-25 index slid 0.7 percent today.  Prime Minister  Benjamin Netanyahu  said today the government
is taking steps to reduce the cost of living “on land, sea and
air,” which will include measures to lower car prices according
to a statement from the Ministry of Transport, National
Infrastructures and Road Safety. Four importers dominate 55
percent of new car sales in  Israel  and the majority of vehicles
are purchased by four car-leasing companies.  “Lower prices and increased competition could hurt the
company’s profitability,” Eran Yunger, an analyst at Migdal
Capital Markets, said today by phone.  Delek Automotive, based in Moshav Nir Zvi, Israel, posted
 net income  of 306 million shekels in 2012 compared with 126
million shekels in 2011, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The company’s first quarter operating income rose 13
percent to 130 million shekels.  To contact the reporter on this story:
