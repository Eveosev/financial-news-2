European Union barley production is
predicted to climb 2.4 percent, less than forecast a month ago,
while the durum-wheat outlook was raised, according to the
European Commission’s latest grain balance sheet.  Farmers in the 27-nation bloc are forecast to harvest 55.2
million metric tons of barley compared with 53.9 million tons in
2012, according to the EU data published  online  on April 26.
That compares with a March outlook of 56 million tons.  Cold March weather delayed crop development by a month in
 France  and more in the U.K. and extended winter dormancy in
Germany and  Poland , the EU’s crop-monitoring unit reported last
week. The delay means the likelihood of realizing the full crop
potential is “somewhat compromised,” it said.  Durum-wheat production is seen at 8.8 million tons, up from
8.5 million tons in 2012, compared with an earlier outlook for
unchanged production.  This year’s soft-wheat crop is predicted to climb to 129.7
million tons from 123.3 million tons, with the outlook reduced
by 100,000 tons from March. The outlook for wheat stockpiles at
the end of June 2014 was cut by 600,000 tons to 9.7 million tons
on lower beginning stocks.  The EU maintained its outlook for the corn crop to rise to
65.3 million tons from 55.4 million tons harvested last year.
The rapeseed harvest in the region is seen rising to 21 million
tons from 19.3 million tons, also unchanged.  To contact the reporter on this story:
