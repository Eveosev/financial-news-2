Tottenham’s Gareth Bale became the
third person to be named by his peers as English soccer’s Player
of the Year and Young Player of the Year in the same season.  Bale, 23, joins Mark Hughes, Alan Shearer, Thierry Henry
and Cristiano Ronaldo in winning the Professional Footballers’
Association’s Player of the Year accolade twice. The only other
players to have won both awards in the same season were Andy
Gray in 1977 and Ronaldo 30 years later.  “When you look at the list there are some massive names on
it and the other nominees have been unbelievable this year,”
Bale said after last night’s ceremony.  Bale this season has scored 24 goals for Spurs, which is
chasing a top-four Premier League place that would bring
Champions League qualification.  The Welsh winger’s latest goal was in the 2-2 draw at Wigan
two days ago, which leaves Tottenham in fifth spot.  Bale previously won the Player of the Year award in 2011.
Robin van Persie won it last year, before leaving Arsenal for
Manchester United.  Bale beat Luis Suarez of Liverpool and Van Persie to win
the Player of the Year award. In the young player category, Bale
finished ahead of Eden Hazard of Chelsea, Aston Villa’s
Christian Benteke, West Brom striker Romelu Lukaku, Arsenal
midfielder  Jack Wilshere  and Manchester United striker  Danny Welbeck .  PREMIER LEAGUE TEAM OF THE YEAR
