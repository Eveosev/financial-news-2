The  Big Ten Conference  approved the
creation of East and West divisions from 2014 with a nine-game
league schedule for football from 2016.  The East will comprise Indiana, Maryland, Michigan,
Michigan State, Ohio State,  Penn State  and Rutgers. Illinois,
Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, Northwestern, Purdue and  Wisconsin 
will compete in the West.  From 2016, the schedule will include one more conference
game, taking to three the number of matchups each school will
play against teams in the other division. Indiana and Purdue
will play each other every year, the conference said in a
 statement on its website  today.  “Big Ten directors of athletics concluded four months of
study and deliberation with unanimous approval of a future
football structure that preserved rivalries,” Big Ten
Commissioner James E. Delany said in the league’s statement.
“We’re all looking forward to ushering in this new era of Big
