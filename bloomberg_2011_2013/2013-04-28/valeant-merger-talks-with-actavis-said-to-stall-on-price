Valeant Pharmaceuticals
International Inc. (VRX) ’s merger talks with  Actavis Inc. (ACT)  have stalled
because of a disagreement on price, according to people familiar
with the matter.  The generic-drug makers had sought to announce a deal as
soon as today before Actavis balked at the premium offered by
Valeant, said one of the people, who asked not to be identified
because the discussions aren’t public. While the talks have
halted for now, they may become active again, another person
said.  Laurie Little, a spokeswoman for Montreal-based Valeant,
and Charlie Mayr, a spokesman for Morristown, New Jersey-based
Actavis, couldn’t be reached immediately for comment. The
Financial Times reported April 27 that the talks had stalled.  Actavis, the biggest U.S. generic-drug maker, was created
after Watson Pharmaceuticals bought Actavis Group last year and
began operating under the target’s brand name. It had $5.91
billion in 2012  revenue  and a market value of $12.9 billion as
of the close of  New York   trading  on April 26, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Actavis rose 4.6 percent to $105.58 at the close in New
York, the shares’ highest price since February 1993. Valeant
gained 3.8 percent to $75.94.  To contact the reporters on this story:
