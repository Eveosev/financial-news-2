IDB Holding Corp. (IDBH) ’s 2020 bonds
jumped, pushing the yield down the most in almost five months,
after Argentine businessman Eduardo Elsztain agreed to inject
$57 million into the debt-strapped company.  The yield on IDB’s 1.07 billion shekels ($297 million) of
5.1 percent bonds dropped 573 basis points, or 5.73 percentage
points, the biggest decline since December 9, to 68.35 percent,
at 12:54 p.m. in Tel Aviv. The  shares  soared the most since
March 12.  Elsztain’s investment is also investing $18 million in
parent company Ganden Holdings Ltd. giving him joint control of
both companies along with Israeli businessman Nochi Dankner,
according to a company statement on April 26. The Buenos Aires-
based businessman is expected to arrive in  Israel  this week to
advance the deal as IDB Holding, which is seeking funds to meet
payments on about 2.06 billion shekels in debt, is embroiled in
debt-settlement talks with bondholders.  “IDB is winning some time and Elsztain’s commitment gives
some support,” said Oren Ossad, a trader at Excellence Nessuah
Investment House Ltd., in  Ramat Gan , Israel. “At the same time
the investment is only a drop in the ocean.”  The agreement with Elsztain comes after  Bank Leumi Le-
Israel Ltd. (LUMI)  last week backed out of a debt arrangement with
Ganden. Elsztain last year bought 10 percent of Ganden for $25
million. IDB Holding in March proposed a debt arrangement to
transfer 15 percent of its shares to bondholders, as well as a
500 million-shekel cash injection.  Recovery Plan  Meanwhile bondholders of the holding company’s IDB
Development Corp., including York Capital Management LP, are
proposing a recovery plan to convert 55 percent of the unit’s
3.8 billion shekels in debt to equity, while 45 percent would be
exchanged for new bonds. The company, which has been trying to
sell  Clal Insurance Enterprises Holdings Ltd. (CLIS) , owes 6 billion
shekels to bondholders and banks.  The shares jumped 11 percent to 9.35 shekels in 2.7 times
the three-month average daily volume.  The  Tel Aviv  Bond 40 Index, which measures inflation-linked
and fixed-rate corporate bonds, increased for a second day,
advancing 0.1 percent to 288.01.  To contact the reporter on this story:
