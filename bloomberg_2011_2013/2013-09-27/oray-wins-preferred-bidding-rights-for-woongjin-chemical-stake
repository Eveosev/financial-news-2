Toray Industries Inc. (3402) , the biggest
carbon fiber producer that’s also expanding its water-treatment
business, said it won the preferential bidding rights for a 56.2
percent stake in Woongjin Chemical Co.  Toray will announce results of negotiations between its
Korean unit and the South Korean fiber maker that also has a
water-filter business as soon as a decision is reached, it said
in a statement to the Tokyo Stock Exchange.  The South Korean company’s shares rose 1.9 percent today in
Seoul while Toray gained 1.6 percent. The Korea Economic Daily
earlier this month reported Toray was picked as preferred
bidder.  The Tokyo-based company that makes filters to clean water
says the market for membranes to treat seawater and wastewater
is expanding with orders from  China  to Singapore, the  Middle
East  and North Africa.  To contact the reporter on this story:
