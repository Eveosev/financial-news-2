A five-story building in  Mumbai 
collapsed, killing at least five people, according to officials
at hospitals treating the injured.  About 21 people were injured in the disaster, P.P. Lahane,
dean at J.J. Hospital, said in an interview. Vijay Khabale-Patil, a spokesman for the city administration, said three died,
while 16 were rescued from the site in south Mumbai.  The residential building housing the workers of the
Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai was undergoing repairs
when it came down at about 6 a.m. local time, a fire-brigade
official at the control room said on the telephone. Authorities
in April had asked residents to vacate the building, Khabale-Patil said.  “I was woken up by the loud noises after the collapse,”
said Suyash Jhadhav, a resident of a neighboring building. “I
felt that something might happen to our building since both
buildings are close. It took a while for me to overcome my fear
because the noises were frightening.”  About 21 families were living in the 33-year-old building,
the Hindustan Times reported on its website. A 10-year-old boy
was among the survivors, Khabale-Patil said. Municipal
Commissioner Sitaram Kunte couldn’t be reached on his mobile
phone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
