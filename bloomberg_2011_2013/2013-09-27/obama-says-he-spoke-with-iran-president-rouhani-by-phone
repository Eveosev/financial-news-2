President  Barack Obama  said he spoke with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani today by telephone about talks to resolve international concerns about the country’s nuclear program.  While there will be obstacles, “I believe we can reach a comprehensive solution,” Obama said at the White House.  Obama and Rouhani didn’t meet this week when they were both at the  United Nations General Assembly  in New York. Their telephone conversation is the first between leaders of the two countries since the 1979 Islamic revolution.  Iran says that its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes, not to build a nuclear weapon.
