Denis O’Brien , the Irish
telecommunications billionaire, ruled out selling shares in
Digicel Group Ltd. to the public “at the moment.”  “We like to run our company on a private basis,” O’Brien,
chairman of Kingston, Jamaica-based Digicel, the Caribbean’s
largest phone company, said in an interview with Stephanie Ruhle
on Bloomberg Television. “But we have the best practices of a
public company” as Digicel sells bonds in the U.S. and Europe.  O’Brien said the decision by Vodafone Group Plc to sell its
45 percent stake in Verizon Wireless to Verizon Communications
Inc. for $130 billion was “good news for everybody.”  “It has hit a benchmark and you can see recovery now in
the value of mobile phone companies,” said O’Brien. “All the
ships rising, as such.”  Digicel is the largest carrier in Haiti, one of its 31
markets in the Caribbean, Central and  South America  and the
South Pacific. In June, the company lost out on a license to
expand telecommunications in Myanmar, one of the world’s last
remaining untapped markets, even after partnering with
billionaire  George Soros .  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
