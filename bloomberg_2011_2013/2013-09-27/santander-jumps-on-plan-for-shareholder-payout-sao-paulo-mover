Banco Santander Brasil SA (BSBR) , the
Brazilian unit of  Spain ’s biggest lender, rose the most on
record after saying it would pay out 6 billion reais ($2.7
billion) to stockholders.  The stock  rallied  7.6 percent to 15.49 reais at 10:58 a.m.
in  Sao Paulo , the biggest advance on a closing basis since it
started trading in October 2009. It was the best performance on
the benchmark Ibovespa, which  added  0.3 percent.  Santander said yesterday in a regulatory filing that it
will issue debt to finance the equity payout. The bank will
maintain a 21.5 percent capital ratio, based on a formula that
weights assets in relation to their perceived riskinesss,
according to the filing. If approved by shareholders, the plan
would be implemented in early 2014.  “The bank was not especially efficiently set up with its
balance sheet, and this will improve that,” Bill Rudman, who
helps manage $400 million of emerging market stocks at
Blackfriars Asset Management in  London , said in a phone
interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
