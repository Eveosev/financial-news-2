HeidelbergCement AG (HEI) , the world’s
third-largest maker of cement, fell the most since Aug. 27 after
an  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA)  analyst said currency headwinds and a
slowdown in Indonesia will cap the stock’s growth potential.  Shares in the Heidelberg, Germany-based company fell as
much as 3.4 percent, and were trading down 2.5 percent at 57.78
as of 1:55 p.m. in Frankfurt. Trading volumes were at 70 percent
of the three month daily average.  HeidelbergCement has climbed 26 percent this year, more
than its larger competitors  Lafarge SA (LG)  and Holcim Ltd., which
have increased 7.8 percent and 2.8 percent, respectively. The
company, which dates back to 1873, is pursuing 1.01 billion
euros ($1.37 billion) in cost savings by the end of 2013 as it
targets higher revenue and operating income, while
“significantly” increasing pretax profit.  “We believe that the shares are approaching fair value,”
John Fraser-Andrews, a London-based analyst for HSBC, said in a
note to clients today as he cut his rating to neutral from buy.
HeidelbergCement will be “dented by the slowdown in Indonesia
and emerging market currency translation,” he said.  HSBC also downgraded HeidelbergCement’s Swiss competitor
 Holcim Ltd. (HOLN) , prompting that stock to fall as much as 1.8
percent. Lafarge dropped as much as 1.7 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
