Banco Santander Brasil SA (BSBR) , the
fourth-largest Brazilian bank by market value, plans to pay out
6 billion reais ($2.7 billion) to stockholders and issue the
same amount of dollar-denominated debt.  Shareholders will have the option of using their payments
to acquire the subordinated debt, the bank said yesterday in a
regulatory filing. The goal of the plan, which also includes a
reverse stock split to reduce transaction costs for investors,
is to increase shareholder returns while shifting to a cheaper
form of capital, the Sao Paulo-based company said.  The deal would conclude around January if approved at a
meeting of shareholders. The bankâ€™s Madrid-based parent,  Banco
Santander SA (SAN) , committed to buying the debt in an amount
proportional to its stake, Santander Brasil said. The company
said it will maintain a 21.5 percent capital ratio, a gauge of
leverage measuring total capital in relation to risk-weighted
assets. The notes will be Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital.  For the reserve split, Santander Brasil proposed that
investors get one voting or non-voting share for every 55 voting
or non-voting shares they hold.  For the payout, investors will receive 0.015086372746 reais
per voting or non-voting share. Holders of units, comprised of a
voting and non-voting share, would receive 1.58406913833 reais
per unit.  The plan also includes a distribution of 0.047619048 non-voting share to each voting or non-voting share, and five non-voting shares for every unit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
