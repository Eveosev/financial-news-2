Hog futures rose, heading for a
second straight monthly gain, on mounting concern that a virus
is killing piglets and reducing the size of the U.S. herd.
Cattle also advanced.  The  U.S. Department of Agriculture  probably will report
today that the herd on Sept. 1 fell 1 percent from a year
earlier, partly because of the spread of porcine epidemic
diarrhea virus, a survey of 10 analysts by Bloomberg showed.
Cash  prices  for U.S. hogs are up 34 percent from a year ago, and
government data show  wholesale pork  gained 7.8 percent this
month to a five-week high of $1.0236 a pound.  “The tightness we are having right now, it’s real and it
has been since August,”  Don Roose , the president of U.S.
Commodities Inc. in  West Des Moines ,  Iowa , said in a telephone
interview. Today’s USDA report is “going to give us an idea how
serious the virus is,” he said.  Hog futures for December settlement rose 0.6 percent to
88.275 cents a pound at 11:14 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, heading for a weekly gain of 2.6 percent. The contract
is up 4.2 percent this month.  The U.S. herd probably fell to 67.463 million hogs on Sept.
1, compared with a year earlier, the first decline for that time
of year since 2010, the Bloomberg survey showed. The USDA will
release its quarterly estimate at 3 p.m. in  Washington .  The PED virus has been found in at least 17 states with 644
cases since April, the  American Association of Swine
Veterinarians  estimates. The disease infects suckling pigs,
which are three weeks old or younger, with a  mortality rate  seen
as high as a 100 percent, a National Animal Health Laboratory
Network report showed Sept. 25. The disease affects older hogs
by slowing growth.  Cattle futures for December delivery rose 0.4 percent to
$1.32125 a pound on the CME. Feeder-cattle futures for November
settlement rose 0.2 percent to $1.65525 a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
