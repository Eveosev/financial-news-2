Vodacom Group Ltd. (VOD) , South Africa’s
largest wireless operator, rose to the highest in almost nine
months after it was said to be entering exclusive talks to
acquire Internet provider Neotel Pty Ltd.  The Johannesburg-based carrier gained as much as 2 percent
to 128.46 rand ($12.75), the  highest since Jan. 4  on a closing
basis, and was trading 0.5% up at 126.64 rand at 10:05 a.m.
About 531,000 shares, or more than 25 percent of the three-month
daily average, changed hands, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Vodacom, which is 65 percent owned by Vodafone Group Plc,
is in talks to buy  Tata Communications Ltd. (TCOM) ’s closely held South
African unit, according to a person familiar with the
discussions.  Mobile operators are turning increasingly to fixed-line
assets that allow them to sell a wider range of services and
carry data traffic more efficiently. This year Vodacom’s parent,
Newbury, England-based  Vodafone (VOD) , bid 7.7 billion euros ($10.4
billion) for Kabel Deutschland, a German fixed-line telephony,
cable TV and Internet-access service provider.  To contact the reporter on this story:
