Co-Operative Group Ltd. had its
 credit rating  cut to B from BB- by  Standard & Poor’s , citing a
potential weakening of its financial strength as it helps to
bail out its banking unit.  The change in the long-term corporate credit and senior
unsecured debt rating of the U.K.’s largest customer-owned
retailer reflects its contribution of as much as 1 billion
pounds ($1.6 billion) to its banking arm, Co-operative Bank Plc,
S&P said in a statement today. The ratings company revised its
assessment of the group’s risk profile to “highly leveraged”
from “aggressive.”  Co-Op Bank announced a plan to plug a 1.5 billion-pound
capital shortfall in June, which will include trading its shares
on the London Stock Exchange. The group plans to raise money by
issuing debt, selling its insurance business, and asking
existing bondholders to exchange subordinated debt for new
equity and senior debt.  “While management expects to carry out these
transactions successfully, we see substantial execution risk,
particularly around the exchange offer but also the planned
divestment, which could yet be delayed or fall short of
expectations,” S&P said in the statement.  The capital shortfall of the Manchester, England-based
lender was revealed amid its failed attempt earlier this year to
buy 632 branches from Lloyds Banking Group Plc.  -- Editor: Jon Menon  To contact the reporter on this story:
