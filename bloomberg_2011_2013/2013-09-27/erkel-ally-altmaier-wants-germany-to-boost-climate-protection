German Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s
third-term government should increase efforts to protect the
climate, one of her key party allies said.  There’s no doubt that humans largely cause  climate change ,
and greenhouse gas emissions need to be reduced to avoid
dangerous global warming, Environment Minister Peter Altmaier
said today in Berlin. A United Nations report summary released
earlier today shows that politicians need to step up efforts to
protect the climate, he said.  The new German government should “push climate protection
more to the forefront,” Altmaier told reporters. “There’s
cause for determined political action.”  Germany,  Europe ’s biggest economy, plans to exit nuclear
power generation by 2022 and rely on more renewable sources such
as wind and solar. The country also aims to raise  energy
efficiency  and lower greenhouse gas emissions 40 percent by 2020
compared with 1990 levels.  While Germany will likely reach its emissions-reduction
targets, changes need to be made to Germany’s energy market to
ensure coal-fired power plants aren’t favored over cleaner gas-fired power stations, Altmaier said.  “I expect climate protection to play an important role in
forming a new government,” Altmaier said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
