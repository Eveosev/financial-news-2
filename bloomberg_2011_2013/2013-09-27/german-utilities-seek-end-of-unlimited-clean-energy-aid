German Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s
new government must place a limit on aid to clean-energy
developers and force them to sell power on the market to reduce
costs, a utility lobby said.  Developers of new projects should sell electricity on the
market and get a flexible “market premium” on top of that, the
BDEW, representing utilities including EON SE and  RWE AG (RWE) , said
today in an e-mailed statement. The amount of electricity that
qualifies for the aid should be capped, the group said in a  22-page paper . Under the existing rules, there’s no limit for the
next 20 years,  “Today we expect renewables to generate power
ecologically,” Hildegard Mueller, head of the BDEW, said in the
statement. “In the future they also have to do that reliably
and at low cost.”  Merkel has vowed to change a 13-year-old subsidy system
that was copied around the world and helped turn Germany into
Europe’s biggest clean-energy market -- and also one of the
costliest. Reworking the rules may benefit consumers and reduce
incentives for wind and solar farms, cutting orders for
manufacturers such as  Vestas Wind Systems A/S (VWS)  and  Trina Solar
Ltd. (TSL)  It could either help or hurt utilities such as EON and RWE.  Renewable units should also be equipped with remote-control
technology to protect the stability of the  power grid , BDEW
said. In a later step, the market premium should be determined
in auctions to reduce costs, BDEW said.  Germans pay more for electricity than any other nation in
the European Union except Cyprus and Denmark, EU data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
