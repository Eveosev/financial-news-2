Lauren Zalaznick, an executive vice
president of  Comcast Corp. (CMCSA) ’s NBCUniversal and 12-year veteran,
is leaving the entertainment company.  Zalaznick will remain with NBCUniversal through a
transition period and then consult with the company on digital
media content and technology, Chief Executive Officer Steve Burke said today in an e-mail to staff. Burke didn’t disclose
Zalaznick’s future long-term plans.  “She is one of those rare executives that combine great
creative instincts with a true business orientation,” Burke
said of Zalaznick in the e-mail. “Her contributions to our
company have been significant and far-reaching.”  NBCUniversal is losing an executive who oversaw the rise of
Bravo, one of its biggest cable channels, and spearheaded
marketing campaigns across broadcast and cable outlets. In
February, the company promoted Bonnie Hammer to oversee an
expanded lineup of cable channels and studios and appointed
Zalaznick to manage digital operations.  Cesar Conde, the former president of Univision Networks who
joined NBCUniversal as an executive vice president earlier this
month, will oversee most of Zalaznick’s current direct reports,
Burke said in the e-mail.  Zalaznick  was  ranked among the 50 most powerful women in
business by Fortune magazine in 2012.  Comcast, based in Philadelphia, rose 1.5 percent to $44.75
at 2:24 p.m. in  New York . The stock had climbed 18 percent this
year as of yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
