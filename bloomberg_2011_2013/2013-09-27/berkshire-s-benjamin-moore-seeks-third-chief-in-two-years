Benjamin Moore, the paint maker
owned by  Warren Buffett ’s  Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A) , said Chief
Executive Officer Robert Merritt left the company.  Benjamin Moore, which hired Merritt last year, is searching
for a new leader and expects to name a replacement “in the
coming week,” the Montvale, New Jersey-based company said
yesterday in a  statement  on its website.  The paint company last year hired Merritt, a former
executive at restaurant companies including Cosi Inc., to
replace Denis Abrams. The unit has staff of about 2,200 people,
according to the most recent  annual report  from Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire.  Buffett, 83, agreed in 2000 to buy the paint company for
about $1 billion as he expanded housing-related operations. He
has identified the business as one of four Berkshire units that
counts Tracy Britt as chairman. Another of the units, building
products provider Johns Manville, in November named Mary Rhinehart as chief executive officer, replacing Todd Raba.  Britt didn’t immediately return a message seeking comment.
Eileen McComb, a spokeswoman for Benjamin Moore, also didn’t
return a call.  To contact the reporter on this story:
