Matt Cassel will start at
quarterback for the  Minnesota Vikings  this Sunday against the
Pittsburgh Steelers in a matchup of 0-3 teams at London’s
Wembley Stadium, replacing injured Christian Ponder.  “I just found out this morning, right before practice,”
Cassel told reporters today in video posted on the Vikings’
website. “I’ve been preparing for this and I feel like I’m
ready to go.”  Minnesota coach Leslie Frasier told reporters it was “too
risky” to play Ponder, who broke a rib in a loss last weekend
to the Cleveland Browns.  “The fact that we have a bye coming up gives him a little
bit more time to heal,” Frasier said.  Cassel is a 31-year-old, eight-year National Football
League veteran, having played his first four seasons with the
 New England Patriots  and the past four with the  Kansas City
Chiefs . He’s 29-33 as a starter, throwing for 82 touchdowns and
57 interceptions during his career, while completing 58.9
percent of his attempts.  Ponder, a 25-year-old in his third season in Minnesota, has
two touchdown passes and five interceptions this season.  To contact the reporter on this story:
