JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  and  Citigroup
Inc. (C)  were among the banks that lost a bid to throw out a Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp. lawsuit over $388 million in securities
sold to a failed lender.  U.S. District Judge Louis Stanton in Manhattan today denied
a motion to dismiss the suit, which also targets  UBS AG (UBSN) ,
 Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  and  Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC)  Stanton rejected defense
arguments that FDIC filed the suit too late and that the agency
failed to make a sufficient claim that could allow it to
recover.  In the suit, filed last year, FDIC alleged that the banks
misrepresented the quality of the loans underlying 11
residential mortgage-backed securities that Colonial Bank
purchased in 2007.  Colonial Bank, of Montgomery,  Alabama , was closed by the
Alabama State Banking Department on Aug. 14, 2009, and the FDIC
was named as a receiver for the institution.  The misrepresentations included inaccurate loan-to-value
ratios based on inflated property values, according to the
complaint. Many of the properties at issue also had second
mortgages that weren’t disclosed, the FDIC said.  “In many cases, the amount of the undisclosed additional
liens was much greater than the owners’ ostensible equity,
putting the owner ’under water’ on the day on which this
securitization closed,” the FDIC said in the complaint.  The case is Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. as receiver for
Colonial Bank v. Chase Mortgage Finance Corp, 12-cv-6166, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of New York ( Manhattan ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
