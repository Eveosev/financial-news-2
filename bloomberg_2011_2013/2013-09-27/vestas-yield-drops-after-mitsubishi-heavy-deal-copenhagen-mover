The yield on  Vestas Wind Systems
A/S (VWS) ’s bond fell to its lowest in more than two years in
Copenhagen trading after the Danish turbine maker formed a
partnership with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd.  The yield on Vestas’ 600 million-euro ($810 million) 4.625
percent bond due 2015 dropped 21 basis points to 5.07 percent at
10:44 a.m. today, the lowest since July 18, 2011, according to
Composite Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. Vestas’s stock rose as
much as 13 percent.  Vestas said today it will form a joint venture with the
Tokyo-based company to design, procure, build and sell offshore
wind power plants. Mitsubishi Heavy will inject 100 million
euros into the venture, and another 200 million euros based on
milestones. The deal will boost Vestas’s cash position by about
60 million euros, the Aarhus, Denmark-based company said.  The partnership “offloads a potentially significant
financial burden” for Vestas, Justin Wu, Bloomberg New Energy
Finance’s head of wind analysis, said in an e-mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
