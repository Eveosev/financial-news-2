President  Barack Obama  said that Congress’s failure to approve funding to keep the government open and an increase in the debt ceiling would have a destabilizing effect on the economy.  “This grandstanding has real effects on real people,” the Democratic president said in a televised statement at the White House. “Even the threat of a shutdown already is probably having a dampening effect on our economy.”  Earlier today the Senate passed a temporary funding bill on a 54-44 vote and sent it to the House as lawmakers worked against a deadline to avert a damaging government shutdown on Oct. 1, the start of a new fiscal year.  The Senate, controlled by Democrats, approved funding through Nov. 15 without the provision in the legislation passed by the Republican-controlled House that would have deleted funds to carry out Obama’s signature health-care law.  House leaders were still insisting that any short-term spending bill include limits on the health-care law’s reach, a demand House Democrats and Obama won’t accept.  The standoff will push the House into session over the weekend as leaders try to reach a deal to avoid a shutdown that would furlough most federal workers after 11:59 p.m. on Sept. 30.
