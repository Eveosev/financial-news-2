Greencoat U.K. Wind Plc, the fund
that held Britain’s biggest clean-energy initial public offering
this year, agreed to buy two wind farms from  BayWa AG. (BYW6)   Greencoat is financing the 70 million-pound ($113 million)
purchase using cash and short-term debt, the London-based
company said today in a statement. The deal includes the 16.4-megawatt Cotton Farm and the 10.25-megawatt Earl’s Hall plant,
both located in eastern England and operating since March.  The acquisition is Greencoat’s first since raising 260
million pounds in an IPO in March to buy projects from  RWE AG (RWE) 
and SSE Plc. The company purchases wind farms from utilities and
other companies, boosting their  cash flow  while allowing
investors to gain from the stable returns wind energy generates.  Today’s deal, which includes prepayment of existing debt
and 6.4 million pounds in cash, increases Greencoat’s total
capacity to 153.1 megawatts, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
