Vision Financial Markets LLC agreed
to pay $525,000 to settle U.S. Commodity Futures Trading
Commission claims that it illegally commingled its own funds
with customers’ securities.  The firm, which took over client cash and accounts last
year from failed brokerage Peregrine Financial Group Inc.,
violated rules from August 2008 to June 2009 by failing to
segregate customers’ assets, not alerting regulators to the
error and making misstatements about the location and handling
of the money, the CFTC said in a statement today.  “Vision, after using commodity futures and options
customer funds to purchase securities, failed to account for and
hold those securities separately for its customers,” the CFTC
said in its order. “Instead, Vision commingled the securities
with its own funds and the funds of its securities customers.”  The violations and misstatements were uncovered in June
2009 during a regulatory examination, the CFTC said. They had
gone undetected because the brokerage didn’t report to the CFTC
or its designated self-regulatory organization that the amount
of money in segregated accounts didn’t meet requirements,
according to the agency.  Vision agreed to settle without admitting or denying the
wrongdoing cited in the CFTC  complaint . A call to the company
was referred to a legal executive who didn’t immediately respond
to a message seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
