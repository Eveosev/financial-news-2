Chad  expects output of crude to
more than triple by 2015 as new  oil fields  located near Lake
Chad will start producing next year, Finance Minister Atteib Doutoum said.  Oil production may reach 200,000 barrels a day in 2014 and
300,000 barrels in 2015, Doutoum said yesterday in an interview
in Abidjan,  Ivory Coast ’s commercial capital. Output fell to
97,000 barrels daily this year from 110,000 barrels in 2012 as
“technical issues” have disrupted drilling operations, Doutoum
said. These will be addressed before year-end, he said,
declining to provide more information.  “Chad is going to record its second oil boom,” he said.  The central African nation’s economic growth will slow to 4
percent this year from 9 percent in 2012, the  International
Monetary Fund  said Sept. 19. Oil provides Chad with as much as 1
trillion CFA francs ($2.1 billion) a year, or about 80 percent
of its revenue, Doutoum said. The country, ruled by President
Idriss Deby since he seized power in a 1990 coup, had a $10.6
billion economy in 2011, according to the  World Bank’s website .  Chad on Sept. 23 issued 85 billion francs of bonds on the
Libreville, Gabon-based Bourse des Valeurs Mobilieres d’Afrique
Centrale and the Douala Stock Exchange in Cameroon, Doutoum told
reporters yesterday. The five-year debt will be on sale until
Nov. 15, he said.  Chad will use the proceeds to fund the construction of a
30-hectare (74-acre) business area in its capital, N’Djamena,
Doutoum said. The project has an estimated cost of 248.4 billion
 CFA francs , he said.  “We aim to become the business hub of Francophone central
 Africa ,” Doutoum said. The business area would include eight
office buildings, a shopping center and the headquarters of the
Oil and Energy Ministry, Doutoum said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
