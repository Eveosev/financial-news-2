Swiss stocks  were little changed,
with the benchmark Swiss Market Index posting a weekly loss amid
concern U.S. lawmakers will fail to agree on a budget and as
borrowing costs rose at an Italian debt auction.  Holcim Ltd. (HOLN)  slipped 0.8 percent as HSBC Holdings Plc
downgraded its rating on the cement maker. Clariant AG and
Givaudan SA retreated, following a gauge of European chemical
companies lower.  Adecco (ADEN)  SA, the world’s largest provider of
temporary workers, advanced 1.8 percent as Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. recommended the shares.  The  SMI (SMI)  fell 0.1 percent to 8,055 at the close of trading
in Zurich, bringing this week’s retreat to 0.6 percent. The
measure has still climbed 4 percent in September, extending its
gain this quarter to 4.8 percent, as the  Federal Reserve 
refrained from reducing its monthly bond purchases. It has
rallied 18 percent so far in 2013, the third-best performance by
a European developed market. The broader Swiss Performance Index
also slipped 0.1 percent today.  “European markets are weaker today amid lower volumes,”
said Roland Schuermann, a trader at Luzerner Kantonalbank AG in
Lucerne,  Switzerland . “Investors are rather cautious ahead of
the weekend, also because of the looming budget dispute in the
U.S.”  Swiss stocks extended losses as Italy sold 3 billion euros
($4.05 billion) of 10-year bonds at a yield of 4.50 percent,
compared with 4.46 percent on Aug. 29. Investors bid for 1.38
times the amount of debt offered, down from 1.52 percent at the
previous auction.  Volume Declines  The volume of shares changing hands in SMI-listed companies
today was 13 percent lower than the average of the past 30 days,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  U.S. lawmakers have until Monday to agree to an emergency
budget to keep the federal government operating from Oct. 1, the
beginning of the 2014 fiscal year, through Dec. 15.  Failure to pass the bill may lead to a government shutdown,
which would cut fourth-quarter economic growth by as much as 1.4
percentage points depending on its length, economists said.  Mark
Zandi  of Moody’s Analytics Inc. estimated a three-to-four week
shutdown would cut growth by 1.4 points. Moody’s projected a 3
percent rate of growth in the fourth quarter without a closure.  Confidence among U.S. consumers declined to a five-month
low in September, according to data released today. The Thomson
Reuters/University of Michigan final index of  sentiment 
decreased to 77.5 this month from 82.1 in August. The median
estimate in a Bloomberg survey called for a drop to 78, after a
preliminary reading of 76.8.  Holcim, Adecco  Holcim, the cement maker that gets 40 percent of its sales
from the Asia Pacific region, lost 0.8 percent to 67.95 Swiss
francs. HSBC cut the stock to neutral, the equivalent of hold,
from overweight, citing weak pricing power in  emerging markets .  Clariant (CLN)  fell 0.9 percent to 15.33 francs and Givaudan
dropped 0.6 percent to 1,328 francs. A gauge of European
chemical shares was among the worst performers of the 19
industry groups in the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  Adecco jumped 1.8 percent to 64.20 francs. Goldman Sachs
raised the stock to buy from neutral, saying improving European
economic data should help the company.  Actelion Ltd. (ATLN)  climbed 1.7 percent to 64.15 francs. UBS
added the drugmaker’s shares to its most preferred list, saying
it expects the Opsumit treatment to be approved by the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration on Oct. 18 for pulmonary arterial
hypertension.  “We believe a clean label could increase consensus
expectations for the drug, which we continue to see as overly
conservative,” Martin Wales, an analyst at UBS, wrote in a
report.  Temenos Group AG (TEMN)  rose 3.7 percent to 22.50 francs as the
banking-software maker posted a $12.1 million profit in the
first half, compared with a loss of $11 million a year earlier.  Edisun Power Europe AG (ESUN)  rallied 24 percent to 30.95 francs.
Shares in the developer of solar plants slumped 17 percent
yesterday after the company said it won’t make a profit in 2014.  To contact the reporter on this story:
