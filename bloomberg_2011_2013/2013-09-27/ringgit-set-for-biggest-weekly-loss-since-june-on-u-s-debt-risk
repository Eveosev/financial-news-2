Malaysia ’s ringgit had its biggest
weekly drop in three months as concern over U.S. budget talks
that risk a government shutdown sapped demand for emerging-market assets. Government bonds fell.  The U.S. Senate plans to vote today on a bill, three days
before federal spending authority runs out and as the country
approaches its borrowing limit. Malaysia is seeking 14.1 billion
ringgit ($4.4 billion) in extra spending this year to pay civil
servants’ salaries, according to a Sept. 23 report in the local
Edge newspaper.  “People are showing some concern about the U.S. debt
ceiling,” said Hamish Pepper, a currency strategist at Barclays
Plc in  Singapore . “The market concern has moved on from the
prospect of foreigners withdrawing from Malaysian government
securities to the fiscal front.”  The ringgit declined 1.9 percent this week and 0.3 percent
today to 3.2251 per dollar as of 4:37 p.m. in Kuala Lumpur,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Its five-day drop is
the biggest since the period ended June 21. One-month implied
volatility, a measure of expected moves in exchange rates used
to price options, fell 35 basis points, or 0.35 percentage
point, today to 10.22 percent.  Malaysia has run a  budget shortfall  since 1998 and the
government estimates that the gap will be 4 percent of gross
domestic product this year compared with 4.5 percent in 2012.  The ringgit and  Thailand ’s baht are likely to underperform
the peso as the  Philippines ’ current-account surplus remains
“solid” at around 3 percent of GDP due to steady remittances,
Goldman Sachs Group Inc economist Fiona Lake wrote in a note
yesterday.  Debt Sale  The yield on Malaysia’s 3.26 percent bonds due March 2018
climbed 13 basis points since Sept. 20 to 3.57 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The rate dropped one
basis point today.  The government today sold 2.5 billion ringgit of notes
maturing September 2043, its first 30-year debt issuance, at
4.935 percent, according to central bank data. The bid-to-cover
ratio of 2.44 times compares with 1.62 for the debut 20-year
Islamic notes sold by Bank Negara Malaysia last month on behalf
of the treasury.  To contact the reporter on this story:
