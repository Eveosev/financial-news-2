Germany requested to review  Holcim
Ltd. (HOLN) ’s proposed acquisition of parts of Cemex Group’s activities
in three countries, the European Union said today.  The European Commission set itself a deadline of Oct. 22 to
decide on the request, according to a notice on its  website . The
deal, which involves Cemex’s cement, ready-mix concrete and
other activities, was notified to EU regulators this month.  The transaction concerns business activities located in
western Germany as well as a small number of plants and sites in
 France  and the Netherlands, according to the EU’s Official
Journal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
