Gold futures rose to a one-week
high after Federal  Reserve Bank  of Chicago President  Charles
Evans  said more signs of strength in the economy are needed to
reduce asset purchases.  “I can’t have tremendous confidence in our economic
situation,” Evans said today in Oslo. “A lot of developments
are still under way. At the moment, the data doesn’t provide us
with confidence to make major adjustments” to monetary
stimulus, he said. Gold also rose on concern that the U.S.
budget deadlock would shut down the government.  “Evans’ remarks are moving the market,” Peter Hug, the
global trading director of Kitco Metals Inc., in  Montreal , said
in a report. “The focus of the market remains on the debt-ceiling impasse.”  Gold futures for December delivery added 1.1 percent to
settle at $1,339.20 an ounce at 1:41 p.m. on the Comex in New
York. Earlier, the price reached $1,345.20, the highest for a
most-active contract since Sept. 20. The metal, up for the
second straight week, has dropped 20 percent this year.  The  U.S. Senate  approved a bill to finance the government
through Nov. 15 after removing language on cutting funding for
the health care law, putting pressure on the House to avoid a
federal shutdown set to start Oct. 1.  The nation faced an impasse over raising the debt ceiling
in 2011 before Congress approved a plan to head off a default
that was signed by the president that August. Gold reached a
record $1,923.70 on Sept. 6, 2011.  Silver futures for December delivery rose 0.3 percent to
$21.831 an ounce.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , platinum futures for
January delivery rose 0.3 percent to $1,419.20 an ounce.  Palladium futures for December delivery advanced 1.2
percent to $731.80 an ounce.  To contact the reporters on this story:
