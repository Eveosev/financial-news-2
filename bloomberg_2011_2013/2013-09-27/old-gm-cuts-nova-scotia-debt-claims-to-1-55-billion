Motors Liquidation Co., a trust for
creditors of  General Motors Co. (GM) ’s old assets, cut $2.67 billion
in claims to $1.55 billion in an out-of-court agreement.  Terms of the settlement reached yesterday include the
reduction of a $1.61 billion claim from Green Hunt Wedlake Inc.
to $477 million, as well as a distribution of some General
Motors stock to holders of debt issued by a Canadian unit in
2003, according to a  filing  with the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission. The noteholders will be allowed a
$1.07 billion unsecured claim.  Motors Liquidation creditors began court-ordered mediation
in June with  hedge funds  that held the notes issued by General
Motors Nova Scotia Finance Co. A trust sued the funds on behalf
of creditors in March 2012, questioning their right to the
$2.67 billion in claims.  The agreement requires court approval. The Nova Scotia
notes at issue were 8.375 percent notes due in 2015 and 8.875
percent notes due in 2023.  General Motors Co. was raised to investment grade for the
first time in eight years this week. Moody’s Investors Service
upgraded Detroit-based GM to Baa3 from Ba1 on Sept. 23, citing
new models for the U.S. market, strength in  China  and what it
calculates as $31 billion of cash, including credit facilities.  The U.S. Treasury Department has reduced its stake in the
automaker to 7.3 percent as part of a program to sell all of its
shares within 12 to 15 months.  The main bankruptcy case is In re Motors Liquidation Co.,
09-50026,  U.S. Bankruptcy Court , Southern District of  New York 
( Manhattan ). The adversary case is Motors Liquidation Company
GUC Trust v Appaloosa Investment Limited Partnership I, 12-09802, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
