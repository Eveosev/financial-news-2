Electronic Arts Inc. (EA)  agreed to pay
$40 million to settle a lawsuit by former college athletes over
use of their images in video games, according to an attorney for
the plaintiffs.  The parties will submit the proposed settlement to the
judge within 30 days,  Michael Hausfeld , an attorney for the
plaintiffs, said today in a telephone interview.  The athletes will be required to submit claims to partake
in the settlement, Hausfeld said. The criteria that will be used
to determine their proceeds, such as the number of games they’re
depicted in, are still to be worked out, he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
