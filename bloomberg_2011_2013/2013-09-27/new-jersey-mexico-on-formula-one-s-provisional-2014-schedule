Formula One’s ruling body said
races in  New Jersey , Russia,  Austria  and Mexico are on a
provisional  22-event schedule  for next year.  The group, known by its French acronym FIA, said the 2014
season would start in Australia on March 16 and end in Brazil on
Nov. 30. Races in New Jersey and Mexico were marked as “subject
to the circuit approval” by the FIA, as was an existing event
in South Korea.  The race in Weehawken, New Jersey, across the Hudson River
from  Manhattan  is tentatively set for June 1, 2014. It was
planned for this year but postponed after organizers misjudged
the commercial and logistical requirements, according to Formula
One chief executive  Bernie Ecclestone .  “The entire Grand Prix of America team is thrilled to join
the 2014 FIA calendar and we look forward to bringing world-class Formula One racing to New Jersey,” race promoter Leo Hindery Jr. said in a statement.  Mexico was last on the calendar in 1992, while Austria
hasn’t hosted a race since 2003.  The inaugural Grand Prix of Russia is scheduled to take
place in Sochi on Oct. 5, eight months after the Black Sea
resort hosts the Winter Olympics.  To contact the reporter on this story:
