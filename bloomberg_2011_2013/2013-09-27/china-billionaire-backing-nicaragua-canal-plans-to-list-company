Beijing Xinwei Telecom Technology
Co., controlled by the Chinese billionaire who has proposed
building a $40 billion canal through  Nicaragua , is planning a
reverse takeover to obtain a listing in  Shanghai .  Beijing Zhongchuang Telecom Test Co. (600485) , listed in Shanghai,
said yesterday it will buy a 96.5 percent stake in Beijing
Xinwei. It will then conduct a private placement of shares that
will make Beijing Xinwei Chairman Wang Jing its largest
shareholder, according a statement to Shanghai’s stock exchange.  The transaction would create the first publicly traded
company among Wang’s assets that span agriculture, investment
and media. In June, Nicaragua granted Wang’s Hong Kong-based
HKND Group a 50-year concession for rights to build an inter-oceanic canal that the Central American country estimated will
cost $40 billion, or more than four times its 2011 gross
domestic product.  Beijing Zhongchuang surged by the 10 percent daily limit in
Shanghai, the biggest one-day gain in four months, after the
stock resumed trading following a one-week suspension.  China ’s
benchmark  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  was little changed at the
mid-day trading break.  The proposed transaction requires approval by the China
Securities Regulatory Commission and shareholders of Beijing
Zhongchuang, according to yesterday’s statement. Wang owns 36.97
percent of Beijing Xinwei’s shares, it said.  Beijing Xinwei, founded in 1995, makes wireless phone gear.
Wang said the company’s goal is to become one of the world’s top
three telecommunications companies in five to 10 years,
according to the company’s website. Xinwei signed a contract
last year worth as much as $300 million to set up a phone
network in Nicaragua.  The company’s 2012 net income fell to 490.6 million yuan
($80.2 million) from 565.9 million yuan a year earlier,
according to Beijing Zhongchuang’s statement. Profit for the
first half of 2013 was 1.68 billion  yuan , it said, without
giving a comparative figure.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
