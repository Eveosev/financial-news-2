Global Wind Power Ltd., backed by
billionaire  Anil Ambani , sees approval this year to sell a new
turbine in India from China Ming Yang Wind Power Group.  Global Wind, a venture between Ambani’s  Reliance Capital
Ltd. (RCAPT)  and Ming Yang, will submit the 1.5-megawatt machine to the
Centre for Wind Energy Technology next month with approval seen
about a month later, Chief Executive Officer Hiren Shah said in
an interview. The center vets turbine models for use in India.  Chinese producers such as  Sinovel Wind Group (601558)  Co., Dongfang
Electric Corp. and  Shanghai Electric Group Co. (601727)  have won Indian
orders to diversify out of an oversupplied home market. Global
Wind, which assembles turbines in India from Ming Yang parts,
will seek approval for a second 1.5-megawatt machine by May.  The arrangement with Ming Yang may allow Global Wind to tap
Chinese lenders for export finance for the construction of wind
farms in  India , where developers’ borrowing costs can be as high
as 15 percent, Shah said in a presentation in Delhi.  Turbines make up 80 percent of building costs. Funding
projects with foreign loans, even after currency hedging, may
lower borrowing costs to as low as 7 percent, Shah said.  Ming Yang and Ambani’s Reliance Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group
Ltd. announced an agreement last year to develop as much as
2,500 megawatts of wind capacity in India by 2015. In November,
China Development Bank Corp. said it may lend as much as $3
billion to the companies after assessing their plans.  To contact the reporter on this story:
