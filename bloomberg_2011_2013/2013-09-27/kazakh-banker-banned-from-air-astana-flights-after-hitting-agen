Air Astana, a venture between the
Kazakh government and  BAE Systems Plc (BA/) , said it will bar a local
banker from flights after an altercation with a travel agent.  Darkhan Botabayev, a member of AO Kazinvestbank’s  board ,
punched the airline’s female employee in the face during a
dispute as he was trying to buy a ticket in Almaty on Sept. 11,
the carrier said in a statement e-mailed today. Kazakh police
declined to investigate the incident, the company said.  Botabayev wasn’t available to comment when  Bloomberg News 
called  Kazinvestbank . An official who picked up the phone at the
lender’s office declined to comment.  Kazinvestbank, Kazakhstan’s 22nd-largest lender by assets,
is owned by Economic Development and Trade Minister Erbolat Dosayev, Environmental Protection Minister Nurlan Kapparov and
Citigroup Venture Capital International Growth Partnership,
according to  Kazakhstan ’s stock exchange  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
