Brazil ’s government approval rating
rebounded from a record low amid faster economic growth and
slower inflation, according to an Ibope poll.  Rousseff’s administration was considered excellent or good
by 37 percent of the 2,002 people surveyed by polling company
Ibope, up from a record-low 31 percent in July. The president’s
personal approval rating rose to 54 percent from 45 percent. The
survey comissioned by the National Industrial Confederation and
conducted from Sept. 14 to 17 has a margin of errror of 2
percentage points.  Still, the government approval remains almost half of the
63 percent record in March, before one million people took the
streets to protest against bus fares increases, corruption and
mis-allocation of public funds. Rousseff’s popularity slipped as
inflation, which breached the upper end of the government’s 6.5
percent inflation target twice this year, eroded economic
growth.  While her approval rating improved, the poll shows
disapproval of inflation policy has increased to 68 percent from
57 percent in June. The central bank has raised the benchmark
 interest rate  four times this year to 9 percent from 7.25
percent to tame inflation that accelerated to 6.7 percent in
June. Consumer prices rose 6.09 percent last month.  The percent of those who disapprove of the interest rate
rose to 71 percent in September from 54 percent in June.  To contact the reporters on this story:
