The cost of insuring corporate and
sovereign bonds in the Asia-Pacific region against non-payment
rose, according to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  climbed 1 basis point to 149.5 basis
points as of 8:04 a.m. in  Hong Kong , Australia & New Zealand
Banking Group Ltd. prices show. The gauge had fallen for the two
previous days, according to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index added 1 basis point to
120 as of 10:02 a.m. in Sydney, according to Westpac Banking
Corp. prices. The benchmark is poised for a 3 basis-point
increase this week, according to data from CMA, which is owned
by McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the
private market.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index was little changed at 92
basis points as of 9:06 a.m. in  Tokyo , according to Citigroup
Inc. prices. The gauge last rose on Sept. 24, CMA data show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
