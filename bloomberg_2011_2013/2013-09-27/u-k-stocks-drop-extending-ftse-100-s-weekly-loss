U.K. stocks  fell, extending the
FTSE 100 Index’s first weekly loss since August, as  Bank of
England  Governor  Mark Carney  told a U.K. newspaper he sees no
need for further stimulus and the U.S. budget deadline neared.  Countrywide Plc dropped 4.9 percent as Alchemy Partners LLP
sold a 5.9 percent stake in the real estate broker. A gauge of
London-listed mining stocks fell 1.7 percent, paring its best
quarter since 2010.  Persimmon Plc (PSN)  led housebuilders lower after
the U.K. government said it will carry out annual checks on its
home-buying-assistance program amid criticism it may lead to
excessive real estate prices.  The FTSE 100 lost 52.93 points, or 0.8 percent, to 6,512.66
at the close of trading in London, extending this week’s retreat
to 1.3 percent. Carney told the Yorkshire Post newspaper that he
has not supported the case for further stimulus because the U.K.
economic recovery is stronger and broader.  “Some people may see Carney’s comments as hawkish,” said
Alan Higgins, U.K. chief investment officer for Coutts & Co. in
London. “I’ll just take it as a statement of fact. We stopped
quantitative easing when the U.K. economy was much weaker so it
would only be crazy to go back.”  The FTSE 100 has climbed 1.6 percent this month as the
 Federal Reserve  unexpectedly refrained from reducing its monthly
asset purchases. The gauge has rallied 4.8 percent in the third
quarter, bringing the 2013 advance to 10 percent. The broader
FTSE All-Share Index fell 0.8 percent today, while Ireland’s
ISEQ Index retreated 0.5 percent.  Budget Deadline  U.S. lawmakers have until Monday to agree to an emergency
budget to keep the federal government operating from Oct. 1, the
beginning of the 2014 fiscal year. The Senate plans to vote
today on a stopgap spending bill and send it back to the House.
A three-to-four week shutdown of the U.S. government would
reduce fourth-quarter economic growth by as much as 1.4
percentage points, said  Mark Zandi  of Moody’s Analytics Inc.  “What’s happening in Washington is a head fake,” said
Higgins, whose firm oversees the equivalent of $49.5 billion
globally. “We’ve seen this many times before and they just
delay it to the very end to see who can get the biggest
political advantage.”  The number of shares changing hands today in FTSE 100-listed stocks was 16 percent lower than the average of the past
30 days, data compiled by Bloomberg data showed.  Countrywide (CWD)  dropped 4.9 percent to 518 pence, the largest
decline since the shares first listed in March. Alchemy sold
about 12.9 million shares in the company at 525 pence each,
according to terms obtained by  Bloomberg News . An institutional
investor also sold a separate 2.4 percent stake at the same
price, the terms showed.  Mining Stocks  A measure of mining companies listed on the FTSE 350 Index
fell 1.7 percent, trimming a 16 percent  quarterly  advance. Rio
Tinto Group and  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the world’s largest mining
companies slipped 2.3 percent to 3,067 pence and 2.2 percent to
1,841 pence.  Anglo American Plc (AAL)  dropped 1.9 percent to 1,540
pence. The shares slid 3.2 percent this week for the biggest
decline in almost three months.  Persimmon dropped 4.3 percent to 1,061 pence, while  Bellway
Plc (BWY)  declined 3.1 percent to 1,262 pence. Bovis Homes Group Plc
slipped 2.7 percent to 712 pence. Chancellor of the Exchequer
 George Osborne  and the Bank of England will reassess the Help-to-Buy program, which allows the purchase of homes with a
deposit as small as 5 percent, every September from 2014, the
Treasury said.  House Prices  Osborne’s plan has drawn criticism from the  International
Monetary Fund  and Business Secretary  Vince Cable , who say it may
spark a property bubble.  Data today  showed U.K. house prices
posted the biggest annual increase in September since July 2010.  SABMiller Plc (SAB) , the world’s second-biggest brewer, dropped
2.1 percent to 3,165 pence. Credit Suisse Group AG cut its
rating on the beverage industry to benchmark, similar to
neutral, from overweight, citing valuations. The Stoxx 600 Food
& Beverage Index trades at 18.2 times projected earnings,
compared with 14.3 times profit for the broader gauge, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Michael Page International Plc (MPI)  increased 1.1 percent to
490.2 pence after Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  upgraded  the stock to
buy from neutral, saying the recruitment firm will benefit from
a pick-up in the European economy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
