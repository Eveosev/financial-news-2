Palm oil headed for a third weekly
decline to cap the worst run since July on speculation that
increasing production will boost reserves in Indonesia and
 Malaysia , the biggest suppliers of the most consumed cooking oil.  The contract for December delivery was little changed at
2,270 ringgit ($705) a metric ton on the Bursa Malaysia
Derivatives at 12:09 p.m. in Kuala Lumpur, down 1.3 percent this
week. A third weekly decline would be the longest streak of such
losses since July 26. Palm for physical delivery in October was
at 2,310 ringgit yesterday, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Palm, which has dropped 13 percent in the past year, is
produced year-round with supply accelerating in the second half
because of growing cycles. Stockpiles will begin to increase
from September and should keep expanding at least until January,
according to Dorab Mistry, director at Godrej International Ltd.  “The market is falling due to higher production, which is
adding to inventories,” said Donny Khor, deputy director of
futures and commodities at RHB Investment Bank Bhd. in Kuala
Lumpur. “Exports are higher, but not good enough to prevent the
piling up of stockpiles.”  Shipments from Malaysia rose 6.5 percent to 1.24 million
tons in the first 25 days of September from the same period a
month earlier, according to surveyor Intertek. That’s slower
than the 13 percent growth in the first 20 days of the month.  Soybeans for delivery in November were little changed at
$13.1575 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade. Soybean oil for
December delivery declined 0.5 percent to 41.85 cents a pound.  Refined palm oil for January delivery fell 0.6 percent to
5,370  yuan  ($877) a ton on the Dalian Commodity Exchange.
Soybean oil decreased 0.5 percent to 7,004 yuan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
