Corn in  South Africa  gained to the
highest level in more than three weeks as the rand declined
against the dollar, increasing the price to import the grain.  White corn for delivery in December, the most active
contract, increased 1.3 percent to 2,372 rand ($234) a metric
ton, the highest since Sept. 2, by the midday close on the South
African Futures Exchange. The yellow variety for delivery in the
same month, rose 1.4 percent to 2,187 rand a ton, the highest
since Sept. 3.  The rand slid for a fourth day and headed for its longest
losing streak in almost two months against the dollar as South
African companies demanded foreign currency to pay for imports
in the continent’s biggest economy. It weakened 1.6 percent to
10.1523 per dollar by 1:48 p.m. in Johannesburg.  “The rand weakened substantially during trade actually, it
caused the upward movement” in corn, Lindy van Blommestein, a
trader at Farmwise Grins (Pty) Ltd., said by phone in
Johannesburg today. “Everyone was totally looking at the rand’s
performance.”  South Africa, the continent’s largest corn producer, will
produce 11.7 million tons of the grain this season, the
Pretoria-based Crop Estimates Committee forecast yesterday.
White corn is one of the nation’s staple foods and the yellow
variety is mostly fed to animals.  Wheat for delivery in December gained 0.9 percent to 3,419
rand, the highest since Aug. 30. Its been rising for five days,
the longest streak since Aug. 22.  To contact the reporter on this story:
