Malian Touareg rebels pulled out of
a peace accord signed in June with the West African nation’s
government, accusing it of failing to respect the terms of the
cease-fire.  The decision, made on Sept. 18, also results from “the
continuation of arbitrary arrests” and the government’s failure
to release political detainees, the National Movement for the
Liberation of Azawad said in a statement published on the news
 website  abamako.com today. Two other separatist groups in
northern  Mali  signed the statement from Ouagadougou, the capital
of neighboring Burkina Faso.  Ethnic Touareg rebels and the Malian government signed a
preliminary peace deal in June which put in place a truce and
enabled the Malian army to enter Kidal, a rebel stronghold,
1,500 kilometers (930 miles) north of the capital, Bamako. It
also paved the way for presidential elections in July and
August. Under the June agreement, further talks were to be held
within 60 days of the election.  Former Prime Minister Ibrahim Boubacar Keita won an Aug. 11
runoff vote and became president more than a year after the
military led a March 2012 coup in response to a lack of
government support in the battle against rebels. French forces
intervened in January to restore order after the Touaregs joined
Islamist militants in an offensive that almost split the nation.
Keita was sworn in on Sept. 4.  Mali vies with Tanzania as  Africa ’s third-biggest gold
producer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
