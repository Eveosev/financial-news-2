Malaysia  sold its first 30-year
bonds, its longest maturity, as the Southeast Asian nation seeks
to set a new benchmark for the local  debt market .  The 2.5 billion ringgit ($776 million) of notes maturing
September 2043 were priced to yield 4.935 percent, and attracted
6.1 billion ringgit of orders, central bank data released today
show. The bid-to-cover ratio of 2.44 times compares with 1.62
for the debut 20-year Islamic debt sold by  Bank Negara Malaysia 
last month on behalf of the treasury.  The Southeast Asian nation is extending its yield curve as
it seeks to set a pricing gauge for companies raising funds
under Prime Minister Najib Razak’s $444 billion development
program to build roads, railways and power plants. Malaysia
follows neighboring  Thailand  and  Indonesia  in issuing debt
maturing in at least 30 years.  “The demand is remarkable and surpasses expectations when
compared to last month’s 20-year Islamic” bonds, said  Michael Chang , head of fixed income at MCIS Zurich Insurance Bhd. in
Kuala Lumpur. “The orders show there’s still strong demand from
onshore investors such as insurers and pension funds.”  Similar-maturity U.S. Treasuries pay 3.71 percent and 30-year Thai debt 4.6 percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
Thailand sold 50-year bonds, Southeast Asia’s longest-maturity
sovereign notes, in December 2010.  The maximum duration for government debt is 25 years in the
Philippines and 15 in  Vietnam , data compiled by Bloomberg show.
 Singapore ’s 30-year bonds yielded 3.16 percent yesterday.  Spending Plan  In Malaysia, highway operator PLUS Bhd. and sovereign
wealth fund 1Malaysia Development Bhd. are the only issuers of
securities due in more than 25 years as Najib embarks on a 10-year spending plan to help achieve the status of a developed
nation by 2020.  Malaysia had $314 billion of debt outstanding as of June
30, compared with $286 billion in Thailand, $118 billion in
Indonesia and $95 billion in the Philippines, according an Asian
Development Bank  report  released this week. Malaysia and
Singapore spent 2.3 percent of their gross domestic product on
infrastructure in 2011, compared with 1.5 percent in Thailand
and 1.6 percent in the Philippines, the report said.  The Najib government’s development spending contributed to
one of the highest levels of debt in  Southeast Asia  at 53.3
percent of GDP, compared with 23 percent in Indonesia, 51.5
percent in the Philippines and 44.5 percent in Thailand,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Default Risk  The cost of insuring Malaysia’s sovereign bonds against
non-payment for five years using credit-default swaps dropped 28
basis points, or 0.28 percentage point, to 122 this month,
according to data provider CMA default prices show.  Malaysia’s budget deficit is forecast to narrow to 4
percent of GDP in 2013 from 4.5 percent last year, according to
the central bank’s annual report released in March.  The ringgit rebounded in September following four straight
months of losses. The currency appreciated 1.8 percent this
month to 3.2260 per dollar as of 2:46 p.m. in  Kuala Lumpur 
today. That has help pare its 2013 loss to 5.2 percent loss.  To contact the reporter on this story:
