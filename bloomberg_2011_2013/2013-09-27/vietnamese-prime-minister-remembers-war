Vietnam's prime minister, Nguyen Tan Dung, has been on the receiving end of U.S. arms -- literally. During an almost hour-long interview with Bloomberg View on Friday, Dung discussed the  possibility  of his country buying weapons from the U.S. He also made this aside: "I have 12 scars on my body and carry fragments of U.S. bullets. I don't like U.S. weapons."  During the Vietnam War, Dung was a decorated medic in the North Vietnamese Army, and was wounded four times. During the interview, he pointed to wounds on his face, neck and legs. Dung generally spoke in laudatory terms of the U.S. and the close ties that have been forged in recent years between the two nations. The prime minister is in New York to address the United Nations General Assembly today. Earlier this morning, he met with Secretary of State John Kerry, himself a decorated veteran of the Vietnam War.  (Albert R. Hunt is a Bloomberg View columnist. Follow him on  Twitter .)
