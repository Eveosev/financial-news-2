The Tampa Bay Rays and  Cleveland
Indians  both won their seventh straight game to maintain their
hold on the American Leagueâ€™s two wild-card playoff spots.  The Rays (90-69) won 4-0 in New York last night to complete
a three-game sweep of the Yankees, while the Indians (89-70)
withstood a four-run rally in the bottom of the ninth inning by
the Twins to win 6-5 at Minnesota.  Tampa Bay holds the first of the wild-card spots given to
the two teams in each league with the best non-division-winning
records. Cleveland now holds the second spot, with the  Texas
Rangers  (88-71) a game behind the Indians after a 6-5 win at
home against the Los Angeles Angels.  The Rays finish their regular season with three games at
Toronto starting today. Cleveland has three more games at
Minnesota, while Texas hosts three more against the Angels.  To contact the reporter on this story:
