The Federal Reserve Bank of New
York allotted $16.622 billion in a test of an overnight fixed-rate reverse repurchase agreement facility that may be used to
aid policy makers when they tighten monetary policy.  The operation at a fixed-rate of 0.01 percent was open to
the Fed’s 139 tri-party reverse repo counterparties, which
includes 94 money market mutual funds, six government-sponsored
entities, 18 banks and the Fed’s 21 primary dealers. The New
York Fed increased the maximum bid amount to $1 billion from
$500 million, beginning with today’s operation.  Fed policy makers, while still buying  bonds  to support the
economy, have also been developing methods to eventually help
withdraw record monetary accommodation. Along with raising the
overnight bank lending rate, Fed officials have said they may
use tools including reverse repos to withdraw or neutralize cash
in the banking system.  In a reverse repo, the Fed lends securities for a set
period, temporarily draining cash from the banking system. At
maturity, the securities are returned to the Fed, and the cash
to its counterparties.  To contact the reporters; on this story:
