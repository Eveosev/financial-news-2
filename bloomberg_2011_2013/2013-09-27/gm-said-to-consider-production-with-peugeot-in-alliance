General Motors Co. (GM)  and  PSA Peugeot
Citroen (UG)  are looking at deepening their alliance with joint
production at one another’s factories, two people familiar with
the matter said.  GM’s Opel division may build the Citroen C3 Picasso at a
factory in Zaragoza, Spain, said the people, who asked not to be
identified because there’s no final decision. The two are also
in early discussions to make the next generation of Opel’s
Zafira van at Peugeot’s plant in Sochaux,  France , the people
said. The automakers declined to comment.  GM and Peugeot set up an alliance last year to help the two
companies return to profit in Europe, where car sales are
heading for their sixth straight annual decline. The two are
aiming for savings of $2 billion with the partnership, which
involved GM taking a 7 percent stake in Peugeot. The companies
have since aligned purchasing and logistics and are working to
develop new models together.  The automakers are both struggling to fill underutilized
facilities. Opel has laid out plans to shut a factory in Bochum,
Germany, by the end of next year, while Peugeot is reducing its
French workforce by 17 percent and closing a plant on the
outskirts of Paris.  The C3 Picasso is currently built in Trnava, Slovakia,
while the Zafira van’s production will move from Bochum to
Ruesselsheim, where Opel is headquartered, in 2015.  French newspaper  Les Echos  first reported the talks earlier
this week.  To contact the reporters on this story:
