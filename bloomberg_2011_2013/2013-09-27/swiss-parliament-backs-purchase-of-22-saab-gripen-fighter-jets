The Swiss parliament backed the
purchase of 22 Gripen combat jets from Sweden’s  Saab AB (SAABB)  for 3.1
billion Swiss francs ($3.4 billion) with opponents given about
three months to seek a national vote on the deal.  Legislators representing Switzerland’s regions endorsed the
deal by a vote of 25 to 17, the Swiss government said today. In
the lower house, the national council, 119 members backed the
purchase and 71 opposed, with four abstentions.  Switzerland plans to spend about 300 million francs per
year on purchasing the combat planes over a 10-year period as it
replaces aging  Northrop Grumman Corp. (NOC)  F-5 Tigers. The Swiss and
Swedish governments have agreed to work jointly on the larger
next generation Gripen NG. Sweden plans to field 60 of the jets,
with deliveries to start in 2018.  Swiss opponents of the deal, including the  Social Democrats 
and Greens, have 100 days to collect the required 50,000
signatures to trigger a national vote, the government said. The
referendum would take place in May or September.  Saab CEO Haakan Buskhe said this week he expects a
referendum. The company this month raised its long-term forecast
for Gripen sales to 400 to 450 jets from about 300.  Saab shares rose as much as 2 percent in Stockholm. They
traded 0.4 percent higher at 132.40 Swedish krona at 4 p.m.
local time, valuing the aerospace and defense company at 14.4
billion krona ($2.2 billion).  European Aeronautic, Defence & Space Co. and  Dassault
Aviation SA (AM)  were the losing bidders in a competition to supply
 Switzerland  with new combat planes. The Swiss government still
has to decide how to replace its fleet of  Boeing Co. (BA)  F/A-18
Hornets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
