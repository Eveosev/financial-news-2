Nik Domanski joined Arcadia
Petroleum Ltd. this week as a North Sea crude trader after
leaving his job in the same role at Freepoint Commodities LLC,
according to two people with knowledge of the matter who asked
not to be identified.  “Arcadia can confirm the staff arrival,” Paul Adams,
chief executive officer of the company in  London , said today in
an e-mailed response to questions. “We have no further
elaboration to offer.”  Domanski joined Freepoint’s London office in July 2012,
according to a note from SparkSpread on Freepoint’s website
dated April 2 of last year. He previously traded crude at Bank
of America Corp.’s Merrill Lynch unit,  BP Plc (BP/)  and Neste
Petroleum in London, the note showed.  Adams also confirmed the departure of Singapore-based
traders Jonathan Cullis, Alan Tham, Roy Zhu and Han Dong. The
oil traders will join GlencoreXstrata Plc’s crude team in
 Singapore , according to two people with knowledge of the move,
who asked not to be identified because the information is
confidential.  Charles Watenphul, a spokesman for Baar, Switzerland-based
Glencore, declined to comment on the hiring. The four traders
weren’t available for confirmation.  Arcadia, the energy trader owned by billionaire  John
Fredriksen , trades crude and oil products, and has offices in
London, Singapore, Brisbane, Cyprus and Rancho  Santa Fe ,
California.  To contact the reporters on this story:
