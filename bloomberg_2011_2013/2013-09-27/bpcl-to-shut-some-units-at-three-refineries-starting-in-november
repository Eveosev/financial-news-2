Bharat Petroleum Corp. (BPCL) ,  India ’s
second-biggest state refiner, will partially shut some secondary
units at its three refineries for maintenance beginning
November.  The work at the 9.5 million metric-ton-a-year Kochi
refinery in southern India will start in mid-November, followed
by the 12 million-ton Mumbai refinery in western India in
December and the 3 million-ton Numaligarh refinery in north-eastern India in January. “Each of the maintenance shutdowns
will be for 25-30 days,” B.K. Datta, BPCL’s refineries
director, said today in an interview in Delhi.  The maintenance shutdowns will cut production of fuels such
as gasoline and diesel, requiring the company to increase
purchases from domestic or overseas refineries.  BPCL is seeking a cargo of gasoline for delivery in October
to Kochi, a company official said on Sept. 25.  To contact the reporter on this story:
