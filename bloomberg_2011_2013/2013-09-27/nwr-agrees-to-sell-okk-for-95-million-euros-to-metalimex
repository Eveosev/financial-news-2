New World Resources Plc (NWR) , the
largest Czech producer of coal for steelmakers, agreed to sell
its OKK coking plant as part of a plan to scale down operations
and stem record losses.  The plant will be sold to Metalimex AS for 95 million euros
($128.5 million), Amsterdam-registered NWR said today in a
regulatory statement. NWR, which operates four active mines as
well as the coking plant, said in May it will seek a buyer for
OKK. Last week it also announced a planned shutdown of its
unprofitable Paskov mine at the end of next year. The company
published a record net loss of 315.4 million euros in the second
quarter.  Prices of coking coal began to plummet last year as clients
such as  ArcelorMittal (MT)  limited production because of smaller
demand for steel from carmakers and other industrial companies.
Before the plunge in demand, NWR invested in machinery for its
Czech mines and prepared the Debiensko mine in  Poland , a project
which it mothballed this year.  “The Directors of NWR believe that the disposal of OKK is
an important step towards becoming a more efficient, leaner and
more flexible mining business,” Chief Executive Officer Gareth
Penny said in the statement.  Moody’s Investors Service on July 24 cut the company’s
rating to Caa1, nine steps below investment grade, from B2,
citing declining coal prices and the prospect of “challenging
market conditions” during the next 12 to 18 months.  NWR’s debt will probably equal 10 times earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization by year end, up
from 3.8 times Ebitda at the end of 2012, Moody’s said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
