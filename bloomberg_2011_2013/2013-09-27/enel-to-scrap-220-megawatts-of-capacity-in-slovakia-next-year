Enel SpA (ENEL) ,  Italy ’s largest utility,
plans to shut down two blocks of Slovakia’s coal-fired power
plant Vojany because planned increases in distribution fees will
make the operation unprofitable.  The closure of units 1 and 2 will reduce Enel’s total
generation capacity in Slovakia by 220 megawatts at the
beginning of 2014, a company spokesman said.  Slovak energy regulator plans to start charging a network
connection fee for 30 percent of reserved capacity beginning on
Jan. 1. The Italian company, which acquired two-thirds of
Slovakia’s largest power producer, Slovenske Elektrarne AS, in
2006, said the fees will disadvantage electricity producers in
Slovakia in comparison with those in other countries.  Enel operates a total capacity of 5,739 megawatts in
Slovakia, including two nuclear, two coal-fired, two
photovoltaic and 34 hydroelectric plants, according to the
company’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
