Volkswagen AG (VOW) , Europe’s largest
automaker, plans to delist both ordinary and preference shares
from the London Stock Exchange effective Oct. 28 due to low
trading volume.  The application for delisting has been made to the
Financial Conduct Authority, the Wolfsburg, Germany-based
company said in a regulatory filing.  “The trading volume is too low to justify the related
administrative efforts,” Marco Dalan, a VW spokesman, said by
telephone.  VW has been stepping up efforts to cut costs to offset
shrinking demand in its home region, where new-car sales are
sliding to a 20-year low. Volkswagen steered through the
European car industry gloom better than most mass-market peers,
mainly because of its large presence in  China  and profits from
upscale brands such as Porsche and Audi.  To contact the reporter on this story:
