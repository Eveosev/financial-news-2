AT&T Inc. (T) , the largest U.S. phone
company, named  KeyCorp (KEY)  Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Beth Mooney as a director, expanding its board to 14 members.  Mooney -- who runs Cleveland-based KeyCorp, Ohio’s second-largest bank -- will serve on AT&T’s corporate development and
finance committee, according to a statement. Mooney becomes the
fourth woman on AT&T’s board and the second to be appointed in
the past three months.  Mooney brings banking expertise to AT&T’s board at a time
when financial services are increasingly conducted over mobile
devices. Mooney took over as KeyCorp CEO in 2011, replacing
Henry L. Meyer, who retired. She had been KeyCorp’s chief
operating officer.  “Beth is an exceptional executive and will be a great
addition to our board,” Randall Stephenson, chairman and CEO of
Dallas-based AT&T, said in the statement. “Her outstanding
record of leadership, management expertise and accomplished
career in the financial-services industry will be invaluable to
us.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
