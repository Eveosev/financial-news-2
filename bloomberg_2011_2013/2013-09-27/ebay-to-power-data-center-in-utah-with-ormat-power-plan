EBay Inc. (EBAY) , operator of the world’s
biggest online marketplace, will work with  Ormat Technologies
Inc. (ORA)  to develop a 5-megawatt waste-heat recovery plant to help
provide electricity to its  data center  in Salt Lake City.  The plant, which will be built and operated by Ormat, will
sell power directly to EBay under a 20-year contract, the Reno,
Nevada based geothermal and waste heat energy developer said in
a statement.  The agreement is part of EBay’s effort to get at least 8
percent of its energy from clean sources by 2015. EBay is one of
a growing number of businesses that own dedicated power plants
or have signed agreements to buy electricity directly from plant
operators instead of utilities, often using renewable sources.
The strategy provides more stable electricity costs, said Bob
Sullivan, Ormat’s vice president of business development.  “It’s cleaner and provides a hedge against price swings in
the cost of fossil fuels,” Sullivan said in an interview.  Ormat has built more than 160 megawatts of waste-heat
recovery plants in  North America . The technology is fairly
mature and can utilize any nearby source of waste heat such as
industry plants, gas compression or even fuel cells, Sullivan
said.  “This milestone points to our belief that commerce can be
fundamentally more sustainable than it is today,” Dean Nelson,
vice president of global foundation services at EBay said in the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
