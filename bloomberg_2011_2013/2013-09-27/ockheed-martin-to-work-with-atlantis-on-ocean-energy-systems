Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT) , the largest
defense contractor, will work with a U.K. tidal energy-turbine
maker to develop and test the technology as it comes to market.  Lockheed will work with Atlantis Resources Corp. to design,
develop and engineer a 1.5-megawatt turbine to be installed in
Canada’s Fundy Ocean Research Center in early 2015, the London-based tidal-power company said today in an e-mailed statement.  “Tidal energy is a very large, almost untapped, resource
available on a global scale,” Tim Fuhr, director of ocean
energy programs at Lockheed Martin, said in the statement.  The agreement between the two companies, working together
since 2011, will also see turbines used at the MeyGen project in
northern Scotland after planning consent was received Sept. 16.  MeyGen Ltd., a venture between Atlantis,  Morgan Stanley (MS)  and
 GDF Suez (GSZ) , will install turbines, starting with a 9-megawatt
demonstration, possibly expanding eventually to 398 megawatts.  Lockheed Martin has provided engineering expertise for
other marine energy projects. In 2011, it agreed to work with
Ocean Power Technologies Corp. on a commercial-scale wave power
development in  Oregon . In April, the company said it was working
with Reignwood Group to develop a plant in southern China that
would produce power using differences in sea temperature.  To contact the reporter on this story:
