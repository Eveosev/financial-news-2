Canada’s budget deficit widened in
July as the federal government’s revenue declined and borrowing
costs rose.  The deficit for the month grew to C$1.98 billion ($1.93
billion) from C$1.35 billion a year earlier, the finance
department said in a  statement . Revenue fell 2.6 percent and
public debt charges increased 3.8 percent to C$2.48 billion.  Finance Minister Jim Flaherty’s annual budget, released in
March, projected a deficit for the current fiscal year that
began April 1 of C$18.7 billion, down from C$25.9 billion the
previous year, in large part by reducing direct program
expenses.  The government  anticipates  direct program expenses, which
don’t include transfers to provinces or individuals, to fall to
C$119.2 billion this year from C$122.1 billion. Spending on that
component in the first four months of the current year rose 5.5
percent to C$34.2 billion.  The budget gap for the first four months of the fiscal year
widened to C$4.54 billion from C$4.16 billion. The finance
department said the government is still on track to meet its
2013 budget targets.  Total program expenses including transfers are up 3.4
percent in the four-month period, while revenue has increased
2.6 percent. Spending rose 0.1 percent in July.  To contact the reporter on this story:
