The U.S. Treasury would continue
operating debt programs and managing its cash position if the
government shuts down next week, the department said today.  The Internal Revenue Service would stop responding to
taxpayer questions by telephone in the case of a closure, the
Treasury said in a blog post.  The IRS also would halt “non-automated collections and
tax-processing activities, but would continue activities
necessary for the protection of government property,” the
Treasury said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
