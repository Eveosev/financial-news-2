Afghan President Hamid Karzai
called  China  “a stable, strong friend and neighbor” in a
meeting with President Xi Jinping today, as officials from the
nations signed treaties on extradition and economic cooperation.  “The people of  Afghanistan  are your neighbors and regard
China as a stable, strong friend and neighbor,” Karzai said at
the meeting, according to a pool report from the meeting in
Beijing. Karzai met separately with Premier Li Keqiang today.  The U.S. plans to withdraw most of its troops from
Afghanistan by December 2014 with a small force staying on to
train Afghans and conduct counter-terrorism operations.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
