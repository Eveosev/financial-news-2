Poland ’s government approved the
2014 draft budget, which envisages the deficit narrowing after a
revamp of the country’s privately managed pension funds.  The gap will drop to 47.7 billion zloty ($15.3 billion)
from 51.6 billion zloty planned for this year, the government’s
press office said in a statement today. Revenue will reach 276.9
billion zloty, while spending will be 324.6 billion zloty, it
said. The document will be sent to parliament for approval.  Poland this month proposed taking over 51.5 percent of
assets, mostly government bonds, held by privately run pension
funds. It plans to cancel the bonds and reduce public debt. The
government, which trails in polls before 2015 elections, wants
to spur recovery in the European Union’s largest eastern economy
with this year’s growth forecast at the weakest pace since at
least 1997.  To contact the reporter on this story:
