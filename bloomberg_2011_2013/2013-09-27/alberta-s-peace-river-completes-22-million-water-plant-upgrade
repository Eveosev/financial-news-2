The Albertan town of Peace River,
in the heart of the Canadian province’s shale-gas region,
completed the upgrading of its water-treatment plant.  The upgrade cost C$22.5 million ($21.8 million) with most
of that being funded by the province, the government of Canada
said today in a statement. The new system includes additional
clarification, sedimentation and filtration functions.  “This is a once-in-a-generation project that will benefit
our residents and community for many decades to come,” said
Lorne Mann, mayor of the town, in the statement.  Peace River, 486 kilometers (302 miles) northwest of
 Edmonton , contributed C$4.9 million to the project, using some
of its Gas Tax Fund allocation toward the upgrades.  To contact the reporter on this story:
