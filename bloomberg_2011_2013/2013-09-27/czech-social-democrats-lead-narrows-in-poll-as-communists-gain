Voter support for the Czech Social
Democrats declined in September as the Communist Party gained a
month before the country holds early elections, according to a
poll by researcher Stem.  The Social Democrats would get 28 percent of votes,
according to an election model by Stem and based on a Sept.
15-21 survey of 1,043 people. That’s down from 30 percent in a
similar poll conducted between Aug. 29 and Sept. 8, Stem said
today in an e-mailed statement. Support for the Communists rose
to 17 percent from 15 percent in the earlier poll.  Following three years of austerity that damped household
spending and exacerbated a recession, polls suggest the Oct.
25-26 elections will bring in a government led by the Social
Democrats, who pledge to raise spending to boost  economic
growth . The party may need a partner to secure a majority in
parliament, with the Stem poll showing that as many as seven
parties have a chance of entering the chamber.  “If the election result leads to the creation of a one-party government, then we’re prepared to hold talks about
supporting such a government,” Communist Party Chairman Vojtech
Filip said in a Sept. 24 interview. “We’re ready to be part of
a broader support too, which means it can also include other
political parties.”  The Civic Democrats, the strongest member of the previous
pro-austerity ruling coalition that collapsed in June amid an
illegal spying scandal, had 12.5 percent backing in Stem’s
election model. TOP09, the main advocate of narrowing the budget
gap in the previous cabinet, had 11 percent support, Stem said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
