China Huishan Dairy Holdings Co. (6863) ,
the milk producer backed by billionaire Cheng Yu-tung, fell in
its Hong Kong trading debut after a $1.3 billion initial public
offering that was priced at the top  of its marketed range.  The  stock  closed at HK$2.59, a 3 percent decline from its
offer price of HK$2.67, in Hong Kong today. The benchmark Hang
Seng Index gained 0.4 percent.  The value of Hong Kong IPOs has reached $7.8 billion this
year, poised to surpass the $8 billion for the whole of last
year. The value is still far below the $20 billion in 2011,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The company’s pricing at the top-end was too aggressive as
Hong Kong’s IPO market has not fully recovered, said Ronald Wan,
chief  China  advisor at Asian Capital (HK) Co.  “The high-end price makes it less attractive to investors,
who may be waiting on the sideline for lower valuations,” said
Wan. “The market is not stable yet and there are no sure-win
IPOs.”  The company had offered shares at HK$2.28 to HK$2.67 each
as it and investors sold at least HK$10 billion ($1.3 billion)
of stock. Huishan was established in 2009 as a raw milk
producer, and has moved into the business of selling liquid milk
and milk powder products, grain processing and trading.  Expansion Plans  Huishan and its investors sold a total of 3.8 billion
shares, with the company raising HK$7.52 billion after deducting
underwriting fees, it said yesterday.  The company, based in Shenyang city in northeast China,
owned more than 106,000 dairy cows, the second largest herd in
the nation, as of end 2012, the company said in its prospectus,
citing researcher Frost & Sullivan. Sales rose 92 percent to
2.55 billion  yuan  ($417 million) in the year ended March from a
year earlier, the company said.  About a third of the proceeds will be used to construct 45
new dairy farms in the northeastern province of Liaoning, and
another 17 percent to import at least 75,000 cows from  Australia 
or New Zealand over the next three years, it said.  The dairy producer also plans to spend HK$864 million on a
milk powder production plant, with an annual capacity of 33,000
tons, which will be completed by March 2017.  Billionaire Holdings  As Huishan Dairy started trading, its founder Yang Kai has
become a billionaire with his about 49 percent holding. His
shares are worth $2.3 billion, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Well Ease Ltd., a British Virgin Islands holding company,
will own 1.67 billion shares, according to a Huishan prospectus.
Cheng owns an 80 percent stake in Well Ease. The rest of Well
Ease is owned by a trust for Katherine Law, daughter of former
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. managing director Eddie Law, according
to the prospectus.  Cheng, who has a net worth of $19.3 billion, according to
the Bloomberg Billionaire’s Index, is Hong Kong’s fourth-richest
individual and owns 89 percent of Chow Tai Jewellery Group Ltd.
and almost 39 percent of land developer New World Development
Co.  China is pushing to raise standards in its dairy industry
as consumers’ distrust of local milk has driven them to source
products overseas or turn to foreign brands. Formula makers need
to own their milk sources and have research and development
capability, according to a draft of new rules for the baby-milk
industry published in August.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
