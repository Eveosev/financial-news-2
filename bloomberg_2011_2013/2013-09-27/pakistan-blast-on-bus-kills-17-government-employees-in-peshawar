A blast on a bus killed at least 17
government employees in  Pakistan ’s northwestern city of
 Peshawar , rattling a city still grieving from a church bombing
five days ago that killed 81 people.  Another 35 people were injured on the bus carrying the
employees back home from work, Shaukat Yousafzai, provincial
health minister, said by phone. A remote-controlled device was
used to detonate about 6 kilograms of explosives, according to
Nasir Khan Durrani, inspector general police of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province.  Two  suicide bombers  attacked a Christian church service in
Peshawar on Sept. 22, the biggest-ever attack on religious
minorities in Pakistan. More than 96 percent of the country’s
193 million people are Muslim, according to the CIA World
Factbook.  The attacks come as Prime Minister  Nawaz Sharif ’s three-month government tries to initiate dialogue with militants to
end more than a decade of violence that has destabilized the
nuclear-armed nation. This month the country’s political leaders
authorized Sharif to approach militants for talks, a consensus
now at risk after the Peshawar bombings and the assassination of
a major-general on Sept. 15.  As many as 1,222 people, including 425 police and security
officials and 797 civilians, have been killed in 858 terrorist
incidents across Pakistan this year to August, according to the
 Interior Ministry . That included 25 suicide attacks and 60 bomb
blasts.  To contact the reporters on this story:
