Panasonic Corp. (6752)  is poised to agree
to sell its health-care unit to  KKR & Co. (KKR)  for about 150 billion
yen ($1.5 billion) today, according to two people with knowledge
of the matter.  The Japanese electronics company will sell about 80 percent
of  Panasonic Healthcare Co.  to the U.S. private equity firm and
keep 20 percent, the people said, asking not to be named before
a statement scheduled for release later today.  Panasonic Healthcare, which provides digital medical record
systems and makes instruments that measure blood glucose, would
be KKRâ€™s biggest acquisition in  Japan , data compiled by
Bloomberg show. Osaka-based Panasonic is selling control of the
unit as it focuses on a 250 billion-yen plan to reverse  losses 
at its electronics business in the next two years.  The Nikkei newspaper reported the transaction earlier
today. Chieko Gyobu, a spokeswoman for Panasonic in  Tokyo ,
declined to comment on the sale, as did a spokesman for KKR in
the Japanese capital.  New York-based KKR got preferential negotiating rights
after two rounds of bidding for Panasonic Healthcare, three
people with knowledge of the matter said earlier this month.  To contact the reporters on this story:
