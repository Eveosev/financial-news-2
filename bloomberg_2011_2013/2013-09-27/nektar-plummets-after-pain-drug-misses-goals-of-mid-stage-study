Nektar Therapeutics (NKTR) , a developer of
drugs for pain and cancer, sank the most in five years after its
experimental chronic pain therapy failed to show enough benefit
in a mid-stage study.  Nektar fell 24 percent to $10.54 at 4 p.m. New York time
for the biggest decline since April 9, 2008. The shares of the
San Francisco-based company have gained 42 percent this year.  Nektar’s drug, NKTR-181, is designed to enter the brain
slowly to avoid the euphoric high feeling that can lead to abuse
of opioid painkillers. Though patients on the medicine
experienced less pain during the study, those on placebo didn’t
have an expected increase in pain, the company said in a
statement yesterday.  “Even though the trial clearly failed, there should be a
path forward for this safe and efficacious opioid,” Simos Simeonidis, an analyst with Cowen & Co., wrote in a research
note today. “We reiterate our outperform rating and view this
weakness as a buying opportunity.”  The study of 213 patients was in the second of three phases
generally required for regulatory approval.  To contact the reporter on this story:
