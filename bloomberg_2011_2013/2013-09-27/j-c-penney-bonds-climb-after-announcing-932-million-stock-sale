J.C. Penney Co.’s  bonds  climbed and
credit-default swaps tied to its debt tightened after the
department-store chain announced a share offering to raise as
much as $932 million.  The retailer’s $200 million of 6.875 percent bonds due
October 2015, its nearest maturity, increased 2.1 cents to 93.25
cents on the dollar to yield 10.65 percent as of 9:57 a.m. in
New York, according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of
the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.  Credit swaps protecting against losses on the debt, which
typically fall as confidence improves, declined 1.8 percentage
points to 19.5 percent upfront as of 10:30 a.m., according to
data provider CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill Financial Inc.
and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the privately
negotiated market.  Less than a day after the company said it was “pleased”
with its turnaround efforts, Plano, Texas-based J.C. Penney said
it would sell 84 million shares at $9.65 each, 7.4 percent below
yesterday’s close.  The stock plunged this week after a Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. debt analyst said the company’s cash will be strained this
quarter, and fell 9.4 percent today to $9.45. The offering is
“another bandaid” for the retailer, according to debt-research
firm CreditSights Inc.  ‘Clear Positive’  “The liquidity boost supports our view that the company
will have sufficient funds to pay off its 2015 bonds at
maturity,”  James Goldstein , a New York-based credit analyst at
CreditSights, said in a note published yesterday. “The extra
equity injection is a clear positive for liquidity for J.C.
Penney, but it is by no means a guarantee that the company’s
glidepath towards a full scale turnaround will be free from
major turbulence.”  The retailer said today it will end the fiscal year with
about $1.3 billion in liquidity, excluding the offer proceeds.
On Aug. 20, it predicted more than $1.5 billion, a forecast that
didn’t assume it would need any additional outside financing.  The company’s $400 million of 5.65 percent notes due 2020
climbed 2 cents to 77 cents to yield 10.54 percent as of 10:54
a.m., Trace data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
