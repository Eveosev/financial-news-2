America Movil SAB (AMXL) , which announced
plans in August to make a takeover bid for  Royal KPN NV (KPN) , said it
probably won’t make a formal offer until October because it
needs more time to negotiate with the Dutch carrier.  America Movil is still in talks with KPN and “making good
progress toward finalizing preparations” to make its offer of
2.40 euros a share, a move that was previously slated for
September, according to a filing today. The company said it
continues to evaluate all options, including its right to drop
the bid.  The Mexico City-based wireless carrier, controlled by
billionaire  Carlos Slim , acquired a stake of about 30 percent in
KPN last year. The new bid would boost its holdings in the
former Dutch phone monopoly to more than 50 percent, part of a
strategy to expand beyond Latin America.  KPN’s foundation, an independent organization set up to
protect the company’s interests, has expressed opposition to the
America Movil takeover. It exercised an option in August to
acquire preferred shares to impede what it described as a
hostile takeover. The option gave it just under 50 percent of
issued and voting stock, almost enough to block America Movil’s
offer for majority control.  Stefan Simons, a KPN spokesman, didn’t immediately respond
to a request for comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
