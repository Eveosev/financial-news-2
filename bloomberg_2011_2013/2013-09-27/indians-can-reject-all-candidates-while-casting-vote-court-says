Indians for the first time will be
able to reject all the candidates when casting their vote, the
country’s top court ruled, saying it will improve democracy.  India ’s  Supreme Court  asked the Election Commission to give
voters a button to select “none of the above candidates” on
voting machines ahead of next year’s election, said Sanjay
Parikh, a lawyer for the  People’s Union for Civil Liberties .  “We’ll be able to eliminate so many people by this process
and empower voters,” Parikh said outside court. “Many times
I’ve said no, I can’t cast my vote, and come back home.”  The reputation of India’s politicians has been damaged by
graft scandals that led to protests in parliament, repeatedly
disrupting the legislature, as well as rising criminality.  The number of lawmakers charged with offenses has more than
doubled in the last 15 years. Almost a third of federal and
state legislators face charges that include murder, rape and
kidnapping, according to the  Association for Democratic Reforms .  To contact the reporters on this story:
