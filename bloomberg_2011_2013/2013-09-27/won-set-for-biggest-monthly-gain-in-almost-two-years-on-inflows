  South Korea ’s won was set for its
biggest monthly gain in almost two years after foreign funds
pumped money into the nation’s stocks.  Government bonds  climbed.  The won strengthened 3.1 percent in September to 1,076.66
per dollar as of 10:32 a.m. in  Seoul , the best performance since
October 2011, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
currency declined 0.1 percent today and this week.  Overseas investors bought $6.8 billion more local equities
than they sold this month, exchange data show. South  Korea 
posted an August current-account surplus of $5.7 billion today,
compared with a revised $6.8 billion in July, and the nation
is likely to record a $53 billion excess this year “without
much difficulty,”  Bank of Korea  Director General Jung Yung Taek
said. The U.S. unexpectedly filed fewer jobless claims in the
week through Sept. 21, official data showed yesterday.  “As the global recovery seems on track, we expect more
foreign funds coming into the local market, which will support
the won,” said Jude Noh, a currency trader at Suhyup Bank in
Seoul. “Although the August current-account surplus figures
didn’t meet expectations, which may have some downward pressure
on the currency today, the bigger current is for a strong won.”  Noh forecast the won will reach 1,050 versus the dollar
this year. Credit Suisse Group AG raised its three-month
estimate for the won this week to 1,060 from 1,075, citing the
current-account surplus and capital inflows.  ‘Continue Intervening’  “The Bank of Korea is likely to continue intervening to
manage the pace of won appreciation, but we expect it to be
overwhelmed by the magnitude of inflows,” Credit Suisse
strategists including Singapore-based Ray Farris wrote in a
report on Sept. 25.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves
in the  exchange rate  used to price options, fell 94 basis points,
or 0.94 percentage point this month, to 7.02 percent. The gauge
fell 20 basis points today.  South Korea will issue 97.9 trillion won ($91 billion) of
treasury bonds in 2014, Kim Jin Myung, director of the  Finance
Ministry ’s treasury bureau, said yesterday, confirming a report
by Yonhap News. The country will sell 88.4 trillion won of the
debt this year, according to Yonhap.  The yield on the 2.75 percent bonds due June 2016 declined
four basis points this month to 2.84 percent. It fell one basis
point today and was unchanged this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
