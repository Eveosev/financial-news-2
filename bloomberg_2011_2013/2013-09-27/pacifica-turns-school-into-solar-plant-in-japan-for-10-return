Pacifica Capital K.K., a Japanese
real estate asset manager, has acquired land to develop a solar
project that will generate return of as much as 10 percent, said
Chief Executive Officer Seth Sulkin.  A special purpose company established by Pacifica bought
47,239 square meters (508,476 square feet) of land that
previously housed a high school from the local government in
Ibaraki prefecture, north of  Tokyo , for 100 million yen ($1
million) yesterday, Sulkin said. The project is scheduled for
completion in August 2014 and can generate as much as 2.9
megawatts, according to a company statement today.  Pacifica is trying to take advantage of unused properties
in Japan as schools are forced to merge because of a declining
 birthrate . Investments in offices in Japan have an annual yield
of 4.7 percent and distribution centers return 5.4 percent,
according to  Investment Property Databank Ltd.   “We are trying to help local communities that are
suffering from falling population by finding creative ways to
re-use facilities that are no longer needed for their original
purpose,” said Sulkin in a telephone interview in Tokyo today.
The solar plant’s “return is much higher than what traditional
real estate can achieve and the stability of income is far
better than real estate.”  The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry  sets the price
at which utilities have to buy electricity from independent
power producers at a level that allows a 6 percent return over
20 years, according to the ministry’s website.  About 20 percent of residential areas in  Japan  will become
ghost towns -- devoid of population -- by 2050, according to a
land ministry forecast.  To contact the reporter on this story:
