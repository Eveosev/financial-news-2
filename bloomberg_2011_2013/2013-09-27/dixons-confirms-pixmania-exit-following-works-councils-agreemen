Dixons Retail Plc (DXNS)  said it completed
consultations with works councils for the sale of its online
unit Pixmania and plans to close the transaction in December.  The U.K. electronics retailer will pay about 69 million
euros ($93 million) in cash to support the unprofitable business
after its purchase by  Germany ’s  Mutares AG (MUX) , Dixons said today in
a statement, confirming an initial Sept. 5 announcement.  Today’s news means that  Hemel Hempstead , England-based
Dixons has agreed to exit two money-losing businesses this
month. The retailer is also selling its Turkish operations to
Bimeks Bilgi Islem & Dis Ticaret AS as it focuses more on the
U.K., where it owns the Currys and PC World chains.  “I am delighted that we have been able to conclude
consultations with the works councils so swiftly,” Dixons Chief
Executive Officer Sebastian James said in today’s statement.
“This is testament to the strength of the plans that Mutares
has for the business.”  Pixmania has lost money for the last two financial years,
weighing on Dixons’ progress. Losses more than doubled last year
to 31.3 million pounds and like-for-like sales fell 28 percent
in the first quarter of the current financial year.  Dixons paid 266 million pounds for a controlling stake in
2006. Pixmania sells in 14 countries and also operates a
software business that develops Internet platforms used by
Carrefour SA and French clothing retailer Celio.  Closing the business would have cost more than 90 million
euros, Dixons Finance Director Humphrey Singer said Sept. 5.  To contact the reporter on this story:
