Indian (SENSEX)  stock-index futures swung
between gains and losses.  SGX CNX Nifty Index futures  for October delivery fell 0.1
percent to 5,937.0 at 10:29 a.m. in Singapore, after rising as
much as 0.7 percent. The underlying CNX  Nifty (NIFTY)  Index on the
National Stock Exchange of India Ltd. added 0.1 percent to
5,882.25 yesterday. The S&P BSE Sensex gained 0.2 percent to
19,893.85. The Bank of  New York  Mellon India ADR Index of U.S.-
traded shares increased 0.6 percent to 1,020.04. One-month rupee
forwards climbed for a third day to 62.51 per dollar.  India’s rupee climbed for a second day yesterday on
optimism the central bank will succeed in its efforts to boost
the local supply of dollars and support a currency that dropped
to a record low on Aug. 28.  Reserve Bank  of India Governor
Raghuram Rajan will add to last week’s surprise interest-rate
increase after specifying he will use consumer-price inflation
as the main guide for monetary policy for the first time, seven
of 10 analysts said in a Bloomberg News survey.  “Investors are looking forward for further cues to
decide market trend,” Nidhi Saraswat, analyst with Bonanza
Portfolio Ltd., said by e-mail. “RBI has tightened liquidity in
the market by increasing the repurchase rate. If it takes some
more steps to bring liquidity in the market again, this would
boost  market sentiment  and buying can be seen.”  A  panel  he set up after becoming governor on Sept. 4 is due
to report by December on revising the monetary-policy framework.  Core inflation  remains high, Rajan told reporters yesterday
during a visit to Frankfurt, Germany. Domestic inflation is a
better policy anchor than the exchange rate for emerging-market
central banks, he said.  The Sensex has risen 2.4 percent this year and  trades  at
13.8 times projected 12-month earnings, compared with the five-year average of 14.1 times, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The
MSCI Emerging Markets Index is trading at 10.5 times.  Overseas funds bought a net $69.4 million of domestic
shares on Sept. 25, data from the regulator showed yesterday.
International investors have purchased a net $2.04 billion of
the nation’s stocks this month, poised for the first monthly net
inflow since May.  To contact the reporter on this story:
