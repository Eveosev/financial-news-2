The decline in  South Africa ’s
currency and the spread of pessimism in  emerging markets  may be
exaggerated, Reserve Bank Governor Gill Marcus said.  Gloom over the outlook for developing economies is
“probably overdone,” Marcus said in a speech at a business
forum in Johannesburg today. She said South Africa’s rand
“tends to overshoot” when there are broader movements on
 currency markets .  The rand lost more than 15 percent against the dollar this
year, making it the worst performer among 16 major currencies
tracked by Bloomberg. Other emerging-market currencies have also
slid on expectations the U.S. Federal Reserve will start to
scale back its monetary stimulus.  Marcus said such action by the Fed is “inevitable” at
some point and emerging markets have been given a “taste” of
what will happen when it comes.  She said the rand’s decline didn’t stem from policy
mistakes on South Africa’s part, though she warned of a loss of
competitiveness, partly caused by rising labor costs, that’s
reflected in the country’s widening current-account  deficit . The
gap widened to 6.5 percent of gross domestic product in the
second quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
