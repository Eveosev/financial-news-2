Iran  will continue negotiations
with atomic monitors next month over additional access to
suspected nuclear sites after today’s latest round of talks.  Officials from the  International Atomic Energy Agency  will
meet their Iranian counterparts on Oct. 28, the sides said today
in Vienna after adjourning a four-and-a-half hour meeting that
both participants called “constructive.” No location was given
for the next round.  It was the first encounter between Iran’s new envoy, Reza
Najafi, and the IAEA’s new top inspector, Tero Varjoranta. The
Iranian diplomat said before the meetings that “nobody should
expect” the sides to settle their differences today.  Iran and the IAEA have been negotiating since January 2012
over an agreement that would allow inspectors access to sites,
including a key army installation alleged to have housed
undeclared atomic work. While the agency routinely verifies that
Iran hasn’t diverted any of its declared nuclear stockpile for
weapons, it published information in November 2011 that Iran may
have worked on an atomic-bomb trigger at its Parchin military
complex 20 kilometers (12 miles) southeast of Tehran.  The U.S. and its allies accuse Iran of seeking nuclear
weapons, a charge repeatedly denied by the Persian Gulf nation,
home to the world’s fourth-biggest proven oil reserves.
President Hassan Rouhani’s election in August lowered crude  oil
prices  on speculation tensions may ease over the nation’s
nuclear program.  To contact the reporter on this story:
