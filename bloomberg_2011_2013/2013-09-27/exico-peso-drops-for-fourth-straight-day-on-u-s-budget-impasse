Mexico ’s peso declined for a fourth
day in its longest stretch of losses in September on speculation
the U.S. budget impasse will damp growth for the Latin American
country’s biggest trading partner.  The currency depreciated 0.6 percent to 13.1384 per dollar
at 9:15 a.m. in Mexico City, extending its weekly decline to 2.1
percent. Yields on peso bonds maturing in 2024 were unchanged at
6.04 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
yields are up 0.19 percentage point since Sept. 20.  The weekly decline in the Mexican peso was the biggest
among major dollar counterparts tracked by Bloomberg on concern
a possible U.S. government shutdown would curtail investment
flows into Mexico. The U.S. is the destination for about 80
percent of its exports.  “Investors began to take profits from the peso waiting for
bad news,” Eduardo Rodriguez, a trader at Casa de Bolsa Finamex
SAB, said in a telephone interview from Guadalajara, Mexico.
“We’re very connected to the U.S. economy. If things are
paralyzed there, it’s going to have economic effects.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
