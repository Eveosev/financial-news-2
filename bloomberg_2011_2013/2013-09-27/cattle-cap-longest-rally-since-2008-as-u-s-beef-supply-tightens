Cattle futures rose for the eighth
straight session, capping their longest rally since November
2008, on mounting concern that U.S. herds are shrinking as
demand for exported beef increases.  Feedlots had 7.2 percent fewer cattle being fattened for
slaughter on Sept. 1 than a year earlier, a U.S. Department of
Agriculture report on Sept. 20 showed. Exports of beef during
the first seven months of 2013 were up 2.8 percent from a year
earlier, USDA data show. Cattle futures have jumped 12 percent
since touching a 10-month low in May.  “The feed report really catapulted prices higher,”  Lane Broadbent , the vice president of Kis Futures Inc. in  Oklahoma
City ,  Oklahoma , said in a telephone interview. This week’s rally
is “based off the assumption that our supplies are going to get
tighter and tighter,” he said.  Cattle futures for December delivery rose 0.4 percent to
close at $1.32075 a pound at 1 p.m. on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, ending the week up 1.8 percent. Prices have rallied
4.2 percent in September, heading for the biggest monthly
advance since May 2012.  As of Jan. 1, the cattle herd was at the smallest since
1952 after the worst drought since the 1930s parched pasture
lands and forced ranchers to send more animals to be
slaughtered. Feedlots lost about $52 a head on average in
August, according to  Rich Nelson , chief strategist at Allendale
Inc. in McHenry,  Illinois .  Feeder-cattle futures for November settlement slid 0.1
percent to $1.64925 a pound on the CME.  To contact the reporter on this story:
