Canadian Prime Minister  Stephen
Harper  said the proposed $4.7 billion acquisition of BlackBerry
Ltd. doesn’t appear to require government approval.  Harper, speaking in a CNBC interview, said the government
would only review an acquisition if it involved a foreign
company. Any attempt by a foreign company to acquire Blackberry
would also undergo a national security review, Harper said.  “If it were a foreign takeover the government would
obviously have to examine that,” Harper said in the interview.
“If it’s a foreign acquisition above a certain dollar figure,
the govt would review it, and would review it obviously on broad
grounds, but also all decisions, particularly in the technology
space, would be reviewed on national security grounds.”  Fairfax Financial Holdings Ltd., BlackBerry’s
largest investor, said on Sept. 23 that it had signed a
tentative offer to purchase the company with help from other
partners. The firm hasn’t identified the other buyers.  The government automatically reviews foreign takeovers of
Canadian businesses with assets of more than C$344 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
