The real extended its largest
weekly loss since August as the U.S. budget impasse damped
demand for emerging-market assets and undermined the Brazilian
central bank’s efforts to bolster the currency.  The real depreciated 0.4 percent to 2.2550 per dollar at
10:29 a.m. in  Sao Paulo , a one-week low on a closing basis, and
deepened its decline since Sept. 20 to 2 percent. Swap rates on
the contract due in January 2015 were unchanged at 10.15 percent
and have climbed eight basis points this week.  “If the U.S. doesn’t get a deal on the budget, the
situation for the markets will worsen,” Luis Otavio de Souza Leal, the chief economist at Banco ABC Brasil SA, said in a
telephone interview from Sao Paulo.  The real was the worst performer after the  Mexican peso 
this week among 16 major dollar counterparts tracked by
Bloomberg on concern a possible U.S. government shutdown will
reduce investment flows into  Brazil . Central bank President
Alexandre Tombini signaled this week that a $60 billion
intervention program to bolster the real and curb inflation will
stay in effect.  Wholesale, construction and consumer  prices  climbed 4.40
percent in the 12 months through September, the Getulio Vargas
Foundation reported today. The median forecast of 19 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg was for an increase of 4.35 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
