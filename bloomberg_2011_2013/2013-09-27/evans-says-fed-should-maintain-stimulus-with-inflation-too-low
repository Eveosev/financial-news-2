Chicago Federal Reserve President
 Charles Evans , who votes on policy this year, said the central
bank should press on with record stimulus with inflation too low
and unemployment too high.  “More accommodation is appropriate, and the biggest
problem we have is we’re stuck at the zero-lower bound,” Evans
said today, referring to the Fed’s near-zero  target interest
rate  that can’t be reduced further. He has been one of the Fed’s
most outspoken advocates for unprecedented accommodation.  Evans, speaking on a panel in Oslo, said concerns that
stimulus is leading to too much exuberance and financial
instability should be addressed with regulatory tools rather
than by raising interest rates.  “It strikes me as remarkably natural to use other tools if
they’re available,” rather than raising interest rates to fight
asset-price bubbles, Evans said. “Without meeting our inflation
objective, if we increased interest rates, all the theory I know
suggests inflation would be lower.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
