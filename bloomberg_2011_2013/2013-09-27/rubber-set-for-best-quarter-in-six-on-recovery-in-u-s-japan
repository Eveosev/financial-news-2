Rubber declined to the lowest level
in a month, paring a quarterly advance, as a strengthening
Japanese currency cut the appeal of the commodity used in tires.  The contract for March delivery on the  Tokyo  Commodity
Exchange lost 2.7 percent to end at 270.2 yen a kilogram ($2,741
a metric ton), the lowest settlement since Aug. 30. Futures have
gained 14 percent this quarter, the first such climb this year,
paring losses to 11 percent for the year.  The yen strengthened versus all of its 16 major
counterparts as investors sought safety amid concern that a
budget deadlock among U.S. lawmakers will send the nation to the
brink of a federal government shutdown.  “The strengthening yen hurt rubber futures,” said Naohiro
Niimura, a partner at research company Market Risk Advisory Co.
in Tokyo. The currency traded at 98.65 per dollar.  Rubber for January delivery on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange fell 1.7 percent to 20,260  yuan  ($3,310) a ton. Chinese
markets will be closed Oct. 1-7.  Thai rubber  free-on-board declined for a third day,
dropping 0.6 percent to 81.05 baht ($2.59) a kilogram today,
according to the Rubber Research Institute of  Thailand .  To contact the reporters on this story:
