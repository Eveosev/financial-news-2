Price rises in  Germany (GRCP2HYY) , the
guardian of  price stability  in the euro region, are outstripping
those in Spain by the  widest margin  since the creation of the
single currency.  Spanish consumer prices  rose 0.5 percent from a year ago in
September compared with a 1.6 percent increase in Germany, the
bloc’s largest economy, according to the EU-harmonized price
gauge. The 1.1 percentage-point difference exceeded the 1 point
spread that opened between the indexes in June 2009 during the
first wave of the global financial crisis.  Under pressure from the European Union, Prime Minister
 Mariano Rajoy  has introduced the deepest austerity measures in
Spain’s democratic history since coming to power in 2011, and
brought in measures to help lower wages in a bid to balance its
current account and narrow the  budget deficit . Slower inflation
in Spain may help correct the imbalances which strained the
currency union forcing the  European Central Bank  to intervene
with its July 2012  pledge to backstop governments.  The euro region’s fourth-largest economy has  contracted  for
eight straight quarters.  The EU measure of inflation in Spain last year jumped to
3.5 percent in September from 2.7 percent in August after Rajoy
raised the main rate of sales tax by 3 percentage points to 21
percent. Retail sales fell 4.2 percent from a year ago in
August, continuing the pattern of annual declines each month
since June 2010, INE said today in a separate release.  To contact the reporter on this story:
