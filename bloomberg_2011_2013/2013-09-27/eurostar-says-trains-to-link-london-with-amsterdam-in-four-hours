Eurostar  Group Ltd. said it will
run trains from  London  to Amsterdam via the Channel Tunnel from
December 2016 after reaching a deal with Dutch Railways.  Trains from the U.K. capital will call at Brussels and
Antwerp in Belgium and Rotterdam and Schiphol Airport in the
Netherlands before terminating at Amsterdam Central station,
Eurostar said today in an e-mailed statement.  With a journey time of about four hours and an initial two
trains per day in each direction, the service will provide an
alternative to the plane on a London-Amsterdam route that
Eurostar said is the busiest international airline market in
Europe, attracting more than 3 million passengers a year.  “Today’s announcement marks a major advance in our growth
plans,” Eurostar Chief Executive Officer Nicolas Petrovic said
in the statement. “This is one of  Europe ’s most popular
routes.” The expansion plan still requires Dutch parliamentary
approval after a deal with the infrastructure ministry, he said.  Eurostar trains currently link London with Paris and
Brussels, with additional services to the Alps and Avignon in
southern  France . Dutch services will provided by new e320 trains
ordered from Siemens AG.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
