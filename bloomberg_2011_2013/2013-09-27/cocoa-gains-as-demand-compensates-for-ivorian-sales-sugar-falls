Cocoa climbed for a second day in
 New York  as demand from chocolate makers more than compensated
for sales of beans from top producer Ivory Coast. Sugar fell.  Cocoa supplies will trail demand by more than 135,000
metric tons in the 2013-14 season starting next month, a second
year of shortages, Aakash Doshi, an analyst at Citigroup Inc. in
New York, said in a report dated yesterday. Ivory Coast offered
to sell beans for shipment in the 2014-15 season at auctions
yesterday and the day before, after futures traded in London
entered a  bull market  earlier this month. That was an “early
start” to so-called forward sales, Doshi said.  “We upgraded our forward outlook for cocoa this quarter
and expect levels on ICE to trade between $2,500 to $2,800 a ton
through the next year on the back of two consecutive seasonal
deficits,” Doshi said. Forward sales by  Ivory Coast  “could
pressure the curve, but the overall bias is for prices to remain
steady at these stronger trading bands for now.”  Cocoa for December delivery gained 0.9 percent to $2,620 a
ton by 6:46 a.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in New York, the highest
since Sept. 23. Futures gained 7.6 percent this month and 21
percent this quarter, the most in four years. Futures trading
volumes were 48 percent lower than the average for the past 100
days for this time of day, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Cocoa for delivery in the same month gained 0.3
percent to 1,703 pounds ($2,740) a ton on NYSE Liffe in  London .  Cocoa Butter  Ivory Coast offered to sell cocoa for shipment from October
to December 2014 at yesterday’s auction at a minimum price of
1,293  CFA francs  ($2.65) a kilogram (2.2 pounds), according to
data on the website of industry regulator Le Conseil du Cafe-Cacao. That would mean a premium of about 17 pounds ($27) a ton
to the March 2015 futures, according to Bloomberg calculations.
Beans for shipment in the same period were offered at a premium
of about 38 pounds a ton the previous day.  The cost of cocoa butter relative to bean prices, or the
so-called butter ratio, rose to 2.73 times the futures in London
on Sept. 20, the highest since November 2008, according to data
on KnowledgeCharts, a unit of Commodities Risk Analysis in
Bethlehem,  Pennsylvania . Cocoa butter accounts for about 20
percent of the weight of a chocolate bar.  “Cocoa butter ratios have surged to multi-year highs
alluding to potentially better demand pull ahead, with North
American consumption and pockets of  Asia  continuing to show
strong growth,” Citigroup’s Doshi said.  Arabica coffee for December delivery was little changed at
$1.156 a pound on ICE. Robusta coffee for delivery in November
was 0.8 percent lower at $1,649 a ton on NSYE Liffe. The price
touched $1,632 a ton, the lowest since Oct. 8, 2010.  Raw sugar for delivery in March fell 0.9 percent to 18.02
cents a pound in New York. White sugar for December delivery
retreated 0.9 percent to $484.10 a ton in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
