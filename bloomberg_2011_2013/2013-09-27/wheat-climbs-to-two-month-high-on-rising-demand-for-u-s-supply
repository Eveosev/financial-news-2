Soybeans rose, heading for the
first quarterly gain in a year, as surging U.S. export sales
signaled steady demand from  China , the world’s biggest buyer and
consumer. Wheat also gained, while corn fell.  Net-export  sales  of soybeans more than tripled to 2.82
million metric tons in the week through Sept. 19 from a week
earlier, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said yesterday.
 Shipments  before Aug. 31 are up 16 percent from a year earlier
to 25.697 million tons, a record for the date, as supplies
purchased by China jumped 28 percent.  “China is going to continue to buy U.S. soybeans until
South America crops are harvested and start moving into the
export channel” beginning in March, Brian Grete, the senior
market analyst for Professional Farmers of America newsletter in
 Cedar Falls ,  Iowa , said in a telephone interview. “Soybeans
have a very strong demand base.”  Soybean futures for delivery in November added 0.2 percent
to close at $13.1975 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the  Chicago  Board
of Trade. Prices gained 0.3 percent since Sept. 20, the seventh
advance in eight weeks, and are up 5.4 percent since the end of
June.  While the USDA expects this year’s harvest to be 4.4
percent larger than last year, the agency cut its forecast in
each of the past two months as  drought  conditions expanded in
parts of the Midwest. Excess rain in April and May prevented
some fieldwork, and crop-insurance claims have been filed for
1.69 million acres of unplanted land intended for soybeans,
compared with 159,579 acres last year, USDA data show.  Wheat futures for delivery in December rose 0.7 percent to
$6.83 a bushel in Chicago, capping 5.7 percent weekly rally.
Prices gained 3.8 percent since the end of June, poised to snap
three straight quarterly losses.  Corn futures for delivery in December slid 0.6 percent to
$4.54 a bushel. Prices are down 11 percent since the end of
June, heading for a fourth straight quarterly retreat, which
would be the longest slump since 2009. Domestic production will
reach a record this year, according to the USDA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
