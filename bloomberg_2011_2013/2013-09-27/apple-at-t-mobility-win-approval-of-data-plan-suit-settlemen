Apple Inc. (AAPL)  and AT&T Mobility LLC
won court approval to settle a lawsuit claiming the companies
promoted and then quickly discontinued an unlimited data plan
for customers who purchased an iPad 3G.  U.S. District Judge Ronald M. Whyte in San Jose,
California, gave his preliminary approval yesterday to the
agreement in which Apple will pay $40 cash to customers who
submit a valid claim, according to a court filing. AT&T
Mobility, a unit of Dallas-based  AT&T Inc. (T) , will give some class
members a $20-a-month discount for one year for a 5GB iPad 3G
data plan, according to the filing.  The agreement is “fair, reasonable, and adequate,” Whyte
wrote in his order. Lawyers for the companies and plaintiffs
must return to court for a Feb. 7 final approval hearing, he
said.  The lawsuit consolidated four cases filed in 2010 with
similar claims that the abrupt discontinuation of the “flexible
access” data plan after an initial wave of iPad 3G purchases
caused customers to overpay for the devices, and amounted to
misrepresentation. AT&T, the largest U.S. phone company, had
exclusive rights to the iPhone until 2011.  Kristin Huguet, a spokeswoman for Cupertino, California-based Apple, didn’t immediately return an e-mail seeking comment
on the settlement.  The case is In Re Apple and AT&T iPad Unlimited Data Plan
Litigation, 10-cv-02553, U.S. District Court, Northern District
of  California  (San Jose).  To contact the reporter on this story:
