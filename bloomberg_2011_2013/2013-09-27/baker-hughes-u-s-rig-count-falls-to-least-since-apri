Energy  rigs  in the U.S. fell to the
lowest level since April as rapid growth driven by the initial
exploration of U.S. shale basins moderated and drillers became
more efficient.  Total rigs slid by 17 to 1,744 this week,  Baker Hughes
Inc. (BHI) , a Houston-based field-services company, said on its
website.  Oil rigs  declined by seven to 1,362. Gas  rigs  dropped
by 10 to 376. The miscellaneous rig count was unchanged at six.  “The U.S. onshore market is taking a breather in 2013”
after three years of rapid growth, James West, an oilfield
services analyst for Barclays Plc in  New York , wrote in a Sept.
23 research note.  Exploitation of shale basins using hydraulic fracturing and
horizontal drilling techniques has pushed U.S. crude output to
its highest level since 1989. The resurgence in production
helped the U.S. meet 87 percent of its energy needs in the first
five months of 2013, on pace to be the highest annual rate since
1986, according to the Energy Information Administration.  The total rig count is down 5.6 percent from a year ago.
U.S. oil  output  slid to 7.77 million barrels a day last week,
the EIA, the Energy Department’s statistical arm, reported on
Sept. 25.  West said drillers are now focusing on deepwater wells in
the  Gulf of Mexico .  Gulf Rigs  Recent discoveries are “leading to an acceleration of
operator interest in the U.S. GOM not seen since the lifting of
the deepwater moratorium in late 2010,” he wrote.  Gulf rigs slid by one to 62 last week, Baker Hughes said.  Crude for November delivery slipped 22 cents to $102.81 a
barrel at 1:28 p.m. on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Prices
are down 1.8 percent this week and have advanced 12 percent in
the past year.  Natural gas for November delivery declined 0.1 cent to
$3.566 per million British thermal units. That’s down 3.3
percent in September and up 8.2 percent from a year ago.  U.S. gas stockpiles  gained 87 billion cubic feet last week
to 3.386 trillion, the EIA, the Energy Department’s statistical
arm, reported yesterday. Supplies were 5 percent below year-earlier levels and 0.9 percent above the five-year average.  To contact the reporter on this story:
