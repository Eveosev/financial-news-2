Treasuries gained for a third week
as demand for the safest assets swelled amid speculation a
political standoff over the U.S. budget may lead to a government
shutdown.  Benchmark  10-year notes  had their longest weekly winning
streak since April as the  U.S. Senate  approved a stopgap
spending bill and sent it to the House three days before funding
for the government runs out. Congress must also vote on raising
the federal debt limit, which Treasury Secretary Jack Lew has
said will be reached by Oct. 17. Inflation slowed last month,
the  Federal Reserve ’s preferred measure of prices showed today.  “The conflict is perceived to weigh heavily on the
economy,” said  David Coard , head of fixed-income trading in New
York at Williams Capital Group LP, a brokerage for institutional
investors. “It produces a flight-to-quality bid. The only thing
to lift yields out of the current dive is signs of strength in
the data.”  The  10-year yield  dropped three basis points, or 0.03
percentage point, to 2.62 percent at 5 p.m. in New York,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The yield touched
2.60 percent, the lowest level since Aug. 12, and fell 11 basis
points on the week. The price of the 2.5 percent note maturing
in August 2023 increased 7/32, or $2.19 per $1,000 face amount,
to 98 29/32.  The benchmark yield climbed to 3.01 percent on Sept. 6 amid
expectations the Fed would trim its bond-buying program and then
fell after policy makers on Sept. 18 unexpectedly maintained the
purchases. The yield increased two basis points yesterday.  Futures Bets  Hedge-fund managers and other large speculators trimmed
their  net-short position  in 10-year note futures in the week
ended Sept. 24, according to U.S. Commodity Futures Trading
Commission data.  Speculative short positions, or bets prices will fall,
outnumbered long positions by 89,107 contracts on the Chicago
Board of Trade, compared with net short positions the previous
week of 126,026, the most bearish since May 2012. Net-short
positions fell by 36,919 contracts, or 29 percent, from a week
earlier, the Washington-based commission said in its Commitments
of Traders report.  The seven-day  relative strength  index for the U.S. 10-year
note yield fell to 28. A reading lower than 30 or above 70
suggests the security may be poised for a change in direction.  The Bloomberg  U.S. Treasury Bond Index (BUSY)  dropped 2.5 percent
this year through yesterday and returned 0.8 percent this month.
The Bloomberg  Global Developed Sovereign Bond Index (BGSV)  has gained
1.4 percent this month and has slid 3.9 percent in 2013.  Volatility in Treasuries as measured by the Bank of America
Merrill Lynch MOVE index rose to 78, above the 2013 average of
71.89. It climbed Sept. 5 to 114.2, the highest in two months.  Volume Falls  Treasury trading volume at ICAP Plc, the largest inter-dealer broker of  U.S. government debt , dropped 16 percent to
$277 billion, from $329 billion yesterday. The average this year
is $316 billion.  The Senate voted 54-44 today to finance the government
through Nov. 15, putting pressure on the House to avoid a
federal shutdown set to start Oct. 1. The Senate stripped
language backed by Republicans to de-fund President  Barack
Obama ’s signature health-care law.  “Until we get a resolution from Congress, we will see the
safe-haven bid continue,” said Guy LeBas, chief fixed-income
strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott LLC in Philadelphia, which
oversees $11 billion in fixed income assets.  A three- to four-week U.S. government shutdown would cut
growth by 1.4 percentage points, Moody’s Analytics Inc.
estimated.  Bill Rates  U.S. bill rates declined amid the turmoil over the budget
and the debt ceiling. The Treasury Department said yesterday it
will sell $25 billion in three-month bills at its weekly auction
on Sept. 30, $5 billion less than the previous offering and the
first reduction in issuance since April.  “The Treasury cutting the size of the three-month auction
is a signal that the debt ceiling is starting to have an impact
on supply, inspiring demand from investors who are trying to get
out in front of the possibility of a shrinking pie,” said
Thomas Simons, a government-debt economist in  New York  at
Jefferies LLC, one of 21 primary dealers that trade with the
Fed. “We could see a further supply squeeze if the fiscal
issues don’t get resolved.”  Bill Rates  Rates on  three-month  Treasury bills touched negative 0.0101
percent today, the lowest level this year, before trading at
0.0152 percent. The 2013 average is 0.0482 percent.  Rates on bills that mature Oct. 24 reached negative 0.010
today, down from 0.035 percent yesterday, before trading at
0.020 percent. Two years ago, one-month bills jumped to 0.18
percent on July 29, 2011, the highest since February 2009, as
Congress pushed to the Aug. 2, 2011, deadline set by Treasury to
avoid a default.  Treasuries remained higher today as a report showed
inflation slowed. The personal consumption expenditure deflator,
the Fed’s preferred gauge, rose 1.2 percent in August from a
year earlier, compared with a revised 1.3 percent increase in
July, the Commerce Department reported.  “They want inflation of 2 percent before they taper,”
said  Michael Franzese , senior vice president of fixed-income
trading at ED&F Man Capital Markets in New York. “They are
worried about deflation.”  The  gap  between yields on 10-year notes and comparable
Treasury Inflation Protected Securities, a gauge of expectations
for consumer prices over the life of the debt, decreased two
basis points to 2.18 percentage points, after touching 2.27
percentage points on Sept. 23, the widest since Aug. 13.  Fed Purchases  The Fed buys $85 billion a month of Treasuries and mortgage
bonds to put pressure on borrowing costs and spur economic
growth. It purchased $5.55 billion today in  U.S. debt  maturing
between June 2018 and May 2019 as part of the program.  Chicago Fed Bank President  Charles Evans , who has been
among the central bank’s most vocal proponents of record
stimulus, said more signs of strength in the economy are needed
to reduce asset purchases. He spoke to reports in Oslo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
