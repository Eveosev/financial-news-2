Facebook Inc. (FB) , owner of the world’s
most popular social network, is testing advertisements for
external mobile applications, potentially adding another source
of revenue from wireless devices.  The effort comes after a similar experiment about a year
ago that ran on mobile gadgets that the  Menlo Park , California-based company called a “small test” at the time.  “We’re currently running a second test to show  Facebook 
ads off Facebook in mobile apps and on mobile sites,” the
company said in an e-mailed statement. “Our goal is to improve
both targeting and relevancy of the ads people see. Since this
is a test, we don’t have additional details to share.”  Facebook, which has more than 1 billion users, is looking
for new ways to beef up its mobile-advertising efforts as
consumers shift to smartphones and tablets. While the company
got more than 40 percent of its ad revenue from mobile in the
second quarter, Facebook remains a distant No. 2 in the market.  Google will capture about 53 percent of the mobile ad
market this year compared with Facebook’s 16 percent, according
to EMarketer estimates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
