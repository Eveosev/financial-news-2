Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT)  received two
more production contracts worth $7.8 billion for 71 F-35 jets,
the Pentagon said today.  The announcement for the sixth and seventh contracts is for
36 and 35 jets respectively. The sixth contract, including money
already allocated, is valued at $4.4 billion, of which $742
million was awarded today. The seventh contract is valued at
$3.4 billion.  The contracts contain provisions that, unlike the five
previous contracts, will require Bethesda, Maryland-based
Lockheed Martin to absorb all cost overruns, the Pentagon
program office said in a statement.  Lockheed Martin will get to keep 80 cents for every $1 that
costs fall below targets, the Pentagon said. Today’s contracts
mean that Lockheed Martin has 166 production aircraft under
contract; the 100th is scheduled to roll off the  production line 
Sunday. The first aircraft being sent to  Italy ,  Australia  and
 Norway  will be delivered in the seventh contract.  The aircraft unit cost for the sixth contract is about 2.5
percent lower than basic prices -- excluding engines -- in the
fifth contract, the Pentagon said. The average unit cost of jets
in the seventh contract is estimated to be about 6 percent lower
than the fifth.  The Pentagon’s projected price tag of $391.2 billion for a
fleet of 2,443 aircraft is a 68 percent increase from the
projection in 2001, as measured in current dollars. The number
of aircraft also is 409 fewer than called for in the original
program.  The rising costs and troubles in building the plane even as
it’s being developed have led to criticism in Congress. This
year, lawmakers, the Government Accountability Office and the
Pentagon test office have said the aircraft is making progress
in flight tests and in stabilizing production.  To contact the reporter on this story:
