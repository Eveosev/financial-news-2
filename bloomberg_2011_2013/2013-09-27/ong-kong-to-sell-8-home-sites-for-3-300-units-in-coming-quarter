Hong Kong’s government will sell
eight sites that will provide 3,300 new apartments between
October and December, as it seeks to raise housing supply to
help curb the world’s highest  home prices.   Five of the sites will include clauses requiring developers
to build a minimum number of units, Secretary for Development
 Paul Chan  told reporters at a briefing in the city today. Hong
Kong put up for tender nine sites for 4,900 units in the
previous quarter.  Hong Kong’s home prices have more than doubled since early
2009 on record low mortgage rates, an influx of mainland Chinese
buyers and a lack of supply. A committee set up by the
government to study its housing policy recommended this month
the supply of land for 470,000 new homes over the next decade.  The government is “cautiously optimistic” about reaching
its target to sell land for 13,600 units in the fiscal year
ending March, Chan said. The government has sold 16 sites for
8,900 units from April to September, he said.  The government should study the possibility of using some
of the land in  Hong Kong ’s country parks to build residential
units, Chan said this month. In July, he announced plans to sell
land and build public housing for 60,700 new homes in the city’s
northeast.  Hong Kong also will sell one office site in the Kowloon
East district that will add 62,000 square meters of space, Chan
said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
