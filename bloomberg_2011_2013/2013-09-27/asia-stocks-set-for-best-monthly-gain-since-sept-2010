Asian  stocks  are headed for the
biggest monthly gain since September 2010 after U.S. jobless
claims unexpectedly fell and  Japan ’s inflation accelerated to
the fastest pace since 2008.  Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.,the world’s largest
contract manufacturer of chips, rose 1.5 percent to NT$103.
 Tokyo Electric Power Co. (9501)  gained 6.6 percent as the operator of
the crippled Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear station applied for
safety checks to restart a plant in Niigata.  Mirabela Nickel
Ltd. (MBN)  slumped 59 percent after the Australian producer of the

of 5:03 p.m. in  Hong Kong  as eight of the 10 industry groups
advanced. The gauge climbed 8 percent this month through
yesterday, touching a four-month high on Sept. 23, after the
 Federal Reserve  unexpectedly maintained its stimulus program. It
has jumped 7.8 percent this quarter.  “The U.S. jobs data was a positive surprise,” Mark Lister, head of private wealth research at Craigs Investment
Partners Ltd. in Wellington, said by telephone. “I don’t think
the Fed will do anything until December as they’ll want to see
not just one good data point, but a series of steady
improvements. It’s been a very solid quarter for markets.”  The September gains pushed valuations on the Asia-Pacific
gauge to 13.7 times  estimated earnings  yesterday from 12.7 at
the end of August, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That

annualized rate, the Commerce Department said.  Exporters advanced. TSMC gained 1.5 percent to NT$103. Hon

out of deflation through monetary easing.  A panel advising the world’s largest pool of retirement
savings said the Japanese government should review its holdings
of domestic bonds that make up the bulk of its pension assets.  The interim report from the panel of economists comes as

milk producer backed by billionaire  Cheng Yu-tung , dropped 3
percent to HK$2.59 after its shares started trading on Hong
Kong’s bourse.  Mirabela Nickel sank 59 percent to 2.5 Australian cents
