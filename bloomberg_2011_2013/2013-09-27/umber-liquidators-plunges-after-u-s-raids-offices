Lumber Liquidators Holdings Inc. (LL) ,
the hardwood flooring retailer, fell the most in 19 months in
New York trading after announcing that federal officials had
executed search warrants at its offices in  Virginia .  The searches by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement
and the Fish and Wildlife Service were related to importation of
wood-flooring products, the Toano, Virginia-based company said
in a statement today.  Lumber Liquidators plunged 9.3 percent to $102.49 at
11:44 a.m. in New York after  dropping  as much as 13 percent, the
biggest intraday decline since February 2012.  WWBT-TV, a Richmond, Virginia, NBC station, said on its
website that the raid was related to the importation of
protected wood from the habitat of the Siberian tiger. The wood
originates in Russia and is processed in  China , and government
agents suspect it was declared as coming from other countries,
the station reported, without saying how it got the information.  Representatives of ICE, Fish and Wildlife and the U.S.
Attorney’s Office in Alexandria, Virginia, didn’t immediately
respond to e-mails and phone calls seeking comment on the raid.  To contact the reporter on this story:
