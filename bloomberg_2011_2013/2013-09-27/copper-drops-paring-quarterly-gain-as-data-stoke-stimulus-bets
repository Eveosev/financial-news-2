Copper declined for the first time
in three days, paring the biggest quarterly gain since March
2012, as reports showed the U.S. economy improved, boosting the
case that the Federal Reserve may reduce its stimulus.  The metal for delivery in three months on the London Metal
Exchange fell as much as 0.3 percent to $7,227 a metric ton and
traded at $7,240.25 by 11:04 a.m. in  Tokyo . Copper increased 2
percent this month and added 7.3 percent this quarter. Futures
for delivery in December sank 0.2 percent to $3.299 a pound on
the Comex in New York.  Data today may show spending and sentiment in the U.S.
improved. First-time claims for unemployment benefits in the U.S.
fell by 5,000 to 305,000 last week, a government report
yesterday showed, compared with the 325,000 median forecast in a
Bloomberg survey. A tussle between President  Barack Obama  and
congressional Republicans over the budget risks a government
shutdown within days.  “The improvement in the U.S. economy will surely trigger
concerns over tapering after the Fed unexpectedly kept its
stimulus unchanged,” said Xu Liping, an analyst at HNA Topwin
Futures Co. in  Shanghai .  The Federal Open Market Committee last week unexpectedly
refrained from dialing back its $85 billion in monthly bond
purchases, saying it was waiting for more signs of sustained
economic improvement. Most economists surveyed by Bloomberg on
Sept. 18-19, after the FOMC meeting, expect the Fed to wait
until a gathering in December to taper purchases.  Metal for delivery in December on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange was little changed at 52,340  yuan  ($8,548) a ton.
