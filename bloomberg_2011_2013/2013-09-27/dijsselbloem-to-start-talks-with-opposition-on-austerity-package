Dutch Finance Minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem will start talks with the opposition as soon as
next week to get backing for a 6 billion-euro ($8.1 billion)
austerity package for 2014.  “It’s important that we make a start next week,”
Dijsselbloem told reporters today in  The Hague  in a televised
interview. “The proposals from the opposition and from the
government are on the table and now it’s time to put our
shoulders to the wheel,” Dijsselbloem said.  Prime Minister  Mark Rutte  and the opposition didn’t come
closer to agreement on budget proposals for 2014 during two days
of debate in Parliament. Rutte’s plan for additional spending
cuts and tax increases, presented Sept. 17, comes on top of a
four-year, 16 billion-euro package his coalition with the  Labor
Party  approved late last year. Of this, 3.5 billion euros were
already penciled in to take effect in 2014.  The Netherlands is in its third recession since the global
financial crisis started in 2008 and has been in breach of the
European Union’s deficit limit of 3 percent of gross domestic
product since then. The budget shortfall will widen to 3.3
percent of GDP in 2014 from an expected 3.2 percent this year
even after the government introduced the additional austerity
package, its planning agency said Sept. 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
