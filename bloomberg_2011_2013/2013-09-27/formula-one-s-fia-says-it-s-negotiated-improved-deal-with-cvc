Formula One’s not-for-profit ruling
body Federation Internationale de l’Automobile reached an accord
with the owners of the auto-racing series through 2020 over its
compensation and role in governance.  The agreement with CVC Capital Partners Ltd. and other
shareholders gives the FIA “significantly improved financial
means,” the organization  said in a statement  today, without
giving more details. The FIA said it will now seek a multi-party
accord that also includes the teams.  The Paris-based ruling body oversees the technical
specifications of racing cars and handles medical support and
media accreditation in Formula One. It had reached an outline
agreement on how it should be compensated by the series as long
ago as December 2012.  The FIA leased the commercial rights to Formula One for a
century to a group led by  Bernie Ecclestone  for $314 million in
2000, according to then-president  Max Mosley . The FIA’s current
president is former Ferrari team manager Jean Todt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
