San Francisco quarterback Colin Kaepernick threw two touchdown passes as the 49ers defeated the
 St. Louis Rams  35-11 to begin Week 4 play in the  National
Football League .  The 49ers improved to 2-2 for second place in the National
Football Conference West. The home loss leaves the Rams third in
the division with a 1-3 mark. The  Seattle Seahawks  lead the
standings and will seek their first 4-0 start when they visit
the Houston Texans (2-1) on Sept. 29.  The lopsided win comes after both games between the Rams
and 49ers went to overtime last year, with the meeting in  St.
Louis  ending in a tie and the Rams winning in San Francisco.  Kaepernick completed 15 of 23 passes for 167 yards as the
49ers amassed 370 yards of total offense to 188 for the Rams.  Greg Zuerlein’s 40-yard field goal for the Rams was the
only score of the first quarter at Edward Jones Dome in St.
Louis last night.  Anquan Boldin collected a 20-yard pass from Kaepernick and
just managed to avoid stepping out of bounds before leaping into
the end zone for a touchdown with 6 1/2 minutes to play in the
first half.  After Donte Whitner intercepted a pass by Rams quarterback
 Sam Bradford  in San Francisco’s end zone, Kaepernick drove the
49ers to the St. Louis 34 yard line in seven plays before  Frank Gore  burst through for a touchdown on a fourth-and-inches play
to make it 14-7 for the visitors 44 seconds before halftime.  After the 49ers got the ball back with four seconds
remaining in the second quarter on a fair catch, Phil Dawson
missed with a 71-yard free-kick attempt. The last of four
successful free kicks in the NFL was by Ray Wersching of the  San
Diego Chargers  in 1976.  On San Francisco’s second drive after halftime, Kaepernick
tossed a short pass to Vernon Davis for a 12-yard touchdown to
make it 21-3.  Rams fans streamed toward the exits when  San Francisco 
recovered a fumble by Bradford at St. Louis’ 3 yard line, which
led to a one-yard touchdown run by Anthony Dixon.  Few home fans remained to witness the Rams’ sole touchdown,
on a six-yard pass from Bradford to Lance Kendricks with 5:47
remaining that also yielded a two-point conversion. Kendall Hunter’s weaving 29-yard run for a 49ers touchdown wrapped up
the scoring with 4:32 to play.  To contact the reporter on this story:
