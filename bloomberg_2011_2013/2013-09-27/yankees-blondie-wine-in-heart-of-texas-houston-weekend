The Pastry War at 310 Main St., named after a not particularly epic battle between France and  Mexico  in the 1830s, is dedicated to fine tequila and serves one of Houston’s best margaritas. Just around the corner at 813 Congress Ave., La Carafe operates in the oldest commercial structure still in use in the city.
