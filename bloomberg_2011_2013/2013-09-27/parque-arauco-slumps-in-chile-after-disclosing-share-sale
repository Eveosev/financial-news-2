Parque Arauco SA (PARAUCO) , Chile’s third-biggest shopping mall operator, fell the most on the country’s
benchmark index after announcing plans to sell new shares
equivalent to 16 percent of its  market value .  The shares retreated 4.9 percent to 995 pesos at 1:12 p.m.
in  Santiago, the most in three months on a closing basis. The
benchmark IPSA dropped 0.4 percent.  The Santiago-based mall operator, which also has  operations 
in  Peru  and Colombia, said yesterday in a regulatory filing that
it called a shareholder meeting for Oct. 23 to vote on the sale
of 115 billion pesos ($228 million) of new shares. The company
didn’t disclose its plans for the funds or if the controlling
Said family would buy shares in the offering.  “We can’t rule out downward pressure on the stock,”  Banco
de Credito e Inversiones (BCI)  said in an e-mailed research note to
customers. “The company hasn’t announced what it plans to do
with the money.”  The company said in an August  presentation  that it planned
to invest $222 million in the next 18 months to expand or build
seven malls in  Chile  and four in Peru, adding 113,200 square
meters (1.2 million square feet) of area that can be leased to
its current 635,000 square meters.  To contact the reporter on this story:
