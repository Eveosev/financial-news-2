  Sino-Ocean Land Holdings Ltd. (3377) , a
real estate developer in China, said it will raise $808 million
by selling new shares to  China Life Insurance Co. (2628)  and Nan Fung
Group to finance new property projects.  China Life will subscribe for 635.9 million shares and Nan
Fung for 686.6 million shares, both at HK$4.74 each, Beijing-based Sino-Ocean said in a statement to the Hong Kong Stock
Exchange yesterday. The price is at a 1.7 percent premium to the
Hong Kong closing price of HK$4.66 yesterday.  The sale boosts China Life’s stake in the company to 29
percent from 24.7 percent, according to the filing. Under Hong
Kong rules, the Beiing-based insurer must make a buyout offer
once its holding reaches 30 percent. Nan Fung’s stake rises to
21 percent from 14 percent.  China  Life and Nan Fung won’t make a
takeover offer, Sino-Ocean said in the statement.  As part of the transaction, Sino-Ocean Land said it will
pay Nan Fung $314 million for a 20 percent stake in a commercial
property project in Beijing’s Chaoyang district and a 10 percent
stake in a residential and retail complex in Dalian, giving
Sino-Ocean full control of both projects.  JPMorgan acted as financial adviser to Sino-Ocean.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
