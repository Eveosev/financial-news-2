Thailand ’s baht headed for its
first weekly loss in three on concern the nation’s recession
will deter foreign inflows. Bonds advanced for a third week.  The currency weakened today as Barclays Plc cut the
country’s 2013 economic growth forecast to 2.5 percent from 3.5
percent. The lender cited a domestic credit crunch, waning
stimulus and lack of confidence after Southeast Asia’s second-largest economy shrank in the first two quarters, while exports
fell for three months through July. The Bank of Thailand is
concerned about sluggish private demand and labor shortages,
Governor Prasarn Trairatvorakul said in Bangkok today.  The baht dropped 0.4 percent this week to 31.25 per dollar
as of 9:37 a.m. in Bangkok, according data compiled by Bloomberg.
The currency fell 0.2 percent today and has retreated 1.2
percent from a two-month high of 30.88 on Sept. 20 that followed
the Federal Reserve decision to not reduce its record stimulus.  “The economy is likely to remain on the downtrend in the
second half due to the slowdown in exports,” said Thammarat
Kittisiripat, an economist in Bangkok at TMB Bank Pcl. “The
baht will depreciate and fund outflows in the short term will
continue.”  One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected swings
in the exchange rate used to price options, decreased 37 basis
points from a week ago to 7.46 percent. The gauge dropped 19
basis points, or 0.19 percentage point, today.  Stock Outflows  The baht is likely to underperform its Southeast Asian
peers, such as  Malaysia ’s ringgit and the Philippine peso, given
modest economic growth and weakening external balances, Barclays
said in the report. It will fall to 31.5 per dollar by March 31
and 31.75 by June 30, the U.K. lender forecasts.  Overseas funds sold $211 million more local stocks than
they bought this week, according to exchange data, taking net
sales this year to $3.3 billion. The benchmark SET Index has
declined 3.5 percent since Sept. 20.  The yield on the 3.625 percent bonds due June 2023 fell 11
basis points this week to 3.91 percent, data compiled by
Bloomberg show, following a 37 basis points decrease last week
that was the  biggest  drop since August 2011. The rate increased
five basis points today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
