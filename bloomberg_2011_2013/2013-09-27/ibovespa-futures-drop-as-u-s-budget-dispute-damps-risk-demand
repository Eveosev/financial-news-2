Ibovespa  futures  fell, after the
 stock index  sank yesterday to a two-week low, on concern that a
political deadlock over the U.S. budget will curb global demand
for riskier assets including Brazilian equities.  Banco Santander Brasil SA (SANB11)  may move after saying it will pay
out 6 billion reais ($2.7 billion) to shareholders under a
capital restructuring.  Lupatech SA (LUPA3) , a provider of oil equipment
and services, may be active after  Vallourec SA (VK)  said it agreed to
buy one of its units for 21 million euros ($28.4 million).  Ibovespa futures contracts expiring in October declined 0.6
percent to 53,170 at 9:12 a.m. in Sao Paulo. The real weakened
0.6 percent to 2.2595 per dollar.  “Until there’s a solution to the budget issue in the U.S.,
investors will remain cautious, keeping Brazilian stocks from
rising,” Fausto Gouveia, who helps manage 500 million reais at
Legan Administracao de Recursos, said in a telephone interview
from  Sao Paulo .  A shutdown of the U.S. government would reduce  fourth-quarter economic growth by as much as 1.4 percentage points
depending on its length, according to economists.  The Ibovespa entered a bull market Sept. 9 after rising 20
percent from this year’s low on July 3 through that day. The
gauge is still down 19 percent in dollar terms this year,
compared with a decline of 5.3 percent for the MSCI Emerging
Markets Index of 21 developing nations’ equities.  Trading volume of stocks in Sao Paulo yesterday was 5.09
billion reais, compared with a daily average of 7.71 billion
reais this year through Sept. 24, according to data compiled by
the exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
