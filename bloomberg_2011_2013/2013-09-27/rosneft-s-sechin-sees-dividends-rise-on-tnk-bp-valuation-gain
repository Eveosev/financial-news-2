OAO Rosneft,  Russia ’s biggest oil
producer, is set to boost dividends on 2013 profit after
recognizing a higher value for the TNK-BP venture than the $55
billion it paid.  Deloitte estimated a fair value for TNK-BP, the venture set
up by  BP Plc (BP/)  and a group of billionaires a decade ago, that is
167 billion rubles ($5.2 billion) higher than the acquisition
price, Chief Executive Officer Igor Sechin said today during a
panel led by Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev at an investor
conference in Sochi, Russia.  “This difference will initially be shown in the company’s
nine-month results,” Sechin said. “We expect a respective
increase in dividends for our shareholders in accordance with
dividend policy.”  President Vladimir Putin’s government, trying to lure
investors to counter capital outflows and the cheapest equities
among  emerging markets , is considering increasing the dividend
payout for state companies to 35 percent of net income. In
November, the government ordered state companies to pay no less
than 25 percent.  Rosneft can “easily pay more” if told to do so, Sechin
said Sept. 14. In June, Rosneft approved a payment of 85.3
billion rubles, or about 25 percent of 2012 profit under
International Financial Reporting Standards.  The TNK-BP deal closed in March, Russia’s biggest
acquisition.  To contact the reporters on this story:
