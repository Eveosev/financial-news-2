Chiang Shang-yi, an executive vice
president at  Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (2330)  and one of
three candidates shortlisted to succeed Chief Executive Officer
 Morris Chang , will retire on Oct. 31, the company said.  Chang, 82, will run the research and development division,
currently led by the 67-year-old Chiang, the world’s biggest
contract manufacturer of chips said in a statement to Taiwan’s
stock exchange today. Chang said in July he would give up the
CEO’s role next year and remain as chairman.  TSMC, which in August posted record-high revenue of NT$55.1
billion ($1.86 billion), in 2012 promoted Chiang, Liu De-Yin and
Wei Che-Chia as co-chief operating officers. The three
executives would be groomed for the CEO’s position by taking
turns heading the research and development, business
development, and the operations divisions in six-month stints,
the Hsinchu, Taiwan based company said at the time.  “The two other co-chief operating officers are still
candidates for succession,” Elizabeth Sun, a company
spokeswoman, said by phone, adding that only Chang could answer
succession questions.  Chang said last year he may appoint more than one CEO and
declined to elaborate on succession plans in July.  Net income in the three months ended in June rose 24
percent from a year earlier to NT$51.8 billion beating analyst
estimates.  Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM) ,  Texas Instruments Inc. (TXN) , and  MediaTek
Inc. (2454)  are among the company’s customers, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
