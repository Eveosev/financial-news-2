Co-Operative Group Ltd., the parent
of Co-Operative Bank Plc, said its advisers opened talks with
the lender’s bondholders as it seeks their agreement to exchange
some of their debt for equity.  “The Co-Operative Group confirms that our advisers have
met with Mark Taber, as they have with a number of other
investors and their representatives,” according to a statement
e-mailed by Tulchan Communications LLP, an external public
relations company in  London . “These meetings have been
constructive and useful.” UBS AG is advising on the debt
exchange.  Taber is leading a group of individual investors that own
Co-Op Bank’s permanent interest bearing shares, a form of junior
debt that will absorb losses in the proposed debt-for-equity
exchange. Co-Op Bank said in June it plans to raise 1.5 billion
pounds ($2.4 billion) to plug a capital shortfall partly by
asking existing bondholders to exchange subordinated debt for
new equity.  Manchester-based Co-Op Bank said Sept. 20 it set up an
independent committee to consider third-party proposals after a
separate group of bondholders introduced an alternative
restructuring plan that would leave them in control of the
banking unit. The investor group, which owns 43 percent of Co-Op
Bank’s lower Tier 2 bonds, is being advised by Moelis & Company
UK LLP.  To contact the reporter on this story:
