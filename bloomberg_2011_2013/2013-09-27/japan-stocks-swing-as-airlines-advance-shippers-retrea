Japanese  stocks  swung between gains
and losses as apparel makers and airlines advanced while
shippers and energy explorers retreated.  The Topix rose 0.1 percent to 1,221.15 as of 9:06 a.m. in
Tokyo. The Nikkei 225 Stock Average slipped 0.1 percent to
14,790.28. A pension-fund panel yesterday advised the government
to review its domestic bond portfolio. A report today showed
 Japan ’s consumer prices excluding fresh food accelerated at the
fastest pace since 2008 in August.  “Market conditions have changed a lot and investors are
expecting the government pension fund to increase the allocation
of stocks,” said Koichi Kurose, chief economist in Tokyo at
Resona Bank Ltd. “But whether new money will flow into Japanese
stocks depends on how much they will raise the weighting.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
