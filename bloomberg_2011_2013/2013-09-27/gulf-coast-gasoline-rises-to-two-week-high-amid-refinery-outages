U.S.  Gulf Coast  gasoline
strengthened to the highest level in two weeks as regional
refinery outages reduced output.  Conventional, 85-octane gasoline  blendstock, or CBOB, on
the Gulf Coast gained 1.88 cents to 13.25 cents a gallon below
futures on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 11:56 a.m., the
narrowest discount since Sept. 13.  Conventional, 87-octane fuel 
added 1.5 cents to a discount of 12.5 cents, also a two-week
high.  Differentials strengthened as Motiva Enterprises LLC and
 Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDS/A)  continued the restart process at the  Port
Arthur  and Deer Park refineries.  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) â€™s Baton Rouge
site had a unit shut for maintenance, while Citgo Petroleum
Corp. prepared to restart units after a turnaround at the  Corpus
Christi plant  in  Texas .  The four plants have a combined capacity of 1.61 million
barrels a day, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The  3-2-1 crack spread  on the Gulf Coast, a rough measure
of refining margins for gasoline and diesel based on West Texas
Intermediate in Cushing,  Oklahoma , slipped 17 cents to $9.31 a
barrel. The same spread based on  Light Louisiana Sweet oil 
dropped the same amount to $6.91 a barrel, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
