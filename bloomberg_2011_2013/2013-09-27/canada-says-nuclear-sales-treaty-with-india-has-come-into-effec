Cameco Corp. (CCO)  and other Canadian
uranium producers will be able to export to  India  for the first
time under an agreement that goes into effect today.  Canadian Natural Resources Minister Joe Oliver said today
the nuclear-cooperation agreement between the two countries
signed in 2010 has come into effect. The pact allows Canadian
companies to sell uranium and other nuclear supplies to the
worldâ€™s 10th-largest economy for civilian use.  The Canadian government said in April nuclear-safety
authorities in the two nations had reached an agreement that
governs how the exports will be monitored.  To contact the reporter on this story:
