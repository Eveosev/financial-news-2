Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (TEVA) ,
the world’s largest maker of generic drugs, rallied in Tel Aviv
and narrowed the widest discount to its New York-traded shares
in five months as  Citigroup Inc. (C)  recommended buying the stock.  Shares of the Petach Tikva, Israel-based company climbed
3.1 percent to 146.30 shekels, or $41.45, at the close in Tel
Aviv. The American depositary receipts closed at $41.70 on Oct.
25 in New York. The Bloomberg Israel-US Equity Index of the
most-traded Israeli companies in the U.S. gained 1.1 percent to
102.15 for the week, led by  ClickSoftware Technologies Ltd. (CKSW)   Teva has tumbled 35 percent from its March 2010 peak in New
York as a patent protecting best-selling medicine Copaxone nears
expiration. The decline sent its valuation to about 8 times
estimated earnings, or less than half of the multiple of global
peers, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. To grapple with
an expected drop in sales of its $4 billion injection, the
company announced plans this month to cut 5,000 jobs to save $2
billion in annual costs by 2017.  “The shares are undervalued,” Timothy Chiang, an analyst
at CRT Capital Group LLC, said by phone from  Stamford ,
 Connecticut  on Oct. 25. The cost-cutting strategy “has signaled
a greater sense of urgency that they are trying to align their
cost structure with the potential for Copaxone” losing its
patent protection next year, he said.  Generic drugmakers including  Momenta Pharmaceuticals Inc. (MNTA) 
are seeking to introduce copies of Copaxone as early as next
year after a U.S. court in July invalidated a 2015 patent for
the injection. Weston, Massachusetts-based  Biogen Idec Inc. (BIIB)  won
FDA approval in March for Tecfidera, which analysts project may
draw more than $3.5 billion in annual revenue by 2017.  Teva’s Sales  Sales at Teva rose 0.2 percent to $4.98 billion in the
third quarter, the first increase in a year, according to the
average estimate of 10 analysts tracked by Bloomberg. The
company is scheduled to report earnings Oct. 31.  “Teva’s risk-reward profile is the most attractive of the
multinational generic companies, and not reflected in the
current valuation,” Liav Abraham, an analyst at Citigroup,
wrote in an Oct. 25 report. “We see the potential for value to
be unlocked over the next 12 months as investors look past the
Copaxone cliff. We also see the potential for material upside
from potential shareholder-friendly actions on the part of
management.”  Perrigo Co. (PRGO) , an Allegan, Michigan-based drugmaker, shares
advanced today in  Tel Aviv , gaining 1.7 percent to 463 shekels,
or $131.19. The New York shares dropped 1.5 percent last week to
$130.61, the most since Aug. 16.  AudioCodes Ltd. (AUDC) , the Lod, Israel-based company whose
Internet calling technology is used by Microsoft Corp., gained
5.4 percent to 25.52 shekels, or $7.23, in Tel Aviv. The New
York shares added 4.3 percent to $7.25 on Oct. 24, trading at a
39 cent premium to Tel Aviv, the widest since Sept. 27.  Compugen dropped 2.8 percent to 36.68 shekels, or $10.39,
in Tel Aviv. The New York shares of the Israeli biotechnology
company, fell 6.9 percent last week to $10.32 to trade at a 37
cent discount to Tel Aviv, the biggest among shares traded on
both exchanges.  To contact the reporter on this story:
