Dubai’s benchmark stock index rose
to its highest in almost five years after  Emaar Properties PJSC (EMAAR) ,
the emirate’s biggest publicly traded real-estate developer,
reported third-quarter profit that beat analysts’ estimates.  The  DFM General Index (DFMGI)  gained 0.5 percent to 2,923.98 at its
2 p.m. close, the highest since November 2008 and bringing its
advance this year to 80 percent, the most among the 50 biggest
equity markets globally. Emaar, whose 20 percent
weighting is the heaviest in the gauge, climbed to the highest
in two months.  Arabtec Holding PJSC (ARTC) , the largest listed
construction company, jumped to a more than a five-month high.
 Saudi Basic Industries Corp. (SABIC) , the  Middle East ’s biggest
petrochemicals maker, dropped the most in more than six months
after reporting third-quarter profit that missed estimates.  Emaar, the developer of the world’s tallest tower in Dubai,
reported a 50 percent increase in third-quarter profit as
evidence mounted that the desert sheikhdom’s property crisis is
waning. Real estate in the emirate is benefiting from a revival
of Dubai’s economy, which is set to expand 4.6 percent per year,
on average, between 2012 and 2015, more than twice the growth of
the previous four years, according to government forecasts.  “Emaar’s results will be a catalyst for the market,”
Sebastien Henin, an Abu Dhabi-based money manager at The
National Investor, said by phone. “The revival of the Dubai
real-estate market wasn’t expected at such a level and Emaar is
extremely well-positioned as one of the key brands.”  Values Climb  The emirate’s biggest listed developer was at the center of
Dubai’s real-estate drive over the past decade. Now Emaar is
seeing higher profit as a surge in  home prices  follows a rebound
in trade and tourism. Dubai home values climbed at the fastest
pace in the world in the second quarter.  Emaar gained 1.8 percent to 6.21 dirhams, its highest close
since Aug. 26. Net income rose to 581 million dirhams ($158
million), compared with the 389 million-dirham average profit
estimate of six analysts compiled on Bloomberg. Arabtec advanced
0.7 percent to 2.73 dirhams, its highest since May 2012. Sabic
fell 2.4 percent, the most since April 14, to 102.25 riyals.  The DFM General Index trades at a  price-to-book value  of
1.2 compared with 1.5 for the MSCI  Emerging Markets  Index, which
has declined 2.7 percent this year, data on the Bloomberg shows.  Elsewhere in the region, Saudi Arabia’s Tadawul All Share
Index fell 0.6 percent. Kuwait’s gauge increased 0.4 percent,
Qatar’s measure advanced 0.2 percent and  Abu Dhabi ’s ADX General
Index rose 0.2 percent. Bahrain’s All Share Index lost 0.4
percent and Muscat’s measure retreated 0.3 percent. In Israel,
the benchmark  TA-25 Index (TA-25)  rose 0.5 percent at the close in  Tel
Aviv .  Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., the world’s largest
maker of generic drugs, jumped 3.1 percent to 146.30 shekels in
Tel Aviv after Citigroup Inc. recommended buying the shares.
Bezeq Israeli Telecommunication Corp. advanced 1.6 percent to
6.25 shekels after dropping 8.2 percent last week.  The yield on Israel’s benchmark 4.25 percent notes due
March 2023 slipped one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to
3.55 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
