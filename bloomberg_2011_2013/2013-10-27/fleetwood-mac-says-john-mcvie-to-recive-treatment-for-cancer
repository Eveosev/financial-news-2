Fleetwood Mac has canceled the
 Australia  and New Zealand leg of its world tour after announcing
John McVie has cancer.  Guitarist McVie, 67, one of the band’s co-founders, will
receive treatment “during that period of time,” the band said
in a statement on its official website.  “We are sorry to not be able to play these Australian and
New Zealand dates,” the statement said. “We hope our
Australian and New Zealand fans as well as Fleetwood Mac fans
everywhere will join us in wishing John and his family all the
best.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
