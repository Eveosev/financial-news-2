China Construction Bank Corp. (939) ’s loan and fee income growth helped boost third-quarter profit at the nation’s second-largest lender by 9.4 percent, matching analysts’ estimates.  Net income  rose to 56.8 billion  yuan  ($9.3 billion), the Beijing-based lender said in a Shanghai stock exchange filing yesterday. Total third-quarter profit at the nine Chinese banks traded in Hong Kong may grow by 11 percent, Deutsche Bank AG estimated before the statement.  Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd. (601398) , the world’s second-largest by market value, and the rest of the country’s five biggest lenders report on Oct. 30.  Construction Bank pledged in August to lend more to small and micro-sized businesses, which offer fatter lending margins, while growth in the world’s second-largest economy accelerated for the first time in three quarters during the July-September period. Deposits shrank during the quarter as competition intensified, pushing up funding costs.  “Loan growth kept momentum but deposit acquisition suffered,”  Sanjay Jain , a Hong Kong-based analyst at Credit Suisse Group AG, wrote in a research report today. “The key surprise was deposit growth of -0.3% considering CCB’s better-positioned franchise. It was mainly driven by shrinkage in low-cost  demand deposits .”  Soured Loans  The bank set aside 9.29 billion yuan of new provisions against  soured debt  in the third quarter, compared with 8.26 billion yuan a year earlier, according to the statement.  Nonperforming loans  rose to 82.1 billion yuan as of Sept. 30 from 80.3 billion yuan three months earlier.  “We view CCB’s provisioning levels as appropriate” because reserves increased by 3 percentage points to 268 percent of soured debt, while slipping 1 basis point to 2.62 percent of total loans,  Mike Werner , an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. in Hong Kong, wrote in a note.  Construction Bank  shares  rose 0.9 percent to HK$5.76 at 9:33 a.m. in Hong Kong, trimming their loss this year to 7.4 percent. The city’s benchmark  Hang Seng Index  has gained 0.5 percent in 2013.  Largest Lenders  Construction Bank is the first Hong Kong-listed Chinese bank to report third-quarter earnings. Along with  ICBC (1398) , lenders scheduled to report on Oct. 30 include  Agricultural Bank of China Ltd. (601288) , Bank of  China  Ltd. and Bank of Communications Co.  The average  estimate  of 10 analysts compiled by Bloomberg had called for Construction Bank to post net income of 57.2 billion yuan. Earnings per share rose to 0.23 yuan from 0.21 yuan a year earlier, according to the statement.  Construction Bank extended 864.9 billion yuan of  new loans  in the first nine months of this year, taking the outstanding amount to 8.38 trillion yuan.  Net interest income rose 8.2 percent to 98.9 billion yuan in the third quarter, while fee income, from businesses such as credit cards, trade finance and custodian services, rose 19 percent to 24.6 billion yuan.  China’s economic growth rebounded to 7.8 percent in the July-September period, accelerating for the first time in three quarters, as Premier  Li Keqiang  spurred factory output and investment to meet the government’s expansion goal for 2013. The economy may expand by 7.6 percent this year, the slowest pace since 1999, according to a Bloomberg survey of economists.  Local Governments  China’s policy makers announced the country’s second national audit of local government financing vehicles’ debt on July 28 amid concern that some may struggle to repay borrowings. Provincial and municipal authorities may have more than 20 trillion yuan of debt, former Finance Minister Xiang Huaicheng said in April, almost double the figure given by the National Audit Office in 2011.  China’s big four banks are “well-provisioned” and LGFV loans are limited to 6.1 percent of their loan books through repayments and restructuring, Tracy Yu, an analyst at Deutsche Bank, wrote in an Oct. 21 report.  Construction Bank’s  net interest margin  in the first nine months, a measure of lending profitability, narrowed to 2.71 percent, down 3 basis points from a year earlier.
