Ethiopian Girma Bedada won the men’s
race in today’s 38th annual Marine Corps Marathon and Kelly
Calway won the women’s competition before shipping out with the
U.S. Army to the  Middle East .  Bedada, 33, finished the 26.2-mile (42.2-kilometer) race
through downtown  Washington  in two hours, 21 minutes, 31.27
seconds. About 30,000 runners started the marathon, the
world’s largest race without prize money.  Calway, 29, who is stationed at Fort Carson,  Colorado , as a
captain in the U.S. Army, told reporters she will deploy next
week to  Kuwait . She finished in 2:42:14.11  “It’s awesome to win this race, representing the United
States Army,” she said. “It’s the last thing I’m doing before
shipping out, so it means the world to win this race.”  The race had been threatened with cancellation by the 16-day U.S. government shutdown, and runners were only informed 10
days ago that the race would go ahead as scheduled.  The marathon, the fourth-largest U.S. race and ninth in the
world, is used by many runners to qualify for the Boston
Marathon, the only mass participation race that requires a
qualifying time. Last year, 889 runners out of 23,519 finishers
in the Marine Corps Marathon qualified for the Boston race.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
