The Cincinnati Bengals handed the
New York Jets their worst National Football League loss since
2010, winning 49-9 as  Andy Dalton  threw four of his career-high
five touchdown passes to Marvin Jones.  The Kansas City Chiefs remain the only undefeated team in
the NFL, improving to 8-0 with yesterday’s 23-17 home win
against the  Cleveland Browns . The  Detroit Lions  overcame four
turnovers to rally for a 31-30 victory against the visiting
Dallas Cowboys as  Calvin Johnson  had 329 yards receiving, the
second-highest total in league history.  “We didn’t play our best football, but we did what we
needed,” said Lions quarterback  Matthew Stafford , who scored
the winning touchdown on a one-yard run with 12 seconds left.
“Sometimes, that’s good enough to get you a win.”  The Denver Broncos overcame a 21-7 third-quarter deficit to
beat the Washington Redskins 45-21 and improve to 7-1.  Peyton Manning  passed for 354 yards and four touchdowns, three of which
came during the fourth quarter.  The New York Giants (2-6) won their second straight game
after an 0-6 start, getting a career-high five field goals from
Josh Brown in a 15-7 victory at the Philadelphia Eagles.  The San Francisco 49ers (6-2) defeated the winless
Jacksonville Jaguars 42-10 in the NFL’s second game this season
at London’s Wembley Stadium, as quarterback Colin Kaepernick ran
for two touchdowns and threw for another score.  The New England Patriots rallied from a 14-point halftime
deficit to defeat the Miami Dolphins 27-17, and  Drew Brees  threw
five touchdown passes as the New Orleans Saints (6-1) cruised to
a 35-17 win against the Buffalo Bills (3-5).  Packers’ Win  The Green Bay Packers (5-2) gave up a 109-yard return for a
touchdown on the opening kickoff and then cruised to a 44-31
victory over the Minnesota Vikings (1-6).  The Arizona Cardinals beat the  Atlanta Falcons  27-13,
intercepting  Matt Ryan  four times, and the Oakland Raiders
topped the Pittsburgh Steelers 21-18 as Terrelle Pryor scored on
a 93-yard run on the first offensive play of the game. It was
the longest touchdown run by a quarterback in NFL history.  In Cincinnati, the Bengals (6-2) raced to a 28-6 halftime
lead as Dalton threw for four first-half scores, including three
to Jones. The duo hooked up for a fourth touchdown in the third
quarter as Dalton became the first quarterback to throw for five
scores against the Jets since  Dan Marino  in 1988.  Rookie quarterback Geno Smith was intercepted twice for the
Jets (4-4), with both being returned for touchdowns.  “That was ugly, to say the least,” Jets coach  Rex Ryan 
said at a news conference. “When you get your butt kicked like
that we’re fortunate that it only counts as one loss.”  Chiefs’ Streak  In Kansas City,  Alex Smith  threw two second-quarter
touchdown passes to help the Chiefs open a 20-7 lead and hold
off the Browns (3-5).  The Chiefs are the first team in NFL history to start a
season 8-0 under a new quarterback in Smith and a new coach in
 Andy Reid . Kansas City is also the fourth team since 1970 to
hold its first eight opponents to 17 points or fewer, and the
first since the 1977 Atlanta Falcons.  In Detroit, the Lions (5-3) overcame two interceptions and
two fumbles to stun the Cowboys in a game that featured 41
fourth-quarter points.  Stafford finished with 488 yards passing and one touchdown,
while Johnson’s 329 yards receiving came on 14 catches.
Johnson’s receiving total was second only to Flipper Anderson’s
336-yard effort for the Los Angeles Rams against New Orleans in
a Nov. 26, 1989, game that went to overtime.  Lions Rally  While  Tony Romo  threw two fourth-quarter touchdown passes
to put Dallas (4-4) up 27-17,  Reggie Bush  scored on a 1-yard run
with 3:33 left to pull the Lions within 27-24. After Dan Bailey’s 44-yard field goal with just over one minute left
boosted the Cowboys’ lead to 30-24, Stafford drove the Lions 80
yards in 50 seconds for the winning score.  “This team has a lot of resilience, we believe in each
other and feel like we’re never out of a game,” Stafford said
in a news conference.  In Foxborough, Massachusetts, the Patriots (6-2) scored 17
unanswered third-quarter points to overcome a 17-3 halftime
deficit and avoid their first home loss of the season. The
Dolphins (3-4) lost their fourth in a row.  The Eagles (3-5), who turned to rookie Matt Barkley at
quarterback after  Michael Vick  aggravated a hamstring injury
during the second quarter, were held to 201 offensive yards in
losing their franchise-record 10th straight home game.  Eli Manning passed for 246 yards yesterday to move past
Phil Simms for the most yards passing in Giants history and
running back  Peyton Hillis  rushed for 70 yards on 20 carries as
New York halted an eight-game losing skid in Philadelphia.  The Eagles scored on Najee Goode’s fumble return after the
Giants botched a snap on a punt attempt with about four minutes
left. Philadelphia was held without an offensive touchdown in
consecutive home games for the first time since 1971, during the
second and third games played at Veterans Stadium.  Week 8 concludes tonight, when the St. Louis Rams host the
 Seattle Seahawks . Four days ago, the Carolina Panthers routed
the Tampa Bay Buccaneers 31-13 in the opening game.  To contact the reporter on this story:
