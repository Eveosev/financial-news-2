Serena Williams  won the WTA
Championships to complete her most successful tennis season as
 Roger Federer ’s quest for a record-tying 12th straight berth at
the ATP World Tour Finals was prolonged by defeat in his
hometown tournament.  Top-ranked Williams fought back to beat  Li Na  of China 2-6
6-3, 6-0 in Istanbul yesterday and claim her 11th title of 2013,
surpassing her previous best of eight in 2002. The 32-year-old
American is the first player since Switzerland’s  Martina Hingis 
in 1997 to win 11 or more tournaments in a single season.  The victory also lifted Williams’s prize money for the year
to $12.3 million, smashing  Victoria Azarenka ’s previous single-season record of $7.9 million in 2012. Her career prize money
now stands at $53.8 million, a record for a female athlete.  “I don’t know how I got through that one,” Williams said
after beating Li to win her fourth WTA Championships. “I’ve
just had a really long year, and I’m just really excited. I
really didn’t expect to get through this match. It’s really
awesome. It’s such a special moment.”  Williams, who made $12 million in endorsements from June
2012 to June 2013 according to Forbes magazine’s annual
rankings, is the first player to successfully defend the title
since Justine Henin in 2007. The world No. 1 produced 30
winners, including six aces. Li, who will move up to No. 3 in
the WTA rankings, had 27 winners and one ace.  Williams finishes the year with a 78-4 record. Her 2013
victories include the French and U.S. Opens, which took her
tally of Grand Slam singles championships to 17, sixth on the
all-time list. Two major titles next year would take her above
 Chris Evert  and  Martina Navratilova .  Margaret Court  holds the
record with 24 Grand Slam singles championships.  Federer Falls  Federer, who’s won a men’s record 17 major singles titles,
lost to Juan Martin Del Potro in the final of the Swiss Indoors
tournament for the second straight year. Del Potro of Argentina
won 7-6 (7-3), 2-6, 6-4.  A sixth tournament victory in Basel would have sealed
Federer’s place at the season-ending event for the top eight
men’s players, held in London Nov. 4 to 11.  Federer, 32, must beat Kevin Anderson or Mikhail Youzhny in
his  second-round match  at this week’s Paris Masters to tie  Ivan Lendl  for the most consecutive appearances at the season finale.
Del Potro has already qualified for the Tour Finals.  “I don’t take that much confidence from losing matches,”
Federer said in comments on the ATP’s website. “I’m happy about
the level of play, that it’s getting better, but it’s not in
losses where I find my confidence, it’s in wins.”  Youzhny upset top-seeded  David Ferrer  of Spain 6-3, 7-5 to
win the Valencia Open yesterday. It was the 31-year-old
Russian’s second ATP title of the season and the 10th of his
career.  To contact the reporter on this story:
