Gonzalo Fernandez-Castano overcame
final-hole nerves to win golf’s  Shanghai Open  today.  The Spaniard twice found a bunker on the 471-yard 18th hole
before two-putting his way to a double-bogey. That gave him a
one-shot victory over  Thailand ’s Thongchai Jaidee and  Italy ’s
Francesco Molinari, who tied for second.  “I just didn’t want to mess up, but I almost did,”
Fernandez-Castano said after his victory, his eighth European
Tour title.  The 33-year-old shot a four-under 68 to finish 11-under par
at the Lake Malaren course. Thongchai scored 66 in the final
round while Molinari carded an eight-under 64.  Fernandez-Castano’s win earned him a check for 850,000
euros ($1.2 million).  To contact the reporter on this story:
