Aquarius Platinum Ltd. (AQP)  and  Impala
Platinum Holdings Ltd. (IMP)  are assessing whether to dig a second
shaft to expand production at their Mimosa platinum mine in
Zimbabwe, Winston Chitando, chairman of the operation, said.  “We are in the process of undertaking a feasibility
study,” Chitando said in an Oct. 26 interview at the mine, near
Zvishavane, 299 kilometers (186 miles) southwest of Harare, the
capital. “There is work taking place in assessing various
options,” he said, declining to give further details.  Mimosa is one of three operating platinum mines in
Zimbabwe, which has the second-biggest reserves of the metal
after South Africa. Zimbabwe Platinum Mines Ltd., a unit of
Johannesburg-based Impala, and  Anglo American Platinum Ltd. (AMS)  also
run mines in the country. Mimosa produced about 218,000 ounces
of platinum group metals in its last financial year.  By law, mining companies operating in  Zimbabwe  must sell or
cede 51 percent of their local assets to black citizens of the
country or the government.  “There are discussions which are taking place with
government,” Chitando said. “So far we are happy with them.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
