Syria ’s government met a deadline
for submitting a declaration covering its chemical weapons
program, the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical
Weapons said.  The declarations provide the basis for destroying chemical
weapons and production facilities, OPCW said in an e-mailed
 statement  today.  The OPCW, based in  The Hague , is working in Syria to ensure
the destruction of chemical weapons and make all production
sites and equipment unusable by Nov. 1. The organization went to
Syria after the UN Security Council resolved last month to rid
the country of chemical weapons after a gas attack near Damascus
that the U.S. said killed more than 1,400 people.  Russia and the U.S. agreed on a deal that required Syria to
account for and destroy its chemical weapons following the
poison-gas attack on Aug. 21. The U.S. stopped threatening
military action in response to the attack after the UN Security
Council approved on Sept. 27 that all of Syria’s chemical
weapons be eliminated.  Syria also submitted a declaration covering activities and
facilities that are not prohibited under the Chemical Weapons
Convention, OPCW said today. These can be subjected to routine
verification measures as a confidence building measure and to
establish the peaceful intent of commercial activities, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
