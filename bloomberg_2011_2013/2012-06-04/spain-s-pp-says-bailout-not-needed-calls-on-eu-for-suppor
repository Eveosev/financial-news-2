Spain  doesn’t need an international
bailout, the deputy leader of the ruling People’s Party said,
and she called on European institutions to support the nation in
return for following their recommendations.  “Given that Spain, the Spanish authorities and Spanish
people are complying with their responsibility, the European
institutions should respond to the countries that are doing what
those same European institutions say must be done,” Maria Dolores de Cospedal told reporters in Madrid today.  Spain’s five month-old government is struggling to calm
speculation it will need to seek a bailout as German Chancellor
Angela Merkel’s spokesman said today it’s up to the Spanish
government to decide whether it needs help.  Bankinter SA (BKT)  Chief
Executive Maria Dolores Dancausa broke with the government’s
position on June 1, saying there may be no alternative to a
European rescue.  “Spain is capable of getting out of this on its own,”
Cospedal, Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy ’s deputy in the party,
said today.  Rajoy has repeatedly called on European institutions to
support Spain, and urged the  European Central Bank  specifically
on May 24 to help make public debt “sustainable.” The ECB
started buying Spanish debt in August to bring down yields and
data show Spanish lenders were among the biggest beneficiaries
of the central bank’s 1 trillion euros ($1.2 trillion) of three-
year loans offered in December and February.  To contact the reporter on this story:
