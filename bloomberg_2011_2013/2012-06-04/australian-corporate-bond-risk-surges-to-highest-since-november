Australian corporate bond risk surged
to a more than six-month high, according to traders of credit-
default swaps. Asia and Japan risk gauges also climbed.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index jumped 10 basis points to
212 basis points as of 10:15 a.m. in Sydney, according to
 Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC)  prices. The index of default swap
contracts on 25 companies is set for the highest close since
Nov. 28, and the biggest daily increase since May 16, according
to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan rose 5 basis points to 210.5 as of 9
a.m. in  Hong Kong , Deutsche Bank AG prices show. The gauge is on
course for its highest close since Dec. 20, according to CMA,
which is owned by CME Group Inc. and compiles prices quoted by
dealers in the privately negotiated market.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index increased 5.5 basis points to
205.5 basis points as of 10:07 a.m. in  Tokyo , Citigroup Inc.
prices show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
