Iran  has set up a crude oil storage
facility with a capacity of 1 million barrels in the
southwestern Bushehr province,  Press TV  reported, citing an
Iranian Offshore Oil Co. official.  The storage facility has been domestically built and is
located in the Bahregan oil district, said Mohammad-Reza Khajeh-
Jahromi, head of the region for the company, according to the
article published yesterday by the state-run news channel.  Iran seeks to increase its crude-storage capacity by about
50 percent to 100 million barrels by the end of 2015, the
country’s oil ministry said on May 21.  International sanctions against Iran over its nuclear
program have hampered crude exports from the second-largest
producer in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
Much of Iran’s unsold March production ended up in onshore and
floating storage in April, according to the  International Energy
Agency . The European Union is set to ban purchases of Iranian
crude starting in July, possibly intensifying Iran’s need for
additional storage facilities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
