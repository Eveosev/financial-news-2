Japan opened Asia’s final group
qualifying stage for the 2014  World Cup  with a 3-0 win over Oman
as it aims for a fifth straight appearance at soccer’s four-
yearly championship.  Keisuke Honda, Ryoichi Maeda and Shinji Okazaki scored in
Saitama yesterday for Asian champion Japan, while Iraq and
Jordan drew 1-1 in the other Group B game. The five-team pool
also includes  Australia , which visits Oman on June 8.  Iran and Qatar opened Group A with 1-0 road wins against
Uzbekistan and Lebanon respectively. Uzbekistan coach Vadim
Abramov said his team should have been awarded a goal in the
second half when a shot from Odil Ahmedov crossed the line.  “We scored a goal in the second half, but the referees
didn’t see it,” Abramov said in comments on the Asian Football
Confederation’s website. “ Iran  had two chances and won it.”  Asia’s 10 remaining teams have a yearlong phase of home-
and-away games, with the winners and runners-up from each group
taking the region’s four direct berths at the 2014 World Cup in
Brazil. The third-place teams will playoff for the right to take
on South America’s fifth-ranked nation over two matches for
another spot.  Colombia moved into fifth place in the nine-team South
American standings yesterday as James Rodriguez scored the only
goal in a 1-0 win at Peru. The top four teams gain World Cup
berths alongside Brazil, which is guaranteed a spot as host.  Argentina leads the group with  10 points  after beating
Ecuador 4-0 two days ago. Second-place Chile defeated Bolivia
2-0 and Venezuela tied 1-1 at Uruguay.  To contact the reporter on this story:
