Ivory Coast  expects cotton output to
rise as much as 31 percent this season, nearing an amount last
attained before a decade-long political crisis, after industry
changes which may see farmers earn more for the crop.  Production is forecast at 300,000 metric tons to 340,000
tons in the season that started last month and goes to April
2013, Lacina Tuo, president of the Abidjan-based National
Association of Cotton Growers and Ginners, known as Intercoton,
said by phone on May 31. That compares with 260,000 tons grown
in the 2011-12 harvest, he said.  “If we get rain at a good time, we should easily reach
340,000 tons,” Tuo said.  The West African nation, the world’s biggest cocoa grower,
produced 350,000 tons of cotton before a military uprising in
2002 that split the country between a government-held south and
a rebel-controlled north. Output declined to a low of 110,000
tons in 2008, Tuo said. Cotton is grown mainly in the north and
central part of the country.  Ivory Coast reorganized the cotton industry for the new
season, introducting a system that will see the minimum rate
guaranteed by the government increased if prices are higher than
forecast, he said.  Minimum Price  “We are trying to put the industry in order so as to
encourage the farmers to grow again,” Tuo said. “Farmers will
get a minimum wage but if the international prices are better
than expected, they’ll get more,” he said.  The government’s minimum price for top-grade cotton was set
at 265  CFA francs  ($0.50) a kilogram (2.2 pounds), while the
price for second grade is 240 francs a kilogram, Tuo said. The
prices are similar to last season, he said.  Cotton for December delivery dropped 3 percent to 65.5
cents a pound by 10:45 a.m. in  London .  Tuo said around 120,000 farmers may grow cotton this
season, an increase from the 87,000 in the previous harvest.  “Many farmers want to get back to the fields to grow
cotton,” Tuo said. “They believe again they can make money
from cotton after 10 years of troubles in the sector.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
