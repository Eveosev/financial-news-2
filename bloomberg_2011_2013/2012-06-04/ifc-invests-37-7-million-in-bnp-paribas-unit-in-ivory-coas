The World Bank’s International
Finance Corp. invested 20 billion CFA francs ($37.7 million) in
 BNP Paribas SA (BNP) ’s unit in Ivory Coast, to raise capital for
small- and medium-sized businesses in the West African nation.  The funding for  BICICI (BICC)  is meant for companies in
agriculture, health care, public works and transportation,
according to a statement e-mailed on June 1, which was signed by
the bank’s director general, Fabien Riguet, and IFC’s country
representative, Cassandra Colbert.  “This agreement is the first IFC investment in the banking
sector since the end of the crisis,” according to the IFC and
the bank. “Small and medium-sized businesses in Ivory Coast are
facing numerous difficulties including limited access to credit
from commercial lenders.”  Ivory Coast’s economy contracted 4.7 percent in 2011 after
a five-month crisis triggered by a disputed presidential
election in November 2010. Growth this year is forecast at about
8 percent, according to the  International Monetary Fund .  To contact the reporter on this story:
