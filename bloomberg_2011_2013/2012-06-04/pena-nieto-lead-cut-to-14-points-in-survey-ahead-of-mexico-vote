Mexico presidential front-runner
Enrique Pena Nieto’s lead narrowed to 14 percentage points in
the latest opinion survey ahead of July 1 elections amid
student-led street protests against his candidacy.  Pena Nieto of the  Institutional Revolutionary Party  had
37.8 percent support in the poll by Buendia y Laredo published
today in Mexican newspaper El Universal, down from 41.9 percent
three weeks ago. Backing for  Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador  of the
Party of the Democratic Revolution rose to 23.9 percent from
20.9 percent.  Students from private and public universities claiming
media organizations are biased toward Pena Nieto have organized
protests in major cities around the country in recent weeks.
Today’s survey showed 47 percent of respondents approve of the
marches, while 32 percent say they are not in favor.  Josefina Vazquez Mota of the ruling National Action Party
Party had 22.4 percent in the Buendia y Laredo poll, up from
from 19.4 percent last month.  Pena Nieto leads among all segments of the population
except among people who are college educated, where Lopez
Obrador has 33 percent backing to Pena Nieto’s 31 percent and
Vazquez Mota’s 24 percent, the poll said.  The survey of 1,000 voters taken May 24 to May 28 had a 3.5
percentage point margin of error.  Reforma newspaper released a poll May 31 that showed Pena
Nieto’s lead over  Lopez Obrador  had narrowed to 4 percentage
points, the closest of any major survey. The Mexico City-based
newspaper is the only major daily not to use an independent
polling company for its surveys.  To contact the reporter on this story:
