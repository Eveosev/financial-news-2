Sabirhan Hasanoff, accused of
providing money and computer assistance to al-Qaeda, pleaded
guilty in  Manhattan  federal court.  Hasanoff pleaded guilty today before U.S. District Judge
Kimba Wood.  A second man in the case, Wesam El-Hanafi, has pleaded not
guilty.  Prosecutors alleged that in February 2008, El-Hanafi, a
U.S. citizen born in Brooklyn, New York, swore an oath of
allegiance to al-Qaeda in  Yemen , where he met the senior leaders
of the terrorist group. He is charged with buying computer
encryption software and seven Casio digital watches for use by
al-Qaeda.  Back in the U.S., prosecutors claim, El-Hanafi recruited
Hasanoff, who holds joint U.S. and Australian citizenship, into
a “mini-terror cell.”  The case is U.S. v. El-Hanafi, 10-cr-00162, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
