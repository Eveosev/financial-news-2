Biox Corp. (BX) , a Canadian biofuels
company, plans to build a 100-million liter (26-million gallon)
biodiesel plant in Bayonne, New Jersey, at New York Harbor.  The plant’s annual production capacity will be about 50
percent larger than the company’s existing facility in Ontario,
according to a statement today.  Demand for biodiesel in North American will grow because
U.S. oil companies are mandated to  blend  36 billion gallons of
biofuels with their fuel products by 2022, Biox said.  “The fundamentals within the North American biodiesel
sector have evolved due to the mandated minimum volumes,” Chief
Executive Officer Kevin Norton said in the statement.  The facility is expected to be complete by December 2013,
according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
