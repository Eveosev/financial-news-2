Japanese and Australian stock futures
climbed amid speculation global policy makers will take steps to
stimulate economic growth and after a four-day drop left the
regional gauge at the cheapest level this year.  American depositary receipts of  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the
world’s largest mining company, rose 1.8 percent from the
closing share price in Sydney as commodity prices advanced. ADRs
of  Canon Inc. (7751) , a Japanese camera maker whose shares fell to the
lowest level since April 2009, gained 4.1 percent.  Japan Tobacco
Inc. (2914) , Asia’s largest cigarette maker, may climb after Deutsche
Bank AG advised buying the shares.  Futures on Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average expiring in
June closed at 8,335 in Chicago yesterday, up from 8,290 in
Osaka, Japan. They were bid in the pre-market at 8,330 in Osaka
at 8:05 a.m. local time. Futures on Australia’s S&P/ASX 200
Index advanced 0.5 percent. Reserve Bank of Australia Governor
Glenn Stevens may cut the overnight cash-rate target today by
half a quarter percentage point to 3.25 percent, swap markets
show. New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index slid 0.7 percent in Wellington.  “We are likely to see a reasonably strong policy response
in a number of countries,” said  Angus Gluskie , managing
director at White Funds Management in Sydney, who manages more
than $350 million. “It’s stacking up to be a reasonably good
buying opportunity.”  U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  may respond
to weakness in the job market by announcing further steps to
stimulate growth, according to  Michael Feroli , chief U.S.
economist at JPMorgan Chase & Co. in New York.  Europe, China  The  European Central Bank  may cut its benchmark interest
rate from 1 percent as soon as this week,  Holger Schmieding ,
chief economist at Berenberg Bank in London, said in a June 1
report. China will respond with a 2 trillion  yuan  ($314 billion)
fiscal stimulus this year and next, according to Donald
Straszheim, senior managing director of New York-based ISI
Group.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.1 percent
today. The index advanced less than 0.1 percent in New York
yesterday, reversing earlier losses.  The  MSCI Asia-Pacific Index (MXAP)  has fallen 15 percent from its
peak this year on Feb. 29. The measure slumped 10 percent in
May, the biggest monthly loss since October 2008, when global
markets tumbled following the collapse of Lehman Brother
Holdings Inc. Equities continued declines into June as a U.S.
jobs report added to concern global growth is slowing amid a
deepening debt crisis in Europe.  Valuations Slump  The MSCI Asia-Pacific has fallen 4.2 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with a 4.4 percent drop on the Stoxx
Europe 600 Index and a 1.6 percent gain on the  S&P 500 . Declines
in regional equity markets dragged down valuations on the Asian
benchmark to 11.2 times  estimated earnings  on average, the
lowest this year. That compares with 12.2 times for the S&P 500
and 9.7 times for the Stoxx 600.  Japan ’s Topix Index entered a bear market yesterday, with
stocks plunging to a level not seen since 1983 as Europe’s debt
crisis spurs a global flight from risk assets, driving up the
yen, which reduces the value of export earnings when
repatriated.  The Bloomberg China-US Equity Index of the most-traded
Chinese companies in the U.S. fell 0.6 percent to 86.71
yesterday in New York, after tumbling 16 percent in the last
five weeks.  The Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of raw materials
climbed 0.6 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
