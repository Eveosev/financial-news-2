A civilian council that advises
 Egypt ’s military rulers recommended changing the composition of
a committee to draft the country’s new constitution.  The head of the council, Sameh Ashour, told reporters today
that they had proposed the committee include the heads of
political parties represented in parliament, as well as the
heads of religious institutions, judicial authorities and civil
society representatives.  The proposal, which is being evaluated by the ruling
generals, marks the latest attempt to convene a new committee
after a court in April ruled against its earlier composition.
This effectively halted efforts to draft the new charter ahead
of the planned handover of power by the military to a civilian
president by the end of June.  Secularists, revolutionary youth groups and others had
protested the earlier group’s makeup, saying it was dominated by
Islamists. The now-disbanded 100-member body had included 50
people drawn from parliament and an equal number of
independents. Critics maintained that many of the independents
were sympathetic to the Islamist lawmakers represented in the
panel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
