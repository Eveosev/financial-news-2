Options traders  are making the fewest
bearish bets in 15 months on a Russian exchange-traded fund in
New York after oil sinking to a seven-month low pushed
valuations to half the multiple for emerging-market stocks.  Ownership of puts on the  Market Vectors Russia ETF (RSX)  fell
below call open interest on May 30, retreating to the lowest
level since February 2011, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Russian  stock futures  expiring in June on the dollar-
denominated  RTS index (RTSI$)  slipped 0.2 percent to 122,045 on June 1
while the  Bloomberg Russia-US 14 Index (RUS14BN)  of Russian stocks traded
in New York lost 2.2 percent to 79.15. The gauge plunged 22
percent in May, the most since October 2008.  Crude oil,  Russia ’s biggest export earner, dropped to the
lowest level in almost eight months as Brent closed below $100
for the first time since October on mounting concern a global
economic slump will cut demand for fuel. The tumble sent
 valuations  on the Micex Index to 4.8 times estimated earnings
for member companies, less than half the average multiple for
 MSCI Emerging Markets Index (MXEF)  stocks. A European Union official
said the group is targeting July 9 as the start date for its
rescue fund.  “Yes, Russian equity prices went down a whole lot in May
but people may be forgetting that markets don’t go in a straight
line forever,”  Ian McCall , who overseas $109 million as
managing partner at Quesnell Capital SA, said by phone from
Geneva on June 1. “If we get some action that shows that
European authorities are doing something proactive, then people
can begin to take a stab at some of the valuations in Russia.”  The U.S-traded ETF, which holds Russian shares, fell 2.9
percent to $23.24 on June 1, extending a 20 percent drop in May.
The gauge’s  volatility index , which measures expected swings in
the index’s futures contracts, dropped 2 percent to 45.78.  ‘Heavily Oversold’  The ratio of outstanding puts to sell versus calls to buy
dropped to 0.95 on May 30, the lowest since February 2011, data
compiled by Bloomberg shows. Put open interest on the exchange-
traded fund plummeted 80 percent since May 17. The put-to-call
ratio dropped from a two-year high of 2.36-to-1 on April 26.  The 30-stock  Micex (INDEXCF) , the cheapest of the 21  emerging markets 
tracked by Bloomberg, dropped 0.6 percent to 1,298.08 on June 1.
The gauge, which has lost 7.4 percent this year, lags behind
 Brazil ’s  Bovespa (IBOV)  index’s 5.9 percent decline and the  Shanghai
Composite Index (SHCOMP)  7.9 percent gain.  Russian manufacturing expanded in May at the fastest pace
since March 2011 as new business orders prompted companies to
boost output and hire workers.  “We see equities that have been heavily oversold even
though there’s nothing on the macro side in Russia,” Jonathan Neill, who helps manage $250 million at FPP Asset Management LLP
in London, said in a phone interview on June 1. “The sell-off
has more to do with general  risk aversion .”  Fewest Workers  The  Standard & Poor’s 500 (SPX)  Index plummeted the most since
November, tumbling 2.5 percent to 1,278.04 as U.S. employers
added the fewest workers in a year and the jobless rate rose to
8.2 percent from 8.1 percent. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average (INDU) 
lost 2.2 percent to 12,118.57.  United Co. Rusal, the world’s largest aluminum producer,
dropped 2 percent to HK$4.52 in Hong Kong trading as of 11:34
a.m. local time. The MSCI  Asia  Pacific Index fell 2.1 percent
today after a non-manufacturing  purchasing managers’ index  in
 China  fell May from from the previous month.  OAO Surgutneftegas (SGTPY) , Russia’s fourth largest oil producer,
fell the most in three weeks, dropping 4.6 percent to $4.75 as
crude futures for July delivery declined 3.8 percent to $83.23 a
barrel on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange, the lowest
settlement since Oct. 7. Surgutneftegas  shares  in Moscow slipped
0.1 percent to 15.97 rubles, the equivalent of 47 cents. One ADR
equals 10 ordinary shares.  Commodities Tumble  Brent for July settlement tumbled 3.4 percent to $98.43 a
barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange, the
lowest close since Jan. 27, 2011. The European benchmark fell
7.9 percent last week and has lost 8.3 percent this year. Urals
crude, Russia’s chief export blend, slid 3 percent to $96.86.  Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot Index fell 2.6 percent to
580.99 as China led a slowdown in manufacturing across Asia.
Copper futures fell for a fifth straight week as the contract
for July delivery fell 1.5 percent to settle at $3.3135 a pound
on the Comex in New York on June 1. Nickel declined 0.8 percent
to $16,100 a ton on the  London  Metal Exchange.  Sberbank dropped 4.5 percent to $9.46, an eight-month low,
as the ruble tumbled for an eighth day to the lowest since 2009
against the dollar, prompting “intensive” central bank
interventions. The ruble slid 0.6 percent to 33.68 per dollar by
the 7 p.m. close in Moscow on June 1. A weaker ruble encourages
Russians to withdraw and convert ruble deposits, Sberbank’s main
source of funding.  The RTS Index in Moscow declined 1.2 percent on June 1 to
1,227.42.  To contact the reporters on this story:
