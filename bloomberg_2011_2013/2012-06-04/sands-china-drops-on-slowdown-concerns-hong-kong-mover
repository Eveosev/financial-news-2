Sands China Ltd. (1928) , the Asian unit of
Sheldon Adelson’s Las Vegas company, led a decline in Hong Kong-
traded casino stocks amid concern slowing economic growth in
China could hurt revenue growth in Macau’s gambling hub.  Sands China dropped 4.8 percent to HK$25.05 at the close of
Hong Kong trading, while  Galaxy Entertainment Group Ltd. (27)  slid
3.1 percent and  Wynn Macau Ltd. (1128)  lost 4.2 percent. The benchmark
 Hang Seng Index  declined 2 percent.  Growth in Macau, the world’s largest gambling hub, has
slowed this year after mainland Chinese tourists pushed gaming
revenue up 42 percent in 2011. China’s purchasing managers’
index fell to 55.2 in May, adding to evidence of slower growth
in the world’s second-biggest economy.  “The decline in Macau’s gaming revenue growth as well as
China’s sliding PMI all signal a slowdown in the economy,” said
Gabriel Chan, a Hong Kong-based analyst at Credit Suisse Group
AG. “The gaming sector is attractive in the longer term, but we
are waiting for a better entry point.”  Macau’s gambling revenue increased 7.3 percent in May, the
slowest pace since July 2009. Gambling revenue last month for
the six casino operators in the former Portuguese colony rose to
26.1 billion patacas ($3.3 billion) from 24.3 billion patacas a
year ago, the  Chinese city’s Gaming Inspection and Coordination
Bureau said June 1.  MGM China Holdings Ltd. (2282)  fell 5.3 percent to HK$11.10,  SJM
Holdings Ltd. (880)  dropped 4.5 percent and  Melco Crown Entertainment
Ltd. (6883)  slumped 6.1 percent at the close of Hong Kong trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
