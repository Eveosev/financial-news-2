OAO Dixy Group rallied after Interfax
reported it plans to buy the stock of shareholders who don’t
vote in favour of an 18 billion ruble ($538 million) loan.  Dixy jumped 1.9 percent to 302.55 rubles by the close in
Moscow after rising as much as 5 percent earlier.  The Russian food retailer will offer 338.95 rubles a share
and will hold its annual meeting on June 28, the news service
reported, without saying where it got the information.  “The buyout offer is about 12 percent higher than the
market price,” Marina Gutneva, an analyst at Aton LLC in
Moscow, said by phone.  Dixy’s net income more than doubled in the first quarter
from the same period last year to 356 million rubles, the
company said earlier. Sales almost doubled to 34.7 billion
rubles.  To contact the reporter on this story:
