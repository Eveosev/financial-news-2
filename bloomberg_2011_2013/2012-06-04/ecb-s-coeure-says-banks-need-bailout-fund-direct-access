The  euro zone  needs a single bank
resolution mechanism and fund as well as a unified deposit
insurance plan, European Central Bank Executive Board member
Benoit Coeure said.  Banks that must be recapitalized should be allowed to
directly access the European Financial Stability Facility and,
once it’s in place, the European Stability Mechanism, Coeure
said at the Festival dell’Economia in Trento,  Italy .  “Letting euro area banks access the EFSF/ESM should not be
a way for governments to escape their responsibilities and to
rid themselves of the cost of past errors,” Coeure said. “It
should be accompanied by strong, centralized supervision of
systemically important institutions.”  The ECB said the speech, published today, was delivered on
June 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
