Global stocks declined, with gauges
of Japanese and Chinese equities falling more than 20 percent
below their peaks after data from the U.S. and China added to
evidence of a global economic slowdown. Oil tumbled and the
dollar strengthened.  The MSCI All-Country-World Index lost 0.5 percent as of
8:02 a.m. in  London  and Euro Stoxx 50 Index slid 0.6 percent
after entering a so-called  bear market  on June 1.  Japan ’s Topix
Index slid 1.9 percent, the lowest close since Dec. 13, 1983,
and  Hong Kong ’s Hang Seng China Enterprises Index dropped 2.8
percent. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index futures slipped 0.5
percent, oil retreated to an eight-month low and the dollar rose
against most major currencies.  “People are more concerned about a return of their capital
as opposed to a return on their capital,” said Nick Maroutsos
who oversees about $2.9 billion as managing director and co-
founder of Sydney-based Kapstream Capital. “The recovery is
still going to continue to have fits and starts. We need
something more substantial that’s going to get investors back
into the market. Until we get that, we’re not going to see risk
assets perform well.”  China ’s non-manufacturing  purchasing managers’ index  fell
to 55.2 in May from 56.1 in April, the National Bureau of
Statistics and China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing said
yesterday in Beijing. U.S. unemployment rose to 8.2 percent in
May and payrolls increased less than the most-pessimistic
forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of economists, Labor
Department figures showed June 1. European leaders remain
divided on solutions for the region’s debt crisis.  Dollar Strengthens  The greenback advanced against 14 of its 16 major peers,
with the Australian dollar leading declines, down 0.4 percent to
96.65 U.S. cents. The euro slid 0.2 percent to $1.2414.  Australian bonds climbed, with yields on maturities of one
year or longer falling to record lows. Australian  three-year
yields  declined as much as 14 basis points to a record 1.89
percent. The one-year-rate touched 2.338 percent. Yields on
Japan’s benchmark 10-year securities fell to 0.79 percent, the
least since June 2003.  Australian corporate bond risk surged to the highest level
since November, according to traders of credit-default swaps,
with the Markit iTraxx Australia index jumping 9 basis points to
211, according to Westpac Banking Corp. The gauge of default
swap contracts on 25 companies was set for the highest close
since Nov. 29.  The MSCI Asia-Pacific Index dropped as much as 2.4 percent
to the lowest level since October, with 15 shares falling for
each that rose.  Sony Corp. (6758)  dropped below 1,000 yen in Tokyo
trading for the first time since 1980, when the Walkman was
introduced in the U.S. The shares fell as much as 2.3 percent to
990 yen on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.  Oil, Copper  “There’s a lot of psychological pressure among investors
with the weak non-manufacturing data in China and global issues
such as U.S. data and the euro crisis dragging on stocks,” said
Tang Yonggang, an analyst at Hongyuan Securities Co. in Beijing.  Oil for July delivery lost as much as 2.1 percent to $81.50
a barrel in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange , the lowest close since October. Copper futures for
July delivery fell 1.8 percent to $3.2590 a pound on the Comex
in  New York . The London Metal Exchange is closed today for a
