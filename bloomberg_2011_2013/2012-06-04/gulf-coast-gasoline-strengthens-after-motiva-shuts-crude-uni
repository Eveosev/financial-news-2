Gulf Coast  gasoline strengthened
after Motiva Enterprises LLC stopped operating its new 330,000-
barrel-a-day crude unit at the Port Arthur  refinery  in  Texas .  One side of the unit was shut down and the other side was
put on circulation, said two people, who declined to be
identified because they arenâ€™t authorized to speak for the
company.  The discount for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in the
Gulf Coast narrowed 1.67 cents to 9.58 cents a gallon versus
futures traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 12:09
p.m., according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt delivery
rose 1.81 cents to $2.5624 a gallon.  The premium for ultra-low-sulfur diesel in the Gulf versus
heating oil futures rose 0.75 cent to 3.38 cents a gallon. It is
the  highest level  since May 15.  Emily Oberton, a Houston-based spokeswoman for the Motiva
refinery, declined to comment.  Phillips 66 reported a process upset at its Borger, Texas,
refinery on June 1, according to a June 2 filing with state
regulators.  Valero Energy Corp. (VLO)  flared gases at its Corpus Christi East
refinery in Texas because of operating conditions within the
plant, according to a message left on a community information
line.  To contact the reporter on this story:
