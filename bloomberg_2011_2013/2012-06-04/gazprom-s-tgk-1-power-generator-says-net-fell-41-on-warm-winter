OAO TGK-1, a power utility owned by
state-run natural-gas producer OAO Gazprom, said first-quarter
profit slumped 41 percent as a warm start to the year cut demand
for heating and power prices declined.  Net income dropped to 2.73 billion rubles ($82 million)
from 4.64 billion rubles a year earlier, TGK-1 said today in a
statement on its website.  Unseasonably warm weather in the first quarter reduced heat
consumption, while day-ahead market prices for electricity
decreased, TGK-1 said.  Fortum Oyj (FUM1V) , Finland’s biggest utility,
holds a 25.7 percent stake in the St. Petersburg-based
generating company.  Revenue decreased 5.9 percent to 19.8 billion rubles, while
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization
dropped 16 percent to 5.15 billion rubles.  To contact the reporter on this story:
