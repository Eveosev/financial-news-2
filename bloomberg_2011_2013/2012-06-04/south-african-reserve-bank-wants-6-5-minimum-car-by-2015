The South African Reserve Bank’s
banking supervision unit said it proposes a minimum required
Tier 1 capital adequacy ratio of 6.5% for South African lenders
from January 2015.  It also proposes a 10 percent total capital adequacy ratio,
the Bank Supervision Department said in a statement released in
 Pretoria  today.  South African banks are adequately capitalized in order to
meet impending Basel III requirements, the unit said, adding
that it will start formally monitoring the lenders’ liquidity
coverage ratios and net stable funding ratios from January next
year.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
