Amadeu Altafaj, the spokesman for
European Union Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner  Olli Rehn , will be moving into a policy role and out of his media-
focused job.  Simon O’Connor, another member of the EU’s communication
staff, will succeed Altafaj as Rehn’s spokesman, EU spokeswoman
Pia Ahrenkilde-Hansen said today in Brussels. Altafaj will
become a member of Rehn’s policy staff. The transition will take
place in the coming weeks, she said, without providing an exact
timetable.  To contact the reporter on this story:
