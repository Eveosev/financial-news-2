China ’s stocks fell the most in six
months after the nation’s non-manufacturing industries expanded
at a slower pace for a second month and fewer U.S. jobs were
added than economists estimated.  PetroChina Co. (601857) , the second-largest oil refiner, dropped to
a record low as the Shanghai Securities News reported fuel
prices may be cut and JPMorgan Chase & Co. lowered its estimate
for China’s gross domestic product for the second time in a
month. Sany Heavy Industry Co., China’s biggest machinery maker,
declined 4.4 percent after Nomura Holdings Inc. reduced its
outlook for the industry.  “There’s a lot of psychological pressure among investors
with the weak non-manufacturing data in China and global issues
such as U.S. data and the euro crisis dragging on stocks,” said
Tang Yonggang, an analyst at Hongyuan Securities Co. in Beijing.
“We are hoping for more stimulus measures in June and are
anticipating reserve-ratio cuts or even interest-rate cuts this
month to boost the economy.”  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  fell 2.7 percent to 2,308.55
at the close, the biggest drop since Nov. 30. The  CSI 300 Index (SHSZ300) 
retreated 2.8 percent to 2,559.03. The Hang Seng China
Enterprises Index of mainland stocks dropped 2.6 percent to
9,375.33, sinking more than 20 percent from this year’s peak on
Feb. 29, a decline that traders consider a  bear market .  Today’s losses, coming on the 23rd anniversary of the
Tiananmen Square crackdown, pared the Shanghai Composite’s gains
this year to 5 percent. A search for “Shanghai composite” was
blocked on Sina Corp.’s Weibo microblog platform, after the
stock gauge closed down 64.89 points today. The crackdown began
overnight on June 4, 1989.  Nothing Abnormal  “We didn’t see anything abnormal in the market today,”
said Chen Ji, spokesman for the  Shanghai Stock Exchange . “We
don’t have any further comment.”  The index has rebounded from two years of losses on
optimism the government will ease monetary policies and
accelerate approvals of infrastructure projects to spur growth.
Stocks in the measure are valued at 10 times estimated earnings,
compared with a record low of 8.9 times on Jan. 6, according to
 weekly data  compiled by Bloomberg.  The purchasing managers’ index fell to 55.2 in May from
56.1 in April, the National Bureau of Statistics and China
Federation of Logistics and Purchasing said in a statement
yesterday in Beijing. That’s the lowest reading since March 2011
when the federation started seasonally adjusting the data. A
reading above 50 indicates expansion.  Slowdown Spreading  “The data reinforce the message that the slowdown has
spread from the manufacturing sector to the services sector,”
said  Tim Condon , chief Asia economist at ING Financial Markets
in  Singapore . “The current slowdown is more complicated to read
than the 2008 global financial crisis and is stressing the
authorities’ vaunted fine-tuning skills.”  Service industries  now account for 43 percent of the
economy, the federation said in yesterday’s statement. The
manufacturing PMI compiled by the statistics bureau and
logistics federation expanded at the slowest pace since
December, according to a June 1 report.  JPMorgan cut China’s 2012 growth forecast to 7.7 percent
from its previous estimate of 8 percent, citing increasing
downside risks in the euro area. This comes after it cut the
estimate to 8 percent from 8.2 percent in a May 2011 note.  Growth Estimates  A gauge of  energy producers  in the CSI 300 fell 3.9
percent, the most among 10 industry groups. China Shenhua Energy
Co., the largest coal producer, slid 2.6 percent to 25.21  yuan .
Yanzhou Coal Mining Co. declined 3.9 percent to 21.91 yuan.  The benchmark power-station coal price at Qinhuangdao port
fell the most in five months as a slowdown in the world’s
second-biggest economy cut demand for electricity and caused
stockpiles across the country to surge.  PetroChina declined 1.7 percent to 9.30 yuan, a record low.
 China Petroleum & Chemical Corp. (600028) , the largest Chinese refiner
known as Sinopec, fell 3.1 percent 6.49 yuan. China may cut gas
and diesel prices by about 700 yuan per ton, the Shanghai
Securities News said, citing industry website Chem99.com.  Sinopec’s losses from refining increased 16-fold in the
first quarter from a year earlier and PetroChina’s operating
losses widened as the government capped fuel-price increases.  Europe Debt  German  Chancellor Angela Merkel  meets fellow coalition
leaders today after opposing joint debt sharing in the euro
area. Europe is China’s biggest export market, making up about
18 percent of the nation’s overseas shipments, according to
Shenyin & Wanguo Securities Co.  Sany Heavy dropped 4.4 percent to 14.26 yuan.  Zoomlion
Heavy industry Science and Technology Co. , the second-biggest
construction machinery maker, slid 3.6 percent to 10.61 yuan.
Nomura said excavator-industry sales to China will fall 27
percent in 2012, compared with a prior estimate of a 12 percent
decline, as fixed-asset investment will be weaker-than-expected.  About 7.77 billion shares changed hands on the Shanghai
Composite on June 1, 3 percent lower than the daily average this
year. The  Bloomberg China-US 55 Index (CH55BN) , the measure of the most-
traded U.S.-listed Chinese companies, tumbled 3.4 percent to
87.22 on June 1 in  New York , the biggest slump since Nov. 21.  Chinese equities traded in New York fell the most in six
months on June 1, as SouFun Holdings Ltd. sank to a one-week low
after data indicated housing prices fell and manufacturing
slowed in the world’s second-largest economy.  The  iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund , the biggest Chinese
exchange-traded fund in the U.S., tumbled 2.4 percent to $32.69,
following a 12 percent decline in May. The Standard & Poor’s 500
Index of U.S. shares slumped 2.5 percent to 1,278.04 as U.S.
employers in May added the fewest workers in a year.  Home Prices  Payrolls climbed by 69,000 last month, less than the most-
pessimistic forecast in a Bloomberg News survey, after a revised
77,000 gain in April that was smaller than initially estimated,
Labor Department figures showed yesterday in  Washington . The
median projection called for a 150,000 May advance. The jobless
rate rose to 8.2 percent from 8.1 percent.  SouFun, owner of China’s biggest real estate website, lost
5.3 percent to $14.94 in New York trading on June 1, the lowest
since May 25, after sinking as much as 10 percent. American
depositary receipts of Shanghai-based E-House China Holdings
Ltd. decreased 5.7 percent to $5.14, extending their three-day
loss to 16 percent.  China’s home prices declined 0.3 percent from April to
8,684 yuan ($1,363) per square meter (10.76 square feet), SouFun
said in an e-mailed statement June 1, based on its survey of 100
cities in the country. That’s the lowest since January 2011 and
the ninth month-on-month drop, the longest stretch since it
started compiling the data in July 2010.  China’s stocks “are two to four weeks away from the bottom
before a significant rebound,”  Michael Shaoul , chairman of
Marketfield Asset Management in New York, which oversees more
than $1.6 billion, said by phone June 1. “There is strong
evidence the Chinese domestic economy is decelerating. There’s a
race between data in China and government action.”  -- Editors: Allen Wan, Richard Frost  To contact the reporter on this story:
