Al Armendariz, the EPA official who
once joked about crucifying corporate polluters, may be in for a
more modest form of torment this week at the hands of  House
Republicans .  Armendariz resigned his post in April as a regional
administrator for the Environmental Protection Agency in Dallas
after Republicans unearthed comments he made during a town hall
comparing his approach to enforcing pollution laws to the early
Romans, who he said would subdue towns in alien territory by
crucifying the first five people they ran across.  “And then you know that town was really easy to manage for
the next few years,” he said in a videotaped meeting in Dish,
Texas, in 2010.  For Republican lawmakers in Washington, an apology for the
remarks, loss of his job and disavowals by the White House and
EPA Administrator  Lisa Jackson  aren’t enough. On Wednesday a
panel of the  House Energy and Commerce Committee  will grill him
about his comments and record as head of an EPA region that
includes the energy-rich states of Texas, Oklahoma,  New Mexico ,
Arkansas and Louisiana.  “While you have apologized for these comments, there is
genuine concern that your comments reflect the agency’s overall
enforcement philosophy,” committee chairman Fred Upton of
Michigan and other Republican members wrote in a letter to
Armendariz three days before he resigned.  Armendariz was a target of industry from the moment he was
tapped for the EPA position from his job as a civil engineering
 professor  at  Southern Methodist University . Before he took over
in 2009, he authored a  study  that contended drilling is the
major cause of air pollution in Dallas, a finding disputed by
industry and state regulators.  Two specific issues are expected to be highlighted by
lawmakers this week.  As regional administrator, Armendariz greenlighted an
administrative order against gas-driller  Range Resources Corp. (RRC) 
in late 2010, saying it caused methane to leak into a
homeowner’s well. State regulators cleared Range of any
wrongdoing, and the EPA settled with Range in March.  The Republican members may also bring up Chase Power
Development LLC’s application for a permit from the EPA in
October 2011 to build a new power plant in  Corpus Christi ,
Texas. The agency is still considering the application, and the
project remains on hold.  ALSO WORTH WATCHING:  FRACKING-METHANE: America’s Natural Gas Alliance and the
 American Petroleum Institute  on June 4 report on methane
emissions from hydraulic fracturing. Environmentalists oppose
the drilling technique, known as fracking.  NUKE WASTE: U.S. Senators Jeff Bingaman and  Lisa Murkowski  on
June 6 will be taking part in a discussion about what to do with
the country’s nuclear waste sponsored by the Bipartisan Policy
Center. The event is being held at the Hyatt Regency in
 Washington .  To contact the reporter on this story:
