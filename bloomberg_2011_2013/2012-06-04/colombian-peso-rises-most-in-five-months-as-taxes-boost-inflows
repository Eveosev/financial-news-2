Colombia ’s peso rose the most in
almost five months as companies bought the currency before local
tax payments this month.  The peso advanced 0.8 percent to 1,816.4 per  U.S. dollar  at
10:31 a.m. in Bogota. That’s the biggest gain on a closing basis
since Jan. 10. The currency plunged 3.6 percent in May, its
biggest monthly drop since November, as the deepening European
debt crisis discouraged appetite for Colombia’s assets. It’s
still up 6.8 percent this year, the best performance among all
currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  “Companies have been preparing to pay taxes by bringing in
dollars” and selling them in the local market, said Daniel
Velandia, the head analyst at Correval SA brokerage in Bogota.
Companies are scheduled to pay taxes between June 8 and June 25.  The local currency also rose following gains in the euro
after European leaders agreed to discuss closer banking
cooperation in the euro bloc. European Commission President  Jose
Barroso  and German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  agreed to discuss
proposals on banking coordination when they meet today in
Berlin.  The yield on Colombia’s 10 percent peso-denominated debt
due July 2024 fell four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point,
to 7.1 percent, according to the central bank. The price rose
0.322 centavo to 123.055 centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
