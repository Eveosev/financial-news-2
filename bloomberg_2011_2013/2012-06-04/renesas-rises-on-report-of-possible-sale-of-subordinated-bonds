Renesas Electronics Corp. (6723)  gained,
after dropping to a record low in Tokyo trading last week, as
the Nikkei newspaper reported the chipmaker may sell
subordinated bonds to  NEC Corp. (6701)  and two other shareholders.  The world’s biggest maker of automotive microcontrollers
jumped 13 percent to 255 yen on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. The
rebound pared the decline since April 1 to 56 percent and came
after the shares dropped on May 29 to 204 yen, the lowest close
on record for the Kawasaki, Japan-based company.  Renesas President Yasushi Akao met heads of NEC,  Hitachi
Ltd. (6501)  and  Mitsubishi Electric Corp. (6503)  separately on June 1 to ask
for aid and to explain his company’s restructuring plans, the
Nikkei said June 2, without saying where it got the information.
Renesas, which has lost money every year since 2010 when it was
formed by merging with NEC Electronics, is said to be planning
to cut 10,000 jobs and raise 100 billion yen ($1.3 billion).  Akao visited the three companies, spokesman Yoichi
Kobayashi said by phone today. He declined to comment on details
of the meeting.  The company presented a restructuring proposal last month
to its workers union and lenders Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group
Inc. and  Mizuho Financial Group Inc. (8411) , a person briefed on the
matter said May 25.  The chipmaker makes semiconductors that are used in
products from automobiles to consumer electronics for tasks
including triggering air bags in cars and controlling  DVD
players . The company’s  customers  include  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ,  Sony Corp. (6758) 
and Nintendo Co., according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
