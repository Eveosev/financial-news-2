German Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s
coalition no longer insists that a financial-transaction tax has
to cover at least the 17 euro countries,  Leipziger Volkszeitung 
newspaper reported today, citing a senior coalition member it
didn’t name.  After three hours of talks today in Berlin, Merkel and the
other leaders of her coalition parties,  Horst Seehofer  and
Philipp Roesler, agreed to aim to apply the levy in as many
countries in Europe as possible, the newspaper said.  The opposition Social Democrats, whose support Merkel needs
to pass the proposed fiscal pact on budgetary discipline, have
said they’ll only vote for the measure if the coalition changes
its stance on the transaction tax, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
