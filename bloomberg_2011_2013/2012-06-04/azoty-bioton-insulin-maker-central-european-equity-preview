The following is a list of companies
whose shares may have unusual price changes in central European
markets. Stock symbols are in parentheses after company names.
Share prices are from the last close.  Poland’s  WIG20 Index (WIG20)  fell 1.2 percent, the Czech  PX Index (PX) 
slid 0.7 percent and Hungary’s  BUX Index (BUX)  rose 1.8 percent.  Azoty Tarnow (ATT)  : The management board of Poland’s
biggest publicly traded chemicals producer is “strongly”
against an offer from OAO Acron of Russia. The Russian
fertilizer maker bid for a 66 percent stake in Azoty at 36 zloty
a share on May 16. Tarnow gained 0.3 percent to 38 zloty.  Bioton SA (BIO)  : Poland’s largest insulin maker can
expect more than 5 billion ($6.2 billion) euros of orders over
the next 15 years as long-term contracts produce a “surge” of
new business in China over the next 18 months, Chief Executive
Officer Slawomir Ziegert was quoted today as saying by Parkiet.
