German Chancellor Angela Merkel
recommended that Spain receive a bailout twice to the country’s
former Prime Minister  Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero ,  El Mundo 
reported, citing unidentified people close to Zapatero.  The first proposal, considered by Merkel as “the best
solution for Spain,” was made in May 2010 after Greece received
110 billion euros ($136.5 billion) in aid, and was suggested
again last year, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
