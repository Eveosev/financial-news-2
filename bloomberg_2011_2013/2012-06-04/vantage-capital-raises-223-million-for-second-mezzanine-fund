Vantage Capital , a South African
asset manager, raised 1.9 billion rand ($223 million) for its
second mezzanine fund that attracted investors including the
W.K. Kellogg Foundation.  The fund received capital from 20 institutional investors,
including 14 pension funds from South Africa and Botswana, as
well as the  Development Bank  of Southern Africa and the
Norwegian Investment Fund for Developing Countries, the
Johannesburg-based firm said today in an e-mailed statement.  The fund has invested more than 300 million rand in three
transactions, and has three other deals in the pipeline which
will soon bring total investments to more than 600 million rand,
Luc Albinski, co-managing partner of Vantage, said in the
statement.  The fund focuses on investments in mid-sized growth
companies in  South Africa  and the rest of the African continent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
