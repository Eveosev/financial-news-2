Russia ’s southern region of Stavropol
will contain a locust invasion within seven or eight days,
regional Agriculture Minister Alexander Martychev  said .  The region sprayed pesticides over 282,000 hectares
(696,800 acres) and will continue anti-locust measures over the
remaining 46,500 hectares this week, Martychev said in a
statement published on the ministry’s website today.  Stavropol is one of Russia’s top grain-growing regions. It
accounted for about 8.7 percent of Russia’s total grain crop
last year after it harvested about 8.2 million metric tons of
grain, according to the state statistics data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
