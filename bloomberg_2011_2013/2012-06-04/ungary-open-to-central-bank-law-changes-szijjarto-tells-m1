The Hungarian government is open to
more changes to the central bank law to boost the Magyar Nemzeti
Bank’s independence,  said  Peter Szijjarto , state secretary at
the prime minister’s office.  Hungary  will compromise “within the bounds of reason”
regarding a planned increase in the number of policy makers and
the nomination of a third vice president at the central bank,
Szijjarto said in an interview on public television  M1  today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
