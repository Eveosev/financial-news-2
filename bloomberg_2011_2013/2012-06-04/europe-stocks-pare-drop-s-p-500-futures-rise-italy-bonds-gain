U.S. stocks erased early losses as
the cheapest price-to-earnings valuation in six months
overshadowed a drop in factory orders. Treasury yields rose from
records, commodities reversed declines and the dollar fell.  The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  closed up less than 0.1
percent at 1,278.18 at 4 p.m. in New York after a 9.9 percent
tumble from a four-year high in April dragged it to 12.9 times
reported earnings, the lowest since November. Ten-year Treasury
yields added seven basis points to 1.52 percent. The S&P GSCI
gauge of commodities added 0.6 percent as oil snapped a four-day
slump. Italian and Spanish bonds rose and the euro strengthened
for a second day as European leaders agreed to discuss closer
banking cooperation.  The  S&P 500  rebounded today after slumping as much as 0.9
percent and extending its tumble since April 2 to more than 10
percent, a level that would have marked a “correction” had it
held on a closing basis. The early slide was triggered when
Commerce Department data showed U.S. factory bookings
unexpectedly slid 0.6 percent in April in the first back-to-back
declines in more than three years.  “It’s a function of things having gotten oversold and due
for a rally at some point,” said  Michael James , a managing
director at Wedbush Securities Inc. in  Los Angeles .  Telephone, consumer-discretionary and technology companies
rose at least 0.5 percent to lead gains in the 10 main industry
groups in the S&P 500, while industrial, financial and energy
companies fell.  Market Leaders  Home Depot Inc., Alcoa Inc. and Johnson & Johnson rose at
least 0.9 percent to lead gains in the  Dow Jones Industrial
Average  as the 30-stock gauge trimmed a drop of as much as 83.48
points to 17.11 points by the close, ending at 12,101.46.  JPMorgan Chase & Co., the largest  U.S. bank  by assets, slid
2.9 percent to $31, the lowest price since Dec. 19. Facebook
Inc. declined 3 percent to $26.90, the social network’s lowest
closing price since the stock started trading on May 18.
Chesapeake Energy Corp. rallied 6 percent on plans to replace
almost half its board under pressure from billionaire investor
 Carl Icahn .  A report last week showing the weakest U.S. hiring in 12
months erased the Dow’s advance for 2012 and pushed valuations
in the S&P 500 to 19 percent below last year’s level.  The increase in the American  jobless rate  to 8.2 percent in
May compounded signs that the economic recovery is stalling and
sent the benchmark gauge for U.S. equities down 2.5 percent to
1,278.04 on June 1, almost 37 points below its level a year
earlier.  Potential Bear  An intensifying financial crisis in Spain or elsewhere in
 Europe  has the potential to drive American stocks into a bear
market, Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s chief U.S. equity strategist
said. While  David Kostin ’s mid-year forecast for the S&P 500
calls for a 3.7 percent gain to 1,325, the measure may fall to
1,125 should the situation in Europe worsen. That would give the
S&P 500 a more-than 20 percent loss since its 2012 closing peak
of 1,419.04 on April 2, reaching what’s considered the threshold
of a bear market.  Treasuries fell for the first time in four days on
speculation the  U.S. economy  won’t slow enough to justify
keeping yields at the record lows set last week.  Valuation measures show Treasuries are at almost the most
expensive levels ever. The term premium, a model created by
economists at the  Federal Reserve , was at negative 0.86 percent
after closing June 1 at negative 0.94 percent. A negative
reading indicates investors are willing to accept yields below
what’s considered fair value.  European Shares  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index slipped 0.5 percent, resuming
losses following the U.S. factory data after  earlier recovering 
from a 0.7 percent retreat. Carmakers, technology and chemical
companies led declines.  Volkswagen AG and Daimler AG dropped at least 1.9 percent.
Aker Solutions ASA, the Norwegian oil-services company, slumped
to the lowest in four months. Vestas Wind Systems A/S plunged to
a nine-year low after BlackRock Inc. cut its holding in the
company to 4.02 percent.  Germany’s DAX Index slumped 1.2 percent, closing at its
lowest level of the year. The IBEX 35 Index rallied 2.9 percent
in  Spain , rebounding from a nine-year low, as Prime Minister
 Mariano Rajoy ’s call to boost efforts to project the region’s
banks gathered support among European leaders.  Spain’s 10-year government yield lost 12 basis points to
6.41 percent. The similar-maturity  German bund yield  rose four
basis points to 1.21 percent, after the rate fell to a record
1.127 percent on June 1.  Banking Union  Pressure built on German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  to back
new ideas to resolve the debt crisis as Spain urged European
leaders to bolster efforts to protect banks. Rajoy on June 2
added his voice to calls for a more robust “banking union” in
Europe, lending his support for a centralized system to re-
capitalize lenders. France’s new Finance Minister  Pierre Moscovici  said that aid for troubled European banks should come
through the European Stability Mechanism rather than through
governments.  Merkel’s spokesman said that Spain knows where to look for
aid if it’s needed, giving no ground to Rajoy’s pleas.  The U.K., Irish and Greek markets were closed today for
public holidays.  The 17-nation euro added 0.5 percent to $1.2494 after last
week sliding to the weakest level in almost two years.  Oil rose for the first time in five days, climbing 0.9
percent to $83.98 a barrel in  New York , as a weaker dollar
helped boost commodities.  Dollar Slips  The Dollar Index, a gauge of the currency against six major
peers, slipped 0.4 percent to 82.55 after last week touching the
highest level since September 2010. The U.S. currency weakened
against 12 of 16 most-traded counterparts.  Japanese and Chinese equity gauges slid into bear markets
as  China ’s non-manufacturing industries expanded at a slower
pace for a second month. Japan’s Topix Index fell 1.9 percent to
the lowest since 1983 and the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index
slid 2.6 percent.  The MSCI  Emerging Markets  Index slid 1.3 percent, falling
to the lowest level since Nov. 25 as benchmark gauges in China,
 South Korea  and Taiwan declined at least 2.7 percent to lead
losses.  “It’s very easy just to get depressed,”  Frances Hudson ,
global thematic strategist who helps manage $256.6 billion at
Standard Life Investments in Edinburgh, said in a phone
interview. “We’ve been having mixed data signals. If your time
horizon is longer, you’re in a better position to work these
things out. Then, you can step back from the noises today.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
