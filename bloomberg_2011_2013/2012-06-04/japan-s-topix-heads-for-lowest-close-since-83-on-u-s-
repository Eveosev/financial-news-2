Japan’s  Topix Index (TPX)  plunged to the
lowest level since 1983 and entered a  bear market , after
disappointing U.S. jobs and  China  services data added to
evidence the global economy is slowing.  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  dropped 3.5 percent after reporting
lower-than-estimated U.S. sales.  Sony Corp. (6758) , Japan’s No. 1
exporter of consumer electronics, fell below 1,000 yen for the
first time since 1980, when the company introduced its iconic
Walkman in the U.S.  Hitachi Construction Machinery Co. (6305) , which
depends on China for 17 percent of its sales, fell 3.9 percent
after a report suggested growth in China is slowing.  Nippon
Yusen K.K. (9101)  led shippers lower after a measure of cargo rates
dropped.  The Topix slid 1.9 percent to 695.51 at the 3 p.m. close of
trading in  Tokyo , the lowest since Dec. 13, 1983 and below
levels last seen since the global financial crisis following the
2008 collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. About six stocks
fell for each that rose on the measure. The  Nikkei 225 Stock
Average (NKY)  dropped 1.7 percent to 8,295.63, erasing its gains for
the year.  “This is a panic selloff,” said Koichi Kurose, chief
economist at Resona Bank Ltd., Japan’s fifth-largest lender by
market value. “Action from policy makers is the only thing that
will calm the market. The market is pricing in a deterioration
in the U.S. economy through summer.”  The Topix has fallen more than 20 percent since March 27
amid a deepening debt crisis in Europe and slowing growth in
China. A decline of that size from the year’s peak signals the
start of a bear market and compares with a 9.5 percent drop on
the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  and a 12 percent slide for the
 Stoxx Europe 600. (SXXP)   Topix Valuations Drop  The Topix declined for a ninth consecutive week as of June
1, the longest losing streak since 1975. The drop has cut the 
value  of shares on the gauge to a record-low 0.82 times book
value, according to data compiled by Bloomberg going back to
1993.  Brokerages, steelmakers and insurance companies were the
worst performers among the Topix’s 33 industry groups since
March 27.  Renesas Electronics Corp. (6723)  lost 54 percent, the worst
performer on the gauge. The chipmaker was followed by  Ulvac Inc. (6728) ,
a maker of vacuum devices, which plunged 49 percent.  The  Nikkei 225 Volatility Index (VNKY)  rose 12 percent to 30.93,
the highest since November, indicating traders expect a swing of
about 9 percent on the benchmark gauge over the next 30 days.  Futures on the  S&P 500  lost 0.6 percent today. The index
slumped 2.5 percent in New York on June 1 after U.S. employers
added fewer jobs than expected and the  unemployment rate  rose to
8.2 percent. A gauge tracking manufacturing fell to its lowest
in 10 months.  ‘Double Whammy’  The employment data “raised a question mark about the view
that the  U.S. economy  is stabilizing,” said  Soichiro Monji ,
chief strategist at Tokyo-based Daiwa SB Investments Ltd., which
manages the equivalent of about $64 billion. “Expectations for
further monetary easing in the U.S. may push down the dollar-yen
 exchange rate . These factors could be a double whammy for
Japanese equities.”  Toyota and Honda Motor Co. led five of the six largest
automakers in reporting U.S. sales that trailed estimates in May
as slumping job growth limited a rebound from last year’s
earthquake and tsunami. Toyota lost 3.5 percent to 2,904 yen,
while Honda declined 3.7 percent to 2,368 yen.  Japanese exporters fell after the yen on June 1 touched the
highest level against the dollar since Feb. 14, when the  Bank of
Japan  surprised the market by setting an inflation target and
expanding its asset-purchase program. Subsequent monetary easing
has failed to weaken the yen and boost shares.  Finance Minister Jun Azumi today said Japanese equity
prices do not reflect economic conditions, while Bank of Japan
Governor Masaaki Shirakawa said the central bank is carefully
watching how the yen’s advance has been affecting the nation.  Sony Drops  Sony slumped 1.7 percent to 996 yen after falling to as low
as 990 yen.  Canon Inc. (7751) , the world’s biggest camera maker, lost
5.2 percent to 2,893 yen.  China’s non-manufacturing industries fell to 55.2 in May
from 56.1 in April, the slowest pace in more than a year, the
government said yesterday, amid declining export orders and
weakness in real estate. China’s purchasing managers’ index slid
to 50.4 from 53.3 in April, the statistics bureau and logistics
federation said June 1.  Companies that do business in China fell. Hitachi
Construction Machinery fell 3.9 percent 1,392 yen. Trading
company  Emori & Co. (9963) , which depends on China for 41 percent of
its sales, dropped 1.2 percent to 902 yen.  Shipping lines slid after the  Baltic Dry Index (BDIY) , a measure
of shipping costs for commodities, dropped 2.1 percent. Nippon
Yusen, Japan’s biggest shipping line by sales, fell 3 percent to
193 yen.  Mitsui O.S.K. Lines Ltd. (9104) , ranked second in the sector,
fell 5.3 percent to 249 yen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
