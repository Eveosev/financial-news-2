Ecuador’s President  Rafael Correa

Organization of American States at the group’s annual meeting
today, Bolivian state media Patria Nueva reported.  The OAS must “reinvent itself or die,” Correa said,
according to the website.  At the June 3 inauguration of the meeting in Tiquipaya,
Bolivia, President Morales said the OAS serves the interests of
the U.S. to the exclusion of other nations, Patria Nueva
