The Finnish government increased its
popularity last month, according to a poll commissioned by
newspaper  Helsingin Sanomat .  About 38 percent of Finns said the government has succeeded
in its work, an increase from 24 percent in September, the
Helsinki-based newspaper said, citing the poll by TNS Gallup Oy.
The number of people who thought the government’s performance
was neither good nor bad fell to 39 percent from 47 percent.
About 19 percent disapproved of the government’s work, compared
with 24 percent in the prior poll.  The poll had a margin of error of about 3 percentage
points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
