Solarworld AG (SWV) ,  Germany ’s biggest
solar-panel maker, expects an anti-dumping case to start against
Chinese competitors in  Europe  this month after the German
government said it may support such a move.  While Solarworld hasn’t filed a complaint with the European
Commission, individual European Union member states or the
commission itself could initiate proceedings, Solarworld Chief
Executive Officer Frank Asbeck said today.  “I’m confident that one of the three options will be taken
this half,” Asbeck said by telephone, referring to the period
through June. “We then expect timely proceedings so that we
could see first results in the spring.”  The comments highlight growing tensions between European
and U.S. governments and the Chinese state over its aid for
renewable-energy companies. Solarworld said in May it wanted to
bring an antidumping complaint in Europe after action in the
U.S. led to the imposition of duties on shipments from  China .  Germany may initiate proceedings, the WirtschaftsWoche
magazine said yesterday, citing an interview with Environment
Minister Peter Altmaier. At least five domestic solar companies,
including  Q-Cells SE (QCE) , have filed for insolvency since December
after a glut of Chinese products flooded the global market.  The U.S. Commerce Department on May 17 imposed preliminary
antidumping duties of 31 percent to 250 percent on Chinese solar
manufacturers after ruling they sold products below cost. The
decision followed complaints from the industry led by
Solarworld’s U.S. unit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
