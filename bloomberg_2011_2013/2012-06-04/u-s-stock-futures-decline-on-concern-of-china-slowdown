U.S. stocks reversed losses as the
cheapest price-to-earnings valuation for the Standard & Poor’s
500 Index in six months overshadowed a drop in factory orders.  Amazon.com Inc. and  Starbucks Corp. (SBUX)  advanced at least 3
percent to pace gains in consumer discretionary companies.
 Chesapeake Energy Corp. (CHK)  rallied 6 percent on plans to replace
almost half its board under pressure from billionaire investor
 Carl Icahn . Caterpillar Inc. and  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  retreated
more than 2.6 percent.  Facebook Inc. (FB)  declined 3 percent to the
lowest price since the stock began trading at $38 last month.  The S&P 500 rose less than 0.1 percent to 1,278.18 at 4
p.m. New York time, after dropping as much as 0.9 percent. The
 Dow Jones Industrial Average  retreated 17.11 points, 0.1
percent, to 12,101.46. About  7.1 billion  shares changed hands on
U.S. exchanges, or 5 percent above the three-month average.  “It’s very easy to get depressed,” said  Frances Hudson ,
global thematic strategist who helps manage $256.6 billion at
Standard Life Investments in Edinburgh. She spoke in a phone
interview. “We’ve been having mixed data signals. If your time
horizon is longer, you’re in a better position to work these
things out. Then you can step back from the noises.”  The  S&P 500  started the session trading at  12.9 times  its
companies’ reported earnings, the lowest valuation since
November. It dropped 9.9 percent from a four-year high on April
2 through last week amid concern Europe’s debt crisis was
worsening and global economic growth was slowing.  Earlier losses in U.S. stocks today extended the S&P 500’s
drop from its peak to more than 10 percent as government data
showed factory orders fell 0.6 percent in April, pointing to a
deceleration in manufacturing. China’s non-manufacturing
industries expanded at the slowest pace in more than a year.  ‘Oversold’ Market  “It’s a function of things having gotten oversold and due
for a rally at some point,” said  Michael James , a managing
director at Wedbush Securities Inc. in Los Angeles.  Seven out of  10 groups  in the S&P 500 advanced as phone,
consumer discretionary and technology shares had the biggest
gains. Amazon.com, the world’s largest Internet retailer, jumped
3.1 percent to $214.57. Starbucks, the world’s largest coffee-
shop chain, added 3.4 percent to $53.90.  Chesapeake Energy rallied 6 percent to $16.52. Four of the
company’s eight non-executive directors will be replaced with
nominees of the largest shareholders, Southeastern Asset
Management Inc. and Icahn. Icahn triggered the overhaul by
acquiring a 7.6 percent stake last month to rein in what he saw
as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Aubrey McClendon’s risk-
taking and overspending that led to a $22 billion cash crunch
and eroded the share price.  Bear Market  An intensifying financial crisis in Spain or elsewhere in
 Europe  has the potential to drive U.S. stocks into a bear
market, Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s chief U.S. equity strategist
said. While David Kostin’s mid-year forecast for the S&P 500
calls for a 3.7 percent gain from last week’s close to 1,325,
the measure may fall to 1,125 should the situation in Europe
worsen. That would give the S&P 500 a more-than 20 percent loss
since its 2012 closing peak of 1,419.04.  The June 1 report from Goldman Sachs said the most likely
scenario is Greek elections resulting in the nation remaining in
the  euro zone . Concern it will leave has helped drag the S&P 500
down since April 2, including the biggest  monthly  decline since
September. “Financial contagion or crisis in Spain” could
prompt a bear market, according to the report.  Caterpillar (CAT) , the largest maker of construction and mining
equipment, dropped 2.6 percent to $83.26. JPMorgan fell 2.9
percent to $31.  Morgan Stanley (MS)  tumbled 2.9 percent to $12.36,
the lowest since 2008.  Facebook Slumps  Facebook slumped 3 percent to $26.90 and went as low as
$26.44, after tumbling 13 percent last week. The world’s biggest
social network dropped after Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.
initiated coverage with an underperform rating and a $25 share-
price estimate.  “It is difficult to argue for owning the stock today,”
said Carlos Kirjner, an analyst at Bernstein in New York, in a
research report today.  The  Bloomberg U.S. Airlines Index (BUSAIRL)  tumbled 7.5 percent as
 Delta Air Lines Inc. (DAL)  sank 12 percent to $10.18. The company
missed a revenue projection as competitors cut fares just before
the start of the peak season for U.S. vacation travel.  Regions Financial Corp. (RF)  slid 5.6 percent to $5.55, the
lowest since February. The Birmingham, Alabama-based bank was
downgraded to  hold  from buy at Deutsche Bank AG on June 1. The
12-month share-price estimate is $6.50 per share.  To contact the reporter on this story:
