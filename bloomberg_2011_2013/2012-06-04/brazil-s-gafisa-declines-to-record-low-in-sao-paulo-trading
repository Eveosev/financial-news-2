Gafisa SA (GFSA3) , the Brazilian homebuilder
that has posted worse-than-expected earnings for six straight
quarters, led declines in Sao Paulo on a report that it is
having trouble raising the cash to complete the acquisition of
its Alphaville unit.  Shares dropped 5.4 percent to 2.27 reais at the close in
Sao Paulo, the worst performance on the benchmark  Bovespa index ,
which was little changed. The BM&FBovespa Real Estate Index
declined 0.8 percent.  Gafisa bought 60 percent of Alphaville, which focuses on
the high-income market, in 2006 with an option to acquire 20
percent more in 2010 and the remaining 20 percent this year. The
company said in a June 1 filing it had begun the process to
complete the transaction. Valor Economico reported today that
Gafisa is facing difficulty raising the needed 368.7 million
reais ($179.3 million) and is seeking alternatives, including a
spinoff. The newspaper didn’t say where it got the information.  “Alphaville is one of the only units of Gafisa showing
good results lately,” Ana Rayes, an analyst at equity research
firm Lopes Filho & Associados, said by phone from  Rio de
Janeiro . “It would have a negative impact for Gafisa not to
complete the acquisition.”  The company also is considering finding a strategic partner
for the business, Valor reported.  Gafisa’s press office declined to comment on the report
when contacted by Bloomberg News.  The homebuilder’s shares lost 45 percent  this year ,
compared with the benchmark’s 5.9 percent decline.  To contact the reporter on this story:
