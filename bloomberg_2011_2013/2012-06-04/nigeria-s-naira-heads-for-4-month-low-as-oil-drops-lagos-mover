Nigeria ’s naira fell for a second day
against the dollar, heading for the lowest in more than four
months, as crude prices declined and foreign investors were said
to sell naira debt.  The currency of  Africa ’s biggest oil producer retreated 0.4
percent to 161.2325 per dollar as of 11:06 a.m. in Lagos, the
commercial capital, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
That would be the lowest since Jan. 30 on a closing basis.  Oil fell for a fifth day in  New York  to the lowest price in
almost eight months on signs of an economic slowdown in the U.S.
and  China . Emerging-market stocks fell, dragging the  benchmark 
index to a six-month low.  “The sharp drop in the oil price and foreign investor
demand for the greenback amid reports they are cutting long T-
bill positions have contributed to the weakness,”  Leon Myburgh 
and Coura Fall, Africa strategists at Citigroup Inc. in
Johannesburg, wrote in an e-mailed note to clients today.  The yield on Nigeria’s domestic bonds due 2018 rose six
basis points to 15.53 percent, according to the June 1 data on
the Financial Markets Dealers Association website. Yields on the
nation’s $500 million of Eurobonds due 2021 gained two basis
points to 5.782 percent.  Ghana’s cedi depreciated less than 0.1 percent to 1.893 per
dollar, in Accra, the capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
