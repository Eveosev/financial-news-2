Tobacco farmers in  Zimbabwe  earned
$362 million from sale of the leaves so far this year, the
Tobacco Marketing and Industry Board said.  The average price jumped 36 percent to $3.76 per kilogram
(2.2 pounds) in the period from Feb. 15 to May 25, compared with
the same period a year earlier, the state-run regulator said in
an e-mailed statement today from Harare, the capital.  Zimbabwe, which sells tobacco that vies for quality with
the U.S. crop, has sold 96.3 million kilograms of mainly flue-
cured Virginia tobacco this year, the marketing body said,
without giving a comparative figure.  Zimbabweâ€™s growers sell tobacco on auction and through
contracts with merchants.  To contact the reporters on this story:
