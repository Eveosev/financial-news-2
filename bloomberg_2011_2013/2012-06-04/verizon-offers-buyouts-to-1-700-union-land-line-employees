Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) , the
second-largest U.S. phone company, offered exit packages to
1,700 technicians and call-center workers, a move that may lead
to hundreds of job cuts if enough employees don’t volunteer.  The buyouts are being offered to workers in 12 states and
 Washington , D.C., where Verizon operates its land-line network.
The company, with a total of about 192,000  employees , has been
negotiating with its unions to lower costs for the past year.
Verizon has warned that the latest move will result in 600
layoffs, according to the International Brotherhood of
Electrical Workers, which represents the employees.  “Layoffs are a tool of absolute last resort,” Rich Young,
a spokesman for New York-based Verizon. “The reality is, the
business has changed and we are adjusting our head count to meet
those changes.”  Verizon’s land-line revenue fell 1.3 percent last year,
hurt by the sluggish economy and growing competition from cable
companies and wireless operators. Still, the union has
 criticized  the company for increasing executive pay while
contract talks are deadlocked.  “Verizon is putting big paydays for its top executives
above building a world-class telecommunications
infrastructure,” Myles Calvey, a Boston IBEW representative,
said today in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
