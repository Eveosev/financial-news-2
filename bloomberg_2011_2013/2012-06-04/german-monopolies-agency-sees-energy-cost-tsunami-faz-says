The head of  Germany ’s Monopolies
Commission, Justus Haucap, said he fears a “cost-tsunami” for
electricity customers as Germany switches to wind and solar
power,  Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung  reported, citing Haucap.  It is not “unrealistic” that prices may increase to more
than 5 eurocents per kilowatt-hour, Haucap said, according to a
preview of an article that will be published tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
