Deutsche Lufthansa AG (LHA)  Chief Executive
Officer Christoph Franz said holding passenger capacity at a
steady level cannot be a long-term goal for the airline after it
scrapped plans to grow capacity by 12 percent this year,
 Boersen-Zeitung  reported, citing an interview with Franz.  Industry consolidation will continue and the worldâ€™s large
airlines, including Lufthansa, will get bigger, Franz said,
according to a preview of a story that will run tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
