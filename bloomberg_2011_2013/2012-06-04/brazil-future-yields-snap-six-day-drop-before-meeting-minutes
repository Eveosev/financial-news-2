Yields on interest-rate futures
contracts were unchanged, snapping six days of declines, on
speculation minutes from last week’s central bank policy meeting
will indicate that the pace of reductions in borrowing costs
will slow.  Yields on the interest-rate futures contract due in January
2014 held at 8.23 percent at 10:12 a.m. in  Sao Paulo  after
earlier rising as much as seven basis points, or 0.07 percentage
point, to 8.30 percent. The central bank is scheduled to release
minutes from last week’s rate decision on June 8.  “The central bank could show in the minutes that the idea
isn’t to cut  interest rates  more deeply for now,” said Luis
Otavio De Souza Leal, chief economist at Banco ABC Brasil SA, in
a phone interview from Sao Paulo.  The real appreciated 0.2 percent to 2.0369 per  U.S. dollar .  To contact the reporters on this story:
