Support for Germany’s Pirate Party
fell one percentage point to 7 percent as German Chancellor
Angela Merkel’s governing Christian Democratic bloc gained one
percentage point to 34 percent, according to a weekly poll.  The  Social Democratic Party  would attract 32 percent of
votes if national elections were held today, the survey by INSA-
Meinungstrend for Germany’s Bild newspaper showed.  Support for the  Green Party  and the Free Democrats would be
14 percent and 5 percent, respectively, the newspaper said
today. The Left Party would get 4 percent if an election was
held today, Bild said.  INSA surveyed 2,019 people from June 1 to June 4. No margin
of error was provided.  To contact the reporter on this story:
