Open interest in  India ’s S&P CNX
Nifty Index futures declined to a five-year low as investors
held off taking new bets after government data showed Asia’s
third-biggest economy is slowing.  Open interest, or the number of contracts outstanding, in
the Nifty futures on the National Stock Exchange of India Ltd.
totaled 321,725 on June 1, the lowest since Feb. 2, 2007, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. It was at 338,313 yesterday. The
index rose 0.5 percent to 4,869.85 at 9:38 a.m. in Mumbai.  A private survey showed on June 1 that manufacturing in
India slowed, a day after the government said  economic growth 
slowed to a nine-year low in the March quarter. Foreign funds
turned net sellers of domestic shares for a second month in May,
reducing their holdings by $273 million, data from the market
regulator show.  “Weak economic conditions are weighing on sentiment and
affecting investments in stocks,” Siddarth Bhamre, head of
derivatives at Angel Broking Ltd., said by phone from Mumbai.
“Investors are scared to take longer-term bets.”  The value of index futures contracts held by  foreign
investors  was 67.54 billion rupees ($1.2 billion) on May 31, the
lowest level since February 2009, the data show. It was at 78
billion rupees yesterday.  ‘Staring at Losses’  The 50-stock Nifty index fell 13 percent from its Feb. 21
peak as the rupee fell 6 percent versus the dollar last month,
 Asia ’s worst-performing currency.  India’s record trade deficit “has weakened our balance of
payments and the rupee is beginning to fall, as a consequence of
which overseas investors are staring at losses and pulling
out,” P. Jayendra Nayak, chief executive officer of  Morgan
Stanley (MS)  India, told Bloomberg UTV yesterday. The withdrawals
weaken the currency further and “it is important that we have a
policy that gets us out of these vicious cycle,” he said.  The total derivatives  turnover  on the National exchange
totaled 798 billion rupees on June 1, the lowest level since May
14, and reached 815 billion rupees yesterday, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  The Nifty has climbed 5.3 percent this year and  trades  at
12 times estimated profits, the lowest level in more than three
years. That  compares with  a multiple of 9.7 times for the MSCI
 Emerging Markets  Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
