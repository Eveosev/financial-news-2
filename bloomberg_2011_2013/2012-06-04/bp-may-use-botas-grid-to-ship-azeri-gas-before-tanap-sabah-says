A BP Plc-led group may use Botas’s
pipelines to export natural gas to  Europe  from the Shah Deniz
field in the Caspian Sea off  Azerbaijan  if the planned Trans-
Anatolia link across Turkey is delayed, Sabah said today, citing
BP Turkey chief Bud Fackrell.  Turkey may upgrade state-run Botas’ network to deliver Shah
Deniz gas if the pipeline known as Tanap is not built on time,
Sabah said, citing Fackrell. Talks between Turkey and Azerbaijan
on construction of Tanap are going well, Fackrell said,
according to the Turkish daily.  State Oil Co. of Azerbaijan, or Socar, said last month that
an agreement on the 2,000-kilometer (1,240-mile) Tanap link is
planned by June 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
