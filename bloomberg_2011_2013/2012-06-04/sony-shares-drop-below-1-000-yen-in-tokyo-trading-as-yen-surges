Sony Corp. (6758)  dropped below 1,000 yen in
 Tokyo  trading for the first time since 1980, when the Walkman
was new, after Japan’s  currency gained  and the U.S. added jobs
at a slower-than-estimated pace.  The shares  fell  1.7 percent to close at 996 yen on the
Tokyo Stock Exchange. Sony, which recorded an all-time intraday
high of 16,950 yen in March 2000, last closed below 1,000 yen on
Aug. 1, 1980, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Sony, a trendsetter with the portable cassette player,
video camera and first compact-disc player, posted four straight
 annual losses  as it failed to develop more hit products, the yen
surged and consumers flocked to devices from Apple Inc. and
Samsung Electronics Co. A turnaround plan by new Chief Executive
Officer  Kazuo Hirai  has failed to stem a decline that has the
company predicting a ninth year of losses as its TV unit.  “Investors’ concern about Sony’s poor earnings seems to be
turning into conviction,” said  Takashi Watanabe , an analyst at
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. “Even as Sony makes progress in
reforming its TV operation, its plans for games and smartphones
look optimistic.”  Sony, Japan’s biggest exporter of consumer electronics,
extended a 28 percent drop this year amid concerns the U.S.
recovery is faltering while growth slows in  China  and  Europe ’s
debt crisis worsens. U.S. payrolls climbed by 69,000 last month,
less than the most-pessimistic forecast in a Bloomberg News
survey, Labor Department figures showed June 1 in  Washington .  Yen’s Surge  Japan ’s currency reached 95.60 against the euro last week,
the strongest since Nov. 30, 2000, and touched 77.66 against the
 U.S. dollar  on June 1, the highest since Feb. 14. Sony loses 6
billion yen of annual operating profit and 10 billion yen of
sales for every 1 yen decline in the value of the euro,
according to Mami Imada, a Sony spokeswoman. A 1-yen decline by
the U.S. dollar hurts sales by 50 billion yen, Imada said.  “The yen is significantly stronger than it was a few
months ago, when Sony disclosed its turnaround plan,” said
Keita Wakabayashi, a Tokyo-based analyst at Mito Securities Co.
“If the yen stays as it is, Sony’s reform may get delayed.”  The company is basing its full-year earnings forecasts on
exchange rates of 105 yen to the euro and 80 yen to the dollar.  Hirai has presided over a 42 percent decline in Sony’s
market value since taking over April 1. The 51-year-old
succeeded  Howard Stringer  after the maker of Bravia TVs posted a
record loss last fiscal year, when Japan’s strongest earthquake
and floods in  Thailand  crippled plants, and attacks by hackers
disrupted Sony’s online entertainment network.  Record Loss  Sony  posted  a record 457 billion-yen loss ($5.9 billion) in
the year ended March. Its TV business continued losing money
amid falling prices and competition from South Korea’s Samsung
and LG Electronics Inc.  Worth $125 billion in March 2000, Sony is now valued at
less than $13 billion. Cupertino, California-based  Apple Inc. (005930)  is
valued at $525 billion and Suwon, South Korea-based Samsung
Electronics Co. at $150 billion.  Sony’s domestic competitors Panasonic Corp., Sharp Corp.
and Toshiba Corp. all trade below 1,000 yen.  The declines are symbolic of how Japan’s consumer
electronics industry has lost its added value, said Einosuke Yoshino, a  fund manager  at Commons Asset Management in Tokyo.  “It’s just the result of what Sony has been doing over the
past 10 years,” Yoshino said.  Credit Downgrades  Standard & Poor’s cut Sony’s long-term  credit rating  one
level in February to BBB+, the third-lowest investment grade,
with a negative outlook, citing “a massive erosion of prices”
and “severe competition.” The announcement followed downgrades
by Moody’s Investors Service and Fitch Ratings.  Sony’s liabilities totaled 10.8 trillion yen as of March
31, 8 percent higher than a year earlier, while its total equity
dropped 15 percent to 2.5 trillion yen during the year, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  Hirai has promised to reform Sony by cutting 10,000 jobs,
selling a chemical unit and streamlining TV operations. He said
he’ll consider alliances for the company’s battery unit. The
CEO, who earned a reputation for turning around the PlayStation
game unit, is counting on digital cameras, games and mobile
gadgets to help drive a revival, he said April 12.  First CD Player  Founded in Tokyo in 1946 by  Akio Morita  and Masaru Ibuka,
Sony created Japan’s first transistor radio and the world’s
first CD player. The inventor of the Trinitron cathode-ray tube
TV won admirers including Apple founder  Steve Jobs .  Sony shares were traded at 850 yen in July 1979, when the
company introduced the Walkman. The stock rose to 1,691 yen in
October 1982, when Sony started offering the first CD player,
and to 3,477 yen when it introduced Handycam video recorders in
1989.  The stock slid to the lowest since August 1980 on May 12
after forecasting earnings that missed analyst estimates.  The company  projected  net income may total 30 billion yen
in the year started April 1, the company said in May. That
compared with the 61.4 billion-yen average of 18  analyst
estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  The world’s No. 3 TV maker said it may lose about 80
billion yen selling models as it predicted sales will decline 11
percent to 17.5 million units. Sony plans to make the business
profitable by March 2014.  Global TV shipments fell for the first time since 2004 last
year, according to DisplaySearch, part of NPD Group. Flat-screen
TV shipments in the U.S. may fall for the first time this year,
to 37.1 million units from 39.1 million the year before,
according to IHS Inc.’s iSuppli.  TV Sales  Sony still forecasts revenue to rise 14 percent to 7.4
trillion yen this fiscal year, helped by smartphones and
portable game players. Smartphone sales may rise to 33.3 million
units from 22.5 million and handheld game players including
PlayStation Vita may more than double to 16 million units from
6.8 million, the company said May 10.  In an attempt to catch up with Samsung, Apple and  Research
In Motion Ltd. (RIM)  in the expanding smartphone market, Sony bought
out partner Ericsson AB’s stake in their mobile-phone
partnership last year.  Sony had a 4.2 percent share of the smartphone market last
year, lagging behind rivals including  Nokia Oyj (NOK1V) , HTC Corp., and
Research In Motion, according to researcher Gartner Inc. Apple
topped the ranking with a 18.9 percent market share, followed by
Samsung, controlling 18.5 percent.  The maker of Vaio personal computers unveiled its first
tablet computers in 2011, the last among the global top 10
laptop makers to introduce tablets after Apple’s iPad spurred a
surge in demand for the devices.  Smartphones  Hirai’s reform plans add to Sony’s four restructuring plans
since 1999, which eliminated 66,500 jobs, according to Keita
Sanekata, a spokesman for the company. The company had 168,200
employees as of March 2011, down from 189,700 in 2000, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  “Sony is in a vicious circle,” said Hideki Yasuda, an
analyst at Ace Securities Co. in Tokyo. “It needs to cut people
in order to improve its profitability, but if it does, people
with skills will leave the company. Sony’s lost its ability to
create excellent products.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
