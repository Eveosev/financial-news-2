JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) , the largest
U.S. bank, may report a $4.2 billion second-quarter trading loss
in its chief investment office, according to an estimate by
International Strategy & Investment Group Inc.  The pretax loss would help cut second-quarter earnings to
65 cents a share, a 30 percent decline from an earlier estimate
of 93 cents, Ed Najarian, an ISI analyst, said in a note
yesterday. Weaker-than-expected trading and investment banking
revenue coupled with mark-to-market private-equity losses will
also weigh on results, Najarian said.  JPMorgan Chief Executive Officer  Jamie Dimon , 56, said last
month the firm lost about $2 billion on trades conducted at its
CIO unit, which is charged with managing the bank’s idle cash to
earn a profit while minimizing risk. Dimon has said losses could
grow and it might take the rest of the year to liquidate the New
York-based lender’s trades.  The loss will be “partially offset” by $2 billion in
realized security gains, stronger mortgage-banking revenue and
so-called debt-valuation adjustments, Najarian wrote. Excluding
the trading losses, DVA and securities gains, Najarian estimates
second quarter operating earnings per share of 82 cents.  Najarian cut his 12-month price target to $47 a share, from
$52, and kept a rating of “buy” on the stock. JPMorgan fell
2.9 percent yesterday to $31 and is down 6.8 percent this year.
