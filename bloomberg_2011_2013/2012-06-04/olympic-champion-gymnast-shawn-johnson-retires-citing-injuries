U.S. gymnast Shawn Johnson, who won
four medals at the 2008 Olympics in Beijing, retired because of
recurring knee injuries, ending her attempt to qualify for this
year’s  London  games.  “I still have the heart, drive, and desire to compete and
help the USA at the London Olympics,” Johnson, 20, said in a
statement through USA Gymnastics. “Unfortunately, it has become
obvious that my left knee is not able to sustain the demands of
gymnastics any longer.”  Johnson helped the U.S. to an Olympic silver medal in the
team competition in Beijing and also added silvers in the all-
around event and the floor exercise. On the final day of the
gymnastics competition, she won a gold medal in the balance
beam, joining Shannon Miller in 1996 as the second U.S. woman to
do so. Johnson took a two-year hiatus from gymnastics after the
2008 Games before returning to competition.  Her retirement comes ahead of the U.S. team’s Olympic
selection camp.  “I am announcing this now so the focus for the next three
weeks will be on the incredibly talented gymnasts who are trying
to make our 2012 Olympic team,” said Johnson, who also won
three gold medals at the 2007 World Championships.  Johnson, who will still travel to London during the July
27-Aug. 12 Olympics on behalf of some of her sponsors, said that
her future plans include college, volunteer work and a continued
involvement in gymnastics.  To contact the reporter on this story:
