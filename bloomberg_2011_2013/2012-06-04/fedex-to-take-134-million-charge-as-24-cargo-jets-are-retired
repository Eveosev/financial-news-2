FedEx Corp. (FDX)  retired 24 jets to cut
capacity in the U.S. domestic Express  division  as a slowing
economy saps shipping volumes for the operator of the world’s
largest cargo airline.  Taking the  Airbus SAS (EAD)  and  Boeing Co. (BA)  freighters out of
service added to five jets grounded last quarter and planned
retirements of 21 more in FedEx’s 2013 fiscal year. FedEx is
seeking to reduce costs in the U.S. part of the Express unit,
which includes moving packages by air.  “The domestic Express market is the most challenged from a
volume standpoint in the FedEx portfolio,” said  David Ross , a
Stifel Nicolaus & Co. analyst in Baltimore. FedEx needs to
shrink “the domestic Express network to kind of match what we
see as kind of lower long-term volumes.”  The move resulted in a non-cash impairment charge of 26
cents a share in the quarter that ended May 31,  Memphis ,
Tennessee-based FedEx said yesterday in a statement.  “Along with the decisions to retire these 50 aircraft, we
are also developing detailed operating and cost structure plans
to further improve our efficiency,” Express Chief Executive
Officer David Bronczek said in the statement. “We expect to
provide additional information on these plans in the fall.”  FedEx said in the same statement that it was raising its
quarterly  dividend  7.7 percent to 14 cents a share, payable July
2 to shareholders of record as of June 18.  Quarterly Volumes  Average daily package volume in FedEx’s domestic Express
business dropped 4 percent in the fiscal third quarter.
Operating margins in the Express unit have failed to recover to
pre-recession levels even as revenue in the last fiscal year
reached the highest in at least a decade.  Ross, who  rates FedEx shares  a buy, said he doesn’t expect
growth in domestic volumes for “the next several years.”  Orders to U.S. factories unexpectedly fell in April for a
second month, pointing to a deceleration in manufacturing, the
Commerce Department said yesterday. That followed the May 31
report that U.S. gross domestic product grew at a 1.9 percent
annual rate in the first quarter, down from a prior 2.2 percent
estimate.  The Express division is FedEx’s largest. The company’s
other businesses include a ground package-delivery unit and
FedEx Freight, a so-called less-than-truckload carrier that
moves goods from more than one customer in each trailer.  FedEx fell 0.1 percent to $85.20 at the close in  New York ,
before the company’s announcement about the freighters and the
dividend increase. The shares rose 2 percent this year through
yesterday.  Retired Freighters  The planes affected by the retirement are 18 Airbus 310-200
jets and six Boeing MD-10-10 freighters. The Airbus planes have
two engines and the Boeings have three. Both models are out of
production, and FedEx said most “are currently parked and not
in revenue service.”  The move includes 43  jet engines , FedEx said. The $134
million cost for the retirements was recorded in the quarter
that ended May 31, according to FedEx, which typically reports
 results  from the fourth quarter of its fiscal year in June.  “It’s certainly a positive sign, in our opinion, that
they’re addressing it and that they are kind of lowering the
fleet size,” Ross said in a telephone interview.  FedEx had 688 aircraft as of Feb. 29, including 397 jets,
according to the company’s statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
