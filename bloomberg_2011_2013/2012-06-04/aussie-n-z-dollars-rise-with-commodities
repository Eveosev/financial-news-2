The Australian currency ended a four-
day losing streak against the yen as commodities increased for
the first time in five days.  The Aussie rebounded from a 3.3 percent decline during the
period ended June 1 against the Japanese currency after reaching
its lowest level since November on June 1. Gains were limited
after a survey of economists predicted the  Reserve Bank of
Australia  will cut its benchmark rate today to 3.5 percent from
3.75 percent. The  New Zealand dollar  strengthened for a third
day.  “The Aussie is really just riding on the coattails of the
improvement in risk sentiment,”  Joe Manimbo , a market analyst
in Washington at Western Union Business Solutions, a unit of
 Western Union Co. (WU) , said in a telephone interview. “It’s only a
modest rally that we’ve seen against the dollar, which is on
caution ahead of tomorrow’s RBA meeting. It’s nothing more than
a corrective bounce.”  Australia ’s dollar gained 0.3 percent to 97.28 U.S. cents
at 5 p.m. in  New York  yesterday. The currency traded 0.7 percent
stronger versus the yen at 76.21 yen.  New Zealand’s dollar climbed 0.3 percent to 76.65 U.S.
cents. It rose 0.7 percent to 59.26 yen.  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index of 24 raw materials
increased 0.6 percent after European leaders agreed to discuss
closer banking cooperation in the euro bloc to resolve the
region’s debt crisis.  Futures traders wagered record net  bets  the Australian
dollar will decline against the  U.S. dollar  as concern
intensified that global growth is slowing. The number of so-
called net shorts was 35,527 as of May 29, the most ever in
figures from the Washington-based Commodity Futures Trading
Commission that go back to 1993.  To contact the reporter on this story:
