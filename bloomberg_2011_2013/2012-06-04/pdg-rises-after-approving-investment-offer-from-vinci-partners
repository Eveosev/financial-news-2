PDG Realty SA Empreendimentos e
Participacoes ,  Brazil ’s biggest homebuilder, rose the most in a
week after saying it approved a capital injection of 800 million
reais ($389 million) from shareholder Vinci Partners
Investimentos Ltda.  Shares gained 1.8 percent to 3.33 reais at the close in Sao
Paulo while the BM&FBovespa Real Estate Index slipped 0.8
percent. The benchmark Bovespa index was little changed.  PDG said today in a regulatory filing its board
“understands that a capitalization of the company at this
moment will strongly benefit it” as the homebuilder has the
intention of adopting a more conservative strategy toward a
“possibly adverse scenario for credit and signs of a slowdown
in the Brazilian economy.”  Vinci Partners proposed issuing warrants that may be
convertible into shares and bonds.  PDG has retreated 44 percent this year while the Bovespa
slid 5.9 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
