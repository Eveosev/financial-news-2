Asian stocks  declined for a fourth
day, with Japan’s Topix Index dropping to the lowest level since
1983, and oil fell after the American jobless rate increased
last month, wiping out this year’s gains in the  Dow Jones
Industrial Average . Australian bonds and the  U.S. dollar  rose.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  lost 1.4 percent as of 9:40
a.m. in Tokyo, while the Topix slid 2.2 percent, heading for the
lowest close since Dec. 2, 1983. Australia’s  S&P/ASX 200 Index (AS51) 
retreated 1.6 percent after non-manufacturing industries in
China grew at the slowest pace in a year. Standard & Poor’s 500
Index futures slid 0.7 percent. Oil futures dropped for a fifth
day in New York.  “The poor U.S. payrolls number should start to deflate
investor optimism about U.S. growth that we’ve encountered,
leaving few places for investors to hide,” said Gerard Minack,
a developed-market strategist at Morgan Stanley in Sydney.  U.S. unemployment rose to 8.2 percent in May from 8.1
percent the previous month and payrolls increased by 69,000 last
month, less than the most-pessimistic forecast in a Bloomberg
News survey of economists, Labor Department figures showed on
June 1. The non-manufacturing  purchasing managers’ index  in
 China  fell to 55.2 in May from 56.1 in April, the National
Bureau of Statistics and China Federation of Logistics and
Purchasing said yesterday in Beijing. European leaders remain
divided on solutions for the region’s debt crisis.  The Australian dollar fell 0.5 percent to 96.51 U.S. cents
from its June 1 close in New York. Australia’s bonds climbed,
with three-year yields falling as much as 12 basis points to a
record 1.91 percent.  Oil for July delivery lost as much as 1 percent to $82.44 a
barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile
Exchange. Prices slid $3.30, or 3.8 percent, to $83.23 a barrel
June 1, the lowest close since October.  To contact the reporters on this story:
