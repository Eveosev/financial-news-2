Senegal  is making preparations to try
former Chadian president Hissene Habre, who is charged with the
deaths of more than 40,000 people during his eight-year rule,
the West African nation’s Justice Ministry said.  A working group set up by the ministry and includes members
of the Foreign Affairs Ministry, the prisons system and the
Appeals Court, according to a statement e-mailed today. They met
on June 1 to discuss how to try the ex-leader, who has been in
exile in Senegal since 1990.  The group will “reflect on the practical ways for
preparation and organization of the Hissene Habre process,
conforming to Senegal’s international engagements and with the
help of the African Union,” the ministry said in the statement.
While Senegal agreed in 2006 to try Habre at the urging of the
African Union, he has not yet been brought to court.  To contact the reporter on this story:
