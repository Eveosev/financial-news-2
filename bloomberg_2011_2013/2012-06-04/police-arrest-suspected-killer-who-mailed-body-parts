Berlin police arrested Luka Rocco
Magnotta, the Canadian fugitive accused of killing a  Montreal 
student and mailing his body parts to political party offices.  Magnotta’s identity was confirmed by fingerprint and police
are working to bring him back to  Canada  from  Germany , Ian
Lafreniere, a Montreal police department spokesman, said in a
press conference broadcast on the CTV network today.  The arrest comes five days after Canada’s police sent out a
nationwide warrant for Magnotta, 29, who is also known as Eric
Clinton Newman and Vladimir Romanov, after severed body parts
were mailed to Canada’s governing Conservative Party
headquarters. Interpol also  listed  him as a wanted person, and
his photo and details of his alleged crime were posted on
websites around the world.  “He used the web to glorify himself and it was the web
that got him arrested,” Lafreniere said.  A foot was found at the  Conservative Party ’s office a few
blocks from Parliament on May 29; a hand was found by the postal
service in Ottawa, and a torso was found near an apartment
building in Montreal, according to Lafreniere.  The victim of the killing was Jun Lin, a 33-year-old
Chinese student studying in Montreal, the CBC reported June 1,
citing Montreal police. Montreal police say Magnotta killed Lin
and videotaped a sequence of repeated stabbing and dismemberment
before mailing the body parts, CBC reported.  Canadian Press  reported that police stopped Magnotta after
someone recognized him outside an Internet café in Berlin.  To contact the reporters on this story:
