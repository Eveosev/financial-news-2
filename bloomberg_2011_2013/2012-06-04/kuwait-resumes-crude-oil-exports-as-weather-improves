Kuwait, OPECâ€™s fourth-biggest oil
producer, resumed crude exports this morning after weather in
the region improved, Mohammed al-Ajmi, a spokesman for state-
refiner Kuwait National Petroleum Co., said today.  Kuwait suspended all crude exports on June 2 and closed
operations at two main ports as strong winds and a sandstorm
reduced visibility to less than 100 meters in some areas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
