Gold One International Ltd. (GDO)  said work
stopped at its Modder East unit in  South Africa  yesterday as
most night-shift employees didn’t report for duty, while a group
of day-shift workers started a planned strike today.  The strike at the operation, located 30 kilometers (19
miles) east of Johannesburg, is unprotected as it is against a
three-year wage accord signed in April 2010, the Sydney-based
company said in a statement. The gold producer will be
implementing a no work, no pay policy, it said. Day-shift miners
who are members of the Professional Transport Allied Workers
Union submitted a strike notice on May 31.  PTAWU is not recognized by the company as it currently
represents fewer than 30 percent of the employees at Modder
East. The  National Union of Mineworkers  represents the majority
of the 1,800 employees at the mine.  “We are currently in discussions with all parties and once
the impact is understood, I will report further,” Grant Stuart,
a company spokesman, said in an e-mailed response to questions,
without saying how much production has been lost.  Gold One increased for a third day, rising 0.3 percent to
3.85 rand by the close in Johannesburg. The stock was unchanged
at 43 Australian cents in Sydney.  To contact the reporter on this story:
