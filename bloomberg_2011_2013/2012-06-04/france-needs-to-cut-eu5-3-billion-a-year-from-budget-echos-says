France  needs to make 5.3 billion
euros ($6.6 billion) a year in annual savings in order to
balance the budget in 2016,  Les Echos  reported, citing an
official report that hasn’t been made public.  The Inspection Generale des Finances recommended cutting
the number of government employees, as well as salary and hiring
freezes, according to the newspaper. The report, ordered by
former Prime Minister  Francois Fillon , said that 21 billion
euros in savings to 2016 would mean projected spending increases
would be cut in half.  A plan by Socialist President Francois Hollande to push
back by one year to 2017 the elimination of the budget deficit
would be “useful” in the case of weak economic growth,  Les
Echos  said. Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault has begin preparing
the 2013 budget.  To contact the reporter on this story:
