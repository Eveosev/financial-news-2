(Corrects figure in third paragraph.)  Newcrest Mining Ltd. (NCM)  will triple its
gold output in the next five years at its Bonikro mine located
in central-western Ivory Coast, according to the Mines and
Energy Ministry.  The mining company, based in Melbourne, expects to produce
12 metric tons of gold a year by 2017 from 4 tons currently, the
ministry said an e-mailed statement today.  Ivory Coast’s government, a shareholder in LGL Mines CI SA
which operates the Bonikro mine, received 155 million CFA francs
($294,000) last week from Newcrest Mining in dividends.  Ivory Coast expects gold production to rise 18 percent this
year to 14.6 tons mainly because of production at  Rangold
Resources Ltd. (RRS) ’s Tongon gold mine located in the north of the
country, the  Finance Ministry  said in March.  To contact the reporter on this story:
