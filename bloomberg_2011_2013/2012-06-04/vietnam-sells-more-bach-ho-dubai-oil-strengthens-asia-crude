Vietnam ’s PV Oil sold as much as
900,000 barrels of its Bach Ho crude for June and July loading
in the second round of deals following the closing of the
country’s only refinery.  The company sold 300,000 barrels to Petroleo Brasileiro SA,
known as  Petrobras (PETR4) , and 600,000 barrels to Arcadia Petroleum
Ltd., according to two traders who participate in the market.
They declined to be identified because the information is
confidential.  Brazil ’s Petrobras paid a premium of about $3.80 to $4 a
barrel more than benchmark Minas crude for a cargo loading
around June 20, one of the traders said. That compares with
800,000 barrels of Bach Ho crude for July, which sold at a
premium of about $6 a barrel to benchmark Minas oil.  PV Oil’s parent company, Vietnam Oil & Gas Group, shut the
131,000-barrel-a day Dung Quat oil refinery on May 15 until
about June 15. Most of the oil processed at facility is Bach Ho.  Russia’s TNK-BP offered to sell 100,000 metric tons of East
Siberia-Pacific Ocean crude, or ESPO, for loading July 13 to
July 18, said two traders who participate in the market,
declining to be identified because the information is
confidential. The offer closes today.  PT Pertamina,  Indonesia ’s state-owned oil company, offered
to sell 145,000 barrels of Geragai condensate for loading in
July, according to a tender document obtained by Bloomberg News.
Bids close June 7.  Dubai Timespreads  Dubai crude’s  backwardation , when prices for prompt
supplies are  greater  than future delivery, rose 1 cent. Swaps
for July were $1.33 cents a barrel more than September,
according to data from PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a London-based
broker.  The difference between oil delivered in one month compared
with three months, known as the timespread, has widened 21
percent during the last month from $1.10 on May 4, a sign that
demand from refiners is increasing.  The July Brent-Dubai exchange for swaps, which measures the
European marker grade’s premium against the Middle Eastern oil,
dropped 7 cents to $2.90 a barrel, according to data from PVM.
The August EFS was down 14 cents to $2.89.  Oman for July delivery slid $3.53 to $95.18 a barrel at
12:30 p.m. on the Dubai Mercantile Exchange.  Eight Dubai partial cargoes were sold today, according to a
survey of traders who monitor the Platts pricing window. Royal
Dutch Shell Plc was the only buyer, paying $95.15 a barrel for
four 25,000-barrel lots from Phibro LLC, two from Glencore
International Plc and one from Mercuria Energy Trading SA. Shell
bought the eighth from Mercuria at $95.10.  To contact the reporter on this story:
