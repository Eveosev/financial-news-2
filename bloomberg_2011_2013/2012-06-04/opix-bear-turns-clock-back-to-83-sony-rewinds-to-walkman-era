Japan’s  Topix Index (TPX)  entered a bear
market, with stocks plunging to a level not seen since 1983 as
 Europe ’s debt crisis spurs a global flight from risk assets,
driving up the yen and threatening exports.  The country’s broadest equities gauge slumped 1.9 percent
to 695.51 yesterday, the lowest close since Dec. 13, 1983, amid
concern the crisis will derail the global economy as Japan
struggles with the legacy of last year’s natural and nuclear
disasters. The index has lost more than 20 percent from this
year’s high on March 27, meeting the definition of a bear
market.  Sony Corp. (6758)  fell below 1,000 yen for the first time since
1980, when it introduced its iconic Walkman in the U.S.  Brokerages, steelmakers and insurance companies led
declines among the Topix’s 33 industry groups. The average price
of stocks on the gauge has slid to 0.82 times net assets, lower
than during the 2008-09 financial crisis. Shares on the  Standard
& Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  traded at 2.02 times on June 1, while those
on the  Stoxx Europe 600 Index (SXXP)  were valued at 1.29.  “Investors are worried about worst-case scenarios in
Europe and even though stocks are looking really cheap, nobody
is willing to buy,” said Gentoku Kiyokawa, Tokyo-based head of
the Japanese investment management division at BNP Paribas
Investment Partners, which oversees the equivalent of $610
billion. “Markets are pricing in the risk Europe’s crisis hits
growth in  China  and the U.S. and leads to another Great
Depression.”  Before Bubble, Deflation  In 1983, the Topix was in the sixth year of a 12-year
advance that ended when an asset bubble burst, ushering in an
era of deflation and economic stagnation. The gauge has lost 76
percent since peaking on Dec. 18, 1989.  The Topix entered a  bear market  for the second time since
last year’s disasters as concern that Europe’s debt crisis is
spreading outweighed improved earnings forecasts. Investors
await an election on June 17 that may determine whether  Greece 
stays in the euro, while policy makers remain divided about how
to keep the crisis from spreading to Spain and  Italy .  “What’s fueling the panic in the market is the gridlock in
Europe,” said  Ayako Sera , a market strategist at Sumitomo
Mitsui Trust Bank Ltd., which has $422 billion in assets. “The
recession could spread globally from Europe.”  Japanese exporters also fell after the yen on June 1
touched the highest level against the dollar since Feb. 14, when
the Bank of  Japan  added to its bond purchases. Further monetary
easing has failed to weaken the currency.  Sony Below 1,000  Sony, the country’s No. 1 exporter of consumer electronics,
slumped 1.7 percent to close yesterday at 996 yen.  Foreign investors have been  net sellers  of Japanese
equities for six consecutive weeks through May 25, the longest
such streak since October. They made up 71 percent of Japanese
stock transactions in the week ended May 25, according to the
Tokyo Stock Exchange.  Short selling in Japan accounted for 32 percent of the
total value of shares traded on May 30, the most since June last
year, according to the Tokyo Stock Exchange. That compares with
a 25 percent average in the past six months.  “Everybody is looking to unload risk assets,” said BNP
Paribas’ Kiyokawa. “There’s no use talking about valuations
right now because the market isn’t moving on logic.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
