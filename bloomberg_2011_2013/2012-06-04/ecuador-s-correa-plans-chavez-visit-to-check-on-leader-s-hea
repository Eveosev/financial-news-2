Ecuadorean President Rafael Correa
plans to visit Venezuelan counterpart  Hugo Chavez , who’s
battling an undisclosed form of cancer, in the “coming days”
to check on the leader’s health.  Correa said Venezuela’s Foreign Minister Nicolas Maduro
told him that speculation Chavez had two months to live was
wrong, according to a statement published today in the
Ecuadorean president’s official gazette.  U.S. journalist Dan Rather on May 30 cited an unidentified
official close to Chavez as saying the Venezuelan president’s
cancer had “entered the end stage.” Chavez, who has undergone
three operations and several rounds of chemotherapy and
radiation treatment in the past year, has refused to provide
details about his diagnosis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
