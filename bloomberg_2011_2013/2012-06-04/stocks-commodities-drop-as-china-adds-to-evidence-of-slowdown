Global stocks and commodities fell,
with Japanese and Chinese equity gauges tumbling into bear
markets, after data from  China  added to evidence of a global
economic slowdown. Italian 10-year bonds advanced.  The MSCI All-Country-World  Index (XU100)  dropped 0.4 percent by
9:50 a.m. in  London  and the  Stoxx Europe 600 Index (SXXP)  fell 0.6
percent after entering a bear market on June 1.  Japan ’s Topix
Index declined 1.9 percent, the lowest since Dec. 13, 1983, and
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng China Enterprises Index retreated 2.8
percent. Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index weakened 0.5
percent. Oil sank to the lowest in almost eight months and
copper plunged to a five-month low. The Italian 10-year bond
yield lost seven basis points to 5.80 percent.  China’s non-manufacturing  purchasing managers’ index 
dropped to 55.2 in May from 56.1 in April, the National Bureau
of Statistics and China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing
said yesterday. European investor confidence weakened to a
three-year low, the Sentix research institute said today. U.S.
factory orders were probably little changed in April, economists
said before a Commerce Department report later today.  “People are more concerned about a return of their capital
as opposed to a return on their capital,” said Nick Maroutsos,
who oversees about $2.9 billion of assets as managing director
and co-founder of Sydney-based Kapstream Capital. “The recovery
is still going to continue to have fits and starts. We need
something more substantial that’s going to get investors back
into the market.”  Stoxx 600  The Stoxx 600 slipped, extending  the gauge’s decline  from
this year’s high to 14 percent, as carmakers and chemical
companies retreated. More than four stocks dropped for every one
that climbed. Novartis AG and Nestle SA fell, making the
greatest contribution to the  Stoxx 600’s slide . The U.K., Irish
and Greek markets are closed today for public holidays.  The decline in S&P 500 futures indicates the U.S. equity
benchmark will slide for a fourth day. A Commerce Department
report at 10 a.m. in  Washington  will show that  factory orders 
climbed 0.2 percent in April, according to the  median economist
estimate  in a Bloomberg survey. The measure slipped 1.9 percent
in March.  The 17-nation euro depreciated 0.2 percent against the yen.
 Australia ’s dollar fell 0.3 percent versus the greenback and
dropped 0.4 percent against the Japanese currency before the
nation’s central bank announces its interest-rate decision
tomorrow. The  Reserve Bank  of Australia will cut its benchmark
rate by a quarter percentage point to 3.50 percent, according to
the median estimate of 27 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Spanish Yields  The Spanish 10-year yield slipped two basis points, with
the similar-maturity  German bund yield  rising two basis points
to 1.19 percent, after the rate fell to a record 1.127 percent
on June 1. The yield on the Greek bond due in February 2023
advanced eight basis points to 30.62 percent.  The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note increased four
basis points to 1.49 percent in Asia trading.  Oil futures dropped as much as 2.1 percent to $81.50 a
barrel in  New York , the lowest price for a most-active contract
since Oct. 7. Copper in New York declined as much as 2.3 percent
to $3.238 a pound, the lowest since Dec. 15. The London Metal
Exchange is closed today for a holiday.  Hungary’s  BUX Index (BUX)  slumped for the first day in three,
retreating 1.1 percent, and South Africa’s benchmark  FTSE/JSE (JALSH) 
Africa All Shares Index declined 0.5 percent. Turkey’s ISE
National 100 Index fell 0.2 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
