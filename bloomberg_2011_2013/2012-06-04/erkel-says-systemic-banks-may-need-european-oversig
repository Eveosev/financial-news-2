German  Chancellor Angela Merkel  said
systemic banks may need supervision at the European level as the
European Union weighs possible steps toward “political union.”  “The fiscal pact is one step, but it’s not sufficient
yet,” Merkel told reporters in Berlin today before talks with
European Commission head  Jose Barroso . “So we will also talk
about to what degree one has to bring the systemic banks under
specific European supervision to keep national interests from
playing too large a role.”  She and Barroso met at the Chancellery to prepare for an EU
summit on June 28-29 that is Europe’s latest effort to combat
the euro-area debt crisis now in its third year and discuss more
common economic policies.  “The world wants to know how we see the political union in
complement to the currency union,” Merkel said. “That requires
an answer in the foreseeable future and  Germany  will be a very
constructive partner.  ‘‘In the euro zone, we need more Europe, not less,’’ she
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
