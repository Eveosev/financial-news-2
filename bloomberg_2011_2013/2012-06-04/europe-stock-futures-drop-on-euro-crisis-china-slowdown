European stocks declined for a fourth
day as reports showed that orders to U.S. factories unexpectedly
fell in April and China’s services-industry growth weakened in
May.  Volkswagen AG (VOW)  and  Daimler AG (DAI)  dropped at least 1.5 percent,
as carmakers led losses in the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  Aker
Solutions ASA (AKSO) , the Norwegian oil-services company, slumped to
the lowest in four months. Vestas Wind Systems A/S plunged to a
nine-year low after BlackRock Inc. cut its holding in the
company to 4.02 percent.  The Stoxx 600 retreated 0.5 percent to 233.87 at the close
in London. The volume of shares changing hands on the companies
listed on the gauge was 55 percent lower than the average of the
last 30 days, as the U.K., Irish and Greek markets were closed.
The Euro Stoxx 50 has lost 20 percent from its high this year,
which some analysts call a  bear market .  The Stoxx 600 has tumbled 14 percent from its 2012 high
amid concern Greece will be forced to leave the euro currency
union. The gauge is now trading at 9.72 times its estimated
earnings, lower than the five-year average of 11.67, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  National benchmark indexes dropped in nine the 15 western
 European (SXXP)  markets that were open today. Germany’s DAX fell 1.2
percent, while France’s CAC 40 added 0.1 percent. Spain’s IBEX
35 jumped 2.9 percent, while Italy’s FTSE MIB rose 1.2 percent.  U.S., China Reports  Orders to U.S. factories  unexpectedly fell in April for a
second month, pointing to a deceleration in manufacturing as the
global economy cools.  Bookings dropped 0.6 percent after a revised 2.1 percent
decrease in March, the first back-to-back declines in more than
three years, figures from the Commerce Department showed today
in  Washington . Economists projected a 0.2 percent gain,
according to the median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey.  China’s  non-manufacturing  purchasing managers’ index fell
to 55.2 in May from 56.1 in April, the National Bureau of
Statistics and China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing said
yesterday in Beijing.  JPMorgan Chase & Co. last week cut its estimate for China’s
growth for the second time within a month. It now expects the
world’s second-largest economy to expand 7.7 percent in 2012
against a previous projection of 8 percent.  Banking Union  Spanish Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy  said European leaders
should reinforce efforts to protect euro-area lenders,
increasing pressure on German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  to back
new ideas to resolve the debt crisis.  Rajoy on June 2 added his voice to calls for a more robust
“banking union” in Europe, lending his support for a
centralized system to re-capitalize lenders. On the same day,
Merkel toughened her opposition to euro-area debt sharing,
telling members of her party in Berlin that “under no
circumstances” would she agree to German-backed euro bonds.  French Finance Minister  Pierre Moscovici  will travel to
Brussels today to meet with European Union Economic and Monetary
Affairs Commissioner  Olli Rehn  and EU Financial Services
Commissioner  Michel Barnier . Moscovici has said that aid for
troubled banks should come through the European Stability
Mechanism rather than through governments.  The EU is targeting July 9 as the start date for its
permanent euro-area rescue fund, the 500 billion-euro ESM, an
official of the 27-nation bloc said.  Carmakers Slide  Volkswagen and Daimler dropped 3.2 percent to 119.75 euros
and 1.9 percent to 34.85 euros, respectively, as a gauge of
European carmakers was the worst performer of the  19 industry
groups  in the Stoxx 600.  Continental AG (CON)  lost 2.5 percent to
62.89 euros.  Aker Solutions declined 3 percent to 75.05 kroner, its
lowest since Jan. 31.  Subsea 7 SA (SUBC)  slid 4.2 percent to 111.80
kroner and  Petroleum GEO-Services ASA (PGS)  lost 4.1 percent to 64.85
kroner.  Vestas, the world’s biggest wind-turbine maker, fell 5.7
percent to 32.43 kroner, its lowest since March 2003, as
BlackRock cut its holding in the company by 20 percent to 4.02
percent.  Dassault Systemes SA, a maker of design software, lost 1.2
percent to 70.74 euros after CM-CIC Securities SA cut the stock
to hold from buy.  Banks Rally  Spanish and Italian banks paced gains, as a gauge of
European lenders posted the best performance on the Stoxx 600.
UniCredit and Intesa Sanpaolo each rallied 4.5 percent to 2.61
euros and 5.8 percent to 1.06 euros, respectively.  Banco
Santander SA (SAN)  jumped 4.9 percent to 4.53 euros.  Banco BPI SA (BPI)  rallied for the fifth day, its longest stretch
of gains since July 2011. The stock climbed 5.8 percent to 40.3
euro cents after the Portuguese lender said it plans to boost
its capital by 1.5 billion euros, including an injection of 1.3
billion euros by the government.  Assicurazioni Generali SpA, Italy’s largest insurer, added
2.2 percent to 8.68 euros as  Mario Greco  prepares to take over
as chief executive officer. The 52-year-old, who as CEO of
Riunione Adriatica di Sicurta SpA expanded that company before
its 2005 buyout by Allianz AG, will take charge at Generali
after he resigns from Zurich Insurance Group AG. Perissinotto,
who has led Generali since 2001, was voted out by its board 10-
to-5 on June 2.  To contact the reporter on this story:
