The Obama administration overstated
the greenhouse-gas emissions from unconventional natural-gas
production, the  American Petroleum Institute  and the America’s
Natural Gas Alliance said today in a study.  The two industry groups, which oppose U.S. regulation of
hydraulic fracturing to extract gas from shale formations, found
in the study that total-gas emissions during the process are
about half the level estimated by the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency.  The study responds to the EPA’s greenhouse-gases inventory
released in 2011, which the organizations said “substantially
increased estimates of methane emissions from petroleum and
natural-gas systems.”  Venting methane into the air when unloading liquids at the
well is about 86 percent lower than the EPA’s estimates, the
study found.  In April, the EPA proposed rules that would force drillers
to capture or flare methane released when fracking starts at a
well. Industry groups said the requirements are too onerous, in
part because they require actions many drillers are already
taking.  To contact the reporter on this story:
