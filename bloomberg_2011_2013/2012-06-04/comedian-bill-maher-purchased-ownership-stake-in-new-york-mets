Political comedian  Bill Maher 
disclosed that he bought a minority stake in the  New York Mets 
when the majority owners were selling portions of the franchise
earlier this year to cover debt.  Maher, who hosts Home Box Office Inc.’s “Real Time with
Bill Maher,” was born in New York City and said he’s been a
Mets fan since he was six years old. He attended last night’s
6-1 win over the  St. Louis Cardinals  at Citi Field and was on
the field for pre-game batting practice with Mets chief
executive officer  Jeff Wilpon .  “I’ve really never wavered in my love for this team,”
Maher, 56, said in a video posted on the Mets’ official Twitter
feed. “We were thrilled in ’69, we were thrilled in ’86 and I
think we’ll be thrilled again very soon. You’ve got to believe
and I do.”  Maher didn’t disclose what his ownership stake is.  Mets owners Fred Wilpon and Saul Katz in March sold 12
minority stakes in the team for $240 million and used the sales
to repay $65 million in loans from Major League Baseball and
 Bank of America Corp.  and at least $100 million of debt.  Wilpon and Katz in March also agreed to pay $162 million to
settle a $1 billion lawsuit from Irving Picard, the trustee
responsible for liquidating Bernard Madoff’s defunct firm, over
whether the Mets’ owners and others blinded themselves to
Madoff’s Ponzi scheme because it benefited their businesses
financially.  To contact the reporter on this story:
