Spacing letters and words wide apart
may help dyslexic children read faster and with fewer errors,
according to a  study  released today.  Finding ways to make it easier for dyslexic children to
read could help improve their life skills, giving them added
practice to improve learning, the authors said in the study,
published today in the  Proceedings of the National Academy of
Sciences . The researchers tested 94 French and Italian children
ages 8 to 14.  “Reading deficits must be treated by reading more -- a
vicious circle for a dyslexic child,” the study authors wrote.
“Our findings offer a practical way to ameliorate dyslexics’
reading achievement without any training.”  Putting wide spaces between words and letters avoids a
difficulty faced by dyslexics called “crowding,” which makes
recognizing letters more difficult, the authors wrote. Wider
spacing doesn’t help normal, adult readers, who are slowed down
by such spacing.  The study by French and Italian researchers was funded by a
grant from the Institute for Maternal and Child Health in
Trieste,  Italy .  To contact the reporter on this story:
