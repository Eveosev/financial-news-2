The cost for European banks to borrow
in dollars held at the highest in almost two months, according
to a money-markets indicator.  The three-month cross-currency  basis swap , the rate banks
pay to convert euro interest payments into dollars, was little
changed at 55.5 basis points below the euro interbank offered
rate at 8:50 a.m. in  London , according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. That’s near the most expensive since April 10.  The one-year basis swap increased to 69 basis points below
Euribor, the highest cost in two weeks, from minus 68 on June 1.
A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  Prices in the forward market for three-month Euribor
relative to overnight indexed swaps -- known as the FRA/OIS
spread -- were unchanged at 33 basis points.  The Euribor/OIS spread was 40 basis points from 41 at the
end of last week.  Lenders increased  overnight deposits  at the Frankfurt-based
 European Central Bank  on June 1, placing 785 billion euros ($975
billion) from 769 billion euros the day before.  To contact the reporter on this story:
