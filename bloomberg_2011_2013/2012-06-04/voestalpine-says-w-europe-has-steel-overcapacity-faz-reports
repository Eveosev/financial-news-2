Wolfgang Eder,  Voestalpine AG (VOE) â€™s chief
executive officer, said that there is at least 20 percent of
overcapacity on the steel market in western  Europe ,  Frankfurter
Allgemeine Zeitung  reported, citing an interview.  Eder told the German newspaper that 210 million tons of
steel could be produced in the European Union each year while
the actual need is only 150 million tons to 160 million tons.
European steel companies will face competition from Turkey,
Russia and Ukraine in the future, Eder said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
