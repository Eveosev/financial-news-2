Turkish  inflation  slowed the most
since January 2003 after the crisis in  Europe  forced the central
bank to tighten monetary policy and food prices slumped. Yields
fell the most in two months.  The inflation rate fell to 8.3 percent in May from 11.1
percent the previous month, the statistics office in Ankara said
today. The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of 11
economists was 9 percent.  Core inflation , excluding items such
as food and energy, slowed to 7.7 percent from 8.2 percent.
Consumer prices fell 0.2 percent month-on-month.  Central bank Governor Erdem Basci increased the  cost of
funding  for banks to as high as 10.8 percent in May, the most
since mid-January, to support the lira. The currency fell 18
percent in 2011, fueling inflation, including a 2.9 percent
annual spike in May last year. The lira has slid more than 5
percent in the past month as the euro-zone crisis worsened,
forcing the central bank to tighten policy as it pursues a 6.5
percent year-end inflation forecast.  “It seems clear that the euro-area jitters will reside
with us for some time,”  Tevfik Aksoy , chief economist for
Central and Eastern Europe, the  Middle East  and  Africa  at Morgan
Stanley in  London , said in e-mailed comments on June 1. “The
decline in headline inflation will be temporary.”  Yields on benchmark two-year bonds fell as much as 15 basis
points, or 0.15 percentage point, to 9.20 percent, the lowest
level since March 12. Yields dropped 8 basis points to 9.27
percent at 10:28 a.m. The lira strengthened 0.3 percent to
1.8523 per dollar, gaining for the second day.  Containing Risks  Inflation will be “volatile” and “stay significantly
above target” until the last three months of the year, the
central bank  said  on June 1. Basci will continue his tight
monetary stance to “contain risks,” according to the summary
of the bank’s May 29 Monetary Policy Committee meeting.  “May inflation is positive for bonds in decreasing the
need for extra tightening, even though the central bank will
likely continue its flexible monetary policy,” Ibrahim Aksoy,
economist at broker Seker Securities in Istanbul, said in an e-
mailed report to clients.  Year-end inflation will be 7.7 percent, according to the
central bank’s latest fortnightly  survey  published on May 22.
That’s the highest this year and up from a 7.2 percent forecast
in the first half of February.  Food prices slumped 2.2 percent in May from the previous
month, the statistics office said. Producer prices rose 0.5
percent month-on-month and accelerated to 8.1 percent annually
in May from 7.7 percent in April.  To contact the reporters on this story:
