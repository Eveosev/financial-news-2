The U.S. Supreme Court buttressed the
flexibility cities and states have to make changes in their
financing systems, ruling in favor of Indianapolis in a tax
fight with a group of homeowners.  The justices, voting 6-3, said the city didn’t violate the
Constitution when it forgave sewer-system debt owed by some
homeowners while refusing to give refunds to those who had
already paid.  “The Constitution does not require the city to draw the
perfect line nor even to draw a line superior to some other line
it might have drawn,” Justice  Stephen Breyer  wrote for the
court. “It requires only that the line actually draw be a
rational line.”  The fight stemmed from the city’s effort to end its system
of funding sewer projects through taxes on properties that
benefit. The city used those rules to pay for the so-called
Brisbane/Manning project in 2002, assessing the owners of 180
parcels $9,278 each. The city said the property owners could pay
either upfront or in monthly installments.  In 2005, the city switched to a system that charged
residents only $2,500 for new connections and made up the
difference by increasing usage fees on all city residents. As
part of that change, the city said property owners who were
paying the Brisbane/Manning assessment in installments didn’t
have to pay off their balances.  The owners of 31 parcels sued, saying they had paid their
assessments in full and were being treated unfairly. The suit
said the differing treatment violated the Constitution’s
guarantee of equal protection.  The case is Armour v. Indianapolis, 11-161.  To contact the reporter on this story:
