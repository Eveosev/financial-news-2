Peruvian dollar-denominated bonds
fell as weak manufacturing activity in  China  and the U.S. curbed
demand for the Andean nation’s securities.  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 6.55 percent bond due
March 2037 climbed one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to
4.47 percent at 3:42 p.m. in Lima. The bond’s price fell 0.18
cent to 131 cents per dollar.  China’s non-manufacturing industries expanded in May at the
slowest pace in more than a year as export orders declined, a
report showed yesterday. Bookings at U.S. factories dropped 0.6
percent in April, the Commerce Department said today.  “External risks have clearly worsened,” said  Siobhan Morden , the head of Latin America fixed income strategy at
Jefferies Group Inc. in New York.  The sol was little changed at 2.7050 per  U.S. dollar  at
today’s close, compared with 2.7055 on June 1, according to
Deutsche Bank AG’s local unit.  The central bank didn’t  buy or sell dollars  in the spot
market today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
