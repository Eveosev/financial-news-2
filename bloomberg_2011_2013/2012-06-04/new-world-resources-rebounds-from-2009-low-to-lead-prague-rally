New World Resources Plc (NWR) , the biggest
Czech producer of coking coal, rebounded from its lowest in
almost three years, leading gains for the country’s stock index.  The stock climbed 2.8 percent to 92 koruna by 11:33 a.m. in
 Prague , making it the best performer today in the 14-member  PX (PX) 
equity gauge, which rose 0.5 percent from a five-month low.  NWR tumbled 11 percent last week, the most since September
2011, pushing the stock’s 14-day relative strength index to 22
on June 1. Readings lower than 30 suggest in technical analysis
an asset may gain. The RSI increased to 27 today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
