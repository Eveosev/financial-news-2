Gunmen withdrew from Tripoli’s
international airport, hours after storming the facility today
to protest the kidnapping of a militia’s chief, the official
Libya  News Agency  reported.  The attackers arrived in tanks and  pickup trucks  armed with
heavy machine guns and took control of the facility, forcing
passengers to disembark from outbound flights, the news agency
said, citing witnesses in the Libyan capital.  The incident is the latest challenge to the central
government’s attempts to restore security after the ouster and
death of longtime Libyan leader  Muammar Qaddafi .  The assailants were protesting the disappearance of Abu-
Ajeila al-Habashi, the head of a militia in the western city of
Tarhouna, who was snatched by unknown gunmen yesterday, the
agency said, citing its correspondent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
