OAO  Norilsk Nickel  climbed the most
in almost a week after Morgan Stanley said the world’s largest
producer of nickel and palladium will benefit from the ruble’s
decline.  Norilsk rose 1.9 percent to 4,920 rubles by the close in
Moscow, the biggest advance since May 29. The Russian currency
weakened as much as 1.4 percent against the dollar today before
rebounding and rising 0.7 percent to 33.451 per dollar, the
first gain since May 22.  Norilsk, Polyus Gold International Ltd., United Co. Rusal,
the world’s largest aluminum producer, and Polymetal
International Plc will benefit because they earn in dollars
while the bulk of their costs are in rubles, Morgan Stanley
analysts said in an e-mailed note.  Polyus Gold rose 0.9 percent to 1,016 rubles in Moscow,
Rusal climbed 3.7 percent to 199.90 rubles and Polymetal slid
0.2 percent to 522.60 rubles.  To contact the reporter on this story:
