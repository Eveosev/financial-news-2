EFG-Hermes Holding SAE (HRHO)  said it is
taking legal measures to protect shareholders after  Planet IB
Ltd.  announced the intention to buy the biggest publicly traded
Arab investment bank.  Planet, a group of investors, hasn’t submitted a tender
offer to Egyptian regulators, EFG-Hermes said in an e-mailed
statement today. The Cairo-based bank also said Planet’s
proposed bid lacked details, including on investors and their
commitment.  Planet’s Chairman Mahmoud Abdel Latif told Bloomberg today
the company is in discussions with “different channels,
including the regulator” about a possible tender offer. The
company submitted letters of intent to the regulator and the
tender offer is subject to due diligence, he said.  Shareholders of EFG-Hermes voted June 2 in favor of
creating an investment bank in which Qatar’s QInvest LLC will
own 60 percent. The decision was made after two letters from
Planet were discussed, EFG-Hermes said in the statement today.  Planet offered 13.5 Egyptian pounds a share, or 23 percent
more than EFG-Hermes’ closing price on May 31. The offer
amounted to 6.5 billion Egyptian pounds ($1.1 billion).  EFG-Hermes shares declined 1.2 percent to 10.88 pounds at
the 2:30 p.m. close in Cairo, paring the advance for the year to
8.7 percent. That compares with a 27 percent rally in the
benchmark  EGX30 Index. (EGX30)   To contact the reporter on this story:
