A Libyan military court convicted 24
foreigners of aiding the government of  Muammar Qaddafi  during
the uprising that led to his ouster, sentencing one to life in
prison with hard labor and the rest to 10 years in prison.  The prosecution said the defendants -- 19 Ukrainians, three
Russians and two Belarusians -- had been hired by the former
government to service and repair rocket launchers, the official
Libya News Agency reported, citing Army Chief of Staff Ali al-
Sheikhi.  The groupâ€™s leader, a Russian, was sentenced to life in
prison with hard labor, the agency said. Al-Sheiki said the
sentences can be appealed, the agency reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
