Global funds reduced ownership of
South Korean stocks by the most since August last month while
boosting holdings of local-currency bonds as  Europe ’s debt
crisis spurred demand for the safest assets.  International investors, led by funds in the U.K.,
Luxembourg and France, reduced ownership of equities by 3.4
trillion won ($2.9 billion), the  Financial Supervisory Service 
said in an e-mailed statement today. Their holdings were 367.8
trillion won at the end of May, accounting for 31.4 percent of
shares listed on the Korea Exchange. The  Kospi (KOSPI)  Index fell 7
percent in May, the biggest monthly loss since August.  Global funds increased holdings of South Korean bonds by
630.2 billion won to 88.5 trillion won last month after pulling
money in April. Investors based in  Switzerland  were the biggest
buyers, ahead of Luxembourg and  Hong Kong , with total ownership
increasing by 617.9 billion won. U.S. investors were the top
sellers, cutting holdings by 572 billion won, followed by the
U.K. and China.  Yields on South Korea’s three-year government bonds
declined 12 basis points, or 0.12 percentage point, to 3.33
percent last month, Korea Exchange Inc. prices show. The won
retreated 4.3 percent in May to 1,180.33 per dollar, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
