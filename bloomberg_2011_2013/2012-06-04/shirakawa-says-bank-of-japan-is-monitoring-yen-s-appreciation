Bank of Japan  Governor Masaaki Shirakawa said the central bank is watching how the yen’s
advance has been affecting the nation as  Europe ’s debt crisis
and weaker U.S. economic data bolster demand for the currency.  We’ve been monitoring “the recent appreciation of the
yen,” Shirakawa said at a forum in Tokyo today. “The bank
carefully monitors the development of the foreign-exchange rate
from the viewpoint of how it affects the economy through its
impact on business sentiment.”  The yen climbed near a four-month high against the dollar
last week, renewing concern that the currency’s advance will
erode exporters’ profits. Japanese Finance Minister  Jun Azumi 
declined to comment on whether authorities have intervened in
 currency markets  or will do so after pledging last week to take
“decisive” action when needed.  Japan’s currency traded at 78.17 per dollar as of 2:02 p.m.
in  Tokyo  compared with a record 75.35 reached in October. The
yen tends to strengthen in times of crisis and has advanced more
than 6 percent against the dollar since mid-March.  To contact the reporter on this story:
