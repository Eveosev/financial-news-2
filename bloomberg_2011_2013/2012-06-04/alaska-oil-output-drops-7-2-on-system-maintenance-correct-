Alaska crude-oil production dropped
7.2 percent in May from a year earlier after Alyeska Pipeline
Service Co., operator of the cross-state pipeline system, shut
sections for work and as output from wells declined.  Production  averaged  570,770 barrels per day last month,
down from 614,961  a year earlier  and 577,552 in the  previous 
month, the state Department of Revenue said on the agency’s
website. Production peaked for the month at 591,966 barrels on
May 3 and fell to a low of 530,873 on May 25.  Alyeska was scheduled to shut the 800-mile (1,287-
kilometer) Trans-Alaska crude system on May 18 and May 27 for
work at Pump Stations 3 and 5. Alaskan  output  has declined
annually since 2002 as falling yield from existing wells hasn’t
been replaced, according to the state tax division.  E-mails seeking comment from Michelle Egan and Katie
Pesznecker, spokeswomen at Alyeska, weren’t immediately returned
before regular business hours.  Crude-oil output from  Prudhoe Bay  averaged 324,919 barrels
per day in May, down from 329,105 in April, the state said.  Alaskan North Slope crude  has strengthened 33 percent over
the past year, trading $16.25 a barrel above the U.S. benchmark
West Texas Intermediate at 9:04 a.m.  New York  time, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Inventories of the feedstock at the Valdez marine terminal
averaged 5.08 million barrels last month, ranging from 4.06
million on May 4 to 5.69 million May 26, according to the
revenue department.  Alyeska is owned by BP Pipelines (Alaska), ConocoPhillips
Transportation Alaska, ExxonMobil Pipeline Co., Unocal Pipeline
Co., and Koch Alaska Pipeline Co.  To contact the reporter on this story:
