Barclays Plc (BARC) , the U.K.’s second-
largest bank, was sued by Landesbank Baden-Wuerttemberg and
Sealink Funding Ltd. in separate cases over losses in the sale
of mortgage-backed securities valued at a total of $808.7
million.  LBBW said Barclays made misrepresentations in the offering
materials for securities valued at $204.6 million. Sealink
Funding said Barclays made omissions in materials related to
securities valued at $604.1 million. Both filings were in New
York state  Supreme Court  and dated June 1.  Banks acquire mortgage loans from the issuers and bundle
them into securities that are sold to investors and companies
such as Sealink.  The lawsuits, signed by lawyer Joel Bernstein, both say the
offerings “contained material representations and omissions
regarding the legal validity of assignments of  mortgage loans  to
trusts formed to hold the pooled loans and to collect interest
and principal payments due on the loans.”  Barclays declines to comment, said spokeswoman Kristin Friel.  Sealink Funding, an Ireland-based investment firm, took
legal action in February against banks including Royal Bank of
 Scotland  and Credit Suisse over $948.8 million in residential
mortgage-backed securities. In March, LBBW, a German bank, sued
 Bank of America Corp.  over $455 million in mortgage securities.  The cases are Landesbank v. Barclays, 651908/2012, and
Sealink v. Barclays, 651901/2012, New York state Supreme Court,
New York County (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
