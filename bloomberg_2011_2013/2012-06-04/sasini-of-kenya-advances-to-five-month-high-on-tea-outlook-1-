Sasini Ltd. (STCL) , Kenya’s largest coffee
and tea producer by market value, rose to the highest in five
months after the national weather service gave an improved
forecast for tea production in the East African country.  The stock advanced 2.4 percent to 13 shillings by the close
in Nairobi, the highest level since Jan. 3 and a fifth day of
gains, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Kenya’s Meteorological Department said today abundant rains
are boosting the prospects for a “good” crop in the western
highlands and central Rift Valley. The south-eastern lowlands,
parts of the central highlands and the coastal region have been
affected by dry weather, threatening agricultural output, the
Nairobi-based weather agency said.  The country is the world’s largest exporter of black tea.
Most of the crop is produced around the Rift Valley, according
to the Tea Board of  Kenya .  To contact the reporter on this story:
