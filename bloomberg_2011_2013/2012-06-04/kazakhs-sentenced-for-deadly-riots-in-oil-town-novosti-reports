A Kazakh court issued sentences that
ranged from three to seven years in prison for people accused of
taking part in the worst unrest since the former Soviet republic
won independence two decades ago, Novosti-Kazakhstan  reported .  The judge in the western city of Aktau was prevented from
reading out the verdicts as scuffles broke out between relatives
of the accused and police, the Kazakh news service said. A total
of 12 people received prison sentences, with an additional 16
given conditional sentences, five amnestied and three acquitted,
the  Associated Press  said.  The court earlier sentenced five police officers to prison
terms ranging from five to seven years for abuse of power during
the violence, in which at least 14 people were killed, Novosti
Kazakhstan  reported  May 28.  Kazakh police used arms to suppress unrest in Zhanaozen
where a strike by oil workers led to a mass riot during
Independence Day celebrations on Dec. 16.  -- Editors: Paul Abelsky, Zoe Schneeweiss  To contact the reporter on this story:
