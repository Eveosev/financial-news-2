The Czech government may consider
slowing its drive to cut the budget deficit in order to boost
economic growth,  Lidove Noviny  reported, citing Finance 
Minister Miroslav Kalousek.  While the government is sticking to its goal of having
balanced public finances in 2016, it may discuss “a slight
easing of the pace” if it benefits the economy, the newspaper’s
weekend edition quoted Kalousek as saying in an interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
