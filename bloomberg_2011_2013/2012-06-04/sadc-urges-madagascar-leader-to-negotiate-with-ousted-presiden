Southern African leaders urged
 Madagascar ’s president,  Andry Rajoelina , to meet his exiled
predecessor “as a matter of urgency” to advance plans to end a
political stalemate in the Indian Ocean island nation.  The Southern African Development Community ordered its
mediator for Madagascar, former Mozambican President Joaquim Albert Chissano, to convene the meeting, the 15-nation bloc said
in a statement on June 2 after a leaders’ summit in Luanda,
Angola’s capital.  Rajoelina, with the help of the Madagascan military, ousted
elected President  Marc Ravalomanana  in 2009, setting off the
political crisis. Ten political parties in September agreed on a
plan to set up elections by November to end it.  Ravalomanana, who fled to exile in South Africa, tried to
fly back to Madagascar on Jan. 21 and was forced to return after
Rajoelina’s government closed the island’s airspace. SADC
criticized both men for their actions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
