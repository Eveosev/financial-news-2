Ghana Oil Company Ltd. (GOIL) , the West
African nation’s second-biggest operator of gasoline stations,
rose to the highest on record as the board of the company
appointed Patrick Akpe Kwame Akorli as managing director.  The stock gained 4.3 percent to 49 pesewas as of 2 p.m. in
Accra, the capital, the highest since it began trading in
November 2007. Akorli, formerly finance manager at the company
also known as Goil, was named to the MD position effective
immediately, the company said in a statement e-mailed by the
Ghana Stock Exchange on June 1.  “Investors have been looking for a stable management for a
while now,” Nana Kofi Agyeman Gyamfi, a stock trader at  Merban
Stockbrokers Ltd.  in Accra, said by phone today. “They are
happy with the fact that somebody from the firm, who has
knowledge about the business and the industry, was appointed to
the helm of affairs.”  Akorli has worked for 10 years at Goil and has 15 years of
experience in the industry, Gyamfi said.  Goil has been without a permanent managing director since
the retirement of Yaw Agyemang-Duah in July 2011.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
