Asian currencies traded near a 20-
month low after data on U.S. jobs and non-manufacturing
industries in  China  added to concern the global economy is
deteriorating.  The  MSCI Asia-Pacific Index (MXAP)  of shares slid for a fourth day,
after data on June 1 showed American employers added 69,000
workers last month, the fewest in a year. China’s non-
manufacturing industries expanded at the slowest pace in more
than a year, an official survey showed yesterday. Federal
Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  will testify to a congressional
committee about the outlook for the world’s largest economy this
week, while the  Reserve Bank  of  Australia  and the  European
Central Bank  meet to review rates.  “Last Friday’s weak U.S. number was definitely a factor
hitting the market,” said Goh Puay Yeong, a Singapore-based
foreign-exchange strategist at Credit Suisse Group AG. “Markets
may also be starting to factor expectations for some
quantitative easing. People may be watching this Bernanke
testimony. There might be some policy response from central
banks.”  South Korea ’s won weakened 0.4 percent to 1,182.03 per
dollar at the close in  Seoul , according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Taiwan’s dollar fell 0.4 percent to NT$30.050 and the
Philippine peso declined 0.2 percent to 43.482.  The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia Dollar Index, which tracks the
region’s 10 most-active currencies excluding the yen, was at
114.03 after touching 113.68 on June 1, the lowest level since
September 2010. The MSCI Asia-Pacific Index lost 2.1 percent,
taking its four-day drop to 4.1 percent. China’s purchasing
managers’ index on non-manufacturing industries fell to 55.2 in
May from 56.1 in April, the statistics bureau and logistics
federation said.  Taiwan Exports  The won fell as the  Kospi index  of shares slid the most in
two weeks. South Korea will focus policy efforts more on
boosting economic growth and allocate additional state funds to
support small companies and exporters, Finance Minister Bahk Jae Wan said over the weekend. The central bank will hold borrowing
costs at 3.25 percent for a 12th month on June 8, according to
all 11 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.  Taiwan ’s dollar weakened for a fourth day before official
data on June 7 that will show exports decreased 5.3 percent in
May from a year earlier, according to the median estimate of
economists in a Bloomberg news survey.  Rebound Temporary  Malaysia’s ringgit rose for the first time in a week,
rebounding from an eight-month low, as some investors judged
recent declines excessive. The currency has had five weekly
drops in a row as China’s slowing economy dimmed the export
outlook and Europe’s debt crisis bolstered demand for dollars.
The 14-day relative strength index for Malaysia’s exchange rate
ended last week at 81, above the 70 threshold that signals to
some traders a change in direction is likely.  “All of this is a pause in what’s been a lot of negative
news recently,” said Christopher Gothard, head of foreign
exchange at Brown Brothers Harriman ( Hong Kong ) Ltd. “However,
I don’t think the overall situation has improved so we wouldn’t
expect any rebound in Asian currencies to last.”  The ringgit strengthened 0.3 percent to 3.1995 per dollar
in  Kuala Lumpur , according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It
touched 3.2103 on June 1, the weakest level since Oct. 5.  Elsewhere, Indonesia’s rupiah advanced 0.5 percent to 9,479
per dollar, China’s  yuan  gained 0.07 percent to 6.3644 and
Vietnam’s dong weakened 0.1 percent to 20,898. Thailand’s
financial markets are shut today for a holiday.  To contact the reporters on this story:
