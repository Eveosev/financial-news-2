Turk Hava Yollari (THYAO)  AO, or Turkish
Airlines, gained after saying it’s dropping preparations to bid
for Poland’s state-owned carrier Polskie Linie Lotnicze LOT SA.  The shares climbed 0.8 percent to 2.61 liras at the close
in Istanbul after gaining as much as 1.5 percent.  Turkish Airlines dropped the bid after deciding the
purchase would make a limited contribution to medium- and long-
term growth plans and  shareholder value , the company said after
the market closed on Friday.  “We have argued that such an acquisition would weigh on
the company’s indebtedness and bring operational burden while
Turkish Airlines is digesting its fleet expansion in Turkey,”
Oyak Securities said in an e-mailed report today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
