Asian  stocks  fell, with every major
benchmark gauge in the region retreating, as economic data in
the U.S. and  China  stoked concern global growth is slowing.
Japan’s Topix Index closed at the lowest level since 1983.  The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index joined the Topix in
falling more than 20 percent from this year’s high, entering so-
called bear markets.  Sony Corp. (6758) , a Japanese exporter of consumer
electronics that gets about a fifth of its sales in the U.S.,
fell to levels not seen since 1980, when the Walkman was
introduced in the U.S.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the world’s biggest
mining company, and  Cnooc Ltd. (883) , China’s largest offshore oil
producer, lost at least 2.6 percent as a gauge of commodities
prices fell to an eight-month low.  The MSCI Asia-Pacific Index dropped 2.1 percent to 109.10
as of 7:43 p.m. in  Tokyo , its lowest level since November, with
more than seven shares falling for each that rose. The gauge has
fallen 15 percent from its peak this year on Feb. 29.  “It’s pretty bad out there with the weak U.S. data, growth
cooling in China and with the  European debt crisis  escalating,”
said Benjamin Tam, who helps manage about $1.5 billion at IG
Investment in Hong Kong. “All this put together shows we need
coordinated action from central banks to calm the markets and
stop them falling.”  Futures on Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gained 0.1 percent
after falling as much as 0.9 percent today. The gauge slumped
2.5 percent in  New York  on June 1 and the  Dow Jones Industrial
Average  erased its 2012 gains after reports showed U.S. hiring
missed even the most-pessimistic forecast, the jobless rate rose
to 8.2 percent, and a manufacturing index retreated from a 10-
month high.  Monthly Slump  The MSCI Asia-Pacific slumped 10 percent in May, the
biggest monthly loss since October 2008, when global markets
tumbled following the collapse of Lehman Brother Holdings Inc.
Equities continued declines into June as the U.S. jobs report
added to concern global growth is slowing amid a deepening debt
crisis in  Europe .  The Hang Seng China Enterprises lost 2.6 percent and
 Japan ’s Topix fell 1.9 percent, joining benchmarks in Russia and
Brazil which have fallen more than 20 percent from recent highs.
The Topix closed at the lowest since December 1983 as investors
fled to the relative safety of the yen, driving the currency
higher, reducing the competitiveness of Japanese exports and
cutting the value of overseas sales. The Nikkei 225 Stock
Average dropped 1.7 percent today.  “People are more concerned about a return ‘of’ their
capital, as opposed to a return ‘on’ their capital,” said Nick Maroutsos, who oversees about A$3 billion ($2.9 billion) as
managing director and co-founder of Sydney-based Kapstream
Capital.  U.S. Payrolls  In  Seoul , the Kospi Index dropped 2.8 percent. Australia’s
S&P/ASX 200 Index slid 1.9 percent and  Hong Kong ’s Hang Seng
Index retreated 2 percent.  “The poor U.S. payrolls number should start to deflate
investor optimism about U.S. growth that we’ve encountered,
leaving few places for investors to hide,” said  Gerard Minack ,
global developed-market strategist at Morgan Stanley in Sydney.  Sony fell 1.7 percent to 996 yen, closing below 1,000 yen
in Tokyo trading for the first time since 1980. Toyota Motor
Corp., Asia’s biggest carmaker, retreated 3.5 percent to 2,904
yen. Honda Motor Co., the third-biggest, slid 3.7 percent to
2,368 yen.  Chinese Manufacturing  China’s non-manufacturing industries expanded at the
slowest pace in more than a year as export orders declined and
weakness in real estate overshadowed strength in retailing and
leasing, an official survey indicated.  The  purchasing managers’ index  fell to 55.2 in May from
56.1 in April, the National Bureau of Statistics and China
Federation of Logistics and Purchasing said yesterday in
Beijing. That’s the lowest reading since March 2011 when the
federation started seasonally adjusting the data.  The S&P GSCI Spot Index of 24 commodities fell 1.1 percent
to 574.69, the lowest since October.  BHP Billiton  lost 3.1 percent to A$30.75. Rio Tinto Group,
the world’s third-largest mining company, declined 4.7 percent
to A$52.90. Jiangxi Copper Co., China’s biggest producer of the
metal, slipped 3.6 percent to HK$15.52.  Cnooc dropped 2.6 percent to HK$13.38.  Woodside Petroleum
Ltd. (WPL) , Australia’s second-largest oil producer, retreated 3.4
percent to A$30.87.  Declines in regional equity markets dragged down valuations
on the Asian benchmark to 11.4 times estimated earnings on
average through June 1, compared with 12.2 times for the S&P 500
and 9.8 times for the Stoxx 600.  To contact the reporter on this story:
