Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  cut fewer
than 50 jobs last week to trim expenses as the bank’s revenue
prospects worsen, a person familiar with the matter said.  The reductions included some managing directors, the
second-highest position at the firm after partners, said the
person, who asked not be identified because he wasn’t authorized
to talk. The  New York  Times reported on the cuts yesterday.  Goldman Sachs, the fifth-biggest  U.S. bank  by assets,
employed 32,400 people at the end of March, down from 35,400 a
year earlier, according to the New York-based company’s most
recent quarterly earnings report. The firm is  expected  to earn
$2.29 a share in the second quarter, according to the average
estimate of 25 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. That’s  a decline 
of 42 percent from the preceding three-month period.  Edward Najarian , an analyst at International Strategy &
Investment Group LLC, lowered his estimate for Goldman Sachs’s
second-quarter earnings per share to $1 from $2 because he
expects the firm’s revenue to drop 41 percent from the first
quarter to $5.8 billion, according to a June 3 research note.  Goldman Sachs appointed 261 people to managing director
last year, according to an internal memo obtained by Bloomberg
News. That was a decline of 19 percent from a year earlier, when
a record 321 people were promoted to that level.  To contact the reporter on this story:
