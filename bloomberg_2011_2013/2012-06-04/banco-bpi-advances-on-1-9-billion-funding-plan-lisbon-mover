Banco BPI SA (BPI)  advanced the most in
almost a month after Portugal’s fifth-biggest bank approved a
1.5 billion-euro ($1.9 billion) recapitalization plan to bolster
its capital ratios.  The stock  climbed  as much as 6.6 percent, the biggest gain
since May 8, and traded 5.3 percent higher at 40 euro cents at
10:51 a.m. in Lisbon trading.  “BPI’s recapitalization plan was in line with our
expectations and will strengthen the bank’s financial
position,”  Pedro Oliveira , a trader at Go Bulling, said by
phone.  The lender plans a capital increase of 200 million euros,
for which shareholders will have a right of preference, Oporto-
based BPI said today in a regulatory filing. The plan includes
issuing 1.3 billion euros of debt instruments that will be
subscribed to by the Portuguese state.  Portugal committed to inject 3.5 billion euros in  Banco
Comercial Portugues SA (BCP)  out of more than 6.6 billion euros it
plans to use to recapitalize BCP, BPI and state-owned  Caixa
Geral de Depositos SA , the  Finance Ministry  said today in a
statement posted on the securities regulator’s website.  Banco Comercial shares fell as much as 2 percent to 9.8
euro cents in Lisbon trading.  “Banco Comercial’s capital increase is higher than we
expected and is weighing on the bank’s shares,” said Oliveira.  To contact the reporter on this story:
