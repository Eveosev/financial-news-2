Crude-oil options volatility was
little changed as underlying futures rose for the first time in
five days.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
July, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 40.63 percent at 4:35 p.m. on the  New
York Mercantile Exchange . Volatility was 40.56 on June 1, the
highest level for the front-month contract since Oct. 20.  “The market is catching its breath and some people wanted
to take profit,” said Fred Rigolini, vice president of
Paramount Options Inc. in  New York .  Crude oil for July delivery rose 75 cents to settle at
$83.98 a barrel on the Nymex, after settling on June 1 at the
lowest settlement since Oct. 7.  Futures climbed as the dollar slipped a second day against
the euro, increasing the investment appeal of commodities.  The most active oil options in electronic trading today
were July $75 puts, which fell 38 cents to 23 cents a barrel at
4:41 p.m. with 2,784 lots trading. July $80 puts were the
second-most active options with 2,572 lots changing hands as
they declined 70 cents to 83 cents.  Puts accounted for 56 percent of electronic trading volume,
and four of the five most-active options were bearish. One
contract covers 1,000 barrels of crude.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on floor
trading, where the bulk of options trading occurs.  Bearish bets accounted for 76 percent of the 430,840 trades
in the previous session. December $70 puts were the most
actively traded, with 41,501 lots changing hands. They rose $1
to $3.22 a barrel. The next-most active options, December $72
puts, rose $1.09 to $3.71 on volume of 38,450.  Open interest was highest for December $80 puts with 50,512
contracts. Next were December $70 puts with 40,090 lots and
December $150 calls with 36005.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
