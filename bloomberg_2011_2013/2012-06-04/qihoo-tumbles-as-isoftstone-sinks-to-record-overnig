Technology companies led Chinese
stock traded in New York lower on concern retail and industrial
output data due this week may provide further proof that the
world’s second-largest economy is growing at a slower pace.  The  Bloomberg China-US Equity Index (CH55BN)  of the most-traded
Chinese companies in the U.S. fell 0.6 percent to 86.71
yesterday in New York, after tumbling 16 percent in the last
five weeks.  ISoftStone Holdings Ltd. (ISS)  sank to a record low and
Qihoo 360 Technology Co. fell to the weakest price in three
months.  Huaneng Power International Inc. (600011) ,  China ’s largest
electricity producer, traded at the widest discount to the  Hong
Kong  stock since Nov. 9.  Economic data expected this week may indicate slower
increases in consumer prices and industrial production in May,
according to Bloomberg surveys of economists. The reports come
as JPMorgan Chase & Co. cut its 2012 economic growth forecast
for China twice in a month and now estimates an expansion of 7.7
percent, down from 9.2 percent in 2011.  Europe ’s debt crisis and
slower growth in the U.S. wiped more than $4 trillion from
equity markets worldwide last month.  “If Chinese numbers are weaker than expected, then we
should expect the trend down in Chinese stocks to continue,”
 Alec Young , a global equity strategist at S&P Capital IQ Work in
New York, said by phone yesterday. “Currently, the trends are
down across the board. Our recommendations are to remain in cash
and remain defensively positioned.”  China ETF Slips  The  iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund , the biggest Chinese
exchange-traded fund in the U.S., fell 0.3 percent to $32.59.
The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  of mainland stocks lost 2.7 percent
to 2,308.55 yesterday, the steepest drop in six months. The
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index of U.S. shares was little changed at
1,278.18, erasing earlier losses as the cheapest price-to-
earnings valuation in six months overshadowed an unexpected drop
in factory orders.  American depositary receipts of ISoftStone sank 7.5 percent
to $5.20, the weakest level since its initial public offering in
the U.S. on Dec. 13, 2010.  The Beijing-based information technology service provider
said in a May 18 statement first-quarter profit declined 37
percent from a year ago to $3.3 million, missing a $4.7 million
average forecast of five analysts in a Bloomberg survey. Its
$4.3 million net income estimate for the second quarter compared
with analysts’  average prediction  of $4.5 million.  Inflation, Industrial Output  China’s  consumer prices  in May, due to be released on June
9, probably rose 3.2 percent, according to the median of 22
analysts’ forecasts compiled by Bloomberg. That would the
slowest pace in three months.  Industrial output  gained 9.8
percent for May, from 9.3 percent in April, the economists
estimated. That would compare with a more than 11 percent
increase in the first quarter. Economists also predict May
 retail sales  to grow 14.2 percent, from 14.1 percent in April.  Qihoo, a computer security software developer based in
Beijing, retreated for a fourth day, falling 3.6 percent to a
three-month low of $18.70.  ADRs of  China Unicom (Hong Kong) Ltd. (CHU) , the nation’s second-
largest mobile-phone carrier, dropped 2.9 percent to $13.12, the
weakest level since August 2010. The ADRs, each representing 10
underlying shares in the company, traded 1.4 percent above its
Hong Kong stock, which tumbled 5.6 percent to HK$10.04, or $1.29
per share.  Price War  China Unicom will focus on attracting third-generation
users by providing smartphones priced at around 1,000  yuan 
($157.1), Shanghai-based China Business News  reported  yesterday,
citing Zhou Youmeng, marketing head at Beijing-based Unicom.
Telecommunications operators are competing for users by
providing subsidies to lower prices of mobile devices, the paper
said, adding  China Telecom Corp. (CHA)  started a 99-yuan monthly plan
offering 3G phone for free.  Marvin Lo at Mizuho Securities Asia Ltd. yesterday cut the
price target for China Unicom’s Hong Kong stock to HK$8, from
HK$9.70, maintaining an underperform recommendation on the
company.  China Telecom, the nation’s third-largest wireless
operator, also fell for a fourth day, slipping 1.2 percent to a
two-year low of $42.83.  China’s non-manufacturing purchasing managers’ index fell
to 55.2 in May from 56.1 in April, the National Bureau of
Statistics and China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing said
June 3. That’s the lowest reading since March 2011 when the
federation started seasonally adjusting the data. A Chinese
manufacturing index had the weakest reading in five months in
May, the government reported June 1.  Yanzhou Coal Premium  Yanzhou Coal Mining Co. (YZC) , China’s fourth-largest producer,
slipped 1.7 percent to $15.79, the lowest close since October
2009. Its ADRs traded 0.3 percent above the Hong Kong shares,
the first premium in eight days.  “Investors are very concerned that  China’s economy  will be
hit as the global economy is slowing down and its main trading
partner in Europe is blowing up,”  Dave Lutz , head of exchange-
traded fund trading and strategy at Stifel Nicolaus & Co. in
Baltimore, said by phone yesterday.  Economists surveyed by Bloomberg forecast two to three more
cuts in banks’ reserve requirements this year and say a
reduction in benchmark lending rates is likely.  To contact the reporter on this story:
