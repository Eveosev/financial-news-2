Vietnam ’s benchmark five-year bonds
rose on speculation the central bank will cut  interest rates  to
stimulate the economy. The dong weakened the most in a month.  Vietnam’s  economy  may grow 5.2 percent to 5.5 percent this
year, Dau Tu newspaper quoted Minister for Planning and
Investment, Bui Quang Vinh, as saying today. That compares with
a growth target of 5.6 percent to 5.8 percent given by Prime
Minister Nguyen Tan Dung during a May 24 meeting with the  World
Bank . Vietnam’s manufacturing contracted in May for a second
month, according to a purchasing managers’ index released by
HSBC Holdings and Markit Economics on June 1.  “It’s expected the government will try to support
businesses by cutting rates and also by loosening its fiscal
policy,” said Nguyen Duc Hai, a Ho Chi Minh City-based
portfolio manager at Manulife Asset Management.  Five-year bond yields fell four basis points or 0.04
percentage point, to 9.56 percent, according to a daily fixing
rate from banks compiled by Bloomberg.  The dong dropped 0.13 percent to 20,898 per dollar as of
4:39 p.m. in Hanoi, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
That’s the biggest decline since May 4. The  State Bank  of
Vietnam set its  reference rate  at 20,828, unchanged since Dec.
26, according to its website. The currency is allowed to trade
up to 1 percent on either side of the rate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
