Turkey is negotiating to build low-
cost housing in Venezuela in exchange for oil,  Vatan newspaper 
said citing Bulent Gedikli, chief of economic affairs for the
ruling  Justice and Development Party .  Venezuela may pay 650 barrels of oil for every 100 square
meters of housing built, the Istanbul-based paper cited Gedikli
as saying. Venezuelan President  Hugo Chavez  has said the country
needs to build around 2 million homes, Vatan said.  Turkey is also interested in oil-for-housing deals in other
countries including Libya, Indonesia and Yemen, Vatan said
citing Gedikli.  To contact the reporter on this story:
