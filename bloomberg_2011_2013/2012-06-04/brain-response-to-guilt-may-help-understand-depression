People with a history of depression
respond differently than others to feeling guilty, brain scans
show, a finding that may begin to explain how the emotions are
processed by the brain.  Patients who had recovered from depression were more likely
to show activation in areas of the brain associated with guilt,
even when primed with scenarios where someone else was at fault,
according to a study today in the  Archives of General Psychiatry .  A century ago,  Sigmund Freud  proposed that excessive guilt 
was part of depression. Today’s study may point to how the
brain experiences guilt and depression, said  Roland Zahn , a
study author and senior lecturer at the University of Manchester 
in the U.K. Though the study doesn’t say whether added 
sensitivity to guilt causes depression, the imaging may lead to 
new ways to diagnose vulnerability.  “It’s a very subtle change,” Zahn said. “These people
are more prone to overgeneralize guilt, to feel guilty for
everything. But something else must trigger depression, because
when we saw them, they were quite well. Something must interact
with this.”  Perhaps, if these people were to lose their jobs or be
dumped by a romantic partner, they would be more likely to blame
themselves, and less likely to take into account extenuating
circumstances, Zahn said.  “These people may lose hope and think, ‘Maybe I’m a total
failure, I can’t do anything right,’” Zahn said.  Measuring Guilt  The researchers recruited 22 healthy people with no family
history of depression and 25 people who had previously had a
 major depressive episode . They were then asked to imagine they
had behaved poorly toward their best friend, or that their best
friend had acted badly toward them. The people who had
previously been depressed were less able to coordinate brain
regions to become indignant when they were wronged.  Because of the past depression, it’s not clear whether the
abnormal activation was a “scar” from depression, or the
vulnerability itself, said  Helen Mayberg , a neurologist at Emory
University in Atlanta, who wasn’t involved in the research. The
areas implicated are the same ones she’s targeted in her
treatment of depression with deep brain stimulation, she said.  “Depressed people do get into this spin cycle, and I think
the concept is really fantastic, because it’s not enough to just
feel bad,” Mayberg said. “You don’t blame yourself when you
have cancer. But here, the areas of your brain that don’t work
right cause you to blame yourself.”  Seeking Treatments  People who have previously been depressed are more likely
to experience another depressive episode, Zahn said. Knowing how
the brain is vulnerable may help researchers target treatments,
whether through therapy or new kinds of medication.  The next step is to see if imaging can predict whether
someone will have another episode of depression within the year,
Zahn said. He and his colleagues are also considering ways of
seeing if the unusual activation of the  anterior temporal lobe ,
the area affected, can be unlearned, he said.  Mayberg also suggested recruiting people with family
histories of depression who haven’t yet gotten sick to see if
they show similar patterns.  Today’s study was funded by the University of Manchester
and the Wellcome Trust, among others.  To contact the reporter on this story:
