 The Standard & Poor’s GSCI  gauge  of
24 commodities dropped 0.7 percent to 576.85 at 4:21 p.m.
 Singapore  time. The UBS Bloomberg CMCI  index  of 26 raw materials
fell 0.1 percent to 1,413.233.  CRUDE OIL  Oil fell for a fifth day in  New York  to the lowest price in
almost eight months on signs of an economic slowdown in the U.S.
and  China .  London ’s Brent crude dropped from the lowest close in
one and a half years.  Futures dropped as much as 2.1 percent to the lowest intra-
day price since Oct. 7, extending last week’s 8.4 percent
decline after U.S. unemployment rose and payrolls increased less
than the most-pessimistic forecasts.  NATURAL GAS  Natural gas rebounded after forecasts for cooler weather in
the eastern U.S. pulled futures to a four-week low in New York.  OIL PRODUCTS  Singapore gasoil swaps for July declined $2.31, or 2.1
percent, to $110.55 a barrel, PVM data showed. The premium of
gasoil to Dubai crude was at $15.80 a barrel, down 6 cents.  Jet fuel traded at a premium of 85 cents a barrel to
gasoil, down 5 cents. This spread, also known as the regrade,
increased threefold in May, signaling it is more profitable to
make  aviation fuel  compared with a month earlier.  Naphtha swaps for July dropped $5, or 0.6 percent, to $785
a ton, PVM data showed. Japan naphtha’s premium to London-traded
Brent crude futures rose $1.48, or 3.1 percent, to $49.91 a ton,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Singapore fuel oil’s discount to Dubai crude, a measure of
refining losses from making the fuel, widened to $1.25 a metric
ton at 10:13 a.m. Singapore time from $1.09 on June 1, according
to data from PVM Oil Associates Ltd. The spread is at the widest
since May 29.  PRECIOUS METALS  Gold declined, after rising the most in more than three
years, as some investors sold the metal to raise cash following
losses in equities and other commodities. Silver, platinum and
palladium retreated.  Immediate-delivery gold fell as much as 0.6 percent to
$1,614.88 ounce and was at $1,619.15 at 3:13 p.m. in Singapore.
Bullion climbed 4.1 percent on June 1, the most since January
2009, after worse-than-expected U.S. jobs data increased
speculation the  Federal Reserve  may take steps to boost growth.  Cash platinum fell for the first time in three days,
dropping as much as 1 percent to $1,430.75 an ounce, before
trading at $1,434.25. One ounce of platinum bought as little as
0.8807 ounce of gold today, the least since Jan. 10, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  BASE METALS  Copper declined to the lowest in more than five months in
New York after data from the U.S. and China fueled concern that
demand was slowing in the two largest users.  GRAINS, SOFT COMMODITIES  Corn rallied on concerns that the dry weather in parts of
the Midwest, the largest growing region in the U.S., may cut
yields and derail efforts to boost production to a record in the
world’s biggest exporter.  The July-delivery contract climbed as much as 2 percent to
$5.625 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade and traded at
$5.6225 at 3:52 p.m. Singapore time. Futures tumbled to an 18-
month low of $5.51 on June 1 as economic data from  Europe ,  Asia 
and the U.S. indicated commodity demand will ebb.  Soybeans for November delivery gained as much as 1 percent
to $12.70 a bushel, before trading unchanged at $12.58. Wheat
for July delivery added 0.5 percent to $6.155 a bushel.  Rubber dropped for a fourth day, tumbling to the lowest
level since November 2009, as weak economic data from the U.S.
and China raised concern that slowing global growth may cut
demand for the commodity.  The November-delivery contract lost as much as 5.9 percent
to 240.3 yen a kilogram ($3,074 a metric ton), the lowest level
for the most-active contract since Nov. 30, 2009. Futures traded
at 240.8 yen at 12:53 p.m. on the Tokyo Commodity Exchange,
after falling 4.4 percent last week for a fourth weekly decline.  Palm oil  dropped for a fourth day to the lowest in seven
months on concern that demand may weaken as data showed signs of
a slowdown in the U.S. and China.  To contact the reporter on this story:
