German companies fear that a shortage
of skilled workers will damp future growth,  Die Welt  reported,
citing a survey by the DIHK Chamber of Industry and Commerce.  One out of three companies sees lack of skilled labor as
the biggest risk to economic growth in the next 12 months,
compared with 16 percent that saw it as a risk two years ago,
the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
