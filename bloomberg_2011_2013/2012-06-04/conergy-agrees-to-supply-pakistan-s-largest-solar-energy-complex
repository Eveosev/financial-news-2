Conergy AG (CGYK) , a German solar-panel
maker, will plan and supply  Pakistan ’s biggest solar-power plant
as the country seeks to increase access to electricity.  The 50-megawatt project at Bahawalpur in the Cholistan
region is owned by DACC Power Generation Co. and the Pakistani
government and will supply 30,500 households with electricity,
Conergy said today in an e-mailed statement.  Total investment will probably be about $170 million to
$190 million, with Conergy’s share at about 60 million euros
($75 million) to 70 million euros, said Antje Stephan, a Conergy
spokeswoman.  The government is seeking to spur investment, create jobs
and expand access to power in a country where some areas can be
without energy for as long as 18 hours a day, Conergy said. The
company, working with developer Ensunt Inc., will supply 210,000
modules and 140 inverters, the Hamburg-based manufacturer said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
