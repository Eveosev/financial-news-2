Posco (005490) , a South Korean steelmaker,
agreed to pay  Anglo American Plc (AAL)  $225 a metric ton for coking
coal in the third quarter, 7 percent more than in the second
quarter, Platts  reported .  The companies signed the contracts today, Platts said on
its website, citing people it didn’t identify. Posco agreed to
pay $162 a ton for pulverized coal, a 5 percent increase from
the second quarter, Platts said.  The quarterly price increases follow coal-supply
“tightness” because of strikes at BHP Billiton-Mitsubishi
Alliance’s mines in Queensland, Platts said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
