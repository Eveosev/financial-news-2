Ethanol futures rebounded from the
lowest level in 20 months on speculation that cheaper prices
will spur demand.  Prices rose the most since May 16 after its two worst weeks
this year, giving blenders an incentive to use more of the fuel.
Ethanol in the U.S. is made from corn and mixed with gasoline to
augment supply and meet federal mandates.  “Anytime you get a 1 in front of ethanol prices, it gets
people to salivating and they want to get some,” said Jerrod
Kitt, an analyst at Linn Group in  Chicago . “Prices got pretty
darn cheap. We finally got a print under $2, which started a
relief rally.”  Denatured ethanol for June delivery climbed 3.5 cents, or
1.8 percent, to settle at $2.01 a gallon on the Chicago Board of
Trade. Prices rebounded from $1.975 on June 1, the lowest price
since Oct. 6, 2010. Futures have fallen 8.8 percent this year.  In cash market trading, ethanol on the West Coast dropped 4
cents, or 1.8 percent, to $2.195 a gallon and in  New York  the
additive decreased 2.5 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $2.055,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in Chicago fell 2 cents, or 1 percent, to $1.98 a
gallon and in the U.S. Gulf, the fuel slid 2 cents, or 1
percent, to $2.055.  To contact the reporter on this story:
