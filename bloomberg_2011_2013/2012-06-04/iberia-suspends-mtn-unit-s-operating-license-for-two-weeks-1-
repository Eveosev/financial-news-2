The Liberia Telecommunications
Authority said it will suspend two operating licenses of
Lonestar Communications Corp. for two weeks because the  MTN
Group Ltd. (MTN)  unit disconnected Comium, another carrier, in
violation of the country’s law.  Lonestar and the public will be notified when the
suspension takes effect so that subscribers can use other
networks, the Monrovia-based regulator said in a statement
handed to reporters today.  The company is taking actions to try to prevent the
regulator from going ahead with the suspension, said Lawrence Bropleh, the company’s spokesman, in an interview today.
Lonestar has not been officially informed of the decision and
hasn’t violated the country’s telecommunications policies, he
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
