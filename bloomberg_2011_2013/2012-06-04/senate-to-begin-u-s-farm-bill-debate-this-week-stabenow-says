Senate Agriculture Committee
Chairwoman  Debbie Stabenow  said the full chamber this week will
begin considering a new farm bill that represents “the most
significant reform in agricultural policy in decades.”  The measure, approved by Stabenow’s panel in April, would
end direct payments to farmers. These subsidies, which are paid
regardless of crop prices, have become a target for
congressional budget cutters. At the same time, the bill would
add to and expand insurance programs to compensate growers for
weather disasters or if commodity prices collapse.  “The era of direct payments is over,” Stabenow, a
Michigan Democrat, told reporters today in a conference call.  The next farm bill also will authorize funding for U.S.
Department of Agriculture programs for the next five years.
Stabenow said her bill would provide $23 billion in “real
cuts” in  government spending  if scored over a 10-year period,
mostly by eliminating direct payments. The current legislation
expires Sept. 30.  The bill is S. 3240.  To contact the reporter on this story:
