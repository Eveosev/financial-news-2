E-Star Alternativ Nyrt. (ESTAR) , a Hungarian
energy company, fell to the lowest in more than three years,
after two of its board members  left  and the company said it is
cancelling a project.  The shares fell 7.7 percent to 1,546 forint by 10:20 a.m.
in Budapest, the lowest intraday level since April 2009.  Csaba Lantos and Konrad Wetzker are leaving the board of
directors, the company said in a statement late on June 1. E-
Star is also canceling a project in  Romania  and may have to end
a second one, it said today in a  separate statement  to the
Budapest Stock Exchange.  The announcement on the board members’ departure is
“unfavorable,” Erste Group Bank AG said in a research report
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
