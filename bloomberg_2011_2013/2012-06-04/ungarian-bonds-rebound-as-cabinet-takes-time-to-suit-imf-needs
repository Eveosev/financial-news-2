Hungary ’s bond yields fell from the
highest in more than seven weeks as a vote on a central bank law
was delayed for more time to reach a consensus with the
 International Monetary Fund  on its content.  The government’s benchmark 10-year bonds gained, cutting
yields seven basis points, or 0.07 percentage point, to 8.982
percent after closing at 9.05 percent on June 1, the highest
since April 10. Hungary’s currency was little changed at 305.22
per euro by 11:16 a.m. in Budapest.  The vote on the central bank law won’t take place today as
originally scheduled, state-run news service MTI said yesterday,
citing Antal Rogan, head of the ruling Fidesz party’s group of
lawmakers. Rogan agreed to move the vote after a request from
Mihaly Varga, Hungary’s new chief negotiator, to give the
government more time to agree on the necessary changes with the
IMF, the European Union and the  European Central Bank , MTI said.
Hungary has failed to start the talks for more than six months.  “The delay in the vote provides a chance to make the law
palatable for the IMF and the ECB and then the formal bailout
talks can finally start,” Peter Karsai, a Budapest-based trader
at Commerzbank AG, and colleagues wrote by e-mail today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
