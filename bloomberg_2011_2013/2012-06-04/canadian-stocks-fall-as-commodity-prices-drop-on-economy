Canadian stocks  declined as financial
shares fell to a five-month low and a rebound in commodity
producers failed to erase the Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite
Index’s retreat.  Royal Bank of Canada (RY)  slumped 0.8 percent as financial
shares in the S&P/TSX declined 0.7 percent.  Research In Motion
Ltd. (RIM)  tumbled 6.1 percent, dropping to the lowest level since
2003.  Suncor Energy Inc. (SU) , the nation’s largest energy provider,
advanced 0.9 percent after tumbling as much as 1.5 percent.
Commodity companies rebounded as the S&P GSCI Index of raw
materials rallied 0.6 percent, reversing a 1.6 percent loss that
had driven the measure to a level last seen in 2010.  The S&P/TSX fell 25.43 points, or 0.2 percent, to
11,335.77. The index dropped as much as 1.3 percent intraday.  “The problem with the Canadian market is very simple: the
more worries there are about a global economic slowdown, the
more problems for countries like ours and Australia that are so
tied to commodities,” Sebastian van Berkom, a  money manager  at
Van Berkom & Associates in  Montreal , said in a telephone
interview. The firm oversees C$1.8 billion ($1.7 billion).
“When commodities go down, we go down more than elsewhere, and
when they rally our market is good again.”  The S&P/TSX dropped 1.3 percent on the final day of last
week after U.S. job growth slowed to a one-year low. The measure
sank 6.3 percent in May, the biggest monthly decline since
September.  To contact the reporter on this story:
