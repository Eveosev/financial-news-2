The  Federal Reserve  and four other
U.S. financial regulators said they agreed to coordinate
supervision of federally insured banks with assets exceeding $10
billion under the Dodd-Frank Act tightening supervision.  The agencies will coordinate examinations and share
information about how the largest banks comply with  consumer
protection laws , the Fed said today in a joint statement. The
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., the  National Credit Union
Administration , the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency
and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau also signed the
 statement .  “These coordination undertakings should lead to greater
uniformity and efficiencies in supervision and help to minimize
regulatory burden on covered depository institutions,” the
agencies said in the statement. The coordination will reduce
regulatory burdens, prevent duplicate efforts and avoid
conflicting directives, the agencies said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
