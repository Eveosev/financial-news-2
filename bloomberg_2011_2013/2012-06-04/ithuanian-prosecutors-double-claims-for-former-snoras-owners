Lithuanian prosecutors doubled the
amount in claims from former Bankas Snoras AB owners  Vladimir Antonov  and Raimondas Baranauskas after additional
investigations.  Authorities estimate the men allegedly stole about 1.7
billion litai ($610 million) by forging documents and accounting
irregularities, the prosecutor’s office in Vilnius said in a
 statement  on its website today. The prosecutors issued renewed
European arrest warrants for the bankers with new claims, it
said.  Antonov and Baranauskas are fighting  Lithuania ’s bid to
extradite them from the U.K. over claims of fraud and
embezzlement at Snoras. The men deny any wrongdoing, saying the
move is a politically motivated campaign of revenge after
Antonov’s media company published articles critical of the
government.  Lithuania’s central bank took over Snoras, then the
country’s third-biggest bank by deposits, in November after
discovering assets reported on the lender’s balance sheet were
missing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
