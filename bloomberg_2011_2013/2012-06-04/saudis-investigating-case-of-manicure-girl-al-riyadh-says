The case of a Saudi woman who was
ordered by the religious police to leave a mall because she was
wearing nail polish is under investigation, Al Riyadh said,
citing Sheikh Abdul Latif al-Asheikh, the squad’s chief.  Asheikh said members of the General Presidency for the
Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice, as the force is
formally known, should have offered the woman advice and then
called their superiors for instructions on how to proceed after
she refused to follow it, al-Asheikh said, according to the
newspaper.  The woman, referred to by the Saudi media as the “manicure
girl,” posted an online video last month of her encounter with
the religious police, who are charged with ensuring that Saudis
and foreign residents comply with the strict interpretation of
Islam the kingdom follows.  To contact the reporter on this story:
