U.S. stocks erased losses as the
cheapest price-to-earnings valuation for the Standard & Poor’s
500 Index in six months overshadowed an unexpected drop in
factory orders.  The S&P 500 was up 0.1 percent at 1,279.75 at 2:38 p.m.  in
 New York  after falling as much as 0.9 percent.  The S&P 500 started the session trading at 12.9 times its
companies reported earnings, the lowest valuation since
November. It dropped 9.9 percent from a four-year high on April
2 through last week amid concern  Europe ’s debt crisis was
worsening and global economic growth was slowing.  Earlier losses in U.S. stocks extended the S&P 500’s drop
since April 2 to more than 10 percent as government data showed
factory orders dropped 0.6 percent in April, pointing to a
deceleration in manufacturing, while  China ’s non-manufacturing
industries expanded at the slowest pace in more than a year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
