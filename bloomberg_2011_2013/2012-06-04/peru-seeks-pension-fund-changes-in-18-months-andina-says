Peru â€™s government expects to
implement within 18 months rules designed to lower private
pension fund fees, Andina reported, citing comments by Finance
Minister Miguel Castilla.  The legislation, which seeks to reduce commissions by
increasing the number of companies that manage pension funds and
spurring competition, will be sent to Congress for approval,
Castilla told TV Peru, according to the state news agency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
