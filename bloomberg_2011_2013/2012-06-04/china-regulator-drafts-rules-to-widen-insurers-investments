China’s  insurance regulator  said it
will broaden insurers’ investment scopes in bonds,
infrastructure, property and overseas markets to boost support
to the real economy and capital-market reforms.  The China Insurance Regulatory Commission has drafted 10
investment rules for insurance companies, some of which are
“basically ripe” for publication, the watchdog said in a
 statement  on its website today.  The regulations also will allow short selling and margin
trading that can “create additional income” for insurers, and
rules on derivatives to help them hedge against stock-market
volatility, the CIRC said without giving details.  The regulator last month allowed insurance companies to buy
exchange-traded corporate bonds that are unsecured, as well as
non-financial company debt and unsecured convertible debt issued
by commercial banks, as the government seeks to expand the  bond
market .  --Zhang Dingmin. Editors: Andreea Papuc  To contact the Bloomberg News staff for this story:
