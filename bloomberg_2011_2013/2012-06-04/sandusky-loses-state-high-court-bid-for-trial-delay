Jerry Sandusky, the former
 Pennsylvania  State University assistant football coach accused
of sexually abusing boys, failed to persuade the state Supreme
Court to delay his criminal trial.  Jury selection is set to begin tomorrow in the Court of
Common Pleas in Bellefonte, Pennsylvania, with opening arguments
slated for June 11. Sandusky, 68, sought intervention from the
state high court after the judge presiding over the trial denied
his second request to postpone, ruling that no other date would
be better.  Sandusky, a former defensive coordinator for  Penn State ’s
Nittany Lions, is charged with 52 criminal counts related to the
alleged abuse of 10 boys he met through a charity he founded for
needy children.  In seeking a delay, Sandusky cited the inability of experts
to attend the trial or be prepared to assist the defense,
including a jury consultant who won’t be available until the end
of July, and the impending surgery of a defense paralegal and
investigator. Sandusky’s attorney Joe Amendola has argued that
lawyers need more time to prepare and review the pretrial
material provided by prosecutors.  Amendola didn’t immediately respond to an e-mail seeking
comment on the  supreme court  decision.  The case is Commonwealth of Pennsylvania v. Sandusky, CP-
14-2422-2011, Court of Common Pleas, Centre County, Pennsylvania
(Bellefonte).  To contact the reporter on this story:
