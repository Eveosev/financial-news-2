German stocks dropped for a fourth
day as concern over a slowdown in China spurred a selloff in
automakers, and U.S. factory orders unexpectedly fell in April.  Volkswagen AG (VOW)  and  Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW)  both
retreated at least 3 percent.  BASF SE (BAS)  lost 1.1 percent after a
report said it may make a major investment in emerging markets
by 2015. Linde AG, the world’s second-largest maker of
industrial gases, tumbled 4.3 percent.  The  DAX Index (DAX)  fell 1.2 percent to 5,978.23 at the close of
trading in  Frankfurt . The gauge has fallen 16 percent since its
high on March 16 amid growing concern that  Greece  will be forced
to leave the euro area and Spanish banks will seek bailouts. The
broader HDAX Index retreated 1.3 percent.  “We are seeing risk-off trading, in a continuation from
Friday,” said Daniel Weston, a portfolio adviser at Schroeder
Equities GmbH in Munich. “There is poor sentiment towards  China 
which is why some luxury stocks such as the automobile sector
have been falling today.”  China’s non-manufacturing purchasing managers’ index fell
to 55.2 in May from 56.1 in April, the National Bureau of
Statistics and China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing said
in a statement yesterday in Beijing. That’s the lowest reading
since March 2011.  The report adds to evidence that the world’s second-biggest
economy is weakening as  Europe ’s debt crisis crimps demand and
government curbs on the  property market  feed through to more
industries.  JPMorgan Chase & Co. last week cut its estimate for China’s
growth for the second time within a month. It now expects the
world’s second-largest economy to expand 7.7 percent in 2012
against a previous projection of 8 percent.  U.S. Orders  Orders to U.S. factories  unexpectedly fell in April,
pointing to a deceleration in manufacturing as the global
economy cools. Bookings dropped 0.6 percent after a revised 2.1
percent decrease in March, the first back-to-back drops in more
than three years, according to a Commerce Department report
Economists had projected a 0.2 percent gain, according to the
median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey.  Spanish Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy  on June 2 added his
voice to calls for a more robust “banking union” in Europe,
lending his support for a centralized system to re-capitalize
lenders.  German  Chancellor Angela Merkel  said the same day that
“under no circumstances” will she accept euro bonds.  Carmakers Decline  Volkswagen, Europe’s biggest automaker, dropped 3.2 percent
to 119.75 euros. BMW, the world’s largest luxury carmaker, slid
3.2 percent to 56.85 euros.  Daimler AG (DAI)  fell 1.9 percent to 34.85
euros.  A  gauge  of automakers was the worst performer of the 19
industry groups in the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  BASF declined 1.1 percent to 53.48 euros. The world’s
biggest chemical company may invest as much as 6 billion euros
($7.45 billion) in  emerging markets  by 2015 amid economic
uncertainty in Europe, Tagesspiegel reported, citing an
interview with board member Michael Heinz.  Linde retreated 4.3 percent to 116.05 euros.  HeidelbergCement, Europe’s third-largest cement maker, fell
3 percent to 33.08.  Deutsche Bank AG,  Germany ’s largest lender, rose 1.1
percent to 27.44 euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
