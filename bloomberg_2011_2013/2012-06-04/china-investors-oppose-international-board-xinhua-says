News about the possibility of foreign
companies listing on China’s stock markets has met resistance
from Chinese investors, Xinhua reported, citing economists and
financial experts.  Eight State Council departments, including the National
Development and Reform Commission and the Ministry of Commerce,
issued guidelines on June 1 that included allowing foreign
companies to list in the A-share market as an important part of
financial internationalization, Xinhua said.  A majority of responses on the Internet were against the
planned international board, because people said supporting
small Chinese companies is more urgent, Xinhua said, citing
Xiang Weida, director of research at Great Wall Securities.  Changes to listing rules and the market system aren’t
complete, and the arrival of foreign companies would make things
more complicated, Xinhua said, citing Huang Sheng, an economist.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
