Morocco  raised subsidized fuel prices
by about 20 percent for gasoline and 10 percent for diesel, in a
move aimed at saving as much as $560 million through the end of
the year, the government said.  “The decision to raise fuel prices will allow the state to
save 4.5 billion dirhams or 5 billion dirhams ($560 million)
over the next seven months,” from a total outlay of 50 billion
dirhams for energy, Energy Minister Fouad Dhouiri said in an e-
mailed statement today.  The increases raised the price of gasoline by 2 dirhams a
liter to 12.24 dirhams while diesel climbed by 1 dirham to 8.20
dirhams, the official Maghreb Arabe Presse agency said
yesterday, citing an unidentified government official.  Morocco imports almost all of its oil.  To contact the reporter on this story:
