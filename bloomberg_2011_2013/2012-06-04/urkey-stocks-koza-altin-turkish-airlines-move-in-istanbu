Turkey’s benchmark  ISE National 100
Index (XU100)  added 0.3 percent to 55,744.29 at the close in Istanbul,
gaining for a second day.  The following shares were active. Stock symbols are in
parentheses.  Koza Altin Isletmeleri AS (KOZAL)  , a gold miner, jumped
the most on record, adding 7.1 percent to 36.10 liras and
bringing its two-day gain to 15 percent. April export figures
released June 1 showed Turkish exports of precious metals rose
to $1.5 billion in the month from $282 million a year earlier.  Turk Hava Yollari AO (THYAO)  , or Turkish Airlines,
gained 0.8 percent to 2.61 liras. The company is dropping its
preparations to bid for Poland’s state-owned carrier Polskie
Linie Lotnicze LOT SA because the deal would contribute little
to its growth plans or shareholder value, the carrier said June
1 after the close of trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
