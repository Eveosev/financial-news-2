Shares of the following companies had
 unusual  moves in  Indonesian trading . Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of the close in Jakarta.  The  Jakarta Composite Index (JCI)  sank for a fourth day, losing
3.8 percent to 3,654.58, the lowest close since Nov. 28.  Bakrie Group-related companies:  PT Bakrie Telecom (BTEL)  , a mobile-phone operator, plunged 13 percent to 245 rupiah,
the steepest drop since May 15, 2009.  PT Bakrieland Development (ELTY) 
, a property developer, lost 13 percent to 84 rupiah, a
three-year low. The Bakrie family has asked for more time to
decide what to do about its $440 million loan from a group of
international lenders, part of which has been due for more than
a month, the Wall Street Journal reported. Three calls to PT
Bakrie & Brothers’ office in Jakarta weren’t answered.  Coal producers:  PT Adaro Energy (ADRO)  , Indonesia’s
second-largest coal producer, sank 13 percent to 1,200 rupiah.
 PT Bumi Resources (BUMI)  , the biggest, tumbled 13 percent to
1,220 rupiah, the lowest close since April 2009.  PT Tambang
Batubara Bukit Asam (PTBA)  , a state-owned coal mining
company, fell 12 percent to 13,250 rupiah. Coal stocks dropped
after China’s benchmark power-station coal price at Qinhuangdao
port declined the most in five months, and after Indonesia’s
Energy Minister Jero Wacik said today that the government plans
to control exports of the fuel to ensure local supply.  Palm oil producers:  PT Astra Agro Lestari (AALI)  , the
nation’s biggest listed plantation company by market value, fell

Technology  (SMAR I), the second largest, retreated 8.6 percent
to 6,400 rupiah. Palm oil futures dropped as much as 2.7 percent

a 3.1 percent drop on June 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
