The U.S. must overhaul its tax system
because lower rates on investment income unfairly punish wage-
earners, Nobel Prize-winning economist  Joseph Stiglitz  said.  “It’s absolutely essential that we have a fair tax system
and one that directs our economic activity to production not to
speculation,” Stiglitz, a Columbia University professor, said
today in a Bloomberg Television interview on “Surveillance
Midday” with Tom Keene.  “If you have a tax system in which people at the very top
pay half the rate of somebody who is working hard for their
income simply because they get their income from speculation,
that’s an unfair system,” said Stiglitz, 69, who won the Nobel
Prize in economics in 2001. “It’s a distorting system. It leads
to lower economic growth.”  Stiglitz appeared to discuss his new  book , “The Price of
Inequality: How Today’s Divided Society Endangers Our Future.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
