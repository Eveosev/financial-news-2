Allen Craig drove in three runs,
including a tiebreaking home run in the eighth inning, as the
 St. Louis Cardinals  beat the host New York Mets 5-4 to avoid a
four-game series sweep this afternoon at Citi Field.  Craig’s two-run homer off Mets reliever Jon Rauch, which
broke a 3-3 tie, came after the defending World Series champion
Cardinals blew a pair of leads earlier in the game. New York
pulled within one run in the eighth inning before Jason Motte
got four outs for his ninth save.  Mets starting pitcher Dillon Gee allowed three runs, one
unearned, and struck out eight in seven innings. Cardinals
starter Kyle Lohse allowed two hits and one run in six innings.  The loss dropped the Mets out of a three-way tie for first
place in the National League East division.  New York  (31-24) is
now 1/2 game behind the Miami Marlins (31-23) and Washington
Nationals (30-22), both of whom are off today.  The Mets rallied twice before Craig’s home run put the
Cardinals up permanently.  Lucas Duda  tied the game 1-1 with a
home run in the bottom of the fourth inning;  Scott Hairston  hit
a two-run homer with the Mets trailing 3-1 in the seventh.  New York outscored the Cardinals 19-1 in the first three
games of the series, included an 8-0 victory on June 1, when
 Johan Santana  threw the first no-hitter in franchise history.  -- Editor: Rob Gloster  To contact the reporter on this story:
