Erste Group Bank AG (RBAG)  rebounded from a
four-month low as Spanish unemployment and bond yields fell,
easing concern the euro area’s financial crisis will spread.  The stock jumped 1.9 percent to 362.8 koruna by 2:15 p.m.
in  Prague , snapping a 5.8 decline in the previous three sessions
to the lowest price since Jan. 18. The  PX (PX)  equity index, in which
Austria’s Erste has an 18 percent weighting, rose 0.6 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
