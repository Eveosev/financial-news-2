An Egyptian-American man who was
among those charged in a case against employees of several
foreign non-governmental organizations was detained upon arrival
in Cairo, the  Interior Ministry  said in a faxed statement.  Sherif Mansour was among the 43 NGO employees who were
being tried on grounds that the organizations were operating
without the necessary local licenses, the ministry said late
yesterday. The case, which began in February and included 16
Americans, strained relations between  Egypt  and the U.S.  Egyptian authorities had issued arrest orders for the
defendants, who included Sam LaHood, the son of U.S.
Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood. Most of the Americans were
abroad at the time of the trial and the six who were in the
country were allowed to leave after posting bail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
