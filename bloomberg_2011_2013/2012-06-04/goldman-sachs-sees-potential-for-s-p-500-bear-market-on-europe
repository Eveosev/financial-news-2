An intensifying financial crisis in
 Spain  or elsewhere in  Europe  has the potential to drive American
stocks into a bear market,  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) ’s chief U.S.
equity strategist said.  While  David Kostin ’s mid-year forecast for the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index calls for a 3.7 percent gain from last week’s
close to 1,325, he said the measure may fall to 1,125 should the
situation in Europe worsen. That would give the S&P 500 a more-
than 20 percent loss since its 2012 closing peak of 1,419.04.  The June 1 report from Goldman Sachs said the most likely
scenario is Greek elections result in the nation remaining in
the  euro zone . Concern it will leave has helped drag the S&P 500
down 10 percent since April 2, including the biggest monthly
decline since September. “Financial contagion or crisis in
Spain” could prompt a  bear market  drop of 20 percent, according
to the report.  Goldman Sachs also predicted a Greek exit from the euro
zone area could push the  Stoxx Europe 600 (SXXP)  Index down a further
3.8 percent to 225 and a policy response considered not credible
or bank disruptions in other countries may send the European
gauge to its 2009 low of 158.  Peter Oppenheimer , the London-based chief global equity
strategist at Goldman Sachs, reduced his three-month forecast
for the Stoxx Europe 600 by 5.8 percent to 245 last week. The
European measure slid 0.5 percent to 233.87 today.  Three Events  Kostin said investors face three upcoming macro events that
may add uncertainty: the second round of Greek elections on June
17, the  Federal Open Market Committee ’s June meeting and the
U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling on health-care reform.  The  S&P 500  has found “valuation support” around 11 times
estimated earnings in previous crises, according to Kostin. The
measure has not remained lower than a multiple of 11 for longer
than a month since the late 1980s, including during October 2008
and September 2011, he said. The  U.S. index  currently trades at
12.1 times analysts’ projected profits in the next year, while
the Stoxx Europe has a multiple of 9.7, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Barclays Plc’s Barry Knapp predicts the S&P 500 may fall to
between 1,100 and 1,200 based on historic equity risk premium
levels, which looks at forward earnings yield minus the real 10-
year Treasury yield.  ‘Quite Significant’  The benchmark gauge erased as much as 16 percent and 19
percent in 2010 and 2011 respectively as economic data weakened
and investor concern about a double-dip recession grew. A Labor
Department report last week showed payrolls climbed by 69,000
last month, less than the most-pessimistic forecast in a
Bloomberg News survey, after a revised 77,000 gain in April. Two
months of payroll gains below 100,000 “significantly” boosts
the likelihood of a third consecutive double-dip scare,
according to Knapp’s report.  “There is little room for optimism in this morning’s
report,” Knapp, the New York-based head of equity strategy,
wrote in the June 1 note after the release of the payrolls data.
“Although the equity market has cheapened considerably, it is
not close to last year’s levels from a risk premium perspective
and if the uptrend in the equity risk premium continues, the
market’s fall may be quite significant.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
