Corning Inc. (GLW) , the maker of glass used
in devices made by  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  and Samsung Electronics Co.,
released flexible ultra-thin glass that it expects to see in
consumer electronics by next year.  Corning sent out samples of the glass to makers of phones,
tablets and televisions today. The glass, which can be wrapped
around a device or structure, can be manufactured in a roll,
similar to how newsprint is produced, and will support thinner
displays, Corning Chief Financial Officer James Flaws said.  “We’re hopeful that by 2013, just a short 7 months away,
it’ll be available in consumer products,” Flaws said in an
interview today in New York. “There’s a revolution coming in
new types of displays -- displays will be more conformable.”  As electronics screens become sharper, Corning is trying to
capture market share from plastics makers and other glass
makers. Apple’s retina display for the new iPad tablet, for
example, is an indication of the quality device makers are
aiming for in smartphones, televisions and other tablets, Flaws
said.  Shares of the Corning, New York-based company fell 2
percent to $12.36 at 11:34 a.m. in  New York . The stock has
slipped 4.9 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
