Agco Corp. (AGCO)  plans to pay its first
dividend in 22 years this year,  Financial Times Deutschland

will pay shareholders $0.50 a share, Richenhagen told the German
newspaper. Richenhagen also plans to start a share buyback
program to make the stock “more attractive” to shareholders,
Richenhagen told FTD.  To contact the reporter on this story:
