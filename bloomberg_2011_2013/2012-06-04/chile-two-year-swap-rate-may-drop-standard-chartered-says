Chile’s two-year swap rate may fall
to 4.25 percent, strategists at  Standard Chartered  Plc in New
York wrote today in a note to clients.  The two-year rate may drop as the central bank cuts its
target lending rate to 3.5 percent, according to Bret Rosen and
Italo Lombardi. The swap rate increased four basis points, or
0.04 percentage point, to 4.60 percent today. It slid 14 basis
points last week.  Chilean policy makers discussed raising the benchmark
 interest rate  at last month’s meeting before voting unanimously
to keep it at 5 percent, according to minutes of the meeting.  To contact the reporter on this story:
