Serbia ’s central bank sold euros
today to prop up the dinar as the currency continued to slide
against the euro.  The Belgrade-based Narodna Banka Srbije sold 18.5 million
euros ($23.12 million) “to ease excessive daily volatility of
the  exchange rate ,” the bank said on its  website . The dinar
traded at 118.3820 at 11.36 a.m., according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  The National Bank of Serbia has sold almost 1.2 billion
euros this year so far to support the currency, which has been
under pressure from expansive fiscal policies and widening
budget and current account deficits.  To contact the reporter on this story:
