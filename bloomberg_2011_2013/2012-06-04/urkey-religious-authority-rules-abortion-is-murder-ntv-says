Turkey’s Department of Religious
Affairs ruled that abortion is murder and is prohibited by
Islamic law,  NTV reported  citing Mehmet Gormez, head of the
department.  The authority, known as the Diyanet in Turkish, issued the
ruling after Prime Minister  Recep Tayyip Erdogan  said abortion
was murder and that his government was preparing a law to
restrict the practice, according to NTV.  Contraceptive measures are permitted, NTV cited Gormez as
saying.  “It is permissible in a situation in which a child is not
wanted for a husband and wife to take precautions against
pregnancy,” NTV quoted him as saying. “Abortion is prohibited
and is murder. To induce miscarriage or abort are not among the
precautions against pregnancy.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
