Jerome Kerviel ’s appeal against a
guilty verdict holding him solely responsible for  Societe
Generale SA (GLE) ’s 4.9 billion euro trading loss opened today in
Paris.  Kerviel will argue he can’t be held liable for the loss,
claiming his former employer knew he was taking positions that
exceeded his mandate, and that the bank encouraged him.  Societe Generale announced the trading loss in January
2008. Kerviel was convicted in 2010, sentenced to five years in
jail, with two years suspended, and ordered to repay the bank
its loss.  The appeal hearings will take place in Paris over three
days each week through June 28.  To contact the reporter on this story:
