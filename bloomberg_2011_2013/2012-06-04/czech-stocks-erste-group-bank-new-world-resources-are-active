The Czech Republic’s  PX (PX)  stock index
rebounded from a five-month low, rising 0.6 percent to 863.9 at
the close in Prague.  The following were among the most active  equities  in the
Czech market today. Stock symbols follow company names.  Erste Group Bank AG (RBAG)   of  Austria  jumped 2.5 percent
to 365 koruna, after falling to its lowest since Jan. 18 in the
previous session. Lenders were the best stock performers in
 Europe  as Spanish unemployment and bond yields fell, easing
concern that the euro area’s financial crisis will spread.  New World Resources Plc (NWR)  , the biggest Czech coking-
coal producer, climbed 2 percent to 91.3 koruna. The stock fell
11 percent last week, the most since September 2011, to the
lowest since 2009, pushing its 14-day relative strength index to
22 on June 1. Readings lower than 30 suggest in technical
analysis an asset may gain. The RSI increased to 26 today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
