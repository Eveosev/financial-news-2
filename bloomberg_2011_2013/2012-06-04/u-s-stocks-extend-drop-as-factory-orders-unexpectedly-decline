U.S. stocks extended losses as
government data showed factory orders unexpectedly declined in
April, adding to evidence the economy is slowing.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index lost 0.4 percent to
1,272.92 at 10:02 a.m. in  New York , extending its tumble from a
four-year high in April to more than 10 percent.      Factory bookings decreased 0.6 percent after a revised 2.1
percent decrease in March, the first back-to-back declines in
more than three years, figures from the Commerce Department
showed today in  Washington . Economists projected a 0.2 percent
gain, according to the median forecast in a Bloomberg News
survey.  A report last week showing the weakest U.S. hiring in 12
months erased the Dow Jones Industrial Average’s advance for
2012 and pushed valuations in the S&P 500 to 19 percent below
last year’s level.  The increase in the American jobless rate to 8.2 percent in
May compounded signs that the economic recovery is stalling and
sent the benchmark gauge for U.S. equities down 2.5 percent to
1,278.04 on June 1, almost 37 points below its level a year
earlier. The  S&P 500  is trading at 12.9 times profits in the
last 12 months, compared with 15.9 times in February 2011, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
