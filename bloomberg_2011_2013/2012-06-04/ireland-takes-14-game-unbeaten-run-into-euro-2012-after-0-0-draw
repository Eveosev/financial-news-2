The Republic of Ireland will enter
soccer’s European Championship on a 14-game unbeaten run after
drawing 0-0 with  Hungary  in its final tuneup.  Goalkeeper Shay Given returned from a knee injury to play
the first half at Ferenc Puskas Stadium in Budapest last night
and helped Ireland extend its streak with three saves from
midfielder Balazs Dzsudzsak.  Ireland, which hasn’t been beaten since a 3-2 home loss to
Uruguay in March, 2011 opens its Euro 2012 campaign June 10
against Croatia in Poznan, Poland. The 16-team tournament in
Poland and Ukraine starts June 8.  Three teams from Group D at Euro 2012 complete their
preparations today. Co-host Ukraine plays Turkey in Augsburg,
Germany, France hosts Estonia in  Le Mans  and Sweden, which faces
Ukraine on June 11 in Kiev, takes on  Serbia  in Solna.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
