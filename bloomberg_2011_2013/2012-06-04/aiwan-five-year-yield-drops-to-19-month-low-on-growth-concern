Taiwan ’s government bonds rallied,
pushing the  five-year  yield to a 19-month low, as investors
favored safer assets on concern the global economic recovery is
faltering. The local dollar fell for a fourth day.  Official data due June 7 will show exports slumped 5.3
percent in May from a year earlier, according to the median
estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The Taiex index of
shares tumbled 3 percent, the most since November, after the
Cabinet reached an agreement with ruling lawmakers on a plan
that will make wealthier investors and larger shareholders pay a
capital-gains tax. Global funds sold $89.7 million more of the
island’s stocks than they bought today, wiping out this year’s
net purchases, according to exchange data.  “The whole economic outlook is looking quite bad,” said
 Albert Lee , a Taipei-based fixed-income trader at Cathay United
Bank Co. “Yields could test new lows.”  The yield on the government’s 1 percent bonds due January
2017 dropped one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 0.915
percent, according to Gretai Securities Market. It reached 0.909
percent earlier, the lowest level for benchmark five-year rates
since Oct. 26, 2010.  Stock indexes across  Asia  declined for a fourth day after
data showed the U.S. jobless rate increased last month, wiping
out this year’s gains in the  Dow Jones Industrial Average .  Taiwan’s dollar fell 0.4 percent to NT$30.05 against its
U.S. counterpart, according to Taipei Forex Inc. It touched
NT$30.066, the weakest level since Jan. 17. One-month implied
volatility, a measure of exchange-rate swings traders use to
price options, was unchanged at 6 percent.  The  overnight interbank lending rate  was little changed at
0.511 percent, according to a weighted average compiled by the
Taiwan Interbank Money Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
