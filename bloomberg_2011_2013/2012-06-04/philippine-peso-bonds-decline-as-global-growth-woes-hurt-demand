Philippine bonds, stocks, and the
peso fell as Europe’s worsening debt crisis and data showing
slower U.S. jobs growth hurt demand for emerging-market assets.  The MSCI  Asia-Pacific Index (MXAP)  of regional shares slumped for
a fourth day as European leaders failed to agree a course of
action to repair the finances of regional governments and banks.
German  Chancellor Angela Merkel  said on June 2 that the
situation for Spanish lenders is “fragile.” American employers
added 69,000 workers last month, the fewest in a year, according
to figures released on June 1.  “The negative movement of Philippine assets, whether in
bonds, stocks or the currency, is because of what’s happening
globally,” said Rafael Algarra, executive vice president of
financial markets at Security Bank Corp. in Manila. “Problems
from Europe to the U.S. have increased  risk aversion .”  The peso slid 0.2 percent to close at 43.482 per dollar in
 Manila , prices from Tullett Prebon Plc show. One-month implied
volatility, a measure of exchange-rate swings used to price
options, fell 25 basis points, or 0.25 percentage point, to 7.5
percent.  The yield on 8 percent government bonds due July 2031 rose
four basis points to 6.1 percent, the highest level since April,
according to Tradition Financial Services. The benchmark
Philippine Stock Exchange Index declined 3.4 percent, its
biggest drop since September.  To contact the reporter on this story:
