Singapore , where 80 percent of the
population lives in high-rise public housing, is toughening
safety laws for maids cleaning windows after the number of work-
related deaths more than doubled.  Employers whose maids clean windows above the ground floor
must install grills and ensure they are locked when cleaning
takes place, the Ministry of Manpower said in a  statement  today.
The employer, or another adult, must be present when the
cleaning is done, it said. The changes take effect immediately.  Nine maids have fallen to their deaths this year compared
with four similar work-related deaths in all of last year, the
ministry said. So-called foreign domestic workers in Singapore
may not be used to high-rise living, the ministry said.  “The new rule will apply to all homes, except for windows
that are at the ground level or along common corridors,”
Minister of State Tan Chuan-Jin wrote in his blog on the rule
changes. Maids “may sometimes be complacent or careless.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
