Canadian natural gas rose from a
three-week low amid forecasts of warmer-than-normal U.S. weather
that may increase demand for the fuel to run air conditioners.  July gas in  Alberta  gained 3.7 percent. Cooling demand in
the U.S. Midwest, the biggest-consuming region for  Canada ’s gas
exports, will surpass normal by 8 percent through June 11,
Belton, Missouri-based Weather Derivatives said. The high
temperature in Chicago on June 9 may be 85 degrees, 7 above
normal, said  AccuWeather Inc.  in  State College , Pennsylvania.  The 6- to 10-day outlook is “opening the door to the next
opportunity for 90 degrees Fahrenheit (32 Celsius) heat in parts
of the Midwest,” Travis Hartman, a meteorologist at MDA
EarthSat Weather in Gaithersburg, Maryland, said in a note to
clients. “The Northeast should start the period near normal but
will also warm to above thereafter.”  Alberta gas for July delivery advanced 7 cents to C$1.97 a
gigajoule ($1.80 per million British thermal units) on NGX, a
Canadian internet market at 4:05 p.m.  New York  time. The price
was C$1.90 June 1. Gas traded on the exchange is shipped to
users in Canada and the U.S. and priced on  TransCanada Corp. (TRP) ’s
Alberta system.  Natural gas for July delivery on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  rose 8.9 cents to settle at $2.415 per million Btu.  Spot gas at the Alliance delivery point near Chicago jumped
14.56 cents, or 6.5 percent, to $2.3788 per million Btu on the
 Intercontinental Exchange . Alliance is an express line that can
carry 1.5 billion cubic feet a day from western Canada.  Spot Prices  At the Kingsgate point on the border of Idaho and British
Columbia, gas surged 12.1 cents, or 5.9 percent, to $2.1795 per
million Btu. At Malin,  Oregon , where Canadian gas is traded for
California markets, prices gained 11.12 cents, or 5.1 percent,
to $2.2744.  Volume on TransCanada’s  Alberta system , which collects the
output of most of the nation’s gas wells, was 16.8 billion cubic
feet.  Gas was flowing at a daily rate of 2.01 billion cubic feet
at Empress, Alberta, where the fuel is transferred to
TransCanada’s main line.  At McNeil, Saskatchewan, where gas is transferred to the
Northern Border Pipeline for shipment to the  Chicago  area, the
daily flow rate was 1.93 billion cubic feet.  Available capacity on TransCanada’s British Columbia system
at  Kingsgate  was 290 million cubic feet. The system was forecast
to carry 1.69 billion cubic feet today, or 85 percent of its
capacity of 1.98 billion.  The volume on  Spectra Energy ’s British Columbia system,
which gathers the fuel in northeastern British Columbia for
delivery to Vancouver and the Pacific Northwest, totaled 2.83
billion cubic feet at 3:05 p.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
