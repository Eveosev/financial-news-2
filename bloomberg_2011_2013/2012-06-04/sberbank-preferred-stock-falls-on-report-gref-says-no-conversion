Preferred shares of OAO Sberbank,
Russia’s biggest lender, fell to a seven-month low after
Interfax reported Chairman  German Gref  signaled the securities
will not be converted into ordinary shares in the near future.  The stock retreated for a second day, losing 2 percent to
55.24 rubles by the close in Moscow, the lowest level since Oct.
11. Sberbank’s ordinary shares slid 0.8 percent to 78.15 rubles,
the lowest level since Nov. 24.  The conversion of preferred shares into ordinary shares is
not being considered right now, Gref said during the shareholder
meeting on June 1, Interfax reported.  “The news is moderately negative for the preferred
stock,”  David Nangle , an analyst at  Renaissance Capital , said
in an e-mailed note today. “Last year, the prefs rallied
following Gref’s comment at the 2011 annual general meeting that
conversion was a possibility.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
