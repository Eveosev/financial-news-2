Reli Assets Holding Co., the state-
controlled custodian of Tanzania’s railway network, said it’s
seeking a developer and operator for a commuter rail service in
 Dar es Salaam , the country’s commercial capital.  The operator will upgrade about 32 kilometers (20 miles) of
existing rail lines crossing suburbs in the city, the company
said today in statement published in the Daily News newspaper.  The development of the network may include rehabilitating
or upgrading the existing track, improving telecommunications
and signaling systems, building passenger terminals and
flyovers, it said.  Dar es Salaam has a population of 4 million people,
according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
