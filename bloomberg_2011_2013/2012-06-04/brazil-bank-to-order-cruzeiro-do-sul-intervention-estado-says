Brazil ’s central bank plans to order
today the intervention in Banco Cruzeiro do Sul SA, removing the
bank’s current management, O Estado de S. Paulo reported,
without saying where it obtained the information.   The deposit insurance fund, known as FGC, is likely to take
control of the bank, the newspaper said. The Brazilian authority
identified 1.3 billion reais ($637 million) in losses in
possible frauds similar to those found at Banco Panamericano SA,
Estado said.   The talks between Cruzeiro do Sul and Grupo BTG Pactual,
which made an offer to acquire the smaller rival, ended on June
2 without an agreement, according to Estado.  To contact the reporter on this story:
