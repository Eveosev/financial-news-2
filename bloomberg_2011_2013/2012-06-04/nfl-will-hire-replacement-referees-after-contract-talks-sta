The  National Football League  will
hire and train replacement referees after talks with the union
representing officials stalled.  The NFL said in a statement that it will “proceed
immediately” with finding replacements for the U.S.’s most-
popular sport, which is scheduled to begin in September.  “Our goal is to maintain the highest quality of
officiating for our teams, players and fans, including proper
enforcement of the playing rules and efficient management of our
games,” the league said.  The NFL said it would “continue to be available” for
negotiations with the NFL Referees Association under the
supervision of the  Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service  in
 Washington . The old contract ended at the end of May.  Mike Arnold, lead negotiator for the referees’ union, said
the NFL ended talks after two sessions with the federal agency
and never intended to work out a fair agreement.  “It is unfortunate that as referees’ responsibilities are
expanded that the NFL would jeopardize player health and safety
and the integrity of the game by seeking amateur, under
qualified referees to administer professional games,” Arnold
said in a separate statement.  The NFL said it offered referees more money.  “We have great respect for our officials and in keeping
with that view have made a proposal that includes substantial
increases in compensation for all game officials,” the league
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
