Gabriel Casillas , formerly chief
Mexico economist for  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) , took the job as top
economist and head of research at Grupo Financiero Banorte SAB,
he said in a phone interview from Mexico City.  Casillas, 36, replaces Alfredo Thorne, who had also worked
as JPMorgan’s top economist. Thorne left Banorte last year and
founded a consulting firm in Lima, Peru.  Banorte, Mexico’s third-largest bank by outstanding loans,
hired Guillermo Ortiz, former governor of Banco de Mexico, as
its chairman in 2010. Prior to JPMorgan, Casillas worked at
Banco de Mexico as a deputy manager of risk management and as
deputy manager of foreign exchange. He was also chief Mexico
economist at UBS AG.  Casillas received his doctorate at  Texas A&M University  in
2004.  To contact the reporter on this story:
