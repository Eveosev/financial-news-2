Bakken oil’s premium to West Texas
Intermediate plunged after  Marathon Petroleum Corp. (MPC)  advanced
maintenance at its  Illinois  refinery and  TransCanada Corp. (TRP) 
planned to restrict some oils on its Keystone pipeline in July.  Marathon will shut a crude unit at its Robinson refinery in
Illinois about June 9, a person familiar with the situation said
June 1. The work was previously scheduled for July, according to
the person.  TransCanada plans to temporarily restrict crudes on the
Keystone pipeline with a Reid vapor pressure exceeding 8.5
pounds per square inch starting July 1, a person with knowledge
of the plans said May 31. Light sweet crudes typically have
higher vapor pressures than heavy oils.  Bakken oil’s discount widened $4.50 a barrel to $12 below
U.S. benchmark WTI at 1:31 p.m. in  New York , according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the cheapest the graded has traded
since March 23.  Syncrude’s discount to WTI widened $3.75 a barrel to $9,
the cheapest the grade has traded since March 22. Western Canada
Select’s discount widened $5.25 to $25 a barrel below the U.S.
benchmark.  Most U.S. Gulf Coast crude grades also weakened. Light
Louisiana Sweet’s  premium  to WTI lost 10 cents to $11.90 a
barrel. Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium decreased 15 cents to
$14.50 a barrel.  Mars Blend’s premium narrowed 35 cents to $9.75. Southern
Green Canyon’s premium lost 25 cents to $9.50. Poseidon’s
premium decreased 25 cents to $8.75.  The premium for  Thunder Horse , a sour crude with lower
sulfur content than Mars, Poseidon and Southern Green Canyon,
widened 40 cents to $11.80 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
