Zimplow Ltd. (ZIMPLOW) , a farm-machinery
manufacturer, bought 16 percent of  Tractive Power Holdings Ltd. (TPHL) 
for $3 million, the state-controlled  Herald  reported, citing
officials it didn’t identify.  The stock was bought an 8 percent discount to the June 1
closing price of $0.12 a share, the Harare-based Herald said.
The Tractive Power shares were part of the Zimbabwean central
bank’s 59 percent stake in the company, the newspaper reported.
The sale will pay some central bank debts, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
