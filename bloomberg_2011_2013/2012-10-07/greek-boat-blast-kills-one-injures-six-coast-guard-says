An explosion in a small replica
cannon on a Greek tour boat killed the 51-year-old captain and
slightly injured six others, the  Hellenic Coast Guard  said.  The explosion happened when the cannon was fired as the
vessel was anchored in the entrance to Mandraki harbor on the
island of Kos after returning from an excursion, according to a
 statement  yesterday on the agencyâ€™s website.  The boat was carrying 26 tourists from  Belgium , Germany and
the Netherlands. Five of the injured were tourists, the sixth
was a Greek crew member and all were hospitalized. The local
port authority opened an investigation, the coast guard said.  -Editors: Jeff St.Onge,  Bruce Stanley .  To contact the reporter on this story:
