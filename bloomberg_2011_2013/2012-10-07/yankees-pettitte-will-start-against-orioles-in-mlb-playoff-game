New York  Yankees pitcher Andy Pettitte will start in the American League Division Series game
No. 2 against the Baltimore Orioles in the first season since he
came out of retirement.  CC Sabathia will pitch the first game today at Oriole Park,
while Pettitte will be on the mound tomorrow.  “I just told them, whenever they want me to pitch, I’ll
pitch,” Pettitte said on the team’s website. “It’s a long year
and it was a hard-fought year to get here. (The Orioles)
obviously pushed us hard in September, so it should be a good
series and I’m just looking forward to getting after it.”  Pettitte, 40, who finished the regular season 5-4 with a
2.87 earned run average in 12 starts, came out of retirement for
the 2012 season.  Hiroki Kuroda will pitch Game 3 at Yankee Stadium on Oct.
10. If necessary, Phil Hughes would throw Game 4 and Sabathia
would start the final game of the best-of-five series.  To contact the reporter on this story:
