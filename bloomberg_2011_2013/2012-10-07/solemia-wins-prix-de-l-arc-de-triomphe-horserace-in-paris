Solemia won the Prix de l’Arc de
Triomphe,  Europe ’s richest horserace, at Longchamp in Paris
today.  The four-year-old French filly, a 33-1 shot ridden by
Olivier Peslier and trained by Carlos Laffon-Parias, came with a
late challenge to beat Orfevre (5-1) in a photo-finish.
Masterstroke (11-1) was third.  Orfevre was seeking to become  Japan ’s first winner of the
race.  “It’s fantastic, for the yard, for everyone,” Peslier
told reporters after clinching his fourth victory in the race
and the first since 1998.  The 5-2 favorite Camelot, winner of England’s Epsom Derby,
faded in the closing stages.  The Arc is Europe’s top race for three-year-olds and older,
over a distance of 1 1/2 miles. It’s worth about $3 million to
the winner.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
