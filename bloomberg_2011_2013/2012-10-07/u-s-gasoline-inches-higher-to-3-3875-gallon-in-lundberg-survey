The average price for regular
gasoline at U.S. filling stations rose 0.37 cent in the past two
weeks to $3.3875 a gallon, according to Lundberg Survey Inc.  The survey covers the period ended Oct. 5 and is based on
information obtained from about 2,500 stations by the Camarillo,
California-based company.  Prices at the pump rose as West Texas Intermediate crude on
the  New York Mercantile Exchange  fell $3.01, or 3.2 percent, to
$89.88 a barrel in the two weeks to Sept. 21. Oil, which has
declined for three consecutive weeks, has risen 16 percent from
the 2012 low of $77.69 on June 28.  Gasoline futures on the Nymex rose 1 cent to $2.9525 a
gallon in the past two weeks. Prices have gained 16 percent from
the year-to-date low of $2.5501 on June 21.  Crude inventories  fell 482,000 barrels in the week ended
Sept. 28 to 364.7 million barrels, according to Energy
Department data. Stockpiles are 8.4 percent higher than a year
earlier.  Gasoline stockpiles  rose 114,000 barrels during the same
period to 195.9 million barrels, the first increase in 10 weeks.
The prior week, inventories sank to the lowest level since
October 2008.  Oil may decline next week as U.S. crude production
increases and as global economic weakness reduces fuel
consumption, a Bloomberg survey showed.  Twenty-one of 38 analysts, or 55 percent, forecast crude
will decrease through Oct. 12. Thirteen respondents, or 34
percent, predicted that futures will gain and four said there
will be little change in prices. Last week, 47 percent of
analysts projected a drop.  To contact the reporters on this story:
