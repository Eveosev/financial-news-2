Tam SA Chief Executive Officer Marco Antonio Bologna said his airline plans to add international
flights out of Rio de Janeiro and cut domestic flights to revive
profit, O Globo reported.  Tam, the Brazilian unit of  Latam Airlines Group SA (LAN) , will
start daily flights to  Orlando , Florida, and Montevideo,
Uruguay, this month and next, the Rio de Janeiro-based newspaper
reported, citing an interview with Bologna. Tam also is
considering direct flights to  Madrid  and more frequent flights
to New York, according to O Globo.  Tam will reduce domestic flight capacity by 7 percent next
year and keep more backup planes ready to avoid regulatory fines
for flight delays or cancellations, O Globo reported. Those
measures will help cut costs and allow Tam to return to
profitability next year, Bologna told the newspaper.  Bologna didnâ€™t immediately respond to a call outside of
regular business hours seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
