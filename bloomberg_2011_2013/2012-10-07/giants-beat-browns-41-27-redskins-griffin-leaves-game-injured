Ahmad Bradshaw ran for 200 yards on
30 carries and Victor Cruz caught three touchdown passes to help
the New York Giants beat the winless Cleveland Browns 41-27 at
MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey.  The Giants (3-2) overcame a 14-0 first-quarter deficit. The
Browns (0-5) scored following a Bradshaw fumble on New York’s
first play from scrimmage, then got another touchdown on their
next possession when Brandon Weedon completed a 62-yard pass to
wide receiver Josh Gordon, who outran Giants linebacker Chase
Blackburn.  In other early National Football League games today, it was
Baltimore 9, Kansas City 6; Pittsburgh 16, Philadelphia 14;
Atlanta 24, Washington 17; and Miami 17, Cincinnati 13.  Redskins rookie quarterback Robert Griffin III left the
game in the third quarter when after getting a hard hit to the
head in the third quarter by Falcons linebacker Sam Weatherspoon
as he tried to run into the end zone on a third-and-goal play
from the Atlanta 3.  He did not return to the game and his status was not
immediately announced by the Redskins. Atlanta improved to 5-0.  New York tied the game at 17 in the second quarter when
Weeden, a rookie from Oklahoma State, threw the ball over
Gordon’s head. Giants’ safety Stevie Brown intercepted on New
York’s 14-yard line and returned it to the Cleveland 40. The
Giants scored two plays later on a four-yard run by Bradshaw.  On the ensuing kickoff, Cleveland returner Joshua Cribbs
fumbled on his own 30; Brown scooped up the ball and returned it
nine yards. Quarterback Eli Manning found Cruz in the end zone
for a seven-yard touchdown to complete a five-play drive and
make it 24-17.  Manning completed 25 of 37 passes for 259 yards and 3
touchdowns with one interception. Cruz finished with 5 catches
for 50 yards.  The Giants’ final score came when rookie running back David
Wilson dashed up the middle on a 40-yard touchdown run with 5:41
left. The drive started when Blackburn intercepted Weeden in the
Giants’ endzone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
