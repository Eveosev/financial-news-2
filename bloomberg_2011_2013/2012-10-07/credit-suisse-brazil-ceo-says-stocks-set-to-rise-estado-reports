Jose Olympio Pereira, head of Credit
Suisse Group AG’s Brazilian operations, said the country’s
 equity markets  will rise through 2013 as falling interest rates
push investors to stocks, O Estado de Sao Paulo reported.  Investors are putting money in real estate stocks because
of industry growth and sales at shopping malls, the newspaper
said, citing an interview with the chief executive officer of
Credit Suisse  Brazil . Foreign investors are leading the
increase, the publication reported him as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
