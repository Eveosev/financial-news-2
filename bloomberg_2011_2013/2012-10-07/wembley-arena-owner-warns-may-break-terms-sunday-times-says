(Corrects headline to state owner of Wembley Stadium may
break loan terms.)  The owner of London’s Wembley Stadium
said a big slide in income or a delay in large payments may
force it to break terms of bank loans, the Sunday Times
 reported , citing accounts filed by Wembley National Stadium Ltd.  The company’s cost of building the facility, home of
 England ’s soccer team, saddled it with 367 million pounds ($592
million) of debt and 21.4 million pounds of interest owed in
2011, the newspaper said. Record revenue of 99.6 million pounds
yielded pretax profit of 83,000 pounds, a result enhanced by a
refund from the local municipal council, the paper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
