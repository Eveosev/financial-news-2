Jim Tracy resigned as manager after
the  Colorado Rockies ’ worst season in franchise history,
surprising club officials and players.  Tracy, 56, who was promoted from bench coach to replace
Clint Hurdle on May 29, 2009, had a 294-308 record with the
Rockies. That included a 64-98 mark this season that left
Colorado in last place in the National League West division and
with the third-worst record in  Major League Baseball .  Bill Geivett, the Rockies’ vice president and director of
baseball operations, said yesterday he was surprised by Tracy’s
decision.  “Jim Tracy is a man that has brought professionalism to
the Rockies organization since 2009,” Geivett said in a
statement released by the club. “However, Jim has decided that
he no longer wants to move forward as manager.”  Tracy, who previously managed the Los Angeles Dodgers and
the Pittsburgh Pirates, has an 856-880 career record.  “Jim Tracy’s resignation is something I truly regret,
since he gave me the chance to play in the major leagues and
prove my talent,” outfielder  Carlos Gonzalez , a 2012 All-Star,
said in a statement. “It has always been an honor to play for
him. I always believed he would have a chance to be with us next
year.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
