New England Compounding Pharmacy,
being investigated in connection with a meningitis outbreak
traced to contaminated steroids used for back pain, issued a
voluntary nationwide recall of all of its products.  The company, also known as New England Compounding Center,
is cooperating with an investigation by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
and a Massachusetts pharmacy board, NECC said in a statement.  The FDA on Oct. 4 identified Framingham, Massachusetts-
based NECC as the pharmacy that supplied the steroid tainted
with a fungus. The steroid, methylprednisolone acetate, was
shipped to facilities in 23 states from July to September,
according to the CDC.  Meningitis  is an inflammation of the lining of the brain
and spinal cord usually caused by an infection from a virus or
bacteria. Ninety-one people in nine states -- Florida, Indiana,
Maryland,  Michigan , Minnesota,  North Carolina , Ohio,  Tennessee 
and Virginia -- have contracted fungal meningitis and seven have
died since receiving injections of the steroids in their backs,
up from 64 cases yesterday, the CDC said in a  statement  today.  Tennessee has reported the most cases at 32, followed by
Michigan at 20 and Virginia with 18, the agency said.  The fungal illness isnâ€™t contagious and can be treated with
medication, the Atlanta-based agency said.  New England Compounding provided a  list  of the products
being recalled on its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
