A powerful blast targeted the

citing Muath al-Shami, an anti-government activist in the Syrian
capital. A second blast hit a security-services office in the
Bab Masla neighborhood, the news channel said.  The blast at the police headquarters was followed by
gunfire that lasted for several minutes, al-Shami said,
according to al-Jazeera.  Syrian state television reported that a car bomb attack
occurred in Khalid bin al-Walid street in Damascus without
