Rookie quarterback Robert Griffin III
was knocked out of the game on a hard hit to the head in the
third quarter and the Washington Redskins lost 24-17 to the
undefeated Atlanta Falcons in the National Football League.  Griffin, a rookie and the second pick in this year’s NFL
draft, was hit by Falcons linebacker Sam Weatherspoon as he
tried to run into the end zone on a third-and-goal play from the
Atlanta 3.  He did not return to the game and his status was not
immediately announced by the Redskins. Atlanta improved to 5-0.  In other early games today, Baltimore won 9-6 at Kansas
City in a battle of field goals; the Steelers sacked
Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Michael Vick three times and hit
him eight more times in a 16-14 win in Pittsburgh; Eli Manning
had three touchdown passes in the  New York  Giants’ 41-27 victory
against the winless Cleveland Browns, and Miami won 17-13 at
Cincinnati.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
