U.S. stock-index futures were little
changed following last week’s rally, while the euro was lower
against the dollar. Oil fluctuated below $90 a barrel after
capping a third weekly decline.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index expiring in
December were down less than 0.1 percent at 1,454.50 at 7:22
a.m. in Tokyo after the benchmark gauge rallied 1.4 percent  last
week . The euro slipped 0.2 percent to $1.3019, retreating from
the strongest level since Sept. 19. Oil was down 0.1 percent at
$89.77 a barrel while gold for immediate delivery was little
changed at $1,779 an ounce.  The  S&P 500  and Dow will mark the fifth anniversary of

percent to reach the peak of 1,565.15 and the Dow needs to
advance 4.1 percent to reach its record of 14,164.53. Better-
than-estimated  earnings  and global central-bank policy decisions
have helped drive a 14 percent gain in the S&P 500 since June 1.  U.S. stocks advanced last week amid better-than-estimated
economic reports. The S&P 500 added 1.4 percent to 1,460.93,
after slumping 1.7 percent in the previous  two weeks . The Dow
climbed 173.02 points last week, or 1.3 percent, to 13,610.15
and reached the highest level since two months after its record
in 2007.  An Oct. 5 Labor Department report showed the unemployment
rate in the U.S. unexpectedly fell to 7.8 percent in September,

to undertake bond purchases “once all the prerequisites are in
place.”  Earnings Season  Investors’ attention will shift to corporate profits this
week, with  Alcoa Inc. (AA)  unofficially starting the earnings season
with the release of its third-quarter numbers on Oct. 9. The
streak of 11 quarters of profit growth in S&P 500 companies is
projected to end as analysts estimate a decline of 1.7 percent
in earnings, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  European finance ministers will meet in Luxembourg to
discuss Spain’s finances and closer banking cooperation. Spanish
Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy  travels to Paris on Oct. 10 for
talks with French President  Francois Hollande . In Greece,
Germany’s  Chancellor Angela Merkel  on Oct. 9 will make her first
visit to the country since the crisis began in 2009.  The  U.S. trade deficit  widened to $44 billion during the
month from $42 billion in July amid higher oil prices, according

before the Commerce Department’s report on Oct 11. Another
report on Oct. 12 may show the Thomson Reuters/University of
