(Corrects application status in third paragraph.)  London  Resort Company Holdings Ltd.
said it’s planning to build a 2 billion-pound ($3.2 billion)
entertainment complex on the Swanscombe Peninsula in Kent,
 England .  Developing the 872-acre former industrial site about 23
miles southeast of London by car would create as many as 27,000
jobs once the complex is operating, the Berkshire, England-based
company said in an e-mailed statement today.  The developer intends to apply for planning permission with
Dartford and Gravesham Borough Councils, with an expected date
for opening the complex in 2018, Tony Sefton, LRCH project
leader, said in the statement.  U.K.-based  Development Securities Plc (DSC) , French cement maker
 Lafarge SA (LG)  and Australian construction firm Brookfield Multiplex
Group make up the consortium backing the Swanscombe project,
LRCH said. LRCH signed an agreement with the licensing unit of
 Viacom Inc. (VIAB) ’s Paramount for a resort in the complex. Other
proposed features of the development include an indoor water
park, theaters, cinemas, live-music venues, hotels and
restaurants, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
