U.S. hedge funds, encouraged by the
European Central Bankâ€™s pledge to preserve the euro, have been
buying Spanish government bonds, the Sunday Times  said , citing
unidentified debt traders.  Foreign investors bought an estimated 25 percent of the
bonds the government sold in September, the newspaper said.
Foreign investors have sold about 80 billion euros ($104
billion) of Spanish bonds in the past year, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
