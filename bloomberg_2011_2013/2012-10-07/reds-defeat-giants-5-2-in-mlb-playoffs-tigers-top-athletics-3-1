Brandon Phillips and Jay Bruce hit
home runs to give the visiting Cincinnati Reds a 5-2 victory
against the San Francisco Giants in the opening game of their
best-of-five National League Division Series.  Phillips, who had three hits, had a two-run homer in the
third inning and a run-scoring single as the Reds scored two
runs in the ninth. Bruce led off the fourth with his homer.  Buster Posey led off the sixth inning with a home run for
the Giants, who added a run in the ninth on a wild pitch. Game 2
of the Major League Baseball series is set for tonight in San
Francisco.  Cincinnati starting pitcher Johnny Cueto got just one
batter out before leaving the game with back spasms. Cueto, 26,
led the Reds with 19 victories this season.  Reds manager Dusty Baker, who led the Giants from
1993-2002, got a 30-second standing ovation from San Francisco
fans when he was introduced before the game. Baker, 63, missed
11 games in late August because of an irregular heartbeat and a
mild stroke.  In the American League, the Detroit Tigers won the opening
game of their division series with a 3-1 defeat of the visiting
Oakland Athletics.  The other two division series begin today, with the  New
York  Yankees playing the Baltimore Orioles in the AL and the
Washington Nationals facing the St. Louis Cardinals in the NL.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
