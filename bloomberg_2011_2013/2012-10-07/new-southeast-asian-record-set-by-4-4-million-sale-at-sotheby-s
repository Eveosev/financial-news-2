Sotheby’s (BID)  said it set a new Southeast
Asian record with the HK$34.3 million ($4.4 million) sale today
of a painting by Indonesian Lee Man Fong.  The work by the Indonesian artist was painted while he was
in Amsterdam in 1951. Entitled “Fortune and Longevity,” it
depicts a traditional Chinese village scene.  The oil on wood panel measures 86 centimeters by 260
centimeters (34 by 102.5 inches) and was purchased by a
telephone buyer after nearly 10 minutes of bidding.  Muse highlights include  Robert Heller  on rock,  Martin
Gayford  on art,  Warwick Thompson  on London stage and  Ryan Sutton 
on food.  To contact the writer on the story:
