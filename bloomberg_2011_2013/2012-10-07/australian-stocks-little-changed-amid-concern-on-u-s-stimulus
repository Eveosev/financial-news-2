(Corrects third paragraph to show only  Japan  markets
closed today.)  Australian stocks were little
changed, with the benchmark index trading close to the highest
level in 14 months, amid concern that a drop in the U.S.
unemployment rate will reduce the length of the Federal
Reserve’s stimulus program.  Bank of Queensland Ltd.  dropped 1.6 percent after Citigroup
Inc. and Deutsche Bank AG cut their recommendation on shares of
the lender.  QR National Ltd. (QRN)  jumped 3.5 percent after
 Australia ’s largest coal-train operator said it would buy back
up to A$1 billion ($1 billion) of its own shares.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific (MXAP)  excluding Japan Index slid 0.2
percent to 443.90 at 10:10 a.m. in Sydney. Australia’s S&P/ASX
200 Index slipped less than 0.1 percent to 4,490.70 . New
Zealand’s NZX 50 Index retreated less than 0.1 percent in
Wellington. Equity markets in Japan are closed today for
holidays. Stock markets in  China  will reopen today after a
weeklong holiday.  Friday’s U.S. jobs data “dampened the mood for equities,”
said Stan Shamu, a market strategist at IG Markets Ltd. in
 Melbourne , a provider of trading service for equities, bonds,
currencies and commodities. “Creating a sustainable recovery in
the jobs market is one of the core principals of the Fed’s
quantitative easing program, and this positive data could mean
QE won’t go on for as long as some hoped.”  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 0.2 percent
today. The gauge closed little changed Oct. 5 after a Labor
Department report showed the unemployment rate in the U.S.
unexpectedly fell to 7.8 percent in September, the lowest level
since President  Barack Obama  took office in January 2009.  The MSCI Asia Pacific excluding Japan Index was valued at
12.6 times estimated earnings on average through the end of last
week, compared with 13.9 times for the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index and 12.2 times for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The Bloomberg China-US Equity Index of the most-traded
Chinese stocks in the U.S. gained 0.5 percent to 93.11 at the
end of last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
