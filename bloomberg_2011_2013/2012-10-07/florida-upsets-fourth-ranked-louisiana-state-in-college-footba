Mike Gillislee ran for two touchdowns
as No. 10 University of  Florida  defeated fourth-ranked Louisiana
State University 14-6 and  North Carolina State University  upset
No. 3 Florida State University 17-16 in college football.  In other games involved top-10 teams on the Associated
Press writers’ poll rankings, it was No. 2 Oregon 52, No. 23
Washington 21; No. 6 South Carolina 35, No. 5 Georgia 7; No. 7
Kansas State 56, Kansas 16; No. 8 West Virginia 48, No. 11 Texas
45, and No. 9 Notre Dame 41, Miami 3.  At Ben Hill Griffin Stadium in Gainesville, Florida,
Gillislee ran 12 yards for a touchdown with five minutes left in
the third quarter and repeated the feat in the final period. He
carried 34 times for 146 yards for the Gators (5-0).  “I’ll take Gilly over anybody,” said Florida coach Will
Muschamp. “If you ask him to block, he’s going to block. If you
ask him to catch the ball, he’s going to catch the ball. He just
is a really, really, really good football player.”  Drew Alleman kicked field goals of 31 and 21 yards to give
LSU (5-1) a 6-0 halftime lead.  Florida’s Jeff Driskel completed eight of 12 passes for 61
yards, while LSU’s Zach Mettenberger connected on 11 of 25 for
158 yards.  At Carter-Finley Stadium in Raleigh,  North Carolina , Mike
Glennon passed for two fourth-quarter touchdowns as unranked
North Carolina State (4-2) fought back from a 16-0 deficit to
hand Florida State (5-1) its first loss of the season in an
Atlantic Coast Conference contest.  Dustin Hopkins kicked three field goals and EJ Manuel
connected with Nick O’Leary on a four-yard scoring pass as the
Seminoles took the lead in the first half.  To contact the reporter on this story:
