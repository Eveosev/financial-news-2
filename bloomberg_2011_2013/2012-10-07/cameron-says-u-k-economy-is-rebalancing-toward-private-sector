Prime Minister  David Cameron  said the
U.K. economy is rebalancing toward the private sector as it
emerges from recession.  “These are tough times for our country,” Cameron told the
 BBC ’s “Andrew Marr Show” today. “It is important our economy
is rebalancing,” he said, pointing to the creation of new jobs
in the private sector.  Cameron said he is determined Britain “is going to make
it” and that his country would stick to its deficit-reduction
plans. He said he cannot predict when the economy will recover.
“I am not an economic forecaster,” he said, adding it is too
early to judge what tax receipts will look like for this fiscal
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
