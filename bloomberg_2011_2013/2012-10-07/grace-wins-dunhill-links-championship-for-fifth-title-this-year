South Africa ’s Branden Grace
collected his fifth golf title of the year after a 2-under-par
final round today at the Alfred Dunhill Links Championship.  The 24-year-old, who will climb to third on the Race to
Dubai money list, finished on 22-under, two shots ahead of
Denmark’s Thorbjoern Olesen. Sweden’s Alexander Noren was
another two strokes back.  The players competed at Kingsbarns, St. Andrews and
Carnoustie in the first three rounds, with the event concluding
today at St. Andrews.  Grace becomes the first player to win four times on the
European Tour the year after graduating from the qualifying
school. He won two home events in January and the China Open in
March. His other victory in 2012 came on the Sunshine Tour last
month, also in South Africa.  For his Dunhill Links win Grace collects a check for
617,283 euros ($805,250), the biggest prize of his career.  To contact the reporter on this story:
