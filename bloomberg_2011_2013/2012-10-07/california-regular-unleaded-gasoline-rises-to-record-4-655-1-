The average price of regular unleaded
gasoline reached a record $4.655 a gallon in  California  today,
22 percent more than the national average of $3.814, AAA  said  on
its website.  The highest average price in the state is the San Luis
Osbispo-Atascadero-Paso Robles metropolitan area at $4.74, up
from $4.709 yesterday and an average of $4.233 a week ago, AAA
said.  San Francisco  was the second-most expensive metro area at
$4.731 per gallon for regular gasoline, up from $4.689 yesterday
and $4.263 a week ago. Both metro areas set all-time records,
the automobile association said.  AAA spokeswoman Marie Montgomery didn’t immediately respond
to a voicemail and e-mail sent by  Bloomberg News  seeking
comment.  Exxon Mobil Corp. and  Valero Energy Corp. (VLO)  are rationing
gasoline deliveries to customers in the state as refinery halts
cut into the state’s supplies, driving prices to record highs.
Valero stopped spot sales in  Southern California  and is
allocating the rest of its deliveries to customers. Exxon is
also rationing to buyers at West Coast terminals.  California’s gasoline markets are particularly susceptible
when refineries have outages because the state is mostly cut off
from the oil-product pipelines spanning the rest of the country,
according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.
Gasoline in California also has its own blending requirements to
reduce smog and it’s difficult to import from other states.  Inventories of the motor fuel on the West Coast, known as
the Padd 5 region, rose 178,000 barrels to 26.6 million in the
week ended Sept. 28, an Oct. 3 Energy Department report showed.
The gain left stockpiles 6 percent lower than a year earlier.  To contact the reporters on this story:
