Advanced Petrochemicals Co. (APPC)  dropped
to the lowest level in almost two months after the Saudi
manufacturer of polypropylene products said third-quarter
estimated profit retreated 26 percent on lower prices.  The shares fell as much as 1.2 percent to 25.2 riyals
before closing at 25.4 riyals, the lowest level since Aug. 11.
The kingdom’s benchmark Tadawul All Share Index slipped 0.4
percent, the most since Sept. 29, to 6,863.30.  “As polypropylene prices, on average, continue to remain
soft in 2012, we are revising downwards our 2012 and 2013 net
income estimates to 321 million riyals ($86 million) and 494
million riyals respectively,” Riyad Capital analysts including
Muhammad Faisal Potrik said in an e-mailed note today. Potrik
cut the share-price estimate 3.1 percent to 31 riyals.  Advanced Petrochemicals’ net income for the three months
ended Sept. 30 declined to 100 million riyals from 136 million
riyals in the year-earlier period, the company said yesterday.
Full-year profit may drop 41 percent to 304 million riyals this
year, according to the mean estimate of eight analysts on
Bloomberg.  Seven analysts, including Potrik, recommend investors buy
the shares, while five have a hold rating on the stock,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The company’s 12-month
dividend yield is 7.3 percent, compared with 5.5 percent for
 Saudi Basic Industries Corp. (SABIC) , the world’s largest petrochemicals
maker.  To contact the reporter on this story:
