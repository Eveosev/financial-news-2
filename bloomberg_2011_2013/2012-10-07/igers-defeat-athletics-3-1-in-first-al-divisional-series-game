Justin Verlander  allowed one run and
struck out 11 batters in seven innings and the  Detroit Tigers 
defeated the Oakland Athletics 3-1 in a Major League Baseball
American League Division Series game.  The Tigers have a 1-0 lead in the best-of-five series with
Game 2 tomorrow at Comerica Park in Detroit. In the National
League game tonight, the  Cincinnati Reds  are visiting the  San
Francisco Giants .  Verlander allowed three hits, including a home run by Coco Crisp leading off the game for the Athletics last night.  “Obviously, that takes the wind out of your sails,”
Verlander said in a televised interview. “It’s like a
heavyweight bout when you get popped in the face in the first
round and it kind of wakes you up.”  Joaquin Benoit pitched the eighth for Detroit and Jose Valverde got a save while striking out two in the ninth.  “I was out of sync early,” Verlander said. “Then I found
my rhythm, my mechanics.”  The Tigers scored a run in the first on a double-play
grounder by  Miguel Cabrera . Omar Infante scored on an error by
Oakland pitcher Jarrod Parker in the third and Alex Avila hit a
solo home run in the fifth inning.  Parker gave up three runs on seven hits while striking out
five in 6 1/3 innings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
