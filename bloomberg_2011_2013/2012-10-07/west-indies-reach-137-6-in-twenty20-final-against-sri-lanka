Marlon Samuels top-scored with 78
runs as West Indies finished on 137-6 in the final of cricket’s
World Twenty20 competition against host nation Sri Lanka in
Colombo.  Samuels hit nine boundaries in his 56-ball innings.  Darren
Sammy , 26 not out, and Dwayne Bravo, 19 runs, were the only
other batsmen to reach double-figures.  The World Twenty20, generally held every two years, is the
championship of the game’s shortest form. The winners will pick
up $1 million in prize money.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
