Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY) ’s plan to
pay a first cash dividend since its 2008 bailout has sparked a
dispute with regulators, the Sunday Times  reported , without
saying how it got the information.  The U.K.’s Financial Services Authority is threatening to
block the payout to shareholders because the authority wants the
lender to preserve its capital to protect against a possible
breakup of the euro area, the newspaper said. Lloyds plans to
pay the dividend in early 2014 from earnings generated in 2013,
according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
