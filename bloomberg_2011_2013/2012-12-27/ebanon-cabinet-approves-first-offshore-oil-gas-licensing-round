Lebanon authorized its first
offshore oil and natural gas licensing round at a cabinet
meeting today as the nation sought to catch up with neighbors
 Israel  and Cyprus in developing fuel reserves.  The qualifying round for companies interested in
participating will start Feb. 1, Minister of Social Affairs Wael
Bou Faour said at a press conference in the capital  Beirut . A
list of qualified explorers will be issued by March 31 and they
can place bids starting May 2, he said.  Exploration will proceed in waters close to those of Israel
and Cyprus, where  Noble Energy Inc. (NBL)  found gas. The Leviathan
field, discovered in 2010 in Israel’s deep waters, was the
world’s largest find of its kind in a decade.  Lebanon, which passed an oil and gas law in 2010 and
appointed a six-member petroleum board last month, faced
political divisions that have delayed action on energy
exploration.  Revenues from oil and gas reserves may help reduce its debt
burden, the largest in the Arab world. The country’s loans
totaled $56 billion, equivalent to 135 percent of its annual
economic output.  To contact the reporter on this story:
