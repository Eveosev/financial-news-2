The Philippine peso fell to a five-
week low after the central bank capped banks’ currency-forward
positions to restrain its advance.  Government bonds  gained.  The limit for non-deliverable currency forwards at local
lenders is 20 percent of capital, and 100 percent for foreign
banks, Governor Amando Tetangco said in a briefing in Manila
after the markets had closed yesterday. Lenders have two months
to comply with the regulation, which will be reviewed after six
months, he said. The peso has rallied 6.4 percent against the
dollar this year, the second-best performance among  Asia ’s 11
most-traded currencies.  “The new policy puts pressure on the  currency market  and
we will probably see some dollar outflows in the coming weeks,”
said Alan Cayetano, head of foreign-exchange trading at Bank of
the Philippine Islands in Manila, the nation’s biggest lender by
market value. “Remittance flows are starting to slow around
this time.”  The peso declined 0.1 percent to 41.19 per dollar at the
noon trading break in  Manila , data from Tullett Prebon Plc
showed. It touched 41.25, the weakest level since Nov. 19. The
peso may fall to 42 early next year as banks unwind their
forward positions, Cayetano forecast. One-month implied
volatility, which measures exchange-rate swings used to price
options, rose 19 basis points, to 4.4 percent.  Earlier this year, the central bank  ordered lenders  to
provide more funds to cover risks on forward transactions and
banned overseas investors from its special-deposit accounts.  The government reported today that it had a budget deficit
of 11.6 billion pesos ($282 million) in November. That took the
11-month shortfall to 127.3 billion, which is less than half of
the full-year ceiling.  The Bureau of the Treasury will auction 120 billion pesos
of bonds in the three months through March, compared with 90
billion pesos this quarter, it said in a statement today.  The yield on the 10.125 percent notes due December 2015
fell 14 basis points, or 0.14 percentage point, to 3.72 percent,
according to midday fixing prices at Philippine Dealing &
Exchange Corp.  To contact the reporter on this story:
