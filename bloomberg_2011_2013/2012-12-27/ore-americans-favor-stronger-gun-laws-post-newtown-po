Stronger gun laws are favored by 58
percent of Americans, the highest percentage in eight years,
according to a national poll conducted after 20 elementary
school students were gunned down in Newtown,  Connecticut .  The results of the  USA Today/Gallup poll  released today
show 58 percent of respondents favor making laws covering the
sale of firearms more strict. That’s the highest level since
2004, when 60 percent favored stronger gun laws. Thirty-four
percent called for weaker laws, the same level as in 2004.  In October 2011, 43 percent favored stricter gun laws while
44 percent said the laws should remain unchanged.  Gallup’s survey is the latest poll indicating increased
support for new gun regulations following the Dec. 14 killings
of six educators in addition to 20 first-grade children. The
gunman also shot and killed his mother and killed himself,
police said.  An ABC News/ Washington  Post poll taken Dec. 14-16 showed 54
percent favoring stricter gun laws and 43 percent opposing them.
In a January 2011 ABC/Post poll, 52 percent supported stronger
laws, with 45 percent in opposition.  The Gallup survey found 92 percent of respondents favoring
background checks of all gun purchasers, including those at gun
shows, and 62 percent supporting a ban on the sale and
possession of high-capacity ammunition magazines. By 51 percent
to 44 percent, respondents opposed a ban on assault weapons.  Vice President  Joe Biden  is leading a White House task
force examining gun regulations and other issues such as mental
health and violent entertainment. The  National Rifle
Association , the leading pro-gun rights group, has proposed
stationing armed guards in the nation’s schools.  The poll of 1,038 adults was taken Dec. 19-22 and had a
margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
