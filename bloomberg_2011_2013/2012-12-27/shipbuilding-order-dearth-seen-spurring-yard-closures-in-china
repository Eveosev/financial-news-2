Shipyards in  China , the world’s
largest vessel-building nation, are at risk of closing after
they failed to secure orders, according to ICAP Shipping
International Ltd.  Thirty-eight percent of yards in the country didn’t get
contracts for new vessels in 2012 and 10 percent have no
deliveries scheduled beyond the year’s end, the London-based
shipbroking unit of ICAP Plc said in a report sent by e-mail on
Dec. 24.  “There is a real chance now that a significant number of
yards will close,” ICAP said. Current prices for smaller new
vessels, known as newbuildings, are loss-making unless shipyards
receive a “considerable subsidy,” it said.  About 30 percent of ships being  built  and expected to be
finished in 2012 didn’t meet completion schedules and “will
likely never deliver” because the owners couldn’t get funding
from banks to pay for them, ICAP said.  A total of 999 vessels worth $72.5 billion were ordered
worldwide in the first 11 months of 2012, the lowest number of
contracts since 1999, according to  Clarkson Plc (CKN) , the largest
shipbroker. China has the most newbuildings on order when
measured by capacity, Clarkson data show.  Shipbuilders delivered 2,286 vessels from January to
November, including 1,052 from China and 443 from  South Korea ,
the second-largest shipbuilder, according to Clarkson.  To contact the reporter on this story:
