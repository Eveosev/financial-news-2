Confidence among U.S. consumers
declined more than forecast in December as the budget debate in
 Washington  soured Americans’ outlook for the economy.  The Conference Board’s  index  of sentiment fell to 65.1 from
a revised 71.5 reading the prior month, figures from the New
York-based private research group showed today. The gauge was
projected to fall to 70, according to the Bloomberg survey
median.  A drop in consumer expectations for the next six months to
a one-year low coincides with mounting concerns about looming
tax increases and government budget cuts in 2013 that threaten
the expansion. At the same time, employment gains, rising home
values, and lower gas prices may keep spending, which accounts
for about 70 percent of the economy, from foundering.  “The sudden turnaround in expectations was most likely
caused by uncertainty surrounding the oncoming fiscal cliff,”
 Lynn Franco , director of economic indicators at the Conference
Board, said in a statement. “While consumers are quite negative
about the short-term outlook, they are more upbeat than last
month about current business and labor market conditions.”  Applications for  jobless  benefits decreased by 12,000 to
350,000 in the week ended Dec. 22, a Labor Department report
showed today. Economists forecast 360,000 claims, according to
the Bloomberg survey median.  Estimates for  consumer confidence  ranged from 62.6 to 79 in
the Bloomberg survey of 66 economists. The measure averaged 53.7
during the recession that ended in June 2009.  Present Conditions  The Conference Board’s measure of  present conditions 
climbed to 62.8 this month, the highest since August 2008, from
57.4 in November. The gauge of  expectations  for the next six
months decreased to 66.5 from 80.9.  The percent of respondents expecting more jobs to become
available in the next six months decreased to 17 from 19.5 the
previous month.  The figures stand in contrast to Bloomberg’s Consumer
Comfort Index, which held close to a four-year high last week.
The comfort index eased to minus 32.1 in the period ended Dec.
23 from minus 31.9 the week before.  To contact the reporter on this story:
