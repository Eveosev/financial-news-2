Former Premier League soccer
champion  Blackburn Rovers  today fired manager Henning Berg less
than two months after hiring the Norwegian.  The ex-Blackburn and Manchester United defender, 43,
joined on Oct. 31 after Rovers removed unpopular coach  Steve Kean 
and tasked Berg with getting Rovers back into the Premier League
after it suffered relegation last season.  Berg enjoyed just one win in his 10 games, leaving
Blackburn 17th in the Championship. Yesterday’s 1-0 defeat to
Middlesbrough was its third in a row.  “This decision has been taken following a very
disappointing sequence of results,” Blackburn said in a
statement posted on its website. Berg, who won the league as a
player with Blackburn and United, had joined on a three-year
contract.  To contact the reporter on this story:
