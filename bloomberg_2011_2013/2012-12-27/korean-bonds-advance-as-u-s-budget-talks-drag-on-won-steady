South Korea’s government bonds rose
on concern time is running out for U.S. lawmakers to avert
budget changes that risk pushing the world’s biggest economy
into recession. The won was little changed.  U.S. stocks fell yesterday as President  Barack Obama 
planned to return to  Washington  before a year-end deadline for
budget revisions needed to prevent more than $600 billion in
automatic tax increases and spending cuts. South Korea’s Finance
Ministry will release its revised economic growth outlook for
this year and 2013 at 10:30 a.m. local time. The  Kospi (KOSPI)  index of
shares declined as overseas funds  sold  more Korean shares than
they bought for the first time this month.  “Bonds are being supported as it’s the last week of
December, making investors worried the U.S. may fail to reach
the budget agreement in time,” said DJ Park, a bond analyst at
Samsung Futures Inc. in Seoul. “Bond yields rose a lot
recently, and we are also seeing some retracement.”  The yield on South Korea’s 2.75 percent bonds due September
2017 declined one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 3.04
percent as of 9:56 a.m. in  Seoul , Korea Exchange Inc. prices
show. The rate rose 13 basis points this month. The one-year
interest-rate swap fell one basis point today to 2.81 percent.  The won traded at 1,072.80 per dollar in Seoul, having
closed yesterday at 1,073.28, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It earlier fell as much as 0.1 percent before
recouping the loss amid speculation some exporters were
repatriating income. This year’s 7.4 percent advance is the
biggest among Asia’s 11 most-traded currencies.  A government report tomorrow may show South Korea’s factory
output expanded 0.8 percent in November from the previous month,
the biggest gain since May. Manufacturers’ confidence rebounded
from a three-year low, according to Bank of Korea data released
today.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves
in exchange rates used to price options, rose 28 basis points to
5.23 percent. It was 13.55 percent at the end of 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
