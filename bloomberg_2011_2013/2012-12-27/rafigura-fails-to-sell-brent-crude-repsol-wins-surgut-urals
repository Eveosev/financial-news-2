Trafigura Beheer BV failed to sell a
cargo of North Sea Brent crude. Vitol Group offered Russian
Urals grade without finding a buyer.  OAO Surgutneftegas,  Russia ’s fourth-largest oil producer,
awarded a tender for two cargoes of Urals to Repsol SA for
loading from two Baltic ports, according to two people with
knowledge of the tender.  North Sea  Trafigura failed to find a buyer for Brent lot B0105 at a
$1.15 premium to Dated Brent, a Bloomberg survey of traders and
brokers monitoring the Platts pricing window showed. That’s the
first time the grade has been offered in over two months.  There were no bids or offers for Forties, according to the
survey. The grade traded on Dec. 24 at parity to Dated Brent,
which was the lowest differential in three weeks.  Reported crude trading typically occurs during the Platts
window, which ends at 4:30 p.m.  London  time. Before the session,
Forties loading in 10 to 25 days fell to 9 cents less than Dated
Brent, data compiled by Bloomberg show. That compares with a
premium of 24 cents on Dec. 24 and is the first time the grade
has been at a discount since Dec. 3.  Brent for February settlement traded at $110.15 a barrel on
the ICE Futures  Europe  exchange in London at the close of the
window, compared with $108.31 in the previous session. The March
contract was at $109.19 a discount of 96 cents to February.  Mediterranean/Urals  Vitol failed to sell 140,000 metric tons of Urals in the
Mediterranean at a discount of $1.35 a barrel to Dated Brent on
a delivered basis to Augusta,  Italy , according to the Platts
survey. That is 20 cents less than the company’s offer in the
previous session, which was also unsuccessful.  The Urals differential to Dated Brent in the Mediterranean
widened 20 cents to minus 79 cents, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. In northwest Europe, the  discount  to Dated Brent
increased 46 cents to $1.27, the data showed. That’s the most
since Dec. 10.  Surgut sold one 100,000 ton shipment each from Primorsk and
Ust-Luga to Repsol, both for loading Jan. 13 to Jan. 14,
according to the people, who declined to be identified because
the information is not public.  West Africa  Qua Iboe blend dropped 6 cents to $2.48 a barrel more than
Dated Brent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Sonatrach, the Algerian state-run oil producer, raised its
official selling price for benchmark Saharan Blend crude for
loading in January to $1.20 a barrel more than  North Sea  Dated
Brent, according to an e-mailed price list from the company.  This compares with a premium of 60 cents a barrel for
December and is the highest since November 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
