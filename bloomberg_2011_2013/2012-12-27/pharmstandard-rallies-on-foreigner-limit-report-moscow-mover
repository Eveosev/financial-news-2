OAO Pharmstandard,  Russia ’s largest
drugmaker, is poised for the biggest gain in three months
following a report the country plans to limit exposure of
foreign pharmaceutical companies to the local market.  Pharmstandard rallied as much as 6.2 percent before trading
up 5.1 percent at 1,639 rubles by 3:35 p.m. in Moscow. The
company’s  global depositary receipts  increased 2.3 percent to
$16.37 in  London . The stock is down 2.1 percent in 2012,
compared with a 5.6 percent advance for Moscow’s Micex index.  The Russian government plans to limit state imports of
foreign pharmaceuticals to stimulate domestic production,
 Vedomosti  reported today, citing draft decrees by the  Economy
Ministry . Foreign drug suppliers, with the exception of
Belorussian companies, may be banned from participating in state
auctions if the Russian list of approved drugs already contains
two or more similar products, Vedomosti said.  Pharmstandard will “benefit from state procurement” as
the company “produces a wide range of third-party products for
its foreign partners,” Ksenia Arutyunova, an analyst at Rye,
MAN & Gor Securities, said in an e-mailed note.  OAO  Veropharm (VRPH) , a Russian drugmaker, added 0.8 percent to
840 rubles. The stock has lost 4.9 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
