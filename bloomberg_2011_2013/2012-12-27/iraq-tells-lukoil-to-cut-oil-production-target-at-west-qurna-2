OAO Lukoil, the Russian  oil company 
with the most assets overseas, said  Iraq  asked it to cut its
production target at the West Qurna-2 project by 33 percent.  Lukoil will aim for peak output of 1.2 million barrels a
day in 2017 rather than 1.8 million barrels a day at the request
of the Iraqi government, Andrei Kuzyaev, head of Lukoil
Overseas, said on Russian state television in comments confirmed
by Grigory Volchek, a company spokesman.  Iraq, a member of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries, or OPEC, is currently not assigned allocations or
quotas for its oil output as the war-torn middle eastern nation
attempts an economic recovery.  The Iraqi request is related to infrastructure issues and a
nationwide reduction in planned output, Kuzyaev said, without
elaborating.  Lower output targets mean Lukoil will have a better chance
of reaching the production levels that trigger compensation
payments, said  Alexei Kokin , an oil and gas analyst at UralSib
Financial Corp. in Moscow, in a research note today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
