The Dollar Index touched a two-week
high as President  Barack Obama  and U.S. lawmakers seek to avert
the so-called fiscal cliff of more than $600 billion of tax
increases and spending cuts.  The 17-nation euro fell against most of its 16 major
counterparts after Italian borrowing costs increased at a debt
sale and a report showed the French economy grew less than
initially estimated. The yen weakened to a 28-month low versus
the dollar after Japanese consumer prices and factory output
declined.  “As far as the fiscal cliff goes, expectations are that a
deal isn’t going to be reached by the end of the year, so that’s
weighing on risk,” Eric Viloria, senior currency strategist for
Gain Capital Group LLC, said in a telephone interview. “What
that means for the dollar is risk-off, Treasury yields lower and
dollar strength.”  The dollar strengthened 0.2 percent to $1.3216 per euro at
5:02 p.m.  New York  time, after rising as much as 0.5 percent,
the biggest gain since Dec. 21. The U.S. currency lost 0.2
percent to 85.96 yen, after reaching the strongest level since
Aug. 3, 2010. The euro dropped 0.3 percent to 113.61 yen.  Dollar Measure  The  Dollar Index (DXY) , which IntercontinentalExchange Inc. uses
to track the greenback against the currencies of six U.S.
trading partners, added 0.1 percent to 79.681 after rising to
the highest since Dec. 14.  The index will rise to 80.6 in the first quarter of 2013,
according to the median estimate of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg. The euro will decline to 1.28 against the dollar in
that span, while the yen will rally to 83, the forecasts show.  Futures traders increased bets that the British pound will
gain against the dollar to the most since February 2011, figures
from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission show. So-called
net longs were 37,321 on Dec. 25, compared with 28,036 a week
earlier.  The pound gained 0.4 percent to $1.6169.  Net-short positions in the euro, or a bet that the currency
will drop against the dollar, totaled 2,549, from 9,736 a week
earlier. Short positions on the yen also decreased, falling to
85,608 from 89,163.  Winners, Losers  South Africa ’s rand has rallied the most against the
greenback of the currency’s major peers in December, advancing
5.1 percent.  Brazil ’s real has gained 4.3 percent, while the yen
has lost 4.1 percent.  This year, the South Korean won has returned 7.7 percent to
the dollar, while  Japan ’s currency has slipped 10.5 percent.  Obama held talks today with House Speaker  John Boehner  and
Senate Minority Leader  Mitch McConnell , as well as Senate
Majority Leader  Harry Reid  and House Minority Leader  Nancy
Pelosi , both Democrats.  Fiscal cliff “is the only story out there other than
dollar yen, which is trading on its own dynamic,”  Greg Anderson , the North American head of G-10 currency strategy at
Citigroup Inc. in New York, said in a telephone interview. “If
the fiscal cliff doesn’t get averted when foreign-exchange
markets are back to full liquidity, let’s say Thursday, Jan. 3,
yeah, I expect the dollar to rally at that juncture.”  The dollar has appreciated 0.1 percent in the past week
among the 10 developed-market currencies tracked by Bloomberg
Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The yen slid 2 percent and the
euro rose 0.4 percent.  Euro Weakness  The euro dropped after  Italy  sold 5.9 billion euros of
bonds. The Rome-based Treasury auctioned 3 billion euros of 10-
year debt at 4.48 percent, up from 4.45 percent at the previous
sale on Nov. 29. It also sold 2.9 billion euros of bonds due in
2017 to yield 3.26 percent compared with 3.23 percent Nov. 29.  French  gross domestic product  rose 0.1 percent in the third
quarter, half the pace estimated on Nov. 15, statistics
institute Insee in Paris said. Data yesterday showed jobless
claims rose for a 19th month in November.  The yen weakened earlier today as economic reports fueled
speculation the central bank will heed government calls to step
up stimulus to end deflation.  Japan’s  consumer prices  excluding fresh food fell 0.1
percent in November from a year earlier, matching economists’
estimates in a Bloomberg News survey. The  Bank of Japan (8301) ’s
inflation target is 1 percent, and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has
said he may change the law governing the central bank if it
doesn’t double its price goal.  The yen’s decline may be disrupted for about a month by the
fiscal cliff in the U.S. as investors seek a haven in the yen as
a  reserve currency ,  John Taylor , founder and chairman of New
York-based currency hedge fund FX Concepts LLC, said in an
interview with Sara Eisen and Josh Barro on Bloomberg
Television’s “Surveillance.”  “I’m now worried,” Taylor said. “I can’t believe these
guys.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
