Gold fell for the first time in five
days as some investors sold the metal amid negotiations between
U.S. lawmakers to strike a budget deal before the year-end.  Spot gold lost as much as 0.4 percent to $1,653.55 an ounce
and was at $1,657.80 at 3:15 p.m. in Singapore. Bullion is 6
percent higher this year, set for a 12th annual gain, as
investors sought the metal as a protection of wealth after
central banks around the world took steps to stimulate economies.  President  Barack Obama  and Congress return to  Washington 
today and have five days to reach a deal to avert more than $600
billion in automatic spending cuts and tax increases from Jan. 1,
known as the fiscal cliff. Treasury Secretary  Timothy F.
Geithner  said he will take “extraordinary measures” to
postpone a U.S. default into early 2013 amid the stalled talks.  “Progress on the fiscal cliff will continue to affect
 market sentiment ,” said Feng Liang, an analyst at GF Futures
Co., a unit of  China ’s third-biggest listed brokerage. “Gold’s
one of the few investments with positive returns this year and
it’s normal to get some” selling at the year-end, Feng said.  Gold for February delivery dropped 0.1 percent to $1,658.40
an ounce on the Comex. Cash bullion of 99.99 percent purity slid
0.1 percent to 332.95  yuan  a gram ($1,660.27 an ounce) on the
Shanghai Gold Exchange, while metal for June delivery on the
Shanghai Futures Exchange rose 0.2 percent to 337.89 yuan a gram.  Cash silver was little changed at $30.0088 an ounce, after
swinging between gains and losses. The metal has climbed 7.8
percent in 2012 as holdings in exchange-traded products rose 9.4
percent this year to a record 18,915.13 metric tons yesterday.  Spot platinum, the best performing precious metal in 2012,
was little changed at $1,538.62 an ounce, up 9.8 percent this
year. Palladium was also little changed at $693 an ounce, 5.8
percent higher this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
