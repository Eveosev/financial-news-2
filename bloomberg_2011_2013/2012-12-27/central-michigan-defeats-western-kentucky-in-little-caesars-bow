Ryan Radcliff passed for 253 yards
and three touchdowns to lead  Central Michigan University  to a
24-21 victory over Western Kentucky University in college
football’s Little Caesars Bowl.  Radcliff threw an 11-yard pass to Cody Wilson with five
minutes, 11 seconds left in the game to rally Central Michigan
to the win last night at Ford Field in  Detroit .  In the first quarter, Radcliff hit Andrew Flory for two
touchdowns to give the Chippewas (7-6) a 14-7 lead. David Harman
added a 50-yard field goal for a 17-14 halftime advantage.  Kauwaun Jakes ran six yards for Western Kentucky’s first-
quarter touchdown and threw a six-yard pass to Jack Doyle for a
score in the second quarter.  The Hilltoppers (7-6) took a 21-17 lead in the third
quarter on a one-yard touchdown by Kadeem Jones.  After Radcliff’s go ahead touchdown pass, Central Michigan
held on when Western  Kentucky  opted to try for a win instead of
a tie and Jakes’s fourth-down pass from the Chippewas’ 19-yard
line with 51 seconds left fell incomplete.  Jakes completed 14 of 24 passing attempts for 199 yards and
one touchdown for Western Kentucky. The Hilltoppers next season
will be coached by Bobby Petrino, who was fired eight months ago
by the University of  Arkansas .  To contact the reporter on this story:
