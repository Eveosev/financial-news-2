they prepare for annual weighting changes in commodity indexes

Group. Large and small investors excluding index funds were net-
short, or betting on lower prices, by 62,668 contracts in the

gaining some support from funds, which held large net-short
positions,” Marcos Mine, a risk manager at the Sao Joaquim da
Barra, Brazil-based mill Usina Alta Mogiana S/A, said by phone
today. “Some investors may also be getting ready for the index
rebalancing early next year, which could give support to sugar
and be a good opportunity for millers to sell.”  Raw sugar for March delivery gained 0.7 percent to 19.18
