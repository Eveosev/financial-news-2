Canadian  stocks  fell a fourth day as
U.S. congressional leaders returned to Washington today to
resume budget negotiations with a deadline to avoid the so-
called fiscal cliff.  Royal Bank of  Canada  and Toronto-Dominion Bank, the
nation’s two largest lenders, retreated at least 0.5 percent as
bank stocks contributed most to losses in the Standard &
Poor’s/TSX Composite Index.  Research In Motion Ltd. (RIM) , which will
begin selling its BlackBerry 10 line of smartphones early next
year, jumped 12 percent to rebound from a post-earnings crash
last week that erased almost a quarter of the company’s market
value.  Bombardier Inc. (BBD/B)  gained 1.9 percent after securing orders
for six jets.  The S&P/TSX dropped 22.42 points, or 0.2 percent, to
12,348.38 at 10 a.m. in Toronto. The equity gauge has gained 3.2
percent this year. The Canadian market had been closed on Dec.
25 and 26 for the Christmas and Boxing Day holidays.  U.S. lawmakers are seeking to avoid more than $600 billion
in spending cuts and tax increases that are just days away from
taking effect. Failure to avert the fiscal cliff will probably
send the U.S. into a recession in the first half of the year,
according to the  Congressional Budget Office .  To contact the reporter on this story:
