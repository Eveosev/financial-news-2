Mazda Motor Corp. (7261)  rose to a more
than one-year high in Tokyo trading after  Nomura Holdings Inc. (8604) 
rated the company as its top auto-industry pick, citing the
improving profitability of new vehicles and a weaker yen.  Mazda, expecting to return to profit after four consecutive
annual losses, climbed 7.1 percent on the Tokyo Stock Exchange
to 166 yen, the highest close since November 2011. The benchmark
Nikkei 225 Stock Average rose 0.9 percent.  “Profitability has improved considerably on new-generation
vehicles with high  fuel efficiency , such as the CX-5 and later
models,” Masataka Kunugimoto, a Tokyo-based auto analyst at
Nomura, wrote in a report dated yesterday. The benefit of a
weaker yen outweighs slowing sales of older models in  North
America  and  Europe , the analyst wrote.  The yen reached a 27-month low against the dollar today on
speculation Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who was sworn in
yesterday, will push the central bank to boost cash infusions
and further weaken the currency. It touched a 16-month low
against the euro.  Mazda has risen 30 percent in the past month in Tokyo
trading, while the yen has depreciated 4.1 percent, making it
the worst performer among 10 developed-nation currencies tracked
by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes.  A one-yen movement against the dollar has a 3.5 billion yen
($41 million) effect on the carmaker’s annual operating profit,
while the same move against the euro will make a 1.2 billion yen
difference, according to Mazda.  Mazda made 71 percent of its cars in  Japan  last fiscal
year, while domestic sales contribute 16 percent of the global
total.  Nomura raised its operating income estimate for Mazda to
96.1 billion yen for the year ending March 31, 2014.  “If the recent yen depreciation trend continues, earnings
could have further upside,” Kunugimoto said in the report. He
rates the shares buy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
