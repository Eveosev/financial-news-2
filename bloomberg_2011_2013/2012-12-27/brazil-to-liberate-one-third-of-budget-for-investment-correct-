(Corrects to say government will liberate one-third of
annual investment amount in first paragraph.)  Brazil ’s government will send a
provisional measure to Congress liberating one-third of its
 federal budget  for investment in 2013, President Dilma Rousseff
said.  The government needs the measure because Congress has not
yet passed the 2013 budget, Rousseff said to reporters in
Brasilia. The country must make infrastructure investment “an
obsession,” she said.  There is no chance Finance Minister Guido Mantega will
leave the government, Rousseff said. The government intends to
lift payroll taxes on more industries, she added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
