A gauge of U.S. corporate credit
risk fell, reversing an earlier increase, on optimism that a
budget deal may be reached as the  House of Representatives 
planned a session on Dec. 30.  The Markit CDX North American Investment Grade Index, a
credit-default swaps benchmark that investors use to hedge
against losses or to speculate on creditworthiness, dropped 0.6
basis point to a mid-price of 94.5 basis points as of 3:49 p.m.
in  New York , according to prices compiled by Bloomberg.  The index earlier in the day climbed as high as 97.5 basis
points as Senate Majority Leader  Harry Reid  said a resolution
before Jan. 1 to the so-called fiscal cliff appears unlikely.  The U.S. House will convene the evening of Dec. 30 as
lawmakers seek to resolve a budget impasse, Majority Leader  Eric Cantor  said today in a message posted on Twitter.  The credit-swaps index typically falls as investor
confidence improves and rises as it deteriorates. The contracts
pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails to meet its
obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A basis point
equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10 million of
debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
