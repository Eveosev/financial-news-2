Crude options volatility was little
changed as underlying futures edged lower while the market
waited to see if a U.S. budget deal can be struck this year.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
February, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a
gauge of options prices, was 25.1 percent on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange  as of 3:20 p.m., up from 24.96 percent
yesterday.  February-delivery crude oil declined 11 cents to settle at
$90.87 a barrel on the Nymex.  Senate Majority Leader  Harry Reid  said the U.S. budget
dispute probably wonâ€™t be resolved before Jan. 1. Reid, a
Democrat, blamed the impasse on House Speaker  John Boehner  and
Senate Minority Leader  Mitch McConnell , both Republicans. The
two sides have failed to reach a consensus on how to avert more
than $600 billion in automatic spending cuts and tax increases,
scheduled to take effect in five days.  The most active options in electronic trading today were
February $85 puts, which fell 5 cents to 52 cents a barrel on
volume of 1,567 contracts at 3:22 p.m. February $80 puts were
the second-most active, with 1,222 lots exchanged as they
declined 3 cents to 16 cents a barrel.  Bets that prices would fall, or puts, accounted for 64
percent of electronic trading volume.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on open-
outcry volume, where the bulk of options activity occurs.  In the previous session, bullish bets accounted for 61
percent of the 74,223 contracts traded.  February $102 calls were the most active options yesterday
with 4,047 contracts changing hands. They rose 3 cents to 10
cents a barrel. February $98 calls increased 13 cents to 28
cents a barrel on 3,670 lots.  Open interest was highest for February $105 calls with
37,305 contracts. Next were February $110 calls at 26,148 lots
and March $70 puts at 25,906.  To contact the reporter on this story:
