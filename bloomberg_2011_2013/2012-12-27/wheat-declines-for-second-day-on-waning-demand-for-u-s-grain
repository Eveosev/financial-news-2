Wheat futures fell, extending a
slump to a five-month low, on signs that demand is waning for
exports from the U.S., the world’s top shipper. Corn and
soybeans also declined.  As of Dec. 13, U.S.  exporters  shipped 12.8 million metric
tons of wheat for delivery in the 12 months that started June 1,
down 13 percent from a year earlier, Department of Agriculture
data show. Importers opted for grain from producers including
Russia and  Australia . Droughts that limited production in those
nations haven’t spurred demand for U.S. supplies yet.  “Everybody thought we were going to run out of wheat a
month ago, and it turns out countries that were supposed to run
out still have wheat,”  Tomm Pfitzenmaier , a partner at Summit
Commodity Brokerage in Des Moines,  Iowa , said by telephone.
“Ultimately, that demand is going to come back to the U.S., but
every week that goes by without that happening, my optimism
fades.”  Wheat futures for March delivery fell 0.3 percent to settle
at $7.7225 a bushel at 2 p.m. on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Earlier, the price touched $7.645, the lowest for a most-active
contract since July 2. This month, the price has tumbled 11
percent, heading for the biggest drop since September 2011. The
commodity has climbed 18 percent this year.  Corn futures for March delivery slid 0.3 to $6.915 a bushel
in  Chicago . This month, the price has dropped 8.1 percent,
poised for the largest decline since May. The grain has climbed
7 percent this year.  Soybean futures for March delivery fell 0.3 percent to
$14.14 a bushel. The price has gained 17 percent this year.  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, followed by soybeans, hay
and wheat, USDA data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
