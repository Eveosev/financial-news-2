China’s money-market rate climbed
for a third day on speculation banks are hoarding cash to meet
year-end  capital requirements .  The seven-day repurchase rate, which measures interbank
funding availability, rose even after the central bank  injected 
a net 117 billion  yuan  ($18.8 billion) of funds into the
financial system. The central bank kept the yields on seven- and
14-day reverse-repurchase contracts unchanged today at 3.35
percent and 3.45 percent, respectively.  “Demand for capital is high in the last few days of this
year,” said Song Qiuhong, a bond trader at Foshan Shunde Rural
Commercial Bank Co. in Foshan, a city in the southern Guangdong
province. “It may decline once the year-end passes.”  The seven-day  repurchase rate  rose 17 basis points to 3.98
percent as of 10:43 a.m. in Shanghai, according to a weighted
average rate compiled by the National Interbank Funding Center.
It has dropped 162 basis points this year.  The one-year swap contract, the fixed cost needed to
receive the floating seven-day repurchase rate, was little
changed at 3.36 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The yield on the 2.95 percent government bonds due August
2017 dropped one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 3.25
percent, according to the Interbank Funding Center.  -- Judy Chen . Editors: Andrew Janes, Anil Varma  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
