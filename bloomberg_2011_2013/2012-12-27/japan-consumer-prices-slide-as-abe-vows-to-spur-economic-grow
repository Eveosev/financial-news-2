Japan ’s consumer prices excluding
fresh food fell 0.1 percent in November from a year earlier.  The number, released by the statistics bureau in Tokyo
today, matched the median estimate of 27 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News.  Shinzo Abe, the nation’s new prime minister, is vowing to
pull the nation out of deflation and spur growth with more
aggressive monetary easing and a 2 percent inflation target.
Industrial production data due today will give the latest
reading on the strength of an economy that contracted for the
past two quarters.  Taro Aso, the new finance minister, says the Bank of Japan
has been too slow in tackling deflation and a “large-scale
budget” is needed to help make progress.  To contact the reporter on this story:
