Copper futures advanced after new
home sales rose to the highest in more than two years in the
U.S., the world’s second-biggest consumer of the metal.  Home purchases climbed 4.4 percent to a 377,000 annual pace
in November, the most since April 2010, following a revised
361,000 rate in October, Commerce Department data showed today.
In  China , the top copper user, profit at industrial companies
rose for the third straight month.  “You have a recipe for higher copper prices with the home-
sales numbers and strong Chinese industrial-profit data,”  David Meger , the director of metal trading at Vision Financial Markets
in  Chicago , said in a telephone interview.  Copper futures for March delivery increased 0.1 percent to
settle at $3.601 a pound at 1:15 p.m. on the Comex in New York.
Yesterday, the price climbed 1.5 percent. This year, the metal
has gained 4.8 percent.  Chinese industrial companies’ profit rose 23 percent in
November from a year earlier to 638.5 billion  yuan  ($102
billion), the National Bureau of Statistics said today.
Urbanization is expected to spur 40 trillion yuan of investment
by 2020, the Southern Metropolis Daily reported on Dec. 25,
citing a draft plan by the National Development and Reform
Commission.  On the  London  Metal Exchange, copper for delivery in three
months rose 1.3 percent to $7,915 a metric ton ($3.59 a pound).
The exchange was closed for the past two days for public 
holidays.  Aluminum, zinc, lead and tin increased in London, while
nickel slipped.  To contact the reporters on this story:
