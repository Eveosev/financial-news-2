Pig prices in  Spain  dropped for a
10th week while those in  France  fell for a fifth and German
prices were unchanged, industry group Interessengemeinschaft der
Schweinehalter Deutschlands e.V. reported.  Hog prices in Germany, the European Union’s biggest
producer, were 1.626 euros ($2.16) a kilogram (2.2 pounds),
Damme, Germany-based ISN wrote in a  report  on its website today.
Spanish prices declined to 1.727 euros a kilogram from 1.733
euros.  “The European slaughter-pig market this week in general is
in a holiday mood,” ISN wrote. “Prices are trending sideways,
as it were.”  Pork accounts for about half of the meat consumption in the
27-nation EU. Europeans will probably eat less of the meat next
year after prices rose and economies slowed, with per-capita
consumption set to fall to 40.3 kilograms in 2013 from 41.2
kilograms in 2012, the bloc forecast in September.  French prices dropped to 1.603 euros a kilogram from 1.605
euros, while the cost of hogs was unchanged in the Netherlands
and  Belgium . In  Denmark , pig prices fell to 1.69 euros a
kilogram from 1.744 euros, the report showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
