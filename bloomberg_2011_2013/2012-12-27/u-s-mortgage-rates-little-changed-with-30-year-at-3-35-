U.S. mortgage rates were little
changed, keeping borrowing costs near record lows after  home
prices  gained the most in more than two years.  The average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage was 3.35
percent in the week ended today, down from 3.37 percent, McLean,
Virginia-based  Freddie Mac (FMCC)  said in a statement. The average 15-
year rate held at 2.65 percent.  Home values are rising as low  interest rates  boost demand
amid a tightening supply of  properties  on the market.  House
prices  jumped 4.3 percent in the 12 months through October, the
biggest year-over-year advance since May 2010, the S&P/Case-
Shiller index of property values in 20 cities showed yesterday.
Purchases of previously owned homes rose to a three-year high in
November, the National Association of Realtors said last week.  “The recovery in sales activity is being built on the
fundamentals of very favorable valuation and affordability
metrics, an (albeit slowly) improving labor market and rising
confidence among homebuyers,”  Paul Diggle , property economist
for Capital Economics Ltd. in London, wrote in a note to clients
on Dec. 20.  Eighteen of the 20 cities in the S&P/Case-Shiller index
showed increases from a year earlier, led by a 22 percent jump
in Phoenix. Detroit followed with a 10 percent gain. Chicago and
 New York  had declines.  The average 30-year mortgage rate dropped to a record 3.31
percent last month, according to  Freddie Mac . The 15-year rate
fell to 2.63 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
