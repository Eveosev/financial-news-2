Rubber rallied above the 300-yen
level for the first time since May as  Japan ’s currency dropped
to a 27-month low on prospects for additional stimulus driven by
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s new government.  Rubber for delivery in June advanced 1.6 percent to 300.7
yen a kilogram ($3,507 a metric ton) on the Tokyo Commodity
Exchange, the highest settlement for the most-active contract
since May 8. Futures have gained 14 percent this year.  The yen slid to the lowest level against the dollar since
September 2010 on expectations that the new government will push
for more cash infusions to bolster the economy. A weaker
Japanese currency makes yen-denominated contracts cheaper for
holders of other currencies, and helps exporters such as  Toyota
Motor Corp. (7203)  boost sales overseas.  The “weakening yen pushed up Tokyo rubber prices,” Gu Jiong, an analyst at commodity broker Yutaka Shoji Co., said by
phone. Rubber also advanced on concern that supplies from key
exporters will decline after  Indonesia , the second-largest
grower, forecast lower production next year, he said.  Output in Indonesia may drop 8.9 percent to 2.77 million
tons next year as the country limits production and shipments in
coordination with other growers, Agriculture Minister Suswono
said yesterday. That would be the first fall since 2009.  Toyota Motor Corp., poised to regain its title as the
world’s biggest carmaker this year, said yesterday that its
vehicle sales may rise 2 percent next year to a record 9.91
million, led by overseas demand.  Rubber for May delivery rose as much as 3.2 percent to
26,135 yuan ($4,190) a ton on the Shanghai Futures Exchange, the
highest price since May 11, before closing at 25,940  yuan .  China 
is the world’s largest natural-rubber user.  Thai rubber free-on-board advanced 1 percent to 98.1 baht
($3.20) a kilogram today, according to the Rubber Research
Institute of  Thailand . The country is the largest exporter.  To contact the reporters on this story:
