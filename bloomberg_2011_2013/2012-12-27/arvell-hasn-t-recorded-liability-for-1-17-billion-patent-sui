Marvell Technology Group Ltd. (MRVL)  hasn’t
recorded any liability in its financial statements for a patent
suit with  Carnegie Mellon University , which was awarded $1.17
billion in penalties by a jury yesterday.  “In assessing the impact of this jury verdict on its
financial statements, Marvell will review the verdict, evaluate
the post-trial motions, and evaluate the likelihood of a
successful appeal,” the company, which makes chips for
computers and mobile phones, said today in a statement.  The jury ordered Marvell to pay the award for infringing
Carnegie Mellon patents covering integrated circuits. The jury
found Marvell’s infringement willful, providing a basis for U.S.
District Judge Nora Barry Fischer to increase the award by as
much as three times, according to a statement by K&L Gates LLP,
the law firm representing the university.  Marvell shares tumbled 10 percent to $7.40 yesterday
following the verdict in federal court in Pittsburgh.  To contact the reporter on this story:
