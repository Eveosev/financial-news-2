White-corn futures in  South Africa ,
the continent’s biggest producer, dropped the most in a week as
rains fell in key growing areas  White corn for delivery in March, the most active contract,
declined 3.1 percent to 2,105 rand ($247) a metric ton by the
close on the South African Futures Exchange in Johannesburg.
That is the biggest one-day drop since Dec. 20 and the lowest
price since June 18.  “The weather is good and we see intermittent rain over
most of the production areas,” Brink van Wyk, a trader at BVG
(Pty) Ltd., said by phone from  Pretoria .  Corn also retreated as the rand strengthened against the
dollar and made imports cheaper relative to locally produced
grains. The rand gained 0.7 percent to 8.5085 for a dollar by
1:52 p.m. in Johannesburg, making it today’s best performer of
16 major currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  Yellow corn for delivery in March declined 2.4 percent to
2,208 rand a ton, the lowest level since June 25. It is used,
together with soybeans, as animal food. Soybeans decreased 0.9
percent to 4,799 rand a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
