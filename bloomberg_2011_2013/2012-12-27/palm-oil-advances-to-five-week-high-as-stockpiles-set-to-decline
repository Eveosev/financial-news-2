Palm oil  rallied to the highest in
eight weeks on speculation rising shipments will deplete record
reserves from this month.  The contract for March delivery rose 2.1 percent to 2,481
ringgit ($811) a metric ton on the Malaysia Derivatives Exchange,
the highest settlement level for the most-active contract since
Nov. 2. The rally pared the year’s loss to 22 percent.  Exports from Malaysia, the largest shipper after  Indonesia ,
climbed 3 percent to 1.29 million tons in the first 25 days of
December from the same period a month ago, Societe Generale de
Surveillance said yesterday. Reserves in Malaysia reached an
all-time high of 2.56 million tons last month.  “End stock should have peaked last month, that’s why we
see palm prices adjusting higher,” said Ryan Long, vice
president of futures and options at OSK Investment Bank Bhd. in
 Kuala Lumpur . “Export for the month has been encouraging and
production is expected to be lower.”  Indonesia cut its export tax on shipments next month to 7.5
percent from 9 percent in December, while lowering the so-called
base price for exports to $709 a ton, Bachrul Chairi, acting
director general for foreign trade, said in a statement today.
Malaysia has set its export-tax rate at zero for January.  Palm oil has advanced 12 percent since dropping to a three-
