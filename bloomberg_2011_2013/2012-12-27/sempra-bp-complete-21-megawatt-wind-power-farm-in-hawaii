Sempra Energy (SRE)  and  BP Plc (BP/)  completed a
21-megawatt wind farm in Hawaii, their fifth project together in
an agreement to build more than 1,000 megawatts of renewable-
power capacity.  The Auwahi Wind farm in southeast Maui will produce power
for the islandâ€™s utility under a 20-year contract, San Diego-
based Sempra said today in a statement. The power plant includes
eight turbines from  Siemens AG (SIE)  and a 10-megawatt battery-storage
system that will help regulate supplies during light winds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
