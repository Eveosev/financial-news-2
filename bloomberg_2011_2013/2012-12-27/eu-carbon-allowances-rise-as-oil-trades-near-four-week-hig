European Union carbon permits rose
as oil traded near its highest price in four weeks, boosting
demand for emission rights.  EU permits for delivery in December next year advanced 1
percent to 7.19 euros ($9.54) a metric ton on the ICE Futures
 Europe  exchange as of 9:17 a.m. London time. Trading resumed
today after two days of public holidays in the region.  Brent crude  rose 6 cents to $111.13 a barrel, after rising
2.1 percent yesterday to its highest close since Nov. 30. Oil
can influence carbon prices because itâ€™s linked to economic
output and to cleaner-burning natural gas in Europe.  To contact the reporter on this story:
