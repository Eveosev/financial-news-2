J.R. Smith hit a contested jump shot
as the final buzzer sounded to lift the New York Knicks to a
99-97 victory over the Phoenix Suns on a night they were without
Carmelo Anthony and  Raymond Felton  because of injuries.  Smith made an 18-foot jumper with 10 seconds left to tie
last night’s game at US Airways Center in Phoenix. After  Jason Kidd  forced a turnover for the Knicks, Smith then took an
inbounds pass from Kidd with just over one second left and
drilled a fall-away 21-footer from the corner over the
outstretched hands of Suns guard P.J. Tucker.  “It was designed for me to get to that corner and we ran
it to perfection,” Smith, who finished with 27 points, said in
a televised interview. “I just wanted to get my shoulders
square to the basket and let it fly. I watched so many Michael
Jordan tapes, it finally worked for me.”  Kidd added 23 points and eight assists for the Knicks
(21-8), while playing 31 minutes at point guard without Felton,
who was diagnosed yesterday with a broken right little finger
and said he may need surgery. Anthony, the second-leading scorer
in the National Basketball Association, sat out last night with
a hyper-extended left knee. Both players were hurt in the
Knicks’ Christmas Day loss to the  Los Angeles Lakers .  “Injuries occur, key guys get banged up here and there,
and the other guys have to step up and play,” Knicks coach  Mike Woodson  told reporters.  Felton said after the game that his injury might keep him
out for four-to-six weeks if he needs surgery. He’ll undergo
further tests upon returning to New York.  Tyson Chandler  and Chris Copeland each scored 14 points for
New York, with Chandler adding 12 rebounds.  Jared Dudley had a game-high 36 points for the Suns, who
dropped to 11-18 on the season.  Lakers Lose  The Lakers had a five-game winning streak snapped with a
126-114 loss yesterday to the  Denver Nuggets , who got 27 points
off the bench from Corey Brewer.  James Harden  scored 17 of his 30 points in the fourth
quarter to lift the  Houston Rockets  to an 87-84 win over the
Minnesota Timberwolves, their fifth consecutive victory. The
Milwaukee Bucks beat the Brooklyn Nets for the 13th time in a
row, winning 108-93 behind 25 points from  Brandon Jennings .  The New Orleans Hornets halted an 11-game losing skid with
a 97-94 win over the Orlando Magic, while the Golden State
Warriors topped the Utah Jazz 94-83 for their ninth win in the
past 12 games.  To contact the reporter on this story:
