U.S. stocks  pared most of their earlier losses in the final hour of trading as the  House of Representatives  planned a session on Dec. 30, fueling optimism a budget deal will be reached.  Consumer discretionary and staples stocks reversed declines, each climbing 0.1 percent among 10 groups in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  Expedia Inc. (EXPE)  rallied 4.1 percent, the most in the benchmark index.  Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  and JPMorgan Chase & Co. slid at least 0.6 percent, pacing losses among financial shares.

His firm oversees $6.5 billion in assets. “Dec. 30 is a Sunday. They’re making all of this extra effort to save the day at the last minute.”  The  S&P 500  has slipped 0.8 percent this week as talks between President  Barack Obama  and Congress dragged on beyond the Christmas holiday.

Treasury Secretary  Timothy Geithner  wrote in a letter to Congress yesterday that the federal debt limit will be reached on Dec. 31 and his department will begin using “extraordinary measures” to finance $200 billion in deficits in early 2013.  ‘Held Hostage’  “The markets remain held hostage to the perceived negotiations in Washington regarding the fiscal cliff,” Jim Russell, the Cincinnati-based chief equity strategist at  U.S. Bank  Wealth Management, which oversees about $113 billion, said in a telephone interview. “It’s our take that there are talks going on and that they’re substantive, but time is growing short.”  Equities also fell earlier today after data showed  confidence  among U.S. consumers declined more than forecast in December as the budget debate soured Americans’ outlook for the economy. The Conference Board’s index of sentiment fell to 65.1 from a revised 71.5 reading the prior month, figures from the New York-based private research group showed today. The gauge was projected to fall to 70, according to the Bloomberg survey median.  Sales of new houses rose in November to the highest level in more than two years, another report showed.
