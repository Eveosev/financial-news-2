India ’s 10-year bonds advanced a
fifth day, the longest winning streak in more than a year, on
optimism debt purchases by the central bank and prospects of
monetary easing will spur demand.  The Reserve Bank of India will offer to buy as much as 80
billion rupees ($1.5 billion) of securities due in 2017, 2022
and 2027 at an open-market auction tomorrow, according to a Dec.
24  statement  on its website. The bank resumed purchases this
month to release funds into the financial system and help ease a
cash squeeze. At a policy review on Dec. 18, the RBI signaled it
will cut interest rates in the coming months, after holding the
repurchase  rate  at 8 percent for a fifth meeting.  “With support from RBI’s monetary- and liquidity-
augmenting policies, amid minimal risk of supply pressure, we
expect the 10-year yield to drift toward 7.75 percent by the end
of next quarter,” Shubhada Rao, Mumbai-based chief economist at
 Yes Bank Ltd. (YES) , said in a research note.  The yield on the 8.15 percent notes due June 2022 was at
8.11 percent in Mumbai, the lowest level since July 25, compared
with 8.114 percent yesterday, according to the central bank’s
trading system. The yield has dropped 46 basis points this year.  Indian sovereign bonds returned 10.5 percent in 2012, the
best performance after Indonesian notes among Asia’s 10 biggest
local-currency debt markets tracked by HSBC Holdings Plc.  Asia’s third-largest  economy  expanded 5.3 percent in the
three months to Sept. 30, matching a three-year low touched in
the quarter ended March.  ‘Growth Threats’  “In view of inflation pressures ebbing, monetary policy
has to increasingly shift focus and respond to the threats to
growth,” the Reserve Bank said in a statement on Dec. 18.  The one-year interest-rate swap, a derivative contract used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, was little
changed at 7.64 percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The
gauge was at 7.75 percent at the end of 2011.  India’s rupee weakened, giving up all of its earlier gains,
on speculation investors stepped up dollar purchases to pay
month-end bills.  The rupee fell 0.2 percent to 54.9375 per dollar in Mumbai,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It has lost 3.4 percent
this year, the worst performance after  Indonesia ’s rupiah among
the 10 most-used Asian currencies, excluding the yen.  One-month implied volatility in the rupee, a gauge of
expected moves in exchange rates used to price options, fell 10
basis points to 10 percent. The measure decreased 200 basis
points in 2012.  Three-month onshore rupee forwards traded at 55.88 per
dollar, compared with 55.79 yesterday, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Offshore non-deliverable contracts were
at 55.82 versus 55.78. Forwards are agreements to buy or sell
assets at a set price and date. Non-deliverable contracts are
settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
