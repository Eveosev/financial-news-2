Wheat futures declined to the lowest
since July in Chicago, extending a three-week decline after a
storm brought snow cover in the U.S. Plains for next year’s crop
and as import demand slowed.  A winter storm in the U.S. this week dumped heavy snow
across the Plains and the Midwest that will protect wheat plants
against frost and provide moisture when the snow melts in
spring. Most of  Kansas ,  Oklahoma  and northern  Texas  was  covered 
in 0.4 inch to 10 inches (1-25 centimeters) of snow as of
yesterday, National Weather Service data show.  “The hard and soft red winter wheat crops could not have
had better weather conditions,” economist Dennis Gartman wrote
in his daily newsletter. “Many of the nation’s wheat growers
have gotten what they’d wanted and needed: snow cover.”  Wheat for March delivery declined as much as 1 percent to
$7.67 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, the lowest since
July 2, and was at $7.715 by 7:50 a.m. local time. Wheat and
soybeans are the best performers on the S&P GSCI Commodity Index
this year, both advancing 18 percent.  Milling wheat for delivery in March traded on NYSE Liffe in
Paris slumped 2 percent to 249.50 euros ($331.31) a metric ton.
Wheat has added 28 percent this year in the French capital.  “Transactions in the physical market logically remain
limited due to a limited number of active operators and the
closure of many elevators in this year-end period,” Paris-based
farm adviser Agritel wrote in a report.  Trading in wheat futures in  Chicago  was about 23 percent
lower than the 30-day average for the time of day, data compiled
by Bloomberg show.  U.S. shipments of  wheat  inspected for export fell 9.1
percent to 15.128 million bushels in the week to Dec. 20, the
lowest for the period since 2009, the U.S. Department of
Agriculture  reported  yesterday. Corn-export  inspections  dropped
18 percent from a week earlier to 13.475 million bushels in the
week, the USDA said.  ‘Weak’ Performance  “The operators continue to be disappointed by the weak
performance of U.S. exports of wheat and corn,” Bourges,
France-based farm adviser Offre &  Demande Agricole  wrote in a
market comment.  Corn for March delivery fell as much as 0.5 percent to
$6.90 a bushel, and traded at $6.9225 recently, paring gains
this year to 7.1 percent.  The amount of soybeans inspected for export jumped 8.3
percent to 44.5 million bushels in the week, according to the
USDA. That was above expectations,  Dan Cekander , director of
grain market analysis at Newedge USA LLC, wrote in a report.  Soybeans for March delivery added as much as 0.8 percent to
$14.295 a bushel before trading at $14.2625.  The U.S. Department of Agriculture is scheduled to release
its export sales report on Dec. 28 at 8:30 a.m. in  Washington .  To contact the reporters on this story:
