Johnson & Johnson (JNJ)  and  Sanofi (SAN) 
declined to provide information on a transaction between the two
companies that won the approval of U.S. antitrust regulators.  A deal with J&J, its McNeil-PPC, Inc. subsidiary that makes
over-the-counter medicines such as Tylenol and personal care
products, and Sanofi was authorized by regulators, according to
an early termination notice posted today on the  Federal Trade
Commission (FTC) ’s website. No details were given by the agency about
the transaction.  “We have no additional information and do not comment on
pending business development activities,” said Peggy Ballman, a
spokeswoman for New Brunswick, New Jersey-based J&J, the world’s
biggest maker of health-care products. Marisol Peron, a
spokeswoman for Paris-based Sanofi, also declined to comment on
the transaction.  “Sanofi certainly has interest in over-the-counter brands,
but they’re a small player, especially in the U.S.,”  Jeff Jonas , co-portfolio manager of the Gabelli Healthcare & Wellness
Trust fund, said in an e-mail. “J&J is constantly reviewing its
products/brands and divesting anything that doesn’t have good
growth prospects or that they view as non-core.”  Jonas said he doesn’t have any specifics on the deal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
