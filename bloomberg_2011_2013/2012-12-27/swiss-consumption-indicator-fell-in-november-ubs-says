A gauge of Swiss consumer demand
declined in November on a drop in new car registrations and a
lower number of hotel stays by Swiss nationals.  The  consumption indicator , which signals developments about
three months ahead, fell to 1.23 points from a revised 1.30
points in October,  UBS AG (UBSN)  in Zurich said in an e-mailed
statement today. It had previously reported a reading of 1.31
points for that month.  The indicator is based on new car registrations, business
activity in the retail sector, the number of domestic overnight
stays by Swiss residents, the consumer sentiment indicator and
credit-card transactions at UBS points of sale in Switzerland.  Still, “the positive trend in the business situation in
the retail industry and the continuing high number of new car
registrations confirms our relatively optimistic assessment of
the further development of private consumption in Switzerland,
which is likely to remain an important mainstay of the Swiss
economy next year as well,” UBS said in the statement.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
