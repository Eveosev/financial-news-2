U.S. stocks slid for a fifth day and
Treasuries rose amid concern lawmakers won’t reach a budget deal
to avoid the fiscal cliff of spending cuts and tax increases
looming in January. Commodities slipped as the dollar gained.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index lost 1.1 percent to close
at 1,402.43, its biggest drop since Nov. 14, and  S&P 500 futures 
extended their decline to as much as 2 percent after the close
of trading. The benchmark gauge erased its gain for December and
pared its 2012 advance to less than 12 percent.  Ten-year
Treasury yields  fell four basis points to 1.7 percent while
Italian 10-year rallied as demand increased at a debt auction.
The dollar strengthened against most major peers.  U.S. equities sank to their lows of the session as an
official familiar with today’s budget talks said President
 Barack Obama  is seeking an up-or-down vote on his proposal to
extend tax cuts for annual income up to $250,000, absent a
counteroffer from congressional leaders. The report fueled
concern lawmakers have moved no closer to a compromise to avert
more than $600 billion in tax and spending changes in 2013.  “What the markets fear most is that we’re in this
paralysis where the government is unable to govern, communicate
and compromise,”Greg Peterson, director of investment research
at Ballentine Partners LLC in Waltham,  Massachusetts , which
manages about $4.2 billion in assets, said by telephone.
“There’s still hope in our minds that they can get something
done but if they go off the cliff, it’s going to be serious.”  Five-Day Slump  The five-day retreat in U.S. stocks was the longest for the
S&P 500 since September and the Dow Jones Industrial Average’s
longest since July. The Chicago Board Options Exchange
Volatility Index, the gauge of S&P 500 option prices, jumped 17
percent to 22.72 today, the highest level since June 13. The
index has surged 43 percent this month, poised for its biggest
increase since July 2011.  Obama met for just over an hour today with House Speaker
John Boehner and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, both
Republicans, and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and House
Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, both Democrats. The Republican-led
House called an unusual Sunday session for the evening of Dec.
30, though the leaders didn’t say what action they planned to
take.  Weekly Decline  Trading volume for S&P 500 was 30 percent below the 30-day
average. Stock-index futures erased early gains before the open
of exchanges in New York. The index capped a 1.9 percent weekly
decline and today’s drop left it down 1 percent for December.  Energy and raw-material companies led losses among all 10
of the main industry groups in the S&P 500, with Valero Energy
Corp. and Peabody Energy Corp. dropping more than 2 percent to
pace declines. Hewlett-Packard Co. tumbled 2.6 percent after the
computer maker said the U.S. Justice Department opened an
investigation relating to Autonomy Corp., the software company
it bought last year.  An S&P gauge of homebuilders retreated 0.7 percent even
after better-than-forecast growth in home sales. The index of
pending home sales climbed 1.7 percent to 106.4, the highest
reading since April 2010, after a revised 5 percent gain in
October, the National Association of Realtors reported. The
median forecast in a Bloomberg survey called for a 1 percent
advance.  Economic Readings  Another report showed the MNI Chicago Report’s business
barometer rose to 51.6 in December from 50.4 the prior month,
above the reading of 50 that is the dividing line between
expansion and contraction and higher than the median estimate of
economists for 51.  Benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasuries capped the first weekly
gain in a month. The securities lagged behind stocks this year
by the most since 2009, with equities returning eight times more
than bonds.  The dollar was stronger against 10 of 16 major peers,
rising the most against the Mexican peso, Norwegian krone and
Brazilian real. The U.S. currency strengthened to 0.1 percent to
$1.3221 per euro.  The S&P GSCI Index of commodities lost 0.2 percent as zinc,
cotton, aluminum and coffee led declines. Oil slipped 7 cents to
$90.80 a barrel in New York.  Gold Retreats  Gold futures fell, completing the longest run of weekly
declines in almost three years, as a stronger dollar curbed
demand for the metal as an alternative investment. Gold for
February delivery slipped 0.5 percent to $1,655.90 an ounce and
capped a fifth straight weekly decline.  The  Stoxx Europe 600 Index (SXXP)  declined 0.7 percent today,
trimming its 2012 advance to 14 percent, the largest annual
increase since 2009. The number of shares changing hands today
was 36 percent less than the 30-day average, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Bankia SA plunged 27 percent to the lowest price since its
initial share sale in July 2011 as the bank was temporarily
excluded from Spain’s benchmark  IBEX 35. (IBEX)  Porsche SE surged 6.3
percent to the highest in almost two years after an appeals
court ruling dismissed a lawsuit by hedge funds that accused the
German carmaker of concealing a plan to corner the market in
Volkswagen AG shares.  The yield on Italian 10-year bonds fell three basis points
to 4.50 percent, erasing an earlier five-point gain, as the
country sold 5.9 billion euros ($7.8 billion) of five- and 10-
year government securities. Investors bid for 1.47 times the
amount of the 10-year debt offered, up from 1.18 times on Nov.
29. The yield had earlier increased as much as 4 basis points.  Asia, Emerging Markets  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index advanced 0.6 percent.
Government reports today showed  Japan ’s industrial output slid
1.7 percent last month from October, worse than all 27 estimates
in a Bloomberg News survey that had a median forecast of a 0.5
percent decline. The data bolstered the case for Prime Minister
Shinzo Abe to push for further monetary easing. Consumer prices
excluding fresh food fell 0.1 percent in November from a year
earlier.  Abe’s cabinet is working on a plan to fight against a
strong yen, the Nikkei newspaper said. Proposals include the use
of currency intervention when needed, the paper said.  The MSCI  Emerging Markets  Index advanced 0.6 percent to
extend this year’s increase to 15 percent.  China ’s  Shanghai
Composite Index (SHCOMP)  rallied 1.2 percent to the highest since June
21. The BSE India Sensitive Index added 0.6 percent, heading for
its best year since 2009.  Vietnam ’s VN Index jumped 0.9 percent
to the highest since August, capping its largest weekly gain
since February. Russia’s Micex Index fell 0.2 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
