Zambia’s kwacha weakened the most in
3 1/2 years as investors bought dollars before the local
currency is rebased on Jan. 1, with three zeros being removed.  The currency of  Africa ’s biggest copper producer slumped as
much as 4.9 percent, the biggest intraday drop since May 2009 to
5,153 per dollar and traded 4 percent weaker at 5,110 by 12:25
p.m. in the capital, Lusaka, making it the worst performer among
all currencies today, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “The only game in town right now is the one called
currency rebasing,” Charles Mate, managing director of Lusaka-
based  Stockbrokers Zambia Ltd. , said by phone. “A number of
players in the market are presumably converting their kwacha
into foreign currency” to reduce risk in the run-up to the
rebasing, and will take a “wait-and-see approach” in January,
he said.  The kwacha gained 6.7 percent in the three days through
Dec. 24, making it the best performer for the period, after the
Bank of Zambia tightening the overnight foreign-currency
positions local lenders can hold. The central bank had also been
selling dollars in a bid to strengthen the kwacha, Mwewa
Kyamulanda, a currency trader with  Investrust Bank Plc (INVESTRU) , said in
a Dec. 24 interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
