The  Bank of Japan (8301)  will outpace the
U.S. Federal Reserve in printing money next year, putting the
yen on track to weaken to about 90 per dollar, according to Bank
of America Merrill Lynch.  The CHART OF THE DAY shows the dollar-yen rate and, in the
lower panel, the monetary bases of the world’s largest and
third-biggest economies since 2007. While the U.S. system had
$2.64 trillion in November, about double  Japan ’s 124.4 trillion
yen ($1.44 trillion), the pace of change differed in the past
year as the BOJ stepped up its buying of government and
corporate debt amid a recession. Japan’s central bank voted on
Dec. 20 to expand its asset-purchase program by 10 trillion yen
to 76 trillion yen after Shinzo Abe called for unlimited
monetary stimulus before becoming prime minister this week.  “An additional 10 trillion yen increase in the BOJ’s
balance sheet would weaken the currency by about 2 yen, based on
the comparative pace of the Fed’s easing,” said Shogo Fujita,
chief Japanese bond strategist at Bank of America in  Tokyo . “If
the BOJ expands by 20 trillion yen, 90 per dollar would be in
sight,” he said. Fujita said he expects Japan’s government- and
corporate-debt purchase program to be the larger amount in 2013.  The BOJ next meets on Jan. 21-22 and Governor Masaaki Shirakawa is due to step down in April. Abe was sworn in as
Japan’s premier Dec. 26 after his  Liberal Democratic Party  won a
majority of seats in lower house elections this month. He’s
called for unlimited central bank liquidity to weaken the yen
and stimulate growth in a country mired in deflation.  The yen traded at 86.10 per dollar as of 6:50 a.m. in
Tokyo, after yesterday touching 86.15, the weakest since Aug.
16, 2010. The currency has depreciated 14 percent this year, the
biggest loser among the 10 developed-nation currencies tracked
by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes.  The  Federal Open Market Committee  voted on Dec. 12 to
supplement its $40 billion a month of mortgage-bond purchases
with $45 billion in monthly Treasury purchases in the third
round of quantitative easing. Last year, it implemented the so-
called Operation Twist program, under which the Fed replaces its
holdings of shorter-dated securities with longer maturity debt
to lower borrowing costs.  To contact the reporters on this story:
