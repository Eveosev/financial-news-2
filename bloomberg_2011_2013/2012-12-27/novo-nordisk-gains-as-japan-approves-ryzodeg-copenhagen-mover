Novo Nordisk A/S (NOVOB) , the world’s
biggest maker of insulin, gained in Copenhagen trading after its
Ryzodeg diabetes drug was approved for treatment in  Japan .  The drugmaker  rose  as much as 1 percent to 925 kroner, the
highest since Dec. 17, in the Danish capital. Trading volume was
5 percent of the three-month average by 9:18 a.m. local time.  Japan approved Ryzodeg for once or twice daily treatments,
Novo said Dec. 25. Ryzodeg is a soluble formulation of Novo’s
Tresiba insulin degludec and NovoRapid insulin aspart drugs.  The company will start selling Ryzodeg in Japan next year,
about six to nine months after introducing Tresiba in that
market, Nordea Equity Research forecast.  “We see a lot of exciting share price drivers ahead and
expect the stock to take off in 2013 and set records,” Mikkel
Pedersen, an analyst at Nordea Bank AB, said in a note.  Novo will make Ryzodeg available in Japan in FlexTouch and
Penfill insulin pens, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
