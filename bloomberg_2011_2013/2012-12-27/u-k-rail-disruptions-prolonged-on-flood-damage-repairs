Travel disruptions across Britain’s
rail network persisted for a seventh day as repairs of flood
damage and continued high water forced service suspensions.  Trains out of  London ’s Paddington station, including the
Heathrow Express that connects the center of the U.K. capital to
its main airport, were halted because work to fix the power
supply wasn’t completed, a Network Rail spokesman said today.
Partial service on the line has resumed, with delays of as much
as two hours, according to the Network Rail website.  U.K. rail operations have been hampered since Dec. 21 after
heavy rain damaged equipment and washed away tracks. Schedule
disruptions may last into the new year as engineers undertake
repairs. The  Met Office , Britain’s state-owned weather-
forecasting service, said some heavy rain will affect England
today, bringing the risk of “further localized flooding” that
affects transportation.  Long-distance rail service particularly in the southwest of
 England  has also been affected, according to the National Rail
website. CrossCountry and First Great Western operators are
shifting passengers from trains onto buses to bridge gaps in the
rail network.  To contact the reporter on this story:
