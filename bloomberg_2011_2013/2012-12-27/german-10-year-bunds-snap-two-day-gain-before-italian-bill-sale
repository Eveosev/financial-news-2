Italy ’s government bonds declined,
pushing the 10-year yield to the highest level in a week, before
the nation sells as much as 3 billion euros ($3.98 billion) of
the securities tomorrow.  Italian five-year debt dropped as the Rome-based Treasury
also prepared to sell up to 3 billion euros of notes maturing in
2017 tomorrow. German 10-year bunds climbed for a third day,
pushing the yield to a  two-week low , amid concern U.S. lawmakers
won’t reach an agreement on budget negotiations in time to stop
more than $600 billion in tax increases and spending cuts for
2013 starting to take effect in January. Euro-region government
bond markets were closed from Dec. 24 through Dec. 26.  Italian bonds “have been down all session because the
market is cheapening up to accommodate tomorrow’s supply,” said
 Peter Chatwell , a fixed-income strategist at Credit Agricole
Corporate & Investment Bank in  London .  Italy’s 10-year yield rose six basis points, or 0.06
percentage point, to 4.53 percent at 4:45 p.m. London time, the
highest level since Dec. 18. The 5.5 percent bond maturing in
November 2022 fell 0.46, or 4.60 euros per 1,000-euro face
amount, to 108.05.  The yield on the nation’s five-year notes climbed seven
basis points to 3.25 percent.  Italian Auctions  The Italian Treasury last sold 10-year bonds on Nov. 29 at
an average yield of 4.45 percent. It auctioned five-year notes
at 3.23 percent the same day.  Italy allotted 8.5 billion euros of six-month bills at an
average yield of 0.949 percent today, up from 0.919 percent at a
previous auction on Nov. 28. It also sold 3.25 billion euros of
zero-coupon notes due in 2014 at an average yield of 1.884
percent, compared with a rate of 1.92 percent at a previous sale
on Nov. 27.  Germany ’s 10-year bund yields dropped as much as six basis
points to 1.32 percent, the lowest level since Dec. 13, as
investors sought the security of  Europe ’s benchmark debt amid
concern about the so-called fiscal cliff.  U.S. Senate Majority Leader  Harry Reid  said today a
resolution to the budget dispute before Jan. 1 appears unlikely
because Republicans won’t cooperate.  France ’s 10-year bond yields were little changed at 1.98
percent as data showed a gauge of French consumer sentiment
unexpectedly improved in December and business confidence in
Italy rose this month.  Economic Data  An index of household  sentiment  rose to 86 from 84 in
November, the first increase since May, the Paris-based national
statistics office Insee said. The median estimate in a Bloomberg
News survey called for an unchanged reading of 84. A gauge of
Italian business confidence climbed to 88.9 from 88.5 last
month, according to Rome-based Istat.  Italian bond yields near two-year lows show investors are
confident the rally that started after  Mario Monti ’s appointment
as Prime Minister will survive an election next year.  Monti ruled out running in the Feb. 24-25 vote at a Dec. 23
press conference, while saying he would “consider” being the
prime-ministerial candidate for a party that adheres to his
economic agenda. His comments came weeks after former Prime
Minister  Silvio Berlusconi  reversed a decision to stay out of
the race.  Italy’s 10-year yield fell to 4.35 percent on Dec. 19, the
least since December 2010. The rate has fallen from about 7
percent on Nov. 16 of last year, when Monti was sworn in to lead
a government of non-politicians.  “So far the impact of recent political developments on the
Italian government debt market has been muted,” Barclays Plc
analysts Fabio Fois and Giuseppe Maraffino wrote in a client
note on Dec. 24. “Demand from investors has been solid across
maturities and broad based among investor classes. The current
positive momentum for the Italian paper should continue.”  German bonds returned 4 percent this year through
yesterday, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. Italy’s
bonds earned 21 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
