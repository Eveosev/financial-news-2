Azeri President  Ilham Aliyev 
pardoned 87 prisoners, including a correspondent with Iranian
state-run television who was jailed in June on drug charges.  Anar Bayramli, who worked for Sahar 2 TV and also for
Iran’s Fars news agency, was sentenced to two years in prison
after authorities said he was found in possession of heroin. He
rejected the charges, saying they were trumped up.  Sahar 2 TV’s Azeri-language programs, beamed into
Azerbaijan from neighboring Iran, often criticize the Aliyev
government’s secular policies and its close ties to  Israel  and
the West.  The pardoned prisoners, whose names were published today in
state-run daily  Azarbaycan , included four people imprisoned for
protesting a ban on Islamic-style head scarves in schools.
Religious activists have held several rallies in the capital,
Baku, since the government introduced the ban in 2009. Azeri
officials accused  Iran  of sparking the protests.  Most of Azerbaijan’s 9 million people share Iran’s Shiite
Muslim religion, while a quarter of Iranians are ethnic Azeri.  To contact the reporter on this story:
