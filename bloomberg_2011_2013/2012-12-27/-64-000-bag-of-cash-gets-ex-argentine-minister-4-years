Former Argentine Economy Minister
Felisa Miceli was sentenced to four years in prison for crimes
related to the discovery of more than $64,000 in a paper bag in
her office bathroom in 2007.  Miceli, 60, was also banned by a federal court from  service 
in public office for eight years, according to a statement today
on the official website of the country’s justice system. The
court found her guilty of a cover-up and of destroying official
documents, according to the statement.  Miceli quit her post in July 2007 after the bag with
100,000 pesos ($32,200 at the time) and $31,670 in U.S. dollars
was found by a bomb squad in her office’s bathroom. She won’t go
to prison until a superior court ratifies the sentence,
according to today’s verdict.  “I will appeal the sentence,” Miceli said on her way out
of court. “I am not afraid of going to jail.”  Phone calls to Miceli’s home seeking further comment
weren’t answered.  To contact the reporter on this story:
