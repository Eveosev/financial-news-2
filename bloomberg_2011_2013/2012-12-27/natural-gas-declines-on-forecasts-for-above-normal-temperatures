Natural gas retreated as forecasts
for above-average temperatures spurred concern that the U.S.
winter will be too mild to erode a stockpile surplus.  Gas dropped as much as 2.2 percent as warmer-than-normal
weather will blanket the central and eastern half of the country
Jan. 6 through Jan. 10, according to MDA Weather Services in
Gaithersburg, Maryland.  Denver  will decline to a low of 27
degrees Fahrenheit (minus 3 Celsius) on Jan. 6, 11 higher than
usual, according to AccuWeather Inc.  “Although we are going to see some cold in the next week
or so, it’s not going to last much longer than that,” said  Gene McGillian , an analyst and broker at Tradition Energy in
 Stamford ,  Connecticut . “We have to keep an eye out on how that
storage number comes out.”  Natural gas for January delivery fell 6.8 cents, or 2
percent, to $3.324 per million British thermal units at 9:20
a.m. on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Gas has risen 11
percent this year. The January contract expires today. The more
actively traded February futures dropped 6.1 cents to $3.364 per
million Btu. Futures trading volume was down 49 percent from the
100-day average.  To contact the reporter on this story:
