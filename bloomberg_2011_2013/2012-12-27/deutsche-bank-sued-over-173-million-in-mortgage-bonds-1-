Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  was sued in New
York by Landesbank Baden-Wuerttemberg, which accuses the German
bank of fraud in the sale of $173 million in mortgage-backed
securities in 2007.  Deutsche Bank engaged in “egregious fraud,” selling
securities that were riskier than promised and leading to
losses, LBBW said in a complaint filed today in New York State
Supreme Court.  LBBW, Germany’s biggest state-owned lender, said Deutsche
Bank’s misconduct resulted in “astounding” rates of default on
loans underlying the securities.  “We believe this suit is without merit and we intend to
defend ourselves,”  Amanda Williams , a spokeswoman for
Frankfurt-based Deutsche Bank, said in an e-mail.  The case is Landesbank Baden-Wuerttemberg v. Deutsche Bank
AG, 654543-2012, New York State Supreme Court (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
