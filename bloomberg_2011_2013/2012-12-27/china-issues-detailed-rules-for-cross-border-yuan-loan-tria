China  issued rules for cross-border
 yuan  loans in a trial area near  Hong Kong , as the government of
the world’s second-biggest economy moves to gradually open up
its capital account and allow freer use of its currency.  The People’s Bank of China authorized its local office in
Shenzhen to implement rules letting companies in the southern
city’s Qianhai district borrow yuan from banks in Hong Kong,
according to a  statement  posted on the branch website yesterday.  The commencement of cross-border yuan-loan operations in
Qianhai will have “far-reaching” effects on the development of
zone as well as on the offshore yuan market in Hong Kong,
according to the statement.  China is seeking to develop Qianhai, a 15-square kilometer
zone on Shenzhen’s west side, into a financial services hub.
Companies there will be encouraged to sell yuan-denominated
bonds in Hong Kong and to experiment with cross-border loans in
the Chinese currency, the National Development and Reform
Commission said in June.  The creation of the Qianhai zone is a major breakthrough
because it will give mainland companies access to cheaper
capital in Hong Kong, Xiao Yafei, director-general of Shenzhen’s
office of financial development service, said in June. Qianhai
may serve as a bridge between the onshore yuan hub in  Shanghai 
and the offshore center in Hong Kong, Xiao said.  The  interest rates  and maturities of cross-border yuan
loans will be decided by banks and borrowers, the central bank
said in yesterday’s statement. Cross-border yuan loans taken out
in Qianhai should be used locally, it said.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
