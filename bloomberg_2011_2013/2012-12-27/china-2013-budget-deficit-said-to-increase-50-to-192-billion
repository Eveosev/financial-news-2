China  plans to increase the  budget
deficit  by 50 percent to 1.2 trillion  yuan  ($192 billion) in
2013, including the sale of 350 billion yuan of bonds to fund
local governments, a person familiar with the matter said.  The central government deficit is budgeted at 850 billion
yuan, according to the person, who asked not to be identified as
the deliberations are not public. The nation’s leaders target
about 8 percent trade growth, down from this year’s 10 percent
goal, the person said.  A bigger fiscal deficit may give China’s new leadership
under Xi Jinping more room for tax cuts and measures to boost
urbanization and consumer demand. The 1.2 trillion-yuan total
compares with an 800 billion-yuan target this year, which
included a 550 billion-yuan central government deficit and 250
billion yuan in local government bond sales.  “The year 2013 is the first year for the new Chinese
leadership, and urbanization will receive a big push,” said
Zhang Zhiwei, chief China economist at Nomura Holdings Inc. in
 Hong Kong . “Financial support, including an expanded fiscal
deficit in the budget, is needed for that.”  Apart from a trial program launched in late 2011, local
governments are barred from selling bonds directly and can’t run
deficits. China Business News reported the 1.2 trillion yuan
figure today and Economic Information Daily reported an 8
percent trade target.  China News Service reported a 10 percent growth target for
industrial production in 2013.  The government usually reveals specific goals at the
legislature’s annual meeting in March.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
