Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. will
pay advisers and managers $122 million in one-time fees in
December, including incentives and amounts owed to professionals
that were previously held back, according to a bankruptcy court
filing. A judge last month approved $42 million in incentive
fees for Alvarez & Marsal North America LLC, which manages the
defunct firm.  To contact the reporter on this story:
