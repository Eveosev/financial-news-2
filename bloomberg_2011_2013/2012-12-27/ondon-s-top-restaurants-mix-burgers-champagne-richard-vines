There are so many new restaurants in
 London , it can be difficult to keep up. Here are some of my
favorites from the past year.  10 Greek Street: This crowded and informal Soho venue is so
low-key, you might miss it. That would be a loss. The daily
changing menu of seasonal dishes is enticing, the cooking is
assured and the prices are low. Options may include Gloucester
Old Spot pork chop, polenta and spring greens or asparagus, duck
egg & parmesan. The wine list is also refreshing. Information:
 http://www.10greekstreet.com/  or +44-20-7734-4677.  28-50: This Marylebone wine bar serves fine food and has a
drinks list that is also worth crossing London for. There are
few restaurants in London where the price/quality ratio is so
heavily in favor of the diner. Unlike the original 28-50, housed
in a basement, this new outpost is at street level. It is a real
treat. Information:  http://www.2850.co.uk/  or +44-20-7725-1330.  Bubbledogs: This casual venue in Fitzrovia serves hot dogs
and Champagne. That’s it. There was a line of almost 40 people
when I last left Bubbledogs, early on the evening of Dec. 18.
I’m not surprised: It’s a fun place. Champagne starts at 38
pounds ($61.90) with Gaston Chiquet. The dogs are available with
a vegetarian sausage if you like. Information:
 http://www.bubbledogs.co.uk/  or +44-20-7637-7770.  Burger & Lobster: The formula is simple. There’s no menu
and no starters. You can have either burger or lobster for 20
pounds, with fries and salad. That is cheap for a lobster and
expensive for a burger, and diners love it. Three branches of
this offshoot of Goodman steak house have opened in a year and a
fourth is on its way. Information:
 http://www.burgerandlobster.com/  or +44-20-7490-9230.  Coya: Peruvian cuisine is newly fashionable in London’s
 West End , where three such restaurants have opened over the past
year. Coya is my favorite. It’s owned by Arjun Waney, whose
empire includes Zuma and the Arts Club, and Coya is similarly
fashionable. It also serves very good food. Sanjay Dwivedi is a
chef who can impress without ostentation. Information:
 http://www.coyarestaurant.com/  or +44-20-7042-7118.  Dabbous: This restaurant has been the big hit of 2012. Chef
Ollie Dabbous has taken all the lessons he has learned from
masters such as Aggi Sverrisson at Texture and then let rip with
his own creativity. The fact his prices are so low -- 28 pounds
for the four-course lunch -- adds to the allure. If you can’t
get a table, the basement bar is good for cocktails and snacks.
Information:  http://www.dabbous.co.uk/  or +44-20-7323-1544.  Delaunay: This offshoot of the Wolseley retains some of the
buzz of the original. It’s just as elegant and the food has the
edge, although the menu is similar. Delaunay is less frenetic
and more relaxing. It is one of my favorite spots in London.
Information:  http://www.thedelaunay.com/  or +44-20-7499-8558.  Dishoom: This is the first offshoot of an Indian street-
food restaurant that opened in the West End in 2010. The new
outlet in Shoreditch is a great space. The staffers are
friendly, the prices are low and the food is first-class. I had
one of my most enjoyable meals of the year here. Dishoom well
encapsulates the current trend for quality without fuss.
Information:  http://www.dishoom.com/  or +44-20-7420-9324.  Green Man & French Horn: This is the new outlet of the team
behind Terroirs, Brawn and Soif. As usual, the idea is to serve
unfussy, rustic dishes with natural wines. This time, the focus
is on the Rhone. This new outlet, in a narrow old pub on St.
Martin’s Lane, lives up to the very high standards of its
predecessors. Information: +44-20-7836-2645.  Pitt Cue Co: London wasn’t blessed with great barbecue
before Pitt Cue came along. It is now. The decor is minimalist
and it’s all about the food. The prices are rock bottom and the
lines can be long, so it’s best to go along early or late.
Information:  http://www.pittcue.co.uk/ . No phone.  Polpo: Restaurateur Russell Norman’s mini-empire keeps
growing. This Smithfield outpost is the latest and the brand is
in good shape. The formula is the same: small plates of unfussy
food served at reasonable prices in a room whose casual
appearance belies months of meticulous planning and prop-buying.
Information:  http://polpo.co.uk/  or +44-20-7250-0034.  Story Deli: I can remember the last time I tasted pizza
this good. It was at Franny’s, in  Brooklyn , last year. Story is
a very unfancy venue and it’s not especially cheap. Pizzas cost
16 pounds. They’re worth it. How about the prawn, with garlic,
black pepper & lemon-roasted prawns, fresh red onion, parmesan,
smashed tomatoes, toasted spices and basil pesto? Information:
 http://www.storydeli.com/  or +44-7918-197-352.  Sushisamba: This restaurant and bar atop the Heron Tower is
the most dramatic new venue of the year. I regularly take
visitors up in the express lift and the wow factor never fades.
It’s expensive and there are grumbles about the service, yet
it’s difficult to resist that combination of inventive food,
brilliant views and the buzz of the bar. Information:
 http://sushisamba.com  or +44-20-3640-7330.  Tonkotsu: This Soho noodle bar is opposite the Groucho
Club. The stock for the ramen is created by cooking pork bones
for as long as 18 hours. The flavor is deep. April Bloomfield
ate here with her team from the Spotted Pig when she visited
London this year. It’s a fine place to hang out with friends.
Information:  http://www.tonkotsu.co.uk/  or +44-20-7437-0071.  Zedel: This is the best-value restaurant I know in the West
End of London. It looks like a million dollars, yet the fixed-
price menu is just 11.25 pounds for three courses. Zedel feels
like a huge Paris brasserie out of a movie. It’s worth making
time for a visit to the Bar Americain next door. Information:
