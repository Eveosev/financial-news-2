Kansai Electric Power Co. (9503) , the
utility that supplies  Japan ’s second-biggest metropolitan area,
plans to cut about 500 jobs in the three years ending March 2016
to reduce costs.  The plan was revealed at a meeting yesterday with the
government panel reviewing the utility’s request to raise
prices. The job cuts will help increase sales per employee by 24
percent by the end of the period compared with the year ended
March 2000, according to  the plan  posted on the trade and
industry ministry’s website.  The utility, which had a record first-half loss of 117
billion yen ($1.4 billion), submitted the request last month to
raise rates for households by 11.88 percent to cover the
increased costs of running its thermal power plants.  Kansai Electric is operating just two of its 11 nuclear
reactors after the Fukushima disaster last year prompted
shutdowns of nuclear plants and forced utilities to raise
imports of fuel for gas, oil and coal-fired generators.  To contact the reporter on this story:
