New York  Knicks guard  Raymond Felton 
broke the fifth finger on his right hand, the team said in a
press release. Treatment will be determined when the team
returns home from its West Coast road trip after tomorrow’s game
in Sacramento.  Felton was injured during the Knicks’ Christmas Day loss to
the Los Angeles Lakers. He didn’t play in last night’s win over
the Phoenix Suns.  Felton, 28, with 15.8 points a game, is second on the
National Basketball Association team in scoring behind Carmelo
Anthony. He leads the team with 6.3 assists per contest.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
