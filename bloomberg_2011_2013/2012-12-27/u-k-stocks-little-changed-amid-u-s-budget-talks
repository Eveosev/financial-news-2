U.K. stocks  were little changed,
paring earlier gains, after U.S. Senate Majority Leader  Harry
Reid  said America looks to be heading for the so-called fiscal
cliff of automatic tax increases and spending cuts.  Evraz Plc (EVR)  advanced 2 percent after winning approval to
increase its stake in Russian coal producer OAO Raspadskaya.
 Reckitt Benckiser Group Plc (RB/) , the maker of Lysol cleaners and
Nurofen painkillers, fell 1.3 percent.  The  FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  rose 0.12 points, or less than 0.1
percent, to 5,954.3 at the close of trading in London, trimming
an earlier increase of as much as 0.7 percent. The benchmark
gauge is heading for a 6.9 percent gain this year as the
 European Central Bank  and the  Federal Reserve  expanded asset
purchases. The broader FTSE All-Share Index and Ireland’s ISEQ
Index were also little changed today.  “There is an awful lot of posturing here and I think they
will eventually come to some sort of conclusion, but I don’t
think it will be before the year-end,”  David Buik , a market
strategist at Cantor Index Ltd. in London, said in a Bloomberg
Radio interview today.  Stocks pared gains after Reid said “nothing’s happening”
in budget talks in Washington and the dispute probably won’t be
resolved before Jan. 1 because Republicans won’t cooperate.  U.S. President  Barack Obama  is urging lawmakers to reach an
interim deal to avoid more than $600 billion of fiscal changes.
House Speaker  John Boehner  last week scrapped his plan to allow
higher tax rates on annual incomes above $1 million, saying it
didn’t have enough support among House Republicans.  The volume of shares changing hands in FTSE 100 companies

estimate in a Bloomberg survey.  New-house sales climbed 4.4 percent in November to a
377,000 annual pace, the most since April 2010, following a
revised 361,000 rate in October, the Commerce Department
reported. The median estimate of 71 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg called for sales to increase to 380,000.  Figures from the Conference Board showed its consumer
 confidence index  fell to 65.1 in December from a revised 71.5
reading the prior month. The gauge was projected to slip to 70,
according to the Bloomberg survey median.  Evraz, ENRC  Evraz rose 2 percent to 259.4 pence, snapping three days of
losses. The Russian steelmaker partly owned by Roman Abramovich
