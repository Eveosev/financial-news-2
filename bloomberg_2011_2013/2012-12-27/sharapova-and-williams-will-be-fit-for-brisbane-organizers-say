French Open champion Maria Sharapova
and Wimbledon winner  Serena Williams  will be ready to play in
Brisbane next week after overcoming injury concerns, tournament
organizers said.  Williams of the U.S. pulled out of an exhibition in
Thailand last week after she had surgery on her toes. Russia’s
Sharapova withdrew from an exhibition this week in Seoul,  Korea 
with neck soreness.  “I think Maria and Serena are the two biggest stars in
women’s tennis so it’s great that they’re both going to be here
and both be fit and ready to play the first tournament of the
year,” tournament organizer Cameron Pearson said on the
Brisbane International website.  The tournament, held from Dec. 30 through 6 January, is a
warm-up event for the Australian Open, which starts Jan. 14 in
Melbourne.  Eleven-time major champion  Rafael Nadal  of Spain earlier
this week postponed his return to professional tennis after a
seven-month absence. Nadal, who struggled with a knee injury
since losing in the second round at Wimbledon, had been due to
make his comeback at an exhibition event today in  Abu Dhabi . He
said on his Facebook page on Christmas Day he’d been ordered by
doctors not to play because of a stomach infection.  To contact the reporter on this story:
