Hogs declined the most in more than
a week on signs of increasing supplies of U.S. pork. Cattle
futures also fell.  Commercial pork  output  in the first 11 months of the year
climbed 2.9 percent from a year earlier, the government said
Dec. 21. Meatpackers slaughtered 442,000 hogs in the  Iowa  and
southern Minnesota region in the week ending Dec. 22, 11 percent
more than a year earlier, U.S. Department of Agriculture data
show. Wholesale  pork  dropped 0.2 percent to 82.7 cents a pound
yesterday, the USDA said.  “We still seem to have plenty of pigs coming to market,”
 Mark Schultz , the chief analyst at Northstar Commodity
Investment Co., said in a telephone interview from  Minneapolis .  Hog futures for February settlement declined 0.7 percent to
86.8 cents a pound at 9:50 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange. A close at that level would be the biggest drop for a
most-active contract since Dec. 17. Through yesterday, prices
were up 3.7 percent this year.  Cattle futures for February delivery fell 0.5 percent to
$1.33075 a pound in Chicago. Prices rose 10 percent this year
through yesterday.  Feeder-cattle futures for March settlement dropped 0.5
percent to $1.54025 a pound on the CME.  To contact the reporter on this story:
