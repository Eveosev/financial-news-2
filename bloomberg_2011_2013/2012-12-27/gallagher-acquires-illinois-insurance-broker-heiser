Arthur J. Gallagher & Co. (AJG) , the
Itasca, Illinois-based insurance broker, bought Heiser Insurance
Agency Inc. to expand in the U.S. Midwest. Terms weren’t
disclosed.  Heiser helps transportation and manufacturing clients find
coverage, according to a statement issued today. It is based in
Morton, Illinois.  Gallagher and rivals  Marsh & McLennan Cos. (MMC)  and Brown &
Brown Inc. have been buying brokerages as the industry
consolidates. Gallagher has announced more than two dozen deals
this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Gallagher
said yesterday it had acquired Ahrold Fay Rosenberg, the Des
Moines, Iowa-based retail insurance brokerage.  Today’s purchase will “give us a solid footprint in
central Illinois,” Gallagher Chief Executive Officer J. Patrick Gallagher Jr. said in the statement.  Gallagher fell less than 1 percent to $34.61 at 3:29 p.m.
in  New York . It has advanced 3.5 percent this year, trailing the
15 percent rally of the Standard & Poor’s Midcap 400 Index.  To contact the reporters on this story:
