Greece ’s four largest banks need to
boost their capital by 27.5 billion euros ($36.3 billion) after
taking losses from the country’s debt swap earlier this year,
the largest sovereign restructuring in history.  National Bank of Greece SA , the country’s biggest lender,
needs to raise 9.8 billion euros, according to an e-mailed
report by the Athens-based  Bank of Greece (TELL)  today.  Eurobank
Ergasias SA (EUROB)  needs 5.8 billion euros,  Alpha Bank (ALPHA)  needs 4.6
billion euros and  Piraeus Bank SA (TPEIR)  needs 7.3 billion euros,
according to the report. Total recapitalization needs for the
country’s banking sector amount to 40.5 billion euros, the
report said.   The 50 billion euros earmarked for Greek banks in the
country’s bailout program “is appropriate to cover the
recapitalization and restructuring costs of the Greek banking
sector,” the central bank said. “It is expected to remain
adequate under reasonable levels of economic uncertainty.”   The banks have received bridge recapitalization loans from
the Hellenic Financial Stability Fund to raise their core tier
one  capital ratios  to 9 percent, as required under the terms of
the country’s bailout from the European Union and  International
Monetary Fund . The recapitalization must be completed by the end
of April, through a combination of common equity and contingent
convertible bonds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
