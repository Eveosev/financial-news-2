China ’s yuan fell for a fourth day
after the central bank set the currency’s reference rate at a
five-week low amid concern budget deficits in advanced nations
will hurt the global economy.  The People’s Bank of China lowered the fixing for a sixth
day, cutting it by 0.01 percent to 6.2949 per dollar, the
weakest since Nov. 19. The spot is allowed to trade as much as 1
percent on either side of the fixing. Treasury Secretary  Timothy
F. Geithner  said yesterday the U.S. government will hit its
statutory debt ceiling on Dec. 31 and he will take steps to
postpone a default by about two months, allowing more time for
lawmakers to agree on a deficit-reduction deal.  “The central bank doesn’t favor any strong gains now as
the export outlook remains uncertain with the fiscal problems in
the U.S. and Europe,” said Kenix Lai, a Hong Kong-based
foreign-exchange analyst at  Bank of East Asia Ltd. (23)  The currency
may climb as much as 2 percent in 2013, Lai said.  The yuan fell 0.03 percent to 6.2374 per dollar as of 9:54
a.m. in Shanghai, according to the China Foreign Exchange Trade
System. The currency has climbed 0.76 percent this quarter,
contributing to a 0.9 percent advance for the year. That
compares with a 4.7 percent appreciation in 2011.  In  Hong Kong ’s offshore market, the  yuan  traded at 6.2318
per dollar, compared with 6.2315 yesterday, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards
dropped 0.04 percent to 6.3380 per dollar, a 1.6 percent
discount to the onshore spot rate.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves
in exchange rates used to price options, has fallen 93 basis
points, or 0.93 percentage point, to 1.8 percent this year.
That’s lower than the past five years’ average of 2.35 percent.
The gauge declined five basis points today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
