Steel reinforcement-bar futures
climbed to the highest level in more than five months on
expectations that China’s investments in railways and
urbanization will boost demand for the construction material.  Rebar for delivery in May rose as much as 2.1 percent to
3,958  yuan  ($635) a metric ton on the Shanghai Futures Exchange,
the highest most-active price since July 10. Futures were at
3,885 yuan by the midday break, extending this month’s advance
to 11 percent and trimming the 2012 loss to 7.7 percent.  Railroad construction investment may be 1.8 trillion yuan
between 2013 and 2015, China Securities Journal reported today,
citing the National Development and Reform Commission’s
Institute of Comprehensive Transportation. The investment needed
in 2013 may be as much as 650 billion yuan, the newspaper said.
The housing and urban-rural development ministry told local
governments to complete renovation of large run-down urban areas
by end-2015, Xinhua reported yesterday, citing a circular.  “The government is determined to spend more money on
infrastructure and urban development,” Wu Zhili, an analyst at
Shenhua Futures Co., said by phone from Shenzhen.  China ’s urbanization is expected to spur 40 trillion yuan
of investment by 2020, the Southern Metropolis Daily reported on
Dec. 25, citing a draft plan by the NDRC.  The average spot  price  for rebar rose 0.3 percent to 3,621
yuan a ton yesterday, according to data from Beijing Antaike
Information Development Co. Spot  iron ore  at Tianjin port was
unchanged at $135.40 a dry ton on Dec. 24, data compiled by The
Steel Index Ltd. showed.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
