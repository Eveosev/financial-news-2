SK Telecom Co. (017670) , the biggest of South
 Korea ’s three wireless operators, led companies that usually pay
high dividends lower in Seoul trading as they trade without the
rights to the year’s final payments.  SK Telecom dropped 5.1 percent to 150,500 won as of 10:02
a.m. on the Korea Exchange, making it the  worst performer  on the
MSCI Asia Pacific Index.  KT Corp. (030200) , the second-largest mobile-
phone carrier, slipped 4.8 percent to 35,700 won, while the
benchmark  Kospi index  lost 0.1 percent.  Along with the telecom operators, Industrial Bank of Korea,
the biggest South Korean lender to small and medium-sized
companies, and  KT&G Corp. (033780) , the country’s biggest tobacco maker,
had the highest dividend yields among  South Korea ’s 50 largest
publicly-traded companies, according to  data  compiled by
Bloomberg.  “This is the ex-dividend day and it’s weighing on telecom
stocks that usually pay relatively high dividends,” Yi Dong Sub, an analyst at SK Securities Co., said by telephone today.  Industrial Bank of Korea (024110)  slipped 2.5 percent, while KT&G
retreated 2.4 percent.  S-Oil Corp. (010950) , South Korea’s third-largest
oil refiner, fell 1.4 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
