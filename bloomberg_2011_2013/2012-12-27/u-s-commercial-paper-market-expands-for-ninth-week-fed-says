The U.S. market for corporate
borrowing through  commercial paper  expanded for a ninth week,
reaching the highest level in 15 months.  The seasonally adjusted amount of commercial paper rose
$7.3 billion to $1.066 trillion outstanding in the week ended
yesterday, the  Federal Reserve  said today on its website. Thatâ€™s
the longest stretch of advances since May 2011 and the highest
level since September 2011.  Commercial paper sold by domestic financial  institutions 
rose for the first time in three weeks, increasing $7.4 billion
to $309.5 billion outstanding, while IOUs  issued  by non-
financial U.S. companies increased $2.8 billion to $168.2
billion, the highest level since June.  Borrowing among financial firms based outside the U.S.
declined $2.4 billion, the first drop in five weeks, to $217.2
billion, and  issuance  by foreign, non-financial companies
decreased $1.9 billion, the most since September, to $51.1
billion.  Businesses sell commercial paper, typically maturing in 270
days or less, to fund everyday activities such as payroll and
rent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
