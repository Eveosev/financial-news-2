European stocks  were little changed
as U.S. jobless-benefit claims dropped and home sales climbed to
a two-year high, offsetting Senate Majority Leader  Harry Reid ’s
comments that a budget deal is unlikely.  Clariant AG, a Swiss chemical company, rose 3 percent after
selling three units.  Bankia SA (BKIA)  plummeted 20 percent as Spain’s
bank-rescue fund said its parent company has a negative value of
10.4 billion euros ($13.8 billion).  The  Stoxx Europe 600 Index (SXXP)  increased less than 0.1 percent
to 280.6 at the close of trading. The volume of shares traded
was 25 percent less than the 30-day average, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The gauge has rallied 15 percent in 2012
as the  European Central Bank  introduced an unlimited bond-buying
program, putting it on course for the best year since 2009.  The Stoxx 600 erased an earlier gain of 0.3 percent as
Reid, a Democrat, said “nothing’s happening” in U.S. budget
talks and it looks like the nation is heading over the so-called
fiscal cliff. A resolution to the dispute before Jan. 1 appears
unlikely because Republicans won’t cooperate, he said on the
Senate floor.  “We have to get some commitment from U.S. politicians that
we will get at least temporary relief,” said Pierre Mouton, who
helps oversee $6 billion as portfolio manager at Notz Stucki &
Cie. in Geneva. “Still, the economic numbers are very
encouraging.”  National benchmark indexes climbed in 13 of the 18 western
European markets. France’s  CAC 40 (CAC)  rallied 0.6 percent,  Germany ’s
DAX advanced 0.3 percent and the U.K.’s benchmark FTSE 100 was
little changed.  Interim Deal  President  Barack Obama  is pressing for U.S. lawmakers to
craft an interim deal to avert more than $600 billion in tax
increases and spending cuts, known as the fiscal cliff.
Republican House leaders hold a conference call with their rank-
and-file members today to discuss the path forward, according to
a leadership aide who asked for anonymity.  In a letter to Congress yesterday aimed at intensifying
pressure on lawmakers to reach a deal, Treasury Secretary
 Timothy Geithner  said the federal debt limit will be reached on
Dec. 31 and his department will begin using “extraordinary
measures” to finance $200 billion in deficits into early 2013.  A Labor Department report showed fewer Americans than
forecast filed claims for  unemployment insurance  last week.
Applications for  jobless benefits  decreased by 12,000 to 350,000
in the week ended Dec. 22. Economists forecast 360,000,
according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey.  Home Sales  U.S. new-home sales climbed to a 377,000 annual rate in
November, most since April 2010, the Commerce Department said.
The median forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg had
projected 380,000.  Clariant rose 3 percent to 12.20 Swiss francs after selling
units for 502 million francs ($550 million). The specialty
chemicals maker said it will get approximately 460 million
francs in cash for selling the textile chemicals, paper
specialties and emulsions businesses to SK Capital Partners, a
U.S. buyout company.  “Positive surprise today -- earlier than expected
divestment, better price, low probability of writedowns,”
Patrick Rafaisz, an analyst at Vontobel Holding AG, wrote in a
report on  Clariant. (CLN)  “Despite short-term economic headwinds,
today’s level represents a clear buying opportunity from a risk-
reward perspective.”  Evraz Plc (EVR)  added 2 percent to 259.4 pence as the steel
manufacturer won antitrust approval to increase its stake in OAO
Raspadskaya, a Russian coal producer.  Miners Rally  A gauge of mining shares on the Stoxx 600 advanced 0.7
percent. Rio Tinto Group and  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP)  rose 0.9 percent
to 3,541.5 pence and 0.8 percent to 2,156.5 pence, respectively.  Volkswagen AG (VOW) ’s preferred shares climbed 0.9 percent to
172.60 euros after the automaker’s Audi unit said it will spend
13 billion euros on new-car development and production
expansion.  Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW)  gained 1.1 percent to 73.46
euros. Chief Financial Officer Friedrich Eichiner said he is
confident the carmaker has surpassed its 2011 profit total,
according to a report by Die Welt.  Assa Abloy AB (ASSAB)  advanced 1.9 percent to 244.80 kronor after
agreeing to buy American docking-systems company 4Front
Engineered Solutions Inc. for an undisclosed amount. The
Carrollton, Texas-based company expects a revenue of $165
million in 2012, Assa said in a statement.  Bankia tumbled 20 percent to 55.2 euro cents, the lowest
price since July 17. Banco Financiero y de Ahorros, the parent
of Bankia, has negative value of 10.4 billion euros, Spain’s
bank-rescue fund said, as it pledged to recapitalize all the
lenders it controls by year-end.  To contact the reporters on this story:
