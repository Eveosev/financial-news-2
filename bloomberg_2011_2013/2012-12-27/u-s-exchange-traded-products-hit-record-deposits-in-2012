Exchange-traded products in the U.S.
gathered record deposits this year as investor demand for low-
cost stock-and-bond funds drove expansion in the fastest-growing
segment of the asset-management industry.  Investors deposited $183.3 billion into ETPs in 2012
through Dec. 24, surpassing the $175.6 billion peak in 2008 and
pushing assets to $1.34 trillion, according to research firm
IndexUniverse LLC. Bond ETPs took in $55.7 billion, more than
double the amount such funds attracted in 2008. Stock ETPs that
invest primarily in the U.S. attracted $67.2 billion, and
international equities gathered $48.5 billion.  “The story in the 2012 numbers is the incredible breadth
of funds involved,” David Nadig, director of research at the
San Francisco-based company, said in a telephone interview.
“Even in the laggard columns, U.S. equity had 11 percent growth
from inflows.”  Investor assets in ETPs have more than doubled since the
end of 2008 as they’re easier to buy and sell and are often
cheaper than traditional mutual funds. The broad-based growth in
ETPs this year contrasts with the mixed results for U.S. mutual
funds. Stock mutual funds saw $139.2 billion in withdrawals in
2012 through Dec. 19, the fifth straight year of redemptions, as
bond mutual funds reported deposits of $302.6 billion, according
to the  Investment Company Institute .  Within fixed-income, U.S.-focused bond ETPs took in $44
billion, and those that invest globally took in $11.7 billion,
according to data compiled by IndexUniverse.  “Fixed income had a particularly good year, with things
like  emerging markets  local currency bonds and international
corporate high yield becoming viable asset classes,” Nadig
said.  New Products  Providers rolled out 176 new ETPs in 2012, including 104
that invest in equities, 42 in bonds, 18 in commodities and 17
in multiple asset classes, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  BlackRock Inc. (BLK) , the world’s biggest ETP provider,
opened the most new products with 47.  ETPs include those structured as funds, as well as
exchange-traded notes. ETFs grant shareholders a claim on assets
held by the fund, while ETNs represent an unsecured debt
obligation by the issuer to the holder.  Actively managed ETFs took a prominent step forward in 2012
with the success of Pacific Investment Management Co.’s Total
Return ETF, an exchange-traded version of  Bill Gross ’s Total
Return Fund. Opened ten months ago, it held $3.76 billion as of
yesterday, or 36 percent of all assets in actively-managed ETPs.  ETPs, unlike mutual funds, trade throughout the day on an
exchange, like stocks. They typically hold a basket of
securities or physical commodities that tracks an index.
Actively-managed ETPs select holdings based on proprietary
research, aiming to beat a benchmark index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
