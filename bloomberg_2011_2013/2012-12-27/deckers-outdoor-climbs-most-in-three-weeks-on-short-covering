Deckers Outdoor Corp. (DECK)  climbed after
a research report about high consumer interest in the company’s
Ugg brand prompted investors to cover short positions.  Deckers  advanced  9.3 percent to $38.11 at the close in New
York, the biggest increase since Dec. 3. The shares have dropped
50 percent this year.  Ugg was the most searched brand online this holiday season,
Experian, an Internet tracking firm in New York, said today in
an e-mailed statement. Investors have been concerned that
shoppers have switched from Ugg sheepskin boots to other leather
styles as the company’s sales growth has shrunk to what analysts
on average  estimate  is 4 percent this year from 38 percent in
2011.  “There is a very high short interest in Deckers and any
little bit of positive data has been reason for covering those
shorts,” Corinna Freedman, an analyst with Wedbush Inc. in  New
York , said in a phone interview today.  Freedman rates Goleta, California-based Deckers’s shares
outperform, the equivalent of buy.  Short interest as a percentage of Deckers shares available
for trading was 49 percent as of Dec. 14, the sixth most shorted
stock on the Nasdaq Stock Market. Short-selling refers to the
practice of borrowing shares and selling them, with the goal of
profiting by repurchasing them later at a lower price.  Experian has been reporting all year that Ugg is a
popularly searched item, said Matt Tatham, a spokesman. Its most
recent Top Ten ranking was issued for the 12 weeks ended Dec.
22, he said.  CNBC earlier today reported the Experian data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
