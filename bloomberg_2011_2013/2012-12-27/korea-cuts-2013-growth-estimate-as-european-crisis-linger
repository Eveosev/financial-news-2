South Korea  lowered its growth
forecasts for this year and for 2013 in the first revisions
since a new president was elected on Dec. 19.  Gross domestic product will expand 3 percent next year, the
 Finance Ministry  said in a statement in Sejong, less than the 4
percent predicted in September. Growth may be 2.1 percent this
year, versus a previous 3.3 percent estimate.  The update brings the government’s forecasts closer to
those of private economists and the central bank as Europe’s
debt crisis caps demand for the nation’s exports. The pace of
expansion next year may partly depend on the extent of any extra
spending by president-elect Park Geun Hye, who will take office
in February.  “Downside risks from  Europe  are bigger than anticipated,”
said Choi Sang Mok, a director general at the ministry.  The Kospi index of stocks fell 0.3 percent as of 1:43 p.m.
in Seoul, paring gains for the year to 8.3 percent. The won
appreciated 0.1 percent to 1,072.00 per dollar, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg, with this year’s 7.5 percent advance
the biggest among Asia’s 11 most-traded currencies.  The  Bank of Korea  said today that it will support the
recovery while also examining possible economic imbalances
“arising from the extended duration of its accommodative
monetary policy stance.”  Improving Outlook  South Korea’s growth rate is likely to gradually increase
from the middle of next year as the global economy recovers, the
central bank said in a report today. The benchmark  interest rate 
is at 2.75 percent compared with 5.25 percent before the global
financial crisis.  Some South Korean companies are already benefiting from an
improved economic outlook.  Samsung Electronics Co. (005930) ’s fourth-
quarter operating profit may reach 9.05 trillion won, exceeding
consensus estimates, according to a  Daishin Securities Co. (003540) 
report this week.  Kumho Petro Chemical Co. (011780) ’s operating profit
may increase 51 percent in 2013 on expected improvement in
synthetic rubber demand and capacity expansion, BS Securities
said in a report yesterday.  South Korea’s current-account surplus may fall to $30
billion in 2013 from an estimated $42 billion this year,
according to the finance ministry. Exports are projected to rise
4.3 percent in 2013 and inflation will be 2.7 percent, it
estimated. Asia’s fourth-largest economy expanded 1.5 percent in
the third quarter from a year earlier.  “One big variable is whether the new government will roll
out stimulus or not,” said Sun Yoo, a Seoul-based economist at
Woori Investment & Securities.  The BOK said in its report today that any upward pressures
on consumer prices “are not expected to be large.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
