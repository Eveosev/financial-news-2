Venezuela ’s economy grew 5.5 percent
this year, led by housing construction and government services,
the central bank estimated.  Construction grew 16.8 percent and government services
expanded 5.2 percent, central bank President Nelson Merentes
said, citing preliminary figures. Official gross domestic
product data will be released in late February.  “We’re seeing the reactivation of the Venezuelan
economy,” Finance Minister Jorge Giordani said today in
comments broadcast on state television.  President Hugo Chavez raised spending on low-income housing
and wages in the run up to the Oct. 7 election, widening the
fiscal deficit to about 8.8 percent of GDP this year, according
to calculations by Bank of America Corp.  Non-oil sector GDP rose 5.7 percent this year, while the
oil industry expanded 1.4 percent, the central bank said.  Merentes declined to comment on future economic measures
including any changes to the country’s currency controls.  To contact the reporters on this story:
