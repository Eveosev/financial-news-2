Marubeni Corp. (8002) , Japan’s biggest non-
utility investor in power generation, agreed to buy a 20 percent
stake in Philippine company Maynilad Water Services Inc.  Maynilad purifies water and treats sewage in a part of
 Manila  that houses 9.5 million people, the most congested area
in the world, Tokyo-based Marubeni said today in a statement,
without disclosing the financial terms of the deal. The stake
may be sold for about $400 million, Isidro Consuji, president of
Maynilad investor  DMCI Holdings (DMC) , said July 25.  The purchase will be Marubeni’s first in the Philippines
water treatment and sewage business, adding to assets in the
same industry in  Chile , China, Peru and Australia. The Japanese
trading house, in proportion to its equity stakes, services the
water needs of about 6 million people globally, and targets
expanding that to 10 million people, according to its website.  The power utilities and infrastructure unit has emerged as
Marubeni’s biggest profit earner after mining and energy,
accounting for 12.2 billion yen ($154 million) of the 105.3
billion yen in net income for the six months to Sept. 30.  To contact the reporters on this story:
