PPG Industries Inc. declared force
majeure for vinyl chloride monomer produced at its Lake Charles,
Louisiana, chemicals complex and for all grades of liquid
caustic soda after a Dec. 24 fire at the plant.  The disruption will likely cut PPGâ€™s commodity-segment
earnings by $5 million to $8 million in the fourth quarter, the
company said today in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
