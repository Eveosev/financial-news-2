The New York State regulator for
 MBIA Inc. (MBI) ’s insurance unit criticized the company for paying
executives $11.4 million to stay on board for three more years.  “These bonuses are unwarranted and ill-advised,”  David Neustadt , a spokesman for the New York Department of Financial
Service, said today in an e-mailed statement. “That MBIA in its
current circumstances would pay big bonuses raises real
questions as to the independence of MBIA’s board and the
judgment of MBIA’s management.”  Kevin Brown, a spokesman for the Armonk, New York-based
bond insurer, declined to comment.  MBIA said yesterday it’s paying the cash bonuses to keep
four executives with the company through December 2015. Its
board approved compensation for Chief Financial Officer Chuck Chaplin, Chief Operating Officer William Fallon, Chief Legal
Officer Ram Wertheim and Chief Portfolio Officer Anthony McKiernan that include the retention awards and 2 million shares
of  stock .  Neustadt declined to elaborate on his e-mailed statement.  “The bonuses will be coming entirely from the holding
company and will in no way disadvantage stakeholders in the
insurance unit,” Mark Palmer, an equity analyst at New York-
based trading firm BTIG LLC. “We believe it is in the best
interest of MBIA’s stakeholders for the company to retain key
executives, and we see the amounts in question as modest
relative to typical executive compensation packages.”  Equity Value  The insurer has lost about  89 percent  of its stock-market
value since 2006 after it expanded from its original municipal-
bond business to backing other kinds of securities including
mortgage-related instruments that lost value during the
financial crisis that began with the collapse of the U.S.
property market the following year. MBIA shares were down 2.1
percent to $7.78 as of 4:15 p.m. in New York.  Chaplin and Fallon will receive $3.5 million each, Wertheim
$2.4 million and McKiernan $2 million for staying on, according
to a regulatory filing. If an executive leaves before December
2015 without the board’s consent, he must repay a portion of the
bonus and forfeit additional stock awards.  In 2011, Chaplin received total compensation of $1.1
million, including $750,000 of salary and the rest retirement
payments, according to a March 19 filing. Fallon was paid
$750,000 and a total $960,938, according to the filing. Their
base salaries were to remain at $750,000 this year.  McKiernan, Wertheim  McKiernan received total compensation of $2.7 million last
year, including $450,000 of salary, $351,080 of stock awards,
$1.75 of incentive compensation and $126,500 in retirement
money. His salary was raised to $500,000 for 2012, according to
the filing.  Wertheim, whose compensation wasn’t included in the March
19 filing, received a total consideration of $2.06 million in
2010, including $500,000 of salary, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. Wertheim’s salary last year remained at $500,000,
according to a March 2011 filing.  MBIA said in March that its four top executives, Chaplin,
Fallon, Wertheim and Chief Executive Officer Jay Brown, wouldn’t
receive a cash bonus or long-term incentive pay for 2011 after
talks with the New York State Department of Financial Services.  To contact the reporter on this story:
