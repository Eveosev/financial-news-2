Audi, the world’s second-largest
maker of  luxury vehicles , plans to spend 13 billion euros ($17
billion) through 2016 to develop new cars and expand production
capacity as it pursues  Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW) ’s sales lead.  The  Volkswagen AG (VOW)  unit budgeted more than 10.5 billion
euros to develop vehicles and technologies, including
lightweight auto design and electric powertrains, as part of the
investment program, the Ingolstadt, Germany-based carmaker said
today in a  statement . The spending includes funds for expanding
production at its factory in  Hungary , adding capacity in  China 
and building a new plant in  Mexico .  “We will keep investing large sums to pursue our growth
strategy,” Chief Financial Officer Axel Strotbek said in the
statement. “The expansion of our global manufacturing
infrastructure will help us to continue growing.”  Audi aims to sell at least 2 million cars a year and
overtake BMW by the end of the decade. The brand’s expansion is
part of Volkswagen’s goal to become the world’s largest
automaker by 2018. The Wolfsburg, Germany-based manufacturer
plans to spend 50.2 billion euros on its auto division,
including Audi, through 2015.  BMW is expected to strengthen its dominance of the luxury-
car industry next year. The Munich-based carmaker will increase
sales 4.6 percent to 1.54 million vehicles in 2013, beating
Audi’s 1.1 percent growth to 1.44 million autos, according to
estimates from industry researcher IHS Automotive.  Record Sales  With the debt crisis depressing demand in Europe, Germany’s
luxury-car makers have maintained growth by selling vehicles in
the U.S. and China. BMW, Audi and  Daimler AG (DAI) ’s Mercedes-Benz are
all targeting record sales this year, while mass-market
competitors in Europe are bracing for the lowest sales in the
region in 17 years.  Volkswagen shares advanced 1 percent to 172.65 euros at
4:32 p.m. in  Frankfurt . BMW rose 1 percent to 73.41 euros and
Daimler advanced 0.8 percent to 41.90 euros.  In November, the BMW brand increased deliveries 26 percent
to 145,452 cars and sport-utility vehicles. That compares with
growth of 11 percent to 123,600 deliveries at Audi and 5.7
percent to 120,346 vehicles at Mercedes.  Audi is seeking to boost sales next year by rolling out
variants of the A3 compact, including a sedan version. BMW is
countering with the introduction of the new 4-Series coupe and
the i3, its first electric car.  Mercedes, which was passed in sales by Audi last year, has
also set its sights on overtaking BMW. The Stuttgart, Germany-
based carmaker will revamp its flagship S-Class sedan and
introduce the CLA compact four-door coupe. IHS forecasts
Mercedes will retake the No. 2 spot next year, with sales of
1.46 million vehicles.  To contact the reporter on this story:
