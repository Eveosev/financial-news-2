Consumer confidence  in the U.S. held
near a four-year high last week as Americans grew less
pessimistic about the economy.  The Bloomberg Consumer Comfort Index was little changed at
minus 32.1 in the period ended Dec. 23 from minus 31.9 in the
prior week, a drop that was within the margin of error of 3
percentage points. The gauge was less than a point from an April
reading that was the highest since March 2008.  Higher  property values  and record-low borrowing costs are
supporting a real-estate recovery that’s bolstering household
confidence while cheaper gasoline offers some relief to
pocketbooks. At the same time, looming tax increases and
government budget cuts threaten to keep sentiment and spending
from accelerating.  “Households are increasingly confident about their own
personal finances, which is likely to sustain the improvement in
consumer sentiment in 2013, albeit at low levels,” said  Joseph Brusuelas , senior economist at Bloomberg LP in  New York . “This
is part and parcel of the historically slow expansion the U.S.
is currently experiencing.”  Figures from the Labor Department today showed fewer
Americans than forecast filed  claims  for  unemployment insurance 
last week as state offices rushed to tally the data in a
holiday-shortened period. Jobless claims dropped by 12,000 to
350,000 in the week ended Dec. 22.  Stocks fell as lawmakers return to Washington to resume
budget talks. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index dropped 0.1
percent to 1,418.17 at 10:12 a.m. in New York.  Conference Board  The Bloomberg measure contrasts with the Conference Board’s
gauge of  consumer confidence , which declined more than forecast
in December. The New York-based private research group’s index
dropped to 65.1 from a revised 71.5 reading the prior month. The
gauge was projected to fall to 70, according to the Bloomberg
survey median.  The Conference Board’s gauge of  expectations  for the next
six months decreased to 66.5, the lowest since November 2011,
from 80.9. The measure of present conditions climbed to 62.8
this month, the highest since August 2008, from 57.4 in
November.  “The sudden turnaround in expectations was most likely
caused by uncertainty surrounding the oncoming fiscal cliff,”
 Lynn Franco , director of economic indicators at the Conference
Board, said in a statement today. “While consumers are quite
negative about the short-term outlook, they are more upbeat than
last month about current business and labor market conditions.”  New-Home Sales  The Commerce Department said in another report that sales
of  new homes  rose in November to the highest level in more than
two years, the latest sign that the real-estate market is
helping lift the economy. Purchases climbed 4.4 percent to a
377,000 annual pace, the most since April 2010, following a
revised 361,000 rate in October.  The Bloomberg measure of Americans’ views of the state of
the economy climbed to minus 58.5, the second-highest level
since March 2008, from minus 59.8 the prior week. The personal
 finances  gauge rose to minus 0.5 from minus 0.8.  The buying climate index decreased to minus 37.5 compared
with minus 35.1 in the previous period.  The overall index was 15.4 points better than it was during
the same period last year. The gauge has averaged minus 38.3 in
2012 and is on track for its best annual showing since 2007.  Political Groups  Democrats showed their highest confidence reading for a
comparable week since 2006. Independents registered their
strongest sentiment since April, and highest level for a similar
period since 2007. Confidence among Republicans slid last week
to the lowest among the three political groups, and was last
higher for a comparable week in 2010 when the party scored its
biggest victory in the U.S. House of Representatives since 1938.  Today’s figures showed confidence among those 45 to 54
years old advanced last week to its highest level since the week
ended April 29. Sentiment among Americans with annual income of
$100,000 or more remained positive for an eighth consecutive
week, the longest such stretch since the 13 weeks ended June 17.  Employment gains may be helping boost consumers’
perceptions that the economy is improving. Payrolls increased by
146,000 workers in November, the most since August. Employment
rose at a similar pace this month, according to the median
estimate in a Bloomberg survey before next week’s figures from
the Labor Department.  Sentiment among part-time workers improved in the Bloomberg
survey to a five-month high, today’s report showed.  Bright Spot  Housing remains a bright spot in the economic recovery.
Property values increased more than forecast in October,
according to a report released yesterday by the S&P/Case-Shiller
group. The index of  home prices  in 20 cities  rose  4.3 percent
from October 2011, the biggest 12-month advance since May 2010.  Cheaper  gas prices  are easing stress for household balance
sheets. The  average cost  of a gallon of regular gasoline at the
pump fell to a 12-month low of $3.22 on Dec. 19, according to
AAA, the nation’s biggest motoring organization.  The pickup in confidence may not be translating to better
results at retailers. Purchases rose 0.7 percent from Oct. 28
through Dec. 24 compared to 2 percent in the same period last
year, according to a Dec. 25 report from MasterCard Advisors
SpendingPulse, which tracks total U.S. sales at stores and
online via all payment forms.  “We’ve had some ups and downs in terms of the general
economy,” Chuck Knight, senior vice president and corporate
controller at Wayne, New Jersey-based  Toys R Us Inc. (TOYS) , said on a
Dec. 18 earnings call.  Telephone Survey  The Bloomberg Consumer Comfort Index, compiled by Langer
Research Associates in New York, conducts telephone surveys with
a random sample of 1,000 consumers 18 and older. Each week, 250
respondents are asked for their views on the economy, personal
finances and buying climate; the percentage of negative
responses is subtracted from the share of positive views and
divided by three. The most recent reading is based on the
average of responses over the previous four weeks.  The comfort index can range from 100, indicating every
participant in the survey had a positive response to all three
components, to minus 100, signaling all views were negative. The
margin of error for the headline reading is 3 percentage points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
