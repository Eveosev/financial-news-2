The Hungarian forint snapped a four-
day losing streak against the euro and yields dropped at an
auction of three-month government debt as demand lagged in the
first trading day after Christmas holidays.  The forint strengthened 0.8 percent to 291.51 per euro by 5
p.m. in Budapest, advancing the most since Nov. 22. Hungary sold
35 billion forint ($160 million) of three-month Treasury bills
today, 15 billion forint less than planned, as the average yield
dropped to 5.47 percent, the lowest this year, from 5.63 percent
at the last auction of the same maturity on Dec. 18.  “There isn’t a lot of activity,”  Akos Kuti , a Budapest-
based analyst at broker Equilor Befektetesi Zrt., said by phone.
“As for the forint, it’s a classic correction after the past
three days and shows how the carry trade is still attractive for
investors.”  The forint dropped 1.4 percent against the euro between
Dec. 21 and Dec. 26, touching a six-month low of 295.65 when
traders in Budapest were on their Christmas holiday and as U.S.
lawmakers wrangled over a budget compromise to avoid more than
$600 billion in tax increases and spending cuts that take effect
Jan. 1. Negotiations are scheduled to resume today.  The forint has strengthened 8.1 percent this year, the most
among all currencies tracked by Bloomberg after the Polish
zloty, as liquidity-boosting measures and record-low  interest
rates  in the U.S. and  Europe  drew investors to higher-yielding
assets.  Investors today bid for 62 billion forint in three-month
bills, the least since Aug. 3. That compared with 173 billion
forint in bids last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
