Mexico ’s Congress called on the U.S.
to tighten gun control laws after 20 elementary school students
were shot dead in Connecticut, saying drug cartels fill their
arsenals with weapons bought north of the border.  The Permanent Committee of the Congress sent its statement
in an e-mail today after former President  Felipe Calderon  wrote
on his Twitter account this month that the end of the U.S.
assault-weapon ban in 2004 is one of the causes of violence in
the region.  A 2009 analysis of Justice Department data by the U.S.
Government Accountability Office found the number of firearms
seized in Mexico that could be traced to the U.S. more than
doubled to 6,700 in 2008 from 3,090 in 2004. The same GAO report
found that the number of high caliber, high-powered weapons in
Mexico was rising, and that the U.S. lacked a comprehensive
strategy to prevent arms trafficking to Mexico.  The “freedoms” of the U.S. weapons industry are
destroying Mexico and the U.S., said Ricardo Mejia Berdeja, a
Mexican lower house lawmaker, according to Congress’ statement.
“If we don’t stop the trafficking of weapons we won’t win the
battle against organized crime.”  President  Barack Obama  said he’s looking for ways to curb
gun violence after the Dec. 14 shooting in Newtown, Connecticut,
while U.S. Senator  Dianne Feinstein , a California Democrat, has
said she’ll introduce a bill to reinstate a ban on assault-
weapons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
