Iran ’s Foreign Ministry said it
would open its Parchin military base to the United Nations’
atomic agency if there is an end to threats against the Persian
Gulf nation.  The UN’s International Atomic Energy Agency has identified
its top goal in Iran as being a visit to Parchin, a sprawling
military base about 30 kilometers (19 miles) southeast of
Tehran. The IAEA says it was given intelligence information
showing Iran may have constructed a blast chamber for testing
nuclear-weapons components at the site.  “If external threats are cooled off, the possibility will
be given to visit the Parchin site,” said Deputy Foreign
Minister Hassan Qashqavi, according to  Iran Diplomacy , a website
run by former Iranian diplomats. Qashqavi didn’t elaborate on
conditions for allowing the visit or give details on the threats
the country faced.  Iran says the evidence given to the IAEA by unnamed
countries was forged, that it hasn’t worked on developing an
atomic weapon and its nuclear activities are aimed at securing
energy and for medical research.  While IAEA officials routinely inspect Iran’s declared
nuclear facilities, such as enrichment plants at Natanz and
Fordo, existing treaty arrangements don’t compel the country to
open up peripheral facilities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
