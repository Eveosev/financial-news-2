U.S. stocks pared most of their
early declines amid optimism President  Barack Obama  and Congress
will reach a deal on the budget impasse. Treasuries trimmed
gains; commodities reversed losses.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index closed down 0.1 percent at
1,418.10 at 4 p.m. in New York, trimming an earlier plunge of
1.3 percent, with trading volume 15 percent below the 30-day
average. The VIX, the benchmark gauge of U.S. equity options,
fell for the first time in six sessions. Ten-year Treasury
yields dropped two basis points to 1.73 percent after earlier
losing five points. The yen fell 0.5 percent to 86.05 per
dollar, trading at the lowest level since August 2010.  Equities  extended declines  earlier as Senate Majority
Leader Harry Reid said a resolution to the budget dispute before
Jan. 1 appears unlikely because Republicans won’t cooperate,
pushing the U.S. closer to more than $600 billion in automatic
tax increases and spending cuts set to begin in January. Stocks
recovered as the Republican-led House planned to convene on Dec.
30 as lawmakers seek to resolve the standoff.  Democratic and Republican leaders of the House and Senate
plan to meet with Obama tomorrow, Senator Dick Durbin said after
the close of U.S. markets. Whether there will be more budget-
related Senate votes before the end of the year depends “a lot”
on what happens at tomorrow’s meeting, Durbin said. S&P 500
stock futures were down 0.2 percent as of 5:30 p.m. in New York.  ‘Rhetoric’  “The tones are really going to follow the back-and-forth
rhetoric coming out of  Washington  until something is
definitively announced,” Ryan Larson, the Chicago-based head of
U.S. equity trading at RBC Global Asset Management (U.S.) Inc.,
said in a telephone interview. His firm oversees $250 billion.  House Majority Leader Eric Cantor announced the Dec. 30
session today in a message posted on Twitter. He said that the
House may meet through Jan. 2. The next session of Congress is
scheduled to convene the following day. The first votes on Dec.
30 are planned at about 6:30 p.m., Cantor said.  Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner said yesterday the
government will hit its statutory debt ceiling on Dec. 31 and he
will take “extraordinary measures” to postpone a U.S. default
for about two months, allowing more time for lawmakers to agree
on a deficit-reduction deal.  The S&P 500 fluctuated in early trading before turning
lower after a report showed the budget impasse helped trigger a
worse-than-forecast drop in the Conference Board’s index of
 consumer confidence  in December. The sentiment gauge slid to
65.1, below the median forecast of economists in a Bloomberg
survey for a reading of 70 and down from the revised 71.5
reading for the prior month.  Economic Data  Other reports showed U.S. jobless claims fell by 12,000 to
350,000 last week, less than the 360,000 median estimate in a
survey of economists. Purchases of new homes climbed 4.4 percent
to a 377,000 annual pace, the most since April 2010, following a
revised 361,000 rate in October, the Commerce Department
reported today. The median estimate of 71 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg called for sales to increase to 380,000.  Cisco Systems Inc., Alcoa Inc. and American Express Co.
lost at least 0.8 percent to lead declines in 23 of 30 stocks in
the Dow Jones Industrial Average, with the gauge closing down 18
points after tumbling more than 150 points earlier. Financial
and commodity shares led losses in eight of the 10 main groups
in the S&P 500 today, with only consumer-staples and consumer-
discretionary companies gaining.  Marvell Technology Group Ltd. fell 3.5 percent after being
downgraded by JMP Securities LLC. BCD Semiconductor
Manufacturing Ltd. rallied 86 percent after Diodes Inc. agreed
to buy the company for $151 million.  Volatility Gauge  The  VIX (VIX) , as the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility
Index is known, fell less than 0.1 percent to 19.47 today. The
gauge had jumped 25 percent in the previous five sessions for
its biggest advance since May.  Cotton, cattle and lean hogs lost at least 0.4 percent to
lead declines in 13 of 24 commodities tracked by the S&P GSCI
Index, while sugar, zinc and copper rose more than 1.3 percent
to leave the gauge little changed after a 0.5 percent early
slump. Crude oil fell from the highest level in more than two
months, slipping 11 cents to settle at $90.87 a barrel.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index closed up less than 0.1 percent
after gaining as much as 0.3 percent. The regional benchmark has
rallied 15 percent in 2012, on course for the biggest annual
gain since 2009.  Bankia (BKIA)  plunged 20 percent as Spain’s bank-
rescue fund said the lender has a negative value of 4.15 billion
euros. Clariant AG, a Swiss chemical company, climbed 3 percent
after selling units for 502 million Swiss francs ($550 million).  European Markets  In European bond markets, Italian, Spanish and Greek debt
declined, while U.K. gilts and German bunds advanced. Italian
10-year yields climbed six basis points to 4.53 percent after a
debt auction.  Italy sold 3.25 billion euros of zero-coupon securities
maturing in 2014 to yield 1.884 percent compared with 1.923
percent Nov. 27. The sale is the first since Prime Minister
Mario Monti announced on Dec. 23 that he would consider being a
candidate for premier in elections on Feb. 24-25.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index rose 0.3 percent today,  led by 
Japanese exporters and financial companies. The gauge has risen
13 percent this year. The Nikkei 225 Stock Average climbed 0.9
percent to the highest level since March 2011.  The yen was weaker against all 16 major peers tracked by
Bloomberg.  Japan ’s consumer prices excluding fresh food fell 0.1
percent last month from a year earlier, according to the median
estimate in a Bloomberg survey. That would be the sixth decline
in seven months and compares with the  Bank of Japan (8301) ’s target of
1 percent inflation.  Japan Inflation  A drop in core consumer prices would support newly
installed Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s case to add stimulus.  Further depreciation of the yen versus the dollar is one of
the surest bets going into the new year, according to John Taylor, founder and chairman of New York-based currency hedge
fund FX Concepts LLC. The yen will weaken to 90 per dollar
before a resumption in risk aversion prompts investors to return
to traditional refuge currencies, he said.  The Japanese currency has tumbled 14 percent this year, the
biggest drop among the 10 developed-market currencies tracked by
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The dollar is the
second-worst performer with a 3 percent slide, while the euro
has lost 0.5 percent. Norway’s krone is the best performer,
climbing 4.7 percent, the indexes show.  The Istanbul Stock Exchange National 100 Index advanced for
a fourth day, rising 0.6 percent to a record 78,454.19. Turkey
was raised to investment grade by Fitch Ratings last month.  To contact the reporters on this story:
