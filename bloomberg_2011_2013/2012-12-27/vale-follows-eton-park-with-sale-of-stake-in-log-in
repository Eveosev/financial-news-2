Vale SA (VALE5) , the world’s largest iron-
ore miner, is seeking to sell a stake in Brazilian railroad and
ship operator  Log-in Logistica Intermodal SA (LOGN3)  as it divests
assets to raise cash.  While Vale is analyzing a possible sale of its 31 percent
stake in Log-in, no decision has been made, a Vale press
officer, who can’t be named under corporate policy, said by
telephone from Rio de Janeiro. The plan had been reported
earlier today by Sao Paulo-based newspaper Valor Economico,
which cited Humberto Freitas, Vale’s executive director for
logistics.  Chief Executive Officer Murilo Ferreira is selling units
after the stock slumped to the lowest in three years in
September amid waning demand from  China  and Europe. Rio-based
Vale has raised $1.47 billion through asset  sales  this year,
including a $234 million fertilizer plant sold to  Petroleo
Brasileiro SA (PETR4) , according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Log-in, also based in Rio, owns ships and port terminals
and offers railroad transportation for containers. In November,
Eton Park Capital Management LP, the hedge fund founded by Eric
Mindich, cut its stake in Log-in to 2.8 percent from 8.3
percent, according to Bloomberg data and a  regulatory filing  by
Log-in.  Log-in rose as much as 4.2 percent in Sao Paulo trading to
8.43 reais, the highest intraday since April 3. It was up 2.6
percent at 8.30 reais at 11:17 a.m. Vale climbed 0.7 percent to
40.99 reais.  To contact the reporter on this story:
