Residual-fuel inventories in
Singapore,  Asia ’s largest oil-trading and storage center, fell
2.7 percent to the lowest in 10 weeks, according to a unit of
the Ministry of Trade and Industry.  Onshore stockpiles including  fuel oil  and low-sulfur waxy
residue and excluding bitumen dropped 534,000 barrels to 19.5
million barrels in the seven days to yesterday,  International
Enterprise Singapore  said today in an e-mailed statement. That’s
the lowest level since the week ended Oct. 17.  Stockpiles of  middle distillates  including gasoil, or
diesel, and kerosene rose 370,000 barrels, or 3.6 percent, to
10.5 million barrels, the ministry’s data showed. That’s a
three-week high.  Light-distillate supplies including naphtha, gasoline and
reformate declined 230,000 barrels, or 2.4 percent, to 9.37
million barrels, according to the data.  The trade ministry surveys refiners, traders and storage
terminals on a voluntary basis. The results may exclude offshore
storage capacity, International Enterprise said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
