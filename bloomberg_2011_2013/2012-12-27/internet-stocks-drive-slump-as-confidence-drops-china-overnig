Chinese stocks fell in  New York  on
speculation gains that stoked the highest valuations in a month
were overdone as  consumer confidence  declined in the U.S., the
biggest buyer of the Asian nation’s goods this year.  The  Bloomberg China-US Equity Index (CH55BN)  of the most-traded
Chinese shares in New York dropped 0.1 percent to 96.87
yesterday, as 31 companies sank while 22 climbed. Online search
engine operator  Baidu Inc. (BIDU)  dropped, while smaller competitor
 Qihoo 360 Technology Co. (QIHU) , whose valuation has doubled since
August, slipped the most in two weeks.  Trina Solar Co. (TSL)  retreated
from a two-month high, while  Hollysys Automation Technologies
Ltd. (HOLI)  rallied the most in four weeks.  The average valuation of companies traded on the Bloomberg
China-US measure was at 16.6 times estimated earnings yesterday
after reaching a multiple of 16.8 on Dec. 19, the highest level
in a month. Confidence among American consumers dropped more
than forecast in December as the budget debate in  Washington 
soured the outlook for the economy. Chinese exports to the U.S.
rose 9.5 percent in the January-October period, the Beijing-
based customs administration said on Nov. 9.  “If you think of the U.S. consumer as a big driver of
China export demand, I don’t see that massively growing from
here,” Derrick Irwin, who helps manage $2.5 billion at the
Wells Fargo Advantage  Emerging Markets  Equity Fund, said by
phone from  Boston  yesterday. “Until I see evidence of
sustainable growth, it’s hard to be optimistic.”  ETF Slips  The iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund, the largest Chinese
exchange-traded fund in the U.S., added 0.2 percent $39.54
yesterday, extending its gain this year to 13 percent. The
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index retreated 0.1 percent to 1,418.10.  The Shanghai Composite Index of domestic shares dropped 0.6
percent to 2,205.9 from the highest level in more than five
months. The measure has climbed 0.3 percent for the year. The
Hang Seng China Enterprises Index advanced 0.7 percent to
11,348.5 for a 14 percent increase in the gauge.  Baidu, owner of  China ’s biggest search engine, slid 2
percent to $99.43, the steepest loss in three weeks. Shares of
the Beijing-based company have rebounded 13 percent since Dec.
5, when they dropped to $88.12, the lowest level since September
2010.  Beijing-based Qihoo, which develops computer desktop
applications including a search engine introduced in August,
fell 1 percent to $26.8, the biggest decline since Dec. 11. Its
American depositary receipts traded yesterday for 45 times
estimated profit for this year, up from a multiple of 39 a month
ago and 24 on Aug. 16 when its search service started.  ‘Too Fast’  “Some people may have thought the gains over the past
month are too fast,” Echo He, a senior analyst at Maxim Group
LLC who recommends buying Qihu’s stock and selling Baidu, said
by phone from New York yesterday. “Trading volume is light
around year-end, so the retreat shouldn’t be worrying.”  Renren Inc. (RENN) , operator of a real-name social network, lost 3
percent to a one-week low of $3.29. The Beijing-based company
said its board approved the renewal of the company’s share
repurchase plan for another 12 months until the end of 2013, in
a Dec. 26 statement.  NQ Mobile Inc., a mobile security software developer also
based in Beijing, lost 3.7 percent to $6, the lowest since Dec.
17.  Trina Solar , China’s third-largest manufacturer, dropped
from a two-month high, retreating 3.8 percent to $4.29. Trina’s
slump, the most in a month, was the biggest among decliners on
the Bloomberg China-US index.  Hollysys, an automation system manufacturer in Beijing,
surged 5.1 percent to an eight-month high of $11.89. The company
 provided  core equipment for the control system on China’s
Beijing-Guangzhou high-speed train line, it said on its website
Dec. 26. China started operation of the 2,298-kilometer high-
speed railroad, the world’s longest, on Dec. 26.  To contact the reporters on this story:
