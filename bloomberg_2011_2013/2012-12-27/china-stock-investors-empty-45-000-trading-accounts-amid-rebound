Chinese stock investors emptied
45,000 accounts last week, a fourth straight week of
withdrawals, even as the Shanghai Composite Index extended a
rebound from an almost four-year low.  The number of stock  accounts  containing funds fell to 55.31
million, the lowest level since the week to Nov. 19, 2010,
according to regulatory data compiled by Bloomberg. Investors
emptied 293,000 accounts in the first three weeks of this month
as the Shanghai Composite rose 8.8 percent.  The benchmark stock  gauge  climbed 2.5 percent on Dec. 25 to
erase its loss for the year amid speculation the rebounding
economy will bolster earnings. The World Bank says growth may be
as much as 8.4 percent next year after a likely 7.9 percent
expansion in 2012, set to be the weakest pace since 1999.  The number of stock-trading accounts that made  transactions 
in A shares last week increased to 9.6 million from 8.6 million
the previous week, the highest level since the week to Sept. 14.
Investors  opened  111,953 accounts to trade stocks, the most
since the week to Sept. 28.  The Shanghai index has advanced since falling to 1,959.77
on Dec. 3, its lowest level since January 2009. The measure
closed at 2,219.13 yesterday and is now valued at 12.3 times
reported earnings, after reaching a record low of 10.8.  Chinese industrial companiesâ€™ profits rose 22.8 percent in
November from a year earlier to 638.5 billion  yuan  ($102.2
billion), the National Bureau of Statistics said on its website
today. That exceeded gains of 20.5 percent the previous month
and 7.8 percent in September.  To contact the reporter on this story:
