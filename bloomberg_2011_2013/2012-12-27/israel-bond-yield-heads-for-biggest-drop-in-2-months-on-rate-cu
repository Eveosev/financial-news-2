Israel ’s benchmark bond yield headed
for the biggest weekly drop in almost two months after the
central bank cut interest rates to the lowest level in more than
two years to spur economic growth.  The yield on the 5.5 percent Mimshal Shiklit notes due in
January 2022 has dropped 13 basis points, or 0.13 percentage
point, this week, poised for the biggest slump since the week
that ended Nov. 1, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
yield was unchanged at 3.63 percent, at 10:50 a.m. in Tel Aviv.
The shekel strengthened 0.2 percent to 3.7280 a dollar.  The  Bank of Israel  cut the benchmark interest rate by a
quarter percentage point to 1.75 percent this week to boost the
economy, which it estimates may grow 3.3 percent this year from
4.6 percent in 2011.  One-year interest-rate swaps , an indicator
of investor expectations for rates over the period, fell four
basis points to 1.65 percent, the lowest since July 2009.  “ Interest rates  are likely to stay low for an extended
period as the economy slows and inflation moderates,” said
Yshai Shilo, a fixed-income broker at I.B.I.-Israel Brokerage &
Investments Ltd. in Tel Aviv. “In this environment investors
seeking a higher yield are buying longer-term  government bonds 
versus shorter-term bonds.”  The benchmark bonds rose 6.7 percent this year compared
with a gain of 9.1 percent in the Tel-Bond 40 index. The two-
year break-even rate, the yield difference between the
inflation-linked bonds and fixed-rate government debt of similar
maturity, dropped nine basis points to 211, implying an average
annual inflation rate of 2.11 percent.  Inflation slowed to 1.4 percent in November, the lowest
since July. The government’s price-rise target is 1 percent to 3
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
