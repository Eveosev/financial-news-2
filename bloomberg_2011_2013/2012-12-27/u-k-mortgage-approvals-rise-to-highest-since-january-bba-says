U.K.  mortgage approvals  rose last
month to the highest level since January, adding to signs of
stabilization in the home loan market, according to the British
Bankers’ Association.  Lenders granted 33,634 approvals in November, up from
33,128 in October, the group said in a monthly report today.
Gross mortgage lending of 7.7 billion pounds ($12.5 billion) was
“above the recent monthly average,” it said.  The Bank of England has introduced a program to boost
credit and said last month that mortgage approvals rose more
than economists forecast in October. Still, property researcher
Hometrack Ltd. said this week that a decline in  home prices  will
extend into 2013 as a reluctance to borrow weighs on demand.  Households “continuing to repay virtually as much as they
borrow and, as people hold on to cash, deposits are growing by 6
percent annually,” said David Dooks, BBA statistics director.
“The situation is not dissimilar in the business world;
businesses are holding back investment or expansion plans and
building up cash reserves.”  Net mortgage lending rose 164 million pounds in November
after an 89 million-pound increase in October, the BBA said.
Including remortgaging and other secured lending, the number of
approvals for loans secured on property was about 63,000 in
November. That compares with 230,000 a month in the peak year of
2003.  To contact the reporter on this story:
