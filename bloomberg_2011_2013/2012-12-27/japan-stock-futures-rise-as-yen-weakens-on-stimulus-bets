signaling the Nikkei 225 Stock Average will gain for a fourth
session on the last trading of the year, as the yen weakens amid
calls from the new government for more central bank easing.  American Depositary Receipts  of  Canon Inc. (7751) , the world’s
biggest camera maker, gained 1.6 percent. Shares of Toshiba
Corp. may be active after the manufacturer said it’s in talks to

fiscal cliff talks.”  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index futures advanced 0.2 percent.

$600 billion in automatic tax increases and spending cuts will
come into effect started in January.  Goldman Sachs Asset Management Co. started adding to its

anticipation that a new government would do more to boost
economic growth, according to Hiroyuki Ito, Tokyo-based head of
