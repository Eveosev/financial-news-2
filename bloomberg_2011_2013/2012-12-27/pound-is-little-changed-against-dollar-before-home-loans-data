U.K. gilts rose, with 10-year yields
falling the most in four weeks, as speculation U.S. lawmakers
will fail to agree on a way to avoid the so-called fiscal cliff
spurred demand for safer assets.  Benchmark  yields  fell to a two-week low after U.S. Senate
Majority Leader  Harry Reid  said it looks like the nation is
headed “over the cliff,” referring to the more than $600
billion in tax increases and spending cuts that will take effect
in January unless Congress acts. Gilts also gained on
speculation some investors were looking to reduce risk as the
year-end approaches. The pound was little changed against the
dollar and euro.  “There is an element of buying related to year-end cash
management and that’s happening in a very thin market,” said
 Stuart Thomson , a  money manager  at Ignis Asset Management in
Glasgow. “The U.S. fiscal cliff impasse also added to
uncertainty that argues for a risk-off approach. You don’t want
to go into the year-end with any particular amount of risk.”  The 10-year gilt yield fell eight basis points, or 0.08
percentage point, to 1.81 percent at 4:42 p.m. in  London  after
dropping as much as nine basis points, the most since Nov. 18.
The 1.75 percent bond due in September 2022 gained 0.68, or 6.80
pounds per 1,000-pound face amount, to 99.45.  Reid said a resolution to the U.S. budget dispute before
Jan. 1 appears unlikely because Republicans won’t cooperate.  “I don’t know time-wise how it can happen now,” Reid, a
Nevada Democrat, said on the Senate floor. He blamed House
Speaker  John Boehner  and Senate Minority Leader  Mitch McConnell ,
both Republicans.  Gilts returned 2.2 percent this year through yesterday,
according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. German bunds gained
4 percent and Treasuries earned 2.1 percent.  ‘Technical Bias’  “It isn’t too surprising to see a sudden jump in gilts
given the seasonal illiquidity,” said  Sam Hill , a fixed-income
strategist at  RBC Capital Markets  in London. “With 10-year
yields opening at 1.90 percent after the Christmas break, near
the top of its range in the second half of the year, there was a
technical bias for the market to consolidate.”  The pound weakened 0.1 percent to $1.6122 and dropped 0.2
percent to 82.08 pence per euro.  Sterling earlier rose as much as 0.4 percent against the
dollar after an industry report showed bank lending for U.K.
home purchases climbed last month.  Home Loans  The number of  loans  approved for house purchases rose to
33,634 in November from 33,128 in October, the British Bankers’
Association said in London. The gain was less than the median
estimate of 34,500 from a Bloomberg News survey.  “The U.K. economy may be weak but there are signs that it
has probably gone through the worst,” said Stuart Cole, a
currency analyst at Mizuho Corporate Bank Ltd. in London. “If
you look at the fundamentals, the U.K. is not doing too badly
and that should be supportive for the pound.”  The pound has appreciated 1.3 percent this year, according
to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes, which track 10
developed-market currencies. The euro declined 0.5 percent and
the dollar fell 2.8 percent.  The pound climbed to the strongest since April 2011 against
the yen today after  Japan ’s Shinzo Abe was approved as prime
minister for a second time yesterday by parliament. His Liberal
Democratic party won a landslide victory in lower house
elections on Dec. 16, pledging to weaken the currency.  The U.K. currency rose 0.3 percent to 138.56 yen after
reaching 139.19 yen, the strongest since April 11, 2011.  Sterling has risen 3.7 percent versus the dollar and 1.6
percent against the euro in 2012. If it finishes stronger than
83.34 pence per euro, this will be the fourth year of gains, the
longest winning streak since the introduction of the single
currency in 1999.  To contact the reporters on this story:
