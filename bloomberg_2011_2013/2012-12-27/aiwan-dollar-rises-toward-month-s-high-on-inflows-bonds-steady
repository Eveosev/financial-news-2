Taiwan ’s dollar traded near its
December high after overseas investors boosted holdings of the
island’s shares. Government bonds were little changed.  Global funds bought $1.5 billion more local stocks than
they sold this month, taking net purchases this year to $4.8
billion, exchange data show. The yen touched a 27-month low
today on speculation the newly-installed Prime Minister Shinzo
Abe will push for further monetary stimulus to spur the economy.  “Foreign funds have been coming into Taiwan’s stocks,”
said Samson Tu, a Taipei-based fund manager at Uni-President
Assets Management Corp., which oversees $700 million. “ Japan ’s
easing might cause money to flow into other Asian economies.”  The Taiwan dollar was little changed at NT$29.126 against
its U.S. counterpart, according to data from Taipei Forex Inc.
The currency touched NT$29.035 earlier, near the NT$29.019
reached on Dec. 3 that was the strongest level since Nov. 13. It
has climbed 4 percent this year, poised for a fourth annual gain.  One-month implied volatility in the Taiwan dollar, a
measure of expected moves in exchange rates used to price
options, rose one basis point to 3.16 percent.  Taiwan’s central bank has bought the greenback to counter
gains in the island’s currency on most days in the past eight
months, according to traders who asked not to be identified. The
monetary authority’s mandate is to keep relative exchange-rate
stability and to intervene in the event of abnormal moves,
Governor Perng Fai-Nan said on Dec. 19.  The yield on the 1.125 percent bonds due September 2022 was
little changed at 1.169 percent, according to Gretai Securities
Market. Borrowing costs on benchmark 10-year bonds dropped 12
basis points, or 0.12 percentage point, in 2012.  The  overnight interbank lending  rate was steady at 0.392
percent, a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan Interbank
Money Center shows.  To contact the reporter on this story:
