The Romanian leu weakened for a
second day as companies and households took advantage of a rally
in the local currency to pay euro-denominated loans.  The currency fell as much as 0.5 percent to 4.4415 per euro
before paring the decline to 0.1 percent at 4.4260 per euro by
4:35 p.m. in Bucharest today. The leu has gained 2.4 percent
since  Romania  held general elections on Dec. 9, making it the
best performer among emerging-market currencies tracked by
Bloomberg in the period. The currency has retreated 2.3 percent
this year.  The leu strengthened to the highest level in more than
seven months this week on improved investor appetite as Prime
Minister Victor Ponta’s new government won a confidence vote in
Parliament on Dec. 21. Ponta is counting on a two-thirds
majority in the legislature to pass a 2013 budget and start
talks with the International Monetary Fund and the European
Union in January to renew the nation’s stability accord. About
63 percent of  total private loans  are in foreign currencies,
central bank data show.  “The stronger leu is great news” for companies and
citizens with loan repayments in euros, Ponta said while
addressing ministers at the beginning of a government meeting in
Bucharest today. “The perception of stability in the country
after the elections has helped strengthen the leu and that
perception must remain valid throughout 2013,” he said.  Yields on Romania’s 2016 euro-denominated bonds rose three
basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 3.04 percent today,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
