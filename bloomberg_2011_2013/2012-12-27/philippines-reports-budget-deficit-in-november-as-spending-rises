The Philippines reported a  budget
deficit  for the third straight month in November as  government
spending  increased.  The  deficit  was 11.6 billion pesos ($282 million) compared
with a shortfall of 9.67 billion pesos reported for October, the
government said in an e-mailed statement today. Revenue rose 21
percent and spending increased 11 percent from a year earlier.
The 11-month budget gap was 127.3 billion pesos, less than half
the 279 billion-peso ceiling targeted by the government.  “The risk of fiscal slippage or of the deficit exceeding
the program is nearly eliminated this year,” Finance Secretary
Cesar Purisima said in a statement.  The Philippines is on the verge of its first investment-
grade credit rating as President Benigno Aquino bolsters tax
collection and oversees a resurgence in growth.  Standard &
Poor’s  last week raised the country’s rating outlook to positive
and said it may upgrade the Philippines next year on improved
governance and public finances.  To contact the reporter on this story:
