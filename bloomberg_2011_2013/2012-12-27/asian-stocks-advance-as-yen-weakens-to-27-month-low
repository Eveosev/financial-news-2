Asian  stocks  rose, with the regional
benchmark index headed for a second month of advance, as the yen
touched a 27-month low against the dollar on prospects for more
stimulus and  China ’s industrial companies’ profit gained.  Mazda Motor Corp. (7261) , an automaker that gets 28 percent of its

target and getting the Bank of  Japan  to undertake aggressive

outlook looks better for China, so if you get Japan undertaking
aggressive quantitative easing and better growth in China, the
rest of Asia should do well.”  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index advanced this year as the U.S.

around the world took action to shore up growth. The Asian
