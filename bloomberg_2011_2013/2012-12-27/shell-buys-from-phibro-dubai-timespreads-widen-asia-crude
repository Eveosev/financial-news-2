Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  bought three
Dubai partials from Phibro, a unit of  Occidental Petroleum
Corp. (OXY) , as timespreads for the grade widened, indicating
increasing demand.  Shell paid $108.20 a barrel for the 25,000 barrels lots for
February loading, according to a survey of traders who monitor
transactions on the Platts window. Mercuria Energy Trading SA
sold one February partial to Shell and bought the same quantity
for March from the company, according to the survey. The earlier
shipment sold at a premium of $1.90 to the later cargo.  Dubai crude’s backwardation, when near-term shipments cost
 more  than future deliveries, widened 16 cents. Spot prices were
$1.97 a barrel higher than cargoes for two months later, the
most since Dec. 17, according to data from PVM Oil Associates
Ltd., a broker.  An increasing backwardation signals strengthening demand
from refineries for prompt crude amid tightening supplies.  Benchmark Asia-Pacific  refining margins , or the profit from
processing a barrel of Dubai crude into fuels such as diesel and
gasoline priced in the regional oil-trading hub of Singapore,
averaged $3.44 during the last five days, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The 30-day average was $2.68.  The February Brent-Dubai exchange for swaps, which measures
the European oil’s premium to Mideast crude, rose 11 cents to
$4.86 a barrel. The March EFS gained 12 cents to $4.31.  Abu Dhabi’s Murban crude dropped 2 cents to a discount of
40 cents a barrel to its official selling price, the lowest
level since May 22., according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Lower Zakum declined 3 cents to a discount of 18 cents and Qatar
Land fell 2 cents to a discount of 55 cents, both at the lowest
level since Aug. 1. Qatar Marine was unchanged for a second day
at a premium of 13 cents.  Oman futures for February delivery closed up $1.21 at
$108.15 a barrel at 12:30 p.m. local time on the Dubai
Mercantile Exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
