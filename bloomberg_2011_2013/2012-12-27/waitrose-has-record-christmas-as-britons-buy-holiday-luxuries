Waitrose Ltd., the upscale grocery
chain owned by U.K. retailer John Lewis Partnership Plc,
reported record Christmas sales as hard-pressed U.K. consumers
splashed out on holiday luxuries.  Revenue at stores open at least a year rose 4.3 percent in
the seven weeks ended Dec. 24, Waitrose said today in an e-
mailed statement. Total sales increased 7.7 percent, excluding
gasoline, while customer numbers climbed 4.5 percent.  Waitrose , the first major U.K. retailer to report Christmas
sales, said the last Sunday before the holiday was its busiest
day ever as Britons stocked up for the festive meal. Treats such
as the Heston from Waitrose Hidden Sauce Figgy Pudding and
Christmas chocolate cake were among the biggest sellers.  “The key to our growth this Christmas has been a
combination of great value and inspiring, innovative products,”
said Managing Director Mark Price. “This has led to increased
volumes driving our sales uplift as more people shopped with us
and existing customers bought additional items.”  Waitrose has outperformed its larger competitors this year,
with Kantar Worldpanel data showing the grocer’s market share
rose to 4.5 percent in the 12 weeks ended Nov. 25.  Overall Christmas shopping in the U.K. was similar to last
year, according to the British Retail Consortium. Total retail
spending for the period probably rose “modestly” on last year,
though only in line with inflation, it said.  Online sales at Waitrose rose 37 percent in the seven
weeks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
