Michael Clarke  broke  Ricky Ponting ’s
Australian record for calendar-year runs as he hit a century to
help his team take control of the second cricket Test against
 Sri Lanka .  Australia captain Clarke, the No. 1-ranked Test batsman,
top scored with 106 at the Melbourne Cricket Ground to help lift
the home team to 440-8 at stumps on day two, a lead of 284 with
two first-innings wickets remaining.  Clarke shared a 194-run stand with  Shane Watson , a record
for the fourth wicket in Tests at the MCG, while lower-order
batsman  Mitchell Johnson  hit an unbeaten 73 to boost the total
as Australia seeks a series-clinching victory after winning the
opener.  “If Mitch can get a hundred that’ll be lovely and
hopefully we can bowl Sri Lanka out and not have to bat again,”
Clarke said in a televised interview.  Johnson shared a 58-run stand with  Peter Siddle  after the
Australians lost three wickets for the addition of four runs as
Sri Lanka fought back in the middle session. Watson got out for
83 when he failed to control a pull shot, missing the chance to
register his first hundred since October 2010.  Clarke, 31, earlier scored his fifth Test century of the
year to take his run tally in 2012 to 1,595, surpassing
Ponting’s national record of 1,544 set in 2005. Ponting retired
from international cricket earlier this month.  Clarke had begun the match needing 56 runs to break
Ponting’s mark in Australia’s final Test of 2012. His innings
ended when he was caught by rival skipper  Mahela Jayawardene  in
the slips off Shaminda Eranga.  “When I’ve got in I’ve just tried to cash in,” added
Clarke, who’s averaging 106.33 this year. “With experience and
learning my own game, I’ve probably just worked out how hard I
need to push myself training-wise and preparation-wise to be in
a decent place to come out and perform.”  Sri Lanka, which has failed to win any of its previous 11
Tests in Australia, was bowled out for 156 on day one after
winning the toss.  To contact the reporter on this story:
