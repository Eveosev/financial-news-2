French jobless claims jumped to an
almost 15-year high as a stalled economy prompted companies to
trim payrolls and investment.  The number of people actively looking for work rose by
29,300, or 0.9 percent, in November to 3.133 million, the Labor
Ministry said today in an e-mailed statement from Paris.
Economists predicted an increase of 25,000, according to the
median of three forecasts gathered by  Bloomberg News .  The 19th straight monthly increase brings jobless claims to
their highest since January 1998, increasing pressure on
President  Francois Hollande . His government has leaned on large
companies to avoid lay-offs, and has cut social charges in a
push to improve competitiveness.  “My objective is to make sure that unemployment, which has
continuously increased for two years, starts to decline,”
Hollande said earlier today during a visit to food market
outside Paris.  To contact the reporter on this story:
