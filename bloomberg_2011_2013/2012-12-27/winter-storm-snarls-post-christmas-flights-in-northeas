United Continental Holdings Inc. (UAL)  and
 Delta Air Lines Inc. (DAL)  joined carriers canceling more than 400
flights in the northeastern U.S. today because of a winter
storm, snarling travel for passengers returning from Christmas
vacations.  Snow piled higher than 6 inches (15 centimeters) in some
mid-Atlantic regions, and more wintry precipitation is forecast
this weekend, according to the  National Weather Service .  Today’s  cancellations  add to 2,170 flights scrubbed in the
past two days, mostly in the Midwest, as the storm dumped as
much as 14 inches of snow in northwestern  Pennsylvania  near Lake
Erie. About 42 million passengers will fly between Dec. 17 and
Jan. 6, making it one of the busiest travel seasons of the year,
the Airlines for America trade group estimates.  Philadelphia and New York’s LaGuardia airport each had
about two dozen cancellations today, while  John F. Kennedy  and
New Jersey’s Newark Liberty airports each had more than a dozen,
according to FlightAware.com, a Houston-based flight data
tracker.  Regional carriers including  Republic Airways Holdings Inc. (RJET) ,
Air Wisconsin Airlines Corp. and  SkyWest Inc. (SKYW) ’s ExpressJet unit
had the most cancellations today, with about 50 each,
FlightAware data showed. Those airlines perform flights for
bigger companies such as  US Airways Group Inc., (LCC)  United and
Delta.  To contact the reporter on this story:
