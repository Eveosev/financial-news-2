Copper in  London  jumped by the most
in almost a month on expectations that a recovering Chinese
economy will boost demand from the largest user. Aluminum, zinc,
lead, nickel and tin also advanced.  Metal for delivery in three months gained as much as 1.7
percent to $7,945.25 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange,
the most since Nov. 29, and was at $7,914 as of 1:47 p.m.
Shanghai time. The market was closed for two days for public
holidays. Copper for April delivery on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange gained 0.5 percent to 57,470 yuan ($9,213) a ton.  Chinese industrial companies’ profits rose 22.8 percent in
November from a year ago to 638.5 billion  yuan , the National
Bureau of Statistics said on its website today. That compared
with gains of 20.5 percent in October and 3 percent in the first
11 months of the year.  “Investors now strongly believe that the Chinese economy
is going to be better next year and metals demand will grow
faster than this year,” Zhang Yu, an analyst at Yongan Futures
Co., said by phone from Hangzhou. “Gains in construction-
related commodities and equities in  China  this week have clearly
showed the expectation of recovery.”  China’s urbanization is expected to spur 40 trillion yuan
of investment by 2020, the Southern Metropolis Daily reported on
Dec. 25, citing a draft plan by the National Development and
Reform Commission.  Copper for delivery in March was little changed at $3.60 a
pound on the Comex in  New York .  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
