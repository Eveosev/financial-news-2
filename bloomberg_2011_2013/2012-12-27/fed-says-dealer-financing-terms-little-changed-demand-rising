Wall Street dealers are paying more
attention to the management of concentrated exposures to central
counterparties, a Federal Reserve survey showed today.  About two-thirds of dealers indicated they had increased
the amount of resources devoted to management of concentrated
credit exposure in the three months through November, the same
trend seen in previous surveys. While funding terms were little
changed, the survey showed an “evident” uptick in demand for
financing.  “For all client types, a greater share of dealers
indicated having frequent or at least some discussion with
clients regarding prospective transactions involving collateral
transformation,” according to the Fed Senior Credit Officer
Opinion Survey on Dealer Financing Terms released today. Almost
one-third of dealers reported increased demand for funding of
agency residential mortgage-backed securities, the Fed said.  The 22 institutions surveyed, who aren’t identified,
account for “almost all of the dealer financing of dollar-
denominated securities for nondealers and are the most active
intermediaries” in over-the-counter  derivatives  markets, the
Fed said. The survey was conducted from Nov. 13 to Nov. 26.  To contact the reporter on this story:
