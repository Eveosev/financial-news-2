Egypt ’s top prosecutor has ordered
an investigation of several opposition officials over an
allegation they sought to incite the overthrow of the
government.  The call by Prosecutor-General Talaat Abdullah comes in
relation to a complaint filed by a lawyer against Nobel Laureate
Mohamed ElBaradei and former presidential contenders Amre Moussa
and Hamdeen Sabahi, according to a faxed statement from the
prosecutor’s office.  The three opposition leaders have spoken out against a
November decree by President Mohamed Mursi granting his
decisions immunity from court oversight.  The decree came in the run-up to the approval of the draft
constitution by the Islamist-dominated panel that wrote the
charter, sparking ire among the opposition who argued it
enshrined Islamic law at the expense of certain freedoms.  The charter was ratified by a majority of 64 percent in a
two-stage referendum that ended Dec. 22.  To contact the reporter on this story:
