Heating oil advanced on forecasts
for colder weather in the U.S. Northeast and for a decline in
distillate inventories from the lowest seasonal level in 12
years.  Futures rose as the  National Weather Service ’s Climate
Prediction Center  predicted  below-normal temperatures in the
Northeast from Jan. 1 to Jan. 9. The Energy Department will
probably report tomorrow that  heating oil and diesel  supplies
declined 1 million barrels last week to 116 million, according
to the median estimate of nine analysts in a survey by
Bloomberg.  “The weather is a little more seasonal and demand
expectations are rising,” said  Phil Flynn , senior market
analyst at Price Futures Group in  Chicago .  Heating oil for January delivery climbed 1.68 cents, or 0.6
percent, to $3.0681 a gallon at 9:54 a.m. on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . Futures extended this year’s increase to
4.5 percent.  The Energy Department is scheduled to report last week’s
inventories at 11 a.m. tomorrow, two days later than usual
because of the Christmas holiday. The department will probably
report that gasoline stockpiles rose 700,000 barrels, according
to the survey.  Gasoline for January delivery fell 0.29 cent to $2.8129 a
gallon, the first decline in three days. Prices are up 4.7
percent this year.  The average nationwide cost for regular gasoline rose 1.4
cents to $3.261 a gallon, AAA said today on its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
