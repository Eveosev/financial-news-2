Asia’s naphtha crack spread advanced
to the widest in seven weeks, signaling increased profit for
refiners.  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  sold gasoil cargoes in
Singapore, the region’s largest oil-trading center.  Light Distillates  The premium of Japan naphtha to London-traded Brent crude
futures climbed $15.93 to $124.13 a metric ton at 5 p.m.
Singapore time, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. This
crack spread, a measure of the profit from making the
petrochemical and gasoline feedstock, is at the widest since
Nov. 7.  Vitol Group bought 50,000 barrels of 95-RON gasoline from
 Phillips 66 (PSX)  in Singapore for Jan. 11 to Jan. 15, the earliest
loading period, according to a Bloomberg News survey of traders
who monitored transactions on the Platts window. The cargo
changed hands at $123.10 a barrel.  Middle Distillates  Shell sold two 150,000-barrel shipments of  gasoil , or
diesel, with 0.5 percent sulfur, according to the Bloomberg
survey.  Europe ’s biggest oil company gave Vitol a discount of
$2.30 a barrel to benchmark quotes for Jan. 22 to Jan. 26
loading, and a similar discount against January prices to Hin
Leong Trading Pte for Jan. 21 to Jan. 25 loading.  Gasoil’s premium to Asian marker Dubai crude dropped 8
cents to $19.47 a barrel at 2:08 p.m. Singapore time, according
to data from PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a broker. This  crack
spread , a gauge of processing profit, shrank for a third day.  Jet fuel  was unchanged after rising to a premium of 20
cents a barrel to gasoil, PVM said. A positive  regrade  shows it
is more profitable to make aviation fuel over diesel.  Fuel Oil  Fuel oil’s  discount  to Dubai crude shrank 64 cents to $7.83
a barrel at 2:08 p.m. Singapore time, according to PVM. That’s
the narrowest crack spread in five days, indicating reduced
losses for refiners producing residual fuels.  The premium of 180-centistoke fuel oil to 380-centistoke
grade, or the  viscosity spread , was unchanged for a seventh day
at $10.25 a ton, PVM data showed. This means bunker, or marine
fuel, moved in tandem with supplies used in power stations.  Singapore’s onshore inventories of residual fuels decreased
534,000 barrels, or 2.7 percent, to 19.5 million in the week to
yesterday, according to a unit of the Ministry of Trade and
Industry. Stockpiles including fuel oil and low-sulfur waxy
residue and excluding bitumen were the lowest in 10 weeks.  Tenders  Pakistan State Oil Co. bought 520,000 tons of high-sulfur
fuel oil and 110,000 tons of low-sulfur grade for January and
February delivery, according to two traders who participate in
the market, asking not to be identified because the information
is confidential.  To contact the reporters on this story:
