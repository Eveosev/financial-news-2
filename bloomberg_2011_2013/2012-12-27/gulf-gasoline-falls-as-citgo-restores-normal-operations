Gasoline weakened on the Gulf Coast
as Citgo Petroleum Corp.â€™s  Corpus Christi  West plant returned to
normal operations and U.S. inventories of motor fuel were
forecast to increase.  Citgo today restored power to the west portion of the
165,000-barrel-a-day Corpus Christi, Texas, refinery after a
 power failure  resulted in the shutdown of the sulfur recovery
system yesterday, according to filings with state regulators.  Stockpiles of motor fuel in the U.S. probably gained
850,000 barrels in the week ended Dec. 21, according to the
median estimate of 10 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Reformulated, 84-octane gasoline on the Gulf Coast fell 2
cents to a discount of 14.5 cents a gallon below futures traded
on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 2 p.m. Eastern time,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Conventional gasoline
to be blended with ethanol in the area dropped 1 cent to a
discount of 21 cents.  The discount for ultra-low-sulfur diesel slid 1.6 cents to
6.63 cents below heating oil futures, the widest gap in a week.
The same fuel was unchanged in New York at 6 cents above
futures, while reformulated gasoline in that region dropped 0.25
cent to trade at a premium of 2.25 cents.  California-blend gasoline, or Carbob, in  Los Angeles  gained
0.5 cent to 7 cents a gallon over futures. The same fuel in  San
Francisco  slid 0.5 cent to a premium of 4 cents, the second
consecutive decline.  To contact the reporter on this story:
