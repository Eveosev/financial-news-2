talks to avert a budget dispute threatening the economy of the
world’s biggest crude consumer.  The 50-stock Micex Index lost less than 0.1 percent to
1,478.24 by the close in Moscow, after rising 0.3 percent, with
24 stocks climbing and 26 dropping. The gauge has added 5.4
percent this year. Utilities retreated 0.6 percent on average,
the most of nine industry groups. Federal Grid Co. declined 1.5

negotiations aimed at avoiding more than $600 billion in tax
gains and spending cuts, known as the fiscal cliff, which are
scheduled to take effect Jan. 1. Manufacturing fell the most in
four years in December, HSBC Plc said today in an e-mailed
statement, citing data compiled by  Markit Economics .  “Investors are awaiting a decision about the fiscal
cliff,” Victor Markov, an analyst at Kapital Asset Management
LLC, said by phone from Moscow. “There’s hope that we’ll see a
decision by the end of the year. Today’s Russian manufacturing
data shows that the economy is starting to lose steam.”  Inter RAO,  Russia ’s third-largest power producer, declined
as Interfax reported the government values its stake in OAO
Irkutskenergo below its estimate. The company’s press service
didn’t respond to e-mailed requests for comment.  The amount of shares traded on the Micex was 30 percent
below the 10-day average, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Failure to reach a budget agreement would push the
U.S. into recession for the first half of 2013, the nonpartisan
 Congressional Budget Office  has said.  Manufacturing Drop  The manufacturing measure dropped to 50, compared with 52.2
last month, according to HSBC. A reading above 50 signals
expansion, while below 50 indicates contraction.  Russian markets close after Dec. 28 for New Year and
Christmas holidays, with trading restarting Jan. 8.  “Activity will continue to be low until the end of the
year,” Markov said.  The Russian government estimates Inter RAO’s 40 percent

reported yesterday, citing Economy Minister Andrei Belousov’s
Dec. 18 letter to deputy prime minister  Arkady Dvorkovich . Inter

Boris Kovalchuk, Inter RAO’s chairman.  Health-Care Stocks  Health-care stocks led the gaining shares, rising 5.6
