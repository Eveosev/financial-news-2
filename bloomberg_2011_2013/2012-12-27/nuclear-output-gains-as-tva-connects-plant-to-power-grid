U.S.  nuclear-power production  rose
for a third day as the  Tennessee Valley Authority  boosted output
at the 1,104-megawatt Browns Ferry 2 reactor in  Alabama  and
reconnected to the grid.  Total generation increased by 664 megawatts, or 0.7
percent, to 91,705 megawatts, the highest level since Sept. 14,
according to U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission data compiled by
Bloomberg. Capacity was 89 percent, the same as yesterday, while
output was  3.5 percent  less than a year ago with nine of 104
nuclear reactors offline.  TVA’s Browns Ferry 2 operated at 82 percent of capacity at
8:30 a.m. local time, said Ray Golden, a company spokesman. The
unit, 84 miles (135 kilometers) north of Birmingham, was at 19
percent when the NRC issued its daily report.  “We are continuing to escalate and anticipate it could be
at full power some time later today,” Golden, who’s based in
Knoxville,  Tennessee , said in a phone interview today.  The reactor shut Dec. 22 because of a power interruption to
protection systems that control a number of systems throughout
the unit, Golden said. Prior to the shutdown, Browns Ferry 2 set
a record for continuous operation of 562 days, he said.  The increase sent nuclear output higher by 2.5 percent to
27,568 megawatts in the NRC’s Southeast region, a third
consecutive advance, data compiled by Bloomberg showed.  Reactor maintenance shutdowns, usually undertaken in the
U.S. spring or fall when energy use is lowest, may increase
consumption of natural gas and coal to generate electricity. The
average refueling down time was 43 days in 2011, according to
the  Nuclear Energy Institute .  To contact the reporter on this story:
