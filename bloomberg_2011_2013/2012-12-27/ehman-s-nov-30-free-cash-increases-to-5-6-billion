Defunct Lehman Brothers Holdings
Inc. and its affiliates had $5.6 billion in free cash on Nov.
30, an increase of $1.1 billion during the month. Restricted
cash of $13.7  billion included $5.8 billion of reserves for
disputed claims, according to a post-bankruptcy report filed in
federal court in  Manhattan .  The former investment bank paid advisers and managers $12.8
million in November, bringing total fees since 2008 to almost
$1.8 billion. The firm is overseen by a new board since leaving
bankruptcy in March.  To contact the reporter on this story:
