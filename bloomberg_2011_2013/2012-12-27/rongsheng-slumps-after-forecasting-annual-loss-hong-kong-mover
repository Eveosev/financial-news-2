China Rongsheng Heavy Industries
Group Holdings Ltd. (1101) , the country’s largest shipbuilder outside
state control, slumped the most in a month in  Hong Kong  trading
after forecasting its first annual loss in four years.  China Rongsheng  fell  7.4 percent to close at HK$1.25, the
most since Nov. 30. The city’s benchmark  Hang Seng Index  rose
0.4 percent. The markets were closed for holidays in the
previous two days.  The shipbuilder said Dec. 24 that it may post a net loss
this year as vessel prices and orders slumped amid global
overcapacity. The company’s first-half profit had plunged 82
percent. The Baltic Dry Index, a measure of commodity shipping
rates, has fallen 57 percent this year.  “The stubbornly low freight rate has deterred shipping
companies from placing new orders because they expect vessel
prices to keep dropping,” Amos Zhang, a Shanghai-based analyst
at Shenyin & Wanguo Securities Co., said in a phone interview
today. “This is terrible for shipyards.”  The  Baltic Dry Index  slid 0.14 percent to 699 points on
Dec. 24, according to the  Baltic Exchange  in London. Shipping
companies break even at rates between 1,500 and 2,000 points,
Zhang said.  The shipbuilder previously posted an annual loss in 2008,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The company is setting
up a new offshore-energy equipment unit as it seeks contracts
for oil rigs and tender barges to offset slowing ship demand.  To contact the reporters on this story:
