OAO Rostelecom (ROSYY) , the Russian phone
company poised for its worst year since 2009, surged the most in
two months in New York after its board approved a five-year plan
to boost profitability by diversifying its services.  American depositary receipts of Rostelecom, the nation’s
biggest phone company by subscribers, rallied 3.9 percent to
$23.52 in the U.S., the biggest jump since Nov. 1. The advance
pared this year’s decline to 18 percent, the steepest plunge in
three years. The  Bloomberg Russia-US Equity Index (RUS14BN)  of the most-
traded Russian companies in the U.S. rose for a second day as
 futures  expiring in March on Moscow’s dollar-denominated RTS
Index dropped 0.6 percent to 152,880.  Rostelecom, which gets more than half of its revenue from
fixed-line phone services, is seeking to expand its Internet
broadband access, sell more mobile phone services and boost
sales from pay television services, the company said in a
statement yesterday. The Moscow-based provider will  cut costs  by
upgrading its land-line networks, it said. Rostelecom will post
the first slowdown in profit growth since 2009, according to the
mean estimate of 16 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  “Such strategy means predictability and the market
appreciates it,” Elina Kulieva, an analyst at Alfa Bank whose
rating on the company is under review, said by phone yesterday
from Moscow. “They dramatically cut their investment plans and
defined areas for future growth. Lower spending potentially
means higher dividends in the case of Rostelecom.”  The  stock  was little changed at 119.09 rubles, or $3.93. in
Moscow. One ADR equals six shares.  Dividend Yield  Rostelecom’s  dividend yield , at 3.94 percent, is the third-
lowest among global peers, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. This level compares with 16.6 percent for  France
Telecom SA (FTE)  and 8.1 percent for  Telekomunikacja Polska SA (TPS) , data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  Rostelecom plans to “gradually” boost dividend payouts to
reach the level of its peers, Chief Executive Officer Alexander Provotorov said on a conference call with analysts and investors
in Moscow on Aug. 30.  Net income is  expected  to decline to 40.5 billion rubles
($1.34 billion) in 2012 from 46.2 billion rubles in 2011,
according to the analysts surveyed.  The  Bloomberg Russia-US gauge  gained 0.8 percent to 97.96
in New York yesterday. The  Market Vectors Russia ETF (RSX) , the
largest dedicated Russian exchange-traded fund, increased 1.2
percent to $29.28, gaining by the most since Dec. 18. The RTS
Volatility Index, which measures expected swings in the stock
futures, declined 1.6 percent to 23.62 points.  CTC Viewership  CTC Media Inc. (CTCM)  was the biggest decliner on Russia-US gauge
yesterday, dropping 1.9 percent to $7.81, the lowest level since
Aug. 6. The stock is down 11 percent this year.  CTC’s television channel, the company’s biggest source of
revenue, saw its share of viewers 4 years and older fall to 6.2
percent in the week to Dec. 23, from 6.3 percent in the previous
week, TNS Global researcher said in a report yesterday.  OAO Mobile TeleSystems (MBT) , the nation’s chief mobile operator,
increased 1.8 percent to $18.46 in U.S. trading, extending its
gain this year to 26 percent. The company’s Moscow-listed  stock 
dropped 1.2 percent to 243.42 rubles, or $8.03. One ADR equals
to two shares.  Crude,  Russia ’s major export commodity that together with
natural gas accounted for half of the nation’s budget revenue in
2011, fell from the highest level in more than two months in New
York yesterday as Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said
lawmakers and President  Barack Obama  are unlikely to reach a
deal to avert a fiscal crisis.  ‘Risk Appetite’  “A resolution on the U.S. budget crisis would help foster
the greater risk appetite of which Russia would be a
beneficiary,” Julian Rimmer, a trader at CF Global in  London ,
said by e-mail yesterday.  Crude oil for February delivery slipped 0.1 percent to
$90.87 on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent oil for
February settlement slid 0.2 percent to $110.80 a barrel on the
London-based ICE Futures  Europe . The number of contracts trading
was 53 percent lower than the 100-day average.  Urals crude ,
Russia’s chief export oil blend, dropped 0.8 percent to $110.12.  Ruble futures showed the currency little changed at 30.744
per dollar yesterday after rising 0.9 percent to 30.25.  To contact the reporter on this story:
