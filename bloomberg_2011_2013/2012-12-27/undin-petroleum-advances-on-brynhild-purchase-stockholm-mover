Lundin Petroleum AB (LUPE) , a Swedish oil
and natural-gas producer, advanced the most in more than two
weeks in  Stockholm  trading after raising its stake in the
Brynhild field off Norway.  Lundin rose as much as 2.4 percent, the biggest jump since
Dec. 11, and traded up 1.9 percent at 151.30 kronor as of 2:44
p.m. local time, leading stocks in the OMX Stockholm 30 index.  The company increased its stake in Brynhild to 90 percent
after acquiring 20 percent from Talisman Energy Inc., Stockholm-
based Lundin said today in a statement. It expects to pump the
fieldâ€™s first oil in the fourth quarter of 2013 and achieve
gross plateau output of 12,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day.  Lundin, whose operations are focused on Europe and
 Southeast Asia , received approval to develop the Brynhild
deposit last year, when net peak production was estimated at
about 6,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day.  The remaining 10 percent of the field is owned by  Talisman
Energy (TLM)  Norge, part of Calgary-based Talisman Energy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
