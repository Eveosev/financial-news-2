Barclays Bank of Kenya Ltd. , the
country’s third-biggest lender by market value, said it will
begin offering a Shariah-compliant asset-finance product for
corporates companies to meet growing demand.  The lender, based in Nairobi, has set aside $30 million for
the so-called Corporate La Riba Asset Finance product, which
offers fixed pricing and repayment periods of up to five years,
Chief Executive Officer Adan Mohamed told reporters today in the
port city of  Mombasa .  “Although Islamic financing is still in its infancy, it is
witnessing a rapid growth fuelled by surging demand for Shariah-
compliant products and services from not only customers
sensitive to the Islamic faith,” Mohamed said. “We are also
witnessing an increase in the number of non-Muslims seeking
these services.”  Shariah prohibits the payment and receipt of interest.  To contact the reporter on this story:
