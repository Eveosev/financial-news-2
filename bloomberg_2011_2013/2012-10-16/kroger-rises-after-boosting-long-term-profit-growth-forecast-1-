Kroger Co. (KR) , the largest U.S.
grocery-store chain, gained the most in four months after
raising its forecast for long-term profit growth as it increases
store openings.  The shares climbed 4.3 percent to $24.44 at 12:53 p.m. in
 New York  after earlier rising as much as 6 percent for the
biggest intraday increase since June 14. Cincinnati-based Kroger
had dropped 3.3 percent this year through yesterday.  Chief Executive Officer  David Dillon  said today in a
presentation to investors that earnings per share will grow as
much as 11 percent a year in the long term. That’s up from a
previous forecast for a maximum of 8 percent.  The food seller will boost sales and profit by increasing
total store square footage and by expanding into new markets,
Dillon said during the conference. Kroger would consider the
“right”  acquisition  to help it grow, he said.  “We are going to invest to grow and expand our store base,
which will create more job opportunities over the next five
years, and beyond,” Dillon said in a statement today.  Kroger, which has about 2,425 supermarkets and department
stores, operates locations under the Ralphs, Food 4 Less and
Dillons names. It also has convenience and fine jewelry stores,
as well as fuel centers and food-processing facilities.  Kroger has been trimming  costs , helping it report profit
that topped analysts’ estimates in the first two quarters this
year. The company also has raised its outlook for profit in its
current fiscal year and approved a new $1 billion share buyback
program.  To contact the reporter on this story:
