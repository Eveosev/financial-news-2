Gold futures rebounded from a four-
week low as the dollar’s decline boosted demand for the metal as
an alternative investment. Silver also climbed.  The greenback fell as much 0.5 percent against a basket of
major currencies on speculation that  Spain  may get a line of
credit from Europe’s rescue fund, easing debt concerns in the
region. Yesterday, gold and silver tumbled the most in three
months, partly on speculation that China may refrain from
expanding economic stimulus.  “The dollar trading lower, and talk about Spain set to ask
for a bailout is helping set the positive tone,” Steve Scacalossi, a New York-based vice president at TD Securities
Inc., said in an e-mail.  Gold futures for December delivery rose 0.5 percent to
settle at $1,746.30 an ounce at 1:43 p.m. on the Comex in  New
York , the biggest advance for a most-active contract since Oct.
4.  Yesterday, the metal slumped 1.3 percent, the most since
July 6, after touching $1,729.70, the lowest since Sept. 13.  “The gold market experienced momentum-based selling but
appears to have found a base” around $1,735,  Australia & New
Zealand Banking Group Ltd. (ANZ)  analysts led by  Mark Pervan  said in a
report.  Silver futures for December delivery climbed 0.7 percent to
$32.959 an ounce on the Comex. Yesterday, the metal fell 2.8
percent, the most since June 21.  This year, silver has gained 18 percent, and gold has
climbed 11 percent.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , platinum futures for
January delivery rose 0.8 percent to $1,645.20 an ounce.
Palladium futures for December delivery advanced 1 percent to
$638.95 an ounce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
