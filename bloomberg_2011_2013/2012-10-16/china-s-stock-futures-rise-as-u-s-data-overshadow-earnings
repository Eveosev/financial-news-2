Most  Chinese stocks  rose, led by
drugmakers and consumer-staples producers, on speculation their
earnings will be most resilient to the economic slowdown.  Beijing Tongrentang Co. (600085)  led a gauge of health-care
companies to the second-biggest gain among the  CSI 300 Index (SHSZ300) ’s
industry groups after China International Capital Corp. said
drugmakers may rise in the fourth quarter amid stable earnings
growth.  ZTE Corp. (000063) , China’s second-biggest phone-equipment maker,
plunged 4.2 percent after the maker of telephone equipment said
it probably posted a loss for the third quarter.  “Third-quarter earnings for Chinese-listed companies will
be disappointing and they won’t improve unless there’s more
policy loosening,” said Wei Wei, an analyst at West China
Securities Co. “Defensive stocks are good options to hedge
against risks. The index will trade in a range.”  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  rose 0.1 point to 2,098.81 at
the close. About seven stocks rose for every five that fell. The
CSI 300 Index added 0.1 percent to 2,298.16. The  Hang Seng China
Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  of Chinese companies traded in  Hong Kong 
slipped 0.2 percent. The  Bloomberg China-US 55 Index (CH55BN) , the
measure of the most-traded U.S.-listed Chinese companies,
climbed 1.1 percent in  New York  yesterday.  Chinese stocks fell yesterday as reports on producer prices
and new yuan lending overshadowed data showing exports and  money
supply  rising more than estimated in September.  The Shanghai Composite has rebounded 4.7 percent since
reaching a three-year low on Sept. 26 on expectations regulators
will introduce measures to stabilize the market ahead of a once-
in-a-decade power transition of the Communist Party in November.
The gauge is valued at 9.8 times estimated earnings, compared
with the 17.9 average since Bloomberg began compiling the weekly
 data  in 2006.  GDP Report  China’s National Bureau of Statistics is scheduled to
release third-quarter gross domestic product data on Oct. 18.
The  economy  probably expanded 7.4 percent, the slowest pace in
more than three years, according to the median estimate of 43
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. September data for industrial
production, fixed-asset investment and retail sales are also due
on the same day.  Billionaire investor  George Soros  said China’s growth is
slowing because household spending as a percentage of the
world’s second largest economy is waning.  “The growth model which has worked is running out of steam
because consumption as a percentage of GDP has fallen” to one-
third of output from half, Soros said at a National Association
for Business Economics conference in New York yesterday. Central
bankers “will have to modify the growth model and somehow allow
the household sector to have a bigger share of the total.”  ‘Reasonable’ Valuations  Measures of consumer staples and health-care stocks in the
CSI 300 advanced 1.5 percent and 1.2 percent respectively today,
the biggest two gainers among the 10 industry groups.  Beijing Tongrentang, which makes traditional Chinese
medicine, added 1.7 percent to 17.98  yuan .  Zhejiang Hisun
Pharmaceutical Co. (600267)  advanced 2.5 percent to 16.56 yuan. Huadong
Medicine Co. climbed 0.8 percent to 36.01 yuan.  Pharmaceutical stocks, which are valued at 24 times
earnings for the past 12 months, are at “reasonable” levels
and stable expectations about earnings will help their
performance in the fourth quarter, Sun Liang, Qiang Jing and
Zhou Feng, analysts at CICC, wrote in a report today.  China’s consumer stocks may offer a “positive surprise”
for investors as the government seeks to rebalance its economy
away from investment and towards consumption, Brian Jacobsen,
chief portfolio strategist at Wells Fargo Advantage Funds in
 Menomonee Falls ,  Wisconsin , said on Bloomberg Television today.  Consumer Stocks  Anhui Gujing Distillery Co. (000596) , a white liquor maker, jumped
6.6 percent to 40.20 yuan, extending yesterday’s 4.5 percent
gain. The company said yesterday net income for the first three
quarters probably surged as much as 60 percent on higher sales.  Kweichow Moutai Co., China’s biggest producer of baijiu
liquor by market value, added 1.7 percent to 249.81 yuan.
Wuliangye Yibin Co., the second largest, climbed 1.1 percent to
35.05 yuan.  U.S. retail sales rose 1.1 percent in September following a
revised 1.2 percent increase in August, the best back-to-back
showing since late 2010, Commerce Department figures showed in
 Washington . The median forecast of 77 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg called for a 0.8 percent increase. The Federal Reserve
Bank of New York’s general economic index rose to minus 6.2 from
minus 10.4 in September, which was the lowest reading since
April 2009.  U.S. Data  “Good economic data from the U.S. will help to stabilize
the global growth outlook,” said Wei of West  China  Securities.  The U.S. is China’s second-largest export market, making up
about 17 percent of the nation’s overseas sales, according to
Shenyin & Wanguo Securities Co.  Thirty-day  volatility  in the Shanghai Composite was at 19.6
today, compared with this year’s average of 17.1. About 5.7
billion shares changed hands in the gauge, 26 percent lower than
the daily average in 2012.  ZTE tumbled 4.2 percent to 9.05 yuan. The stock plunged by
the 10 percent daily limit yesterday after the company said it
may post a loss of as much as 2 billion yuan ($319.1 million) in
the third quarter.  ZTE will “strive” to reduce losses in the fourth quarter
and raise operational efficiency, the China Securities Journal
reported today, citing the company.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
