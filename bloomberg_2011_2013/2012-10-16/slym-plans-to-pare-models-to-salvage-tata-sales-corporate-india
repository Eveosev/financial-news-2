Two weeks into his new role,  Karl Slym , managing director of  Tata Motors Ltd. (TTMT)  plans to scrap
models and change perceptions about quality as  India ’s biggest
automaker struggles to stem losses in market share.  The company, which chose the first 100,000 customers for
the Nano, the world’s cheapest car, through a lottery following
a deluge of orders in 2009, lost buyers after at least three
Nanos caught fire. The company’s market share in the utility
vehicle segment has also plummeted to 9 percent, according to
data from the industry association.  “There’s potential for pruning as we bring in new
products, as well as to make sure we have a portfolio that is
all performing,” Slym, the second  General Motors Co. (GM)  executive
hired to run the Mumbai-based company by Chairman Ratan Tata,
said in an interview. “We suffer from a little bit of
perception of poor quality from previous years. We will continue
to impact those concerns.”  Tata, which is also faced with slowing sales at its Jaguar
Land Rover unit, plans to improve features and add variants of
its more popular models at home to rival  Maruti Suzuki India
Ltd. (MSIL)  and  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  in Asia’s third-largest car market.
Tata’s utility vehicle Sumo and sedan Indigo had more quality
problems than the average compared with similar products from
Toyota and Maruti, JD Power & Associates said in a  report .  “Quality is among the top five reasons of purchase and
Tata Motors loses out on both quality as well as the lack of new
variants,” said Mohit Arora, executive director at the Asian
unit of researcher JD Power in  Singapore . Rival  Mahindra (MM)  &
Mahindra Ltd. “too has issues with quality but they have
managed to offset that with new launches,” he said.  Unexpected Drop  Tata Motors has  risen  48 percent in the past year. It rose
1 percent to 264.90 rupees at the close of trade in Mumbai,
compared to a 0.2 percent increase in benchmark BSE India
Sensitive Index.  The company on Oct. 15 reported Jaguar Land Rover sales
fell 4.3 percent to 26,461 units last month. That missed the
30,000 median estimate of 20 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg
News.  In India, Slym, who joined from GM’s China unit, where he
was executive vice-president at SAIC-GM-Wuling Automobile Co.,
will have to snare customers rushing to buy rival products.  Sales of five models of utility vehicles at Tata Motors,
which began selling the cars in 1994, rose 16 percent to 23,008
in the six months to Sept. 30, while industry volumes jumped 56
percent. Deliveries of Maruti’s Ertiga surged 10-fold to 40,366
since April when it began sales. Mahindra led the utility market
with a demand of 121,367 units.  Sumo Problems  Customers reported 145 problems per 100 Sumo vehicles,
compared with an average of 135 in the segment that was led by
Toyota Innova with 45 quality issues, according to  JD Power .
Tata Indigo had a score of 162, higher than the mean 138.  “Tata Motors needs needs to realize that customers have
more choice today and the competition is only going to get
tougher, especially in SUVs, where every manufacturer is looking
at bringing in models,” said  Deepesh Rathore , the New Delhi-
based managing director of IHS Automotive in India. “They need
to look at what Mahindra has been able to do.”  Mahindra had to close bookings twice after getting swamped
with orders following the introduction of its XUV500 SUV last
year. The vehicle initially received 8,000 orders in 10 days,
and led Mahindra to increase production to 5,000 a month, from
the initial 3,000 unit capacity.  Last month the company started selling a smaller and
cheaper version of its Xylo model named the Quanto, which got
5,000 bookings in three weeks. Mahindra today began selling the
Rexton, the first model from its  Ssangyong Motor Co. (003620)  unit which
it acquired last year.  Aria SUV  In contrast, Tata Motors’ new utility vehicles have failed
to evoke the response generated by Maruti’s Ertiga and
Mahindra’s XUV500. Total sales of the company’s  Aria  SUV and
Xenon pick up truck plunged 82 percent to 329 in the six months
though Sept. 30, while combined deliveries of Tata Safari and
the Grande dropped 39 percent in the period.  “The Aria is something that is definitely a good example
of a great product that is missing the consumer,” Slym, 50, who
joined the company on Oct. 1  said yesterday. He didn’t identify
models that might be scrapped.  Tata Motors started as Tata Engineering & Locomotive Co. in
1945. It partnered Daimler AG in 1954 to produce trucks and
moved into making passenger cars in 1991. The company first
displayed the Nano at the New Delhi auto show in 2008.  China Experience  After the fires, the company in December 2010 lengthened
warranties to four years or 60,000 kilometers (37,290 miles) and
started offering as much as 90 percent financing through unit
Tata Motors Finance Ltd. It has sold 214,932 Nanos since 2009.  Yesterday it started selling an updated version of its
Manza sedan and today introduced its new Safari Storme SUV
priced at 990,000 rupees in New Delhi. Tata Motors will offer
dedicated service advisers for the Manza Club Class that starts
at 570,000 rupees in New Delhi.  Slym’s experience in  China , the world’s biggest automobile
market, may help in changing perception, which is “dependent on
marketing,” said Umesh Karne, an analyst at Brics Securities
Ltd. in Mumbai, who  recommends  investors buy Tata Motors.  “I have to blend the international experience I’ve got
with working for multi-national companies with Tata’s local
strengths,” Slym, who has also worked with Toyota, said. “Our
aspirations are to grow domestically as well as to grow
internationally.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
