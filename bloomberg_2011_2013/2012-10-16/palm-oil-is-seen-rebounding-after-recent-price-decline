Palm oil  prices may rebound “in the
medium term” as consumer demand increases after prices dropped,
Oil World said.  World palm oil exports may total 42.57 million metric tons
in the 2012-13 season that began Oct. 1, up 5.8 percent from
40.24 million tons a year earlier, the Hamburg-based researcher
said today in an e-mailed report. Combined exports of soybean
oil, rapeseed oil and sunflower seed oil may be 19.12 million
tons, 5.4 percent smaller than a year earlier, Oil World said.  Palm oil futures have dropped 23 percent this year on the
Malaysia Derivatives Exchange, touching 2,230 ringgit ($729) a
ton on Oct. 3, the lowest for a most-active contract since
November 2009.  Soybean oil  touched the highest price in a year
on Sept. 4 on the Chicago Board of Trade, as drought in the U.S.
threatened yields. Both commodities are used for cooking.  “Palm oil has significantly improved its price
competitiveness in the food sector with record discounts
relative to soya oil,” Oil World said. “Consumers will
probably take advantage of the current attractive palm oil
prices, which are below the fundamentally justified level, while
exporters are ready sellers owing to their currently unusually
large stocks.”  World production of palm oil may total 52.28 million tons
this year, up 3.7 percent from 50.42 million tons in 2011, Oil
World said. Output in  Indonesia , the world’s biggest producer,
may rise to 26 million tons, up 8.3 percent from 24 million tons
in the previous season. The harvest in  Malaysia  may drop to
18.47 million tons, down 2.3 percent from 18.91 million tons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
