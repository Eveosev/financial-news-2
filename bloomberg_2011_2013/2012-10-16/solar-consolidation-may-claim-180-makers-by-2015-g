About 180 solar manufacturers will
probably fail or get bought by 2015 as overcapacity and low
prices drive a wave of consolidation, according to GTM Research.  Almost half of those companies are based in the U.S.,
 Europe  and  Canada , where manufacturing costs are high and
producers can’t compete with lower-priced panels from  China , the
Boston-based research company said today in a report.  The solar industry has about 35 gigawatts of excess
production capacity, which is driving down prices and will push
struggling companies out of the market, Shyam Mehta, a  New York- 
based senior solar analyst at GTM, said in an interview.  “We expect most of the manufacturing in the the high-cost
areas to close,” said Mehta. The change will be “pretty
brutal, pretty quick outside of China,” where slow capacity
rationalization will make things “difficult for everybody.”  There are about 54 “solar zombies” in China that will
probably close or get bought, companies that are operating with
government support and may have less than 300 megawatts of
capacity, the report said.  There’s about twice as much solar production capacity as
needed, and total global demand for panels may be 28.8 gigawatts
to 35.2 gigawatts this year, according to Bloomberg New Energy
Finance.  Supply and demand may be more in balance by 2014, according
to the report. The top solar manufacturers in 2015 will include
 Canadian Solar Inc. (CSIQ) ,  First Solar Inc. (FSLR) , Hanwha SolarOne Co., JA
Solar Holdings Co. and JinkoSolar Holding Co.  To contact the reporter on this story:
