Lithuania’s  Supreme Court  exonerated
two former executives at the Baltic nation’s oil refinery of
criminal negligence charges stemming from a fire that damaged
the plant in 2006.  The tribunal rejected prosecutors’ request to annul a lower
court decision that acquitted Paul Nelson English and Barton Lee
Luck, the former chief executive officer and his deputy at then-
Mazeikiu Nafta AB, now Orlen Lietuva AB. The ruling is final,
Vilnius-based Supreme Court said on its website today.  Mazeikiu, bought by Poland’s PKN Orlen SA in 2006, was
damaged by fire on Oct. 12 of that year after an oil-product
leak in the distillation unit, forcing the company to reduce
production. Prosecutors in May 2007 accused English and Luck of
ignoring safety requirements to boost profit and not stopping
equipment for repairs on a regular basis.  “It was not established that the actions of the former
heads of Mazeikiu Nafta exhibited signs of the crime of which
they were accused,” the court said. The lower court “reached
this conclusion through appropriate explanation and application
of the norms of criminal law,” it said.  Orlen’s Lithuania unit received a  first insurance (FINS)  payment
for the 2006 fire of $70 million in September 2008, and a second
payment of $40 million in January 2008, according to information
the company provided to Bloomberg at the time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
