RWE AG (RWE) , Germany’s second-biggest
utility, sold a stake in a Norwegian oil license to Austria’s
 OMV AG (OMV)  for as much as 283 million euros ($369 million).  RWE Dea Norge AS sold a fifth of the license for the Edvard
Grieg development to OMV for 247.9 million euros plus 35 million
euros if operational milestones are achieved, RWE said today in
a statement. RWE Dea Chief Executive Officer Thomas Rappuhn said
the sale is an “important part” of RWE’s asset-sales target.  RWE, based in Essen, is cutting costs and selling assets
after German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  ordered a permanent halt
to all nuclear reactors by 2022 following Japan’s Fukushima
meltdown. The sale, subject to approval from Norway’s Ministry
of Petroleum and Energy and its Ministry of Finance, is expected
to be completed during the fourth quarter, according to RWE.  To contact the reporter on this story:
