China ’s yuan forwards declined,
halting a three-day gain, before a government report that may
show economic growth slowed for a seventh straight quarter.  Economic fundamentals and capital flows don’t support yuan
appreciation, the China Securities Journal reported in a
commentary today. Gross domestic product increased 7.4 percent
in the three months through September from a year earlier,
easing from 7.6 percent in the previous period, according to the
median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey before data due Oct.
18. Opponents of President  Barack Obama  contend that China keeps
its currency undervalued to boost exports, putting counterparts
in the U.S. at a disadvantage.  “Some investors could be taking profit from the recent
rapid gains in the  yuan  as they are cautious on the economy,”
said Patrick Cheng, a foreign-exchange analyst at Haitong
International Securities Co. in Hong Kong. “The U.S. elections
will continue to provide support to the yuan in coming weeks.”  Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards declined 0.06 percent
to 6.3595 per dollar as of 4:30 p.m. in Hong Kong, a 1.5 percent
discount to the onshore rate of 6.2640, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The currency touched 6.2580 yesterday in
the  spot market , the strongest level since the government
unified the official and market exchange rates at the end of
1993, China Foreign Exchange Trade System prices show.  Obama is competing with his Republican challenger  Mitt
Romney  in a televised commercial war on China trade. They are
set to hold the second presidential elections debate later
today. The yuan has advanced 2.1 percent since reaching this
year’s low of 6.3967 on July 25.  The People’s Bank of China raised the  reference rate  today
by 0.01 percent to 6.3106 per dollar, the strongest since June
21. The yuan can trade as much as 1 percent on either side of
the fixing. In Hong Kong’s offshore market, the currency slipped
0.05 percent to 6.2635.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate
swings used to price options dropped 10 basis points to 1.7
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
