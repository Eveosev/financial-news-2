Croatian foreign direct investment
fell in the first half of 2012 from the same period a year ago
to 154 million euros ($200 million), according to  central bank
data .  FDI reached 485 million euros in the first six months of
2011, according to data released by the central bank last
October.  Croatia , which is set to become the  European Unionâ€™s  28th
member in July 2013, is struggling to recover from three years
of recession or stagnation. The economy contracted 2.2 percent
in the second quarter of the year from a year earlier. FDI was
4.2 billion euros in 2008, the last pre-crisis year.  To contact the reporter responsible for the story:
