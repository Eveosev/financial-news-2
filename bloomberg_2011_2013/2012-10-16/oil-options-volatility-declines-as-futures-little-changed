Crude oil options volatility fell as
underlying futures moved less than 0.3 percent for the third
straight day.  Implied volatility for options expiring in December, a
measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge of
options prices, was 30.57 percent at 4:05 p.m. in  New York , down
from 31.33 yesterday.  December-delivery crude oil rose 22 cents to settle at
$92.54 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .  The most active options in electronic trading today were
January $60 puts, which rose 4 cents to 6 cents a barrel at 4:11
p.m. with 2,944 lots trading. November $90 puts were the second-
most active, with 2,785 lots exchanged as they declined 16 cents
to 11 cents a barrel.  Jim Colburn, a vice president and energy options broker at
Jefferies Bache LLC in New York, said that as of 2:33 p.m.
26,000 January $60 puts traded at 5 cents and 6 cents.  Bearish bets accounted for 69 percent of the 41,016
contracts in electronic trading. One contract covers 1,000
barrels of oil.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on open-
outcry volume, where the bulk of options activity occurs.  In the previous session, bets that prices would fall made
up 56 percent of the 103,133 contracts traded.  December $75 puts were the most actively traded options
yesterday with 7,402 lots changing hands. They fell 2 cents to
10 cents a barrel. November $90 puts declined 19 cents to 27
cents on volume of 5,034 lots.  Open interest was highest for December $120 calls with
67,834 contracts. Next were December $80 puts with 52,755 lots
and December $125 calls with 45,309.  To contact the reporter on this story:
