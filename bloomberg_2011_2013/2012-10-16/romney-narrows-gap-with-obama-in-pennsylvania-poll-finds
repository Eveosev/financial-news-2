Republican presidential nominee  Mitt Romney , continuing his post-debate surge, closed to within 4
percentage points of President  Barack Obama  among likely voters
in  Pennsylvania , narrowing a 12-point gap less than a month ago.  The  Quinnipiac University  poll of likely voters conducted
Oct. 12-14 gave the president a 50 percent to 46 percent
advantage, compared with Obama’s 54 percent to 42 percent lead
in the Sept. 18-24 survey before the two men held their first
nationally televised debate on Oct. 3 in Denver. They debate
again tonight.  Romney is “coming on strong in the Keystone State,” said
Tim Malloy, assistant director of the Quinnipiac polling
institute in Hamden,  Connecticut .  The Republican candidate opened up a 4-point national lead
over Obama among likely voters, 50 percent to 46 percent, in the
 Gallup tracking poll  covering the period Oct. 9-15. That’s his
largest lead in the survey, which has a margin of error of plus
or minus 2 percentage points.  The Pennsylvania results released today are similar to
Quinnipiac polls conducted with  CBS News  and the  New York  Times
in Colorado and Wisconsin, which showed gains for Romney in
those swing states, albeit not as dramatic as in Pennsylvania.  In Pennsylvania, Obama led among likely women voters, 57
percent to 39 percent, while Romney held the advantage among
men, 54 percent to 43 percent. Likely voters who described
themselves as independent were behind Obama, 50 percent to 43
percent.  Favorability Ratings  A majority of likely voters, 52 percent, said they viewed
Obama favorably while 45 percent said they had an unfavorable
opinion. By comparison, 46 percent said they viewed Romney
favorably while 44 percent saw him negatively.  The Republican nominee for  U.S. Senate , businessman  Tom
Smith , also surged in the Quinnipiac poll. He now trails
Democratic Senator Bob Casey Jr. by 48 percent to 45 percent
among likely voters. In a July 24-30 survey, Casey led 55
percent to 37 percent.  The poll was taken after Smith suggested that a woman
impregnated by a rapist faced a decision similar to that of a
pregnant unmarried woman contemplating whether to give birth.
Smith later tried to clarify his comments, saying he didn’t
intend to compare the two circumstances.  The survey of 1,519 likely voters had a margin of error of
plus or minus 2.5 percentage points.  In  New Jersey , Obama led 51 percent to 43 percent, almost
unchanged from his 51 percent to 44 percent edge in Quinnipiac’s
Aug. 27-Sept. 2 survey. Democratic Senator  Robert Menendez  was
ahead of Republican challenger Joseph Kyrillos, a state senator,
55 percent to 37 percent.  Quinnipiac’s survey of 1,319 likely voters taken Oct. 10-14
had a margin of error of plus or minus 2.7 percentage points.  Obama carried 55 percent of the vote in Pennsylvania and 57
percent in New Jersey in winning both states in 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
