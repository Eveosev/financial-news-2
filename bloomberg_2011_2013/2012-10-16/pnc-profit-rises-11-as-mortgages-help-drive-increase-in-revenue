PNC Financial Services Group Inc. (PNC) ,
the seventh-largest  U.S. bank  by deposits, fell the most since
June after reporting a third-quarter profit that missed
analysts’ estimates.  PNC slid 4 percent to close at $60.40 in New York, the
worst performance in the 81-company Standard & Poor’s  500
Financials Index. (S5FINL)  The shares have  gained  4.7 percent this year,
compared with a 24 percent advance for the index.  Net income rose to $925 million, or $1.64 per share, from
$834 million, or $1.55, a year earlier, the Pittsburgh-based
bank said today in a statement. Excluding the effects of
securities transactions and integration costs, profit was $1.63
a share. The  average estimate  of 32 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg was $1.66. Return on common equity dropped to 10.15
percent from 10.25 percent in the third quarter last year.  “We think the street will be moderately disappointed in
PNC’s third-quarter revenue and core earnings power,” Ed Najarian, an analyst at International Strategy & Investment
Group LLC, said in a note.  PNC’s net interest margin, the difference between what a
bank pays in deposits and what it charges for loans, fell to
3.82 percent in the third quarter from 3.89 percent a year
earlier and from 4.08 percent in this year’s second quarter.
Total loans climbed 18 percent to $181.9 billion from a year
earlier and slowed to a 1 percent increase from this year’s
second quarter.  Non-Interest Income  “Loan growth slowed down and there was compression on the
net interest margin,” Terry McEvoy, an Oppenheimer & Co.
analyst, said in a phone interview. PNC expects an increase in
preferred dividends and that, “combined with a lower starting
base for the margin, could make certain investors concerned that
there’s some downside risk to consensus earnings for next
year.”  PNC, led by Chief Executive Officer Jim Rohr, 63, said last
month it expects 2013 revenue to exceed this year’s total. The
lender projects an increase in fee income, particularly from new
customers, Rohr told investors at a conference in  September .  “We continued to increase the number of customers we
serve, resulting in revenue and loan growth,” Rohr said in the
statement. “We also remained focused on controlling costs while
investing for the future and  managing risk  and capital.”  Non-interest income climbed 23 percent to $1.69 billion in
the third quarter from a year earlier, according to the
statement. Helping fuel that increase was residential mortgage
banking income, which rose 15 percent to $264 million. Corporate
services income grew 58 percent to $295 million.  Increased Lending  Total revenue for the quarter was $4.09 billion, a 15
percent increase from a year earlier. Net interest income rose
10 percent to $2.4 billion.  The bank set aside $228 million for loan losses in the
quarter, compared with $261 million a year earlier. Net write-
offs declined 9.3 percent to $331 million.  Non-interest expenses rose 24 percent to $2.65 billion from
the same period last year. PNC said the increase was primarily
driven by costs related to the acquisition of RBC Bank USA and
non-cash charges related to the redemption of trust-preferred
securities. Personnel expenses also rose, climbing 23 percent to
$1.17 billion as higher stock market prices drove an increase in
the cost of deferred compensation obligations, PNC said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
