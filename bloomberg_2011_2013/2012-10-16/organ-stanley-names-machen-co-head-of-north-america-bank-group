Morgan Stanley (MS)  named Travis Machen
as co-head of its North American bank group, which advises
depository institutions on mergers and acquisitions and helps
them issue stocks and bonds.  Machen will head the group alongside Grant Gregory, who was
put in charge of the unit last year, according to a memo
obtained by Bloomberg News. Mary Claire Delaney, a Morgan
Stanley spokeswoman, confirmed the contents of the memo.  Morgan Stanley ranks third among M&A advisers on bank deals
announced this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Machen advised Spainâ€™s  Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA (BBVA)  on a
$500 million agreement in June to sell its Puerto Rico business
to  Oriental Financial Group Inc. (OFG) , and last year helped
 BankUnited Inc. (BKU)  on its $783 million initial public offering.  To contact the reporter on this story:
