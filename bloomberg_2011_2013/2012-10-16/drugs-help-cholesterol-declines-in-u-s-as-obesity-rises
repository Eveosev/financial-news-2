Drugs like  Pfizer Inc. (PFE) ’s Lipitor and
healthier diets containing fewer  trans fats  have led to lower
cholesterol levels in the U.S. in the past two decades, even as
obesity rates soared, a study found.  Total cholesterol declined 5 percent on average between
1988 and 2010, while “bad” cholesterol, or LDL, dropped 10
percent and “good” cholesterol, or HDL, rose 3.4 percent,
according to research published today in the  Journal of the
American Medical Association . The number of people using
cholesterol-lowering medicines rose to 16 percent in 2007-2010
from 3 percent in 1988-1994.  High cholesterol is a major risk factor for heart disease
and stroke, according to the  American Heart Association . Less
smoking, better diets and widely prescribed cholesterol-lowering
medicines have all helped to lower levels in the U.S., the
authors said. About one-third of American adults are obese.  “Even though we’ve had this increase in obesity, some of
those negative consequences have been balanced by the reductions
of smoking and  trans fats  in our diet,” said Donna Arnett,
president of the Dallas-based American Heart Association, in a
telephone interview yesterday. “In the U.S., we have been
improving our cholesterol levels and improving our
cardiovascular health and that’s good news.  Researchers in the study analyzed data from 37,810 patients
who were part of the  National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey  from 1988-1994, 1999-2002 and 2007-2010.  Below Target  They found that total cholesterol fell to 196 milligrams
per deciliter of blood in 2007-2010 from 206 mg/dL in 1988-1994,
dropping below the target of 200 mg/dL set by Healthy People
2010, which provides  10-year national health objectives . Bad
cholesterol levels, or LDL, dropped to 116 from 129, while good
cholesterol, or HDL, rose to 52.5 from 50.7.  The American Heart Association  recommends  that total
cholesterol be less than 200 to prevent heart attacks and
strokes, while LDL be less than 100 and HDL be above 60 to
protect against  heart disease .  Even those not taking the medications saw a drop in
cholesterol levels, which the study said was probably due in
part to “a decrease in consumption of trans-fatty acids or
other healthy lifestyle changes.”  “They are unlikely to be the result of changes in physical
activity, obesity or intake of saturated fat,” the researchers
wrote. Obese adults had a decline in total cholesterol and LDL
but not an increase in HDL levels, the authors said.  78 Million  The number of obese American adults has more than doubled
in the past 30 years to about 78 million, according to the
Atlanta-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  More research is needed to better understand what exactly
is behind the decrease in cholesterol levels since the decline
can’t be explained by cholesterol-lowering medicines alone, said
lead study author Margaret Carroll, a survey statistician at the
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, part of the
CDC, in Hyattsville,  Maryland .  “What we presented is data for the population as a whole,
she said in an telephone interview yesterday. “And the good
news is total and bad cholesterol have gone down and we’ve seen
an increase in the good cholesterol.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
