Indonesian government bonds advanced,
pushing the 10-year yield to a two-month low, after foreign
funds pumped money into the nation’s securities to seek better
returns. The rupiah was little changed.  Overseas investors have added  6.44 trillion rupiah  ($671
million) to their holdings of local sovereign debt since the
Federal Reserve announced a third round of asset purchases that
boost the supply of dollars on Sept. 13, finance ministry data
show. Indonesian notes due 2022 yielded 5.83 percent, compared
with 4.74 percent for  Philippines , rated the same at Standard &
Poor’s, and 3.49 percent for  Thailand , three levels higher at
the rating company.  “ Indonesia ’s bonds have room to rally further,” said
Artanavaro Gasali, the head of global markets at PT Bank ICBC
Indonesia in Jakarta. “Yields are still high compared to their
peers.”  The yield on the government’s 7 percent bonds due May 2022
fell one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 5.83 percent
as of 9:16 a.m. in Jakarta, the lowest level since Aug. 10,
according to prices from the Inter Dealer Market Association.
The rate has dropped six basis points in four days.  The rupiah was steady at 9,590, prices from local banks
compiled by Bloomberg show. It reached 9,657 on Oct. 11, the
weakest level since October 2009. One-month implied volatility,
which measures exchange-rate swings used to price options, held
at 6 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
