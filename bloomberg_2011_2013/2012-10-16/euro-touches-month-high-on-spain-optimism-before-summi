The euro strengthened to a one-month
high against the dollar after Spain kept its investment-grade
credit rating from Moody’s Investors Service before European
leaders gather tomorrow for a two-day summit in Brussels.  The yen fell to its lowest level against the dollar in
almost a month after a Nikkei report said the  Bank of Japan (8301)  will
face pressure to boost monetary stimulus at its next meeting
ending Oct. 30. The dollar weakened versus all of its major
peers as U.S. housing starts rose to a four-year high last
month, damping demand for safer assets. The 17-nation euro
appreciated for a fifth day versus the yen as Spanish and
Italian bonds rallied.  “What helped spark this latest move is the fact that
Moody’s didn’t cut Spain below investment grade,” Marc Chandler, global head of currency strategy at Brown Brothers
Harriman & Co. in New York, said in a telephone interview. “The
big risk-on move today took place because of Spain.”  The euro gained 0.5 percent to $1.3119 at 5 p.m. New York
time, after reaching $1.3140, the highest level since Sept. 17.
The common currency advanced 0.6 percent to 103.56 yen. The yen
declined 0.1 percent to 78.93 per U.S. dollar, after
strengthening as much as 0.3 percent.  The shared currency may appreciate to its highest level in
nearly eight months after breaking out above $1.3074, Cilline Bain, a London-based technical analyst at Credit Suisse Group
AG, wrote today in a client note. If the euro can exceed the
$1.3172-to-$1.3178 resistance zone, it could rise to $1.3388,
the highest point since Feb. 29, Bain wrote. Resistance refers
to an area on a chart where sell orders may be gathered.  Peso, Zloty  The Argentine peso fell versus all 31 of its expanded-major
counterparts tracked by Bloomberg to its lowest-ever point
versus the greenback. The currency decreased as much as 0.4
percent to 4.7314 per dollar.  Poland’s zloty reached to a two-week low after the
country’s  industrial output  contracted the most in more than
three years. The currency increased 0.1 percent to 3.1245 per
dollar after earlier falling 0.4 percent, its lowest level since
Oct. 5.  The New Zealand dollar climbed to its highest level in one
month as speculation Spain is closer to requesting a sovereign
bailout eased concern  Europe ’s debt crisis was widening and
spurred appetite for riskier assets.  The so-called kiwi gained 1 percent to 82.19 U.S. cents,
after dropping 0.5 percent to 81.41 yesterday.  Aussie Rises  Australia ’s currency appreciated to a two-week high versus
the greenback as investors sought higher-yielding assets.  The so-called Aussie rose 1.1 percent to $1.0383, touching
the strongest level since Oct. 1.  The pound climbed to a one-week high against the dollar
after the Office for National Statistics said jobless-benefit
claims fell 4,000 in September to 1.57 million. The unemployment
rate measured by International Labor Organization methods
declined to 7.9 percent between June and August.  Sterling gained 0.2 percent to $1.6149 after rising to
$1.6178, the highest since Oct. 5.  Gains in the pound were tempered after minutes of the Bank
of England’s Oct. 3-4 meeting released today showed that some
policy makers felt there was “considerable scope” for more
asset purchases to boost the economy.  Spain’s Debt  Moody’s said yesterday it kept Spain’s credit rating at
Baa3, one step above junk, as the risk that the nation would
lose market access had fallen because of the European Central
Bank’s willingness to purchase its bonds.  Spain’s  10-year bond yield  fell as much as 34 basis points
to 5.46 percent, the lowest since April 4, while Italian 10-year
yields declined to the least since March 19. Benchmark Spanish
borrowing costs have dropped more than 2 percentage points from
their record high of 7.75 percent on July 25.  European Union leaders start a two-day summit in Brussels
tomorrow, where they may seek agreement on more help for  Greece .  Options traders are the least bearish on the euro versus
the dollar in more than two years.  The premium for six-month options granting the right to
sell the euro against the dollar relative to those allowing for
purchases was 1.15 percentage points, the least since Oct. 15,
2010, based on closing prices compiled by Bloomberg. That’s down
from a 2012 high of 3.715 percentage points on May 23, the 25-
delta risk reversal rate show.  Risk reversals measure the difference between implied
volatility, or a gauge of price and demand, on similar puts and
calls. Traders pay a premium for puts when they expect the euro
to decline.  Bailout Discussions  “There has been talk about renewed appetite on behalf of
Spain to take advantage of the next financial bailout package,”
Michael Woolfolk, senior currency strategist in New York at  Bank
of New York Mellon Corp. (BK) , said in a telephone interview.  The  Dollar Index (DXY)  dropped for a second day as housing starts
jumped 15 percent to an 872,000 annual rate last month, the most
since July 2008 and exceeding all forecasts in a Bloomberg
survey of economists, Commerce Department figures showed today
in  Washington . The median estimate of 81 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg called for 770,000.  The Dollar Index, which IntercontinentalExchange Inc. uses
to track the greenback against the currencies of six U.S.
trading partners, declined 0.5 percent to 79.026, touching the
lowest level since Sept. 18.  To contact the reporter on this story:
