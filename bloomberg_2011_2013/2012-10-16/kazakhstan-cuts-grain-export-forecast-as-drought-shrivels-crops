Kazakhstan, the biggest wheat
producer in Central Asia, lowered its grain export forecast for
this season and sees prices rising after drought cut the harvest
by about 55 percent.  Grain exports may fall to 8 million metric tons from a
previous target of 10 million tons, according to a statement
from the Kazakh Agriculture Ministry today. The crop may shrink
to 12 million tons after drying and cleaning this year, from a
record 26.9 million tons last year.  The slumping harvest caused a surge in local wheat prices
to $280 a ton in the first 10 days of October from $155 a ton in
July, Yevgeny Aman, the ministry’s executive secretary, said
today during a government meeting in the Kazakh capital Astana.
At Black Sea ports, the price rose to $350 a ton from $270.  Kazakhstan, the biggest wheat producer in Central Asia, has
about 9.8 million tons of grain left from last year, which with
this year’s harvest is enough to meet domestic demand and export
grain, Aman said. After last year’s crop, Kazakh grain exports
more than doubled in the marketing year that ended June 30 to
12.1 million tons, the ministry said July 10.  “About 4.5 million tons of wheat and about 2.3 million
tons of flour calculated in grain equivalent will be shipped
abroad” in the marketing year, which started July 1, Grain
Union President Nurlan Tleubayev said during the government
meeting. “All together, 6.5 million to 7 million tons.”  Stockpile Sales  Farmers have brought in crops from 15 million hectares, or
99.7 percent of the planted area, and milled about 14 million
tons of grain in bunker weight so far, according to the
ministry. The average yield per hectare declined to 960
kilograms this year from 1,530 kilograms in 2011 as dry weather
damaged crops.  Kazakhstan’s state grain trader started to sell 1.3 million
tons of stockpiled cereals to local millers on Aug. 1 to cap
bread prices after the drought hurt the country’s main growing
regions. The amount is 50 percent of domestic demand. JSC
National Co. Food Contract Corp., which is supplying grain
during the year at a fixed price of 28,000 tenge ($186) a ton,
has already sold 247,400 tons, the Agriculture Ministry said
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
