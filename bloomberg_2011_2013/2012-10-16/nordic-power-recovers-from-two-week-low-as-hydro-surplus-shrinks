Nordic power for delivery in January
to March pared early gains as wetter weather forecasts point to
a smaller-than-earlier decrease of water in the region.  The next-quarter contract rose as much as 1.5 percent to
41.50 euros on Nasdaq OMX Group Inc.’s energy exchange in Oslo
and was at 41.30 euros ($53.89) a megawatt-hour at 1:35 p.m.
Power for next-month delivery rose as much as 1.8 percent to
39.15 euros, and later traded at 39.10 euros.  The latest weather forecasts mean that surplus hydropower
reserves may decline 23 percent in the coming two weeks to 7.1
terawatt-hours, indicating a 0.3 terawatt-hour build in
reservoirs compared with a drier early-morning forecast,
Markedskraft AS data on Bloomberg show.  The Nordic area gets about a fifth of its power from
nuclear reactors and half by running  water through turbines ,
which means rainfall and reactor generating rates affect prices.  Fourteen Nordic nuclear plants run by Vattenfall AB, EON
AG,  Fortum Oyj (FUM1V)  and Teollisuuden Voima Oyj were producing at a
combined capacity of 88 percent this morning, data from company
websites and calculations by Bloomberg show. That’s the highest
rate since Bloomberg started compiling the data in August.  EON’s Oskarshamn-2 reactor in  Sweden  may be ordered to halt
production by the country’s nuclear regulator from Dec. 31 to
June 1 due to a delayed safety upgrade, public broadcaster
Sveriges Radio reported today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
