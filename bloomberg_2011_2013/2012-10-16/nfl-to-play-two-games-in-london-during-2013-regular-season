The National Football League will
play two regular-season games in  London  next season for the
first time, with Commissioner Roger Goodell calling it the next
step in growing the sport outside the U.S.  The NFL said yesterday the Minnesota Vikings will host the
Pittsburgh Steelers on Sept. 29, 2013, at Wembley Stadium. The
league had previously announced an Oct. 7 meeting in London
between the Jacksonville Jaguars and San Francisco 49ers.  “Since we started playing regular-season games in London
five years ago, we have heard very clearly from our U.K. fans --
they want more football,” Goodell said in a statement. “We
believe that more football will lead to more fans.”  The NFL has played regular-season games at Wembley since
2007, drawing between 76,000 and 84,000 fans for each of those
five contests. The league said its U.K. fan base has increased
32 percent over the past two seasons and television ratings for
Sunday NFL games are up 154 percent since 2006, the year before
the international series began.  The Jaguars have agreed to play one home game in London
each year from 2013 through 2016.  The Steelers, who have won six Super Bowl titles, next
season will play in London for the first time. The Vikings will
make their first trip since 1983, when they played a preseason
game at Wembley.  “This is a unique opportunity for the Vikings organization
to highlight our brand on an international level,” Vikings
Owner Mark Wilf said in a statement.  The St. Louis Rams will host the New England Patriots in
this season’s game in London on Oct. 28.  Candidate Cities  The NFL also said yesterday at its meeting in  Chicago  that
Miami and Santa Clara,  California , have been selected as
finalists to host the 50th Super Bowl in 2016. The 49ers are
scheduled to open their planned $1.18 billion stadium in Santa
Clara in 2014.  The host city will be chosen in May and whichever one isn’t
selected will compete with Houston for the right to hold the
2017 championship game, Goodell said. South  Florida  has been
home to the Super Bowl 10 times, most recently in 2010, while
Palo Alto was the last city in the San Francisco area to host
the title game 27 years ago.  “We are excited to bid for the first Super Bowl in the Bay
Area since January of 1985,” 49ers Chief Executive Officer Jed York said in a statement. “Nothing brings a region together
like a Super Bowl. Now we have to work together to show the new
stadium in Santa Clara will put on a great show.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
