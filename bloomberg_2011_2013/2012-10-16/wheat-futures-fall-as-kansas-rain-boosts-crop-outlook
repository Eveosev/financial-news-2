Wheat futures fell for the third
straight session on speculation that rain in parts of  Kansas , the
biggest U.S. grower of winter varieties, will boost crop
prospects.  Precipitation increased soil moisture in central and eastern
counties in Kansas. Yesterday, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture 
reported that 81 percent of the state’s winter  crop  was planted
as of Oct. 14, up from 65 percent a week earlier, while wheat
dropped to a 13-week low.  “The rain was pretty widespread,”  Jeff McReynolds , the
owner of McReynolds Marketing & Investments in Hays, Kansas, said
in a telephone interview. “The northwest part of the state
didn’t get anything, so we still have a fairly sizeable dry
patch, but for the rest of the state, this is going to be enough
to allow the crop to be planted and germinate.”  Wheat futures for December delivery fell 0.1 percent to
settle at $8.4775 a bushel at 2 p.m. on the Chicago Board of
Trade. The price has dropped 4.3 percent in three sessions.  In the U.S., wheat is the fourth-largest crop, valued at
$14.4 billion in 2011, behind corn, soybeans and hay, government
data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
