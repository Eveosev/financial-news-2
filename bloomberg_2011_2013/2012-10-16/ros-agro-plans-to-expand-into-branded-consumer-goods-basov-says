Ros Agro Plc, a Russian agricultural
producer, seeks to expand into  consumer goods , Chief Executive
Officer Maxim Basov said at the Adam Smith conference on FMCG in
Russia Moscow.  Ros Agro, which produces sugar, pork and sunflower oil,
wants to get half its revenue from branded products in as soon
as five years, Basov said. Russia’s largest producer of branded
sugar plans to expand into branded production of meat and sauces
based on sunflower oil, Basov said.  Producing branded goods rather than soft commodities is
“an excellent opportunity for making money,” Basov said. Ros
Agro also seeks to export more products to Asia, including
China, Pakistan and Afghanistan, as well as former Soviet
republics, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
