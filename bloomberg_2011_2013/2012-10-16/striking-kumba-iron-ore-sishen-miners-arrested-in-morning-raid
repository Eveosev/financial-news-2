Police in South Africa arrested more
than 40 striking mine workers at  Kumba Iron Ore Ltd. (KIO) ’s Sishen
operation today.  Security officers joined police in a raid at a mine dump
that started at 3 a.m. and is still taking place, Hendrik Swart,
a police spokesman in the Northern Cape, said by phone from near
Kathu. Police recovered mining equipment worth 3.3 billion rand
($376 million) that had been seized by the miners, he said.  “We will determine exactly how many people were arrested
once the operation is completed,” Swart said. Kumba Iron Ore, a
subsidiary of  Anglo American Plc (AGL) , couldn’t immediately be
reached for comment.  About 300 workers at Pretoria-based Kumba’s Sishen mine
downed tools on Oct. 3 to demand monthly salary increases of
15,000 rand. The company, which is losing 120,000 metric tons of
production a day, brought criminal charges against the workers,
including extortion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
