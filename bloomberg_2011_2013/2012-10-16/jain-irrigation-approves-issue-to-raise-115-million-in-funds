Jain Irrigation Systems Ltd. (JI) , Asia’s
biggest irrigation-equipment maker, said today that it approved
raising about $115 million in funds though a combination of
preferential issue and foreign currency bonds.  The Jalgaon, India-based company that manufactures drip and
sprinkler irrigation systems also said in a statement to the
Bombay Stock Exchange that it received $75 million as a loan
from the International Finance Corp., part of the  World Bank ,
and others.  Jain said last month that it planned to raise about $200
million by issuing shares and other securities to strengthen its
balance sheet, lower interest costs and for investments. The
company’s shares have declined 14 percent this year.  India ’s government has encouraged the use of drip
irrigation in a country where 55 percent of the farmlands are
rain-fed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
