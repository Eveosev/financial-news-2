Federal Reserve Governor  Sarah Bloom Raskin  said risk at some financial institutions has increased
because of lax management within the firms.  “I have seen a disturbing uptick in what we call
operational risk,” Raskin said on a panel today in  Boston ,
referring to errors stemming from substandard bank management.  “The easiest example of this is robo-signing, which we saw
quite a bit going on in the mortgage crisis, where institutions
were outsourcing a lot of their mortgage compliance work to
third parties,” Raskin said. This sort of error can lead to
reputational and legal risk, she said at Suffolk University Law
School. She didn’t discuss the outlook for monetary policy or
the economy or mention a particular financial institution.  The Fed is implementing the Dodd-Frank Act, the biggest
overhaul of financial regulation since the 1930s, and pushing to
raise capital standards for the largest banks, subjecting them
to annual stress tests and boosting scrutiny of their lending
and trading practices.  Raskin said regulators are taking appropriate steps to
implement Dodd-Frank and that “I have not seen over-correction
by the regulators” or “overzealous rule-writing.”  Raskin, 51, was appointed to the Fed’s board of governors
by President  Barack Obama  in 2010. She previously served as
commissioner of banking regulation for the state of  Maryland .  To contact the reporter on this story:
