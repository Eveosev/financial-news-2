California  was sued by the Sierra
Club and other groups seeking to block approval of new oil and
gas wells because regulators have allegedly failed to consider
or evaluate the risks of hydraulic fracturing, or fracking.  The state’s division of oil, gas and geothermal resources
regularly approves permits for wells without any environmental
analysis about the health effects of fracking by excluding such
projects from review, lawyers for the groups said in a complaint
filed today in state court in Oakland, California.  The division doesn’t currently track, monitor or have any
specific standards for hydraulic fracturing of oil and gas
wells, and doesn’t know where or how often fracking occurs in
California, according to the complaint.  The lawsuit seeks a court order declaring the practice
violates state environmental laws and an order prohibiting
approval of new wells until the state evaluates the risks of
fracking.  California’s conservation department, named as a defendant,
hasn’t been served with a lawsuit, said Ed Wilson, an agency
spokesman, in an e-mail. The department doesn’t comment on
pending litigation, he said.  In fracking, millions of gallons of chemically treated
water and sand are forced underground to break shale rock and
free trapped gas. The process has been blamed for groundwater
contamination.  The case is Center for Biological Diversity v. California
Department of Conservation, RG12-652054, Superior Court of
California, Alameda County (Oakland).  To contact the reporter on this story:
