Dartmouth College’s endowment had a 5.8 percent return on investments in fiscal 2012, outpacing the results of other Ivy League schools that have reported so far.  The endowment’s value as of June 30 was $3.49 billion, the Hanover, New Hampshire-based college said today in a statement. It rose $73 million from a year earlier after investment gains, gifts and distributions to support Dartmouth programs.  Dartmouth and Yale University are leading the Ivy League in endowment returns, which have had the worst performance of any class of institutional investor in the year through June, gaining an average 0.37 percent, according to consulting firm Wilshire Associates. Last month, Yale reported a gain of 4.7 percent. Harvard University, the world’s richest school, had a 0.05 percent loss.  “The portfolio benefited from the strong performance of our U.S. equities strategies, as well as its allocation to private capital strategies, including private equity, venture capital, real estate and natural resources, all of which performed well,” Chief Investment Officer Pamela L. Peedin said in the statement.  In May, New Hampshire’s attorney general received an anonymous letter, purporting to be from Dartmouth alumni, questioning the propriety of some of the school’s investments. In a letter last week, the attorney general’s office said that after a review of the college’s financial statements it found “no basis” to conclude that Dartmouth trustees violated state law in its transactions.  Princeton University and Cornell University have yet to release their results.
