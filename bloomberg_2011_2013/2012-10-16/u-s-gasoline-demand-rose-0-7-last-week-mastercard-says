U.S. gasoline demand rose 0.7
percent last week, according to data from  MasterCard Inc. (MA)   Drivers bought 8.63 million barrels a day of gasoline in
the week ended Oct. 12, up from 8.57 million the prior week,
MasterCard’s SpendingPulse report showed today.  Fuel consumption was 3.9 percent below a year earlier, the
largest decline in six weeks.  Fuel use over the past four weeks fell 2.1 percent below
the same period in 2011. Demand by that measure has been lower
