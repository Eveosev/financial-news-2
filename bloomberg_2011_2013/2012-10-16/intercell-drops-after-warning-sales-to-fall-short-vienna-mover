Intercell AG (ICLL) , an Austrian vaccine
maker, fell after the company warned its only marketable
product, a vaccine against Japanese encephalitis, hadn’t sold as
much as anticipated, leading to a wider loss this year.  Intercell dropped as much as 3.6 percent to 1.852 euros,
the lowest level since Oct. 5, and were down 3.2 percent at
11:30 a.m. The stock, down  89 percent  in the last two years due
to clinical-trial setbacks and disappointing sales of its Ixiaro
vaccine, surpassed its 3-month average trading volume on
Vienna’s stock exchange.  “This is likely to dampen the market, as it will be the
first time Ixiaro’s sales have declined,” Natixis analyst
Beatrice Muzard said in a note to clients today. “Our forecast
of a €19.5m loss now looks to reflect an optimistic scenario.”  Intercell sees sales of its Ixiaro vaccine falling up to a
fifth, to about 28.5 million euros, the company said in a
statement. That decline means its annual net loss will be about
24 million euros compared with a previously forecast loss up to
20 million euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
