Slovak teachers will begin a strike
on Nov. 26 after they failed to agree with the government on a
pay rise,  Sme  reported, citing union leader Pavel Ondek.  The teachers’ union is asking for a 10 percent wage
increase, double the government’s offer, the newspaper said. The
decision follows a one-day strike that took place last month,
Sme said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
