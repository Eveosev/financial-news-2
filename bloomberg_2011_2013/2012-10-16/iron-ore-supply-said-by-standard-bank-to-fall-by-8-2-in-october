Shipments of iron ore will be curbed
by 8.2 percent this month after supplies shrank from from
 Brazil ,  India  and  South Africa ,  Standard Bank  Plc said.  Output losses from a strike ending today at South Africa’s
Sishen mine, the country’s largest, are estimated at 1.6 million
metric tons, Melinda Moore, London-based bulk-commodity sales
executive at the bank, said by e-mail today.  Protesters in Brazil blocked a railroad transporting ore
from the Carajas mine of Vale SA, the world’s biggest producer,
for four days earlier this month, which equated to a loss of 1
million tons of shipments, Moore said.  Mining bans are further curbing 5 million tons of ore from
leaving the Indian state of Goa in October, according to the
bank.  “We estimate that 8.2 percent of seaborne supplies have
been lost from the market in October due to these various
policy-driven and protester incidents,” Moore said in the e-
mail.  The price of the steel-making raw material rebounded 30
percent since plunging to a near-three year low on Sept. 5.  Iron-ore  swaps for November, used to hedge or speculate on
the future price of the steel-making commodity, gained 1.8
percent to $112 per ton, according to Clarkson Securities Ltd.,
a unit of the world’s largest shipbroker. Fourth-quarter
contracts gained 2.5 percent to $112 per ton.  The swaps are settled against the Steel Index Ltd. price
for iron ore with a 62 percent content delivered to the Chinese
port of Tianjin.  To contact the reporter on this story:
