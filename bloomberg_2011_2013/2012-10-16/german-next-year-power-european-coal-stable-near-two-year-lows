German power and European coal for
next year were little changed near their two-year lows. Profits
from coal-fed power plants rose.  Baseload 2013 German power, for supplies delivered around
the clock, rose 0.1 percent as coal for delivery in Amsterdam-
Rotterdam-Antwerp next year declined 0.2 percent, according to
broker data compiled by Bloomberg.  The 2013 power contract, a European benchmark, rose 5 cents
to 47.05 euros ($61.15) a megawatt-hour, broker data show. The
contract fell to 46.90 euros yesterday, the lowest price for a
year-ahead contract since November 2010. The equivalent coal
contract lost 15 cents to $93.20, the least since May 2010.  Power can track fuel and emissions prices, which affect the
cost of production at plants which burn the  fossil fuel .  The German  2013 clean-dark spread , a measure of the profit
utilities get from selling electricity after accounting for the
cost of coal and emissions permits, climbed as much as 2 percent
to 10.92 euros a megawatt-hour, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Day-ahead power added 8.6 percent to 45.35 euros while the
month-ahead contract halted six days of losses, rising 0.6
percent to 47.60 euros, broker data show.  Above-average temperatures are forecast for tomorrow as the
high temperature in  Frankfurt  is predicted at 17 degrees Celsius
(63 Fahrenheit) tomorrow, compared with a five-year average of
15 degrees, according to CustomWeather Inc. data on Bloomberg.
High temperatures will rise to 20 degrees Celsius on Oct. 19 and
to 22 degrees Celsius on Oct. 20.  To contact the reporter on this story:
