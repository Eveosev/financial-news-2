Republican Senator Marco Rubio of  Florida  visited Bloomberg View today, where he displayed the charm, intellect and communication skills that have marked him as a rising star. Despite a wealth of political talent, however, there seemed little Rubio could do to make sense of the  Mitt Romney  campaign's tax plan. Asked which exemptions he personally would eliminate from the tax code in order to accommodate Romney's 20 percent across-the-board  tax cut , Rubio instead spoke of the loopholes he would safeguard. They happen to be big ones: the home mortgage deduction, the charitable-giving deduction and the exclusion for health insurance. The mortgage interest deduction alone  costs  the  U.S. Treasury  almost $100 billion annually. Romney's whole plan is premised on the notion that loopholes would be eliminated in return for the lower tax rates. This, plus a near-magical dollop of economic growth, would lead to balanced budgets. Except there aren't enough loopholes in the  tax code   to compensate for the tax cuts  and there is little reason to suspect growth will rise sky-high on the strength of Romney's hot air. And even Romney says he doesn't want to do away with popular -- and costly --  tax deductions . In response to a question from Wolf Blitzer, Romney stated: A vague commitment to continuing "preferences for those types of expenses" is hardly a commitment to anything at all. But if Romney seems squishy about details, it's not because he doesn't know how to communicate about  numbers . It's that the plan is exceedingly difficult to defend once specifics enter into the conversation. In today's meeting, Rubio was impressive on a broad array of topics, especially immigration. When it came to defending Romney's tax plan, however, he was as lost as Romney. (Francis Wilkinson is a member of the Bloomberg View editorial board.  Follow  him on Twitter.
