Former  Fannie Mae (FNMA)  Chief Financial
Officer J. Timothy Howard was dropped from a shareholders’
securities fraud suit that claimed he hid the company’s
$6.3 billion overstatement of earnings from 2001 to 2004.  U.S. District Judge Richard Leon in Washington ruled today
that the shareholders failed to show Howard was aware of
attempts to conceal information from the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission or that he withheld information from  Fannie
Mae  auditors in an attempt to deceive investors.  “Plaintiffs offer no evidence from which a reasonable
juror could conclude that any of Howard’s statements concerning
Fannie Mae’s accounting practices or internal controls were made
with an intent to deceive, or were otherwise made without any
reasonable basis,” Leon said in his 28-page opinion.  Leon’s ruling comes almost a month after he dismissed
former Fannie Mae Chairman  Franklin Raines , 63, from the case.  The  shareholders  filed suit in 2004 against Howard and
Raines, along with another executive, Leanne G. Spencer, and
Fannie’s auditor,  KPMG . Federal investigators in 2006 accused
Howard and other executives of overstating profit from 2001 to
June 2004 to meet targets and trigger bonuses.  Howard, who spent 22-years working at Washington-based
Fannie Mae, was chief financial officer from 1990 until December
2004. He denied the allegations.  The case is Federal National Mortgage Association
Securities, Derivative and “ERISA” Litigation, 04-cv-01639,
U.S. District Court,  District of Columbia  (Washington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
