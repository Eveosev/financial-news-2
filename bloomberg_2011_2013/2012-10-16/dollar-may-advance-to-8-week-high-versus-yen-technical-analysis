The dollar may rise to an eight-week
high against the yen, according to the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi
UFJ Ltd., citing trading patterns.  The greenback was at 78.81 yen as of 10:34 a.m. in  Tokyo ,
close to the upper end of its daily Bollinger band at 78.86. The
currency also traded near the higher end of its ichimoku-cloud
at 78.90.  “The dollar-yen is struggling with the upper limits of the
Bollinger band and ichimoku cloud at around 79,” said Teppei Ino, an analyst in Tokyo at Mitsubishi UFJ, a unit of  Japan ’s
biggest financial group by market value. “Once the pair climbs
above these levels, it’s likely to proceed to the middle of the
79-80 range.”  The dollar may advance to its 200-day moving average of
79.39, Ino forecast. The currency hasn’t reached that level
since Aug. 21.  Bollinger bands display a  candle chart  of historical prices
and show standard deviation-based ranges around a specified
moving average.  Ichimoku analysis is used to predict a currency’s direction
through analyzing the midpoints of historical highs and lows.
The cloud refers to the area between the first and second
leading span lines on the chart and is used to show an area
where buy orders may be clustered.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns to forecast changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporters on this story:
