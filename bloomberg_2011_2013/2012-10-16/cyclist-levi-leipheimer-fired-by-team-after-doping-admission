Levi Leipheimer was fired by the
Omega Pharma - Quick-Step professional cycling team following
his admission of performance-enhancing drug use tied to the U.S.
Anti-Doping Agency’s investigation of  Lance Armstrong .  “We commend the rider for his open cooperation with USADA
and contribution to cleaning up the sport of cycling,” the team
said on its  website . “However, in the light of the disclosures
made by Mr. Leipheimer in his  public statement  on 10th of
October the team has decided to terminate the contract.”  Leipheimer, 38, was in his first year riding for the team.
He’s participated in the  Tour de France  10 times since turning
professional in 1997, finishing third in 2007, and he also won a
bronze medal at the 2008 Olympics.  “By 1999 I had come to believe that in order to be
successful in professional cycling it was necessary to use
performance-enhancing drugs,” Leipheimer said in an affidavit
provided to USADA, one of several from former teammates of
Armstrong that led the agency to accuse Armstrong of a doping
conspiracy and eventually strip of him of his record seven Tour
de France championships.  Leipheimer stated that he used the banned blood-booster
Erythropoietin, known as EPO, for several years, as well as
testosterone and blood transfusions.  Leipheimer and five other riders were suspended for six
months, retroactive to Sept. 1, for their admissions of drug
use.  To contact the reporter on this story:
