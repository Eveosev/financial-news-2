The  Philadelphia Eagles  fired
defensive coordinator Juan Castillo two days after the team gave
up a 10-point fourth-quarter lead and lost to the Detroit Lions
in overtime.  Castillo, who was converted from offensive line coach to
defensive coordinator last season, will be replaced by secondary
coach Todd Bowles, the 3-3 team said on its website.  “We’re six games into the season and average isn’t good
enough,” Eagles coach  Andy Reid  said. “I know the potential of
our team and insist on maximizing it.”  Castillo joined the Eagles as an offensive assistant in
1995 and was the National Football League team’s offensive line
coach from 1998 to 2010. The team began the 2011 campaign with
1-4 record and was 4-8 before finishing at 8-8 to miss the
playoffs.  Philadelphia led 23-13 at home two days ago with just over
five minutes remaining before falling to Detroit. A week
earlier, the Pittsburgh Steelers beat the Eagles 16-14 after
driving 64 yards in 14 plays to kick the game-winning field
goal.  “I want to make it clear that I have nothing but the
ultimate respect for Juan Castillo as a coach and as a person,”
Reid said. “He’s one of the finest football coaches that I have
ever worked with. He has served this organization extremely well
for 18 years and letting him go was a difficult decision.”  Bowles, 48, is in his 13th season as a NFL assistant and
first with the Eagles after an eight-year career as an NFL
defensive back. He coached the  Miami Dolphins  last season after
 Tony Sparano  was fired.  To contact the reporter on this story:
