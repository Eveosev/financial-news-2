Apple Inc. (AAPL)  sent out invitations for
what it’s calling a “special event” on Oct. 23 in San Jose,
 California .  Apple, the world’s most valuable company, plans to unveil a
smaller version of its iPad tablet at the event, a person with
knowledge of the matter said earlier this month. The event will
be held at 10 a.m. local time at the California Theater.  “We’ve got a little more to show you,” Cupertino,
California-based Apple said in the invitation, sent via e-mail
today.  Apple is introducing the smaller iPad as rivals such as
 Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) ,  Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN)  and  Google Inc. (GOOG)  try to wrest
away a piece of the tablet market, which is projected by NPD
DisplaySearch to more than double to $162 billion by 2017. Apple
controls about 70 percent of the market. The new model will be
Apple’s first expansion of the iPad product line since the
device was introduced by co-founder Steve Jobs in 2010.  The company is unveiling a smaller iPad with a 7.85-inch
screen diagonally, people familiar with its development said in
August. The current  iPad  has a 9.7-inch screen. Apple will
probably price the smaller iPad at $299 or $349, said Shaw Wu,
an analyst at Sterne Agee & Leach Inc.  Microsoft, the world’s largest software maker, today said
its new Surface tablet, which goes on sale Oct. 26, will be
priced starting at $499. Amazon and Google also have announced
new tablets in recent months.  Tablet sales are predicted to exceed those of personal
computers by 2015, according to research firm Yankee Group.  Last month, Apple released the iPhone 5. The company sold 5
million of the smartphones during its debut weekend, though
sales have been held back by supply constraints.  Apple rose 2.4 percent to $649.79 at the close in New York.
The shares have gained 60 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
