Chile’s peso rallied to its highest
level this month as improved German investor sentiment bolstered
the global economic outlook and supported demand for emerging-
market assets.  The peso appreciated 0.3 percent to 470.75 per  U.S. dollar 
at 10:26 a.m. in Santiago. It earlier was stronger than 470 for
the first time since Sept. 27. Chile’s markets were closed
yesterday for a holiday.  “Yesterday was positive for the markets and today is
similar so the peso is following that trend and playing
catchup,” said Eugenio Cortes, head of currency forwards at
EuroAmerica Corredores de Bolsa SA in Santiago.  The 17-nation euro rose above $1.30 for the first time in a
week after a report from the ZEW Center for European Economic
Research in Mannheim showed an index of investor expectations
was higher than analysts’ forecasts in September. Chilean
traders follow the euro as an indicator of the relative strength
or weakness of the dollar.  “The euro is rising strongly, which means there is
appetite to take the dollar weaker, but there is wariness about
being short dollars at these levels,” Cortes said. “In the
event of any negative news, the drop in the peso will be much
sharper than any potential gain from positive news.”  A short position is a bet an asset may decline in value.  To contact the reporter on this story:
