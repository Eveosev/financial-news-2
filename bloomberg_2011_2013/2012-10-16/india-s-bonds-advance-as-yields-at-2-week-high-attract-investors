India ’s 10-year bonds gained for the
first time in five days on speculation yields at the highest
level in two weeks will lure buyers.  Bonds rose on optimism the central bank will resume debt
purchases to boost cash availability in the banking system and
spur growth, according to Srinivasa Raghavan, an executive vice
president at  Dhanlaxmi Bank Ltd. (DHLBK)  Asia’s third-largest  economy 
grew 5.5 percent in the three months through June, government
data show, after expansion of 5.3 percent in the previous
quarter, the least since 2009.  “Investors were buying probably because the yield levels
were attractive,” Mumbai-based Raghavan said. “Possibility of
open market auctions to buy bonds are also there.”  The yield on the benchmark 8.15 percent notes due June 2022
fell two basis points to 8.15 percent in Mumbai, according to
the central bank’s trading system.  Raghavan predicted the central bank will buy as much as 700
billion rupees ($13.2 billion) of notes in the remainder of this
fiscal year ending March.  The Reserve Bank of India has bought 820 billion rupees of
government securities so far this fiscal year.  One-year  interest-rate swaps , or derivative contracts used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, fell one basis
point to 7.62 percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
