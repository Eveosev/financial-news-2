Lithuania’s government approved the
2013 budget draft with a deficit within the European Union limit
of 3 percent of economic output.  Prime Minister Andrius Kubilius’s Cabinet, which may be
ousted after parliamentary elections this month, proposes
cutting the shortfall to 2.5 percent of  gross domestic product 
from this year’s planned 3 percent, his office in Vilnius, the
capital, said in an e-mailed statement today. The bill will now
go to parliament for approval.  Opposition parties lured voters with pledges to boost wages
and trim sales levies to oust Kubilius, whose austerity measures
worsened the Baltic nation’s deepest recession in 2009 and 2010.
Kubilius’s Homeland Union-Christan Democrats is third before
second-round voting in single-mandate districts on Oct. 28.  The draft budget projects revenue, including aid from the
EU and other international bodies, of 28.8 billion litai ($10.9
billion), with spending planned at 29.5 billion litai, leaving a
gap of 697 million litai. GDP will grow 2.5 percent this year
and 3 percent in 2013, the  Finance Ministry  estimates.  The heads of the opposition Labor and Social Democrat
parties, who placed first and second in the first round of
parliamentary elections on Oct. 14 and plan to work together in
a new coalition, said in news conferences yesterday that they
would seek to stimulate the economy without letting the fiscal
deficit exceed the EU limit of 3 percent of GDP.  Separately, the Finance Ministry said today that Lithuania
would need to borrow about 7.6 billion litai on domestic and
international markets next year, including 6.7 billion litai to
repay previous debt. A debt-repayment reserve of 2.1 billion
litai has been built up to reduce refinancing risk, the ministry
said on its website. It projected that government debt at the
end of 2013 would be about 40.5 percent of GDP.  To contact the reporter on this story:
