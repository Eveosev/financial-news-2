The European Bank for Reconstruction
and Development may provide a 47 million-euro ($61 million) loan
to a wind farm project in  Romania , the lender said in a
statement on its website today.  The London-based bank plans to help finance a 40-megawatt
wind park in the southeastern region of Dobrogea, owned by a
local unit of Spain’s Grupo Empresarial Enhol SL, according to
the statement.  The project is expected to start operations by the end of
2013 at a total cost of about 70 million euros.  Its ownership will be transferred later to Spain’s  Gamesa
Corporacion Tecnologica SA (GAM) , according to the EBRD.  To contact the reporter on this story:
