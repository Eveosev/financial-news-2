Egypt  hasn’t exported natural gas to
Jordan or  Spain  since March because local consumption has
increased, Oil Minister Osama Kamal said, according to state-run
al-Ahram newspaper.  The government is planning to tackle fuel subsidies and
will raise prices of higher-grade 95 gasoline, Kamal said in a
speech to the Shura Council yesterday, according to al-Ahram.
The government “has no plan to abolish subsidies for those who
deserve them,” Kamal said, referring to 80-, 90- and 92-grade
gasoline consumers, the newspaper reported. Kamal said he has
submitted a bill that would strengthen penalties against black-
market fuel smugglers, according to al-Ahram.  The Shura Council’s Financial and Economic Committee has
urged the government to reduce spending by cutting subsidies,
al-Ahram said. The plan includes printed coupons for Egyptians
in need of cheaper fuel, butane gas cylinders and petroleum
products. The Cabinet will discuss the committee’s report on
Nov. 11, the Cairo-based newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
