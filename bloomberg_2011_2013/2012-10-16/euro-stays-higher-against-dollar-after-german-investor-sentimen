The euro stayed higher against the
dollar and the yen as a report showed German investor confidence
gained for a second month in October.  Europe â€™s common currency rose 0.4 percent to $1.3001 at
10:05 a.m. London time, and was 0.7 percent firmer against its
Japanese counterpart at 102.55 yen.  The ZEW Center for European Economic Research in Mannheim
said its  index  of investor and analyst expectations, which aims
to predict economic developments six months in advance, climbed
to minus 11.5 from minus 18.2 in September. Economists forecast
an increase to minus 14.9, according to the median of 36
estimates in a Bloomberg News survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
