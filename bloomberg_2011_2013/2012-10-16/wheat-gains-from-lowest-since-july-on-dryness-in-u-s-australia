Wheat rose in Chicago, rebounding
from a three-month low as dry weather in parts of the U.S. and
 Australia  puts crops at risk in the world’s two biggest
exporters of the grain.  Rains missed many parts of the U.S. northern Plains over
the weekend, while Western Australia will remain mostly dry in
the next six days, Telvent DTN Inc. said yesterday. About 36
percent of U.S. winter wheat had emerged by Oct. 14, below the
five-year average of 44 percent, the government said.  “In the northern Plains, significant moisture deficits
persist,”  Luke Mathews , a commodity strategist at  Commonwealth
Bank of Australia , wrote in a report today. “This may create
some concern” for crops going into the winter season, he said.  Wheat for December delivery added 0.9 percent to $8.56 a
bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade by 2:42 p.m. Paris time.
Prices yesterday touched $8.4025, the lowest level since July
12, as U.S. export sales fell.  The  U.S. Department of Agriculture  cut its outlook for
world wheat production and stocks on Oct. 11 on expectations the
harvest will slide in Australia, the second-largest shipper.
Stockpiles will probably drop 13 percent to 173 million metric
tons at the end of this marketing year from a year earlier, the
USDA said.  Milling wheat for November delivery traded on NYSE Liffe in
the French capital gained 0.4 percent to 260 euros ($339) a ton.  Soybeans for delivery in November rose 0.6 percent to
$15.01 a bushel in  Chicago . The oilseed reached the lowest level
since July 3 yesterday on signs of slowing demand for U.S.
supplies and amid speculation that rains in  Brazil  will boost
crops there.  Corn for delivery in December climbed 0.8 percent to $7.43
a bushel, advancing for a first day in three. The grain touched
$7.325 yesterday, the lowest price since Oct. 10, as the U.S.
harvest progressed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
