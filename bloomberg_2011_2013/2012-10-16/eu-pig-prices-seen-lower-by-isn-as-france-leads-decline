European Union pig prices fell this
week on pressure from slaughterhouses, led by a decline in
 France , German industry group Interessengemeinschaft der
Schweinehalter Deutschlands e.V. reported.  French pig prices fell for a second week to 1.834 euros
($2.38) a kilogram (2.2 pounds) from 1.889 euros last week,
Damme, Germany-based ISN wrote in a  report  on its website today.
Pig prices in  Germany  declined to 1.846 euros a kilogram from
1.876 euros last week.  Germany is the EU’s biggest pork producer, followed by
Spain and France, Eurostat data show. The EU has forecast pig-
meat production in the 27-nation bloc will fall 3.2 percent next
year on higher feed costs and new animal welfare rules.  “The timing for a declining market in France is very
unfavorable, because  price  negotiations are now taking place in
the meat trade,” ISN wrote. “At the same time the French see
the situation as transitory, because the cold stores are empty
and a production drop in pig breeding is to be expected.”  Pig-meat prices in the Netherlands,  Belgium  and  Austria 
followed German prices lower, according to ISN. Dutch prices
fell to 1.781 euros a kilogram from 1.81 euros, in Belgium the
price fell to 1.84 euros from 1.865 euros and Danish pork prices
slipped to 1.825 from 1.826 euros, ISN said.  The drop in German prices was “completely unexpected and,
with a view on the live market, completely unjustified,” the
industry group wrote.  Prices in Spain fell to 1.949 euros a kilogram from 1.961
euros last week, as the end of the main summer holiday period
means less demand from tourists, ISN said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
