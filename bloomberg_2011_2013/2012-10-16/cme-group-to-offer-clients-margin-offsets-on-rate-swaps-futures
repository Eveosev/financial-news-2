CME Group Inc. (CME) , the world’s largest
futures exchange, received regulatory approval to reduce the
amount of margin required of its customers to back interest-rate
futures and over-the-counter derivatives that offset each other.  Known as portfolio margining, the reductions will go into
effect Nov. 19, the Chicago-based company said in a statement
today. In March, CME Group began offering the service to the
banks that are members of the exchange. CME Group customers,
such as money managers and  hedge funds , access the exchange
through a bank member such as JPMorgan Chase & Co.  The cost savings come from combining positions in exchange-
traded Eurodollar and Treasury futures with privately negotiated
 interest-rate swaps  to allow long and short positions to cancel
each other out. The lower risk of that entire position leads to
less margin having to be pledged to back the trades.  “Goldman Sachs fully supports CME Group’s effort to
develop the technological infrastructure to make portfolio
margining a reality for our customers,” Michael Dawley, global
co-head of futures and OTC clearing at the New York-based bank,
said in the statement. “Portfolio margining of swaps and
futures will allow our customers to capture material capital
efficiencies through significant margin reductions.”  The benefit may reduce needed capital by as much as 85
percent for some portfolios, CME Group said in a  statement  in
March.  To contact the reporter on this story:
