Zain Saudi (ZAINKSA) , the phone operator whose
quarterly loss widened, expects to sign an agreement to
refinance 9.75 billion riyals ($2.6 billion) of debt in the
fourth quarter after receiving additional time from lenders.  The company is in “very advanced negotiations” with a
syndicate of banks as well as potential investors to refinance
the Islamic murabaha facility,  Zain Saudi said in a statement. 
The facility, which was originally due in July, was extended to
Nov. 28, the second extension by lenders. The company mandated
 Al Rajhi Bank (RJHI) ,  Banque Saudi Fransi (BSFR) ,  Arab National Bank (ARNB)  and
Standard Chartered Plc to refinance the loan, two bankers
familiar with the matter said in May.  The third-quarter loss  widened to 493 million riyals from
484 million riyals a year earlier. That missed the  mean estimate 
of seven analysts for a loss of 354 million riyals, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The shares slumped as much as 8.2
percent to 8.35 riyals before closing at 8.7 riyals in Riyadh.  The loss was due to a re-balancing of traffic volumes from
international to national locations, Zain Saudi said, adding
that it had an  operating loss  of 305 million riyals after 222
million riyals a year earlier.  The stock has tumbled 22 percent this year compared with a
gain of 5.2 percent for the  Tadawul All Share Index. (SASEIDX)  Six
analysts recommend investors hold the shares, while four advise
to sell and one says buy, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
