The Czech Republic may not receive
as much as 500 million euros ($653 million) from European Union
funds this year, the  CTK  newswire reported, citing Shirin
Wheeler, a spokeswoman for the European Commission.  According to the proposal, the country may be able to use
the funds next year, the newswire said. The delay would affect
the state budget this year as the government included the funds
in its fiscal plans, the CTK said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
