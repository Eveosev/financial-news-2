South Korea’s won climbed toward an
almost one-year high and government bonds fell as consumer data
from the U.S. supported demand for riskier assets.  Retail sales increased 1.1 percent in the world’s largest
economy last month, beating the 0.8 percent gain forecast in a
Bloomberg survey, figures showed yesterday. The  Kospi (KOSPI)  index rose
the most in a month even as overseas investors sold more local
shares than they bought for a fourth day. The Bloomberg-JPMorgan
Asia  Dollar Index , which tracks the region’s 10 most-active
currencies outside  Japan , rose to the highest level since March.  “The U.S. data was positive and demand for safer assets
has weakened,” said Han Sung Min, a Seoul-based currency trader
for Busan Bank. “I expect the won’s appreciation trend to
continue.”  The won advanced 0.3 percent to 1,107.19 per dollar at the
close in Seoul, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
currency touched 1,106.13 earlier, the strongest level since
0ct. 31, 2011. One-month implied volatility, a measure of
exchange-rate swings used to price options, slipped 36 basis
points, or 0.36 percentage point, to 5.79 percent.  The yield on the 3.25 percent notes due June 2015 climbed
one basis point to 2.78 percent, Korea Exchange Inc. prices
show. The one-year interest-rate swap rose four basis points to
2.82 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
