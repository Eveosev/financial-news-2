(Corrects description of Moody’s outlook in headline and
first paragraph of a story published Oct. 16.)  Moody’s Investors Service expanded
its negative outlook for  Citigroup Inc. (C)  to subsidiaries that the
ratings company had previously deemed stable, citing the
resignations today of Chief Executive Officer  Vikram Pandit  and
Chief Operating Officer John P. Havens.  “The negative outlook reflects the risk that this
unexpected management change will negatively affect Citigroup’s
ongoing efforts to install improved risk-management practices
throughout the firm,” the ratings firm said in a statement on
the New York-based lender.  To contact the reporter on this story:
