IK Investment Partners, a European
buyout firm, hired four banks to provide less than 100 million
euros ($130 million) of loans for its buyout of  Vemedia Pharma
NV, (VEPVP)  according to two people with knowledge of the matter.  Belfius Bank NV, Deutsche Bank AG,  Fortis Bank SA/NV (FBAVP) , and
ING Groep NV provided the financing for the acquisition that
values Kortrijk, Belgium-based Vemedia Pharma at about 138
million euros, said the people, who asked not to be identified
because the deal is private.  IK Investment said yesterday it agreed to buy a majority
stake in the supplier of over-the-counter medicines and will
make a cash offer for the remaining securities it doesnâ€™t own at
2.80 euros per share.  Charlotte Laveson, a spokeswoman in London for IK
Investment, declined to comment on the debt financing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
