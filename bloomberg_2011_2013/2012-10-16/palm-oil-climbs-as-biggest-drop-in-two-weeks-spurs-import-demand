Palm oil  fell on concern that
inventories in  Malaysia , the second-largest producer, will
expand as a global economic slowdown weakens demand for the
vegetable oil used in food and biofuels.  The contract for January delivery, which has the largest
volume and open interest, closed 0.2 percent lower at 2,466
ringgit ($808) a metric ton on the Malaysia Derivatives
Exchange. The most-active contract has declined 23 percent this
year, touching a three-year low of 2,230 ringgit on Oct. 3.  Futures may decline to 2,200 ringgit, the lowest level
since November 2009, in the next four to six weeks as crude oil
drops amid a global slowdown,  Dorab Mistry , director of Godrej
International Ltd., said in  Kuala Lumpur  today. Inventories in
Malaysia will reach or exceed a record 3 million tons on Jan. 1,
he said.  Rising production and record stockpiles will limit any
rally in prices, Vijay Mehta, a director at Commodity Links Pte,
said by phone from  Singapore . “Demand is fairly good around
these levels.”  Palm-oil stockpiles in Malaysia may peak in December and
drop after that following the government tax changes and as
biofuel demand emerges, according to James Fry, chairman of LMC
International Ltd. Reserves in Malaysia increased to a record
2.48 million tons last month, according to data from the
Malaysian Palm Oil Board.  Malaysia will cut the export duty on crude palm oil and
abolish a duty-free shipment quota from 2013, Plantation
Industries and Commodities Minister Bernard Dompok said on Oct.
12. The new rates will range from 4.5 percent to 8.5 percent.
The existing levy is 23 percent.  Soybean oil  for December delivery advanced 0.7 percent to
50.34 cents a pound on the Chicago Board of Trade. Soybeans for
November delivery climbed 0.5 percent to $14.995 a bushel.  Palm oil for January delivery on the Dalian Commodity
Exchange rose 1.2 percent to close at 6,926  yuan  ($1,106) a ton.
Soybean oil for delivery in the same month increased 1.5 percent
to end at 9,138 yuan a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
