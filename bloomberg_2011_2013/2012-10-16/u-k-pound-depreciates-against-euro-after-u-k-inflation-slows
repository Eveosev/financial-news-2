The pound fell to a one-month low
versus the euro after data showed U.K. inflation slowed to the
least in almost three years last month, boosting speculation the
Bank of England will add more stimulus to the economy.  Ten-year  gilt yields  climbed to the highest level in three
weeks after two senior German coalition lawmakers said the
nation is open to Spain seeking a precautionary credit line from
 Europe ’s rescue fund, curbing demand for the safest government
assets. U.K. consumer prices rose 2.2 percent from a year
earlier, down from a 2.5 percent increase in August, a report
showed today. Minutes of the Bank of England’s Monetary Policy
Committee’s October meeting will be published tomorrow.  “Inflation is on track to fall under 2 percent and so
there’s not much for the Bank of England to do other than to add
stimulus,” said Peter Frank, a foreign-exchange strategist at
 Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA (BBVA)  in London. “There’s plenty
of room for the Bank of England to do more.”  The pound depreciated 0.4 percent to 80.91 pence per euro
as of 5:24 p.m.  London  time, after reaching 81.03 pence, the
weakest level since Sept. 17. Sterling strengthened 0.3 percent
to $1.6116, after reaching $1.6133, the highest since Oct. 8.  September’s consumer price reading was the lowest since
November 2009, the Office for National Statistics said in London
and matched the median forecast of 37 economists in a Bloomberg
News survey.  Bond Purchases  The central bank’s current round of bond purchases finishes
next month and officials will decide at their Nov. 7-8 meeting
whether to increase the target from 375 billion pounds.  Britain’s economy will shrink 0.3 percent this year,
according to a Bloomberg survey of economists’ forecasts. That
compares with 2.1 percent growth in the U.S. and a 0.5 percent
decline in the euro-region. Third-quarter U.K. gross domestic
product data is due to be released on Oct. 25.  Investors should sell the pound against the dollar before
the growth data next week, Nordea Bank AB analysts led by Jonas Thulin in  Stockholm  wrote in an e-mailed report today. The
strategists recommend selling sterling at $1.6056, targeting a
1.7 percent drop to $1.5788. The trade should be exited should
the pound advance to $1.6177, they wrote.  The pound has weakened 0.7 percent in the past three
months, according to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes,
which track 10 developed-market currencies. The euro gained 2.7
percent and the dollar dropped 4 percent.  Gilts Fall  U.K. government bonds fell after the report on Spain
boosted speculation the nation may seek a sovereign bailout and
curbed demand for the safest assets.  U.K. 10-year gilt yields climbed six basis points, or 0.06
percentage point, to 1.82 percent. They reached 1.83 percent,
the highest since Sept. 25. The 1.75 percent security, maturing
in September 2022, fell 0.55, or 5.50 pounds per 1,000-pound
face amount, to 99.365.  The views of German lawmakers are critical because they
would have to ratify any aid request under parliamentary rules.
Spain has cited concern of German rejection for its reluctance
so far to seek bailout funds, a condition for triggering
European Central Bank help to lower borrowing costs.  Gilts returned 3 percent this year through yesterday,
according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. German bonds gained
3.2 percent and U.S. Treasuries earned 2.2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
