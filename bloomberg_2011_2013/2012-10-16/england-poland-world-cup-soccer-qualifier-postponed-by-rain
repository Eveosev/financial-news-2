England â€™s World Cup soccer
qualifying match against Poland in Warsaw was postponed by rain.  Heavy showers left standing water across the field at the
National Stadium, which has a retractable roof that was open.  The field was inspected at the scheduled kickoff time of 8
p.m. U.K. time and again 45 minutes later before the match was
postponed.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
