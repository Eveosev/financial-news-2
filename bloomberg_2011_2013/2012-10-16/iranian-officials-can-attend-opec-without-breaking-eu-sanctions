Iranian government officials, such
as Oil Minister Rostam Qasemi, can attend OPEC meetings without
breaking European Union sanctions that restrict the movement of
some senior individuals, according to a senior EU official, who
declined to be identified citing policy rules.  The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries held a
ministerial meeting in June in Vienna and will hold another in
the Austrian capital on Dec. 12.  To contact the reporter on this story:
