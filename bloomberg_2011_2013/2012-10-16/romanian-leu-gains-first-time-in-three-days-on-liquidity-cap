Romania ’s leu strengthened for the
first time in three days after the central bank limited
liquidity in the market and risk appetite improved amid
speculation Spain is moving toward a bailout.  The currency gained 0.15 percent before trading little
changed at 4.5766 per euro at 5:55 p.m. in Bucharest, after
losing 0.2 percent in the past three days, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Yields on 2018 euro-denominated bonds
increased increased one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point to
4.078 percent.  Romania’s central bank limited its lending at the one-week
repurchase agreements auction to 6 billion lei yesterday, to
support the leu as commercial banks’ demand increased to a
record high of 21.4 billion lei. The currency had traded to a
two-month low before the bank capped funding on Oct. 8.  “The central bank provides indirect support to the leu by
limiting the supply of local currency, thus sacrificing interest
rates,” analysts, including Catalina Molnar at UniCredit Tiriac
Bank SA, wrote in their notes today.  The euro rose above $1.30 for the first time in a week as
German investor sentiment improved more than economists
predicted and amid speculation that Spain is moving toward
seeking financial assistance.  The leu exchange rate is “where it should be” and it
reflects the country’s reality, Bogdan Olteanu, the central
bank’s deputy governor, said in an interview with Ziarul
Financiar newspaper today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
