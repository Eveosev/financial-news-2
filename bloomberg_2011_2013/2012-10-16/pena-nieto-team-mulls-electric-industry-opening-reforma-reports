President-elect Enrique Pena Nieto’s
transition team is analyzing ways to open  Mexico ’s electric
industry and allow private firms to compete with state power
company Comision Federal de Electricidad in generation and
distribution, newspaper Reforma reported today.  The Center of Investigation for Development performed an
analysis at the request of Pena Nieto’s team and submitted it
last week, according to the Mexico City-based newspaper. The
initiative could be part of Pena Nieto’s energy overhaul
proposal, the newspaper said, citing Rafael Ch, an analyst at
the institute.  To contact the reporter on this story:
