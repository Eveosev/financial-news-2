Billionaire Vladimir Evtushenkov’s
AFK Sistema may challenge Russian Rail over its decision to sell
25 percent of OAO Freight One to a rival, Interfax reported,
citing Sistema President Mikhail Shamolin.  The state-owned OAO Russian Railways said today it selected
billionaire  Vladimir Lisin ’s UCL Holding to buy its remaining 25
percent of OAO Freight One,  Russia ’s largest rail operator, with
a bid of 50 billion rubles ($1.6 billion). UCL bought 75 percent
of Freight One last year for 125.5 billion rubles.  Sistema is considering either a challenge filed with the
rail regulator or legal action, Interfax cited Shamolin as
saying. Company spokeswoman Yuliya Belous couldn’t immediately
be reached by phone.  To contact the reporters on this story:
