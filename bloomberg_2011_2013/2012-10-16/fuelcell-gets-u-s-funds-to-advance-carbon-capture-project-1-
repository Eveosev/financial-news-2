FuelCell Energy Inc. (FCEL) , the Danbury,
Connecticut-based maker of fuel-cell power plants, qualified for
$800,000 in U.S. government funding to develop systems that
capture carbon-dioxide emissions at coal-fired generators.  The funding is the second phase of a $3 million award from
the U.S. Energy Department announced in October 2011, FuelCell
said in a statement today. FuelCell is one of 16 companies that
will share as much as $41.3 million in Energy Department funding
over three years to develop carbon-capture technology.  About 42 percent of the electricity  generated  in the U.S.
last year came from burning coal, the largest source of  carbon
emissions  that contribute to  climate change , according to the
Energy Department’s Energy Information Administration.  “This award enables us to further advance and refine our
research,” FuelCell Chief Executive Officer Arthur Bottone said
in the statement.  FuelCell fell 5.2 percent to 95 cents at the close in  New
York .  The company’s direct fuel-cell stack separates and
concentrates CO2 during power generation, according to the
statement. The Energy Department is providing funding to
companies developing post-combustion capture technologies, which
use membranes, solvents or gas-absorbing sorbents to remove CO2
from smokestacks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
