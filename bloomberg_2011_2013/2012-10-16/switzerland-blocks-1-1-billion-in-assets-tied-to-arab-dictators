Switzerland is blocking about 1
billion Swiss francs ($1.1 billion) of illegal assets tied to
the former leaderships of four countries at the center of the
Arab Spring unrest.  The Swiss are cooperating with authorities in  Egypt  and
Tunisia to speed the return of the funds, the Federal Department
of  Foreign Affairs  said in an e-mail from Bern today.  “Politically exposed persons, such as head of states and
high public officials, who illegally enrich themselves through
state funds, deprive their state of capital and hinder the
development of their country,” according to the statement.  Switzerland is talking to Egypt about 700 million francs
that was hidden by former President  Hosni Mubarak  and his aides,
the ministry said.  The Swiss government has also seized money tied to Syria,
where rebels are fighting to overthrow President Bashar al- Assad, and to Libya’s Muammar Qaddafi.  To contact the reporter on this story:
