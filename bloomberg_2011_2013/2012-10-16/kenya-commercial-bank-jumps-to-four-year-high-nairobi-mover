Kenya Commercial Bank Ltd. (KNCB) , the
biggest lender by assets and outlets in the East African nation,
jumped to the highest in more than four years as investors were
attracted by a lower price-to-earnings ratio than its peers.  The stock of KCB, as the lender is known, rose 0.9 percent
to 28.25 shillings by the close in the capital, Nairobi, the
highest level since August 2008.  “For the price earnings ratio, it still has more value
compared to its peers,” Faith Atiti, an analyst at Nairobi-
based NIC Securities Ltd., said in a phone interview today.  Among  Kenya ’s four biggest lenders by market value, KCB has
the lowest price to earnings ratio at 7.59, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Equity Bank Ltd., (EQBNK)  the biggest lender, has
a ratio of 7.92,  Barclays Bank of Kenya’s  is 9.52 and  Standard
Chartered Bank Ltd. (SCBL) ’s is the highest at 10.98.  “We have seen a lot of appetite for the stock from foreign
investors, because the price looks attractive on a price to
earnings ratio,” Francis Mwangi, head of research at Nairobi-
based Standard Investment Bank Ltd. said in a phone interview.  The average price to earnings ratio for Kenya’s banking
industry is 8.2, based on earnings in the 12 months through to
December 2011, Mwangi said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
