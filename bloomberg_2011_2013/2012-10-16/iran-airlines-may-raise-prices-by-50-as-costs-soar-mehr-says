Iranian airlines may raise the price
of flights by as much as 50 percent by next month, a move backed
by parliament as the national currency declines, the  Mehr  news
agency reported.  “Domestic airlines must either be given access by the
government to foreign currency at the official  exchange rate  or
increase their prices,” said Mehrdad Lahouti, the spokesman for
the parliament’s development commission, according to the state-
run news agency. Airlines “have high costs that must be met,”
Lahouti said, citing their need for imported parts.  Iran ’s economy is suffering as a result of financial, trade
and energy sanctions imposed by the U.S. and the European Union
to discourage the country’s nuclear program. Iran’s rial has
slumped as much as 40 percent against the dollar since August,
leading to spiraling inflation.  The government has shielded some importers of essential
goods including medicines and grains from the currency’s decline
by granting them access to dollars at the central bank rate of
12,260 rials, while ordinary Iranians pay almost three times as
much on the unofficial market.  The head of the  Association of Iranian Airlines , Abdolreza
Mousavi, announced last month that domestic airlines would no
longer benefit from dollars at the cheaper rate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
