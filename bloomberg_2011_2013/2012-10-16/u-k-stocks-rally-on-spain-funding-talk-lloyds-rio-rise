U.K.  stocks  rallied the most in two
week, led by banks and mining companies, as two German lawmakers
said the country is open to Spain’s seeking a credit line and
U.S. industrial production topped economist forecasts.  Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY)  and  Royal Bank of Scotland Group
Plc (RBS)  led a  gauge of British lenders  to the highest in more than a
year. Rio Tinto Group rose 2.9 percent after reporting an
increase in iron-ore output and as base metals climbed in
 London .  Bellway (BWY)  Plc surged to the highest since 2007 after
posting a 58 percent jump in annual profit.  The  FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  advanced 64.93 points, or 1.1 percent,
to 5,870.54 at the close in London, the biggest gain since Oct.
1. The gauge has rallied 5.4 percent this year as European
Central Bank policy makers approved an unlimited bond-buying
program and the Federal Reserve started a third round of asset
purchases. The broader FTSE All-Share Index increased 1.1
percent today and Ireland’s ISEQ Index climbed 0.8 percent.  “Shares traded higher today on hopes that Spain are close
to requesting a bailout,” said James Hughes, chief market
analyst at Alpari U.K. Ltd. in London. “There were some reports
that suggest it may come as early as next week. With the
European Union summit on Thursday and Friday that now looks
increasingly unlikely.”  Bank stocks rallied in  Europe  after two German lawmakers
said  Germany  is open to Spain seeking a precautionary credit
line from the euro-area rescue fund, signaling a reversal of
German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble’s public position.  German Comments  The comments by Michael Meister, a deputy caucus leader of
 Chancellor Angela Merkel ’s Christian Democratic bloc, and
Norbert Barthle, her party’s budget spokesman, indicate a
rolling back of German resistance to a full sovereign bailout
for Spain. Schaeuble cautioned Spain against seeking aid on top
of its bank bailout as recently as last month.  Spain is prepared to seek financial aid from the euro area
and is waiting for a decision on how the request would affect
 Italy , the Financial Times reported, citing a senior official in
Spain’s economy ministry it didn’t name. EU leaders convene for
a summit in Brussels on Oct. 18-19.  An  index of U.K. banks  gained 2.5 percent to the highest
level since July 2011. Lloyds rallied 6.1 percent to 42.76
pence, RBS advanced 4.4 percent to 280 pence and  Barclays Plc (BARC) 
increased 3.9 percent to 246.1 pence.  U.S. Economy  Stocks extended gains after data from the Fed showed U.S.
industrial production climbed 0.4 percent in September, paring
some of August’s 1.4 percent slump. That beat the median
economist estimate for a 0.2 percent increase.  A  gauge of mining companies  increased 1.7 percent as copper
rebounded from a one-month low. Lead and tin also advanced on
the London Metal Exchange.  Rio Tinto gained 2.9 percent to 3,061 pence. The company
reported a 6 percent increase in third-quarter iron-ore output
to 52.6 million metric tons, beating the mean analyst estimate
of 50.65 million tons. Iron-ore output from Australia’s Pilbara
region rose to a quarterly record.  Petropavlovsk Plc (POG)  rallied 3.1 percent to 440 pence after
the miner of gold in Russia reported a 39 percent gain in third-
quarter gold production to 219,400 an ounce.  Kazakhmys Plc (KAZ)  rose 2.8 percent to 709 pence,  Vedanta
Resources Plc (VED)  increased 2.5 percent to 1,099 pence,  Antofagasta
Plc (ANTO)  added 1.8 percent to 1,279 pence.  Bellway gained 3.2 percent to 980 pence, the highest since
November 2007. The homebuilder reported a 58 percent increase in
annual net income to 79.3 million pounds ($128 million) after
selling more properties at higher prices. The company is also
planning to raise its dividend by 59 percent.  GKN Sinks  GKN Plc (GKN)  fell 3.4 percent to 204.8 pence after the the maker
of car drive shafts warned that weakening demand in some
European automotive and industrial markets will affect fourth-
quarter profit.  “Macroeconomic conditions have deteriorated in recent
weeks and some softening in order books is now evident,” GKN
said today. “The fourth quarter is anticipated to show the
usual seasonal improvement, although the softening markets are
expected to have some impact.”  Third-quarter pretax profit of 99 million pounds was little
changed from a year-earlier result that was adjusted for a one-
time charge. Sales rose 8.4 percent to 1.6 billion pounds.  Bodycote Plc rallied 4.1 percent to 359.4 pence after
saying trading between July 1 and Sept 30 was in line with
expectations. The shares slumped 15 percent last week after
peers Cookson Group Plc and Morgan Crucible Co. both said their
full-year performance will fall short of targets.  Record Plc (REC)  surged 30 percent to 24.5 pence, the largest
jump since April 20. The currency manager said its assets under
management increased almost 9 percent in the third quarter,
boosted by new clients.  To contact the reporter on this story:
