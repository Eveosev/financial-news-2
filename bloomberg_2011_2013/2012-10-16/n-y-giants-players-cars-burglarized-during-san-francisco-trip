Vehicles belonging to members of the
 New York Giants  were burglarized and one was stolen while the
team was on a winning road trip in  San Francisco .  Five cars, which are believed to be owned by Giants’
players, were broken into around 4 a.m. two days ago in a gated
parking lot at the team’s training center in East Rutherford,
New Jersey, state police spokesman Brian Polite said in a
telephone interview. The stolen car, a 1996 Chevy Caprice,
belongs to defensive tackle Marvin Austin, NBCNewYork.com said,
citing a law enforcement official.  The lot had video camera surveillance, a lock on the gate
was broken and some of the burglarized cars were unlocked,
Polite said.  “It’s an active investigation at this point,” Polite
said. “We’re following up on all our leads.”  The break-ins took place several hours before the Giants
beat the  San Francisco 49ers  26-3 to raise their National
Football Conference East Division-leading record to 4-2.  “Only in Jersey can someone be heartless enough to break
into my car while we are in Cali making fans proud..geez get
your life right in 2012,” Giants offensive tackle James Brewer
said in a Twitter post the day of the game.  Pat Hanlon, a spokesman for the Giants, declined to comment
on the burglaries in an e-mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
