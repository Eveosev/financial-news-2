Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) , the world’s
biggest maker of health-care products, beat analysts’ earnings
estimates in the third quarter on demand for new prescription
medicines and medical tools acquired with the Synthes Inc.
purchase. The company raised its 2012 forecast.  Net income  decreased to $3 billion, or $1.05 a share, from
$3.2 billion, or $1.15, a year earlier, New Brunswick, New
Jersey-based J&J said today in a statement. Earnings excluding
one-time items were $1.25 a share, topping the $1.22 average of
18 analyst  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  Sales of recently approved drugs, including Zytiga for
prostate cancer, Xarelto for stroke prevention and Stelara for
psoriasis helped push  revenue  6.5 percent to $17.1 billion for
the quarter, from $16 billion a year earlier. The June purchase
of Synthes with novel financing that used cash that had
accumulated outside the U.S. also bolstered quarterly earnings.  “We’re in the early stages of the turnaround,” said Jeff Jonas, an analyst at Gabelli & Co. in Rye, New York. “Clearly
the pharmaceutical business is booming, as they’ve introduced
several new drugs. Medical devices are growing steadily but
slowly. The consumer business, hopefully that will turn next
year.”  The company raised its 2012 earnings forecast to $5.05 to
$5.10 a share excluding certain items, after trimming the 
forecast  last quarter by 5 cents to $5 to $5.07 a share.
Analysts  estimated  J&J would generate $5.08 a share this year.  J&J  rose  1.4 percent to $69.55 at 4:01 p.m. New York time.
The shares gained 6.1 percent this year.  Bapineuzumab Charge  The company took a charge of $553 million in the quarter
for the discontinuation of the experimental Alzheimer’s disease
drug bapineuzumab, integration costs from the Synthes
acquisition and costs related to the DePuy ASR hip.  Sales included the impact of the Synthes acquisition, which
contributed 5.8 percent to worldwide operational sales growth,
net of the divestiture of the DePuy trauma business, the company
said in the statement.  Sales of consumer goods and over-the-counter products like
Tylenol and Motrin from the company’s McNeil unit, which haven’t
all returned to the market after manufacturing problems, fell
4.3 percent to $3.6 billion. Chief Executive Officer  Alex Gorsky 
named Sandra Peterson to head the division in September, marking
his first major hire. Peterson, who was chief of  Bayer AG (BAYN) ’s
crop-chemical unit, is slated to start at J&J on Dec. 1.  Pharmaceutical sales rose 7 percent to $6.4 billion. J&J’s
biggest unit, the medical-device division, had a revenue
increase of 13 percent to $7.1 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
