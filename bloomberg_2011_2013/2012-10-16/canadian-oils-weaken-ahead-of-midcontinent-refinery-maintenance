Canadian grades weakened as U.S.
Midcontinent refiners prepared to shut units for seasonal
maintenance that may cut demand for the oils.  HollyFrontier Corp. (HFC)  will shut the  West plant  at its Tulsa,
Oklahoma, refinery starting in November for maintenance, a
person with knowledge of the plans said June 28. The work will
begin Nov. 1 and end in the first week in December, said the
person. Julia Heidenreich, a Dallas-based spokeswoman for the
company, said Oct. 5 that maintenance was scheduled to begin
soon without disclosing further information.  Western  Canada  Select’s discount to West Texas Intermediate
widened $1.50 to at $17 a barrel at 10:27 a.m. in New York,
according to  Net Energy Inc ., which says it’s Canada’s largest
independent financial and physical oil brokerage. Cold Lake’s
discount widened $1.45 a barrel to $18.25.  Syncrude’s premium weakened 50 cents to $3.75 a barrel, the
Calgary-based broker said. Bakken oil’s premium narrowed 50
cents to $1.50 a barrel.  Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium narrowed 10 cents to $21.70
a barrel over WTI, according to data compiled by Bloomberg at
1:48 p.m. in New York. Heavy Louisiana Sweet decreased 10 cents
to a premium of $21.20 a barrel.  Poseidon’s premium narrowed 25 cents to $14. Mars Blend
fell 5 cents to $15.50 a barrel over WTI, and Southern Green
Canyon decreased 5 cents to $13.60 over the benchmark.  The premium for Thunder Horse, a sour crude with lower
sulfur content than Mars, Poseidon and Southern Green Canyon,
dropped 15 cents to $19.60 above WTI.  To contact the reporter on this story:
