Cocoa futures rose the most in a
week after European bean-processing, an indicator of demand,
fell less than expected. Sugar rose.  European cocoa-bean processing fell 16 percent year-on-year
to 316,676 metric tons in the third quarter, the European Cocoa
Association, a Brussels-based industry group, said in an e-
mailed report today. That compares with prior expectations for a
decline of 20 percent. In the U.S., bean processing may drop 8.3
percent, the average of 10 analysts in a Bloomberg survey
published on Oct. 12 showed. The Washington-based  National
Confectioners Association  will release the figures on Oct. 18.  “The entire market has been anxiously waiting for the
publication of the ECA grind data,” Eric Sivry, head of
agriculture options brokerage at Marex Spectron, said in a
report e-mailed yesterday.  Cocoa for March delivery was up 0.8 percent at 1,535 pounds
($2,470) a ton on NYSE Liffe in  London  by 11:37 a.m. The
increase is the most since Oct. 9. Cocoa for December delivery
rose 1.1 percent to $2,380 a ton on ICE Futures U.S. in  New
York .  “Let’s bear in mind that the base for the calculation, the
third-quarter 2011 in Europe, was the highest processing quarter
ever,” Sivry said. Bean processing in  Europe  in the three
months ended Sept. 30, 2011, was a record 378,042 tons,
according to the ECA report.  White, or refined, sugar for March delivery rose 1 percent
to $548.40 a ton on NYSE Liffe. Raw sugar for March delivery
advanced 1.4 percent to 20.12 cents a pound on ICE.  Robusta coffee for January delivery was unchanged at $2,064
a ton in London. Arabica coffee for December delivery rose 1.2
percent to $1.6285 a pound in New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
