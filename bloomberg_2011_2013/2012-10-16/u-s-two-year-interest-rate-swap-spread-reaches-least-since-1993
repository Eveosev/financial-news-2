A measure of stress in U.S. credit
markets reached the lowest level in 19 years.  The U.S. two-year interest-rate swap spread narrowed 1.62
basis points to 9.13 basis points, as of 12:23 p.m. in New York,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Thatâ€™s the lowest level on an intra-day basis since Sept.
28, 1993, for the measure, which falls when investors favor
assets such as corporate bonds and rises when they seek the
perceived safety of government securities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
