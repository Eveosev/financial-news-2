Intercell AG (ICLL)  cut its forecast for
full-year sales and earnings by as much as 20 percent, citing
lower-than-expected demand for its Ixiaro vaccine against
Japanese Encephalitis.  The net loss will be between 20 million euros ($26 million)
and 24 million euros this year, the Vienna-based company said in
statement today. Product sales will be between 26.5 million and
28.5 million euros, according to Intercell.  The company is scheduled to report third-quarter results on
November 7.  To contact the reporter on this story:
