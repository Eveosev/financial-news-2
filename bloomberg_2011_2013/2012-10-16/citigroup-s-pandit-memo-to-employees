(The following document was confirmed by  Shannon Bell , a Citigroup spokeswoman 
and received via e-mail.)   Dear Colleagues:  After five extraordinary years, I have decided to step down as CEO of Citi. It 
has been a privilege and an honor to serve Citi since December 7, 2007. – Only 
you can understand the effort and hard work that was put in to get our company 
where it is today.  There is nothing better than our third quarter earnings announcement to 
demonstrate definitively that we have turned this company around. Yesterday’s 
results show this clearly.  More importantly, I couldn’t be more optimistic about the bank’s future. Our 
formula has served the company well for 200 years. By going back to the basics 
of banking to serve the real economy, putting clients at the center of 
everything we do, and embracing the principles of Responsible Finance, we have 
put Citi in a great position for continued success.   I am proud of each and every one of you and I have the utmost confidence in 
your future success.  – Vikram  (bjh) NY
