Jordan will hold parliamentary
elections on Jan. 23, the official  Petra News Agency  reported,
citing the Independent Elections Commission.  Jordan’s King Abdullah II dissolved the lower house of
parliament on Oct. 4 and ordered new elections. The dissolution
meant the government of Prime Minister Fayez al-Tarawneh, sworn
into office in May, had to hand in its resignation within a
week, according to constitutional amendments that were
introduced this year.  Almost two million voters have registered for the
elections, Petra reported on Oct. 4, citing Hussein Bani Hani, a
spokesman for the elections commission. There are about 3
million eligible voters in the kingdom, it says.  Jordan’s Muslim Brotherhood, which makes up the bulk of the
opposition, has said it plans to boycott the elections. The
group’s deputy leader, Zaki Bani Rsheid, said in July that the
new elections law is undemocratic and doesn’t represent the will
of the public.  The law allocates only 27 seats of the chamber’s 150 seats
to proportional representation, which falls short of the 50
percent sought by the opposition. Jordan’s opposition is made up
largely of Islamist groups that oppose the country’s peace
treaty with  Israel .  To contact the reporter on this story:
