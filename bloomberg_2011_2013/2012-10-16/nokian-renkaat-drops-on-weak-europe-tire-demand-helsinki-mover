Nokian Renkaat Oyj (NRE1V) , the Nordic
region’s largest tire maker, fell the most in more than two
months after it said second-half operating profit will decline
on weak demand and lower prices in  Europe .  Nokian Renkaat, also known as Nokian Tyres,  plummeted  as
much as 12 percent, the biggest intraday drop since Aug. 5, to
29.94 euros and was down 11 percent as of 3:08 p.m. in Helsinki
trading.  Michelin & Cie (ML) , Europe’s biggest tiremaker, fell as
much as 5.2 percent, while  Continental AG (CON) , the region’s No. 2
tiremaker, dropped as much as 4.8 percent.  “Due to central European lower prices and clearly weakened
demand, Nokian Tyres’ operating profit in the third quarter and
in the second half will be weaker than in 2011,” the Nokia,
Finland-based company said today in a statement.  European replacement tire sales, which account for about 75
percent of the tire industry’s revenue, will fall around 5.9
percent this year before rising 6 percent in 2013, Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. said Sept. 12. The region’s car sales plunged 11
percent in September, the biggest drop since October 2010, the
European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association said today.  Nokian Renkaat’s third-quarter operating profit was about
85 million euros ($111 million) and revenue reached 365 million
euros, the Finnish company said today. The figures missed
analyst estimates for earnings before interest and taxes of 105
million euros and revenue of 382 million euros.  The company maintained its forecast that 2012 sales and
operating profit will be higher than last year. Nokian Renkaat
is scheduled to publish its full third-quarter earnings report
on Oct. 30.  Trading volume on the Nokian Renkaat stock rose to 2.26
million shares today, more than four times the three-month
average.  To contact the reporter on this story:
