San Bernardino, the second-largest
U.S. city to enter Chapter 9 bankruptcy, failed to make a $1
million payment due Oct. 1 on pension bonds, according to a
Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board filing dated today.  The missed payment is for a 2005 taxable issue, according
to the regulatory filing by Wells Fargo Bank, trustee for the
debt.  The city of 209,000, about 60 miles (100 kilometers) east
of  Los Angeles , voted in July to skip payments of $3.4 million
to bondholders of its pension debt and $2.2 million for retiree
health care before it sought  bankruptcy protection  on Aug. 1.  “An installment of interest in the amount of $1,014,447
was due from the city on Oct. 1, 2012,” the bank said. “The
city did not transfer any funds to the trustee for payment of
the interest.”  San Bernardino, the third California municipality to enter
bankruptcy since June, has about $90 million of outstanding bond
debts, according to budget documents, and another $200 million
owed to holders of securities issued by the city’s now-dissolved
redevelopment agency. The largest U.S. city in bankruptcy is
Stockton, California.  The case is In re San Bernardino, 12-28006,  U.S. Bankruptcy
Court , Central District of California (Riverside).  To contact the reporter on this story:
