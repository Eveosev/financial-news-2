Immofinanz AG (IIA)  Chief Executive
Officer Eduard Zehetner said eastern Europe’s biggest publicly
traded real estate company is looking at potential projects in
Moscow.  “We see growth, rather big growth, on the residential
side, especially in the greater Moscow area, so we are currently
investigating some new projects there,” Zehetner said at a CIRA
conference in Vienna today.  Immofinanz’s Moscow projects include the GoodZone and the
Golden Babylon mall.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
