U.S. crop prices may rebound from
recent lows as demand outpaces available supplies, said Mike O’Dea, a risk management consultant at INTL FCStone Inc.  U.S. farmers may harvest about 84.8 million acres of corn,
less than the Department of Agriculture’s estimate of 87.7
million acres, as drought ruined fields and spurred more crop
abandonment, O’Dea said in an interview in  London  today. Corn
prices have declined 12 percent on the Chicago Board of Trade
since drought concerns drove them to a record $8.49 a bushel on
Aug. 10. Prices may recover while remaining below record levels,
O’Dea said.  Soybeans have dropped 16 percent since reaching a record
$17.89 a bushel on Sept. 4, as the outlook for U.S. production
improved while the U.S. government estimated that farmers in
Brazil and  Argentina  will harvest record crops in the upcoming
season. “Logistical issues” may still limit  South America ’s
ability to boost exports while it’s too early in the region’s
production season to rule out weather risks, O’Dea said.  “Bean prices at these levels are too low because they’re
encouraging more demand,” said  Kansas City , Missouri-based
O’Dea, who spoke today at the U.K. Agriculture and Horticulture
Development Board’s grain outlook conference in London. “Bean
prices will rally over time. I don’t know if we’ll make new
highs, but if you get a sniff of bad weather in South America
these things will explode to the upside.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
