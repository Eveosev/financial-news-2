He wasn't named  Mitt Romney 's running mate, but that hasn't slowed  down Republican Senator Marco Rubio of Florida. He’s turned into one of Romney’s leading surrogates -- sitting for interviews, holding  rallies and  recording advertisements . Rubio can, however, occasionally break from the Romney campaign, whether  on China  or in his view of the campaign itself. Visiting with reporters and editors at Bloomberg View in New York, Rubio put Obama’s chances of re-election at 50/50 or better -- at a time when most in the  Romney camp say their guy is surging. Rubio projects a more bipartisan bent than is currently found in Washington.  He said he was happy to learn from Senator  Frank Lautenberg , a New Jersey Democrat, when he first arrived.  He and a few Democratic senators, including  Chris Coons  of Delaware and  Joe Manchin  of West Virginia, came  together to introduce the  Agree Act , which gathers  all the components of jobs plans that the two parties had previously agreed on (hence the name -- get it?). It has gone  nowhere. Rubio said he also opened the door to working on immigration reform with Democratic Senator  Richard Durbin  of  Illinois  -- though Rubio never produced legislation. As the son of  Cuban emigres, he said, Rubio takes the issue personally. He knows  people who ended up in the U.S. illegally, he said, because some lawyer ran off with their  money without extending their visas. He knows people whose kids, brought here  illegally, want to come out of hiding. "These are real people," he said. "I live near them,  know their  stories, have seen their tears.” He hates to see the issue “covered as   a sport.” Yet Rubio does not applaud President  Barack Obama ’s executive order to allow immigrant children  who go to school or join the military to stay here legally. To Rubio, Obama has "poisoned the well” for real immigration reform. That sounds a lot like letting the perfect be the enemy of the good -- which doesn’t seem like governing.
