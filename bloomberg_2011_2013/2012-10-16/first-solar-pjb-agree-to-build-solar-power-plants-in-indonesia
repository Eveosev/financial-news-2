First Solar Inc. (FSLR)  and PT Pembangkitan
Jawa Bali (PJB) Services, a unit of state utility company PT
Perusahaan Listrik Negara, agreed to build solar power plants in
 Indonesia  with a generating capacity of 100 megawatts.  The companies signed an agreement to develop, construct and
operate photo-voltaic power plants, First Solar said in an  e-
mailed  statement today. The agreement is the first in Indonesia
for the Tempe, Arizona-based company, it said.  First Solar didnâ€™t disclose where the project will be built
or how much it will spend. Indonesia has said it wants to expand
its use of solar power and other renewable energy sources to
reduce its reliance on fossil fuels.  To contact the reporter on this story:
