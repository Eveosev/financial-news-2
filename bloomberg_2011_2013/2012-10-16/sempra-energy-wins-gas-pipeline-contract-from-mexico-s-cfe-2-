Comision Federal de Electricidad,
Latin America’s largest utility by revenue, awarded a contract
to build and operate a 530-kilometer (329 mile) natural  gas
pipeline  to  Sempra Energy. (SRE)   Sempra will build the gas pipeline in northern  Mexico  and
will operate it for 25 years, CFE, as the Mexico City-based
company is known, said in an e-mailed statement today. The
pipeline will be built in two phases, one to be completed by
October 2014 and the other by July 2015, CFE said.  Mexico, which has the ninth-longest pipeline infrastructure
in the world, is expanding its 6,000-mile gas network by 40
percent as imports increase to a record amid the lowest gas
prices since 2001 in New York. The growing demand for imports is
forcing some pipelines to run at 95 percent of capacity and
creating a bottleneck in some regions prompting shortages.  Sempra’s offer to charge state-owned CFE $0.13 per million
British thermal units defeated bids from companies such as
Calgary-based  TransCanada Corp. (TRP) , Korea Gas Corp. and Mitsui &
Co.  The awarded pipeline contract will connect gas supplies
from Arizona to Guaymas, Sonora, in northwestern Mexico. Once
the two phases are completed the pipeline will have a capacity
of 760 million cubic feet a day and investments may range
between $630 million and $730 million, according to a
 presentation  from the state-owned oil producer  Petroleos
Mexicanos  from last month.  Sempra, based in San Diego, rose 0.5 percent to $67.88 at
the close in New York, the highest since Aug. 20.  To contact the reporter on this story:
