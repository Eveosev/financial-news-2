Latin American countries risk
failing to take advantage of the economic growth cycle to make
structural changes, according to  Fitch Ratings .  “There’s a risk coming from complacency,”  Shelly Shetty ,
the head of Latin America sovereign ratings at Fitch, said in an
interview in New York. “A lot of the countries have benefited
from the commodity boom and improved their macroeconomic
stability, but macroeconomic stability is not a sufficient
condition for a higher growth trajectory.”  Improvements in the business environment, market
flexibility and investment in education are among the changes
the region needs to make, Shetty said.  Latin America is projected to grow 2.94 percent this year,
more than double the 1.26 percent pace for the Group of 10
countries, according to the median forecasts of economists
surveyed by Bloomberg.  Oil prices  averaged $95.94 a barrel in the past year, 56
percent higher than in the previous decade, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Brazil ’s infrastructure investment and the Mexican
Congress’s overhaul of labor law are “good news” for the
region, according to Shetty.  Mexico’s labor legislation was approved by the lower house
on Sept. 29 and if passed by the Senate would make it easier for
employers to hire and fire workers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
