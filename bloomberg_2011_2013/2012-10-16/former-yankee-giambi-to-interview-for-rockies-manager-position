Former New York Yankees first
baseman Jason Giambi will interview for the manager’s job with
the  Colorado  Rockies, team spokesman Jay Alves said.  Giambi, 41, played the last four Major League Baseball
seasons with the Rockies. No date has been set for the former
American League Most Valuable Player’s interview, Alves said
today in an e-mail.  Jim Tracy resigned this month after four seasons as
Colorado’s manager. The Rockies were 294-308 under Tracy,
including a franchise-record 98 losses this year.  Giambi played with the Yankees from 2002 to 2008, hitting
over 30 home runs five times and eclipsing 100 runs-batted in
three times.  A five-time All-Star and 2000 AL MVP, Giambi publicly
admitted in 2007 to using steroids. In 18 MLB seasons he has hit
.280 with 429 home runs and 1,405 RBI.  Rockies bench coach Tom Runnells has interviewed for the
manager’s job, according to the Denver Post. Giambi, who has
kept open the possibility of playing next season, has never
coached at any level, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
