Natural gas futures declined for a
second day in New York as forecasts for mild weather signaled
reduced demand for the heating fuel.  Gas fell 1.4 percent after forecasters including Commodity
Weather Group LLC predicted above-normal temperatures for the
East Coast over the next six to 10 days. Heating demand in the
lower 48 states will be 42 percent below normal Oct. 22 through
Oct. 26, said Weather Derivatives in Belton,  Missouri .  “The spotlight is on the mild  weather forecasts  for the
next couple of weeks,” said Brad Florer, a trader at Kottke
Associates LLC in Louisville,  Kentucky . “Fair value is
somewhere right around where we are right now. We might see a
bit of a tug of war.”  Natural gas for November delivery fell 4.9 cents to $3.437
per million British thermal units on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange , the lowest settlement price since Oct. 8. The futures
have dropped 7.2 percent from a year ago.  February $5.50 calls were the most active gas options in
electronic trading. They were unchanged at 1.1 cents per million
Btu on volume of 6,150 contracts as of 3:04 p.m. Calls accounted
for 70 percent of options volume.  The low temperature in  Boston  on Oct. 23 may be 54 degrees
Fahrenheit (12 Celsius), 10 above normal, and  Washington  may see
a low of 59 degrees, 11 above normal, according to AccuWeather
Inc. in  State College ,  Pennsylvania .  Weather Outlook  The forecasts over the next six to 14 days are “much less
bullish” than they were about a week or so ago, especially in
the Midwest and Northeast, Dominick Chirichella, senior partner
at the Energy Management Institute in New York, said in a note
to clients today.  While demand for gas as a heating fuel is “heading for a
lull after an early winter burst” in the coming weeks, a more
winter will result in 20 percent more heating demand than last
year, he said.  The winter of 2012-2013, spanning November through March,
was the fourth warmest in U.S. record. About 50 percent of U.S.
households use gas for heating, Energy Department data show.  The discount for November futures versus December contracts
gained 4.8 cents to 33 cents, the widest since May 15.  U.S. stockpiles  will enter the heating season at record
levels, according to the Energy Department. Supplies totaled
3.725 trillion cubic feet in the week ended Oct. 5 and may reach
an all-time high of 3.903 trillion by the end of the month,
department estimates show.  A  supply surplus  to the five-year average for the week
ended Oct. 5 narrowed to 7.8 percent from a six-year high of 61
percent at the end of March, department data show.  Record Consumption  Power plants  have been burning a record amount of the fuel
as prices fell below the cost of coal in many U.S. regions.
Demand from electricity generators will average 25.36 billion
cubic feet a day this year, up 22 percent from 2011, the
department said in its Oct. 10  Short-Term Energy Outlook .  Gas prices  trading well above $3 will “leak demand to coal
for power generation,”  Mike Fitzpatrick , editor of the Energy
OverView newsletter in New York, wrote today. Higher prices are
possible for futures as long as gas holds technical support at
$3.327, he said.  Buying gas after it dips appears to be an accepted strategy
“but this will lead to successive overvaluations, making
violent corrections more likely than uninterrupted runs
higher,” Fitzpatrick said.  Gas futures volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was
325,670 as of 2:44 p.m., compared with the three-month average
of 395,000. Volume was 372,531 yesterday. Volume was 383,309 on
Oct. 12. Open interest was 1.19 million contracts. The three-
month average is 1.11 million.  The exchange has a one-business-day delay in reporting full
volume and open interest data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
