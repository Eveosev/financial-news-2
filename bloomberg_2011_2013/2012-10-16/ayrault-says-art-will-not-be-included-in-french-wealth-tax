The French government will not
include art works in its wealth tax, the prime minister and
budget minister said in separate interviews today.  ‘’Art prices are too sensitive and too volatile to have 
such a tax imposed,’’ Budget Minister Jerome Cahuzac told  France 
Inter radio. “We don’t want to be in a country where tax agents
are coming into homes to check on art.”  Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault told Europe1 radio that
the wealth tax would not include art, opposing a parliamentary
amendment to the 2013 budget that calls for including art works
worth more than 50,000 euros in France’s wealth tax.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
