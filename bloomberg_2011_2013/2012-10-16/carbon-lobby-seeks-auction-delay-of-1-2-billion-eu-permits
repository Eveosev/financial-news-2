The Climate Markets & Investment
Association sought a 1.23 billion-ton reduction in supply of
European Union carbon allowances in 2013 and 2014.  There should be no new auctions of carbon allowances in
2013, apart from those sales delayed from 2012 to help finance
new climate-protection technology, the association said today in
an e-mailed statement.  The CMIA recommended a supply control mechanism that would
systematically remove from the market a number of surplus
permits more than three years old, according to the statement.
The mechanism would remove 277 million tons in 2013 alone, the
association said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
