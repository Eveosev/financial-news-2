Gene Sperling , the head of the White
House’s National Economic Council, said that even as the U.S.
economy has shown “signs of healing,” the progress of the
expansion hasn’t been sufficient.  “We haven’t come far enough” and the drop in the jobless
rate has a “long way to go,” Sperling said at a National
Association for Business Economics meeting in New York today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
