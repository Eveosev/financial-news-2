Serbia ’s central bank remains poised
to buy euros to steady the dinar, Governor Jorgovanka Tabakovic
said.  The Belgrade-based Narodna Banka Srbije bought 5 million
euros ($6.5 million) yesterday to smooth fluctuations and wants
to bolster foreign-currency reserves, she said today in an
address to the Foreign Investors Council.  “Maintaining the stability of the  exchange rate  is our
primary task,” Tabakovic told the group of 130 foreign
companies, which have together invested an estimated 17 billion
euros and employ 88,000 people.  The bank bought euros for the first time since May 2011 to
slow the rally in the dinar, bolstered by renewed foreign
investor interest in Serbia’s bond market and increase in bank
lending activity backed by state subsidies.  The dinar traded at 111.5509 to the euro at 3:25 p.m. in
Belgrade, 0.7 percent weaker on the session, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  The National Bank of Serbia is taking advantage of the
firming dinar to somewhat replenish its foreign-exchange
reserves, which fell to 9.9 billion euros at the end of August,
to the lowest level in 14 months. Reserves contracted in the
first half as the central bank sold 1.4 billion euros to slow
declines in the dinar that were triggered by capital outflows.  The central bank raised its  one-week repurchase rate  by a
quarter-point to 10.75 percent on Oct. 9, the fourth increase
since June, to curb inflation.  Tabakovic said policy measures will remain focused on
bringing inflation down to its target of 4 percent, plus or
minus 1.5 percentage points, over the medium term.  Inflation will rise to “around 12 percent” by the end of
2012, driven by a “weak” farming season and an increase in
regulated prices.  To contact the reporter on this story:
