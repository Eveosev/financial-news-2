England â€™s World Cup soccer
qualifying match against Poland has been delayed by rain in

National Stadium, which has a retractable roof that was open.  The game was supposed to kick off at 8 p.m. UK time. Match
officials will now inspect the field at 8:45 UK time before
deciding whether to play the game, Adrian Bevington, Club
England managing director, said in an interview with ITV.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
