Gold Fields Ltd. (GFI) , the world’s
fourth-largest producer of the metal, rose the most in more than
a week in Johannesburg trading as miners started reporting back
for duty at its Beatrix mine after a strike.  About 60 percent to 70 percent are back at work and more
are arriving at the number 1, 2 and 3 shafts, Willie Jacobsz, a
spokesman for the Johannesburg-based company said by phone
today. The shares gained as much as 2.6 percent, the most since
Oct. 5 on an intraday basis, to 108.71 rand  Gold Fields,  AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. (ANG)  and  Harmony Gold Mining
Co. (HAR)  will individually persue legal options after talks with
unions to end strikes that idled half of  South Africa ’s output
failed yesterday, the Solidarity labor union said. The producers
had offered to award workers an additional pay increase for 2012
after agreeing last year to boost pay by 7.5 percent to 10
percent.  Gold Fields traded at 108.32 rand as of 10:23 a.m. local
time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
