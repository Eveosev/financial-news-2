Copper prices rose in  London  for the
first time in three sessions after a report showed industrial
production increased more than forecast in the U.S., the world’s
second-biggest consumer of the metal.  Output at factories, mines and utilities advanced 0.4
percent last month after a 1.4 percent decline in August, the
Federal Reserve said today. The median estimate in a Bloomberg
survey of economists was for a 0.2 percent rise. Copper also
climbed as two German lawmakers said the country is open to Spain
seeking a precautionary credit line, bolstering optimism that
 Europe  can contain its debt crisis.  “The economic and the Spanish-bailout news are helping to
prop things up,” Dennis Cajigas, a senior market strategist at
Zaner Group in  Chicago , said in a telephone interview. “The U.S.
and  China  are driving markets, and the industrial production
figure is boosting expectations for demand.”  Copper for delivery in three months gained 0.4 percent to
settle at $8,125 a metric ton ($3.69 a pound) at 5:50 p.m. on the
London Metal Exchange. Last week, the price fell 2 percent, the
most since July 20, amid concern that demand will ease in the
U.S. and China, the top consumer.  Stockpiles in warehouses monitored by the LME declined 0.7
percent today to 210,725 tons, the lowest since Oct. 23, 2008.  Copper futures for December delivery fell less than 1
percent to settle at $3.70 a pound on the Comex in New York.  On the LME, nickel, aluminum and zinc declined, while lead
and tin gained.  To contact the reporters on this story:
