Alex Rodriguez  and Nick Swisher were
left out of the New York Yankees’ lineup for Game 3 of the
American League Championship Series in Detroit tonight.  Rodriguez and Swisher are hitting a combined .143 for the
Major League Baseball postseason, collecting seven hits in 49
at-bats with 20 strikeouts.  Brett Gardner  gets the start over
Swisher and will play left field, while  Eric Chavez  is at third
base instead of Rodriguez.  “We’ve had some guys struggling so we decided to make some
changes,” Yankees manager Joe Girardi said at a news conference.
“It’s never easy, because these guys have done so much during
the course of the season, but we did it.”  The Tigers hold a 2-0 lead in the best-of-seven ALCS after
winning the first two games at Yankee Stadium, where they held
the Yankees scoreless in 20 of 21 innings.  Gardner is hitting leadoff for the Yankees tonight against
Tigers starting pitcher  Justin Verlander , the 2011 AL Most
Valuable Player and Cy Young Award winner. While Gardner has
only three at-bats since April, he’s 5-for-11 against Verlander
for his career. Swisher is 11-for-61, a .180 average.  Ichiro Suzuki is hitting second, followed by Mark Teixeira,
Robinson Cano, Raul Ibanez, Russell Martin, Chavez and Curtis Granderson. Eduardo Nunez is starting at shortstop in the
absence of the injured  Derek Jeter  and will bat ninth.  To contact the reporter on this story:
