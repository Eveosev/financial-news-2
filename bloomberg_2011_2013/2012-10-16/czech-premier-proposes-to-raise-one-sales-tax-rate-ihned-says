Czech Prime Minister Petr Necas
proposed raising only one of two sales-tax rates as he seeks to
appease lawmakers opposed to higher taxes,  Ihned.cz  reported,
without citing anyone.  The government bill designed to cut the budget deficit
originally envisaged a one percentage-point increase in both
sales-tax rates, to 15 percent and 21 percent, respectively.
Necas now proposes to raise only the lower rate, the website of
Hospodarske Noviny newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
