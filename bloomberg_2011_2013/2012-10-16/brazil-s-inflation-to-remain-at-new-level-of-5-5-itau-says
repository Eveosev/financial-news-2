Brazil’s  inflation  rate will remain
around 5.5 percent, above the central bank’s target,  Itau
Unibanco Holding SA (ITUB) ’s chief economist told reporters in London.  The 5.5 percent rate is the IPCA price index’s “new
level” and will not converge to target,  Ilan Goldfajn  said. The
central bank targets inflation of 4.5 percent plus or minus two
percentage points.  The IPCA index rose 5.28 percent in September from the
previous year. The rate has quickened every month since June,
and was the fastest since February. The national statistics
agency on Oct. 19 will publish the mid-month inflation index.  Carlos Hamilton, the central bank’s economic policy
director, said last month that a spike in commodity prices means
inflation is unlikely to converge to target until the third
quarter of 2013.  President  Dilma Rousseff ’s administration has adopted
measures in recent months to spur the economy, including
lowering taxes on company payrolls and  consumer goods , reducing
bank reserve requirements, and pressuring banks to lower loan
spreads. The central bank, meanwhile, has cut the benchmark
interest  rate  by 525 basis points since August 2011, to a record
low 7.25 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
