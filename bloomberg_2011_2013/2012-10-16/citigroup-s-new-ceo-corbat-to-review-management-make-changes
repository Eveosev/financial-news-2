Michael Corbat , who was named today
to become  Citigroup Inc. (C) ’s chief executive officer, said he’ll
spend the next several weeks scrutinizing the bank’s management
structure and businesses before making changes.  “These assessments will result in some changes,” Corbat
wrote today in a memo to employees of the New York-based firm.
“I will make sure to communicate these changes with you as
decisions are made so that you are informed and updated.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
