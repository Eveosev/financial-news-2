Mexico ’s peso bonds fell, following
Treasuries lower and pushing the Latin American nation’s yields
to a three-week high, as better-than-forecast U.S. industrial
output reduced demand for assets seen as a refuge.  Yields on Mexico’s peso bonds due in 2024 rose three basis
points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 5.45 percent at 4 p.m. in
Mexico City, the highest close basis since Sept. 21, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. The price fell 0.31 centavo to
140.45 centavos per peso. The currency depreciated 0.2 percent
to 12.8337 per dollar after touching a one-week intraday high of
12.7702.  Demand for Treasuries and Mexican bonds is declining after
data showed “the U.S. numbers are slightly better,” Dirk Willer, the head of Latin American local markets strategy at
Citigroup Inc., said by phone from New York. “In general, the
U.S. growth data have been surprising on the positive side for a
long time.”  Output from U.S. factories, mines and utilities rose 0.4
percent in September after a 1.4 percent decrease in the prior
month, the Federal Reserve reported today. The median forecast
of 85 economists in a Bloomberg survey was for a 0.2 percent
increase. The Commerce Department reported yesterday that retail
sales gained last month more than forecast. The U.S. is the
destination for about 80 percent of Mexico’s exports.  The 60-day  correlation coefficient  between 10-year peso
bonds and Treasuries rose today to 0.58 from 0.49 on Oct. 12,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. A reading of 1 would
mean the two securities move in lockstep. The measure was
negative as recently as Aug. 2.  2012 Gain  The peso’s decline today pared this year’s gain to 8.6
percent, still the biggest advance among the dollar’s 16 most-
traded counterparts.  Mexico sold all 7 billion pesos ($546 million) in one-month
bills, known as Cetes, that it offered today at auction,
according to the central bank. The Finance Ministry also sold
all 8 billion pesos of the three-month securities, 9 billion
pesos of the six-month notes and 9.5 billion pesos of 336-day
bills that it offered.  The central bank also reported today on its website that
Mexico’s international reserves fell by $217 million last week
to $161.5 billion, dropping for a second straight five-day
period. Mexico’s reserves have climbed 13 percent this year,
giving central bank Governor Agustin Carstens greater leeway to
intervene in the foreign exchange market to buoy the peso if
needed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
