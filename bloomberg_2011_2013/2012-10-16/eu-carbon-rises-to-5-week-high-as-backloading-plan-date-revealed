European carbon allowances closed at
their highest in five weeks after the regulator in Brussels said
yesterday it would reveal details of its plan to fix a supply
glut on Nov. 14 and as natural gas and power advanced.  European Union carbon for December jumped 4 percent to
close at 8 euros ($10.44) a metric ton, the highest since Sept.
7, on the ICE Futures Europe exchange in  London . German power
for 2013 increased 0.5 percent and U.K. summer natural gas
rebounded 0.9 percent.  The Climate Markets & Investment Association sought a 1.23
billion-ton reduction in supply of EU carbon in 2013 and 2014
combined, as the European Commission seeks to fix the glut
through a policy known as backloading supply toward 2020.  There should be no new auctions of carbon allowances in
2013, apart from those sales to help finance new climate-
protection technology that are delayed from 2012, the
association said today in an e-mailed statement.  The CMIA recommended a supply control mechanism that would
systematically remove from the market a number of surplus
permits more than three years old by cutting the volume for
sale. The mechanism would take out 1.6 billion tons in the four
years through 2015, the association said.  “CMIA is particularly concerned by reports that the
backloading proposal will be considered on a slower legislative
timetable than was first indicated,” according to the
statement. “Further prevarication and mismanagement of
expectations risks compounding already low market confidence.”  United Nations Certified Emission Reductions for December
advanced 6.2 percent to 1.55 euros a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
