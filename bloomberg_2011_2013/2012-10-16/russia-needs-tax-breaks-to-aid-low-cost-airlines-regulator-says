Russia needs tax breaks for the
purchase of Boeing and Airbus planes in order to help national
low-cost airlines to develop, the country’s competition watchdog
said on its website today.  “The model of low-cost transportation works only if a
specific type of a carrier is used,” the Governmental Anti-
Monopoly Service said, citing the Airbus A320 and Boeing’s 737.  To contact the reporter on this story:
