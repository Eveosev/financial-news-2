HCA Holdings Inc. (HCA) , the biggest U.S.
for-profit hospital operator, increased an offering of bonds by
25 percent to $2.5 billion in its second sale this year.  The company issued $1.25 billion each of 4.75 percent
senior secured notes to yield 304 basis points more than
similar-maturity Treasuries and 5.875 percent, senior unsecured
debt at a relative yield of 417 basis points, according to a
person familiar with the transaction, who asked not to be
identified citing lack of authorization to speak publicly. The
bonds mature in May 2023.  Proceeds will be used to repay HCA’s B-1 term loan maturing
in November 2013 and to pay a stockholder dividend, the company
said in a filing today. The company initially marketed $2
billion of bonds.  HCA last sold debt in February, issuing $1.35 billion of
5.875 percent, 10-year secured debentures to yield 392 basis
points more than similar-maturity Treasuries, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Moody’s Investors Service rates the senior secured debt Ba3
and the senior unsecured bonds B3, the ratings company said
today.  Bank of America Corp., Barclays Plc, Citigroup Inc.,
Deutsche Bank AG, Goldman Sachs Group Inc., JPMorgan Chase &
Co., and Wells Fargo & Co. managed the sale, the Nashville,
Tennessee-based company said in a statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
