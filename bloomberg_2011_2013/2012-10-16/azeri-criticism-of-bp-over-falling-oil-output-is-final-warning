Azeri President  Ilham Aliyev ’s
criticism of  BP Plc (BP/)  for lower-than-expected oil output from the
Azeri-Chirag-Guneshli, or ACG, field was a final warning, Oqtay
Asadov, the speaker of the national parliament, said today.  “BP will fulfill its commitments on oil production in
Azerbaijan because it was warned for the last time,” Asadov
said today, according to the private APA news service.  Aliyev said last week that the U.K. producer, which is
behind the ACG and Shah Deniz natural-gas development, had made
“grave mistakes” which resulted in an “unexpected decline”
at the country’s largest deposit.  ACG output fell 12 percent in the first half of 2012 from a
year earlier, according to data on BP website. The field
produced 35.4 million tons, or 78 percent of  Azerbaijan ’s crude,
last year.  Industry and Energy Minister Natiq Aliyev said yesterday
that BP faces “no threat” in Azerbaijan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
