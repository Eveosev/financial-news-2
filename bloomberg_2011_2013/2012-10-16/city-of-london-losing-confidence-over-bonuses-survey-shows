Almost a fifth of employees in
 London ’s financial district don’t expect to receive a bonus this
year, according to a survey by recruitment website
 eFinancialCareers .  That compares with 11 percent who anticipated they wouldn’t
get the payment, known in the industry as a “doughnut,” in
2011, the company said in a statement today. About 42 percent in
the City expect a lower bonus than last year, up from 37
percent.  The poll of 828 bankers traders and investment
professionals shows confidence about pay in the U.K.’s financial
district has dwindled before the year-end bonus season. Banks
and other financial firms in western  Europe  have cut more than
30,000 jobs this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg
Industries, as the euro-region crisis roils markets and trading
activity is muted.  “Pay for performance is still ingrained in the culture of
financial services in the City,” James Bennett, global managing
director of eFinancialCareers, said in the statement. “However,
continued pressure from market conditions, overall business
performance and public opinion are serving to moderate
expectations in the sector”  About 38 percent said they expect a higher bonus this year
and 21 percent anticipate no change, according to the survey
conducted in September and October.  Separately, the median salary increase for executive
directors in Britain’s FTSE 250 publicly traded companies rose 3
percent this year, the same as last year, according to the
accounting firm  Deloitte LLP .  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
