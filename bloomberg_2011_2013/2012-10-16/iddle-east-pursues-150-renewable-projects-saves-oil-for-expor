The Middle East and North Africa,
home to about half the world’s oil reserves, has more than 150
renewable-energy projects under way, a map from the Abu Dhabi-
based  Clean Energy Business Council  shows.  The interactive  map , based on Google Inc. technology, plots
solar, wind, geothermal and biomass plants in the region, the
council’s website shows. It will be updated regularly to track
the industry’s progress, the CEBC said today in a statement.  “By making this data available to the public, we hope to
push further the development of the renewable-energy industry,”
said Aaron Bielenberg, chief executive officer of the council.
“The previous general lack of awareness made policy makers and
capital providers feel the industry was smaller and hence
riskier than it actually is.”  Countries in the Middle East and North Africa were
responsible for 36 percent of global oil production and held 52
percent of proved reserves last year, according to BP Plc data.
The region is now developing alternative sources of energy to
meet rising domestic demand and save more crude for export.  While the Middle East’s  renewables capacity  as a percentage
of total energy output remains lower than all other regions,
cumulative capacity more than doubled in the past 10 years,
according to data provider Energici Holdings Inc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
