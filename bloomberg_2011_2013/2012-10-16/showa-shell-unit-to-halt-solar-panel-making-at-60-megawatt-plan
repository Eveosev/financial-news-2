Solar Frontier K.K., a unit of
 Japan ’s  Showa Shell Sekiyu K.K. (5002) , will suspend production at a
facility that has the capacity to make 60 megawatts of solar
panels annually to focus on a larger plant.  Production at the MP2 plant in Miyazaki prefecture in
southwestern Japan will stop at the end of this year. The
facility may be used to make “specialized solar products
currently in development,” according to an e-mailed statement
from Solar Frontier today.  The larger Kunitomi plant, which began production in
February 2011, may produce solar products with a capacity of 600
megawatts this year, Akane Yamiya, a Solar Frontier spokeswoman,
said by phone today.  Most of the MP2 plant’s 200-strong workforce will be
transferred to the Kunitomi factory or domestic sales, Yamiya
said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
