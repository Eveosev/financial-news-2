Federal Grid Co. surged for the
first day in three as President  Vladimir Putin  decided against a
proposed merger of the monopoly for high-voltage power
transmission with OAO MRSK Holding, a power distributor.  Federal Grid jumped 1.7 percent to 23.348 kopeks by the
close in Moscow. MRSK Holding slumped 4.1 percent to 1.982
rubles.  Putin approved creating a management company for the
country’s power grids, rejecting a proposed merger, Energy
Minister Alexander Novak told reporters yesterday after a
government meeting.  “The news is positive primarily for Federal Grid Company,
whose margins would substantially worsen following a merger with
less profitable MRSKs,” Alfa Bank analysts, led by Alexander Kornilov, said in an e-mailed report. “The latter would also
bring a lot of problems to Federal Grid shareholders, including
high grid losses, poor payment discipline,”  Putin also supported pilot sales of state stakes in one or
two regional grids after distribution fees are revised, Novak
said. The president said earlier at the meeting that industry
management must change and minority shareholder interests must
be respected.  To contact the reporters on this story:
