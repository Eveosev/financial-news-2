European (SXXP)  stocks rose as two German
lawmakers said the country is open to Spain seeking a
precautionary credit line from Europe’s rescue fund, and German
investor confidence advanced more than expected in October.  BNP Paribas SA and  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  paced gains among
banking shares.  Rio Tinto  Group rose 2.9 percent after the
mining company posted third-quarter iron-ore output that beat
analyst projections. GKN Plc fell 3.4 percent after forecasting
weaker demand in Europe.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index climbed 1.3 percent to 274.38 at
the close of trading, the first time the benchmark gauge has
risen for two straight days since Sept. 12. It has rallied 17
percent from a June 4 low as European Central Bank policy makers
agreed on an unlimited bond-buying plan and the  Federal Reserve 
announced a third round of quantitative easing.  European stocks will “stay positive for the rest of the
year, with a limited upside of 5-6 percent,” Benoit Peloille,
equity market strategist at Natixis, told Maryam Nemazee in a
Bloomberg Television interview. “As the political  risk premium 
will be corrected in a few weeks, the markets can re-focus on
the growth issue.”  Germany is open to Spain seeking a precautionary credit
line from Europe’s rescue fund, two senior coalition lawmakers
said. The comments by Michael Meister, a deputy caucus leader of
 Chancellor Angela Merkel ’s Christian Democratic bloc, and
 Norbert Barthle , her party’s budget spokesman, signal a reversal
of Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble ’s position that Germany
is opposed to a full sovereign bailout for Spain.  ‘Possible Move’  Schaeuble said as recently as last month Spain shouldn’t
seek aid in addition to its bank bailout. The Mediterranean
nation won’t request aid until the terms are clearer, its Prime
Minister  Mariano Rajoy  has said. A precautionary credit line
“would be a possible move” for Spain, Barthle said in a text
message today.  German investor sentiment improved for a second month in
October. The ZEW Center for European Economic Research in
Mannheim said its  index of investor and analyst expectations ,
which aims to predict economic developments six months in
advance, climbed to minus 11.5 from minus 18.2 in September.
Economists forecast an increase to minus 14.9, according to the
median of 36 estimates in a Bloomberg News  survey .  Greek Finance Minister Yannis Stournaras told lawmakers in
Athens today that his country needs a two-year extension to meet
its bailout targets. The indebted country sold 1.65 billion
euros ($2.15 billion) of 13-week Treasury bills at a yield of
4.24 percent today.  Benchmarks Gain  National benchmark indexes rose in all 18 western European
markets except Iceland. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 gained 1.1 percent,
Germany’s DAX added 1.6 percent, while France’s CAC 40 climbed
2.4 percent.  European stock holdings climbed to a 20-month high as the
so-called U.S. fiscal cliff became a bigger concern for
investors than the euro-region debt crisis for a second month, a
Bank of America Corp. survey showed. A net 10 percent of money
managers, who together oversee $561 billion, are now overweight
euro-area equities, according to the survey.  In the U.S., industrial production rose 0.4 percent last
month, following a revised 1.4 percent drop in August, a Federal
Reserve report showed. Economists had projected a 0.2 percent
increase.  A gauge of banking shares was the best performing group
among 19 industries in the Stoxx 600.  BNP Paribas SA (BNP)  advanced
4.3 percent to 40.70 euros, Deutsche Bank AG increased 5.1
percent to 34.60 euros and  Banco Santander SA (SAN)  gained 4.3 percent
to 6.06 euros.  UBS Rises  UBS AG (UBSN)  added 3 percent to 12.37 francs. Chief Financial
Officer Tom Naratil said the Swiss bank fired as many as 550
employees after suffering a $2.3 billion loss from unauthorized
trading last year. Naratil testified yesterday at the London
trial of Kweku Adoboli, the trader accused of causing the loss.  Rio Tinto climbed 2.9 percent to 3,061 pence after the
mining company said iron-ore production rose to 52.6 million
metric tons in the three months to Sept. 30, exceeding the
average estimate of 50.65 million tons.  Telefonica SA (TEF)  advanced 3.4 percent to 10.52 euros after
pricing the shares of its German unit in the range of 5.25 euros
to 6.50 euros each.  Bellway Plc jumped 3.2 percent to 980 pence after saying it
plans to raise its dividend by 59 percent. The U.K. homebuilder
said in a statement annual profit rose 58 percent to 79.3
million pounds ($128 million).  Imagination Climbs  Imagination Technologies Group Plc (IMG)  jumped 7.9 percent to
478.9 pence after Numis Securities raised its recommendation on
the shares to buy from hold. Separately, Liberum Capital Ltd.
upgraded the stock to hold from sell.  GKN Plc (GKN)  lost 3.4 percent to 204.8 pence after the British
maker of car components forecast “softening” demand in some
European automotive and industrial markets to have “some
impact” on fourth-quarter profit.  A gauge of auto companies in the Stoxx 600 was the worst
performing group on the index. European car sales plunged the
most in almost two years, with  Renault SA (RNO)  and  Fiat SpA (F)  posting
the steepest declines, as demand weakened in Germany.  Registrations plummeted 11 percent to 1.13 million vehicles
last month from 1.27 million a year earlier, the Brussels-based
 European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association , or ACEA, said
today in a statement. It was the 12th consecutive monthly drop
and the biggest decline since October 2010.  Renault dropped 1 percent to 35.48 euros and  Peugeot SA (UG) 
fell 3.4 percent to 5.80 euros. Fiat fell 0.1 percent to 4.24
euros, after earlier losing as much as 2.5 percent.  Nokian Renkaat Oyj (NRE1V)  plunged 12 percent to 29.98 euros, the
most since December 2008, after the Nordic region’s largest tire
maker said second-half operating profit will decline on weak
demand and lower prices in Europe.  To contact the reporter on this story:
