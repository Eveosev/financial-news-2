Lithuanian  inflation  under European
Union methodology will probably rise to 3.6 percent from a year
earlier in October, the statistics office said.  Consumer prices may advance 0.2 percent from the previous
month, the office, based in the capital, Vilnius, said today in
an e-mailed statement. Inflation was 3.3 percent in September,
it said, lower than the initial 3.4 percent estimate released
Oct. 8.  Lithuania has said it may seek to adopt the euro as early
as 2014. Countries wishing to make the currency switch must keep
inflation at less than 1.5 percentage points above the average
of the three lowest levels in the EU.  To contact the reporter on this story:
