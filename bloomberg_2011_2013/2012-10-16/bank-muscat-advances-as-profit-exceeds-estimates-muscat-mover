Bank Muscat SAOG (BKMB)  advanced to the
highest level in almost a month after Oman’s biggest lender
posted a 20 percent increase in  third-quarter profit , beating
analysts’ estimates as lending grew.  The shares rose as much as 1.6 percent to 0.565 rial before
closing at 0.561 rial, the highest since Sept. 19. The stock was
the second- biggest gainer  and the  most traded  by value on Oman’s
 MSM30 Index (MSM30) , which climbed 0.6 percent. Third-quarter  net income 
rose to 35.8 million rials ($93 million) from 29.9 million rials
a year earlier, according to Bloomberg calculations based on
nine-month results provided by the bank.  Quarterly profit beat the 32.6 million-rial mean estimate
of six analysts compiled by Bloomberg. The bank’s nine-month net
interest income increased 5.3 percent to 168.3 million rials as
loans and advances jumped 18 percent, the lender said. Omani
banks’ profits will climb 25 percent in the third quarter, the
fastest pace in the Gulf Cooperation Council, helped by a rights
issue at Bank Muscat, Arqaam Capital Ltd. said last month.  “After a disappointing second quarter, this comes as a
relief, with net interest margins going up sequentially,”  Jaap Meijer , a Dubai-based analyst at Arqaam, said in an e-mailed
note today. “We view the stock as attractive, offering a cheap
entry point into the leading Omani-based bank and fears for net
interest margins compression are overdone.”  Shares of Bank Muscat, which said in August its rights
issue was subscribed 1.275 times, have dropped 13 percent in
2012, lagging the benchmark  stock index , which is little changed
in the period. The stock trades at a  price-to-earnings ratio  of
8.5 times, compared with  11 times  for the MSM30 Index.  Thirteen analysts  including Meijer recommend investors buy
the shares of Bank Muscat, while one has a hold rating on the
stock, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
