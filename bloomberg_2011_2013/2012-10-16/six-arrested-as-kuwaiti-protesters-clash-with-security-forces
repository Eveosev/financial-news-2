Six people were arrested last night
after a demonstration by  Kuwait â€™s opposition movement turned
violent and protesters clashed with security forces.  Thousands of people had assembled outside the parliament
building in Kuwait City to protest against what the opposition
claimed was an attempt by the government to amend the election
law. Clashes broke out when security personnel tried to prevent
protesters from marching on the streets, the first since
demonstrators stormed parliament in December. Processions are
illegal in Kuwait without prior permission.  Kuwaiti Emir Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmed Al-Jaber Al-Sabah
dissolved parliament on Oct. 7, a move welcomed by the
opposition that paves the way for fresh elections. It was the
third dissolution of parliament in less than a year, and
followed a Constitutional Court ruling against a government bid
to amend the electoral system.  No date has been set for the elections, which must be held
within two months of parliament being dissolved, according to
the constitution.  To contact the reporter on this story:
