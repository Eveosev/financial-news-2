European car deliveries headed for
their biggest annual plunge in 19 years after the region’s
deliveries tumbled 11 percent in September.  Registrations last month dropped to 1.13 million vehicles
from 1.27 million a year earlier, the Brussels-based  European
Automobile Manufacturers’ Association , or ACEA, said today.
Nine-month sales fell 7.2 percent.  The market is now on track to decrease as much as 10
percent in 2012, the worst sales slump since the aftermath in
1993 of the region’s currency crisis, the ACEA said.  Renault SA (RNO) 
posted a European sales drop in September of 29 percent, while
 Fiat SpA (F)  decreased 19 percent. Tiremaker  Nokian Renkaat Oyj (NRE1V) 
forecast second-half operating profit will fall on weak demand.  “We have seen the European market deteriorate, from an
already weak level, rather than recover,” said  Marc-Rene Tonn ,
a Hamburg-based Warburg Research analyst. “That is something
that is weighing on the shares.”  Renault fell 1 percent to 35.48 euros at the close in
Paris.  PSA Peugeot Citroen (UG) ,  Europe ’s second-biggest carmaker,
declined 3.4 percent, while Fiat dropped 0.1 percent in Milan.  The region’s declining auto market has begun to hit
tiremakers as well. Nokian Renkaat today reported preliminary
third-quarter revenue and operating profit that missed analysts’
expectations. European replacement tire sales, which account for
about 75 percent of the industry’s revenue, will fall around 5.9
percent this year, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said Sept. 12.  Tiremakers Drop  Nokian Renkaat plummeted 12 percent, the biggest drop since
Dec. 12, 2008, to 29.98 euros at the close in Helsinki. Michelin
& Cie, Europe’s biggest tiremaker, fell 3.6 percent, while
 Continental AG (CON) , the region’s No. 2 tiremaker, dropped 2.1
percent.  Four of Europe’s five biggest automotive markets shrank
last month, with German deliveries, which account for 25 percent
of the region’s total sales, dropping 11 percent.  A jump in so-called self-registrations by dealers,
accounting for 33.5 percent of the market in September versus
28.7 percent a year earlier, prevented the German drop from
being even steeper, according to  Ferdinand Dudenhoeffer ,
director of the Center for Automotive Research at the  University
of Duisburg-Essen .  “The higher the self-registration numbers, the more
difficult the market gets and the higher incentive spending
becomes,” Dudenhoeffer said today in a report. “The car market
in  Germany  is getting tougher and shifting into a recession.”  Steeper Decline  The ACEA compiles auto-sales figures from the 27 European
Union countries plus  Switzerland ,  Norway  and  Iceland . The trade
group on Oct. 12 predicted a 2012 market contraction of 8
percent to 10 percent, steeper than a 7 percent drop it
projected earlier.  General Motors Co. (GM) ’s group sales in Europe last month
dropped 16 percent to 95,398 vehicles, led by a 20 percent drop
for the Chevrolet marque. GM’s main Opel and Vauxhall brands in
the region posted a 16 percent decline. The Detroit-based
carmaker has racked up $16.8 billion in losses in Europe since
1999. The business posted a first-half loss before interest and
taxes of $617 million, and wrote down $590 million of goodwill.  Opel has proposed closing a factory in Bochum, Germany, at
the end of 2016 in the first shutdown of a car plant in the
country since World War II.  European sales by Dearborn, Michigan-based  Ford Motor Co. (F) 
declined 15 percent to 92,603 cars. The U.S. company’s European
pretax operating losses widened to $404 million in the second
quarter from $149 million in the first quarter. The business
earned profit of $176 million a year earlier.  Ford Losses  Ford forecast on July 25 that its full-year European losses
will exceed $1 billion, double an earlier forecast. Roelant de Waard, vice president of marketing, sales and service at the
Ford of Europe division, said on Sept. 27 that the carmaker has
been among manufacturers in the region boosting sales figures
through self-registrations, in which dealers sell cars to
themselves without having customer orders.  Peugeot posted an 8.6 percent slide in sales in the region
last month to 121,898 cars. The Paris-based manufacturer has
been burning through 200 million euros in cash a month as the
auto market contracts, a figure that may fall by 50 percent in
2013, Chief Executive Officer Philippe Varin said Sept. 27.  Registrations in Europe by market leader  Volkswagen AG (VOW)  fell
8.4 percent last month to 269,953 vehicles as the main VW brand
posted a 14 percent drop. Sales at the Audi luxury marque rose
1.3 percent. Wolfsburg, Germany-based Volkswagen is cutting back
parts purchases by as much as 10 percent and demanding cheaper
components in response to the weak market in the region,
suppliers said last week.  Daimler AG (DAI) , whose Mercedes-Benz ranks third in the luxury-
vehicle industry after the BMW and Audi brands, reported a 6.6
percent slide in September European sales to 60,803 vehicles,
with declines of 6.1 percent at Mercedes and 11 percent at the
Smart two-seat car division..  To contact the reporter on this story:
