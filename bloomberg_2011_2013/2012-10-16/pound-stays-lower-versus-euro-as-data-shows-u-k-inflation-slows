The pound stayed lower against the
euro after a report showed U.K. inflation slowed to the least in
almost three years in September.  Sterling was 0.2 percent weaker at 80.74 pence per euro at
9:32 a.m. London time and was 0.2 percent stronger at $1.6098.  Consumer prices rose 2.2 percent from a year earlier, the
least since November 2009 and down from a 2.5 percent gain in
August, the  Office for National Statistics  said today in London.
That matched the median forecast of 37 economists in a Bloomberg
News survey.  U.K. government bonds stayed lower after the data, with the
10-year gilt yield rising one basis point to 1.77 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
