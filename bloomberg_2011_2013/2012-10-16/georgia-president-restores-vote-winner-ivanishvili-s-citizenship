Georgia’s President Mikheil
Saakashvili restored billionaire Bidzina Ivanishvili’s
citizenship, paving the way for his nomination this week as
prime minister.  “Ivanishvili’s citizenship is now restored and will be
valid as soon as his French citizenship is annulled,”
Saakashvili’s spokeswoman Manana Manjgaladze said today by phone
from the capital, Tbilisi.  Ivanishvili announced last year that he would give up his
French citizenship. He was stripped of his Georgian citizenship
in October 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
