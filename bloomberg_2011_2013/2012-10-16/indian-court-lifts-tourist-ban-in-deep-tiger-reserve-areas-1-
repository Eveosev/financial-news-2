India ’s  Supreme Court  allowed
tourists in deeper parts of tiger reserves, almost three months
after barring their entry into breeding grounds to conserve the
endangered species.  The top court today permitted tourism in 20 percent of the
core areas of the nation’s 41 tiger sanctuaries, approving the
government’s new guidelines that regulate tourism.  India, home to the world’s largest number of wild tigers,
is trying to protect the big cats from habitat destruction and
poachers engaged in illegal trade of skin and body parts.  Travel
Operators for Tigers , a lobby group, says a ban would dent
India’s tourism industry, which the government says brings in
more than $100 billion in revenue and 17 million overseas
visitors annually.  Ajay Dubey, a citizen who filed a petition in the Supreme
Court, wants a tourism ban in critical tiger habitat.
Conservationists and tour operators say ensuring local people
benefit financially from protecting tigers is key to persuading
them not to work with poachers or encroach on reserves.  The Supreme Court banned tiger tourism on July 24.  National
Tiger Conservation Authority  says the wild-cat population in
reserves was 1,706 at the end of 2010. India’s tiger count has
fallen from about 40,000 a century ago, according to the
government’s Project Tiger, a campaign started in 1973.  To contact the reporters on this story:
