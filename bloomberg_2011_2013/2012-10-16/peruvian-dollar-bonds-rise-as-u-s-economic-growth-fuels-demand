Peru ’s dollar bonds rallied, pushing
yields to a record low, as rising U.S. retail sales and
industrial output brightened the outlook for the world’s largest
economy and fueled demand for emerging-market assets.  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 6.55 percent dollar-
denominated bond due in March 2037 decreased four basis points,
or 0.04 percentage point, to 3.50 percent at 3:37 p.m. in Lima,
according to Bloomberg prices. The price rose 0.75 cent to
149.75 cents per dollar.  Treasuries fell and U.S. stocks rallied after the  Federal
Reserve  reported that output at factories, mines and utilities
rose 0.4 percent last month after a 1.4 percent decline in
August. The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of 85
economists called for production to rise 0.2 percent. The
Commerce Department said yesterday that retail sales climbed 1.1
percent in September.  “Investors are searching for yield” in emerging markets,
said  Diego Donadio , a Latin America strategist at BNP Paribas in
Sao Paulo. “The Peruvian market typically attracts a lot of
attention from foreigners.”  The sol was little changed at 2.5825 per  U.S. dollar ,
according to Deutsche Bank AG’s local unit. The central bank
bought $100 million in the  spot market  and said on its website
it paid an average 2.5827 soles per dollar.  Investors will probably increase purchases of long-duration
Peruvian sol-denominated bonds as global financial markets
stabilize, Daniel Chodos, a strategist at Credit Suisse Group
AG, said in a research note e-mailed to clients today.  “Appealing yields, low sol volatility and strong economic
fundamentals” make Peru’s local-currency-bond market
attractive, Chodos wrote.  The yield on the benchmark 7.84 percent sol-denominated
bond due in August 2020 fell one basis point to 4.25 percent,
according to prices compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
