Senegal  was thrown out of the 2013
Africa Cup of Nations following crowd trouble that caused its
home qualifying match to be abandoned last weekend, the
Confederation of African Football said on its  website .  The crowd threw stones, bottles, firecrackers and other
objects onto the field in Dakar, and tear gas was used,
promoting the referee to halt the Oct. 13 match against  Ivory
Coast  after 74 minutes.  The CAF disciplinary board met yesterday in Cairo and
awarded Ivory Coast a 2-0 victory, according to competition
rules. Ivory Coast advances by a 6-2 score over the two-match
series.  “If the referee is forced to stop the match before the end
of the regular time because of invasion of the field or
aggression against the visiting team, the host team shall be
considered loser and shall be eliminated from the competition,
without prejudice to the sanctions existing in the
regulations,” the rule states, according to CAF.  The Ivory Coast, which featured Manchester City players
Yaya Toure and Kolo Toure, was winning 2-0 on goals from former
Chelsea striker Didier Drogba when the match was halted.
Senegal’s team included Newcastle’s Demba Ba and Papiss Cisse.  The  Africa Cup of Nations  in  South Africa  begins Jan. 19,
with the final scheduled Feb. 10 in Johannesburg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
