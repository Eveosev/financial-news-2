Cattle futures rose, heading for the
biggest gain in two weeks, on signs of increasing demand for
U.S. beef. Hog prices dropped.  Wholesale  beef  jumped 1.2 percent to $1.9396 a pound
yesterday, the highest since Sept. 20, U.S. Department of
Agriculture data show. The 2.6 percent gain this month signals
support for the meat market, said Chad Henderson, the president
of Prime Agricultural Consultants Inc.  Steers  averaged $1.2389
cents a pound on spot markets last week, up 0.3 percent from a
week earlier, government data show.  “You’ve got the good push in the beef,” Henderson said in
a telephone interview from Brookfield,  Wisconsin . “There’s
really some optimism in here that this thing can run some.”  Cattle futures for December delivery gained 0.5 percent to
$1.2665 a pound at 10:07 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange. A close at that level would be the biggest increase
for the most-active contract since Oct. 1. Prices are up 4.3
percent this year.  Feeder-cattle futures for November settlement rose 0.6
percent to $1.46375 a pound in  Chicago .  Hog futures for December settlement slipped 0.1 percent to
78.5 cents a pound in Chicago. Through yesterday, prices were
down 6.8 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
