Japanese  shares  rose, with the
 Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average increasing the most in about a month,
as exporters gained after U.S. retail sales beat estimates and
the yen weakened.  Sony Corp. (6758) , Japan’s biggest exporter of consumer
electronics, rose 2.4 percent.  Softbank Corp. (9984) , the nation’s
third-biggest mobile-phone carrier, soared 9.6 percent after
agreeing to acquire Sprint Nextel Corp. for $20.1 billion. Kirin
Holdings Co., the biggest Japanese brewer by market value, sank
2.4 percent after cutting its 2015 sales forecast on a weaker
outlook for beer sales.  The Nikkei 225 gained 1.4 percent to 8,701.31 at the 3 p.m.
close in  Tokyo , the steepest advance since Sept. 14. The broader
Topix climbed 1.3 percent to 732.40, with more than three times
as many shares rising as falling.  “Personal consumption in the U.S. is getting more solid
than expected,” said  Fumiyuki Nakanishi , a strategist at Tokyo-
based SMBC Friend Securities Co. Stronger retail sales “will
likely encourage expectations for year-end sales and favorable
October-December corporate earnings.”  The Topix has risen 1.9 since Sept. 6 when the  European
Central Bank  started a global wave of stimulus to fight a
slowdown in growth, with the U.S. Federal Reserve and the  Bank
of Japan  following suit. The price of shares on the equity gauge
stood at 0.9 times book value, compared with 2.2 times for the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 1.5 times for the  Europe  Stoxx
600 Index.  U.S. Retail  Futures on the  S&P 500 (SPXL1)  added 0.1 percent today. The gauge
climbed 0.8 percent yesterday after U.S. retail sales gained 1.1
percent in September following a revised 1.2 percent increase in
August, the best back-to-back showing since late 2010, Commerce
Department figures showed. A Bloomberg survey of economists
called for a 0.8 percent rise.  Shares also gained as Citigroup Inc. reached a six-month
high after reporting a surprise third-quarter profit and bond-
trading revenue that beat expectations.                  The U.S. retail report was “not bad and such economic data
is weakening the yen, which is good for Japanese markets,” said
Seiichiro Iwamoto, who helps oversee about $34 billion at Mizuho
Asset Management Co. in Tokyo. “Investors’ strong inclination
to seek safety is easing.”  The yen fell against all of its 16 major counterparts,
depreciating to as low as 78.91 against the dollar today in
Tokyo, compared with 78.56 at the close of  stock trading 
yesterday. The Japanese currency weakened to 102.39 against the
euro from 101.47. A weaker yen boosts the value of overseas
income at Japanese companies when repatriated.  Sony rose 2.4 percent to 937 yen. Kyocera Corp., an
electronics maker that gets almost a third its sales from Europe
and the U.S., gained 2.7 percent to 6,770 yen.  Softbank Acquisition  Softbank soared 9.6 percent to 2,485 yen, the biggest gain
on the Nikkei 225, after agreeing to buy about 70 percent of
Sprint Nextel for $20.1 billion to expand into the U.S. mobile-
phone services market. The deal will be funded by cash and
bridge financing, and Softbank won’t issue new shares, President
Masayoshi Son said yesterday.  Kirin lost 2.4 percent to 1,009 yen. The brewer cut its
2015 sales forecast on weakening demand in  Japan  and
expectations for slower growth at its Australian unit. Sales at
Kirin will reach at least 2.3 trillion yen ($29.3 billion) by
2015, lower than an earlier projection of 3 trillion yen.  A gauge of  volatility  on the Nikkei 225 rose 1.3 percent to
17.58, indicating that traders expect a swing of 5 percent on
the equity benchmark in the next 30 days.  To contact the reporters on this story:
