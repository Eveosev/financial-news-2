CBS Corp. (CBS) , owner of the most-watched
U.S. TV network, extended the contract of Chief Executive
Officer  Leslie Moonves  through June 2017.  The five-year accord, replacing one expiring in 2015, gives
Moonves the option to create a production company under CBS and
makes him eligible to serve as an executive adviser for an added
four years, New York-based CBS said yesterday in a statement.  Moonves, 63, has led CBS to ratings victories in total
viewers for nine of the past 10 years. His salary will remain at
the current level, reported as $3.5 million for 2011 in CBS’s
proxy  statement , and he remains eligible for a bonus and equity-
based pay. His total compensation amounted to $69.9 million last
year, based on regulatory reporting requirements.  CBS, controlled by billionaire Sumner Redstone, rose 0.8
percent to $34.03 yesterday in New York. The stock has gained 25
percent this year to rank eighth in the S&P 500 Media Index.
 Time Warner Cable Inc. (TWC)  is first at 55 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
