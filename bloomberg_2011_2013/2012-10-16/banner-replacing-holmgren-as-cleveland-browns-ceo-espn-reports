Former Philadelphia Eagles President
Joe Banner will be named the Cleveland Browns chief executive
officer, and current president Mike Holmgren will be forced to
leave the organization,  ESPN reported .  E-mails and telephone messages left for Banner and team
spokesman Neal Gulkis were not immediately returned.  The news comes the same day that National Football League
owners approved Jimmy Haslam’s $1 billion purchase of the Browns
franchise from Randy Lerner. The sale will close Oct. 25; the
front office shake-up will happen before then, the cable network
reported, citing people it didn’t identify.  Holmgren, who coached the Green Bay Packers and Seattle
Seahawks, joined the team in January of 2010. Banner was with
the Eagles from 1994 until he stepped aside in June.  The Browns are 1-5 and in last place in the American
Football Conference’s North Division.  Cleveland  has gone to the
playoffs once since returning to the NFL in 1999 and hasn’t had
a winning season since 2007.  To contact the reporter on this story:
