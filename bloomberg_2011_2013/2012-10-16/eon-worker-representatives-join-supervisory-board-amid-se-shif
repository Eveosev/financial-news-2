EON AG (EOAN) , Germanyâ€™s biggest utility,
agreed with employee representatives on worker participation in
its works council and supervisory board once it becomes EON SE.  Employees from all European countries where EON operates
will be represented on the SE works council, the Dusseldorf-
based company said in a statement. Eugen Luha from  Romania ,
Willem Vis from the Netherlands, and Gabriele Gratz, Erhard Ott,
Klaus-Dieter Raschke and Eberhard Schomburg from Germany will
represent employees on the 12-member supervisory board.  Shareholders will be represented by Denise Kingsmill,
Ulrich Lehner, Rene Obermann, Karen de Segundo, Theo Siegert and
Werner Wenning, the company said previously.  EON AG will shift to an SE corporate structure before
Christmas, Georg Oppermann, a company spokesman, said today,
declining to be more specific. The change follows the example of
other German companies such as Allianz, BASF, Porsche and Puma.  To contact the reporter on this story:
