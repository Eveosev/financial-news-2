Atlantic hurricane Rafael passed
 Bermuda , while  Mexico ’s Baja California peninsula was lashed by
high winds and heavy rains from a tropical storm in the Pacific.  Rafael is about 310 miles (500 kilometers) northeast of
Bermuda, moving north-northeast at 33 miles per hour, the U.S.
National Hurricane Center said in an advisory at 5 a.m. Atlantic
Standard Time. Rafael was at Category 1 strength, the lowest
level on the five-step Saffir-Simpson scale and is forecast to
weaken as it turns northeast into the Atlantic.  Paul weakened into a tropical storm with top winds at 45
miles per hour as it churned in the Pacific 120 miles west-
northwest from Loreto, Mexico. It is also forecast to weaken as
it moves away from Mexico and heads northwest in the Pacific
sometime tomorrow, according to the center’s tracking maps.  Paul may bring 10 inches (25 centimeters) of rain as it
tracks northward up the peninsula. The rains may cause flash
floods and life-threatening mudslides, and the  storm surge  may
inundate the coastline near Sinaloa for the next two days.  Tropical Storm warnings are in place from  Santa Fe  to El
Pocito and San Evaristo to Bahia San Juan Bautista. A storm
watch is in effect from north of El Pocito to Punta Eugenia.
Tropical-storm force winds extend 140 miles from its center.  To contact the reporters on this story:
