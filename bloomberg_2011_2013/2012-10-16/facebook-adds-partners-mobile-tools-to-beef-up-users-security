Facebook Inc. (FB) , operator of the
world’s largest social network, is bolstering efforts to make
its services more secure with seven new partners and new tools
for mobile devices.  Facebook’s security services, which let users shut down
malicious pages, accounts and applications, now include tools
from about a dozen providers, including  AVG Technologies NV (AVG)  and
Webroot Inc., the company said in a  blog posting  about its “AV
Marketplace.”  Facebook is trying to attract new users and generate
revenue from existing members, while keeping its pages secure
from malicious software and hackers. With more than 1 billion
accounts, Facebook is responsible for one of the richest
repositories of personal data, and any large breach could damage
faith in its ability to protect private information.  “Effective security must be a cooperative effort,” the
company said. “By adding these new partners to the Facebook
Security family we are sure we can keep our community even
better protected from threats both on Facebook and elsewhere on
the Web.”  Facebook has also worked with hackers to uncover
vulnerabilities and repair any weaknesses in its network.  Shares in the Menlo Park, California-based  company  fell
less than 1 percent to $19.48 at the close in New York. The
stock has declined 49 percent from the $38 initial public
offering price in May.  To contact the reporter on this story:
