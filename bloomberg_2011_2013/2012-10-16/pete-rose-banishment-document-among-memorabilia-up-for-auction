The document that officially banned
Major League Baseball all-time hits leader  Pete Rose  from the
sport is up for auction.  The 1989  report  was Rose’s personal copy and is signed by
the 17-time All-Star as well as then-baseball Commissioner A. Bartlett Giamatti. It is among more than 600 lots being
auctioned online by Goldin Auctions from today through Nov. 17,
the company said on its website. The starting bid for the five-
page document is $100,000.  MLB banned Rose, 71, for gambling after investigator  John
Dowd  found he bet on the Cincinnati Reds during the 1985-87
seasons, while he was the team’s manager. The ruling made Rose,
whose  4,256 career hits  are the most in major-league history,
ineligible for the Hall of Fame. Giamatti died of a heart attack
a week after Rose’s banishment.  After 15 years of denying that he had bet on the sport,
Rose said in his 2004 book, “My Prison Without Bars,” that he
confessed to Commissioner  Bud Selig  while seeking to have the
ban lifted. He remains ineligible.  Other items  being auctioned include a 1934 baseball signed
by the New York Yankees’  Babe Ruth  and Lou Gehrig, a game-used
Ty Cobb bat and a 1980 Philadelphia Phillies World Series ring.  To contact the reporter on this story:
