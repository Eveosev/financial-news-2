Asian  stocks  rose, with the regional
benchmark index headed for the biggest gain in almost three
weeks, as exporters advanced after the U.S. reported better-
than-expected retail sales.  Samsung Electronics Co. (005930) , which gets a fifth of its sales in
the Americas, rose 2.3 percent in Seoul.  Mizuho Financial Group
Inc. (8411) , Japan’s third-largest bank by market value, gained 1.6
percent, pacing gains among lenders after Citigroup Inc.’s
profit beat estimates.  Softbank Corp. (9984)  jumped 9.6 percent after
Japan’s third-largest mobile-phone company agreed to acquire 70
percent of Sprint Nextel Corp. for $20.1 billion.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index gained 0.8 percent to 121.74 as
of 5:11 p.m. in  Tokyo , the biggest advance since Sept. 27. More
than two stocks rose for each that fell in the gauge, with all
of the index’s 10 industry groups climbed.  “It does feel like there’s some momentum there in the
economy,” said Matt Riordan, a portfolio manager who helps
manage about $6.5 billion in Sydney at Paradice Investment
Management Pty. “We’ve got a reasonable rebound. But the
problem is whether we will start seeing a recovery, particularly
out of  China .”  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index rebounded 11 percent from this
year’s low on June 4 through yesterday as stimulus measures in
Europe, the U.S., Japan and China boosted  market sentiment  amid
a global economic slowdown and Europe’s debt crisis. The Asian
benchmark traded at 12.8 times  estimated earnings  on average,
compared with 13.7 for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 12
for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  Nikkei, Kospi  Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average rose 1.4 percent and South
Korea’s Kospi Index added 0.8 percent.  Australia ’s S&P/ASX 200
gained 0.2 percent after minutes of the central bank’s Oct. 2
meeting showed policy makers saw scope for cutting borrowing
costs. New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index rose 0.6 percent in Wellington
even as the nation’s consumer prices slowed to the weakest pace
in more than 12 years.  Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index gained 0.3 percent and the
Shanghai Composite Index was little changed.  Taiwan’s Taiex
Index (TWSE)  added 0.7 percent.  Futures on the  S&P 500  advanced 0.1 percent today. The
gauge added 0.8 percent yesterday after Commerce Department data
showed retail sales advanced 1.1 percent last month, beating the
median estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg for a 0.8
percent increase.  Exporters to the U.S. rose. Samsung added 2.3 percent to
1.33 million won.  James Hardie Industries SE (JHX) , an Australian
building-materials supplier that gets about 67 percent of its
sales from the U.S., advanced 0.8 percent to A$9.11.  Li & Fung
Ltd. (494) , a maker of toys and clothes to Wal-Mart Stores Inc.,
increased 0.7 percent to HK$12.06 in  Hong Kong .  Banks Climb  Asian banks followed gains among U.S. banks after Citigroup
unexpectedly reported a third-quarter profit and a surge in
bond-trading revenue. Financial shares accounted for 24 percent
of the advance in the MSCI Asia Pacific Index today.  Mizuho Financial, Japan’s third-largest bank by market
value, gained 1.6 percent to 124 yen.  Commonwealth Bank of
Australia , the nation’s biggest lender by market value, rose 0.3
percent to A$57.09.  Softbank surged 9.6 percent to 2,485 yen in Tokyo, gaining
for the first time in nine trading days after announcing a deal
to buy Spring Nextel for $20.1 billion. The acquisition will be
funded by cash on hand and bridge financing, and Softbank won’t
issue new shares, President Masayoshi Son said yesterday. The
stock was the biggest gainer on the MSCI Asia Pacific Index.  Among shares that fell, Shimano Inc. dropped 3.5 percent to
5,200 yen. The Japanese maker of bicycle parts and fishing gear
fell after its rating was cut to neutral from outperform at
 Daiwa Securities Group Inc. (8601)   Kirin Outlook  Kirin Holdings Co. slid 2.4 percent to 1,009 yen in Tokyo
after the Japanese brewer slashed its 2015 sales forecast and
lowered its outlook for its Australian subsidiary.  Of the 14 companies on the MSCI Asia Pacific Index that
have posted quarterly results since Oct. 1 and for which
Bloomberg has estimates, eight missed analysts’ expectations
while six exceeded them, according to data compiled by  Bloomberg
News .  To contact the reporter on this story:
