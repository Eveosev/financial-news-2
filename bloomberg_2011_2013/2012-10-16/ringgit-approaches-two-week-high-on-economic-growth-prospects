Malaysia ’s ringgit climbed,
approaching a two-week high, on optimism Southeast Asia’s third-
largest economy can weather a global slowdown.  Gross domestic product will see “good growth” in the
third and fourth quarters, and full-year expansion will be about
5 percent, central bank Governor Zeti Akhtar Aziz said in an Oct.
14 interview in Tokyo. GDP increased 5.1 percent in 2011. U.S.
retail sales rose 1.1 percent in September after a revised 1.2
percent increase in August, the best back-to-back showing since
late 2010, according to a government report yesterday.  “We are quite positive on Malaysia’s economy, especially
in terms of domestic demand,” said Saktiandi Supaat, head of
foreign-exchange research at  Malayan Banking Bhd. (MAY)  in Singapore.
“There’s a bit of risk appetite. U.S. retail sales were better
than expected.”  The ringgit advanced 0.3 percent to 3.0512 per dollar as of
4:16 p.m. in  Kuala Lumpur , according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It touched 3.0444 on Oct. 5, the strongest level
since Sept. 18. One-month implied volatility, a measure of
exchange-rate swings used to price options, declined 37 basis
points to 6.30 percent.  Government bonds  were steady. The yield on the 3.492
percent notes due March 2020 held at 3.43 percent, according to
Bursa Malaysia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
