Greece  may quit the euro zone as
soon as 2013’s first half, said  Megan Greene , director of
European economics at Roubini Global Economics LLC.  Current austerity steps and likely retrenchment would
create a “decade of depression,” so the country may decide to
default on its debt and reissue the drachma, Greene said today
at a conference in London. A Greek exit is “very likely”
before the end of next year, she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
