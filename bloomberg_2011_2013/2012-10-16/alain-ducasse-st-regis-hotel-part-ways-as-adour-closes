Alain Ducasse , one of the world’s
most Michelin-starred chefs, is closing his top outpost in New
York. Again.  Nearly six years after the chef shuttered his hyper-
expensive eponymous restaurant at the Essex House hotel, his
second haute effort, Adour at the  St. Regis  in Midtown, will
close its doors as well.  Adour, in the space once occupied by Lespinasse, will cease
operating on November 17, according to a statement released
jointly Tuesday by Ducasse and the hotel.  A Ducasse spokeswoman, reached via phone, declined to say
why the restaurant was ending its five-year partnership with the
hotel.  “I consider Adour a qualified victory,” Frank Bruni  wrote 
in his three-star review for the  New York  Times in 2008. “It’s
not through-and-through rapturous, but it’s first-rate: polished
service, a knockout wine list, beautiful oil-poached cod,
gorgeous roasted lamb and exquisite desserts.”  Adour also was awarded three stars in a Bloomberg News
review in October, 2011.  The restaurant offers a $125 tasting menu, as well as a $90
tasting of vegetables. Expensive a la carte items are also
available, such as a $65 sole grenobloise.  The closing marks the second time this year that a lauded
French chef has left the New York fine dining scene.  Joel Robuchon  closed his L’Atelier at the Four Seasons Hotel in June.  Adour at the St. Regis in  Washington  will remain open, as
will Ducasse’s informal bistro, Benoit, also in Midtown
Manhattan.  Muse highlights include Patrick Cole on Harvard
 philanthropy  and  Hephzibah Anderson  on books.  To contact the writer of this column:
