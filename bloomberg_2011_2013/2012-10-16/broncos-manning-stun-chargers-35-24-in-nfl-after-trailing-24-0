Peyton Manning  completed the biggest
comeback of his 14-year National Football League career as the
 Denver Broncos  beat the  San Diego  Chargers 35-24 after trailing
24-0 at halftime.  Manning threw three touchdown passes and Denver scored
twice off turnovers by Chargers quarterback  Philip Rivers  during
the second half last night in San Diego. Rivers finished with
five turnovers.  Of the 443 teams that have trailed by 24 or more points at
halftime in the Super Bowl era, the Broncos became the fourth to
come back and win, according to ESPN. Manning’s biggest previous
comeback was when he rallied the  Indianapolis Colts  from a 21-
point deficit in a 38-35 victory against the  Tampa Bay
Buccaneers  on Oct. 6, 2003.  “It sure is special considering what was on the line at
this early point in the season,” Manning, 36, said in a
televised interview. “It was a pivotal game and we can really
build off this momentum.”  The Broncos, who improved to 3-3, matched the largest
comeback win for any road team in NFL history.  “There’s no speech that causes that turnaround,” Manning
said. “It’s simply a matter of will.’  The Chargers (3-3) took advantage of three Denver turnovers
to open a 24-0 halftime lead, with Rivers throwing touchdown
passes of 15 and 11 yards to tight end Antonio Gates.  San Diego scored 10 points in a 43-second span midway
through the first quarter after the Broncos had fumbles on punt
and kickoff returns. The Chargers pushed their lead to 17-0 as
Quentin Jammer intercepted a pass from Manning and returned it
80 yards for a touchdown, the longest by a Chargers player since
Willie Clark had an 83-yard interception return in 1996.  Slow Starters  The Broncos have been outscored 98-42 in the first half
this season, the biggest margin in the NFL.  Denver scored on its first possession of the second half,
as Manning tossed a 29-yard touchdown pass to  Demaryius Thomas .
Tony Carter then scooped up a fumble by Rivers and returned it
65 yards for a touchdown with 4:41 left in the third quarter to
pull Denver within 24-14.  The Broncos scored again less than two minutes into the
fourth quarter as Manning tossed a 7-yard touchdown pass to Eric Decker. Denver took its first lead shortly after an interception
by Rivers at midfield, as Manning tossed a 21-yard touchdown
pass to Brandon Stokley.  Rivers also threw interceptions on San Diego’s next two
possessions, with Chris Harris scoring on a 46-yard return with
2:05 remaining to extend Denver’s lead to 35-24.  The Broncos have now outscored their opponents 128-40 in
the second half of games this season.  ‘‘We have shown the ability to come back, and offense and
defense really did it together there in the second half,” said
Manning, who finished with 309 yards passing, completing 24 of
30 throws. He connected on 14 straight passes after halftime and
had only one incompletion in the second half.  To contact the reporter on this story:
