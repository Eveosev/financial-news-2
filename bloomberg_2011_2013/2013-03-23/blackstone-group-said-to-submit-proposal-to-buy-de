Blackstone Group LP submitted
a tentative offer late yesterday to acquire  Dell Inc. (DELL) , rivaling
a $24.4 billion offer from a group led by Silver Lake Management
LLC and company founder  Michael Dell , a person familiar with the
matter said.  The bid will commit Blackstone to hold takeover discussions
with the company, said the person, who declined to be identified
because the matter is private. Dell has until Tuesday to respond
to the offer, the person said.  Blackstone spokeswoman Christine Anderson declined to
comment.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
