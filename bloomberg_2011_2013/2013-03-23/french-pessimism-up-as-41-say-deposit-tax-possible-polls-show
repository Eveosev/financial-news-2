More than two-thirds of French
people are pessimistic about their country’s future, a poll
showed, jumping from February’s level.  The poll, conducted by CSA for BFM TV from March 5 through
March 21, questioned 3,015 people age 18 or older. Of the total,
68 percent said they were pessimistic about the future of French
society, an increase of 8 percentage points from February.  A separate survey found that 41 percent of French people
questioned said a tax on  bank deposits  would probably or
certainly be put in place in  France  if the economic situation
worsens.  The poll, by Ifop for Sud Ouest Dimanche, was conducted on
March 21 and 22 among 1,005 people age 18 or older and has a
margin of error of 1.4 percentage points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
