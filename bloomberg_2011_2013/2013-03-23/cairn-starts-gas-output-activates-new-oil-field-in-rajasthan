Cairn India  Ltd., which pumps crude
oil from the nation’s biggest deposit on land, started its first
commercial sales of natural gas from the area and activated a
new oil field to revive lower-than-expected output.  The explorer will sell as much as 5 million standard cubic
feet a day of gas from its blocks in Rajasthan initially,
according to a statement issued today. Cairn India also started
Aishwariya, an oil field in the western state, with a capacity
to produce 10,000 barrels a day, or 6 percent of its output from
the region.  Cairn India, acquired by billionaire Anil Agarwal’s  Vedanta
Resources Plc (VED)  for $8.67 billion in December 2011, is starting
new fields and seeking  oil deposits  to raise output by 71
percent to 300,000 barrels a day from the area. A slower-than-
expected production ramp up has driven down Cairn India 13
percent this year, making it the worst performer among the 10
companies in the  S&P BSE India Oil & Gas Index. (BSEOIL)   “The new production will help add to profit a bit,” said
Bhavesh Chauhan, a Mumbai-based analyst with Angel broking Ltd.,
who advises investors to “accumulate” the company’s shares.
“To revive the share price, Cairn will have to boost production
a lot more.”  Cairn India fell 0.1 percent to 277.30 rupees in Mumbai
trading on March 22, compared with a 0.3 percent decrease in the
benchmark  S&P BSE India Sensex (SENSEX)  index.  “Cairn India’s under-performance over the last six months
is likely to have been mainly on account of production ramp-up
concerns,” Arya Sen, a Mumbai-based analyst at Jefferies India
Pvt., said in a March 19 note.  In January, Cairn India confirmed lower well productivity
at the Bhagyam field and cut output guidance to as low as
200,000 barrels a day by March 31, 2014 from almost 240,000
barrels a day by Dec. 31, 2013, he said.  Mangala, Bhagyam  Cairn is producing about 175,000 barrels of crude a day
from Rajasthan, according to a March 18  presentation  on its
website. The Mangala field in the state is producing about
150,000 barrels a day and Bhagyam as much as 25,000 barrels
daily.  Sen upgraded the stock to buy from hold on March 19 because
the decline was overdone, according to the report. Production of
200,000 barrels a day and an oil price of $100 a barrel value
the company at 307 rupees a share, Sen said.  Forty seven of the 61  analysts  who rate Cairn India’s stock
recommend buying the shares and three selling them, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Cairn India start drilling its first new well in four years
to discover new oil pools in Rajasthan block, the company said
in a Feb. 25 stock exchange  filing . The company reported a 48
percent increase in  profit  to 33.4 billion rupees, or 16.5
rupees a share, in the quarter ended Dec. 31 after it increased
production from the Rajasthan block.  Royalty Payment  Vedanta Resources and unit  Sesa Goa Ltd. (SESA)  completed  buying  a
59 percent stake in Cairn India from Cairn Energy Plc and other
shareholders in December 2011. India’s cabinet approved the
takeover on the condition the cost of developing the Rajasthan
field would include royalty, which could be recovered from sales.
 Oil & Natural Gas Corp. (ONGC) , Cairn India’s partner with a 30 percent
stake in the Rajasthan block, paid the entire royalty since
production started in August 2009.  Cairn currently produces 30 million cubic feet of gas daily
from the field, and uses much of that to produce power for the
Rajasthan project, according to the statement. The company said
it plans to spend 60 billion rupees ($1 billion) in the state in
its fiscal 2014 year.  Cairn  India ’s earnings are helping cut losses for iron-ore
miner Sesa Goa after a court-ordered extraction ban last year.  Production Goal  In January, the government approved Cairn India’s plan to
raise production from the block in Barmer in Rajasthan state to
300,000 barrels a day, equivalent to about 40 percent of India’s
current  output . To reach that target, the company will need to
find more oil in the area, Chief Executive Officer P. Elango
said last month. The block has proved reserves of 1 billion
barrels.  Cairn India’s operating expenses in the Rajasthan block,
including the cost of transporting crude to the coast for sale
to refineries, is about $3 a barrel, Elango said. The company
plans to start a project that will pump chemicals into producing
 oil wells  to help flush out hard-to-extract crude from the
reservoir in the year starting April 1, 2014. The operating cost
to produce the additional crude will be in a range of $8 to $12
a barrel, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
