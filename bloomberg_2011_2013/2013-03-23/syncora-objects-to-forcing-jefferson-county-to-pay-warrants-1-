Syncora Guarantee Inc. objected to
a request on behalf of creditors of Jefferson County, Alabama,
that would force the bankrupt county to make immediate payment
on about $792 million of its sewer warrants.  Syncora, a bond insurer, said in a filing yesterday in U.S.
Bankruptcy Court in Birmingham that a group of creditors, who
bought the warrants at a discount and who have refused to
forbear from receiving principle payments on warrants that can
be mandatorily redeemed, are trying to exert pressure on the
company and other insurers of the bonds.  “Disturbing the status quo, and trying to coerce the
insurers to suffer near-term exposure that would otherwise be
resolved pursuant to a plan of adjustment will do nothing for
achieving consensus,” Syncora said in the filing.  The  Bank of New York Mellon Corp. , the trustee for
Jefferson County’s $3.2 billion in sewer bonds, last month
sought a judge’s ruling it’s entitled to seek accelerated
payment on the county’s debt.  The bank is responsible for collecting payments from the
bankrupt county and passing them on to investors. It informed
warrant holders on Feb. 1 that it would suspend payments on at
least part of the $3.2 billion of debt from the county’s
insolvent sewage system after some creditors no longer consented
to a payment formula.  The case is In re Jefferson County, 11-05736, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Northern District of Alabama (Birmingham).  To contact the reporter on this story:
