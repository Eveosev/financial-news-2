The  World Cup  soccer qualifying
match between  Northern Ireland  and Russia was postponed for a
second day because of poor weather in Belfast.  The match was first called off last night because of snow
and freezing conditions at Windsor Park and rescheduled for 3
p.m. today. Referee Tom Hagen again postponed the game about
four hours before the kickoff because of icy areas on the field,
according to a  statement  on the website of world soccer
governing body FIFA.  The match will be rescheduled on a later date in the
international calendar, FIFA said. Northern Ireland hosts  Israel 
in its next qualifying game on March 26.  Russia has won all four of its qualifiers to lead six-team
European Group F with 12 points, nine more than Northern Ireland
in fourth place. The group winner qualifies for the 2014 World
Cup in Brazil, with the second-place team entering a playoff.  Heavy snow and sleet has affected todayâ€™s soccer schedule
across the U.K., postponing games in the lower leagues in
England, Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales.  To contact the reporter on this story:
