Estonian President Toomas Hendrik Ilves said the euro is a “great currency” and the country’s
decision to adopt it in 2011 has only benefited the economy.  “It’s given investor confidence,” Ilves said today in an
interview at a meeting of European leaders in  Finland . “If
you’re willing to follow the rules, it’s a great currency.”  Ilves supports neighboring  Latvia ’s application to join the
euro at the start of next year, while the European Commission is
set to issue its recommendation in late May or early June.
 Estonia  imposed austerity measures, enduring one of the world’s
worst recessions following the global financial crisis.  “I’m doing everything to support Latvia to join,” he
said. “We need more countries in the euro zone that take their
finances seriously. We’ll start artificially heating up the
economy if we start expanding now.”  Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Finland plan to build a
regional terminal for liquefied natural gas with European Union
funding as a way to cut reliance on  Russia ’s OAO Gazprom.  “We pay the second-highest gas prices in Europe after
Lithuania, which is kind of strange,” he said. “Having
competition is what gives you fair prices.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
