A bomb found in a car by security
forces in County Fermanagh, Northern Ireland, was made safe, the
British Broadcasting Corp. reported, citing police.  The device, found yesterday in an abandoned vehicle on the
Derrylin Road outside Enniskillen, may have been destined for a
police station in Lisnaskea, the BBC cited District Commander
Pauline Shields as saying. No one was hurt, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
