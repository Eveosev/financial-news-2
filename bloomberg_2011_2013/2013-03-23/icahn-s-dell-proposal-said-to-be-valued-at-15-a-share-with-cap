(Corrects company name in first paragraph.)  Carl Icahn  proposed to buy  Dell
Inc. (DELL)  in a deal that would value the company at $15 a share,
including a cap, according to two people with knowledge of the
matter.  The proposal would also give Dell shareholders the option
of holding onto their stock, said the people, who asked not to
be identified because the information is private.  To contact the reporter on this story:
