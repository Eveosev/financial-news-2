Clint Dempsey scored to give the
U.S. a 1-0 victory against visiting Costa Rica in a World Cup
soccer qualifier played in blizzard conditions in Colorado.  Dempsey scored in the 16th minute on the snow-covered,
frozen field last night at Dick’s Sporting Goods Park in
Commerce City, outside Denver. The grounds crew spent the game
shoveling the lines clear of snow.  “The good thing was we were able to get a goal early,”
Dempsey said in a televised interview. “To qualify for a World
Cup is never easy. We were able to come together when we needed
to.”  The U.S., which came into the game in last place in its
group with no points, earned three points to put the team in
second place, one point behind Honduras. Panama, Mexico and
Jamaica each have two points and Costa Rica has one point in the
North, Central America and Caribbean group.  The U.S. travels to Mexico on March 26 for its next match.  “We’ll take the confidence of the three points and go down
there and try to shake them up,” Dempsey said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
