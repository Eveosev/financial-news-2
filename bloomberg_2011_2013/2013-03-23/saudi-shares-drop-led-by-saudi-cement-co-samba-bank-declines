Saudi Arabia’s benchmark stock
index snapped a two-day advance, led by petrochemicals and
banks.  The  Tadawul All Share Index (SASEIDX)  lost less than 0.1 percent to
7,094.18 at the 3:30 p.m. close in Riyadh.  Saudi Arabian Cement
Co. (SACCO) , Saudi Arabia’s second-biggest maker of building materials
by market value, declined to the lowest level in three months,
while Samba Financial Group, the second-largest lender in the
kingdom, fell to the lowest since March 10. The Arab world’s
biggest stock exchange has added 4.3 percent this year.  “Today we witnessed a subdued trading with a low range and
a low volume in a minor decline due to ex-cash dividends of
Samba and Saudi Cement,” Mohammed Al-Omran, a financial analyst
and president of the Gulf Center for Financial Consultancy in
Riyadh, said by e-mail.  The Saudi index is in an “up trend” and may rise above
7,100 by the end of the week due to a positive sentiment among
investors toward expected first-quarter results, he said.  Samba Financial Group (SAMBA)  slid 0.1 percent to 44.2 riyals.
Saudi  Arabian Cement (ARCCO)  Co. dropped 5 percent to 92.75 riyals  Saudi Arabia’s stock exchange is the only Persian Gulf
