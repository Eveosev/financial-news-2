Former  New York Knicks  and New
Jersey Nets guard Ray Williams died yesterday at the age of 58.  The Knicks confirmed Williams’s death on their website
without providing details.  A first-round selection in the 1977 National Basketball
Association draft by the Knicks from the University of
Minnesota, Williams spent the initial four of his 10 seasons in
New York. He also played for the Nets, the Kansas City Kings,
the  Boston Celtics , the  Atlanta Hawks  and the San Antonio Spurs
before retiring after the 1986-87 season.  The 6-foot-3 Williams played in 655 NBA games, averaging
15.5 points and 5.8 assists per contest.  “Ray was probably my favorite college teammate,” Houston
Rockets coach Kevin McHale, who played with Williams at
 Minnesota  and with the Celtics, said on the club’s website. “I
came in as a rookie and Ray took me under his wing. We played
ball all the time. We were two guys that just loved to play.”  The New York Daily News reported on March 6 that Williams
was being treated at New York’s Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer
Center for an undisclosed illness. The newspaper also said
doctors found a large tumor in Williams’s colon after he became
the first ex-player to take advantage of a free colon-cancer
screening offered through the NBA Retired Players Association.  Williams was homeless and living in Florida in a 1992 Buick
as recently as two years ago, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
