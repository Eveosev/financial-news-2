Exxaro Resources Ltd. (EXX) , South
Africa’s second-biggest coal miner, said employees agreed to
return to work on March 25 after more than two weeks of an
unauthorized strike at its facilities.  The Pretoria-based company will pay each worker at least
2,800 rand ($301) as an incentive to end the stoppage at six of
its mines, it said in an e-mailed statement today. Talks with
the  National Union of Mineworkers  broke down on March 19.  The deal “has averted the possible negative effect that a
prolonged strike could have had on Eskom’s electricity
generation and the country’s economy,” the company said.  Exxaro supplies all the power-station coal it mines to
South African electricity utility Eskom Holdings SOC Ltd., which
relies the fuel for 80 percent of generation. Labor unrest in
 Africa ’s largest economy spread from Lonmin Plc’s Marikana
operations in August, where 44 people died including 34 shot by
police, to gold, coal and iron-ore mines. Truck drivers and
farmworkers also went on strike demanding higher wages.  To contact the reporter on this story:
