Half-centuries from Murali Vijay
and Cheteshwar Pujara helped  India  take a four-run lead over
 Australia  on day two of the final cricket Test in Delhi.  Vijay scored 57 and Pujara had 52 as India reached 266-8 at
stumps after bowling Australia out for 262. Nathan Lyon is 5-94
for the visitors, who are trying to avoid being swept in a four-
match series for the first time since 1970.  Bhuvneshwar Kumar will resume on 10 for India, which has
never won four Tests in a series.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
