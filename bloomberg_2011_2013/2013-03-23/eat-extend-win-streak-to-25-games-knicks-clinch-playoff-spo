LeBron James scored 29 points to
help the Miami Heat defeat the Detroit Pistons 103-89 and extend
their winning streak to 25 games, while the  New York  Knicks
clinched a playoff berth with a 99-94 victory at the Toronto
Raptors.  The Heat, who have the second-longest winning streak in
National Basketball Association history, are within eight
victories of matching the record of 33 straight wins by the
1971-72 Los Angeles Lakers.  The Heat, trailing by as many as 11 points in the first
half, took a 67-65 lead when James hit a 3-pointer with two
minutes, 47 seconds left in the third quarter at Miami’s
AmericanAirlines Arena.  “It doesn’t matter who we’re playing. This time of year,
it’s going to be a dangerous team,” Heat coach Erik Spoelstra
told reporters. “It’s going to be a team absolutely urgent,
desperate for a playoff position or a team with nothing to lose,
no pressure. Either way, you have to impose your will.”  Dwyane Wade had 19 points and Mario Chalmers and Shane Battier each added 11 for the Heat, who handed the Pistons their
10th straight loss.  Greg Monroe scored 23 points, and Jose Calderon and Kyle
Singer each contributed 18 points for the Pistons, who had a
54-51 halftime advantage.  The Heat lead the Eastern Conference with an NBA-best
record of 54-14. The San Antonio Spurs improved to 53-16, best
in the Western Conference, with a 104-97 win in overtime against
the visiting Utah Jazz.  Carmelo Anthony had 37 points for the Knicks, who captured
their third straight playoff berth the day after the Brooklyn
Nets also secured a postseason spot. Kenyon Martin added 19 and
J.R. Smith scored 14 points at Air Canada Centre in Toronto.  Alan Anderson had 35 points and DeMar DeRozan added 18  for
the Raptors, who trailed 50-37 at the half.  The Knicks (41-26) lead the Eastern Conference’s Atlantic
division by 1 1/2 games over the Nets (40-28).  To contact the reporter on this story:
