Georgetown University became the
highest-ranked team to lose in the 2013 men’s college basketball
national tournament, falling 78-68 to 15th-seeded Florida Gulf
Coast University.  The Hoyas’ defeat marked the seventh time since 1985 that a
regional No. 2 seed had lost its opening game at the National
Collegiate Athletic Association tournament.  FGCU, which was established as a school in 1991, is in its
second year of postseason eligibility in college basketball’s
top division. The Eagles are making their tournament debut.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
