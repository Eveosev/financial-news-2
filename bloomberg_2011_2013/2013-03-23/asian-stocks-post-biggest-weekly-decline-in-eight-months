Asian stocks fell, with the
regional benchmark index posting the biggest weekly drop in
seven months, as Cyprus struggled to prevent a financial
collapse, stoking concern Europe’s debt crisis is intensifying.  HSBC Holdings Plc (5) , Europe’s biggest lender, slid 1.9
percent in Hong Kong.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the world’s biggest
mining company, lost 6 percent in Sydney as commodities fell
amid concern Europe’s crisis will hinder global growth.  Toyota
Motor Corp. (7203) , the world’s largest carmaker, lost 2.8 percent
after Japan’s new central bank governor stopped short of
announcing new stimulus.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index fell 1.7 percent to 134.31 this
week, the biggest weekly decline since the period ended Aug. 31,
amid concern that an unprecedented levy on bank deposits in
Cyprus may be a sign of deepening crisis in Europe.  “Nobody knows what’s going to happen next,”  said Grace Tam, Hong Kong-based global market strategist at JPMorgan Asset
Management Ltd., which oversees about $1.3 trillion globally.
“Cyprus can damp market sentiment in the short term but it’s
something we’ve already seen happening in Europe, so we are not
fairly concerned.”  Relative Value  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  rallied 3.8 percent this year
as improving economic data from the U.S. and speculation that
Japan will deploy more stimulus countered concern China will
move to cool its property market. Asia’s benchmark trades at
14.9 times average estimated earnings, compared with 14.1 for
the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  and 12.7 for the  Stoxx Europe
600 Index (SXXP) , according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The Topix Index, Japan’s broadest share gauge, fell 1.2
percent this week even after reaching the highest close since
October 2008 on March 21. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index dropped
3 percent this week, the biggest weekly drop since May.
Singapore’s Straits Times Index slid 0.8 percent. South Korea’s
 Kospi Index (KOSPI)  declined 1.9 percent.  Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index fell 1.9 percent. The Shanghai
Composite Index, which tracks the bigger of China’s stock
exchanges, rose 2.2 percent as a private survey on March 21
showed Chinese manufacturing may expand faster than estimated.
India’s  S&P BSE Sensex (SENSEX)  dropped 3.6 percent amid concern the
withdrawal of the government’s biggest partner from the ruling
alliance may jeopardize economic reforms.  Cyprus Bailout  Asian stocks fell after the  European Central Bank  said it
may cut off Cyprus banks from emergency funds as the island
nation struggles to stave off financial collapse after lawmakers
rejected a bank deposit levy as a condition for a euro-zone
rescue. Cyprus’ attempt to secure a bailout from Russia was
rebuffed yesterday.  Resource stocks and companies that do business in Europe
fell. HSBC slid 1.9 percent to HK$83.10.  Samsung Electronics
Co. (005930) , a consumer-electronics exporter, dropped 1.7 percent to
1.455 million won in Seoul.  BHP Billiton  slid 6 percent to A$33.43, the biggest weekly
decline since the period ended May 18.  Rio Tinto Group (RIO) ,
Australia’s second-largest miner by market value, slumped 5.5
percent to A$57.92.  BOJ Governor  Japanese shares fell after new Bank of Japan Governor
Haruhiko Kuroda on March 21 failed to outline any immediate
increase to stimulus in his first press conference. He restated
that he will do whatever it takes to achieve a 2 percent
inflation target and that he may bring forward open-ended asset
purchases, though he made no concrete commitments.  Toyota dropped 2.8 percent to 4,880 yen.  Nissan Motor Co. (7201) ,
Japan’s third-largest carmaker by market value, lost 4 percent

Co. jumped 16 percent to HK$23.50 in  Hong Kong . The utility
reported on March 18 that full-year net income rose 68 percent
to HK$7.48 billion ($964 million). That compared with an HK$6.8
billion average estimate by 14 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Guangzhou R&F Properties Co. jumped 13 percent to HK$13.08
in Hong Kong after the homebuilder in the Southern Chinese city
posted full-year earnings that beat estimates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
