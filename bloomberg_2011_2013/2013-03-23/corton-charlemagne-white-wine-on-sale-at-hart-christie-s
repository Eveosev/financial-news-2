Corton-Charlemagne white wines from
the past 20 years are among Burgundies leading auctions by
Christie’s International Plc and Hart Davis Hart Wine Co. this
month and next, according to their online catalogs.  A 12-bottle lot of Corton-Charlemagne Coche-Dury 2005
carries an upper estimate of $28,000 at Hart’s Chicago sale
today, while older vintages of Corton-Charlemagne Bonneau de
Martray dating from 1990, 1992 and 1997 feature in mixed lots at
a Christie’s auction in Amsterdam next month.  White Burgundies have benefited from increased investor
demand for wines from the region in the past four months, as the
London-based Liv-ex Fine Wine 50 Index has rallied 11 percent
since November. Bordeaux vintages, which were sold off during
the 16-month market slump starting in July 2011, have started to
recover again this year.  “The fine wine market has entered a period of rising
prices,”  Chris Smith , investment manager at the Wine Investment
Fund in London, said in a market commentary this month. Gains on
Liv-ex this year “allay our concerns that the upturn which
began in December may have been mostly seasonal,” he said.  The fund, which has about $50 million under management, is
focused on Bordeaux, partly because the larger wine production
from that region’s estates makes them easier to trade.  Among prominent white Burgundy lots in recent auctions, six
bottles of Montrachet 1993 Domaine de la Romanee-Conti Grand Cru
Burgundy fetched top price at a  Sotheby’s (BID)  sale in London last
month, selling for 21,150 pounds ($32,060).  Today’s  Hart  sale also contains 175 lots of Domaine de la
Romanee-Conti spanning 33 vintages from 1966 onwards, including
three bottles of 1999 Romanee-Conti DRC estimated to fetch as
much as $35,000 and another three-bottle lot of the 1991 vintage
with a top estimate of $32,000.  Here is a list of global wine auctions scheduled so far
this year. Dates may be subject to revision, and links are to
