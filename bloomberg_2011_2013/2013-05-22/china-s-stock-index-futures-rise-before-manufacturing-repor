Most  Chinese stocks  fell as declines
by technology shares and power producers overshadowed gains
among property and consumer-staples companies. Price swings on
the  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  dropped to a five-month low before
the release of a manufacturing gauge tomorrow.  Huaneng Power International Inc. (902)  plunged 5.8 percent after
Citigroup Inc. said China may cut the on-grid tariff for coal-fired  power plants . Sanan Optoelectronics Co. sank for the first
time in 11 days, while the ChiNext index of start-up companies
slumped 3.2 percent.  China Vanke Co. (000002)  led gains for real-estate
companies as Deutsche Bank AG said earnings of the largest
developers are stable. Kweichow Moutai Co., China’s biggest
liquor maker, climbed 2.3 percent.  Five stocks declined for every four that rose in the
Shanghai Composite Index, which dropped 0.1 percent to 2,302.40
at the close. A preliminary reading for a May purchasing
managers’ index from HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics due
tomorrow will probably be 50.4, unchanged from a month earlier,
the median estimate of 13 analysts in a Bloomberg survey. A
reading above 50 indicates expansion.  “The market is waiting for the flash PMI, which will
provide a rough picture of how the economy is faring,” said Wei Wei, an analyst at West China Securities Co. in  Shanghai . “Some
investors believe growth will be stabilizing.”  The Shanghai Composite has rebounded 5.9 percent since May
2. It trades at 9.7 times 12-month projected earnings, the
highest since March 26,  data  compiled by Bloomberg show. The
gauge’s 50-day  volatility  dropped to 16.6 today, the lowest
level since Dec. 13, while trading volumes in the index were 43
percent higher than the 30-day average, the data showed.  Utilities Drop  The CSI 300 Index added 0.1 percent to 2,618.03.  Hong Kong’s Hang Seng China Enterprises Index lost 0.3
percent as it resumed trade following a rainstorm that forced
the cancellation of the city’s morning session. The Bloomberg
China-US 55 Index, the measure of the most-traded U.S.-listed
Chinese companies, declined 1 percent yesterday. The iShares
FTSE China 25 Index Fund dropped 0.7 percent.  Huaneng Power, the listed unit of China’s largest power
group, tumbled 5.8 percent to 6.50  yuan . Citigroup downgraded
the Hong Kong-listed stock to neutral from buy because China may
cut the on-grid tariff in the third quarter by 2 percent,
analysts led by Pierre Lau wrote in a note.  Sanan Optoelectronics led declines for technology
companies, sliding 2.6 percent to 19.17 yuan and paring this
month’s rally to 36 percent.  Leshi Internet Information &
Technology Co. (300104)  paced declines for Shenzhen-listed ChiNext
stocks, falling 5.5 percent to 45.07 yuan.  Tighter Liquidity  Investors will rotate out of smaller companies and into
larger stocks as liquidity tightens, Chen Li, the UBS AG
strategist who predicted the tumble in China’s smallest shares
two years ago, said in a May 9 phone interview.  The gap between yields on China’s short- and long-term debt
is the tightest in 17 months as the central bank drains cash
from the financial system and Premier  Li Keqiang  limits stimulus
amid an economic slowdown.  “The curve has been flattening because the central bank’s
recent tightening measures have made it difficult for companies
to raise enough funds from the  bond market , which may create
some drag on the economy,” said  Jiang Chao , a bond analyst in
Shanghai at Haitong Securities Co., the nation’s second-biggest
listed brokerage.  Developers’ Earnings  Vanke, the nation’s biggest listed property developer, rose
0.6 percent to 12.10 yuan.  Poly Real Estate Group Co. (600048) , the
second biggest, added 0.7 percent to 12.40 yuan.  China’s property prices will rise “moderately” the rest
of the year and earnings of large developers are “quite
stable,”  Ma Jun , chief economist for  Greater China  at Deutsche
Bank, said at a press conference in Singapore today.  A measure of consumer-staples stocks in the CSI 300
advanced 1.1 percent, the most among the 10 industry groups.
Kweichow Moutai added 2.3 percent to 199.47 yuan.  Wuliangye
Yibin Co. (000858) , the second largest, rose 3.1 percent to 24.22 yuan.  Fortune CLSA Securities Ltd. boosted its share-price
forecast for Moutai to 237.39 yuan and increased its 2013 net-profit estimate by 2.3 percent, citing recovering demand,
according to a report from analysts Katharine Song and Heather
Hsu dated May 20.  Risen Energy Co. (300118)  led a rally for solar stocks after Yingli
Green Energy Holding Co. said yesterday first-quarter shipments
will exceed its previous forecast, boosting the industry
prospects. The stock jumped 6 percent to 6.04 yuan. EGing
Photovoltaic Technology Co. added 3.5 percent to 10.14 yuan.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
