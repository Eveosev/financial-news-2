A new type of  flu vaccine  developed
at the U.S.  National Institutes of Health  outperformed existing
products in animal tests, possibly paving the way for a new
generation of vaccines.  Researchers led by Gary Nabel, the former director of the
Vaccine Research Center at the NIH’s  National Institute of
Allergy and  Infectious Diseases , fused a protein called
hemagglutinin, on the surface of the virus, to ferritin, another
protein that carries iron in the blood, creating a new type of
nanoparticle that elicited broader and more potent immunity than
products sold by Sanofi and  Novartis AG (NOVN) , according to the study,
published online today in the journal  Nature .  The result may point the way toward a so-called universal
vaccine that can be used against different viruses even as they
mutate to evade the immune system, said Nabel, who was last year
 appointed  chief scientific officer at Paris-based  Sanofi (SAN) , one of
the world’s biggest vaccine makers.  The experimental product is “taking us probably several
steps down the road towards the universal flu vaccine,” Nabel
said in a telephone interview yesterday. It also “may have more
diverse applications. We don’t have to limit ourselves to
influenza.”  Flu Deaths  Flu viruses can mutate rapidly, creating threats faster
than current technology makes new vaccines. Between 1976 and
2006, flu caused annual deaths ranging from a low of about 3,000
to a high of about 49,000, according to estimates by the U.S.
 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  in Atlanta. That
costs the federal government more than $10 billion annually,
according to a 2009  report  from the  U.S. Chamber of Commerce .  Worldwide, flu causes between 250,000 and 500,000
fatalities every year, according to the Geneva-based  World
Health Organization . In  China  this year, a new type of  bird flu 
known as H7N9 has sickened at least 131 people and killed 36 of
them, according to the WHO.  Sanofi’s Fluzone shot was used in the study, as well as
vaccine boosters made by  Sigma-Aldrich Corp. (SIAL)  and Novartis. The
experimental vaccine, whose intellectual property belongs to the
NIH, may be up for grabs.  “It needs to get into people,” Nabel said. It’s up to the
NIH to decide “to which party or parties they want to license
it. I don’t think the final disposition has been settled.”  ‘Nice Synergies’  With Sanofi, there “could be nice synergies” for the
product’s development, Nabel said, adding that as a former NIH
employee he wouldn’t be able to himself negotiate an agreement
between Sanofi and the NIH. “Obviously I will help whoever
wants to advance this forward to humans,” he said.  The synthetic nanoparticle vaccine, which was tested on
mice and ferrets, works by stimulating the production of
neutralizing antibodies that latch on to parts of the virus that
are common to different strains. Given that it’s made entirely
from recombinant ingredients, it’s safer to make than standard
vaccines, which are produced by growing the virus in eggs or
cultured cells, according to a Nature press release.  “This is a very encouraging study of a new approach to
making vaccines and shows very clearly this works very well with
ferrets against different strains of flu,” Adam Finn, a
professor of pediatrics at the  University of Bristol Medical
School  in  England , said in a separate statement. “Further
studies will be needed to find out whether humans get similar
protection and these are likely to take several years.”  Vaccines such as Fluzone are usually created each year from
inactivated viruses of three different strains. They work best
against those strains and need to be replaced after a year. A
universal vaccine could provide protection against most or all
flu strains for decades.  “The goal for all influenza vaccine researchers right now
is to develop that universal vaccine,” Nabel said. “Without a
question, that’s one of the most urgent public health needs.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
