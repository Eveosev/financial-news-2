Brazil ’s  inflation  slowed more than
forecast in May, supporting central bank President Alexandre
Tombini’s view price increases will moderate in coming months.  Consumer prices as measured by the IPCA-15  price index  rose
0.46 percent, the national statistics agency said in a report
published on its website today. That was less than the median
forecast of 0.49 percent from 35 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg. Annual  inflation  slowed to 6.46 percent, within the
2.5 percent to 6.5 percent target range, from 6.51 percent in
mid-April.  The central bank, which raised the benchmark interest rate
from a record low last month, will continue to increase
borrowing costs this month in a bid to slow inflation that has
been above the 4.5 percent target for almost three years.
Tombini pledged yesterday to do whatever it takes to ensure
consumer price increases will start easing in the second half of
the year.  Swap rates on the contract maturing in 2014, the most
traded in  Sao Paulo  today, fell 3 basis points, or 0.03
percentage point, to 8.1 percent at 9:01 a.m. local time.
Investors pared bets after the inflation report that the central
bank will intensify the pace of  interest rate  increases after
raising it by a quarter-point to 7.5 percent on April 17.  The real strengthened 0.1 percent to 2.0385  per  U.S.
dollar .  “The central bank is vigilant and will do what’s necessary
in a timely fashion to make inflation decline in the second half
and to ensure this trend will last in the coming years,”
Tombini told members of Congress in Brasilia yesterday,
repeating language used last week in Rio de Janeiro.  Economists in the latest central bank survey forecast 5.8
percent inflation and 2.98 percent economic growth in 2013,
marking the first time the gross domestic product outlook has
dropped below 3 percent. The economists forecast the benchmark
rate at 8.25 percent at year-end.  To contact the reporter on this story:
