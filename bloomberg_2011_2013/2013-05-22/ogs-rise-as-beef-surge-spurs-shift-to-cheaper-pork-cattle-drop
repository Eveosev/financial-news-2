Hog futures climbed for the third
straight session on speculation that record-high U.S. beef
prices will encourage consumers to switch to cheaper pork.
Cattle declined.  Wholesale-beef prices are up 7.3 percent in May, heading
for the biggest monthly rally in more than a year, to $2.1066 a
pound yesterday, the highest since at least 2004, U.S.
Department of Agriculture data show. That’s more than twice the
cost of wholesale  pork , which yesterday reached 93.69 cents a
pound, the highest since August.  Pork “prices, when you compare it to poultry and beef, are
relatively cheap,” Mark Schultz, a chief analyst with Northstar
Commodity Investment Co. in  Minneapolis , said in a telephone
interview. “That has opportunity to see a little bit more
demand in here.”  Hog futures for July settlement rose 0.5 percent to 92.225
cents a pound at 10:47 a.m. on the  Chicago  Mercantile Exchange.
The price through yesterday gained 7 percent this year.  Cattle futures for August delivery slid 0.5 percent to
$1.198 a pound in Chicago, the first decline this week. Prices
through yesterday fell 9 percent this year.  Feeder-cattle futures for August settlement dropped 0.6
percent to $1.4565 a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
