The  Crown Estate , owner of the U.K.
seabed, plans to lease more sites for developers of wave and
tidal energy generators to help accelerate development as the
industry moves closer toward commercialization.  The estate will lease sites for developers of marine energy
technology from September to test and demonstrate their systems,
it said today in an e-mailed statement. It will spur development
of the technology and lower costs, Huub den Rooijen, head of
offshore wind for the  Crown Estate , said in the statement.  It will work with marine planning companies to define zones
for test and demonstration projects and invite private and
public organizations to manage them and sublet project sites.  While no commercial projects are now operating, energy from
waves and tides has the potential to meet as much as 20 percent
of current U.K. electricity demand by 2020, the government says.
Aquamarine Power Ltd., a wave technology producer, today said it
won full consent from the Scottish government to install a 40-megawatt project off the coast of Lewis in the northwest. The
plant will be able to provide power to as many as 30,000 homes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
