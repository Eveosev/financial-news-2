European Central Bank Executive Board
member Peter Praet said the ECB could introduce new approaches
to  monetary policy  as long as it adheres to its primary goal of
 price stability .  The Frankfurt-based central bank can “flank and support”
necessary steps to be taken in other policy domains, Praet said
yesterday in a speech in  Washington . “Monetary policy will
continue employing its existing instruments and if necessary to
expand its instrument set within the safeguards established by
its strategy” to maintain price stability, he said.  The ECB cut its  benchmark interest rate  to a record low of
0.5 percent on May 2 and President  Mario Draghi  said he stands
ready to act further if the economic outlook deteriorates.
Policy makers are also looking at options to rekindle the market
for asset-backed securities and stimulate lending to small
companies.  “The ECB’s strategy has to combine two main attributes,”
Praet said. “It must be sufficiently flexible to adjust its
policy conduct to the specific challenges at hand. And it must
be sufficiently binding to anchor expectations and build central
bank credibility.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
