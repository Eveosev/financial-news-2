Cia. Cervecerias Unidas SA (CCU) ,  Chile ’s
largest brewer, fell to a one-month low after Bank of America
Corp. recommended selling the stock amid competition from
 Brazil ’s Cia. de Bebidas das Americas, known as AmBev.  CCU, which is controlled by the billionaire Luksic family,
Chile’s richest, dropped 2.2 percent to 7,370 pesos at 1:42 p.m.
in Santiago, the lowest on a closing basis since April 15. The
stock was the worst performer on the benchmark Chilean Ipsa
index, which advanced 0.4 percent.  Bank of America said yesterday in an e-mailed report that
it reinstated coverage of CCU with the equivalent of a sell
rating and a price target of 8,200 pesos, or $35 per American
depositary receipt. The Chilean market was closed yesterday for
a local holiday.  CCU, the Santiago-based maker of Cristal and Escudo beers,
has watched its share of the Chilean market reduced by 7
percentage points to 79 percent by the end of 2012, Bank of
America said. AmBev has increased its market share to 14 percent
from 12 percent, according to Bank of America.  “AmBev’s aggressive pricing strategy has been one of the
main reasons for CCU’s market-share loss and margin
contraction,” Bank of America analysts Fernando Ferreira and
Isabella Simonato wrote in the report. Sao Paulo-based AmBev’s
main brand in Chile is Brahma, according to the report.  AmBev probably won’t renew CCU’s license to produce and
distribute the Budweiser brand in Chile in 2015 and  Argentina  in
2025, the analysts wrote. AmBev’s controlling shareholder,
 Anheuser-Busch InBev NV (ABI) , owns the Budweiser brand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
