Axa Private Equity, a Paris-based
buyout firm, is weighing a sale of French food ingredients maker
Diana Group, which is valued at more than 1 billion euros ($1.3
billion), according to three people familiar with the matter.  The French supplier of natural ingredients for food and
pet-food manufacturers will probably attract both strategic and
private-equity interest, said the people, who asked not to be
identified because talks are private. No final decision has been
made on the sale, they said.  Axa Private Equity bought the company, based in Vannes,
 France , from European buyout firm Cognetas LLP for 710 million
euros in 2007.  Diana Group , which was founded in 1990,
manufactures products such as crispy apricot or strawberry
pieces used in cereal bars, carrot liquid to color lollipops
strawberry red, and wine extracts for marinades. It also
produces ingredients for the pharmaceutical and cosmetics
industries.  A representative for Axa Private Equity declined to
comment. A spokeswoman for Diana Group declined to comment.  The company employs more than 1,500 staff in 22 countries
and had revenue of 392 million euros in 2011, according to its
 website . It makes about 50 percent of its revenue outside
Europe, according to a press release from Axa Private Equity in
November.  To contact the reporters on this story:
