Vano Merabishvili, a former premier
and ally of Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili was sentenced
to two months in pre-trial detention after being charged with
abuse of office and embezzlement.  Merabishvili was denied bail in the decision by a city
court in Kutaisi,  Georgia , Davit Bakradze, a member of
parliament with Saakashvili’s United National Movement party,
said today on the Rustavi 2 television channel. Merabishvili was
detained yesterday along with Zurab Tchiaberashvili, a former
health minister and current governor of Kakheti in eastern
Georgia, Bakradze said.  The United National Movement party was unexpectedly
defeated by billionaire Bidzina Ivanishvili’s opposition
coalition in Oct. 1 elections. The tycoon, now prime minister,
has since faced criticism from the European Union and U.S. after
police arrested officials from the former administration
including ex-Interior and Defense Minister Bacho Akhalaia.  Tchiaberashvili was released on bail, Bakradze said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
