Banks trading asset-backed securities
may have to give investors more information on the underlying
loans or assets of the structured product they are buying,
Europe’s top banking regulator said.  For securitizations based on loans, banks may be required
to provide data on a “loan-by-loan basis,” the London-based
European Banking Authority said in an e-mailed statement today.
Firms creating, issuing or selling the ABSs will also have to
hold on to 5 percent of the credit risk of the securitization,
the EBA said.  The additional disclosure should also take into account any
“material change to the performance of the securitization
position,” the watchdog said.  The boom in the U.S. and European markets for securitized
debt in the years leading up to 2008 was seen by regulators as
one of the main reasons for the collapse of Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc. and the ensuing financial crisis -- as lenders
struggled with a plunge in the debt’s market value.  Securitization has also been the subject of lawsuits, amid
accusations that some instruments were flawed or even designed
to incur losses.  An asset-backed security is a financial product whose value
derives from a pool of assets such as loans or credit-card debt,
rather than mortgages. The term securitized debt covers ABSs as
well as instruments based on homeowner loans.  To contact the reporter on this story:
