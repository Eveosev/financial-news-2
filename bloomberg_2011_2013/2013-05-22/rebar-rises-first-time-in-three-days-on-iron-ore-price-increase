Steel reinforcement-bar futures rose
for the first time in three days as  iron ore  prices recovered
from the lowest level in more than five months.  Rebar for delivery in October on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange rose as much as 0.5 percent to 3,609 yuan ($588) a
metric ton and was at 3,605 at 11:06 a.m. local time. The gain
pared this year’s loss to 9.6 percent.  Iron ore  with 62 percent iron content for immediate
delivery to the Tianjin port in  China  gained 0.5 percent to
$123.60 a dry ton yesterday, the first rise in nine days. Ore
touched $123 a ton the previous day, the lowest since Dec. 7,
according to an index compiled by The Steel Index Ltd.  “The cost of production is about the only support the
rebar market has now,” Li Jinlu, analyst at Yongan Futures Co.,
said by phone from Hangzhou. “We expect to see a bit of cutback
on production, which is supportive of rebar prices.”  Rebar inventory in China tracked by Shanghai Steelhome
Information Technology Co. fell to 8.64 million tons on May 17,
the sixth weekly decline and the lowest level since Feb. 8.  The average  spot price  for rebar fell 0.2 percent to 3,552
 yuan  a ton yesterday, according to Beijing Antaike Information
Development Co.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
