Former U.S. men’s national team
captain Claudio Reyna has been named the first employee of the
 New York  City Football Club, the Major League Soccer expansion
team controlled by  Manchester City Football Club .  Reyna was named the club’s director of football, and will
be responsible for recruiting players, coaches and trainers in
preparation for the team’s inaugural 2015 MLS season, Manchester
City Chief Executive Officer Ferran Soriano announced today in
an e-mailed release.  Major League Baseball ’s  New York Yankees  are an investor in
the expansion team, which was unveiled yesterday and will become
the 20th team in the MLS.  “Having had the privilege of playing both for my country
here in the U.S. and for Manchester City FC in England, I could
not have hoped for a more tailored-made opportunity in soccer,”
Reyna, 39, said in the release.  Reyna was a member of the U.S. national team from 1994 to
2006, playing in three World Cup tournaments and serving as
captain in 2006. His club career included stints with  Manchester
City  from 2003 to 2007, and the New York Red Bulls of the MLS
from 2007 to 2008.  Elected last year to the National Soccer Hall of Fame,
Reyna stepped down today from his position as  U.S. Soccer ’s
youth technical director, which he held since 2010.  To contact the reporters on this story:
