Mr Price Group Ltd., (MPC)  a South African
clothing, furniture and linen retailer, extended gains after
full-year earnings beat estimates as sales improved at its
apparel chain.  Earnings per share adjusted for one-time items gained 26
percent to 6.355 rand in the year through March, the company
said today in a statement. That beat the 5.85-rand median
estimate of 11 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  The  stock rose  0.4 percent to 128.50 rand by the 5 p.m.
close in Johannesburg. Mr Price has climbed 11 percent since
April 10 when the company said earnings rose by at least 20
percent.  “In the short-term, there are some serious challenges
facing consumers,” Chief Executive Officer Stuart Bird said in
the statement. “Under tight economic conditions, shoppers tend
to shop for value” and Mr Price is “well placed to attract
more customers.”  Net income advanced 26 percent to 1.54 billion rand
($162 million), the company said. Sales increased 13 percent to
13.7 billion rand. The retailer boosted the full-year  dividend 
27 percent to 3.98 rand a share.  To contact the reporter on this story:
