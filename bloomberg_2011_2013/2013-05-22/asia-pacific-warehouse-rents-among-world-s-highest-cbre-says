Six Asia-Pacific cities were among
the 10 most expensive for warehouse rents, driven by demand from
logistics companies and retailers amid limited space
availability, according to CBRE Group Inc.  The greater Tokyo area had the highest average rent in the
first quarter of 2013, at $20.70 per square foot per year, and
the strongest quarterly growth at 5.7 percent, a  report  from the
broker showed. Rental increases remained subdued as many
occupiers sought more evidence of strengthening in global
economies before committing to space, it said.  The weakness “can partially be attributed to occupier
reluctance and cost-containment,” Abigail Pitzner, global
economist at CBRE, wrote in the report. Still, “occupiers
looking to move were faced with very few options that met their
desired specifications as large blocks of prime space in the
best locations remained hard to find and expensive.”  Singapore was the third-most expensive market at $17.32 per
square foot, while  Hong Kong  had the second-highest growth, at
2.3 percent, CBRE said. Brisbane, Sydney and Perth, which saw
little change from the previous quarter, were also among the
most expensive, and  London ,  Stockholm ,  Sao Paulo  and Paris
rounded out the top 10, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
