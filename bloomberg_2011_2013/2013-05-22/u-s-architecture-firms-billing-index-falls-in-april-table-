Billings at U.S. architecture firms 
fell in April according to the  American Institute of Architects .  Billings at architecture firms, tracked by the Work-on-the-Boards 
survey, fell to 48.6 in April from 51.9 a month earlier. The inquiry index,
which tracks a firms capacity to take on additional work, fell to 58.5.
A score above 50 indicates an increase in billings while a reading below 
50 indicates a negative outlook.  Commercial building construction typically follows the billings
index by about six months. Following is a table compiled from the
