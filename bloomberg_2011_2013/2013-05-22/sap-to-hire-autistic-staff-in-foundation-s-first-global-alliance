SAP AG (SAP) , the biggest business-management software maker, will start employing more people with
autism as software testers, programmers and in data management.  SAP is forming an alliance with Specialisterne, a
foundation to promote employment for autistic people in
technology industries, and will find jobs for those with the
disorder as it adds programs around the world, the Walldorf,
Germany-based company said in a statement yesterday.  ``SAP sees a potential competitive advantage to leveraging
the unique talents of people with autism, while also helping
them to secure meaningful employment,’’ the company said.  Autism interferes with brain development and is linked to
poor social interaction and communication skills as well as
repeated body movements, according to the U.S. Department of
Health & Human Services. The disorder has no known cause or cure
and about 1 in 88 children in the U.S. are diagnosed with an
autism-related condition.  A pilot program involved six software testers in  India , and
SAP is now hiring five autistic people in Ireland. SAP said it
will expand the project to the U.S., Canada and Germany this
year and that this is the foundation’s first global agreement
with a company.  Specialisterne, originally founded in  Denmark , is owned by
the Specialist People Foundation, a non-profit organization.  To contact the reporter on this story:
