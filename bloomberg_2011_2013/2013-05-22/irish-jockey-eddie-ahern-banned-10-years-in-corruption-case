Irish jockey Eddie Ahern was banned
from racing for 10 years after being found guilty of corruption
allegations.  A British Horseracing Authority disciplinary panel found
the 35-year-old had committed three rule breaches. They included
conspiring to commit a corrupt or fraudulent practice in
relation to bets on five horses to lose between September 2010
and February 2011.  He was also found to have passed on information for reward
and intentionally failed to ride a horse on its merits in a race
at Lingfield in January 2011, the BHA said  on its website .  Former West Bromwich Albion soccer player and horse owner
Neil Clement, 34, was banned for 15 years after also being found
guilty on three charges, including conspiring with Ahern and
others to commit a fraudulent practice linked to bets that
horses would lose.  Ahern’s lawyer Christopher Stewart-Moore said his client
will appeal.  “Eddie Ahern is absolutely devastated by the BHA Panel’s
findings,” Stewart-Moore said in a statement to Press
Association Sport. “He did not breach the rules of racing as
found by the panel or at all and he will be appealing both the
findings as well as the very harsh penalties imposed on him.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
