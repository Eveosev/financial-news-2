The captain of the Costa Concordia
cruise liner that shipwrecked off Tuscany last year was indicted
today by an Italian judge.  The trial will start July 9 in Grosseto,  Italy , his lawyer
Francesco Pepe said by phone today. Francesco Schettino faces
criminal charges including manslaughter and abandoning the ship
before all the 4,200 passengers had been evacuated.  The Costa Concordia, owned by  Carnival Corp (CCL) ’s Costa
Crociere SpA Italian unit, ran aground near the island of Giglio
hours after leaving a port close to Rome on Jan. 13, 2012,
killing 32 people.  Schettino is accused of steering the ship too close to
the island as a way of saluting the inhabitants and a veteran
captain of the Costa line. He has always denied any wrongdoing,
saying his actions saved lives.  To contact the reporter on this story:
