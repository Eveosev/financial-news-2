Emperia Holding SA, a Polish
consumer-goods distributor, soared the most in 10 weeks after
Erste Group Bank AG recommended buying its shares.  The  shares  surged 6.6 percent at 57.83 zloty at 12:55 p.m.
in Warsaw, posting the biggest gain since March 8 and valuing
the Lublin, Poland-based company at 874 million zloty ($270
million). Turnover stood at 306 percent of the three-month daily
average volume, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  “We expect Emperia to show organic improvement coming from
higher gross margin” thanks to its “own logistics and new
trade agreements with producers,” Marek Czachor, an analyst at
Erste in Warsaw, said in a note today.  Erste raised its recommendation to buy from hold and
increased its share-price estimate to 66 zloty from 55 zloty.  “We like the company’s sound balance sheet” with 275
million zloty of net cash position, or one-third of its market
value and “healthy operating cash flows,” Czachor said.  Emperia shares have declined 0.3 percent in 2013, compared
with an 8.1 percent drop in Warsaw’s WIG20 Index of the
country’s biggest and most liquid stocks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
