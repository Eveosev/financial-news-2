West Texas Intermediate oil fell the
most in three weeks as a government report showed U.S. gasoline
supplies unexpectedly gained and crude stockpiles declined less
than expected.  Futures dropped 2 percent after the Energy Information
Administration said  gasoline  inventories advanced 3.02 million
barrels to 220.7 million. Supplies were forecast to decrease
300,000 barrels, according to the median of 11 analyst estimates
in a Bloomberg survey. Crude supplies slipped 338,000 barrels to
394.6 million, less than half as much as forecast. The price
decline accelerated as the dollar strengthened.  “The fundamentals are weighing on the market along with
the strength of the dollar,” said  Gene McGillian , an analyst
and broker at Tradition Energy in Stamford, Connecticut. “Even
with a decline, we’re looking at almost 395 million barrels of
crude, which is more than ample.”  WTI oil for July delivery fell $1.90 to settle at $94.28 a
barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It was the biggest
decline since May 1 and the lowest settlement since May 14. The
volume of all contracts traded was 12 percent above the 100-day
average at 3:16 p.m.  Gasoline for June delivery dropped 2.64 cents, or 0.9
percent, to end the session at $2.8194 a gallon on the Nymex. It
was the lowest settlement since May 2. Trading volume was 25
percent above the 100-day average.  “Today’s gasoline number is enough to make investors
complacent about inventories as we near the upcoming driving
season,” said  Michael Lynch , president of Strategic Energy &
Economic Research in Winchester, Massachusetts.  Fuel Demand  Consumption of gasoline  over the past four weeks was 8.5
million barrels a day, the lowest  seasonal level  in at least 10
years. The total was up 10,000 barrels a day from the previous
week. The peak-demand summer driving season when Americans
usually take vacations begins with the May 27 Memorial Day
holiday and ends in early September with Labor Day.  “There’s no demand for gasoline,” said  Tom Finlon ,
Jupiter, Florida-based director of Energy Analytics Group LLC.
“The data shows that demand rose last week, but the inventory
gain paints a bearish picture. There was no measurable movement
to wholesalers or retailers ahead of Memorial Day.”  Refineries operated at 87.3 percent of capacity last week,
down from 88 percent in the seven days ended May 10, the report
showed.  Gasoline production  climbed 285,000 barrels a day to
9.21 million last week, the highest rate this year.  “Refiners cut back on utilization rates and were still
able to push 3 million barrels into storage,” McGillian said.  Projected Decrease  Crude supplies have dropped two straight weeks after
climbing to 395.5 million in the week ended May 3, the most
since 1931, according to the EIA, the Energy Department’s
statistical unit. A 1 million-barrel decline was forecast in the
Bloomberg survey.  Surging North American crude output has bolstered
stockpiles at Cushing, Oklahoma, the delivery point for WTI.
Inventories there, which reached a record 51.9 million barrels
in the week ended Jan. 11, rose 449,000 barrels to 50.2 million
last week.  Output , which fell 63,000 barrels a day to 7.26
million last week, reached a two-decade high of 7.37 million the
seven days ended May 3.  Brent oil for July settlement fell $1.31, or 1.3 percent,
to end the session at $102.60 a barrel on the London-based ICE
Futures Europe exchange. Volume for all contracts was 21 percent
lower than the 100-day average. The European benchmark grade
traded at a $8.32 premium to WTI, up from $7.73 yesterday.  “The Cushing supply build should widen the Brent-WTI
spread,” Finlon said.  Chinese Inventories  Crude stockpiles in China, the biggest oil-consuming
country after the U.S., climbed a second month. Crude stockpiles
rose 0.1 percent in April, China Oil, Gas & Petrochemicals, a
newsletter published by the official Xinhua News agency,
reported today. Supplies rose to 28.7 million metric tons, a
three-month high, according to Bloomberg calculations.  Oil also slipped as the  Dollar Index  rose to a 34-month
high after Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said the
central bank may taper monthly bond purchases, known as
quantitative easing, at its next few meetings if it’s confident
of sustained gains in the economy. A rising dollar reduces the
appeal of raw materials priced in the currency.  “The Bernanke comments hinting at a decline in
quantitative easing are putting some downward pressure on the
market,” said  Michael Wittner , the head of oil-market research
at Societe Generale SA in New York.  Dollar Index  The index, which tracks the U.S. currency against six
others, rose as much as 0.7 percent to 84.422, the most since
July 2010. The gain was the eighth in 10 days.  Implied volatility for at-the-money WTI options expiring in
July was 22 percent at 3:15 p.m., compared with 20.6 yesterday,
data compiled by Bloomberg showed.  Electronic trading volume on the Nymex was 567,957
contracts as of 3:18 p.m. It totaled 485,704 contracts in the
previous session, 16 percent below the three-month average. Open
interest was 1.74 million contracts, the lowest level since
April 25.  To contact the reporter on this story:
