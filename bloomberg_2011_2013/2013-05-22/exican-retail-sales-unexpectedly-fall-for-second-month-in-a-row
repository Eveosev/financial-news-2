Mexico ’s retail  sales (MXWRTRYO)  surprised
analysts in March by contracting for a second straight month for
the first time since 2009, bolstering bets policy makers will
cut interest rates again this year.  Sales fell 2.4 percent from a year earlier, the national
statistics agency said today, more than forecast by any of the
19 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The median estimate was for
an increase of 0.3 percent. Retail sales climbed 0.25 percent
from the previous month.  Economists have joined traders in forecasting the central
bank will cut the benchmark rate this year after the economy
expanded in the first quarter at the slowest pace since the 2009
aftermath of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.’s collapse. Policy
makers left the key  interest rate  at 4 percent in April after
cutting it half a point in March, saying inflation will ease to
within the 2 percent to 4 percent target range in the second
half of the year from 4.65 percent last month.  Six-month interest rate swaps fell 1 basis point to 4.16
percent at 8:05 a.m. in Mexico City, indicating traders see a 72
percent chance the bank will lower rates by October. As recently
as May 3, the likelihood was 32 percent. The peso rose 0.4
percent to 12.2913 per dollar and has strengthened 4.6 percent
this year, the most among 16 major currencies tracked by
Bloomberg.  Economists predict a 50 basis point rate cut in September,
according to the median estimate in a survey by Citigroup Inc.’s
Banamex published yesterday. The previous bi-weekly survey had
forecast a 25 basis-point increase in September 2014.  Latin America ’s biggest economy after  Brazil  will grow 3.1
percent this year, the  Finance Ministry  said May 17. It cut the
forecast from 3.5 percent after first-quarter GDP rose 0.8
percent from the year earlier, less than the 1.1 percent
expected in a Bloomberg survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
