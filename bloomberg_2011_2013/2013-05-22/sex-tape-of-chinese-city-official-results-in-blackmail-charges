Chinese authorities charged  six
people  with blackmail for allegedly extorting two officials by
secretly filming their sexual encounters, People’s Daily
reported on its website today.  The six were charged in the southern city of Chongqing with
blackmailing two officials for 5 million  yuan  ($815,000), the
report said. Among the targets was Lei Zhengfu, a district
Communist Party secretary in Chongqing who was fired after a
video of him having sex with a woman was posted online.  The sex tape drew attention to a Chongqing police
investigation that found a criminal ring had hired women to
seduce local officials, filmed them having sex, and then used
the videos to demand money or government contracts, the official
Xinhua News Agency reported May 7. Twenty-one government
officials and executives with state-owned enterprises were later
punished, it said.  When President Xi Jinping took over as general-secretary of
the party in November, he warned that a failure to contain
corruption could lead it to lose power. In a May 14 article,
Xinhua said Lei’s downfall “suggested the ruling party welcomes
netizens to join the anti-corruption campaign in a rational,
legal way.”  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
