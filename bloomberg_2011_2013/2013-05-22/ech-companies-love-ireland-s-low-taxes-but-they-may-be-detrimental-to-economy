Ireland's low corporate tax rate is good for global companies like Apple, but is it good for the Irish people? University College Dublin senior lecturer Kieran Allen says no. Only about 7 percent of the Irish workforce is actually employed at these multinational companies, he said. And as long as the tax rates on these companies remain low, the country's domestic economy will have to bear the burden, putting the squeeze on residents and small businesses. "This is extremely detrimental to the Irish economy," Allen said  during an interview  on Bloomberg Television's "Countdown."
