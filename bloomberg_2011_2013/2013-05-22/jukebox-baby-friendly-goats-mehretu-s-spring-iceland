Colored papers, draperies and packages are some of the unusual subjects explored by realist painter Claudio Bravo in a show spanning the years 1936 to 2011 at  Manhattan ’s Marlborough Gallery.  A picturesque triptych, consisting of one larger panel between two thinner ones, depicts the three sides of a red-and-beige package sealed with a piece of cord.  Though painted with oil on a flat surface, the detailed “Triptico paquete rojo y blanco” is extremely realistic.  Don’t miss the gallery’s smaller room filled with Bravo’s drawings of animals, including a donkey, two friendly goats, a family of ducks and a rooster with a chicken and egg.  The gallery won’t disclose prices. Through June 8 at 40 W. 57th St. +1-212-541-4948;  http://www.marlboroughgallery.com .
