Popular Inc. (BPOP) , Puerto Rico’s biggest
bank, said that Richard Carrion will step down as chief
executive officer if he’s successful in a bid to be elected
president of the  International Olympic Committee .  Carrion, 60, will remain as non-executive chairman if
elected IOC president after the Sept. 10 vote, the San Juan-based lender said today in a statement. The directors have a
“number of strong internal candidates” who could succeed
Carrion, according to the statement.  Carrion has been CEO of Popular since 1994, according to an
 annual filing . The lender still owes U.S. taxpayers almost $1
billion from a bailout during the financial crisis that
prevented its collapse.  “The Board supports Richard in this endeavor,” director
William Teuber, 61, said in the statement. “We have known that
this was a possibility for over a year, given his passion for
the Olympic movement, and have planned accordingly.”  Carrion has been an IOC member since 1990, Popular said in
the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
