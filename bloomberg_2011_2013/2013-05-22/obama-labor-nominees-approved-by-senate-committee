A Senate committee approved five
nominees to the U.S. labor board, including two Democrats
ensnared in a legal and political dispute over their appointment
a year ago without confirmation.  The vote by the Senate Health, Education, Labor and
Pensions Committee sets up a fight over confirmation of the
three Democrats and two Republicans to the National Labor
Relations Board. The board, with three sitting members, will
lose its quorum and be unable to function unless at least one
nominee is confirmed before Chairman Mark Gaston Pearce’s term
expires Aug. 27.  The nominees include Democrats Sharon Block and Richard Griffin, whose appointments by President  Barack Obama  in 2012
were deemed invalid in a Jan. 25 ruling by the U.S. Court of
Appeals in  Washington . The administration has appealed the
decision to the Supreme Court. Block and Griffin today won
support from all Democrats and one Republican on the committee.  “I don’t doubt that these two nominations are qualified
nominees,” Senator Lamar Alexander of  Tennessee , the ranking
Republican on the committee, said today. “The problem is the
president appointed them as so-called recess appointments during
a time the Senate wasn’t in recess.”  Republicans Harry Johnson and Philip Miscimarra were
approved by unanimous votes. The panel approved Pearce 18-4.  The nominations advance to the full Senate, where a date
for a confirmation vote hasn’t been set.  To contact the reporter on this story:
