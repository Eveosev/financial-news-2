The leader of the U.K. opposition
Labour Party, Ed Miliband, compared  Royal Bank of Scotland  Plc
to the Simpsons’ nuclear-plant owning Montgomery Burns, saying
the bank practiced “irresponsible capitalism.”  Speaking today at a conference organized by Google Inc.
north of London, Miliband showed a picture of the cartoon
villain to illustrate a speech about business practices.  “He’s not such a good guy, he leaves radioactive nuggets
lying around,” Miliband said of Burns. “Of course, he is a
cartoon character, but I could have substituted him with RBS or
some of the other big banks before the financial crash.”  “He illustrates my case today because there is a choice to
make,” Miliband said. “A choice between an ‘irresponsible
capitalism’ which sees huge gaps between the richest and the
poorest, power concentrated in a few hands, and people are just
in it for the fast buck whatever the consequences.”  The other choice is a “responsible capitalism,” Miliband
said, “where companies pursue profit but we also have an equal
society, power is in the hands of the many and where we
recognize our responsibilities to each other.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
