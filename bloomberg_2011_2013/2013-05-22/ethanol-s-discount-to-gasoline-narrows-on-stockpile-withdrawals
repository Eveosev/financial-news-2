Ethanol’s discount to gasoline shrank
to the smallest in six days after a report showed a fourth week
of supply declines.  The spread, or price difference, narrowed 4.04 cents to
17.34 cents a gallon after the Energy Information Administration
said that  stockpiles  sank 1.5 percent to 16.2 million barrels,
the fewest since Nov. 5, 2010. Most of the declines were in the
population-dense regions of the East Coast, Midwest and Gulf of
Mexico, classified as PADDs 1, 2 and 3.  “The tight ethanol inventory situation was clearly on
display in this week’s EIA report,” said Michael Breitenbach, a
broker and director of research at Blue Ocean Brokerage LLC in
 New York . “Stocks in PADDs 1, 2 and 3 all now stand at or near
2013 lows.”  Denatured ethanol for June delivery rose 1.4 cent, or 0.5
percent, to $2.646 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Futures have gained 24 percent in the past year.  Gasoline for June delivery slipped 2.64 cents, or 0.9
percent, to $2.8194 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The contract covers reformulated gasoline, made to be
blended with ethanol before delivery to filling stations.  Ethanol-blended gasoline made up about 94 percent of the
total U.S. gasoline supply, down from 95 percent the previous
week and the smallest amount since April 19, EIA data show.  Production of the biofuel climbed 2.1 percent to 875,000
barrels a day last week, the highest level since June 22, the
Energy Department’s statistical arm said.  Corn Costs  Manufacturing costs have eased amid projections that
farmers will plant the most acres of corn since 1936 as they
seek to rebound from drought that shriveled crops last summer.  Corn for July delivery jumped 18.5 cents, or 2.9 percent,
to $6.585 a bushel in  Chicago .  The corn crush spread for July was 12 cents, down from 17
cents yesterday and compared with minus 35 cents on Dec. 31. The
amount doesn’t include revenue from the sale of dried
distillers’ grains, a byproduct of ethanol production, which can
be fed to livestock.  Corn-based ethanol Renewable Identification Numbers  for
2013, or RINs, fell 0.6 percent to 89 cents as of 4:05 p.m. New
York time, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Advanced RINs, which
cover biodiesel and Brazilian sugarcane-based ethanol, gained
2.1 percent to 99 cents.  The U.S. hasn’t made any  foreign purchases  of the biofuel
since April 19, the longest such stretch since the period ended
March 2, 2012, the EIA report showed.  Anhydrous ethanol in  Sao Paulo  cost $2.53 a gallon in the
week ended May 17, or about 7 percent cheaper than today’s spot
price in the U.S. Gulf, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Spot Prices  In cash market trading, ethanol in the U.S. Gulf sank 4
cents to $2.72 a gallon, data compiled by Bloomberg show. In
Chicago, the additive lost 1.5 cents to $2.625. In New York, it
was unchanged at $2.76, and on the West Coast the biofuel was
unchanged at $2.785 a gallon.  West Coast ethanol’s premium over the  Gulf Coast  expanded 4
cents to 6.5 cents, while Chicago’s discount to New York Harbor
widened 1.5 cents to 13.5 cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
