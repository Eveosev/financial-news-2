Peruvian policy makers are open to
cutting their benchmark  interest rate  if an economic slowdown
takes hold in the Andean nation, central bank President Julio Velarde said.  The central bank board may cut this year’s growth forecast
after  the economy  expanded in March at the slowest pace since
October 2009, Velarde told reporters in Lima today.  Peru’s central bank has kept its benchmark lending rate at
4.25 percent for two years, matching  Malaysia  for the longest
pause in  developing countries . The bank’s current estimate is
for GDP to climb 6.3 percent this year after expanding an
average 6.5 percent in the past decade.  “There is a deceleration,” Velarde said. “If we see a
considerable deceleration, we could reduce the interest rate.”  Gross domestic product  rose 4.8 percent in the first
quarter from the year earlier, the slowest pace in more than
three years, according to the median estimate of 13 analysts
polled by Bloomberg. The statistics agency will release the
first-quarter report tomorrow. In March, economic activity
expanded 3 percent from a year ago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
