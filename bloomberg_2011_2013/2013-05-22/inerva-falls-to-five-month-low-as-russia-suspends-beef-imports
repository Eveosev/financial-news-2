Minerva SA,  Brazil ’s third-largest
beef producer by market value, dropped to a five-month low as
 Russia ’s veterinary and health surveillance service suspended
beef imports from one of its plants.  Shares of the Barretos, Brazil-based meatpacker declined
2.3 percent to 10.20 reais at 11:22 a.m. in Sao Paulo, the
lowest level on a closing basis since Dec. 18. It was the worst
performer on the  Bovespa Small Cap index , which added 1 percent.  Russia “temporarily” halted beef imports from a plant in
the state of Goias, the company said in a regulatory filing
yesterday after the newspaper Valor Economico reported the
suspension. The company said in the filing that it is working to
adapt plant conditions to Russia’s requirements.  Sao Paulo-based Valor reported yesterday that Russia
suspended imports from two plants of  Marfrig Alimentos SA (MRFG3) ,
Brazil’s second-biggest meatpacker. That company said in a
regulatory filing today that it hasn’t been notified of the
decision and, if the halt is confirmed, it will continue
exporting to Russia beef from other plants. Sao Paulo-based
Marfrig shares declined as much as 1.4 percent to 7.20 reais
before rising the same amount to 7.40 reais.  Minerva’s and Marfrig’s press offices didn’t immediately
respond to phone calls and e-mail messages from Bloomberg News
seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
