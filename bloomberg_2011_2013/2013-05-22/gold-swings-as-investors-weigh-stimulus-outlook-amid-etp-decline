Gold futures closed lower following
wide prices swings as Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke 
signaled that U.S. monetary stimulus may be scaled back.  “If we see continued improvement, and we have confidence
that is going to be sustained, we could in the next few meetings
take a step down in our pace of purchases,” Bernanke said today
in  Washington  in congressional testimony. Gold jumped as much as
2.6 percent to $1,413.30 an ounce after he said that withdrawing
policy accommodation “at this juncture” would be “highly
unlikely.”  “The market realizes that the Fed is working on a plan to
end the stimulus,”  Frank McGhee , the head dealer at Integrated
Brokerage Services LLC in  Chicago , said in a telephone
interview. “The buyers are deserting the gold market as the
stimulus support may disappear.”  Gold futures for June delivery dropped 0.7 percent to close
at $1,367.40 an ounce at 1:44 p.m. on the Comex in  New York . The
price fell as low as $1,353.10 after the settlement.  Trading almost doubled from the average in the past 100
days for this time, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Silver futures for July delivery rose 0.1 percent to
$22.472 an ounce on the Comex. The metal jumped as much as 3.7
percent and dropped 1.3 percent.  Silver Swings  Two days ago, silver plunged as much as 9.4 percent and
gained 4 percent before closing up 1 percent after Moody’s
Investors Service said U.S. policy makers must address debt woes
to avoid a credit-rating downgrade this year.  In 2013, silver has tumbled 26 percent, the most among 24
 raw materials  in the Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot Index, followed
by gold.  The Fed buys $85 billion of Treasury and mortgage debt a
month. Gold fell into a  bear market  in April as some investors
lost faith in the metal as a store of value, partly on concern
that the Fed may scale back stimulus. The price has tumbled 18
percent this year.  After the settlement, Fed minutes from the last meeting
showed that many officials said more progress in the labor
market is needed before deciding to slow the pace of asset
purchases.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , palladium futures for
June delivery rose 0.5 percent to $752.15 an ounce, the highest
settlement since April 3.  Platinum futures for July delivery gained 0.7 percent to
$1,469.20 an ounce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
