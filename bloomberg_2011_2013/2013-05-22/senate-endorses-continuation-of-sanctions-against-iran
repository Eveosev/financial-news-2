The  U.S. Senate  voted 99-0 to adopt a
resolution calling for continued and stronger sanctions against
 Iran .  The resolution, S. Res. 65, also includes a statement of
support for Israel if that nation decides to act against Iran.  The resolution states that the U.S. should support Israel
“in accordance with United States law and the constitutional
responsibility of Congress to authorize the use of military
force” if Israel “is compelled to take military action in
legitimate self-defense against Iran’s nuclear weapons
program.”  Foreign Relations Committee Chairman  Robert Menendez  said
during floor debate that the resolution would send two messages.  One message, the New Jersey Democrat said, is “Israel, we
continue to be your faithful ally.”  The other message, he said, is to Iran.  “We cannot allow
Iran to bide more time by talking even as the centrifuges keep
spinning,” he said. “Iran’s leaders must understand that
unless they change their course, their situation will only get
worse. Their pursuit of nuclear weapons capabilities will make
them less, not more, secure.”  Separately, the  House Foreign Affairs Committee  approved,
by voice vote, a measure that would permit further trade
restrictions with Iran.  The actions coincide with a visit to the region by
Secretary of State  John Kerry .  The House bill is H.R. 850.  To contact the reporter on this story:
