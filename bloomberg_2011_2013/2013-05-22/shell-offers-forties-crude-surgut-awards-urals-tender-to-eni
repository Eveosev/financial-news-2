(Corrects headline to BP offers.)  BP Plc (BP/)  failed to sell  North Sea 
Forties crude at a lower price. Vitol Group sold two Russian
Urals crude cargoes in Europe.  Surgutneftegas awarded a tender to sell one Urals crude
cargo each month from the Baltic Sea ports of Primorsk and Ust-Luga to  Eni SpA (ENI) , according to three people who asked not to be
identified because the information is confidential. All
shipments comprise 100,000 metric tons each. The tender covers
the period from July to December.  North Sea  BP was unable to sell Forties for loading June 7 to June 9
at 30 cents a barrel less than Dated Brent, according to a
Bloomberg survey of traders and brokers monitoring the Platts
pricing window. That compares with yesterday’s deal at a
discount of 20 cents.  The company also failed to sell Oseberg grade for the same
period at a premium of 8 cents a barrel to Dated Brent, the
survey showed.  Reported crude trading typically occurs during the Platts
window, which ends at 4:30 p.m. London time. Forties loading in
10 to 25 days fell by 22 cents to a discount of 26 cents a
barrel to Dated Brent, the lowest since May 2, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Brent for July settlement traded at $103.30 a barrel on the
ICE Futures  Europe  exchange at the close of the window, compared
with $103.74 yesterday. The August contract was at $103.17 at
the same time today, a discount of 13 cents to July.  Mediterranean/Urals  Vitol sold 100,000 tons of Urals for loading on June 9 to
June 13 to Total SA at 40 cents a barrel less than Dated Brent
on a delivered basis to Rotterdam, the survey showed. This
compares with a trade at a discount of 95 cents on May 13.  The company sold to Eni 80,000 tons of the blend for June 2
to June 6 loading at a discount of 20 cents to Dated Brent, on a
delivered basis to Augusta,  Italy , according to the survey. This
is 5 cents less than the previous trade on April 30.  Urals in the Mediterranean fell by 3 cents to a premium of
7 cents a barrel to Dated Brent, data compiled by Bloomberg
showed. In northwest Europe, the  discount  was at 20 cents a
barrel to the benchmark, compared with 17 cents yesterday.  Russia will export 1.4 million tons of Urals from Primorsk
in the first 11 days of June, according to a preliminary loading
program obtained by Bloomberg.  Loadings of Urals from Ust-Luga for May 31 to June 11 will
be seven lots of 100,000 tons each, the program showed.  Exports from Novorossiysk on the  Black Sea  will be 10
cargoes, comprising eight lots of 80,000 tons each and two of
140,000 tons, according to the plan.  Surgutneftegas issued a new tender to sell two 100,000-ton
cargoes in June, two people with knowledge of matter said. One
lot will load June 6 to June 7 from Primorsk and the other from
Ust-Luga on June 8 to June 9. The tender closes tomorrow.  For other grades in the Mediterranean, Vitol bought 600,000
barrels of Azeri Light for loading on June 3 to June 7 from
Socar Trading SA at $2.60 a barrel more than Dated Brent, the
survey showed.  West Africa  Benchmark Nigerian Qua Iboe blend fell by 4 cents to $2.83
a barrel more than Dated Brent, data compiled by Bloomberg
showed. That’s the least since Feb. 28.  Nigeria  will export 62 crude cargoes in July, according to
loading programs obtained by  Bloomberg News  that cover 17 of 18
grades.  The nation will ship 13 consignments of Qua Iboe, seven
each of Agbami and Forcados, five each of Akpo and Bonga, four
of Bonny Light, three each of Amenam, Erha, Escravos and Usan,
two each of Antan and Yoho and one each of Abo, EA Blend, Okono,
Okwori and Pennington, according to the schedules. The size of
the cargoes range from 167,000 to 1 million barrels.  That compares with 66 lots, or 58 million barrels, due to
be exported next month, a full plan of the 18 blends show.  The July program for Brass River wasn’t yet available. It
totaled five cargoes in June.  Equatorial Guinea  plans to keep exports of its Ceiba crude
