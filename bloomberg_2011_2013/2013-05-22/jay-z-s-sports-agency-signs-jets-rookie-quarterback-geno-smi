New York Jets rookie quarterback Geno Smith has signed with Jay-Z’s Roc Nation Sports, according to
the firm’s website.  Jay-Z, an entertainer whose real name is Shawn Carter,
announced last month that he was starting an athlete
representation firm with New York Yankees All-Star second
baseman Robinson Cano as its first client. The company operates
in a partnership with Creative Artists Agency.  Smith, 22, is yet to sign a contract with the Jets, who
selected him in the second round of the National Football League
Draft. He said today that Jay-Z played “not that big of a
role” in his decision.  “I think it’s just his agency,” Smith said at organized
team activities, according to the  New York Daily News . “When
you talk about being in New York from a standpoint of what they
can do in the city, the connections that they have, I think it’s
a good move.”  The former West Virginia University quarterback was among
three players invited to last month’s draft who weren’t selected
in the first round, a slight he said was “tough to stomach.”
He fired his previous agents at Select Sports Group one week
after the draft, according to USA Today.  Smith is the oddsmakers’ favorite to win the NFL Offensive
Rookie of the Year award. He will be in competition for the
team’s starting quarterback job, according to John Idzik, the
Jets’ first-year general manager.  In addition to Cano, Roc Nation Sports also represents
Skylar Diggins of the Tulsa Shock in the Women’s National
Basketball Association.  To contact the reporters on this story:
