Pearson Plc’s (PSON)  Penguin unit said it
reached a $75 million settlement of antitrust claims by 33
states and consumers over electronic-book pricing.  Penguin, which was sued last year for allegedly
participating in a conspiracy with other publishers and  Apple
Inc. (AAPL)  to fix the price of e-books, announced the settlement in a
statement today. The company resolved related claims with the
U.S. Justice Department in December.  The states claimed damages on behalf of people who were
forced to pay too much for e-books because of the alleged
conspiracy. The Justice Department and the states claimed Apple
and five publishers, including Penguin, fixed prices in an
attempt to undermine  Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) ’s dominance of the market.  The Penguin settlement must be approved by a federal judge
in New York before it can take effect. Apple is scheduled to
begin a trial June 3 on civil antitrust claims by the Justice
Department and states.  The case is U.S. v. Apple, 11-cv-02293, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York ( Manhattan ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
