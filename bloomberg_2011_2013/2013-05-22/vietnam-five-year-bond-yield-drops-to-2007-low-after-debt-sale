Vietnam ’s five-year bonds gained,
driving the yield to a 2007 low, after borrowing costs dropped
at a government debt sale. The dong strengthened.  The State Treasury sold all of the 5 trillion dong ($238
million) of notes it offered yesterday. Five-year securities
were sold at a yield of 8.23 percent, compared with 8.45 percent
at the previous auction on May 13, while the rates on two- and
three-year debt also declined. The  overnight interbank deposit
fixing  fell to 0.93 percent today, the least in data compiled by
Bloomberg going back to June 2009.  “Interbank liquidity has been abundant so there’s a lot of
demand for bonds, causing yields to go down,” said Tran Thi Thanh Thao, an analyst at MB Securities Joint-Stock Co. in Hanoi.  The yield on the five-year securities slid 20 basis points,
or 0.2 percentage point, to 8.25 percent, according to a daily
fixing from banks compiled by Bloomberg. That was the biggest
drop since March 29 and the lowest level since November 2007.  The dong rose 0.1 percent to 20,985 per dollar as of 3:55
p.m. in Hanoi, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
central bank fixed the  reference rate  at 20,828, a level
unchanged since December 2011, according to its website. The
currency is allowed to trade as much as 1 percent on either side
of the rate.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
