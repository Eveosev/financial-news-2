Newcrest Mining Ltd. (NCM) ,  Australia ’s
biggest gold producer, had its exploration license over 120
square kilometers of land in New South Wales quashed by a judge.  New South Wales Land and Environment Court Judge Nicola
Pain today upheld objections to the renewal of Newcrest’s
exploration license from Gold & Copper Resources Pty,  ruling  the
state government failed to provide sufficient reasons for
granting the renewal. Newcrest shares fell 4.2 percent to
A$14.94 at 1:24 p.m. in Sydney trading.  “There is no evidence on which I can infer that the
requisite state of satisfaction” was held by the minister’s
delegate in issuing the renewal, Pain wrote.  Newcrest has held an exploration license over the land near
its  Cadia Valley operations , southwest of Orange, since 1991.
The license was renewed for a seventh time on March 14, 2011
with an expiry date of May 20, 2014, according to the judgment.
Gold & Copper challenged the renewal on March 16, 2011, claiming
it was void or invalid.  Kerrina Watson, a Newcrest spokeswoman, declined to
immediately comment on the ruling.  The case is Gold and Copper Resources Pty v Minister for
Resources and Energy. 80736/2011. Land and Environment Court New
South Wales (Sydney).  To contact the reporter on this story:
