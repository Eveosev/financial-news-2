European Union carbon permits fell
the most in almost two weeks after prices breached a technical
support level and the U.K. auctioned allowances.  The December futures contract declined as much as 7.3
percent to 3.30 euros ($4.27) a metric ton on Londonâ€™s ICE
Futures Europe exchange. Allowances closed at 3.32 euros a ton,
the lowest for 10 days and the biggest decline since May 10.  The contract dropped below a trendline at 3.46 euros that
started from the record-low 2.46 euros on April 17, according to
Clive Lambert, an analyst in Billericay,  England  at
FuturesTechs.com Ltd. The breach of support means prices may
fall to as low as 2.86 euros a ton, Lambert said.  Aggregate daily trading volume for EU permits in May
declined yesterday to the lowest since Jan. 22, according to ICE
Futures data. The 20-day moving average for all contracts fell
to 20.4 million tons.  The U.K. sold 4.1 million EU allowances at 3.43 euros a ton
in a fortnightly auction. The sale had bids of 11.1 million
tons, the most for a U.K. offer since Feb. 27, according to ICE
data compiled by Bloomberg.  United Nations carbon offsets for December fell as much as
24 percent to 29 euro cents a ton, their lowest in almost three
weeks, before closing 11 percent lower at 34 cents a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
