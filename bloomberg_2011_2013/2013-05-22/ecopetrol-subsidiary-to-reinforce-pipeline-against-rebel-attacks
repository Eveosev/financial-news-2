Ecopetrol SA (ECOPETL)  subsidiary Cenit plans
to boost the capacity of Colombia’s oil storage facilities and
reinforce sections of pipeline to counter rebel attacks, Cenit
President Camilo Marulanda said in an interview today in Bogota.  Pipeline upgrades to boost crude shipments via the Pacific
coast and  Ecuador  are also being put in place, said Marulanda.  Colombia’s largest rebel group, the Revolutionary Armed
Forces of Colombia, or Farc, ended a unilateral cease-fire in
January, stepping up attacks on oil pipelines in a bid to
strengthen its hand during peace talks with the Colombian
government, currently under way in  Havana .  Oil producers in Colombia will face higher tariffs for some
pipelines, said Marulanda.  “We are inspecting all the tariffs in all the systems,”
said Marulanda. “There are some systems where the tariff will
go up, others where it might go down.”  Last month Ecopetrol followed other large  oil companies  in
handing over the running of midstream activities to a
subsidiary. Cenit is targeting year-end earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of 2.5 trillion
pesos ($1.35 million).  Cenit will boost capacity in the Ocensa pipeline, with the
new Bicentenario pipeline almost complete, said Marulanda.  To contact the reporter on this story:
