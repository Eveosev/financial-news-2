Equatorial Guinea  plans to keep
exports of its Aseng crude unchanged at two cargoes in July, a
loading program obtained by  Bloomberg News  shows.  Both of the consignments are of 650,000 barrels, according
to the plan. That compares with one of 950,000 barrels and the
other of 650,000 barrels for June. The country will also ship
three lots of its Zafiro blend, an earlier schedule showed. The
plan for Ceiba was not yet available.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
