Falck Renewables SpA (FKR)  plans to sell
minority stakes in its U.K. wind operations as the Italian
developer focuses on green electricity generation that delivers
constant power like biomass and waste-to-energy projects.  Falck plans to offload as much as 49 percent of the units
holding wind parks with 273 megawatts of capacity, the Milan-based company said today in a statement. It also wants the buyer
to invest jointly in new plants that, unlike wind, don’t produce
intermittent energy. Falck said it won’t add solar assets.  The proposals aim to reduce problems faced by managers of
power grids as irregular wind and solar generation expands. The
company is also diversifying as European countries such as Italy
and  Spain  pare back subsidies and banks reduce lending for wind
and solar projects because of the regional economic crisis.  Falck plans to invest 250 million euros ($322 million) to
add biomass, waste-to-energy and anaerobic digestion plants by
2017, including acquisitions. It aims to reach 865 megawatts in
all technologies by then from 716.4 megawatts now, Falck said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
