Serbia’s biggest ruling party won’t
resort to calling early elections because of growing concerns
over the nation’s economy, the NIN weekly magazine reported,
citing an interview with Deputy Prime Minister Aleksandar Vucic.  “I have nightmares” because of the state of the economy,
Vucic, who leads former nationalists of the Serbian Progressive
Party, told NIN in an interview.  Vucic said he wants to talk with Premier Ivica Dacic, whose
Socialists oppose wage and pension cuts, according to NIN. Vucic
said the International Monetary Fund told Serbia to freeze
public wages, “drastically” cut spending and avoid tax
increases that would further hurt growth.  The IMF completed a mission to the Balkan nation on May 21
without issuing a statement after inspecting its economy under
Article IV consultations for two weeks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
