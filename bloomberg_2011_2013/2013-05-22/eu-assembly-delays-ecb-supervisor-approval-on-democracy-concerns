European Parliament lawmakers delayed
endorsing plans to hand the European Central Bank oversight
powers, as they seek guarantees that they’ll have democratic
control over the new supervisor.  Legislators gave preliminary approval today to a deal
struck with governments on the law, while postponing a final
decision pending further talks with the Frankfurt-based central
bank on information sharing and scrutiny.  Today’s vote “is not the final word on this dossier,”
Marianne Thyssen, one of the lawmakers in charge of the
parliament’s work on the rules, said during a debate in the
assembly. By postponing final endorsement, “we create space for
more robust inter-institutional agreements with the ECB on
accountability,” she said.  EU leaders called last year for the ECB to take on
oversight powers for euro-area lenders in a bid to untangle the
finances of banks and governments. The single supervisor for the
euro area is a precondition for banks to get direct aid from the
currency area’s firewall fund, and is the first step of an EU
plan to build a so-called banking union of centralized oversight
and crisis management for lenders.  The ECB has urged the EU to proceed swiftly with putting
the supervisor law on its statute books, warning that delays
complicate its preparations for the new tasks, which the central
bank is scheduled to assume next year.  “At present we do not have any legal certainty yet, which
means we cannot even rent premises, for example,” ECB Executive
Board Member Yves Mersch said earlier this month. “We have no
legal authority to sign contracts.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
