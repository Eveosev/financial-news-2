Most Brazilian stocks climbed as
 Brookfield Incorporacoes SA (BISA3)  led homebuilders higher after a
report showed slower-than-forecast inflation in  Brazil ,
outweighing losses by commodities producers.  Retailers also advanced as B2W Cia. Digital rose to a two-week high. Voting shares of Petroleo Brasileiro SA, the state-run oil producer, fell the most on the benchmark index as crude
sank 2.2 percent amid speculation that the  Federal Reserve  will
scale back stimulus efforts.  The Ibovespa slipped 0.1 percent to 56,199.22 at 4:23 p.m.
in  Sao Paulo , erasing an advance of as much as 1.5 percent.
Thirty-eight stocks advanced while 32 dropped. The real fell 0.4
percent to 2.0460 per dollar.  “We’re seeing some positive signs coming from the
Brazilian economy, which is one of the reasons why we’re seeing
the outlook for equities getting a bit better when compared with
what we had two or three months ago,” Rogerio Freitas, a
partner at hedge fund Teorica Investimentos, said by phone from
 Rio de Janeiro .  Homebuilders and retailers advanced after the national
statistics agency reported that the  IPCA-15 price index , a gauge
of consumer prices, increased 0.46 percent in the month through
mid-May after rising 0.51 percent in the previous period. The
median forecast of 35 economists surveyed by Bloomberg was for a
0.49 percent increase. The annual inflation rate fell to 6.46
percent from 6.49 percent at the end of April.  Brookfield added 4.4 percent to 1.90 reais. B2W climbed 3.4
percent to 11.39 reais.  Petrobras Declines  Voting shares of Petrobras slumped 3.5 percent to 18.69
reais. The Ibovespa pared gains as Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke 
said the central bank could “step down” the pace of asset
purchases at the next few meetings if the labor market continues
to improve.  “Markets didn’t react well to Bernanke’s remarks,” Joao Pedro Brugger, who helps manage 330 million reais at Leme
Investimentos, said by phone from Florianopolis, Brazil. “This
issue may weigh on the Ibovespa for some time, but it may not
last long. Brazilian equities have underperformed most markets
today, so room for further losses may be limited.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
