Linda Thompson, the Harrisburg mayor
who asked  Pennsylvania  to designate the state’s capital city as
fiscally distressed in 2010, lost her re-election bid in the
Democratic Party primary to a local bookstore owner.  Eric Papenfuse, 41, who owns the Midtown Scholar Bookstore,
won 37 percent of the vote with 26 of 28 precincts reporting,
according to the Associated Press. Thompson, 52, who became the
city’s first female and first black mayor in 2010, got 30.8
percent. City Controller Dan Miller, 56, had 30.9 percent.  The victor in the primary is expected to face Nevin
Mindlin, an independent, in November’s general election. In
Harrisburg, a city of about 50,000, about 75 percent of
registered voters are Democrats, according to data from
surrounding Dauphin County.  Harrisburg entered Pennsylvania’s program for distressed
cities, known as Act 47, in December 2010 because of an
incinerator project that doesn’t generate enough revenue to
cover its obligations. The debt burden of the venture is about
$350 million, almost seven times the city’s general-fund budget.
The fiscal strain led the state to put the city in receivership
in 2011, a first in Pennsylvania, after Thompson and the City
Council failed to agree on a recovery plan.  Harrisburg’s receiver, William B. Lynch, said he is
preparing a blueprint to restore the city to solvency that he
plans to submit for approval this month. It would entail the
sale of the incinerator, a lease of the municipal parking system
and labor savings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
