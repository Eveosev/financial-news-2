Palm oil  climbed to the highest level
in more than five weeks on speculation that an increase in
demand before the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan may cut
stockpiles in Malaysia, the second-largest producer.  The contract for August delivery rose as much as 1.2
percent to 2,363 ringgit ($783) a metric ton on the Bursa
Malaysia Derivatives, the highest price for most-active futures
since April 12, before trading at 2,362 ringgit at 4:14 p.m. in
 Kuala Lumpur .  The world’s most used edible oil may advance next month as
demand grows ahead of Ramadan, before resuming a decline, Dorab Mistry, director at Godrej International Ltd., said yesterday.
Purchases from the Middle East and  South Asia  usually climb
before Ramadan, which begins in July this year, when communal
meals boost total consumption.  “The strong demand will be from Ramadan stock-up and also
strong demand from the Northern Hemisphere because of warmer
weather,” said Alan Lim Seong Chun, an analyst at Kenanga
Investment Bank Bhd., referring to Europe and the U.S. where
demand drops in winter as palm oil clouds in cooler temperatures.
“Inventory will still decline in May.”  Stockpiles may drop for a fifth month to 1.84 million tons
in May as demand will outpace supply, said Lim. Reserves
declined 11 percent to 1.93 million tons last month, according
to the Malaysian Palm Oil Board.  Refined palm oil for September delivery advanced 0.9
percent to close at 6,104  yuan  ($995) a ton on the  Dalian
Commodity Exchange , while  soybean oil  climbed 1.3 percent to end
at 7,536 yuan. On the Chicago Board of Trade, soybeans for July
delivery were little changed at $14.7875 a bushel and soybean
oil for the same month rose 0.3 percent to 49.61 cents a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
