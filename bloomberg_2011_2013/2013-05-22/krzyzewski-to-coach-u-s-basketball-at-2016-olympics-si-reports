Mike Krzyzewski  decided to continue
as coach of the U.S. men’s basketball team that he’s led to 50
straight victories and will be pursuing a third straight gold
medal at the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.  The 66-year-old Krzyzewski, who has won four college
basketball championships over 32 seasons at  Duke University ,
previously said he wouldn’t return as coach for USA Basketball
for the 2013-16 cycle. He led the team to gold medals at the
2008 Olympics in Beijing and the 2012 Games in London.  “It is tough to give up something you’ve absolutely loved
doing for seven years, the people you’re doing it with, and most
importantly, the country you’re doing it for,” Krzyzewski said
in a statement. “There is no greater honor than to coach your
country’s team and to be afforded the unique opportunity to be
the national team coach three times is incredible. I do not take
that responsibility lightly.”  Krzyzewski has a 62-1 record with the U.S. team and will
also coach the squad at the 2014 world championship in  Madrid .  “We’ve seen the value of continuity and Coach K’s return
gives our national team program another four years of
continuity,” said Jerry Colangelo, who has been managing
director of the national team since 2005. “Together we have
been able to build on the program’s successes of each year and
again establish the  United States  as the world’s No. 1
basketball country.”  Krzyzewski and Colangelo joined USA Basketball after the
team’s bronze-medal finish at the 2004 Olympics, working
together to build a structure in which top players compete for
spots on the national team.  Winning Gold  The team’s gold medal at the 2008 Olympics was the first
for the U.S. in a major international competition since 2000.
From 2009 through 2012, the team compiled a 26-0 record,
including gold medals at the 2010 world championship and the
2012 Olympics, where  LeBron James  and  Kevin Durant  helped the
U.S. beat Spain in the title game.  This year’s first practices for the national team will be
conducted in July, with a three-day mini-camp in  Las Vegas .  Since first fielding a team of National Basketball
Association players at the 1992 Olympics, USA Basketball teams
have won gold medals in 12 of 15 major international
competitions, compiling a 117-7 record in tournament play.  To contact the reporter on this story:
