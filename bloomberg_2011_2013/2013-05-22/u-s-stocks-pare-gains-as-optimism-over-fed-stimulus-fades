U.S. stocks pared gains after earlier
optimism over central bank stimulus efforts faded.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.1 percent to
1,670.30 at 1:38 p.m. in New York.  Equities rallied as much as 1.1 percent earlier in the day
as Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben Bernanke  said in prepared
remarks to Congress that a premature withdrawal of stimulus
efforts would put the economic recovery at risk. Stocks pared
gains after he said the central bank could “step down” the
pace of asset purchases in the next few meetings if the labor
market continues to improve and “we have confidence that that is
going to be sustained.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
