The following is the text of
 Canada ’s retail sales report for March as released by
 Statistics Canada .  Retail sales were flat in March, holding at $39.5 billion.
After removing the effects of price changes, particularly lower
gasoline prices, retail sales in volume terms rose 0.7%.  Higher sales were reported in 6 of 11 subsectors,
representing 47% of total retail sales.  The largest increase in sales among all subsectors was a
3.1% rise at clothing and clothing accessories stores. Higher
sales at clothing stores led the gain, rising 3.5%, the third
increase in four months. Sales at shoe stores (+0.9%) advanced
for a fourth straight month. Following three consecutive monthly
declines, gains were reported by jewellery, luggage and leather
goods stores (+2.3%).  Sales at motor vehicle and parts dealers rose 0.7%, a third
consecutive monthly gain. Higher receipts at other  motor vehicle 
dealers (+6.1%) and at new car dealers (+0.3%) accounted for
most of the gain. The advance in sales in the “other motor
vehicle dealers” industry did not offset the decline in February.
This industry includes retailers of recreational vehicles,
motorcycles and boats.  Furniture and home furnishings stores posted a 0.3%
increase in sales, reflecting stronger sales at furniture stores
(+1.2%). Home furnishings stores (-1.0%) declined for a fourth
month in a row.  Sales at building material and garden equipment and
supplies dealers edged up 0.1%. Sales in this subsector have
been relatively flat since the middle of 2012.  Gasoline station sales decreased 1.3% in March, mainly
reflecting lower prices at the pump.  Following two consecutive monthly gains, sales at general
merchandise stores declined 0.6% in March. Weaker sales were
reported by department stores (-0.6%) and other general
merchandise stores (-0.6%).  The 0.9% decrease in receipts at electronics and appliance
stores did not offset the sales gain in February.  Sales up in six provinces  Retail sales rose in six provinces in March. Ontario
(+0.4%) reported the largest increase in dollar terms and a
third consecutive monthly sales gain. This increase was in part
the result of higher sales at new car dealers.  The 0.9% rise in sales in British Columbia was led by gains
at motor vehicle and parts dealers.  Receipts in  Quebec  (+0.4%) and  New Brunswick  (+1.2%) both
increased for a third straight month.  Retail sales in  Nova Scotia  (+0.6%) increased in March
after three consecutive monthly declines.  Following two consecutive monthly gains, retailers in
 Alberta  registered a 1.8% sales decline.  Retail sales in Saskatchewan (-1.7%) fell for a fourth
straight month in March, with widespread declines across
subsectors.  Note to readers  All the data in this release are seasonally adjusted and in
