Sugar output will exceed demand by 10
million metric tons in the 2012-13 season started in October in
most countries, the  International Sugar Organization  said.  World production will be a record 181.7 million tons with
all-time high output in Brazil,  Mexico  and the U.S., the London-based ISO said in an e-mailed report today. The surplus had been
estimated at 8.5 million tons. There may be another surplus of
at least 3.5 million tons in 2013-14 followed by a balance in
2014-15, ISO said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
