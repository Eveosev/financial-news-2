BRP Inc., the maker of Ski-Doo
snowmobiles, watercraft and all-terrain vehicles, raised C$262.3
million ($254.4 million) in the biggest Canadian IPO this year.  BRP sold 12.2 million shares for C$21.50 each, the
Valcourt, Quebec-based company said today in a statement. The
firm initially sought to sell shares for C$18.50 to C$21.50,
according to sale documents.  The IPO is  Canada ’s largest since  Hudson’s Bay Co. (HBC) , the
country’s oldest retailer, raised C$365 million in November.
Companies garnered about $1.1 billion in initial share sales in
Canada this year, excluding BRP, led by real estate investment
trusts, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  BRP  makes Sea-Doo personal watercraft, all-terrain vehicles
and motorcycles including the three-wheeled Can-Am Spyder
roadster, according to a regulatory filing last month. The
company will trade on the Toronto Stock Exchange under the
symbol DOO after the sale closes on May 29.  The company is a spinoff of  Bombardier Inc. (BBD/B) , which in 2003
sold its recreational products business to a group of investors
including Boston-based Bain Capital Partners LLC, members of the
Bombardier and Beaudoin families who are part of closely held
Beaudier Group, and Caisse de Depot et Placement du  Quebec ,
Canada’s largest pension-fund manager, according to the filing.  Bank of Montreal, Royal Bank of Canada, UBS AG and
Citigroup Inc. led the sale. The banks have an option to buy an
additional 15 percent of the offering after the sale is
completed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
