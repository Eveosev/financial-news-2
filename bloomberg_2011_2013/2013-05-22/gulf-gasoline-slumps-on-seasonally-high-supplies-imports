U.S.  Gulf Coast  gasoline extended its
 slump  for a sixth day after a government report showed area
inventories reached a  record high  for this time of year amid a
surge in imports. Crack spreads fluctuated.  Stockpiles of motor fuel on the Gulf Coast climbed 2.19
million barrels to  76.6 million  in the week ended May 17, the
most in any May week in records begun in 1990, according to U.S.
Energy Information Administration data. Imports to the region,
known as PADD 3,  jumped  to 185,000 barrels a day last week, the
most since May 20, 2011, the data showed.  “U.S. refineries have access to cheap West Texas
Intermediate, cheap natural gas to fuel the plants, and over the
last decade, there have been investments on units designed to
increase output,”  Kyle Cooper , director of research for IAF
Advisors, said in a phone interview from Houston. “That’s why
we’re seeing this situation exist. It’s somewhat bearish.”  The  discount  for conventional, 85-octane gasoline, or CBOB,
on the Gulf Coast widened 1.12 cents to 25.75 cents a gallon
versus  New York  Mercantile Exchange Futures at 12:05 p.m., the
lowest level since April 5.  Reformulated gasoline , known as
RBOB, was unchanged at 6.25 cents a gallon under futures.  West Texas Intermediate for July delivery fell $1.45 to
$94.73 a barrel at 12:11 p.m., widening its discount to
benchmark Brent oil to $8.34, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  New Equipment  Supplies may rise along the Gulf Coast after Motiva
Enterprises LLC ramped up a new crude unit that boosted the
capacity of its  Port Arthur, Texas, refinery  to 600,000 barrels
a day, making it the largest plant in the U.S.  Valero Energy Corp. (VLO)  brought a 57,000-barrel-a-day
hydrocracker online at its  Port Arthur  plant in December. The
company’s Houston plant was returning a fluid catalytic cracker
to planned rates early today after an “issue” yesterday,  Bill Day , a company spokesman in  San Antonio , said in an e-mail.  The 3-2-1  crack spread  on the Gulf Coast, a rough measure
of refining margins based on WTI in Cushing,  Oklahoma , was
little changed at $18.96 a barrel. The same spread based on
Light Louisiana Sweet oil gained 38 cents to $9.81 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
