KKR & Co. (KKR)  sold its 12 percent stake
in  Australia ’s largest free-to-air broadcaster  Seven West Media
Ltd. (SWM) , ending an investment that began in 2006.  KKR, the private equity firm run by Henry Kravis and  George Roberts , sold its entire holding at A$2.21 per share, Seven West
said in a regulatory statement today. That puts the value of the
holding at about A$261 million ($255 million), based on the 11.8
percent stake KKR declared at the time of the broadcaster’s July
2012 capital raising.  Seven West, controlled by billionaire Kerry Stokes via a
chairmanship and the 34 percent stake held by his investment
company  Seven Group Holdings Ltd. (SVW) , fell by the most in 11
months, slipping 7.9 percent to A$2.10 at the close in Sydney.
The company, which broadcasts Gator Boys and Grey’s Anatomy, has
gained 28 percent this year, compared with a 11 percent advance
for the benchmark S&P/ASX 200 Index.  “The pressure of funds as the term of the fund comes to an
end and Australian currency pressures” were cited by Seven West
in a separate statement announcing KKR’s decision to quit the
investment.  Justin Reizes, the head of KKR’s Australian business who
will remain on Seven West’s board until November, didn’t mention
the currency in the statement. He said the firm’s holding since
2006 was “at the longer end” of its favored five- to seven-year investment period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
