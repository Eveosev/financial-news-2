U.K. Deputy Prime Minister  Nick Clegg 
said he remains committed to introducing a register of lobbying
companies, indicating the plans have faltered after his
Conservative coalition partners blocked the move.  The commitment to introduce a statutory register of
lobbyists to increase government transparency was in the 2010
coalition agreement and in its midterm statement of intent in
2013. In February 2010, three months before he became prime
minister of the Conservative-led coalition,  David Cameron  said
lobbying was “the next big scandal waiting to happen.”  “There is nothing wrong with lobbying, there’s nothing
wrong with the idea that people want to make their views known
to decision-makers about what they think is the right or wrong
decision to take,” Clegg told reporters in  London  today. “I
just think it needs to be done not in the shadows but in the
bright light of transparency. That’s the point of a register.”  No bill to introduce the register was in the legislative
session set out by  Queen Elizabeth II  on behalf of her
government on May 8.  “It’s not something that we could get agreement on across
the coalition at the moment,” Clegg said. “I very much hope
that at some point we will.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
