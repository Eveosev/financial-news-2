India’s (SENSEX)  benchmark stock index ended a
two-day decline amid optimism overseas inflows into domestic
shares will continue after the Bank of  Japan  maintained its
monetary easing plan.  The S&P BSE Sensex added 0.2 percent to 20,146.31 at 11:57
a.m. in Mumbai.  State Bank of India (SBIN) , the nation’s largest
lender, climbed 1.5 percent, its first gain in three days.  Coal
India Ltd. (COAL) , the world’s largest producer of the fuel, advanced
for a third day to head for a more than two-week high.  The BOJ affirmed today a plan to double the monetary base
over two years after a jump in bond yields highlighted risks
associated with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s campaign to revive
the economy. Monetary easing by central banks from Europe to the
U.S. and Japan has stoked inflows into  emerging markets 
including  India , with overseas funds buying a net $13.7 billion
of the nation’s shares in 2013, a record for the period, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  “The value of money is very cheap now, and we are seeing
enough global liquidity thanks to the U.S. Federal Reserve and
Bank of Japan,” Madhav Dhar, managing partner of U.S.- based
GTI Capital Group, said on Bloomberg TV India today.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index returned to a record
yesterday and the MSCI Asia Pacific Index rose to a five-year
high today after a Federal Reserve official said bond purchases
should continue and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. forecast a rally in
U.S. stocks will last at least through 2015.  Fund Inflows  The Sensex climbed last week to its highest level since
Jan. 5, 2011, and has rebounded 11 percent since slumping to a
seven-month low on April 9, as foreign funds extended  equity
purchases  amid easing by global central banks. Foreigners were
net buyers of Indian equities for a  22nd day  on May 20, the
longest such run since the 35 days through Feb. 15, data from
the market regulator show.  State Bank climbed 1.5 percent to 2,397 rupees.  ICICI Bank
Ltd. (ICICIBC) , India’s largest private lender, added 0.8 percent to
1,220.35 rupees. The two stocks contributed  the most  to the
Sensex’s advance. Coal India jumped 2 percent to 313.65 rupees,
poised for its highest close since May 6.  Foreign inflows have accelerated since the Reserve Bank of
India pared interest  rates  on May 3. The flows have helped the
Sensex  climb  3.7 percent this year, the most among benchmark
measures in the BRIC group of the largest emerging nations. The
Indian gauge trades at 13.9 times  projected 12-month profits ,
near the highest level since October. The MSCI Emerging Markets
Index trades at 10.7 times.  Earnings Scorecard  Larsen & Toubro Ltd. (LT) , India’s biggest engineering company,
