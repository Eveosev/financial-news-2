Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and
Minority Leader Mitch McConnell reported their net worth in the
millions of dollars as the U.S. Senate released personal
financial disclosure reports for its members.  Reid, a Nevada Democrat, reported assets of between $2.8
million and $6.3 million, including mining claims in his
hometown of Searchlight valued from $100,000 to $250,000.  Kentucky Republican McConnell and his wife, Elaine Chao,
who served as U.S. labor secretary under former President George W. Bush, had assets of between $9.2 million and $36.5 million.
Chao’s income included fees from sitting on corporate boards,
including Rupert Murdoch’s  News Corp. (NWSA)  and  Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC)   Lawmakers, required to disclose their financial assets once
a year, report their holdings in broad ranges. Most Senate
Democratic and Republican leaders reported assets with upper
ranges of at least $1 million.  The chamber’s third-ranking Democrat, Charles Schumer of
New York, reported that his wife, Iris Weinshall, a City
University of New York vice chancellor, earned more than he did
last year. Her salary was $234,368 while his was $172,887. They
reported assets of between $368,000 and $1 million.  The Senate Democratic Conference secretary, Patty Murray of
 Washington , reported with her husband assets of between $565,000
and $1.5 million.  Senate Majority Whip Richard Durbin of  Illinois  received an
extension of the May 15 filing deadline.  Credit-Card Debt  On the Republican side, Minority Whip John Cornyn of  Texas 
reported assets of between $460,000 and $1.4 million, and a
credit-card debt of between $15,000 and $50,000. Cornyn, a
former Texas attorney general and a former judge on the Texas
Supreme Court judge, received $58,939 from two state retirement
funds.  Policy Committee Chairman John Barrasso, a Wyoming
Republican, reported assets of between $2.7 million and $8.6
million. An orthopedic surgeon, he received between $500,000 and
$1 million from the sale of his medical practice, and was paid
$33,391 from the medical partnership he was part of.  Republican Conference Chairman John Thune of South Dakota
reported assets of between $173,000 and $596,000.  Richer members of the chamber include Senate Commerce
Committee Chairman Jay Rockefeller, a West Virginia Democrat. He
reported at least $89 million in assets; a more precise number
is unavailable because he listed his largest holding as more
than $50 million.  Wisconsin Republican Ron Johnson, who founded a plastics
company, reported assets between $9.2 million and $39.7 million.
Johnson reported owning a 5 percent interest in the company,
valued at $4.5 million.  Rubio’s Royalties  On the other hand, Senator Marco Rubio of  Florida  reported
a potentially negative net worth, with assets of between
$259,000 and $860,000 and liabilities of between $450,000 and $1
million. Rubio, a prospective 2016 Republican presidential
candidate, received $800,000 in royalties from Penguin Group USA
Inc. for his 2012 memoir, “An American Son.”  He paid off his remaining student loans of between $100,000
and $250,000.  “When I finished school, I owed over $100,000 in student
loans, a debt I paid off just a few months ago,” Rubio said in
February as he delivered the official Republican response to
President  Barack Obama ’s  State of the Union  address.  The youngest U.S. senator, freshman Democrat Chris Murphy
of  Connecticut , and his wife each owed between $15,000 and
$50,000 in student loans, his report showed. Murphy, 39,
reported assets of between $70,000 and $225,000.  Warren’s Holdings  Freshman Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat
and Harvard University emeritus professor, and her husband Bruce
Mann, a Harvard law professor, reported assets of between $3.8
million and $10.2 million. Most of it was in TIAA-CREF funds,
including one valued at between $1 million and $5 million.  Warren received $59,417 from Aspen Publishers for a series
of books, including “Bankruptcy and Article 9” and “Secured
Credit: A Systems Approach,” and $103 in royalties from Yale
University Press for “The Fragile Middle Class.”  Senator Ted Cruz, a Texas Republican elected last November,
took a pay cut to come to Washington. He was paid $1 million
last year by his law firm. He reported assets of between $2.2
million and $5.1 million, including an $843,000 loan to his
campaign as of Dec. 31, 2012.  Liabilities include a  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  margin loan
of between $250,000 and $500,000.  Senator  Rand Paul , a Kentucky Republican also mentioned as
a possible 2016 presidential contender, received an extension of
the deadline to file.  To contact the reporters on this story:
