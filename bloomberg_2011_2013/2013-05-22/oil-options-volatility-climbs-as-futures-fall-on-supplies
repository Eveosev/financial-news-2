Crude oil options volatility climbed
as West Texas Intermediate fell after a government report showed
U.S.  stockpiles  declined less than expected.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
July, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 21.7 percent at 2:35 p.m. on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange , up from 20.56 yesterday.  West Texas Intermediate crude for July delivery retreated
$1.90 to settle at $94.28 a barrel on the Nymex. The futures
slid after U.S. Energy Information Administration data showed
crude supplies dropped 338,000 barrels to  394.6 million , less
than half as much as projected.  The most-active options in electronic trading today were
July $85 puts, which rose 11 cents to 29 cents a barrel on
volume of 3,492 contracts. July $90 puts were the second-most
active with 3,161 lots. They gained 37 cents to 91 cents a
barrel.  Puts, or bets that prices will fall, made up 54 percent of
electronic trading volume today. Bearish bets accounted for 63
percent of yesterdayâ€™s volume of 87,685 contracts.  July $90 puts were the most-active options traded in the
previous session as they increased 4 cents to 56 cents a barrel
on volume of 4,712 contracts. July $85 puts were unchanged at 18
cents a barrel as 4,311 lots exchanged hands.  Open interest was highest for July $90 puts with 42,208
contracts. Next were December $105 calls with 38,274 lots and
July $110 calls with 34,924.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on open-outcry volume, where the bulk of options activity occurs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
