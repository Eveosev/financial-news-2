The  Cleveland Cavaliers  have the
right to make the first selection in the June 27 National
Basketball Association draft after winning the lottery for the
second time in three seasons.  “We said all along we wanted to build this team primarily
through the draft,” said owner  Dan Gilbert , who lost  LeBron James  as a free agent to the  Miami Heat  in 2010.  The Cavaliers selected point guard Kyrie Irving with the
top pick in the 2011 draft. He has a career average of 20.6
points per game and was chosen as the NBA Rookie of the Year for
the 2011-12 season.  “We said to build the kind of core we want we have to
focus on a handful of strong, talented people and build around
them,” Gilbert said in a conference call with reporters. “Then
we look at trades and free agency.”  Gilbert said he wasn’t ready to disclose who the first pick
will be for the Cavaliers. He said there was “no clear-cut, no-holds-barred No. 1 choice.”  Kentucky center Nerlens Noel, guard Ben McLemore of  Kansas 
and Nevada-Las Vegas forward Anthony Bennett are among players
predicted as the possible top pick.  The Orlando Magic, who had the NBA’s worst record this
season at 20-62, earned the right to pick second and the
 Washington Wizards  are slotted to select third.  The draft lottery is held each year among the 14 teams that
don’t make the playoffs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
