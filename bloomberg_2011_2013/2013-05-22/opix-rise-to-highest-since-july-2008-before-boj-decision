Japan ’s  Topix Index (TPX)  extended a 4 1/2-year high, as Sojitz Corp. jumped and  Sony Corp. (6758)  rose to its
highest in more than two years. Shares held gains after the  Bank
of Japan  upgraded its economic assessment while keeping policy
unchanged.  Sojitz Corp. surged 13 percent after the Nikkei newspaper
said the trading company’s pretax profit will probably rise 30
percent next fiscal year. Sony advanced 5.9 percent after
reports the electronic maker’s board may discuss spinning off
its entertainment unit. ANA Holdings Inc. led airlines higher on
a report  Tokyo ’s Haneda airport will complete a runway expansion
early.  Tokyo Electric  Power Co. slumped after surging 59 percent
in the last four days.  The Topix rose 0.4 percent to 1,276.03 at the close of
trading in Tokyo. About eight shares fell for every seven that
rose. The  Nikkei 225  Stock Average climbed 1.6 percent to
15,627.26, with volume 54 percent above its 30-day average.  “The momentum rally will continue,” said Masahiko Ejiri,
a Tokyo-based  fund manager  for Mizuho Asset Management Co.,
which oversees about $45 billion. “Even some of the
conservative pension funds are afraid they’ll underperform their
peers so they’re shifting back into domestic equities.”  The Topix and Nikkei 225 have risen about 50 percent this
year, outperforming all major equity indexes amid unprecedented
BOJ easing. The Topix traded at 1.4 times  book value , compared
with about 2.5 for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 1.7 for
the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  BOJ Upgrade  The BOJ upgraded its assessment of the economy today, while
maintaining a plan to expand the monetary base by 60 to 70
trillion yen annually. The bank made no reference to the recent
jump in Japanese government bond yields.  Sojitz was the second-best performer on the Nikkei 225,
surging 13 percent to 224 yen, its biggest jump since October
2008. Profit before tax will probably reach 60 billion yen next
fiscal year, 30 percent above its forecast for this year, the
Nikkei reported, without citing anyone.  Mitsumi Electric Co. gained the most on the gauge,
advancing 13 percent to 831 yen. Nomura Holdings Inc. raised its
price target on the stock after the partsmaker this month
forecast a return to profit. Shares have risen almost 50 percent
in May.  Sony provided the biggest boost to the Topix today,
advancing 5.9 percent to 2,290 yen. The company’s board will
evaluate a proposal by activist shareholder  Daniel Loeb  to take
part of its entertainment business public, according to a person
familiar with the matter.  More Runways  Airlines rose the most among the Topix’s 33  industry groups 
today after the Nikkei reported Tokyo’s Haneda airport may
finish a runway expansion early, allowing for an increase in
flights.  ANA, Japan’s second-biggest airline by market value, led
the gains, rising gained 6.3 percent to 237 yen. Japan Airlines
Co., the biggest, climbed 4.6 percent to 5,260 yen.  Tokyo Electric fell 9.6 percent to 737 yen. Shares surged
296 percent this year through yesterday, the most among the
2,428 securities in the MSCI All-Country World Index, even as
the utility said it won’t pay a dividend and may face $107
billion in clean-up costs after the Fukushima disaster.  A gauge of Topix utility shares has almost doubled since
mid-November when it became clear the  Liberal Democratic Party ,
a longtime advocate of nuclear energy, would regain power.  To contact the reporters on this story:
