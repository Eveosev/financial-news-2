President  Barack Obama  will visit
Moore,  Oklahoma , May 26 to view damage and meet with survivors
of the tornado that ripped through the town earlier this week,
White House press secretary Jay Carney said.  The mile-wide tornado killed 24 people, including 10
children, and injured 237 as it cut through the Oklahoma City
suburbs, destroying a school, a hospital and hundreds of houses.  The May 20 tornado was an EF5, the most powerful on the
Enhanced Fujita scale, according to the National Weather Service
in Norman.  Obama yesterday declared a major disaster in five counties,
clearing the way for federal aid.  To contact the reporter on this story:
