Great Portland Estates Plc (GPOR) , the real
estate developer focused on London’s West End, said full-year
profit rose 16 percent as the value of its properties increased.  Net income for the year through March climbed to 180.6
million pounds ($273 million), or 55.7 pence a share, from 155.2
million pounds, or 50.2 pence, a year earlier, the London-based
company said today in a statement. That beat 153.2 million
pounds, the average of nine estimates in a Bloomberg survey.  “Conditions in our central London markets remain
supportive,” Chief Executive Officer Toby Courtauld said in the
statement. “Given the continued scarcity of finance for
speculative development, we can look forward to healthy rates of
rental growth in selected  London  sub-markets.”  Net asset value rose 10.7 percent to 1.5 billion pounds as
demand increased for office space in central London. The company
earlier this week said it agreed to rent all of its 142,500
square-foot (13,200 square-meter) Fetter Lane office development
in advance to law firm Bird & Bird.  The value of Great Portland’s sites is being boosted by a
lack of competing projects as finance for new building remains
scarce in the U.K., the company said in January.  The company will pay a full-year dividend of 8.6 pence a
share, up from 8.4 pence a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
