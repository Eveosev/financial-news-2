Toronto Mayor Rob Ford’s brother Doug
said media reports that the head of  Canada ’s largest city used
cocaine are untrue.  “Our mayor faces yet another accusation, an accusation
driven by questionable reporting,” Doug Ford told reporters at
city hall today. “Rob is telling me these stories are untrue,
that these accusations are ridiculous, and I believe him.”  The Toronto Star reported that two of its reporters watched
a video allegedly showing Mayor Ford inhaling from a crack
cocaine pipe. Bloomberg News has not seen the video and can’t
verify its authenticity.  “I’m not speaking for the mayor. The mayor is my brother.
I love him and he’ll speak for himself,” said Doug Ford, who is
a city councilor. “My brother is an honest and hard-working man
with integrity, a man who has dedicated his life to serving
others.”  Rob Ford, 43, spoke briefly to reporters on May 17, calling
the video reports “ridiculous.” He had said the story in the
Toronto Star is another example of the newspaper “going after
me.” The mayor has ignored questions from reporters on whether
the video was doctored, if he has ever used crack cocaine, and
if it was him in the video.  The Toronto Police say they are reviewing allegations
against the mayor.  To contact the reporter on this story:
