China’s growing fleet of  sport
utility vehicles  will offset gains in  fuel efficiency  and
continue to drive oil-demand growth, according to Sanford C.
Bernstein Research.  Chinese oil consumption will increase at an average annual
pace of 5 percent to reach 12.9 million barrels a day in 2018,
from 9.6 million barrels a day in 2012, the investment research
company said in a report e-mailed today. Its forecast is higher
than the  International Energy Agency ’s outlook for a 4 percent
average annual increase for the same period.  The proportion of SUVs in the Chinese passenger fleet
should double to 20 percent in 2020 from its current size, and
the total number of vehicles should also double to more than 220
million at the end of the decade, Bernstein said.  As oil demand shifts to transport from industry, gasoline
consumption has grown 15 percent year-to-date, while diesel use
decreased 1.8 percent, it said.  “While  China  used to be a net importer of diesel and
exporter of gasoline, we see this reversing,” Bernstein said.
“With China’s refineries increasingly configured to meet
gasoline demand, we see China increasingly being long diesel,
which has negative implications for the region’s refineries.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
