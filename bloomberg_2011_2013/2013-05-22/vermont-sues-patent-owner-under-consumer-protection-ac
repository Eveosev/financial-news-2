Vermont  sued a patent owner, accusing
it of violating the state’s Consumer Protection Act and saying
it’s the first state to file such a complaint against a company
whose business is suing for patent infringement.  The  state sued  MPHJ Technology, which it said sent letters
to small businesses in Vermont demanding money because of
alleged violations of the company’s patent on technology for
scanning documents and attaching them to e-mail, according to a
statement today from state Attorney General William Sorrell.  In its announcement, the state referred to MPHJ as a
“patent troll,” a term sometimes applied to a company or
individual whose principal business is demanding royalties on
patents it owns from business it accuses of infringement.  “Patent trolling is a national problem,” the attorney
general’s office said in the news release. “A recent major
study out of  Boston University  estimated the cost of patent
trolling on the  U.S. economy  at $29 billion in 2011 alone.”  MPHJ demanded $1,000 in damages per company employee in its
letters, according to the statement.  Efforts to reach MPHJ weren’t immediately successful.  The case is State of Vermont v. MPHJ Technology 
Investments LLC, 282-5-13, State of Vermont, Superior Court, 
Washington Unit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
