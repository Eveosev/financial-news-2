Voters in Los Angeles, which has so
many medical-marijuana shops that officials have lost count,
approved a plan to limit their number and raise their taxes.  The measure to cap the number of clinics at 135 got 63
percent of the vote with 100 percent of precincts reporting,
according to unofficial results on the city’s website. Two
competing proposals offered by the industry headed to defeat.  “The city attorney’s office is gratified that the voters
enacted a measure that provides both patient access and also
protection to neighborhoods,” Jane Usher, special assistant
city attorney, said today in an interview. “We’re looking
forward to a high level of voluntary compliance from the
dispensary community in Los Angeles.”  The nation’s second-largest city by population is among
California municipalities that are struggling to put
restrictions on pot sales for medicinal uses. Starting in 2007,
more than 850 businesses opened, closed and reopened shops and
commercial-growing operations in Los Angeles without zoning
approval, according to the proposal that won.  Proposition D, the city’s plan, would cap dispensaries at
135, the number operating before a 2007 moratorium took effect.
The measure also would raise taxes on the businesses to $60 from
$50 for each $1,000 of gross receipts.  Tax Haul  Los Angeles got $2.5 million in business taxes from
medical-marijuana collectives in 2012, according to Miguel Santana, the city administrative officer.  About 82,200 ballots still had to be counted, said Kimberly
Briggs, a spokeswoman for the city clerk’s election division.
That’s almost 22 percent of those  cast .  Initiative Ordinance F, which was losing 59 percent to 41
percent, would have allowed unlimited dispensaries and increased
their taxes to $60 from $50 on each $1,000 of gross receipts.
Initiative Ordinance E, failing 65 percent to 35 percent, would
have banned dispensaries that opened since the moratorium.  To contact the reporter on this story:
