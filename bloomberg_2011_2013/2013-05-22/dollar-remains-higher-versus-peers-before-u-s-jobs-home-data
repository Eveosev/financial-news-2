The  Dollar Index  declined for the
first time in three days as a survey of the  Federal Reserve ’s
primary dealers said confusion about the central bank’s
intentions for its bond-buying program may be hurting the
effort’s effectiveness.  The yen climbed the most since February versus the dollar
as risk appetite shrank and Japanese stocks slid after a
technical signal they had gained too much, too fast.  Japan ’s
currency rose versus all of its 16 most-traded peers as data
showed  China ’s manufacturing contracted this month. The Swiss
franc climbed the most against the euro since the central bank
imposed a cap in 2011. European Central Bank President  Mario
Draghi  is scheduled to speak in  London  at 10:30 p.m. local time.  “Certainly to me, the Fed rhetoric has been mixed; it’s
been inconsistent,”  Eric Stein , a Boston-based portfolio
manager at Eaton Vance Management, said in a telephone
interview. “Maybe what the Fed is doing now is, they’re getting
more volatility now based on Fed commentary and economic data
than maybe they’ll get when the actual move is made. Sometimes
it’s not the move, but the anticipation of the move.”  The Dollar Index, which Intercontinental Exchange Inc. uses
to track the greenback against currencies of six major U.S.
trading partners, fell 0.7 percent to 83.744 at 5 p.m. in  New
York  after climbing earlier to 84.498, the highest level since
July 2010.  The yen strengthened 1.1 percent to 102.02 per dollar after
climbing as much as 2.3 percent, the most since Feb. 25. It slid
to 103.74 yesterday, the weakest since October 2008. Japan’s
currency rose 0.5 percent to 131.94 per euro. The dollar dropped
0.6 percent to $1.2934 per euro.  Bernanke Testimony  The currency gauge erased gains it made yesterday after Fed
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said in testimony to the Joint Economic
Committee of Congress the central bank may taper monthly bond
purchases at its next few meetings if it’s confident of
sustained gains in the economy. Bernanke also told lawmakers
premature tightening of policy may endanger the recovery.  A diversity of Fed speakers expressing different views has
left securities dealers unsure of the  Federal Open Market
Committee ’s intentions, according to survey results released
today by the Fed Bank of New York and considered at policy
makers’ last meeting. Primary dealers trade directly with the
U.S. central bank.  “Some dealers noted that the dispersion of views expressed
by FOMC participants as to how the FOMC would make decisions
regarding the future pace of asset purchases has decreased
clarity around the program,” the survey said.  Options Trading  Trading in over-the-counter foreign-exchange options
totaled $42 billion, compared with $53 billion yesterday,
according to data reported by U.S. banks to the Depository Trust
Clearing Corp. and tracked by Bloomberg. Volume in options on
the dollar-yen  exchange rate  was $12 billion, the largest share
of trades at 29 percent. Euro-dollar options were the second
most-actively traded, at $4 billion, or 10 percent.  Dollar-yen options trading was 49 percent above the average
for the past five Thursdays at a similar time in the day,
according to Bloomberg analysis. Euro-dollar options trading was
11 percent above average.  The yen tumbled as Japan’s  Nikkei 225 (NKY)   stock  gauge slid 7.3
percent after closing yesterday at the highest since 2007. The
index’s 14-day relative strength index climbed yesterday to
82.6, exceeding the 70 level some traders see as a signal an
asset has increased too far, too quickly.  Price Action  “It was more so some price action that moved the yen, and
the fundamentals that we got after fit into that narrative,”
Brian Kim, a foreign-exchange strategist at Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc’s RBS Securities unit in  Stamford ,
 Connecticut , said in a telephone interview. “People are still
looking for a weaker yen.”  Yields (GJGB10)  on Japan’s 10-year government bonds reached 0.996
percent, a 13-month high, before trading at 0.86 percent.  The yen slumped 18 percent in the past six months against
nine developed-nation peers tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes as Prime Minister Shinzo Abe pledged to beat
deflation and the  Bank of Japan  doubled monthly bond purchases.
The euro gained 3.9 percent, and the dollar rose 4 percent.  A gauge of Chinese factory output declined to 49.6 in May
from 50.4 the previous month, HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit
Economics said today. Readings below 50 indicate contraction.  “There’s been a violent move in the yen today on the back
of the drop in stocks,” said Kasper Kirkegaard, a senior
currency strategist at Danske Bank A/S in Copenhagen. “People
are also starting to question the sustainability of the recent
improvement in China. There’s definitely potential for more
short-term noise.”  Franc Climbs  The Swiss franc rose as the prospect of a reduction in U.S.
monetary stimulus boosted demand for haven assets.  The currency appreciated 0.4 percent to 1.2532 per euro and
gained as much as 1.3 percent, the most since Sept. 5, 2011. The
 Swiss National Bank  imposed a cap of 1.20 francs per euro on
Sept. 6, 2011, to protect exporters. The franc strengthened 1
percent against the dollar today to 96.88 centimes.  The franc slid to 1.2650 per euro yesterday, the weakest
since May 2011, as SNB President Thomas Jordan said a shift of
the currency cap was in the SNB’s toolkit.  South Africa’s rand erased losses, snapping a 10-day losing
streak that was its longest since June 2008, after the nation’s
central bank kept its benchmark  interest rate  unchanged at 5
percent. The currency gained 0.5 percent to 9.5285 per dollar
after falling 1.3 percent to 9.6948, the weakest since 2009.  Australia ’s dollar rose 0.5 percent to 97.50 U.S. cents
after sliding 1.1 percent to 95.94, the lowest since June 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
