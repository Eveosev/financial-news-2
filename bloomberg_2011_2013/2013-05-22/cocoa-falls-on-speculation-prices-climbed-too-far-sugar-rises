Cocoa fell in  London  and  New York  on
speculation prices that rallied yesterday climbed too far as
rainfall may favor crop development in West Africa, the main
growing region. Raw sugar rose in New York.  Cocoa gained 2 percent in London and 1.9 percent in New
York yesterday as the pound fell to a six-week low against the
dollar after a report showed U.K. inflation slowed more in April
than economists forecast. Cocoa growing areas in West Africa got
widespread rainfall last week, with the heaviest amounts over
southwestern Cameroon and southern  Ivory Coast , MDA Weather
Services, in Gaithersburg,  Maryland , said in a report e-mailed
yesterday.  “Cocoa prices recovered in New York as a break in the
British pound sponsored some buying pressure in London,”
Sterling Smith, an analyst at Citigroup Inc. in  Chicago , said in
a report e-mailed yesterday. “With no pressing weather issues,
we have reservations about this near-term strength.”  Cocoa for delivery in July fell 0.2 percent to 1,566 pounds
($2,365) a ton by 11:36 a.m. on NYSE Liffe in London. Cocoa for
July delivery retreated 0.6 percent to $2,330 a ton on ICE
Futures U.S. in New York.  U.K. consumer prices rose 2.4 percent from a year earlier,
compared with 2.8 percent in March, according to the  Office for
National Statistics . The median forecast of 35 economists in a
Bloomberg News survey was 2.6 percent. The pound fell as much as
0.9 percent to $1.5113, the lowest since April 4.  Robusta coffee futures for July delivery were little
changed at $2,010 a ton in London. Arabica coffee futures for
July delivery fell 0.4 percent to $1.3215 a pound in New York.  White, or refined, sugar for delivery in August was
unchanged at $476.30 a ton on NYSE Liffe. Raw sugar for delivery
in July rose 0.2 percent to 16.89 cents a pound on ICE. The
sweetener has dropped 9 percent in London and 13 percent in New
York this year.  “Sugar prices are likely to stay under pressure as the
Brazilian crop is gathering speed,” F.O. Licht said in a report
dated yesterday. “The fact that millers in the center south
continue to concentrate on sugar instead of ethanol as was
generally expected, is undermining sentiment further.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
