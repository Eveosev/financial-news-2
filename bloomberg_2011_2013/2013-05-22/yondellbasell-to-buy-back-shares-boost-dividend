LyondellBasell Industries NV (LYB) , the
world’s largest producer of polypropylene, plans to repurchase
as much as 10 percent of company shares and increased the
quarterly dividend as low-cost raw materials boost cash
generation.  Company directors authorized the buybacks after the plan
was approved by shareholders at the annual general meeting in
Rotterdam, where the company is based, LyondellBasell said today
in a statement. The quarterly dividend will increase 25 percent
to 50 cents a share, said LyondellBasell, which is run from
Houston.  Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Jim Gallogly is
investing in added production of ethylene and plastics to take
advantage of low-cost natural gas liquids that helped boost cash
from operations by 67 percent last year to  $4.79 billion . The
repurchase of 10 percent of the 575.3 million shares outstanding
would cost $3.74 billion at the $65.07 closing price in  New
York .  “The 10 percent share repurchase program and the
significant increase in the regular interim dividend is
reflective of our outlook, capital growth program, strong free
cash flow profile,” Gallogly said in the statement.  The buyback was announced after the close of regular
trading in New York, where LyondellBasell rose 1.9 percent to
$66.29 at 4:34 p.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
