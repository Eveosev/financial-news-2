Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., which
is gathering money for its next payment to creditors, said it
received bids of almost $1.9 billion at an auction for $4.2
billion of claims on its defunct brokerage, Lehman Brothers Inc.  The rights to money from the brokerage arose from a
 settlement  that won court approval last month, and hasn’t yet
been completed, Lehman said in a statement today. The former
investment bank has said it aimed to sell a total of $14 billion
in unsecured claims against its brokerage affiliate.  In addition to the unsecured claims, valued by bidders at
44.5 cents on the dollar, the accord provided the parent company
with $2.3 billion in customer claims on the brokerage, Lehman
has said. The brokerage trustee has said he has enough money to
pay customers in full.  Lehman, which is still liquidating after exiting bankruptcy
court protection last year, made a third payment to creditors on
April 4.  Under an agreement disclosed in February, and following the
outlines of a deal struck in October, the brokerage allowed the
parent to claim about $16.3 billion and granted affiliate Lehman
Brothers International Europe a $7.5 billion customer claim and
a $4 billion general estate claim.  Lehman failed in September 2008, filing the biggest
bankruptcy in U.S. history, because of too much debt and risky
real estate investments, according to an examiner’s report.  The main case is In re Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., 08-13555, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
( Manhattan ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
