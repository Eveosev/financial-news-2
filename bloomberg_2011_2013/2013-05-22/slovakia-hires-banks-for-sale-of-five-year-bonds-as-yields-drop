Slovakia hired three domestic banks
to manage the sale of new five-year bonds after yields fell near
a record low, the government’s debt agency said.  KBC Groep NV (KBC) ’s Ceskoslovenska Obchodna Banka AS, Raiffeisen
Group’s Tatra Banka AS and Vseobecna Uverova Banka AS, a unit of
 Intesa Sanpaolo SpA (ISP) , will manage the offering, which is planned
in the near future if market conditions permit, the agency said
in an e-mailed statement from Bratislava, the Slovak capital
today.  Slovakia, which adopted the euro in 2009, is benefiting
from rising demand for bonds fueled by monetary easing across
the globe, which pushed down the yield on its 2021 euro-denominated bonds to 1.87 percent.  The country is rated A2, the fifth-lowest investment grade,
by Moody’s Investors Service and A by  Standard & Poor’s . The
government plans to cut the  budget deficit  below 3 percent of
gross domestic product as early as this year even as economic
growth is set to slow to 1 percent.  The government has raised 5.8 billion euros ($7.5 billion)
this year, meeting 70 percent of 2013 borrowing needs. It has 6
billion euros of debt due within one year, out of a total of
36.2 billion euros, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
