NIC Bank Ltd., the third-best
performing stock among Kenyan lenders this year, dropped the
most in almost seven weeks on a signal that its 45 percent rally
in 2013 may be overdone.  The stock fell 1.8 percent to 55.50 shillings by the close
in the capital, Nairobi, the largest decline since April 5.
Trading volume was 46 percent of the three-month daily average,
with 55,300 shares changing hands.  NIC’s gain, which outpaces a 35 percent rise in the  Nairobi
Securities Exchange All-Share Index (NSEASI) , pushed the company’s 14-day
 relative strength index  above 70 on May 17, where it held until
retreating to 62.6 today, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. A reading above 70 signals that the stock is poised
to fall.  “It has gained quite a bit of late, it looks overbought,”
Davis Mika, an analyst at Nairobi-based Contrarian Investing
Kenya Ltd., said by phone.  Net income in the three months through March advanced to
867.8 million shillings ($10 million) from 723 million shillings
a year earlier, NIC said on April 30. Net interest income, the
money banks make from loans, advanced 42 percent to 1.68 billion
shillings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
