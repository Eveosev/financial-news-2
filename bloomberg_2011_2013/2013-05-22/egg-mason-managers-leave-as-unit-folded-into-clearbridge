Legg Mason Inc.’s (LM)  Mary Chris Gay, a
portfolio manager at the division that was home to  Bill Miller ,
has left as her unit is folded into the firm’s ClearBridge
Investments equity affiliate after a decline in assets.  Gay, who ran the  Legg Mason Capital Management Value Fund (VALUFND) 
domiciled in Ireland, left May 15, Mary Athridge, a spokeswoman
for Baltimore-based Legg Mason, said today in an e-mail. Randy
Befumo, head of research at Legg Mason Capital Management, also
left last week, Athridge said.  Legg Mason said in January it was folding the Legg Mason
Capital Management division into ClearBridge Investments as
assets tumbled. Miller, famed for beating the Standard & Poor’s
500 Index for a record 15 years before his streak ended in 2006,
stepped down last year from his  Legg Mason Capital Management
Value Trust (LMVTX)  fund, while staying as manager of Opportunity Trust
fund.  The Value Fund previously managed by Gay, which is modeled
on the U.S.-domiciled $2.4 billion Value Trust fund, will now be
run by  Sam Peters . Peters also manages the Value Trust fund
formerly run by Miller. The Value Fund has returned 30 percent
in the past year, ahead of 67 percent of peers, and the Value
Trust fund has gained 32 percent, beating 52 percent of rivals,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Legg Mason, led by Chief Executive Officer Joseph A.
Sullivan, is reviewing its business and relationships with
affiliates as it enters its sixth year of client redemptions.  Gay’s departure was reported earlier today by Investment
Week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
