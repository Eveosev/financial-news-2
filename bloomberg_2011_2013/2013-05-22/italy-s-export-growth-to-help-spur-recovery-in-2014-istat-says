Italian exports will record almost
double-digit growth through 2014, helping the euro region’s
third-biggest economy recover next year, National Statistics
Institute Istat said.  Sales abroad of Italian goods and services will increase
9.7 percent in the two-year period, Rome-based Istat said today
in its annual report. Exports of manufactured goods will advance
10 percent, with sales of services forecast to rise 7.5 percent,
according to the report based on projections by Sace SpA,
 Italy ’s trade-credit insurer.  Italy will contract 1.4 percent in 2013, Istat said in a
report earlier this month, with household spending and corporate
investments both projected to decline. It also forecast that the
economy, which entered a recession in the third quarter of 2011,
will return to annual growth in 2014 when gross domestic product
is seen rising 0.7 percent.  Istat’s GDP forecasts are less optimistic than those of the
European Commission, which expects a 1.3 percent contraction for
Italy this year and growth of 0.7 percent in 2014. The
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said May 2
that Italy’s GDP will shrink 1.5 percent this year and expand
0.5 percent next in 2014.  The rise in exports this year and in 2014 will add 1
percent growth to the country’s GDP in the two years through
2014, Istat said.  While Italy’s GDP fell 2.4 percent last year, exports
increased 2.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
