The  Kenya National Highways Authority 
began processing trucks that had blocked the road to and from
Mombasa, the countryâ€™s main port, in a dispute over cargo-weighing procedures.  Truckers obstructed the road in recent days in an attempt
to pressure the authority to assess trucks based on gross weight
rather than axle load, Meshack Kidenda, head of the authority,
said today in the capital, Nairobi. Vehicles with a gross weight
of as much as 48 metric tons will now be cleared through a weigh
station for a 90-day period, backdated to May 14, Kidenda said,
after which the axle-load measure will be used again.  Over 96 percent of cargo at the port is moved by trucks and
land-locked nations including Uganda, Rwanda and Burundi rely on
the port. The truckers favor the use of gross weight because it
allows them to carry more goods, while the authority prefers the
axle measure because that reduces overloading and damage to
highways.  The stand-off at the Mariakani weigh bridge delayed
clearance of cargo at the port and some trucking companies
increased charges,  Shippers Council of Eastern Africa  Chief
Executive Officer Gilbert Langat said in a phone interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
