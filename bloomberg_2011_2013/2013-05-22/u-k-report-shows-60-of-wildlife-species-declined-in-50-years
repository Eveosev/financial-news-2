Sixty percent of wildlife species in
the U.K. have declined in the last five decades because of
factors including habitat losses and  climate change , according
to a report compiled by 25 environmental groups in the country.  Thirty-one percent of the 3,148 species monitored have
“decreased strongly” in the past 50 years, according to the
 report  posted online by the Royal Society for the Protection of
Birds today and compiled with groups including the Royal Botanic
Gardens, Kew, and Rothamsted Research. In a separate gauge of
6,225 species, 12 percent were at risk of extinction in the
U.K., the report showed. The groups with the highest numbers of
threatened species were flowering plants, flies, beetles, moths
and butterflies.  “The main cause of changes to the U.K.’s nature, good and
bad, is human activity,” according to the report. “We are
having a profound impact on the U.K.’s nature.”  Fourteen percent of farmland flowering plants are on a
national “Red List” indicating that they’re at risk of
extinction, with some species including the red hemp-nettle and
corn cleavers classified as “critically endangered,” according
to the report. Sixty-four percent of farmland moths and 70
percent of carabid beetles evaluated in the report were in
decline.  Other populations found in farmland areas, including
woodpigeons, black grass and some types of butterflies, have
increased in recent years, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
