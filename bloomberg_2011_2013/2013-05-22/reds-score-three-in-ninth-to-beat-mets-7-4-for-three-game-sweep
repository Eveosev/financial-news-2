Matt Harvey allowed more than three
runs for the first time in 17 starts and left with a no-decision, and the visiting Cincinnati Reds scored three runs in
the ninth inning to beat the New York Mets 7-4.  In a showdown of undefeated pitchers, Harvey (5-0) and
Cincinnati’s Mat Latos (4-0) allowed four earned runs each and
left without factoring in the decision. The Reds broke a 4-4 tie
in the top of the ninth with three runs off Bobby Parnell to
complete a three-game Major League Baseball sweep at Citi Field
in New York.  Harvey left the game trailing 3-2 in the top of the seventh
inning after Brandon Phillips hit his 116th pitch to left field
for a run-scoring single. The 24-year-old right-hander was
charged with one more run before Scott Rice closed the inning,
and the Mets tied the game with two outs in the bottom of the
seventh on run-scoring hits from Daniel Murphy and Rick Ankiel.  With two on and one out in the top of the ninth, Phillips
hit a ball down the first-base line that Ike Davis appeared to
pull away from, thinking it would land foul. The ball was ruled
fair and an RBI double for Phillips. After an intentional walk,
Todd Frazier hit a bloop single to center to bring home two more
runs.  Harvey entered the game ranked third in the National League
with a 1.55 earned-run average and fourth in strikeouts with 68.
He hadn’t allowed more than three earned runs in a game since
Aug. 5, 2012. Harvey, who struck out six today, had his ERA rise
to 1.93 this season.  Through his first 20 major league starts, including 10 from
last season and today’s outing, Harvey has a 2.29 ERA and 144
strikeouts. New York’s offense has managed just 11 runs while
Harvey was the pitcher of record in his last six starts.  New York (17-27) was outscored 15-7 in the three-game
series against the Reds. Today was the first time in 10 home
games that the Mets scored more than three runs.  To contact the reporters on this story:
