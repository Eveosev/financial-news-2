The cost of insuring corporate and
sovereign bonds in  Asia  against non-payment held at the lowest
level in more than a week, according to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  was unchanged at 101 basis points as of
8:51 a.m. in  Hong Kong , Australia & New Zealand Banking Group
Ltd. prices show. The gauge last closed lower on May 10,
according to data-provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index was unchanged at 76.75 basis
points as of 9:49 a.m. in  Tokyo , according to Citigroup Inc.
prices. The benchmark fell for the past two days and was last
lower on May 13 at 74.28, according to CMA, which is owned by
McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the
private market.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index was unchanged at 100
basis points as of 11:46 a.m. in Sydney, according to Westpac
Banking Corp. prices. The measure declined for the previous five
days, CMA data show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
