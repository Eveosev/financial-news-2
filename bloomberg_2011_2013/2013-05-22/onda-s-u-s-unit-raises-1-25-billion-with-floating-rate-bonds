Honda Motor Co. (7267) , the world’s biggest
motorcycle maker, sold $1.25 billion of three-year, dollar-denominated notes.  The company’s  U.S. unit  issued floating-rate bonds to yield
37.5 basis points more than the three-month London interbank
offered rate, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The new
bonds may be rated A1 by Moody’s Investors Service, according to
a person familiar with the transaction, who asked not to be
identified citing lack of authorization to speak publicly.  The unit, American Honda Finance Corp., sold $750 million
of one-year floaters last week, issuing the debt flat to Libor,
Bloomberg data show.  Credit Suisse Group AG, Deutsche Bank AG and  Mizuho
Financial Group Inc. (8411)  managed the sale for the Tokyo-based
company, Bloomberg data show. Proceeds will be used for general
corporate purposes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
