Suntech Power Holdings Co., owner of
the Chinese solar manufacturer forced into bankruptcy in March,
agreed to sell a project and discounted panels to  Shunfeng
Photovoltaic International Ltd. (1165)  for 93 million  yuan  ($15.2
million).  Shunfeng bought a 99 percent stake in the project for 3.96
million yuan, it said in a Hong Kong Stock Exchange filing
today. Shunfeng, which hasn’t developed projects before, will
use 29.7 megawatts of Suntech panels to build the Kumul solar
plant in China’s Xinjiang region near the China-Mongolia border.  The panels will be sold in installments for a total of 89
million yuan, the Changzhou, China-based company said. The 49-cent per-watt price is 32 percent less than the 72-cent average
for  solar panel prices  as of May 22, according to a Bloomberg
survey.  “Maybe they just need to generate cash, and in view of
anti-dumping developments in Europe,  China  is the most important
market for Suntech,” Stefan de Haan, analyst for IHS - Solar
Research in Munich, said today in an e-mailed response to
questions. “If they want to sell at all, they need to sell in
China.”  The company’s American depositary receipts fell 20 percent
to $1.02 at the close in New York, the most in a month. Each ADR
is worth one ordinary share.  Suntech said last year it was targeting selling panels at
75 cents a watt by the end of 2012, with costs of 60 cents a
watt excluding polysilicon. Suntech’s main unit was forced into
bankruptcy proceedings in March after eight Chinese banks filed
a petition for insolvency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
