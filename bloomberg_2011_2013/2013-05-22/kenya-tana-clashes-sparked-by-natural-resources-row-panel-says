The deadly clashes in  Kenya ’s Tana
River region last year were sparked by competition over natural
resources and the perpetrators must be punished, according to a
government-appointed panel investigating the violence.  The government imposed a night-time curfew and stepped up
security in the southeastern region to stop raids between
members of the pastoral Orma group and Pokomo, who are crop
growers, in which 178 people were killed from August last year.
The clashes were also linked to political maneuvering before
national elections, which took place in March, Police Inspector-General David Kimaiyo said.  “The report identifies conflict over resources as one of
the major causes of the ethnic violence,” according to an e-mailed statement from the presidency.  President Uhuru Kenyatta today received the findings, which
weren’t all made available with the statement. The panel also
assessed the effectiveness of law enforcement agencies in
responding to the ethnic violence, according to the statement.  Disputes over land have been rife since before Kenya’s
independence from Britain in 1963.  To contact the reporter on this story:
