Temasek Holdings Pte,  Singapore ’s
state-owned investment company, bought a stake in Markit Group
Ltd. for about $500 million, according to a person with
knowledge of the matter.  Temasek’s investment was for a 10 percent stake in the
company, the person said, declining to be identified as the
terms of the deal were not public. Markit, which provides
derivative and bond data and competes with Bloomberg News parent
Bloomberg LP, said today that Temasek had made a “significant”
equity investment in the company.  “The strength of their position and profile in  Asia , an
area where we see significant potential and opportunity, will
help fuel our growth in the region,” Lance Uggla, chief
executive officer of Markit, said in an e-mailed statement.
 Stephen Forshaw , a spokesman for Temasek, confirmed the
company’s investment.  Reuters earlier reported the size of the investment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
