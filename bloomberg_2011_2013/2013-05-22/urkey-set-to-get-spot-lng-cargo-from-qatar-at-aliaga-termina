Turkey ’s port of Aliaga is scheduled
to receive a spot cargo of liquefied natural gas from  Qatar ,
according to ship-tracking data.  The Al Khuwair, with a capacity of 211,885 cubic meters,
will arrive today at Aliaga, where Turkey’s EgeGaz LNG has a
regasification terminal, according to ship transmissions
captured by IHS Fairplay on Bloomberg. The tanker sailed from
Qatar’s Ras Laffan port, arriving April 11 to load the
supercooled natural gas.  Nobody answered two calls to EgeGaz’s main switchboard in
Istanbul outside normal business hours. Brian Devlin, Qatargas’
Doha-based spokesman, didn’t reply to an e-mail seeking comment.
Yousra Koura, a spokesman at Ras Laffan Liquefied Natural Gas
Co., didn’t respond to a call seeking comment.  Turkey’s Botas International Ltd. has LNG-supply contracts
with Nigeria and  Algeria , according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
