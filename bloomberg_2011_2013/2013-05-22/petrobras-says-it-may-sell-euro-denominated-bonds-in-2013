Petroleo Brasileiro SA, which sold a
record amount of dollar bonds this month, said it may sell euro-denominated notes later this year as the state-run oil producer
seeks to raise $20 billion in debt for investments.  “If there’s appetite, if we feel there’s demand, we could
issue if we liked the prices,” Chief Financial Officer Almir Barbassa said in a telephone interview today from the company’s
headquarters in  Rio de Janeiro . “The euro market is our second
largest. We only issue once a year in any given currency,” he
said, dismissing a second dollar sale in 2013.  Petrobras, as the No. 1 producer in deep waters is known,
raised $11 billion in a May 13 sale, a record for emerging-market issuers. The issuance carried an average maturity of
10.33 years at an average 3.79 percent, making it the cheapest
debt Petrobras has ever sold. The book-building process took
just six hours and saw an increase in demand from Asian
investors relative to past sales, Barbassa said.  Earlier in the year Petrobras took out $7 billion in bank
loans, which puts total debt raised this year at $18 billion.
The company is seeking funding for a $237 million, five-year
plan to develop the world’s largest oil discoveries this century
and expand refining capacity.  Petrobras sees the Brazilian real continuing to trade at
about 2 per  U.S. dollar  this year and appreciate next year, he
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
