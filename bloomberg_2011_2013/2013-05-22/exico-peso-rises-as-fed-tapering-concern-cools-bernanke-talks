Mexico’s peso fell amid concern the
 Federal Reserve  will reduce stimulus that’s provided demand for
higher-yielding developing-market securities.  The peso fell 0.7 percent to 12.4211 per  U.S. dollar  at 4
p.m. in Mexico City. The currency has advanced 3.5 percent this
year, the most among 16 major dollar counterparts tracked by
Bloomberg.  The peso reversed earlier gains after Fed Chairman  Ben S.
Bernanke  said the flow of bond purchases will slow as the jobs
outlook “improves in a real and sustainable way.” A number of
officials said they were willing to taper stimulus as early as
June, minutes from the Fed’s last meeting showed today.  Yields on peso bonds due in 2024 rose 16 basis points, or
0.16 percentage point, to 4.93 percent today, according to data
compiled by Bloomerg. The price fell 1.88 centavos to 144.64
centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
