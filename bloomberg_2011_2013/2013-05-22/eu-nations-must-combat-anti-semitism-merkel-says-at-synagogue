German  Chancellor Angela Merkel  said
condoning anti-Semitism undermines fundamental European values
as she accepted a Jewish group’s award for defending religious
tolerance.  Speaking to the Conference of European Rabbis in Brussels
today, Merkel said tolerance “is the soul of this united, free
Europe” that emerged from the end of the Cold War and the
collapse of Communism.  “Yet tolerance has limits,” she said in a speech at the
Grand Synagogue in the Belgian capital after a summit of the
European Union’s 27 national leaders. “It ends where a wrong
understanding of tolerance leads to standing by when fundamental
rights are violated.”  Merkel didn’t mention any countries by name in her speed.
The chancellor, who grew up under communism in former East
 Germany , is the latest post-World War II German leader to uphold
her country’s special relationship with Israel and Jews, rooted
in a shared history of the Holocaust. The rabbis’ group
presented her with its annual Lord Jakobovits prize, named after
a U.K.-based rabbi.  “The fight against anti-Semitism is a primary duty of a
democratic, free state,” Merkel said. “Germany will resolutely
oppose all anti-Semitic tendencies, wherever in Europe they
occur.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
