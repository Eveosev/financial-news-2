Equatorial Guinea  plans to keep
exports of its Ceiba crude in July unchanged from June at two
cargoes of 1 million barrels, a loading program obtained by
 Bloomberg News  shows.  The country will also ship two 650,000 barrel consignments
of its Aseng grade and three 1 million barrel lots of Zafiro,
earlier plans showed.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
