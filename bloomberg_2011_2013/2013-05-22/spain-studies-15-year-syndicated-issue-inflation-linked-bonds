Spain  is considering a 15-year bond
sale through banks this year as well as offers of index-linked
and dollar-denominated debt as it seeks to tap investor demand,
Deputy Treasury Head Ignacio Fernandez-Palomero Morales said.  “We could still access the markets with a potential
syndicated issue in the range of 15 years,” Fernandez-Palomero
said at a news conference in  Madrid  today. If market conditions
are suitable, Spain may carry out a syndicated sale before the
end of the year, he said. The kingdom is also considering a sale
linked to Spanish or euro-area inflation.  The  Treasury  said last week it had covered 54 percent of
its planned mid- and long-term gross funding needs for 2013
after selling about 7 billion euros ($9 billion) of a new 10-year bond through banks at a yield 100 basis points lower than
the benchmark issued through a syndication in January.  The yield on Spain’s 10-year debt has plunged from a euro-era record of 7.75 percent in July after European Central Bank
President  Mario Draghi  vowed in September to buy the debt of
European nations that sign up to a rescue package. The rate was
at 4.20 percent at 12:49 p.m. London time.  Spain may also issue debt to finance the country’s energy
tariff deficit this year, Fernandez-Palomero said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
