Serbia  adopted a new railways law to
enable competition and attract investment in the services
dominated by the state-run and unprofitable Zeleznice Srbije.  The changes open the market for passenger and cargo
services for which the Belgrade-based  Directorate for Railways 
will issue licenses and security certificates, according to the
 document , passed in the capital Belgrade today. The directorate
will set rates for using the railway infrastructure, which will
be managed by a public company and local authorities.  The government also plans to split Zeleznice into units
that will handle infrastructure, transportation and asset
management, as part of efforts to adapt Serbia’s legislation to
the European Union. The Balkan nation expects to get a date next
month for starting entry talks with the bloc.  Serbia aims to curb spending on state companies including
Zeleznice. The monopoly gets 14.6 billion-dinar ($170 million)
support from the budget this year, after posting a 16.5 billion-dinar loss in 2012. The government said the new law will improve
efficiency and help integrate Serbia’s rail network with
neighbors and with the EU.  To contact the reporter on this story:
