U.S. stocks pared gains as Federal
Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said the central bank could
“step down” asset purchases in the next few meetings and it’s
still continuing to assess the prospects for the job market.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.4 percent to
1,675.11 at 10:40 a.m. in New York. The benchmark gauge jumped
more than 1 percent earlier after Bernanke said premature
withdrawal of stimulus would put the economic recovery at risk.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
