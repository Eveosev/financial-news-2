The number of gasoline cargoes booked
for shipment to the U.S. from Europe is poised to rise during
the next two weeks on deliveries of summer-grade fuel, a
Bloomberg News survey showed.  Traders will charter a total of 25 Medium Range tankers for
loading to June 4, according to the median in a survey yesterday
of six shipbrokers and traders. That’s three more vessels, each
normally carrying 37,000 metric tons of the auto fuel, compared
with a corresponding survey last week.  Demand for summer-grade gasoline is increasing, Ehsan Ul-Haq, senior market consultant at KBC Energy Economics in Walton-on-Thames,  England , said by e-mail today. Winter grade can’t be
delivered after April 15, when specifications change and
refineries must begin delivering summer-grade fuel.  “The increase in shipments to the U.S. has been due to the
shift from the winter specification to the summer
specification,” Ul-Haq said.  U.S. gasoline usage typically peaks during the so-called
driving season between the Memorial Day holiday in late May and
Labor Day in early September. Inventories of the fuel were the
highest since February 2012 at 63.3 million barrels as of May 10
in PADD 1, the U.S. Energy Department district covering the East
Coast, figures compiled by Bloomberg showed.  “With gasoline stocks on the East Coast nearing the high
level seen in early 2008 and U.S. demand being lackluster, I do
not think the present activity will last,” said Ul-Haq.  Fourteen of the 25 charters have been completed and the
rest are anticipated, according to the latest survey. Ship
bookings often contain clauses allowing vessels to sail to
different ports. There are 38 tankers available for the trade,
one fewer than last week.  Vessels plying the trans-Atlantic route were earning
$13,257 daily as of yesterday, the lowest since April 9,
according to the Baltic Exchange in  London .  *T                             May 21      May 14       Change
