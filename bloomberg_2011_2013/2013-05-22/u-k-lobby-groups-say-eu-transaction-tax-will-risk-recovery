Three U.K. business lobby groups told
the European Union its proposed financial transaction tax will
harm economic recovery and damage the trading bloc’s
competitiveness.  The tax will be paid for by consumers, rather than the
financial companies it targets, in the form of price increases,
the  Confederation of British Industry , the  British Bankers’
Association  and EEF, the U.K. manufacturers’ organization, said
in a joint letter today, seen by  Bloomberg News .  The EU estimates the tax could raise 30 billion euros ($39
billion) to 35 billion euros a year. The plan would charge a 0.1
percent rate for stock and bond trades and 0.01 percent for
derivatives transactions, with some exemptions for primary-market sales and trades with the European Central Bank.  “The FTT is fundamentally a tax on growth and should be
viewed as a major risk to Europe’s ability to recover from the
current economic problems it faces,” said the letter to EU
President  Herman Van Rompuy , European Commission President  Jose Barroso  and  Michael Noonan , finance minister for Ireland, which
holds the EU’s rotating presidency.  The tax would affect everyday goods such as fixed-rate
mortgages, gas and electricity, where suppliers use derivatives
to hedge their exposure to market prices, as well as ordinary
financial deals, the lobby groups said.  -- With assistance from  Rebecca Christie  and Jim Brunsden in
