There's  Versace's former home , priced at $100 million,  Steven Cohen's $115 million apartment  and a  Manhattan penthouse listed at $125 million . But none of them hold a candle to the  50 acres of waterfront in Greenwich, CT  that recently hit the market at $190 million, becoming the most expensive listing in the U.S. While the house is impressive — public records measure it at 13,519 square feet with 12 bedrooms and 9 baths — it's the spectacular land that pushes the price tag up to nearly $200 million. The home sits on 4,000 feet of coveted waterfront property on Long Island Sound, which doesn't includes the additional access to two private islands in the Sound. The two parcels, one at 30 acres and one at 20, contain a grass tennis court, formal gardens, carriage house, apple orchard, two greenhouses and a 75-foot-long heated pool. Considering that a 75-acre Greenwich property nowhere near the water is listed at $32.5 million, the $190 million ask is a little more understandable. An 1,800-foot-long driveway leads to the home, which  The Wall Street Journal describes as in need of a few upgrades . Heavy on Old-World charm, the house has 12-foot ceilings throughout the main rooms, a solarium with a coffered ceiling, and sleeping porches. Most of the buildings throughout the estate hold details from the home's original build date of 1898: the carriage house still has a clock tower, and the garage includes milking stalls. The home was built by the Lauder Greenway family — George Lauder was a partner in Carnegie Steel. It was sold 31 years ago to its current owner, John Rudey, who leads several timber companies, including U.S. Timberlands Services Company and American Forest Services. It's hard to say whether the home will go for its asking price. Candy Spelling originally listed her home at $150 million but ended up  selling it for $85 million to British heiress Petra Ecclestone . One of the most expensive sales recorded in the U.S. —  the $100 million Silicon Valley estate bought by Yuri Milner  — is still significantly under the Greenwich estate ask. Thinking about financing a place like this? According to Zillow's mortgage calculator and assuming a 20 percent down payment (which would be $38 million) on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage, a monthly payment would be $687,734. The listing is held by  David Ogilvy and Associates . Related items from  Zillow Blog :
