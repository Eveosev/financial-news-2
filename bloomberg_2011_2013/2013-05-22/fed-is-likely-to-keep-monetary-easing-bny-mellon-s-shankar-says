The Federal Reserve is likely to
maintain monetary stimulus,  Samarjit Shankar , a Boston-based
managing director and senior currency strategist at the Bank of
 New York  Mellon Corp., said in an interview in  Singapore .  The U.S. central bank is buying $85 billion a month in
Treasury and mortgage debt to push down borrowing costs and spur
growth.  BNY Mellon, the world’s biggest custody bank, has more than
$26.3 trillion in assets under custody and administration and
$1.4 trillion under management, according to its website.  On U.S. monetary policy  “On balance, the Federal Reserve is likely to err on the
side of caution. They would rather be late in removing
accommodation.”  On demand for Treasuries  BNY Mellon’s flow data show strong demand for Treasuries,
“which to us reflects basic undercurrent of risk aversion
persisting. U.S. Treasuries are the main safe haven of choice.
In contrast, the inflows into other relative safe havens such as
German bunds, Swiss bonds and JGBs have been tapering off.”  On Australian bonds  “We’re seeing a lot of global investors reducing some of
their Aussie-bond exposure and moving to other higher-yielding
markets. We see a lot more flows to  Mexico , for example.”  “Australia was benefiting from its linkage to China, and
now Mexico seems to be benefiting from its linkage to the U.S.”  On BOJ policy  “It’s still too early to determine whether the BOJ policy
is going to be effective or not, and I think that’s going to the
key focus in the second half of this year as you get more and
more data.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
