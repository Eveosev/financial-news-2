An Italian magistrate suspended a
director of  Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena SpA , the world’s
oldest bank, after prosecutors accused him of abusing privileged
information.  Prosecutors allege Michele Briamonte leaked to the media
Monte Paschi’s decision to sue Deutsche Bank AG and Nomura
Holdings Inc. over two derivatives that soured before the bank
released a public statement on March 1, said the official in
Siena, who asked not be identified because he wasn’t authorized
to speak publicly. The stock fell 2.3 percent that day and a
further 3.3 percent the next trading day.  Briamonte will be barred from exercising his duties as a
board member for at least two months pending the conclusion of
the investigation into allegations he abused privileged
information, Monte Paschi said in a statement to the stock
exchange today.  Briamonte plans to challenge the judge’s decision because
it lacks legal foundation, his lawyers, Franco Coppi and Luigi
Chiappero, said in an e-mailed statement today.  Monti Paschi filed separate suits in March seeking 1.2
billion euros ($1.6 billion) of damages from the two investment
banks and an unspecified amount from former Paschi managers over
two derivatives contracts from 2008 and 2009, dubbed Santorini
and Alexandria, that the Italian lender used to hide losses.
Both Nomura and Deutsche Bank have said they will “vigorously”
contest any suggestion of wrongdoing.  Prosecutors are probing the former managers for alleged
market manipulation, false accounting, obstruction of regulatory
activity, criminal association,  money laundering  and fraud
linked to derivatives.  To contact the reporters on this story:
