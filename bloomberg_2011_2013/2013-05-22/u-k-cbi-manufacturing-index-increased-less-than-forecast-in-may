A U.K. factory index rose less than
economists forecast this month, according to a report from the
 Confederation of British Industry .  A  gauge of orders  increased to minus 20 from minus 25 in
April, which was the lowest reading since October 2010, the
London-based business lobby said in a report published today.
The median of 12 forecasts in a Bloomberg News  survey  was for a
reading of minus 17 this month. A measure of expectations for
output over the next three months dropped 5 points to 18.  Data today showed  U.K. retail sales  unexpectedly fell in
April, led by the biggest drop in food sales for almost two
years, indicating continued weakness in the economy.  Bank of
England  Governor  Mervyn King , who said last week that a U.K.
recovery is now “in sight,” still kept up his minority vote
for more stimulus this month, according to minutes of the
Monetary Policy Committee’s decision.  “Manufacturers remain optimistic that demand will pick up
in the next three months, despite a recent history of
disappointed expectations,” Stephen Gifford, CBI director of
economics, said in a statement. “With orders improving and the
global economy heading for calmer waters, it looks like
conditions for manufacturers may be on the up.”  The CBI’s monthly index of factory export orders rose 4
points to minus 17, while a measure of manufacturers’ selling-price expectations for the next quarter declined by 4 points to
an eight-month low of 4.  The CBI conducted the survey of 404 manufacturers between
April 23 and May 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
