China Galaxy Securities Co. (6881) , a
brokerage controlled by the country’s sovereign wealth fund,
jumped 6 percent at its Hong Kong trading debut today.  Trading was postponed to 1 p.m. after the Hong Kong
government issued a “black” rainstorm warning, prompting the
stock exchange to cancel its morning session. The shares closed
at HK$5.62, up from the issue price of HK$5.30, after rising by
as much as 11 percent. That compared with a decline of 0.5
percent in the benchmark  Hang Seng Index. (HSI)   The stock will be added to the FTSE All-World, All-Emerging
and  China  (HK Listed) indexes starting May 29, according to a
 statement  by FTSE today.  Galaxy Securities hired 21 investment banks for its HK$7.65
billion share sale, a record for a Hong Kong initial public
offering, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Founded in
January 2007, the Beijing-based company is controlled by  Central
Huijin Investment Ltd. , a unit of China Investment Corp.,
according to the brokerage’s  website .  Cornerstone investors for Galaxy Securities include insurer
 AIA Group Ltd. (1299) , with an investment of $50 million, and Khazanah
Nasional Bhd,  Malaysia ’s sovereign wealth fund, with $100
million, the brokerage’s prospectus shows. Cornerstone investors
typically agree to hold their stock for six months in return for
a guaranteed allocation in an IPO.  To contact the reporters on this story:
