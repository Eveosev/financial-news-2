BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. (BMRN) , a maker
of drugs for rare diseases, rose the most in more than six
months ahead of a medical conference where the company plans to
publish data on its experimental cancer therapy.  BioMarin  gained  2.5 percent to $66.59 at 2:05 p.m. in New
York, after jumping 7.4 percent earlier, its largest intraday
increase since Nov. 15. The Novato, California-based company had
increased 32 percent this year through yesterday.  BioMarin said it will update clinical trial results for
BMN-673, currently being tested in patients with breast,
ovarian, Ewing’s sarcoma and small cell lung cancers, at the
American Society of Clinical Oncology’s  meeting  starting May 31
in Chicago. That data will “vindicate” the drug, Ying Huang,
an analyst with Barclays Plc in  New York , wrote today in a note
to clients.  The drug is a so-called PARP inhibitor. PARP, or poly ADP
ribose polymerase, is an enzyme used by the body to repair
broken DNA that can also be used by cancer cells to survive. By
inhibiting PARP, BioMarin aims to stop cancer’s spread.  While the company is competing with AstraZeneca Plc,  Clovis
Oncology Inc. (CLVS)  and  Tesaro Inc. (TSRO)  to develop and bring a PARP
inhibitor to the market, Huang said BioMarin’s version will be
more effective.  “Although from a developmental timeline BMN-673 is behind
AstraZeneca’s olaparib and roughly in-line with Tesaro and
Clovis, we believe its superior potency will allow BMN-673 to
prevail as a best-in-class PARP inhibitor,” he wrote.  Huang expects BioMarin’s therapy to be sold in the U.S. in
2016, and reach $600 million in revenue for use against breast
cancer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
