Marks & Spencer Group Plc (MKS)  won a U.K.
Supreme Court case, easing restrictions on its ability to claim
tax relief from losses at its now-defunct German and Belgian
units.  The country’s highest court rejected an appeal by Her
Majesty’s Revenue & Customs today on how that relief is
calculated, handing another victory to Britain’s largest
clothing retailer in its decade-long legal battle. M&S wants to
use losses at the units to offset taxable profits in the U.K.  HMRC’s attempt to require M&S to prove that the European
losses couldn’t be used for future tax relief meant “there
would be no realistic chance of satisfying” the conditions,
Supreme Court Judge David Hope said in the ruling.  Google Inc. (GOOG) ,  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ,  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  and other
multinational companies have faced criticism in countries where
they operate for using legal methods to avoid paying full taxes.  A spokesman for HMRC and Simon Whitehead, a lawyer at
London-based tax firm Hage Aaronson who represented M&S in the
case, declined to immediately comment.  The retailer is “pleased with today’s ruling,” Clare
Wilkes, a spokeswoman for M&S, said in an e-mailed statement.
She declined to comment further because the case is ongoing.  The case is: Commissioners for Her Majesty’s Revenue and
Customs v Marks & Spencer Plc, Supreme Court, [2013] UKSC 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
