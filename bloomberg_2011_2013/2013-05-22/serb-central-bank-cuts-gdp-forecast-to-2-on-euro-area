Serbia’s economy will grow less than
expected this year because of the deteriorating economic outlook
in the euro area, its key trading partner, and subdued domestic
demand.  Gross domestic product will expand 2 percent in 2013,
compared with an earlier 2.5 percent forecast, the Belgrade-based Narodna Banka Srbije said in its quarterly inflation
report today. The economy expanded an estimated 1.9 percent in
the first quarter, led exclusively by car industry and crude oil
product exports.  “According to the National Bank of Serbia forecasts, GDP
growth in 2013 will be around 2 percent,” the bank said in the
report. The key contribution will come from agriculture and
industrial production.  The first-quarter economic growth was accompanied by the
strengthening dinar, slowing inflation, a 4.1 percent increase
in unemployment from December, a 0.4 percent contraction in bank
lending activity and an increase in non-performing loans by 1.3
percentage points to 19.9 percent, according to the report.  Inflation should slow to below 10 percent by the end of the
second quarter for the first time since August 2012, allowing
the central bank to “consider the possibility of a further
monetary-policy relaxation” as the number is expected to return
to the tolerance band of 2.5 percent and 5.5 percent by October
and stabilize around the target of 4 percent, plus or minus 1.5
percentage points in 2014.  The central bank cut its benchmark interest rate by half-point to 11.25 percent on May 14 for the first time in 16 months
as the strong dinar and weak demand helped it keep the lid on
prices.  To contact the reporter on this story:
