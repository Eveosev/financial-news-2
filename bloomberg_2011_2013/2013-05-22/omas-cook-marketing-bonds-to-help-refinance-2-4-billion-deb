Thomas Cook  Group Plc, the 172-year-old U.K. tour operator, started marketing a sale of 525 million
euros ($676 million) of bonds as part of a package to refinance
the equivalent of $2.4 billion of debt.  The company is selling seven-year bonds that are callable
after three years and they may be priced to yield 7.625 percent
to 7.875 percent, according to a person familiar with the
transaction. That compares with a yield of 3.6 percent on the
company’s existing euro bonds due June 2015, Bloomberg prices
show.  The tour operator has negotiated 691 million pounds ($1
billion) of loans and plans to raise 425 million pounds in a
rights offer and share placement in addition to the bond sale,
the London-based company said in a May 16 statement. The company
is raising the funds as the cost to insure high-yield corporate
debt dropped to the lowest since May 20, 2011, according to the
Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of credit-default swaps.  “Credit is tightening faster than even we, the most
bullish of observers, would have expected,”  Suki Mann , a
strategist at Societe Generale SA in  London , wrote in a report.  Thomas Cook is rated B- by Standard & Poor’s and Fitch
Ratings, six levels below investment grade. Investors demand an
average 6.5 percent to hold B rated euro corporate bonds, near
the record 6.4 reached on May 10, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
index data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
