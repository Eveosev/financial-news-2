Solarworld AG (SWV)  expects share and bond
holders to vote on how to restructure operations in August after
widening losses forced  Germany ’s biggest solar-panel producer to
agree to issue equity to creditors in exchange for debt it owes.  Solarworld bondholders, meeting today and tomorrow, will
choose a representative for negotiations in early July at the
latest, the Bonn-based company said today in a statement. The
company agreed to the debt-equity swap to cut its liabilities.  “In the next three months, we want to close negotiations
with all creditors constructively and thus be able to build a
good future for Solarworld,” Chief Executive Officer Frank Asbeck said. The producer sees Europe’s solar markets returning
to “fair competition” in the second half of the year, he said.  Solarworld is among companies battling competition mainly
from  China  that pushed solar panel prices down about 20 percent
last year after slumping by half in 2011. That tipped more than
a dozen German businesses including  Solar Millennium AG (S2M)  and Q-Cells SE, once the largest solar-cell maker, into bankruptcy.  Solarworld struck a preliminary agreement with most of its
creditors on a debt-to-equity swap last month to help cut the
panel maker’s noncurrent liabilities by about 60 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
