VTB Group,  Russia ’s second-biggest
lender, rose for a fourth day as investors speculated  MSCI Inc. (MSCI) 
will boost the stock’s weighting in its Russia Index following a
share sale, triggering more than $60 million in fund inflows.  VTB added 2.8 percent to 4.93 kopeks by 4:32 p.m. in
Moscow. The amount of shares traded was 37 billion, equivalent
to about 82 percent of the three-month average. Its global
depositary receipts gained 2.6 percent to $3.143 in  London .  The lender is selling $3.3 billion of new shares in Moscow
and has secured investors, including Norges Bank Investment
Management, the world’s largest sovereign fund. VTB’s free float
will rise 14 percent after the offering, which is expected to
close by May 24, according to Sberbank CIB. That will allow MSCI
to boost the stock’s weighting to 3.3 percent from 2.1 percent,
potentially triggering $64 million in passive fund inflows,
Sberbank said.  “In a few days VTB will be increased in the MSCI,” Kirill Bagachenko, who manages about $3 billion in Russian equities at
TKB BNP Paribas Investment Partners in  St. Petersburg , said by
phone. That will draw about $60 million from index trackers as
well as possible inflows from active managers, he said.  The state-run bank is selling 2.5 trillion new shares at
4.1 kopeks apiece, VTB said on April 26. The government stake of
75.5 percent in VTB is expected to fall to 60.93 percent
following the placement, VTB said on April 29.  To contact the reporter on this story:
