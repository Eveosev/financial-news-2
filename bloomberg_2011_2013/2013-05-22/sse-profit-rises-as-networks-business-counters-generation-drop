SSE Plc (SSE) , the U.K.’s second-biggest
energy supplier, said full-year profit rose as its network and
retail businesses countered a drop in power generation.  Adjusted pretax profit increased 5.6 percent to 1.41
billion pounds ($2.13 billion) in the year through March from
1.34 billion pounds a year earlier, the Perth, Scotland-based
company said today in a statement. That missed the average 1.56
billion-pound estimate of 10 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  “A generally good performance in 2012/13 has enabled SSE
to extend its unbroken record of annual increases in the full-year dividend and in adjusted profit before tax,” Chairman
Robert Smith said in the statement.  SSE said full-year dividend increased 5.1 percent to 84.2
pence a share compared with 80.1 pence the previous year. The
utility has paid shareholders an above-inflation dividend every
year for the past 14 and is committed to paying a  dividend 
increase greater than RPI inflation for this financial year, it
said in the statement.  SSE benefited from regulated rates for power and gas
distribution, even as profit for its wholesale business fell 16
percent to 509.5 million pounds due to “challenging market
conditions,” the company said in the statement.  Operating profit for the utility’s network’s businesses
rose 18.9 percent to 876.1 million pounds while operating profit
for its retail business was 410.1 million pounds, compared with
321.6 million pounds a year ago.  The retail business benefited from colder temperatures in
Great Britain in each month of the year compared with the
previous year, boosting demand for gas and power in homes.  The company said it expects capital investment of 1.5
billion pounds for financial year 2013/14 compared with 1.49
billion for the year to March.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
