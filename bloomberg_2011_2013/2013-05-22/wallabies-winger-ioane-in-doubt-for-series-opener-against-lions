Australia winger Digby Ioane is in
doubt for the series-opening rugby Test against the British and
Irish Lions in a month’s time following knee surgery.  Ioane, who’s scored 11 tries in 34 Tests for the Wallabies,
underwent an operation today on the articular cartilage in his
left knee and is “touch and go” for the June 22 first Test in
Brisbane, according to a post on the team’s Twitter feed. The
second Test is a week later.  Ioane, 27, has beaten more defenders than any other player
in Super Rugby this season, according to the competition’s
website. His total of 938 meters run is the fourth best on a
list headed by Wallabies rookie Israel Folau with 1,046 meters.  Ioane’s surgery comes after three other Wallabies
contenders got injured playing fof their Super Rugby teams at
the weekend. Hooker Tatafu Polota-Nau was ruled out of the Lions
series with a fractured forearm, while flanker George Smith is
unlikely to recover in time after tearing a knee ligament.
Center  Pat McCabe  is also in doubt because of a knee injury.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
