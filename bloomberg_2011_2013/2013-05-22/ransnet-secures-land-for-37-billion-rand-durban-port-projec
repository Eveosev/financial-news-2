Transnet Soc Ltd. has bought the land
for a proposed new dug-out port in Durban,  South Africa , and
will now seek private investment to develop and operate the
project, Program Director Marc Descoins said today.  “Transnet has already purchased the old decommissioned
Durban airport and is negotiating to purchase 31 more properties
needed by the middle of next year,” Descoins said at a
conference on maximizing African port capacity in Durban. “The
port would need to be promulgated, environmental authorization
obtained and then we can make a final decision on the role that
private investment will play.”  The state-controlled ports and rail operator plans to build
the new Durban terminal and develop an older one as part of a
37-billion rand ($4 billion) plan scheduled for completion by
2050. Transnet is spending 300 billion rand over seven years to
upgrade and expand infrastructure around the country.  The company, based in Johannesburg, is also in the process
of developing Salisbury Island, a decommissioned naval base on
an island in the middle of Durban bay, in order to further
increase sea-cargo capacity in the city. The new complex is
designed to be the largest container port in  Africa .  “Container sizes have doubled in the last decade,”
Descoins said. Durban can currently handle the largest vessels
able to pass through the Panama Canal, although new models may
be too large, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
