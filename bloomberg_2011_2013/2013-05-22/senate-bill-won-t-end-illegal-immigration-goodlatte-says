The Senate’s comprehensive
immigration bill won’t accomplish the goal of ending “illegal
immigration for once and for all,” said House Judiciary
Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte.  “The Senate bill is unlikely to secure the border,”
Goodlatte, a Virginia Republican, said at a hearing he convened
today in  Washington  to examine the legislation approved
yesterday by the Senate Judiciary Committee.  Goodlatte said the measure, which the full Senate will
consider in June, requires the Department of Homeland Security
“to simply submit a border security plan to initiate the
legalization of 11 million unlawful immigrants.”  “Without securing the border, and with a simple submission
of a plan, unlawful immigrants become eligible for registered
provisional immigrant status,” Goodlatte said. “The strategy
does not have to be complete or be even more than a fantasy.”  Goodlatte, whose committee has jurisdiction over
immigration legislation in the House, has begun introducing a
series of measures with the goal of changing the system through
a piecemeal approach, instead of one comprehensive plan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
