Swiss stocks  erased earlier gains as
shares of Cie. Financiere Richemont SA and  Julius Baer Group
Ltd. (BAER)  retreated.  The  benchmark Swiss Market Index  fell 0.1 percent to
8,312.16 at 11:04 a.m. in Zurich, having previously climbed as
much as 0.4 percent. The gauge closed yesterday at its highest
level since January 2008. The Swiss Performance Index dropped
less than 0.1 percent today.  Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  is due to deliver
testimony to Congress at 10 a.m. in Washington on the outlook
for the world’s biggest economy.  “The key point we are looking for from Mr Bernanke is what
is happening on the growth side,”  Steven Saywell , a currency
strategist at BNP Paribas SA in London, told Francine Lacqua on
Bloomberg Television. “Are we getting sufficient growth in the
economy and employment? We think we are not there yet, and Mr
Bernanke is going to have to see more evidence.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
