Copper traded near a two-week high on
mine-supply concerns and amid comments from U.S. Federal Reserve
officials supporting its stimulus program before Fed Chairman
Ben S. Bernanke testifies in Congress today.  Metal for delivery in three months on the London Metal
Exchange climbed as much as 0.3 percent to $7,393.25 a metric
ton and was at $7,377.75 as of 11:13 a.m. in  Tokyo . The price
touched $7,450 yesterday, the highest since May 8. Futures for
delivery in July on the Comex were little changed at $3.3445 a
pound.  Operations will remain suspended at  Freeport-McMoRan Copper
& Gold Inc. (FCX) ’s Grasberg complex in  Indonesia  until an
investigation of a tunnel collapse that killed 28 people is
concluded, the government said yesterday. Bernanke will testify
as economists forecast U.S.  existing  home sales climbed in April
to the highest since November 2009. St. Louis Fed President
James Bullard said yesterday the central bank should keep buying
bonds and  New York  Fed President William Dudley said it had been
overly optimistic about growth.  “Copper was supported by concerns over mine supply and
expectation that Bernanke will continue monetary easing,” said
 Tetsu Emori , the chief fund manager at Astmax Asset Management
Inc. in Tokyo. Those factors outweighed data that showed China’s
copper imports dropped to the lowest in 22 months, he said.  April shipments of refined metal into China tumbled 33
percent to 183,023 tons, the lowest since June 2011, from a year
earlier, government data showed yesterday. The contract for
September delivery on the Shanghai Futures Exchange fell 0.3
percent to 53,240  yuan  ($8,679) a ton.  On the LME, zinc also climbed, while aluminum and lead were
lower.  To contact the reporter on this story:
