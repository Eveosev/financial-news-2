Corn futures in South Africa
increased the most in more than a week on speculation the
country’s Crop Estimates Committee will predict a lower output
for this season when they release data tomorrow.  “A lower or smaller crop will lead to a smaller supply so
prices will increase due to that,” Benjamin Swanepoel, a trader
for Trademar Futures (Pty) Ltd., said in an e-mailed response to
questions today.  White corn for delivery in July, the most active contract,
gained 1.1 percent to 2,162 rand ($228) a metric ton, the most
since May 14, by the close in Johannesburg. The yellow variety
for delivery in July rose 1 percent to 2,148 rand a ton.  Farmers are expected to produce 11.4 million tons of corn
this year, according to a median estimate of six analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg. This compares with a forecast for 11.6
million tons made by the Pretoria-based Crop Estimates Committee
on April 25.  South Africa produced 11.8 million tons last year, down
from 2010’s 12.8 million tons, which was the biggest crop since
1982. The nation is the continent’s largest producer of the
grain. Meal made from white corn is one of the country’s staple
foods and the yellow variety is mainly used as animal feed.  Wheat for July delivery closed up 0.5 percent at 3,520 rand
a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
