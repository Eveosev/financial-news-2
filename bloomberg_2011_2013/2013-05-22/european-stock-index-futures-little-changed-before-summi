European stocks  were little changed
near a five-year high after Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S.
Bernanke signalled the central bank will maintain stimulus
measures to support the U.S. economic recovery.  Antofagasta Plc led a rally in commodity producers as base
metals rose. Metro AG jumped 10 percent after Morgan Stanley
recommended that investors buy the German retailer for the first
time in a decade. Pandora A/S lost 11 percent after Prometheus
cut its holding in the Danish maker of jewellery.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index added 0.2 percent to 310.59 at
the close of trading. The gauge, which yesterday climbed to its
highest level since June 2008, has  rallied  97 percent since
March 2009 as European Central Bank President Mario Draghi
pledged to preserve the euro and the Federal Reserve embarked on
three rounds of stimulus.  “Bernanke has confirmed a bias to remain fully engaged in
supportive measures and avoid premature tightening,” said Ioan Smith, a strategist at Knight Capital Europe Ltd. in  London .
“So, no imminent slowing in asset purchases equals ongoing
support for the market.”  The U.S. economy remains hampered by high unemployment and
government spending cuts, and tightening policy too soon would
endanger the recovery, Bernanke said today in testimony prepared
for a hearing at the Joint Economic Committee of Congress in
 Washington .  The Fed chairman is leading the most aggressive economic
stimulus in the central bank’s 100-year history in an effort to
spur growth in the world’s largest economy and reduce an
unemployment rate that stands at 7.5 percent.  King Defeated  In the U.K., Bank of England Governor Mervyn King was
defeated for a fourth month in his bid to expand stimulus. Six
members of the Monetary Policy Committee voted to keep
quantitative easing at 375 billion pounds ($568 billion) this
month, according to minutes from the BOE’s May 8-9 meeting.
King, David Miles and Paul Fisher backed increasing it by 25
billion pounds.  National benchmark indexes climbed in 13 of the 18 western
European markets. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 added 0.5 percent,
 France ’s CAC 40 rose 0.4 percent and  Germany ’s DAX jumped 0.7
percent.  Mining companies rallied with base metal prices on the
London Metal Exchange. Antofagasta Plc increased 3.9 percent to
1,002 pence, Glencore Xstrata Plc advanced 3.5 percent to 351
pence and Anglo American Plc climbed 2 percent to 1,653.5 pence.  Metro Surges  Metro jumped 10 percent to 27.34 euros, its biggest gain
since November 2008. Morgan Stanley upgraded the retailer to
overweight, the equivalent of a buy rating, from equal weight,
and added the stock to its best ideas list, citing a possible
reversal of declining cash and carry sales, the stabilization of
Metro’s MediaMarkt stores and potential disposals.  Britvic Plc (BVIC) , the U.K. maker of Robinsons Barley Water,
surged 11 percent to 522.5 pence, its highest price since at
least 2005, after reporting first-half pretax profit of 37.5
million pounds, beating the average analyst estimate of 27.4
million pounds.  Lagardere SCA, France’s largest publisher, advanced 3.4
percent to 28.75 euros after JPMorgan Chase & Co. upgraded the
stock to neutral from underweight, citing its underperformance
relative to other media shares.  Pandora tumbled 11 percent to 200 Danish kroner after

($451 million) in gross proceeds. Prometheus will retain a 40.9
