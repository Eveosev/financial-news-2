Natural gas futures dropped in New
York for the first time in four days on forecasts of moderating
weather that would limit demand for the power-plant fuel.  Gas slid as much as 0.8 percent after MDA Weather Services
in Gaithersburg,  Maryland , said the weather would be cooler than
average in the eastern half of the U.S. through May 26. The
futures advanced to a three-week settlement high yesterday as
meteorologists predicted above-normal temperatures in the
contiguous 48 states.  “The market is pulling back here and taking a little bit
of a breather,” said Bob Yawger, director of the futures
division at Mizuho Securities USA Inc. in New York. “Traders
are a bit skeptical about the prospect of cooling demand.”  Natural gas for June delivery fell 1.7 cents, or 0.4
percent, to $4.177 per million British thermal units at 9:38
a.m. on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Prices have climbed 25
percent this year. Trading volume was 20 percent below the
average for the time of day. The futures closed at $4.192
yesterday, the highest settlement since May 1.  The discount of June to October futures, a measure of
supply expectations for the summer, narrowed 0.2 cent to 7.4
cents.  July $3.50 puts were the most active options in electronic
trading, rising 0.1 cent to 0.5 cents per million Btu on volume
of 415 at 9:56 a.m. Puts accounted for 61 percent of trading
volume.  Weather Outlook  The high in New York on May 25 may be 62 degrees Fahrenheit
(17 Celsius), 11 below normal, according to AccuWeather Inc. in
State College,  Pennsylvania . The low in  Cleveland  may be 61, 10
lower than average.  Power generation accounts for 33 percent of U.S. gas
demand, according to the Energy Information Administration, the
Energy Department’s statistical arm.  An EIA report scheduled for release at 10:30 a.m. tomorrow
in  Washington  may show gas inventories rose by 92 billion cubic
feet in the week ended May 17, according to the median of 10
analyst  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg. The five-year average
gain for the week is 90 billion.  Stockpiles climbed by 75 billion during the same period
last year. Inventories totaled 1.964 trillion cubic feet in the
week ended May 10, 4.1 percent below the five-year average and
26 percent less than last year’s level, EIA data show.  LNG Proposal  Veresen Inc. (VSN)  filed an application with the U.S. Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission to build a liquefied natural gas
terminal on the coast of  Oregon .  The Jordan Cove project would initially have the capacity
to handle about 1 billion cubic feet a day, shipping gas from
western  Canada  and the U.S. Rocky Mountains for export to Asia
and other markets, Calgary-based Veresen said in a statement
today.  U.S. gas output will rise to an all-time high for the sixth
straight year as new wells come online at shale formations, such
as the Marcellus in the Northeast, the EIA said May 7 in its
monthly Short-Term Energy Outlook. Marketed gas production will
average a record 69.9 billion cubic feet a day this year, up
from 69.18 billion a day in 2012, the agency said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
