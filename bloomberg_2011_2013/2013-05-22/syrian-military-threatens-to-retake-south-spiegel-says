Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s
military has stabilized and the Hezbollah-supported regime could
retake the country’s south by the year’s end, according to
German intelligence reports obtained by  Der Spiegel  magazine.  The Syrian military has re-established its weapons channels
and refueling capacity for tanks and aircraft, giving it the
ability to attack opposition units, Spiegel cited reports by
 Germany ’s  Federal Intelligence Service , or BND, as saying.
That’s a turnaround from last year, when the BND had forecast
the regime’s downfall in early 2013, Spiegel said.  Though Assad can’t defeat the Syrian rebels, he’s able to
halt their advances, the magazine cited BND chief Gerhard
Schindler as briefing selected lawmakers. Should fighting
continue the way it has over the last few weeks, Assad could
retake the south, he told them.  The opposition lacks a chain of command from its leaders
abroad and has had its weapons access blocked by the regime, as
well as the ability to evacuate casualties, Spiegel reported.  A BND spokesman, who asked not to be identified according
to government protocol, declined to comment on the report when
contacted today.  Syrian government forces and Hezbollah allies from Lebanon
pounded rebels yesterday in an offensive to retake the strategic
city of Al-Qusair, which is close to the highway linking
Damascus to the coast.  To contact the reporter on this story:
