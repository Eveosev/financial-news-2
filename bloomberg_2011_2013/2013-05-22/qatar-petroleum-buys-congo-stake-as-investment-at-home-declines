Qatar Petroleum  International agreed
to purchase a stake in  Total SA’s (FP)  Congo operations, its first
investment in an overseas offshore oil field, amid a slowdown in
energy spending at home.  The foreign investment arm of Qatar Petroleum, the state-run energy company, will participate in a 15 percent capital
increase for the Republic of  Congo unit , Total and Qatar
Petroleum International, or QPI, said in a joint e-mailed
statement. QPI will contribute to Total’s investment in Congo,
specifically the Moho North project, the companies said today.  Qatar is acquiring oil and gas reserves abroad amid a halt
to development of the country’s North Field, the world’s largest
gas reservoir. The Congo agreement came one month after QPI and
 Centrica Plc (CNA)  agreed to buy natural gas fields in Canada from
 Suncor Energy Inc. (SU)  for C$1 billion ($965 million).  QPI will buy into offshore oil-producing facilities as well
as assets under development and exploration blocks, the company
said in an e-mail. Total’s Congo operation produced 113,000
barrels of oil equivalent a day for the unit last year, QPI
said.  The venture isn’t QPI’s first in Africa. The company owns a
20 percent stake in a Total-lead exploration project in
Mauritania, according to the  Qatar Petroleum website .  QPI declined in an e-mail to give the size of its planned
investment in Congo.  Qatar, the world’s biggest producer of liquefied natural
gas, finished building its 14th gas liquefaction plant in 2011
and plans to build no more amid the North Field development
moratorium.  To contact the reporter on this story:
