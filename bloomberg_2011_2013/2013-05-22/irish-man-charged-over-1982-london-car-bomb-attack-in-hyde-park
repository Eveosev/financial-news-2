A 61-year-old man from Ireland was
charged with the murder of four British soldiers in a 1982
bombing in  London ’s Hyde Park by the  Irish Republican Army .  John Downey, from County Donegal, Ireland, will appear at a
London court today, the  Metropolitan Police Service  said in an
e-mailed statement. Downey was arrested May 19 at Gatwick
Airport, south of London, and remains in custody, police said.  Two explosions, which went off hours apart in Hyde and
Regent’s Parks on July 20, 1982, killed 11 soldiers in total,
according to reports at the time from the British Broadcasting
Corp. Irish republicans, fighting against British rule in
Ireland, carried out a series of terrorist attacks in England
which was at its most violent from the 1970s to the 1990s.  “Downey is responsible for the improvised explosive device
contained in a car parked in South Carriage Drive, London which
resulted in the deaths of four members of the Royal Household
Cavalry,” Sue Hemming, head of special crime and counter-terrorism at the  Crown Prosecution Service , said in an e-mailed
 statement .  To contact the reporter on this story:
