Nationwide Building Society , the
U.K.’s largest customer-owned lender, said full-year pretax
profit rose 3.4 percent as higher impairments in its property
finance business offset growth at its consumer unit.  Pretax profit for the year through April 4 rose to 210
million pounds ($318 million) from 203 million pounds a year
earlier, the Swindon, England-based company said in a statement
today. Pretax profit at the consumer business rose 76 percent to
824 million pounds, while commercial loan impairments jumped to
493 million pounds from 247 million pounds.  Co-Operative Bank Plc said earlier this month that it
doesn’t need a government bailout after Moody’s Investors
Service cut the lender’s rating to junk status on the potential
for losses on real estate loans and low levels of provisions for
future impairments. The customer-owned lender abandoned a bid
for 632  Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY)  branches in April.  “The weak economy has continued to undermine the
performance of our commercial real estate portfolio, which has
been impacted by weak tenant demand,” Nationwide Chief
Executive Officer Graham Beale said in the statement.  -- Editors: Simone Meier, Mark Bentley  To contact the reporter on this story:
