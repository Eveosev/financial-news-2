Boeing Co. (BA)  said lessons from the
plastic-composite 787 have helped the planemaker build a five-year advantage over Airbus SAS in twin-aisle jets, the models
that are the backbone of airlines’ long-haul fleets.  Airbus doesn’t “have an airframe that can compete” with
the 777X, the upgraded version of Boeing’s biggest twin-engine
plane, Chief Executive Officer Jim McNerney said at an investor
conference today. “They don’t have the appetite to do a ground-up airplane, and they’d have to do a ground-up airplane.”  The 777X will include two new versions, Boeing said. It
will have wings of lighter-weight composite plastic rather than
aluminum and more efficient engines. That plane, projected to
enter service near decade’s end, will compete with the Airbus
A350-1000, the largest model in that aircraft family.  McNerney’s jab at Airbus underscored the jousting between
Chicago-based Boeing and Toulouse, France-based Airbus over the
wide-body aircraft market, where the U.S. planemaker is trying
to defend its historic lead. Airbus has added sales this year of
the A350-1000, which is scheduled for 2017, while Boeing rushed
to fix battery flaws that grounded the 787.  The 787, Boeing’s first all-new model since the mid-1990s,
was delivered three years behind schedule amid struggles with
suppliers and new materials, then grounded for three months
while regulators reviewed overheating  lithium-ion batteries .  While Boeing is targeting a commercial debut for the 777X
near the end of the decade, it doesn’t yet have board approval
to start production.  Boeing fell 0.8 percent to $97.93 at the close in New York.
The  shares  have gained 30 percent this year, outpacing the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index’s 16 percent increase.  ‘Full Focus’  A larger version of Boeing’s Dreamliner, the -10, is also
in the works, and McNerney said he anticipates introducing it by
the end of the year.  Deliveries of the Dreamliner, halted during this year’s
grounding, resumed this month. That will boost the company’s
 cash flow , since customers typically pay about 40 percent of the
price when they receive their new planes.  “With the 787 fleet back in flight and new deliveries
under way, our full focus returns to our ongoing commercial
airplane priorities,” McNerney said.  Boeing is increasing aircraft production to trim a record
backlog of about 4,400 commercial jetliners valued at $324
billion, boosting its cash earnings and attracting investors to
its stock. The company forecasts demand of 34,000 new commercial
airplanes worldwide over the next two decades, with half of
those coming from replacement aircraft.  Share Buybacks  With most of the major development costs for the Dreamliner
behind it, Boeing can lower spending while increasing dividends
and share repurchases, McNerney said. Boeing will target
returning 80 percent of free cash flow to investors.  The company suspended share buybacks after the Jan. 16
grounding and has now renewed the purchases, pledging to meet
its original goal of as much as $2 billion this year.  Chief Financial Officer  Greg Smith  said Boeing expects
operating cash flow of more than $11 billion in 2013, excluding
discretionary pension funding and research-and-development
costs.  Boeing plans to have a “777 family” including an 8X,
which will have 20 percent lower fuel burn than the current 777-300ER and greater range, and the 9X, which will seat 40 to 50
more passengers than the 777-300ER while matching its range,
said Ray Conner, chief of Boeing’s commercial airplane unit.  ‘Boxed In’  The 777-8X “will go up against the A350-1000 while the 9X
will be kind of sitting there by itself,” Conner said. “We’ve
got them boxed in on the A350 at the top and we’ve got them
boxed in at the bottom with the 787.”  Based on conversations with customers, production of the
777-9X probably will come first, Conner said.  “These aircraft are quite defined right now. We know
exactly what they are. We’re just tweaking things as we move
forward,” he said. “We’re in a lot more detailed discussions
probably than you guys realize with our customers right now.”  Work on the Dreamliner battery fix caused some delays on
the new 787-10 introduction, he said. About 90 percent of the
retrofitting on lithium-ion battery systems for the 787 is
finished, and the work will be completed next week, Conner said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
