Brazil’s government has frozen 28
billion reais ($13.7 billion) in its 2013 budget as it tries to
meet its primary surplus target, Finance Minister  Guido Mantega 
said.  Officials did not freeze portions of the budget set aside
for investments and hosting the World Cup soccer tournament,
Mantega told reporters today in Brasilia. The government may
increase abatements against this year’s fiscal surplus goal to
45 billion reais, Mantega said, up from February’s estimate of
25 billion reais.  President  Dilma Rousseff ’s administration this year is
seeking to meet Brazil’s primary surplus goal of 155.9 billion
reais without undermining economic growth. Authorities have
extended tax cuts and increased spending to spur the economy,
even as such measures have helped keep annual  inflation  near the
6.5 percent upper limit of the central bank’s target range.  Fiscal policy in the world’s second-largest emerging market
has remained expansionary, central bank President Alexandre Tombini told lawmakers in Brasilia yesterday.  Brazil ’s government will post a primary surplus this year
of 2.3 percent to 3.1 percent of gross domestic product, Mantega
said. Results will depend on tax collection, which are not
expected to be “extraordinary,” the minister said today.  The government withdrew 12.4 billion reais from its wealth
fund and discounted 34.9 billion reais in infrastructure
investments from its primary surplus goal to meet its 2012
fiscal target.  Swap rates on the contract maturing in July 2013, the most
traded in  Sao Paulo  today, were unchanged at 7.53 percent at
2:29 p.m. local time. The real fell 0.2 percent to 2.0450 per
dollar.  Latin America ’s largest economy will expand 2.98 percent
this year, according to the latest central bank survey of about
100 economists. That compares to the central bank’s forecast for
3.1 percent growth.  To contact the reporters on this story:
