Brazil  will auction by December
contracts to build power lines connecting as much as 6,900
megawatts of planned wind farms in an effort to ensure the
turbines will be able to send electricity to the grid once
they’re installed.  The transmission lines will link 1,200 megawatts of planned
projects in the state of Ceara, 1,500 megawatts in  Rio Grande  do
Norte, 1,800 megawatts in Bahia and 2,400 megawatts in Rio
Grande do Sul, Mauricio Tolmasquim, president of the government
energy-research agency Empresa de Pesquisa Energetica, said
today.  Brazil has about 600 megawatts of wind farms in the
northeast that are in operation and aren’t delivering energy to
the grid because the accompanying transmission cables have been
delayed, according to the country’s wind-energy trade group
Associacao Brasileira de Energia Eolica. The cables to be sold
this year are expected to be built in 2016, ahead of wind farms
that win contracts to sell power in auctions set for this year
and next, Tolmasquim said in an interview at a conference in Rio
de Janeiro.  “The ideal situation would be to have the auction for
 power lines  and power projects together but then we had these
delays,” he said. “This new system of doing things could be
the future.”  EPE, as the energy agency is known, will submit a report to
Brazil’s Ministry of Mines and Energy this week detailing where
the lines should be built, based on a list of 400 proposed
projects the ministry received from developers, Tolmasquim said.
Under previous rules, power-line auctions were held after power-project auctions were conducted and the government knew which
wind farms would be built.  Unlike previous power auctions, developers will be required
this year to build power plants near existing substations or
install transmission lines that connect their projects to the
grid, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
