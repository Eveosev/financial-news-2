Toll Brothers Inc. (TOL) , the largest U.S.
luxury-home builder, rose in  New York  trading after reporting
the most orders since 2006 and profit that beat estimates.  Net income for the three months through April was $24.7
million, or 14 cents a share, compared with $16.9 million, or 10
cents, a year earlier, the Horsham, Pennsylvania-based company
said today in a statement. The average of 14 analyst estimates
was for earnings of 7 cents a share, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. The fiscal second-quarter results included a $13.2
million pretax gain tied to the settlement of litigation.  “The fundamental results this quarter continued improving,
but we expect an accelerating improvement over the next four to
six quarters,” Stephen East, an analyst with International
Strategy & Investment Group LLC in St. Charles, Missouri, with a
buy rating on Toll Brothers, said in a note today.  Demand for new homes has begun to recover as buyers take
advantage of low  mortgage  rates and the  supply  of existing homes
remains tight. The Commerce Department will probably report
tomorrow that new-home  sales  rose in April to an annual pace of
425,000, according to the median of economist forecasts compiled
by Bloomberg. That would be the fastest pace since January’s
445,000, which was a four-year peak.  Toll climbed 2.9 percent to $37.07 after earlier reaching
$39.25, the highest intraday price since January 2006. Stocks
fell after Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  told
Congress that he will slow stimulus efforts if the employment
outlook “improves in a real and sustainable way.”  Revenue Jump  Toll’s second-quarter revenue gained 38 percent to $516
million, according to today’s statement.  Home sales increased to 894 units from 671 a year earlier.
The average price of homes delivered was $577,000, compared with
$569,000 in the first quarter and $557,000 a year earlier.  The company signed  contracts  for 1,753 homes at a value of
$1.19 billion, up from 1,290 homes at $754.7 million a year
earlier. Both the dollar and unit figures were the highest since
2006.  Toll expects third-quarter revenue to increase 40 percent
from the previous three months as more homes are completed at
higher prices. The company is raising prices at 60 percent of
its communities, according to Chief Executive Officer Douglas Yearley Jr.  “We are in the early stages of this recovery,” Yearley
said in an interview on Bloomberg Television today. “We’re
raising prices pretty aggressively.”  Apartments, Dorms  Toll Brothers, best known for its large single-family
houses, has diversified into investing in distressed real estate
and developing urban high-rise condos, apartments and student
dormitories as Yearley pursues steadier revenue through housing
booms and busts.  Toll has issued $400 million of debt since its last
earnings report as it seeks to refinance past borrowings at a
lower  interest rate  and raises money for land purchases.  Toll’s shares are up 15 percent this year, compared with a
20 percent gain for the 11-member Standard & Poor’s
Supercomposite Homebuilding Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
