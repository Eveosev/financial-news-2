Archer Ltd. (ARCHER) , an oilfield services
provider, rose the most in more than three years in Oslo as the
sale of a North American rental and tubular unit strengthened
its balance sheet and helps to avoid a breach of debt rules.  The Hamilton, Bermuda-based company gained as much as 18
percent, the  most since  Jan. 8, 2010, and traded up 13 percent
at 4.51 kroner by 10:36 a.m. About 2.97 million shares traded,
60 percent more than the three-month average daily volume.  Archer,  39.6 percent -owned by  Seadrill Ltd. (SDRL) , has been in
talks with banks and shareholders after it breached covenants on
credit facilities. The company had been expected by analysts to
sell assets or issue shares to cut debt, which was  $1.2 billion 
at the end of December, its latest quarterly report showed.  The $244 million sale to an affiliate of Clearlake Capital
Group “will allow Archer to remain within its debt covenants
and significantly increase financial flexibility,” said Turner Holm, an RS Platou Markets AS analyst. “More importantly we
think this transaction is highly accretive on a cash basis.”  Archer will use “the majority of the proceeds” from the
cash sale to pay down debt, it said, adding that the transaction
is expected to close in June. The company is scheduled to
announce its first-quarter results on May 31.  Archer will have net debt of about $912 million at the end
of the first quarter and $683 million at the end of the second
quarter when the sale has been completed, Holm said.  “We would be buyers on the news,” he wrote in an e-mail.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
