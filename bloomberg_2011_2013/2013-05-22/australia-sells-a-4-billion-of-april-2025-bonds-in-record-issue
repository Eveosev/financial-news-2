Australia  sold A$4 billion ($3.9
billion) of bonds maturing in 2025, its biggest-ever offering of
nominal debt, after the steepest advance in benchmark yields
since January.  The 3.25 percent note maturing April 21, 2025, priced to
yield 3.47 percent, the Canberra-based Australian Office of
Financial Management said in an e-mailed statement today.
Similar-maturity U.S. Treasuries yield 2.14 percent. Australia’s
 10-year rate  at 3.26 percent has risen 16 basis points in May.  Citigroup Inc., Deutsche Bank AG, UBS AG and Westpac
Banking Corp. managed the offering, the AOFM said. There will be
no further issuance of the bond before August, it said.  The 2025 bond was the first nominal security sold through a
group of banks rather than at auction since October, when the
nation sold A$3.26 billion of debt due in April 2029, its
longest outstanding bond that isn’t inflation-linked.  Australian government debt declined 0.3 percent this month,
paring gains that made the securities the best performers this
year among nations that hold a AAA grade from all the three
biggest ratings companies, Bank of America Merrill Lynch data
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
