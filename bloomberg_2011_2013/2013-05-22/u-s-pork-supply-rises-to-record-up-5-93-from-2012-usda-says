Pork inventories in the U.S.

earlier, reaching a record high, the government said.  Warehouses held 698.816 million pounds of pork, up

of Agriculture  said today in a report. Inventories rose 7.9
percent from the end of March.  U.S.  exporters  shipped 1.22 billion pounds (552,442
metric tons) of pork in the three months through March 31,
down 16 percent from the same period a year earlier, the
latest USDA data show. Pork output will climb 1 percent
this year and increase another 2.3 percent in 2014, the
government projects.  “Production has been up,”  Mark Schultz , the chief
analyst at Northstar Commodity Investment Co. in
 Minneapolis , said in a telephone interview before the
report. “Domestic consumption has been down for the short
term.”  Hog futures for July settlement rose 0.5 percent to
