Arqaam Capital said it “strongly”
reiterated its “buy” recommendation on Samba Financial Group
and that the lender is it’s top Saudi Arabian bank pick.  Samba will likely post a 7 percent increase in earnings per
share this year and is well positioned for future demand for
corporate lending, Dubai-based Arqaam analyst  Jaap Meijer  and
colleague Michael Malkoun wrote in a note to investors.  Saudi Arabia’s $657 billion economy will grow 4.2 percent
this year according to the median forecast of 15 economists
