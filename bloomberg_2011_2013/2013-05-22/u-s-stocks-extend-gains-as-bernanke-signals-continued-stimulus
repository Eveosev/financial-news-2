U.S. stocks extended gains after
Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben Bernanke  said the economy remains
hampered by high unemployment and government spending cuts, and
tightening policy too soon would endanger the recovery.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.5 percent to
1,676.89 at 10:03 a.m. in New York.  “A premature tightening of  monetary policy  could lead
 interest rates  to rise temporarily but would also carry a
substantial risk of slowing or ending the economic recovery and
causing inflation to fall further,” Bernanke said today in
testimony prepared for a hearing at the Joint Economic Committee
of Congress in Washington. Monetary policy is providing
“significant benefits,” he said.  Stocks also rose as sales of previously owned U.S. homes
climbed in April to the highest level in more than three years
as housing continued to gain momentum.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
