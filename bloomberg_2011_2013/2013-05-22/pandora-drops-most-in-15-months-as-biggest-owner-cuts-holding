Pandora A/S, (PNDORA)  the Danish maker of
bracelets and charms, fell the most in 15 months in Copenhagen
trading after its majority shareholder capitalized on the
stock’s strength this year by selling a 10 percent stake.  The shares slid as much as 11 percent, the steepest drop
since Feb. 21, 2012. They were down 8.9 percent at 204.70 kroner
as of 9:54 a.m., trimming this year’s gain to 64 percent.  Prometheus Invest ApS sold 13 million shares in Pandora to
institutional investors through an offering conducted by
JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Nordea Markets. The sale raised 2.6
billion kroner ($451 million), JPMorgan said in a statement
today, implying a price of 200 kroner a share. That’s the bottom
of an indicated range of 200 kroner to 205 kroner.  Prometheus, which is controlled by Copenhagen-based private
equity-fund Axcel and Pandora’s founding Enevoldsen family, will
retain a 40.9 percent stake in the jeweler.  To contact the reporter on this story:
