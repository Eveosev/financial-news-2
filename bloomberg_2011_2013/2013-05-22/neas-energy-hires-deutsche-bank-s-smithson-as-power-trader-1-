Neas Energy A/S, the Danish energy-trading company, boosted its power team with the hire of
Benjamin Smithson from  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  as a short-term European
electricity trader.  Smithson, 28, started yesterday in Aalborg,  Denmark , where
Neas is based, Rasmus Buhl Moeller, a spokesman for the trading
firm, said by phone today. Smithson, who moved from Deutsche
Bank in  London  where he was an intraday power trader, was
previously an analyst at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Buhl Moeller
said.  Smithson is the fourth former Deutsche Bank power trader
Neas has recruited since March, Buhl Moeller said. The firm is
expanding as the European Commission seeks to create a single
regional power and gas market by 2014. It plans to move into
eastern European natural-gas trading, as well as French, Dutch
and Belgian markets, the company said in September.  Neas also hired Tarjei Kristiansen, 42, as a senior analyst
at its short-term trading desk, Buhl Moeller said today.
Kristiansen joins from SN Power  Brazil  and was previously at
JPMorgan Chase & Co., Statkraft Energi AS and  Norsk Hydro ASA. (NHY)   The trading firm was started by four local energy companies
in 1998 when Denmark’s power market was deregulated, according
to the company’s website. It was bought by a group of private
equity investors in 2011 and is now owned by Neas Holding AS.  To contact the reporter on this story:
