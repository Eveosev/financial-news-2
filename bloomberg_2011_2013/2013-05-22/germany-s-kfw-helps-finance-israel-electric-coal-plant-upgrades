Germany ’s state-owned KfW Group and
Landesbank Baden-Wuerttemberg are helping  Israel  Electric Corp.
finance pollution-cutting coal plant upgrades in Israel.  KfW’s IPEX export bank and LBBW are providing the Israeli
utility with a 150 million-euro ($194 million) loan to outfit
six coal-fired units with technology that may reduce their
nitrogen oxide emissions by as much as 92 percent, KfW IPEX said
today in a statement.  The banks are each providing half of the loan that has a
term of 12 years, KfW IPEX said. Wuerzburg, Germany-based
Babcock Noell GmbH will supply the technology, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
