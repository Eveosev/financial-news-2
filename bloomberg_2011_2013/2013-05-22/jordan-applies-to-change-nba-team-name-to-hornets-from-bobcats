Michael Jordan  applied to change his
National Basketball Association team’s name to the  Charlotte
Hornets  from the Bobcats.  The request from the chairman of Bobcats Sports &
Entertainment now goes to the NBA board of governors for a July
18 vote in Las Vegas. If the board approves, the team will take
the Hornets name in the 2014-15 season.  “This is what our fans want,” Jordan said in a statement.
“Making this change would not only re-establish one of the most
recognized brands in sports, but would also unify our fan base
by bringing together our loyal Bobcats fans with those who have
fond memories of our city’s NBA predecessor.”  The Charlotte Hornets name appears throughout the city’s
sports history, having previously been used by a minor-league
baseball team from 1901-73, a World Football League team in 1974
and 1975, and the city’s previous NBA team from 1988-2002.  The Hornets were an expansion team based in Charlotte until
then-owner  George Shinn  moved the team to  New Orleans . Two years
later, Charlotte was awarded another expansion franchise that
became known as the Bobcats.  The New Orleans franchise this year decided to drop the
Hornets name in favor of being called the Pelicans.  To contact the reporter on this story:
