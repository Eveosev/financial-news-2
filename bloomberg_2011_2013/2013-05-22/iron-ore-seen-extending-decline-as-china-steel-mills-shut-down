Iron ore  will fall another 8 percent
in the next several months as steel mills in  China , the biggest
importer, shut down because of maintenance, power rationing and
squeezed profits, according to Deutsche Bank AG.  Prices may fall about $10 a dry metric ton in the next
couple of months, analysts led by Xiao Fu and  Daniel Brebner 
said in an e-mailed report today. Ore with 62 percent iron
content at the port of Tianjin, a global benchmark, tumbled 22
percent to $123.60 a ton from a 16-month high on Feb. 20,
according to The Steel Index Ltd.  Steel prices that have been pressuring Chinese mills are
stabilizing as facilities shut down due to power shortages in
 Hebei province , and more will close for routine maintenance and
to draw down surplus steel inventories, Deutsche Bank said. Iron
ore rose yesterday for the first time in nine sessions as an
Australian cargo topped expectations, according to the report.  “There remains some life in the market yet despite the
operating pressures facing Chinese  steel mills ,” Deutsche Bank
said in the report. “We expect that more shutdowns will occur
over the near-term, ostensibly for refurbishment. However, we
believe that the market needs to be rebalanced and excess steel
drawn down from inventory.”  June swaps slid 0.8 percent to $122 a ton as of 10:17 a.m.
in London, according to SSY Futures Ltd., a broker.  To contact the reporter on this story:
