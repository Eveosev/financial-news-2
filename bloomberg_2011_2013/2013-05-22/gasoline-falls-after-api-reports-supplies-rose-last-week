Gasoline fell after the industry-funded  American Petroleum Institute  reported that U.S.
inventories rose last week.  Futures slid 1.8 percent after the API projected yesterday
that  stockpiles  of the motor fuel gained by 3.03 million
barrels. A Bloomberg survey predicted that the Energy
Information Administration will say today that supplies fell
300,000 barrels. Crack spreads narrowed.  “The significant build in gasoline inventories reported by
the API has been weighing on the futures market,” said  Andy Lipow , president of Lipow Oil Associates LLC in Houston.
“Should the EIA show a similar increase, gasoline inventories
will be 10 percent higher than this time last year, more than
adequate for the summertime gasoline season.”  Gasoline for June delivery dropped 4.02 cents, or 1.4
percent, to $2.8056 a gallon at 9:55 a.m. on on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . Prices have fallen three straight days,
retreating 3.5 percent. Trading volume was 55 percent above the
100-day average for the time of day.  The fuel’s  crack spread  versus WTI narrowed 85 cents to
$22.51 a barrel. July gasoline’s  premium  over July Brent fell 63
cents to $14.65.  Gasoline at the  pump , averaged nationwide, rose 0.2 percent
to $3.66 a gallon, Heathrow, Florida-based AAA, the nation’s
largest motoring organization, said today on its website. Prices
have climbed since May 4 to the highest level since March 24 and
are 2 cents below a year earlier.  The U.S. Memorial Day holiday, which falls on May 27 this
year, is traditionally the beginning of the peak summer U.S.
driving season.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel for June delivery fell 3.84 cents,
or 1.3 percent, to $2.8906 a gallon on the Nymex on trading
volume that was 55 percent above the 100-day average.  The fuel’s  crack spread  versus West Texas Intermediate
crude oil narrowed 48 cents to $26.38 a barrel. July ULSD’s
 premium over Brent  fell 47 cents to $18.23.  To contact the reporter on this story:
