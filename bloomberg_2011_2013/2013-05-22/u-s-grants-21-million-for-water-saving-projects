The U.S. awarded $20.8 million in
grants for projects in 11 states to reduce water use, including
new pipe systems in Northern California and rebates to Las Vegas
homeowners who give up their grass lawns.  The 44  projects  may save 100,000 acre-feet of water
annually, the Interior Department said in a statement today.
That’s enough to fill about 49,000 Olympic-sized swimming pools,
according to a Bloomberg calculation.  “Throughout the West, we’re seeing that drought, growing
populations and energy demands, and basic environmental needs
are stressing our finite water and energy supplies,” Interior
Secretary Sally Jewell said in the statement.  The projects chosen include $300,000 for a Southern Nevada
Water Authority program to encourage homeowners to replace turf
with “water efficient landscaping,” the department said. Grant
recipients must match at least 50 percent of the federal funds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
