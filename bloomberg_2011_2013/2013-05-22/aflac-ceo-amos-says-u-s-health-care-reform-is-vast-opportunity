President  Barack Obama ’s health-care
reform law presents a chance for Aflac Inc. to increase sales of
supplemental health coverage in the U.S., Chief Executive
Officer Dan Amos said today.  “We have the opportunity to emerge from an evolving
health-care market even stronger,” Amos said today at a
presentation to investors of the Columbus, Georgia-based
company. “There is vast opportunities heading our way, but at
the same time, success does breed competition.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
