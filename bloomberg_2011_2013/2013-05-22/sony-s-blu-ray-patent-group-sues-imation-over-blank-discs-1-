Sony Corp. (6758)  and three other companies
that helped invent Blu-Ray movie discs sued  Imation Corp. (IMN) ,
claiming the data-storage company broke patent laws by selling
blank, recordable versions of the discs.  Imation violated several patents related to Blu-Ray
technology, which allows a sharper picture than traditional DVD
movie discs, Sony and the other consumer electronics makers said
in a lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in Wilmington,
 Delaware .  Selling packages of blank Blu-Ray discs with the official
logo, violates the patents, and encourages buyers to break the
law whenever they record something, the complaint claims.  Imation, based in Oakdale, Minnesota, is aware that “its
Blu-Ray products, including Blu-Ray discs, are especially made
for use in an infringement of the patents,” according to the
complaint.  Ken Kadet, an Imation spokesman, declined to comment.  In 2009 Sony, Panasonic Corp., Pioneer Corp. and
Koninklijke Philips NV pooled patents related to Blu-Ray
technology in a holding company called One-Blue, LLC. That
company oversees Blu-Ray licensing.  Blu-Ray is the main standard for watching movies at home in
high definition. The format is backed by the major film and
television studios and was developed by a group of consumer
electronics makers, including Sony.  The case is One-Blue, LLC v. Imation Corp, U.S. District
Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
