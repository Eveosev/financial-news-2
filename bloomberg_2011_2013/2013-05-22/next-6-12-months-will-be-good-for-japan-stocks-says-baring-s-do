Khiem Do, Hong Kong-based head of
Asian multi-asset strategy at Baring Asset Management Ltd.,
which manages about $51 billion, comments on the  Bank of Japan ’s
efforts to end deflation.  Japanese stocks held gains, with the Topix Index extending
a 4 1/2-year high, after the Bank of  Japan  upgraded its
assessment of the economy while keeping its monetary policy
unchanged.  On BOJ Policy:  “Japan has delivered some good numbers. GDP and earnings
numbers in general have been quite good. Authorities have been
delivering the right policies. It’s fantastic.  ‘‘Our house view is the yen could fall to 105 to 110 per
dollar, which is not unrealistic. But beyond 110, there could be
some concerns from Japan’s major trading nations. Exporting
companies have been giving such a strong earnings outlook due to
the yen’s weakness.”  On the stock market:  “The next six to 12 months will still be quite good for
Japanese stocks. I don’t think the economic data and earnings
will disappoint in the next 12 months.  ‘‘Valuations don’t matter so much. The rally in the past 6
months is not about valuation. Investors have been focusing on
earnings and price momentum, low volatility and quality
companies with growth. I don’t see that changing any time
soon.”  Shares on the benchmark  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  traded at
about 21.9 times estimated earnings, compared with 15.2 times
for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
