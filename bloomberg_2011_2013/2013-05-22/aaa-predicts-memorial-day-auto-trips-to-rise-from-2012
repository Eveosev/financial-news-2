The number of Americans driving
during the Memorial Day holiday weekend will rise 0.3 percent
from a year earlier to the highest level in eight years,
according to a forecast by AAA.  Approximately 31.2 million Americans plan to drive to their
destinations, up from 31.1 million who drove last year,
according to Heathrow, Florida-based AAA, the biggest U.S.
motoring organization. The number of air travelers will fall 8
percent to 2.3 million, a four-year low.  AAA estimated 34.8 million Americans will travel 50 miles
or more from home during the four days ending on the May 27
holiday. That’s down 0.9 percent from 35.1 million a year ago, a
drop attributed to consumer unease about the economy.  “American travelers are experiencing fee fatigue and
frustration with everything from higher fares to airport
security,” Robert Darbelnet, AAA president and chief executive
officer, said in a statement today. “As a result, many are
choosing road travel in higher numbers due to the lower cost and
convenience it offers.”  The average price of regular  gasoline  at the pump was $3.66
a gallon yesterday, according to AAA data, versus $3.68 a year
earlier. Prices have climbed 13.8 cents in May.  A survey of intended travelers found that gasoline prices
would have no impact on plans for 62 percent of travelers.  Memorial Day marks the traditional beginning of the summer
travel season and the peak period for gasoline use. This year,
the holiday falls a day earlier than in 2012. Weekend holiday
travel tends to be more robust when the holiday falls later in
the month, AAA has said.  The average distance traveled will be 690 miles, up from
642 a year earlier. Median spending will fall to $659 from $702,
AAA said.  The projections by AAA are based on research and forecasts
from IHS Global Insight.  To contact the reporter on this story:
