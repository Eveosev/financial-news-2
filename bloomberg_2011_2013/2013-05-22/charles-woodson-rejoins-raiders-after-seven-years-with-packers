Charles Woodson rejoined the  Oakland
Raiders , where the Pro Bowl defensive back began his 15-year
National Football League career in 1998.  Woodson, 36, ranks second among active NFL players with 55
interceptions in 206 games. He’s returned 11 interceptions for
touchdowns, the second-most in league history, and was the NFL’s
Defensive Player of the Year in 2009.  Woodson spent his first eight seasons in Oakland after
being selected with the fourth pick in the 1998 draft out of the
 University of Michigan , where he won the 1997 Heisman Trophy as
college football’s best player. He spent the past seven years
with the  Green Bay Packers  and became a free agent after last
season, when he missed nine games due to a broken collarbone
after moving to safety from cornerback.  Woodson was voted the NFL’s top defensive player in 2009
after a career-high nine interceptions and the following season
helped the Packers to the Super Bowl title.  An eight-time Pro Bowl selection, Woodson was a part of
Oakland’s division-winning teams from 2000 to 2002. The Raiders
didn’t disclose terms of his contract in a  statement  on their
website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
