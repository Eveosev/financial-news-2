Empresas ICA SAB (ICA*)  fell the most since
September 2011 and bond yields rose as Deutsche Bank AG cut its
recommendation on Mexico’s largest construction company after
debt downgrades by  Standard & Poor’s  and Moody’s Investors
Service.  The shares  fell  8.6 percent to 25.61 pesos at 1:21 p.m. in
Mexico City, after earlier dropping as much as 10 percent for
the steepest intraday decline since Sept. 22, 2011. ICA’s $500
million 8.9 percent bonds due 2021 declined 0.2 cents to 86.7
cents on the dollar, pushing the yield to 11.5 percent, the
highest since October 2011.  ICA’s shares have plunged more than 20 percent since
Moody’s downgraded ICA’s debt on May 17, citing the  Mexico  City-based company’s high leverage levels and delays in public-works
spending by President Enrique Pena Nieto’s administration. S&P
yesterday trimmed the builder’s debt rating saying the lack of
infrastructure investment could hurt the company’s sales. Those
downgrades could see the company face margin calls, requests for
more debt collateral, or force asset sales, among other
pressures, Deutsche Bank analyst Esteban Polidura said today.  “Based on our experience covering Mexican homebuilders, we
believe that sudden and widespread credit rating cuts could have
three negative implications for ICA,” Polidura wrote in a
report today.  The company could see credit restrictions, more expensive
access to funding, or be forced to pursue new equity offerings,
said Polidura, who cut his rating to hold from buy and reduced
his target price to 31 pesos from 43 pesos.  S&P trimmed its rating on the company one step to B+, or
four levels below investment grade, with a negative outlook.
That followed a May 17 reduction by Moody’s to B2, or five steps
below investment quality. Moody’s said it may lower the rating
further.  To contact the reporter on this story:
