San Francisco 49ers wide receiver
 Michael Crabtree  tore an Achilles tendon during a practice
yesterday and will undergo surgery,  USA Today  reported.  Crabtree suffered the injury during organized team
activities and might be lost for the 2013 National Football
League season,  USA Today said , citing a person informed of the
injury who spoke on a condition of anonymity because the team
hadn’t announced it.  An e-mail seeking comment from  Bob Lange , a spokesman for
the 49ers, wasn’t immediately returned.  Crabtree, 25, had career-highs of 85 receptions, nine
touchdown catches and 1,105 receiving yards last season as the
49ers reached the Super Bowl before losing to the Baltimore
Ravens.  The 49ers were favored to win the Super Bowl next season by
Las Vegas oddsmakers, with 5-1 odds, before the report about
Crabtree’s injury.  While such an injury could be a season-ender, players such
as Ravens linebacker Terrell Suggs and Tampa Bay Buccaneers
defensive end Da’Quan Bowers both tore Achilles tendons in the
spring and returned during last season, the newspaper said.  The 49ers announced today that they signed wide receiver
Quinton Patton, who was a fourth-round draft pick from Louisiana
Tech University, to a four-year contract.  To contact the reporter on this story:
