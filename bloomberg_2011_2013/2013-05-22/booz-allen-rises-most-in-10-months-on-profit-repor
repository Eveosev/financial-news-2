Booz Allen Hamilton Holding Corp. (BAH) 
rose the most in 10 months after the U.S. government contractor
reported profit in the fourth quarter that beat analysts’
estimates.  The company, which provides engineering and consulting
services,  rose  8.3 percent, the most since July, to close at
$18.38 in New York.  The company today reported fourth-quarter adjusted profit
of 40 cents a share, higher than analysts’ average  estimate  of
37 cents. Booz Allen forecast per-share profit in the year
ending March 31, 2014, of $1.55 to $1.65. The average estimate
of nine analysts surveyed by Bloomberg is $1.51. Revenue
increased less than 1 percent in the fourth quarter.  “We are proud to have maintained revenue close to last
year’s levels and to have increased our adjusted earnings,
demonstrating demand for our services from clients and our
ability to manage our business well despite a challenging market
environment,” Ralph Shrader, Booz Allen’s chairman and chief
executive officer, said in a statement.  Booz Allen, the 13th-largest federal contractor according
to a Bloomberg Government ranking, is a top cybersecurity vendor
at the Pentagon.  Contractors now confront added pressure from automatic
 federal budget  cuts known as sequestration. The reductions began
March 1 and will slice budgets by as much as $1.2 trillion over
nine years if President  Barack Obama  and U.S. lawmakers fail to
agree on a broader deficit-reduction strategy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
