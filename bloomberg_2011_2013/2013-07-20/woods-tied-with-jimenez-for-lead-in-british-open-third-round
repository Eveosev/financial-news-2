Lee Westwood  took a three-shot lead
over Henrik Stenson,  Ian Poulter  and  Phil Mickelson  in the final
round of the British Open, as  Tiger Woods  slid five strokes
behind.  England’s Westwood, seeking to win his first major title,
bogeyed the third hole to drop to 2-under par at Muirfield in
Gullane, Scotland. He then made birdie on the par-5 fifth hole
after hitting his tee shot into a fairway bunker to get back to
3 under.  Stenson, of Sweden, birdied two of the first three holes to
reach 1 under before a bogey on the par-4 eighth put him three
shots back. England’sPoulter is 5-under for the round through
the 15th, and even par for the championship after an eagle and
three straight birdies from the ninth to 12th holes. American
Mickelson got birdies on the fifth and ninth and is 2 under for
the round.  Woods, looking to end a five-year winless run in major
tournaments, opened his round with a bogey by missing a short
par putt. He also bogeyed the fourth and sixth holes to drop to
2 over. Fellow Americans  Zach Johnson  and Hunter Mahan are 1
over for the tournament.  Masters champion Adam Scott of Australia, in the same group
with Woods, also has bogeyed two of the first four holes to drop
to 2 over. He’s tied with Angel Cabrera of Argentina and Brandt
Snedeker of the U.S. nh b  Among today’s other early finishers, Jason Dufner of the
U.S. shot 67 and fellow American Bo Van Pelt and England’s
Oliver Fisher each had 68.  To contact the reporter on this story:
