Joe Root’s 178 runs put England 566
ahead of Australia at the end of the third day of the second
Ashes Test at Lord’s Cricket Ground.  Root was unbeaten along with Jonny Bairstow, on 11, at the
end of the day after combining with  Ian Bell  for 153 runs.
England is 333-5 after starting the day on 31-3. The home team
bowled out the visitors for 128 yesterday at Lord’s Cricket
Ground in London.  Yesterday afternoon,  Peter Siddle  took 3-4 to give
Australia hope. He bowled England captain Alastair Cook and
Jonathan Trott, while Kevin Pietersen was caught by Chris Rogers
to reduce England to 31-3.  Root’s edged shot was missed yesterday when he was on 8,
and today was his day. The opening batsman went on to combine
with  Tim Bresnan  for 99. Root, 22, is the youngest player to
score a century in an Ashes match at Lord’s.  “We knew going into today we’d have to play really well
and scrap a bit and then score runs late in the day,” Root said
in a televised interview.  Australia ’s bowlers struggled throughout the England’s
innings, using six different players in an attempt to get a
break-through. The visitors looked to have caught Bell on 3 but
the video review umpire didn’t agree and he remained in to gain
more runs.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
