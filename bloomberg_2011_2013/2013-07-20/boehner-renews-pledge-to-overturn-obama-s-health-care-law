House Speaker John Boehner renewed
his vow to abolish President  Barack Obama ’s health-care law
after the Republican-controlled chamber voted to postpone two of
the legislation’s key provisions.  “Obamacare is bad for America,” Boehner said in a taped
interview for CBS News’s “Face the Nation” program that airs
tomorrow, according to an  excerpt  released by the network.  “We’re going to do everything we can to make sure that it
never happens,” the Ohio Republican said.  The Democratic Obama administration announced earlier this
month that it would delay until 2015 a mandate that U.S.
businesses with 50 or more workers provide their employees with
health insurance.  “If Obamacare was workable, why did the president announce
he wasn’t going to enforce the employer mandate?” Boehner asked
in the CBS interview.  The House this week voted to delay by a year the
enforcement of both the employer mandate and a centerpiece of
the health law: the requirement that most Americans obtain
health insurance by 2014 or pay a fine.  The Democratic-controlled Senate is unlikely to take up the
House measures, which Senator Patty Murray of  Washington  called
“pointless pandering.”  Obama defended his health law at the White House July 18.  “Health-care costs have slowed drastically in some areas
since we passed the Affordable Care Act,” he said. “New
competition, new choices, market forces are pushing costs
down.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
