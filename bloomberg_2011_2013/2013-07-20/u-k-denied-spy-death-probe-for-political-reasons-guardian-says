Concern that a public inquiry into
the death of former spy  Alexander Litvinenko  would alienate
 Russia  was among reasons that the U.K. rejected a request for
one, according to the Guardian.  International relations were “a factor in the government’s
decision making,” the newspaper cited Home Secretary Theresa May as saying in a letter yesterday. The reason for granting an
inquiry may not have been “readily grasped” by Russia, the
minister was reported as writing.  Justice Secretary Chris Grayling last week turned down a
probe into the death of Litvinenko, a critic of the Kremlin who
lived in London and died in 2006 about three weeks after being
exposed to radioactive polonium hidden in a pot of tea.  An inquest run by an independent coroner is “more readily
explainable” and the integrity of the process “more readily
grasped,” than an inquiry established by the government, May
wrote in the letter, according to the newspaper.  A spokeswoman for the legal team representing Litvinenko’s
widow, Marina, declined to comment on the content of the letter,
the Guardian said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
