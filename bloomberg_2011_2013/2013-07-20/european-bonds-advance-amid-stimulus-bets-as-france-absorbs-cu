European  government bonds  advanced
as  Federal Reserve  Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  quelled concern that
a reduction of U.S. stimulus was imminent, boosting demand for
fixed-income assets around the world.  German 10-year yields fell to the  lowest  in six weeks.
Spain’s securities rose as borrowing costs fell at a 3.1
billion-euro ($4.07 billion) sale of debt maturing between 2016
and 2023.  France ’s 10-year yield dropped to the least in a month
even after  Fitch Ratings  cut the nation’s credit ranking last
week. Portuguese bonds gained for the first time in nine weeks
after President Anibal Cavaco Silva said he remains confident
the nation can overcome political turmoil.  “Bernanke clarifying his position on when and how QE will
be tapered has certainly helped” European bonds, said Thomas Rahman, a strategist at RIA Capital Markets Ltd. in Edinburgh.
“Actions from central banks continue to be supportive for the
Bond markets. In the eurozone, the recent shocks appear to be
relatively contained.”  Germany ’s 10-year bund yield dropped four basis points, or
0.4 percentage point, to 1.52 percent at 5 p.m. London time
yesterday, when it touched 1.50 percent, the lowest since June
7. The 1.5 percent bond due in May 2023 rose 0.36, or 3.60 euros
per 1,000-euro face amount, to 99.82.  Bernanke told the Senate Banking Committee on July 18 that
it was “way too early to make any judgment” about tapering
asset purchases in September. The previous day, he said told the
House Financial Services Committee that the central bank’s
quantitative easing is “by no means on a preset course.”  Yields Gyrated  Bond yields have gyrated in the past month as central banks
gave mixed messages about the future direction of monetary
policy and as economies recover at different speeds.  The German 10-year yield jumped to as much as 1.85 percent
on June 24, the most since April 2012, after the Federal Reserve
said five days earlier it may start reducing stimulus as early
as this year. The yield has dropped 13 basis points since July
4, when European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  said the
institution will keep  interest rates  low for an “extended
period.”  The Spanish 10-year yield decreased 10 basis points to 4.68
percent this week, while the rates on similar-maturity
Portuguese bonds fell 71 basis points to 6.80 percent.  Greece ’s
2023 bonds advanced, with yields dropping 60 basis points to
10.19 percent after the country’s parliament passed a bill
approving austerity measures needed to win the next tranche of
international aid.  AAA Rating  France’s bonds advanced as it auctioned a combined 7.99
billion euros of notes on July 18, the first sale since Fitch
stripped  Europe ’s second-largest economy of its AAA rating last
week.  French  10-year yields  were little changed at 2.19 percent,
after touching 2.15 percent yesterday, the lowest since June 19.  A report next week will show a gauge of euro-area services
and factory output increased to the highest in 18 months in
July, according to a Bloomberg News survey.  A composite index based on a survey of purchasing managers
in both industries rose to 49.1 from 48.7 in June, London-based
Markit Economics will say on July 24, according to the median
estimate of economists. That would be the highest since March
2012. A reading below 50 indicates contraction.  The Netherlands is due to sell bonds maturing in 2021 and
2042 next week, while France, Germany and Spain auction bills.  German bonds handed investors a loss of 0.6 percent this
year through July 18, according to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes.
French securities dropped 0.2 percent, while Spanish bonds
returned 6 percent, the indexes show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
