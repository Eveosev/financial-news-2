Acciona SA (ANA)  and partner  Grupo BTG
Pactual (BBTG11)  will seek a  Supreme Court  ruling after Catalonia’s top
court revoked its contract to privatize Barcelona’s water
supply, Cinco Dias said, citing sources close to the company.  Catalonia’s Superior Court said yesterday it agreed with
Sociedad General de  Aguas de Barcelona’s  challenge to a 1
billion-euro ($1.3 billion) contract awarded to Acciona and its
partners last year and urged the regional government to call for
a new bidding process, according to court documents.  Acciona, based in Alcobendas, Spain, has managed
Barcelona’s water supply since Jan. 1 and will continue to do so
for the time being, Cinco Dias reported.  Calls to an Acciona spokeswoman outside normal business
hours were not returned.  To contact the reporter on this story:
