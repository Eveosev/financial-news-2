Cesc Fabregas has told friends he
will only return to the Premier League with Arsenal, even after
 Manchester United  have bid for him, the Daily Mirror reported.  Fabregas’s first priority is to stay at Barcelona, but his
attitude will change if the club accepts United’s bid, the
Mirror said. The Premier League champion has made a 26 million
pound ($40 million) offer and knows it must go higher, the
newspaper said.  United’s Executive Vice Chairman Ed Woodward left the
club’s pre-season tour in Australia to return to Europe to try
and complete the deal, the Mirror said.  Arsenal has a buy-back option from when it sold Fabregas to
Barcelona in 2011. Gunners manager  Arsene Wenger  has remained
close to his former captain and the two have been in regular
contact, the Mirror said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
