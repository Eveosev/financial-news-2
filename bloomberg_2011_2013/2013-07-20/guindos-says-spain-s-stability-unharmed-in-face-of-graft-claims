Spanish Economy Minister Luis de Guindos said the country’s stability has not been compromised by
allegations of corruption at the ruling People’s Party.  “We have not seen any sort of impact from this kind of
potentially conflictive situation,” Guindos told Bloomberg News
in an interview from the Spanish trade office in Moscow, after
G20 events ended. “Political stability is something that is
possible for Spain.”  Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy has faced pressure to
respond to allegations that senior party officials shared at
least 8.3 million euros ($10.9 million) between 1990 and 2008
from a secret slush fund that former party treasurer Luis
Barcenas helped to manage. The extra yield that investors demand
to hold Spanish 10-year debt instead of similar German bonds
increased to 315.7 basis points yesterday.  Rajoy has denied allegations from Barcenas that he accepted
cash payments before becoming premier. The PP has denied making
illegal payments to officials.  Guindos also said Spain is in a “comfortable situation”
in terms of funding and liquidity after having beat its debt
sale goal. In last week’s bond auction, the Spanish Treasury
sold 3.06 billion euros ($4 billion) of debt, more than its
maximum target of 3 billion euros.  “We are meeting our targets,” Guindos said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
