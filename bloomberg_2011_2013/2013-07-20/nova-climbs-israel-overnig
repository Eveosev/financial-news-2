Nova Measuring Instruments Ltd. (NVMI) , the
Israeli maker of equipment for semiconductor manufacturing,
rebounded in New York after the chief executive officer said
he’s confident its largest customer won’t pare back orders.  Nova rose 1.8 percent to $9.22 on July 19, paring a 2.2
percent loss from the day before sparked by concern that revenue
would slump after  Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM) 
forecast third-quarter sales that trailed estimates. The stock
ended the week at a 1.3 percent discount to shares in  Tel Aviv .
The Bloomberg Israel-US Equity Index of the most traded Israeli
companies in New York rose 0.4 percent, extending its gain last
week to 2.6 percent, the most since March 8.  Chief Executive Officer Gabi Seligsohn said in an interview
that while TSMC may delay orders into the fourth quarter or
early next year, demand for the Ness-Ziona, Israel-based
company’s products will remain strong as semiconductor plants
churn out more of the 20-nanometer chips for use in smartphones
from Apple Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co. TSMC said July 18
that slumping demand for computers is crimping growth.  “We know that there are multiple orders coming our way,
but the timing is the issue,” Seligsohn said by phone. “They
are focused on the 20-nanometer ramp up. That is something that
is very strategic for them.”  One nanometer, equal to one billionth of a meter, measures
the size of connections within a chip. A smaller number implies
more advanced technology, allowing semiconductors to be smaller
and more powerful.  Nova’s sales will increase 12 percent this year, after
falling 6.5 percent in 2012, according to the average estimate
of two analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Demand Outlook  “We expect to see a pickup in the fourth quarter of this
year,” Edwin Mok, an analyst at Needham & Co. in  San Francisco ,
said in a telephone interview July 19. Mok has a buy rating for
the stock. “Next year, for the whole year, we expect the level
of spending from TSMC, and Nova’s business with this customer,
to be roughly the same as this year.”  The Bloomberg Israel-US Equity Index rallied for a fourth
week to 96.22, extending its advance this year to 11 percent.
Israel’s benchmark  TA-25 Index (TA-25)  slipped 0.1 percent to 1,226.05
at 10:31 a.m. in Tel Aviv.  Gilat Satellite Networks Ltd. (GILT) , an Israeli defense company,
posted the biggest decline on the Bloomberg-Israel US gauge last
week. The shares tumbled 8.6 percent to $5.20 after the company
cut its 2013 sales estimate about 4.2 percent on July 18. Shares
in Israel rose this morning, gaining 0.6 percent to 18.51
shekels, or $5.18.  Allot Communications Ltd. (ALLT)  rallied 11 percent last week to
$15.01 in New York. Shares in Tel Aviv today narrowed the
premium, declining 2.5 percent to 53.5 shekels, or $14.98.  Israeli and Palestinian officials reached an agreement to
resume direct peace talks that had stopped in 2010, U.S.
Secretary of State  John Kerry  said July 19. Both parties agreed
to meet in Washington within about a week. The shekel added 0.2
percent to 3.5719 per  U.S. dollar , extending the weekly advance
to 0.8 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
