Tim Bresnan  and Joe Root combined
for 83 runs to push England to 144-3 at lunch of the third day
of the second Ashes cricket Test, putting the hosts 347 ahead of
Australia.  Root hit 63 unbeaten and Bresnan was on 32 at the break.
England started the day with a 264-run lead after bowling out
the visitors for 128 yesterday at Lord’s Cricket Ground in
London.  Yesterday afternoon,  Peter Siddle  took 3-4 to give
Australia hope. He bowled England captain Alastair Cook and
Jonathan Trott, while Kevin Pietersen was caught by Chris Rogers
to reduce England to 31-3.  Today, Bresnan and Root kept adding runs, frustrating the
visitor’s bowlers.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
