A former member of the U.S. armed forces kidnapped in  Colombia  ignored warnings from police and hotel staff not to attempt a trek through jungle controlled by Marxist rebels.  The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, said in a  statement on its website  on July 19 that it had captured a U.S. soldier named Kevin Scott Sutay on June 20 in Guaviare province, a remote jungle and cattle-ranching area in southern Colombia. The U.S. Embassy in Bogota said in an e-mailed statement it’s working closely with Colombian authorities on the case. Sutay is a U.S. citizen with no current connection to the U.S. military, the embassy said.  A week before being abducted, Sutay said in an interview he planned to walk through more than 300 miles (483 kilometers) of  rain forest  to the town of Inirida, on the border with  Venezuela . Staff at Hotel Las Palmas in the provincial capital of San Jose del Guaviare, where Sutay was staying before he was abducted, were so concerned for their guest’s safety that they called the police, hotel administrator Adriana Sanchez said.  “I explained to him that it was dangerous, that it was an area without much military presence,” Sanchez said in a telephone interview. “He kept insisting. So we called police and advised them that he wanted to make this trip, and that they should take action.”  Survival Skills  National Police officers came to the hotel and tried “many times” to dissuade Sutay from making the trip, Sanchez said.  Sutay, a lanky man in his 20s with a military-style crew cut, said he’d been discharged recently from the U.S. military, where he served in a combat unit in  Afghanistan . Hotel workers advised him not to talk about his experiences in Afghanistan, Sanchez added.  “We told him it was dangerous to talk about these things in a place where anyone could be listening,” she said.  Sutay is the first U.S. citizen to be held hostage by the FARC since Keith Stansell, Thomas Howes and Marc Gonsalves, employees of  Northrop Grumman Corp. (NOC) , were rescued by the Colombian army in 2008 in Guaviare province. They had been in captivity more than five years.  Michael McKinley , U.S. ambassador to Colombia, said the FARC should release Sutay as soon as possible.  “He has nothing to do with any military mission inside Colombia,” McKinley said in comments to the media in Bogota yesterday. “He is a private citizen who has nothing to do with the conflict in Colombia.”  Machete, Compass  Sutay said he was from Raleigh,  North Carolina , and had mainly traveled by land through Mexico and Central America to reach Colombia. Sutay said in a June 14 interview that he planned to dodge FARC patrols by keeping off trails and pioneering across the jungle using survival skills he learned in the army.  Two days before leaving San Jose del Guaviare, he bought a machete for his trip and said he planned to use a compass to navigate through the jungle.  The FARC, in its statement, said it will release Sutay to the  International Committee of the Red Cross . The Marxist rebel group, which has been fighting since 1964, is in  peace talks  with government negotiators in Cuba.  “Despite our right to hold the soldier Kevin Scott as a prisoner of war, we have taken the decision to free him as a gesture that is framed by the atmosphere of the talks in  Havana  with the Colombian government in search of an agreement to end the social and armed conflict in our country,” FARC said.  Fresh Attack  Separately, 15 military personnel were killed in a FARC ambush in the northern department of Arauca yesterday, according to  a statement  on the Defense Ministry website.  President  Juan Manuel Santos , who as defense minister helped turn the tide in a five-decade war against cocaine-funded rebel groups, vowed to track down all those responsible for the deaths, in comments published on the presidential website. Soldiers captured 12 of the rebels, five of whom were injured, the government said.
