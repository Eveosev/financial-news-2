Bombings in southern  Afghanistan 
late yesterday killed 15 people, including six members of the
country’s security services, AP reported, citing an official.  The most deadly attack killed five members of the Afghan
intelligence service and a policeman, when their vehicle hit a
roadside bomb in the Sangin district of Helmand province, AP
said, citing Omar Zwak, a spokesman for the region’s governor.  The deputy head of Sangin’s intelligence service was among
those who died, the spokesman was reported as saying.  Insurgents have increased attacks in Helmand as foreign
forces withdraw from the area, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
