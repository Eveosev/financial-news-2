Nairo Quintana of  Colombia  won the
final mountain stage of the Tour de France as Chris Froome
cemented his place as leader of the race by finishing third.  It was a first-ever stage win for Quintana, a 23-year-old
rider for the Movistar team. He holds the white jersey as best
young rider as well as the best-climber title in his first Tour.  Quintana left Sky’s Froome and Joaquin Rodriguez behind
with about 600 meters (2,000 feet) left in the 125-kilometer
(78-mile) ride from Annecy to Annecy-Semnoz to win by 18
seconds.  Froome entered the stage with a 5-minute, 11-second lead
over two-time champion  Alberto Contador  of  Spain . The Saxo Bank
rider got dropped on the last climb, and lost his place in the
top three.  Going into the final stage, when the overall lead isn’t
contested by tradition, Froome has a 5:03 lead over Quintana,
who is 44 seconds ahead of Katusha’s Rodriguez. Contador is now
fourth, 7:10 behind Froome.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
