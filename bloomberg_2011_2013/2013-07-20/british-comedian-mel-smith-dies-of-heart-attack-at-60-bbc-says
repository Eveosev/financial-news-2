British comic actor and writer Mel Smith has died of a heart attack at his London home, the  BBC 
said, citing his agent Michael Foster.  Smith, 60, was known for starring roles in the BBC sketch
shows “Alas Smith and Jones” and “Not The Nine O’clock
News.” He was also a co-founder of the independent television
company Talkback Productions which produced successful comedy
shows including “I’m Alan Partridge,” “QI,” and “Da Ali G
Show.” The company was sold in 2003 for 62 million pounds.  Smith’s comedy partner Griff Rhys Jones said he had “lost
a very, very dear friend.”  “I still can’t believe this has happened,” Rhys Jones
said. “To everybody who ever met him, Mel was a force for life.
He had a relish for it that seemed utterly inexhaustible.”  The London Ambulance Service said Smith died at his home
yesterday, the BBC reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
