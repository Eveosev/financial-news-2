  Egypt  will try reach a solution for
its conflict with Ethiopia about a dam on the Nile river,
Egyptian Foreign Minister Nabil Fahmy said.  “We will take action to guarantee the water security of
Egypt and preserve our rights in the waters of the Nile,” he
told a televised press conference in Cairo today. “We call on
the Ethiopian side to respond.”  Ethiopia this year decided to proceed with the construction
of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam, planned as  Africa ’s
largest hydropower plant, ignoring Egypt’s concern that its
water supply would be reduced.  Mohammed Mursi, the Egyptian president who was ousted in an
army coup this month, had been accused by his opponents of
having no plan for dealing with the Ethiopian dam project.  To contact the reporter on this story:
