European Central Bank Governing
Council member Ignazio Visco said improving communication is
key for central banks as they chart their exit from
unprecedented monetary stimulus measures.  “The exit from unconventional monetary policy is
crucial,” Visco, who also heads the  Bank of Italy , told
reporters late yesterday in Moscow, where he attended a meeting
of Group of 20 finance ministers and central bankers. “First
the Americans, and the others later, will make sure that this
will be more understandable and communicate better.”  U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said on June
19 that he may start dialing down the central bank’s bond-buying
program this year. This has sent yields for U.S. Treasuries and
for  Europe ’s debt-stricken periphery spiraling higher. Policy
makers including French central bank Governor Christian Noyer
have called market reaction to the tapering debate
“unjustified.”  Policy makers attending the Moscow meeting “talked for a
long time about U.S. monetary policy, about communication and
the importance of making communication less inclined to create
market volatility,” Visco said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
