Impregilo SpA (IPG)  is set to sign a
$473 million contract with Argentina’s water utility company
Agua y Saneamientos Argentinos SA, BNAmericas reported
yesterday.  The contract is for Impregilo to build a 12-kilometer so-called underwater effluent diffuser as part of a remediation
plan for the Matanza-Riachuelo basin in Buenos Aires.  While Italy’s biggest construction company announced the
plans, the agreement hasn’t been signed, an AySa official cited
by BNAmericas said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
