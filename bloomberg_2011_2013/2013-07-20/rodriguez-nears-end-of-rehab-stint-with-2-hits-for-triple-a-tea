Alex Rodriguez, who is expected to
make his Major League Baseball season debut with the  New York 
Yankees in two days, neared the end of his rehabilitation stint
with two hits for the Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Railriders.  Rodriguez, who had hip surgery in January, must be ready to
return to the Yankees’ roster July 22 or return to the disabled
list. He has two more games with the Railriders this weekend.  “He’s due to DH on Sunday,” General Manager Brian Cashman
said on MLB.com. “If he gets through the weekend fine, and he
responds to the DH fine and flying from Scranton to join us in
 Texas , all that is fine and he’s like, ‘I’m ready to go,’ he’s
in there.”  If the 37-year-old is tired, Cashman said the Yankees would
give him a day of rest before his return to the roster.  “Ultimately the hope is that he’s ready for us on
Monday,” Cashman said.  Rodriguez entered the game for the Railroaders hitting .188
(6-for-32) with two home runs, eight runs batted in and eight
strikeouts in 11 minor-league games. He finished last night’s
game with a .222 average after going 2-for-4 with two singles.  Rodriguez, who turns 38 on July 27, batted second as a
designated hitter in the Railriders’ 2-1 loss to the Louisville
Bats last night. He grounded out in the first inning, singled to
right in the fourth, struck out swinging in the sixth and was
thrown out trying to stretch a single into a double in the
eighth.  To contact the reporter on this story:
