Colombiaâ€™s central bank moved its
final policy meeting of the year to Dec. 21 from Dec. 14, citing
an agenda conflict for Finance Minister Mauricio Cardenas, a
policy maker.  The bank made the announcement in an e-mailed statement
today. All 15 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg forecast the bank
will hold its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 4.5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
