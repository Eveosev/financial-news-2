The Duchess of Cambridge’s
hospitalization for morning sickness highlights the violent body
reactions sometimes spurred by pregnancy -- even a royal one.
That may not be such a bad thing.  Morning sickness, when it’s not debilitating, is associated
with positive pregnancy outcomes, said Samuel Flaxman, an
evolutionary biologist at the  University of Colorado  in Boulder,
who has studied the adaptive significance of the condition.  “There’s a robust relationship showing that women who have
nausea and vomiting in pregnancy are less likely to miscarry
than women without it,” Flaxman said in a telephone interview.
“The hypothesis best supported to explain that is nausea and
vomiting basically cause women to avoid foods that might have
potentially harmful things in them.”  The 30-year-old duchess, the former Kate Middleton, was
admitted to  London ’s King Edward VII Hospital with  hyperemesis 
gravidarum , an extreme form of morning sickness, her office 
said Dec. 3. Pregnancy triggers such  severe nausea  in as many
as 2 percent of women that it prevents food and liquids from 
being kept down, threatening weight loss and dehydration, said 
Diana E. Ramos, assistant professor of obstetrics and 
gynecology at the University of Southern California’s Keck 
School of Medicine.  ‘All Human’  “She will be sent home with medication to prevent the
nausea and vomiting, and encouraged to have lots of small meals
high in protein and carbohydrates and low in fat,” said Ramos,
who has no direct knowledge of the case. “Kate shows us that we
are all human and subject to the same bodily functions.”  As many as 85 percent of women may experience  nausea  with
or without vomiting during pregnancy, according to Ramos.
 Morning sickness  usually occurs in the first months of pregnancy
and ends by the fourth month, she said, adding that the name can
be misleading because it doesn’t always occur in the morning,
but can strike at any time of the day or night.  One in five women may experience nausea and vomiting in
pregnancy beyond the first trimester, according to  Motherisk , a
health promotion program run from Toronto’s Hospital for Sick
Children whose telephone helpline receives about 40,000 calls a
year. For an unfortunate minority, the symptoms may persist
until delivery.  “The cause of the morning sickness is uncertain, but an
increase in certain hormone levels is believed to play a role,”
Ramos said. “Other theories include a psychological
predisposition and evolutionary adaptation.”  At least  three studies  in  Canada , the U.S. and  Italy  are
investigating new medications for relieving symptoms.  Of course, just because something makes a pregnant woman
sick does not mean it is a threat, Flaxman said. It indicates
instead that there may be an  evolutionary reason  why the steak a
woman once loved turns her stomach during pregnancy.  Avoiding Toxins  “The kinds of things that tend to provoke nausea and
vomiting are the kinds of things that, through evolutionary
history, have been associated with ingesting toxins or food-
borne microbes,” Flaxman said. “These are threats we all face
when we eat but the magnitude of the threat is increased during
pregnancy.”  A heightened sense of smell during pregnancy is also
connected with nausea and vomiting, Flaxman said. Some
therapists suggest pregnant women remove everything “smelly”
from their house to avoid feeling ill, he said.  Miriam Erick , senior nutritionist at  Brigham & Women’s
Hospital  in  Boston , said a pregnant women’s heightened sense of
smell is linked to an increase in the hormone estrogen.  “A lot of women have the radar nose of pregnancy,” Erick
said in a telephone interview. She has been researching morning
sickness for more than 20 years, and started the  morning
sickness  nutrition clinic at Brigham & Women’s. “Estrogen is
what drives a sense of smell. It really sends them over the
edge.”  Twin Correlation  Many aspects of morning sickness are not well understood,
including a correlation between increased nausea and vomiting
and the likelihood a woman is carrying twins, Flaxman said.  “That’s one of those cases where we don’t know why that’s
happening,” he said.  The duchess’s rare, severe form of sickness has ties to
literary history. English writer  Charlotte  Bronte, author of the
Victorian novel Jane Eyre,  died in 1855  from what is thought to
have been hyperemesis gravidarum.  “Today, women don’t die from it,” Erick said. “We have
interventions, intravenous fluids and nutrition. We can do a
fair amount of intervention, not that it would take away the
nausea and vomiting.”  Drug of Choice  The safest and most reliable treatment for morning sickness
is  Diclectin , made by Blainville, Quebec-based  Duchesnay Inc. ,
according to Gideon Koren, a pediatric pharmacologist at  the
Hospital for Sick Children, who has been studying the safety of
 drugs in pregnancy  for decades.  “It’s very safe based on studies with in excess of 250,000
women,” Koren said in an interview. “In Canada, it’s the drug
of choice for morning sickness.”  GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK) ’s  Zofran , known to cause heart-beat
irregularities when administered intravenously, and clonidine, a
medication for anxiety and panic disorder whose impact on unborn
babies isn’t yet understood, are also being studied, Koren said.  Treatment  for morning sickness typically includes
intravenous fluids for hydration, electrolyte supplements,
medications to control vomiting, and the introduction of a diet
of crackers and broth, said Ramos at the University of Southern
California.  The duchess, who married Prince William last year, may be
discharged within a few days, a spokesman for the couple’s
office at Clarence House in London said yesterday.  The duchess was the first woman from outside royalty or the
aristocracy to marry so close to the throne for 350 years. When
William becomes Britain’s monarch, she will be queen.  To contact the reporters on this story:
