The pound rose to a four-week high
versus the dollar on speculation U.S. lawmakers are struggling
to agree on how to avert the so-called fiscal cliff of spending
cuts and tax increases that may push the nation into recession.  Gilts fell for a third day before  Bank of England  policy
makers meet this week, when they are forecast to keep on hold an
asset-purchase program to stimulate the economy. Chancellor of
the Exchequer  George Osborne  will deliver his interim budget to
parliament tomorrow after saying on Dec. 2 it’s taking longer
than planned to balance Britain’s public finances, the first
hint that he may extend austerity.  “The U.S. fiscal stalemate is creating a loss of
confidence in the dollar,” said  Neil Jones , head of European
hedge-fund sales at Mizuho Corporate Bank Ltd. in  London .
“There is some suggestion that the autumn statement will
reiterate continued fiscal prudence. A combination of tight
fiscal and a less loose monetary policy means the pound is
outperforming.”  The pound rose 0.2 percent to $1.6117 at 11:15 a.m. London
time after advancing to $1.6130, the strongest since Nov. 2.
Sterling was little changed at 81.10 pence per euro. It
depreciated to 81.33 pence on Nov. 30, the weakest level since
Oct. 24.  BOE Meeting  The Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee will
maintain its so-called quantitative-easing target at 375 billion
pounds when it meets on Dec. 5-6, according to all 36 economists
in a Bloomberg News survey. Deputy Governor  Charles Bean  said
last week officials should keep open the option to expand
stimulus.  The pound stayed higher against the dollar even after
Markit Economics and the  Chartered Institute of Purchasing and
Supply  said an index of  activity  in the  construction industry 
fell to 49.3 last month from 50.9 in October. The median
estimate of nine economists in a Bloomberg News survey was for a
reading of 50.5, where less than 50 indicates contraction.  The  10-year gilt  yield added two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 1.84 percent. It has climbed nine basis
points since Nov. 29. The 1.75 percent bond due in September
2022 fell 0.145, or 1.45 pounds per 1,000-pound face amount, to
99.22.  Slow Recovery  The British Chambers of Commerce said today the U.K.’s
recovery will be slower than previously forecast, citing a
weaker global backdrop and the likelihood of further fiscal
tightening by the government.  The BCC lowered its 2013 growth forecast to 1 percent from
1.2 percent in September and its 2014 projection to 1.8 percent
from 2.2 percent, the London-based group said in a report.  “It’s clearly taking longer to deal with Britain’s debts,
it’s clearly taking longer to recover from the financial crisis
than anyone would have hoped,” Osborne said on  BBC Television ’s
“Andrew Marr Show” in London on Dec 2.  Sterling has gained 1.4 percent this year, according to
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes, which track 10
developed-market currencies. The euro declined 1.7 percent and
the dollar fell 2.6.  Gilts returned 3 percent this year through yesterday,
according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. German bunds gained
3.6 percent and U.S. Treasuries earned 2.7 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
