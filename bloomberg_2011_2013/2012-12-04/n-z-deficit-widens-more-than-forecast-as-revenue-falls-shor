New Zealand ’s budget deficit was
NZ$169 million ($139 million) wider than forecast in the four
months through October as tax revenue fell short of expectations,
according to a Treasury Department report.  The government’s operating deficit before gains and losses
on investments was NZ$2.87 billion in the period ended Oct. 31,
compared with a NZ$2.7 billion gap forecast in the May budget,
the Treasury said in monthly financial  statements  released today
in Wellington.  New Zealand’s government is cutting non-essential spending
and selling assets to speed up a return to surplus by fiscal
2014-15. Finance Minister  Bill English  presented a budget with
little new spending over the next four years and forecast a
deficit of NZ$7.9 billion in the year ending June 30. The
Treasury updates the outlook on Dec. 18.  “With the world economic position remaining uncertain, it
is important that the government remains focused on responsible
and prudent fiscal policy well beyond its 2014/15 surplus,”
English said in an e-mailed statement. The Dec. 18 update will
include an assessment of the global economic situation and how
it will impact New Zealand, he said.  Revenue was NZ$536 million less than forecast, the report
showed. Wage growth and private consumption were slower than
expected, curbing income and sales tax collections, the Treasury
said. Interest income also declined.  Expenses were NZ$343 million less than forecast, reflecting
fewer welfare recipients and delays in starting health-related
projects, the report showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
