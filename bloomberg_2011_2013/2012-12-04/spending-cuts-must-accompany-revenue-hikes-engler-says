Spending cuts must accompany revenue
increases in any deal Congress puts together to avoid the co-
called fiscal cliff scheduled to unfold at the beginning of the
new year, the president of the Business Roundtable said.  “It can’t be revenue now, spending reductions later,”
 John Engler , a former Republican governor of Michigan, said
today at a Bloomberg Government conference in Washington. “This
country has enormous growth potential, but we’ve got to clear
out this fog of uncertainty” for businesses, he said.  President Barack Obama and Congress are trying to negotiate
a deficit-reducing compromise that would avoid more than $600
billion in tax increases and federal spending cuts -- known as
the fiscal cliff -- that are scheduled to start taking effect in
the new year.  “Just get it done,” Engler said of the negotiations.  The Business Roundtable is a group of chief executive
officers from companies including Boeing Co. and  General
Electric Co. (GE)   To contact the reporter on this story:
