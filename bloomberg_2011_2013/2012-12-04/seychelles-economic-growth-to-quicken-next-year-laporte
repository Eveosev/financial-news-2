Economic growth in Seychelles, the
Indian Ocean nation that relies on tourism for most of its
foreign currency, will pick up next year and inflation will
slow, Finance Minister Pierre Laporte told lawmakers.  Gross domestic product will expand 3 percent, faster than
the 2.7 percent estimate for 2012, he said. Inflation will slow
to about 5 percent from 7.6 percent at the end of October, he
said.  The government plans to maintain the nationâ€™s budget
surplus as economic growth rebounds, Laporte said. While the
outlook for growth is positive, inflation remains the biggest
threat to the economy, he told lawmakers.  Tourism revenue will expand by 3 percent, helping to
increase total revenue 3 percent to 6.3 billion rupees ($482
million), he said. The government will spend about 5.4 billion
rupees, 15 percent higher than a year earlier, driving the
surplus to 5.6 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
