Uganda’s central bank cut its
benchmark  interest rate  for the ninth time this year to
stimulate borrowing and spur economic growth.  The Bank of Uganda lowered the  policy rate  to 12 from 12.5
percent, Governor Emmanuel Tumusiime-Mutebile told reporters
today in the capital, Kampala. The median estimate of four
economists surveyed by Bloomberg was a reduction of 25 basis
points.  The central bank lowered borrowing costs by 10.5 percentage
points in the first 10 months of the year, reversing last year’s
rate increases. Growth slowed to 3.2 percent in the year through
June from 6.7 percent in the previous 12 months, according to
the Uganda Bureau of Statistics. The economy will probably
expand 5.4 percent this fiscal year, it said.  Inflation in the East Africa’s third-biggest economy
accelerated for the first time in nine months in November to 4.9
percent from 4.5 percent in October after prices of some food
items rose, the Uganda Bureau of Statistics said on Nov. 30.  Uganda is a new frontier for investments after London-based
 Tullow Oil Plc (TLW)  and partners discovered oil in the nation. The
U.K. explorer is jointly developing the country’s oilfields
estimated at 3.5 billion barrels with China National Offshore
Oil Corp. and France’s  Total SA. (FP)  Total says production of
significant volumes will start in 2017.  To contact the reporter on this story:
