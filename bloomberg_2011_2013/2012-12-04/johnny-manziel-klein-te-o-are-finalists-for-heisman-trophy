Texas  A&M quarterback Johnny Manziel
will learn in four days if he’s the first freshman to win the
Heisman Trophy, awarded annually to college football’s best
player.  University of  Notre Dame  linebacker Manti Te’o and Kansas
State quarterback Collin Klein are the other finalists for the
Heisman, which will be presented Dec. 8 in New York.  Manziel, 19, emerged as the Heisman Trophy frontrunner
after a season in which he’s totaled 4,600 yards of offense to
break the Southeastern Conference record of 4,327 set by former
Auburn University quarterback Cam Newton during his Heisman-
winning 2010 campaign. Manziel has passed for 3,419 yards and 24
touchdowns while rushing for 1,181 yards and 19 scores.  “This is a dream come true for me, and I know it’s a
credit to all my coaches and teammates,” Manziel said in a
statement. “I definitely wouldn’t be a Heisman finalist without
my teammates and coaches.”  Manziel was listed last week as the 1-6 favorite to win the
Heisman, according to online sportsbook Bovada.lv, while Te’o
had 7-2 odds and Klein was listed at 15-2.  A 6-foot-1 redshirt freshman from Kerrville, Texas, Manziel
led  Texas A&M  to a 10-2 record in their SEC debut, the school’s
first 10-win season since 1998. The Aggies finished ninth in the
final Bowl Championship Series rankings and play No. 11 Oklahoma
in the Cotton Bowl on Jan. 4 in Arlington, Texas.  The only Texas A&M player to win the award was halfback
John David Crow in 1957.  Best Defense  Te’o, a 21-year-old senior, has spearheaded a Notre Dame
defense that allowed the fewest points of any team at college
football’s top level. He had a team-leading 103 tackles and
seven interceptions as the Fighting Irish went 12-0 and earned
the No. 1 national ranking and a spot in the BCS title game on
Jan. 7 against the University of  Alabama .  Te’o yesterday received the Nagurski Award as college
football’s best defensive player and the Butkus Award as the
nation’s top linebacker.  “These awards are great, but football is a team sport,”
Te’o said yesterday. “If you ask people who the Butkus Award or
the Bednarik Award winners are, or even the Heisman Trophy
winner some years, they probably don’t remember them. But they
remember who won the national championship. That’s the trophy
everybody wants.”  In addition to its eight Associated Press national
championships, Notre Dame has had a record-tying seven Heisman
Trophy winners, with the last being receiver and kick returner
 Tim Brown  in 1987. John Huarte (1964), Paul Hornung (1956),
Johnny Lattner (1953), Leon Hart (1949), Johnny Lujack (1947)
and Angelo Bertelli (1943) were the other six players from the
school to win the award.  Defensive Player  The last defensive player to win the Heisman Trophy was
University of Michigan cornerback Charles Woodson, who was also
a standout punt returner when he claimed the award in 1997.  Klein, a 23-year-old senior, accounted for 37 touchdowns as
Kansas State went 11-1 and finished fifth in the BCS rankings.
Klein passed for 2,490 yards and 15 touchdowns while rushing for
890 yards and 22 scores.  The Wildcats will play No. 4  Oregon  in the Fiesta Bowl on
Jan. 3 in Glendale,  Arizona .  Kansas State has never had a Heisman Trophy winner. Klein
is the school’s first Heisman finalist since quarterback  Michael
Bishop  was the runner-up in 1998.  “I’m so proud to represent K-State in this because I feel
like my road is very synonymous and in line with the K-State
way,” Klein said. “It has been a process, it has been a
journey. There have been a lot of ups and downs, as well as a
lot of hard times and growing pains through it.”  Baylor University quarterback Robert Griffin III won the
2011 Heisman. The trophy is named in memory of John Heisman, a
former coach who as director of New York’s Downtown Athletic
Club helped create the award in 1935. Heisman died from
pneumonia less than a year later.  To contact the reporter on this story:
