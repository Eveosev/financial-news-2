Retail banks should never return to
the levels of debt-funded growth seen before the 2008 financial
crisis,  Adair Turner , chairman of the U.K. Financial Services
Authority, comments in a speech in  London .  Retail banks “will never and should never return to the
rapid growth” seen before the collapse of Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc. in 2008, Turner said.  Proposals to ring-fence banks’ retail and small-business
lending from their investment banking activities will make banks
safer, Turner said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
