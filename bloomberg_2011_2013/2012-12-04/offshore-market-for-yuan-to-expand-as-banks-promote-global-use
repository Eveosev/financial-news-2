The offshore market for the Chinese
 yuan  will expand as banks take steps to strengthen the global
platform for the currency’s trade, the U.K. Treasury said.  Daily turnover in Hong Kong’s  Renminbi  Real Time Gross
Settlement system, which serves the global yuan market, has
reached 250 billion yuan ($40.16 billion), the treasury said on
its website.  China is encouraging global use of the yuan and allowing
more overseas investors to access its local  capital markets  in
an effort to shift the focus of economic growth to domestic
demand and away from slowing export industries.  Banks have taken advantage of the system’s longer operating
hours in Hong Kong, the major offshore yuan trading hub. The
average turnover during the late operating hours is providing an
additional 2 billion yuan per day, the banks said.  Eight banks joined the cross-border collateral management
system, and the first yuan repo transaction was conducted
yesterday, the treasury said.  The yuan climbed 0.05 percent to 6.2256 in Shanghai after
the central bank raised the currency’s reference rate on signs
the economy is rebounding. The currency advanced 0.22 percent in
November, extending gains since the end of July to 2.25 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
