Chelsea Therapeutics International
Ltd. (CHTP)  fell 25 percent in extended trading after releasing study
results for Northera, a drug for fainting, and saying U.S.
regulators told the company the clinical trial won’t help gain
approval of the therapy.  Chelsea Therapeutics  declined  44 cents to $1.35 in extended
trading at 5:18 p.m.  New York  time after closing at $1.79.
Shares of the Charlotte, North Carolina-based company have
plunged 65 percent this year.  The drugmaker in March failed to win U.S. Food and Drug
Administration approval of the therapy, which is used to treat
drops in  blood pressure  in people with nervous system disorders.
Regulators said a new clinical trial may be needed to assess the
treatment’s effectiveness, the company announced in July.  Northera met its goals to reduce dizziness and
lightheadedness in a trial of 147 patients and showed similar
efficacy and safety as it did in an earlier study, Chelsea
Therapeutics said today in a statement. The FDA previously
advised the company that the study was unlikely to provide
enough evidence to enable clearance of the medicine, Chelsea
Therapeutics said.  The drug, also known as droxidopa, treats a condition known
as neurogenic orthostatic hypotension. It afflicts about 180,000
patients in the U.S. leading to dizziness, lightheadedness,
blurred vision and fainting, according to the company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
