Trader Eric Moncada and firms BES
Capital LLC and Serdika LLC were accused by U.S. regulators in a
lawsuit of attempting to manipulate wheat futures contract
prices.  While trading for the companies, Moncada placed and
immediately canceled orders in December 2009 wheat futures with
the intent of raising or lowering prices, the U.S. Commodity
Futures Trading Commission alleged in a complaint filed today in
federal court in  Manhattan .  The transactions occurred between Oct. 6 and Oct. 30, 2009,
and involved futures traded on the Chicago Board of Trade, the
CFTC said. Moncada is a CFTC-registered floor broker with
trading privileges at the New York Mercantile Exchange,
according to the regulator’s  website .  “The illegal scheme alleged in the complaint, entering and
quickly canceling large-lot future orders without any intent to
consummate a trade, undermines the integrity of the market,”
David Meister, director of the CFTC’s division of enforcement,
said in a statement.  Contact information for the defendants couldn’t immediately
be found.  The agency is seeking disgorgement, financial penalties and
injunctions preventing Moncada and the companies from engaging
in further commodities trading.  The case is U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission v.
Moncada, 12-cv-8791, U.S. District Court, District of  New York 
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
