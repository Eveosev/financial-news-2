Australia’s dollar climbed against
all major counterparts even after the  Reserve Bank  of Australia
cut the benchmark interest rate.  The central bank lowered the overnight cash-rate target to
3 percent from 3.25 percent. The reduction had been forecast by
economists surveyed by  Bloomberg News . Demand for the so-called
Aussie was damped after Australian data showed building
approvals dropped the most in three months and the nation posted
a wider-than-estimated current-account deficit.  “There is no real guidance in terms of future rate cuts
and some people see it as the potential end of a rate cut,”
said  Jonathan Cavenagh , a currency strategist in Singapore at
 Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC)  “In the near term, we see the Aussie
dollar hitting $1.05.”  The Australian dollar rose 0.3 percent to $1.0449 as of
2:57 p.m. in Sydney after losing 0.5 percent over the previous
three sessions. New Zealand’s currency added 0.3 percent to
82.31 U.S. cents.  The nation’s bonds fell, with the benchmark 10-year yield
gaining five basis points to 3.19 percent.  The number of  permits  granted to build or renovate houses
and apartments in Australia declined 7.6 percent in October from
the prior month, the statistics bureau said today. The country
posted a A$14.9 billion ($15.5 billion) deficit for the third
quarter in its current account, the broadest measure of trade,
figures from the bureau showed, compared with the $14.6 billion
shortfall estimated by economists.  To contact the reporters on this story:
