Euro-area  producer-price inflation 
slowed less than estimated in October as higher prices for
intermediate and non-durable  consumer goods  offset slower
energy-cost growth.  Factory-gate prices  in the 17-nation euro region rose 2.6
percent from a year earlier after a 2.7 percent increase in
September, the European Union’s statistics office in Luxembourg
said today. Economists had forecast an increase of 2.5 percent,
the median of 18 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey showed.
From the prior month, prices gained 0.1 percent.  Energy costs on the producer level rose an annual 5.9
percent in October after a 6.9 percent increase in the previous
month, the statistics office said. Prices of intermediate goods
rose 1.3 percent after a 0.8 percent increase in September,
while non-durable consumer goods were up 2.5 percent.  In  Germany ,  Europe ’s largest economy, producer prices rose
1.5 percent from a year earlier, after increasing 1.7 percent in
the previous month, today’s data showed. France reported a gain
of 2.9 percent, with prices in Spain and Portugal increasing 3.5
percent and 4.6 percent, respectively.  To contact the reporter on this story:
