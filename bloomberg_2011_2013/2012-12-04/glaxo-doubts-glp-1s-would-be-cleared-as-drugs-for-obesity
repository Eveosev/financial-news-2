GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK)  said GLP-1
diabetes drugs, including its albiglutide experimental compound
and  Novo Nordisk A/S (NOVOB) ’s Victoza, are unlikely to win clearance to
treat obesity because of effectiveness questions.  “Frankly as a class, I don’t think GLP-1s would make it as
obesity medicines,” Moncef Slaoui, Glaxo’s chairman of research
and development, said in an interview today in London. “Even
with Victoza, personally, I would not” consider it for obesity.  Glaxo, which is based in London, plans early next year to
seek regulatory approval for  albiglutide , a form of a hormone
called GLP-1 that stimulates the pancreas to produce more
insulin, as a once-weekly diabetes treatment. Bagsvaerd,
Denmark-based Novo is studying Victoza, already on the market to
treat Type 2 diabetes, as a potential weight-loss medicine.  Novo said in June that patients taking Victoza lost 3.9
kilograms (8.6 pounds) on average, compared with 2.9 kilograms
for those taking a competing drug.  The limited weight loss, the difficulty of sustaining
results and potential side effects “would be a challenge for
that medicine to be approved for obesity use,” Slaoui said.  Novo Nordisk is the world’s biggest insulin maker. Victoza,
a once-daily GLP-1 drug, generated sales of 5.99 billion kroner
($1.1 billion) last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
