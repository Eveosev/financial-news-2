The U.S. faces a shortage of soybean
oil after exports accelerated in recent weeks following a drop
in South American production, Oil World said.  U.S. soybean-oil exports in the 2012-13 season begun Sept.
1 may total 850,000 metric tons, up from 664,000 tons a year
earlier, the Hamburg-based researcher said today in an e-mailed
report. About 72 percent of this year’s expected total is
already sold, against commitments at the end of November ranging
from 18 percent to 51 percent in the past five years. On Nov. 9,
the U.S. Department of Agriculture pegged national exports of
the oil at 544,000 tons this season.  “Unusually large sales of U.S. soya oil have occurred in
the second half of November,” Oil World said. Known U.S. export
commitments are “already more than most observers had expected
to be shipped in the full season. However, soya oil exports from
 Argentina  and Brazil will be unusually low at least until
February 2013, requiring U.S. exports to step in to satisfy
world demand.”  The oil, used in biofuel and cooking, is produced along
with meal fed to livestock when raw soybeans are crushed in
processing plants. Soybean futures are up 21 percent this year
on the Chicago Board of Trade and touched a record $17.89 a
bushel on Sept. 4 after drought in the U.S. followed dry weather
in South America last season. Soybean oil is down 4.1 percent
this year, in part as lower U.S. and  South American  supplies
were offset by ample availability of Asian palm oil.  Chinese Buying  Still, soybean-oil futures have climbed 8.1 percent since
reaching a two-year low on Nov. 12 as U.S. exports accelerated.
 China , the world’s biggest soybean consumer, purchased 130,000
tons of the oil from the U.S. since the marketing year began,
compared with none a year earlier, USDA data show.  U.S. soybean-oil production may drop to 8.455 million tons
this season from last year’s 8.922 million tons, Oil World said.
The USDA estimates domestic production at 8.087 million tons,
after drought cut the harvest. Domestic usage for biodiesel may
drop to 2 million tons, compared with 2.209 million tons last
year, the researcher estimated.  “Declining soya oil production will most likely lead to a
supply shortage in the domestic market,” Oil World said. This
“will result in a lower-than-expected availability for
biodiesel usage of soybean oil in 2012-13.”  Soybean crushing in  Argentina  fell to 2.41 million tons in
October, 27 percent less than a year earlier, as farmer sales to
processors slowed amid tight supplies, Oil World said. A
shortage in  Brazil  has brought soybean exports “almost to a
standstill and is partly forcing crushers to take downtime,”
according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
