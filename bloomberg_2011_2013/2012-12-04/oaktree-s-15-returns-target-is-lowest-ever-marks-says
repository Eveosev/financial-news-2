Oaktree Capital Group LLC (OAK) , the
world’s largest distressed-debt investor, is telling clients
it’s targeting the lowest returns it has ever sought, according
to Chairman  Howard Marks .  “In the distressed strategies, like distressed debt and
real estate, we’re aiming to make 15 percent gross,” Marks said
today at the Goldman Sachs Financial Services Conference in  New
York . “The irony is, of course, that today 15 percent sounds
like some herculean task. It’s the lowest yield we’ve ever
targeted.”  Oaktree’s latest flagship distressed-debt fund, which began
investing in 2009, had a 13.6 percent gross internal rate of
return as of Sept. 30, according to the firm’s quarterly
earnings report. Predecessors of the pool have returned as much
as 35 percent, the report shows.  Oaktree, based in Los Angeles, has sought to take advantage
of Europe’s sovereign-debt crisis by buying distressed assets
such as unwanted bank loans even as no “deluge” materialized,
Marks said in a July interview with Bloomberg Television. Today,
he said, the firm is seeing “moderate” investing opportunities
globally.  “The  U.S. economy  is decent and the  capital markets  are
generous,” Marks said at the conference. “We are making decent
investments as long as you have expectations which are
reasonable.”  Oaktree oversees $81 billion of  assets , with more than half
comprising distressed and corporate debt. The firm, which Marks
co-founded in 1995, also manages funds that invest in leveraged
buyouts, real estate and convertible bonds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
