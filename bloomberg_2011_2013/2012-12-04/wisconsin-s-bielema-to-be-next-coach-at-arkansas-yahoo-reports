University of  Wisconsin  football
coach Bret Bielema is leaving to take the same position at the
 University of Arkansas , Yahoo Sports reported today without
saying where it got the information.  Arkansas  opened the season ranked No. 10 in the Associated
Press poll before losing four of its first five games and
finishing 4-8 under first-year coach John L. Smith. It was the
first time since 2008 that the Fayetteville-based Razorbacks
failed to become eligible for a postseason bowl game.  Zack Higbee, a spokesman for the Arkansas athletic
department, declined in an e-mail to comment on the report.
Badgers spokesman Brian Lucas didn’t immediately respond to an
e-mail seeking comment.  Bielema, 42, is 68-24 with the Badgers since 2006 and has
taken the team to three consecutive Rose Bowl games. Wisconsin
has been ranked in the AP Top 10 during five of Bielema’s seven
seasons in Madison.  Wisconsin (8-5), which won the Big Ten championship, plays
 Stanford University  (11-2) in the Rose Bowl on Jan. 1. The Yahoo
report didn’t say whether Bielema would coach that game.  Smith, 64, was fired as Razorbacks coach last month. He
replaced Bobby Petrino, who was fired in April after four
seasons when he was injured in a motorcycle accident and then
covered up the fact that a female football staff member also was
on the bike.  To contact the reporters on this story:
