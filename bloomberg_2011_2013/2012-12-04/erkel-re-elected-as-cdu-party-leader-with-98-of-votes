German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  won
the biggest support of any leader of the Christian Democratic
Union party since  Helmut Kohl  reunified Germany in 1990.  Merkel was re-elected as CDU leader with 97.9 percent of
the votes today in a poll in Hanover, Germany, after garnering
90.4 percent at the last election for the CDU leadership in
2010. Kohl’s score in 1990 was 98.5 percent.  Merkel, 58, told delegates she was “simply floored” by
the election result and spurred party members on to help her win
a third term in Germany’s next national election that’s likely
to be held in September 2013.  The chancellor is Germany’s most popular politician, ZDF
television’s monthly survey shows. Her CDU and its Bavarian
Christian Social Union sister party were at 37 percent support,
holding a 10-point lead over the opposition Social Democrats, in
a Forsa GmbH poll published Nov. 23.  “The result sounds like in communist East  Germany ,” said
Friedrich Thelen, founder of Thelen-Consult, a Berlin-based
business advisory group and former parliamentary editor of the
business magazine WirtschaftsWoche. “It shows that the CDU has
no ideological core anymore. Merkel is the CDU and the CDU is
Merkel, but the party needs debate if it wants to have a future
beyond Merkel.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
