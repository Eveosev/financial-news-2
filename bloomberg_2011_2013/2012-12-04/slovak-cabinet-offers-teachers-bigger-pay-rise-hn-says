Slovakia’s government increased its
offer to raise teachers’ pay to avert a resumption of their
strike,  Hospodarske Noviny  reported, citing Education Minister
Dusan Caplovic.  The government is offering an increase of as much as 7.5
percent, compared with its previous bid for a 5 percent rise and
the teachers’ union’s demand for 10 percent, the newspaper said.  Union leaders, who last week agreed to suspend the strike
after three days, are scheduled to discuss the offer today,
Hospodarske said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
