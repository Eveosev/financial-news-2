A Turkish coast guard vessel ran
aground while searching for survivors of a coal ship that sank
in the Black Sea, leaving at least two sailors dead and nine
missing.  One Turkish rescuer and a crew member from the coal ship
died, while another four crewmen were found alive,
Transportation Minister Binali Yildirim said in televised
remarks. Seven other coal crewmen were missing, Ankara-based
Anatolia news agency reported today, citing officials, while two
Turkish rescuers were also missing, it said.  The search was ordered after the Volgo Balt 199, flying the
flag of St. Kitts & Nevis, disappeared off the coast of the
Turkish resort town of Sile near Istanbul, Anatolia said. Eleven
Ukrainians and one Russian were aboard the ship, which was
carrying 3,300 metric tons of coal from  Russia  to the Turkish
port of Antalya, it said.  The Russian owner of the ship, Solna Shipping & Trading
Ltd., confirmed losing contact with the ship, according to
Anatolia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
