OAO Bank St. Petersburg fell to the
lowest level in more than three years after the Moscow Exchange
removed the regional lender from its dollar-denominated  RTS
Index (RTSI$)  effective Dec. 18.  Bank St. Petersburg declined 1.6 percent to 52.03 rubles by
the close, its weakest level since August 2009. The amount
traded was 46,120 shares, equivalent to 1.2 times the three-
month average. The shares have lost 28 percent this year as net
income in the first half tumbled.  “The bank’s liquidity is disappointing and its market
capitalization has declined,” Natalia Berezina, an analyst at
UralSib Capital, said by phone from Moscow. “This is another
negative factor for the lender.”  The Moscow Exchange will remove the lender and oil producer
OAO  TNK-BP Holding (TNBP)  from the RTS Index, while adding OAO Alrosa,
a Russian diamond miner, and OAO Sollers, an automaker, starting
Dec. 18, according to yesterday’s  statement . The changes are
part of the unification of the two gauges as  Russia ’s benchmark
 Micex Index (GZMICEX)  incorporates 20 new stocks with the largest market
capitalization, making it identical to the 50-stock RTS Index,
which is priced in dollars.  Bank St. Petersburg has the  lowest weighting  in the RTS
Index at 0.09 percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Alrosa
rose as much as 2.1 percent before trading up 0.8 percent at
24.057 rubles. Sollers declined 3 percent to 650 rubles. TNK-BP
retreated 2.1 percent to 58.82 rubles, extending its drop in the
year to 29 percent. The stock has a 0.3 percent weighting in
RTS.  BP Plc has agreed to sell its half of TNK-BP, the third-
largest Russian oil producer, to  OAO Rosneft (ROSN)  for $17 billion and
12.8 percent of Rosneft after years of disputes with its
billionaire partners.  To contact the reporter on this story:
