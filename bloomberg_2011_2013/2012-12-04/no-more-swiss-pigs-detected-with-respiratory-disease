Swiss authorities haven’t detected
additional cases of porcine reproductive and respiratory
syndrome after pigs on three farms in the east of the country
were found last week to be infected with the viral disease.  Preliminary serological tests of pigs at the farms show
“no indication that the disease has spread further,” the
Federal Veterinary Office in Bern said in a statement today.  The infected pigs, which were slaughtered last week, had
been inseminated with sperm imported from  Germany , the
government said. While the viral disease can cause reproductive
and respiratory problems, it’s not dangerous for humans, it
said.  The veterinary office said 27 pig farms with animals
inseminated with sperm from Germany have closed and animals from
the farms are subject to blood tests.  To contact the reporter on this story:
