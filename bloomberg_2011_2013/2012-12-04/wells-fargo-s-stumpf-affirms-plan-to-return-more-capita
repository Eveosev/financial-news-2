Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC) , the biggest U.S.
home lender, will ask regulators to let the bank return more
capital to shareholders, Chief Executive Officer  John Stumpf 
told investors.  Stumpf, speaking today at a New York conference sponsored
by Goldman Sachs Group Inc., said he couldn’t give specifics of
the plan, which requires review from the Federal Reserve.
Returning capital typically involves raising dividends and
buying back stock.  Stumpf, 59, has taken market share and reaped higher fees
in U.S. mortgages, where Wells Fargo accounted for 1 of every 3
home loans at midyear. While the San Francisco-based company
reported record third-quarter  profit , margins have been under
pressure as older, higher-yielding investments expire.  “I do believe we can grow net interest income into the
future, even in low rates and slow growth,” Stumpf said. “We
have more buttons to push.”  Wells Fargo gained 19 percent this year through yesterday,
trailing the 22 percent average for the 24-company KBW Bank
Index.  Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A) , controlled by billionaire  Warren
Buffett , is the  biggest stockholder .  To contact the reporter on this story:
