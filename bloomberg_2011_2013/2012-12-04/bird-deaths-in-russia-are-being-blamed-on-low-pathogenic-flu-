The H5N1 avian flu didn’t cause
deaths of wild birds in  Russia ’s southern Krasnodar region last
week, the government’s food safety agency said.  Lab tests proved a “low-pathogenic flu,” not H5N1, killed
hundreds of wild ducks in coastal lakes in the Anapa and Temryuk
districts in the Krasnodar region last week, said Alexei
Alekseenko, spokesman for Rosselkhoznadzor.  No poultry for human consumption was infected, Krasnodar’s
administration said on its website Nov. 30. Governor Alexander Tkachev ordered a quarantine of areas and banned hunting there
to keep the virus from spreading, the press service said.  Most bird viruses don’t infect humans, according to the
 World Health Organization . The disease can be spread by wild
water fowl, the WHO says.  Rosselkhoznadzor will eliminate dead birds from the area
and will not cull other ducks, Alekseenko said. There were about
12,000 wild ducks in the Krasnodar areas last week, according to
Rosselkhoznadzor data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
