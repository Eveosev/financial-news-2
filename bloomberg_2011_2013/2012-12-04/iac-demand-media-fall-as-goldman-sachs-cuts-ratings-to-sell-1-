IAC/InterActiveCorp. (IACI) , the Internet
company founded by  Barry Diller , tumbled the most in almost six
weeks after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. cut its rating on the stock
to sell, citing increased competition for Web visitors.  The shares fell 7.8 percent to $43.50 at the close in New
York, the biggest one-day decline since Oct. 24. The stock has
gained 2.1 percent this year.  Companies that depend on users finding them through
Internet searches, including IAC,  Demand Media Inc. (DMD)  and  AOL
Inc. (AOL) , are under threat from changes to Google Inc.’s policies
and increased competition, Heath Terry, a Goldman analyst, said
in a note to investors today. They are paying more money to show
up more frequently in search results, which makes their business
model less sustainable, Terry said.  “While the companies may be able to continue this
business, as IAC has for years now, we believe, at best, the
cost of those revenues will increase as competition increases,
while at worst significant segments of those revenues could be
eliminated by policy changes,” said Terry, who had previously
given IAC a neutral rating.  Internet searches account for more than half of the revenue
at IAC, which owns Ask.com and earlier this year purchased
About.com from the  New York Times Co. (NYT)   Goldman Sachs also downgraded Demand Media to sell from
neutral. The company’s shares fell 6.5 percent to $8.63.  To contact the reporter on this story:
