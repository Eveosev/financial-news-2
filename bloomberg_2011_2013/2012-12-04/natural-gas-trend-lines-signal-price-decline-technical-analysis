Natural gas futures will fall in the
next month, based on a  technical analysis  of trend lines by
Piper Jaffray Cos. that shows recent highs and lows.  A five-year weekly chart of trading ranges shows that gas
on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  is currently testing its
upper price limit, said  Craig Johnson , technical market
strategist with the company in  Minneapolis .  “We’ve been making lower lows and lower highs since
2008,” Johnson said in a phone interview yesterday.
“Technically, I think this is an area that natural gas would
fail because you are at a key inflection point,” he said. The
market is “at the very upper end of this downward trend.”  A six-month chart of daily prices shows gas may tumble to a
support level of $3.20 to $3.30 per million British thermal
units in the next month, Johnson said. The futures may test the
50-day moving average for a few days before breaking lower, he
said. The average, a short-term support level, was $3.538 per
million Btu yesterday.  There would need to be a reversal in fundamentals, either
through an increase in demand or a drop in supplies, to upset
the trend lines, Johnson said.  Gas for January delivery rose 3 cents, or 0.8 percent, to
settle at $3.591 per million Btu yesterday on the exchange. Gas
has fallen 8 percent since closing at a 13-month high of $3.903
on Nov. 21.  To contact the reporter on this story:
