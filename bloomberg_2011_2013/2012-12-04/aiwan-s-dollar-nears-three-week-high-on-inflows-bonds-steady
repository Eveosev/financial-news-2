Taiwan ’s dollar traded near a three-
week high after foreign funds boosted holdings of the island’s
stocks amid optimism the economy is recovering. Government bonds
were steady.  Overseas investors bought $355 million more local shares
than they sold in the past two days, after net purchases of
$1.42 billion in November, exchange data show. Reports this week
are forecast to show inflation slowed to a five-month low in
November and exports rebounded, according to Bloomberg surveys.
The central bank has held its  benchmark interest rate  at 1.875
percent since June 2011 and will review policy again on Dec. 19.  “There’s money coming in,” said Albert Lee, a fixed-
income trader in Taipei at Cathay United Bank Co. “Inflation
has stabilized and it should be out of the picture in terms of
the interest-rate decision making. The central bank will
probably keep interest rates unchanged.”  Taiwan’s dollar closed at NT$29.116 against its U.S.
counterpart, little changed from NT$29.121 yesterday, based on
Taipei Forex Inc. prices. The currency reached NT$29.019
yesterday, the strongest level since Nov. 13. One-month implied
volatility, a measure of expected moves in exchange rates used
to price options, slipped nine basis points, or 0.09 percentage
point, to 3.19 percent.  Consumer prices rose 2.04 percent in November from a year
earlier after a 2.36 percent increase in October, according to
the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey before data due
tomorrow. Exports climbed 7.8 percent following a 1.9 percent
drop the previous month, another survey showed before a report
on Dec. 7.  The yield on the government’s 1.125 percent bonds due
September 2022 was little changed at 1.134 percent, according to
Gretai Securities Market. The overnight  interbank lending rate 
was steady at 0.384 percent, according to a weighted average
compiled by the Taiwan Interbank Money Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
