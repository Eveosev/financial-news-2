Spanish registered unemployment rose
for the fourth month in November as companies struggling to
survive the five-year economic slump used new labor rules to
fire workers.  The number of people registering for jobless benefits rose
by 74,296 from October to 4.91 million, the Labor Ministry in
 Madrid  said today. That compares with an increase of 59,536 in
November of last year.  Spain’s recession may deepen next year, which the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development says may
push the  jobless  rate to 27 percent. Companies including  Amper
SA (AMP)  are using labor rules introduced by the year-old government
to fire workers more cheaply, while nationalized lender Bankia
group plans 6,000 job cuts as a condition for the nation’s
European bank bailout.  To contact the reporter on this story:
