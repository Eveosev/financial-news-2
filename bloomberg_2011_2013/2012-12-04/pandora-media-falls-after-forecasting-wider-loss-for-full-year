Pandora Media Inc. (P) , the Internet
radio company, tumbled the most in more than a month after
saying advertiser caution about spending will lead to a wider
full-year loss than the company had forecast.  Pandora fell 17 percent to $7.82 at 11:39 a.m. and earlier
tumbled 18 percent for the biggest intraday decline since Oct.
25. The Oakland, California-based company’s shares had fallen
5.6 percent this year through yesterday.  Advertisers are wary of making commitments in the new year
out of concern over the so-called fiscal cliff negotiations in
 Washington , Chief Executive Officer  Joe Kennedy  said in a phone
interview. The loss for the fiscal year ending Jan. 31 will be 9
cents to 12 cents a share, the company said in a statement,
wider than the loss of 4 cents to 8 cents forecast in August.  “There are concerns about the effect the fiscal cliff will
have on growth, and it’s reduced our visibility,” Kennedy said.
“When our clients are cautious, we have to be cautious.”  The company lowered its sales forecast to $422 million to
$425 million, from as much as $432 million previously.  Advertisers have been growing more cautious over the past
couple of months, Kennedy said.  President  Barack Obama  and Congress are negotiating to
avoid the fiscal cliff, pending tax increases and spending cuts
that take effect in 2013 if an alternate agreement isn’t
reached.  Music royalties, at 55 percent of sales, are Pandora’s
largest cost and growing faster than advertising, the principal
revenue source.  Content Costs  Pandora is part of a group including Clear Channel
Communications Inc. that backs U.S. legislation to unify music
royalties paid by Web, cable and satellite services. Rich Tullo,
an Albert Fried & Co. analyst, estimates the bill could cut
content costs in half.  “Paying royalties for every song played means that greater
usage results in higher costs,”  John Tinker , an analyst at
Maxim Group LLC in  New York , wrote in a Dec. 3 report.  The fourth-quarter loss excluding some items will be 6
cents to 9 cents a share, the company said.  Sales will be $120
million to $123 million. Analysts had estimated $130.2 million.  Pandora posted third-quarter profit that exceeded analyst’s
estimates, on higher advertising and subscriber revenue. Net
income rose to $2.05 million, or 1 cent a share, in the quarter
ended Oct. 31 from $638,000, or break-even per share, a year
earlier, the company said.  Earnings of 5 cents excluding some items beat the 1-cent
average estimate of 19 analysts, compiled by Bloomberg. Sales
climbed 60 percent to $120 million, exceeding the $117.1 million
average of 22 estimates.  Mobile ad sales grew 112 percent to $73.9 million in the
quarter, Kennedy said, outpacing the 85 percent gain in mobile
listeners.  “Mobile is our core focus,” Kennedy said. “Those lines
are crossing.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
