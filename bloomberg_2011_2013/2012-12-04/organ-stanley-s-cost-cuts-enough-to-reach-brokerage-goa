Morgan Stanley’s wealth-management
business can reach profitability targets solely through cost
cuts, meaning revenue improvements may provide a further boost,
said  Greg Fleming , president of the unit.  Integration expenses will end this quarter, allowing the
pretax profit margin to increase next year, said Fleming, who
last year laid out a goal of a “mid-teens” margin by the
middle of 2013. The brokerage is also trying to boost revenue
through more lending and moving additional client assets into
managed accounts, he said today at an investor conference in New
York.  Integration of the brokerage joint venture with  Citigroup
Inc. (C)  took longer than the firm expected and the business missed
the 15 percent profit target Morgan Stanley Chief Executive
Officer  James Gorman  had forecast for the end of 2010. The
margin was 13 percent in the third quarter, excluding one-time
items.  Morgan Stanley (MS)  plans to ask the Federal Reserve for
approval to buy Citigroup’s remaining 35 percent stake next
year, a person familiar with the strategy said in October.  Morgan Stanley today also quantified the impact
improvements in the equity market would have on the New York-
based firm’s pretax profit. The brokerage’s pretax earnings
would climb $250 million if the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  rose
to 1,600 from yesterday’s close of 1409.46, according to
Fleming’s presentation. Profit would jump $750 million if the
S&P 500 increased to 2,000. The unit had pretax earnings of
$1.28 billion in 2011.  If the Fed raised its benchmark  funds rate  by 1.5
percentage points and Morgan Stanley acquired the rest of the
business from Citigroup, gaining access to $58 billion of
additional deposits, the unit’s pretax profit would climb $1.1
billion, according to the presentation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
