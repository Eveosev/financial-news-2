European gasoline declined as
Trafigura Beheer BV and Chevron Corp. sold on the barge market.  Gasoil slumped with  Brent crude  on the ICE Futures Europe
exchange in London. January gasoil, which dropped as much as 1.3
percent, has technical support at $930.50 a metric ton,
according to Futurestechs.com Ltd.  Light Products  Gasoline for immediate loading in the Amsterdam-Rotterdam-
Antwerp hub traded from $953 to $957 a ton, according to a
Bloomberg survey of traders and brokers monitoring the Argus
Bulletin Board. That compares with trades from $967 to $973
yesterday.  Gunvor Group Ltd. bought two lots of Eurobob grade, to
which ethanol is added to make the finished fuel. Trafigura was
also a buyer of two barges, which usually comprise 1,000 to
2,000 tons.  The fuel’s  crack , or premium to Brent, snapped six days of
gains to fall 15 cents to $4.59 a barrel as of 10:48 a.m. local
time, according to PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a crude and products
broker in  London .  Naphtha’s crack , or discount to Brent, widened to $5.49 a
barrel, PVM data showed. That compares with $4.99 yesterday.  Middle Distillates  Gasoil for December delivery declined $12.25, or 1.3
percent, to $937.50 a ton on the ICE exchange as of 12:42 p.m.
London time. The January contract was at $940.25.  The market has been in a contango for 17 days, the longest
stretch since a run that ended on Aug. 4, 2011. A contango
structure usually signals reduced prompt demand or rising supply
of fuel for immediate delivery.  January futures have support at $930.50 a ton after prices
failed to sustain gains above $962 a ton yesterday, Liam Roberts, an analyst at Futurestechs, a researcher in Billericay,
 England , said in a note today.  The contract made a so-called bearish shooting star pattern
on a candlestick chart yesterday, according to Futurestech. The
formation occurs when a security that has been rising has an
opening price, intraday low and close well below the session’s
high.  Gasoil’s crack  fell 14 cents to $16.54 a barrel. Brent
dropped 1.2 percent to $109.59 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
