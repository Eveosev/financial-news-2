Washington Redskins cornerback Cedric Griffin was suspended without pay for four games after violating
the National Football League’s performance-enhancing drug
policy.  Griffin, 30, will be eligible to return to the team’s
active roster on Dec. 31, the day after the Redskins’ regular-
season finale against the  Dallas Cowboys , the NFL said in an e-
mailed statement. The specific drug he tested positive for
wasn’t disclosed.  Griffin, who started one of nine games he played in this
season, had 33 total tackles and one forced fumble. He was
selected in the second round of the 2006  NFL draft  by Minnesota
and started for the Vikings from 2007-2011. He joined Washington
as a free agent during the off season.  Washington is 6-6 this season, tied with the Cowboys and
one game behind the  New York  Giants (7-5) in the National
Football Conference’s East Division.  To contact the reporter on this story:
