Serbian banks granted 995.5 million
euros ($1.3 billion) in loans to companies between September and
end-November, the  Finance Ministry  said.  Almost 65 percent were new loans, 25.7 percent was for
refinancing while 9.8 percent supported exporters, according to
figures from the ministry. The ministry did not provide figures
for the same period last year.  Serbia boosted loan subsidies to more than 1 billion dinars
($87 million) in October to encourage banks to lend to companies
facing liquidity problems during the Balkan nation’s second
recession in three years.  The government will almost triple subsidies given to banks
in 2013 to 3.44 billion dinars, according to next year’s budget
adopted by parliament on Dec. 1.  The incentives are programmed to last through June next
year and will be replaced with a 500 million-euro loan facility
from the  European Investment Bank , which offers private sector
access to cheaper and longer-term funding.  To contact the reporter on this story:
