Vandals destroyed 62,600 liters
(16,537 gallons) of future  Brunello di Montalcino  when they
raided a cellar in the wine-rich Tuscan hills, the producer
said.  “During the night between December 2 and 3, unknown people
broke into our cellar,” Case Basse’s owner Gianfranco Soldera
said in a  statement  posted on the winery’s website today. The
intruders “opened the valves of 10 barrels of six vintages of
future Brunello di Montalcino” through 2012.  Brunello, one of  Italy ’s best known and most expensive red
wines, is made exclusively with Sangiovese grapes according to
standards set in 1888 for the producers. The wine is aged in oak
casks for five years before it can be drunk.  No bottle was stolen in the Case Basse’s cellar in what
former insurance broker Soldera said was “an extremely serious
act of deliberate crime,” according to the statement. The loss
of the wine results in “considerable economic damage.”  “It’s premature to estimate the exact loss as we will have
to calculate with our insurers,” Soldera said in a telephone
interview from his home in Montalcino, 70 miles (113 kilometers)
southwest of Florence. “At present, I myself sell the bottles
of the most recent year, 2006, for 110 euros each.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
