More  U.S.-listed Chinese companies 
are under the threat of going private or being delisted after
U.S. regulators accused accounting firms’ affiliates of blocking
probes into potential fraud, Dorsey & Whitney LLP said.  Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu CPA Ltd., Ernst & Young Hua Ming
LLP, KPMG Huazhen and PricewaterhouseCoopers Zhong Tian CPAs
Ltd. have refused to cooperate with accounting investigations
into nine companies whose securities are publicly traded in the
U.S., the Securities and Exchange Commission said in an
administrative order yesterday. BDO China Dahua Co. was also
named by the SEC in the action.  “This SEC proceeding may also encourage even more Chinese
companies to go private or go dark to avoid the further threat
raised by these issues,” Ted Farris, a New York-based partner
at Dorsey & Whitney, which has represented more than 10 U.S.-
listed Chinese companies in their proposed going-private or
delisting deals since 2010, said in an e-mail today. “Under SEC
rules, if the SEC proceeding is successful, it can temporarily
or permanently bar the Chinese accounting firms from filing
audit opinions on U.S. publicly traded Chinese companies.”  The  Bloomberg Chinese Reverse Mergers Index (CHINARTO) , which tracks a
basket of companies that gained U.S. listings after buying firms
that already trade, has lost 60 percent over the past two years.
Companies from China MediaExpress Holdings Inc. to Longtop
Financial Technologies Ltd. disclosed financial irregularities
or auditor resignations as short-selling firms such as Muddy
Waters LLC helped fuel scrutiny.  To contact the reporter on this story:
