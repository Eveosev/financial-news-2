  Japan  is sticking by its pledge to
reduce carbon emissions by 25 percent in 2020 from 1990 levels,
envoy Masahiko Horie said today in an interview in Doha
where the second of two weeks of climate talks began yesterday.  “The Japanese government has not pulled down that
target,” Horie said. “Of course” it’s still 25 percent, he
said. When asked if the government was in discussions to lower
the goal, he said “not exactly,” without elaborating.  To contact the reporter on this story:
