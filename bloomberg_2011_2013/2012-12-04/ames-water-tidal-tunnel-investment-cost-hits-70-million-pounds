Thames Water Utilities Ltd., the
U.K.’s largest water supplier, said investments to develop the
Thames Tideway Tunnel project totalled 69.7 million pounds ($112
million) for the six-month period ending Sept. 30.  As proposed, the Tideway Tunnel will intercept at least 18
million tons of untreated sewage and wastewater that enters the
River Thames tidal area each year through sewer overflows, the
British water company said in a statement.  Thames Water said it’s working with stakeholders “to
ensure the project is delivered in a way that gives value for
customers’ money” and that the investment bank  UBS AG (UBSN)  has been
selected to help develop a cost-effective financial structure
for an infrastructure provider independent of Thames Water to
raise finance and build the Thames Tideway Tunnel.  Kemble Water Holdings Ltd.’s Thames Water unit serves 14
million mainly residential customers in  London  and parts of the
Home Counties that surround the U.K.’s biggest city.  To contact the reporter on this story:
