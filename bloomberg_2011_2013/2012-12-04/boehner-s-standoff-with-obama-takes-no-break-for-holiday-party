Amid the public offers and
counteroffers to deal with the fiscal cliff, House Speaker  John Boehner  and President  Barack Obama  skipped a chance for a casual
talk.  Boehner was among the guests last night at the annual White
House holiday reception for members of Congress. The speaker
didn’t join the receiving line to pose for a picture with the
president nor did he talk with Obama while he was there,
according to an administration official.  The two sides remain far apart with about four weeks left
before more than $600 billion in tax increases and federal
spending cuts start taking effect, possibly triggering a
recession.  To contact the reporter on this story:
