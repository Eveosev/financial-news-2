A list of patents in  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s
settlement with  HTC Corp. (2498)  must be disclosed in the iPhone
maker’s litigation with Samsung Electronics Co., a federal judge
in California ruled.  U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh in San Jose, California, said
yesterday that while pricing and royalty terms of the agreement
may be sealed, a list of patents covered by the settlement
doesn’t meet the “compelling reasons” required for such terms
to be withheld.  In August, Apple won a $1.05 billion patent-infringement
verdict in a jury trial against Samsung in San Jose. U.S.
District Judge Lucy H. Koh scheduled a Dec. 6 hearing for
Apple’s bid for a permanent U.S. sales ban on eight Samsung
smartphone models.  Samsung has argued terms of the licensing agreement are
“highly relevant” to Apple’s request for an order blocking
U.S. sales of  Samsung smartphones .  Apple, which had accused HTC of copying features that made
its iPhone unique, on Nov. 10 settled all global lawsuits with
HTC and agreed to a 10-year licensing deal.  Kristin Huguet, an Apple spokeswoman, didn’t immediately
return an e-mail after business hours seeking comment on the
ruling.  The cases are Apple Inc. v.  Samsung Electronics Co. (005930)  Ltd.,
11-cv-1846 and 12-cv-630, U.S. District Court, Northern District
of California (San Jose).  To contact the reporter on this story:
