Intel Corp. (INTC)  sold $6 billion of bonds
in the largest dollar-denominated sale since Abbott Laboratories
raised $14.7 billion on Nov. 5, Bloomberg data show.  The offering, which topped the company’s previous record,
its $5 billion issue from September 2011, is being used to
repurchase  stock  that’s trading at about the lowest level in 16
months.  The world’s largest semiconductor maker, whose attempt with
Microsoft Corp. to combat Apple Inc.’s iPad in the $63.2 billion
tablet market is getting off to a slow start, issued $3 billion
of 1.35 percent, five-year securities to yield 75 basis points
more than similar-maturity Treasuries, $1.5 billion of 2.7
percent, 10-year bonds at a relative yield of 115 basis points,
and $750 million each of 4 percent, 20-year securities at 130
basis points and 4.25 percent of 30-year debt at 150, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The 20-year portion was added after the deal was marketed
earlier today, according to a person familiar with the
transaction, who asked not to be identified citing lack of
authorization to speak publicly. Proceeds will fund general
corporate purposes and previously announced stock buybacks,
 Santa Clara , California-based Intel said in a regulatory filing.  The company’s $1.5 billion of 4.8 percent securities sold
last year and maturing in October 2041 traded at 112 cents on
the dollar on Nov. 30 to yield 4.09 percent with a 132 basis-
point spread over similar-maturity Treasuries, according to
Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority.  The new bonds are rated A1 by Moody’s Investors Service and
A+ by  Standard & Poor’s , the ratings companies said today in
separate statements.  Shares of Intel  have lost  15 percent including reinvested
dividends this year and fell to $19.36 on Nov. 21, the lowest
closing price since August 2011. The stock rose 2.2 percent to
$19.97 today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
