Circle Holdings Plc (CIRC)  Chief Executive
Officer Ali Parsa relinquished his post, and the U.K. hospital
company said Steve Melton will replace him on an interim basis.  Parsa, a 47-year-old former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. banker
and a founder of the company, is leaving by “mutual” decision
to pursue other projects, Circle spokeswoman Christina Robinson
said by phone. He will remain a non-executive director and the
company will search for a permanent successor, she said.  Melton, 50, joined the company in 2008 and led the opening
of Circle’s hospitals in Bath and Reading, England, the London-
based company said in a statement. He is the company’s head of
mobilization as well as a director of Nations Healthcare Ltd.
and several affiliates of Circle. He has a 1.5 percent stake in
Circle Partnership Ltd., a unit of Circle Holdings, the company
said.  Circle also runs a U.K. government hospital in
Hinchingbrooke,  England  that it took over from the  National
Health Service  in February, the first NHS district hospital to
be operated as a franchise. The hospital was running a deficit
of more than twice that planned in the first half of its fiscal
year, a government auditor said on Nov. 8.  The stock, which began trading in June 2011, has dropped 58
percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
