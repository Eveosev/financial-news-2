One of two Queens, New York, men
accused last year of plotting to attack synagogues pleaded
guilty in state court in  Manhattan .  Ahmed Ferhani, 27, a native of  Algeria , entered guilty
pleas to 10 counts today. New York State Supreme Court Justice
Michael Obus agreed to sentence him to 10 years in prison and
five years of post-release supervision pending a presentence
report. Prosecutors had sought a 14-year term.  Ferhani was arrested in May 2011 along with Mohamed
Mamdouh, 21, a Moroccan immigrant, and accused of conspiring to
bomb synagogues and churches in Manhattan. Both initially
pleaded not guilty. Mamdouhâ€™s next court appearance is scheduled
for Jan. 7.  The men were apprehended after buying two Browning semi-
automatic pistols, a Smith & Wesson revolver, ammunition and an
inert grenade. The arrests followed an eight-month undercover
operation by Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance and the New
York City Police Department.  According to their indictment, Ferhani and Mamdouh said
they wanted to blow up a synagogue and discussed how to do it
without being caught. Ferhani also asked an undercover detective
if he could contact someone about how to make a bomb, said they
should dress as Jewish worshipers, and wanted to blow up 10
synagogues at once, prosecutors said in the indictment.  The case is New York v. Ferhani, 2461/2011, New York State
Supreme Court, New York County (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
