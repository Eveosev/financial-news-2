SunPower Corp. (SPWR) , a U.S. solar panel
maker, said it extended a supply agreement with Japan’s  Toshiba
Corp. (6502)  through 2018.  Under the accord, SunPower will provide more than 100
megawatts of its highest-efficiency residential solar panels
annually to Toshiba, the San Jose, California-based company said

SunPower’s modules.  SunPower has delivered more than 150 megawatts of solar
