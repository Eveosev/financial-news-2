Diesel fuel in the  New York  Harbor
weakened to trade at the  smallest premium  versus futures since
September on speculation distillate supplies will build as
refineries increase rates.  Supplies of  distillates , including heating oil and diesel,
probably gained 850,000 barrels last week, according to the
median estimate of 12 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The Energy
Department is scheduled to report last week’s inventory data
tomorrow in  Washington .  Stockpiles are expected to advance as Phillips 66 plans to
return units to service at its Borger, Texas, refinery and after
 Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) ’s diesel hydrotreater at the Baytown refinery
was back in operation. Refineries probably operated at 89.1
percent of capacity in the week ended Nov. 30, up 0.5 percentage
point from the prior week, according to the survey.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel in the New York Harbor declined
2.75 cents to 6.25 cents a gallon over futures on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange  at 2:48 p.m. That’s the narrowest gap since
Sept. 18 and the  fifth consecutive  decline. Reformulated, 84-
octane gasoline fell 1.25 cents to trade at 2.88 cents above
futures.  Phillips 66 (PSX) ’s 146,000-barrel-a-day  Borger refinery  is
restarting process units after finishing maintenance and should
be producing fuel at full capacity in a week, a person familiar
with the operations said. A turnaround at the plant began in
late September after being delayed about 30 days.  The Baytown refinery’s diesel hydrotreater was back in
operation today, according to Patricia Errico, an Exxon
spokeswoman at the plant. The unit was after it was damaged in a
fire Oct. 3. Baytown has a capacity of 584,000 barrels per day,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
