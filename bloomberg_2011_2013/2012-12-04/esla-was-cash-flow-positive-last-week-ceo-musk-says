Tesla Motors Inc. (TSLA) , the maker of
electric vehicles led by billionaire Elon Musk, was  cash flow 
positive last week, the chief executive officer said yesterday
in a posting on Twitter.  “Am happy to report that Tesla was narrowly cash flow
positive last week,” Musk, 41, wrote in the  message  to his
almost 113,000 followers. “Continued improvement expected
through year end.” Musk’s message, which was re-posted more
than 600 times by Twitter users, provided no additional
information.  Tesla, which hasn’t turned a quarterly profit, is racing to
expand production of the rechargeable Model S sedan at its
factory in Fremont,  California . The base price of the car will
increase by $2,500 to $59,900 on Jan. 1, the  Palo Alto ,
California-based company said last week in a statement.  “Tesla continues to make marked progress in ramping its
production capabilities,”  Amir Rozwadowski , a New York-based
analyst with Barclays Plc, wrote today in a report. “Tesla’s
ability to achieve consistent cash flow generation would be
viewed as a critical milestone” and help the company go from
“an upstart innovator to a sustainable operating entity,” said
Rozwadowski, who rates the shares overweight.  The Model S last month was named 2013 “Car of the Year”
by Motor Trend magazine, the first time the award has gone to an
electric vehicle. Tesla has said it will build at least 20,000
of the cars at the Fremont plant next year, and add the Model X
electric sport-utility vehicle in 2014.  The Model S, which qualifies for a $7,500 tax credit,
travels between 160 miles (257 kilometers) and 300 miles solely
on electricity, depending on the size of battery pack purchased.  Tesla dropped 2.1 percent to $33.90 at the close in  New
York . The  shares  have climbed 19 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
