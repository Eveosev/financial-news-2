China’s stocks  rose, spurring a
rebound for the benchmark index from the lowest level since
January 2009, after valuations fell to a record.  Ping An Insurance (Group) Co. climbed 2.1 percent and Anhui
Conch Cement Co. advanced for a fifth day as Haitong Securities
Co. recommended insurance and cement stocks for next year. Bank
of Communications Co. advised investors to buy cyclical stocks
in the first half of 2013. PetroChina Co., the most heavily
weighted stock on the index, gained the most in more than two
months after valuations plunged to an all-time low last week.  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  added 0.8 percent to 1,975.14
at the close, erasing a drop of as much as 0.5 percent. The  CSI
300 Index (SHSZ300)  advanced 1.1 percent to 2,131.47, while the  Hang Seng
China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  rose 0.5 percent. The  Bloomberg China-US
55 Index (CH55BN)  lost 0.9 percent in  New York .  “The  stock index  has fallen a lot so it’s natural for
investors to play catch up,” Huang Xuejun, a strategist at
Guoshen Securities Co., said by phone in Shanghai. “However the
gain won’t be sustainable nor huge because we haven’t seen any
new policy stimulus. The index is unlikely to rise too much the
rest of the year.”  The Shanghai Composite trades at 10.9 times reported
earnings, the lowest level since at least 1997, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The index has fallen 10 percent this
year, heading for a third straight year of losses, amid
estimates the economy will grow at its slowest pace in a more
than a decade this year.  Trading volumes in the Shanghai Composite were 4.7 percent
above the 30-day average, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Thirty-day  volatility  in the gauge was at 13.8,
compared with this year’s average of 17.2.  Growth Outlook  China  may maintain its annual economic growth target at 7.5
percent next year in a sign the new leadership headed by  Xi
Jinping  won’t tolerate a bigger slowdown.  Nine of 16 analysts surveyed Nov. 22-30 by  Bloomberg News 
forecast the government will set a goal unchanged from 2012,
while six expect a decline to 7 percent and one sees an increase
to 8 percent. Top economic officials meet this month to map out
policies for 2013 and may set the target that will be officially
announced in March at the annual session of parliament.  China’s stocks will perform better next year as the economy
and liquidity improve, according to Bank of Communications.  The economy is “reflating” given signs of rising
inflation and bottoming growth, Hao Hong, Hong Kong-based
managing director of research, said in a report to clients.  Investors should buy cyclical stocks in the first half of
2013 and so-called defensive companies in the second half, he
said. Hong was the only strategist among 13 brokerages surveyed
by Bloomberg at the start of the year to forecast declines for
Chinese stocks in 2012.  Ping An  A gauge of  financial companies  in the CSI 300 including
brokerages and insurers rose 1.3 percent, the third most among
10 industry groups.  Ping An, the second-biggest insurer, advanced 2.1 percent
to 37.39  yuan  and Anhui Conch, the largest cement producer, rose
0.6 percent to 16.61 yuan after Haitong Securities recommended
investors buy insurers and cement stocks for next year. The
Shanghai Composite may trade between 1,850 and 2,450 in 2013 as
earnings bottom out and possible system reforms after China’s
leadership change bolster confidence, Haitong Securities said in
a report.  The ratio of outstanding puts to sell Ping An versus calls
to buy slipped to 1.15-to-1 on Nov. 30 and reached 1.11 on Nov.
29, the lowest since August 2007, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. New China Life Insurance Co. added 4 percent to 19.72
yuan.  Brokerages Gain  Sinolink Securities Co. jumped 6.6 percent to 12.91 yuan,
the most since Nov. 6. Haitong Securities advanced 3.2 percent
to 8.15 yuan. China should further improve laws for companies’
public offerings, bond and private equity markets, as well as
asset management, China Securities Regulatory Commission
Chairman  Guo Shuqing  wrote in the Shanghai Securities News.  PetroChina, the nation’s biggest energy producer, rebounded
1.3 percent to 8.58 yuan. The stock trades at  11.8 times 
reported earnings, near the record low of 11.6 set on Nov. 30.  Liquor maker Jiuguijiu Co. rose 10 percent to 30.05 yuan,
paring losses over the past month to 47 percent. The company
said it has resumed a packaging production line after halting
output amid concerns of excessive chemicals in its drinks.  H Shares  Chinese companies traded on the mainland were 3.3 percent
cheaper than their Hong Kong-listed counterparts as of
yesterday, according to an index from  Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (11)  The
discount, which last week was the widest since January 2011,
shows global investors are more optimistic than locals on the
country’s growth prospects.  The  H-shares index  has jumped 16 percent since Sept. 5.
Yuan-denominated shares are restricted to domestic investors and
a limited number of foreign institutions, while their Hong Kong
counterparts are open to overseas investors.  The  Shanghai  Composite will rally 48 percent within nine
months after its decline below 1,960 signaled selling has
climaxed, according to Tom DeMark, the creator of indicators to
show turning points in securities.  The index will advance to 2,900 after its decline produced
a buy signal on the Sequential and Combo charts, designed to
identify market tops and bottoms, said DeMark, who has spent
more than 40 years developing market-timing indicators.  “Everyone is negative on SHCOMP index, absolutely
everyone,” DeMark wrote in an e-mail, referring to the Chinese
benchmark gauge’s ticker symbol. “And now is the perfect
environment to make a low and be positive as the last seller,
figuratively speaking, has sold.”  -- Editors: Allen Wan, Richard Frost  To contact the reporter on this story:
