Altera Corp., (ALTR)  a maker of programmable
chips used in phone systems, fell after saying fourth-quarter
sales may decline more than analysts had estimated, citing
weaker demand for its older products.  Sales will drop 8 percent to 10 percent from the third
quarter’s $495 million, the  San Jose , California-based company
said in a statement yesterday. The low end of that range would
indicate revenue of $445.5 million, compared with an average
analyst  prediction  of $455.2 million, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  Altera and Xilinx Inc. make chips that can be reprogrammed
even after they’ve been installed in electronics. Their
products, primarily used in wireless telecommunications
equipment, are increasingly being used to replace custom-
designed semiconductors in a wider range of devices, including
industrial equipment and consumer electronics.  Shares fell 3.6 percent to $31.01 at the close in New York,
leaving the stock down 16 percent this year.  In October, Altera had predicted sales would decline 6
percent to 10 percent in the fourth quarter from the third.  To contact the reporter on this story:
