CEZ AS (CEZ) , the Czech Republic’s largest
power producer, said its Temelin and Dukovany nuclear power
plants will produce a record amount of electricity this year and
plan to increase output further next year.  The Temelin nuclear power plant will produce 15 terawatt-
hours this year and Dukovany’s output may reach 16 terawatt-
hours, Vladimir Hlavinka, CEZ’s board member and director of the
production division, said at a press conference in Prague today.  The two plants produce 43 percent of CEZ’s total
electricity, the company said. Maintenance at Dukovany may be a
couple of days longer next year as the plant prepares to have
its 10-year operation license renewed, Hlavinka said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
