Money-market indicators signaled
short-term dollar funding were little changed.  Three-month London interbank offered rate, or Libor, which
represents the rate at which banks say it would cost to borrow
from another,  was  unchanged at 0.31050 percent, where it has
held since Nov. 28, according to the British Bankers’
Association. One-month Libor fell to 0.213 percent from 0.215
percent. The Libor-OIS spread, a gauge of banks reluctance to
lend, edged lower to 16.1 basis points from 16.6 basis points
yesterday.  Overnight index swaps, or OIS, give traders predictions on
where the Fed’s effective funds rate will average for the term
of the swap. The central bank’s target rate is set in a range of
zero to 0.25 percent.  Predictions in the forward market for Libor-OIS, known as
the FRA/OIS spread, fell to 18.1 basis points from 18.5 basis
points, according to the second rolling three-month contracts.  The difference between the two-year swap rate and the
comparable-maturity Treasury note yield, known as the swap
spread, was little changed at 11.94 basis points. The gap is a
gauge of investors’ perceptions of U.S. banking sector credit
risk as swap rates are derived from expectations for dollar
Libor.  Swap rates serve as benchmarks for investors in many types
of debt, including mortgage-backed and auto-loan securities.  The seasonally adjusted amount of U.S.  commercial paper 
rose $27.8 billion to $1.0256 trillion in the week ended Nov.
28, according to Federal Reserve data.  Euribor-OIS Spread  The cost for European banks to convert euro-denominated
payment streams into dollars-based funding via the cross
currency swaps market was unchanged. The three-month cross-
currency basis swap was 24.8 basis points below Euribor.  Foreign-exchange swaps are typically for periods of less
than a year, while cross-currency basis swaps usually range from
one to 30 years. The latter are agreements in which a person
borrows in one currency and simultaneously lends in a different
currency. The trade involves the exchange of two different
floating-rate payments, each denominated in a different currency
and based on a different index.  The Euribor-OIS spread, the difference between the euro
interbank offered rate and overnight indexed swaps was
unchanged. The measure of banks’ reluctance to lend to one
another was 12.6 basis points.  Repo Rates  The overnight Treasury general collateral repurchase
agreement rate opened today at 0.30 percent, according to ICAP
Plc, the world’s largest inter-dealer broker.  The  average rate  for borrowing and lending Treasuries for
one day in the repo market was 0.257 percent yesterday,
according to index data provided on a one-day lag by the
Depository Trust & Clearing Corp. That was little changed from
the day before. The rate was at 0.127 percent at the start of
the year.  Securities dealers use repos to finance holdings and
increase leverage. Securities that can be borrowed at interest
rates close to the Fed’s target rate are called general
collateral. Those in highest demand have lower rates and are
called “special.”  The  average rate  for overnight federal funds, known as the
fed effective rate, was 0.16 percent. The rate opened today at
0.17 percent. The effective rate is a volume-weighted average of
trades between major brokers for overnight funds, reported on a
day lag by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
