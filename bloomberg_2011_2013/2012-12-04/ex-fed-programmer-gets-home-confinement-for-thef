A computer programmer who worked for
a contractor at the  Federal Reserve Bank of New York  was
sentenced to six months of home confinement for stealing U.S.
Treasury Department software used to track federal collections
and payments.  Bo Zhang, a 33-year-old Chinese citizen, was sentenced
today in federal court in  Manhattan . Zhang pleaded guilty in May
to one count of theft of government property and one count of
immigration fraud for lying to immigration authorities in
support of other people’s visas.  The software, which cost millions of dollars to develop,
wasn’t given to anyone else and is still used by the government,
U.S. District Judge Paul Gardephe said in court today.  “It’s very difficult to reconcile Mr. Zhang’s criminal
conduct with his productive history in the country, his
educational attainments,” Gardephe said, citing achievements
including a master’s degree in computer science from  Dartmouth
College . “It’s apparent that if the code had been conveyed to
someone else, it could have been very damaging.”  Zhang was sentenced three years of supervised release along
with home confinement. Defense lawyer Jeffrey Lichtman said
during the hearing that Zhang, who was in the U.S. on a work
visa, probably will be deported.  Under non-binding federal sentencing guidelines, Zhang may
have faced 12 to 18 months in prison plus a fine of as much as
$30,000.  The case is U.S. v. Zhang, 1:12-cr-00390, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of  New York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
