Internet entrepreneur John McAfee, who is wanted for questioning in the shooting of a neighbor in  Belize , has fled to the neighboring Central American country of  Guatemala .  “It was not easy to exit Belize and required many supporters in many countries,” McAfee said on his  blog  today. “I am in Guatemala and will be meeting with Guatemalan officials this morning. If all goes well I will do a press conference tomorrow.”  McAfee, 67, has turned his run from authorities over the past month into a media spectacle, sending updates to Wired magazine and posting missives to his own website and Twitter account. He has discussed eluding authorities by burying himself in sand with a cardboard box and changing his appearance.  McAfee’s home on the island of Ambergris Caye was searched Nov. 11 after the murder of neighbor Gregory Faull, a 52-year- old contractor and Florida native. Authorities have said they want to question McAfee, who has not been charged with a crime, on what he knows about Faull.  Traveling Girlfriend  McAfee and his 20-year-old Belizean girlfriend met with a lawyer at a “luxurious resort in  Guatemala City ” over breakfast, Vice magazine  reported  on its website today after one of their reporters traveled with McAfee.  In an interview on Bloomberg Television’s “Bloomberg West” show yesterday, McAfee said he was being sought over a political vendetta after he didn’t donate enough money to the government.  McAfee relocated to Belize in 2008 after his $100 million fortune was reduced to $4 million following a series of failed investments in property, real estate and bonds at Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., according to a 2009 article in the  New York  Times.  Intel Corp. (INTC)  agreed to buy McAfee Inc. for $7.68 billion, at the time its largest acquisition, in 2010.  McAfee spokeswoman Tracy Ross said Nov. 12 that the company doesn’t comment on former employees and that the founder of the anti-virus software maker “retired from McAfee in 1994, and has not had any affiliation with the company since then.”  To contact the reporters on this story: Bill Faries in Miami at   wfaries@bloomberg.net ; Eric Sabo in Panama City at   esabo1@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story: Joshua Goodman at   jgoodman19@bloomberg.net
