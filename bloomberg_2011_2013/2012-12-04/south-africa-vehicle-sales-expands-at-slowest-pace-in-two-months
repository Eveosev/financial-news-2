South African vehicle sales increased
at the slowest pace in two months in November as economic growth
eased, the National Association of Automobile Manufacturers of
 South Africa  said.  Sales rose 7.3 percent from a year ago to 53,134 units, the
Pretoria-based group said in an e-mailed statement today.  Africa’s biggest economy is set to expand 2.5 percent this
year, the slowest pace since a 2009 recession, according to
government forecasts. The  Reserve Bank  last month held the
 benchmark  lending rate at 5 percent as quickening inflation
limited room to further stimulate growth following a surprise
rate-cut in July.  “Negative factors that could influence the new vehicle
market over the medium-term include a slowdown in the economy,
rising inflationary pressures as well as the impact of exchange
rate weakness,” the association said in the statement.  Sales growth for the full year remains on track to be about
10 percent, with a rise of 6 percent to 8 percent expected for
2013, it said.  Passenger-car sales increased 11 percent to 36,686 in
November from a year earlier, while vehicle exports rose 40
percent to 20,453.  To contact the reporter on this story:
