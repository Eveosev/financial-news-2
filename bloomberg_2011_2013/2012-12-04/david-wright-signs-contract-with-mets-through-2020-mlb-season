Third baseman David Wright signed a
contract extension with the  New York  Mets through 2020,
fulfilling what General Manager Sandy Alderson said was the
team’s top priority before next season.  Wright, 29, will appear today in a news conference at the
Major League Baseball Winter Meetings in Nashville,  Tennessee ,
where FoxSports.com reported free-agent pitcher Dan Haren had
agreed to a $13 million contract for 2013 with the Washington
Nationals.  The Mets didn’t release terms for Wright’s extension. The
eight-year deal is worth a franchise-record $138 million, the
Associated Press said, surpassing the $137.5 million, six-year
accord signed by pitcher Johan Santana in 2008.  “We said signing David to a contract that would keep him
in a Mets uniform was our top offseason priority,” Alderson
said yesterday in the team’s release. “Today is a historic day
for the franchise and an important step in securing a winning
future for this team and our fans.”  In 2012, Wright became the Mets’ career leader in hits,
runs scored, walks and runs batted in. Over his nine-year career
with the team, Wright has a .301 batting average with 790 runs
scored, 204 home runs, 818 runs batted in and 166 stolen bases
in 1,262 games. His 204 home runs rank third in club history
behind Darryl Strawberry (252) and Mike Piazza (220).  “I’ve grown up in this organization and made lifelong
friendships with teammates, uniform personnel and front office
staff,” Wright said in the team’s e-mailed statement. “I’m
grateful for the opportunity to finish what I’ve started and
help bring the Mets and our fans a World Series title.”  Haren’s Move  Wright, a six-time All-Star, hit .306 with 91 runs scored,
41 doubles, 21 home runs and 93 RBIs last season.  The deal for Haren, a 32-year-old right-hander, is pending
completion of a physical, FoxSports.com said, citing
unidentified people in MLB.  Haren was 12-13 last season with a 4.33 earned run average
for the Los Angeles Angels. A 10-year major league veteran with
a 119-97 career record, he received a $3.5 million buyout from
the Angels after the team declined to pick up a $15.5 million
contract option, FoxSports.com said.  He would join a Washington starting rotation that includes
 Stephen Strasburg , Gio Gonzalez, Jordan Zimmermann and Ross Detwiler, all in their 20s. The Nationals and Mets are both in
the National League East Division.  Free-agent outfielder Shane Victorino, 32, agreed to a $39
million, three-year deal with the Boston Red Sox, the
Associated Press reported.  To contact the reporters on this story:
