Rubber retreated from a six-week high
after U.S. manufacturing unexpectedly contracted, raising
concern that a recovery in the world’s biggest economy may stall.  Rubber for delivery in May lost as much as 1 percent to 261
yen a kilogram ($3,180 a metric ton) before trading at 261.4 yen
on the  Tokyo  Commodity Exchange at 11:54 a.m. The most-active
contract settled yesterday at the highest level since Oct. 18.
Futures have lost 0.7 percent this year.  The  Institute for Supply Management ’s U.S. factory index
fell to 49.5 in November from 51.7 a month earlier. Readings
below 50 indicate contraction. Japan’s currency climbed against
the dollar, cutting the appeal of yen-based contracts, after
Republicans rejected President  Barack Obama ’s demands for tax
increases and countered with a proposed $1.4 trillion in
spending cuts and $800 billion in new revenue.  “The market came under pressure as the U.S. data failed to
provide support and concerns about the fiscal cliff grew,”
 Kazuhiko Saito , an analyst at broker Fujitomi Co. in Tokyo, said
today by phone.  Losses in futures were limited after better-than-expected
sales of U.S. vehicles last month, he said. The annualized
industry wide light-vehicle sales  rate , adjusted for seasonal
trends, accelerated to 15.5 million, beating the 15 million
average estimate of analysts, to give the best monthly pace
since 15.6 million in January 2008, according to Autodata Corp.  Replacement demand from owners of damaged vehicles and
purchases deferred by  Hurricane Sandy  boosted U.S. light-vehicle
sales for the eight largest automakers.  Rubber for delivery in May lost 0.4 percent to 24,210  yuan 
($3,885) a ton on the Shanghai Futures Exchange. Thai rubber
free-on-board gained 1.1 percent to 92.60 baht ($3.02) a
kilogram yesterday, the Rubber Research Institute of Thailand
said on its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
