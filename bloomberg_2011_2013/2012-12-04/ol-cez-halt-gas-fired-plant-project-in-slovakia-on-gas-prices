A venture of  CEZ AS (CEZ)  and Mol Nyrt. put
on hold a project to build a gas-fired plant in Slovakia because
of high gas prices.  “We haven’t completely abandoned the project, but put it
on hold,” Slovnaft’s spokesman Anton Molnar said in a phone
interview today. “Currently, electricity prices are low and gas
prices are too high. We will start reconsidering the project
when the market conditions change.”  The venture received government approval in 2010 to build
an 880 megawatt gas-fired power plant near the Slovnaft
refinery, Mol’s unit in Slovakia. The plant was scheduled to be
operational in 2013 and its cost was estimated at as much as 720
million euros ($941 million) by the venture.  To contact the reporter on this story:
