Anvar Saidenov, chairman of defaulted
 BTA Bank (BTA) , was named independent director at Bank RBK,
 Kazakhstan ’s 26th-largest lender by assets.  Saidenov is set to lead several committees of the board,
including the risk committee, Almaty-based RBK said in a
statement e-mailed today.  Saidenov, a former central bank governor, became BTA’s
 chief executive officer  in February 2009 and was named chairman
in August last year. BTA, which is seeking to overhaul its debt
for a second time in as many years, targets reaching a
restructuring accord by the end of this year after failing to
make a January interest payment on dollar bonds due July 2018.
Kazakhstan’s sovereign wealth fund Samruk-Kazyna took over BTA,
the central Asian nation’s biggest bank by assets at the time,
two months before its default in April 2009.  RBK ’s board of directors is advised by Zhomart Yertayev,
former chief executive officer of Alliance Bank, the first
Kazakh lender to default in 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
