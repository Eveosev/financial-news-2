Free-agent pitcher Dan Haren agreed
on a one-year, $13 million contract with the Washington
Nationals, according to FoxSports.com.  The deal for the right-hander is pending completion of a
physical, the  website said , citing unidentified people in Major
League Baseball.  The 32-year-old Haren was 12-13 last season with a 4.33
earned run average for the Los Angeles Angels. A 10-year major
league veteran with a 119-97 career record, Haren received a
$3.5 million buyout from the Angels after the team declined to
pick up a $15.5 million contract option, FoxSports.com said.  He would join a starting rotation that includes  Stephen Strasburg , Gio Gonzalez, Jordan Zimmermann and Ross Detwiler,
all in their 20s.  New York  Mets third baseman David Wright passed his
physical and his contract extension officially will be announced
at a news conference tomorrow at baseballâ€™s winter meetings in
Nashville,  Tennessee , according to ESPN.  Wright, a six-time All-Star, will earn $138 million over
the next eight years, ESPN said on Nov. 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
