Kuwait  is seeking to produce 15
percent of its energy from renewables such as solar and wind by
2030, Emir Sabah al-Ahmad Al-Sabah said today.  Speaking at United Nations climate talks in Doha, the emir
said it was important for all nations to work on the “pressing
issue” of global warming. He said developing nations such as
his should not be forced to take on binding targets for reducing
greenhouse gas emissions.  Kuwait is the third-biggest producer in the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries and has capacity to generate about
10.9 gigawatts of electricity. Oil accounted for two-thirds of
Kuwait’s primary energy supply in 2009, up from about 58 percent
at the beginning of the decade, according to the International
Renewable Energy Agency. Natural gas makes up almost all the
rest.  The emir said that by 2015, Kuwait will produce about 1
percent of its electricity from renewables and that he would
like to boost that to 15 percent by 2030. Irena estimates the
nation has 70 megawatts of renewable projects, including 10
megawatts of photovoltaics, 50 megawatts of concentrated solar
power and 10 megawatts of wind.  The country has no projects registered under the Clean
Development Mechanism, Irena said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
