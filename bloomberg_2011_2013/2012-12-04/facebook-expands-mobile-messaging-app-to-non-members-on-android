Facebook Inc. (FB) , operator of the
world’s largest social network, is opening its mobile messaging
application in a bid to court new users.  A new feature will enable Android-based smartphone users to
send texts, photos and other content to each other starting
today in select countries, Facebook said in an e-mailed
statement. While the  Messenger app  required all users to be
Facebook members before, the service will now only need a phone
number.  Facebook is building out mobile features as people
increasingly turn to wireless devices for their communication
and computing needs. More than half of the social network’s 1
billion active users already access the service on smartphones
or tablets.  “You can create a Messenger account with just your name
and phone number, and start messaging your mobile contacts,”
Menlo Park, California-based Facebook said in the statement.
“We’re doing this because we’re serious about messaging and
realize that limiting the reach to just those on Facebook limits
the ability for people to reach anyone in their address book.”  The upgraded app, running on  Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s Android mobile
software platform, will initially be available in Australia,
India, Indonesia, South Africa and  Venezuela . Facebook said it
plans to expand it to other countries in the future. The
Messenger application will eventually become available on  Apple
Inc. (AAPL) ’s iPhone, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
