U.S. Small Business Administrator 
Karen Gordon Mills says small businesses are watching the fiscal
cliff debate with great interest because ahead of the holidays 
they want "to make sure their customers and consumers have some 
money in their pocket." Mills talked with Bloomberg's Kathleen 
Hays and Vonnie Quinn on December 3 on Bloomberg Radio's "The 
Hays Advantage."   (Source: Bloomberg)  Running time 13:31
