Solar Frontier K.K., a unit of
 Japan â€™s  Showa Shell Sekiyu K.K. (5002) , will supply 14 megawatts of
thin-film solar panels for four projects by  Mitsui & Co. (8031) , a
Japanese trading company.  Mitsui and its partners plan to invest 9 billion yen ($110
million) in 10 solar projects including at least four projects
using Solar Frontier modules across Japan by March 2014, Solar
Frontier said in a  statement  today.  The companies are also discussing other solar projects for
possible use of Solar Frontier products, according to the
statement.  Solar Frontier makes solar panels using copper, indium,
gallium and selenium, known as CIGS.  To contact the reporter on this story:
