Bank of America Corp.  won a federal
appeals court ruling upholding the dismissal of so-called double
derivative lawsuits over the lender’s 2009 merger with Merrill
Lynch & Co.  The lawsuits sought to hold Merrill responsible for losses
on allegedly risky investments in collateralized debt
obligations and mortgage-backed securities before it was
acquired by the bank, according to a March 2011 opinion by U.S.
District Judge Jed Rakoff in  Manhattan  throwing out the cases.  A  U.S. Court of Appeals  panel in  New York  today agreed with
Rakoff that plaintiffs in the two cases either initially failed
to demand that the bank’s directors pursue claims against former
Merrill officers, or couldn’t “show that the board had
wrongfully refused” requests to pursue the claims.  Rakoff said in his opinion that if the allegations in the
complaints were true, they describe “the kind of risky behavior
by high-ranking financiers that helped create the economic
crisis from which so many Americans continue to suffer.”  “The district court was well within its discretion” in
concluding that a plaintiff “failed to demonstrate that the
board acted in bad faith or conducted an unreasonable
investigation,” the appeals court said.  “We are pleased with the Court’s decision,” Lawrence Grayson, a spokesman for  Charlotte , North Carolina-based Bank of
America, said in an e-mailed message.  The cases are In Re: Merrill Lynch & Co. Securities
Litigation, 07-CV-09633, and N.A. Lambrecht v. O’Neal , 09-cv-
08259, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
