Candente Copper Corp. (DNT)  expects to make
new discoveries next year at its $1.5 billion Peruvian copper
deposit, the company’s chief executive officer said.  Candente is waiting for a water permit to complete a $30
million feasibility study for its Canariaco project in the
northern  Andes , CEO Joanne Freeze said today in an interview in
Lima.  Canariaco  Norte, one of three deposits in the company’s
concession, is feasible at a copper price as low as $2.25 per
pound, Freeze said.  “We also plan to be drilling at Canariaco Sur and Quebrada
Verde, where we could be making new discoveries,” Freeze said
today from the company’s headquarters. “We believe we should
get these permits fairly soon, as I have no reason to think it
would be another three months.”  Peru, the world’s third-largest copper producer, has lined
up $53 billion in mining projects over the next decade in a bid
to double output, according to the National Society of Mining,
Petroleum & Electricity, an industry group. Candente is holding
talks with prospective buyers for its Canariaco project, Freeze
said, without naming them.  Candente was unchanged at 27 Canadian cents at 3 p.m. in
Toronto.  To contact the reporter on this story:
