Monsanto Co. (MON) , the world’s biggest
seed company, will resume collecting royalties for its Roundup
Ready soybeans in Brazil while it appeals a state court ruling
there on intellectual property rights.  The Court of Justice in Mato Grosso ruled that collections
in the state can resume, St. Louis-based Monsanto said in a
statement on its website today. Monsanto, which last month
suspended collections nationwide after a court ordered them
stopped in the state, said it will begin collecting across the
country and hold Mato Grosso payments in escrow.  “This action reinforces our confidence in our ongoing
legal position and highlights that the company’s first-
generation Roundup Ready soybean products are protected by
various intellectual property rights under Brazilian law,” Todd
Rands, Monsanto legal director for Latin America, said in the
statement.  Growers in  Brazil  say the patent on the original Roundup
Ready soybeans expired in 2010, ending their obligation to pay
Monsanto a technology fee on the seeds. Monsanto says that
Brazilian law extends the patent to 2014, when it expires in the
U.S. Monsanto is counting on growth in Latin America,
particularly Brazil, to meet its earnings forecast.  The outcome of the case won’t effect sales of Intacta
soybeans, a newly patented product engineered to produce
insecticide and tolerate Roundup herbicide, Monsanto said.
Farmers are currently testing Intacta beans prior to the start
of full commercial sales in a year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
