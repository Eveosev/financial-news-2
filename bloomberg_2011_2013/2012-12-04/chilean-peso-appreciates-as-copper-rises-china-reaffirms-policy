Chile’s peso gained for the first
time in three days as  China  pledged to keep macroeconomic
policies stable and copper, the South American nation’s biggest
export earner, climbed to a six-week high.  The currency strengthened 0.2 percent to 480.52 per dollar
as of 12:49 p.m. in Santiago, erasing earlier declines of as
much as 0.4 percent. Copper for March delivery rose 0.6 percent
to $3.677 a pound.  China, the Andean country’s biggest export market, will
expand domestic demand and promote urbanization, the official
Xinhua News Agency said in the first assessment of the economy
under the country’s new leadership. The world’s second largest
economy will probably maintain its official annual growth target
of 7.5 percent next year, according to nine of 16 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg News last month.  “Things are flying here, with copper high and China
sticking at 7.5 percent,” said Alejandro Araya, a Santiago-
based currency trader at Banco Santander Chile. “I don’t see
how the dollar has a chance against the peso.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
