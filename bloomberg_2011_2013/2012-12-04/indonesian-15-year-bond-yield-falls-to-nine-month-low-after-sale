Indonesia ’s bonds rose, pushing the
15-year yield to the lowest level since February, after demand
surged at the government’s last securities auction of 2012. The
rupiah weakened.  The  finance ministry  raised 1.2 trillion rupiah ($125
million) yesterday from the sale, with bids exceeding the amount
offered by more than nine times, the debt management office said
in an e-mail. Demand for fixed-income notes rose after inflation
slowed to  4.32 percent  in November from 4.61 percent the
previous month, according to official data. The trade  balance 
swung to a record deficit of $1.5 billion in October, from a
revised surplus of $549.5 million in September.  “The very strong demand at the last auction cast positive
sentiment on the domestic  bond market ,” said Nurul Eti Nurbaeti, the Jakarta-based head of treasury research at PT Bank
Negara Indonesia. “The rupiah has been stable, despite the
trade situation. It will stay near this level until year-end.”  The yield on the government’s 7 percent notes maturing in
May 2027 dropped one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to
5.90 percent as of 3:39 p.m. in Jakarta, according to prices
from the Inter Dealer Market Association. That’s the lowest
level since Feb. 23.  The rupiah weakened 0.2 percent to 9,613 per dollar, the
biggest decline since Nov. 23, prices from local banks compiled
by Bloomberg show. One-month implied volatility, a measure of
expected moves in exchange rates used to price options, was
steady at 4.65 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
