Slovenia’s government must continue
to cut the  budget deficit  even as the euro-region nation
struggles with a  recession , the central bank said.  “Achieving a fiscal balance in the coming years is crucial
to lowering uncertainty in the economy and to ensure unhindered
access to funding on international markets,”  Banka Slovenije 
said in an e-mailed statement today. “For a credible
consolidation of public finances, their long-term viability must
be ensured, especially through a pension overhaul.”  The economy has been hit by faltering domestic demand
because of uncertainty in the labor market, the central bank
said. The unfavorable business climate, surplus capacity in
companies and difficulties obtaining credit are compounding the
problem, causing a fall in investment and inventories, it said.  Slovenia’s export-driven economy slid into its second
recession in three years in the third quarter as consumption
waned and exports to  Europe  slowed. The central bank predicts
gross domestic product will shrink 2 percent this year after
contracting 3.3 percent in the third quarter from a year ago.  Lawmakers in the capital, Ljubljana, are set to adopt
pension changes today after scrapping an extension of the
 retirement age .  Prime Minister  Janez Jansa ’s government wants to cut the
budget gap to about 4 percent of GDP this year from 6.4 percent
a year ago. Total debt is forecast to rise to 59 percent of GDP
by the end of 2013 from 47 percent at the end of 2011, according
to a Nov. 7 European Commission forecast.  To contact the reporter on this story:
