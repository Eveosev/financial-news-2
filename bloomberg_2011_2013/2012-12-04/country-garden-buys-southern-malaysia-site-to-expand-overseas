Country Garden Holdings Co. (2007) , the
developer controlled by Chinaâ€™s richest woman Yang Huiyan, said
it will buy prime waterfront land in southern  Malaysia , as the
company expands beyond its home market.  The Foshan, Guangdong-based company plans to develop the
55-acre land plot in Iskandar into an integrated property
project with a gross development value of 18 billion ringgit
($5.9 billion), Beatrice Wong, an external spokeswoman for
Country Garden, said in an e-mail. Iskandar is in the southern
Malaysian state of Johor near Singapore.  The developer said last year it took a 55 percent stake in
a joint venture in Malaysia to build homes in Selangor state.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
