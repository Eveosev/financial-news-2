State Oil Co. of Azerbaijan urged  BP
Plc (BP/)  for a rapid completion of repairs at the Caspian natural gas
field of Shah Deniz as demand for the fuel grows in winter.  One of the five wells at the field was shut for repairs
after technical problems last month, Xosbaxt Yusifzada, first
vice president of the state company known as Socar, said last
week. The closing led to an 18 percent drop in production to 23
million cubic meters a day from 28 million cubic meters.  “We want the repairs to be completed quickly,” Socar
President Rovnaq Abdullayev said today in the Azeri capital of
Baku. “It is winter now and we need extra volumes of gas.”  Shah Deniz produced 5.2 billion cubic meters of gas in the
first nine months, up 15 percent from a year earlier, BP said on
Nov. 26. Gas from the field is also exported to Georgia and
 Turkey  through the BP-led South Caucasus Pipeline.  To contact the reporter on this story:
