China will pay overdue subsidies to
renewable-power developers, bolstering  cash flow  at  China
Longyuan Power Group Corp. (916) ,  China Datang Corp. Renewable Power (1798) 
Co. and their peers following a two-year delay.  The government has asked power-grid companies to clear
payments for the seven months from October 2010, the National
Development and Reform Commission said yesterday in a statement
on its website. The NDRC didn’t comment on the rest of the
outstanding subsidies, which are fixed, above-market tariffs for
clean electricity output.  “This is good news for developers who haven’t yet received
their renewable feed-in premium” as the delay has erased cash
flow for many, Jessica Ng, an analyst at Bloomberg New Energy
Finance, said by e-mail. The transition to a new subsidy-
allocation system from April caused the holdup, she said.  The new system established a framework for grid companies
to receive funds directly from the  Finance Ministry  based on
estimated power generation, and to settle their accounts with
project developers every month. The last allocation from the
NDRC was for the period that ended in the third quarter of 2010,
according to London-based New Energy Finance.  China last year doubled surcharges on power users to 0.008
yuan a kilowatt-hour to subsidize renewable-energy projects.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
