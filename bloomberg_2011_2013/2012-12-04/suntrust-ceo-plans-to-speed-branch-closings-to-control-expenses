SunTrust Banks Inc. (STI) , the eighth-
largest U.S. commercial lender by deposits, is closing branches
and trimming staff as it seeks to cut costs, according to Chief
Executive Officer William Rogers.  The reductions may come at an “increased pace,” Rogers
said today at an investor conference in New York sponsored by
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. The Atlanta-based lender expects to
finish 2012 with 5 percent fewer employees from a year earlier,
Rogers said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
