Treasury 10-year notes advanced, while commodities and U.S. stocks retreated, after President  Barack Obama  held his ground about raising tax rates for the highest-income Americans. The dollar weakened.  Yields on 10-year notes slipped two basis points to 1.60 percent at 4 p.m. in  New York  while the S&P GSCI  gauge  of commodities slid 0.9 percent as cocoa and silver led declines. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index lost 0.2 percent to 1,407.05. The  Dollar Index  slipped 0.3 percent for a fifth straight decline, its longest slump in more than a year. The  Stoxx Europe 600 Index (SXXP)  of stocks closed less than 0.1 percent higher after rallying 0.4 percent earlier.  Obama said in a Bloomberg Television interview that a Republican offer on resolving the so-called fiscal cliff doesn’t go far enough and won’t raise the revenue needed to shrink the deficit by $4 trillion over the next decade. The administration’s rejection of a Republican plan that omits higher tax rates for top-earning Americans leaves the issue unresolved with about four weeks left before more than $600 billion in tax increases and spending cuts start taking effect.  “The clock is ticking,” said  Quincy Krosby , market strategist for  Newark , New Jersey-based Prudential Financial Inc., which oversees more than $1 trillion. “The focus is on what goes on in  Washington . The market will be volatile. You’ve got to be very well-hedged given that the market is so much headline-driven.”  President Obama sketched out a potential year-end deal pairing tax increases and spending cuts to avert the so-called fiscal cliff, while insisting Republicans must accept higher tax rates for top earners as a condition for negotiations.  ‘Poised to Take Off’  “We have the potential of getting a deal done,” Obama said at the White House today on Bloomberg TV in his first interview since winning re-election. “We’re going to have to see the rates on the top 2 percent go up, and we’re not going to be able to get a deal without it,” he said. “America is poised to take off” once a deal is reached, he said.  Treasury yields remained lower after Obama’s interview and bond purchases by the  Federal Reserve . The Fed bought $1.87 billion of Treasuries are part of its program to keep borrowing rates low to spur economic growth.  Economists have cut their forecasts for the yield at the end of this year to the lowest since Bloomberg began surveying for the projection, on concern U.S. politicians will struggle to avert the fiscal cliff. The 10-year rate will probably be 1.64 percent by Dec. 31, less than the 1.75 percent rate that economists saw at the start of November, according to Bloomberg surveys of the predictions.  Market Leaders  Gauges of health-care, industrial and commodity companies in the  S&P 500  advanced, while telephone, utility and energy shares led losses among the 10 main groups.
