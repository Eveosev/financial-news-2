Toll Brothers Inc. (TOL) , the largest U.S.
luxury-home builder, reported higher income than expected as it
booked a deferred tax asset and home sales and orders increased.  Net income was $411.4 million, or $2.35 a share, in the
three months ended Oct. 31, compared with $15 million, or 9
cents, a year earlier, Horsham, Pennsylvania-based Toll said
today in a statement. The results included a net benefit of
$350.7 million from adding the tax asset to its balance sheet.
Net contracts jumped 70 percent.  The U.S. housing market is recovering after a six-year
slump as low interest  rates  and rising  consumer confidence  spur
demand for new homes.  Construction spending  climbed more than
economists estimated in October as work on homes jumped to the
highest level since November 2008, the Commerce Department
reported yesterday.  “This was an exceptional earnings release, driven by
orders, which will propel the earnings next year,” Stephen East, an analyst at International Strategy & Investment Group in
Saint Charles,  Missouri , wrote in a note to clients.  The average  estimate  of 19 analysts in a Bloomberg survey
was for earnings of 24 cents a share. Excluding the one-time tax
benefit, Toll’s earnings were about 30 cents a share, according
to East, who has a hold  rating  on the stock.  Toll fell 1.8 percent to $31.86 at the close of  New York 
trading. The shares have gained 56 percent this year, compared
with a 77 percent advance for the 11-member Standard & Poor’s
1500 Homebuilding Index.  ‘Early Stages’  While orders are up, “we are disappointed in traffic,”
Chief Executive Officer Douglas Yearley Jr. said during a
conference call with analysts. “I think part of it is that the
market is still in the early stages of recovery and we are very
encouraged that, as traffic picks up, there’s a great
opportunity to increase absorption to have some real pricing
power.”  Revenue for the quarter totaled $632.8 million, up 48
percent from a year earlier, the company said. Net contracts
signed climbed to 1,098 units from 644 a year earlier. The
dollar value jumped to $684.1 million from $390 million, a 75
percent increase. The company’s backlog of properties under
contract rose 70 percent to $1.67 billion.  The average price of homes delivered in the quarter was
$582,000, up from $565,000 a year earlier.  For fiscal 2013, the company expects to deliver 3,600 to
4,400 homes at an average  price  of $595,000 to $630,000,
according to the statement.  The homebuilder’s $350.7 million tax benefit included the
reversal of deferred tax assets tied to losses during the
housing crash.  Toll Brothers is a developer and builder of single-family
homes, townhouses and high-rise communities in 20 states. More
than half of its sales are on the East Coast from  Washington  to
 Boston .  To contact the reporters on this story:
