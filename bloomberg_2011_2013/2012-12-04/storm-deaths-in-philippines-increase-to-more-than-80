Storm Bopha may head toward  China  as
the death toll from the fiercest typhoon to hit the Philippines
this year rose to more than 230 people, with at least 79 missing.  “If the storm continues on its west northwest path, it may
hit China,” Aldczar Aurelio, a state weather forecaster, said
by phone today. The storm, locally known as Pablo, will leave
the Philippines tomorrow and may strengthen as it crosses the
South China Sea before it makes landfall again, he said.  At least 143 were killed and 156 injured after a mudslide
in the mining province of Compostela Valley yesterday morning,
Army Lieutenant Colonel Lyndon Paniza said in a statement today.
This brings the death count in Davao region to 224, with 304
injured and 79 missing, Paniza said. Eleven were reported killed
elsewhere in the southern island of Mindanao, while there are
two dead in the Visayas, according to the state disaster agency.  “We want to know if there is something we could have
done,” to prevent casualties, President Benigno Aquino said in
a speech before mayors and governors in  Manila  today. Interior
and Local Government Secretary Mar Roxas is in Mindanao,
surveying the damage, he said.  Bopha weakened to 120 kilometers per hour (75 miles per
hour) in wind speed and gusts of 150 kilometers per hour as of
10 a.m. today, from maximum speed of 175 kilometers per hour and
210 kilometers per hour gusts at 4:45 a.m. when it landed on Dec.
4. Almost a year ago, Tropical Storm Washi, with winds of 55 to
65 kilometers per hour and gusts of as much as 80 kilometers per
hour, caused the most cyclone deaths since 2008.  At 11 a.m. Manila time, Bopha was located 130 kilometers
northeast of Puerto Princesa City in Palawan province and will
be out of the  Philippines  tomorrow.  Response Criticism  The Southeast Asian nation is regularly battered by
cyclones that form over the Pacific Ocean, causing devastation
that often prompts criticism of the government’s disaster-
response efforts.  Washi  killed more than 1,200 people, mostly in
Mindanao, in December 2011. In September 2009, Storm Ketsana
flooded Manila and parts of Luzon, killing more than 400 people.
Monsoon rains flooded half of the Manila region in August.  Almost 170,000 people in the storm’s path have been
evacuated, the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management
Council said in its 1 p.m. bulletin today, while about 5,000 are
stranded at sea ports across the country after shipping services
were shut down.  The cyclone may hit about 100,000 hectares of land planted
with rice in southern Philippines, Agriculture Assistant
Secretary Dante Delima said on Dec. 3 before Bopha landed.  Flight Disruptions  Cebu Air Inc. (CEB) , the nation’s biggest budget airline,
canceled 23  domestic flights  today, according to its website.  Fatalities from Washi in 2011 surpassed the combined death
toll of 929 from the  Ketsana and Parma  storms in 2009, which
caused more than 38 billion pesos ($930 million) of damage to
homes, infrastructure and farm output. Typhoon Fengshen killed
about 1,300 people in June 2008 and caused about 7 billion pesos
of damage to crops and irrigation. The death toll from Fengshen
included more than 900 people aboard a ship that capsized.  Total damage caused by typhoons and other natural disasters
in 2011 reached 59.2 billion pesos, Economic Planning Secretary
Arsenio Balisacan said in August. That month,  inflation 
accelerated to 3.8 percent, the fastest pace in seven months, on
supply disruptions that followed flooding caused by torrential
rains.  Inflation slowed to a five-month low 2.8 percent last month,
the National Statistics Office said today. That’s less than the
3 percent median estimate of 17 economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
