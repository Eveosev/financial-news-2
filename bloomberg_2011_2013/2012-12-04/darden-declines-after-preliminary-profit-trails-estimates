Darden Restaurants Inc. (DRI) , owner of the
Red Lobster and Olive Garden chains, fell the most in almost a
year in  New York  after reporting preliminary fiscal second-
quarter profit that trailed analysts’ estimates.  The shares slid 9 percent to $47.72 at 10:18 a.m. after
earlier dropping as much as 10 percent for the biggest intraday
decline since Dec. 6. The  Orlando , Florida-based company’s stock
had gained 15 percent this year through yesterday.  Per-share profit in the three months ended Nov. 25 was
about 25 cents to 26 cents, the company said today in a
preliminary earnings statement. Excluding certain items,
earnings were about 31 cents to 32 cents a share. The average of
30 analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg was 46 cents.  Chief Executive Officer Clarence Otis said the company’s
promotions didn’t resonate with consumers and were affected by
rivals’ offers. The company is reworking its promotions at Red
Lobster,  Olive Garden  and LongHorn Steakhouse for the remainder
of the year, he said.  Hurricane Sandy , which caused restaurants to close, hurt
earnings in the quarter by about 1 cent a share, the company
said in the statement. Acquisition and closing costs for Yard
House USA Inc., which Darden  bought  in August, reduced profit by
about 5 cents a share.  Darden said it plans to release final second-quarter
results on Dec. 20.  To contact the reporter on this story:
