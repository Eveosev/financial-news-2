Ghana’s National Communications
Authority ordered  MTN Group Ltd. (MTN) ’s unit in the West African
nation to stop adding new users because quality on its network
“continues to deteriorate.”  “NCA has engaged Scancom Ltd., on several occasions, on
the issues of quality of service degradation,” the Accra-based
agency said in a statement on its website, referring to the
company’s Ghanaian unit. “In spite of these engagements,
network performance on MTN continues to deteriorate.”  MTN, which said it reached 11 million subscribers in the
country of 25 million people in September, is Ghana’s biggest
mobile-phone network operator. The stock pared gains to trade
0.3 percent higher at 166.32 rand by 12:02 p.m. in Johannesburg
after rising as much as 1.7 percent.  Georgina Asare Fiagbenu, spokeswoman for MTN in Ghana, said
in a mobile-phone text message that she was in a meeting and
another official would comment later.  The directive from the Ghanaian agency takes immediate
effect, according to the statement.  Vodafone Group Plc (VOD) ,  Bharti
Airtel Ltd. (BHARTI)  and  Millicom International Cellular SA (MIICF)  also operate
in Ghana, which has West Africa’s second-biggest economy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
