Gold futures slumped to a four-week
low, closing under $1,700 an ounce, as a stalemate in U.S.
budget talks drove commodities down. Silver, platinum and
palladium also dropped.  Twenty-one of 24  raw materials  in the Standard & Poor’s
GSCI Spot Index fell. Democrats and Republicans have four weeks
left before more than $600 billion in tax increases and federal
spending cuts are triggered. Gold slid about $12 an ounce in
about a minute during Asian trading, data compiled by Bloomberg
show.  “Gold is being sold along with just about everything else
in commodities with the worries on the fiscal cliff,”  Bart Melek , the Toronto-based head of commodity strategy at TD
Securities, said in a telephone interview. The metal “is
usually said to be a safe haven, but the threat to economies
globally from the fiscal cliff is having knock-on effects.”  On the Comex in  New York , gold futures for February
delivery dropped 1.5 percent to settle at $1,695.80 at 1:37 p.m.
Earlier, the price touched $1,692.60, the lowest for a most-
active contract since Nov. 6.  If the so-called fiscal cliff isn’t averted, the U.S. may
face a recession, according to the  Congressional Budget Office .  The slump in  Asia  amid low volume probably was spurred by
“frustration” that prices remain below $1,750, UBS AG said in
a report.  Silver futures for March delivery fell 2.8 percent to
$32.808 an ounce on the Comex.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , platinum futures for
January delivery declined 1.9 percent to $1,582.90 an ounce, the
biggest drop since Oct. 23.  Palladium futures for March delivery fell 1.2 percent to
$682.70 an ounce.  To contact the reporters on this story:
