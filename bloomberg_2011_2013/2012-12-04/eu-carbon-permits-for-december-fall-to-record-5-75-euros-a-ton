European Union carbon permits for
December fell to a record on speculation that a plan to remove
supply may not win support.  The benchmark futures contract dropped 3.9 percent to close
at 5.72 euros ($7.49) a metric ton, the lowest since it started
trading in April 2005 on  London ’s ICE Futures Europe exchange.
Certified Emission Reduction credits for December fell as much
as 11 percent to a record 57 cents in intraday trade. Emission
Reduction Units for December dropped as much as 17 percent to a
record 34 cents.  The EU commission has asked its 27 members to indicate Dec.
13 whether they support a plan to tackle a glut in the market.
The proposed measure, known as backloading because supply would
return near the end of the decade, may not win enough support
from nations and  Germany  is wavering on the matter, Barclays Plc
said yesterday in an e-mailed note.  “The carbon market is very concerned about the lack of
credible signals about demand for emissions units coming out of
the policy and regulatory institutions” for the period through
2020 and beyond, Daniel Rossetto, managing director of Climate
Mundial Ltd., a London-based consulting company that works in
carbon markets, said today in an emailed response to questions.
“That’s why EU allowances are at record lows.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
