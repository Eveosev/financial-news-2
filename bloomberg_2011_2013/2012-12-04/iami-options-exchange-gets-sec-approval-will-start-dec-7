MIAX Options Exchange plans to start
trading on Dec. 7 as the 11th U.S. equity derivatives market.  The Securities and Exchange Commission  approved  the
exchange yesterday. MIAX is owned by Miami International
Holdings Inc., based in Princeton,  New Jersey .  “The approval of the MIAX Options Exchange is a
significant milestone,” Thomas P. Gallagher, the company’s
chairman and chief executive officer, said in a  statement . “We
are excited to enter into the U.S. options space and commence
trading.”  The exchange’s trading platform was developed internally by
the company, the statement said.  The company is planning a stock exchange and a futures
market. The SEC must approve the equities venue before it can be
introduced while the Commodity Futures Trading Commission must
assess any application to start a futures exchange.  The company’s headquarters and technology development unit
are in Princeton. Additional offices will be in Miami.  To contact the reporters on this story:
