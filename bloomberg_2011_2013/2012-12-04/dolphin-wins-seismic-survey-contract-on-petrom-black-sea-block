OMV Petrom SA (SNP) , Romania’s biggest oil
company, awarded a contract of about 95 million euros ($124
million) to a unit of the Oslo-based  Dolphin Group AS (DOLP)  for
seismic surveys in the Black Sea.  Dolphin Geophysical AS will conduct the studies on an
offshore block explored by Petrom, according to a European Union
 procurement document  published today.  Austria’s  OMV AG (OMV) , the majority-owner of Petrom, said on
Feb. 22 that it discovered what may be its biggest gas find in
the Black Sea well it is exploring together with a unit of  Exxon
Mobil Corp. (XOM)   To contact the reporter on this story:
