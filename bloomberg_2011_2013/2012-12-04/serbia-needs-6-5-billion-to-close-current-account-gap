Serbia will need at least 5 billion
euros ($6.5 billion) through 2015 to help close its current-
account deficit, even as foreign direct investments and
borrowing abroad pick up, a private Belgrade institute said.  The three-year gap will amount to about 11.1 billion euros
until 2015, the Economics Institute estimated in its December
report today. Serbia will also need to repay 12.2 billion euros
in maturing debts by 2015, when liabilities will total 23.3
billion euros, compared with expected inflows of 17.6 billion
euros in foreign investments, private-sector loans and
 government borrowing , it said.  “Serbia faces a shortage of some 5.5 billion euros in the
next three years and foreign currency reserves may melt down,”
the Institute said in an e-mailed report.  Relying on foreign-exchange reserves, which stood at 10.16
billion euros at the end of October, to finance the gap would
erode reserves to cover only three months of imports, the report
said.  If the government chooses to “maintain the level of the
reserves through 2015 with minor oscillations” the adjustment
would need to come through “a sharp reduction in the foreign
 trade gap ” and “significant dinar depreciation,” according to
the report.  The economy is expected to grow 2 percent next year after a
2 percent contraction in 2012.  Prime Minister  Ivica Dacic ’s Cabinet, in office since July
27, plans inflation to remain under control and the dinar to
stay stable. It also foresees cutting the fiscal gap to 3.6
percent of economic output next year from 6.7 percent of GDP in
2012.  The  International Monetary Fund  and the Fiscal Council see
the fiscal tightening as overly ambitious.  To contact the reporter on this story:
