Cuba’s government is banning
reggaeton music from radio and T.V. as Raul Castro’s
administration cracks down on “vulgar” songs in the island
nation, government newspaper Granma  reported on its website ,  The Cultural Ministry’s music institute will levy severe
sanctions or ban musicians including reggaeton artists whose
lyrics are deemed sexually explicit or demeaning to women,
Granma said, citing the institute’s president, Orlando Vistel
Columbie.  “Neither vulgarity nor mediocrity will be able to tarnish
the richness of Cuban music,” Vistel said in an interview
posted online today by the Communist Party paper. “Obviously,
people can listen to what they want privately. But, that freedom
doesn’t include the right to reproduce and disseminate that
music.”  A blend of styles including Jamaican dance-hall, hip hop
and electronic music, reggaeton has been mainstream for almost a
decade and is popular in dance clubs from  Chile  to New York.
Cuban authorities last year denounced as obscene the reggaeton
song El Chupi Chupi by local artist Osmani Garcia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
