HM Revenue & Customs will seek
permission to appeal against a tribunal ruling that the use of
employee benefit trusts by the former Rangers Football Club was
not illegal, the U.K. tax authority said in an e-mailed
statement today.  The club, which went into liquidation this year, used the
trusts to make tax-free loans totaling 47.7 million pounds to
players and staff between 2001 and 2010 in the form of tax-free
loans. HMRC had challenged the payments, arguing they were
illegal and subject to tax.  Judges on the First Tier Tax Tribunal ruled by a two-to-one
majority last month that the payments were loans that could be
repaid and so were not liable to income tax.  To contact the reporter on this story:
