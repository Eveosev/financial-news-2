California carbon rose to the highest
level in almost two months as more companies were seen trading
allowances and on speculation that  Edison International (EIX) ’s San
Onofre nuclear power plant will remain shut next year.  Futures based on California carbon allowances for 2013, the
first year of compliance under the state’s cap-and-trade
program, jumped 8.6 percent yesterday to $13.20 a metric ton,
the most since Oct. 19, data compiled by  CME Group Inc. (CME) ’s Green
Exchange show. Prices had slipped to $12.65 a ton at 1:30 p.m.
 New York  time today, Lenny Hochschild, head of global carbon
trading for broker Evolution Markets, said.  “We’re all continuing to see additional participants in
the marketplace,” Hochschild, based in San Francisco, said by
telephone. “It’s a combination of San Onofre shut and these new
entrants in the marketplace that’s helping support prices.”  Carbon futures slid last week to a record low of $11.55 a
ton after allowances, each permitting the release of one ton of
carbon, sold in a Nov. 14 auction just above the minimum price
of $10. The carbon-trading system will eventually cover 85
percent of emissions released in  California , whose economy was
valued at $1.74 trillion last year.  The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission held a hearing Nov.
30 on the restart of Unit 2 at Edison’s San Onofre nuclear power
station. Units 2 and 3 have been shut since January after the
company discovered tube wear. Edison, which detailed repairs
during the meeting, has yet to release a schedule for the
plant’s return.  Permit Auction  The California Air Resources Board sold all 23.1 million
carbon permits offered at the Nov. 14 auction for the first
compliance period of the program starting next year. The permits
were expected to clear between $12 and $15 a ton, according to
Bloomberg New Energy Finance.  The agency  said yesterday  that it will sell at least 56.8
million allowances for the first phase of the program next year
and 38.2 million permits for compliance in 2016. The lowest
allowable price during next year’s sales will be $10.71 a ton.  The board is scheduled to hold four auctions on Feb. 19,
May 16, Aug. 16 and Nov. 19.  To contact the reporter on this story:
