U.S. Representative Maxine Waters of
California has been selected by House Democrats to take over as
the party’s top member on the Financial Services Committee.  The selection of Waters, 74, as ranking member was
announced today in a statement by Minority Leader  Nancy Pelosi ,
also a California Democrat. Waters will replace Representative
Barney Frank of Massachusetts, who is retiring from Congress.  “I look forward to working with my colleagues to protect,
defend and implement the important provisions of Dodd-Frank,
which will continue to strengthen our financial system,” Waters
said in a statement. “I understand that regulatory certainty is
an important aspect of growing our economy, and remain committed
to ensuring clear and transparent regulation which creates the
space for innovation, safety and soundness.”  Representative  Jeb Hensarling  of Texas was selected last
week by House Republicans to serve as chairman of the Financial
Services Committee. He will replace Representative  Spencer Bachus  of Alabama, who is precluded by  term limits  from
continuing as chairman.  Both Hensarling and Waters ran unopposed for their
committee positions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
