Northern Illinois University  is
giving free Orange Bowl tickets to students who make the trip to
Miami for the Jan. 1 game against  Florida  State.  Northern  Illinois  (12-1) will be the first school from the
Mid-American Conference to play in one of college football’s
Bowl Championship Series games. The Huskies averaged 15,760 fans
for their six home games this season in DeKalb, Illinois, and
receive an allotment of 17,500 tickets for the bowl game, with
prices ranging from $75 to $225.  The Seminoles (11-2) had an average home attendance of
75,601 for their seven home games in Tallahassee, Florida.  Northern Illinois, with an enrollment of 22,000, is
allowing students to reserve one free Orange Bowl ticket each,
to be picked up in Miami on game day. The school is also
offering fan and student bus packages for the 1,400-mile trip
from its campus in DeKalb, about 65 miles west of  Chicago .  “I am confident our fans and alumni will respond with a
great presence in Miami for this game,” Northern Illinois
Athletic Director Jeff Compher said in a statement.  The Huskies are playing in a bowl game for the fifth
straight season and have offered free tickets to students for
each one, the Chicago Tribune said, quoting Donna Turner, the
school’s sports information director.  Sun Life Stadium in Miami has a capacity of 75,000 and the
attendance for last season’s Orange Bowl, when West Virginia
routed Clemson 70-33, was 67,563.  Step Up  Appearing in a BCS bowl game is a significant step up for
Northern Illinois, which last year played Arkansas State in the
GoDaddy.com Bowl in Mobile,  Alabama , before a crowd of 38,734.  The financial rewards for the MAC and all its members are
bigger, too. The BCS pays $28.2 million to be divided among the
MAC and four other conferences without automatic berths --
Conference USA, Mountain West, Sun Belt and Western Athletic.
This year’s GoDaddy.com Bowl pays $750,000 to each participating
school’s conference.  The Huskies (12-1) are the first team from a conference
without an automatic qualifier berth to get in a BCS bowl game
and not be undefeated. Northern Illinois is a 14-point underdog
against Florida State, according to Las Vegas oddsmakers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
