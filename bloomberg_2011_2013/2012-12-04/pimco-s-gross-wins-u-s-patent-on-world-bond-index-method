Bill Gross , who runs the world’s
largest mutual fund at Pacific Investment Management Co.,
received a U.S. patent for the methodology behind a global bond
index that weighs countries by the size of their economy rather
than their indebtedness.  The patent for the construction of the  Global Advantage
Bond Index  was granted last month to Pimco founder and co-chief
investment officer Gross, along with Ramin Toloui, global co-
head of emerging markets portfolio management, said Mark Porterfield, a Pimco spokesman. By focusing on gross domestic
product, the index avoids concentrating on countries saddled
with debt and offers a greater weighting for developing markets.  Pimco, which is based in Newport Beach,  California , and has
$1.92 trillion in assets under management, has said it will
pursue strategies with a global focus to navigate a changed
economic environment after the 2007 to 2009 financial crisis.
The firm, a unit of German insurer  Allianz SE (ALV) , has popularized
the term “new normal” to describe an era of lower returns,
heightened government regulation, diminishing U.S. clout in the
world economy and a bigger role for developing nations.  The Global Advantage Bond Index is used as a benchmark by
the $5.24 billion  Pimco Global Advantage Strategy Bond Fund (PSAIX) ,
which returned 7.2 percent this year, trailing 58 percent of
peers, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The index was developed in 2009, according to Pimco’s
website. The patent for its methodology was granted by the U.S.
Patent and Trademark Office.  To contact the reporter on this story:
