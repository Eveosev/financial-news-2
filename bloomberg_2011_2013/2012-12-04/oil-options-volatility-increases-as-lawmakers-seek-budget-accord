Crude oil options volatility rose as
the underlying futures declined while U.S. leaders remained at
odds in negotiations to avert the so-called fiscal cliff.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
January, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a
gauge of options prices, was 27.23 percent on the  New York 
Mercantile Exchange as of 3:50 p.m., an increase from 26.73
percent yesterday.  January-delivery crude oil fell 59 cents, or 0.7 percent,
to settle at $88.50 on the Nymex, the first drop in four days.  “Concern about the fiscal cliff is impacting the market,”
said Amrita Sen, chief oil market strategist at Energy Aspects
Ltd., a research consulting company in  London .        President
 Barack Obama , a Democrat, yesterday rejected Republican House
Speaker  John Boehner ’s counterproposal to avoid the $607 billion
in tax increases and spending cuts set to take effect in
January.  Boehner proposed $2.2 trillion in spending cuts and new
revenue without raising taxes. Obama said in a Bloomberg
Television interview today that the stalemate will continue as
long as Republicans refuse to raise tax rates on the top 2
percent of earners.  The most active options in electronic trading today were
January $85 puts, which advanced 9 cents to 54 cents a barrel on
volume of 2,221 lots at 3:49 p.m. January $80 puts were the
