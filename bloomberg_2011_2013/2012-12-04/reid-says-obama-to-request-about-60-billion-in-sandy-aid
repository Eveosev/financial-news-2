President Barack Obama will request
about $60 billion for cleanup efforts related to superstorm
Sandy, the Senate’s top Democrat said.  The request for $60 billion “give or take a few bucks,”
may come as soon as tomorrow, Majority Leader  Harry Reid  said in
an interview today. Reid said he didn’t believe the aid needed
to be financed with savings elsewhere in the government’s
budget.  The request will come at a politically awkward time for
lawmakers because they are struggling to reach a budget-cutting
agreement to stave off more than $600 billion in tax increases
and spending cuts set to begin next month.  It also raises the prospect of a replay of a budget battle
last year in which House Republicans threatened a government
shutdown because legislation including aid to victims of
Hurricane Irene and other natural disasters was not offset.  A spokesman for House Speaker  John Boehner  declined to say
whether he believes the funding will have to be offset.  “We are awaiting the request from the Obama administration
and will evaluate it once it is received,” said Boehner
spokesman  Kevin Smith .  New York Governor Andrew Cuomo as well as his counterparts
in New Jersey and Connecticut,  Chris Christie  and Dannel Malloy,
have been pushing lawmakers for almost $83 billion in aid.  To contact the reporters on this
