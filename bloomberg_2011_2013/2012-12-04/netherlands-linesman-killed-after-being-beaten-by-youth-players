Richard Nieuwenhuizen, a Dutch
linesman who had been assisting in his son’s soccer match, died
yesterday after being beaten and kicked by youth players.  “You can’t believe this could happen, that kids of 15 or
16 like are playing football, you come to watch and see
something like that,” Marcel Oost, chairman of Buitenboys from
Almere, 13 miles (21 kilometers) north of Amsterdam, told
national broadcaster NOS yesterday.  Nieuwenhuizen was a member of the club. The incident
happened Dec. 2 when the Buitenboys B1 team played against a
team from Amsterdam, Nieuw-Sloten. The police arrested three
Nieuw-Sloten players, according to a statement from the police
yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
