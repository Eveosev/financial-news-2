The Chinese government was too slow
to introduce a plan that seeks to regulate natural gas
consumption, according to a  commentary  published in China
National Petroleum Corp.’s online newsletter.  The rules that started Dec. 1 should have been implemented
at the start of 2011, Liu Yijun, a professor at the China
University of Petroleum’s  Beijing campus , said on the front page
of the newsletter today. The nation faces an oversupply of the
cleaner-burning fuel even amid efforts to boost consumption to
cut pollution, Liu said.  Under the new  gas policy , the National Development and
Reform Commission identifies groups of users that should be
banned or restricted from burning the fuel, and others that
should be given priority. The rules were introduced after a
once-a-decade power shift that saw Xi Jinping and Vice Premier
 Li Keqiang  take the top two positions in the Communist Party.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
