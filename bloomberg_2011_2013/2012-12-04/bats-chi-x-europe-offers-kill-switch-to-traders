Bats Chi-X  Europe , the largest pan-
European trading system, gave all customers access to a so-
called kill switch to cancel transactions in the event of a
market crash or software malfunction.  The product, previously available only to the biggest
clients providing a brokerage service, allows traders to set
parameters for orders and gives the option to cancel all open
bids, the company said in an e-mailed statement today.  Regulators are under pressure to prevent computers and
software breakdowns from harming markets after  Knight Capital
Group Inc. (KCG)  was forced to the brink of bankruptcy and initial
public offerings by Facebook Inc. and Bats Global Markets Inc.
were mishandled in the U.S. Automated switches that would turn
off trading at securities firms when their volume surpassed
preset maximums were among proposals the Securities and Exchange
Commission heard in  Washington  in  September .  This expands “our suite of the risk-management tools
recently made available to Bats’ customers in the U.S. to all of
our trading participants in Europe,” Mark Hemsley, chief
executive officer of Bats Chi-X Europe, said in the statement.
“The ability to manage effectively risk at multiple layers of
the trading cycle has become increasingly essential, with pre-
trade risk checks at the exchange level as well as the
participant level.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
