The U.S. obtained a record $5 billion
from cases involving fraud against the government in the fiscal
year ending Sept. 30, an increase of almost $2 billion from the
previous year, the Justice Department announced.  The recoveries under the  False Claims Act  included $3
billion in fraud from federal health-care programs, Acting
Associate Attorney General  Tony West  said today at a briefing in
Washington. That also marks a record for a single year.  “The department’s False Claims Act work not only protects
the Treasury, but also reflects a deep commitment to protecting
the health and safety of all Americans and bringing about
meaningful change to eliminate cheating from business
practices,” Stuart Delery, the principal deputy assistant
attorney general, told reporters at the briefing.  The total for fiscal 2012 includes the recovery of $1.4
billion in housing and mortgage related cases, West said. The
Justice Department has recovered $13.3 billion under the False
Claims Act since January 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
