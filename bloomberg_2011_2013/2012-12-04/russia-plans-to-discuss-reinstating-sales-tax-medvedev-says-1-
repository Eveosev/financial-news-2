Russia’s government will discuss
reinstating the  sales tax , a levy that may replace the value-
added tax, Prime Minister  Dmitry Medvedev  said.  “The  Finance Ministry  always had serious arguments, but it
seems to me the time has come to discuss the issue again,”
Medvedev said today at a meeting outside Moscow with the Russian
Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, the nation’s big-
business lobby, according to a  transcript  published on the
government’s website. The government doesn’t want to raise the
tax burden on the economy, according to Medvedev.  Russia, which stopped collecting the sales tax in 2004,
discussed restoring the levy a year ago as part of an initiative
led by then-President Medvedev to give more authority to
regional governments. Every percentage point of VAT is
equivalent to five percentage points of the sales tax in terms
of budget revenue, Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said in a
February interview with the Vedomosti newspaper.  Replacing the VAT would require the introduction of a 90
percent sales tax, Siluanov told Vedomosti. The Cabinet plans to
discuss tax policy at a meeting on Dec. 26, Interfax reported,
citing Deputy Finance Minister  Sergei Shatalov .  To contact the reporter on this story:
