Liberty Media Corp. (LMCA) , the owner of
cable network Starz LLC, fell the most since May after Netflix
Inc. signed a multiyear agreement with  Walt Disney Co. (DIS)   Netflix last year failed to agree to a new contract with
Starz, causing the online movie rental company to lose films
from Sony Pictures and Disney. Today’s Disney contract
alleviates the loss of Starz content for Netflix and gives the
Los Gatos, California-based company exclusive access to first-
run TV rights to animated and live-action films in 2016,
potentially diminishing Starz’s value to consumers, Vijay Jayant, an analyst at New York-based ISI Group, said in an e-
mail.  “It reads like the replacement of the Starz contract,”
Jayant said. “Let’s see what it does to Starz subscriptions in
2016.”  Disney’s deal with Netflix for first-run content emphasizes
the importance to Starz of developing “robust original
content” to replace the lost films,  Anthony DiClemente , an
analyst at Barclays Plc in New York, said in a note to clients.  Starz will have exclusive access to all Disney movies and
their digital streaming rights into early 2017, the company said
in an e-mailed statement. Starz said its decision not to renew
with Disney allows the channel to focus on “exclusive, premium-
quality original series” to compete with Time Warner Inc.’s HBO
and  CBS Corp. (CBS) ’s Showtime.  Liberty Media tumbled 4.9 percent to $105.56 at the close,
the steepest one-day drop since May 17. Netflix rose 14 percent
to $86.65, its largest one-day gain since Jan. 26.  To contact the reporter on this story:
