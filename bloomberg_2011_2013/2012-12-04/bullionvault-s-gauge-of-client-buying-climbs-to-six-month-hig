BullionVault , an online service for
investors to buy and sell physical gold and silver, said its
Gold Investor Index climbed to a six-month high in November.  The gauge rose to 56.5 from 56 in October, climbing for a
fourth consecutive month, the London-based company said today in
an e-mailed report. A reading above 50 means more buyers than
sellers. Gold fell 0.3 percent last month and traded at
$1,706.32 an ounce by 8:01 in  London , up 9.1 percent this year.  The metal is headed for a 12th consecutive annual gain, the
longest rally in at least nine decades, as central banks from
 Europe  to China pledged more steps to spur economic growth.
Investors boosted holdings in gold-backed exchange-traded
products to a record 2,623.4 metric tons yesterday, equal to
almost a year of mine production, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg and Barclays Plc.  “The background noise of unpayable debts and zero  interest
rates  has only grown louder,” Adrian Ash, head of research at
BullionVault, said in the report. “People buying physical gold
with a chunk of their savings clearly think the financial risks
of 2013 need insuring against.”  BullionVault’s customers own more than 1 million ounces of
gold, it said. The metal is stored in vaults in London, Zurich
and  New York , according to its website.  To contact the reporter for this story:
