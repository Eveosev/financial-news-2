Standard Chartered Plc (STAN)  named Rajat Sapra as its Dubai-based head of capital markets for the Middle

business for Qatar and will report to Carsten Stoehr, global
head of capital markets, spokesman Shaun Gamble said in an e-
mail. Perry departed the bank after being appointed MENA head in
September.  Separately, Chris Sutcliffe will start as head of MENA loan
syndications next year, moving to Dubai from London where he is
regional head of loan distribution, Gamble said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
