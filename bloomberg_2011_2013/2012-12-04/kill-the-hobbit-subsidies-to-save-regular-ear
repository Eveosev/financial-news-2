The much-anticipated first film of
“The Hobbit” trilogy has its U.S. premiere on Dec. 14. If the
series matches the performance of “The Lord of the Rings”
trilogy, it will gross about $3 billion.  So how much taxpayer money, would you guess, did  Warner
Bros . Entertainment Inc. need to produce the films based on the
J.R.R. Tolkien book? The answer is zero. The studios are
investment companies, and the films are almost certain to be
immensely profitable.  But now you aren’t thinking like a studio. The real
question is: How much taxpayer money can Warner Bros. demand
from the government of  New Zealand  to keep production there
(rather than, say, in  Australia  or the  Czech Republic )? That
answer turns out to be about  $120 million , plus the revision of
New Zealand’s labor laws to forbid  collective bargaining  among
film-production contractors, plus the passage of  three-strikes 
Internet-disconnection laws for online copyright infringement,
plus enthusiastic and, it turns out, illegal cooperation in the
shutdown of the pirate-friendly digital storage site  Megaupload 
and the arrest of its owner, Kim Dotcom.  For keeping Warner Bros. happy, Prime Minister John Key, a
former Merrill Lynch currency trader, got a replica magic Hobbit
sword from U.S. President  Barack Obama  and a chance to hang New
Zealand’s fortunes on becoming the tourist destination for
Middle Earth enthusiasts. What could go wrong?  Hot Money  Let’s start with the obvious. Film money is the hottest of
hot investment money, fast in and fast out. Production is very
mobile, and studios have become adept at extracting subsidies
from governments for a few trinkets and promises of jobs.  This is true in the U.S., where state and local  subsidies 
rocketed from $2 million in 2003 to about $1.5 billion in  2012 .
Film subsidies are epidemic in  Europe , where  countries compete 
to attract and retain productions. And it has been a major part
of New Zealand’s  cultural and industrial policy , where more than
$400 million has been invested in “The Lord of the Rings,”
“Avatar” and a handful of other productions over the past
decade.  But competitive subsidies are the quintessential suckers
game, in which winning is losing.  New York  City found this out
in 2009, when it decided it had to subsidize productions to keep
them from leaving the city. When the three-year subsidy budget
was  exhausted  in one year, the city called it quits.  The U.K. government found this out in 2005, when Warner
Bros. threatened to move “ Harry Potter ” productions to the
Czech Republic. The government of  Gordon Brown  caved in to
studio demands and passed new subsidies. In 2009, New Zealand
also gave in and now faces  demands  for more.  The worst part is that, for most of the wannabe Hollywoods,
it’s bad economic policy on every level. The productions bring
in mostly low-end, temporary jobs, while the high-end jobs
remain in Hollywood or New York. Call it the Curse of Harry
Potter.  So what to do? One way to break the curse is to route
public money through what we might call an Expecto Patronum
license -- named after the powerful defensive charm in the
Potter series. Under the license, public money takes the form of
a conditional loan rather than a grant or tax break. After five
years, producers have a choice: Pay back the loan or re-release
the film under a Creative Commons attribution license, which
would allow it to be shown freely.  If a film is among the few that have longer-term commercial
value, its producers can choose the first path. If it isn’t,
they lose nothing by taking the second route. The license thus
underwrites creative risk-taking without squandering public
money on blockbusters. It also ensures that public investment
generates public culture -- not works controlled by the studios
for the next 95 years.  Trade Agreements  The license, however, doesn’t answer the question of how we
end the competitive race to the bottom. Fortunately, there are
trade agreements for this sort of collective-action problem,
such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership. The pending trade deal is
being negotiated this week in New Zealand by its government, the
U.S. and nine other Pacific Rim countries.  Unfortunately, the trade pact is widely regarded as yet
another sellout to Hollywood. A draft  chapter  on  intellectual
property  reads like a greatest hits of bad enforcement ideas,
including three-strikes Internet disconnection for repeat
infringers and content blocking by  Internet providers .  Still, the trade framework could be used for good. It could
support our increasingly rich, participatory, global audiovisual
culture, rather than curtail it. It could also look to the
Washington  Declaration  on Intellectual Property and the Public
Interest, released by the American University Washington College
of Law, for ways to balance public and private interests, rather
than to Warner Bros.  Many New Zealanders aren’t amused by Key’s sellout to
Hollywood, even if their country gets a short-term payoff.
Warner Bros. and Key  shared  a local award last year for the
Worst Transnational Corporation Operating in New Zealand. The
ceremony included a special Quisling Award for Hobbit director
 Peter Jackson , who was named “the individual who did the most
to facilitate foreign control of New Zealand.” And yet this
fealty will do them little good if Warner Bros. decides to take
the next Middle Earth epic to Bratislava, Slovakia, for an extra
10 percent tax break.  So come on, New Zealand. Roll the TPP agreement into a
wand, stick a kiwi feather in it, and cast your Expecto Patronum
spell! Help free Regular Earth from the tyranny of Middle Earth.  (Joe Karaganis is vice president of the American Assembly,
