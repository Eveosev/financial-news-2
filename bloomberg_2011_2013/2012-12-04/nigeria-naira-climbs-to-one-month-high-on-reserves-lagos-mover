Nigeria ’s naira strengthened for a
second day, headed for its strongest in a month, as the country
added to its foreign-exchange reserves, bolstering its ability
to defend the currency.  The naira gained as much as 0.2 percent to 156.80 a dollar
and traded less than 0.1 percent stronger at 157.05 as of 3:05
p.m. in Lagos, the commercial capital.  The nation’s  foreign-exchange reserves  have increased 34.9
percent this year to $44.5 billion as at Nov. 30, according to
data released today by the  Central Bank of Nigeria  in Abuja, the
capital. The bank sells dollars to lenders to help keep the
naira within a 3 percent band around 155 per dollar.  “The steady accretion in reserves raises investors’
confidence that the naira will always be supported,” Tunde
Ladipo, chief executive officer of Lagos-based Valuechain
Investment Ltd., said by phone today.  The central bank held its benchmark  interest rate  at a
record high 12 percent this year to ease inflation pressures and
stabilize the naira. Inflation, which accelerated for the first
time in four months to 11.7 percent in October, remains above
the bank’s target of less than 10 percent.  The yield on 16.39 percent naira debt due January 2022 rose
one basis point to 12.20 percent, according to yesterday’s
prices on the website of the Lagos-based Financial Markets
Dealers Association website. Borrowing costs on the nation’s
$500 million of Eurobonds due January 2021 fell seven basis
points to 4.176 percent.  Ghana ’s cedi depreciated less than 0.1 percent to 1.8914 a
dollar in Accra, the capital.  Editors: Peter Branton, Dulue Mbachu  To contact the reporter on this story:
