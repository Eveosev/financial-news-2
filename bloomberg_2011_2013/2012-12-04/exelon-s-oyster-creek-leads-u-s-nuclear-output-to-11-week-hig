Exelon Corp. (EXC)  increased production at
the Oyster Creek 1 reactor in New Jersey, leading U.S. nuclear-
power output to the highest level in almost three months.  Generation  nationwide  advanced by 1.5 percent to 86,653
megawatts, or 85 percent of capacity, the highest since Sept.
15, according to U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission data
compiled by Bloomberg. Output was  7.1 percent  lower than a year
ago with 12 of the 104 nuclear reactors offline.  Exelon’s 619-megawatt Oyster Creek 1 operated at 74 percent
of capacity today, up from  22 percent  yesterday. The unit is
increasing output after completing a refueling shutdown that
began Oct. 21, said Suzanne D’Ambrosio, a company spokeswoman
based at the plant.  Two pipe weld issues were detected and repaired while the
unit was shut, she said. Oyster Creek 1 is about 33 miles (53
kilometers) north of Atlantic City.  The 621-megawatt Nine Mile Point 1, a Constellation Energy
Group Inc. reactor, was operating at 75 percent of capacity as
of 8 a.m., Jill Lyon, a company spokesman based in Scriba, New
York, said in an e-mail. The reactor, near Oswego, ran at 37
percent earlier today. It completed a shutdown for turbine
repairs on Nov. 30.  FitzPatrick Return  Entergy Corp. (ETR)  returned its FitzPatrick 1 plant to full
power after workers replaced a transformer, up from 75 percent
yesterday. The 852-megawatt unit near Oswego shut Nov. 11 after
a transformer failure caused a fire, according to Tammy Holden,
a company spokeswoman based at the plant. The cause of the
failure is being investigated, she said.  The production increases sent Northeastern output up 3.5
percent to 24,370 megawatts, the highest level since Aug. 12.
Generation advanced to  24,717 megawatts  in the Southeast as
 Dominion Resources Inc. (D)  raised its Surry 2 reactor to 38 percent
of capacity.  Surry 2, which operated at 5 percent of power yesterday, is
a 799-megawatt plant in  Virginia .  Reactor maintenance shutdowns, usually undertaken in the
U.S. spring or fall when energy use is lowest, may increase
consumption of natural gas and coal to generate electricity. The
average refueling down time was 43 days in 2011, according to
the Nuclear Energy Institute.  To contact the reporter on this story:
