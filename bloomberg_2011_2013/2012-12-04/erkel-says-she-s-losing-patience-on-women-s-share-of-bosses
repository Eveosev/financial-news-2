German  Chancellor Angela Merkel  said
she’s losing patience with the failure of corporate boards to
increase the participation of women.  “With more women than men taking their final school exams,
more women than men successfully completing their studies,
nobody can tell me that not even roughly as many women as men
can take over management responsibility,” Merkel said today at
a conference of her Christian Democratic Union party in Hanover,
 Germany . “This can’t be explained to anybody and that’s why
companies are now under pressure to take action.”  Merkel said it’s still her belief that the government
should only regulate when companies fail to take action
themselves and she backed a flexible quota system that would
force companies to meet voluntary targets they set themselves.  Opinion in Merkel’s Cabinet is divided over ways to give
women more say on companies’ management boards. While Family
Minister Kristina Schroeder backs voluntary quotas set by
companies, Labor Minister Ursula von der Leyen supports a plan
also favored by opposition-controlled German states that would
give women statutory rights.  To contact the reporter on this story:
