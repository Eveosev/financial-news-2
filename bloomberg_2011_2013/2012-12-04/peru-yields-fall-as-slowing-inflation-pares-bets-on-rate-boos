Peru’s sol-denominated bonds rose,
pushing yields to a record low, as the slowest inflation in 20
months damped speculation the central bank will increase
borrowing costs.  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-
denominated bond due in August 2020 fell two basis points, or
0.02 percentage point, to 4 percent at 3:06 p.m. in  Lima ,
according to Deutsche Bank AG’s local unit.  Annual inflation slowed to 2.66 percent in November from
3.25 percent in the prior month, the national statistics agency
said Dec. 1. The median forecast of analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg was for a 2.8 percent pace. The central bank has an
inflation target of 2 percent plus or minus 1 percentage point.  “Inflation moving back into the central bank’s target
range has mitigated the potential risk of an increase in the
central bank’s rate,” said Diego Llona, a bond trader at Banco
Santander in Lima. “Growth has exceeded expectations for much
of this year, which fueled speculation there would be a rate
increase to slow the economy. Now that inflation is under
control, there is no need.”  The sol depreciated 0.1 percent to 2.58 per U.S. dollar at
today’s close, according to Deutsche Bank AG’s local unit.  The central bank’s board meets Dec. 6 to set its policy
rate. Policy makers will keep the benchmark at 4.25 percent for
a 19th straight month, according to all of the economists in a
Bloomberg survey.  Gross domestic product expanded at a 6.5 percent annual
pace in the third quarter, the fastest in a year, the statistics
agency said Nov. 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
