MetroPCS Communications Inc. (PCS) , which
agreed to merge with T-Mobile USA Inc. in October, fell the most
in eight weeks after Reuters reported that  Sprint Nextel Corp. (S) 
is unlikely to make a counteroffer.  MetroPCS  tumbled  7.5 percent to $9.96 at the close in New
York, for the biggest drop since Oct. 3. The Richardson, Texas-
based company’s shares had risen 24 percent this year through
Dec. 3.  Sprint making a bid for MetroPCS would complicate the
ongoing regulatory review of a separate deal with Japan’s
 Softbank Corp (9984) , according to Reuters, which cited people it
didn’t identify. MetroPCS climbed 5 percent on Nov. 30, after
Shing Yin, a Guggenheim Securities LLC analyst, said Sprint
might make a counteroffer for the company.  Yin said the fact that Sprint had extended its deadline for
a proxy statement relating to the Softbank transaction supported
his theory.  Sprint remains interested in consolidation and may revisit
a potential deal after securing approval for the Softbank
transaction, Reuters said.  Bill White , a spokesman for Overland Park, Kansas-based
Sprint, declined to comment on a potential counterbid for
MetroPCS. A MetroPCS spokesman also declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
