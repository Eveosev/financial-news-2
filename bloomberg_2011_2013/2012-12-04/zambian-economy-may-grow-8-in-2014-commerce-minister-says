Zambia’s economy may grow 8 percent
in 2014 as  Africa ’s biggest copper producer benefits from
expanding mining and agricultural production, Commerce, Trade
and Industry Minister Robert Sichinga said.  “Our target is 8 percent for 2014,” he said in an
interview at the Zambia International Investment Forum in the
southwestern city of Livingstone.  Finance Minister Alexander Chikwanda on Oct. 12 forecast
expansion of more than 7 percent next year, while the
 International Monetary Fund  said Nov. 5 it expects growth of
about 7.3 percent in 2012. The economy may grow slightly less
than 8 percent in 2013, Sichinga said in a Nov. 30 interview.  Zambia, ranked 166 out of 187 in the  United Nations Human
Development Index , is planning to boost growth to create
employment and lift its population out of poverty. The country
has a 14 percent unemployment rate, the state-owned Zambia
National Broadcasting Corp. reported July 9, citing Chikwanda.  The government plans to create 1 million jobs over the next
five years, mainly in agriculture, tourism and manufacturing.
Economic growth may be “just below” 8 percent in 2013,
Sichinga said.  “The budget for next year is talking about a slightly
lower figure,” he said. “We are hoping that we can exceed
that, that is what we are pushing for.”  The southern African nation is targeting $5 billion in
foreign direct investment pledges this year and more than that
in 2013, having secured $4.2 billion in 2011, Sichinga said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
