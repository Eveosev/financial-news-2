European Energy Exchange AG, which
merged its power business with Powernext SA of  France  in 2009,
said November derivatives trading volume in the German and
French electricity markets rose 22 percent from a year earlier.  A total of 92.9 terawatt-hours was traded and cleared in
Europeâ€™s two biggest markets last month, compared with 76.1
terawatt-hours a year earlier, the Leipzig, Germany-based bourse
said today in an e-mailed statement.  Day-ahead electricity trading, handled by joint venture
EPEX Spot SE, rose 16 percent to 27.7 terawatt-hours, EEX said.
That covers Germany,  Austria , France and Switzerland.  The German exchange was formed in 2002 by the merger of two
regional bourses. Utilities, energy companies, banks and  hedge
funds  trade electricity, natural gas, coal and carbon-emission
contracts on the platform. Powernext was formed in 2001.  To contact the reporter on this story:
