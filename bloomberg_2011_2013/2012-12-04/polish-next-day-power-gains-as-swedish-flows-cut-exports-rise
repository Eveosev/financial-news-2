cable from Sweden during most of tomorrow, while increasing
exports to the Czech Republic to as much as 620 megawatts early
tomorrow from 85 megawatts today, data from the Polish grid
manager showed.  Polish power for next year added 0.3 percent to 170.60
zloty a megawatt-hour, the highest since Nov. 9. The contract
last week fell to its lowest level since January 2011.  Day-ahead electricity on the coupled markets of the  Czech
Republic , Slovakia and Hungary jumped 8.5 percent to 53.64 euros
($70.23) a megawatt-hour in a daily auction, according to the
