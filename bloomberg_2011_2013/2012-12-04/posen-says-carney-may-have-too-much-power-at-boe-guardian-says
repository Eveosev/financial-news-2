Former Bank of England policy maker
Adam Posen said Mark Carney may have too much power after he
takes over as head of the U.K. central bank in July, the
Guardian reported, citing an interview.  “The new rules means the U.K. governor has enormous
amounts of power and discretion,” the newspaper reported Posen
as saying in the interview,  published today . “You have a guy,
irrespective of his individual traits, who has been wooed
outside the interview process, got to negotiate his own pay
packet and be told by everybody that he is wonderful. It will
take a great deal of wisdom and restraint on Carney’s part to
not let that lead to over-reach by one individual.”  “Notwithstanding that, he is obviously well qualified,
experienced, bright and hard working, sharing many of Mervyn’s
best qualities,” Posen said, according to the Guardian. “But
any individual given that much power -- what’s going to
happen?”  To contact the reporter on this story:
