Sherwin-Williams Co. (SHW) , the paint
retailer acquiring Consorcio Comex SA, sold $1 billion of bonds
to help fund the purchase.  The company issued $700 million of 1.35 percent, five-year
debentures to yield 75 basis points more than similar-maturity
Treasuries and $300 million of 4 percent, 30-year securities at
a relative yield of 125 basis points, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. The sale was marketed for $750 million earlier
today.  Proceeds will also be used to repay borrowings under its
domestic commercial paper program, which had about $95 million
outstanding yesterday, the Cleveland, Ohio-based company said
today in a regulatory filing.  The sale is Sherwin-Williams’s first since December 2009,
when it issued $500 million of 3.125 percent, five-year
debentures at a spread of 82 basis points, Bloomberg data show.
The bonds traded at 104.9 cents on the dollar to yield 0.73
percent on Nov. 27, according to Trace, the bond-price reporting
system of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.  Sherwin-Williams is adding to the company’s 3,500 North
American stores after an improving housing market led to record
 earnings  in the third quarter. Comex, which has exclusive sales
to 3,300 paint stores in  Mexico , generated 66 percent of its
$1.4 billion of revenue last year in Latin America, Sherwin-
Williams said in a Nov. 12  presentation .  The new bonds are rated A3 by Moody’s Investors Service,
the ratings company said today in a release. Citigroup Inc.,
JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Wells Fargo & Co. managed the sale,
Bloomberg data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
