OAO GMK  Norilsk Nickel  was the
biggest gainer on the Micex Index after Russian billionaire
Roman Abramovich agreed to buy a 7.3 percent stake in the miner
as its two biggest owners seek an end to a four-year feud over
control of the company.  Norilsk gained as much as 1.6 percent and closed up 1.4
percent at 4,876 rubles in Moscow. The amount of shares traded
was 490,056, equivalent to 1.6 times the three-month average.
The Micex snapped three days of gains, falling 0.7 percent.  Abramovich’s Millhouse LLC investment company will acquire
the stake in Moscow-based Norilsk as part of a settlement
between its shareholders United Co. Rusal and billionaire
 Vladimir Potanin , Hong Kong-listed Rusal said today in a
statement. The purchase price wasn’t disclosed.  “Abramovich should eventually come up as a guarantor of
general parity of shareholders rights, restoring the balance
between Interros and Deripaska,” Sberbank CIB analysts led by
 Mikhail Stiskin  said in an e-mailed note.  Potanin, whose Interros Holding Co. owns 28 percent of
Norilsk, will take over as chief executive officer of the nickel
company, which will also nominate an independent chairman, Rusal
said. Rusal, controlled by billionaire Oleg Deripaska, owns 25.1
percent of Norilsk. Potanin and Deripaska have battled publicly
and in the courts for control of Norilsk since May 2008. Rusal
rose 0.8 percent to 183.87 rubles.  To contact the reporter on this story:
