A group led by Austria’s  Erste Group
Bank AG (EBS)  won an $8.6 million contract to advise the Croatian
government’s search for an operator of the country’s new highway
system, Transport Minister Sinisa Hajdas Doncic said.  Other members of the group are Deloitte LLP and Wolf Theiss
Rechtsanwalte GmbH. The future operator will run the highway
system for 30-35 years for as much as 3 billion euros ($3.9
billion), Doncic said today at a press conference in Zagreb.  Croatia is working to improve its infrastructure, including
highways and bridges, as it prepares to join the European Union
in July. The government owes banks an estimated 3.7 billion
euros ($4.8 billion) for financing road construction in the
Balkan country.  “The criteria for selection were business references and
financial concerns” ie money they wanted,’’ Hajdas Doncic said.
“We will only sign the contract with the future operator if
their model satisfies us.”  The other seven bidders included  Macquarie Group Ltd. (MQG) ,
 Goldman Sachs International (GS) ,  BNP Paribas SA (BNP) , N M Rothschild &
Sons, as well as Zagrebacka Banka d.d., a unit of  UniCredit SpA (UCG) ,
in a joint bid with  JP Morgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  They have 15 days to
appeal the award, the minister said.  Erste’s group had the lowest bid in a range that reached 86
million kuna.  To contact the reporter on this story:
