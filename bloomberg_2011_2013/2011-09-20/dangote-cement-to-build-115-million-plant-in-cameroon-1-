Dangote Cement Plc (DANGCEM) ,  Africa ’s
biggest producer, signed an agreement to build a $115 million
plant in the West African nation of  Cameroon .  The plant in Cameroon’s northeastern port city of Douala
will have an annual capacity of 1.5 million tons, the Lagos-
based company said today in an e-mailed statement. It will
comprise a quarry and a cement-grinding unit, and will take
between 14 months and 18 months to build.  Dangote Cement is the biggest company by market value on
the Nigerian Stock Exchange with a capitalization of 1.5
trillion naira ($9.5 billion). The company said in April it
expects annual production capacity to rise to 50 million tons in
the next five years.  Funds for the Cameroon plant will be raised from external
sources, and represent part of Dangote’s $700-million long-term
investment plan for the country, according to the statement.  The stock gained for the first day since Sept. 14, rising 2
percent to 100 naira at the 2:30 p.m. close in Lagos. It has
lost 17 percent this year, compared with a 16 percent decline in
the  Nigerian Stock Exchange  All-Share Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
