Natural-gas trading volumes climbed
last year in  Europe , driven by a jump in  Germany  and the
Netherlands as consumption recovered and imports of liquefied
natural gas rose,  Prospex Research Ltd.  said.  Gas contracts bought and sold in the region, including
over-the-counter deals, exchange trades and unrecorded over-the-
counter transactions, advanced 29 percent to 28,023 terawatt-
hours, the London-based consultants said in a draft of a report
scheduled for publication tomorrow.  European trading in the fuel remains dominated by the U.K.,
where 17 times more contracts were traded than consumed. Buyers
and sellers include the utilities  Centrica Plc (CNA)  and Scottish &
Southern Energy Plc and banks such as Morgan Stanley and  Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  Europe’s biggest market for the fuel accounted
for more than three quarters of regional volume, according to
the report.  “The U.K. market rebounded from a poor performance in 2009
with a robust 20 percent increase in trading volume in 2010,
reflected in both exchange-traded and over-the-counter
volumes,” authors including Nigel Harris of  Kingston Energy
Consulting Ltd.  said in the report. “Growth at most continental
markets was much faster than this,” they said.  Churn Rates  Gas volumes bought and sold in the U.K. in 2010 amounted to
18,842 terawatt-hours, Germany rose 78 percent to 1,704
terawatt-hours, while the Netherlands, the second-biggest traded
market after the U.K., gained 59 percent to 5,410 terawatt-
hours, according to the report.  The commodity’s churn rate, or the number of times a
country’s consumption volume is traded, was 11.8 in the
Netherlands, 3.4 in  Belgium  and 1.8 in Germany, Prospex said.  European LNG imports rose 34 percent to 859 terawatt-hours
in 2010, the report said. The region’s total gas consumption was
5,776.9 terawatt-hours, Prospex said, citing BP Plc data.  Global trade in natural gas increased 10 percent last year,
BP Plc said June 8 in its annual Statistical Review of World
Energy.  Prospex Research gathers data from official statistics,
exchange volumes and estimates from brokers and trading
companies to compile the reports. The European Gas Trading 2011
report is published tomorrow.  To contact the reporters on this story:
