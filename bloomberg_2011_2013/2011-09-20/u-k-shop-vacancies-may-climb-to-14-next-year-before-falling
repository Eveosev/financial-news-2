U.K. shop vacancies may rise as
high as 14 percent next year from the current 12 percent because
of increased online retailing, competition from supermarkets and
the faltering economy, an industry lobby said.  The average store vacancy rate should fall to 11 percent by
2014 as consumer spending revives, according to a study by
Oxford Economics for the  British Council of Shopping Centres 
released today. That still exceeds the rate of about 7 percent
that prevailed from 2000 to 2007, the BCSC study showed.  The report highlights how the U.K. has too many stores in
undesirable locations. The Internet has changed consumer
spending patterns and persuaded retailers such as children’s
clothing chain  Mothercare Plc (MTC)  to reduce its network of stores.
The increased number of boarded-up shops in some non-prime
locations led Prime Minister  David Cameron  in May to order a
review to revitalize the worst affected town centers.  “To attract customers and ultimately drive sales, town
centers must be managed and marketed well to secure investments
from a range of national brands and independent businesses,”
BCSC Chief Executive Officer  Michael Green  said in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
