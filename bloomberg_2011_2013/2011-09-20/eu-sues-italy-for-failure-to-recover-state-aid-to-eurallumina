The European Commission is suing
 Italy  for failing to recover illegal state aid granted to
aluminum producer Eurallumina SpA.  The illegal aid, in the form of reductions in excise taxes
on heavy fuels, amounts to about 25 million euros ($34 million),
the commission, the European Unionâ€™s antitrust regulator in
Brussels, said today in an e-mailed statement.  Editor: Jones Hayden  To contact the reporters on this story:
