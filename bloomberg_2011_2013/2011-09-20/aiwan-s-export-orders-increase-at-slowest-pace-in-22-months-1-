Taiwan ’s export orders increased at
the slowest pace in almost two years in August, signaling a
faltering global recovery may crimp the island’s economic growth
and reduce scope for further interest-rate increases.  Orders, an indication of shipments in the next one to three
months, climbed 5.26 percent from a year earlier, after an 11.12
percent gain in July, the  Ministry of Economic Affairs  said in
Taipei today. That’s the slowest since a 4.41 percent rise in
October 2009. The median of 12 estimates in a Bloomberg News
survey was for a 6.95 percent advance.  Europe ’s sovereign-debt crisis, elevated U.S. unemployment
and monetary tightening in China have clouded the outlook for
Taiwan’s overseas sales of semiconductors and flat-panel
television displays.  Home prices , which reached a record in
Taipei earlier this year, fell for a second straight month in
August, weakening the case for higher borrowing costs.  “Uncertainty in the global economy is apparently rising,
and Taiwan doesn’t have much of an inflation problem,” Aidan Wang, a Taipei-based economist at Yuanta Securities Investment
Consulting Co., said before the report. That’s adding to the
case for the central bank to join counterparts in  South Korea 
and China in pausing monetary tightening, he said.  The Taiex stock index rose 0.2 percent today before the
release. The  Taiwan dollar  declined 0.4 percent to NT$29.888
against its U.S. counterpart at the 4 p.m. close, according to
Taipei Forex Inc.  Export-Led Economy  Overseas shipments account for about two-thirds of Taiwan’s
$355 billion economy, with  China  its largest trading partner.  The island’s government on Aug. 18 cut its growth outlook
for 2011, saying gross domestic product will climb 4.81 percent,
less than an earlier prediction of 5.01 percent. It cut its
prediction for 2011 inflation to 1.59 percent from 1.89 percent.  The central bank raised borrowing costs on June 30 by 0.125
percentage point for the fifth straight quarter, to 1.875
percent, as it tackled a surge in property costs. The average
price for existing homes in Taipei declined for the second
straight month in August from a record in June, according to
property broker Sinyi Realty Co.  The value of export orders declined to $36.71 billion last
month from $37.59 billion in July, today’s report showed.  Orders from  Japan  fell 9.52 percent in August from a year
earlier, after declining 8.74 percent in July. Demand from China
and  Hong Kong  combined increased 3.44 percent, after rising 6.51
percent in July.  Purchases from the U.S. climbed 9.05 percent, compared with
a 16.4 percent gain in July. Orders from Europe were up 8.08
percent, moderating from a 22.4 percent pace in July.  Orders for electronics fell 0.74 percent in August from a
year earlier, following a 0.73 percent increase the previous
month. Demand for information technology and communications
products climbed 9.88 percent, after rising 21.79 percent in
July.  To contact the reporter on this story:
