Sime Darby Bhd. (SIME)  rose the most in
four months in Kuala Lumpur trading, rebounding from a 13-month
low.   The stock climbed 1.2 percent to 7.79 ringgit as of 9:15
a.m. local time, set for its biggest gain since May 11, snapping
a three-day, 11.5 percent slump. The recent slide was due to
concerns Sime may have to make a general offer for Eastern and
Oriental Bhd., UOB-Kay Hian Holdings Ltd. wrote in a report
today. The probability of such an offer is unlikely, it said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
