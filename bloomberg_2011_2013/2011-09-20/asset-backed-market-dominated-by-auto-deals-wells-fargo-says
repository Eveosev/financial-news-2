The market for asset-backed
securities will likely be dominated by auto and other vehicle-
related deals as lenders use alternative funding sources for
credit-card debt, according to Wells Fargo & Co.  Sales arranged during the past three weeks will push this
year’s issuance of bonds tied to consumer and business lending
to about $80 billion, Wells Fargo analysts John McElravey and
Zachary Bolster in  Charlotte ,  North Carolina , wrote in a report
published today. Sales will reach about $105 billion for all of
2011.  The asset-backed market is shrinking as banks with access
to “substantial amounts” of deposits avoid the market, the
analysts wrote. Securities tied to auto debt account for 70
percent of deals backed by consumer and business loans this
year, compared with 29 percent in 2007, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  “Large commercial bank credit card lenders may return to
the market at some point in the future, but until then the size
of the credit card sector is likely to keep shrinking,”
McElravey and Bolster wrote.  Sales this year of debt tied to credit-card payments of $6
billion compare with issuance of $8 billion in 2010 and $47
billion in 2009, Bloomberg data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
