Mauritius’s rupee weakened for a
second day against the dollar on concern that Europe’s debt
crisis will worsen, curbing demand for riskier emerging- and
frontier-market assets.  The currency depreciated 0.9 percent to 29.05 per dollar at
2:40 p.m. in  Port Louis , the capital, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. Versus the euro, the currency of its main trading
partner, the rupee slipped 1.3 percent to 39.7779.  Standard & Poor’s yesterday cut Italy’s credit rating to A
from A+ as rising borrowing costs would make it difficult to
reduce Europe’s second-biggest debt load.  Greece  will hold a
call tonight with its main creditors after “substantive”
discussions about securing a sixth installment of aid, the
Athens-based  finance ministry  said.  “Sentiment is worsening, mainly driven by persisting
European Union woes and the inability of the leaders to solve
them,” analysts at Mauritius Commercial Bank, the country’s
largest lender by market value, wrote in a e-mailed note to
clients today. “Italy’s downgrade yesterday is another warning
signal to market participants that if actions are not taken
soon, the future of the Euro zone could be in jeopardy.”  Mauritius, an Indian Ocean island nation with a population
of 1.3 million people, earns 41 percent of its foreign currency
in euros, according to Bank of Mauritius data.  Europe  accounted
for 62 percent of tourist arrivals in the first eight months of
the year, data from the Mauritius Tourism Promotion Authority
show.  Buying prices for the dollar ranged from 27.7879 to 27.955
and the selling price increased to 29.2867 compared with 29.206
yesterday, according to  exchange rates  published today on the
Bank of Mauritius website.  Mauritius’s 38-member SEMDEX stock index lost 0.4 percent
to 1,891.74 by the 1:30 p.m. close, the lowest lowest since Nov.
12, led by  State Bank  of Mauritius Ltd., the country’s second-
largest lender by market value.  To contact the reporter on this story:
