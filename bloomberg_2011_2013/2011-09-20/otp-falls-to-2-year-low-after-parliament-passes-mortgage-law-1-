OTP Bank Nyrt.,  Hungary ’s biggest
lender, fell for a second day to a two-year low after Hungarian
lawmakers passed a bill that allows the early repayment of
foreign-currency mortgages at below-market rates.  The shares dropped 0.3 percent to 3,605 forint as of the 5
p.m. end of trade in Budapest, the lowest closing level since
July 2009. The benchmark BUX index advanced 0.2 percent. OTP has
fallen 14 percent since Hungary’s ruling Fidesz party unveiled
the mortgage proposal Sept. 9.  Parliament approved the law yesterday that allows borrowers
repayment at a fixed exchange rate of 180 forint per Swiss franc
and 250 forint per euro, provided they took out the loans at
lower exchange rates, while banks will assume the losses. The
European Union said the plan may violate its rules and Standard
and Poor’s, which rates Hungary one step above junk, said it may
hurt lending, growth and public finances.  “Hungarian assets are clearly seen suffering in the coming
period,” Andras Oszlay, an analyst at DZ Bank AG in Budapest,
wrote in a research report today. In addition to bank losses,
the plan “could have very severe macroeconomic consequences and
may yet prove to be a violation of EU laws,” he said.  OTP’s shares pared losses today after Hungary’s central
bank said it will allow domestic banks to tap the country’s
foreign-currency reserves to address an expected increase in
demand as borrowers repay loans at below-market rates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
