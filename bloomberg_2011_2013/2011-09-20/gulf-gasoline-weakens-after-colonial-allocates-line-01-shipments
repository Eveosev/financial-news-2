Gulf Coast  gasoline dropped after
Colonial Pipeline Co. allocated shipments on the largest line
linking Gulf refineries to U.S. East Coast markets.  Line 01 carries gasoline north of Collins, Mississippi.
Shipments on the line will be allocated for Cycle 54, according
to a notice to shippers yesterday. U.S. gasoline inventories
gained 1.35 million barrels last week, according to the median
of 16 analyst estimates in a Bloomberg News survey.  Conventional, 87-octane gasoline in the Gulf Coast weakened
1.6 cents to 5.35 cents a gallon versus futures traded on the
 New York Mercantile Exchange  at 4:13 p.m., according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt delivery fell 1.11 cents to
$2.6479 a gallon.  The same fuel in the Midwest, or Group 3, dropped 1.25
cents to a premium of 0.63 cent.  CVR Energy Inc. (CVI)  will shut crude unit No. 1 and a fluid
catalytic cracker during six weeks of repairs scheduled to start
early next month at its Coffeyville refinery in Kansas.  A continuous catalytic reformer, an alkylation unit, vacuum
unit No. 3 and diesel hydrotreater No. 2 will also be closed
during the work,  Steve Eames , a company spokesman, said in an e-
mail.  Apportionment means orders to ship oil through a pipeline
exceed the lineâ€™s capacity. Shippers must then cut their
nominations by a certain ratio.  To contact the reporter on this story:
