European Central Bank President
Jean-Claude Trichet said  Greece  must “strictly apply” its
program while other euro-area governments should implement
agreements reached at a July 21 summit, according to an
interview with Expansion.  “All governments must apply in their entirety the
decisions we adopted in Brussels on July 21,” he was quoted as
saying by the Spanish newspaper.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
