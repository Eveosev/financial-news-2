U.S. Gulf crude premiums gained
after U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate’s discount to Brent
oil widened.  The gap between WTI and Brent November contracts increased
29 cents to $23.62 a barrel in  New York . The spread settled
Sept. 7 at a record margin of $26.46.  When Brent increases versus WTI, it strengthens the value
of low-sulfur U.S. grades that compete with West African oil
priced against the European benchmark.  Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium to WTI rose 25 cents to
$28.25 a barrel at 3:39 p.m. in New York, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium was
unchanged at $30.25.  Among sour, or high-sulfur, grades, the premium for Mars
Blend was unchanged at $24.50 a barrel while Poseidon
strengthened 5 cents to $24.25 a barrel over WTI.  Southern Green Canyon’s premium gained 75 cents to $23.25 a
barrel and West Texas Sour’s discount was unchanged at 70 cents
below WTI. Thunder Horse’s premium was unchanged at $27.50 above
the benchmark.  The premium for Syncrude was unchanged at $12 a barrel.
Syncrude is a light, low-sulfur synthetic oil derived from the
tar sands in  Alberta .  The discount for Western Canada Select was unchanged at
$12.05 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
