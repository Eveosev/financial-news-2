Basilea Pharmaceutica (BSLN)  AG advanced
the most in more than seven years in Zurich trading after
Jefferies & Co. raised its rating on the stock, saying the Swiss
drugmaker has cash equal to more than 90 percent of the share
price.  Basilea jumped 18 percent to 37.65 Swiss francs at the
5:30 p.m. close, the biggest gain since the shares began trading
in March 2004 and giving the Basel, Switzerland-based company a
market value of 361 million francs ($406 million). That pared
the stock’s decline to 42 percent this year.  “Whilst we continue to believe a significant number of
risks remain, we acknowledge that at current levels downside is
limited,” Philippa Gardner, a London-based analyst at
Jefferies, wrote in a report to clients today. She raised her
rating on the stock to “hold” from “underperform.”  Even assuming the company’s experimental drugs are
worthless, Basilea’s cash plus the value of its marketed
products work out to 33 francs a share, she wrote.  Basilea’s BAL30072 antibiotic caused no clinically relevant
side effects in an early-stage study on healthy volunteers, the
company said in a statement yesterday. Lab experiments also
showed the product was effective against drug-resistant
bacteria, Basilea said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
