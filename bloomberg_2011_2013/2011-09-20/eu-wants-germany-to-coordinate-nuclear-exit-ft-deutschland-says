The European Commission wants
 Germany  to coordinate with other countries before more nuclear
 power plants  are cut off,  Financial Times Deutschland  reported,
citing an internal paper.  The commission sees a need for closer cooperation as
European power grids are closely connected and the closure of
plants in one country may affect the power supply in others, the
newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
