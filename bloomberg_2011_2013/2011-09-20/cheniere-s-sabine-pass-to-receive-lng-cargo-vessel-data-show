Cheniere Energy Inc. (LNG) ’s Sabine Pass
terminal in  Louisiana  is scheduled to receive a cargo of
liquefied natural gas next month, according to vessel tracking
data compiled by Bloomberg.  The tanker Seri Balqis is to arrive at the terminal on Oct.
9, the data showed. The vessel can move as much as 157,721 cubic
meters of LNG, or about 3.4 billion cubic feet of gas,
equivalent to 5.2 percent of estimated daily U.S. gas
production.  LNG is gas that’s cooled to a liquid for transport by ship
to markets not connected by pipelines. The fuel is received at
import terminals and converted back into a gas.  The Sabine Pass terminal can regasify and send out 4
billion cubic feet a day of natural gas to pipelines, making it
the biggest LNG terminal in  North America .  The following table shows LNG tankers scheduled to arrive
in North America, according to the tracking data. Vessel
capacity is converted to billion cubic feet of natural gas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
