(Corrects coupon in third paragraph of story that was
published Sept. 20.)  Colombia ’s peso bonds rose, pushing
benchmark yields down the most in two weeks, after the
government said it repurchased 6.4 trillion pesos ($3.4 billion)
of local securities.  The yield on Colombia’s 10 percent bonds due in July 2024
fell two basis points, the most since Sept. 7, to 7.35 percent
at 3:45 p.m. in  New York . A basis point equals 0.01 percentage
point. The bond’s price rose 0.183 centavo to 121.505 centavos
per peso.  Colombia bought back securities, known as TES, due April
2012, August 2012, April 2013, November 2013 and May 2014 and in
return offered 2.2 trillion pesos worth of securities due
October 2015, 2.2 trillion pesos worth of bonds due October
2018, and 2.04 trillion pesos of the new 7.5 percent securities
due August 2026.  “The government was able to repurchase a significant
amount,” said Daniel Lozano, an analyst at Serfinco SA
brokerage in Bogota. “The amount issued of the new 2026
securities is also high which bodes well for their liquidity.
All in all the results of the swap were positive.”  The peso declined 0.2 percent to 1,860 per dollar, from
1,856.50 yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
