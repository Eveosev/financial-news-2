HTC Corp. (2498)  will introduce a
smartphone called Rhyme on Sept. 29 to be sold through Verizon
Wireless for $199, said Marni Walden, chief marketing officer
for the mobile carrier.  The phone will be available globally in October, HTC said
today in a statement. With a 3.7-inch (9.4 centimeters) display,
the device has a 5-megapixel camera and allows users to download
movies and television shows for instant viewing. Accessories
include a so-called charm, a light-emitting cube attached to the
phone that glows to signal incoming calls or messages.  HTC is targeting customers who are not technology
enthusiasts with this model, said Charles Golvin, principal
analyst with  Forrester Research Inc. (FORR)   “Much of the growth of the smartphone market is coming
from this segment,” Golvin said today in a telephone interview.
The initial price is “a bit high” and Verizon may have to
offer discounts to woo buyers, he said. Verizon sells  Apple
Inc. (AAPL) ’s iPhone 4 for $199.99 with a two-year contract.  “Rhyme would sell better at lower prices like $140 or
$150,” Golvin said.  Walden, who is also a vice president at Verizon Wireless,
introduced the Rhyme phone today at an event with reporters in
New York.  HTC, based in Taoyuan, Taiwan, gained 1.9 percent to NT$762
in local trading.  Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) , which owns
Verizon Wireless with  Vodafone Group Plc (VOD) , rose 13 cents, or 0.4
percent, to $36.41 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
