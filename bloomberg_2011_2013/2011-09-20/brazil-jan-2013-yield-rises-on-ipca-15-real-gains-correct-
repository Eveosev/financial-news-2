(Corrects the last line to say that the real gained,
instead of fell)  Yields on  Brazil ’s interest-rate
futures contracts due in January 2013 rose 2 basis points, or
0.02 percentage point, to 10.66 percent at 9:06 a.m. in Sao
Paulo (8:06 a.m. New York time).  Consumer prices in Brazil measured by the so called IPCA-15
index grew 0.53 percent until August 15 from the previous month,
the government statistic agency said today. The figure topped
the 0.49 percent increase estimated in a Bloomberg survey with
41 analysts.  Brazil’s real rose 0.9 percent to 1.7825 per  U.S. dollar .  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
