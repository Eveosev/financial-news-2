Opposition parties in  Guinea ,
which is due to hold a parliamentary vote in December, may
hold “peaceful protests” if the country’s  electoral commission 
isn’t dismissed, said Mamadou Mouctar Diallo, the head of one
of the groups.  The members of 19 parties, including former prime
ministers and 2010 presidential candidates Cellou Dalein
Diallo and Sidya Toure, plan to start demonstrations on Sept.
27, Diallo, who heads the Nouvelles Forces Democratiques
party, said by phone today from Conakry, the capital.  The groups allege the government is making “one-sided”
decisions with the commission, said Diallo, who was farming
minister during a military-led transitional administration
that held power following the 2008 death of President Lansana Conte.  In August, the opposition parties said the commission had
lost credibility during the last year’s presidential election
campaign. Siaka Toumany Sangare, an army general from  Mali ,
was made interim head of the commission less than a month
before the Nov. 7 presidential runoff. That second-round vote
was delayed at least twice and took place more than four
months after the first.  Lounseny Camara, president of the electoral commission,
rejected the opposition groups’ call today. “It is not for
these parties to decide the dissolution of the electoral
commission,” he said by phone. “We will not stop the electoral
process.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
