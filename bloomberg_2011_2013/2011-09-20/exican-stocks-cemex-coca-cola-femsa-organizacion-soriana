struggle.  Coca-Cola Femsa SAB (KOFL MM),  Latin America ’s largest Coke
bottler, advanced 2.3 percent to 125.77 pesos after agreeing to
buy the bottling operations of Grupo Cimsa in a transaction

will receive 75.4 million newly issued Coca-Cola Femsa shares
valued at 118 pesos each, the companies said yesterday.  Cemex SAB (CEMEXCPO MM), the largest cement maker in the
Americas, plunged 8.7 percent to 5.57 pesos, extending its two-

this year and trade at their lowest price since March 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
