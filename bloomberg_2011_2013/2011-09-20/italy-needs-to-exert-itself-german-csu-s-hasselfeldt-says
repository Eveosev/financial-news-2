Italy  must do more to convince
financial markets of its creditworthiness after a rating
downgrade by Standard and Poor’s, said Gerda Hasselfeldt, the
floor leader for Germany’s CSU party, one of three groups in the
ruling coalition.  “It’s a sign that Italy needs to exert itself more to win
the confidence of markets,” Hasselfeldt told reporters in
Berlin today. “It is an incentive for Italy to do more.”  The CSU is the Bavarian sister party to Chancellor Angela
Merkel’s  Christian Democratic Union .  To contact the reporter on this story:
