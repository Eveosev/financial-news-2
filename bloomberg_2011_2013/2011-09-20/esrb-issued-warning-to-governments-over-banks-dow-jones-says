The European Systemic Risk Board
issued its first warning to governments several weeks ago,
urging them to prepare capital injections for some European
banks, Dow Jones Newswires reported, citing unidentified
officials.  The ESRB urged governments to prepare capital injections
for banks which failed or came close to failing the bank stress
tests earlier this year, Dow Jones said. An ESRB spokesman
declined to comment on the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
