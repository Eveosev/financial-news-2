Brazil’s state of  Minas Gerais 
plans to tax the production of  iron ore  processed in other
states, to gain an additional 400 million reais ($222 million)
of revenue, O Estado de S. Paulo reported, citing the State
Finance Secretary Leonardo Colombini.  About 80 percent of iron ore extracted in Minas Gerais is
processed outside the state, the newspaper said.  The objective of the new tax is to protect the mining
industry and boost the state’s funds, O Estado said. The bill
needs to be approved by the state’s legislators, according to O
Estado.  To contact the reporter on this story:
