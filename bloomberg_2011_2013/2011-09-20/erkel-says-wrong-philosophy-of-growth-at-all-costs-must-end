A “wrong philosophy” of economic
growth at all costs has spurred countries to take on debt and
must end if policy makers want to leave the crisis behind,
German  Chancellor Angela Merkel  said.  “If we understand the crisis properly, we have an historic
chance to anchor a new culture of sustainable financial policy
in  Europe ,” Merkel said in a speech in Berlin today. That’s why
Germany wrote debt reduction into its constitution and why “we
are talking about budget consolidation” as a crisis solution.  “I’m convinced that what we are seeing is partly the
result of a wrong philosophy over decades -- growth first,
regardless of the cost,” she said. “We can’t go on like that.
This has to end.”  Merkel’s comments on promoting sustainable growth renewed
her contention that Germany’s so-called social market economy
and debt-cutting steps are models for stemming the euro-area
turmoil that is spurring speculation  Greece  will default.  “We don’t want a debt union,” she said. “We want a
European Union of stability.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
