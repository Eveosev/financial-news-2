The following is the text of the
Electric Power Flash report from the U.S. Department of Energy:  The contiguous  United States  experienced temperatures that were
significantly above normal in July 2011. In particular,  Texas ,
 Oklahoma , and  Delaware  experienced their warmest July on record,
while almost all States east of the Pacific time zone observed
near record temperatures in July 2011. Accordingly, the total
population-weighted cooling degree days for the United States
were 28.0 percent above the July normal.  In July 2011, retail sales of electricity remained relatively
unchanged from July 2010. Over the same period, the average U.S.
retail price of electricity increased 0.7 percent. The average
U.S. retail price of electricity for the 12-month period ending
July 2011 increased 1.4 percent over the previous 12-month
period ending July 2010.  The total electric power generation in the United States
increased 1.7 percent compared to July 2010 (the change in
electric power generation does not necessarily coincide with the
change in retail sales of electricity because utility billing
cycles tend to lag electricity production in many areas). Over
the same period, coal generation decreased 1.3 percent, while
natural gas generation increased 2.2 percent. Petroleum liquids
generation showed the largest percentage change, decreasing 46.3
percent due in part to the increased cost of petroleum liquids
as a fuel used in electricity generation. Conventional
hydroelectric generation increased 30.0 percent from the
previous year, as riverflows in the Northwest showed signs of
returning to normal following an abnormally long hydroelectric
season.  Total coals stocks in the electric power sector decreased 11.0
percent from the previous month. Accordingly, the average number
of days of burn for coal plants consuming bituminous or
subbituminous coal as their primary fuel exhibited a similar
decrease from the previous month.  SOURCE: U.S. Department of Energy
