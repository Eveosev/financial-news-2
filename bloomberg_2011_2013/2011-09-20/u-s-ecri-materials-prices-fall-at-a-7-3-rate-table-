U.S. industrial prices fell 1.15
percent today, according to the ECRI materials prices daily
report. The smoothed annualized growth rate, which is designed
to minimize fluctuations, fell 7.3 percent.  The index anticipates trends in companiesâ€™ pricing power
and is thought to be a leading indicator of corporate profits
and consumer price changes.  SOURCE:  Economic Cycle Research Institute  To contact the reporter on this story:
