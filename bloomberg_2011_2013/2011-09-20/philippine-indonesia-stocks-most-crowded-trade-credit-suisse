Indonesian and Philippine stocks
are the most “crowded” trades this year on a net foreign
buying basis, Credit Suisse Group AG said.  Overseas investors have been net buyers of $1.27 billion of
Indonesian equities, and purchasers of a net $475 million of
Philippine shares, Sakthi Siva and Kin Nang Chik, analysts at
Credit Suisse, wrote in a report dated today.  Investors should be cautious on the  Philippines  because the
nation is the “most exposed” to recent gains in rice prices;
its reliance on overseas workers’ remittances means the economy
is not as domestically driven as some investors perceive;
valuations are “stretched;” and the country is associated with
downgrades to consensus earnings-per-share.  To contact the reporter on this story:
