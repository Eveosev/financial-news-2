Turkey ’s  energy regulator  will
require domestically-produced additives for biofuels from 2013,
in a decision aimed at lowering the country’s current account
deficit and encouraging production of biofuels.  At least 2 percent ethanol must be added to all gasoline
types from Jan. 1, 2013 and the minimum percentage will increase
to 3 percent in 2014, the regulator said in an e-mailed
statement today. At least 1 percent fatty acid methyl ester will
be added to diesel types from 2014, gradually rising to 3
percent in 2016, it said.  Turkey’s biodiesel production capacity is estimated at 1.5
million metric tons, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
