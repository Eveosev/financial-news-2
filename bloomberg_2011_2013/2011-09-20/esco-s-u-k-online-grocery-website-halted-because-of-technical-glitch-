Tesco Plc (TSCO) , the U.K.’s largest
retailer, said British customers are unable to order groceries
and some non-food goods online because of a “rare technical
glitch.”  Tesco.com’s grocery  website  hasn’t been working this
afternoon, spokeswoman Tanya Joseph said by phone. A notice on
the website says Tesco apologizes for the inconvenience and is
“working hard” to rectify the situation.  The retailer’s banking and clothing sites are unaffected,
Joseph said. There are no problems with any stores and online
deliveries will continue this afternoon, she said.  Tesco.com’s online grocery service has about 1.2 million
customers, the Cheshunt, England-based company said in October.  To contact the reporter on this story:
