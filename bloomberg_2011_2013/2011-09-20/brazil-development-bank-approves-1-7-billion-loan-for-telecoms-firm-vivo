Telefonica SA (TEF) ’s unit Vivo, Brazil’s
biggest mobile-phone operator by numbers of customers, will get
a 3 billion-real ($1.7 billion) loan from development bank  BNDES 
to expand its coverage and build a data processing center.  Vivo, based in  Sao Paulo , will use the financing to improve
its telecommunications network and to develop infrastructure for
new technologies between 2011 and 2013, as well as for research
and development, the state lender said in an e-mailed statement
today. The company’s new data center, to be built in the state
of Sao Paulo, will start operations in the first half of next
year, according to the statement.  The company’s shares stopped trading in Sao Paulo in June
after a merger with Telecomunicacoes de Sao Paulo SA, or Telesp,
also a unit of Madrid-based Telefonica. The shareholders of the
two companies have yet to approve the merger in meetings
scheduled for October, Telesp said in a regulatory filing on
Sept. 13. Telesp’s board approved the deal on Sept. 14.  Vivo ended the month of August with 66.2 million users,
equivalent to 30 percent of the 224 million mobile phone
subscribers in  Brazil , telecommunications agency Anatel said in
a statement yesterday.  Telesp dropped 0.4 percent to 52.19 reais in Sao Paulo
trading at 12:30 p.m. New York time, compared with a 0.7 percent
gain for the benchmark index Ibovespa.  To contact the reporter on this story:
