The  International Monetary Fund  cut
its forecast for Italian growth this year and next, saying the
government will also miss its balanced budget goal in 2013.  Italy’s economy will grow 0.6 percent in 2011 and 0.3
percent in 2012, down from 1 percent and 1.3 percent forecast
respectively in June, the Washington-based lender said in a
report today. The IMF also projected the  budget deficit  to fall
to 4 percent of gross domestic product this year and 2.4 percent
next, before reaching 1.1 percent in 2013.  The government hasn’t revised its April 11 forecasts for an
economic expansion of 1.1 percent this year and 1.3 percent in
2012. Finance Minister  Giulio Tremonti  said on Aug. 13 that he
was sticking by those figures. The government is also targeting
a balanced budget in 2013.  Weak economic growth was one reason cited by  Standard &
Poor’s  last night when it cut Italy’s credit rating to A from
A+, with negative outlook, the nation’s first downgrade in five
years. S&P also said that the “fragile” government of Prime
Minister Silvio Berlusconi and rising borrowing costs would make
it difficult to reduce Europe’s second-biggest debt burden  Austerity Package  Italy’s government approved last month 54 billion euros
($74 billion) in deficit-cutting measures that convinced the
 European Central Bank  to buy the nation’s bonds after borrowing
costs surged to euro-era records. On Sept. 14, Parliament in
Rome approved the austerity plan, the second in two months.  S&P said the raft of Italian spending cuts and tax
increases would help damp growth in an economy shackled with
“structural impediments” such as tightly regulated labor and
services markets and an “inefficient public sector.”  Italy’s public-debt burden, the second largest in the euro
region after  Greece , will balloon to 121.1 percent of GDP this
year and 121.4 percent in 2012, before falling to 118.4 percent
in 2013, the IMF said today.  “If Italy implements these measures and is able to borrow
at a relatively low rate, then we think debt in Italy is
sustainable,” IMF Chief Economist Olivier Blanchard told
reporters in  Washington  today. “But if for some reason the
markets start believing that Italy’s debt is not sustainable and
start asking for interest rates of 8, 9 or 10 percent, then it’s
clear that Italy’s debt is not sustainable.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
