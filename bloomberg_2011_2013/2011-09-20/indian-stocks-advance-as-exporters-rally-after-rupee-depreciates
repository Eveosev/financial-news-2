Indian stocks advanced, with the
benchmark index gaining the most in more than three weeks, as
software exporters rallied amid optimism a weaker rupee will
make them more competitive.  Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. (TCS) , the nation’s largest,
surged 3.9 percent. The company won a five-year multi-million
dollar contract from Deutsche Bank AG, according to an exchange
filing yesterday. Infosys Ltd., the second-biggest, climbed 3.1
percent. India’s rupee slid to a two-year low as a sovereign
credit-rating downgrade for Italy added to concerns  Europe ’s
debt crisis may slow global economic recovery.  Hindalco
Industries Ltd. (HNDL) , the aluminum producer which also controls the
Atlanta-based Novelis Inc., jumped 4.1 percent.  “While today’s gains have to do with the rupee, the TCS
order goes to show that there isn’t really much of a concern in
terms of revenue for Indian software companies,” said Vaibhav Sanghvi, director at Ambit Holdings Pvt. “The market’s near-
term direction will be determined by global factors.”  The BSE  India  Sensitive Index, or Sensex, gained 353.93, or
2.1 percent, to 17,099.28 at the 3:30 p.m. close in Mumbai, the
biggest advance in  Asia  today and the measure’s steepest climb
since Aug. 29. The S&P CNX Nifty Index on the National Stock
Exchange of India Ltd. rose 2.2 percent to 5,140.20 while its
September futures traded at 5,167. The BSE-200 Index added 1.8
percent to 2,114.42.  The Sensex has fallen 17 percent this year on concern the
central bank’s record monetary tightening may worsen the impact
of Europe’s debt crisis and slowing U.S. economic growth on
corporate profits.  The  Reserve Bank  of India raised its repurchase rate for a
12th time since March 2010 on Sept. 16, a move that contrasts
with Brazil and  Russia , which cut borrowing costs in the past
month, while  China  has paused rate increases since early July.
India’s wholesale-price inflation reached a 13-month high of
9.78 percent in August, staying above 9 percent for nine months.  ‘Loosening Policy’  India’s central bank may start loosening its monetary
policy by the middle of next year as inflation eases,  Rajeev Malik , a senior economist at CLSA Asia Pacific Markets in
Singapore, told reporters on the sidelines of an investor
conference organized by his firm in  Hong Kong . The benchmark
inflation rate may drop to about 6 percent by June, helped by a
possible decline in commodity prices, Malik said today.  Asian stocks fell, extending a two-week decline on the
region’s benchmark stock index, after  Italy ’s sovereign credit
ratings were cut, intensifying concern Europe’s debt crisis is
worsening. Greece will hold another call tonight with its main
creditors after the government said it held talks aimed at
staving off default. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index dropped 0.6
percent to 117.82.  The U.S. Federal Reserve will start a two-day policy
meeting today as economists predict data will show that housing
starts and building permits declined.  ‘Cheap Valuations’  Companies on the Sensex trade at 14.4 times estimated
profits, within 10 percent of the lowest level since April 2009,
and down from 21.5 times in March 2010. The MSCI Emerging
Markets Index is valued at 10 times.  “The markets seem well-placed for a rally as most of the
negatives are in the price and we are reaching the end of the
interest-rate cycle,” Sandip Sabharwal, head of portfolio
management services at Prabhudas Lilladher Pvt. in Mumbai., said
by phone. “Valuations are extremely cheap.”  Hindalco soared 4.1 percent to 150.05 rupees, the most in
three weeks. The stock is the worst performer on the Sensex this
year, having retreated 39 percent since Dec. 31.  Reliance Industries Ltd. (RIL) , owner of the world’s biggest
refining complex, climbed 3.7 percent to 851.80 rupees.  State
Bank of India (SBIN) , the nation’s largest lender, rose 3.9 percent to
1,990.70 rupees while  ICICI Bank Ltd. (ICICIBC) , the second-largest,
increased 2.7 percent to 882.35 rupees.  NTPC Ltd. (NATP) , the largest power producer, jumped 2 percent to
172 rupees after India’s government approved the allocation of
coal blocks for its four proposed thermal plants of 8,460
megawatt capacity.  Housing Development Finance Corp. (HDFC) , the
largest mortgage-lender, advanced 3.4 percent to 675.05 rupees.  Weak Rupee  Tata Consultancy  rallied 3.9 percent to 1,057.95 rupees,

2,436.55 rupees, while  Wipro Ltd. (WPRO) , the nation’s third-largest
software maker, gained 2.9 percent to 350.95 rupees.  India’s rupee fell to the lowest level in two years. The
rupee dropped 0.4 percent to 48 per dollar as of 4:23 p.m. in
Mumbai, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It had earlier
touched 48.25, the lowest level since Sept. 25, 2009.  “The concern is mainly from the  euro zone ,” said J. Moses Harding, an executive vice-president at IndusInd Bank Ltd. Bets
on further losses in the rupee in the forwards market are also
putting pressure on the currency to weaken, he said.  Offshore forwards indicate the rupee will trade at 48.93 in
three months, compared with expectations of 48.45 yesterday.
Forwards are agreements to buy or sell assets at a set price and
date. Non-deliverable contracts are settled in dollars.  Oil & Natural Gas Corp., the country’s largest state-owned
oil explorer, tumbled 3 percent to 261.50 rupees, the most in
three weeks. ONGC may be forced to double the amount it pays as
subsidy to support fuel sales at below-market prices, two people
with direct knowledge of the matter said.  Overseas investors bought a net 3.95 billion rupees ($82
