Croatia’s economy resumed its
expansion in the second quarter as household consumption and
exports increased.  Gross domestic product grew 0.8 percent from a year ago
after declining 0.8 percent in the previous three months, the
 statistics office  said today on its website, confirming a
preliminary estimate released on Aug. 26.  “The relatively weak and nascent recovery in growth seen
in the second quarter, is exposed to risk given this summer’s
global financial market turmoil and sharply reduced European
Union growth forecasts,”  Goran Saravanja , chief economist of
Zagrebacka Banka d.d., a unit of UniCredit SpA, said in an e-
mailed statement today.  The Adriatic Sea nation, which concluded membership talks
with the EU in June and expects to join the bloc in July 2013,
is recovering from a two-year recession. The economy shrank 1.2
percent last year and 5.8 percent in 2009 after growth averaged
4.6 percent a year between 2000 and 2007.  Household spending, the largest component of GDP, increased
0.6 percent, the office said, while  government spending  rose 1.7
percent in the period. Exports rose 1.1 percent, it said.  The government on July 27 forecast an expansion of 1.5
percent this year and 2.5 percent in 2012.  UniCredit SpA (UCG)  today cut its forecast for Croatian economic
growth, saying it will expand 0.2 percent this year, down from a
June estimate of 1.2 percent, Saravanja said in the statement.
The bank cut its forecast for 2012 to 1 percent from an earlier
estimate of 2.5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
