Europe ’s banks, struggling amid a
sovereign debt crisis, need a “major recapitalization” if the
region is to avert disaster, said  Nouriel Roubini , co-founder
and chairman of Roubini Global Economics LLC.  Stimulus is needed and there is “not enough emphasis being
given to economic growth in the euro zone,” Roubini told
reporters in Johannesburg today, saying there is no single
measure that will save the region from economic crisis. The euro
zone must lower  interest rates , he said, adding it was a “huge
mistake” to raise rates this year.  Banks in Europe may face a 400 billion-euro ($548 billion)
capital shortfall, factoring in a double-dip recession and a 21
percent impairment on Greek, Irish, Italian, Portuguese and
Spanish debt, Jon Peace, an analyst for Nomura International Plc
in London, wrote in a note to investors on Sept. 7. Concern
about countries’ ability to repay debt drove southern European
bond yields to record levels last month and funding markets have
seized up as investors speculate that sovereign debt writedowns
are inevitable.  For investors there is almost “nowhere to hide,” Roubini
said. “Safe bonds” or cash may be the best option for
investors, Roubini said, adding that no return on cash is better
than losing money.  To contact the reporters on this story:
