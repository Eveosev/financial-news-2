Credit Suisse Group AG concluded
the worldâ€™s first brokered coking coal swaps trade, London-based
Freight Investor Services Ltd. said.  The deal is the second over the counter swaps trade for the
steel-making raw ingredient, according to John Banaszkiewicz,
managing director of the freight and commodities brokerage.
Credit Suisse completed the first cleared coking  swap
transaction  for 60,000 metric tons directly, the bank said on
Aug. 29.  Credit Suisse was one of the traders that bought or sold
9,000 tons of coking coal priced at $245 per ton for the first
quarter of 2012, according to an e-mailed statement from FIS
today. The other counterparty was not named.  Swaps are contracts used to bet or hedge against the future
price of a commodity. Seaborne coking coal worth $80 billion is
sold a year, with pricing moving from annual contracts to a  spot
market , FIS said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
