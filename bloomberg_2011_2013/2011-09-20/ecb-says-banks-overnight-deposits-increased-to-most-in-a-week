Euro-area banks increased overnight
deposits at the European Central bank to the most in a week, the
ECB said.  Banks parked 144.8 billion euros ($197.4 billion) with the
Frankfurt-based central bank yesterday, the most since Sept. 12
and up from 111.5 billion euros a day earlier, the ECB said in a
statement today. Emergency overnight lending to banks eased to
1.04 billion euros from 1.2 billion euros, the ECB said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
