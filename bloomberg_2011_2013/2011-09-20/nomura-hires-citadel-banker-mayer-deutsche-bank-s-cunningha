Nomura Holdings Inc. (8604) , Japan’s
largest broker, hired former Citadel LLC leveraged-finance
banker Carl Mayer after its co-heads of leveraged finance for
the Americas departed.  Nomura also added Stephen M. Cunningham,  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) ’s
head of Latin American merger advisory and corporate finance.
The hirings were made last week and disclosed on the Financial
Industry Regulatory Authority’s website. Jonathan Hodgkinson, a
spokesman for Nomura in  New York , declined to comment.  Cunningham was at Deutsche Bank since 2006, and previously
worked in Latin America for Morgan Stanley.  Mayer, 49, head of leveraged finance at Citadel LLC’s
startup investment-banking unit, left in January as the effort
foundered. Citadel shut part of the business and agreed to sell
the remainder to Wells Fargo & Co.  Steven Seltzer, a co-head of leveraged finance for the
Americas, left Nomura in July to join  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  The
other co-head, Julie Persily, also departed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
