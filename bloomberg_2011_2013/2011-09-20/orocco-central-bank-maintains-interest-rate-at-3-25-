Morocco ’s central bank said it held
its benchmark interest rate at the lowest level in more than two
years as inflation remains “broadly moderate” and amid concern
about worsening growth prospects in developed economies.  The Rabat-based central bank, which meets every three
months to review monetary policy, left its key rate at 3.25
percent, according to a statement on its website today.  Demonstrations began in Morocco on Feb. 20 demanding more
freedom and an end to corruption, after revolts that unseated
the leaders of Tunisia and  Egypt .  In August, the annual core inflation rate was 2.2 percent,
compared with 2 percent the month before. Morocco’s economy may
expand between 4.5 percent and 5.5 percent this year if global
economy recovers, the central bank said in a statement.  Explaining its decision to maintain the rate, the bank said
that “the central inflation forecast remains consistent with
the price-stability objective and the balance of risks is tilted
to the downside.”  The central bank last changed its  interest rate  in March
2009, lowering it by quarter of a percentage point.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
