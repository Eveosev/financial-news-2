Rwanda ’s opposition FDU-Inkingi
movement accused the authorities of attempting to assassinate a
supporter and sending death threats to some of its officials
attending the trial of the group’s leader, Victoire Ingabire.  Eric Nshimiyimana, a supporter of FDU-Inkingi, was shot by
“plain-clothes military intelligence officers” last week, the
group said in an e-mailed statement yesterday from Kigali, the
capital. After being shot in the chest, Nshimiyimana’s hands
were tied behind his back and he wasn’t taken to the hospital
for at least two hours, it said.  Rwandan police spokesman Theos Badege said Nshimiyimana was
shot while trying to resist arrest on suspicion of having
weapons in his possession. He also denied any death threats have
been made against members of the FDU-Inkingi.  “Someone who feels threatened can come to the police,”
Badege said in a phone interview today. The allegations about
death threats “are not proven,” he said.  Ingabire is accused of providing financial support to the
Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda, or FDLR, an
ethnic-Hutu rebel group in the  Democratic Republic  of Congo, and
“causing state insecurity and divisionism,” according to state
prosecutors. Ingabire, who denies the charges, has been on trial
in Kigali since Sept. 5.  After the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, which left 800,000
ethnic Tutsis and moderate Hutus dead, the FDLR emerged in
eastern Congo, and has carried out several cross-border raids
into Rwanda.  To contact the reporter on this story:
