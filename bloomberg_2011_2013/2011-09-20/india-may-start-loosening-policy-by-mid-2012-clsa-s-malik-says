India’s central bank may start
loosening its monetary policies by the middle of next year as
inflation eases,  Rajeev Malik , economist at CLSA Ltd., said.  The benchmark inflation rate may drop to about 6 percent by
June, helped by a possible correction in commodity prices, Malik
told reporters on the sidelines of an investor conference
organized by his firm in Hong Kong today. Higher interest rates
and a slower global economy mean the  Reserve Bank  of India may
cut its economic growth forecast at its next policy meeting, he
said.  “We haven’t seen the impact of both the rate hikes and the
global backdrop coming through,” Malik said. “We see a higher
probability of the RBI easing before the middle of next year.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
