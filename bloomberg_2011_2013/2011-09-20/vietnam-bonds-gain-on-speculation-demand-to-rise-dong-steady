Vietnam ’s five-year bonds gained on
speculation demand for the debt will rise after the central bank
acted to boost liquidity at commercial lenders.  The  State Bank  of Vietnam lent 2 trillion dong ($96 million)
to banks today via open-market operations for a term of 14 days,
it said in an e-mailed statement. It also lent the same amount
yesterday, which was the first time since January that the
central bank extended the term at which it lends to commercial
banks to 14 days from seven days.  “Better bank liquidity coupled with interest rates easing
will make the  bond market  more active,” Luu Hai Yen, an analyst
at Thang Long Securities Joint-Stock Co. in Hanoi, wrote in a
note obtained today.  The yield on the benchmark five-year notes fell one basis
point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 12.47 percent today,
according to a daily fixing from banks compiled by Bloomberg.  The dong was unchanged at 20,817 per dollar as of 5:08 p.m.
in Hanoi, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The central
bank fixed the  reference rate  at 20,628 today, according to its
website. The currency is allowed to trade up to 1 percent on
either side of the rate.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
