New Zealand  has slashed its
forecast for spending growth by foreign tourists for the period
from 2011 through 2016 by almost a fifth, reflecting currency
gains and weakness in some major economies.  Spending is likely to rise to NZ$6.6 billion ($5.4 billion)
by 2016 from NZ$5.6 billion last year, the  Ministry of Economic
Development  said in a report on its  website  today. The 2016
projection is 19 percent less than the NZ$8.17 billion forecast
in July last year.  The New Zealand dollar’s gain of about 12 percent against
its U.S. counterpart in the past year hurts the purchasing power
of foreign visitors, while U.S., European and U.K. economic
weakness limits travel, the ministry said. British tourists are
the second-biggest spenders after Australians in an industry
that accounts for about 9 percent of gross domestic product.  Spending by U.K. tourists is forecast to be NZ$526 million
by 2016, or 43 percent less than in last year’s outlook, the
ministry said. Spending by U.S. tourists is forecast to be 45
percent less.  Both nations will be overtaken by  China  by mid-2012, the
ministry said. By 2016, spending by Chinese visitors will be 37
percent higher than forecast last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
