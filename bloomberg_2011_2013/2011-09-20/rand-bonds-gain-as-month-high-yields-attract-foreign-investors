The rand declined for a fifth day
versus the euro and bonds gained on speculation the central bank
will signal further rate cuts this week after the  International
Monetary Fund  lowered its global growth estimate.  The rand weakened as much as 0.6 percent to 10.5892 per
euro, the weakest since Aug. 9, and traded down 0.4 percent as
of 4:12 p.m. in Johannesburg. The 13.5 percent bonds due 2015
added 44 cents to 122.732 rand, driving the yield down 12 basis
points, or 0.12 percentage point, to 6.871 percent.  The IMF cut its forecast for global economic growth this
year to 4 percent and predicted “severe” repercussions if
Europe fails to contain its debt crisis or if U.S. policy makers
reach an impasse over a fiscal plan.  South Africa ’s  Reserve Bank 
announces its interest-rate decision on Sept. 22, after saying
last month it will “act appropriately” in the event of a
significant global slowdown.  “Although domestic inflation has accelerated recently, the
Monetary Policy Committee is likely to assign greater importance
to the risks emanating from the worsening situation in the U.S.
and  euro zone ,” Standard Bank Group Ltd. analysts led by
Johannesburg-based Michael Keenan wrote in a research note.
While “the risk of a rate cut is not insignificant,” Standard
expects the bank to keep rates on hold until the third quarter
of 2012, they wrote.  Forward-rate agreements for March, after the MPC’s first
rates meeting for 2012, dropped nine basis points, or 0.09
percentage points, to 5.28 percent today as investors increased
rate-cut bets.  Inflation Report  The Reserve Bank has left its repo rate at 5.5 percent, a
30-year low, since November, even as inflation accelerated to
5.3 percent in July. Prices growth quickened at a rate of 5.5
percent in August, a report tomorrow will show, according to the
median estimate of 20 economists in a Bloomberg survey.  Foreign investors were net buyers of 978 million rand ($128
million) of South African bonds yesterday, according to the JSE
Ltd., after selling 6.4 billion rand of the nation’s debt last
week on concern  Europe ’s debt crisis is causing funding problems
for the region’s lenders.  “With bond yields at these levels there is real value for
foreign investors,”  Chris Becker , an analyst at Econometrix
Treasury Management in Johannesburg, said by phone. “The rand
sell-off has been very aggressive. It looks like the tide may
start to turn slowly.”  Earlier, the rand retreated to its weakest level since July
2010 against the dollar after Standard & Poor’s cut Italy’s
credit rating, adding to concern Europe’s debt crisis will raise
borrowing costs for the region’s largest economies. The currency
pared its decline, trading 0.2 percent weaker at 7.7293 per
dollar as of 4:09 p.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
