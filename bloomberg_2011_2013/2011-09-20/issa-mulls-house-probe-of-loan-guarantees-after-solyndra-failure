Representative  Darrell Issa ,
chairman of a committee that has investigated regulations under
President  Barack Obama , said he is examining U.S. loan
guarantees and support for businesses such as Solyndra LLC, the
failed solar-panel manufacturer.  Issa said in an interview today on C-SPAN’s “Washington
Journal” that the House Oversight and Government Reform
Committee will investigate the system for aiding companies,
including Fremont, California-based Solyndra, which filed for
 bankruptcy protection  on Sept. 6, according to Frederick Hill, a
spokesman for the panel.  Hill said Issa, a California Republican and the committee’s
chairman, was concerned the government was “picking winners and
losers.”  “We’re looking at the system, the corruption that seems to
be endemic in both ideologically picking winners, but also
looking at the possibility that this is an unfixable program,”
Issa said during the interview posted on C-SPAN’s website.  The Energy Department awarded Solyndra a $535 million loan
guarantee in September 2009.  Issa’s committee plans to hold a hearing titled, “How
Obama’s Green-Energy Agenda is Killing Jobs” on Sept. 22.  To contact the reporter on this story:
