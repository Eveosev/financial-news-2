The  International Monetary Fund  cut
its U.K. economic growth forecast for this year and next and
said the government may need to consider delaying some of its
deficit-reduction measures if conditions deteriorate.  Gross domestic product will rise 1.1 percent this year and
1.6 percent in 2012, the Washington-based IMF said in its World
Economic Outlook today, cutting a previous projection for 1.5
percent and 2.3 percent respectively.  “If activity were to undershoot current expectations,
countries that face historically low yields should also consider
delaying some of their planned adjustment,” the IMF said,
citing the U.K. and Germany as examples. “Everywhere, fiscal
consolidation should be supported by structural measures to
bolster growth prospects.”  The fund also lowered its forecast for global growth and
predicted “severe” repercussions if  Europe  fails to contain
its debt crisis or if there is a deadlock among U.S. policy
makers on fiscal consolidation. IMF Managing Director  Christine Lagarde  earlier this month urged U.K. Prime Minister  David
Cameron  to be in a state of “heightened readiness” in case the
economy weakens further.  The world economy will expand 4 percent this year and next,
the IMF said, compared with June forecasts of 4.3 percent and
4.5 percent respectively. The 2011 U.S. growth projection was
cut to 1.5 percent from 2.5 percent in June.  To contact the reporter on this story:
