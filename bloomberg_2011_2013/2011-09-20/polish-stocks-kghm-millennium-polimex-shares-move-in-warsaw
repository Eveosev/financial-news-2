Poland ’s  WIG20 Index (WIG20)  rallied 21.22,
or 0.9 percent, to 2,284.94 at the close in Warsaw, rebounding
from the steepest drop in a week.  The following are among the most active stocks on the
Warsaw Stock Exchange today. Stock symbols follow company names.  Central European Distribution Corp. (CDC)   rose for the
first time in three days, increasing 1.33 zloty, or 6.3 percent,
to 22.33 zloty. The vodka producer, which owns Zubrowka and
Parliament brands, was upgraded to “buy” from “hold” at ING
Groep NV.  Bank Millennium SA (MIL PW) jumped 0.17 zloty, or 3.8
percent, to 4.7 zloty, extending yesterday’s 7.9 percent gain.
Banco Comercial Portugues SA, which is selling its majority
stake in the Polish bank, said late yesterday it’s received
three written expressions of interest and other verbal contacts.
It didn’t identify the potential bidders.  Bank Pekao SA (PEO)   jumped 6 zloty, or 4.6 percent, to
