Argentina ’s government plans to
trim its dependence on central bank reserves to pay debt next
year after tapping savings to slow a depreciation in the peso,
according to its draft 2012  budget.   The government aims to use $5.7 billion in reserves to make
debt payments in 2012, down from $7.5 billion this year,
according to a copy of the budget posted on Congress’s website.
Central bank reserves have tumbled 5.7 percent this year to
$49.2 billion while countries from Brazil to Mexico have boosted
savings.  “We foresee the continuity of the fund to reduce debt as a
way to ensure the government’s capacity to pay maturating debt
even in adverse scenarios, without the need of alternatives that
would cut the freedom of national economic policies,” the draft
bill said.  President  Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner  has said it’s
cheaper for South America’s second-biggest economy to pay debt
with reserves than return to international debt markets for the
first time in a decade. Argentine dollar bonds yield 10.9
percent, compared with yields of 4.8 percent and 4.5 percent for
Brazilian and Mexican dollar bonds, respectively, according to
JPMorgan Chase & Co.  Argentina, which hasn’t sold debt abroad since 2001, also
plans to buy back 14.3 billion pesos ($3.4 billion) of debt in
2012 using government funds, according to the draft bill.  Global Environment  The use of reserves to pay debt may undermine the central
bank’s capacity to manage the  exchange rate  if turbulence in
global markets reduces dollar inflows to the country, said
 Daniel Volberg , an economist at Morgan Stanley in  New York .  “If there’s enough income, it won’t be dangerous but it
seems that the global environment won’t be very good,” Volberg
said. “That’s why the exchange market is passing through a
difficult time and also inflation is eroding the real exchange
rate.”  The  International Monetary Fund  today cut its forecast for
global economic growth and predicted “severe” repercussions if
 Europe  fails to contains a widening debt crisis or of U.S.
policy makers reach an impasse over a fiscal plan. Global growth
will be 4 percent this year and next, the IMF said, down from
forecasts of 4.3 percent in 2011 and 4.5 percent in 2012.  Capital Flight  Argentine central bank reserves fell from a record $52.6
billion in January as the bank stepped up sales of dollars and
capital flight accelerated to as much as $3 billion per month,
according to Banco de la Ciudad de Buenos Aires. Individuals and
companies pulled $9.8 billion from the economy in the first six
months of the year compared with $11.4 billion in all of 2010,
central bank data show.  The peso has fallen 5.4 percent so far this year, the
third-biggest drop after  Brazil ’s real and the Mexican peso. The
currency rose 0.2 percent to 4.1973 per dollar at 11:07 a.m. New
York time. It will fall to an average 4.4 per dollar in 2012,
the budget proposal forecast.  Consumer prices will rise 9.7 percent by year end, half of
what private economists estimate, and 9.4 percent in 2012, the
bill says. The economy will grow 5.1 percent in 2012 while the
 trade surplus  narrows to $8.6 billion from $9 billion this year.  Next year’s primary surplus, which excludes interest
payments, will be 2.5 percent of gross domestic product while
the overall surplus will be 0.2 percent of GDP, the bill said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
