Iran  plans to gradually boost the
volume of its oil swaps with Central Asian countries, the oil
ministryâ€™s news website,  Shana  reported, citing Mohsen Qamsari,
head of international affairs at the National Iranian Oil Co.  Almost 500,000 barrels of crude oil have been received by
Iran at its northern port of Neka on the  Caspian Sea  since oil
swap operations resumed in July, Qamsari said in a report
published yesterday.  Once the volume reaches one million barrels of crude oil,
Iran will export an equivalent volume from its southern oil
terminals, he said. Iran plans to deliver the first cargo of one
million barrels of oil to buyers in the  Persian Gulf  by the end
of September, according to the report.  Under oil swap arrangements Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan, and
Kazakhstan each provide Iran with crude oil that is refined in
northern Iran. Iran then sells an equal amount of its own crude
in the Persian Gulf on the accounts of those countries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
