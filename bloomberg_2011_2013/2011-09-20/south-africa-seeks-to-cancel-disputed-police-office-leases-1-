South Africa ’s Department of Public
Works said it moved to cancel two police leases worth 1.8
billion rand ($235 million) that showed “evidence of
corruption.”  The ministry applied to the Pretoria High Court to have 10-
year lease contracts for police offices in Pretoria and Durban
to be declared “null and void,” it said in an e-mailed
statement today. A further investigation may lead to criminal
proceedings against officials found guilty of disregarding
procurement rules, it said.  “There is evidence of corruption and the flouting of
proper procedures,” Public Works Minister Gwen Mahlangu-
Nkabinde said in the statement. “The government of South Africa
will not tolerate white-collar crime and we will act forcefully
against those who act illegally.”  Mahlangu-Nkabinde has been criticized by South Africa’s
graft ombudsman for not cooperating with investigations into the
leases. Public Protector Thuli Madonsela urged the government in
a July 14 report to take action against her and Police
commissioner Bheki Cele for the “unlawful and improper
conduct” in having the leases awarded.  Mahlangu-Nkabinde never obstructed Madonsela’s
investigation, Boogie Khutsoane, an adviser to the minister,
said in a phone interview today. The leases weren’t put out for
tender, which is required for expenditure of that amount, she
said, citing an example of how procedures weren’t followed.  Mahlangu-Nkabinde yesterday said her department will bring
criminal charges against officials after it found more than 40
tenders worth 3 billion rand were allocated “improperly”.  To contact the reporter on this story:
