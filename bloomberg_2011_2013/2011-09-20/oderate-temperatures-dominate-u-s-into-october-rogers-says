The U.S. Midwest may experience
overnight cold spells this week that will send residents to
their thermostats for more heat, said  Matt Rogers , president of
Commodity Weather Group LLC.  The cold won’t last or make a large impact on overall
heating demand, according to Rogers. Moderate temperatures are
expected to prevail over most of the U.S. through the start of
October with many northern areas actually warming up as autumn
begins, he said.  “As we edge toward October, demand is optimized by having
southern heat and northern cooling, but right now, the models
are still focusing the better warming in the north instead,”
Rogers said today in a note to clients.  Natural gas traders use long-range temperature predictions
to gauge energy use and market fluctuations. Hot or cold weather
can increase demand for heating and cooling, and power plants
use about 30 percent of the nation’s gas supplies, according to
Energy Department data.  Rogers’s 6- to 10-day forecast calls for some below-normal
temperatures in the Midwest and Ohio River Valley from Sept. 25
to Sept. 29. He also predicts the northern U.S., as well as the
 Rocky Mountains  and  Texas , will be warmer than normal.  In his 11- to 15-day forecast, Rogers said most of the U.S.
will have seasonal temperatures, while the northern Great
Plains,  Great Lakes  and  New England  may be warmer than normal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
