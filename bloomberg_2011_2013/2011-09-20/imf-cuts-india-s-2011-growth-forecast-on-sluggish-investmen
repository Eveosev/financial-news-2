The  International Monetary Fund  cut
its  India  growth forecasts for this year and next because of
weak investment and a faltering global economy.  The South Asian economy will expand 7.8 percent in 2011,
the Washington-based lender said in its World Economic Outlook
today, slower than the 8.2 percent projected in June. For 2012,
it lowered its estimate to 7.5 percent from 7.8 percent.  “Investment is expected to remain sluggish, reflecting in
part recent corporate sector governance issues and a drag from
the renewed global uncertainty and less favorable external
financing environment,” the IMF said in the report.  Corporate investment in the second half of the fiscal year
ended March 31 dropped 43 percent compared with the first six
months of the year, according to India’s central bank. The IMF
reduced its forecast for global expansion and predicted “severe”
repercussions if  Europe  fails to contain its debt crisis or if
U.S. policy makers reach an impasse over a fiscal plan.  In India, “a key challenge for policy makers is to bring
down inflation, which is running close to double digits and has
become generalized,” the report said.  The  Reserve Bank  of India Sept. 16 raised its repurchase
rate for the 12th time since mid-March 2010 to 8.25 percent.
India’s inflation accelerated to a 13-month high of 9.78 percent
in August.  The IMF said that in economies like India and  Vietnam , the
real cost of capital is at “historical lows” because of
“elevated inflation” and that inflation expectations are
“inching up.”  “In these economies, the monetary tightening phase needs
to be sustained for as long as the baseline scenario prevails,”
the IMF said.  Consumer prices in India may rise 10.6 percent in 2011 and
the pace of growth may ease to 8.6 percent in 2012, according to
the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
