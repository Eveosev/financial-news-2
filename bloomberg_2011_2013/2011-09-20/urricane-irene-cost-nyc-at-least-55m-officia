Hurricane Irene  last month cost  New
York City  at least $55 million for overtime, evacuation expenses
and damage to public infrastructure, said Chris Gilbride, a
spokesman for the  Office of Emergency Management .  The preliminary estimate, with some agencies yet to report,
includes partial costs to shelter 71,000 of the 270,000
residents in low-lying areas that were ordered to evacuate
before the storm struck Aug. 27 and 28. About 9,500 people used
the centers at the storm’s peak, city officials said at the
time.  The  Stafford Act , a federal program, reimburses
municipalities for about 90 percent of damage to public
infrastructure and costs associated with response and recovery,
including overtime and emergency protective measures taken
before the storm, Gilbride said.  “It will take several more weeks to determine the full
extent of the city’s storm-related costs and which of those
costs are eligible for federal reimbursement,” Gilbride said in
an e-mail.  Irene, the first to prompt hurricane warnings in  New York 
since 1985, made landfall over Coney Island as a tropical storm
with 65 mph (104 kph) winds, according to the National Hurricane
Center.  The city sustained less damage than other areas along the
East Coast, where the storm killed at least 44 people and left
almost 6 million homes and businesses without power, according
to the U.S. Energy Department.  Private property reimbursements by insurance companies may
run as high as $2.6 billion, Kinetic Analysis Corp., a firm that
predicts the effects of disasters, said last month.  To contact the reporters on this story:
