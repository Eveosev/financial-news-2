Home sales in  California , the most
populous U.S. state, are likely to rise 1 percent in 2012 after
being “essentially flat” this year, the California Association
of Realtors forecast today.  Sales of existing homes are expected to rise to 496,200
units from a projected 491,100 in 2011 and 491,500 last year,
the Los Angeles-based group said in a statement. Median prices
probably will rise 1.7 percent to $296,000 from $291,000 this
year, according to the Realtors.  “The fundamentals of the housing market -- such as low
 mortgage rates , high housing affordability and favorable  home
prices  -- are expected to continue,” Beth L. Peerce, president
of the California association, said in the statement. “But at
this point, a strong housing recovery will depend on  consumer
confidence ,  job creation  and the availability and cost of home
loans.”  California home sales, which account for about a 10th of
the U.S. total, have fallen from 625,000 in 2005, while median
prices are down from a peak of $560,300 in 2007, according to
the group. The state ranks second nationally, after Nevada, in
the pace of foreclosure filings. One of every 226 homes received
a notice of default or was subject to a foreclosure sale in
August, RealtyTrac Inc. reported Sept. 15.  It will take as long as five years for the state’s
inventory of foreclosed properties to be absorbed, Leslie Appleton-Young, chief economist for the California Association
of Realtors, said in a conference call today.  ‘Closer to Five’  “It depends on the area,” Appleton-Young said. It will be
“closer to five in the inland areas, where I don’t think we’ve
seen a lot of the supply that’s going to come through come
through,” she said.  California’s unemployment rate was 12.1 percent in August,
also second to  Nevada  and above a U.S. rate of 9.1 percent, the
state  Employment Development Department  reported Sept. 16.  The California Realtors’ forecast for this year was lowered
from 505,000 sales projected in June and 502,000 in October.  To contact the reporter on this story:
