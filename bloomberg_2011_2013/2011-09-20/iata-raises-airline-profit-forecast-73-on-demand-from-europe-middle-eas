The  International Air Transport
Association  raised its 2011 forecast for global airline profits
by 73 percent because of stronger-than-expected demand in  Europe 
and the  Middle East .  Carriers will earn $6.9 billion of profits this year on
sales of $594 billion, a margin of 1.2 percent, the group, whose
members account for 93 percent of global passenger traffic, said
in a statement today. That compares with a June forecast for
earnings of $4 billion and last year’s profit of $16 billion.  The group raised its profit forecast for European carriers
by $900 million from June as a weak euro boosts inbound tourism
and exports. The Middle East forecast was increased by $700
million as travel withstands political instability, IATA said.
Still, it predicted global profits will decline next year as
economic growth stalls in debt-laden western nations.  “A long, slow struggle lies ahead,” Chief Executive
Officer  Tony Tyler  told reporters on a conference call from
 Singapore  today. “Margins are razor thin.”  The group expects carriers’ global profits to fall to $4.9
billion next year on sales of $632 billion.  While the 2011 forecast is an increase from June, the
expected profit is still less than IATA’s March prediction that
carriers would  earn  $8.6 billion. The group said its forecasts
are based on global gross domestic product growth of 2.5 percent
for this year and 2.4 percent for next year.  ‘Poor Returns’  “Historically when the economic growth slips below 2
percent, the  airline industry  loses money and we are just above
that threshold,” Tyler said. “Airlines put in a lot of effort
for very poor returns.”  IATA expects passenger demand to rise 5.9 percent in 2011,
revising its June prediction of 4.4 percent. Next year’s growth
is seen at 4.6 percent.  The group slashed its freight growth forecast to 1.4
percent from 5.5 percent with airlines expected to carry 46.4
million metric tons of cargo this year. Growth will accelerate
to 4.2 percent in 2012, according to IATA.  Asia-Pacific carriers will post a profit of $2.5 billion in
2011, up from a June forecast of $2.1 billion, as Japanese
passenger traffic and cargo volumes recover from the March
earthquake and tsunami, IATA said.  North American airline earnings will be $1.5 billion,
compared with $1.2 billion predicted in June. The forecast for
 Latin America  has risen six-fold to $600 million as commodity
exports to  China  and  North America  fuel economic growth.  African carriers will likely break even this year, IATA
said, revising an earlier forecast for a $100 million loss.  To contact the reporter on this story:
