China  stocks rose, with the
benchmark index climbing from a 14-month low, as investors
speculated recent declines were overdone.  PetroChina Co. rebounded from a record low and  China
Construction Bank Corp. (939)  advanced from its lowest close since
January 2009. Anhui Conch Cement Co. paced gains for building
material producers after Premier Wen Jiabao said China will
continue to promote the construction of public rental housing.  The Shanghai Composite Index, which tracks the bigger of
China’s stock exchanges, added 0.4 percent to 2,447.76 at the 3
p.m. close, rising from its lowest level since July 16, 2010.
The  CSI 300 Index (SHSZ300)  gained 0.4 percent to 2,689.84 today.  “Recent declines were excessive, given valuation levels,”
said Zhang Han, a strategist at Guotai Junan Securities Co. in
 Shanghai . “The A-share market is near its bottom for the
year.”  The Shanghai index has slumped 13 percent in 2011,
extending last year’s 14 percent plunge, as the government
increased measures to cool inflation that’s at an almost three-
year high. Stocks on the measure trade at 11.3 times estimated
profit, after falling to the lowest level on record yesterday,
according to weekly data compiled by Bloomberg and dating back
to January 2006.  Stocks have also declined on speculation  Europe ’s debt
crisis is widening. Italy’s debt rating was downgraded by
 Standard & Poor’s  on concern weakening economic growth and a
“fragile” government means the nation won’t be able to reduce
the euro-region’s second-largest debt burden. Italy follows
 Spain , Ireland, Portugal, Cyprus and  Greece  as euro-region
countries having their  credit rating  cut this year.  Record Low  PetroChina, the nation’s largest oil producer, added 0.6
percent to 9.63 yuan, after closing yesterday at its lowest
level since the stock listed in 2007. China Construction Bank,
the nation’s second-biggest lender, climbed 0.2 percent to 4.48
yuan. The stock has tumbled 15 percent since this year’s peak on
April 18.  China may increase investments as possible stimulus plans
if the economy slows “sharply,”  Michael Pettis , chief
strategist at Guosen Securities Co., said in an interview with
Bloomberg Television today.  Anhui Conch, China’s biggest cement maker, rose 1.4 percent
to 17.39 yuan, the first gain in five days. Tangshan Jidong
Cement Co. advanced 3.4 percent to 15.94 yuan, the most since
August 15.  China will continue to promote the construction of public
rental housing, Premier Wen said in a State Council meeting. The
government will let financial institutions lend to qualified
local government financing vehicles for public-rental housing
projects, according to an official statement.  Public Housing  Developers declined.  Gemdale Corp. (600383)  lost 1.6 percent to 5.56
yuan, the lowest close since May 5, 2009. China Vanke Co., the
nation’s largest developer by market value, sank 0.8 percent to
7.72 yuan. Poly Real Estate Group Co. dropped 0.9 percent to
10.18 yuan, its lowest close since June 17.  The  property market  is under “double pressure” as
developers are faced with low transactions and high inventory
levels during September and October, their traditional busiest
months for sales, Shanghai Securities News reported, citing
China Index Academy figures.  Some Chinese cities may see  home prices  decline as much as
15 percent, the  Hong Kong Economic Times  reported, citing  SRE
Group Ltd. (1207)  Chairman Shi Jian.  Chinese stocks may weaken further on the prospect of more
initial public offerings, according to Manop Sangiambut, CLSA
Asia-Pacific Markets’ head of China A-share research.  “IPOs and placements have also been a factor that has
drained liquidity from the main board,” he said in a media
briefing in  Hong Kong  yesterday. “We still believe there are
many IPOs in the pipeline so that may cause market weakness.”  Sinohydro Group Ltd. plans to start selling as many as 3.5
billion shares on Sept. 26, according to a statement. China’s
biggest builder of dams applied in July to raise funds for 17.3
billion yuan ($2.7 billion) of projects, China’s biggest IPO in
almost a year.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
