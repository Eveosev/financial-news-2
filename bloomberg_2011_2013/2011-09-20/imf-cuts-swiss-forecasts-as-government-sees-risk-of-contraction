The Swiss economy will grow at a
slower pace this year and next than previously projected, the
 International Monetary Fund  said.  Gross domestic product may rise 2.1 percent this year and
1.4 percent in 2012, the Washington-based fund said in its World
Economic Outlook published today. It previously forecast
expansion of 2.4 percent and 1.8 percent, respectively. In 2010,
GDP increased 2.7 percent.  Switzerland ’s recovery is losing momentum after the franc
surged to a record against the euro last month, hurting export
competitiveness just as global demand weakens. While the central
bank imposed a currency ceiling on Sept. 6, the government also
cut its forecasts today, saying the economy may show some
quarters of contraction.  The IMF’s projections remain more optimistic than the Swiss
government, which sees growth at 1.9 percent this year and 0.9
percent in 2012. That would be the weakest performance since the
economy shrank in 2009. The  Swiss National Bank  lowered its 2011
growth forecast on Sept. 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
