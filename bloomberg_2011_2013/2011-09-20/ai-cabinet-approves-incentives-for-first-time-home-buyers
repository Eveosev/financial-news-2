Thailand â€™s Cabinet approved a
proposal to give tax incentives to first-time home buyers, Satit
Rungkasiri, director general of the Revenue Department, said
after a weekly Cabinet meeting in Bangkok today.  Under the proposal, buyers of homes valued at less than 5
million baht would receive tax deductions of as much as 500,000
baht over five years. The tax incentive will start on Sept. 22
and last until the end of next year.  The plan may cost the government 1.7 billion baht in  tax
revenue , and boost home sales by 90,000 units, Satit said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
