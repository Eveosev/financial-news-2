Edinburgh City Council property
conservation officials are being investigated for possible fraud
and wrongdoing related to housing repairs,  British Broadcasting
Corp.  said in a television documentary to be shown later today.  The fraud unit at Lothian & Borders Police is investigating
the department, where 15 officials have been suspended over the
past year, according to the  BBC . Deloitte & Touche LLP is
carrying out an independent investigation on behalf of the
municipality, the BBC said.  Edinburgh is the only municipality in the U.K. with the
power to order repairs to private homes, the BBC said. The
council arranges contractors where the owners cannot reach
agreement. The value of repairs ordered under statutory notices
more than tripled since 2005 to more than 30 million pounds
($47.1 million) last year, the BBC said.  Hundreds of cases may be invalid, costing the council
millions of pounds, Ewan Aitken, a former leader of the council,
told the BBC.  The ongoing investigations by Deloitte and the police meant
it was inappropriate for the council to comment, Mark Turley, a
municipality executive, said in an e-mailed statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
