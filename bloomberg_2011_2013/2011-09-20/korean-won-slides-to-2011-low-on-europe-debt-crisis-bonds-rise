South Korea’s won sank to its low
for the year as a downgrade of Italy’s credit rating fanned
concern  Europe ’s debt crisis will worsen, spurring an exodus
from emerging-market assets.  Government bonds  rose.  Italy’s rating was cut one level to A by Standard & Poor’s
yesterday, joining Spain, Ireland, Portugal, Cyprus and Greece
in having been downgraded by major rating companies this year.
Greece’s Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos held
“substantive” discussions with the European Union and
 International Monetary Fund  about securing a sixth installment
of bailout funds, according to a statement yesterday.  The won fell 1 percent to 1,148.90 per dollar as of 3 p.m.
in  Seoul , after sliding 2.2 percent yesterday and 3.1 percent
last week, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It touched
1,156.50 today, the weakest level since Dec. 22.  “ Italy ’s credit rating cut raised demand for dollars in
the market,” said Yun Se Min, a currency dealer at Busan Bank
in Seoul. “Market players speculate the government intervened
to curb currency declines as the won fell below 1,150 per
dollar.”  Finance Minister Bahk Jae Wan said declines in the won will
add to inflationary pressure, adding that “verbal
intervention” used to support the currency last week was needed
to curb volatility. The  finance ministry  phoned media outlets
including Bloomberg News on Sept. 15 to signal possible
intervention, the first time it’s done so since April 2010. The
Financial Supervisory Commission said it will regularly review
whether banks are meeting foreign-currency liquidity guidance
and limits on foreign-currency forward contracts, in a report
submitted to parliament today.  The yield on  South Korea ’s benchmark three-year bonds fell
from a one-month high. The rate on the 3.5 percent debt due June
2014 slid eight basis points, or 0.08 percentage point, to 3.47
percent, Korea Exchange Inc. prices show.  Overseas investors increased holdings of South Korean bonds
by 371.7 billion won ($323.5 million) this month through Sept.
19, according to the Financial Supervisory Service. European
investors cut holdings by 953.2 billion won during the same
period. Foreign funds sold $1 billion more of the nation’s
stocks than they bought this month through yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
