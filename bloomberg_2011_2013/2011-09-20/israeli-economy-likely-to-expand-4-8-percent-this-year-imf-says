Israel ’s economy is likely to
expand 4.8 percent this year, the same as last year, the
 International Monetary Fund  said in a report today, raising its
forecast.  While the IMF prediction exceeds its April estimate of 3.8
percent, it matches the Bank of Israel’s August forecast. Growth
next year will be 3.6 percent in 2012, the IMF said, lowering it
from 3.8 percent. The central bank’s forecast for 2012 growth is
3.9 percent.  “We are doing reasonably well,” Bank of Israel Governor
 Stanley Fischer  said in a Sept. 18 Bloomberg television
interview broadcast today. “We expect growth to continue at a
reasonable rate.”  Israel recovered from the global financial crisis faster
than many of the advanced countries. The weaker outlook in the
U.S. and  Europe , the country’s main export markets, is likely to
reduce demand for Israeli products, and geopolitical tensions
have also increased concerns, Fischer said.  “We’re feeling O.K., but worried about the global
situation and our own geopolitical situation,” he said.  Palestinian Authority President  Mahmoud Abbas  has said
that later this week he will request that the UN Security
Council recognize a Palestinian state and accept it as a full
member, a measure that Israel and the U.S. oppose.  Turkey  Relations  Turkey, one of Israel’s largest regional trading partners,
expelled the Israeli ambassador and halted defense purchases
after Israel refused to apologize for a commando raid last year
on a Turkish humanitarian aid vessel attempting to breach the
blockade of the Hamas-controlled  Gaza Strip  that left nine dead.  Fischer has increased Israel’s interest rate 10 times in
the past two years in an effort to rein in inflation, which has
exceeded the government’s 1 percent-to-3 percent target range
since the beginning of the year. He kept the rate unchanged at
3.25 for a third month in August amid signs of slowing growth.  Consumer prices will rise 3.4 percent in 2011, compared
with 2.7 percent last year, the IMF said. Inflation will likely
slow to 1.6 percent in 2012, it said.  The current account surplus will decline to 0.3 percent of
GDP this year from 2.9 percent in 2010, the IMF said. The
forecast for 2012 is 0.7 percent.  Unemployment will drop to 5.9 percent in 2011 and 5.8
percent in 2012 from 6.7 percent last year, the IMF predicted in
today’s report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
