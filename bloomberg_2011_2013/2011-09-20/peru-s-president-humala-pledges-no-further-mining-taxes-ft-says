Peru’s government won’t levy
further taxes on the country’s mining industry beyond those
being debated in Congress this week, the  Financial Times 
reported, citing President  Ollanta Humala .  Under the new law, mining companies will have to pay a
sliding scale percentage of operating profits instead of the
previous royalty system of 1 to 3 percent of revenue, the
newspaper said. Companies will now pay a royalty of 1 to 12
percent of profits plus a tax rate of 2 to 8.4 percent, the
Financial Times said.  Companies including  Xstrata Plc (XTA)  and  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) ,
which have signed tax stability agreements, must pay a rate of 4
to 13.12 percent of profits, according to the newspaper.  The new taxes will bring the government $1 billion in
additional annual revenues, Humala told the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
