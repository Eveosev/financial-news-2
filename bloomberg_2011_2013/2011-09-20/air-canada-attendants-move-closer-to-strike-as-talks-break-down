Air Canada (AC/A) ’s flight attendants
reached a tentative agreement to avert a strike at the country’s
largest carrier just hours after an impasse in the negotiations.  The accord followed “marathon” talks that began on Aug.
31 , the Air Canada Contingent of the Canadian Union of Public
Employees said in a statement. The union’s 6,800 workers would
have been able to walk out at 12:01 a.m. tomorrow, and their
leaders urged members to adhere to regular schedules.  With the agreement, flights operated by regional carrier
Jazz will return to normal on Sept. 22 after some trips were
canceled for tomorrow to minimize disruptions from a possible
strike, Air Canada said in a statement.  The union isn’t discussing details until after the contract
has been ratified by members, President Jeff Taylor said in the
CUPE statement.  Air Canada and labor leaders had been in “intense” talks
in recent days and discussions fell apart late yesterday after
an airline representative “insulted” a federal mediator and
the union by denigrating their efforts, CUPE said in an earlier
statement. Peter Fitzpatrick, a spokesman for Air Canada,
declined to comment on the union’s assertion.  Passengers affected by the regional cancellations can
rebook or request a refund, the carrier said.  Flight attendants rejected a tentative agreement in August
with 88 percent of the vote, and they later voted in favor of a
strike mandate by 98 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
