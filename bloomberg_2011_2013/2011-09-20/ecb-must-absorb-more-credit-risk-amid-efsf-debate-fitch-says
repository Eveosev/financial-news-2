The  European Central Bank  will have
to absorb more risk as officials debate improving fiscal
governance and boosting the firepower of region’s rescue fund,
 Fitch Ratings  said.  “Reform to the governance of the euro area is politically
and technically complex and will take considerable time to put
in place,” Fitch said in a statement in London today. “In the
meantime, the ECB has little choice but to continue to absorb
more and more sovereign and bank risk on its balance sheet until
and unless the EFSF is enlarged and made more operationally
flexible.”  The ECB has bought the bonds of countries including Italy,
Spain and Ireland in a bid to contain debt-market turmoil while
governments work on measures including expanding the scope of
the European Financial Stability Facility. The  International
Monetary Fund  said in a report today that the central bank
“must continue to intervene strongly” in European debt markets
to “maintain orderly conditions.”  Countries in the 17-nation euro area are in the process of
approving expansion of the EFSF, part of a revised  Greece 
rescue program laid out on July 21. The next day, Fitch said
Greece faces “restricted default” on the plan’s call for
bondholder contributions.  “As reflected in its ratings, Fitch expects Greece to
default but not to leave the euro zone,” today’s report said.
While it would be “economically ‘irrational’ for Greece -- or
other distressed nations -- to leave the euro zone, if it did do
so with the encouragement and acceptance of other member
states,” it would “set an unhappy precedent.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
