The forint strengthened the most in
a month, rebounding from a two-year low, after the Hungarian
central bank’s offer to use its foreign-currency reserves to
help borrowers repay mortgages prompted traders to pare bets
against the currency.  The currency appreciated 1.3 percent to 287.3 per euro as
of 4:40 p.m. in Budapest and 2.1 percent to 236.3 per Swiss
franc.  Government bonds  maturing in June 2022 rallied, cutting
the yield 21 basis points to 7.83 percent.  Parliament approved a law yesterday that allows borrowers
to repay mortgages early at a fixed exchange rate of 180 forint
per Swiss franc and 250 forint per euro, provided they took out
the loans at lower exchange rates, while banks will assume the
losses. The forint tumbled 2.2 percent yesterday to the weakest
level against the euro since April 2009.  The central bank will allow domestic lenders to tap the
country’s reserves to address the expected increase in demand
for foreign currency, President  Andras Simor  said today, after
policy makers kept  interest rates  on hold.  Simor’s statement on currency reserves drove the forint
higher as the expected pressure on foreign-currency holdings
will be lessened, Michal Dybula and Bartosz Pawlowski,
economists at BNP Paribas SA, wrote in a research report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
