Grindrod Ltd. (GND) ,  Africa ’s largest
shipping company, plans to sell 2 billion rand ($262 million) of
new shares to  Remgro Ltd. (REM)  to fund projects including the
expansion of a coal terminal in Mozambique.  Remgro, a South African  investment company , will pay 15
rand a share, giving it 22 percent in Durban-based Grindrod,
according to a joint statement today. Grindrod’s shareholders
may buy stock on the same terms, lowering Remgro’s stake.
Grindrod plans to spend 10 billion rand in five years to expand
port and terminal capacity, particularly at Maputo, it said.  Capacity at the terminal rose to an annual 6 million metric
tons in February from 4 million tons, and a feasibility study is
underway on expanding capacity to 20 million tons, Grindrod says
on its  website . It has land for an expansion to 25 million tons.  “It is positive that Remgro is willing to pay a premium,”
Kenneth Hearn, an analyst at  Absa Capital , said in Johannesburg.
“Remgro clearly sees this expansion project as a value
investment.” The capital cost of expanding the Maputo terminal
to 25 million tons will be about 4.5 billion rand, he said.  Grindrod climbed 2.4 percent to 15.30 rand by 10:15 a.m. in
Johannesburg trading. Remgro, based in Stellenbosch, advanced
0.2 percent to 114.57 rand. The FTSE/JSE Africa All Share Index
was 0.4 percent higher. The transaction needs approval from
three-quarters of Grindrod’s shareholders.  To contact the reporter on this story:
