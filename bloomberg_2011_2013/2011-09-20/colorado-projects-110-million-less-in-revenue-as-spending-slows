Colorado  will collect $110 million
less in tax revenue for the current budget year than was
forecast in June as  consumer spending  slows, the state’s chief
economist said.  “Consumers, investors and businesses are becoming
increasingly unsure about the future,” said Natalie Mullis,
chief economist for the Legislative Council, in a briefing today
before the General Assembly’s Joint Budget Committee in Denver.
“Many things spooked them over the summer.”  Even with the slowdown, Colorado’s $7.17 billion budget for
fiscal 2012 remains balanced, the council’s  September forecast 
showed. Revenue should be sufficient enough to allow $279.3
million to remain in reserves at the end of the fiscal year June
30, according to the forecast.  To contact the reporter on this story:
