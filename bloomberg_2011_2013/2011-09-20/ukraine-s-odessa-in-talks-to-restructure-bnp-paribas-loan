The Ukrainian city of Odessa said
it is in talks with  BNP Paribas (BNP)  SA to restructure 40 million
Swiss francs ($45 million) of debt after the hryvnia fell more
than 6 percent against the Alpine nation’s currency this year.  “We are now working with the bank on loan restructuring
terms,” Ludmyla Boltovska, deputy head of the Odessa city
council’s finance department, said today by phone. “We want to
delay the maturity date and convert it into hryvnia,” she said,
adding that an agreement may be days away.  Odessa arranged the 50 million-franc, five-year loan in
2007, agreeing to an annual interest rate of 8.5 percent paid
quarterly, according to Bloomberg data. The city repaid the
first 10 million-franc tranche last December.  The loan will be converted into hryvnia, while its term may
be extended to 2015 from 2012, Odessa Mayor Oleksiy Kostusev
said today, the  Interfax-Ukraine  news agency reported.  To contact the reporters on this story:
