Treasuries climbed as  Standard &
Poor’s  decision to lower  Italy ’s credit rating spurred declines
in Asian equities, bolstering demand for the safest assets.  The yield on the 10-year note fell to 1.93 percent as of
1:07 p.m. in  Tokyo  from 1.95 percent in  New York  yesterday. The
rate reached a record low of 1.8770 percent on Sept. 12.  To contact the reporter on this story:
