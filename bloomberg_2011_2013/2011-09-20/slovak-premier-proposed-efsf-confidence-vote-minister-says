Slovak Premier Iveta Radicova has
proposed linking a vote on the euro bailout facility with a
confidence motion on the Cabinet to boost the chances the
legislation will pass and deal with the continent’s debt crisis,
a minister said.  Radicova made the proposal at the closed-door meeting of
ruling coalition leaders on Sept. 12 after Freedom and
Solidarity, one of the four ruling parties, reiterated that its
deputies will reject the overhaul of the bailout fund, Finance
Minister Ivan Miklos said today at a press conference in
Bratislava, Slovakia, adding the vote shall take place by Oct.
11.  Radicova needs Freedom and Solidarity’s votes to push
through the overhaul of the European Financial Stability
Facility, the temporary bailout fund, designed by European Union
leaders. A failure to approve the package in Slovakia, the euro-
area’s second-poorest member, would strip the region of the only
plan worked out so far to prevent the crisis from spreading.  Richard Sulik, the chairman of the party known also as SaS,
earlier today reiterated that his deputies won’t vote for the
package. He declined to say how the SaS will vote should the
votes be combined. A spokeman for Radicova was not immediately
available for comment when contacted today by mobile phone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
