The  Philippines  must review and put
a cap on taxes on oil products to limit price increases,  Petron
Corp. (PCOR)  Chairman Ramon Ang told reporters in  Manila  today.  The Philippines’ largest oil refiner is “open” to have
its books audited, Ang said. The government has generated a
“windfall” from taxes on oil amid rising prices, Ang said.  The government has created a task force to investigate how
 oil companies  set their prices, ABS-CBN News reported yesterday,
citing Transportation Secretary Mar Roxas.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
