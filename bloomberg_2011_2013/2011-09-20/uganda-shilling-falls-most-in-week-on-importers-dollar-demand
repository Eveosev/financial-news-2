Uganda ’s shilling, the world’s
worst-performing currency in 2011, declined the most in a week
against the dollar as oil importers and  utility companies  bought
the greenback to pay for inputs.  The currency of East Africa’s third-biggest economy
depreciated 0.5 percent 2,795 at 2:58 p.m. in the capital
Kampala, the biggest intraday drop since Sept. 13, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The shilling closed at 2,780
yesterday.  “The demand for the dollar is from the energy sector and
utility companies which want to import some materials,” Ahmed
Kalule, the head of  currency trading  at Bank of Africa Uganda
Ltd. said by phone from Kampala.  Uganda’s shilling reached 2,830 per dollar last month, the
weakest since 1993. The currency has declined 17 percent this
year, making it the world’s worst performer in the period.  A surge in food and fuel prices pushed inflation to a more
than 18-year high of 21.4 percent in August from 18.8 percent in
July, the Uganda Bureau of Statistics said on Aug. 31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
