Australia, the world’s largest
shipper of  iron ore  and coal, lowered its forecast for minerals
and energy export earnings 1.6 percent in the current fiscal
year as an increase in global supplies cuts prices.  Sales may total a record A$214.8 billion ($219 billion) in
the 12 months to June 30, 2012, the Bureau of Resources and
Energy Economics said in a statement today. That compares with a
June forecast of A$218.3 billion and a revised estimate of
A$176.9 billion for the year ended June 30.  “Expected production increases for many commodities are
forecast to limit further price growth” next year, the report
said. “Prices for aluminum, nickel, iron ore, metallurgical
coal and thermal coal are forecast to fall in 2012.”  The Australian economy, which has avoided a recession for
two decades, is getting a lift from mineral extraction. Mining
investment is projected to total A$82.1 billion in the 12 months
ending June 30, 45 percent more than last fiscal year, the
government has said, as companies such as  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP)  feed
 China  and  India ’s demand for coal, iron ore and natural gas.  Iron ore exports from Australia, the biggest shipper of the
steel-making material, are forecast to increase 10 percent from
the previous year to 449 million metric tons, 3 percent more
than the bureau’s June estimate. Revenue from iron ore is
forecast to surge 26 percent to A$68 billion, it said.  “The majority of steel production growth is expected to
occur in China and India in response to higher steel
consumption,” the report said. “In 2012, iron ore contract
prices are forecast to average $151 a ton as significant growth
in supply from Australia, coupled with weaker steel production,
particularly in OECD economies,” pressure prices, it said.  Coking Coal  Australia ’s export earnings from coking coal may gain 29
percent to A$37 billion, with shipments gaining 11 percent to
156 million tons, the report said.  Revenue from thermal coal may increase by 29 percent to
A$18 billion and from oil by 13 percent to A$13 billion, it said.
Liquefied natural gas sales may rise 11 percent to A$12 billion.  Exports of copper from Australia are forecast to increase
12 percent from the year before to 950,000 tons, mainly because
of higher mine production, the report said.  Australia saw economic growth of 1.2 percent in the second
quarter from the previous three months, the most in four years,
a government report showed this month. The Bureau of Resources
and Energy Economics is an independent economic and statistical
research unit within the Department of Resources, Energy and
Tourism that commenced operation on July 1.  To contact the reporters on this story:
