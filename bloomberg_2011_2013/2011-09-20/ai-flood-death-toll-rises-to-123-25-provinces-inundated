Thailand ’s government said the
death toll from flooding over the past two months rose to 132,
and warned that flash floods and landslides could still threaten
almost half of the nation’s provinces.  Heavy rain since July 25 has caused flooding in 55 of
Thailand’s 77 provinces, and 25 remain inundated, the Department
of Disaster Prevention & Mitigation said today on its website.
Flash floods and landslides could occur in 36 provinces in the
north and northeast over the next week, the state agency said.  Annual flooding could cause as much as 20 billion baht
($658 million) of damage to Thailand’s agricultural industry, up
from 16 billion baht in 2010, a unit of Kasikornbank Pcl said
yesterday in a report. Thailand is the world’s biggest exporter
of rice and the biggest producer of rubber.  To contact the reporter on this story:
