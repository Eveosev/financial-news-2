National Bank of Canada (NA) , the
country’s sixth-largest bank, agreed to buy the Canadian
investment-advisory business of  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA)  for C$206
million ($207 million) in cash.  The unit had assets under administration of C$14.2 billion
as of Aug. 31, HSBC said today in a statement. About 70 percent
of the business is in Ontario and British Columbia, National
Bank said in a separate statement.  HSBC, Europe’s largest bank, said in May it was focusing on
its “competitive strengths” such as expanding commercial
banking. The London-based lender said Sept. 6 it was in talks
for a possible sale of the business.  National Bank said the transaction will increase
“recurring” earnings per share by 3 cents to 5 cents for 2012
and 2013. It will also reduce its Tier 1 regulatory capital
ratio by about 40 basis points.  The companies said they expect the transaction to close in
December.  To contact the reporter on this story:
