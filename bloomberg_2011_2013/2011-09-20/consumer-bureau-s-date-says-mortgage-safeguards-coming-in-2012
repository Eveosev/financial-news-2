The Consumer Financial Protection
Bureau will complete work on a rule aimed at ensuring borrowers
have the ability to repay their mortgages early by next year,
according to Raj Date, the former banker running the new agency.  “We plan to issue a final rule early next year in order to
provide clarity to the market as quickly as we can, without
sacrificing the quality of our analysis,” Date said today at a
Washington conference sponsored by American Banker, a print and
online publication covering the financial-services industry.  The rule, required under the Dodd-Frank Act, was issued by
the  Federal Reserve  in April and has been taken over by the
consumer bureau, which began work in July. The measure includes
underwriting standards aimed at preventing abusive lending
practices that lawmakers and regulators say led to record
foreclosures in the wake of the 2008 credit crisis.  Date is a former executive with  Capital One Financial Corp. (COF) 
and  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  who joined the consumer bureau in February
as associate director for research, markets and regulation. He
took over as special adviser to the Treasury secretary
overseeing the agency on Aug. 1 after Harvard University law
professor  Elizabeth Warren  stepped down.  Richard Cordray , the former Ohio attorney general serving
as the consumer bureau’s enforcement chief, is awaiting Senate
confirmation to become its first director.  To contact the reporter on this story:
