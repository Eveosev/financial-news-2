I&M Bank Ltd., a Kenyan lender,
increased its main lending rate to 15.75 percent, according to a
statement published in the Nairobi-based Standard newspaper
today.  The increase is effective from Oct. 1, the bank said.  I&M currently charges a base lending rate of 15 percent,
Suprio Sengupta, general manager for marketing, said in a phone
interview today.  Kenya ’s central bank last week raised its benchmark
interest rate by 0.75 percentage points to 7 percent after
inflation soared to more than triple the government’s 5 percent
target.  To contact the reporter on this story:
