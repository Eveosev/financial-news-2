The U.K. government will stick to
its deficit-reduction plan, the Treasury said after the
 International Monetary Fund  cut its growth forecasts for the
British economy.   “It is welcome that the IMF have forecast that the U.K.
will grow more strongly than Germany, France and the eurozone as
next year, but it is clear that the U.K. is not immune to what
is going on in our biggest export markets, with every major
economy seeing lower forecasts for growth this year and next,”
the Treasury said in a statement released in London today.   “The government remains committed to implementing the
deficit reduction plan which has delivered stability, a policy
stance the  Christine Lagarde  described as ‘appropriate’ earlier
this month,” it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
