Aena Aeropuertos SA,  Spain ’s
airport operator, has no plans to change the terms of its
auctions for management contracts for  Madrid  and Barcelona
airports, said a spokeswoman for the company, who declined to be
named in line with policy.  She denied a report in Expansion today that Aena may lower
the minimum price and make the conditions more flexible. Once
the tender has been opened, it’s legally impossible to change
the conditions, she said in a telephone interview in Madrid
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
