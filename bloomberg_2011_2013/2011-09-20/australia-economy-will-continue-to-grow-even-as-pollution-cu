Australia ’s economy will “continue
to grow strongly” with a price on  carbon emissions  to cut
pollution, Treasurer  Wayne Swan  said today in an e-
mailed statement.  Updated projections show national employment increasing by
1.6 million jobs through 2020 and incomes rising by about
A$9,000 in today’s terms by the end of the decade even with a
price on carbon, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
