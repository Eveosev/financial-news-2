Bulgaria fired Lothar Matthaeus as
national coach after the team failed to qualify for the 2012
European soccer championships, losing to England and  Switzerland 
earlier this month.  Matthaeus will be replaced by Bulgaria’s under-21 trainer,
Mihail Madanski, as acting national team coach, the  Bulgarian
Football Union  in Sofia said on its website today. Matthaeus,
50, a former captain of the West German national team and 1990
World Cup winner, was named the first-ever FIFA World Player of
the Year in 1991.  He was appointed to manage the Bulgarian team a year ago.
Matthaeus previously coached a number of clubs, including
 Austria ’s Rapid Vienna.  To contact the reporter on this story:
