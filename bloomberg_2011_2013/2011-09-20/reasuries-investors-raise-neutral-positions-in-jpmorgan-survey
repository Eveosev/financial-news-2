Investors in Treasuries increased
neutral positions in the securities for the first time in four
weeks, according to a survey by JPMorgan Chase & Co.  About 74 percent of the clients surveyed by the primary
dealer were neutral in the week ended Sept. 19, up from 72
percent in the previous week. The amount of so-called longs was
unchanged at 11 percent. The percent of investors who were
“short” dropped by 2 percent to 15 percent.  JPMorgan doesn’t disclose the number of clients in the
survey. Srini Ramaswamy, a JPMorgan strategist in  New York ,
wasn’t immediately available to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
