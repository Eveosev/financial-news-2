     Sept. 20 (Bloomberg) -- BusinessEurope , an employers’
federation, said  Europe  needs to make its labor policies more
flexible as part of efforts to close the budget gaps plaguing
many European nations.  European Union members  should make it easier for companies
to hire workers under temporary contracts and for workers to
change jobs and move around, the trade group said in a  policy
paper  released in Brussels today. The group also called for
changes to social safety net policies so that the unemployed
would have more incentive to look for work.  Better labor-market policies would help “to boost the tax
bases and therefore to restore the credibility of public-finance
positions,” Philippe De Buck, the group’s secretary general,
said at a press briefing in Brussels. “It’s not a cut, it’s a
solution.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
