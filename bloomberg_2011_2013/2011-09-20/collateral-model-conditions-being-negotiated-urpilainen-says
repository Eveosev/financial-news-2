Finland ’s Finance Minister Jutta Urpilainen said collateral in exchange for the second Greek
bailout will be “conditional,” as decided by the euro group
last week.  The conditions and the model of collateral are being
negotiated, she told lawmakers in Helsinki today, without
providing details. Collateral conditions must be acceptable to
Finland, Urpilainen said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
