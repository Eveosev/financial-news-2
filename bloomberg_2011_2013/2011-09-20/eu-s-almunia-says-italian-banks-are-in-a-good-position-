Commissioner  Joaquin Almunia  said Italian banks are in a “good
position” and basically sound financially.  “I still believe that Italian banks are in a good
position,” Almunia told reporters in Brussels today. “They’ve
managed to get through the stress tests; they’ve gone through
the crisis without needing any public support that other banks
in other countries needed.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
