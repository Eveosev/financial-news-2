Beijing Enterprises Group Co. is
offering to pay an all-in fee of 270 to 280 basis points more
than the  Hong Kong  interbank offered rate on a HK$1 billion
($128 million) loan, a person familiar with the matter said.  The facility will be a three-year club loan and proceeds
will be used for the acquisition of a toll road related asset,
said the person who asked not to be identified because the
details are private.  Hong Kong-based spokeswoman for  Beijing Enterprises
Holdings Ltd. (392) , a unit of Beijing Enterprises Group, Louise Chen,
said the group was borrowing in Hong Kong to take advantage of
lower  interest rates . She declined to comment on the details of
the financing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
