The ruble fell to the weakest level
against the central bank’s target dollar-euro basket in almost
two years after Standard & Poor’s cut  Italy ’s credit rating,
stoking concern  Europe ’s debt crisis will worsen.  Russia ’s currency depreciated 0.6 percent to 36.5738 versus
the basket as of 11:40 a.m. in Moscow, the lowest level since
December 2009 based on closing prices. The ruble sank as much as
1 percent against the dollar and traded 0.4 percent lower at
31.4061. It lost 0.7 percent to 42.9000 per euro.  S&P downgraded Italy on concern that weakening economic
growth and a “fragile” government mean the nation won’t be able
to reduce the euro-region’s second-largest debt burden. The
ruble pared earlier declines after oil, Russia’s chief export
earner, rebounded 0.6 percent to $86.17 a barrel. It lost 2.6
percent yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
