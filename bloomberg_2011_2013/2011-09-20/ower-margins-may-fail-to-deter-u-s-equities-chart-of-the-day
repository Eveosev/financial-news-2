Anyone who presumes U.S. stocks
will decline as companies become less profitable is overlooking
history, according to Ian Scott, a global strategist at Nomura
Holdings Inc.  The CHART OF THE DAY shows income, adjusted for changes in
the value of inventories and for wear and tear on buildings and
equipment, as a percentage of gross domestic product. Data from
the  Federal Reserve  and the Commerce Department were used in the
calculations.  Last quarter’s earnings amounted to 10.1 percent of GDP,
marking the first time they exceeded 10 percent since the Fed
began compiling quarterly figures in 1947.  “With such an elevated margin, things will surely reverse
soon,” Scott, based in  London , wrote two days ago in a report
with a similar chart. “History tells us to be cautious in
jumping to a bearish conclusion based on a likely turn.”  Scott cited eight peaks in profits relative to GDP between
1955 and 2006. Each occurred in a different cycle of economic
expansion, as the chart shows. After they were reached, the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index averaged a 4 percent gain in the
following year and a 12 percent advance in the next two years.  The only high to precede losses for the one- and two-year
periods was recorded in the fourth quarter of 1972, just before
the 1973-1974  bear market  started. Earnings were 5.7 percent of
GDP for the quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
