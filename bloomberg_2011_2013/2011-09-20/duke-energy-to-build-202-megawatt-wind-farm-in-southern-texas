Duke Energy Corp. (DUK)  will build a 202-
megawatt wind farm in southern  Texas  and sell the electricity
and renewable energy credits to Austin Energy under a 25-year
agreement.  The Los Vientos II Windpower Project, in Willacy County, is
the sixth wind farm Duke has announced this year, the Charlotte,
N.C.-based energy company said today in a statement. 
It’s the second phase of a 402-megawatt project announced in
August. Construction is set to begin by December and it is
expected to go into operation by the end of 2012. Duke hasn’t
picked a turbine supplier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
