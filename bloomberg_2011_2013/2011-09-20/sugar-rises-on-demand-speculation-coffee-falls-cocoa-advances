Sugar rose for a second day on
speculation that demand may pick up after a slump that saw
prices drop 15 percent in four weeks. Coffee declined, while
cocoa advanced.  Pakistan ’s National Price Monitoring Committee has
recommended importing 400,000 metric tons of the sweetener to
meet domestic requirements after flooding harmed the cane crop,
the Business Recorder reported. Raw-sugar futures in  New York 
plunged yesterday to an 11-week low of 26.18 cents a pound.  “People hope that the latest drop may attract buyers
around 26 cents,” Jeff Bauml, a senior vice president at
brokerage R.J. O’Brien & Associates in New York, said in a
telephone interview.  Raw sugar for March delivery rose 0.08 cent, or 0.3
percent, to settle at 26.79 cents at 2 p.m. on ICE Futures U.S.
in New York. Yesterday, prices rose 1.5 percent. The commodity
fell to 26.31 cents on Sept. 16, from 30.96 cents on Aug. 19.  Arabica-coffee futures for December delivery retreated 1.85
cents, or 0.7 percent, to $2.602 a pound on ICE. The price has
dropped 9.7 percent this month, following a 20 percent gain in
August.  Cocoa futures for December delivery advanced $14, or 0.5
percent, to $2,730 a metric ton in New York, gaining for the
second time in three sessions.  In  London , refined-sugar futures fell, while robusta coffee
and cocoa rose.  To contact the reporter on this story:
