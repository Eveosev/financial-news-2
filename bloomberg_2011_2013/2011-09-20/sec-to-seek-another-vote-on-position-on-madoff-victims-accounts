The U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission will seek another vote on the agency’s position on
the valuation of the accounts of  Bernard Madoff ’s victims,
Chairman  Mary Schapiro  said in an e-mailed statement.  The move was recommended by its internal watchdog, who
asked the  Justice Department  to consider whether the SEC’s
former general counsel violated criminal conflict of interest
law through his work on policy related to the Madoff fraud.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
