Iceland’s government is considering
taking legal action against the U.K. for its use of anti-
terrorism laws against Icelandic interests after the failure of
Landsbanki Islands hf, Prime Minister Johanna Sigurdardottir
said.  “A team of lawyers from the prime minister’s office and
the  finance ministry ” will consider the options, she told
reporters in Reykjavik today.  Iceland has promised to pay out $11.4 billion from the
estate of Landsbanki to cover foreign depositor losses related
to its high-yielding Icesave Internet accounts. The bank’s
failure prompted the U.K. to use the  Anti-Terrorism, Crime and
Security Act 2001  to take control of Icelandic assets held in
Britain on Oct. 8 the same year and soured the island’s
international ties.  To contact the reporter on this story:
