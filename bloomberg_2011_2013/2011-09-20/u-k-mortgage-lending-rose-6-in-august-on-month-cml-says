U.K. mortgage lending rose last
month to the highest since July 2009, reflecting stability in
the housing market, the  Council of Mortgage Lenders  said.  Gross mortgage lending rose 6 percent from July to 13.4
billion pounds ($21 billion), the CML said in a  statement  in
 London  today. That’s the highest for an August since 2008. From
a year earlier, lending rose 10 percent.  The level of lending points to a “subdued but broadly
stable” market, CML Chief Economist Bob Pannell said in the
statement.  A shortage of property supply is helping to support values,
with Rightmove Plc saying yesterday that Britons raised asking
prices for homes by 0.7 percent in September. Still,  Bank of
England  data show U.K. mortgage approvals have held below 50,000
in every month but one since the start of 2010.  “While housing market activity has edged up from its lows
recently, there remains little sign of any real step up,”
 Howard Archer , economist at IHS Global Insight in London, said
in a research note. “The data do not point to any significant
pick up in mortgage advances for house buying.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
