Siderar SAIC (ERAR) , Argentina’s largest
steel producer, surged today in Buenos Aires trading after
announcing plans to capitalize funds it had for future dividend
payments and hand out new shares to current stockholders.  Siderar rose 3.8 percent to 24.90 pesos at 2:41 p.m. New
York time after advancing as much as 6.3 percent, its biggest
intraday gain since Aug. 16. The Merval index gained 1 percent.  The steel producer, a unit of Luxembourg-based  Ternium SA (TX) ,
will transfer up to 4.2 billion pesos ($1 billion) in funds from
an account for future dividends payments to capitalize the
company and will also issue 4.2 billion new shares that will be
distributed to current shareholders, according to a statement
posted yesterday on the website of the Buenos Aires stock
exchange.  “It’s strictly an accounting measure and investors are
just using any excuse from the market to buy the stock,”
 Christian Reos , an analyst at Buenos Aires-based brokerage firm
Allaria Ledesma & Cia. Soc. de Bolsa, said in a telephone
interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
