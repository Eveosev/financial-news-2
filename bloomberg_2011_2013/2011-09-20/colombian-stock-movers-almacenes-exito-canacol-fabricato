The following companies are having
unusual price changes in Bogota trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of 1:08 p.m. New York time.  The IGBC Index rose 0.5 percent to 13,910.46 while the
Colcap Index gained 0.3 percent to 1,685.95.  Almacenes Exito SA (EXITO)  , Colombia’s biggest publicly
traded retailer, rose 0.5 percent to 24,100 pesos. Colombia’s
retail sales rose 11.8 percent in July from a year earlier, the
national statistics agency said yesterday on its website.  Canacol Energy Ltd. (CNEC)  , the Calgary-based oil
company with fields in the South American country, fell 2.3
percent to 1,500 pesos, the lowest intraday level since the
stock began trading in July 2010. The company may be hitting new
lows because the market is waiting for news on its exploration
projects in the Caguan-Putumayo basin, said Juan David Pineros,
an oil sector analyst for Interbolsa SA, Colombia’s biggest
brokerage.  The company plans to release new information in the first
week in October, Carolina Orozco, head of  investor relations  for
Canacol in Colombia, said Sept. 14.  Fabricato SA (FABRI CB), Colombia’s biggest textile maker,
rose 0.7 percent to 73.5 pesos. The  U.S. Senate  is set to begin
debate today on trade preference and worker-aid programs that
would clear the way for President Barack Obama to send Congress
three pending free-trade agreements, including one with
Colombia. Senator  Harry Reid  of Nevada, the Democratic leader,
plans to move ahead with legislation that would revive tariff
preferences for goods from developing nations after lawmakers
voted 84-8 last night to limit debate, the first step in the
process of acting on the measures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
