Beatrice Weder di Mauro, a member
of German Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s council of economic
advisers, said current monetary policy reflects an “exceptional
situation” and is “not sustainable.”  “There’s no question that this isn’t a sustainable
situation,” Weder di Mauro said during a panel discussion in
Berlin today, citing the  European Central Bank ’s resumption of
buying euro-area sovereign bonds. “The question is how we get
out of it.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
