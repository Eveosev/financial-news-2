Indian Railway Finance Corp.â€™s $200
million, five-year term loan attracted seven additional banks in
syndication and has now been signed, according to a person
familiar with the matter.  Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd., Bank of America
Corp., Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd., BNP Paribas SA,
Chinatrust Commercial Bank, Mizuho Financial Group Inc. and
Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp. were hired to help arrange the
loan in June and marketed the facility to other lenders.  Those banks were joined by Aozora Bank Ltd., Sumitomo
Mitsui Trust Holdings Inc., Mega International Commercial Bank
Co., Chang Hwa Commercial Bank,  Land Bank  of  Taiwan , Hachijuni
Bank Ltd. and United Taiwan Bank, the person said.  The facility pays a so-called all-in fee of 145 basis
points more than the London interbank offered rate, the person
said.  Three calls to the office phone of S. Radhakrishnan, the
general manager for overseas borrowings at Indian Railway
Finance, went unanswered.  To contact the reporter on this story:
