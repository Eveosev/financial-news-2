Italy  is taking “ambitious” belt-
tightening steps that will erase the  budget deficit , the
European Commission said.  “The full implementation of these measures should allow
Italy to achieve a sizable primary surplus in 2013 and this will
be instrumental to put the very high government debt on a steady
downward path,” commission spokesman  Amadeu Altafaj  told
reporters in Brussels today.  He declined to comment on the downgrade of Italy’s credit
rating by  Standard & Poor’s .  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
