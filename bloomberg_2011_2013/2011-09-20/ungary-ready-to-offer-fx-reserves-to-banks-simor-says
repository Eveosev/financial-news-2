Hungary ’s central bank will allow
domestic banks to tap the country’s foreign-currency reserves to
address an expected rise in foreign-currency demand as borrowers
repay loans at below-market rates.  The central bank estimates that 20 percent of a total of 18
billion euros ($24.6 billion) in foreign-currency mortgages will
be repaid at fixed exchange rates that are below market levels
as part of a government plan, Governor Andras Simor said at a
press conference in Budapest today.  “The central bank is ready to offer domestic banks the
amount of foreign currency necessary for the early repayment of
foreign-currency loans from the country’s foreign-currency
reserves, should banks require it,” Simor said. The offer may
“damp financial stability risks,” he said, adding that details
of the plan will be announced in the “coming days.”  Hungarian lawmakers passed a law yesterday allowing the
repayment of Swiss-franc denominated mortgages at a fixed
exchange rate of 180 forint per Swiss franc and 250 forint per
euro.  The European Union said the proposal may violate its rules
and Standard and Poor’s, which rates Hungary one step above
junk, said the move may hurt lending, growth and public
finances.  The repayments will “cause significant losses” at local
banks, weakening their ability to boost lending and thus hurting
the country’s economic outlook, Simor said.  Hungary’s foreign reserves stood at 34.7 billion euros at
the end of August, according to central bank data.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
