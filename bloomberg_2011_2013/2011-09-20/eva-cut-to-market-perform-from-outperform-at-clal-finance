Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (TEVA) 
was lowered to “market perform” from “outperform” at Clal
Finance Brokerage Ltd., which withdrew its $55 share-price
estimate. Clal said it expects second-half results to
“disappoint the market,” according to an e-mailed statement
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
