Peru ’s congress will debate and
probably approve laws this week that raise taxes on mining
companies, Finance Minister Miguel Castilla said.  The tax changes respect the spirit of the accord that
followed two months of talks between the government and mining
companies, Castilla said in an interview with Lima-based Radio
Programas today.  The law, which was unanimously approved by the mining and
finance commissions in Peru’s Congress last night, will be
debated in congress Sept. 22, Castilla said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
