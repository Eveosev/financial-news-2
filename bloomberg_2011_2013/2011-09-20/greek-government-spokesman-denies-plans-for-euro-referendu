Greek government spokesman Ilias
Mosialos said Greek Prime Minister  George Papandreou  wasn’t
considering holding a referendum on whether his nation should
exit the euro common currency, denying a report in Kathimerini
newspaper.  “There are no thoughts whatsoever on this,” Mosialos said
in a phone interview today. “It’s a no-go area for us. We are
members of the euro and this is not going to be put to a
referendum.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
