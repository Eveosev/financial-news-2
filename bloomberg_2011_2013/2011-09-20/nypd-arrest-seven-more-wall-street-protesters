The  New York City Police Department 
said it arrested seven people in Lower Manhattan today in
connection with protests against Wall Street financial firms.  The people taken into custody during two incidents in
Zuccotti Park include a protester who used a bullhorn without a
permit and another who tried to prevent police from removing a
tarp “that had been erected in violation of the sanitation
code,”  Paul Browne , a police spokesman, said in an e-mail.  The person with the tarp suffered a leg injury after
fighting with police and refused medical treatment, Browne said.
Police had said earlier that the wounded protester was treated
by emergency-medical workers. Another demonstrator was arrested
on an outstanding bench warrant, Browne said. A total of 16
people have been arrested over four days, he said.  The protest, dubbed “#OccupyWallStreet,” aims to get
President  Barack Obama  to establish a commission to end “the
influence money has over our representatives in  Washington ,”
according to the website of Adbusters, a group promoting the
demonstration. Organizers want participants to occupy the area
for “a few months,” according to the  website .  The demonstration started with about 1,000 people on Sept.
17, short of the 20,000 that organizers had sought. Today’s
march ended about 4:30 p.m. local time in Zuccotti Park with
about 100 protesters.  To contact the reporter on this story:
