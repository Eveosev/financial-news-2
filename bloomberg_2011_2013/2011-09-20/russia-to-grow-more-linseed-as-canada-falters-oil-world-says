Farmers in  Russia , Ukraine and
 Kazakhstan  are boosting output of linseed, or flaxseed, taking
advantage of falling shipments of the oilseed from Canada, once
the world’s largest grower, Oil World said.  Linseed production in former Soviet Union countries is
forecast to jump 45 percent to 480,000 metric tons in 2011,
while Canada’s harvest of the oilseed will slump 14 percent,
falling for a second year, to 365,000 tons, the Hamburg-based
 researcher  said in a weekly report. Linseed is used in edible
oils and paints and the fiber goes into making linen.  Canadian exports of flaxseed to the European Union, the
biggest buyer of the oilseed, slumped after the 27-nation bloc
found shipments with unauthorized genetically modified seed in
2009.  Canada ’s flaxseed harvest fell more than 50 percent last
year as EU demand for its crop dropped, according to Oil World.  “Canada has lost its role as the world’s largest linseed
producer and exporter,” Oil World said. “Farmers in
Kazakhstan, Russia and Ukraine have quickly responded to the
supply disruptions in Canada by expanding plantings.”  World linseed production will probably drop to 1.95 million
tons in the 2011-12 season, the lowest in four years and down
from 2.03 million tons a year earlier, Oil World said.  “Flaxseed cultivation suffered a major blow in Canada,”
the researcher said. Former Soviet Union “countries can
probably not fully offset the reductions in Canada and the
U.S.,” Oil World said.  The stocks-to-use ratio for linseed will drop to about 12
percent in the 2011-12 season from 15 percent a year earlier,
the lowest in at least five years, according to Oil World.  “Crushings will probably need to decline in major
countries such as the EU 27 and the U.S.,” it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
