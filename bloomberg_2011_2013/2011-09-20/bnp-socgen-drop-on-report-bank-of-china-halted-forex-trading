BNP Paribas (BNP)  SA and  Societe Generale (GLE) 
SA fell in Paris trading after a report said Bank of China Ltd.
stopped trading foreign-exchange forwards and swaps with the
lenders along with other European banks.  BNP Paribas, France’s biggest lender, declined 6.5 percent
to 24.92 euros, while Societe Generale, the country’s second-
largest bank, dropped 3.1 percent to 17.15 euros. The 46-member
Bloomberg Europe Banks and Financial Services Index rose 1
percent.  “There are concerns about the counterparty risks of French
banks and that’s why Bank of China cut the swap lines,” said
Lutz Roehmeyer, who helps manage $14 billion at Landesbank
Berlin Investment GmbH and owns shares in Societe Generale and
BNP Paribas. “It’s a bad sign.”  Bank of  China  has stopped trading foreign-exchange forwards
and swaps with several European banks on concerns about the
region’s debt crisis, Reuters reported today, citing three
unidentified people. The lenders include Societe Generale, BNP
Paribas and  Credit Agricole  SA, the newswire said.  A Paris-based spokesman at BNP Paribas declined to comment
on the report, as well as a spokeswoman at Societe Generale and
Credit Agricole.  To contact the reporter on this story:
