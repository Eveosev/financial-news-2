Rents for capesize ships that haul
iron ore and coal may fail to sustain a rally because of a glut
of vessels, according to Clarkson Research Services Ltd.  Average hire costs tripled in seven weeks and last week
reached the highest level since Dec. 6, data from the  Baltic
Exchange  in  London  show. The dry-bulk fleet will expand this
year as the equivalent of 1,039 new panamax-sized vessels enter
service, 643 more than needed, calculations show in Clarkson’s
Dry Bulk Trade Outlook, published yesterday.  “Given the expected continued rapid expansion of the
fleet, the sustainability of the current improved rates is
therefore questionable,” said Clarkson, a unit of the world’s
biggest shipbroker.  Daily capesize hire costs gained 5.4 percent to $24,276
today, increasing for the first session in four and helping to
lift the Baltic Dry Index, a broader measure of commodity-
shipping rates. Still, the capesize rally is over, said Erik Stavseth, an analyst with Oslo-based investment bank Arctic
Securities ASA.  “We see rates declining further and would not be surprised
to see capes hit the $15,000-a-day mark,” he said in an e-
mailed report. That implies a 38 percent drop from today’s rate,
which is already down 16 percent from last week’s high.  Colombia ,  Brazil   Record iron-ore cargoes shipped from Australia’s  Port
Hedland  led the surge in capesize hire costs, SSY Consultancy &
Research Ltd. said in a monthly report e-mailed yesterday. Extra
coal cargoes from Colombia and ore from Brazil also contributed,
it said.  The index gained 1.8 percent to 1,795, held back by lower
rents for panamax vessels, exchange data show. Panamaxes are the
largest ships that can navigate the  Panama Canal  and typically
carry about 70,000 metric tons of cargo, about 40 percent as
much as a capesize.  Gains in capesize hire costs were led by rents for vessels
immediately available to load cargoes from Atlantic Ocean region
ports, which climbed 9.4 percent to $26,364.  Daily panamax rents fell 1.7 percent to $13,673, according
to the exchange. Hire costs averaged $12,458 last month, this
year’s lowest level, while the average capesize rate of $13,142
was the highest in 2011, its data show.  Disrupted shipments of coking coal, used in steelmaking,
from  Australia  and slowing grain exports combined with a ship
surplus to cap panamax rates, according to Clarkson.  Rents for supramax ships, about 25 percent smaller than
panamaxes, gained 0.4 percent to $15,230 a day. Handysizes, the
smallest vessels tracked by the index, advanced 0.1 percent to
$10,093.  To contact the reporter on this story:
