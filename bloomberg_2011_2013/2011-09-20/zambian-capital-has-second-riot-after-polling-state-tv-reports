Residents of John Laing Compound, a
poor area of Zambia’s capital, Lusaka, rioted late yesterday
after polling stations closed at the end of a day of voting in
presidential and parliamentary elections, ZNBC reported.  About 145 people were injured in the riots, Zambia National
Broadcasting Corp. said.  The riot followed an earlier protest in a Lusaka slum after
youths destroyed ballot papers and election material before
police fired tear gas to disperse the crowd. The destruction of
the election papers will prevent some residents from voting,
ZNBC said.  About 5.1 million Zambians registered to vote in the Sept.
20 ballot, the largest number in the southern African nation’s
history. There were no reports of violence outside the capital,
ZNBC said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
