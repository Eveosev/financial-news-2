The U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission subpoenaed  hedge funds , specialized traders and
various financial firms over possible  insider trading  before the
U.S. credit rating downgrade last month, the Wall Street Journal
reported, citing people familiar with the matter.  SEC officials are focusing on firms that bet the stock
market would tumble; the  Dow Jones Industrial Average  fell 5.5
percent on the first full day of trading after the Standard &
Poorâ€™s Corp. downgrade, the newspaper said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
