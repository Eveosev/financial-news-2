India’s rupee weakened a second day
as a sovereign credit-rating downgrade for  Italy  added to signs
 Europe ’s debt crisis is worsening.  The currency trimmed losses, after touching a two-year low
earlier, on speculation gains in local shares will spur foreign
fund inflows. Standard & Poor’s yesterday cut its credit
assessment for Italy by one step to A, saying the nation’s net
debt levels were the highest among A-rated countries.  “The concern is mainly from the euro zone,” said J. Moses Harding, an executive vice president at IndusInd Bank Ltd. in
Mumbai. He said global conditions will determine the direction
of the rupee in the near term.  The rupee dropped 0.5 percent to 48.06 per dollar at the 5
p.m. close in Mumbai, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
It earlier touched 48.25, the lowest level since Sept. 25, 2009.  The BSE  India  Ltd.’s Sensitive Index gained the most in
more than three weeks today and European stocks rallied after
 Greece  described its debt talks as “productive”.  Offshore forwards indicate the rupee will trade at 48.70 in
three months, compared with expectations of 48.45 yesterday.
