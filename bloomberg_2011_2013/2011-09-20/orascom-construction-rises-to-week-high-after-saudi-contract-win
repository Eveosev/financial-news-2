Orascom Construction Industries (OCIC) ,
 Egypt ’s biggest publicly traded builder, headed for the highest
close in a week after its Saudi Arabian unit won a contract to
build a sports development in the kingdom.  The shares of the Cairo-based company rose 1.7 percent to
235.79 Egyptian pounds at 11:04 a.m. in Cairo, poised for the
highest close in a week. That gave the company a market value of
48.8 billion pounds ($8.2 billion). Egypt’s benchmark  EGX 30
Index (EGX30)  increased 1.7 percent.  A joint venture between Orascom Construction’s BESIX Group
and Al-Muhaidib Contracting Co. won a 380 million-euro ($519
million) contract to design and construct King Abdullah Sports
City near Jeddah, Orascom said today.  Separately, the company said yesterday it would pay a $1.1
dividend per share on Oct. 5 for shareholders as of Oct. 2.  To contact the reporter on this story:
