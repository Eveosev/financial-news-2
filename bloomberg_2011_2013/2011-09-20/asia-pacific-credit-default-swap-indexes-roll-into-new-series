The latest series of Markit Group
Ltd.’s indexes measuring the cost of insuring Asia-Pacific debt
with credit-default swaps started trading today.  The Series 16 Markit iTraxx Asia index of swaps linked to
40 investment-grade borrowers outside Japan was at 205 basis
points as of 8:29 a.m. in  Hong Kong , according to  Credit
Agricole  SA. That compares with a closing price of 172.8 basis
points for the previous series yesterday, according to data
provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index of swaps on 25 companies
was trading at 199 basis points as of 10:07 a.m. in Sydney,
according to Credit Agricole. Series 15 closed at 184.8 basis
points yesterday, CMA prices show.  The new version of the Markit iTraxx Japan index was at 185
as of 8:59 a.m. in  Tokyo , according to Deutsche Bank AG. The
Series 15 index closed at 154.3 on Sept. 16, according to CMA,
which is owned by CME Group Inc. and compiles prices quoted by
dealers in the privately negotiated market. It was a public
holiday in  Japan  yesterday.  New series of the benchmarks are created every six months
when companies are added or dropped depending on their ratings,
cost of protection and ease of trading. The maturity date of the
new indexes is December 2016, compared with June 2016 on the
Series 15 versions.  Samsung Electronics Co., the world’s second-largest maker
of mobile phones, and Genting Bhd were among 10 firms whose
credit-default swaps were cut from the Asian gauge, which had
the number of members reduced to 40 from 50, according to
information on Markit’s  website .  In Japan’s index, default-swap contracts on Chubu Electric
Power Co., Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha Ltd. and Softbank Corp.
replaced Canon Inc., Komatsu Ltd. and Mitsui Chemicals Inc.,
according to Markit. The members of the Australian index were
unchanged.  Credit-default swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower
fails to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted
debt. A basis point on a credit-default swap contract protecting
$10 million of debt from default for five years is equivalent to
$1,000 a year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
