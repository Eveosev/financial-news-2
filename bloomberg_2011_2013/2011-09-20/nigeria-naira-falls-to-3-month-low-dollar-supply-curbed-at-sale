Nigeria ’s naira depreciated to its
weakest level in three months against the dollar after the
central bank failed to meet lenders’ demands for the U.S.
currency at an auction yesterday.  The currency of sub-Saharan Africa’s second-biggest economy
retreated 0.3 percent to 157.15 naira per dollar in interbank
trading at 3:44 p.m. in Lagos, the lowest level since June 16,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Nigeria sold $350
million compared with $467.6 million demanded by lenders at an
auction yesterday, with naira declining 0.2 percent to 153.90
naira, the Abuja-based  Central Bank of Nigeria  said. It was the
20th straight auction where demand exceeded supply.  “Dealers expect depreciation of the naira in interbank
trading today owing to the low dollar supply in the official
foreign-exchange market,” analysts at Lagos-based Diamond Bank
Plc wrote in an e-mailed note to clients today.  Africa ’s biggest oil producer uses its foreign-currency
reserves to keep the naira within a 3 percentage-point band
above or below 150 naira per dollar at its twice-weekly dollar
sales to help curb inflation.  Nigeria’s central bank raised its benchmark interest rate
yesterday for the fifth time this year by 50 basis points to
9.25 percent to rein in inflation and support the naira.  To contact the reporter on this story:
