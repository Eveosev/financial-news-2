Kenya â€™s port of Mombasa acquired
three gantry cranes valued at $25.8 million from  China  to help
ease congestion, Transport Minister Amos Kimunya said.  The machines, which have the capacity to carry 50 metric
tons and can hoist two containers at once, will expedite loading
and offloading of vessels, Kimunya told reporters yesterday in
Mombasa. The port now has seven gantry cranes, he said.  Mombasa handles cargo to and from  Uganda , Burundi, South
Sudan, eastern  Democratic Republic  of Congo and Somalia.
Congestion has worsened because of increased imports of
fertilizer, wheat and corn, Gichiri Ndua, managing director of
the Kenya Ports Authority, said in a phone interview today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
