Citadele Banka AS, the Latvian
lender majority owned by the state, was placed on possible
downgrade by Moody’s Investors Service because of the
deteriorating quality of its assets.  “The review for a possible downgrade of Citadele’s ratings
primarily reflects concerns surrounding the deterioration of
asset quality beyond Moody’s expectations at the bank’s
inception in August 2010 and deteriorated low capitalization
levels,” Moody’s said in an e-mailed statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
