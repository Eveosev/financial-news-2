Telford Homes Plc (TEF) , a developer
focused on east London, said annual profit will more than double
through 2013 as private sales lift margins and its projects get
a boost from the Olympics and  Europe ’s largest urban mall.  Pretax profit will grow to about 7.5 million pounds ($11.8
million) in the year through March 2013 from 3 million pounds in
fiscal 2011, Chief Executive Officer Jon Di-Stefano said in an
interview. Telford’s operating margin before interest and tax
will grow to 9 percent in 2013 from 6 percent in 2012.  “We believe the share price is significantly undervalued
but we have to prove it, and that’ll be toward 2013,” Di-
Stefano said in an interview at Celtic Manor in Wales. “We’re
still making a small profit.”  Telford, based in Waltham Cross,  England , is selling more
homes on the open market to increase margins after it focused on
regeneration and sales of low-cost homes to non-profit housing
associations after the  property market  crashed in 2007. The
company has remained profitable since the slump.  Telford’s shares, which peaked at 4.30 pounds on July 17,
2007, were priced at 66.5 pence at yesterday’s market close in
London, giving the company a market value of 33.1 million
pounds. The stock has retreated 19 percent this year, compared
with a 2.8 percent increase for the Bloomberg Europe
Homebuilder’s Index of which it’s not a member.  The London 2012 Olympics and the 1.45 billion-pound
Westfield Stratford City mall close to the main stadium will
help boost values in the east of the city, said Di-Stefano, a
former Telford financial director who became CEO in July.  Olympic Park  “It’s a little like the impact of  Canary Wharf  on the Isle
of Dogs,” he said, referring to London’s second-biggest
financial district. “The Olympic Park isn’t going to collapse
and Westfield Stratford isn’t going away.”  Though  home prices  near the 560-acre Olympic park fell 7
percent in the year through July, they have gained about 19
percent overall since London won the right to host the games
five years ago, according to Zoopla.co.uk.  The company’s Bow Trinity project is around 2 miles (3
kilometers) south of the Olympic Park and a mile and a half
north of Canary Wharf, while its Kinetica development is about 3
miles west of the stadium.  To contact the reporter on this story:
