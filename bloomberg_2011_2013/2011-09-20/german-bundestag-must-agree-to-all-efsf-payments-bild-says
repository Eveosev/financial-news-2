Germany â€™s lower house of parliament
must in future approve each payment made by the European
Financial Stability Facility or changes to the fund, Bild
reported, citing an agreement made by the ruling coalition
parties.  A special committee will be set up to handle fast-track
requests made of the EFSF, Bild said. Every party represented in
the Bundestag must have a member on the committee named by the
Budget Committee, it said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
