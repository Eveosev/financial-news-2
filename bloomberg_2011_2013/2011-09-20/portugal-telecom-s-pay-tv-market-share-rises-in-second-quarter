Portugal Telecom SGPS SA (PTC) ’s share of
the country’s pay-television market rose in the second quarter
as it snatched clients from its former cable television unit Zon
Multimedia SGPS SA.  Zon’s share declined to 55.8 percent in the second quarter
from 56.7 percent in the previous quarter, Portugal’s
telecommunications regulator said on its  website  today. Portugal
Telecom boosted its share to 32.3 percent from 31.2 percent.
Lisbon-based Zon had 74.3 percent of the market in the second
quarter of 2008.  Portugal Telecom, the country’s biggest phone company,
started its TV service in 2008 to compete with Zon, selling
Internet and phone services alongside TV subscriptions. Portugal
Telecom Chief Executive Officer  Zeinal Bava  has repeatedly said
he wants the company to be the pay-TV market leader.  Cabovisao, owned by  Canada ’s  Cogeco Cable Inc. (CCA) , saw its
market share drop to 9 percent from 9.2 percent. Sonaecom SGPS
SA’s share rose to 1.2 percent from 1.1 percent. The country’s
total number of pay-TV clients rose 1.5 percent from the prior
quarter to 2.85 million.  Zon Multimedia was spun off from Portugal Telecom in
November 2007.  To contact the reporter on this story:
