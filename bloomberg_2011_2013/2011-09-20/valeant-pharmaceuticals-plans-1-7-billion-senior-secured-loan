Valeant Pharmaceuticals
International Inc. (VRX) , a developer of drugs, said it plans to raise
$1.7 billion in a senior secured credit facility to refinance
debt of a subsidiary, according to a company  statement .  The 4 1/2-year debt comprises a $1.5 billion term loan A
which includes a $500 million delayed-draw term loan portion and
a $200 million revolving facility.  The Mississauga, Ontario-based company has a $200 million
revolving line of credit due December 2012 that is fully drawn,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. A $650 million delayed-
draw term loan terminates in December 2011, the data show.  Philip W. Loberg, chief financial officer at Valeant,
didn’t respond to an e-mail seeking comment.  A  term loan  A is sold mainly to banks. In a revolving
credit facility, money can be borrowed once it’s repaid; in a
term loan, it can’t.  To contact the reporter on this story:
