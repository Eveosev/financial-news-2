U.S. gasoline consumption slipped
1.1 percent last week from a year earlier as higher gasoline
prices reduced demand, according to  MasterCard Inc. (MA)   Motorists bought 8.91 million barrels a day in the week
ended Sept. 16, the second-biggest payments network company said
in its SpendingPulse report. That’s down from 9.01 million last
year.  The average pump price fell 4 cents to $3.62 a gallon, and
was 33 percent higher than a year ago.  Averaged over four weeks, gasoline use was 1.9 percent
below a year earlier. It was the 26th week in a row that demand
fell on that basis, according to SpendingPulse data.  “As we move through September and October, gasoline demand
historically tends to be weaker when compared to the summer
months,” John Gamel, director of economic analysis for
SpendingPulse, said in the report. “Prices at the pump continue
to be a major factor.”  Demand rose 4.5 percent from the week ended Sept. 9 as the
East Coast and Gulf Coast regions recovered from tropical
storms, Gamel said.  Fuel consumption peaked this year at 9.56 million barrels
in the week ended July 1 as motorists filled their tanks before
the July 4 holiday weekend.  The report from Purchase, New York-based MasterCard is
assembled by MasterCard Advisors, the company’s consulting arm.
The information is based on credit-card swipes and cash and
check payments at about 140,000 U.S. gasoline stations.  Visa Inc. (V)  is the biggest payments network company by
transactions processed.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
