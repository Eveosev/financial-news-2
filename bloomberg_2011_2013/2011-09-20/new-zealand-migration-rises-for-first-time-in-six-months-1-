More migrants arrived in  New
Zealand  than left for the first time in six months in August,
supporting the case for a second-half recovery in consumption
and the housing market.  Permanent arrivals exceeded departures by 200 last month,
 Statistics New Zealand  said today in Wellington. In the year
ended Aug. 31, arrivals outpaced departures by 2,257, the lowest
level since the 12 months ended October 2001.  The increase ended the longest exodus of migrants in a
decade, spurred by a Feb. 22 earthquake in the South Island city
of Christchurch. A recovery in immigration may help the economy
rebound from the magnitude-6.3 temblor that killed 181 people,
wrecked houses and shut businesses in the nation’s second-
biggest city.  Christchurch residents departing permanently overseas rose
to 4,900 in the March-August period from 3,000 in the same
period last year, the statistics agency said.  Many of those departing go without migration restrictions
to  Australia , a country with five times New Zealand’s population
of 4.4 million people that is little more than three hours away
by aircraft and offers higher average wages.  The number of New Zealanders leaving for Australia rose 49
percent to 42,573 persons in the year ended Aug. 31 from 28,625
in the year through August 2010.  Short-term visitor arrivals rose 4.7 percent from August
last year to 175,909 persons, today’s report showed. Arrivals in
the year ended Aug. 31 fell 0.5 percent.  About 4,400 visitors in August said they came for the Rugby
 World Cup , which the nation is hosting this month and next, the
agency said. About 95,000 foreign fans are forecast to attend
the tournament, bolstering the  tourism industry , which makes up
about 9 percent of the economy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
