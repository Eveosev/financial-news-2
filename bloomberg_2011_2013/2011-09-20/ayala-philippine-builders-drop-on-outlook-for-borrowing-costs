Ayala Land Inc. (ALI)  fell toward a six-
week low, leading declines among Philippine property developers,
on speculation borrowing costs may rise after the yield on the
government’s 91-day and 364-day notes increased from record lows
at an auction yesterday.  Ayala Land, the nation’s biggest builder, decreased 2.5
percent to 15.40 pesos as of 10:21 a.m. in Manila, bound for the
lowest close since Aug. 9.  Robinsons Land Corp. (RLC)  fell 1.8 percent
to 12.30 pesos, poised for the sharpest loss since Sept. 14. The
benchmark Philippine Stock Exchange Index declined 1.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
