Spain ’s antitrust commission said
it’s opening an investigation into  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)  after finding
evidence of practices that could potentially restrict
competition.  The investigation was opened following a complaint,
according to a  statement  released today by the  Comision Nacional
de la Competencia . The CNC said it will make a decision within
18 months.  “We have received the formal notice on the CNC
investigation and will work closely with the authorities on the
issues in hand,” Jesse Verstraete, European spokesman for
Microsoft, said in an e-mailed response to questions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
