Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (TEVA) 
retreated to the lowest level in more than a month after Clal
Finance Brokerage Ltd. lowered the shares to “market perform”
and withdrew the price estimate.  The shares of the world’s largest maker of generic drugs
declined 1.4 percent to 138.30 shekels, the lowest since Aug. 15
at the 4:30 p.m. close in Tel Aviv. Clal had a share-price
estimate of $55 and an “outperform” recommendation.  Teva’s second-half results are expected to “disappoint the
market,” Clal said in an e-mailed report today. The company’s
adjusted full-year earnings are forecast at $4.90 a share by
Clal. That is below the $5.05 a share median estimate of 20
analysts compiled by Bloomberg.  Investors have been “overly optimistic” about the
introduction of a generic version of the Lovenox drug by Teva,
Clal said. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration yesterday
approved closely held Amphastar Pharmaceuticals Inc.’s generic
version of Sanofi’s blood thinner Lovenox.  With Amphastar entering the market for Lovenox, the
earnings per share gain for Teva from introducing the drug would
be 2 cents in the first quarter of the launch, Clal said, down
from 5 cents previously.  To contact the reporter on this story:
