Almost half of Russians say they
have satisfying sex lives, while a full quarter would rather not
talk about it, a survey showed.  Forty-three percent of Russians are either definitely or
probably satisfied, almost four times more than the 11 percent
who expressed possible or certain dissatisfaction, the
independent Moscow-based Levada Center said yesterday on its
 website . Twenty-five percent refused to answer, 15 percent said
they had “no sex lives” and 6 percent said they were unsure.  Wealthy Russians and those younger than 40 were most likely
to report sexual contentment, Levada said. That may be
encouraging to retailers such as Limited Brands Inc.’s lingerie
producer Victoria’s Secret, which reportedly plans to open its
first Russian store in Moscow this month.  Only 16 percent of Levada’s respondents said they had
visited a sex shop at least once, compared with 79 percent who
said they had never stepped foot into an adult-goods store. The
figure rose to 25 percent for younger and wealthier respondents
as well as for those with a higher education, the pollster said.  The survey of 1,600 people was conducted August 19-23 and
had a margin of error of 3.4 percentage points.  Russia is trying to stem a demographic crisis after its
population fell to 142.9 million last year from 148.3 million in
1991, the year the  Soviet Union  collapsed. President  Dmitry Medvedev  has led a push to curb drinking, a major factor in the
country’s high mortality rate, while Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin  said in July the government would boost payments to
mothers with multiple children.  A 2006 poll by Reckitt Benckiser Group Plc’s condom brand
Durex, which  surveyed  26,000 people in 26 countries, found that
42 percent of Russians were satisfied with their sex lives, the
same share as in Brazil,  China  and Switzerland. That compared
with 61 percent in  India , 51 percent in Greece, 36 percent in
Italy and 25 percent in  France .  To contact the reporter on this story:
