The Herald Fund asked a federal
district judge to review a $578 million lawsuit by the
liquidator of Bernard Madoff’s firm, saying it lost more than
$1.1 billion in the Ponzi scheme and should not be bound by a
“retroactive due diligence duty” of brokerage customers to
detect fraud by their broker, according to a court filing today.  Herald was one of several so-called feeder funds created by
 UniCredit SpA (UCG) ’s Bank Austria unit, according to the liquidator,
Irving Picard. Primeo Fund also is trying to move its case out
of  bankruptcy court , where Picard sued the funds demanding
return of money withdrawn from their Madoff accounts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
