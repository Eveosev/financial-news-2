Poland  may remain the biggest net
recipient of European Union funding, which saved the country
from recession two years ago, through 2020, Regional Development
Minister Elzbieta Bienkowska said.  “EU funding was a wonderful panacea during the crisis,”
Bienkowska told a news conference today in Warsaw. “We are
optimistic that we will remain the biggest net recipients in the
period covered by the next budget.”  Poland, a country of 38 million, received most EU  funding 
on a net basis in the 2007-2013 budget, getting 67 billion euros
($97 billion) in aid to iron out differences between richer and
poorer states. EU governments this year began debating the
bloc’s next multiyear budget, with eight member states including
Germany warning last week that European public spending “cannot
be exempt” from national efforts to consolidate government
finances.  Poland, the only EU member to avoid recession in 2009, may
receive as much or slightly more in the next budget, which
covers the 2014-2020 period, Bienkowska said. The former Soviet
satellite state, which joined the bloc in 2004, benefited as EU
funding was channeled into large-scale infrastructure projects.  Aid received so far has added an average 1.5 percentage
points to economic growth each year, the Regional Affairs
Ministry has said. The government forecasts growth of 4 percent
next year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
