The rate at which London-based
banks say they can borrow for three months in dollars rose for
the eighth straight day, reaching the highest level since August
2010.  The  London  interbank offered rate, or Libor, for dollar
loans climbed to 0.35500 percent from 0.35250 percent yesterday,
according to data from the British Bankers’ Association. That’s
the biggest daily increase in a week and the highest rate since
Aug. 16, 2010.  The dollar Libor-OIS spread, a gauge of banks’ reluctance
to lend, was at 29.00 basis points as of 11:53 a.m. in London,
from 28.95 basis points yesterday, the widest on a closing-price
basis since July 27, 2010, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  The TED spread, or the difference between what lenders and
the U.S. government pay to borrow for three months, rose for a
12th day. It widened to 35.50 basis points from 35.25 basis
points yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
