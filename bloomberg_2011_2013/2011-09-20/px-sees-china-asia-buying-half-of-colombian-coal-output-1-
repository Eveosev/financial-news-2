MPX Energia SA (MPXE3) , the mining company
controlled by Brazilian billionaire  Eike Batista , expects to
ship half the coal from its mine being developed in Colombia to
China and other Asian nations.  MPX is seeking to negotiate deals with Asian coal buyers as
well as purchase mine equipment in China, Gustavo Gomes, chief
operating officer for mining and gas, said in Bogota.  “China is the new demand,” Gomes said an interview today.
“The future in Asia is certainly coal.”  Greater fuel consumption by China and India, the world’s
fastest-growing major economies, has helped spur Colombian
producers to move ahead with expansion plans. Colombia is South
America’s largest coal supplier.  China likely will be the “main market” for MPX’s
Colombian unit, and the company also plans to target India and
South Korea, Gomes said. The mine in northern Colombia will
produce 5 million metric tons of coal in 2015 and expand to 35
million tons in 2020.  MPX fell 50 centavos, or 1.3 percent, to close at 37.40
reais in Sao Paulo trading. The stock has climbed 39 percent in
the past year, compared with a 17 percent drop for Brazil’s
benchmark Bovespa index.  MPX will begin output in Colombia as  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) ,
 Anglo American Plc (AAL)  and  Xstrata Plc (XTA)  undertake a $1.3 billion
expansion at their Cerrejon mine. Output at Cerrejon, Colombia’s
largest mine, will rise to 37 million tons in 2014, before
reaching a target of 40 million tons in 2017, unit Chief
Executive Officer Leon Teicher said last month. That’s up from
about 32.5 million tons this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
