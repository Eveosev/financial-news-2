Emerging-market stocks offer better
returns and less risk than those of companies in advanced
economies, said Burton Malkiel, a professor emeritus of
economics at  Princeton University .  Writing in the Financial Times, Malkiel said debt levels,
demographic trends and resource availability all point in that
direction.  G20 countries had a debt-to-GDP ratio of more than 100
percent last year and that’s likely to rise to more than 125
percent by 2015; by contrast, public debt is less than a third
of GDP in emerging markets and is set to fall to a quarter by
2015, he said.  The ratio of retired people to workers is rising sharply in
the developed world and by 2025  Japan  will have as many retirees
as employed people, with Italy, Germany and France not far
behind; yet in Brazil and southeast  Asia , the dependency ratio
will stay low, in India it will fall and even in  China  it will
probably be less than 30 percent, Malkiel said.  Finally, the world is rapidly using up its finite supplies
of hydrocarbons, metals, land and water, so that commodity
prices can be expected to rise; that means there will be
excellent long-term investment opportunities in emerging
countries that still have abundant natural resources, he said.  An examination of most equity portfolios would show that
most are underweighted in respect of the world’s most dynamic
growth economies, Malkiel concluded.  To contact the reporter on this story:
