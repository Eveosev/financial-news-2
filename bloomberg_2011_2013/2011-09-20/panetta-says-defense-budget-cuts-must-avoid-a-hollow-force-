 U.S. Defense Secretary  Leon
Panetta  said automatic budget cuts of about $500 billion over a
decade would lead to a “hollow force.”  The cuts, triggered if Congress fails to approve a deficit
reduction package, would be required “across the board” on all
defense programs and would weaken the military, Panetta said at
a Pentagon news conference.  He said the Pentagon is working to reduce its budget with a
“balanced approach” that leads to a “smaller, more agile and
more flexible force.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
