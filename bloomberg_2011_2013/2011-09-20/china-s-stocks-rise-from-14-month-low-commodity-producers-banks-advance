China ’s stocks rose, with the
benchmark index climbing from a 14-month low, as investors
speculated recent declines were excessive.  PetroChina Co. rebounded from a record low and Bank of
China Ltd. advanced from its lowest close since January 2009.
Anhui Conch Cement Co. paced gains for building material
producers after Premier  Wen Jiabao  said China will continue to
promote the construction of public rental housing.  The Shanghai Composite Index, which tracks the bigger of
China’s stock exchanges, advanced 10.01, or 0.4 percent, to
2,447.80 at the 11:30 a.m. local-time break, reversing an
earlier 0.5 percent loss. The measure closed yesterday at its
lowest level since July 16, 2010. The CSI 300 Index added 0.3
percent to 2,687.41 today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
