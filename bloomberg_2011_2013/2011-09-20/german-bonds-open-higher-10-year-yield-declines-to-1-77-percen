Italian government bonds fell for a
second day after  Standard & Poor’s  cut the country’s debt rating
and as  Greece  prepared for further talks with its main creditors
to avoid a default.  German two-year notes, perceived to be among Europe’s
safest debt securities, yielded less than 0.5 percent for a
second day. Italian debt declined even as the  European Central
Bank  was said to be buying the securities. S&P cut  Italy ’s
rating yesterday to A from A+, saying slower growth and a
“fragile” government may derail its ability to reduce its debt
burden.  Portugal ’s 10-year yield rose by the most in two weeks.  “It’s the downgrade of Italy and the latest, or no, news
from Greece” that’s driving bond markets, said Christian Reicherter, an analyst at DZ Bank AG in  Frankfurt . “Everybody
is looking at what’s going on with Greece.”  The Italian 10-year yield rose 11 basis points to 5.70
percent at 4:35 p.m. in London. The 4.75 security due in
September 2021 fell 0.80, or 8 euros per 1,000-euro ($1,371)
face amount, to 93.42.  Two-year yields also climbed 11 basis points, to 4.30
percent. Portugal’s 10-year yield increased 41 basis points to
11.66 percent, the biggest increase since Sept. 5 when it jumped
as much as 51 basis points.  Ten-year German bund yields were little changed at 1.79
percent, after being as low as 1.73 percent. The yield fell to a
record low 1.68 percent on Sept. 13. Two-year notes yielded 0.46
percent.  Spread Widens  Gains in bunds were limited as the Stoxx  Europe  600 Index
rose 1.8 percent, rebounding from a 2.3 percent drop yesterday
and sapping demand for German debt securities as a haven.  The extra yield, or spread, that investors demand to hold
Italian 10-year bonds instead of similar-maturity German bunds
widened to 391 basis points.  The ECB bought Italian bonds today, according to five
people with knowledge of the transactions, who asked not to be
identified because the deals are confidential. A spokeswoman for
the central bank declined to comment.  S&P’s decision is “not positive news for Italy, which is
struggling to attract investor demand for its government
bonds,” Alessandro Giansanti, a senior strategist at ING Groep
NV in Amsterdam, wrote today in a note to clients. “We expect
further widening of Italian spreads.”  Greek Coupon Payments  Greece made its two bond coupon payments today, said a
ministry source who declined to be identified. The country was
due to make 769 million euros of interest payments, Giansanti
said in a telephone interview yesterday.  Dutch  government bonds , which have the highest AAA rating,
were little changed, after gains that earlier pushed the 10-year
yield down six basis points to 2.20 percent, the lowest since
Sept. 13. The yield was at 2.25 percent.  Danish 10-year yields stayed near a record low after the
country sold securities. The yield was little changed at 2.02
percent, after dropping on Sept. 13 to 1.89 percent, the lowest
since at least January 1993, when Bloomberg started collecting
the data. Volatility on the nation’s debt was 0.6 times more
than the 90-day average, according to moves in the 10-year note,
two- 10-year yield spread and credit-default swaps, Bloomberg
data show. Denmark is not part of the euro area.  Greek Call  Greek Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos is scheduled to
hold a conference call with the heads of the European Union, ECB
and International Monetary Fund mission to  Athens  at 8 p.m.
local time. The parties had “substantive” discussions
yesterday, the  finance ministry  said in a statement.  Greece’s Prime Minister  George Papandreou  isn’t considering
holding a referendum on whether to exit the euro, government
spokesman Ilias Mosialos said, denying a report in the
Kathimerini newspaper.  Greek two-year notes dropped for a second day with the
yield climbing 280 basis points to 64.18 percent. The yield
climbed to a record 84.52 percent on Sept. 14.  Spanish securities slipped after the nation sold 4.46
billion euros of 12-month and 18-month bills. The 10-year yield
rose three basis point to 5.38 percent.  The Treasury sold 3.59 billion euros of 12-month bills at
an average yield of 3.591 percent, compared with 3.335 percent
in an Aug. 16 auction. It also issued 18-month debt at 3.807
percent, up from 3.592 percent in August. Demand for the 12-
month bills was 2.78 times the amount sold, up from 2.14 times,
with the 18-month debt attracting bids of 2.74 times from 3.23.  German government bonds have returned 2.7 percent in
September, extending this year’s gain to 8.1 percent, according
to indexes compiled by the European Federation of Financial
Analysts Societies and Bloomberg. Treasuries gained 1.4 percent
this month while Greek bonds have tumbled 22 percent.  -- With assistance from Maria Petrakis and Natalie Weeks in
