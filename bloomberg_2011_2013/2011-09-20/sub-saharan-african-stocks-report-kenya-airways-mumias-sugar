by market value, rose for the first time in four days, gaining 2
naira, or 2 percent, to 100 naira. The company signed an
agreement to build a $115 million plant in Cameroon to produce
the building material, it said today in an e-mailed statement.  Fidson Healthcare Plc (FIDSON)  , a Nigerian
pharmaceutical maker, gained for a second day, rising 6 kobo, or
4.1 percent, to 1.54 naira. Second-quarter profit was expected
to reach 179.4 million naira ($1 million), the company said in a
statement e-mailed by the Nigerian Stock Exchange.  Kenya Airways Ltd. (KNAL)  , sub-Saharan Africa’s third-
largest carrier, declined to its lowest in more than a week,
dropping 75 cents, or 2.5 percent, to 29.5 shillings. The
airline will seek shareholder approval to double its share
capital to 10 billion shillings ($104 million) at an annual
general meeting on Oct. 14, it said in a statement e-mailed by
the  Nairobi Stock Exchange  today.       Mumias Sugar Co. (MSUG KN),  Kenya ’s biggest producer of the
sweetener, advanced 5 cents, or 0.8 percent, to 6.4 shillings,
paring yesterday’s 1.6 percent drop. Kenyan retail sugar prices
have more than doubled to 200 shillings a kilogram in three
months due to a sugar shortage in the country, Chief Executive
Officer Evans Kidero said. A sugar shortage in Kenya, where
imports of the sweetener from other African nations account for
about a third of consumption, may persist for another year until
new cane crops enter the market, he said.  Transnational Corp. of Nigeria Plc (TRANSCOR NL), which has
interests in hotels, agriculture and oil, rose the most in more
than five months, gaining 4 kobo, or 4.9 percent, to 86 kobo.
The group said it appointed Manz Denga as its chief executive
officer following the resignation of Nicholas Okoro last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
