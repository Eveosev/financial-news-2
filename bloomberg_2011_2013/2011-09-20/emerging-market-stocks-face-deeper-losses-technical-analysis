Emerging-market stocks may extend
declines because their relative strength chart against U.S.
equities is sending a bearish signal as funds boost holdings in
 developing countries , according to Bank of America Corp.  The ratio of the MSCI Emerging Markets Index versus the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index peaked at 0.96 in October and stayed
mostly below 0.90 in 2009 and this year, forming a “head and
shoulders” pattern that would indicate a reversal of a bullish
trend, according to data from Bloomberg and Bank of America.
While emerging markets trailed so far this month, the net
proportion of fund managers holding more stocks in those
countries than suggested by benchmark indexes rose to 30 percent
from 27 percent in August, a Bank of America survey found.  “The risk is that the consensus is wrong and EM is
vulnerable to a deeper selloff,” Mary Ann Bartels, ranked third
among analysts who study price charts in Institutional
Investor’s 2010 survey, wrote in a note to clients yesterday.  The emerging markets index has slumped 21 percent since its
2011 high in May on concern  Europe ’s debt crisis and a U.S.
slowdown will drag the global economy into a recession. The 21-
country benchmark has fallen 8.1 percent this month, compared
with a 1.2 percent retreat in the  S&P 500 .  The price ratio between the Emerging Markets Index and the
U.S. benchmark sank to 0.52 in October 2008 amid the financial
crisis and advanced to a 16-year high in 2010, according to
Bloomberg data. A rising ratio shows emerging markets are
outperforming.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns to forecast changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
