Equatorial Guinea  will maintain
exports of its Zafiro crude at four cargoes in November,
according to a loading program obtained by Bloomberg News.  The west African nation will also export two cargoes of its
Ceiba blend, one less than October, a separate shipping schedule
showed. The shipments are of 1 million barrels each. Exxon Mobil
Corp. operates the Zafiro field and Hess Corp. runs Ceiba.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
