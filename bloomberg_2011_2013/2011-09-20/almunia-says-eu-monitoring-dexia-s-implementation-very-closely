Commissioner  Joaquin Almunia  said the EU is monitoring “very
closely”  Dexia SA (DEXB) ’s implementation of its asset-reduction plan.  Dexia, which received a 6 billion-euro bailout from France
and Belgium in 2008, last year obtained EU approval for the
taxpayer-funded rescue with requirements including selling
assets in Italy and  Spain .  “As regards the French banks right now, surveillance,
monitoring is being carried out only on Dexia,” Almunia said at
a press conference today in Brussels. “It’s not a 100 percent
French bank, it’s Franco-Belgian. And there it is known that
it’s not easy to apply it in that case. But we do monitor very
closely the implementation of the decision in respect of them,”
he said.  Dexia, which is based in Paris and Brussels, last month
posted the largest quarterly loss in its history because of
provisions to sell assets and a writedown of Greek debt.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
