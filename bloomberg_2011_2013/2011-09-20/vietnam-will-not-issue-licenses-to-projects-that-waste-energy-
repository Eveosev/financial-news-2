Vietnam  says it will not issue
licenses to foreign-invested projects that “waste energy”, use
outdated technology or pollute the environment, according to a
statement posted on the government website today.  The government will give licensing preference to high-
technology projects and ones that are “friendly to the
environment,” the statement said.  Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung has ordered ministries and
provinces to step-up monitoring of projects to ensure they meet
the guidelines, according to the statement.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
