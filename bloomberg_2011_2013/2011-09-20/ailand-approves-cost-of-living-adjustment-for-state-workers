Thailand â€™s Cabinet approved a
temporary adjustment in wages for state employees to help them
cope with rising living costs, said Anuttama Amornvivat, a
deputy spokeswoman.  The measure, which will be effective on Jan. 1, will cost
the government about 18.4 billion baht in the fiscal year
starting Oct. 1, Anuttama said after a Cabinet meeting in
Bangkok today.  The Cabinet also assigned the Office of  Civil Service
Commission  to further study a change in salary structure for
government officials, she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
