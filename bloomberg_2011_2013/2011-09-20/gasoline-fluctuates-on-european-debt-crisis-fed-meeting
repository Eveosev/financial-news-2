Gasoline advanced on speculation
that the European debt crisis may ease and that the  Federal
Reserve  tomorrow may announce another round of economic stimulus
measures.  Futures gained as Greece described its debt talks as
“productive,” reducing concern that the fiscal crisis will
weaken the region’s economy. The Federal Reserve Open Market
Committee completes a two-day meeting tomorrow.  “We’re hopeful that Europe will lend Greece more money,”
said  Andy Lipow , president of Lipow Oil Associates LLC in
Houston. “We looking for signs the Fed will act to help the
economy. But there’s plenty of concern out there.”  Gasoline for October delivery increased 0.49 cent to settle
at $2.7014 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .  Federal Reserve officials tomorrow will probably announce a
program for monetary easing that will do little to help 14
million unemployed Americans find work, according to economists
in a Bloomberg News survey.  “We’re also being helped by the stock market being up on
the hopes of more stimulus,” said  Phil Flynn , vice president of
research at PFGBest in Chicago.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 index rose 0.9 percent at 2:37
p.m. in  New York .  Heating oil for October delivery gained 1.69 cents, or 0.6
percent, to $2.9616 a gallon on the exchange.  Regular gasoline at the pump, averaged nationwide, declined
0.8 cent to $3.58 a gallon yesterday, according to AAA data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
