Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ)  lost a
bid to throw out claims in a lawsuit accusing it of defrauding
creditors of Idearc Inc. when it spun off the directory business
in 2006, a judge ruled.  U.S. District Judge A. Joe Fish in  Dallas  denied Verizon’s
request to dismiss claims that the telecommunications company
intended to “hinder, delay or defraud” creditors and that it
aided and abetted breach of fiduciary duty, according to a
decision filed yesterday.  “These detailed and particularized allegations show that
Verizon had a motive and opportunity to commit the alleged
actual fraudulent transfers, and they permit the court to draw a
reasonable inference of Verizon’s intent,” Fish wrote.  As a result of the spinoff, Verizon received $9.5 billion
in assets from Idearc and Idearc was left insolvent,  U.S. Bank 
NA, the trustee for a litigation trust for Idearc creditors,
said in a lawsuit last year. Idearc filed for bankruptcy in
2009.  Robert Varettoni, a Verizon spokesman, declined to comment
on the ruling. The company didn’t ask the judge to dismiss the
whole complaint, he said in an e-mail.  Fish ruled that U.S. Bank can’t sue for punitive damages
against Verizon on the claim of aiding and abetting breach of
fiduciary duty, according to the decision.  The case is U.S. Bank National Association v. Verizon
Communications Inc., 10-01842, U.S. District Court, Northern
District of  Texas  (Dallas).  To contact the reporter on this story:
