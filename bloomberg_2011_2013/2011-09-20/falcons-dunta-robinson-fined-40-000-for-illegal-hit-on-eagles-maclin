Atlanta Falcons defensive back
Dunta Robinson was fined $40,000 for his second helmet-to-helmet
hit on a Philadelphia Eagles receiver in 11 months.  Robinson was punished yesterday by the  National Football
League  for his blow to the head of Jeremy Maclin that was
similar to a hit last October that left DeSean Jackson with a
concussion.  Robinson, who was fined $25,000 for unnecessary roughness
for the hit on Jackson in October, leveled Maclin in the third
quarter of a game two nights ago in Atlanta.  “Robinson lowered his head and made forcible contact to
the head and neck area,” the NFL said in a statement.
“Although Maclin completed the catch, he was still a
defenseless player under the rules because he did not have time
to protect himself and had not clearly become a runner.”  Robinson told reporters in the locker room after the game
that “I didn’t think it was an illegal or dirty hit.”  “I saw a guy catch the ball and I saw him turn upfield,
and it’s my job to get him on the ground,” Robinson said.
“This is a physical game. It’s a rough game and you play until
the whistle blows.”  Maclin, who missed most of training camp because of an
undiagnosed illness that caused him to lose weight and feel
tired starting in February, returned to the game and finished
with 13 receptions for 171 yards and two touchdowns.  “He’s two for two now,” Maclin told reporters after the
game. “Fortunately, it wasn’t as bad as Jack’s was last year.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
