Azrieli Group (AZRG)  Ltd. said that an
Israeli court has ordered a government price panel to review
the gasoline marketing margin after it gets additional data,
according to a statement to the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange today.
The court ruled that until then, the maximum margin set by the
panel will stand, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
