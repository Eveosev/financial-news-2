Following is the text of
 Canada 's leading indicators report from  Statistics Canada .  The composite leading index was little changed in
August for the third month in a row. Of the 10 components,
6 continued to expand in August, the same number as in
July. The weakness in the index was concentrated in the
housing index and the stock market, both of which fell
more than the month before. The unsmoothed version of the
index showed a slight improvement, with a 0.6% increase in
August matching its gain in July as a recovery of
manufacturing from supply disruptions in the second
quarter outweighed losses in the stock market and in
housing.  Most of the 0.7% drop in the housing index originated
in lower existing home sales. Housing starts levelled off,
after recovering over the previous five months. Furniture
and appliance sales remained robust, rising 1.1%. Spending
on other durable goods rose 1.6%, its largest monthly
increase during the recovery, partly as shortages of
Japanese models began to ease.  Manufacturing remained mixed. New orders rose 3.4% for
a second straight month, as manufacturers began to recover
from a series of supply disruptions in autos, petroleum
and metal refining that had hampered second-quarter
output. However, the trend of shipments has not yet begun
to recover, and the ratio of sales to stocks fell for a
third straight month. The average workweek continued to
fall, although factory employment has been stable in
recent months. This partly reflects a decision by firms to
keep their workers on staff during the supply disruptions,
but at reduced hours.  To contact the reporter on this story:
