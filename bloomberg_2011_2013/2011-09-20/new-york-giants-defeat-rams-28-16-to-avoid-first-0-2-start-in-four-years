Eli Manning threw two touchdown
passes as the  New York  Giants beat the St. Louis Rams 28-16 to
avoid their first 0-2 start since 2007.  Michael Boley had a 65-yard fumble return for a score and
 Brandon Jacobs  added a nine-yard touchdown run for the Giants
last night at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford,  New Jersey .  Manning improved to 3-0 against the Rams in his National
Football League career, with nine touchdown passes and one
interception. The Giants rebounded from last week’s season-
opening loss to the  Washington Redskins  and have now won their
past five meetings with the Rams.  New York improved to 1-1, while the Rams are 0-2 to start
the season for the fifth straight year.  “We hung in there, we hit a couple big plays and made
enough plays to win the game,” Manning, who completed 18 of 29
passes for 200 yards, said in a televised on-field interview.  After Josh Brown kicked the first of his three field goals
to give the Rams a 3-0 lead, Hakeem Nicks caught a 3-yard
touchdown pass from Manning with 5:47 left in the first quarter
to put the Giants in front for good.  Boley, a seventh-year linebacker, scooped up a botched
lateral by Rams quarterback  Sam Bradford  about four minutes into
the second quarter and raced 65 yards to give the Giants a 14-6
lead. Manning then tossed a 22-yard scoring pass to Domenik Hixon with 21 seconds left in the first half.  “When you score on defense, that’s a huge play,” Giants
coach  Tom Coughlin  said at a news conference.  Jacobs added his third-quarter touchdown run to cap a drive
in which the Rams had two penalties for 32 yards, including a
pass-interference call on third down.  The Rams’ lone touchdown came as Bradford, who passed for
331 yards, tossed a 19-yard scoring pass to Danario Alexander
with 1:18 left in the third quarter. The Rams played without
running back Steven Jackson and leading receiver Danny Amendola.  The Giants, who play the rival Eagles next week, lost
receiver  Mario Manningham  to a concussion in the second quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
