European Central Bank Governing
Council member Ewald Nowotny said there’s not much more the ECB
can do to curtail the impact of the region’s sovereign-debt
crisis, the Wall Street Journal reported.  “I do not think there are many possibilities for further
specific actions,” Nowotny told the newspaper in an interview
published today. The Frankfurt-based ECB should scale back its
bond purchases “the sooner the better,” Nowotny was quoted as
saying.  Concerns about the strength of the German economy are
“overdone,” Nowotny said, adding that he doesn’t expect a
double-dip recession in the euro region.  To contact the reporter on this story:
