The number of liquefied natural gas
tankers on order has more than doubled after rates to charter
the vessels soared because of demand for the fuel, according to
the LNG unit of Braemar Seascope Ltd.  Rates to ship spot, or short-term, supplies of the fuel
have climbed to around $90,000 a day this month from about
$40,000 a year ago, prompting new vessel orders to reach 71
compared with 32 a year earlier, Debbie Turner, director of
London-based BS Energy Services Ltd., said at the World LNG
Series Asia Pacific Summit in  Singapore  today.  Freight rates have advanced as Qatar sought smaller and
more flexible vessels to ship to smaller ports, while  Japan ’s
LNG demand has increased after the March 11 earthquake and
tsunami shut nuclear plants, Turner said.  Of the 71 vessels on order, 21 remain without long-term
charters in place, Turner said. The spot freight market may be
“pretty tight” until 2013 after which new deliveries may ease
the shortfall, she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
