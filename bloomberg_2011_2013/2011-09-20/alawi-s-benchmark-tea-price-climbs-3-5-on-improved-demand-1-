The benchmark price of tea in
Malawi,  Africa ’s second-largest producer of the crop after
 Kenya , rose 3.5 percent on improved demand for the leaf,
according to Tea Brokers Central Africa, which manages the
nation’s tea auctions.  The top-grade tea, known as pekoe fannings, fetched $2.69 a
kilogram (2.2 pounds) at a sale today in the commercial capital,
Blantyre, up from $2.60 two weeks ago, the broker said in an e-
mailed report today.  “There was strong competition for top-grade tea,” Tea
Brokers said in the report. “The secondary tea was also dearer
by 10 to 15 cents, and sometimes more.”  The sale fetched $34,342 from 19,640 kilograms of leaf
sold, compared with $56,297 earned two weeks ago from 38,840
kilograms, Tea Brokers said. There was no auction last week
because farmers didn’t provide sufficient supplies.  Tea is  Malawi ’s second-largest foreign exchange earner
after tobacco, generating 8 percent of total export earnings.
The U.K. is typically the largest buyer of the nation’s tea.  To contact the reporter on this story:
