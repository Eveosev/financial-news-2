EON AG and  RWE AG (RWE)  are potential
“recovery option” stocks should European governments find a
solution to the sovereign debt crisis, according to analysts at
 UniCredit SpA. (UCG)   “Political risk, at least in northern  Europe , has
peaked,” analysts including Lueder Schumacher and Javier Suarez
wrote in a note to investors today. “As balance sheet capacity
is being exhausted, politicians will be forced to look elsewhere
for revenues, tempting as extra taxes on the sector may be.”  European government intervention has cut 200 billion euros
($273 billion) from utility shares since January 2009, according
to Citigroup Inc. It’s no coincidence that RWE and EON,
Germany’s two largest utilities, and France’s Veolia SA have
seen the biggest adjustments to dividend expectations and are
the worst-performing stocks in the industry, UniCredit said.  Fortum OYJ (FUM1V) ,  GDF Suez (GSZ)  SA and  International Power Plc (IPR)  are
UniCredit’s top picks even against a background of falling power
prices, the analysts said. EON and RWE have “little upside”
under UniCredit’s base scenario, though offer “geared
exposure” if a solution to the crisis is found.  German power prices for next year may fall toward 52.80
euros a megawatt-hour, about four euros below current levels,
according to UniCredit. That would push so-called clean dark
spreads, a measure of coal-fed power station profitability, to
zero, the report said.  Baseload power for 2012 has fallen 2.2 percent this month
to 57.50 euros a megawatt-hour, broker data on Bloomberg shows.  To contact the reporter on this story:
