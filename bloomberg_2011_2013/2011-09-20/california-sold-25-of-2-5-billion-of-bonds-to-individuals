California  took orders from
individual investors for 25 percent of its $2.54 billion in
general-obligation bonds, the first such issue in 10 months.  The most-populous state concluded the so-called retail
phase of its offering with $640.2 million in orders in two days,
said  Tom Dresslar , a spokesman for Treasurer Bill Lockyer, in an
e-mail.  California, the biggest U.S. municipal debt issuer,
voluntarily suspended sales earlier this year to curb costs as
the state battled to close a $26 billion deficit. The securities
offered individual investors a 3.17 percent yield on 10-year
debt and 4.8 percent on 30-year bonds, Dresslar said.  Lockyerâ€™s office will set final prices on the bonds today
after taking orders from institutional buyers, Dresslar said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
