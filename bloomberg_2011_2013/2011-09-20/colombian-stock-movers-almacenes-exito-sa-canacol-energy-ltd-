company  with fields in the South American country, fell 2.6
percent to 1,495 pesos, the lowest level since the stock began
trading in July 2010. The company may be hitting new lows
because the market is waiting for news on its exploration
projects in the Caguan-Putumayo basin, said Juan David Pineros,
an oil sector analyst for Interbolsa SA, Colombia’s biggest
brokerage.  The company plans to release new information in the first
week in October, Carolina Orozco, head of  investor relations  for
Canacol in Colombia, said Sept. 14.  To contact the reporter on this story:
