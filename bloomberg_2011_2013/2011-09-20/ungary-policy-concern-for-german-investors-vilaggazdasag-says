Hungarian government policies are
stoking the concerns of German investors in the country,
 Vilaggazdasag  reported, citing the German-Hungarian Chamber of
Commerce.  A statement by the chamber said it was “distressing” that
the latest government policies and plans cast doubts on the
“credibility” of Hungarian economic policy and “confidence in
the rule of law may be shaken,” the newspaper said.  German companies are the largest foreign investors in
 Hungary , Vilaggazdasag said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
