China  Southern Airlines Co.
President Tan Wangeng comments on the carrier’s plans for its
five on-order Airbus SAS A380 planes. He spoke today at a media
briefing in Beijing.  The airline is due to receive its first double-deck A380 on
Oct. 15, it said. The plane will be used on domestic flights
from Oct. 17 to Oct. 29 before being moved onto international
routes, it said. The carrier didn’t announce the overseas routes.  “The arrival of A380 is not only a milestone for China
Southern, it is also a milestone in China’s civil aviation
history.  “China southern is confident that we will have good
operations with the A380. We will improve our services, boost
our brand image and accelerate internationalization with the
A380.”  --Jasmine Wang. Editors: Neil Denslow, Subramaniam Sharma  To contact the reporter on this story:
