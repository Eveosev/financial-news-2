Brazil ’s government is still
seeking to reduce royalties on oil production to 20 percent from
30 percent, Deputy Finance Minister Nelson Barbosa said.  The Finance and the Energy ministries presented a proposal
for the division of oil royalties in a meeting this week,
Barbosa told reporters today in Brasilia. The government is
opposed to changing a special participation tax on companies’
concessions that have already been awarded, he said.   To contact the reporter on this story:
