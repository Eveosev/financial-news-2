Japan  is seeking to buy 96,624
metric tons of milling wheat from the U.S.,  Canada  and  Australia 
in a regular tender on Sept. 22, the smallest volume in two
weeks, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries said.  Shipment is set from Nov. 1 to Nov. 30, Masafumi Otsuka at
the ministry’s grain-trade division said today by phone. The
volume sought is the lowest since Sept. 8, when the government
bought 86,471 tons.  The ministry, which controls overseas purchases and
domestic sales of wheat to stabilize supply, is  Asia ’s largest
buyer as a single entity. It has bought 2.42 million tons
through regular tenders this fiscal year, compared with 5.16
million tons purchased in the year ended March 31.  Details of this week’s tender are listed below:  To contact the reporter on this story:
