Greek Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos said  Greece ’s membership of the euro area was an
“irreversible and fundamental national choice which the Greek
people protect with their sacrifices.”  “We acknowledge our fiscal data and economic structures
are a problem for the euro area which we are determined to
tackle once and for all with the implementation of our program
and by meeting our obligations,” Venizelos said in an e-mailed
statement from the Athens-based Finance Ministry today.  Venizelos commented after a news report the government
planned to hold a referendum on membership of the euro.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
