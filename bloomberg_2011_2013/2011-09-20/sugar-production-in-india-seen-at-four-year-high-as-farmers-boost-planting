Sugar output in  India , the second-
biggest producer, may surge to the highest level in four years
after farmers boosted planting, potentially increasing exports.  Production may total 25.83 million metric tons in the year
starting Oct. 1, according to a compilation of estimates by
sugar cane commissioners of 10 states including  Uttar Pradesh 
and Maharashtra, the biggest growers. That compares with 26
million tons forecast by the Indian Sugar Mills Association and
24.2 million tons estimated this year.  Rising production may prompt the government to lift curbs
on exports, helping ease a shortage caused by a decline in
supplies from  Brazil , the biggest producer and shipper. Futures
have declined 17 percent this year on expectations of increased
production from  Thailand ,  Russia  and European Union.  “India will be in a better position to export sugar in a
sizable quantity as supplies increase,” Yatin Wadhwana,
managing director of Sucden India Pvt., said by phone today.  The government may announce the first production estimate
for the 2011-2012 season after a meeting of cane officials from
states today, according to Food Secretary B.C. Gupta.  Uttar Pradesh, India’s largest cane grower, may process 70
million tons of cane to make 6.45 million tons of sugar, said
Kamran Rizvi, the state’s sugar cane commissioner. Maharashtra,
the biggest sweetener producer, may make 9.3 million tons,
according to Anil Bansode, the state’s joint director for sugar.  Farmers nationwide planted sugar cane on 5.08 million
hectares (12.6 million acres), up 3 percent from a year ago,
according to the farm ministry. Cane production may climb to
342.2 million tons in 2011-2012 from 339.17 million tons a year
earlier, Farm Minister  Sharad Pawar  said Sept. 14.  The government plans to announce its policy on exports by
Oct. 15 and the nation may allow shipments of more than 500,000
tons in one tranche, Pawar said yesterday.  India allowed mills to export 2.6 million tons of sugar
since the start of the season on Oct. 1. Shipments next year may
be as much as 4 million tons, according to six producers and
traders in a Bloomberg News survey July 29.  To contact the reporters on this story:
