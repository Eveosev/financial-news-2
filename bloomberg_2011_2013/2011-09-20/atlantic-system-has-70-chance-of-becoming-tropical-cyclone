A low-pressure system in the
Atlantic moving toward the Windward Islands has a 70 percent
chance of developing into a tropical cyclone, the National
Hurricane Center said.  The system, about 1,500 miles (2,400 kilometers) east of
the Windward Islands, is moving west at 5 to 10 mph, the Miami-
based NHC said today in a website advisory. Environmental
conditions show a tropical depression may form in the next
couple days, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
