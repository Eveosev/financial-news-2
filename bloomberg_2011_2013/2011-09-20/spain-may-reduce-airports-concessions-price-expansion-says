Spain ’s Ministry of Transport and
Public works is considering lowering the price of the
concessions to run its  Madrid  and Barcelona airports,  Expansion 
reported, citing unidentified people with knowledge of the
matter.  Bidders were originally asked to provide an initial payment
of 3.7 billion euros ($5 billion) for the contract to run
Madrid’s Barajas airport, 1.6 billion euros for Barcelona’s El
Prat and cede 20 percent of the airports’ annual income to the
government, the newspaper said.  The Ministry may make conditions more flexible, given the
large quantity of money involved and the current credit drought,
the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
