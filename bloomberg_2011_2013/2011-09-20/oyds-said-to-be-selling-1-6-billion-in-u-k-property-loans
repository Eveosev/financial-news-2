Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY)  plans to
sell 1 billion pounds ($1.6 billion) of U.K. commercial property
loans, two people familiar with the matter said.  JPMorgan Cazenove is handling the sale and has sent a
prospectus to potential bidders, according to the people, who
declined to be identified because the information isn’t public.
Emile Abu-Shakra, a spokesman for Lloyds, declined to comment. A
JPMorgan spokesman wasn’t immediately available to comment.  Lloyds is trying to sell assets including property loans as
it cleans up its balance sheet following a U.K. government
bailout. The state is the bank’s largest shareholder with a
stake of about 40 percent.  The Financial Times reported the planned sale earlier
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
