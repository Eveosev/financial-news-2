Greek subway, bus, trolley and tram
workers will halt services in  Athens  on Sept. 22 as part of a
public transportation strike to oppose government plans to
reduce the public sector, state-run Athens News Agency said.  Taxi drivers may join the strike to voice opposition to
government plans to open the profession and unions representing
all other public transport will meet to decide on any further
action, ANA reported, without saying where it got the
