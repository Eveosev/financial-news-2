European Union regulators approved
 Germany ’s 30 billion-euro ($41 billion) bailout package for HSH
Nordbank AG, a regional lender that nearly collapsed following
the 2008 global financial crisis.  The deal includes 3 billion euros in cash, 17 billion euros
of liquidity guarantees and a “risk shield” of 10 billion
euros from the German regions of Hamburg and Schleswig-Holstein,
whose governments own more than 85 percent of the bank, the
European Commission said today in a statement.  The deal requires the bank to reduce its balance sheet by
61 percent by winding down its aircraft-financing division and
reducing its shipping financing, according to the statement. The
lender must also pay 500 million euros in shares as part of its
repayment for the risk shield, the EU said.  “The restructuring plan will profoundly change HSH
Nordbank’s business model, creating the conditions for a more
viable bank in the long-term,” EU Competition Commissioner
 Joaquin Almunia  said in the statement.  The European Commission, the European Union’s executive arm
in Brussels, is examining the restructuring measures of lenders
that needed state aid during the financial crisis including
 Bayerische Landesbank , Hypo Real Estate Holding AG, WestLB AG
and HSH Nordbank. Almunia said in July that the “final
problems” related to the probe had been addressed.  The payment in shares ensures that “minority shareholders
bear a fair share of the restructuring costs,” according to the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
