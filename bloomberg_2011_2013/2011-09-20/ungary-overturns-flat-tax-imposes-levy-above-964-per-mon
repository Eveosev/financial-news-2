Hungary will raise taxes on gross
monthly incomes above 202,000 forint ($964) a month, overturning
a flat 16 percent personal income tax rate Prime Minister  Viktor
Orban  introduced this year.  The government is imposing a “temporary contribution” on
higher earners in order to compensate those who end up earning
less because of the flat tax, the  Economy Ministry  said in an e-
mailed statement today. The tax will be in effect as long as the
16 percent flat tax rate leaves people worse off.  The ministry didn’t say how much the levy would be. The
extra tax will apply to income above the 202,000 forint
threshold.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
