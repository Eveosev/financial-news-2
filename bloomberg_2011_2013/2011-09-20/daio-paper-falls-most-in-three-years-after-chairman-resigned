Daio Paper Corp. (3880)  dropped the most
in about three years in Tokyo trading after the company said
Chairman Mototaka Ikawa resigned.   The Japanese paper manufacturer fell as much as 9.7 percent
to 643 yen on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the biggest drop since
Oct. 8, 2008. The shares traded 8.2 percent lower at 654 yen as
of 9:35 a.m.  The company said last week Ikawa stepped down because of
problems caused by money he borrowed from an affiliate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
