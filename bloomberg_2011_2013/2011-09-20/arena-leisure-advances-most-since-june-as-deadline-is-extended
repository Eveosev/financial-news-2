Arena Leisure Plc (ARE)  rose the most in
almost three months in London trading after the U.K. racecourse
owner said a deadline for disclosing the identity of a possible
bidder for the company was extended.  The shares rose 4 pence, or 13 percent, to 35 pence at
10:16 a.m., the biggest gain since June 23 when they jumped 14
percent after the London-based company said it was reviewing
options to increase  shareholder value , including a possible
offer for Arena. The surge extended this year’s advance to 32
percent, lifting its market value to almost 128 million pounds
($200 million).  The U.K. Takeover Panel exempted Arena Leisure from today’s
deadline to disclose the identity of any possible bidder, Arena
said in a statement today. New rules regarding disclosure came
into force today, which require disclosure of any potential
bidder if an approach has been made and gives it 28 days to make
an offer.  “There can be no certainty that an offer will be made for
the company nor as to the terms on which any offer may be
made,” according to Arena’s statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
