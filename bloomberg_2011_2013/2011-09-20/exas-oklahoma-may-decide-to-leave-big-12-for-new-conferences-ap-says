The  University of Texas  and the
University of  Oklahoma  gave their presidents permission to seek
new conference affiliations, taking them a step closer to a
possible departure from the Big 12, the  Associated Press  said.  Oklahoma  President David Boren said he’s focused on keeping
the school in the Big 12 or moving to the  Pacific-12 Conference .
Texas President Bill Powers said the process is “ongoing”
without mentioning any possible future home for the Longhorns.  Boren and Powers got authority from the board of regents at
their schools to pursue membership in a different conference.
Oklahoma State’s regents have scheduled a special meeting for
tomorrow to address the same topic.  Boren said if Oklahoma exits the Big 12, in-state rival
Oklahoma State also will leave.  In preparation for the possible departure of  Texas  and
Oklahoma, school and conference officials from the  Big 12  and
 Big East  conferences have held discussions on ways to merge
their remaining members, AP said, citing an unidentified person
involved in the negotiations. Big 12 and Big East officials
didn’t return messages seeking comment.  The Big 12 this year lost the University of Nebraska to the
 Big Ten  and the University of  Colorado  to the Pac-12, while
 Texas A&M  accepted an invitation to the  Southeastern Conference .  The Big East two days ago was informed that Syracuse
University and the  University of Pittsburgh  will be leaving to
join the Atlantic Coast Conference.  To contact the reporter on this story:
