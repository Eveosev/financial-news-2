Natura Cosmeticos SA (NATU3) ,  Latin
America ’s largest cosmetics maker, declined for a sixth day in
Sao Paulo after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. recommended selling the
stock on concern profits will suffer from rising competition and
inflation.  Natura extended the longest losing streak since June,
dropping 4.5 percent to 32.82 reais at 2:06 p.m. New York time.
It was the biggest decliner on the 68-member Bovespa index,
which advanced 0.4 percent.  “Natura faces intensifying competitive and structural
headwinds that raise uncertainty around future growth,”
analysts at Goldman Sachs, including Irma Sgarz, wrote in a note
to clients today. They cut their rating to “sell” from
“neutral.”  A report from the national statistics agency today showed
that consumer prices rose 0.53 percent in the month through mid-
September.  JPMorgan Chase & Co. echoed the concern in an e-mail to
clients today.  “Natura suffers a lot with rising inflation,” wrote
analysts Andrea Teixeira and Felipe Oliveira, who have a
“neutral” rating on the stock. “Sales growth continues to be
challenging. We maintain our cautious vision.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
