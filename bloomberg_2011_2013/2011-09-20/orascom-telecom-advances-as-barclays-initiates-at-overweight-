Orascom Telecom Holding SAE (ORTE) , North
Africa’s biggest mobile-phone company, headed for the highest
close in seven weeks after  Barclays Capital  initiated the shares
with an “overweight” recommendation.  Shares of Cairo-based Orascom rose 4.1 percent to 3.58
Egyptian pounds at 12:48 p.m. in Cairo, headed for the highest
close since Aug. 4. The shares earlier rose as much as 9.9
percent. Egypt’s benchmark  EGX 30 Index (EGX30)  climbed 0.9 percent.  The investment bank said Orascom is a “preferred pick”
among Egyptian telecommunication companies because the market is
valuing its Algerian unit Djezzy at less than zero. Orascom’s
share price estimate was set at $4.4, Barclays said in a
research note today. The global depository receipts rose 2.6
percent to $2.98 at 12:04 p.m. in  London .  Djezzy has been the center of a dispute between parent
Orascom and the Algerian government, which said it wants to buy
it. Orascom founder Naguib Sawiris said last year an acceptable
price for Djezzy is more than $7.8 billion, more than twice what
the Algerian government said it was willing to pay.  “Precedents of forced nationalizations in the oil and gas
industry show that companies that are obliged to give up assets
or stakes generally get book value,” Barclays said in the
report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
