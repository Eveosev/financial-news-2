Ivory Coast , the world’s biggest
cocoa producer, plans to spend 5 billion  CFA francs  ($10.4
million) on expansion of its western port of  San Pedro , said
Transport Minister Gaoussou Toure.  The West African nation’s project includes construction of a
terminal for exports of mineral commodities produced in the
western part of  Ivory Coast , including manganese ore and iron,
Toure said in an interview in Yamoussoukro, the capital, on
Sept. 17. Part of the funds will also be used to renovate parts
of the port that were damaged recently by high waves, he said.  Ivory Coast is spending on infrastructure projects to help
rebuild its economy after a nearly five-month violent crisis
that followed a disputed November election. Projects include a
new bridge spanning the Ebrie lagoon in Abidjan, the commercial
capital, as well as roads and electricity provision.  The Abidjan port will also be upgraded, Toure said, without
providing details. A new shipping law is being written to boost
investments in the industry, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
