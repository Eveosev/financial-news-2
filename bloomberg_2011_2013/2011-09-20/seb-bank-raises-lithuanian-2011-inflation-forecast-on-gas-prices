Lithuania’s consumer prices may
accelerate at a faster rate than previously estimated this year
as rising gas prices increase heating costs, SEB Bank AB said.  SEB, Lithuania’s largest lender, raised its 2011 inflation
forecast to 4 percent from a previous estimate of 3.5 percent,
according to an e-mailed statement today.  Price growth may slow to 3.5 percent next year from a
previously foreseen 4 percent, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
