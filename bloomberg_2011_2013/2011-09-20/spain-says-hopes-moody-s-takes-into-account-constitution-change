Spanish Finance Minister  Elena
Salgado  said she hopes Moody’s Investors Service takes into
account the constitutional amendment on budget stability as the
company completes a review of  Spain ’s credit rating.  “I hope Moody’s takes into account the fact we are meeting
our objectives, that the reforms are underway, and something
very important that’s happened since Moody’s started the review,
which is the reform of the constitution,” she said in an
interview with Antena 3 television today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
