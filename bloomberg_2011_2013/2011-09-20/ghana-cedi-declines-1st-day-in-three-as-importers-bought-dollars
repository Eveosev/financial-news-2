Ghana ’s cedi weakened for the first
day in three as traders bought dollars to import goods for
resale and manufacturers sought the U.S. currency to bring raw
materials into West Africa’s biggest economy after  Nigeria .  The currency of the world’s second-largest cocoa producer
depreciated as much as 0.8 percent to 1.5706 per dollar, before
trading 0.2 percent weaker at 1.5607 per dollar as of 2:11 p.m.
in Accra, the capital, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “The cedi was down today on firm corporate demand for
dollars, from the commerce and manufacturing industry” Jacob Brobbey, a currency trader at the local unit of Barclays Bank
Plc, said in a telephone interview. “Mining firms converted
earnings from the U.S. currency into cedis today but demand
exceeded supply.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
