Penta Investments Ltd. said it has
filed a lawsuit via a subsidiary with the Vienna Commercial
Court against  A-Tec Industries AG. (ATEC)   “Penta is convinced that selecting Contor Industries GmbH
as an investor for A-Tec is seriously breaching the rules set
out in the restructuring plan of A-Tec as approved by the Vienna
Commercial Court and thereupon by A-Tec itself,” according to a
statement today.  A-Tec, an insolvent Austrian engineering group, on Sept. 5
announced that it accepted an acquisition offer from Contor. The
plan, which must be approved at a Sept. 28 shareholders meeting,
will allow A-Tec to pay creditors 47 percent of its outstanding
debts and splits up the business, selling two of A-Tec’s three
units.  “A number of violations prove that the search for and
selection of an investor for A-Tec was not conducted in a fair
and proper manner,” Penta said in the statement. “Penta thus
expects a verdict which will result in refraining A-Tec from
breaching the binding rules and procedures of the restructuring
plan.”  A-Tec in a statement today said that it had no knowledge of
a lawsuit and that Penta’s offer couldn’t be accepted for
“legal reasons.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
