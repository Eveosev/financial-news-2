The  Philippines  may offer 10- and
15-year debt targeted to individuals next month and is waiting
for proposals from possible arrangers of so-called retail bonds,
Deputy Treasurer Eduardo Mendiola said today.  The Bureau of the Treasury will probably maintain its
weekly debt auction volume at 9 billion pesos next quarter and
continue to favor longer-maturity bonds even as thereâ€™s room to
cut the borrowing size amid the small  budget deficit , Mendiola
said in an interview in  Manila .  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
