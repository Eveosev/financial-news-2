United Grain Co. ,  Russia ’s state
grain trader, agreed to work with the country’s Transport
Ministry and Krasnodar regional administration to build a
terminal at the Black Sea port of Taman, the company said.  The parties signed an agreement on Sept. 16, United Grain
said in an e-mailed statement. The facility will be able to
handle at least 6 million metric tons of grain exports each
year.  United Grain spokesman Viktor Krupenin said in June that
the terminal was expected to open by 2017.  To contact the reporter on this story:
