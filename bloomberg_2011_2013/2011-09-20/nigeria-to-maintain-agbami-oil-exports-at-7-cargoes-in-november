Nigeria ,  Africa â€™s largest oil
producer, plans to maintain Agbami crude shipments at seven
cargoes in November, according to a loading program obtained by
Bloomberg News.  The country will also export six Forcados, five Akpo, five
Bonga and three Yoho cargoes for November, the schedule showed.
Each shipment is 950,000 to 1 million barrels.  Nigeria will ship five lots of Brass River crude, with
cargo size ranging from 200,000 to 950,000 barrels, according to
the plan.  A shipping plan released yesterday showed Nigeria will
export 12 cargoes of Qua Iboe crude in November.  Shipping schedules of remaining 11 grades, including Bonny
Light, are not available now. Loading programs are monthly
schedules of crude shipments compiled by field operators to
allow buyers and sellers to plan their supply and trading
activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
