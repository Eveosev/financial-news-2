The former chief financial officer
of CSK Auto Corp. was sentenced to two years in prison for his
role in a scheme to manipulate the company’s earnings and
double-bill customers, federal prosecutors said.  Don W. Watson, 55, of Gilbert,  Arizona , was also ordered
yesterday to serve three years of supervised release and to pay
restitution in an amount to be set by the court at a later date,
according to a U.S. Justice Department statement. Edward Novak,
Watson’s attorney, didn’t immediately respond to a message
seeking comment about the sentencing.  O’Reilly Automotive Inc. (ORLY)  this month agreed to pay
$20.9 million to resolve a Justice Department probe of a scheme
to manipulate earnings and double bill at CSK Auto before
O’Reilly bought it in 2008.  The investigation has produced guilty pleas from three
former CSK Auto employees, including Watson, the department
said.  The case is U.S. v. Fraser, 09-cr-00372, U.S. District
Court, District of Arizona (Phoenix).  To contact the reporter on this story:
