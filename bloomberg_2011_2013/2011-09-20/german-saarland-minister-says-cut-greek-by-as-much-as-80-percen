Christoph Hartmann, the economy
minister of  Germany ’s Saarland state, said  Greece  needs “a
haircut” for as much as 80 percent of its debt. Hartmann, a
member of the Free Democratic Party that serves as junior
coalition partner in Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government, made
his comments late yesterday in an interview in Saarbruecken,
Germany.  “We have to get Greece in a position where it can repay
its debt,” Hartmann said. “We must reduce the debt to 20
percent or 30 percent” of its current level.  “We need long-term security for euro members and we won’t
get this through cosmetic changes,” Hartmann said. “It will be
painful.”   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
