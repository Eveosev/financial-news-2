Growth in world consumption of 10
oilseeds will exceed production gains in the 2011-12 season on a
smaller U.S. soybean crop, reducing the stocks-to-use ratio to a
three-year low, Oil World forecast.  Oilseed use probably will climb 3.9 percent to 461.2
million metric tons as global production advances 0.7 percent to
456.5 million tons, the Hamburg-based  researcher  said today in a
weekly report.  Soybeans climbed 24 percent in Chicago trading in the past
year on speculation lower planting and adverse weather will cut
output of the oilseed in the U.S., the largest grower and
exporter. Soybeans accounted for 59 percent of world oilseed
production in the past two years, according to Oil World.  “Oilseed production will turn out below potential,” the
researcher said. “World supplies of oilseeds and grains will,
as a whole, be short in the 2011-12 season. Consumption will
exceed production, resulting in a decline in stocks.”  The ratio of oilseed stocks to usage is forecast to slide
to 18.1 percent from 19.9 percent in 2010-11, according to Oil
World. That would be the lowest level since the 14.6 percent
registered in the 2008-09 season.  World soybean production will fall to 260.9 million tons
from 265.4 million tons as the U.S. crop slides to 84 million
tons from 90.6 million tons, Oil World forecast.  Argentina ’s
harvest probably will rise to 53 million tons from 49.2 million
tons as  Brazil ’s crop slips to 73.3 million tons from 75.3
million tons, according to the report.  Acreage Battle  “Prospects for the Southern Hemisphere are still rather
vague,” Oil World said. “Soybeans are competing for acreage
with grains. In Argentina and Brazil, plantings of corn and
wheat will increase for the 2011-12 crops.”  Brazil is the world’s second-biggest soybean exporter, and
Argentina ranks third. China is the top global importer.  Sunflower-seed production will probably jump to a record
37.1 million tons from 33.3 million tons a year earlier on
bigger crops in Russia, Ukraine and  France , according to Oil
World. Russia’s harvest may rise to 8.7 million tons from 5.65
million tons, the researcher forecast.  World production of rapeseed and canola will fall to 59
million tons from 60.2 million tons on smaller harvests in
Germany and  China , according to the report. The German rapeseed
crop probably will drop to 4.1 million tons from 5.7 million
tons, the researcher said.  The stocks-to-use ratio for sunflower seed is forecast to
rise to 7.3 percent in 2011-12, while the rapeseed ratio will
slide to 9.5 percent from 10.4 percent, Oil World said.  Global output of cotton seed will climb to 47.9 million
tons from 44.3 million tons, while production of groundnuts will
advance to 25.2 million tons from 25.01 million tons, according
to the researcher.  To contact the reporter on this story:
