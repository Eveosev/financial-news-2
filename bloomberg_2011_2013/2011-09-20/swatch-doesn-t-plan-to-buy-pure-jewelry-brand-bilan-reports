Swatch Group AG (UHR)  isn’t interested in
acquiring a “pure jewelry brand,”  Bilan  reported, citing an
interview with Chairwoman Nayla Hayek.  The biggest maker of Swiss watches will “never” enter
collaborations similar to the partnership it had with  Tiffany &
Co. (TIF) , the Swiss magazine cited Hayek as saying in a preview of an
interview to published tomorrow. The Biel, Switzerland-based
company doesn’t plan to increase holdings in its existing
distributors, she said, according to Bilan.  Swatch said Sept. 12 that it’s ending collaboration with
New York-based Tiffany, alleging the U.S. jeweler breached a
contract by blocking development of the business.  The Swiss company is interested in finding a partner in the
U.S. and is “regularly in discussion” with others in the
industry about cooperating in the market, Bilan cited Hayek as
saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
