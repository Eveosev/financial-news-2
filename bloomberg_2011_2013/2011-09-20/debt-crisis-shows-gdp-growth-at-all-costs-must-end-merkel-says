Europe ’s debt crisis is partly
rooted in a “wrong philosophy” of pushing for economic growth
at all costs, which policy makers must renounce, German
 Chancellor Angela Merkel  said.  “This must end,” Merkel said in a speech on sustainable
growth in Berlin today. “If we understand the crisis properly,
we have a historic chance to anchor a new era of financial
policy in Europe. We don’t want a debt union, but a stability
union.”.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
