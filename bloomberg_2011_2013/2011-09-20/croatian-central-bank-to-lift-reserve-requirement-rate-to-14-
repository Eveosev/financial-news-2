Croatia ’s central bank will raise
the reserve requirement rate for banks to 14 percent from 13
percent to stabilize the exchange rate of the local currency
against the euro.  The change will be effective on Oct. 12, the Zagreb-based
bank said today in a statement.  “With this measure, the central bank will withdraw about
3.1 billion kuna ($569 million) from the banking system,” the
central bank said. The kuna was trading at 7.47 against the euro
at 2:44 p.m. today, after climbing to 7.51 on Sept. 16., the
highest since April 13, 2009.  “The system is already quite liquid, so a decrease in
liquidity isn’t expected to significantly raise the  interest
rates  on loans and deposits, Zdeslav Santic, the chief analyst
at  Societe Generale  - Splitska Banka d.d., said by phone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
