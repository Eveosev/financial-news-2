The U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission has asked  Dow Chemical Co. (DOW) ,  Fortune Brands Inc. (FO) ,
 Caterpillar Inc. (CAT)  and CIT Group Inc., among other companies, to
disclose more information to investors about overseas earnings
and cash, the Financial Times reported, citing unidentified
people familiar with the matter.  Attention has been directed recently at the impact of tax
rules that may distort business decisions, causing companies to
invest abroad rather than at home, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
