Air Berlin Plc (AB1)  said it expects to
improve operating profit by 200 million euros ($274 million) as
it implements an “earnings improvement program.”  As part of the program, the discount airline will reduce
its current fleet of aircraft to 152 from 170 in the summer of
2012, and with a 4 percent reduction in flight hours,
productivity per plane should increase, it said in a statement
today.  Air Berlin can’t issue further information on performance
in 2011 owing to “actual, volatile, economic” developments and
details on the earnings improvement program will be published
tomorrow, the carrier said.  Deutsche Lufthansa AG (LHA)  cut its full-year profit forecast
today and said it would further cut capacity this winter after
last month’s results were weaker than expected and forward
bookings declined.  Lufthansa joined market leader Air France-KLM Group in
predicting a decline in annual earnings. The German carrier was
already trimming capacity growth for the winter season from Oct.
29 to 6 percent from 12 percent by using smaller planes,
deferring planned routes and shutting the Lufthansa Italia unit.  Air Berlin’s longtime Chief Executive Officer Joachim Hunold tendered his resignation in August as  Europe ’s third-
biggest discount airline prepared to slash routes and ground
planes in an effort to stem mounting losses.  Interim CEO Hartmut Mehdorn said in a letter to employees
in September he would consider any potential jobs cuts
“carefully” and “responsibly” as the airline tries to cut
costs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
