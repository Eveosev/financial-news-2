AVIC Capital Co. , the financing arm
of  China ’s biggest aerospace company, is interested in buying
overseas lessors as it expands its fleet on rising domestic
travel demand.  The company plans to increase its leasing assets 40 percent
a year to 30 billion yuan ($4.7 billion) by 2015, General
Manager Meng Xiangtai said today in Beijing. He didn’t elaborate
on potential takeover targets.  The  finance company  is also helping parent Aviation
Industry Corp. of China with plans to buy an aerospace supplier
in Europe, Meng said, without elaboration. The parent is leading
China’s drive to grow its domestic aerospace industry, including
backing development of a single-aisle plane that will compete
with Boeing Co. and Airbus SAS’s best-selling models.  AVIC Capital is also being injected into Beiya Industrial
(Group) Co. to ease access to capital markets. The company
expects regulatory approval for the move this year, Meng said.  --Jasmine Wang. Editors: Neil Denslow, Vipin Nair  To contact the reporter on this story:
