Derwent London Plc (DLN) , the landlord
that develops mid-priced  office space  in central London, gained
permission for a 125 million-pound ($196 million) redevelopment
of the site of Saatchi & Saatchi Ltd.’s London office.  London Mayor Boris Johnson approved the project to build
367,000 square feet (34,100 square meters) of offices,
apartments and retail space, according to a statement. The mayor
overruled Camden Borough Council’s rejection of the project at
80 Charlotte Street in the Fitzrovia neighborhood.  Advertising firm Saatchi & Saatchi, a unit of France’s
Publicis Group SA, rents 200,000 square feet in the building
through March 2013. The site will be partially torn down and
 redeveloped  to add floors.  “We look forward to starting on site in 2013,” Chief
Executive Officer  John Burns  said in the statement. The project
should be completed in late 2015.  New York-based Saatchi & Saatchi was founded in London in
1970 and is now part of Paris-based Publicis Groupe, the world’s
third-largest communications group, according to Saatchi’s
website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
