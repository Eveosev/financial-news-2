European Union governments and
lawmakers have failed to reach agreement on an EU law to curb
sales of so-called naked credit-default swaps for sovereign debt
at a two-hour meeting today.  Representatives of Poland, which holds the rotating
presidency of the EU, and the European Parliament were unable to
reach a deal on how to limit trading in naked CDS,  Sharon
Bowles , chairwoman of the parliament’s economic and monetary
affairs committee, said in a telephone interview.  Discussions will continue to find a solution that
“ultimately fits both sides,” Bowles said. The curbs are part
of a broader draft EU law that would also limit naked short-
selling of stocks and  government bonds .  -- Editor: Anthony Aarons  To contact the reporters on this story:
