Turkey’s current-account deficit
may be “forcibly narrowed” by slower economic expansion in the
country,  Standard & Poor’s  said.  Turkey’s economy may expand by 2 percent to 3 percent next
year, which would mean growth-per-capita of “close to zero,”
 Frank Gill , a London-based analyst with S&P, said in a telephone
interview. The ratings company lifted Turkey’s local-currency
debt rating by one level to BBB-, the lowest investment-grade
ranking.  “Generally what you get after credit-driven growth, you
get a sharp slowdown and that affects the government’s balance
sheet,” Gill said. Turkey’s current-account gap, largely funded
by debt inflows rather than foreign direct investment, may be
“forcibly narrowed,” he said.  Turkey’s foreign-currency ranking was affirmed at BB with a
positive outlook, S&P said today in a statement.  “What we’re looking for is further evidence that this
economy can grow without generating large external imbalances
which pose a risk to the economy,” Gill said.  Turkey ’s economy expanded 8.8 percent in the second quarter
as a boom in consumer borrowing forced the government to cap
loan growth at 25 percent. The country’s 12-month current-
account deficit widened to a record $74.6 billion in July, about
10 percent of gross domestic product.  “We still think the economy is quite resilient, we think
they’ll manage through this,” Gill said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
