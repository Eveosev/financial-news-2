Yuri Milner, billionaire chairman
of Mail.ru Group Ltd., raised $59.5 million in a share sale of
the largest  Internet company  in the Russian-speaking world based
on monthly users.  Milner sold 1.7 million shares for $35 each, according to
an e-mailed statement from  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) , the sole
manager of the sale. They were offered at $34 to $35.25 apiece,
according to a person familiar with the process, as much as 6.6
percent lower than today’s last trade.  Mail.ru, also an investor in  Facebook  Inc., held its
initial public offering in London in November, raising $912
million. The Moscow-based company rose 1.9 percent to $36.40 in
London trading today, valuing the company at $7.6 billion.  Milner, 49, co-founded Mail.ru in 2001 and was appointed
chairman in October 2010. He has been expanding investments in
social-networking websites, including a $400 million investment
in micro-blogging service Twitter Inc. last month.  Mail.ru bought its stake in Facebook in 2009 and also holds
Internet investments in online game company Zynga Inc. and
shopping website Groupon Inc. Chief Executive Officer Dmitry Grishin said last month that Mail.ru may sell some of its shares
in Groupon and Zynga if those companies hold initial public
offerings.  To contact the reporters on this story:
