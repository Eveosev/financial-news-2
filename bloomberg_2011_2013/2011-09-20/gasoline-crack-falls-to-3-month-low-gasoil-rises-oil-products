company sold one of the cargoes to BP Plc, its seventh this
month. The premium of diesel to gasoil traded on London’s ICE
Futures Europe exchange increased. Gasoil futures rose.
Gasoline’s premium to  Brent crude  fell to the lowest in three
months.  Light Products  Gasoline barges for loading in Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp
traded from $1,000 to $1,005 a metric ton, according to a survey
of traders and brokers monitoring the Argus Bulletin Board. That
compares with trades yesterday from $998 to $1,021 a ton.  The deals are for Eurobob grade, to which ethanol is added
to make finished motor fuel, and are typically for lots of 1,000
tons or 2,000 tons.  Gasoline’s crack narrowed to $5.09 a barrel from $5.36
yesterday, according to PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a crude and
refined products broker in  London . That’s the lowest price
spread since June 14.  Naphtha’s discount to Brent widened 3 cents to $3.52 a
barrel, according to PVM.  Middle Distillates  Vitol Group bought the other jet cargo, according to a
survey of brokers and traders monitoring the Platts pricing
window which ends at 4:30 p.m. in London. BP purchased the lot
partly at a premium of $68 a ton to October gasoil, while
Vitol’s purchase was $2 higher. That compares with a cargo trade
on Sept. 15 at a $74 premium. BP has bought six cargoes of
30,000 tons each from Morgan Stanley this month.  Diesel barges traded at premiums of $22 and $22.50 a ton to
October gasoil, the survey showed. That compares with a deal
yesterday at a $21.50 premium.  Gasoil for October rose 0.4 percent to $934.75 a ton as of
5:20 p.m. London time on the ICE exchange. The November contract
increased 0.3 percent to $930.50 a ton. Front-month Brent

yesterday, according to ICE data.  Residues  High-sulfur  fuel oil  traded from $636.25 to $641 a ton,
