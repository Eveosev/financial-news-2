China stock-market sentiment has
reached a “historical” low level amid intensifying external
uncertainties and a lack of policy visibility in the country,
Citigroup Inc. said.  “The markets have priced in a mild recession in the U.S.
and a good chance of defaults of European periphery countries,”
Minggao Shen and Ben Wei, analysts at Citigroup, wrote in a
report dated today. Stocks have also fallen amid a lack of
clarity over how the government will meet challenges facing the
economy, including inflation, local government vehicle debts,
non-performing loans and the  property market , they wrote.  “While policy visibility takes time to improve alongside
the ongoing government reshuffles, early evidence suggests that
it will likely provide opportunities to long Chinese equities,”
they wrote.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
