Nigeria ’s gauge of banking stocks
dropped to the lowest level in three years as concerns over the
debt crisis in  Europe  and the U.S. curbed investors’ appetite
for riskier assets,  Renaissance Capital  said.  The 10-member Bloomberg Banking Index of the most
capitalized lenders retreated 1 percent to 297.28 by the 2:30
p.m. close in Lagos, the commercial capital. That’s the lowest
since Bloomberg started compiling the data in July 2008.  First
Bank of Nigeria Plc (FIRSTBAN) , the country’s third-biggest lender by
market value, fell for a second day, declining 2 percent to 10
naira. Stanbic IBTC Bank Plc dropped 2.1 percent to close at
9.15 naira, the weakest since Sept. 1.  “There’s just no momentum to support the banks at the
moment,” Adesoji Solanke, a Lagos-based banking analyst with
Renaissance, said in an e-mailed response to questions today.
“Fundamentals have improved significantly in our view, but in
light of global negative sentiments towards financial stocks,
sub-Saharan African banks have also taken a beating.”  The average daily trade has fallen to about $10 million
“in the past few months, relative to $15 million to $20 million
earlier this year, Solanke said. While foreign investors are
inactive, locals prefer to wait on the sidelines, “as both
wonder if this is a falling knife yet to hit the ground.”  Foreign investors account for about 70 percent of stocks
traded on the  Nigerian Stock Exchange , according to figures
published by the bourse.  To contact the reporter on this story:
