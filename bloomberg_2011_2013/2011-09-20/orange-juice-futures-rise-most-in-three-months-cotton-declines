Orange-juice juice futures rose the
most in three months on storm concerns in  Florida , the world’s
second-biggest producer. Cotton declined.  A low-pressure system in the Atlantic Ocean, about 1,500
miles (2,400 kilometers) east of the Windward Islands, has a 70
percent chance of becoming a tropical cyclone, the National
Hurricane Center in Miami said. The Thomson Reuters/Jefferies
CRB Index of 19 raw materials rose for the first time in five
sessions as Greek debt concerns eased.  “Speculators came back, like they do this time of year,
when there’s news about a possible storm” hurting crops in
Florida,  Michael Smith , the president of T&K Futures & Options
in  Port St. Lucie , Florida, said in a telephone interview.
“There’s also optimism that a deal with the Greek government
will be reached, signaling that the worst for commodities might
be over.”  Orange-juice futures for November delivery rose 5.3 cents,
or 3.2 percent, to settle at $1.6845 a pound at 2 p.m. on ICE
Futures U.S. in  New York , the biggest gain for a most-active
contract since June 21. Last week, the price slumped 3.5
percent.  Cotton futures for December delivery slid 0.11 cent, or
0.1, percent, to $1.0541 a pound in New York. The price dropped
for the fourth straight session, the longest slump since early
June.  To contact the reporter on this story:
