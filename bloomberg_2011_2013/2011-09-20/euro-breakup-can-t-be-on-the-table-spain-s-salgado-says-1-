Spanish Finance Minister  Elena Salgado  said a breakup of the euro area shouldn’t even be
discussed, when urging governments to help Greece.  “That possibility can’t be on the table,” Salgado told
 Antena 3  television in an interview broadcast today in Madrid.
“We all have to do everything possible so that Greece can solve
its problems.”  European leaders are struggling to contain the region’s
sovereign-debt crisis from spreading to larger nations more than
a year after Greece received its first bailout. About a quarter
of investors expect the 17-member euro area to break up,
 Barclays Capital  said yesterday, citing a client survey.  The European Central Bank early last month started buying
Spanish and Italian bonds to stem rising yields and  Spain ’s 10-
year borrowing costs have since fallen around 70 basis points to
5.34 percent today. Salgado said the bank’s aim is to prevent
secondary-market bond prices “falling below what would be
reasonable, taking into account the situation of each country.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
