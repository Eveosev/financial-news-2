Peru’s benchmark borrowing costs in
dollars fell from their highest in 19 months as speculation the
 Federal Reserve  will announce monetary easing spurred demand for
higher-yielding, emerging-market assets.  The extra yield investors demand to own Peruvian  government
bonds  instead of U.S. Treasuries fell seven basis points, or
0.07 percentage point, to 232 at 12:57 p.m., according to
JPMorgan Chase & Co. Peru’s dollar borrowing costs yesterday
rose to their highest since February 2010.  The Fed will probably decide tomorrow to replace short-term
Treasuries in its $1.65 trillion portfolio with long-term bonds
as it seeks to pump up U.S. growth, according to 71 percent of
42 economists in a Bloomberg News survey. Investors are pricing
in purchases of $400 billion to $500 billion, according to
Barclays Capital Inc.  “The market is expecting the Fed to come up with something
meaningful and not disappoint,” said  Roberto Melzi  a New York-
based Latin America strategist at Barclays. “If it only comes
out with $300 billion, that’ll be a disappointment and will
affect risky assets.”  The yield on Peru’s benchmark 6.55 percent dollar-
denominated bond due March 2037 fell one basis point to 5.15
percent.  The sol weakened 0.1 percent to 2.7390 per  U.S. dollar ,
from 2.7375 yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
