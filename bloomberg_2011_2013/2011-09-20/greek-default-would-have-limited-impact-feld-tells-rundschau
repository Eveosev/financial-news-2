Restructuring  Greece ’s debt would
cause a “limited” reaction in financial markets because they
have been expecting a Greek default for some time, German
government adviser Lars Feld was cited as telling the
 Frankfurter Rundschau  newspaper in an interview.  The prospect of any contagion spreading to Ireland and
Portugal is not high since neither country’s banks are
particularly exposed to Greece, Feld was cited as saying.  Greek banks would still need some 20 billion euros ($27
billion) from the European Financial Stability Facility to
offset any losses from money lent to the Greek government,
Rundschau cited Feld as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
