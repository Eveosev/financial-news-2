The African Venture Capital
Association, a Kenya-based industry group representing private-
equity and venture-capital companies, appointed Michelle Kathryn
Essome as its chief executive officer.  Sub-Saharan African funds raised $1.1 billion in the first
half of 2011, more than the entire amount raised during 2009,
the Nairobi-based association, known as AVCA, said in an e-
mailed statement today.  In her 20-year career in  investment banking , Essome has
worked with Merrill Lynch & Co., Goldman Sachs Group and
JPMorgan Chase & Co., according to the statement.  Runa Alam joined the board of AVCA as co-chair, while Simon
Walker was appointed special advisor to the board, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
