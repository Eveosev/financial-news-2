Zinc may climb to average $2,800 a
metric ton in 2014 as a shortage develops, Beijing Antaike
Information Development Co. and Raw Materials Group said.  Demand will exceed supply by 100,000 tons in 2013 and
150,000 tons in 2014, led by usage in  China , the world’s largest
buyer of the metal, the companies said in a report today before
a conference in  Stockholm . Prices of zinc, used to galvanize
steel, have averaged $2,327 a ton so far this year.  “The rapid development of China’s industrialization and
urbanization will support zinc consumption in the next five
years,” the companies said in the report.  Zinc prices have dropped 15 percent this year as supply
expanded. The surplus will be 250,000 tons this year and 300,000
tons next year, according to the report. Antaike, based in
Beijing, is sponsoring the conference today with Stockholm-based
Raw Materials Group.  Zinc for three-month delivery fell 0.2 percent to $2,095 a
metric ton at 4:30 p.m. on the London Metal Exchange yesterday.  China accounted for about 40 percent of zinc demand last
year, according to RBS Global Banking & Markets. Zinc demand in
the country may climb to 6.58 million tons in 2015 from
4.75 million last year, according to the Antaike and RMG study.  To contact the reporter on this story:
