South African employment growth
slowed and the central bank’s gauge for economic outlook
dropped, signaling  interest rates  may stay unchanged this week
to help stimulate a sagging economy.  Employment in  formal , non-agricultural industries rose
7,000, or 0.1 percent, to 8.3 million from the first three
months of the year, Pretoria-based Statistics South Africa said
on its website today. Employers added 0.6 percent more jobs in
the first quarter. The data is based on a survey of companies
registered to pay taxes.  The leading indicator, which measures a range of data
including job advertisements and manufacturing orders to gauge
the economic outlook, fell to 134.3 in July from a revised 135.5
in June, the  Reserve Bank  said today.  “We are definitely going through a soft patch of domestic
data,” said Jeffrey Schultz, an analyst at Absa Group Ltd. “A
slower GDP trajectory for 2011 and 2012 is a likely outcome.”  South Africa  is struggling to slash its jobless rate as
economic growth slowed to an annualized 1.3 percent in the
second quarter, while inflation quickened to 5.3 percent in
July, the highest in more than a year. Its  unemployment rate 
climbed to 25.7 percent in the three months through June.  The Reserve Bank will likely hold the lending rate at 5.5
percent on Sept. 22 as the debt crisis in  Europe  and the global
slowdown threaten to derail the recovery, according to 18 of 19
economists surveyed by Bloomberg. Europe buys about a third of
South Africa’s manufactured goods.  Employment increased by 164,000, or 2 percent, in the
second quarter from a year earlier, the statistics office said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
