Tanzania’s shilling gained against
the dollar as tourists increased supply of the U.S currency.  The currency of  East Africa ’s second-biggest economy gained
as much as 0.9 percent at 1,625.7 per dollar, and traded up 0.2
percent at 1637.5 by 1:32 p.m. in Dar es Salaam, the commercial
capital.  “Dollar inflows have continued to come in today from the
tourism sector, which helped the shilling to appreciate
slightly,” Eric Chijoriga, a trader with National Bank of
Commerce Ltd., Absa Group Ltd.’s Tanzanian unit, said by phone
from Dar es Salaam. “The appreciation might be short because
oil importers are increasing demand for dollars.”  Tourism’s total contribution to the country’s gross
domestic product is expected to increase to 13.4 percent of GDP
by 2021 from 12.9 percent now, the World Travel & Tourism
Council said on its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
