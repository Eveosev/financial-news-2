Telefonica SA (TEF)  is set to boost its
position in  Brazil , as it will be permitted to offer its
Imagenio pay TV service throughout the country,  El Economista 
reported, without citing anyone.  Brazilian President  Dilma Rousseff  approved a bill that
allows both national and foreign telecommunications companies to
operate in the pay TV market, the newspaper said. Foreign cable
companies will also be allowed to own more than 59 percent of
any Brazilian pay TV operator, it said.  Telefonica has hitherto supplied pay TV to 682,000
subscribers in the state of  Sao Paulo  through Telesp, El
Economista said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
