Taiwan ’s dollar fell to an eight-
month low before government data today that showed export orders
grew in August at the slowest pace in 22 months.  The currency has weakened on all but two days this month as
overseas investors sold $1.7 billion more of the island’s shares
than they bought, favoring the relative safety of the greenback
amid signs Europe’s debt crisis is worsening. Italy’s credit
rating was cut one level by Standard & Poor’s yesterday as
Greece held talks with the European Union and  International
Monetary Fund  to secure bailout funds.  Exports are “weighing on the  Taiwan dollar ,” said Teck Kin Suan, an economist at United Overseas Bank Ltd. in  Singapore .
“Because of global developments, risk-aversion trades are going
to affect Asian currencies.”  Taiwan’s dollar slid 0.4 percent to close at NT$29.888
against its U.S. counterpart, according to Taipei Forex Inc. The
currency touched NT$29.98, the weakest level since Jan. 7.  Export orders, indicative of shipments in the next one to
three months, rose 5.3 percent in August from a year earlier,
the Ministry of Economic Affairs said in Taipei today before the
foreign-exchange market closed. Growth averaged 9.9 percent in
the first eight months of this year and 29 percent in 2010.  Government bonds  were little changed. The yield on the 2
percent bonds due July 2016 was steady at 0.965 percent,
according to Gretai Securities Market.  To contact the reporter on this story:
