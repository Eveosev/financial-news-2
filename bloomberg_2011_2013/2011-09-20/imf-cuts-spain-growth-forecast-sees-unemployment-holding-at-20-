The  International Monetary Fund  cut
its forecast for Spanish growth next year and said unemployment
will remain close to 20 percent as the spread of the sovereign-
debt crisis undermines the recovery.  Spain’s economy will grow 1.1 percent in 2012 instead of
the 1.6 percent forecast in July, the Washington-based lender
said in a report today. Unemployment will average 20.7 percent
this year and 19.7 percent in 2012, it said.  Spain is struggling to emerge from a three-year slump that
has pushed the jobless rate to the highest in the European Union
and almost doubled its public-debt burden.  Europe ’s crisis
prompted the  European Central Bank  to start buying Spanish bonds
in August.  The IMF maintained its 2011 growth forecast at 0.8 percent.
While Spain’s Socialist government, which faces elections in
November, forecasts a 1.3 percent expansion, Finance Minister
 Elena Salgado  said in an interview on Aug. 19 the target was “a
bit more difficult than it was a quarter ago.” The government
is predicting growth of 2.3 percent in 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
