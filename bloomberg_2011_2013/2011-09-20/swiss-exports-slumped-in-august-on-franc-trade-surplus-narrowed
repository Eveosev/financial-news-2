Swiss exports slumped in August,
adding to signs of economic slowdown after the franc surged to a
record against the euro last month.  Exports, adjusted for inflation and seasonal swings,
dropped 7 percent from July, when they rose 1.4 percent, the
Federal Customs Office in Bern said in an e-mailed statement
today. Imports rose 0.9 percent from July, when they slipped 0.1
percent, and the  trade surplus  narrowed to 808 million francs
($912 million) from 2.81 billion francs.   To contact the reporter on this story:
