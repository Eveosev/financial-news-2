California  sold $2.4 billion in
general-obligation bonds at yields about a third less than two
years ago as its fiscal progress eased the premium demanded by
investors.  The state’s first general obligations offered this year
were priced to yield 3.17 percent on 10 year maturities, as much
as 109 basis points above top-rated tax-exempt debt. That
compares with a 160 basis-point premium on similar bonds in
March 2009. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  “There is a perception that the state is getting its
budgeting and deficit situation more in order,” said Kelly Wine, executive vice president of RH Investment Corp., a broker-
dealer in Encino, California, that helped sell the bonds.  The budget Governor  Jerry Brown  and Democrats passed in
June, which helped reduce long-term structural imbalance,
allowed Treasurer Bill Lockyer to lower yields because perceived
risk has declined, said his spokesman,  Tom Dresslar . Individual
investors bought about 25 percent of the issue, down from 80
percent in November at the most recent previous sale. Slightly
more than half of the total was offered to retail buyers,
Dresslar said.  “The treasurer will maintain his focus on maximizing
retail purchase of California bonds,” Dresslar said. “But if
the days of investors getting a sweet fiscal mismanagement
premium are over, we may not see again some of the higher retail
percentages of recent years.”  The state closed orders to individuals as institutions
bought the bulk of the sale.  ‘Lackluster’ Individual Sales  “Retail interest is generally a bit lackluster at these
levels,” Wine said. “If the state garnered 650 million in
retail orders, perhaps that isn’t such a bad number.”  California sold bonds with yields ranging from as little as
0.72 percent for securities maturing in 2013 and as much as 4.80
for debt maturing in 2041, 114 basis points above a 30-year
index of top-rated tax-exempt bonds.  The 10-year index of top-rated municipals fell to 2.08
percent today, up from 2.05 percent on Sept. 12, the lowest
level since January 2009, when Bloomberg began collecting data
for the securities. Yields on top-rated 30-year tax-exempts fell
to 3.63 percent after slipping to 3.56 percent on Sept. 12, also
the lowest since Bloomberg records began.  The state’s debt, including price changes and interest
income, returned 9.3 percent through Sept. 19, outperforming the
overall tax-exempt market by 122 basis points, according to S&P
Municipal Bond Indexes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
