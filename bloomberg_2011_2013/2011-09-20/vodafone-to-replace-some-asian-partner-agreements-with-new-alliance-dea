Vodafone Group Plc (VOD) , the world’s
biggest mobile-phone operator, will replace existing partner
agreements in some Asian markets by joining one of the region’s
largest alliances.  The agreement with the  Conexus Mobile Alliance , which
covers at least 10 Asian countries and includes  NTT DoCoMo Inc. (9437) ,
 Japan ’s largest operator, will replace existing local contracts
once they expire, the company said in a statement today. The
alliance will give customers better network coverage and
harmonized roaming rates across multiple countries.  Vodafone, based in Newbury, England, will be able to expand
in new markets such as South Korea with Conexus member KT Corp
and get agreements with NTT, Singapore-based  StarHub Ltd. (STH)  and
Hutchison Telecommunications in  Hong Kong . Vodafone currently
has agreements with Japan’s  Softbank Corp. (9984) , Japan’s third-
largest operator, Singapore’s M1 Ltd. and  SmarTone
Telecommunications Holding Ltd. (315)  in Hong Kong.  “The value to Vodafone of collaborating with Conexus will
be significant given the growing importance of Asia to our
enterprise customers,” Morten Lundal, Vodafone Group Chief
Commercial Officer, said.  The company said it won’t seek a roaming agreement with an
alliance partner in  India , where it recently bought spectrum
frequencies for high-speed mobile services.  To contact the reporter on this story:
