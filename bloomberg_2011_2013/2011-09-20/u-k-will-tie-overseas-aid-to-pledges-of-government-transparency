The U.K. will require recipients of
its overseas aid to sign up to principles of transparency and
openness, with the aim of ensuring money is spent effectively.  Cabinet Office Minister Francis Maude will set out the new
policy during a visit to  New York  today. He’ll say that 5
percent of aid money will be marked for projects to increase
accountability, and the British government departments giving
aid money will have to publish more data about how it is spent.  David Cameron’s government has championed open data,
arguing that modern technology allows voters to process the
information and so make better decisions and hold institutions
to account. Maude said he wants developing countries to enjoy
the same benefits.  “There’s a very strong sense that this is a moment where
transparency can really take root,” Maude said in a phone
interview from New York, citing the Arab Spring, in which the
leaders of Tunisia, Egypt and  Libya  have been toppled, as a
series of revolutions aided by technology. “If we really expose
what’s being done with money, it drives efficiency, it drives
effectiveness, it drives accountability and it saves lives.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
