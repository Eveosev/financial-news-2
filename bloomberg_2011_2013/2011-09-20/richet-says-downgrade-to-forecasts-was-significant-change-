European Central Bank President
Jean-Claude Trichet said the bank’s change in its economic
forecasts was a “significant change.”  “We downgraded our forecasts on the real economy and we
think that the risks to growth are growing,” he was quoted as
saying in Expansion. “It’s a significant change from the
forecasts three months ago, when we thought the risks were
balanced.”  “In July there were upside risks for inflation, but now
they are balanced,” he was quoted as saying by the Spanish
newspaper.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
