Molycorp Inc. (MCP) , the owner of the
world’s largest rare-earth deposit outside  China , fell the most
since its 2010 initial public offering after JPMorgan Chase &
Co. lowered its rating, citing declines in rare-earth prices.  Molycorp dropped $11.56, or 22 percent, to $41.45 at 4:02
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares
began trading in July 2010.  JPMorgan cut its recommendation to “neutral” from
“overweight,” Michael Gambardella, a New York-based analyst,
said in a report today. JPMorgan lowered its price target for
Molycorp to $66 from $105.  Rare earths, a group of 17 elements used in electronics and
magnets, have dropped in price because of selling by
speculators, Gambardella said. Molycorp, based in  Greenwood
Village ,  Colorado , was the best-performing U.S. IPO last year,
more than tripling after rare-earth prices soared as China cut
export quotas.  “A large part of this year’s run up and recent drop was
caused by a host of players in China speculating on rare earth
oxides,” Gambardella said in the note. “We are taking a more
cautious stance.”  Cerium oxide has dropped 30 percent since its peak in June,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Lanthanum oxide and
neodymium oxide prices have also fallen, according to the data.  China accounted for more than 90 percent of rare-earth
output in 2009 and more than half of its consumption, U.S.
government data show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
