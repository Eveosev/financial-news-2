Royal KPN NV will appeal a ruling
by a Rotterdam court on a 523,264 euro fine it got from Dutch
telecommunications regulator Opta after a one-time discount
promotion in 2006.  The court dismissed KPNâ€™s appeal against the fine as
unfounded, The Hague-based company said today in an e-mailed
statement.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
