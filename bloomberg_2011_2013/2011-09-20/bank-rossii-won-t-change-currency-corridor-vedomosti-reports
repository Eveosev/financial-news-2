Bank Rossii,  Russia ’s central bank,
has no plans to change the current level of its floating ruble
corridor, according to Deputy Chairman Sergey Shvetsov,
Vedomosti reported.  The dollar is gaining across the world, so the ruble’s
weakness isn’t a problem that is specific to Russia, the
newspaper cited Shvetsov as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
