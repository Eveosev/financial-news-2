PTT Pcl (PTT) ,  Thailand ’s largest energy
company, is seeking to buy long-term supplies for a new
liquefied natural gas import facility from 2015 after purchasing
eight cargoes on a spot basis this year, a company official said
today.  Demand for LNG may rise to 3 million metric tons a year by
2015, Terdkiat Prommool, vice president of PTT’s LNG supply
department, told reporters at the World LNG Series Asia Pacific
Summit in Singapore today. The company plans to import at least
one cargo a month at the receiving  facility  in Rayong province
on the east coast.  PTT is in talks with several companies to supply more LNG
to Thailand for the short term and long term, Prommool said.
Disruption of supplies from a ruptured pipeline forced the
company to import more cargoes than planned, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
