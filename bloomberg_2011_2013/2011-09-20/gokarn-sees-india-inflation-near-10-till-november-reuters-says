India  raised  interest rates  last
week as it expects inflation close to 10 percent until November,
Reuters reported, citing an interview with central bank Deputy
Governor  Subir Gokarn .  The Reuters report cited Gokarn as saying “we are near the
peak,” without clarifying whether he was referring to interest
rates or inflation.  Gokarn said inflation will ease from December because of
“the base effect” and the impact of rate increases, according
to the report.  The  Reserve Bank  of India Sept. 16 raised its repurchase
rate for the 12th time since mid-March 2010 to 8.25 percent.
India’s inflation accelerated to 9.78 percent in August.  To contact the reporter on this story:
