Mali ’s economy may expand 5.4
percent this year and 5.6 percent in 2012 amid higher prices for
gold and cotton, said Christian Josz, the International Monetary
Fund’s mission chief in the country.  Inflation is forecast to be below 3 percent this year
before slowing to less than 2.5 percent in 2012, Josz said in a
statement on the Washington-based lender’s website yesterday.
Mali’s “basic” budget deficit is seen at 1.6 percent of gross
domestic product this year and 0.7 percent of GDP in 2012, he
said in the statement.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
