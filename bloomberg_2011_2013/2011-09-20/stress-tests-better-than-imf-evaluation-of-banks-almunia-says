Joaquin Almunia , the European
Union’s commissioner for competition, said that stress tests
carried out by the EU on its banks were a better indicator of
lenders’ capital needs than a report by the  International
Monetary Fund .  “I think the stress test method, with the bottom-up
approach, is more realistic,” Almunia said.  The IMF is set to publish a report on the health of
Europe’s banks by the end of the month. Reports in the press
that the fund might identify the need for a 200 billion-euro
recapitalization of the region’s lenders were not necessarily
accurate,  Christine Lagarde , the fund’s managing director, told
journalists in Marseille, France, ealier this month. “This
number is part of a draft and it was not a final document,’’
Lagarde said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
