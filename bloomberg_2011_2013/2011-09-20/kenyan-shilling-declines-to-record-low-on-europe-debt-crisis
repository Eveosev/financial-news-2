Kenya ’s shilling depreciated to a
record low against the dollar as uncertainty lingered over how
European policy makers would tackle the debt crisis, reducing
demand for riskier, frontier-market assets.  The currency of East  Africa ’s biggest economy retreated 0.7
percent to 96.25 per dollar, the weakest intraday level since
March 1994 when currency controls were abolished, by 4:52 p.m.
in Nairobi.  Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou’s government will
hold another call with its main creditors after a “productive”
round of talks about securing a sixth installment of rescue
funds aimed at staving off default, the  Finance Ministry  said
yesterday. Standard & Poor’s cut Italy’s sovereign rating one
step to A, with a negative outlook.  “There is risk off, meaning investors are getting out of
emerging markets and getting into safe havens like the  U.S.
dollar  and Swiss franc and the yen and commodities like gold,”
Duncan Kinuthia, head of trading at Commercial Bank of Africa,
said by phone from Nairobi. “It is very possible it could drift
further and go to 100, we just don’t know exactly when.”  Kenya’s currency has declined 16 percent against the dollar
this year, ranking as Africa’s worst performer after the Ugandan
shilling.  To contact the reporter on this story:
