Rocker  Sheryl Crow  has written the
songs for a new musical based on “Diner,” the 30-year-old film
by writer and director Barry Levinson that helped launch the
careers of  Mickey Rourke , Kevin Bacon and Ellen Barkin.
Producers plan to open the show on Broadway in late 2012.  The musical, like the film, will be set in Baltimore in
1959. It focuses on high-school friends reuniting as one
prepares to wed, a press release from the producers said.
Casting wasn’t announced, nor was a theater.  “'Diner' was a pivotal moment in my career, and since then I
have continued to live with the characters, realizing there is
much more to their story,” Levinson, 69, said in a statement.  It will mark the Broadway debut for him and for Crow, 49.
Levinson is writing the book. The producers hope to follow the
success of “Hairspray,” another Baltimore-based film from that
era, which went on to become a Broadway blockbuster and a second
successful movie.  The lead producer is Base Entertainment, whose credits
include “Martin Short: Fame Becomes Me” on Broadway and
“Phantom: The Las Vegas Spectacular,” a version of “The
Phantom of the Opera.”  To contact the writer of this column:
