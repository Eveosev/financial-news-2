Spain  is planning to reduce
subsidies for wind farms that begin producing electricity in
2013, Cinco Dias reported, citing unidentified people in the
industry ministry that are working on a draft rule.  The new regulation would also reduce the number of hours a
day and amount of years during which wind-driven generators
could collect above-market rates, the Spanish newspaper
reported.   Spainâ€™s landmark renewable-energy law, 661/2007, only
governs wind-power prices for new projects through the end of
next year, and power companies are eager for new rules to be set
by the Socialist party-led government before it faces general
elections on Nov. 20, the report said.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
