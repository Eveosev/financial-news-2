A 71-year-old man will be tried at
a London court with attempting to bribe a former Vietnamese
central bank governor by putting his son through university.  William Lowther of Carlisle,  England , is accused of
conspiracy to corrupt Le Duc Thuy by helping his son get into
university and by paying for accommodation and fees, the U.K.
Serious Fraud Office said in an e-mailed statement.  The case is part of a joint investigation by the SFO and
the Australian Federal Police into Securency International PTY
Ltd., a joint venture between the Australian Central Bank and
Innovia Films, a Cumbria-based packaging and labels company.  Lowther, who spoke only to confirm his name, age and
address at the hearing, was granted bail ahead of a trial at
Southwark Crown Court. The next hearing is scheduled for Dec. 2.  Lowther’s lawyer, Christopher David, declined to comment
when contacted on the phone today.  A 63-year-old man, a 49-year-old man and a 47-year-old
woman were arrested in October 2010, in the SFO’s probe into
allegations that contracts for polymer banknotes were obtained
corruptly.  To contact the reporter on this story:
