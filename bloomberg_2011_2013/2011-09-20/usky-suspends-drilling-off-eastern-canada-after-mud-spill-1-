Husky Energy Inc. (HSE) , the Canadian oil
company controlled by Hong Kong billionaire  Li Ka-shing ,
suspended drilling from the GSF Grand Banks rig off eastern
 Canada  after about 5,000 liters of synthetic-based mud spilled.  The spill occurred at about 9:30 a.m. local time in the
White Rose field about 217 miles (349 kilometers) off the coast
of Newfoundland and Labrador, Colleen McConnell, a spokeswoman
for Husky, said in a telephone interview. There was no impact on
production, she said.  The mud is used during drilling to lubricate the pipe and
balance reservoir pressure. It has low toxicity, according to
the  Canada-Newfoundland Offshore Petroleum Board .  “It was discharged over a shale shaker which had shut down
and that caused the fluid to partially overflow the screens and
be discharged through the cutting discharge line,” McConnell
said. “Drilling operations were immediately suspended and they
identified the source of the leak and shut it in.”  The rig, owned by  Transocean Ltd. (RIG) , was conducting normal
drilling operations at the E-18 11 water injection well,
McConnell said. There were no injuries and no sheen on the
water, and she couldn’t say when drilling would resume.  To contact the reporters on this story:
