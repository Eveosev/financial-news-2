Arabtec Holding Co. (ARTC) , the United
Arab Emirates’ biggest construction company, said Sheikh Butti bin Maktoum Al Maktoum resigned as chairman and will be replaced
by Ibrahim Belselah.
Arabtec also accepted the resignation of board member Sheikh
Sultan bin Saqer Al Qassimi, the Dubai-based company said in a
statement today.  Builders in the U.A.E. are struggling after developers
canceled or delayed half of the real-estate projects planned in
Dubai. Arabtec is among the companies that accepted Islamic
bonds from Nakheel PJSC in lieu of cash after the developer
failed to pay its trade creditors.  Last month, the company reported a 74 percent drop in
second-quarter profit, missing analysts’ estimates, as costs
increased by 91 percent. Credit Suisse Group AG cut Arabtec’s
share-price estimate to 1.34 dirhams from 1.47 dirhams in
September, citing “slowing contract awards and declining
profitability.”  Arabtec shares peaked at 7.86 dirhams on July 24, 2008. The
stock was little changed at 1.36 dirhams as of 12:06 p.m. in
Dubai.  To contact the reporter on this story:
