Israel ’s benchmark  government bonds 
rose, pushing yields lower for the first time in four days, on
speculation the central bank will hold  interest rates  to support
the economy as growth falters.  The yield on the 5 percent Mimshal Shiklit bond due January
2020 dropped two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 4.6
percent at the 4:30 p.m. close in Tel Aviv. The rate on the 5.5
percent bond due in January 2022 fell three basis points to 4.81
percent. The shekel weakened for a second day, declining 0.1
percent to 3.6908 against the dollar.  The Bank of Israel’s monetary tightening cycle has probably
ended as economic growth eases in the U.S. and  Europe , the
country’s main export markets, Governor Stanley Fischer said in
a Bloomberg television interview on Sept. 18. Two-year interest-
rate swaps, an indicator of investor expectations for rates over
the period, fell four basis points to 2.96 percent.  “Investors are buying government bonds on expectations
that borrowing costs will remain on hold for longer amid global
growth concerns,” Guy Lazarovich, a bond trader at IBI-Israel
Brokerage & Investments Ltd. in Tel Aviv, said by telephone.  Italy’s credit rating was cut by  Standard & Poor’s , the
country’s first downgrade in five years, as  Greece ’s worsening
fiscal crisis fans concern that contagion will engulf countries
such as Spain and Italy. Israel’s economy is likely to expand
3.6 percent in 2012, the  International Monetary Fund  said in a
report today, lowering its forecast from 3.8 percent.  The  Bank of Israel  can cut the rate if needed, Fischer said
at a Sept. 18 press conference. The central bank held the
benchmark rate at 3.25 percent for a third month in August,
after 10 increases in the past two years to rein in inflation,
amid signs of slowing economic expansion. The bank’s next rate
decision is scheduled for Sept. 26.  Inflation Expectations  Consumer prices are expected to rise 2.3 percent in the
next 12 months compared with 2.7 percent in the previous
estimate, the average of forecasters surveyed by the central
bank showed, the Bank of Israel said today.  The two-year breakeven rate, which reflects market
expectations for inflation over the time period, rose 10 basis
points to 188, the highest since Sept. 13. The rate, which
implies average annual inflation of 1.88 percent, has soared 31
basis points since Sept. 15 when the Central Bureau of
Statistics said August consumer prices advanced a more than
forecast 0.5 percent from July.  The yield on the CPI-linked bond due in June 2013 dropped
for a third day, declining 10 basis points to 1.18 percent. The
Tel-Bond 40 Index of corporate bonds gained 0.4 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
