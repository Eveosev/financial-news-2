Belarus signed an agreement with
 China  that will enable Chinese companies to participate in the
privatization of Belarusian assets, Kommersant reported.  The accord was signed by  Wu Bangguo , chairman of the
Standing Committee of China’s National People’s Congress, who is
leading a Chinese parliamentary delegation visiting the country,
the Moscow-based newspaper said. Russia, which is also
interested in acquiring control of Belarusian companies, doesn’t
have any such agreement with Belarus, Kommersant said.  Belarusian President Aleksandr Lukashenko is seeking to
sell part of fertilizer producer Belaruskali, which produces 15
percent of the world’s potash. This asset is the most attractive
for Russia, Kommersant said, citing an official in Russian Prime
Minister Vladimir Putin’s administration.  To contact the reporters on this story:
