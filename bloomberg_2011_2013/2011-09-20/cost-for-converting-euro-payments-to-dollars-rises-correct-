The cost for European banks to fund
in dollars surged after  Italy ’s first ratings downgrade in five
years stoked concern lenders will lose money on their euro-
region sovereign debt holdings.  The cost of converting euro payments into dollars, measured
by the three-month cross-currency  basis swap , was 99 basis
points below the euro interbank offered rate at 3:15 p.m. in
London, from 92 basis points yesterday, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The cost was 112.5 basis points under
Euribor on Sept. 12, when the swap was the most expensive since
December 2008.  The cost of one-year dollar funding also climbed, with the
cross-currency basis swap for that period at 71 basis points
less than Euribor, compared with 66 yesterday, Bloomberg data
show. The difference widened to as much as 75 basis points a
week ago.  “It’s all about banks, the critical thing is trying to
manage the euro crisis without it crashing the banks,” said
 Bill Blain , co-head of strategy at broker Newedge Group in
London. “We’ve seen before that, when confidence goes in
banking, it goes very quickly.”  Standard & Poor’s  lowered Italy’s rating last night to A
from A+, saying weak economic growth, a “fragile” government
and rising borrowing costs would make it difficult to reduce
 Europe ’s second-biggest debt. European Union and International
Monetary Fund officials are holding a second conference call
with Greek Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos today as he
tries to convince the organizations his country deserves the
sixth payment of its original 110 billion-euro ($151 billion)
bailout.  Euribor-OIS  The Euribor-OIS spread, the difference between the three-
month euro interbank offered rate and overnight index swaps, was
at 79.9 basis points, from 79.7 yesterday, Bloomberg data show.
That’s within five basis points of the highest level since March
2009, reached Sept. 12.  Three-month Euribor -- the rate banks say they pay for
three-month loans in euros -- was little changed at 1.537
percent from 1.536 percent yesterday. One-week Euribor climbed
to 1.138 percent, from 1.125 percent.  The three-month  London  interbank offered rate, or Libor, in
dollars rose for an eighth straight day, to 0.355 percent from
0.353 percent yesterday, according to the British Bankers’
Association. That’s the biggest daily increase in a week and the
highest rate since Aug. 16, 2010. The dollar Libor-OIS spread
was little changed at 29 basis points, near the highest since
July 2010.  The TED spread, or the difference between what lenders and
the U.S. government pay to borrow for three months, snapped 11
days of increases, falling to 35 basis points from 35.2
yesterday.  The ECB said financial institutions increased overnight
deposits. Banks parked 144.8 billion euros with the ECB
yesterday, compared with 111.5 billion euros on Sept. 16 and
197.8 billion euros on Sept. 12, the Frankfurt-based lender said
in data released overnight.  To contact the reporters on this story:
