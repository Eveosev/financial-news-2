Orix USA Asset Management is
providing $150 million in  seed capital  to two Fortress
Investment Group LLC alumni for a private-equity fund focusing
on health-care and life sciences companies.  The fund, run by New York-based New Health Capital Partners
LLC, will invest in senior secured loans, majority equity stakes
and other forms of structured financing, Orix said today in a
statement.  Richard Baxter and Aron Dantzig, who founded New Health
Capital last year, were most recently co-heads of Fortress’s
health-care group, investing more than $1 billion since 2005. In
exchange for the investment, Orix will take an undisclosed stake
in the management company, said a person familiar with the
matter, who asked not to be named because the fund is private.  “Partnering with Aron and Rich and their team gives Orix
USA Asset Management a unique opportunity to invest in the
health-care and life sciences sectors and further highlights our
commitment to the global asset-management industry,” Michael Blum, president and chief executive, said in the statement.  Orix USA Asset Management, a unit of Tokyo-based Orix
Corp., was formed last year after Orix bought most of Mariner
Investment Group LLC, a hedge fund based in Harrison,  New York .  Orix plans to make more investments, which may include
everything from allocating capital to an existing fund in
exchange for a share of its fee revenue to buying a majority
stake in a money-management firm, Blum said in a telephone
interview.  To contact the reporters on this story:
