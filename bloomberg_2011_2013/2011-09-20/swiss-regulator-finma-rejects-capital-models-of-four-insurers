The  Swiss Financial Markets
Supervisory Authority  has rejected the method used by four
insurers to calculate their solvency.  Finma initially tested the models of those insurers “whose
solvency requires heightened attention,” and will also review
the rest, according to a session of the lower house of the Swiss
parliament published on its  website .  The solvency test introduced in January requires insurers
to provide a mark-to-market valuation of assets and liabilities
that for the first time takes into account their investments.
Half of  Switzerland ’s 140 insurers that need to apply the new
capital rules have adopted Finma’s standard model to calculate
their solvency levels, while the others used provisionally
approved internal models.  To contact the reporter on this story:
