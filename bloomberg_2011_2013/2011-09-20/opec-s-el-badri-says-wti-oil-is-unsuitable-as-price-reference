OPEC Secretary-General Abdalla El- Badri said U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude is
unsuitable as a reference for international oil trading and
North Sea Brent crude isn’t perfect either. The Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries official spoke to reporters in
Dubai today about the widening gap between WTI and Brent.  “In the past, the reference was WTI, and now it is the
reverse. Whoever uses WTI as a reference crude, yes they have
problems. They used to be close together, but now the gap has
widened, so the comparison does not mean anything. This is the
concern of everybody. Another crude reference must be found.
Even Brent is a problem, because the quantity is getting less
and less. A study must be done to see the most suitable price as
a reference. This is a member country business. Each member
country must figure it out by itself.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
