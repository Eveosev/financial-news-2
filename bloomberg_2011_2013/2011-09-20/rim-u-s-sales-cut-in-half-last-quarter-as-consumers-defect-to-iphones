Research In Motion Ltd. (RIMM) ’s sales in
the U.S. fell by 50 percent last quarter, dragging total revenue
lower, as American consumers abandoned older BlackBerry phone
models for  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s iPhones.  Revenue from the U.S. dropped to $1.11 billion from $2.22
billion a year earlier, overshadowing gains in Canada and other
markets, according to a filing released yesterday after the
company reported earnings last week.  RIM plunged 19 percent on Sept. 16 after reporting fiscal
second-quarter profit and sales that missed analysts’ estimates.
Stung by customer defections to the iPhone and handsets that run
on  Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s Android platform, RIM’s share of the global
smartphone market dropped to 12 percent in last quarter from 19
percent a year earlier, according to Gartner Inc.  U.K. sales fell 2.3 percent to $419 million, according to
the filing. Sales in  Canada  climbed 7.7 percent to $308 million
and sales outside the U.S., Canada and the U.K. jumped 38
percent to $2.33 billion.  RIM, based in Waterloo, Ontario, fell 99 cents, or 4.2
percent, to $22.73 at 4 p.m. New York time in Nasdaq Stock
Market trading. The stock has dropped 61 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
