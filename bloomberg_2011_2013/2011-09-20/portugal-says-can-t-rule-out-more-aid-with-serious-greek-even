Portuguese Prime Minister  Pedro Passos Coelho  said he cannot exclude the possibility of a second
aid plan for his country if “something very serious” happens
in  Greece .  Asked if he thinks Portugal will need a second aid program,
Passos Coelho said that “if something very serious happens in
Greece, we cannot exclude those possibilities.” It’s necessary
that the country is meeting and even exceeding the goals of its
financial aid plan, Passos Coelho said today in an interview
with television station RTP.  “If something very negative happens, it’s important that
those that can help us -- reinforcing the aid request namely to
all the financial system, eventually reinforcing the assistance
program itself -- are able to do it convinced that what happened
in Greece will not happen in Portugal,” Passos Coelho said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
