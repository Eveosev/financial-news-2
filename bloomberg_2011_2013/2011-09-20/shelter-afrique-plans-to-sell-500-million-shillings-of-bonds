Shelter Afrique, a Kenya-based
housing-development company, plans to sell 500 million shillings
($5 million) of bonds “early next year,” Managing Director
Alassane Ba said.  Shelter Afrique began trading 2.5 billion shillings of debt
on the Nairobi Stock Exchange today, Ba told reporters today,
without providing the  interest rate  on the notes. The bourse
will publish data for the three-year notes’ performance at the
end of trading daily.  “There are 10 residential development projects with an
estimated project cost of 9.4 billion shillings in  Kenya  that
will be financed from the proceeds of the bond issues,” he
said. “Shelter Afrique has committed to financing 34 percent of
the total project cost.”  The proportion of people living in cities in Kenya, east
 Africa ’s biggest economy, is expected to jump to 60 percent in
2030 from 32 percent in 2009, according to Kenya’s Ministry of
Housing.  House ownership among low-income earners in Kenya’s urban
areas stands at about 16 percent, Housing Minister Soita
Shitanda told reporters at the  Nairobi Stock Exchange  today.  Demand for housing in urban areas is estimated at 200,000
units a year, compared with supply of 60,000, Shitanda said.
Kenya plans to increase supply to 200,000 homes by next year by
providing more land through local government, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
