Austrian central bank Governor
Ewald Nowotny said Hungary’s plan to let Swiss franc-denominated
mortgage holders repay their loans at rates below market levels
won’t destabilize the Alpine republic’s banks, according to an
interview with the Wall Street Journal.  Hungary’s move is “in the spirit of economic populism”
and “violates both the spirit and content of European law,”
Nowotny said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
