Thailand ’s baht traded near the
weakest level in more than two months on concern  Europe ’s
sovereign-debt crisis will hurt global growth, damping demand
for Asian goods.  The baht was little changed, after falling for 10 days,
before a report this week that economists predict will show
annual growth in the nation’s exports slowed to 27.4 percent in
August from 38.3 percent in July. The MSCI Asia-Pacific Index of
shares slid for a second day after  Italy ’s credit rating was cut
one level to A by  Standard & Poor’s , which said the outlook
remains negative.  “Europe’s crisis is spurring sales of riskier assets such
as stocks and emerging-market currencies,” said Tohru Nishihama, an economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute Inc.
in  Tokyo . “ Asia  will be hit through exports as Europe is a
major buyer of goods from here. The region’s currencies will
remain under downward pressure for the time being.”  The baht traded at 30.50 per dollar as of 3:56 p.m. in
Bangkok and touched 30.67, the lowest level since July 4,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The currency may
decline toward 31 by the end of this month, Nishihama said.  Risks to Thailand’s growth have increased as the economic
problems in Europe and the U.S. worsened, Bank of Thailand
Governor Prasarn Trairatvorakul said on Sept. 15. Shipments to
Europe accounted for 9.7 percent of total exports in the first
half of 2011, according to official data.  Global funds sold $279 million more Thai equities than they
bought this month through yesterday, exchange data show.  The yield on the government’s 3.65 percent debt due
December 2021 added 10 basis points, or 0.1 percentage point, to
3.89 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The one-year onshore interest-rate swap, the fixed cost
needed to receive a floating payment, declined 3.5 basis points
to 3.015 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
