Israel  is trying to mend relations
and salvage trade with Turkey amid political tensions that have
been increasing over the past three years, Finance Minister
Yuval Steinitz said.  “We have to make a serious attempt to improve the
situation with Turkey,” Steinitz said in an interview on
Bloomberg Television’s “Surveillance Midday” with Tom Keene.
“It is difficult, but I am confident we will find a way.”  Diplomatic ties between Turkey and Israel, both U.S.
allies, have chilled since Israel’s 2008 invasion of Gaza. They
have grown further strained as Israel has refused to apologize
for a May 2010 commando raid on an aid flotilla bound for the
Gaza Strip that left nine Turks dead.  Steinitz, who was in  New York  for the annual meeting of the
 United Nations General Assembly , said he hopes a solution will
be found to avert a diplomatic crisis over the Palestinian
campaign for statehood recognition. He characterized the Israeli
economy as “very vibrant.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
