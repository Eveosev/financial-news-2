Liberia’s  Supreme Court  told six
political parties, including President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf’s
Unity Party, to halt campaigns for next month’s election until
it rules on residency requirements, documents showed.  The Monrovia-based court will meet today to discuss the
petition filed by Simeon Freeman, a candidate with the Movement
for Progressive Change and other citizens of the West African
nation. They are challenging the eligibility of Johnson Sirleaf
and five others to contest the Oct. 11 vote based on a
constitutional requirement that candidates be resident in
Liberia for at least 10 years, according to the filing.  Liberians rejected a bid to lower the residency requirement
to five years in a referendum last month. The other groups
ordered to stop their campaigns include the Congress for
Democratic Change, the Liberty Party, the National Democratic
Coalition, the National Union for Democratic Progress and the
 Liberia  Transformation Party.  Johnson Sirleaf, 72, became Africa’s first female president
in 2005 and was tasked with rebuilding the country devastated by
civil wars between 1989 and 2003. Eleven people qualified to
contest the vote, the National Elections Commission said Aug.
