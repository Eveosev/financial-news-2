Argentina â€™s government proposed
using $5.7 billion in central bank reserves next year to pay
debt, Infobae.com reported, citing a copy of the draft budget it
posted on its website.  The government budget, which was sent to Congress last
week, sees the peso weakening to 4.4 per dollar by the end of
next year, a  trade surplus  narrowing to $8.6 billion and
inflation of 9.4 percent, Infobae reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
