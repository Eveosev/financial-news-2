A deterioration in  Sweden ’s
economic outlook may warrant interest rate cuts, the central
bank said in the minutes of this month’s policy meeting.  “The possibility that the problems abroad could be greater
than anticipated and could thus have more tangibly negative
effects on the Swedish economy cannot be ruled out,” the
Riksbank said in the minutes of the Sept. 6 meeting published
today. “This could increase the need for more expansionary
monetary policy.”  The bank this month left its benchmark repo rate unchanged
at 2 percent, halting a cycle of seven consecutive increases
since July last year. The bank said fiscal tightening in  Europe 
and the U.S. will slow growth in Swedish economy, where exports
account for about half the output.  The Riksbank this month cut its forecast for  interest
rates , while signaling it may resume increases in the fourth
quarter. Policy makers see the rate averaging 2.1 percent next
quarter, down from 2.3 percent in July. The rate will average
2.4 percent in the third quarter next year, versus 2.9 percent
previously, and 3 percent two years from now, the bank said.  Sweden’s government has slashed its economic and budget
forecasts, while central banks around the world have returned to
crisis mode. The U.S. Federal Reserve last month said it will
probably need to keep its rate near zero until the middle of
2013 while the  European Central Bank  shelved its rate increases
and resumed bond purchases to counter the debt crisis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
