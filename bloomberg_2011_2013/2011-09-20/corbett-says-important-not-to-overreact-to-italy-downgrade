Investors shouldn’t overreact to
 Italy ’s downgrade by Standard & Poor’s, said Richard Corbett, an
aide to European Union President  Herman Van Rompuy .  “We shouldn’t overreact and think this signals somehow a
downward spiral over the whole euro system,” Corbett told
Bloomberg Television from Brussels today. He called the
downgrade a warning to Italy that “can help put pressure on for
further reforms.”  The euro remains a solid currency overall, he said,
pointing to the euro area’s balanced external accounts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
