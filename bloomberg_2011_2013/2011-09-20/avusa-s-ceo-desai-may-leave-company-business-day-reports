Prakash Desai, the chief executive
officer of  Avusa Ltd. (AVU) , may leave the company and be replaced in
an acting capacity by Colin Cary, Business Day reported, without
saying where it got the information.  Desai will today meet with Mikki Xayiya, the acting
chairman, and non-executive director Jacques Schindehutte to
discuss his future, the Johannesburg-based newspaper reported.  Xayiya is also chairman of Mvelaphanda Group, the biggest
shareholder in Avusa. Mvelaphanda backed an abandoned bid by
Capitau Holdings Ltd. to takeover Avusa.  Calls to Avusa’s head office in Johannesburg weren’t
answered outside of normal business hours. Business Day is part
of an equally-owned venture between Avusa and London-based
 Pearson Plc. (PSON)   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
