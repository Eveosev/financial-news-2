Sweden’s economic growth slowed
more than estimated in the second quarter as a global slowdown
damped demand for exports from the largest Nordic economy.  Gross domestic product grew an annual 4.9 percent in the
period, revised from a preliminary 5.3 percent,  Statistics
Sweden  said today. The expansion was 0.9 percent from the first
quarter, compared with an earlier estimate of 1 percent.  Sweden’s growth slowed from an annual 6.1 percen in the
first quarter as a deepening European debt crisis threatens to
erode demand for exports, which make up half the economy. GDP
grew 5.7 percent last year, the most in the European Union, as
exports recovered from the financial crisis and consumers kept
spending following four years of income-tax cuts.  The country’s central bank this month kept its benchmark
lending rate unchanged at 2 percent after raising it seven times
since July last year to prevent the economy from overheating.  To contact the reporter on this story:
