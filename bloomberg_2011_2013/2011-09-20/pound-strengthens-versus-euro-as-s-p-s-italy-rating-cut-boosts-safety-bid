U.K. two-year gilt yields fell to
within half a basis point of a record low after Standard &
Poor’s cut  Italy ’s credit ranking, boosting demand for assets
perceived to be safer.  Ten-year yields dropped to the lowest in a week as the
 International Monetary Fund  lowered its U.K. growth forecast for
this year and next. Bonds were also supported on speculation

show more policy makers joined  Adam Posen  in calling for
additional monetary stimulus, or quantitative easing. The pound
was little changed against the euro and dollar.  “Gilts are benefiting from flight-to-safety flows after
Italy’s downgrade,” said Vatsala Datta, an interest-rate
strategist at Lloyds Bank Corporate Markets in London. “There
are chances that other members might have joined Posen in
calling for more QE. The center of gravity of the committee is
moving towards further easing.”  The two-year gilt yielded 0.54 percent at 4:34 p.m. in
 London , after falling to 0.492 percent earlier today. The rate
slid to 0.49 percent on Sept. 12, the lowest since Bloomberg
began collecting data on the securities in 1992. The 4.5 percent
security due March 2013 traded at a price of 105.765.  The 10-year gilt yield was little changed at 2.39 percent,
after falling to 2.34 percent, the least since Sept. 13.  The IMF cut its forecast for this year’s U.K. growth to 1.1
percent from an earlier projection of 1.5 percent. It trimmed

said, compared with June forecasts of 4.3 percent for 2011 and
4.5 percent for 2012.  September Minutes  The  Bank of England  kept its benchmark rate at a record low
0.5 percent in September and maintained its bond-buying program
at 200 billion pounds ($314 billion).  The Monetary Policy Committee voted 9-0 to leave  interest
rates  unchanged in August, according to minutes of that month’s
meeting released Aug. 17.  Posen called for the central bank on Sept. 13 to buy as
much as 100 billion pounds in securities within three months to
cap borrowing costs and said the delay in acting has made
economic prospects “worse.”  The U.K. plans to sell an inflation-linked bond maturing in
the 50-year area through banks in the second half of October,
the Debt Management Office said today.  Gilts have returned 11 percent this year, according to
indexes compiled by the European Federation of Financial
Analysts Societies and Bloomberg. German debt has gained 8.1
percent and  U.S. Treasuries  rose 8.6 percent, the indexes show.  The pound traded at 87.11 pence per euro from 87.15 pence
