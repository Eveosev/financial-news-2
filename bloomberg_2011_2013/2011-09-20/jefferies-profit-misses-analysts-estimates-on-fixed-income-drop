Jefferies Group Inc. (JEF)  said fiscal
third-quarter profit fell 49 percent on a drop in fixed-income
trading revenue. The stock rose as much as 4.8 percent as the
firm said it would buy back as many as 20 million shares.  Profit for the three months ended Aug. 31 was $23 million,
or 10 cents a share, excluding the acquisition of Prudential
Bache’s global commodities group, the New York-based firm said
today in a statement. The average estimate of eight analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg was for earnings of 20 cents. Net income
was $68.3 million, or 30 cents a share, compared with $44.8
million, or 22 cents, in the same period a year earlier.  Fixed-income trading suffered as corporations pulled back
from the market and investors grappled with fallout from
 Standard & Poor’s  downgrade of the U.S. credit rating. JPMorgan
Chase & Co. and Morgan Stanley said earlier this month that they
were facing a difficult third quarter as well.  “The environment in August was outright brutal,” Richard Handler, chairman and chief executive officer, said in a
conference call after earnings were released. “August was the
third-worst month in the history of the U.S. credit markets
after September and October of 2008.”  Jefferies, which was down 47 percent this year through
yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange, climbed 31 cents, or
2.2 percent to $14.43 at 11:32 a.m.  Buyback Program  The company said its 20 million buyback authorization is in
addition to the 3.1 million shares it purchased during the
quarter. The previous buyback program has 6.7 million shares
remaining, Jefferies said.  “They’re sending a signal that they think their stock is
very undervalued,” said Lauren Smith, an analyst with New York-
based KBW Inc. who has an “outperform” rating on Jefferies
shares. “They can be out there buying back stock and I
absolutely expect that’s what they will be doing, which is good
for shareholders and should be good for the stock price.  Net revenue fell 1.5 percent to $509.3 million from $517.3
million a year earlier. Analysts had expected revenue of $618.8
million, according to the Bloomberg survey.  Revenue from sales and trading decreased 21 percent to
$212.4 million. Revenue from fixed-income trading, led by
William Jennings and Johan Eveland, fell 80 percent to $33.1
million. Revenue from trading equities increased 16 percent to
$126.9 million from $109.3 million in the year-earlier period.  Investment Banking   Investment-banking revenue increased 19 percent to $293.8
million from $246.2 million in the same period last year.  “While we are disappointed with our third-quarter trading
results, we are extremely pleased with the overall position of
our firm today,” Handler said. “Our third-quarter results
reflect the unique period of dislocation and are not indicative
of where our firm is positioned today.”  The firm increased its headcount by about 29 percent since
last year to 3,842 employees. The pace of hiring will probably
slow, Handler said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
