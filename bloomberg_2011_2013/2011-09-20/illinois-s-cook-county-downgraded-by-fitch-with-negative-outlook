Cook County, home of Chicago, had
its bonds downgraded by  Fitch Ratings  today, which cited 
“diminished financial flexibility,” and revised its outlook to 
negative from stable.  Fitch assigned an AA- rating, the fourth-highest investment
grade, to $179 million in series 2011A general obligation
refunding bonds; $210 million in 2011B taxable bonds; $125
million in 2011C taxable bonds; and $110 million in 2011D
taxable notes. The bonds had previously been rated AA, one step
higher.  “The negative outlook reflects Fitch’s concern that
spending pressures coupled with reliance upon economically
sensitive taxes will continue to strain the county’s ability to
achieve structural balance and build reserves in the
intermediate term,” Fitch said in a statement.  Cook County, the nation’s second most populous, projects a
structural budget imbalance over the next several fiscal years.
Fitch said pension liabilities are “notable, and annual funding
remains weak.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
