Britain and  Poland  want “radical
reform” of the European Union’s Common Agricultural
Policy, with farmers more dependent on market prices, the U.K.
Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said.  The U.K. wants farm production subsidies to be reduced,
according to the statement issued by Jim Paice, U.K. Agriculture
Minister, and Marek Sawicki, Poland’s Agriculture Minister,
after an EU agriculture meeting in Brussels. The statement was
issued on the Defra website today.  The European Commission is expected to publish its
proposals on CAP reforms next month, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
