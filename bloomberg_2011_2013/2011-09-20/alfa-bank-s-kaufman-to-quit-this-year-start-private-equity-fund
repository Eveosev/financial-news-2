Ed Kaufman, head of  investment
banking  at Alfa Bank, said he will leave at the end of the year
to start a private equity fund.  Kaufman, 46, plans to join the board of Alfa in  Russia  and
Ukraine. The banker, a U.S. citizen, was lured to Alfa, Russia’s
largest private lender, in March 2007 for a $20 million package
over three years depending on targets, two people familiar with
the hiring said at the time. He had been head of investment
banking at UBS AG in Moscow.  “I will be at Alfa until the end of the year,” Kaufman
said late yesterday in e-mailed comments. “Then I will be
setting up a private equity and special situations fund. It will
be for independent investors.”  Kaufman declined to say how big the fund will be, what it
will invest in or whether he had yet secured commitments from
investors. Alfa hasn’t made a commitment, he said.  Alfa Bank  spokesman Leonid Ignat declined to comment when
called by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
