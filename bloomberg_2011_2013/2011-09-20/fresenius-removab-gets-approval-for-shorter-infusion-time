Fresenius Biotech’s Removab
received approval from the European Commission for a shorter
infusion time in treating malignant ascites, the company said in
an e-mailed statement today.  The infusion time for Removab can be halved, from six to
three hours, the statement said, adding that the approval allows
marketing of follow-up results for the pivotal study in patients
with malignant ascites showing that the one-year survival rate
in Removab-treated patients was more than four times higher than
in the control group.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
