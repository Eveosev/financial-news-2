Hungary’s plans to raise the value-
added tax rate next year will delay meeting the central bank’s 3
percent inflation target, central bank President Andras Simor
said today.  The central bank now sees meeting the goal in the first
half of 2013, Simor said. Previously, the central bank forecast
meeting the goal next year.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
