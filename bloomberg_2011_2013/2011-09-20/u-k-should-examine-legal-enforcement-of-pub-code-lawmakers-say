U.K. pub companies have not shown a
“commitment to reform” in order to reach voluntary codes of
practice with lessees and the government should consult on how
to enforce the code legally, lawmakers said today.  “In many areas we do not believe there has been a genuine
commitment to reform,” the Business, Innovation and Skills
Committee, headed by Adrian Bailey said in a report released
today. Government promises to “consult on how to put the code
on a statutory footing,” should begin as a “matter of
urgency.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
