The Swiss government lowered its
economic-growth forecasts for this year and next, calling the
franc still “very highly valued” after the central bank
imposed a currency ceiling against the euro.  Swiss gross domestic product will rise 1.9 percent this
year and 0.9 percent in 2012, the State Secretariat for Economic
Affairs in Bern said in an e-mailed  statement  today. In June, it
had forecast the economy to expand 2.1 percent and 1.5 percent
this year and next, respectively.  The Swiss economy is showing increasing signs of a slowdown
after expanding in the second quarter at the weakest pace since
emerging from a 2009 recession. The central bank on Sept. 15
reiterated its pledge to defend a franc ceiling of 1.20 versus
the euro to protect exports, while leaving borrowing costs at
zero. Exports slumped 7 percent in August from the previous
month, a government report showed today.  “The unfavorable constellation of the economic weakness
and the strong franc may temporarily cause economic growth in
Switzerland to drop,” the state secretariat said. “Isolated
quarters of economic contraction are possible. On the other
hand, the expert group thinks it’s unlikely that  Switzerland 
will slip into a deep recession.”  The franc was little changed after the report, trading at
1.2061 versus the euro at 8:06 a.m. in Zurich. The Swiss
currency had reached a record 1.0075 on Aug. 9.  Swiss exports may rise 3.2 percent this year and 0.7
percent in 2012, according to today’s report. That’s down from a
previous estimate of 4.6 percent and 3 percent, respectively.
Unemployment may average 3.4 percent next year, up from 3.1
percent in 2011, the state secretariat said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
