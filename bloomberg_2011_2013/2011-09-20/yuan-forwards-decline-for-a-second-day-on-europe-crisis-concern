The yuan gained after U.S.
Ambassador Gary Locke urged  China ’s policy makers to let the
currency appreciate more rapidly.  Efforts to rein in inflation would be aided by letting the
yuan strengthen faster, Locke told U.S. business executives in
Beijing today. Consumer prices climbed 6.2 percent from a year
earlier in August, compared with 6.5 percent in July, official
data showed on Sept. 9. China will maintain “relatively high”
growth over the next 10 years, the Financial News reported today,
citing Kim Eng Tan, a Singapore-based sovereign-ratings analyst
at Standard and Poor’s.  “‘Yuan appreciation could be the preferred tool over
interest-rate hikes for China to tame inflation,” said Daniel Chan, chief economist at BWC Capital Markets in  Hong Kong .
“Domestic growth will remain resilient despite uncertainties in
the global economy. China also faces some international pressure
to allow more currency gains.”  The yuan strengthened 0.04 percent to close at 6.3843 per
dollar in  Shanghai , according to the China Foreign Exchange
Trade System. The People’s Bank of China set the  reference rate 
0.05 percent weaker at 6.3880 per dollar. The currency is
allowed to trade up to 0.5 percent on either side of the daily
reference rate.  In Hong Kong’s offshore market, the yuan rose 0.07 percent
to 6.3885. Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards were little
changed at 6.3440, a 0.6 percent premium to the onshore spot
rate, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
