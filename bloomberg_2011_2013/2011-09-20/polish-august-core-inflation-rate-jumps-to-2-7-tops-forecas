Polandâ€™s core inflation rate rose
to 2.7 percent in August from 2.4 percent in July, the first
increase in four months, the Warsaw-based Narodowy Bank Polski
said on its website today. That figure exceeded the 2.4 percent
median estimate of 24 economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  The core inflation rate accelerated to 0.2 percent on the
month, compared with a median estimate of 0.1 percent in a
Bloomberg survey of 13 economists.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
