Malaysian inflation has peaked and
stabilized after accelerating in September, central bank
Governor Zeti Akhtar Aziz told reporters in  Kuala Lumpur  today.  Consumer prices rose 3.4 percent from a year earlier after
climbing 3.3 percent in August, the Putrajaya-based statistics
department said on Oct. 21. Central bank policy makers left
 interest rates  unchanged at 3 percent for a third straight
meeting on Nov. 11, seeking to support growth as Europeâ€™s debt
crisis curbs demand for Asian exports.  To contact the reporter on this story:
