Merck & Co. (MRK)  reduced the price of
AIDS drug Isentress for U.S. state programs that provide
antiviral medicines to lower-income people who have limited or
no insurance.  The price cut will happen on Jan. 1 and be effective
through the end of 2013, the  Whitehouse Station , New Jersey
drugmaker said in a statement today. The company isn’t releasing
the amount of the reduction, Pamela Eisele, a Merck spokeswoman,
said in a telephone interview.  Merck is the sixth  drug company  to provide additional
discounts for state AIDS programs in recent months, said Murray
Penner, deputy executive director for the  National Alliance of
State and Territorial AIDS Directors,  a nonprofit group in
 Washington . While the state AIDS drug assistance programs serve
200,000 people, as of Dec. 15 there were  4,333  people in 12
states on waiting lists who qualify yet haven’t received
assistance because of budget limitations, he said.  “With the economy the way it is there are many more people
without jobs and many more people who are qualifying for the
programs,” Penner said in a telephone interview. “The need has
ballooned.”  The other drugmakers offering enhanced discounts are
 Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) ;  Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. (BMY) ; Gilead Sciences
Inc.; Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH; and ViiV Healthcare, a venture
between  Pfizer Inc. (PFE)  and GlaxoSmithkline Plc, Penner said.  Also today, the U.S.  Food and Drug Administration   approved
Isentress  for use in children ages 2 to 18. The medicine has
been approved for use in adults since October 2007.  To contact the reporter on this story:
