Hungary ’s benchmark BUX stock  index 
rose 2.1 percent to 19,147.54 by the close in Budapest. The
following were among the most active equities in the Hungarian
market today. Stock symbols follow company names.  OTP Bank Nyrt. (OTP)  , Hungary’s largest lender, pared
its weekly decline as the country’s stocks advanced on
speculation  Greece  will get a second bailout and as Hungary
worked to obtain its own rescue. The shares climbed 1.9 percent
to 3,945 forint.  Magyar Telekom Nyrt. (MTEL)  , Hungary’s former phone
monopoly, increased the most since May 2010 as a drop in
government bond yields made the company’s dividends more
appealing to investors, according to Concorde Ertekpapir Zrt.
The shares rallied 5.5 percent to 573 forint.  To contact the reporter on this story:
