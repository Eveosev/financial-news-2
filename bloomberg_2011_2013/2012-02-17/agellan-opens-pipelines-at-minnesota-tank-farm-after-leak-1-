Magellan Midstream Partners LP (MMP) ,
owner of fuel pipelines stretching from the Gulf Coast to  North
Dakota , said it reopened lines that were shut Feb. 14 at the
Apple Valley tank farm in  Minnesota  after a gasoline leak.  Excavation of soil and cleanup following the spill of
62,034 gallons are expected to continue for the foreseeable
future, Bruce Heine, a company spokesman based in Tulsa,
Oklahoma, said in an e-mail. The fuel leaked when a line flange
gasket failed.  “We have maintained adequate supplies of gasoline and
diesel fuel throughout the northern tier of our distribution
system, which includes the state of Minnesota,” Heine said.  The Apple Valley tank farm has a storage capacity of
approximately 500,000 barrels, he said. Pipelines from Apple
Valley generally transport refined products to the northern part
of the Magellan system, he said.  No injuries, evacuations or road closures resulted from the
spill, Heine said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
