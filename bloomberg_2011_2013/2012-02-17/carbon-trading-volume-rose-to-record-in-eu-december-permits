Carbon trading in benchmark December
European Union emissions permits had the busiest ever day
yesterday as prices surged.  The volume of EU December 2012 carbon futures leaped 64
percent to a record 30,928 lots, or 30.9 million metric tons, on
ICE Futures  Europe  in  London . Open interest, or the number of
outstanding contracts, rose by 1.4 percent to 353.1 million
tons, exchange data show. The contract’s price rose 7.7 percent
yesterday, its biggest gain since Dec. 20.  “New positions have been initiated as prices rallied,”
which is evidence of new entrants into the marketplace, Brett
Genus, a broker and technical analyst at OTC Europe LLP in
London, said today by e-mail. This may indicate that traders
opened long positions in a bet prices may rise further, he said.  Permits have advanced 18 percent this week to 9.30 euros a
metric ton as of 12:31 p.m. in London, exchange data show.
That’s the highest price since Nov. 22.  To contact the reporter on this story:
