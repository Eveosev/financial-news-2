The euro may fall toward its lowest
level in more than two years against the dollar after dropping
below a key support level, Bank of America Corp. said, citing
trading patterns.  The 17-nation currency’s slide below $1.3026 yesterday
confirmed its decline through the 21-day moving average and
signals a “larger bear trend,” according to a report by
 MacNeil Curry , the bank’s New York-based head of foreign-
exchange and interest-rates technical strategy.  “The subsequent close through the 21-day and break of
$1.3026 intra-day pivot points to a resumption of the larger
bear trend targeting $1.2644/$1.2510 area support,” Curry wrote
in the research note published yesterday. Support is where buy
orders may be clustered.  The euro traded at $1.3134 as of 9:42 a.m. in  Tokyo  from
$1.3130 in  New York  yesterday, when it fell to as low as
$1.2974, the weakest since Jan. 25. The $1.2644 level was last
seen on Jan. 16, when the currency retreated to $1.2626. The
euro last touched $1.2510 on July 6, 2010, when it weakened to
$1.2480.  The shared currency’s 21-day moving average was at $1.3137.
Its moving average convergence/divergence, or MACD, was at
0.0036, below the signal line of 0.0045, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. A reading below the signal line indicates
the euro may decline.  MACD is a gauge of momentum and is calculated by
subtracting the 26-day exponential moving average from the 12
day average. The signal line is a nine-day exponential moving
average of the MACD , and provides buy and sell signals.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
