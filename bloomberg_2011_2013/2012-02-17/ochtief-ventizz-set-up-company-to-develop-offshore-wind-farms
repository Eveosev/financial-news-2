Hochtief AG (HOT) , Germany’s biggest
builder, set up a company with Ventizz Capital Partners to
develop offshore wind farms.  The joint venture would sell projects after “readying the
subsequent construction of the wind farms in a way that
significantly reduces the risk of cost overruns and delays,”
Hochtief said in an e-mailed statement today.  Germany plans to install 10,000 megawatts of turbines off
its coast this decade to help replace its nuclear reactors,
which are to shut by 2022. Hochtief, with 20 billion euros ($26
billion) of sales in 2010, could lend financial power to
projects that can cost as much as 1.5 billion euros.  Hochtief seeks to purchase at least two wind farm
concessions off  Germany , Ullrich Reinke, head of energy and
infrastructure at the company’s Solutions unit, said in
November.  To contact the reporter on this story:
