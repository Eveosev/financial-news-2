The average operating rate of U.S.
plants that make chlorine and caustic soda rose to 85 percent in
January, the highest output level in five months, a trade group
said.  The industry’s average operating rate for plants that make
the chemicals known as chlor-alkali rose from 79 percent in
December,  The Chlorine Institute , based in Arlington,  Virginia ,
said today in an e-mail. Plants on average ran at 86 percent of
capacity in August.  Chlorine is used to make vinyl products such as siding and
polyvinyl chloride pipe. Caustic soda, produced in tandem with
chlorine, is used to make pulp, paper and soap.  Dow Chemical Co. (DOW) 
is the world’s largest maker of chlor-alkali, followed by
 Occidental Petroleum Corp. (OXY) ,  Olin Corp. (OLN)  and  PPG Industries Inc. (PPG)   To contact the reporter on this story:
