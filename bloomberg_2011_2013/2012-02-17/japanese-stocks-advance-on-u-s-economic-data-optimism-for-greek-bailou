Japanese  stocks  rose after the yen
fell to a four-month low as investment banks including Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. projected the currency will continue to slide,
and U.S. economic reports beat expectations, boosting the
outlook for exporters.  Honda Motor Co. (7267) , a carmaker that gets almost 85 percent of
its sales abroad, rose 2.4 percent.  Nikon Corp. (7731) , a camera maker
that counts on  Europe  for 23 percent of its revenue, climbed 3.9
percent as optimism rose that  Greece  will secure a debt bailout.
 Inpex Corp. (1605) , Japan’s top oil explorer by market value, jumped
4.8 percent after crude prices advanced.  The  Nikkei 225 Stock Average  rose 1.6 percent to 9,384.17
at 3 p.m. in  Tokyo , its highest close since Aug. 4. The broader
Topix Index gained 1.3 percent to 810.45, with a weekly gain of
4 percent. More than twice as many shares rose as fell on the
equity gauge.  “Japanese company earnings are unlikely to get worse while
the yen’s advance against the dollar is reversing and the  U.S.
economy  is recovering,” said Hisakazu Amano, who helps oversee
the equivalent of $29 billion at T&D Asset Management Co. in
Tokyo. “Uncertainties on European debt issues are subsiding.”  U.S. Data  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  fell 0.1 percent
today. The index advanced 1.1 percent in  New York  yesterday
after reports showed Americans filed the fewest claims for
jobless benefits since March 2008 and builders broke ground on
more houses than expected.  Manufacturing (OUTFGAF)  in the Philadelphia
region expanded this month at the fastest pace in four months as
orders and sales rose.  Stocks also advanced after euro-area officials said the
 European Central Bank  is swapping its Greek bonds for new
securities to prevent losses in a debt restructuring. European
governments are mulling cutting  interest rates  on emergency
loans to Greece and using contributions from the ECB to plug a
financing gap in the second bailout for  Athens , people familiar
with the discussions said.  “It’s a distinct improvement from the fourth quarter last
year from the perspective of investor confidence and risk
appetite,” said Prasad Patkar, who helps manage about $1
billion at Platypus Asset Management Ltd. in Sydney. “When
there’s a bit of relief from the European front, the markets can
focus on fundamentals, which seem to be improving by the day.”  Exporters Advance  Honda,  Japan ’s second-largest carmaker by revenue, gained
2.4 percent to 2,950 yen. Nikon rose 3.9 percent to 2,127 yen.  Exporters extended gains as the yen fell against the dollar,
the weakest since Oct. 31. The currency’s slide accelerated as
investment banks from Goldman Sachs Group to JP Morgan Chase &
Co. today said the yen will continue to weaken after the  Bank of
Japan  unexpectedly expanded an asset-purchase program this week.
