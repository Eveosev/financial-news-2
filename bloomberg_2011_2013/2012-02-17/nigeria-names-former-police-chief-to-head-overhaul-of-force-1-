Nigeria named Parry Osayande, a
former police chief, as head of a committee to reorganize the
country’s police force, three weeks after appointing a new
inspector-general.  The nine-member committee is tasked with improving
efficiency and effectiveness and will “primarily redress the
rot in the Nigeria Police Force and reposition it to face the
challenges of a democratic society,” Vice President  Namadi Sambo  said today in an e-mailed statement from Abuja, the
capital.  President Goodluck Jonathan on Jan. 25 appointed Mohammed Abubakar as the acting police boss, firing Hafiz Ringim a week
after Kabiru Umar, who is suspected of masterminding the
Christmas Day bombing of a church near Abuja that killed 43
people, escaped from police custody. Sokoto was re-arrested on
Feb. 10 in the northeastern Taraba state.  Authorities in  Africa ’s top oil producer blame Boko Haram,
whose name means “Western education is a sin,” for a series of
attacks targeting government buildings, security forces and
churches in the mainly Muslim north and Abuja in the past year.  The group claimed responsibility for bomb and gun attacks
on the northern city of Kano on Jan. 21 which police said killed
184 people. Civil Rights Congress, a rights group that
participated in the rescue of victims, said 256 people died.  To contact the reporter on this story:
