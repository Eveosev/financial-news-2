AllianceBernstein Holding LP (AB) , a
money management firm that has suffered client withdrawals for
the past four years, cut 90 jobs this week, or about 2 percent
of its workforce.  The cuts included 30 investment professionals, both
portfolio managers and analysts,  John Meyers , a spokesman for
the New York-based company, said in a telephone interview.
“This was done to better align our resources with recent trends
in asset levels,” he said.  AllianceBernstein, which is publicly traded, fell the most
in almost three years Feb. 10 after the firm reported a fourth-
quarter loss and said clients pulled $13.2 billion in the
quarter.  Over the past four years, customers have withdrawn more
than $200 billion, much of it coming from the company’s
institutional equity business. In a statement announcing fourth
quarter earnings, Chief Executive Officer  Peter Kraus  referred
to the money manager’s “ongoing investment underperformance in
our largest equity services.”  AllianceBernstein declined 1.5 percent to close at $13.61
in New York trading. The firm’s shares have lost 40 percent in
the past 12 months, while climbing 4.1 percent this year.  AllianceBernstein managed $421 billion as of Jan. 31, the
company reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
