Investor  Jim Rogers  has a very specific reason for not buying Japanese  government bonds : extinction. The Singapore-based chairman of Rogers Holdings can't fathom how a $5.5 trillion economy can, in the long run, avoid defaulting on a roughly $12 trillion debt with a shrinking population. A few years back, he concluded: "If the current birth rate, which is the lowest in the major developed countries, continues, there will be no Japanese. Who will pay the enormous debt?" It's a valid question, especially as the nation's deflationary funk, a product of the 1990 bursting of its economic bubble, deepens. More and more, markets are buzzing about the chances of Japan becoming the next  Greece . That's unlikely because about 95 percent of government debt is held domestically. While this factoid is  well known , one particular possibility it affords  Japan  isn't: debt forgiveness on a national, and indeed unprecedented, scale. Yes, if things unraveled the way the bears expect, Japan could always appeal to nationalist tendencies for survival. Is that an unlikely event? Yes. A tough sell? Absolutely. But my sense is that if Japan were facing the kind of financial Armageddon some fear, such a step isn't beyond the realm of possibility. Greece is having trouble getting foreigners to take a haircut on its bonds. Japan might have more success getting its masses to take losses on the piles of public debt stashed under the tatami mats. For all its problems -- weak growth, deflation, ugly demographics, political paralysis -- Japanese are still sitting on about $15 trillion of household savings. That steady demand for bonds is why 10-year yields are just 0.94 percent. One of the most moving sights I've ever seen was the gold donations in  South Korea  in 1998, just after the nation received a humiliating multibillion-dollar bailout from the  International Monetary Fund . The "Collect Gold for the Love of  Korea "  campaign  saw millions voluntarily turn over the family jewels to the government to help the economy. The bears should remember that if Japan does fall off a proverbial cliff, the nation enjoys the ultimate financial backstop: 126 million people who want Japan to survive.
