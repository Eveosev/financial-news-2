General Mills Inc. (GIS) , the maker of
Cheerios cereal and Yoplait yogurt, reduced its earnings
forecast for this year, citing “weak” demand in the U.S.  Profit for 2012 will be $2.53 a share to $2.55 a share, the
Minneapolis-based company said today in a statement. Previously,
General Mills predicted $2.59 a share to $2.61 a share. Analysts
projected $2.60, the average of  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  General Mills said “weak volume performance” across U.S.
retail food categories in December and January hurt results in
its fiscal third quarter. Yesterday,  J.M. Smucker Co. (SJM) , the maker
of its namesake jams, said its full-year profit may be less than
previously forecast because of lower consumer demand.  General Mills  fell  4.5 percent to $38 at 7:55 a.m. in  New
York . The shares rose 14 percent last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
