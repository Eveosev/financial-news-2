Wuerth Gruppe, a privately owned
German maker of screws, adhesives and other fasteners, expects
sales this year will exceed 10 billion euros ($13.1 billion) for
the first time, the  Berliner Zeitung  reported, citing an
interview with the company’s founder, Reinhold Wuerth.  Sales this year are being helped by a weaker euro that’s
boosting exports, the newspaper cited Wuerth as saying.  --Andrew Atkinson, Alan Crawford  To contact the reporter on this story:
