Encana Corp. (ECA) ,  Canada ’s biggest
natural-gas producer, will scale back investment and cut output
to reduce North American supplies by as much as 600 million
cubic feet a day in a bid to boost prices for the heating and
power-plant fuel.  The company will immediately halt 250 million cubic feet a
day from wells, Chief Executive Officer Randy Eresman said in a
statement today. Spending for 2012 will drop about 37 percent to
$2.9 billion, reducing output by another 250 million cubic feet
a day from last year. The remaining cut is in the form of gas
used as royalties, the Calgary-based company said.  Encana’s reductions come on the heels of similar moves by
North American competitors.  Chesapeake Energy Corp. (CHK)  said on Jan.
23 it would idle drilling rigs and reduce spending in gas fields
by 70 percent.  EQT Corp. (EQT)  announced three days earlier that it
will suspend drilling in its Huron Field in  Kentucky .  “Natural- gas prices  in North American look set to remain
weak through 2012 and beyond,” Terry Marshall and a group of
Moody’s Investors Service analysts wrote in a report today.
Producers will cut gas spending by at least 40 percent this year
and the number of wells drilled by at least half, they wrote.  Gas futures posted their first weekly gain since January,
rising 4.6 percent to settle at $2.685 per million British
thermal units on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Average gas
prices in  New York  fell 13 percent to $3.476 per million British
thermal units in the fourth quarter from a year earlier. Prices
reached $13.577 in 2008.  Prices ‘Below Costs’  “It is abundantly clear that a continued reduction of
drilling activity will be required to restore market balance,”
Encana said in the statement. “For the industry as a whole,
near-term natural-gas prices are at levels below what it costs
to add most new production.”  In a separate statement, Encana said Tokyo-based  Mitsubishi
Corp. (8058)  agreed to pay C$1.45 billion ($1.46 billion) for a 40
percent interest in its Cutbank Ridge gas assets in northeastern
British Columbia. Mitsubishi will pay another C$1.45 billion
over five years for development costs. Encana said it will cut
spending elsewhere to reduce the deal’s impact on gas supplies.  Joint-venture agreements to develop shale-gas resources and
continuing gas production from “wet” fields, drilled to get
access to propane and ethane, will mean a “slight increase” in
supply this year, Moody’s wrote. Encana will “almost certainly
have the liquidity necessary to withstand this lean period” of
gas prices, according to the note.  Encana reported fourth-quarter net loss narrowed to $246
million, or 33 cents a share, from $469 million, or 64 cents, a
year earlier. Sales rose 72 percent to $2.46 billion.  The shares, which have seven “buy,” three “sell” and 17
“hold” ratings from analysts,  fell  0.9 percent to C$19.97 at
the close in Toronto.  To contact the reporter on this story:
