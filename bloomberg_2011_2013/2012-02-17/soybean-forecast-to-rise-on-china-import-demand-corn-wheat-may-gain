What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Soybean futures may open 10 cents to 15 cents a bushel higher
on the Chicago Board of Trade after the government announced
sales of the oilseed to  China ,  Don Roose , the president of U.S.
Commodities Inc. in  West Des Moines ,  Iowa , said in a telephone
interview.  Soybean-oil  futures may open 0.4 cent to 0.5 cent a
pound higher, and soybean-meal futures may open up $2 to $3 per
2,000 pounds.  -- Corn futures are called to open 4 cents to 5 cents a bushel
higher in Chicago on signs that demand is improving for U.S.
exports, Roose said.  -- Wheat futures may open 7 cents to 8 cents a bushel higher on
the CBOT, the Kansas City Board of Trade and the  Minneapolis
Grain Exchange  after U.S. exporters boosted sales to Egypt
yesterday and unknown buyers today, Roose said.
