First Solar Inc. (FSLR) , the biggest maker
of thin-film solar panels, climbed the most in three weeks after
resolving a Los Angeles County permitting issue for a $1.36
billion power project, paving the way for financing to resume.  First Solar  rose  7.3 percent to $42.59 at the close in  New
York , the biggest gain since Jan. 27. Shares of the Tempe,
Arizona-based company have gained 26 percent this year.  Construction of the Antelope Valley Solar Ranch One plant
is partially funded by a $646 million U.S. Energy Department
loan guarantee. That financing was frozen after county
regulators put the projectâ€™s permit on hold, the company said in
a Feb. 9 filing.  Funds from the loan guarantee should begin flowing in
coming weeks, Dan Ries, an analyst at Collins Stewart LLC, said
in a note to clients today.  First Solar sold the 230-megawatt Antelope Valley Solar
Ranch One plant to  Exelon Corp. (EXC)  for $75 million in September.
The Chicago-based power company said it would invest as much as
$713 million into the project.  To contact the reporter on this story:
