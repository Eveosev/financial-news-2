Demand for three-year loans from the
 European Central Bank  will increase to a record amount at the
next offering on Feb. 28, UBS AG said, citing a survey.  Euro-area banks will borrow 629 billion euros ($826
billion) from the ECB, according to the median of 317 forecasts
in the UBS survey. The ECB allocated a record 489 billion euros
in the first three-year tender in December. Forecasts for the
second tender ranged from zero to 3 trillion euros, with two-
thirds between 400 billion euros and 800 billion euros, UBS
said. Its own estimate is 492 billion euros.  The ECB will allocate the funds on Feb. 29. It charges the
average of its  benchmark rate  -- currently 1 percent -- over the
period of the loan and banks have the option of repaying after
one year. The ECB also satisfies all bids against eligible
collateral, leaving the ultimate amount of money it lends in the
hands of the banks asking for the funds.  ECB President  Mario Draghi  has said the first three-year
loan helped avert a credit crunch as the region’s debt crisis
makes banks wary of lending. Yields on  government bonds  across
the 17-nation euro region have also dropped, suggesting banks
are using some of the money to invest in sovereign debt.  UBS chief European economist Stephane Deo said an allotment
of more than 500 billion euros in the second operation “would
represent banks over-funding” and using the money “to carry
trade.”  Of the 317 survey participants, 132 were from UBS, the bank
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
