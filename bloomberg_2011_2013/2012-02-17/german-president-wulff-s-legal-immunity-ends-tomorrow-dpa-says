German President  Christian Wulff ’s
legal immunity will be lifted tomorrow, allowing prosecutors to
investigate alleged abuse of office, the  Deutsche Presse Agentur 
reported, citing the spokesman for the prosecutor’s office in
Hanover, Hans-Juergen Lendeckel.  Wulff announced his resignation today after prosecutors
said they wanted to investigate allegations he accepted illicit
favors during his tenure as governor of  Lower Saxony  before he
became head of state. Wulff said he had done nothing illegal and
was convinced any legal action would lead to a “complete
discharge.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
