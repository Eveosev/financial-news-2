Greek state-controlled natural gas
supplier  DEPA SA  said the company is ensuring the smooth
provision of gas to households, businesses and industry even as
imported supplies are being reduced.  Severe winter weather conditions across  Europe  and a sudden
decrease, with the prospect of a possible halt, in imports from
 Turkey ’s Botas AS led to a fall in gas supplies to  Greece  as
demand in the country hit daily record highs, Athens-based DEPA
said in an e-mailed statement late yesterday.  Recent demand in Greece peaked to the equivalent of between
230,000 and 250,000 megawatt-hours a day, from a high of 180,000
in the same period last year, according to the statement.  Turkey’s natural gas supply from Iran and Azerbaijan fell
to about a seventh of its daily 40 million cubic meters due to
breakdowns in both countries, Turkish Energy Minister  Taner Yildiz  said Feb. 7.  DEPA said it recently secured six special deliveries of
liquefied natural gas and a seventh shipment is due to arrive
tomorrow, even as such purchases are increasingly scarce across
Europe given higher demand.  DEPA will continue to work to ensure supplies via its long-
term contracts for 1.6 billion cubic meters of Russian gas a
year from  OAO Gazprom (GAZP) , for 750 million cubic meters annually of
Azeri gas via Botas and for 850 million cubic meters of LNG a
year from Algeria’s Groupe Sonatrach, according to the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
