India ’s 10-year bonds headed for a
second weekly decline on speculation fewer funds in the banking
system will reduce demand for debt.  Lenders borrowed an  average  1.3 trillion rupees ($26.4
billion) a day from the central bank this year to meet cash
shortages, more than double the 600 billion rupees “comfort
zone” indicated by the  Reserve Bank  of India in its Jan. 24
policy statement. A rise in oil prices to near a six-week high
may also pressure Indian refiners to increase fuel costs,
according to Paresh Nayar, head of money-market and currency
trading at FirstRand Bank.  “People are concerned about the liquidity shortage,”
Mumbai-based Nayar said. “Inflation worries may resurface with
 oil prices  inching up again.”  The yield on the 8.79 percent notes due November 2021 rose
one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, this week and today
to 8.21 percent as of 9:55 a.m. in Mumbai, according to the
central bank’s trading system.  The finance ministry will sell 120 billion rupees of
 government bonds  due in 2018, 2021 and 2041 today.  Crude for March delivery was at $102.45 a barrel on the  New
York Mercantile Exchange  after closing at $102.31 yesterday.
India imports about 80 percent of its oil needs.  India’s  inflation  slowed to the lowest level in 26 months
in January. The wholesale-price index rose 6.55 percent,
compared with 7.47 percent in December, according to official
data. The rate held above 9 percent in the previous 12 months.  The cost of one-year interest-rate swaps, or derivative
contracts used to guard against fluctuations in funding costs,
fell five basis points this week to 8.08 percent, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
