The Canadian dollar rose versus its
U.S. counterpart as a government report showed the inflation
rate increased last month more than forecast, supporting the
case for higher  interest rates .  The Canadian currency was headed for a rally this week as
investor appetite for risk increased on speculation Greece,
where  Europe ’s sovereign-debt crisis began more than two years
ago, will win a second international rescue to avert a default.  The loonie, as the currency is also known for the image of
the aquatic bird on the C$1 coin, appreciated 0.1 percent to
99.56 cents per U.S. dollar at 7:02 a.m. Toronto time.  The  consumer price index  rose 2.5 percent in January from a
year earlier after December’s 2.3 percent gain, Ottawa-based
 Statistics Canada  said. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg News
predicted the rate to stay at the previous level, according to
the median of 24 estimates.  The Bank of  Canada  has held its  overnight rate  at 1 percent
since September 2010, the longest stretch since it began
targeting that interest rate in 1994.  Growth in Canada and the U.S. will be “more modest” than
previously forecast as Europe struggles to contain its debt
crisis, the Ottawa-based bank said Jan. 17 in a statement after
its last rate meeting.  The bank said Canada’s economy will return to full output
and the pace of price increases will accelerate back to its 2
percent target in the third quarter of 2013, one quarter earlier
than it had forecast.  To contact the reporter on this story:
