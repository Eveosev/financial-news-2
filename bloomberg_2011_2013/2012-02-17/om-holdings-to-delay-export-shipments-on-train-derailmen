OM Holdings Ltd. (OMH) , an Australian
manganese producer, said it may delay up to three export
shipments to the second quarter after a freight train was
derailed in December by floods.  “The group is continuing to meet its contractual
commitments as well as spot sales to customers from its existing
stockpiles in Northern and Southern  China ,” Singapore-based OM
Holdings said in a statement to the Australian stock exchange.  The company’s transport route was interrupted after a
bridge was damaged by floods associated with Cyclone Grant in
December. It will still export three shipments from the Port of
Darwin in the first quarter, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
