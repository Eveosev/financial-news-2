Russian aviation group  UTair (UTAR)  aims to
build Latin America’s first helicopter maintenance center in
Peru, state news agency  Andina  reported.  The company plans to invest $8 million in 10 hectares of
land south of Lima, workshops, offices and a hangar to handle
growing regional demand for Russian choppers, the Lima-based
agency said, citing UTair Helicopter Services president Alexei Vinogradov.  UTair will also invest $50 million this year in new MI-171
helicopters for its  Helisur  unit which supplies Peru’s oil
industry, according to Andina.  To contact the reporter on this story:
