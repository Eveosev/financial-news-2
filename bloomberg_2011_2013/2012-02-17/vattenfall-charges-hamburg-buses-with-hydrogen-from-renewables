Vattenfall AB (VATT) , the Nordic region’s
biggest utility, said it opened  Europe ’s largest hydrogen
filling station fed by renewable energy in Hamburg.  The utility funded 43 percent of the 10 million-euro ($13
million) investment, and the German Transport Ministry paid the
rest, Alexander Hauk, a spokesman for Vattenfall Europe AG, said
by phone today. About 20 buses and several cars a day can be
charged with hydrogen from at least 50 percent renewable energy,
according to an e-mailed company statement.  Storing wind power by converting it to hydrogen “is an
important approach that could play a key role in the future
German energy landscape,” Oliver Weimann, head of Vattenfall
Europe Innovation GmbH, said in the statement.  Germany , Europe’s biggest economy, seeks to install 25,000
megawatts of offshore  wind turbines  by 2030 as it phases out
atomic energy by 2022. The expansion of renewables has been
accompanied by concerns that their fluctuating production may
strain power networks and leave consumers without energy when
wind doesn’t blow or the sun doesn’t shine.  Vattenfall is part of a group including car maker  Daimler
AG (DAI)  and  Total SA (FP)  promoting and testing hydrogen-powered transport
in Germany. The Clean Energy Partnership receives financing from
the Transport Ministry.  The filling station produces its renewable fuel through
electrolysis, a chemical process that uses electricity to break
down water into oxygen and hydrogen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
