Peru’s economy may expand at a
faster-than-expected pace this year as global conditions
improve, Andina  reported , citing comments by central bank
President Julio Velarde.  The Andean nation’s growth may exceed the central bank’s
forecast of 5.5 percent, Velarde said, according to the
government’s online news agency. The bank is considering issuing
a revised forecast in March, he said, according to Andina.  To contact the reporter on this story:
