The share of Irish mortgages in
arrears or restructured rose in the fourth quarter to more
100,000, or 14 percent of all home loans, according to the
 central bank .  At the end of December, some 107,708 out of a total 768,917
mortgages were either more than 90 days behind in payments or
were performing after loan terms were altered, the Dublin-based
 central bank  said in a statement today. At the end of September,
the figure was 99,346, or 12.8 percent of loans, according to
data published on Nov. 18.  While Ireland’s government has ruled out widespread
mortgage debt forgiveness even as it reshapes personal
bankruptcy and insolvency laws, the central bank is pushing
lenders to come up with solutions for unsustainable mortgages.
The state has injected about 62 billion euros ($81.4 billion)
into banks over the past three years amid soaring bad loans.  “It is important that borrowers cooperate fully with their
lender in order to be able to avail of protections under the
Central Bank’s revised Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears,”
Bernard Sheridan, the bank’s director of consumer protection,
said in the statement.  Irish mortgages in arrears for more than 90 days rose to
9.2 percent at the end of last year from 8.1 percent at the end
of the third quarter, according to the central bank.  Irish  unemployment  tripled to an average 14.2 percent last
year from 4.5 percent in 2007 as the economy shrank about 15
percent after a real-estate bubble burst. Irish lenders held 895
repossessed homes at the end of last year, according to the
central bank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
