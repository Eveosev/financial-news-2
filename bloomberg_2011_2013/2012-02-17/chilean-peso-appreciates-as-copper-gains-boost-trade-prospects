Chile ’s peso rose, trimming a weekly
decline, as speculation European officials were making progress
on an aid package for Greece countered a drop in the price of
copper, its biggest export.  The peso strengthened 0.1 percent to 484.54 per  U.S. dollar 
at the close in Santiago, from 484.95 yesterday, paring the drop
this week to 1.2 percent.  “Dealers and investors are waiting for a positive outcome
Monday for a Greek bailout, so the market did not react to the
fall in copper,” said Alex Pigatto, a trader at Nomura
Securities Inc. in  New York .  The euro rose while U.S. Treasuries fell as European
leaders expressed optimism they will agree on a Greek bailout.
Copper, Chile’s biggest export, fell as much as 2.5 percent amid
signs that growth is slowing in  China , the world’s biggest user.  The yield on a basket of 10-year central bank bonds in
pesos was 5.28 percent and 2.28 percent on the inflation-linked
equivalents. One year breakeven inflation fell 6 basis points,
or 0.06 percentage point, to 3.12 percent.  Chile’s government will issue a total of $6 billion in
domestic bonds from Feb. 22 through Dec. 19 in a bid to sustain
“adequate” liquidity and establish local benchmarks, the
Finance Ministry said in an e-mailed statement yesterday.  To contact the reporters on this story:
