The Port Authority of New York and
New Jersey  handled a record amount of cargo last year, beating
the previous mark set in 2007, before the start of the economic
crisis, the agency said.  The third-busiest U.S. port processed 5.5 million 20-foot
equivalent units of container cargo in 2011, an almost 4 percent
increase over the prior year, the agency said in a statement
today. The authority’s on-dock rail system, ExpressRail, also
set a record, handling 422,144 containers, or 12 percent more
than in 2010.  “The investments we made in the port’s infrastructure have
paid dividends,” Executive Director Pat Foye said in the
statement. “We will continue to demonstrate that our port is
open for business and prepared to handle increasing volumes of
cargo from around the world.”  The authority oversees the region’s three major airports;
marine terminals and seaports; the PATH commuter rail line; six
tunnels and bridges between  New York  and  New Jersey ; the  Port
Authority  Bus Terminal; and the World Trade Center.  California’s Los Angeles and Long Beach ports are the
busiest in the U.S.  To contact the reporter on this story:
