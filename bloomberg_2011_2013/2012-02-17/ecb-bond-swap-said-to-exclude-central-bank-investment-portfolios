The  European Central Bank ’s Greek
bond swap doesn’t include assets held in national central banks’
investment portfolios, a euro-area central bank official said.  Central banks will have to negotiate individually with
Greece over whether Greek bonds in their portfolios can be
swapped for assets that are exempt from a debt restructuring,
the official said on condition of anonymity. The ECB and
national central banks have already swapped the Greek bonds
acquired in the Securities Markets Program for similar assets
that are exempt from so-called collective action clauses, the
person said.  Because central banks didn’t sell their Greek bonds as the
ECB purchased securities to calm markets, they can argue the
investment portfolios indirectly aided  Greece , the official
said.  Germany ’s Bundesbank has no Greek bonds in its investment
portfolio, the official said.  Central banks in the 17-nation euro area are barred by the
region’s founding treaty from directly financing governments.  To contact the reporter on this story:
