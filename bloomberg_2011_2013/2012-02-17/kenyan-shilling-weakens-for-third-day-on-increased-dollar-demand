Kenya ’s shilling weakened for the
third day, heading for its longest losing streak in more than a
month, on increased demand for dollars by businesses.  The currency of  East Africa ’s biggest economy depreciated
0.1 percent to 83.10 per dollar as of 1:02 p.m. in Nairobi,
targeting its longest declining stretch since Jan. 10, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “The weakening of the shilling is due to dollar demand by
businesses,” Duncan Kinuthia, a dealer at Nairobi-based
Commercial Bank of Africa Ltd., said in a phone interview today.  Tanzania’s shilling also fell as oil importers and
construction companies bought dollars. The currency of the
second-biggest economy in East Africa weakened 0.4 percent to
1,600. A close at this level would be the lowest since Jan 24.,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “Demand is coming in from  oil companies  and the
construction sector today,” Hakim Sheik, a dealer with
Commercial Bank of Africa Tanzania Ltd., said today by phone
from  Dar es Salaam , the commercial capital.  The Ugandan shilling snapped a two-day losing streak,
trading 0.1 percent stronger at 2,317.25 per dollar.  -- With assistance from David Malingha Doya in Dar es Salaam
