Telefonica Czech Republic AS, the
country’s largest phone operator, said fourth-quarter profit
rose 50 percent thanks to a one-time gain from deferred tax
income booked at its Slovak unit.  Net income for the three months ended Dec. 31 was 2.87
billion koruna ($151 million), compared with 1.91 billion koruna
a year earlier, the company said today in an e-mailed statement.
Revenue declined 4 percent to 13.4 billion
koruna.  The fourth quarter was “positively” impacted by deferred
tax income booked in Slovakia worth 709 million koruna, the
Prague-based company said.  Oibda, or operating income before depreciation and
amortization, rose 1.2 percent to 5.8 billion koruna in the
quarter, the company said.  The company’s board will propose to pay a dividend of 40
koruna a share from 2011 earnings. Of the total, 13 koruna will
represent a share capital reduction.  To contact the reporter on this story:
