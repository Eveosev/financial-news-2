Latvia plans to join the euro area
in 2014 and is willing to pay its share in any future bailouts
of indebted nations, central bank Governor Ilmars Rimsevics told
 Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung  in an interview.  “I believe that the latest measures in  Italy ,  Spain  and
Ireland will be successful but even if new difficulties should
arise, we are willing to make our contribution, even if it is
relatively small,” Rimsevics was quoted as saying. “It would
be naive to think that a crisis in the euro area won’t spread to
neighboring countries.”  It was a “big mistake” for  Greece  to delay adjustment
measures, Rimsevics said. “Unfortunately, there is little
hope” for the country as a result, he said, according to the
newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
