(Corrects South Korean group’s share in fourth paragraph
of story that ran yesterday.)  Sumitomo Corp. (8053) ,  Japan ’s third-
largest trading house by assets, said the Ambatovy nickel
project in Madagascar will start initial production in March.  The project will begin production next month and will have
operation rates above 70 percent by the end of this year,
Kuniharu Nakamura, managing executive officer, told reporters at
a conference today. The mine will produce 60,000 metric tons a
year from 2013, he said.  Nickel, used to strengthen stainless steel in everything
from kitchen sinks to aircraft-fuel tanks, has climbed 6.6
percent this year after losing 24 percent in 2011 on concern
that  Europe ’s debt crisis may curb global growth and demand in
 China  may slow.  Sumitomo has a 27.5 percent stake in the project, while
Canada’s  Sherritt International Corp. (S)  owns 40 percent and a
South Korean group led by  Korea Resources Corp. (RESCOZ) , a state-run
mineral explorer, has 27.5 percent.  Nickel for three-month delivery fell 0.6 percent to $19,950
a ton at 5:19 p.m. in  Tokyo  on the London Metal Exchange.  Separately, Sumitomo plans to increase its assets of
resources and energy rights, such as copper, zinc, coal,  iron
ore , oil and gas to 1 trillion yen ($12.7 billion) in two to
three years from current 700 billion yen, Nakamura said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
