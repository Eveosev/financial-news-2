The euro strengthened against most
of its most-traded counterparts on optimism European leaders
will agree to release bailout funds for  Greece  on Feb. 20.  The yen fell to a six-month low versus the dollar and
declined against all its major peers as global equity and
commodity markets rallied. The euro pared gains against the
dollar as the Greek government drew up legislation that could be
used to impose losses on investors who don’t support a debt
swap. Norway’s krone rallied even as the central bank said it
was monitoring recent gains.  “The euro has a track record of rallying into summits,
like we have coming on Monday, only to back pedal when the
meetings have missed expectations,” said  Joe Manimbo , a market
analyst in  Washington  at Western Union Business Solutions, a
unit of Western Union Co. “Yen weakness has been compounded by
the fact that investors are feeling a bit more buoyant about the
global economy as well as the situation in Greece.”  The euro rose 0.9 percent to 104.54 yen at 5 p.m. in  New
York  after touching 104.67 yen, the strongest level since Dec.
5. The shared currency gained 0.1 percent to $1.3140 after
reaching $1.3198. The dollar rose 0.8 percent to 79.55 yen, and
reached 79.62, the strongest since Aug. 4.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.2 percent, and the
MSCI All-Country World Index gained 0.6 percent. The S&P GSCI
Index of 24 raw materials advanced 0.3 percent.  ‘Agreement on Greece’  Italian Prime Minister  Mario Monti , German Chancellor
 Angela Merkel  and Greek Prime Minister  Lucas Papademos  expressed
optimism that an “agreement on Greece” can be reached at a
Brussels meeting of euro-area finance ministers on Feb. 20 after
a joint conference call today.  Getting investors to agree to a writedown on the debt is a
condition for sealing the second Greek bailout as officials seek
to cut the nation’s debt load. Euro-area finance ministers have
slated the meeting as a make-or-break effort to solve such open
questions, Deputy German Finance Minister Steffen Kampeter said
in Hamburg last night.  “It’s simply a reversal of an overly pessimistic view on
the  euro zone  from earlier in the week, so there is upside for
the euro and there is a recovery in the stability trade,” said
 Andrew Wilkinson , chief economic strategist at Miller Tabak &
Co. in New York. “There’s become a clear case of buying the
dips in the market’s mentality.”  The New York-based Conference Board’s gauge of the U.S.
outlook for the next three to six months increased 0.4 percent
in January after a revised 0.5 percent rise the previous month.
The  cost of living  rose 0.2 percent in January after no change
the prior month, Labor Department data showed.  Yen Declines  The yen has tumbled 6.6 percent over the past month and the
dollar dropped 2.9 percent, the two worst performers among 10
developed-market currencies monitored by Bloomberg Correlation-
Weighted Indexes. The euro gained 0.6 percent over the period.  South Korea ’s won rose 0.6 percent to 1,125.50 per dollar
as foreigners demanded $568.8 million more of the nation’s
equities than last week.  Norway’s krone rose 0.3 percent to 5.7135 per dollar and
advanced 0.2 percent to 7.5089 versus the euro.  The nation’s central bank is monitoring the krone after its
recent gains as policy makers focus on boosting competitiveness
in the oil-exporting nation, Governor Oeystein Olsen said. Crude
oil futures rose 1.7 percent to $104.04 a barrel in New York.  The pound gained 0.2 percent to $1.5828, extending its
weekly advance to 0.5 percent. Sterling rose 1 percent to
125.92, the strongest since Nov. 1.  Sales including fuel climbed 0.9 percent from December,
when they rose 0.6 percent, the  Office for National Statistics 
said today, spurring speculation the U.K. economy will avoid a
recession.  To contact the reporter on this story:
