U.S. stocks advanced, sending the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index near the highest level in about
three years, amid optimism Greece will get a bailout.  Banks had the biggest gain in the  S&P 500  among 24 groups,
rallying 1.7 percent.  H.J. Heinz Co. (HJN) , the biggest ketchup maker,
and  Campbell Soup (CPB)  Co., the largest soup maker, climbed at least
2.6 percent as earnings beat projections.  Gilead Sciences Inc. (GILD) 
tumbled 14 percent as some patients relapsed on its hepatitis C
drug. General Mills Inc., the maker of Cheerios cereal,
retreated 3.6 percent after cutting its profit forecast.  The S&P 500 rose 0.2 percent to 1,361.23 at 4 p.m. New York
time. The index is 0.2 percent below its April peak of  1,363.61 ,
the highest level since June 2008. The  Dow Jones Industrial
Average  added 45.79 points, or 0.4 percent, to 12,949.87.  “Greece is the word,”  Philip Orlando , the New York-based
chief equity strategist at Federated Investors Inc., which
oversees about $370 billion, said in a phone interview. “We’re
just reacting to what the euro zone is telling us in terms of
the state of negotiations. Do I believe that the euro zone will
give  Greece  more money? Yes. Otherwise, Greece defaults.”  Equities rose as euro-area governments closed in on a deal
to unlock a 130 billion-euro ($171 billion) aid package for
Greece, seeking to avert the region’s first sovereign default.
Germany signaled that finance ministers may be ready to back
Greece’s second bailout in two years when they meet Feb. 20.  “The bar has been raised,” Eric Thorne, who helps oversee
about $6 billion at Bryn Mawr Trust Co. in Bryn Mawr,
Pennsylvania, said in a phone interview. “If things don’t go
quite smoothly as expected, then the market would experience a
fairly steep selloff.”  Economic Optimism  Today’s gain extended this year’s rally in the  S&P 500  to
8.2 percent. Stocks climbed as  Europe  stepped up efforts to tame
its debt crisis and after reports on U.S. manufacturing, housing
and jobs bolstered optimism in the world’s largest economy.  Seven out of 10 groups in the S&P 500 rose today as
consumer discretionary and financial shares had the biggest
gains. The  KBW Bank Index (BKX)  of 24 stocks added 1 percent.  JPMorgan
Chase & Co. (JPM)  advanced 1.2 percent to $38.47.  Bank of America
Corp. (BAC)  lost 0.9 percent to $8.02.  Intel Corp. (INTC)  had the biggest
advance in the Dow, rallying 2 percent to $27.37. It’s the
highest level since 2007.  Should the S&P 500 rally above its closing peak in April,
the gauge would extend its gains, according to  Ryan Detrick  at
Schaeffer’s Investment Research. He said the next target for the
S&P 500 would be  1,440 , the intraday peak in May 2008.  ‘Good Sign’  “It would be a good sign that confidence is coming back,”
Detrick, senior technical strategist at Schaeffer’s, said in a
telephone interview from Cincinnati. “People are realizing that
things are on much better footing and that should lead to higher
equity prices.”  H.J. Heinz (HNZ)  gained 4.6 percent to $54.47. The company
reported third-quarter earnings excluding some items of 95 cents
a share, beating the average analyst estimate of 85 cents.  Campbell Soup added 2.6 percent to $32.90. The company
reported second-quarter earnings excluding some items of 64
cents a share. On average, the analysts surveyed by Bloomberg
estimated profit of 62 cents.  First Solar Inc. (FSLR)  surged 7.3 percent to $42.59. The biggest
maker of thin-film solar panels resolved a permitting issue with
Los Angeles County for a $1.36 billion power project under
construction, paving the way for financing to resume.  Chesapeake Energy Corp. (CHK)  jumped 4 percent to $24.71 after
being raised to “buy” from “hold” at Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
The 12-month share-price estimate is $29.  Gilead Tumbles  Gilead tumbled 14 percent to $47. Among eight patients with
hepatitis C genotype 1 in a clinical trial, six had a viral
relapse within four weeks after stopping a 12-week treatment
with the medicine, GS-7977, plus ribavirin, Gilead said today in
a statement. The two other patients are two weeks out from
stopping treatment, and haven’t relapsed, the company said.  General Mills (GIS)  dropped 3.6 percent to $38.34. The company
said “weak volume performance” across U.S. retail food
categories in December and January hurt results in its fiscal
third quarter.  The companies investors  hated  the most in 2011 have
returned twice as much as the S&P 500 this year, burning
speculators who bet stocks from  Sears Holdings Corp. (SHLD)  to Netflix
Inc. would keep falling.  The 26 companies in the S&P 500 with the highest so-called
short interest relative to shares available for trading rallied
18 percent this year, compared with 8 percent for the full
index, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Speculators who borrowed
Sears shares and sold them to profit from a drop got hammered as
the stock surged 73 percent. Netflix, with short interest of 17
percent at the end of 2011, rose 76 percent.  Biggest Gains  Banks (S5BANKX) , commodity and industrial companies, the only groups
to post losses last year, are leading stocks higher on signs the
 U.S. economy  is gaining momentum. That’s forcing speculators to
cut bearish wagers after pushing them to the highest levels
since the market bottomed in 2009, according to a survey by
International Strategy & Investment Group.  “It’s been a rotation back into fundamentally sound,
economically sensitive companies that had been unduly punished
in the second half of last year,” David Spika, who helps
oversee $13 billion as an investment strategist at Westwood
Holdings Group Inc. in Dallas, said in a telephone interview.
“When the market turns, those shorts have to be covered and
that creates momentum.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
