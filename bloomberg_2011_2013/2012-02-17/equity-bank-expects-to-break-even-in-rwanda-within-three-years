Equity Bank Ltd. (EQBNK) ,  Kenya ’s biggest
bank by customers, expects its Rwandan unit to break even in
three years after investing $12 million setting up operations in
the country, Managing Director James Mwangi said.  “Equity Bank Rwanda will be financially supported by Equity
Bank Kenya’s balance sheet in the next two years to facilitate
their operations before it starts making profits,” Mwangi told
reporters today Kigali, the capital. The lender expects to be
among Rwanda’s three biggest banks within five years, he said.  Rwanda’s economy, still recovering from the 1994 genocide
that left at least 800,000 people dead, is forecast by the
central bank to grow 7.6 percent in 2011. Foreign direct
investment in the country grew 57 percent last year to $626
million, according to the  Rwanda  Development Board.  Equity began operations in Rwanda in October with three
branches. The bank has more than 5.2 billion Rwandan francs
($8.58 million) in deposits, 1 billion francs of loans and
30,000 customers, Mwangi said. The lender plans to open another
three outlets before the end of this year, according to an e-
mailed statement from the bank.  Rwanda’s biggest bank by market share,  Bank of Kigali Ltd. ,
has 100,000 customers, according to a statement issued by the
bank on Feb. 14.  The bank also plans to introduce agency banking services in
Rwanda, with an initial target of 200 agents, Mwangi said. Under
the system, agents at locations including supermarkets and gas
stations are enabled to dispense cash and take deposits.  To contact the reporter on this story:
