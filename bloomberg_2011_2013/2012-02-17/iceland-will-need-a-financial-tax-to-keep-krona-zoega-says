Iceland will need a financial tax
that limits capital movements to retain the krona as its
currency, the Sedlabanki’s Gylfi Zoega said.  “If we’re going to hold on to the krona we need to limit
foreign exchange movement with a  Tobin tax  to protect the
economy from financial transactions,” Zoega, a member of
Iceland’s central bank’s monetary policy committee, said in a
television interview with Channel 2. “It’s these financial
transactions that have lifted everything up here and then
dragged everything down.”  The Tobin tax, named after U.S. economist  James Tobin , puts
a penalty on short-term investments in currencies with high
 interest rates  and thereby limits carry trades. That procedure
allows an investor to borrow low-yielding currencies and carry
the funds into higher-yielding markets such as the krona to make
a profit.  “When there’s an upswing, money enters the economy and the
krona strengthens and then it leaves and everything tumbles,”
 said Zoega . “This needs to be stopped” and  Iceland  should also
implement rules that “separate investment and retail banking
and closely monitor bank debt and bank loans.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
