United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon said Iranian assertions that its nuclear program is
peaceful are unconvincing and that it is up to the government in
Tehran to assuage suspicions over its atomic work.  “The onus is on the Iranian side to prove, convince the
international community that their nuclear program is genuinely
for peaceful purposes,” Ban told journalists in Vienna today.
“To my mind, and that of the IAEA, they haven’t been able to
convince the international community,” he added, referring to
the UN’s International Atomic Energy Agency watchdog.  IAEA inspectors will return to Tehran for a second time in
a month for meetings with Iranian atomic officials Feb. 21 and
22.  Iran  has been under investigation since 2003 over suspected
nuclear-nuclear weapons work. The UN Security Council has passed
four sets of sanctions against atomic officials and companies in
Iran.  Israel  and the U.S. haven’t ruled out the use of military
force.  “All these issues must be resolved through negotiation,
through dialogue,” Ban said. “There is no alternative to a
peaceful resolution on this issue.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
