Dieter Hahn, deputy to the late
publisher  Leo Kirch , will receive about 100 million euros ($131
million) out of the 800 million euro settlement reached between
 Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  and Kirch’s heirs, Focus reported, in a preview
of its next edition.  Hahn will invest the money in sporting rights, according to
the magazine. Deutsche Bank Chief Executive Officer  Josef Ackermann  met Kirch’s widow Ruth and his son Thomas last weekend
for two days and negotiated the settlement terms, Focus
reported, without saying where it got the information.  To contact the reporter on this story:
