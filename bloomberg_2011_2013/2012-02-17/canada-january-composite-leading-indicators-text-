Following is the text of
 Canada 's leading indicators report from  Statistics Canada .  The composite leading index increased 0.7% in January,
following an identical gain in the previous month. This
was the seventh consecutive increase in the index. The
increase was concentrated in manufacturing, housing and
services employment, and was offset by declines in durable
goods sales and equity prices.  Out of the three manufacturing components, two
increased. The ratio of shipments to inventories rose for
the third straight month as sales strengthened and
inventories were depleted, while the average workweek
lengthened for the fourth month in a row. However, new
orders for durable goods edged down after two monthly
gains. Housing,  money supply , and services employment
components also increased. This was the 10th monthly
increase in services employment.  Furniture and appliance sales fell; their fifth
straight decline. Spending on other durable goods also
declined after posting gains since May. The US leading
indicator decreased for a second month in a row, while the
equity prices were down for the eighth consecutive month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
