Belarus is extending its offer to
sell a 51 percent stake in its joint venture with  OAO Mobile
TeleSystems (MTSS) ,  Russia ’s largest mobile-phone operator, for $1
billion after two failed auctions last year.  “There are more than a couple of potential buyers showing
interest, but they begin to hesitate as soon as it comes to
discussing the price,” Georgy Kuznetsov, chairman of the
country’s State Property Committee, told reporters today in the
capital, Minsk.  The authorities may offer a potential investor to pay $1
billion in several installments over a period of time instead of
making a lump sum payment, Kuznetsov said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
