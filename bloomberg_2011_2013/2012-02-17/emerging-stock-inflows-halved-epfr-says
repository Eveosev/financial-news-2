Emerging-market equity funds took in
$2.2 billion in the week ended Feb. 15, less than half the
previous week, as concern  Greece  wouldn’t secure emergency
bailout funds and tension in the  Middle East  damped the outlook
for global growth, according to EPFR Global.  Net investment into developing-nation  equity  funds has
totaled $19.2 billion in 2012, compared with outflows of $9.83
billion for the same period of 2011, according to a report e-
mailed today by Cambridge, Massachusetts-based EPFR. Developing-
nation fund inflows for the week ended Feb. 8 were a net $5.8
billion, the most since October 2010.  Investors have returned over 40 percent this year of the
$47 billion pulled out of emerging market equity funds in 2011
as developing nations demonstrate “more fiscal and monetary
firepower to sustain growth rates two-to-three times greater
than their developed-market counterparts,”  Cameron Brandt ,
EPFR’s director of research, said by e-mail.  So-called Global Emerging-Market funds, or GEM funds,
recorded a net outflow for the week of $1.67 billion, the worst
performance since the first week of January. During the week
ended Feb. 8, GEM funds posted inflows of $5.4 billion, the data
show.  The average emerging-market equity portfolio posted a 0.2
percent gain for the week, extending the 2012 advance to 14.8
percent, Brandt said.  China-dedicated equity funds recorded their sixth
consecutive week of inflows to total $1.8 billion for 2012.
Brazil funds experienced the most outflows in five weeks after
companies reported worse-than-estimated earnings, while rising
crude prices boosted flows into  Russia . India funds attracted
new money on speculation of additional rate cuts, EPFR said in
today’s statement.  Emerging-market bond funds registered inflows of $673
million after posting gains for three straight weeks, Brandt
said. These funds amassed a record $2.14 billion of inflows in
the week ended Feb. 8, the data showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
