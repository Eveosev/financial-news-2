The European Parliament may allow
member countries to refuse reviews by credit-ratings agencies,
 Die Welt  reported, citing a draft of a proposed resolution.  “Ratings agencies should be forbidden from publishing
noncommissioned credit ratings,” the newspaper cited the
resolution draft as saying in an e-mailed preview of an article
to be published tomorrow.  Leonardo Domenici, an Italian member of the parliament,
plans to introduce the resolution at the end of February, Welt
reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
