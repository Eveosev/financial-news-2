Belarus plans to offer stakes in 19
major state-owned companies this year, five fewer than
previously planned, State Property Committee Chairman Georgy
Kuznetsov said.  Belarus plans to raise at least $2.5 billion from state
asset sales this year, Kuznetsov told reporters today in the
capital, Minsk. The list includes oil-industry companies,
Kuznetsov said, declining to elaborate.  “We will sell companies representing the petrochemical
industry only under the condition that a buyer pledges to supply
the company with raw materials,” Kuznetsov said.  President Aleksandr Lukashenko is currently revising the
list, Kuznetsov said. According to Belarusian law, the president
personally approves a divestment of strategic state enterprises.
In January Belarus unveiled plans to sell at least $12.5 billion
in assets over the next five years, including stakes in
commercial banks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
