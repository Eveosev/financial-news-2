Basil Read Holdings Ltd. (BSR)  climbed to
the highest level in more than two years after the construction
company said it won a contract from  South Africa ’s Trans-Caledon
Tunnel Authority in the nation’s Limpopo Province.  The stock gained as much as 13 percent to 16 rand, the
highest intraday level since November 2009, and closed 6 percent
higher at 15 rand in Johannesburg.  The 1.2 billion-rand ($155 million) contract for the
Olifants River Water Resources Development Project, to be funded
by the South African government and Trans-Caledon, is the first
of a two-phase contract worth 2 billion rand, the company said
in a statement late yesterday. Following the award, Basil Read’s
order book is valued at 14 billion rand.  “It’s all in the order book,” Drikus Combrinck, a
portfolio manager at PSG Konsult, said by telephone from
Pretoria. “The construction sector looks like it is making a
turnaround.”  A pledge by President  Jacob Zuma  in his state-of-the-nation
address last week to spend more on railways and ports to boost
exports and attract investment in mining may lead to a re-rating
for the  construction industry , Combrinck said. If Finance
Minister  Pravin Gordhan  increases the allocation for spending on
infrastructure in his national budget on Feb. 22 “you might see
this sector rally very well,” he said.  The  FTSE/JSE Africa Construction and Materials Index  has
gained 9.3 percent this year after sliding 26 percent in 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
