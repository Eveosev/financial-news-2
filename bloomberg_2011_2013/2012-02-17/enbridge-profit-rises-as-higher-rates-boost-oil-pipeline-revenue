Enbridge Inc. (ENB) , the largest Canadian
pipeline company, said fourth-quarter profit rose 2.8 percent as
it increased rates for oil shippers and margins rose on natural-
gas processing.  Net income climbed to C$335 million ($336.8 million) or 44
cents a share, from C$326 million, or 43 cents, a year earlier,
the Calgary-based company said in a statement today. Excluding
items such as gains and losses from financial contracts, per-
share profit was 37 cents, two cents less than the average of 14
 analysts’ estimates  compiled by Bloomberg. Revenue rose 31
percent to C$5.44 billion.  Enbridge increased rates on an oil pipeline system between
Alberta and  Illinois , helping to boost revenue, said Steven Paget, an analyst with FirstEnergy Capital Corp. in Calgary.  Oil pipeline net income rose 74 percent to C$203 million as
volumes from oil-sands projects increased. Profit rose fivefold
to $157 million at the gas pipeline and processing unit aided by
wider margins between the price of raw natural gas and products
derived from it such as propane and ethane, a raw material for
plastics.  Warmer weather than a year earlier damped profit from gas
distribution as volumes fell. Utility profit fell 43 percent to
C$34 million.  Enbridge owns 24,613 kilometers (15,000 miles) of pipelines
that ship more than 2.2 million barrels of crude oil and liquids
a day, according to its website.  Pipeline Proposal  The company has proposed to build the Northern Gateway
pipeline, a 1,177 kilometer project across the  Rocky Mountains 
that would bring oil from  Canada ’s oilsands to the coast of
British Columbia.  Enbridge said in November it will buy  ConocoPhillips (COP) ’s 50
percent stake in the Seaway pipeline for $1.15 billion and
reverse the flow to carry crude from Cushing,  Oklahoma , to
refineries on the Gulf Coast. A shortage of pipeline capacity
between Cushing and  Texas  has caused Canadian and West Texas oil
to trade at a discount to imports.  The earnings statement was released before the start of
regular trading on North American markets. Enbridge rose 0.7
percent to C$39.20 yesterday in Toronto.  To contact the reporters on this story:
