The U.S.  Food and Drug
Administration  declined a request from  Brazil , the biggest
orange juice producer, to temporarily allow more of a banned
fungicide in juice imports.  The U.S., the biggest single importer of orange juice,
started testing shipments for the fungicide carbendazim, which
is banned in U.S. groves, after regulators were alerted to
reported traces of the chemical in December.  Orange juice imports from Brazil will remain subject to
testing the FDA said in a  letter  e-mailed yesterday, in which it
denied a request on behalf of the Brazilian Citrus Exporters
Association to allow higher tolerances of the fungicide through
June 2013 while exporters eliminate it from shipments.  “Without enforcement, we could not ensure that the  food
supply  is protected,” Michael Landa, director at the Center for
Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, said in the letter to Melvin
Drozen, a partner at Keller and Heckman LLP in  Washington ,
acting for the Brazilian association.  “If our enforcement is not consistent, it would provide an
unfair advantage to those who have not taken the steps and
incurred the expenses necessary to ensure that food they offer
for sale in the U.S. complies with the requirements of the
law,” Landa wrote.  The FDA has found 24 orange juice samples, 12 from Brazil
and 12 from  Canada , with carbendazim levels higher than the 10
parts per billion allowed from the 104 shipments it tested,
according to a weekly update from the agency yesterday.  While the FDA recognizes the economic impact on  orange
juice  prices, it won’t halt testing or detainment of imports,
Landa said in the letter. Americans’ orange juice consumption
may total 751,259 metric tons in 2011-12, U.S. Department of
Agriculture data show.  OJ Prices  Orange juice on ICE Futures U.S. in  New York  gained 9.5
percent to $1.8505 a pound this year after the FDA said it would
test all imports for the fungicide used to treat a disease known
as black spot that affects orange trees. The price reached a
record $2.2695 a pound on Jan. 23.  Brazil industry group Fund for Citrus Plant Protection,
known as Fundecitrus, said on Feb. 6 it would stop using
carbendazim, which is banned on orange groves in the U.S.  Brazil will have no claim with the  World Trade Organization 
as suggested in the growers’ request because the testing is
within U.S. requirements to the WTO, Landa wrote in the letter.  “The fact that the agency decides to prevent food
products, such as orange juice, that contain residues of
unauthorized pesticides from entering U.S. commerce is not
inconsistent with U.S. WTO obligation,” Landa said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
