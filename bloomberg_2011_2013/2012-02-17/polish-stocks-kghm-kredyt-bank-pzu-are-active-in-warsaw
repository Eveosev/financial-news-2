Poland’s  WIG20 Index (WIG20)  advanced 1.8
percent to 2,359.89 at its close in Warsaw, and added 1.5
percent for the week.  The following were among the most active stocks on the
Warsaw Stock Exchange today. Stock symbols follow company names.  KGHM Polska Miedz SA (KGH)  , Poland’s sole copper and
silver producer, rose 3.2 percent to 137.6 zloty. Copper prices
advanced for the first time in six days, trimming a second
consecutive weekly loss amid speculation demand may improve in
the U.S. and Greece will get a bailout.  Kredyt Bank SA (KRB)   gained 1.6 percent to 12.19 zloty,
a second straight advance. Reuters reported yesterday that  Banco
Santander SA (SAN)  is seeking to buy the Polish lender, together with
the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Kredyt
Bank is controlled by Brussels-based  KBC Groep NV. (KBC)   PZU SA (PZU)   climbed 1.4 percent to 341 zloty, advancing
for the first time in three days. UBS AG raised its price
estimate for the country’s largest insurer to 370 zloty from 349
zloty.  To contact the reporter on this story:
