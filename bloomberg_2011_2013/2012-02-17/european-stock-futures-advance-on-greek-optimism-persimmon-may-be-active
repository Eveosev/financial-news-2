European stocks advanced for a third
day, pushing the Stoxx  Europe  600 Index to a six-month high, as
investors speculated that euro-area officials are nearing an
agreement on a bailout for Greece.  Societe Generale SA, Banco Santander SA and  Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc (RBS)  paced gains by lenders.  Anglo American Plc (AAL) 
added 1.1 percent after posting annual earnings that exceeded
analysts’ estimates.  Lafarge SA (LG) , the world’s biggest cement
maker, soared 8.3 percent as operating income beat projections.  The  Stoxx 600  climbed 0.6 percent to 265.93 at the close of
trading as the benchmark measure climbed to its highest level
since July 28. The gauge has gained 1.8 percent this week and
 8.8 percent this year  after the European Central Bank lent 489
billion euros ($643 billion) to euro-area banks at below-market
 interest rates .  “An agreement on Greece seems near,” said Benoit Peloille, equity market strategist at Natixis in Paris. “But I
think the market mainly has been benefiting from the exceptional
liquidity from the  European Central Bank .”  Germany wants the currency area’s finance ministers to
avoid separating the 130 billion-euro bailout for Greece from
the planned bond swap with private creditors, officials from
Europe’s largest economy said in a briefing to their country’s
lawmakers. The finance chiefs of the 17 nations using the single
currency meet on Feb. 20 in Brussels.  Finance Ministers’ Meeting  The Eurogroup meeting will probably approve the package and
the debt exchange, three German officials involved in the
telephone briefing yesterday said. A Finance Ministry spokesman
declined to comment.  Three euro-area officials said that the ECB will swap its
Greek bonds for new ones to ensure that it doesn’t take losses
in a debt restructuring.  The bond exchange will only go ahead once governments
authorize the European Financial Stability Facility to provide
30 billion euros, to be used in cash or collateral as an
incentive to investors. The ECB plans to complete the
transaction between Feb. 22 and March 9, the German lawmakers
heard at the briefing.  A gauge of European banks advanced 1.4 percent making the
biggest contribution to the  Stoxx 600’s rally .  Societe Generale (GLE) ,

among western-European markets as the Mediterranean nation’s
lenders advanced.  Piraeus Bank SA (TPEIR)  rallied 14 percent to 64.2
euro cents. Alpha Bank SA surged 16 percent to 1.81 euros.  National benchmarks gained in every market except Norway.
France’s CAC 40 Index and Germany’s DAX index both added 1.4
percent, while the U.K.’s FTSE 100 Index rose 0.3 percent.  Anglo American climbed 1.1 percent to 2,674 pence after the
producer of metals and minerals from Africa to Brazil said that

$4.75 by 23 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News.  Construction stocks rose 2.9 percent for the second-biggest
