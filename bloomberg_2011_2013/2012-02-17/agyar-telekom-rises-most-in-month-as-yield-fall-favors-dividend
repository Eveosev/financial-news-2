Magyar Telekom Nyrt. (MTEL) ,  Hungary ’s
former phone monopoly, rose the most in almost two years as a
drop in government bond yields made the company’s dividend more
attractive to investors, according to Concorde Ertekpapir Zrt.  The shares rose 5.5 percent to 573 forint, the biggest
advance since May 2010 and the highest closing level since July
by the end of trading in Budapest. Gains in Hungary’s government
notes maturing in 2017 cut the yield five basis points today to
8.42 percent, compared with 10.844 percent on Jan. 4.  Hungary’s bonds and the forint have rallied since Prime
Minister  Viktor Orban  said on Jan. 5 he was ready to discuss
steps needed to obtain a “quick” international bailout. Magyar
Telekom, which is often sought for its dividends, benefits as
bond yields become less attractive in comparison, said Attila Gyurcsik, an analyst at broker Concorde.  “Magyar Telekom is a yield-sensitive stock,” Gyurcsik
said in a telephone interview from Budapest today. “The shares
have missed out on the recent rally in bonds and it is now
catching up.”  The prospect of a bailout deal with the  International
Monetary Fund  and the European Union may help cut yields
further, Gyurcsik added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
