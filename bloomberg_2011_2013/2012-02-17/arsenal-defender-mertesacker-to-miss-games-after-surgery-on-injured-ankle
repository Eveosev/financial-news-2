Arsenal defender Per Mertesacker
will miss games for a “long term” after undergoing surgery on
an ankle he injured in a Feb. 11 game against Sunderland.  “He has had surgery and we have lost him for a while,”
manager  Arsene Wenger  said in a statement on the club’s website.
“How long, I don’t know. He had reconstruction of his
ligaments, so it will be long term.”  The German national team player, who joined the London club
before this season, slipped and injured his ankle during a play
that led to Sunderland’s goal in Arsenal’s 2-1 victory. The
teams meet again tomorrow in an F.A. Cup match.  Fellow central defender Laurent Koscielny will miss the
rematch after hurting his knee in a 4-0 Champions League loss to
AC Milan. He and Carl Jenkinson will return from injury and
train next week, Wenger said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
