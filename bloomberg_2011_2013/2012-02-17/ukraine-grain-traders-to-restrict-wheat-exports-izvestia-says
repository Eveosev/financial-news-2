Ukrainian grain traders agreed to
export no more than 1.7 million metric tons of wheat before the
end of the marketing year on June 30,  Ekonomicheskie Izvestia 
reported, citing an unidentified chairman of a trading company
who took part in talks with the government.  The government and traders agreed that outbound shipments
shouldnâ€™t exceed 800,000 tons before March, the Kiev-based
newspaper said.  That will bring wheat exports in the marketing year that
ends on June 30 to 4.8 million tons, or half what traders
wanted, Izvestia cited the trader as saying.  To contact the reporters on this story:
