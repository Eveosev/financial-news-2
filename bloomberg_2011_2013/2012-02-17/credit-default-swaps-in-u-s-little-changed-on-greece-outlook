A benchmark gauge of U.S. company
credit risk was little changed as European officials moved
toward an agreement on a bailout for  Greece , easing concern that
the sovereign-debt crisis will slow the global economy.  The Markit CDX North America Investment Grade Index of
credit-default swaps, which investors use to hedge against
losses on corporate debt or to speculate on creditworthiness,
dropped by 0.4 basis point to a mid-price of 98.6 basis points
at 3:59 p.m. in New York, according to Markit Group Ltd.  The gauge held as Italian Prime Minister  Mario Monti ,
German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  and Greek Prime Minister  Lucas
Papademos  expressed optimism that an “agreement on Greece” can
be reached at a Brussels meeting of euro-area finance ministers
on Feb. 20. The three leaders said they were “confident that
the euro group can reach an agreement on Greece on Monday,”
Monti’s office said in an e-mailed statement today.  The swaps index, which typically falls as investor
confidence improves and rises as it deteriorates, closed at 94.3
basis points on Feb. 3, the lowest level since July.  Credit swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails
to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A
basis point equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10
million of debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
