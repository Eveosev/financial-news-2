Debt financing targeting private
 capital markets  worldwide may reach $80 billion within four
years as banks retreat from lending to non investment-grade
companies, according to CEPRES, an industry research firm.  “With ongoing restrictions on senior lenders due to
regulatory pressures and rebuilding balance sheets and a
refinancing bubble on the horizon between 2012 and 2015, we only
expect conditions to improve for private debt strategies,”
Daniel Schmidt, managing partner at CEPRES, wrote in a report on
the mezzanine market. “As much as $80 billion of new deal flow
opportunity could be on the table for private debt within the
coming three to four years.”  Pricing for European mezzanine financing deals last year
exceeded 1,000 basis points more than benchmark lending rates
for the first time, up from 900 basis points in 2010 and 800
basis points in 2007, according to data from Munich-based
CEPRES. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  Mezzanine financing is a type of private high-yield debt
that often gives investors access to the equity of the
borrowers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
