Enbridge Inc. (ENB)  fell the most in more
than six months after disclosing that Noverco Inc., which owns
8.9 percent of the Canadian pipeline company, plans to sell a
third of its stake.  Enbridge, the largest transporter of Canadian crude to the
U.S., fell 3.9 percent to C$37.66 at 12:02 p.m. in Toronto,
after earlier dropping as much 4.2 percent, the biggest intraday
decline since Aug. 8.  Noverco, a holding company that’s 61 percent-owned by
Caisse de Depot et Placement du  Quebec ,  Canada ’s largest pension
fund, plans to sell 22.5 million of its 69.4 million Enbridge
shares. Enbridge owns the other 39 percent of Montreal-based
Noverco. The selloff will result in $300 million for Enbridge,
the Calgary-based company said in a statement.  Noverco is selling the shares to rebalance its asset mix,
Enbridge said in the statement. The sale represents 2.9 percent
of Enbridge’s outstanding  shares , according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  “The placement of these shares will probably be at a
market discount, and the possibility of shares hitting the
market at a lower price than yesterday has shareholders selling
now,” Steven Paget, an analyst with FirstEnergy Capital Corp.
in Calgary, said in a telephone interview today.  Net income  at Enbridge climbed 2.8 percent to C$335 million
($336.8 million) or 44 cents a share, from C$326 million, or 43
cents, a year earlier, according to the statement. Excluding
items such as gains and losses from financial contracts, per-
share profit was 37 cents, two cents less than the average of 14
analysts’  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
