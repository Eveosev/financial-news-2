Fleeing English religious
persecution, in 1631, devout Puritan Roger Williams arrived in
 Boston , where he was warmly welcomed. By 1636, convicted by the
General Court of sedition and heresy, he was banished.  (To listen to the podcast, click  here .)  Williams was convinced that “forced worship stinks in
God’s nostrils,” and that the state had no business meddling in
matters of conscience. To provide liberty for the soul, a wall
was needed between church and state. In fact, legitimacy for the
ruler came not from God, but from the ruled.  To escape thugs sent to put him on a boat to  England , where
he faced arrest, an ailing Williams was forced to flee alone
into the wilderness during a blizzard, getting help during the
freezing winter from American Indians.  He went on to found Providence as a uniquely free society,
with no mention of God in its charter, a place so threatening
that for the next century its neighbors tried to wipe it out.  I spoke with John M. Barry, author of “Roger Williams and
the Creation of the American Soul,” on the following topics:  1. Legal Influences  2. Religious Freedom  3. Banishment  4. Uniquely Free Providence  5. Broad Legacy  To buy this book in  North America , click  here .  ( Lewis Lapham  is the founder of  Lapham’s Quarterly  and the
