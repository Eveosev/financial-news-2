Canadian Finance Minister  Jim Flaherty  said he is “cautiously optimistic” that Greece’s
efforts to obtain another bailout package will be resolved next
week before a scheduled meeting of Group of 20 policy makers.  Flaherty, in an interview with BNN Television from Rome,
said any resolution needs to include a mechanism that will allow
the  International Monetary Fund  to track progress.  “The preferable resolution would be an appropriate
austerity program in Greece properly monitored,” Flaherty said,
after meeting with Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti. “The
alternative is a disorderly exit by Greece from the euro zone.”  A European-funded resolution to the crisis needs to be a
condition for any additional help from the IMF, said Flaherty,
after he met with Italian Prime Minister  Mario Monti . G-20
finance ministers and central bankers will meet Feb. 25 and Feb.
26 in Mexico City.  “They are fully capable, they have the fiscal capacity to
do so, instead of coming to the non-European G20 countries and
asking us to pony up,” Flaherty said. “So the sine qua non is
that  Europe  moves first.”  Flaherty said he will aim to release a fiscal plan before
April 1 that will seek a “balance” between encouraging growth
and reducing the country’s deficit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
