In many ways, things in  Europe  look
better than they did just a month or two ago. The  European
Central Bank  is providing banks with almost unlimited cash to
buy their governments’ bonds. Yields on Italian debt have
declined.  This breather is a perfect opportunity to examine some
pernicious -- and widely circulated -- myths that have emerged
from the crisis and could still do much harm.  Myth No. 1:  Italy ’s interest burden was unmanageable.  Let’s do some math. On Nov. 25, the yield on 10-year
Italian debt was 7.2 percent; it’s around 5.7 percent now.
Suppose Italy had to pay that difference of 1.5 percentage
points on debt it issues over the next two years that probably
amounts to less than half of gross domestic product. That
payment would be an additional interest burden of less than 1
percent of GDP, in a country where the government share accounts
for half of output.  In December, the  Bank for International Settlements 
conducted a more detailed calculation than mine and estimated
that the interest burden would be about 2 percent of GDP; still
less than 5 percent of total  government spending .  Spooked Markets  Nonetheless, the Italian government and many commentators
hit the panic button, demanded that Europe ride to the country’s
rescue and then criticized the markets for being unjustifiably
spooked by Italian debt levels. But one has to wonder: Who is
spooking whom? With so much drama over so little, is it any
wonder that bond investors have doubts about Italy’s ability to
pay?  If, instead, the Italian government had confidently
explained that it could afford to pay the additional 1 percent
to 2 percent of GDP on debt service, the crisis could have been
averted.  It still is in Italy’s power to do so. A study I recently
wrote with the economist  Mathias Trabandt  demonstrates that
Italy cannot sustain a real interest rate of more than  6.4
percent  on its debt for an extended period. But we also
concluded that Italy got precariously close to its maximum
capacity for  tax revenue , according to the Laffer curve. Perhaps
it should now climb down and reduce government spending overall.
This won’t just make the country produce more efficiently -- it
will also provide room for repaying the debt.  Myth No. 2: Fiscal austerity means disaster, or growth
policies require spending.  It is nice, of course, for governments to be able to borrow
money and sprinkle it generously over its citizens. Once the
flow stops, however, it should come as no surprise that the
citizens are unhappy. That will happen sooner or later because
what has been borrowed almost always needs to be repaid.  Some people believe there is an alternative: Let’s examine
what happens if the government can no longer borrow these
generous handouts, and instead has to extract these resources
from its own citizenry. Will that promote growth? What about
that old Keynesian idea of having some citizens dig holes that
other citizens then fill: Wouldn’t that do wonders for the
economy?  This is wondrous thinking, indeed. Imagine a beautiful
island whose inhabitants don’t need to exert themselves to live
happily. Each citizen has an apple tree that each day at noon
drops an apple sufficiently large to feed its owner. A citizen’s
only task is to pick up the fruit and eat it; otherwise he or
she can spend the day at the beach. The per-capita GDP of such
an economy would be one apple a day.  Apple a Day  Enter a government that decides it needs to tax away the
entire harvest every day, and then pays each citizen an apple a
day for lying on the beach. They would have done so anyhow, but
they now get paid by their government for performing a
“service.” GDP has been doubled. The services provided by the
government are accounted for by how much they cost -- an apple
in this example. It would be easy to keep going and even triple
or quadruple the original one-apple-per-day GDP.  Now imagine fiscal austerity is imposed, say, by
eliminating the government. Yes, GDP would come crashing down;
it would fall 50 percent in this example. The citizens, however,
are no worse off: They still get to eat an apple a day, just as
before. They may even be better off in cases where the
government required them to perform an onerous task in exchange
for their salaries, such as sitting in a government office all
day. Moreover, if the tax imposed on citizens is a labor tax on
collecting the apples, then high tax rates might have been
preventing them from collecting the apples in the first place.  I’m not suggesting that  Greece , Italy or other countries
with large government sectors pay government employees to lie on
the beach or sit idly in offices. But it may be worth asking why
the government share of their economy has to be so large, and
how much truly would be lost if these governments spend less. It
also is worth asking how much dynamism would be added to these
economies if the burden of future high taxes is removed. In
Italy, the government of Prime Minister  Mario Monti  is on track
to remove many implicit burdens created by rules and
restrictions in a number of markets, which is good policy.  It is understandable that there will be resistance and
protests because being cut from the government payroll will seem
punitive to those who are affected. Even though standard
national income accounting tells us that GDP declines when
government is pruned, it shouldn’t obscure the overall benefit
to the economy of such measures.  Myth No. 3: ECB President  Mario Draghi  masterfully avoided
disaster in Europe by providing cheap credit to banks in
December, a move that, in turn, encouraged them to hold the debt
of their governments.  One element of this operation was truly praiseworthy: the
emphasis on stabilizing the financial system and ensuring that
credit markets kept functioning.  Indeed, providing credit to the  banks  rather than
purchasing government debt outright is a better strategy for the
ECB. But why encourage the banks to use that cash to buy
government debt, rather than using it for a useful activity such
as giving loans to productive private enterprises or to
consumers?  It would have been far better to provide cheap liquidity to
the banks while encouraging them to get rid of their government
debt. Suppose, for example, that all Greek banks had shed their
holdings in their country’s debt. That would mean that even if
the government were to default on its obligations, the banking
system would be largely untouched and depositors would be safe.  There is a sinister logic at work here: If Italian banks
hold Italian debt, then it becomes very dangerous for the
government to default because such an event would bring down the
banking system and Italian depositors would lose their shirts.
In other words, compelling national banks to hold national debt
is intended to create fragility in the national banking system.
That, in turn, keeps the political costs of a default high (and,
hopefully, yields low).  ECB Mandate  The biggest danger is that there could come a time when the
Italian government isn’t as determined as it is now to bring
order to its fiscal house. Then, it will be the ECB, and
therefore the rest of Europe, that will pick up the bill as the
debt loses value. This isn’t a deal that the rest of Europe has
agreed to and isn’t part of the ECB’s mandate.  The debt crisis in Europe is, above all, a political
problem. Italy wouldn’t collapse if it is required to pay a few
extra percentage points of interest on its debt. If that had
been made clear to the markets from the beginning -- and if the
government had put in place a credible fiscal plan -- the crisis
might well be over.  It’s not too late to change course. If political leaders
show they are committed to the same repayment plan -- regardless
of whether it is their country’s banks holding the debt or
someone else -- the euro area’s financial system, banks and
currency, as well as the ECB would be secured.  If, however, Europe continues to head down the same path,
the current respite might be short-lived.  (Harald Uhlig is chairman of the economics department at
