Spain ’s Cabinet approved new pay
limits at public companies and reduced board members before a
full overhaul of the sector aimed at curbing spending to meet
European Union budget pledges.  “The Cabinet will examine in a few weeks the first phase
of a restructuring of the state-owned companies,” Deputy Prime
Minister Soraya Saenz de Santamaria told reporters after the
weekly meeting in Madrid today.  Spain’s two month-old government is trying to slim down
state spending that ballooned during the decade-long property
boom amid a surge in  tax  revenue. The People’s Party government,
seeking to reduce the budget gap, is trying to restore investor
confidence to tame borrowing costs and shield Spain from debt-
crisis contagion.  Saenz said Spain expects major savings from restructuring
central government-owned companies, which will be downsized,
sold or scrapped if their business can be taken over by public
administrations.  The government will also encourage regions and town halls
to restructure their own companies, Saenz said, as this will be
a condition to get help from  Madrid  to meet their funding needs.  Public  companies  linked to the central government have
accumulated debt of 32.3 billion euros, according to the Bank of
Spain, and European Union rules don’t require that borrowing to
be included in public-debt data. Regions and city halls have
taken on 24.9 billion euros of debt, Bank of Spain data show.  “These kinds of companies and foundations, which in the
end aimed to avoid the controls of the central government, have
blossomed, to put it nicely, and it’s not good practice,”
Economy Minister Luis de Guindos said yesterday said in an
interview with RNE.  To contact the reporters on this story:
