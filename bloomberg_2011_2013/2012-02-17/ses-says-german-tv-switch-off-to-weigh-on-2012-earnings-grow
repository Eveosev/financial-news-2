SES SA (SESG) , the world’s largest publicly
traded satellite operator, said  Germany ’s analogue satellite
television switch-off will weigh on 2012 earnings growth.  SES forecast recurring revenue and earnings before
interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, which exclude
currency movements and one-time items, to rise by about 2
percent and 1 percent respectively this year, the Luxembourg-
based company said in a statement today. Excluding the analogue
impact, revenue and Ebitda on that basis are both predicted to
rise by about 9 percent this year.  “The German switch-off is impacting our guidance,” Chief
Executive Officer Romain Bausch said in an interview. “The
underlying growth trends excluding this one-off impact are
strong and sustainable.”  The CEO predicted the German switch-off will cut revenue by
about 73 million euros ($96 million) this year. Recent delays in
satellite launches and solar-array circuit failures are also
affecting the 2012 revenue and Ebitda growth rates.  SES said 2011 net income rose 27 percent to 617.7 million
euros because of lower financing charges and taxes. Revenue was
little changed at 1.73 billion euros. Analysts expected profit
of 557.2 million euros and revenue of 1.74 billion euros,
according to the averages of estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
