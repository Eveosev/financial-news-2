Thailand ’s baht advanced as global
investors pumped money into local assets on the nation’s growth
outlook and as increasing optimism Greece will secure a second
bailout encouraged risk-taking.  The currency was poised for a weekly gain after foreign
funds purchased $155 million more Thai equities than they sold
this week through yesterday and bought a net $965 million of
government debt, data from the stock exchange and the Thai Bond
Market Association show. European governments considered cutting
rates on emergency loans to Greece and using contributions from
the  European Central Bank  to plug a new financing gap in the
second bailout, two people familiar with the talks said.  “Basically,  Europe  won’t let  Greece  default and will
probably provide a second bailout,” said Shigehisa Shiroki,
chief trader on the Asian and emerging-markets team at Mizuho
Corporate Bank Ltd. in  Tokyo . “Funds will continue to flow into
Asia and the regional currencies will remain on a gradual
appreciation trend.”  The baht climbed 0.2 percent to 30.82 per dollar as of 8:36
a.m. in Bangkok, taking its weekly advance to 0.1 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The currency may
strengthen toward 30 by the end of March, Shiroki said.  Thailand’s  economy  will expand 4.9 percent this year,
compared with a previous prediction of 4.8 percent, the central
bank said on Feb. 3. The monetary authority cut its growth
estimate for 2011 to 1 percent from 1.8 percent the same day.
Official data for 2011 growth is due on Feb. 20, and the median
estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg is for an expansion
of 1.1 percent.  The yield on the 3.25 percent notes due June 2017 was
steady at 3.21 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The rate increased five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point,
this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
