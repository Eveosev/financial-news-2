German financial regulator Bafin is
reviewing whether Christian Wulff, the country’s president,
violated capital market rules in the wake of Porsche SE’s failed
bid to take over  Volkswagen AG (VOW) ,  Der Spiegel  said.  Wulff may have learned in February 2008 that Porsche was
planning the bid and Bafin reviews whether he may have had to
disclose that fact to the markets, the magazine reported,
without saying where it got the information.  Wulff was prime minister of Lower Saxony and a member of
Volkswagen’s supervisory board at the time of the Porsche bid.  Bafin’s press office didn’t immediately return a call
seeking comment. Wulff’s attorney Gernot Lehr didn’t immediately
reply to an e-mail requesting comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
