Bank of East Asia Ltd. , the third-
largest Hong Kong-based lender, said its  China  unit won
regulatory approval to sell 1 billion yuan ($159 million) of Dim
Sum bonds in the city.  China’s National Development and Reform Commission recently
granted approval for the bond sale, Brian Li, deputy chief
executive of Bank of East Asia, said in an e-mailed reply to
questions today. The bank plans to complete the sale this year,
he said.  Yuan bond sales in  Hong Kong  increased more than fourfold
to 151.4 billion yuan last year, from 35.7 billion yuan in 2010,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. HSBC Holdings Plc, the
top underwriter for the notes, forecasts total Hong Kong sales
of as much as 310 billion yuan this year.  China’s Vice Premier  Li Keqiang  pledged in August to allow
mainland Chinese companies to borrow as much as 50 billion yuan
each year through bond sales in the city. The government has
also relaxed rules to allow direct investments denominated in
the currency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
