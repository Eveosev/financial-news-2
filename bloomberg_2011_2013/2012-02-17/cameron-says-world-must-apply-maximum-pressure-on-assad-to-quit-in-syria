U.K. Prime Minister  David Cameron 
said the world needs to apply the maximum pressure on Syrian
President Bashar Al-Assad to go.  “What is happening in  Syria  is appalling, we have a
government that’s butchering and murdering its own people,”
Cameron told reporters after meeting with President Nicolas
Sarkozy in Paris today. “That’s why it’s important the
world comes together and the world acts as decisively as it
can,” he said.  “We need to take all of the action we can to put maximum
pressure on Assad to go and stop the butchery that’s taking
place,” he said. “I’m not satisfied we’re taking all the
action we need to, but it’s difficult. It’s complicated.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
