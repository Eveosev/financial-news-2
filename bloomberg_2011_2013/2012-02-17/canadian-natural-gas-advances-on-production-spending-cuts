Canadian natural gas rose after
 EnCana (ECA)  Corp., the nation’s biggest producer of the fuel, said it
would cut production.  Alberta  gas gained 4.5 percent. Calgary-based EnCana said
it will reduce North American output by as much as 600 million
cubic feet a day. Talisman Energy Inc., another large Canadian
producer, said Feb. 15 it would cut spending on exploration by
about $500 million this year and U.S. inventories fell last week
by more than analysts expected.  “We’re seeing different folks saying they’re going to cut
production and capital expenses,” said Kyle Cooper, director of
research at IAF Advisors in Houston. “The temperature-adjusted
storage changes are actually quite bullish. People are starting
to see the bottom.”  Alberta gas for March delivery rose 9.25 cents to C$2.135 a
gigajoule ($2.04 per million British thermal units) at 3:05 p.m.
New York time on  NGX , a Canadian Internet market. NGX gas has
advanced 1.9 percent this week.  Gas traded on the exchange is shipped to users in Canada
and the U.S. and priced on TransCanada Corp.’s Alberta system.  Natural gas for March delivery on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  rose 11.7 cents, or 4.6 percent, to settle at $2.684
per million Btu. The futures gained 8.4 percent this week.  Spot Prices  Spot gas at the Alliance delivery point near Chicago jumped
15.52 cents, or 5.9 percent, to $2.7802 per million Btu on the
 Intercontinental Exchange . Prompt delivery at Alliance, an
express line that can carry 1.5 billion cubic feet a day from
western  Canada , gained 1.75 percent this week.  At the Kingsgate point on the border of  Idaho  and British
Columbia, gas advanced 13.21 cents, or 5.5 percent, to $2.549.
At Malin,  Oregon , where Canadian gas is traded for California
markets, gas was up 15.71 cents, or 6.2 percent, to $2.689.  Volume on TransCanada’s Alberta system, which collects the
output of most of the nation’s gas wells, was 16.4 billion cubic
feet, 374 million below target.  Gas was flowing at a daily rate of 2.11 billion cubic feet
at Empress, Alberta, where the fuel is transferred to
TransCanada’s main line.  At McNeil, Saskatchewan, where gas is transferred to the
Northern Border Pipeline for shipment to the  Chicago  area, the
daily flow rate was 2.13 billion cubic feet.  Available capacity on TransCanada’s British Columbia system
at Kingsgate was 431 million cubic feet. The system was forecast
to carry 2.01 billion cubic feet today, or 82 percent of its
capacity of 2.44 billion.  The volume on  Spectra Energy’s  British Columbia system,
which gathers the fuel in northeastern British Columbia for
delivery to Vancouver and the Pacific Northwest, totaled 2.85
billion cubic feet at 2:05 p.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
