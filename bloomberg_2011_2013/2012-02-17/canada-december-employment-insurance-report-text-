The following is the text of
Canada's employment insurance report for Dec. released
by  Statistics Canada .  The number of people receiving regular Employment
Insurance (EI) benefits edged up 4,200 (+0.8%) to 544,700
in December. The number of beneficiaries remained
relatively stable during the final quarter of the year,
but was down 109,400 (-16.7%) compared with 12 months
earlier.  There were more people receiving benefits in six
provinces, with the largest percentage increases occurring
in Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Ontario. The largest decline
was observed in Newfoundland and Labrador.  Number of Employment Insurance beneficiaries relatively
stable in the fourth quarter  Number of Employment Insurance claims unchanged in
December  To receive EI benefits, individuals must first submit a
claim. The number of claims provides an indication of the
number of people who could become beneficiaries.  Nationally, the number of initial and renewal claims
was essentially unchanged, at 238,000 in December.
Provincially, the number of claims declined 4.8% in
Saskatchewan and 1.8% in  Quebec . In Newfoundland and
Labrador, claims rose 2.7%, while in Alberta, they
increased 1.9%. There were no notable changes in the other
provinces.  Number of claims unchanged in December  Provincial summary  The number of people receiving regular EI benefits in
December rose in six provinces, with the largest
percentage increases occurring in Manitoba (+3.7%),
Saskatchewan (+3.6%) and Ontario (+2.6%). At the same
time, the number of beneficiaries in Newfoundland and
Labrador fell 2.1%, the third consecutive monthly decline
in the province.  Sub-provincial and demographic overview  EI data by sub-provincial region, sex and age are not
seasonally adjusted and are therefore compared on a year-
over-year basis.  Year-over-year declines continue in most large centres  Between December 2010 and December 2011, the number of
people receiving EI regular benefits declined in 131 of
the 143 large centres (see map). Large centres are those
with a population of 10,000 or more.  In Newfoundland and Labrador, the number of
beneficiaries was down in four of the five large centres.
In St. John's, the number of people receiving benefits
fell 16.0%, continuing a series of year-over-year declines
that began almost two years earlier.  In Prince  Edward Island , both large centres had fewer
beneficiaries in December. The biggest percentage decline
was in Charlottetown, where the number of beneficiaries
fell 14.2%.  In  Nova Scotia , all five large centres had fewer
beneficiaries in the 12 months to December. The largest
percentage decline occurred in Halifax, where the number
of people receiving benefits fell 14.1% to 4,900,
continuing the downward trend that began in spring 2010.  In  New Brunswick , two of the six large centres had
fewer beneficiaries in December compared with 12 months
earlier. The number of people receiving benefits fell
13.8% in Moncton and 10.6% in Saint John. There was little
change in the four other large centres in the province.  In Quebec, the number of beneficiaries declined in 29
of the 33 large centres, with the largest percentage
decreases in Rouyn-Noranda, Amos,  Montreal  and Quebec. In
Montreal, the number of people receiving benefits fell
19.1% to 52,800, extending a series of declines that began
in spring 2010. In the census metropolitan area of Quebec,
the number of beneficiaries declined 17.4% in the 12
months to December.  Of the 41 large centres in Ontario, 38 had fewer
beneficiaries in December compared with 12 months earlier.
The largest percentage decreases occurred in Hamilton,
Stratford, Windsor, Chatham-Kent, Guelph and Toronto. In
Toronto, the number of beneficiaries fell 25.6% to 53,700,
extending the series of year-over-year monthly declines
that started in spring 2010.  In Manitoba, the number of people receiving regular
benefits was down in all four large centres in the 12
months to December. In Winnipeg, the number of
beneficiaries fell 15.4% to 6,400, the 16th consecutive
month of year-over-year declines.  In Saskatchewan, all eight large centres recorded year-
over-year declines in the number of beneficiaries, the
largest occurring in Moose Jaw, Saskatoon and Regina. In
Saskatoon, 1,800 people received benefits, down 19.0%,
extending a year-long series of declines. In Regina, the
number of beneficiaries fell 13.5% to 1,300, continuing a
series of declines that began in summer 2010.  In  Alberta , all 12 large centres had fewer
beneficiaries in December than 12 months earlier. The
largest percentage decreases occurred in  Grande Prairie ,
Cold Lake, Lethbridge and Calgary. In Calgary, 8,100
people received benefits in December, down 38.2% from 12
months earlier, the fastest pace of decline among all
census metropolitan areas. In Edmonton, the number of
beneficiaries was 9,200, down 33.8%.  In British Columbia, the number of beneficiaries fell
in all 25 large centres, with the largest percentage
declines in Fort St. John, Powell River, Dawson Creek,
Vernon and  Vancouver . In Vancouver, 24,400 people received
benefits in December, down 25.2% from 12 months earlier.
In Victoria, the number of beneficiaries was 3,000, down
23.5%.  Demographic groups  In December, 337,500 men received regular benefits,
down 16.0% from December 2010. The number of beneficiaries
fell 16.2% among men under 25 years of age and 17.2% among
those aged 25 to 54. For men aged 55 and over, the number
receiving benefits declined 12.2%.  In December, 211,600 women received benefits, down
15.9% from 12 months earlier. Among those under 25, the
number of beneficiaries fell 18.4%, while for those aged
25 to 54, it declined 16.7%. For women aged 55 and over,
the decline was 12.1%, similar to the rate of decrease for
their male counterparts.  Note to readers  The change in the number of regular Employment
Insurance (EI) beneficiaries reflects various situations,
including people becoming beneficiaries, people going back
to work, and people exhausting their regular benefits.  All data in this release are seasonally adjusted unless
otherwise specified.  EI statistics are produced from administrative data
sources provided by Service  Canada  and Human Resources and
Skills Development Canada. These statistics may, from time
to time, be affected by changes to the Employment
Insurance Act or administrative procedures. The number of
regular beneficiaries and the number of claims received
for November and December are preliminary. In this
release, large centres correspond to those with a
population of 10,000 or more.  The number of beneficiaries is a measure of all people
who received EI benefits from December 4 to 10. This
period coincides with the reference week of the Labour
Force Survey (LFS).  EI statistics indicate the number of people who
received EI benefits, and should not be confused with data
coming from the LFS, which provides information on the
total number of unemployed people.  There is always a certain proportion of unemployed
people who do not qualify for benefits. Some unemployed
people have not contributed to the program because they
have not worked in the past 12 months or their employment
is not insured. Other unemployed people have contributed
to the program but do not meet the eligibility criteria,
such as workers who left their job voluntarily or those
who did not accumulate enough hours of work to receive
benefits.
