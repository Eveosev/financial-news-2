U.K. retailers have boosted cash
reserves by 50 percent in the last five years as concern about a
slowing domestic economy causes them to curb investment in local
economies, according to the  British Retail Consortium .  Average cash holdings increased to 424 million pounds ($670
million) in 2011 from 283 million pounds in 2006, the advocacy
group said in a  budget submission  to the U.K. government, citing
a study by Oxford Economics of 21 FTSE-listed retailers.  The U.K. economy shrank 0.2 percent in the fourth quarter,
while unemployment held at the highest rate for 16 years.  “These figures suggest the chancellor has much more to do
to inspire confidence in business,” BRC Director General
Stephen Robertson said. “Retail could drive growth and job
creation across the U.K. if the trading conditions were right.
But, over the last five years, retailers have been accumulating
cash, they are often too fearful to invest.”  Companies may be encouraged to invest by a cut in business
rates, lower European Union barriers for online retailers,
enhanced use by landlords of small business leases and retention
of office developments in towns, according to the BRC.  To contact the reporter on this story:
