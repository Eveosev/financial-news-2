European Central Bank  governing
council member Jens Weidmann didn’t support the bank’s decision
to swap its Greek bonds for new ones to ensure it isn’t forced
to take losses in a debt restructuring,  Spiegel  magazine
reported, citing ECB officials it didn’t name.  Special rules for the ECB may prompt legal action by other
Greek bondholders, and increase investor doubts about other
peripheral euro countries such as  Portugal , possibly worsening
the debt crisis, the magazine said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
