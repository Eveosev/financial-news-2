CEZ AS (CEZ) , the biggest power utility in
the  Czech Republic , extended this week’s rally to the highest
level in more than six months as electricity prices rose.  The stock advanced as much as 1.5 percent to its strongest
intraday price since Aug. 8 and traded up 1.2 percent at 828
koruna by 10:53 a.m. in Prague.  Power for next-year delivery in Germany, where CEZ exports
part of its output, rose 1.5 percent this week to 52.45 euros
per megawatt-hour. Global stocks and commodities rallied after
U.S. data showed improvements in the world’s largest economy and
on speculation Greece will secure a bailout.  To contact the reporter on this story:
