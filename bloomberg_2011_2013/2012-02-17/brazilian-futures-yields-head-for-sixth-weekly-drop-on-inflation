Yields on Brazilian interest-rate
futures contracts headed for a sixth weekly drop as traders
stepped up bets for lower borrowing costs after a report showed
consumer prices increased less than expected this month.  The yield on the contract due in January 2013 fell three
basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 9.19 percent at 9:43
a.m. in  Sao Paulo , bringing the weekly decline to 10 basis
points.  Consumer prices as measured by the IPCA-15 index increased
0.53 percent through mid-February, the national statistics
agency said today. It was expected to rise 0.56 percent, the
median forecast of 46 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The
second preview of the IGP-M index measuring consumer, wholesale
and construction prices fell 0.11 percent this month through
yesterday, more than the 0.02 percent median estimate of 20
economists.  “Food is pushing the  consumer price index  lower, and soft
commodities are falling,” helping drive wholesale prices down,
 Newton Rosa , chief economist at SulAmerica Investimentos, said
by phone from Sao Paulo. “This makes the central bank more
comfortable” about lowering the benchmark lending rate.  The real climbed 0.1 percent to 1.7150 per  U.S. dollar ,
from 1.7164 yesterday.  To contact the reporters on this story:
