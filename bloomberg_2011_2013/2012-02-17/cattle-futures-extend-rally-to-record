Cattle futures rose to an all-time
high for the 10th time this year as rising demand for U.S. beef
tightens supply and increases costs for restaurants including
 Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. (CMG)  Feeder cattle also reached a record
and hogs gained.  The U.S. cattle herd as of Jan. 1 was the smallest for that
date since 1952, and beef  exports  surged 21 percent in 2011,
government data show. The  U.S. Department of Agriculture 
forecast a 4.1 percent drop in beef  output  in 2012, boosting the
cost of the  meat  for consumers by as much as 5 percent  this
year, more than any other food group except seafood.  Global food  prices  in January rose by the most in 11
months, according to the  United Nations . Retail beef last month
was the most expensive ever, and wholesale  prices  through midday
are up 14 percent in the past year, boosting costs for retailers
including  Whole Foods Market Inc. (WFM) , the Austin, Texas-based owner
of specialty supermarkets, and  Ruth’s Hospitality Group Inc. (RUTH) ,
operator of upscale steakhouses.  “Everyone wants to be bullish on cattle just because of
the lower supplies,” Chad Henderson , a market analyst at Prime
Agricultural Consultants Inc. in Brookfield,  Wisconsin , said in
a telephone interview. “That’s where all the bullish enthusiasm
comes from.”  Cattle futures for April delivery rose 1 percent to close
at $1.309 a pound at 1 p.m. on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange,
after reaching $1.31275, the highest for a most-active contract
since the commodity started trading on the CME in 1964. The
price, up 3.2 percent this week, has gained 7.8 percent in 2012.  Feeder-cattle futures for March settlement gained 1 percent
to $1.58425 a pound in  Chicago , after reaching a record $1.5905.
Feedlots buy year-old animals that weigh 500 pounds (227
kilograms) to 800 pounds, called feeders. The cattle are
fattened on corn for about four to five months until they weigh
about 1,200 pounds, when they are sold to meatpackers.  ‘Especially challenging’  Meatpackers have processed about 607,000 head of cattle
this week, down 4.7 percent from the same period a year earlier,
according to government data. At midday, wholesale  beef  was
little changed at $1.9022 a pound, the highest since Jan. 5,
USDA data show.  Ruth’s Hospitality, based in Heathrow,  Florida , projects
beef inflation ranging from 5 percent to 8 percent this year,
Chief Financial Officer Arne Haak said during an earnings
conference call on Feb. 10. Whole Foods has had “sharp cost
increases” in the meat, Co-Chief Executive Officer Walter Robb
said on an earnings conference call on Feb. 8.  “Beef costs will be especially challenging due to
protracted supply shortages, despite recent reductions in grain
prices,” John Hartung, the chief financial officer of Chipotle,
said on an earnings conference call on Feb. 1.  Hog futures for April settlement rose 0.2 percent to close
at 90.375 cents a pound in Chicago. The commodity has gained 7.2
percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
