Vestas Wind Systems A/S (VWS) , the world’s
biggest wind turbine maker, rose the most in two weeks in
Copenhagen trading as investors who had borrowed the stock and
sold it on bets it would decline repurchased the shares to cover
their so-called short positions.  Vestas jumped as much as 8.7 percent, the most since Feb.
3, making it today’s  biggest winner  in the Copenhagen 20 Index.
The stock advanced 1.6 kroner to 54.60 kroner at 9:40 a.m. in
the Danish capital. The Aarhus, Denmark-based company has lost
68 percent of its market value over the past 12 months after
cutting sales and profit forecasts.  Short interest in Vestas reached a record-high 22.1 percent
of shares outstanding on Feb. 15, according to the most recent
figures available from  Data Explorers . Most companies have about
3 percent short interest in their stock, according to Data
Explorers. Vestas said yesterday it will propose Sony Ericsson
Mobile Communications AB Chief Executive Officer Bert Nordberg
as chairman when Bent Erik Carlsen steps down in March.  “The spike suggests a short-covering squeeze as some
market players probably reacted after the share fell below 50
kroner yesterday,” Ole Kjaer Jensen, chief share trader at
Sydbank A/S, said by phone. “Maybe there’s also some delayed
reaction to yesterday’s board member announcement.”  Vestas on Feb. 8 reported a bigger 2011 net loss than
analysts had estimated and said last month it will cut 10
percent of its workforce as Chinese competitors take market
share.  To contact the reporter on this story:
