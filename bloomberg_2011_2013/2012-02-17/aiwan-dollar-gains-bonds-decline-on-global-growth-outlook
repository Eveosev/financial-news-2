Taiwan’s dollar strengthened and
 government bonds  fell as better-than-expected U.S. economic data
and optimism Greece will get a bailout encouraged risk-taking.  Stock indexes  rallied across Asia after the U.S. reported
yesterday that jobless claims declined to the lowest in almost
four years. European governments are considering cutting
 interest rates  on emergency loans to Greece and using
contributions from the European Central Bank to plug a new
financing gap in the second rescue package for Athens, two
people familiar with the talks said. The Taiex index of shares
rose 0.3 percent today and surpassed 8,000 on Feb. 15 for the
first time in six months.  “Risk sentiment is great today as we have some good job
numbers from the U.S.,” said Ivy Leung, a Taipei-based fixed-
income trader at Polaris Securities Co. “The  Taiex (TWSE)  broke the
8,000 psychological level. If stocks continue to rally, it’ll
put pressure on bond yields to rise.”  The  Taiwan dollar  strengthened 0.2 percent to NT$29.583
against its U.S. counterpart, according to Taipei Forex Inc. The
currency weakened 0.1 percent this week.  The yield on the government’s 1.25 percent bonds due March
2022 climbed one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 1.272
percent, prices from Gretai Securities Market show.  Benchmark
10-year rates  dropped three basis points this week and touched
1.26 percent yesterday, the lowest closing level since Dec. 19.  The  overnight money-market rate , which measures interbank
funding availability, was little changed today and this week at
0.399 percent, according to a weighted average compiled by the
 Taiwan  Interbank Money Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
