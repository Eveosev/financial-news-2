The federal  budget deficit  makes
belt-tightening necessary at the  U.S. Department of Agriculture ,
Secretary Tom Vilsack said.  “We’ve had to take a close look at the way we do business
with less money, a smaller staff, and more complex programs,”
Vilsack said today in testimony prepared for the House
Appropriations Committee panel charged with setting spending for
the department.  U.S. Department of Agriculture spending would rise 2.5
percent to $154.5 billion in the year starting Oct. 1 before
crop-subsidy cuts kick in, beginning long-term reductions in
farmer aid, according to the budget President Barack Obama sent
to Congress on Feb. 13.  To contact the reporter on this story:
