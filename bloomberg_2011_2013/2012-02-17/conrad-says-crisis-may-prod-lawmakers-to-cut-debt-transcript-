Senate Budget Committee Chairman
 Kent Conrad , a Democrat, said in an interview on Bloomberg
Television’s “Political Capital with  Al Hunt ,” airing this
weekend, that an economic catastrophe like the debt crisis in
Europe or a Middle East conflict may be the only way to spark
congressional action this year on a broad reduction of the U.S.
deficit.  (This is not a legal transcript. Bloomberg LP cannot
guarantee its accuracy.)  AL HUNT: We begin the show with the chairman of the Senate
Budget Committee, Senator Kent Conrad of  North Dakota . Thank you
for being with us, Senator.  SENATOR KENT CONRAD: Good to be with you.  HUNT: Let’s talk about the Obama budget. It really doesn’t
come close to the kind of deficit reduction long run that you
have been talking about for years. Isn’t the president really
ducking the long-term tough issue?  CONRAD: You know, I don’t think so, and here’s why I say
that, Al. As you know, I’m a deficit hawk.  HUNT: I do.  CONRAD: I was part of the fiscal commission, part of the
Group of Six. But if we put this all in context, when the
president came in, the economy was in full-speed reverse, was
losing 9 percent on an annual basis, in terms of the gross
domestic product. In the most recent quarter, it’s a positive
2.5 percent. Job growth, we were shedding 800,000 private-sector
jobs a month. We’re now gaining 250,000.  HUNT: I’ll cede you the short term. I’m asking, though,
Kent Conrad, Simpson-Bowles, long-term deficit reduction. The
president appointed Simpson-Bowles. He is yet to embrace it.
That’s ducking, isn’t it?  CONRAD: Look, in many ways, he did embrace Simpson-Bowles.
If you look at this budget proposal, he has not quite as much
revenue as we had in our proposal. On Medicare, we had $400
billion of savings. He has $360 billion of savings in Medicare.
And -  HUNT: Simpson-Bowles takes debt-to-GDP ratio to 60 percent
in 10 years. Obama takes it to 77 percent. That’s not close,
even in horseshoes.  CONRAD: Well, remember, part of the test here is the
baseline. In fairness to the president, the Simpson-Bowles
baseline is a very different baseline than the one he is marking
to. And he does have very close to $4 trillion of deficit
reduction in this package. We were - we were more -  HUNT: Would you like to see him embrace Simpson-Bowles,
just, I mean, absolutely say, “Let’s pass it”?  CONRAD: Of course, things have changed since we did
Simpson-Bowles, so you can’t just embrace Simpson-Bowles at this
point because so many things have already been adopted that were
part of Simpson-Bowles.  What I would really like is to have both sides come
together on a bigger package. Frankly, what I tried to sell to
Simpson-Bowles was not a $4 trillion package -  HUNT: It was bigger.  CONRAD: I tried to sell $6 trillion, because that would
balance the budget in 10 years.  HUNT: You have the luxury of retiring, so you can go out on
limbs now. What are the odds that that could happen this year,
that finally both sides get together and say, “OK, let’s do the
big deal”?  CONRAD: Look, the odds are very long, because this is an
election year.  HUNT: Right.  CONRAD: You know, I hear from my Republican friends all the
time, Democrats in the Senate haven’t passed a budget in 1,000
days. It’s like they missed the Budget Control Act. The Budget
Control Act that passed with overwhelming Republican support
that was signed into law by the president is stronger than a
budget resolution, because it’s an actual law. And that sets 10
years of spending caps.  So on the discretionary side, the job is largely done. What
is left to do is revenue and the entitlement programs. Both of
those have to be reformed.  HUNT: And  Harry Reid  won’t touch entitlements, and the
Republicans won’t touch revenues. So that kind of makes it
tough.  CONRAD: Well, you know, in fairness, it’s not just
Democrats who won’t touch entitlements. Congressman Ryan’s
budget last year didn’t touch Social Security, didn’t touch
Medicare for the next 10 years. So the truth is, the American
people don’t support increasing revenue, don’t support changing
Medicare or Social Security, don’t support having savings out of
defense. So -  (CROSSTALK)  CONRAD: You know, at the end of the day - and guess what?
People who are elected actually pretty well reflect the people’s
views in the country.  HUNT: So you’re not an optimist on doing anything this year
at all?  CONRAD: Actually, I am.  HUNT: Well, no. You just said the odds were very long.  CONRAD: The odds are very long. I am -  HUNT: But you still think -  CONRAD: I am prepared to go to my colleagues, along with
others of the Group of Six, which is now a Group of Eight, and
lay out a plan and - and see, give people a chance.  HUNT: Well, what would force that, though? If the odds are
long, what would force that? If the politics are bad, the odds
are long, what would force your colleagues on both sides of the
aisle to do that?  CONRAD: Several possibilities. One,  Europe . If Europe tanks
and begins to drag us down, it may become an acute situation
that requires a response. Second possibility is  Israel  attacking
 Iran . That could create a big run-up in  oil prices . That could
have dramatic economic effects and also require a fuller long-
term response by the United States.  HUNT: So a crisis could force - could force action -  CONRAD: Crisis could.  HUNT: Let me ask you a couple other questions. It appears
the Republican frontrunner for president right now is none other
than  Rick Santorum . You served with him in the Congress for
quite a while. Give me your take on Rick Santorum.  CONRAD: Well, Rick is somebody that has no doubts about his
position and very little interest in the views of those who
disagree with him. I think that would be my take on how Senator
Santorum conducted himself with his colleagues when he was in
the Senate.  HUNT: So pretty unyielding?  CONRAD: Absolutely unyielding. And uncompromising. And
unfortunately, you know, my own view of what’s necessary here is
the left and the right have to get off their fixed positions if
we’re going to get this country back on track.  HUNT: Not popular with his colleagues?  CONRAD: You know, it’s always hard to know how popular one
is with one’s colleagues, but I wouldn’t say he was going to win
any popularity contest in the Senate.  HUNT: Let me talk about the - about the Senate elections.
You’re not running for re-election, but about 70 percent of
those - of the seats that are up this are held by Democrats. A
lot of people say that makes the odds pretty great Republicans
will take control of the Senate, including winning your seat.  CONRAD: Well, I don’t think they’re going to win my seat.  HUNT: You don’t? You think the Democrats will hold that
seat?  CONRAD: Heidi Heitkamp, who was the former attorney general
and succeeded me as tax commissioner when I was elected to the
Senate, is running. And the best polling available shows her
ahead. So I think we will hold my seat.  HUNT: Think you’ll hold the Senate?  CONRAD: I think we’ll hold the Senate. I do. Especially if
Obama is doing well.  HUNT: Let me ask you this, Senator. You have been - you’ve
served nobly for many, many years in  Washington , and you know
some of the virtues, but also a lot of the problems. Looking at
the Senate, if you could change one or two things to make it a
more workable institution, what would you change?  CONRAD: Well, there are a whole series of things I’d
change. First of all, I would diminish the ability of a handful
of people to stop business in its tracks. We’re now in a
circumstance in which the filibuster is the norm, rather than
the exception, which means you’ve got to have endless, endless
delay -  HUNT: So you’d change the filibuster.  CONRAD: - in order to move legislation. I absolutely would
change the filibuster.  HUNT: Second thing?  CONRAD: Second thing I would do is I’d have more moderates
from both sides -  HUNT: But how can you do that?  CONRAD: - in the Senate of the  United States . Well, only
the people can do that, and they’ve got to decide. Look, do you
really want people who are absolutely unwilling to reconsider
their positions in light of changed facts? The facts have
changed. The hard reality is, we’re borrowing 40 cents of every
dollar we spend. Revenue is the lowest it’s been in 60 years;
spending is the highest it’s been in 60 years. Our debt, our
gross debt is now 100 percent of our gross domestic product.  Are we going to face up to this? Or are we just going to
keep kicking the can down the road and put this country in
financial jeopardy?  HUNT: Senator Kent Conrad, before you leave, we’re going to
have you back on this show, because you’ve been a great guest.
Thank you very much for being with us today.  CONRAD: You bet. Enjoyed it.  ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***  THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN
