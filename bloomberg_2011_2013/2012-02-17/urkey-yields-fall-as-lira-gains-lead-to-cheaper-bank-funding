Turkish bond yields dropped to the
lowest level in almost four months after a lira rally this year
prompted the central bank to provide cheaper funding and keep
currency appreciation under control.  Yields (BENCH)  on the benchmark two-year debt fell 15 basis points,
or 0.15 percentage point, to 9.21 percent, the first decline in
four days and the lowest level since Oct. 20, raising this
week’s retreat to 25 basis points. The lira strengthened 0.3
percent to 1.7566 per dollar, lifting this year’s gains to 7.7
percent, the third-biggest appreciation among  emerging markets 
in  Europe ,  Africa  and the  Middle East .  Turkey ’s central bank lent 7 billion liras ($4 billion)
today in a one-week repurchase agreement auction at its lowest
annual funding rate of 5.75 percent, after receiving 28.4
billion liras in bids. The bank in Ankara also provided 5
billion liras in a one-month repo auction at an average annual
rate of 10.21 percent against bids of 19.7 billion liras. The
rate charged today was lower than the 10.68 percent levied in
the previous one-month auction on Feb. 10 of the same amount.  “The central bank talked very dovish in its last
communications meeting and it did not want a speedy appreciation
of the lira,” Tolga Senefe, head of treasury at Anadolubank AS
in Istanbul, said in an e-mailed response to Bloomberg’s
questions.  The lira declined 18 percent in the biggest depreciation
worldwide last year as the central bank cut  interest rates  to a
record low of 5.75 percent and doubled reserve requirement to
curb a widening  current account deficit  that the bank said
threatened the nation’s financial stability. The bank halted
lending at the 5.75 percent rate for two weeks after the lira
weakened to a record low of 1.9224 against the dollar on Dec.28.  To contact the reporter on this story:
