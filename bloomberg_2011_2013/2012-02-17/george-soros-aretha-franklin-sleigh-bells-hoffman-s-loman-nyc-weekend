See what’s happening among “The
Ungovernables,” about 50 young artists who are part of the New
Museum’s 2012 Triennial, many of whom have never been shown in
this city.  Curator Eungie Joo has assembled a global group:
Argentinian sculptor Adrian Villar Rojas has built a wonky site-
specific clay tower, which will be demolished at the end of the
exhibition.  Amalia Pica’s “Eavesdropping,” a meditation on privacy, has
cheerfully colored drinking glasses glued to the wall. And for
“We the People,” Danh Vo deconstructs the Statue of Liberty.  Runs through April 22 at the New Museum, 235 Bowery.

desperation in a revival of  Arthur Miller ’s 1949 Pulitzer Prize-
winning “Death of a Salesman.”  Mike Nichols directed, with Linda Emond as Linda and  Andrew
Garfield  as Biff.  In the role, Hoffman follows theatrical heavyweights Lee J.
Cobb, George C. Scott,  Dustin Hoffman  and  Brian Dennehy .  In previews at the Ethel Barrymore Theater, 243 W. 47th
St., for a March 15 opening. Information: +1-212-239-6200;

Then dig into a classic Caesar salad and a grilled New York
strip steak.  You may run into a Broadway star or two.  At 326 W. 46th St. Information: +1-212-581-6464.  Saturday Afternoon  Gustavo Dudamel, the Los Angeles Philharmonics’s live-wire
music director, has taken the orchestra to his home turf in
 Venezuela  as the climax of their unprecedented Mahler project.  You can see it all live from Caracas in HD at movie
theaters around the country, as Dudamel conducts Mahler’s 8, or
“Symphony of a Thousand,” with the combined forces of the LA
Phil and the Simon Bolivar Symphony Orchestra and multiple
choirs and soloists.  All told, there will be 1,400 musicians onstage -- should
be thrilling!  John Lithgow  hosts the program, which begins at 5 p.m. New
York time. If you miss it, there’s an encore broadcast on Feb.
29. Information: +1-323-850-2000;  http://www.laphil.com .  Saturday Night  After singing at goddaughter Whitney Houston’s funeral at
the New Hope Baptist Church in  Newark  on Saturday,  Aretha Franklin  will take the Radio City Music Hall stage.  The Queen of Soul will sing her greatest hits -- expect to
hear “Do Right Woman--Do Right Man,” “Chain of Fools” and, of
course, “Respect.”  It will be immediately clear why she was the first woman to
be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.  At 1260 6th Ave. Information: +1-212-247-4777;

was making drawings.  From abstract expressionist watercolors, to portraits of
his friends, to landscapes of the Hudson Valley and Long Island
beaches, he continued to draw throughout his long career.  The Morgan Library has organized a retrospective featuring
100 of his works, as well as 50 works from his collection,
including Piet Mondrian and Sol LeWitt.  “Dan Flavin: Drawing” runs through July 1 at the Morgan,
225 Madison Ave. Information: +1-212-685-0008;

Tina Howe’s “Painting Churches,” about Boston Brahmins ready to
retire to Cape Cod.  We take the measure of the family when their daughter Mags,
played by Katherine Turnbull, now a New York artist, comes home
to paint their portrait at this turning point in all their
lives.  In previews at Clurman Theatre, 410 W. 42nd St. for a March
6 opening. Information: +1-212-239-6200;

you cruise around New York Harbor looking for cormorants,
sandpipers, ducks, geese and loons. They’ve migrated here from
the Arctic and can be seen paddling or flying about.  A guide from the Audubon Society will help you spot these
and other water birds.  You may also be lucky enough to see harbor seals on the
shores of Governor’s, Hoffman and Swinburne Islands.  Meet at South Street Seaport’s Pier 17. Information: +1-
