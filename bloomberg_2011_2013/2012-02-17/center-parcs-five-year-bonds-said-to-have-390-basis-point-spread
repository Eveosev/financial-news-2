Center Parcs is selling 300 million
pounds of five-year class A secured notes that will be priced to
yield 390 basis points more than gilts, according to a banker
with knowledge of the sale.  The company is also selling 440 million pounds of 12-year
securities yielding 465 basis points over gilts, the banker
said.  The five-year bond sale was increased from 267.5 million
pounds, while the longer-dated bond sale size has been cut from
a targeted 472.5 million pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
