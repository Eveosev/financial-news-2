Colombia ’s peso rose, approaching a
six-month high, as optimism Greece will get a bailout buoyed
appetite for higher-yielding, emerging-market assets.  The peso climbed 0.3 percent to 1,779.42 per  U.S. dollar  at
10:20 a.m. in Bogota, from 1,784.50 yesterday. It touched 1,770
on Feb. 9, its strongest level since August. The peso headed for
a 0.3 percent gain this week, and has jumped 7.9 percent in the
past three months, the best performance among 25 emerging-market
currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  “There’s less nervousness in the market today and that’s
helping risk appetite,” said Pedro Ospina, a fixed-income
analyst at Interbolsa SA, the country’s biggest brokerage.  Italian Prime Minister  Mario Monti , German Chancellor
 Angela Merkel  and Greek Prime Minister  Lucas Papademos  expressed
optimism that an agreement on Greece can be reached at a Feb. 20
meeting of euro-area finance ministers.  In a bid to ease gains in the peso, Colombia’s central bank
began buying $20 million daily in the spot market for at least
three months beginning Feb. 6. Banco de Republica would like to
see a weaker and more stable peso, Juan Jose Echavarria, a co-
director at the monetary authority, told reporters this week.  The yield on the government’s 10 percent peso bonds due
July 2024 fell one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to
7.32 percent, according to the central bank. The price rose
0.061 centavo to 121.2820 centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
