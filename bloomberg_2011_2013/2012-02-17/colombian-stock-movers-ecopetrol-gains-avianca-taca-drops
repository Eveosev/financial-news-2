The following companies had unusual
price changes in Bogota trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of 4 p.m. local time.  The  IGBC Index (IGBC)  gained 0.4 percent to 14,573.77, while the
Colcap Index rose 0.3 percent to 1,710.76.  Avianca Taca Holding SA (PFAVTA)  (PFAVTA CB), the owner of
 Colombia ’s largest airline, fell 0.2 percent to 4,395 pesos.  The company had a third day of flight cancelations as air
traffic controllers protested to demand better labor conditions.
Avianca Taca canceled at least 21 flights and another 25 were
delayed today, according to a statement by Colombia’s civil
aviation agency. Avianca has also blamed foggy weather and
infrastructure deficiencies for the operational difficulties,
according to a Feb. 15 e-mailed statement.  Ecopetrol SA (ECOPETL)  , Colombia’s largest oil company,
rose 1.8 percent to 5,060 pesos, the highest since November
2007.  Fourth-quarter profit jumped 64 percent from a year ago to
4.4 trillion pesos ($2.47 billion), as crude production climbed,
the company said Feb. 15. Profit exceeded the 4.36 trillion
pesos average estimate of five analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  If Ecopetrol decides to maintain its current dividend
policy in a shareholder meeting next month it would have one of
the highest payments by a Colombian company in 2012, Samuel David Garcia, an analyst at Valores Bancolombia, said in an e-
mailed statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
