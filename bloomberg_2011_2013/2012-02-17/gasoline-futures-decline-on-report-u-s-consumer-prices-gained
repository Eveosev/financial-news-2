Gasoline fell after two days of
gains as a rise in U.S. consumer prices boosted concern that
demand for the fuel may decline.  Futures retreated as the consumer-price index increased 0.2
percent after no change the prior month, the Labor Department
reported today in  Washington . Economists surveyed by Bloomberg
forecast a 0.3 percent gain. During the past 12 months, prices
climbed 2.9 percent, the smallest year-over-year advance since
March 2011.  “It makes sense that this metric that’s very focused on
the U.S. would have a bigger impact on” gasoline, since it’s a
heavily U.S.-consumed product, Jacob Correll, a commodity
analyst at Summit Energy Inc. in Louisville,  Kentucky , said by
phone.  March-delivery gasoline fell 1.65 cents, or 0.5 percent, to
$3.0306 a gallon at 9:32 a.m. on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  after declining as much as 2.4 cents to $3.0231.
Futures are up 13 percent this year.  U.S. gasoline demand last week was the lowest level for
this time of year in weekly data since 2003, Energy Department
data show. Consumption over the past four weeks was 6.4 percent
below a year earlier.  “High gasoline prices are going to put a crimp in growth
at some point, but it’s not going to stop growth,” Carl Larry,
president of the New York City-based Oil Outlooks & Opinions
LLC, said by phone. “We are going to get used to this, we are
going to change our driving patterns. It’s not going to slow the
path of recovery.”  Heating oil for March delivery fell 1.51 cents, or 0.5
percent, to $3.1946 a gallon on the exchange. Futures have
advanced 8.8 percent this year.  Regular gasoline  at the pump, averaged nationwide, rose 0.6
cent to $3.529 yesterday, according to AAA data. Prices were 12
percent higher than a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
