scale back output.  Encana plans to cut North American supply by as much as 600
million cubic feet a day. Gas tumbled 16 percent in January

that may boost demand for the heating fuel.  Gas for delivery on Feb. 20 climbed 0.5 pence to 57.9 pence

improving U.S. economy and progress on a bailout for  Greece

percent to $103.24 a barrel, the highest settlement since

last sold at a premium of $1.05 a barrel to the benchmark on
