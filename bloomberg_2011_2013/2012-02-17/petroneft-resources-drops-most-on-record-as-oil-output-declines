Petroneft Resources Plc., (PTR)  the
London-listed oil explorer focused on  Russia ’s Tomsk region,
fell the most on record after output declined.  The shares sank 36 percent to 9.38 pence as of 3:26 p.m. in
 London , their lowest level since 2009 and the steepest drop
since the stock started trading in 2006.  Production fell to 2,300 barrels a day “in recent weeks”
from about 3,000 barrels a day at the end of last year, the
company said in a regulatory filing today.  In June Petroneft cut its output target for the end of the
first quarter this year to 4,000 to 5,000 barrels a day from
8,000 barrels a day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
