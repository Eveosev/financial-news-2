Cheung Kong Infrastructure Holdings
Ltd. (1038) , a unit of Hutchison Whampoa Ltd., sold $300 million of
perpetual bonds, according to a person with direct knowledge of
the matter.  The bonds were priced to yield 7 percent, said the person,
who declined to be identified because the details are private.  Wendy Tong Barnes, a Hong Kong-based spokeswoman at the
company, could not immediately be reached for a comment on the
sale by e-mail or phone today.  Hong Kong-based  Cheung Kong  postponed the sale on Feb. 13
because of issues listing the notes on the Luxembourg stock
exchange, another person with knowledge of the sale said at the
time. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and JP Morgan Chase & Co. were
arranging the bond, the person said.  The company had the equivalent of $1.7 billion of  debt
outstanding  before the latest sale, data compiled by Bloomberg
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
