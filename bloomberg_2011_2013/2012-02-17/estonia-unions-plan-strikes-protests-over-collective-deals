Estonian trade unions will hold a
series of strikes and protests over government plans to make it
easier for employers to terminate collective agreements.  The  Confederation of Estonian Trade Unions  will stage a
protest tomorrow in the capital, Tallinn, before nationwide
demonstrations and strikes begin March 5, Chairman Harri Taliga
said today by phone. The action will peak with a strike of
teachers and daycare workers, starting March 7, which may be
supported by other unions, according to Taliga.  Draft legislation that’s cleared the first of three
parliamentary readings would stop collective agreements from
running indefinitely, which the Justice Chancellor has ruled
unconstitutional, according to an explanatory letter on the
 legislature’s website . That would allow employers to abandon
such deals more easily, harming workers’ rights, Taliga said.  Protests “will be further spurred” after the government
announced this week that it plans to scrap a commitment to pay
unemployment benefits of 40 percent of a worker’s last salary to
employees who leave their jobs voluntarily or by agreement with
their employer, Taliga said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
