Iceland’s Supreme Court upheld a
two-year jail sentence for Baldur Gudlaugsson, who was permanent
secretary at the country’s  Finance Ministry  during the 2008
financial collapse, for  insider trading  and crimes committed
while holding public office.  The proceeds from Gudlaugsson’s trading, estimated at 192
million kronur ($1.6 million), will be seized by the government.
The special prosecutor froze his assets in November 2009.  Gudlaugsson sold shares he owned in failed lender
Landsbanki Islands hf two weeks before the bank’s collapse. The
court found that the decision to sell his stake in the bank was
based on information obtained through his post as a member of a
government committee appointed to monitor financial stability.  To contact the reporter on this story:
