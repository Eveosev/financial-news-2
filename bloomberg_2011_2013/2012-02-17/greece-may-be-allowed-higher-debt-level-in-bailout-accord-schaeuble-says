German Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  said Greece may be allowed to run a higher debt in
coming years than envisaged so far as part of the second
international aid package for the over-indebted country.  A debt level as high as 123 percent of gross domestic
product by 2020 may be permissible instead of 120 percent under
the 130 billion-euro ($171 billion) lifeline scheduled for
approval at a Feb. 20 meeting of euro region finance ministers,
Schaeuble said. Greece’s debt amounted to about 160 percent of
GDP last year.  “The 120 percent may be 122 percent or 123 percent,”
Schaeuble said at a panel discussion in the southern city of
Stuttgart today. “It mustn’t be 130 percent.”  Greece  has so far implemented spending cuts and revenue
increases that would push its debt to 129 percent of GDP by
2020, the so-called troika of  International Monetary Fund , the
European Commission and the European Central Bank estimates,
according to two people familiar with discussions that involve
the troika.  “We need an arrangement that assures in a realistic
assumption that Greece will be granted debt sustainability in
2020,” Schaeuble said later in an interview with ZDF public
television. “This is only the case if it isn’t much above 120
percent” of GDP.  To contact the reporter on this story:
