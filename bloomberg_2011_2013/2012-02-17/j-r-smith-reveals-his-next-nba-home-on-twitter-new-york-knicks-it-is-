The  New York Knicks  signed free
agent guard J.R. Smith and waived forward Renaldo Balkman,
interim General Manager Glen Grunwald said in a statement
released last night by the team.  Smith will provide depth at guard and small forward. He’ll
be paid the team’s $2.5 million exception to the salary cap,
prorated for the remainder of the season.  Smith, 26, who had been playing for Zhejiang in  China , also
weighed offers from clubs such as the Los Angeles Clippers. He
announced the signing yesterday morning on his Twitter account,
posting a message saying “New York Knicks It Is.”  Smith has averaged 12.5 points per game in his seven
National Basketball Association seasons with  New
Orleans /Oklahoma City and Denver. He’s shot 37 percent from 3-
point range.  Balkman, 27, was in his sixth NBA season with the Knicks
and Denver.  The Knicks, fueled by the emergence of point guard Jeremy Lin, have won seven of their last eight games. New York lost
89-85 last night at home to the  New Orleans Hornets .  To contact the reporter on this story:
