Johnson & Johnson , the world’s
second biggest health-care company, voluntarily pulled more than
a half-million bottles of infants’ Tylenol from shelves in the
latest in a string of recalls.  The oral grape Tylenol, distributed nationwide, was
recalled after a “small number of complaints” with the
bottle’s SimpleMeasure dosing system, the  New Brunswick , New
Jersey-based drugmaker said in a statement. The bottle comes
with a syringe and a barrier that limits the flow to the correct
dose, which some customers said was pushed into the bottle
during use.  “No adverse events associated with this action have been
reported to date and the risk of a serious adverse medical event
is remote,” J&J said in the statement.  The company shifted management of its over-the-counter
products business last month. J&J has recalled hundreds of
millions of packets of Tylenol, Motrin, Benadryl and other
products due to foul odors, adulterated ingredients and bad
labeling in the last two years.  Customers can continue using Infants’ Tylenol as long as
the flow restrictor remains at the top of the bottle, the
company said. Children’s Tylenol, for kids more than two years
old, is still available.  To contact the reporter on this story:
