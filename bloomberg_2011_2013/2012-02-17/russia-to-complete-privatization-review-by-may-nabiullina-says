Russia’s government will complete a
review of its privatization strategy before a new president
takes office in May, Economy Minister  Elvira Nabiullina  said.  There’s no reason to delay the planned sale this year of
stakes in shipper OAO Sovcomflot, Nabiullina told reporters on
an airplane between Moscow and Novosibirsk late yesterday.
Deputy Prime Minister  Igor Sechin  called for delays to the
schedule of state asset sales that involve the  energy industry ,
the Kommersant newspaper reported last month.  Outgoing President  Dmitry Medvedev  promised to relinquish
government control of some of the biggest state companies at the
St. Petersburg International Economic Forum last June, saying it
was time to reverse the policy of strengthening the state’s
presence. Putin, who’s seeking to reclaim the presidency in
elections next month after Medvedev agreed to step aside,
pledged Jan. 30 to loosen the reins on the economy by selling
assets and scaling back regulation.  Sovcomflot, operator of the world’s largest fleet of  oil
tankers , is among the first major companies slated for
privatization, said Alexei Uvarov, head of the  Economy
Ministry ’s property department, said Feb. 2. The government
plans to sell 50 percent in two steps by the end of this year,
he said then.  To contact the reporter on this story:
