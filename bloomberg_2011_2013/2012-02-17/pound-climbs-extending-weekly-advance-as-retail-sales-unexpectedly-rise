Gilts declined for a second day
after a government report showed U.K. retail sales unexpectedly
increased in January, fueling optimism that the economy will
avoid a recession.  Sterling strengthened to a three-month high against the yen
as the data followed reports this month showing manufacturing
returned to growth in January and an expansion in services
accelerated. The pound headed for a weekly advance against the
euro and the dollar after Bank of England Governor  Mervyn King 
said this week the economy should “gradually” recover this
year. U.K. stocks rose for the first time in four days.  “There’s a two-fold pressure on gilts today,” said  Marc Ostwald , a strategist at Monument Securities Ltd. in London.
“The general positive tone in markets, with equities rising,
and the good retail sales data.”  The  10-year gilt  yield climbed five basis points to 2.18
percent at 4:23 p.m. London time. The 3.75 percent bond due in
September 2021 fell 0.445, or 4.45 pounds per 1,000-pound
($1,581) face amount, to 113.42.  Retail sales including fuel climbed 0.9 percent from
December, when they increased 0.6 percent, the  Office for
National Statistics  said in  London . Economists forecast a 0.3
percent decline, according to a Bloomberg News survey.  The FTSE 100 Index of shares climbed 0.3 percent, extending
this week’s gain to 0.9 percent.  The pound rose 0.6 percent to 125.43 yen after climbing to
125.71, the strongest level since Nov. 7. The currency was
little changed at $1.5807 having risen 0.3 percent this week.
Sterling was also little changed at 83.16 pence per euro.  ‘Helped the Pound’  “The retail sales data helped the pound, it was
surprisingly good,” said  Steven Barrow , head of Group of 10
research at Standard Bank Plc in London. “The numbers look
genuinely good and may be something that helps the momentum of
sterling. It makes me a little bit more positive that growth in
the first quarter won’t fall, avoiding a technical recession.”  Sterling has gained 0.5 percent this week, according to
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes, which track 10
developed-nation currencies, trimming its decline this year to
0.8 percent.  The pound also advanced this week after the  Bank of England 
revised up its inflation forecasts on Feb. 15, prompting
speculation that it won’t expand its bond-buying program. The
central bank kept its benchmark  interest rate  at a record low
0.5 percent and raised its asset-purchase target by 50 billion
pounds to 325 billion pounds on Feb. 9 to underpin the economy.  Gilts have lost of 1.8 percent this year, after returning
almost 17 percent in 2011, according to indexes compiled by
Bloomberg and the European Federation of Financial Analysts
Societies. German debt and  U.S. Treasuries  both lost 0.4 percent
in 2012, the indexes show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
