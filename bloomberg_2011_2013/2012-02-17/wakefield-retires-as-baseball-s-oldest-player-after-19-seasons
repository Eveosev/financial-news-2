Boston   Red Sox  pitcher Tim Wakefield, the oldest active player in  Major League Baseball , is
retiring after 19 seasons and 200 wins.  Wakefield, 45, will make the announcement later today at a
press conference from the team’s spring training facility in
 Florida , the Red Sox said in an e-mailed statement. The 45-year-
old knuckleball pitcher retires as baseball’s active leader in
wins (200), losses (180), home runs allowed (418) and innings
pitched (3,226 1/3).  Wakefield signed with the Red Sox in 1995 after being
released by the Pittsburgh Pirates. In spring training with
Boston that year he worked with Hall of Fame pitcher Phil Niekro, another knuckleballer, developing the pitch that helped
him win 1995 American League Comeback Player of the Year and
defined his career.  Over 17 years with the Red Sox, he never pitched in less
than 20 games, including a 49-appearance season in 1999 when he
started 17 games and had 15 saves in relief. He won 10 or more
games 11 times, most recently in 2009.  A member of World Series-champion teams in 2004 and 2007
with the Red Sox, Wakefield was 5-7 in the postseason. Perhaps
his most memorable playoff moment came in the seventh game of
the 2003 AL Championship Season against  New York , when Wakefield
gave up an 11th-inning home run to Aaron Boone that sent the
Yankees to the  World Series .  Wakefield, who worked out of the bullpen in parts of his
final two seasons, won his 200th game on Sept. 13 at Fenway Park
after eight previous attempts while at 199. He received a
standing ovation from the crowd and was doused in champagne
following the milestone.  In 2009, at 42, he became the oldest first-time All-Star
in MLB history, according to radio station WEEI in Boston. He
finishes with 186 wins in a Red Sox uniform, trailing  Roger Clemens  and Cy Young, who both won 192.  To contact the reporter on this story:
