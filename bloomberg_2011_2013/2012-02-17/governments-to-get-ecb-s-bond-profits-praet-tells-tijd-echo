European Central Bank Executive
Board member Peter Praet said profits from the sale of the ECB’s
Greek bond holdings will be distributed via the national central
banks to the euro-area governments, which can “spend the money
as the wish,”  De Tijd  and  L’Echo  reported.  The Frankfurt-based central bank can’t participate in a
private-sector debt writedown of Greek assets and the ECB is
prohibited from financing governments’ debt by buying their
bonds, the newspapers quoted Praet as saying in a joint
interview.  Praet told the newspapers that while the ECB’s three-year
bank loans are an “important operation,” they are not a
“bazooka” and the program is an “extraordinary measure” that
is “temporary,” the newspapers cited him as saying.  The policy maker said the Greek austerity plan is
“feasible” and support from the public is “crucial,”
according to the newspapers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
