Ukraine’s grain exports fell to
about 600,000 metric tons in the first 15 days of this month,
the country’s Agrarian Confederation said.  “Grain exports from Ukraine shrank sharply in February”
because of freezing weather and after the government asked
traders to slow wheat shipments, Sergey Stoianov, director of
the producers group, said today on its website. That compares
with 1.9 million tons of grain exports in the whole of January.  Wheat shipments were less than 100,000 tons in the first 15
days of this month, Stoianov said, compared with 540,000 tons of
wheat exported in the whole of last month, according to the
confederation’s data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
