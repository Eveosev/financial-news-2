Ethanol futures gained for a second
day in  Chicago  on speculation that producers will temper output
after stockpiles climbed to a record.  The biofuel rose 0.6 percent after an Energy Department
report showed  inventories  climbed for a record ninth straight
week to an all-time high of 21.5 million barrels last week.
 Production (DOETFETH)  is down 3.6 percent from the record of 963,000
barrels a day set the week ended Dec. 30.  “We’re still building inventories, but at the same time
everybody and their mother is talking about slowing down,” said
Jerrod Kitt, an analyst at Linn Group in Chicago.  Denatured ethanol for March delivery increased 1.3 cents to
$2.215 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade. Prices are down
12 percent from a year ago.  In cash market trading, ethanol was unchanged in the U.S
Gulf at $2.225 a gallon and in  New York  the biofuel slipped 1
cent, or 0.4 percent, to $2.24, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Ethanol in Chicago jumped 1.5 cents, or 0.7 percent, to
$2.175 a gallon and on the West Coast the additive rose 1 cent,
or 0.4 percent, to $2.295.  The biofuel is blended with gasoline to augment supply and
meet federal mandates.  There are 209 ethanol distilleries in the U.S., with the
capacity to produce 14.8 billion gallons annually, according to
the  Renewable Fuels Association , a Washington-based trade group.  To contact the reporter on this story:
