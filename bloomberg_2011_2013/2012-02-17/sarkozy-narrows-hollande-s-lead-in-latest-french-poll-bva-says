French President  Nicolas Sarkozy 
gained ground on Socialist challenger  Francois Hollande  after
announcing his candidacy, a BVA poll showed.  Hollande would defeat Sarkozy, who announced Feb. 15 that
he’s seeking re-election, by 56 percent to 44 percent in the May
6 runoff, according to the BVA survey for RTL Radio and a group
of regional newspapers. That’s down from 57-43 percent in the
previous Jan. 29 survey.  Hollande would finish first in the April 22 first round
with 31 percent, down 3 points from the previous survey, with
Sarkozy advancing 1 point to 26 percent. Anti-immigrant
campaigner Marine Le Pen was unchanged at 15 percent, and
centrist  Francois Bayrou  gained one point to 13 percent. Under
the French system, the top two in the first round face off if no
one wins a majority.  Still, only 46 percent found Sarkozy’s television address
announcing his candidacy “convincing” while 53 percent found
it “unconvincing.”  BVA surveyed 949 people on Feb. 16. No margin of error was
provided.  To contact the reporter on this story:
