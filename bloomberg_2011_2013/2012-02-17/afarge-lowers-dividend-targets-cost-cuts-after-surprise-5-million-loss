Lafarge SA (LG) , the world’s biggest
cement maker, will double cost cuts and put more assets up for
sale to lower debt after reporting a surprise fourth-quarter
loss amid writedowns.  The  net loss  was 3 million euros ($4 million) after a
profit of 62 million euros a year earlier, the Paris-based
company said in a statement today. Analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg had expected a profit of 258 million euros. Operating
income excluding some items rose 3 percent, beating  estimates .
The shares rose as much as 4.5 percent.  Chief Executive Officer Bruno Lafont is deepening cost cuts
amid higher raw material prices as he seeks to repair a credit
rating that has fallen below investment grade. Lafarge has
earmarked 500 million euros in additional savings and will cut
 capital spending  to 800 million euros, from 1.2 billion euros in
2011, Lafont said today. Asset disposals will exceed 1 billion
euros, he said.  “We’re remaining cautious for 2012,” with a “contrasted
situation” between growth in cement demand in emerging nations
and a stabilization in developed nations, Lafont said on a
conference call with journalists. “Debt will be significantly
reduced” as Lafarge improves its  cash flow , he said.  Writedowns  The stock rose 4 percent to 33.10 euros as of 9:16 a.m. in
Paris as fourth-quarter earnings before interest, tax,
depreciation and amortization of 798 million euros beat
analysts’ estimates for 684 million euros.  Lafarge wrote down 285 million euros of assets, including
about 180 million euros related to  Greece , where demand has
slumped, Lafont said. Lafarge proposed to cut the dividend to 50
cents a share. Last year, the company also reduced the payout by
half.  Revenue in the fourth quarter rose 5 percent to 3.81
billion euros. The French company forecast that cement demand in
its markets will grow by 1 percent to 4 percent in 2012, with
moderating growth in emerging nations, a drop in Western Europe,
and stable demand in  North America .  Cost inflation, which was 6 percent in 2011, will slow in
2012, though will remain “significant,” Lafont said. “We’ve
started implementing price increases announced in recent months,
and we will of course continue,” he said.  Lafont announced 460 job cuts this month as part of plan to
lower costs.  Standard & Poor’s  and Moody’s Investors Service cut
the company’s  credit rating  to below investment grade in 2011.
Net debt stood at 12 billion euros at the end of the fourth
quarter, compared with 14 billion euros a year earlier, meeting
Lafont’s plan to reduce debt by at least 2 billion euros.  Gypsum Sale  Lafont lowered costs by 250 million euros in 2011 , pushed
through the  dividend  reduction, and sold 2.2 billion euros of
 assets , including more than half of Lafarge’s gypsum business
and some cement plants in the U.S.  Of the 500 million euros in savings planned in total, 400
million euros will come this year, Lafarge said today. Half of
the cost cuts will be on general and fixed industrial costs, 20
percent will come from productivity gains, and 30 percent from
energy savings, Lafont said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
