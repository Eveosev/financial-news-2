Chancellor Angela Merkel’s Christian
Social Union ally may block a second aid package for Greece in
Germany’s lower house of parliament on Feb. 27 should Greece
fail to honor its debt reduction commitments, party chairman
 Horst Seehofer  told  Spiegel  magazine.  The CSU, the sister party of Merkel’s  Christian Democratic
Union , won’t support measures that threaten Germany’s top credit
rating, Seehofer also said. Any aid disbursement to Greece must
be accompanied by “concrete reform steps” on the part of the
Greek government, Seehofer told the magazine.  Greece should exit the euro if it’s not willing or able to
meet its spending reduction promises, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
