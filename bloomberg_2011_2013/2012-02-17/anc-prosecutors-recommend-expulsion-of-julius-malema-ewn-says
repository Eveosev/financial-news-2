Prosecutors in an internal tribunal
of  South Africa ’s ruling African National Congress have
recommended the party’s National Disciplinary Committee expel
youth leader  Julius Malema  for sowing division and bringing the
organization into disrepute, Eye Witness News said, without
saying where it got the information.  A decision may be made in the next few days, Eye Witness
News said. Malema is expected to appeal the outcome of hearings
in mitigation of a five-year suspension, the Johannesburg-based
news service said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
