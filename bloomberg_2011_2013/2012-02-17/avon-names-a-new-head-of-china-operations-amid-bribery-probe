Avon Products Inc. (AVP) , in the midst of
investigations into alleged overseas bribery, named John Lin to
run its China unit.  Lin currently heads operations in Canada, Jennifer Vargas,
a company spokeswoman, said today in an e-mail.  The appointment comes as Avon searches for a replacement
for Chief Executive Officer  Andrea Jung , who will remain
chairman at the New York-based company.  Avon is the subject of a U.S. grand jury investigation into
whether ex-employees in China bribed officials, in violation of
U.S. anti-corruption laws, according to a person familiar with
the matter. In regulatory filings last year, Avon disclosed the
firing of four executives suspected of paying bribes to
officials in China.  Last month Avon said Charles Cramb, vice chairman of its
developed market group, left the company amid the internal
investigation into bribery. Cramb, who was previously chief
financial officer, departed on Jan. 29, Avon said in a filing.  The world’s largest door-to-door cosmetics seller is
seeking cost reductions and ways to boost sales as it faces
heightened competition from larger cosmetics makers such as
 Procter & Gamble Co. (PG)   The Wall Street Journal earlier reported Lin’s appointment.  Avon fell 2.2 percent to $19.19 at the close in  New York .
The shares tumbled 40 percent last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
