Ivory Coast  will award four third-
generation mobile-phone licenses as soon as next month and
require Internet cafes to register their users in a bid to cut
down on online crime, said Information Technology Minister Bruno Kone.  “We want to get it done as soon as possible” Kone said in
an interview in Abidjan, the commercial capital, today. “We
even considered moving directly towards 4G, but that would been
technically too demanding on the operators.”  The licenses will cost 6 billion  CFA francs  ($12 million)
each, Kone said. On Feb. 1, the government told
telecommunications operators and owners of public Internet cafes
to register current and new users as part of a nationwide
campaign to combat cybercrime, he said. Mobile-phone operators
have a year to register users.     “We need to clean up our bad reputation as a regional
capital of cybercrime, a reputation that we have had for several
years now,” Kone said.  The West African nation has about 16 million mobile phone
subscriptions and five active operators, including Orange Cote
d’Ivoire, a unit of France Telecom SA,  MTN Group Ltd. (MTN)  of  South
Africa  and Moov, a unit of Emirates Telecommunications Corp.  To contact the reporter on this story:
