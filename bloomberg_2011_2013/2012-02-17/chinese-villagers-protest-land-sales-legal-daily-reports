More than 200 residents of the
Chinese village of Panhe in Zhejiang Province organized three
protests from Feb. 1 to Feb. 5 after local authorities sold land
without making the information public, the state-run Legal Daily
reported on Feb. 15.  The Panhe local government took land that the villagers
have been farming for decades, the newspaper said without giving
details. There should have been a settlement package of 16,000
yuan ($2,539) per mu (0.067 hectare), it said, citing Lu
Mingshu, a local villager.  The villagers have failed since last July to reach an
agreement with the local government on a compensation settlement
and the requirement for an audit, the newspaper said.  Ding Zhenjun, the party secretary for Longgang County,
which oversees Panhe, said the disputes between the local
government and the villagers were caused by the villagers’ lack
of understanding of “relevant law and rules,” the newspaper
reported.  -- Yidi Zhao. Editors: Paul Tighe, Patrick Harrington  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
