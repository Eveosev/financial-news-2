OAO Mechel (MTLR) , Russia’s largest
producer of coal for steelmaking, fell in New York after saying
it would halt production at two plants in Romania as cold
weather in Europe disrupted scrap supplies.  American depositary receipts  of the company declined 0.4
percent to $10.75 at 10:52 a.m. in U.S. trading, after falling
as much as 1.8 percent. The stock, which lost 71 percent last
year, has gained 26 percent this year.  Production at the Mechel Targoviste and Ductil Steel Otelu
Rosu plants will be temporarily halted beginning tomorrow
because colder-than-usual weather in the region led to
disruption of raw materials supplies, Mechel said in an e-mailed
statement. It did not indicate when production may resume.  To contact the reporters on this story:
