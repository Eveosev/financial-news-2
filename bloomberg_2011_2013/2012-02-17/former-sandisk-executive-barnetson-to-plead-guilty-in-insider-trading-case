Donald Barnetson, a former  SanDisk
Corp. (SNDK)  senior marketing director, will plead guilty today in an
insider trading investigation, records in Manhattan federal
court show.  Barnetson left SanDisk in early 2011, according to Lee
Flanagin, a spokesman for the Milpitas, California-based maker
of flash-memory cards.  In criminal charges filed against John Kinnucan, an expert
networker in Portland, Oregon, prosecutors claim that on Sept.
10, 2010, Kinnucan called an unidentified SanDisk employee who
gave him inside information about confidential negotiations
between his company and Apple Inc.  “The SanDisk insider has been cooperating with the
government in the hope of receiving leniency,” according to the
criminal complaint against Kinnucan.  To contact the reporters on this story:
