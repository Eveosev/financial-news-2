Corporate bond sales in the U.S.
fell to $15.4 billion this week, the lowest level of 2012, as
evidence mounted that a credit market rally was losing momentum.  Total SA (FP) , Europe’s third-largest oil producer, issued $2
billion of debt in its biggest offering since June 2010,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Torrance, California-
based  Toyota Motor Credit Corp. (5672A)  got its lowest-ever bond coupon
as it sold $1.25 billion of three-year notes, the data show.  Issuance fell 61 percent from last week’s $39.8 billion and
the commercial paper market declined for the first time since
the period ended Jan. 4 as European leaders wrangled over
further assistance to  Greece . Returns on company debt have
fallen to 0.02 percent in February, after a gain of 4.42 percent
in the preceding two months, according to the Bank of America
Merrill Lynch U.S. Corporate & High Yield Master Index.  “We’ve definitely seen a slowdown,” Rob Crimmins, a New
York-based money manager at RS Investments, which oversees $30
billion, said in a telephone interview. “Corporations have
fortified their balance sheets so they don’t need to issue and
with all the global economic uncertainty, they’re not sure if
they should invest.”  Investment-grade corporate bond yields climbed this week to
3.55 percent, since reaching a record low of 3.45 percent on
Aug. 4, Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data show. Yields on
high-yield, high-risk bonds, rated below Baa3 by Moody’s
Investors Service and less than BBB- by  Standard & Poor’s ,
declined to 7.75 percent from 8.54 percent at the end of 2011,
the index data show.  Sales this week compare with a 2012 average of $33.8
billion, Bloomberg data show.  Total Offering  Total, based in Paris, issued $1 billion of five-year, 1.5
percent bonds and the same amount of 10-year, 2.875 percent debt
on Feb. 14, Bloomberg data show. The offering was its largest
since it tapped the market for $2.5 billion on June 17, 2010. BP
Plc and Royal Dutch Shell Plc are Europe’s two biggest oil
producers.  Toyota Motor Credit issued 1 percent notes due February
2015 in its second U.S. offering of fixed-rate bonds this year
on Feb. 14, Bloomberg data show. It issued $2 billion split
between five-year, 2.05 percent debt and 10-year, 3.3 percent
bonds on Jan. 9. Investment-grade borrowers issued a total of
$12.2 billion of bonds, down 64 percent from the seven days
through Feb. 10.  Chesapeake Energy Corp., the second-largest U.S. natural-
gas producer after Exxon Mobil Corp., and Rite Aid Corp. were
among junk-rated companies selling  $3.1 billion of debt this
week, a 49 percent decline from the previous period, Bloomberg
data show.  Commercial Paper Falls  The seasonally adjusted amount of U.S. commercial paper
 outstanding  fell by $10.8 billion to $962.1 billion in the week
ended Feb. 15, the  Federal Reserve  said yesterday on its
website. That was the first time the market has contracted since
dropping $30.1 billion for the period ended Jan. 4, according to
Fed data compiled by Bloomberg.  The pace of issuance slowed as European creditor countries
tussled over how future aid is spent on Greece and the region’s
finance ministers put off a decision on 130 billion euros ($171
billion) of assistance until at least Feb. 20. Concerns that an
agreement might be delayed outweighed a Labor Department report
that Americans filed 348,000  claims  for jobless benefits last
week, the fewest since 2008.  “The economic data here in the U.S. is still looking
pretty positive,” Crimmins said. “We expect the U.S. to
continue to grow, but the concern is with what’s going on in
 Europe .”  To contact the reporter on this story:
