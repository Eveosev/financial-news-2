The  New York Yankees  agreed to trade
starting pitcher A.J. Burnett to the Pittsburgh Pirates for two
prospects and about $13 million in salary relief, the  New York 
Post reported today.  The Pirates will pay more than a third of the $33 million
remaining on the right-handed pitcherâ€™s contract in a deal that
is awaiting approval from Major League Baseball Commissioner  Bud Selig , the newspaper reported without saying where it obtained
the information. It said the deal should be approved by baseball
Commissioner Bud Selig by tomorrow.  The Yankees signed Burnett to a five-year, $82.5 million
contract before the 2009 season, making him at the time the
fourth-highest-paid pitcher in baseball, according to a USA
Today salary database. He struggled in the past two seasons,
posting the two highest single-season earned-run averages of his
13-year career.  In 10 seasons with the  Toronto Blue Jays  and  Florida
Marlins  prior to joining the Yankees, Burnett was 87-76, with a
3.81 earned-run average and 8.4 strikeouts, 3.7 walks and 7.8
hits allowed per nine innings. All of those metrics worsened in
his three seasons in New York, where he was 34-35 with a 4.79
ERA, and 7.9 strikeouts, 4.0 walks and 9.0 hits allowed per nine
innings.  One of the prospects involved in the trade is right-handed
relief pitcher Diego Moreno, who advanced to the Double-A level
last season, the Post said. The other player, is unknown, the
newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
