PetroEcuador, a state-owned oil
company, may award  ConocoPhillips (COP)  a public contract to buy 5.04
million barrels of the country’s Oriente crude, Quito-based
newspaper El Comercio said, citing PetroEcuador officials it
didn’t identify.  Vietnam Oil & Gas Group, known as PetroVietnam, and  BP Plc (BP/) ,
are the top contenders for a bid to buy an additional 2.52
million barrels of the crude, the  newspaper  said today, citing
the officials.  A PetroEcuador press officer, who asked not to be
identified because they aren’t authorized to speak publicly,
couldn’t confirm the story and said the company will announce
the winners today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
