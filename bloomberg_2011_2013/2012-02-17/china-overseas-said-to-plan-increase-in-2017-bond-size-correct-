(Corrects coupon in first paragraph.)  China Overseas Land & Investment
Ltd. (688) , a developer with projects in 34 cities and regions in
mainland  China , Hong Kong and Macau, plans to increase its
existing 4.875 percent dollar bonds, according to a person with
direct knowledge of the matter.  The company may sell as much as $200 million more of the
bond, which matures in February 2017, said the person, who
declined to be identified because the details are private.  The notes are being marketed to yield 405 basis points more
than similar-maturity treasuries, the person said.  Polly Tong, a spokeswoman at China Overseas Land, was not
immediately available for comment when called at her offices in
Hong Kong.  Deutsche Bank AG, JPMorgan Chase & Co., ICBC International
and HSBC Holdings Plc, the same banks that arranged the original
$500 million sale on Feb. 9, are managing the increase, said the
person.  The company has a $300 million bond outstanding that will
mature in July, the data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
