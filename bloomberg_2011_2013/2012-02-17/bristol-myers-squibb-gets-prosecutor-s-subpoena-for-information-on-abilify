Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. (BMY)  said it
received a subpoena from the U.S. attorney’s office in New York
asking for information about sales and marketing of its second-
best-selling drug, Abilify, used to treat schizophrenia and
other mood disorders.  “It’s not possible at this time to assess the outcome of
this matter or its potential impact on the company,” the New
York-based firm said in a filing today with the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission. The subpoena was received last month.  The Abilify antipsychotic drug generated $2.8 billion in
revenue in 2011, second after the blood thinner Plavix in the
company’s portfolio, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Abilify faces generic competition in 2013 and 2015 and Plavix
loses patent protection this year, the company has said.  Shares of Bistol-Myers Squibb rose 62 cents or 1.9 percent
to $32.66 in  New York  Stock Exchange composite trading at 10:13
a.m.  Laura Hortas, a company spokeswoman, declined to comment
on the subpoena beyond the company’s statement.  To contact the reporters on this story:
