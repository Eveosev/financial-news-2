The owners of the  New York Mets 
asked a judge again to dismiss a $386 million lawsuit by the
liquidator of Bernard Madoff’s brokerage, saying he distorted
the law by alleging they were willfully blind to the fraud.
Madoff trustee  Irving Picard  hasn’t offered evidence that they
believed fraud was probable and deliberately avoided looking
into it, they said in a filing yesterday in U.S. District Court
in Manhattan.  Separately, the trustee asked the judge to let him claim
$83 million from the Mets owners.  To contact the reporter on this story:
