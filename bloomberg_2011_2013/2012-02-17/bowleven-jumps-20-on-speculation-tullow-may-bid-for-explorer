BowLeven Plc (BLVN) , the U.K. oil explorer
focused on Cameroon, jumped as much 20 percent in London on
speculation that  Tullow Oil Plc (TLW)  may bid for the company.  The  shares  jumped as much as 14.75 pence to 88.75 pence in
London trading, the biggest gain since Oct. 14. The shares
traded at 87 pence at 11:24 a.m. local time.  “The shares are rising on speculation” that Tullow may
make a bid, Tracy MacKenzie, an analyst at Brewin Dolphin
Securities Ltd., said by phone. Spokesmen for London-based
Tullow and Edinburgh-based BowLeven declined to comment.  BowLeven raised $124 million in a share sale on Oct. 19
with a 36 percent increase in ordinary stock capital. The funds
will be used for a drilling program this year. The shares surged
60 percent on Oct. 14 after the Sapele-3 well discovered oil in
the Douala Basin at the Etinde permit in Cameroon.  “We think more likely than not that BowLeven will partner
and secure funding,” said Stuart Joyner, an analyst at Investec
Securities in  London . “That would be positive for the shares
but its negotiating position is weak and downside risks in the
event of a no deal are considerable.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
