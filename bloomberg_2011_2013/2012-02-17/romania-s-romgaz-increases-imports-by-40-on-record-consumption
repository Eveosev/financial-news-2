Romgaz SA,  Romania ’s natural gas
company, said it’s increased imports by 40 percent this month
because of record consumption amid freezing temperatures,
according to an e-mailed statement today.  Twenty-two million cubic meters of gas will be imported
during the remainder of the month to cover domestic demand, the
company said in the statement.  The Romanian government said on Feb.15 it will limit
exports of electricity as domestic consumption reached the
highest level in a decade.  To contact the reporter on this story:
