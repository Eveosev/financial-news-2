The average ticket price to watch
the  New York  Knicks attempt to win their eighth straight game
tonight is $557 on the secondary market, tripling in price since
Jeremy Lin first joined the starting lineup less than two weeks
ago, according to TiqIQ.  Tickets to the game at Madison Square Garden in  Manhattan 
against the New Orleans Hornets, with a 5-23 record, were
averaging $181 on Feb. 7, the day after Lin’s first start,
according to  TiqIQ , an aggregator of the online resale market.  The average ticket price for the Knicks’ next game, against
the defending-champion  Dallas Mavericks  on Feb. 19, is $769 on
the secondary market, according to TiqIQ.  Lin, a 23-year-old Harvard University graduate who is the
first Taiwanese- or Chinese-American to play in the  National
Basketball Association , was a little-used reserve who had been
cut by two teams before getting 25 points and seven assists in a
win over the  New Jersey Nets  on Feb. 4. He’s averaged 24.4
points and 9.1 assists during the streak, making him an
immediate team leader and an international sensation.  The average Knicks’ home ticket price for the entire season
is now $282, which is 23 percent higher than the $230 average
price on Feb. 3, according to TiqIQ. The price of the Hornets
ticket has increased by 207 percent.  If New York (15-15) beats the Hornets, it will be tied for
the 11th-longest win streak in franchise history.  Victories over the Hornets and the Mavericks (19-11) would
give New York a nine-game winning streak, tied for the seventh-
longest in team history and the most since a 15-game run that
began on March 1, 1994. That season ended with a seven-game loss
to the  Houston Rockets  in the NBA Finals.  To contact the reporter on this story:
