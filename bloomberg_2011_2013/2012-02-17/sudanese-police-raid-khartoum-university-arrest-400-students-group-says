Sudanese police raided Khartoum
University today, arresting about 400 students, said Ahmed
Samir, spokesman for  Sudan  Change Now, a youth movement in the
North African country.  Police cars cordoned off the university’s dormitory and
closed all roads leading to the campus, Samir said in a phone
interview from the capital, Khartoum. All of the students in the
dormitory were escorted out of the university by armed
policemen, he said.  Al-Ser Ahmed Omar, spokesman for Sudan’s police force,
didn’t answer his mobile phone when Bloomberg called him seeking
comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
