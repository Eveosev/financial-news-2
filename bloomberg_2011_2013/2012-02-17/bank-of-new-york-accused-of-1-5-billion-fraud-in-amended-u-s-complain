Bank of New York Mellon Corp. , the
world’s largest custody bank, defrauded clients of more than
$1.5 billion through foreign-exchange trades, according to a new
complaint by the U.S. government.  The bank “repeatedly lied” about a service for foreign
currency transactions and defrauded clients, including pension
funds and federally insured financial institutions, of more than
$1.5 billion, the U.S. Attorney’s Office in  Manhattan  said in an
amended complaint. It was filed last night, according to the
office.  “Standing instruction was so much more profitable to BNYM
than any other foreign exchange service because it relied on a
fraudulent business model,”  Preet Bharara , the U.S. Attorney in
Manhattan, said in the filing.  The government’s lawsuit is one of several brought against
the bank, including one by  New York  Attorney General  Eric Schneiderman , alleging it defrauded clients through its so-
called standing instruction foreign-exchange service.  In the first complaint filed in October, the U.S.
Attorney’s Office said the bank defrauded clients of “hundreds
of millions of dollars.” Part of the lawsuit was resolved under
an agreement approved last month.  “As we have said before regarding this lawsuit, we believe
it is without merit, and we will defend ourselves in court,”
said Kevin Heine, a Bank of New York spokesman.  The case is U.S. v.  Bank of New York Mellon Corp. (BK) , 11-6969,
U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
