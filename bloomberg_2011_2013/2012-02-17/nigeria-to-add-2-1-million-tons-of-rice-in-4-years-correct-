(Corrects to show production figure is additional output.)  Nigeria  will raise its annual rice
production by 2.1 million metric tons within the next four
years, making the West African nation self-sufficient in output
of the staple crop, said Agriculture Minister Akinwunmi Adesina.  The country will sign a deal with U.S.-based Dominion Farms
Ltd. to start a 300,000-ton, $40 million rice farm that would be
the biggest of its kind in  Africa , he told reporters in Abuja,
the capital, today. The plantationâ€™s output will save Nigeria 54
billion naira annually in rice-import costs, Adesina said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
