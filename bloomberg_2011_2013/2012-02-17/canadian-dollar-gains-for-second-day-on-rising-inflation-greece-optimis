The Canadian dollar traded within a
cent of the strongest level in three months against its U.S.
counterpart amid bets  Greece  will win a bailout and a government
report that showed the inflation rate unexpectedly accelerated.  The currency gained for the week as investor appetite for
risk increased after German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  and Greek
Prime Minister  Lucas Papademos  expressed optimism a deal on
Greece can be reached at a meeting of euro-area finance
ministers on Feb. 20. Crude oil,  Canada ’s biggest export,
climbed to a nine-month high.  “Overall, the market is oscillating back and forth on
Greek headlines, although it seems that it’s highly unlikely
that they don’t get a deal done,” said Firas Askari, head
currency trader at Bank of Montreal in Toronto.  Canada’s currency was little changed at 99.68 cents per
 U.S. dollar  at 5 p.m. in Toronto after gaining as much as 0.3
percent to 99.41 cents and weakening 0.2 percent to 99.85 cents.
It touched 99.26 cents on Feb. 9, the strongest since Oct. 31.
One Canadian dollar buys $1.0032. The currency rose 0.5 percent
for the week.  The currency, nicknamed the loonie for the image of the
waterfowl on the C$1 coin, reached its low of the day after U.S.
stocks briefly erased gains as optimism on Greece failed to
drive the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index above last year’s peak.
The gauge later rose 0.2 percent.  Crude oil for March delivery gained 1.7 percent to $104.06
a barrel in New York and touched $104.14, the most since May 11.  Volatility Declines  Implied volatility for one-month options on the Canadian
dollar versus the greenback fell for the first time in four days
after jumping yesterday to the highest intraday level in two
weeks, 8.61 percent. It touched 7.77 percent today after
reaching 7.66 percent on Feb. 10, the least since April. Implied
volatility, which traders quote and use to set option prices,
signals the expected pace of currency swings. It averaged 10
percent over the past year.  The Canadian  consumer price index  rose 2.5 percent in
January from a year earlier after December’s 2.3 percent gain,
Ottawa-based  Statistics Canada  said. Economists in a Bloomberg
News survey forecast the rate would stay at the previous level.
It advanced 0.4 percent in January after falling 0.6 percent the
previous month.  The loonie remained stronger versus the greenback as U.S.
Labor Department data showed American consumer prices rose last
month less than forecast. They gained 0.2 percent, after no
change in the previous month. Over the past year, prices
increased 2.9 percent, the smallest year-to-year advance since
March 2011.  Aid to Greece  The Canadian dollar fell against the euro for a second day,
slipping 0.1 percent to C$1.3099, after a conference call
between the leaders of  Italy , Greece and  Germany .  European governments are considering cutting  interest rates 
on emergency loans to Greece and using contributions from the
 European Central Bank  to plug a new financing gap in the second
Greek bailout, two people familiar with the talks said
yesterday. The euro pared gains versus the loonie and greenback
on concern an ECB swap of Greek bonds for new ones may trigger
rating cuts.  Canadian  government bonds  fell, pushing benchmark 10-year
note yields up two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 2
percent.  Five-year note  yields increased as much as four basis
points to 1.48 percent, the highest since Nov. 30, before
trading at 1.45 percent. The government sold C$3.5 billion ($3.5
billion) of five-year debt this week.  Canada will auction C$400 million of inflation-linked
securities on Feb. 22, according to a statement on the Bank of
Canada’s website. The 1.5 percent real-return bonds mature in
December 2044.  The Canadian dollar rose 1.8 percent over the past three
months against nine developed-nation counterparts monitored by
Bloomberg Correlation Weighted Currency Indexes. The U.S. dollar
weakened 1.7 percent, and the euro dropped 4.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
