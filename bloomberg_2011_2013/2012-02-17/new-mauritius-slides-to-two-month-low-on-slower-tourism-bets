New Mauritius Hotels Ltd. (NMH) , the
country’s biggest leisure operator by market value, declined to
its lowest level in more than two months on bets of a weaker
tourism season.  The  stock  retreated for a second day to its lowest intraday
level since Dec. 5, down 2 percent to 74.50 rupees by 12:27 p.m.
in Port Louis, the capital.  “Tourism arrivals in January dropped 3 percent, a second
month of decline, which is a cause of concern for the industry
right now,” Kishen Nadassen, senior research analyst at CIM
Stockbrokers Ltd., said in a phone interview from Port Louis.
“Expectations are negative” for the season starting April and
continuing until September, Nadassen said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
