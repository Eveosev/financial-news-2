U.K. stocks  rose for the first time
in four days as investors speculated government officials may be
nearing an agreement on a bailout for Greece and the U.S.
economy is recovering.  Banks, led by  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) , pulled the benchmark FTSE
100 Index higher. Anglo American Plc advanced 1.1 percent after
reporting earnings that beat estimates.  BowLeven Plc (BLVN) , a U.K. oil
explorer working in Cameroon, soared 62 percent as  Dragon Oil
Plc (DGO)  said it is considering a takeover offer.  Ashmore Group Plc (ASHM) 
fell 1.9 percent after HSBC cut its rating.  The  FTSE 100  rose 19.69, or 0.3 percent, to 5,905.07 at the
market close in London, extending this week’s increase to 0.9
percent amid optimism Greece will win a bailout and better-than-
expected U.S. economic data. The gauge has  climbed 19 percent 
from last year’s lowest level on Oct. 4. The FTSE All-Share
Index gained 0.4 percent today, while Ireland’s ISEQ Index added
1.4 percent.  “The 5,900 level seems to be holding as the FTSE ends the
week,” said Yusuf Heusen, a sales trader at IG Index in London.
“Broad risk appetite is driving markets higher.”  Stocks rallied as investors anticipated the culmination of
a seven-month effort to complete a second Greek bailout. As long
as  Greece  meets conditions for the aid, euro-area finance chiefs
will probably approve the package along with a debt swap with
private creditors, coalition lawmakers were told by German
officials yesterday.  U.S. Economy  The index of U.S. leading indicators gained and cost of
living rose less than forecast. The Conference Board’s gauge of
the outlook for the next three to six months increased 0.4
percent in January, following a 0.5 percent rise in December.

change in December, less than the 0.3 percent average forecast
by economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  U.K.  retail sales  unexpectedly advanced for a second month
in January as discounting at furniture and household-goods
stores lured customers. Sales including fuel rose 0.9 percent
from December, when they added 0.6 percent, the Office for
National Statistics said today in London. Economists had
forecast a 0.3 percent decline, according to the median of 20
estimates in a Bloomberg News survey.  A  gauge  of banking stocks rose 1.1 percent amid speculation
the euro area’s debt crisis may be contained. HSBC,  Europe ’s
biggest bank, added 0.7 percent to 577.7 pence.  RBS, Lloyds  Royal Bank of Scotland Plc rallied 3.2 percent to 27.6
pence,  Barclays Plc (BARC)  increased 1.4 percent to 248.35 pence and

Turkmenistan said it is in preliminary talks to make a bid for
the company. Dragon Oil rose 0.6 percent to 547 pence.  Spectris Plc (SXS)  gained 2.7 percent to 1,705 pence after the

initiatives will “take time to change customer perception and
behavior.” News on the U.K.’s largest grocery chain will
