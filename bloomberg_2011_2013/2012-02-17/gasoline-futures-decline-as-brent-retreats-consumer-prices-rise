Gasoline fell for the first time in
three days as  Brent crude  slipped and a rise in U.S. consumer
prices boosted concern that demand for the fuel may decline.  Futures retreated as Brent sank 0.5 percent in  London ,
lowering the cost to produce fuel in Europe, a key source of
U.S. imports. Prices also dropped as the consumer-price index
increased 0.2 percent, the Labor Department reported today in
 Washington .  “It’s following Brent to a great degree,”  John Kilduff , a
partner at Again Capital LLC, a New York-based hedge fund that
focuses on energy, said by phone.  March-delivery gasoline fell 2.9 cents, or 1 percent, to
$3.0181 a gallon at 1:47 p.m. on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  after touching $3.0021. Futures have gained 12 percent
this year.  Brent crude for April settlement dropped 59 cents to
$119.52 a barrel at 1:48 p.m. on the ICE Futures  Europe 
exchange.  Consumer prices rose after no change the prior month.
Economists surveyed by Bloomberg forecast a 0.3 percent gain.
During the past 12 months, prices climbed 2.9 percent, the
smallest year-over-year advance since March 2011.  U.S. gasoline demand last week was the lowest level for
this time of year in weekly data since 2003, Energy Department
data show. Consumption over the past four weeks was 6.4 percent
below a year earlier.  Demand Down  “Demand-wise we’re down and supply doesn’t appear to be
under any kind of jeopardy of being tight,” Kilduff said.  Regular gasoline  at the pump, averaged nationwide, rose 0.6
cent to $3.529 yesterday, according to AAA data. Prices were 12
percent higher than a year earlier.  “High gasoline prices are going to put a crimp in growth
at some point, but it’s not going to stop growth,” Carl Larry,
president of the New York City-based Oil Outlooks & Opinions
LLC, said by phone. “We are going to get used to this, we are
going to change our driving patterns. It’s not going to slow the
path of recovery.”  Heating oil for March delivery fell 2.39 cents, or 0.7
percent, to $3.1858 a gallon on the exchange. Futures have
advanced 8.6 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
