U.S. stocks  rallied this week,
putting the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index 0.2 percent away from
erasing its losses since April, amid optimism Greece will get
another bailout and better-than-estimated economic data.  All  10 groups  in the S&P 500 rose as energy and technology
companies posted the biggest gains, increasing at least 1.7
percent.  Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ) ,  Home Depot Inc. (HD)  and Intel Corp.
added more than 2.6 percent, leading the  Dow Jones Industrial
Average  higher.  Frontier Communications Corp. (FTR)  climbed 18 percent
after cutting its dividend to reduce debt.  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  climbed
1.8 percent, exceeding $500 for the first time.  The S&P 500 added 1.4 percent to 1,361.23, rallying for the
sixth time in seven weeks. The index is less than 3 points away
from completing its recovery from a 19 percent retreat between
April and October. Topping 1,363.61 would put the measure at the
highest level since 2008. The Dow climbed 148.64 points, or 1.2
percent, to 12,949.87.  “We’ve seen the promise of a solution to  Greece , and we’ve
moved closer to it,”  Mark Bronzo , who helps manage about $24
billion at Security Global Investors in Irvington, New York,
said in a telephone interview. “The U.S. economic data
continues to be better, especially on the jobs front, so the
market continues to move higher.”  Global equities rallied as Germany expressed confidence
that euro-area governments will agree on a 130 billion-euro
($171 billion) rescue for Greece within days, while seeking to
keep a bond swap of the nation’s debt on track. German
Chancellor Angela Merkel, Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti and
Greek Prime Minister  Lucas Papademos  discussed plans in a
conference call and are optimistic finance ministers will
resolve remaining issues when they meet on Feb. 20.  Jobs, Manufacturing  The  S&P 500  has climbed 8.2 percent in 2012. Stocks also
rose this week as reports on jobless claims, manufacturing and
housing boosted optimism in the world’s largest economy.  Applications for jobless benefits decreased by 13,000 last
week to 348,000, less than the lowest forecast in a Bloomberg
survey of economists and the fewest since March 2008. The
 Philadelphia Fed (OUTFGAF) ’s general economic index increased to 10.2,
topping the median economist forecast for a reading of 9.
Housing starts increased 1.5 percent to a 699,000 annual rate
and building permits increased.  U.S. stocks may extend gains this year and mirror the
performance of 1995, when the  S&P 500  rallied 34 percent even
after Mexico devalued its currency and Treasury yields dropped,
 Laszlo Birinyi , the president of Birinyi Associates Inc. in
Westport, Connecticut, said in a Bloomberg Television interview
this week.  ‘Buy Stocks’  “We still think you should buy stocks,” the  fund manager 
said in  London . “It’s a continuation of the bull market and
we’re encouraged by what we are seeing in  Europe . I look at the
markets, I find they are strong. There’s real buying going on.
This is not short covering or a temporary or transitory thing.”  Blackstone Group LP’s  Byron Wien  said he may need to lift
his estimate for the S&P 500 for this year. Wien, chairman of
Blackstone’s advisory services unit, said in January in his
annual “10 Surprises” list the benchmark gauge for U.S. stocks
may exceed 1,400.  That forecast, “when the market was 1,250 at the beginning
of the year, was a reasonable target, a conservative target,”
Wien said in an interview. “But I think we could well exceed
it. Look, S&P 500 operating earnings are going to be in excess
of $100. Very often, almost always, the S&P 500 sells at 15
times, that would take you over 1,500.”  Energy, Technology  All 10 groups in the S&P 500 rallied. Energy stocks led
gains, rising 2.2 percent, as oil posted its biggest weekly
advance this year. Technology stocks climbed the second-most,
adding 1.7 percent.  Hewlett-Packard, the largest computer maker, added 3.1
percent to $29.59 for the biggest gain in the Dow.  Intel (INTC) , the
biggest chipmaker, climbed 2.5 percent to $27.37, its highest
level since December 2007. All but three companies in the 30-
stock Dow advanced. Home Depot, the world’s largest home-
improvement retailer, rose 3 percent to $46.71, its  highest
level  since May 2002.  Frontier Communications climbed 18 percent to $4.78 for the
biggest gain in the S&P 500. The U.S. phone company serving
rural markets cut its quarterly dividend to 10 cents from 18.75
cents so it can pay off debt. Frontier also beat the average
analyst profit estimate by 32 percent.  Apple advanced 1.8 percent to $502.12. It closed at $509.46
on Feb. 14 after rallying eight straight days.  Devon Energy Corp. (DVN)  gained 16 percent, its biggest weekly
rally since May 2009, to $74.95. The biggest independent oil and
natural-gas producer in the U.S. reported fourth-quarter
earnings that  beat analysts’  estimates and said it plans to cut
spending on exploration and production to no more than $5.5
billion in 2012, from $6.9 billion last year.  Dean Foods Co. (DF)  rose 13 percent, its biggest gain since May,
to $12.07. The largest U.S. dairy processor forecast  first-
quarter earnings  excluding some items of as much as 23 cents a
share, more than the average analyst estimate of 19 cents.  To contact the reporters on this story:
