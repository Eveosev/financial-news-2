Index  rose 0.9 percent to 60,543.23 as of 2:52 p.m. in Istanbul,
increasing its weekly gain to 2 percent.  The following stocks are active. Stock symbols are in
parentheses.  Arcelik AS (ARCLK)  , Turkey’s biggest producer of
household appliances, gained 1.9 percent to 7.70 liras. The
company is a “buy” even though its fourth quarter results were
weaker as growth in white goods will continue in 2012 and cost
pressures will ease, Citigroup’s brokerage in Turkey said.  Emlak Konut Gayrimenkul Yatirim Ortakligi AS (EKGYO)  ,
Turkey’s largest real estate developer, climbed 1.8 percent to
2.28 liras. BGC Partners in Istanbul upgraded the company to
“buy” following its underperformance relative to the overall
index in the past three months and on expectations that legal
changes would benefit the real estate sector.  Eregli Demir & Celik Fabrikalari AS  (EREGL TI), Turkey’s
largest steelmaker, added 3.1 percent to 3.99 liras. The company
has announced a bonus for its shareholders, giving away 0.44
units for every share held. The bonus shares issue will cost the
company 940 million liras ($534 million).  To contact the reporter on this story:
