Ghana, West Africa’s second-biggest
economy, plans to use the second tranche of funding from the
U.S. Millennium Challenge Corp. to boost investments in energy
production.  “We are looking at total  energy supply , from gas,
electricity, solar to wind energy,” Martin Eson-Benjamin, chief
executive officer of the Millennium Development Authority, the
aid agency’s local unit, said by phone from Accra, the capital,
yesterday.  Ghana’s first funding tranche, worth $547 million, ended
this week with the inauguration of a 14-kilometer (8.7-mile)
highway in the city by President John Atta Mills. Funds were
used for other infrastructure and agriculture projects in the
world’s second-biggest cocoa producer.  Ghana plans to boost electricity production to 3,300
megawatts by the end of 2013 from 1,800 megawatts in 2009, Mills
said yesterday.  Studies are being conducted to decide on new energy
projects and a proposal will be sent to the U.S. agency, which
agreed on  Ghana ’s second deal in January 2011, said Eson-
Benjamin.  The amount will be “determined based on studies that will
be conducted,” said Daniel Yohannes, chief executive officer of
the MCC, in an interview in capital, Accra, Feb. 14.  Africa accounts for about 70 percent of the corporation’s
total funding of $5.2 billion, with 11 countries at various
stages of completion of their funding plans, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
