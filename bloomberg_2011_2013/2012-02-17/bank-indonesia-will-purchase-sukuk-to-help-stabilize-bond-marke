Indonesia ’s central bank will buy
Islamic government debt to help prevent volatility in the bond
market and to increase Shariah-compliant financial instruments,
Bank Indonesia said in a statement on its website.  “It’s important to improve the Shariah market, also for
building stock for us,” Hendar, director of monetary policy at
the central bank, said in a mobile-phone text message today.  Bank Indonesia  purchased  government bonds  in the secondary
market to help stabilize the rupiah and bond markets
simultaneously, while also increasing the supply of government
bonds in the central bank’s portfolio, Governor Darmin Nasution
said Feb. 10.  The nation’s currency gained 0.5 percent to 9,046 per
dollar as of 4:58 p.m. in Jakarta, according to prices from
local banks compiled by Bloomberg.  Bank Indonesia  held around
70 trillion rupiah of government bonds, Nasution said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
