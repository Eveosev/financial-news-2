Coffee prices in  Brazil , the world’s
largest producer, extended a decline as arabica futures tumbled
and touched the lowest price in 15 months yesterday, local
brokers said.  The price of fine cup arabica beans is 420 reais ($245) to
450 reais for a 60-kilogram (132-pound) bag, according to
Flavour Coffee. That compares with 480 reais on Feb. 3, when the
price fell below 500 reais for the first time since August, the
Rio de Janeiro-based broker said, and 470 reais to 480 reais on
Feb. 9.  Arabica futures dropped for a seventh consecutive day
yesterday, falling to as low as $1.978 a pound, the lowest price
for the most active contract since Nov. 4, 2010, on expectations
of a big harvest in Brazil in the season starting in July. The
commodity for May delivery was little changed at $2.0145 by 8:25
a.m. today on ICE Futures U.S.  It’s a “scary movie for many people, especially for some
producers,” Thiago Cazarini, a broker at Varginha, Brazil-based
Cazarini Trading Co., wrote in a report yesterday. “If prices
keep coming down it won’t take long for them to sell a lot of
the stocks they have.”  Coffee output in Brazil will rise to a record 49 million to
52.3 million bags this year, from 43.5 million last year, the
 Agriculture Ministry ’s crop-forecasting agency, known as Conab,
estimated on Jan. 10.  The “local market followed ICE falls this week, with
prices trading as low as 420 reais, a quite impressive drop,”
Flavour Coffee said in a report e-mailed yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
