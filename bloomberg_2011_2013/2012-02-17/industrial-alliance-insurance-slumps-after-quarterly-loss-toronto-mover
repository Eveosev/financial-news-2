Industrial Alliance Insurance and
Financial Services Inc.,  Canada ’s fourth-largest life insurer,
fell the most in three months after reporting a fourth-quarter
 loss .  Industrial Alliance slipped as much as 5.7 percent to C$25,
its biggest one-day drop since Nov. 3. It declined 2.7 percent
to C$25.79 as of 1 p.m. in Toronto trading.  The insurer reported today a net loss of C$81.2 million
($81.4 million), or 90 cents a share, compared with year-earlier
profit of C$74.1 million, or 84 cents. The Quebec City, Quebec-
based company boosted reserves by C$152.3 million to protect
against a drop in interest rates.  “Our year-end results reflect the extremely challenging
environment in 2011,” Chief Executive Officer Yvon Charest said
in a statement.  Industrial Alliance said it expects earn C$2.50 to C$3.10 a
share in 2012. That compares with a C$3.09  average estimate  of
10 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News.  To contact the reporter on this story:
