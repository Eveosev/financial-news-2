English soccer club Portsmouth went
into administration today for the second time in two years.  Trevor Birch, who works at the PKF accounting firm, will be
the executive to run the club while it attempts to get out of
administration, Portsmouth said today on its website.  The team has been run by accountants UHY Hacker Young since
parent Convers Sports Initiatives Plc entered administration on
Nov. 29. CSI, a U.K.-based investment vehicle used by former
owner  Vladimir Antonov  to buy Portsmouth, defaulted on an
interest payment to former owner Balram Chainrai.  “Our aim is to achieve an outcome that helps ensure the
club’s long term survival, preferably by finding a suitable
buyer,” Birch said in an e-mailed statement. “We will now
begin discussions with the club’s stakeholders with a view to
getting Portsmouth out of administration as soon as is
practically possible. Until then, our intention is to stabilise
the situation and keep the club running on a day-to-day basis.”  Creditors include electricity suppliers that have
threatened to cut the team off, UHY’s Peter Kubik said in an
interview earlier this week.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
