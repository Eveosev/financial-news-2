Lloyd Blankfein , chief executive
officer of  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  since 2006, may step down as
early as the U.S. summer, Fortune Magazine reported today,
citing an unnamed executive at the firm.  Gary Cohn, president and chief operating officer, is the
board’s top candidate to replace Blankfein, according to the
report. Blankfein’s departure isn’t certain, Fortune wrote.
David Wells, a spokesman for the New York-based firm, declined
to comment.  Goldman Sachs’s 2011 earnings dropped 47 percent to the
lowest level since 2008 on a second consecutive annual decline
in fixed-income trading revenue. Blankfein has sought to repair
the firm’s reputation after the Securities and Exchange
Commission and a Senate subcommittee accused the company of
misleading buyers of mortgage-linked investments.  J.  Michael Evans , a vice chairman who runs Goldman Sachs
business in growth markets, has tried to position himself to
replace Blankfein, Fortune reported. He hasn’t won the support
of the board, Fortune said.  Goldman Sachs shares have jumped 28 percent in 2012 after
plunging 46 percent last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
