Santos Ltd. (STO) ,  Australia ’s third-
largest oil producer, said the shale gas potential in the Cooper
Basin in the center of the nation is “very large.”  “We’re all conscious of what happened in North America,
where the play opened up quite quickly,” David Knox, chief
executive officer of the Adelaide-based energy company, said
today on a conference call with reporters. “The potential is
very large, but it is absolutely still a potential. We need to
demonstrate that through drilling and scientific work.”  Santos drilled a vertical shale gas well in the Cooper
Basin in December and plans to drill a horizontal well in the
fourth quarter, the company said today in a  presentation . The
company plans to drill four “unconventional” wells in the area
in the second half of this year, according to the document.  “It’s about using technology -- a lot of it that has been
used successfully in  North America  -- to unlock these resources
and drive down costs,” Knox told analysts earlier today after
the company reported a 51 percent gain in full-year profit.  Santos rose 0.1 percent to A$13.56 at the close of trade in
Sydney. The benchmark index rose 0.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
