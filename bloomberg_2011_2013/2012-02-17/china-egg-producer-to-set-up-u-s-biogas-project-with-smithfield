Beijing DQY Agriculture Technology,
a Chinese egg producer, will co-operate with a unit of U.S. meat
supplier  Smithfield Foods Inc. (SFD)  on a bio-fuel joint venture, the
Chinese company said in a statement yesterday.  The biogas project will produce 3.5 million cubic meters of
methane annually and have a power generating capacity of 1
megawatt, according to a statement on DQY’s website, which did
not give an investment amount.  The U.S. and China plan to sign a five-year accord to
cooperate on agriculture trade, production and food security,
expanding ties as population and income growth in Asia boost
demand for everything from pork to cotton.  The agreement with Smithfield, Virginia-based Smithfield
Foods was signed on Feb. 16 at a farm symposium in  Des Moines ,
Iowa, which Chinese Vice President  Xi Jinping  attended,
according to DQY’s statement.  DQY and Smithfield will invest $1.8 billion in the joint
venture,  China ’s Xinhua news Agency reported yesterday. The
project will require an insignificant investment on the part of
Smithfield, Keira Lombardo, a spokeswoman for the company, said
in an e-mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
