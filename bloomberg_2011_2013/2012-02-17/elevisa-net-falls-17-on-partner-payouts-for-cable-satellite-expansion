Grupo Televisa SAB (TLEVICPO) , the world’s
largest Spanish-language broadcaster, said fourth-quarter profit
fell 17 percent as growth in its pay-TV divisions led to bigger
payouts to partners.  Net income declined to 2.17 billion pesos ($169 million)
from 2.62 billion pesos a year earlier, Mexico City-based
Televisa said yesterday in a filing. Sales rose 11 percent to
18.3 billion pesos, beating the 17.9 billion peso average
 estimate  of five analysts polled by Bloomberg.  Televisa is using promotions such as free calls to wireless
phones to recruit more cable customers from  America Movil SAB (AMXL) ,
the phone company controlled by billionaire  Carlos Slim . The
three cable carriers controlled by Televisa added 61,000 TV
subscribers, 92,000  Internet users  and 40,000 voice plans.  Televisa gained 2 percent to 54.2 pesos at the close in
Mexico City.  The shares  have dropped 6.7 percent in the past
12 months.  Even as the company offered promotions to lure customers,
profit margins were little changed in the satellite business
and expanded in the cable unit, helping push operating profit up
16 percent.  The pay-TV growth also cut into net income, since Televisa
has to pay out a portion of its profits to DirecTV, which owns
42 percent of its satellite business, and to Grupo Multimedios,
which owns half of its TVI cable unit.  Higher Payouts  Payouts to such partners rose to 385 million pesos from
94 million pesos a year earlier. A weaker peso and higher
interest payments also hurt net income, pushing financing costs
up 54 percent to 1.08 billion pesos.  Sales in the broadcast division, Televisa’s largest unit,
climbed 5.1 percent from a year earlier. Sales of advance
advertising for 2012 rose 8.9 percent from a year earlier,
Executive Vice President Alfonso de Angoitia said today on a
conference call.  The content business, which includes advertising, cable
network subscriptions and syndication, will expand 6 percent
to 7 percent this year, with an operating profit margin of
47 percent, little changed from 2011, he said.  Televisa’s satellite-TV unit added 184,000 subscribers for
a total of 4 million in 2011. This year, sales will expand at
a rate in the mid-single-digit percentage points, down from
11 percent in 2011, de Angoitia said.  Capital Expenses  Capital expenses will reach $850 million, including
$475 million for the cable unit, $250 million for satellite
and $125 million for programming, he said.  Losses in two companies in which Televisa has stakes, U.S.
broadcaster  Univision Communications Inc. (UVN)  and Spanish TV network
Gestora de Inversiones Audiovisuales La Sexta SA, cut into net
income. Those units combined for 131 million pesos in losses, up
from 23.7 million pesos a year earlier.  Royalties from Univision, which licenses Televisa’s
programming, will climb 8.9 percent to $245 million this year,
de Angoitia said.  Income taxes more than doubled last year to 1.4 billion
pesos as the company’s tax rate increased from 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
