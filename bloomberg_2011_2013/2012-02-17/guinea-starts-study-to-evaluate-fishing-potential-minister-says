Guinea started a study to estimate
fish stocks in its territorial waters, Moussa Conde, the
minister of fisheries and aquaculture, said.  The research will help the West African country decide
whether it can continue issue commercial-fishing licenses, Conde
said on the Conakry-based Radio Television Guineenne yesterday.  Commercial fishing companies caught 24,060 metric tons in
its waters in the 11 months through November, according to the
countryâ€™s  Finance Ministry .  To contact the reporter on this story:
