Four defendants were found guilty at
trial for their part in a mortgage-fraud scheme led by former
 Dallas  Cowboys football player Eugene Lockhart, who pleaded
guilty last year.  William Randolph Tisdale Jr., 46, who together with
Lockhart, 50, ran the scheme, was found guilty of conspiracy to
commit wire fraud and of bank fraud, according to a statement
yesterday from the office of U.S. Attorney Sarah R. Saldana in
Dallas. Three others were also found guilty of conspiracy, and
two of them of fraud.  Ten defendants have been convicted, including six who
pleaded guilty, in a scheme whereby Lockhart and Tisdale set up
real estate ventures with names derived from the National
Football League team, such as Cowboys Realty, and used straw
buyers to obtain inflated loans for distressed and pre-
foreclosure homes in the Dallas area, according to prosecutors.  They got about $20.5 million in fraudulent loans,
prosecutors said. Lockhart faces as long as 10 years prison
under the terms of his plea agreement, prosecutors said. Tisdale
faces as long as 30 years on the bank fraud conviction and 20
years for the conspiracy count, according to the statement.  Phillip Gregory, Tisdale’s lawyer, said in a phone
interview that he will pursue an appeal.  “We’re disappointed in the outcome of the trial,” the
lawyer said. “We disagree with the jury.”  The case is U.S. v. Lockhart, 09-CR-00247, U.S. District
Court, Northern District of  Texas  (Dallas).  To contact the reporter on this story:
