Rains in sugar-cane growing areas of
 Mexico  will benefit the country’s next harvest after reducing
the sugar content in the raw material this season, the National
Union of Sugarcane Growers said.  “The rains that are falling in the sugar-cane producing
states will benefit the cane that will be harvested next year,”
Carlos Blackaller, president of growers’ group, said in a
statement e-mailed yesterday. The sugar content in the cane
being harvested in the current 2011-12 season will decline
because of the rains, he added.  Mexico, the world’s sixth-biggest sugar producer, cut its
official output estimate to 5.1 million metric tons this crop-
year from a previous forecast of 5.3 million tons, industry
committee Conadesuca said on Feb. 10. The country had processed
19.5 million tons of cane by Feb. 11 to make 2.3 million tons of
sugar, according to the industry group.  To contact the reporter on this story:
