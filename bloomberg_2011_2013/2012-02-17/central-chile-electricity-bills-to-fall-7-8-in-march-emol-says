Chileans living in Santiago and the
central part of the country will see electricity bills decline
by an average of 7.8 percent starting next month, El Mercurio
reported in its online edition, Emol.com, citing Energy Minister
Rodrigo Alvarez.  Power bills may decline again in the middle of this year,
the Santiago-based newspaper reported, without giving a reason
for the reduction.  To contact the reporter on this story:
