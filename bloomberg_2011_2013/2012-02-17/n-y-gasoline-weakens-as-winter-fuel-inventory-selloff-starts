New York  gasoline weakened as
inventories of the winter blend of the fuel are sold to make
room in  storage tanks  for summer grade.  The discount for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in  New
York Harbor (MOSNY87P)  widened 1.38 cents to 0.38 cent a gallon versus
futures traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 3:46 p.m.,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt delivery fell
4.52 cents to $3.0119 a gallon.  “There is a lot of winter-grade gasoline in inventory that
has to be liquidated by the middle of April,”  Andy Lipow ,
president of Lipow Oil Associates LLC in Houston, said by phone.  The same fuel in the  Gulf Coast (MOSGC87P)  narrowed its discount 0.38
cent to 2.5 cents a gallon versus futures.  Marathon Petroleum Co. experienced an upset in Unit 15 at
the Garyville refinery in  Louisiana  yesterday that resulted in a
release of sulfur dioxide, according to the state Department of
Environmental Quality.  The upset at the 460,000-barrel-a-day plant began at 6 a.m.
and lasted 45 minutes, Tim Beckstrom, a department spokesman,
said in an e-mail.  Chicago (CHCG87PC)  gasoline strengthened 12.5 cents to a discount of
40.5 cents a gallon. The fuel has rebounded since dropping to
the lowest level since at least 1996 on Feb. 15.  The same fuel in the  Midwest (GRP3G387) , or Group 3, narrowed its
discount 1.63 cents to 12.5 cents a gallon.  To contact the reporter on this story:
