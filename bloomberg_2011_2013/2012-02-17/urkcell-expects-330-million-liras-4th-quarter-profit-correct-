  (Corrects to say 263 million liras estimate for costs at
Belarus unit is no longer valid.)  Turkcell (TCELL)  Group expects consolidated
net income of 330 million liras ($188.1 million) in the fourth
quarter, said Turkcell Iletisim Hizmetleri AS, the countryâ€™s
biggest mobile phone company.  Previous guidance for currency losses of 263 million liras
at Belarus unit BeST is no longer valid, Turkcell said in a
filing with the  Istanbul Stock Exchange  today.  Turkcell shares rose 1.7 percent to 9.76 liras at 5:30 p.m.
on the exchange today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
