Aker Solutions ASA (AKSO) ,  Norway ’s biggest
maker of oil platforms, surged the most in more than two years
in Oslo trading after avoiding further delays to a project in
Brazil and affirming revenue targets until 2015.  The shares rose as much as 17 percent, the most since
November 2008, and were up 13 percent as of 12:55 p.m. local
time, the largest gain in the benchmark OBX index. The stock has
risen 48 percent this year, making it the second-biggest gainer
on the  STOXX 600 Oil & Gas Index .  The company said that a project in Brazil was going
according to plan, after delays in deliveries of subsea systems
to Petroleo Brasileiro SA had cut earnings by 500 million kroner
($67 million) in the third quarter. The company affirmed a
target for sales to grow 9 percent to 15 percent a year until
2015.  “They have had issues in the subsea business in  Brazil  and
now they actually say that operations in Brazil are going
according to their last plan,” said Goeran Andreassen, an
analyst with RS Platou Markets AS. “That’s obviously positive
considering the concern among investors with Aker Solutions
operations in that region. That has been weighing on the share
definitely.”  Net income was 675 million kroner in the fourth quarter,
beating the 346 million-krone estimate of 15 analysts  surveyed 
by Bloomberg. Sales grew 18 percent to 11.6 billion kroner from
a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
