Ireland’s National Asset Management
Agency said its first fund to allow investment in real estate in
the country and the U.K. will probably have less than 500
million euros ($657 million) of assets under management,
according to a  filing  by NAMA.  Office, retail and other properties may be included in the
fund, NAMA said on Irish government’s procurement website in
response to questions from potential advisers. The fund would
acquire properties that are under receivership, David Clerkin, a
NAMA spokesman, said in January.  The funds, known as Qualifying Investor Funds, would be
subject to Irish law. NAMA, based in Dublin, is seeking
investment-management services to help operate the funds,
according to documents posted on the agency’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
