New York  City has been designated to
receive $151.6 million this year from the U.S. Homeland Security
Department, permitting expansion of anti-terrorism surveillance
in lower  Manhattan  and Times Square.  New York’s funding remained stable as most of the U.S.
received 42 percent less aid, after federal officials agreed to
earmark at least $100 million for areas considered at most risk,
U.S. Senators Charles Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand of New York
said today in a statement.  Mayor Michael Bloomberg had counted on the funding in a
$68.7 billion preliminary budget he presented to the City
Council earlier this month. The 34,000-officer police department
operates on a $4.9 billion  annual budget .  “It’s a sound and sober decision and reflects the fact
that  New York City  remains the number one target for
terrorists,” Schumer said.  In addition to building out a surveillance system near  Wall
Street  and in midtown Manhattan, the money will pay for
explosive detection equipment and for some of the 2,000
officers, including about a dozen overseas, assigned to counter-
terrorism, Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly said in a
 statement .  At least 14 terrorist plots have been exposed since the
World Trade Center was attacked on Sept. 11, 2001, Kelly has
said.  The mayor is founder and majority owner of Bloomberg News
parent Bloomberg LP.  To contact the reporters on this story:
