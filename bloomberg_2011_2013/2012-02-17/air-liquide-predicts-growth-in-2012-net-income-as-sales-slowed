Air Liquide SA (AI) , the world’s biggest
producer of industrial gases, forecast higher profit this year

billion), the Paris-based company said today in a statement. The
average  estimate  in a Bloomberg survey of analysts was 1.53
billion euros. Like-for-like sales of gas and services rose 7.5
percent, slowing to a pace of 1.9 percent in the fourth quarter,

2012,” Chief Executive Officer Benoit Potier said in the
statement. For 2011, he had predicted “steady growth” in net
