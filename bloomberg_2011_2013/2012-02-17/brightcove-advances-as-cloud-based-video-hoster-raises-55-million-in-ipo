Brightcove Inc. (BCOV) , a provider of
cloud-based video hosting and publishing services, advanced 30
percent in its trading debut after raising $55 million in its
initial public offering.  The stock rose to $14.30 at the close in New York, after
listing on the Nasdaq Stock Market under the symbol BCOV.  Brightcove, based in Cambridge,  Massachusetts , is the
latest technology company to tap the public equity market.  Zynga
Inc. (ZNGA) , the biggest developer of games for Facebook Inc., listed
in December and has risen 29 percent since then. Facebook, based
in  Menlo Park ,  California ,  filed  its public offering Feb. 1 and
seeks to raise $5 billion.  Brightcove  sold  5 million shares at $11 apiece yesterday,
the midpoint of its $10 to $12 proposed range, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  The company, led by Chief Executive Officer Jeremy Allaire,
increased revenue 45 percent to $63.6 million in 2011 from a
year earlier. Brightcove, founded in 2004, has been unprofitable
since at least 2007, a regulatory  filing  shows.  The company said it plans to use proceeds for working
capital and other general corporate purposes.  Morgan Stanley and Stifel Nicolaus Weisel led the deal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
