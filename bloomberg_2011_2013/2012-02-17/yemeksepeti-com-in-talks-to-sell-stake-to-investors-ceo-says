Yemeksepeti.com , an Istanbul-based
company offering web-based meal order services, is in talks with
private equity and venture capital firms to sell a stake of 10
to 15 percent, chief executive officer Nevzat Aydin said.  Three major shareholders including Aydin, who is also the
co-founder of the company, own 70 percent of the company,  Aydin
said in a telephone interview yesterday.  A decision on whether to sell the stake or not will be made
by the end of March, Aydin said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
