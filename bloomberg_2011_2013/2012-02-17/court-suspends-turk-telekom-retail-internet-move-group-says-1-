Turkey ’s top administrative court
ruled that  Turk Telekomunikasyon AS (TTKOM)  can’t market retail Internet
services in addition to wholesale, upholding an earlier verdict
by the country’s antitrust board.  The court suspended the telecommunications regulator’s
decision allowing Turk Telekom to participate in the retail
market, the industry association Telkoder, which filed the case,
said in an e-mailed statement today, citing the top court’s
decision.  Turk Telekom rose 0.5 percent to 7.44 liras at the 5:30
p.m. close in Istanbul. The main share index rose 1.8 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
