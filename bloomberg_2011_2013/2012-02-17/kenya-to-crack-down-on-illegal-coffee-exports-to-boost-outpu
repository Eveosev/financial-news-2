Kenya ’s coffee board plans to crack
down on illegal exports of the beans to boost official
production to 51,000 metric tons of the crop this year, Managing
Director Loise Wanjira Njeru said.  Last year, output was recorded at 36,629 tons in the 12
months through September when the actual figure may have been
about 50,000 tons, Njeru said in an interview in  Ethiopia ’s
capital,  Addis Ababa , yesterday.  “The biggest next agenda is going to be how we track the
coffee moving out,” she said. “We believe that the unofficial
channels would account for the balance.”  Kenya earned $221.7 million from the crop last year,
compared with $171.3 million a year earlier, according to the
Kenya Coffee Producers and Traders Association. Output may reach
70,000 tons within the five years as a debt-write off for
farmers and investment in inputs such as fertilizers boost
productivity, Njeru said. Yields should be at least 5 kilograms
(11 pounds) per tree instead of the current 2 kilograms,
according to Njeru.  “If we have 50 percent of farmers at 5 kilograms we would
still be able to make the 70,000 tons” target, she said.
“Productivity is our biggest undoing.”  Kenya also plans to grow coffee in new areas after
plantations were lost to real-estate development, said Njeru.
“We will shift to the west of the Rift Valley where we still
have huge tracts of land suitable for coffee growing,” she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
