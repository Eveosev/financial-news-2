Brazil ’s Finance Ministry denied a
report that the government is considering a tax on foreign
direct investment to stem the appreciation of the real.  Veja magazine reported in this week’s edition that the
government is studying the implementation of a tax on all
capital inflows as a means of curbing currency gains.  There are no studies at the moment to tax FDI, Finance
Minister  Guido Mantega  said, according to a statement read by a
press officer over the phone. Mantega also said that the
measures taken so far to stem the currency gains were
successful, said the press officer, who can’t be identified
because of internal policy.  The government continues to monitor the  currency market 
closely and is ready to take new measures to guarantee a
competitive exchange rate, Mantega said, according to the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
