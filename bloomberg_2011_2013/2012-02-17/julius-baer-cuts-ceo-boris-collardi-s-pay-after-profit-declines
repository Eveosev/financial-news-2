Julius Baer Group Ltd. (BAER)  cut Chief
Executive Officer  Boris Collardi ’s pay by 29 percent last year
after the Swiss wealth manager reported a decline in profit.  Collardi, 37, earned 5.7 million Swiss francs ($6.2
million) in 2011, compared with 7.9 million francs the previous
year, according to the Zurich-based firm’s  annual report 
published today. His cash bonus was cut by a third to 2 million
francs while deferred share payments were reduced by the same
amount to 1.33 million francs.  Collardi also voluntarily reduced his base salary by 10
percent for the 10-month period through June 2012, according to
the annual report. That salary totaled 943,467 francs last year.  Julius Baer, founded in 1890, reported a 27 percent drop in
2011 profit and lowered its medium-term target for pretax
profit, citing a “changed market environment” and the strength
of the Swiss currency. UBS AG and Credit Suisse Group AG,
 Switzerland ’s biggest banks, cut bonus pools last week by 40
percent and 41 percent respectively as lenders worldwide curb
pay to address shrinking revenue.  Julius Baer  has  climbed  2.1 percent this year in Zurich
trading after declining 16 percent in 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
