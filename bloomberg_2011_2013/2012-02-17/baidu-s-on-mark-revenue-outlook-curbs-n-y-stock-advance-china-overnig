Baidu Inc. (BIDU)  dropped the most in two
months, leading a decline in U.S.-traded Chinese stocks, on
concern the nation’s largest online search engine will see a
drop in advertising revenue as the economy slows.  Baidu slid 3.5 percent on Feb. 17, the biggest retreat
since Dec. 21, after forecasting a slowdown in first-quarter
sales.  Sina Corp. (SINA) , provider of a Twitter-like service in  China ,
and social network website owner  Renren Inc. (RENN)  also slipped,
eroding the  Bloomberg China-US 55 Index’s (CH55BN)  3.6 percent advance
this week.  Presiding over a search engine with about 311,000
advertisers, Baidu expects  sales  to rise 75 percent this quarter
from a year earlier, after 82 percent growth in the last three
months of 2011, according to a Feb. 16 statement. Economic
growth in China eased last quarter to the least since 2009 as
 Europe ’s debt crisis and a sluggish U.S. recovery curbed demand
for goods from the world’s largest exporter.  “Even though Baidu has had impressive historical growth
rates, it will be challenging for Baidu to continue to grow at
the same high pace relying on their current strategy,” said
Kevin Pollack, a  fund manager  at Paragon Capital LP in  New York 
on Feb. 17. “There is pervasive fear of an ad slowdown,
especially if China experiences lower growth, which could
significantly reduce business from Baidu’s primary customers.”  The Bloomberg China-US 55, an index of the most-traded
Chinese stocks in the U.S., dropped 0.2 percent to 108.85 on
Feb. 17 in New York, while preserving its biggest five-day
advance in 11 weeks. The  iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund , the
biggest Chinese exchange-traded fund in the U.S., slipped 0.1
percent to $40.26, trimming its gain last week to 3.4 percent,
the biggest weekly increase in four.  ‘Not Keeping Up’  Beijing-based Baidu’s American depositary receipts closed
at a one-week low of $136.90. Analysts at Susquehanna Financial
Group and Bocom International Holdings Co. cut 12-month  price
targets  for the stock on Feb. 17, after the company reported
fourth-quarter results the previous day.  The rate of growth for Baidu’s net income will slow to 52
percent this year from 88 percent in 2011, according to the
average forecast of 19 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Revenue growth “is not keeping up with the size of the
organization,” said  Tim Hartzell , chief investment officer at
Houston-based Sequent Asset Management. “They should acquire or
keep exploring what else they can market.”  Facebook Inc. (FB) ’s initial public offering plans are going to
pull capital from a lot of technology stocks, Hartzell said.
Facebook filed for a share offer on Feb. 1, and people familiar
with the matter have said the company is considering a sale that
would value it at $75 billion to $100 billion.  21Vianet Group  Shanghai-based Sina slid 1.4 percent to $67.74 in New York,
trimming a 4 percent weekly gain, while Renren, based in
Beijing, slipped 1.5 percent to $5.43, up 4.4 percent last week.
 21Vianet Group Inc (VNET) ., China’s largest independent data-center
services provider, sank 4.6 percent to $10.91, extending its
drop in the week to 8.9 percent.  The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  rose 0.2 percent to
1,361.23 on Feb. 17, approaching a three-year high of 1,363.61
set in April. The gauge added 1.4 percent last week. The
 Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  was little changed on Feb. 17 at
2,357.18, completing the week with a 0.2 percent advance.  Suntech Power Holdings Co. (STP) , the world’s largest solar-panel
marker, climbed 8.3 percent to $3.65 on Feb. 17, the most in a
week, after raising its forecast for fourth-quarter sales. The
stock was down 9.4 percent in the week.  No ‘Hard Landing’  The company, based in China’s eastern Jiangsu province,
said in a statement on Feb. 17 that shipments in the last three
months of 2011 probably declined about 10 percent from the third
quarter, compared with a previous estimate for a 20 percent
drop.  China is encouraging more consumption and greater output by
businesses, Vice President  Xi Jinping  said on a trade visit to
 Los Angeles  on Feb. 17. “There will not be a so-called  hard
landing ” for the country’s economy, he said.  Ctrip.com International Ltd. (CTRP) , the biggest online travel
agency in China, will report fourth-quarter figures today. Sales
rose 24.6 percent for the quarter from a year ago to $148.6
million, according to the average estimate of nine analysts.
That compares with a 26 percent increase in the third quarter.
Net income dropped 8 percent from a year earlier to $42.1
million, the analysts predict.  Ctrip ADRs slipped 1 percent to $24.69, down 1 percent in
the week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
