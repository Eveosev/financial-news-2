U.S. Senator  Scott Brown , a
Republican elected to the seat long held by the late  Ted Kennedy , leads challenger  Elizabeth Warren , 49 percent to 40
percent among likely voters, a Suffolk University survey shows.  Independents backed Brown 60 percent to 28 percent,
according to the poll released late yesterday by the Boston
school. Brown, 52, was viewed favorably by 52 percent of those
polled, while 35 percent held that view of Warren, 62, a Harvard
Law School professor and former White House adviser.  The poll, produced with WHDH-TV in Boston, showed that 60
percent of voters favor having a Republican representing
Massachusetts in the Senate alongside Democrat  John Kerry . Among
independents, who comprise a majority of voters in the state, 64
percent agreed that there was a benefit in having one senator
from each major party.  The contest has drawn national attention as a focal point
for the battle to control the Senate, where Democrats hold a
slim majority. Brown won the seat in January 2010, beating state
Attorney General  Martha Coakley , a Democrat, by 5 percentage
points to fill out the remaining months of Kennedy’s last term.
He died in 2009. Warren, who faces a Democratic primary, left
the White House last year after helping President Barack Obama
set up the federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.  The telephone survey of 600 registered voters from Feb. 11-
15 had a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
