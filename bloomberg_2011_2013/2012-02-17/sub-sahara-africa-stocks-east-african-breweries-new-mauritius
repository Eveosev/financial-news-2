 Diageo Plc (DGE) , advanced 1.7 percent to 179 shillings, the highest
since Jan. 12, after the nation’s biggest company by market
value said first-half profit grew 17 percent as revenue jumped
on an increase in spirits’ sales.  New Mauritius Hotels Ltd. (NMH)  , the country’s biggest
leisure operator by market value, dropped for a second day,
falling 2 percent to 74.5 rupees, the lowest since Dec. 5, on
bets of a weaker tourism season.  “Tourism arrivals in January dropped 3 percent, a second
month of decline, which is a cause of concern for the industry
right now,” Kishen Nadassen, senior research analyst at CIM
Stockbrokers Ltd., said in a phone interview from Port Louis.
“Expectations are negative” for the season starting April and
continuing until September, Nadassen said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
