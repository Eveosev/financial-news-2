British Prime Minister  David Cameron 
said his intervention wouldn’t help French President  Nicolas Sarkozy ’s re-election campaign.  “I want to take this chance to wish him well in his
battles ahead,” Cameron said at a joint press conference in
Paris today after the two met. “But I’m not sure that if I took
part in his campaign it would have the effect my friend here
wants.”  German  Chancellor Angela Merkel  has said she’ll attend some
Sarkozy election rallies. The French president didn’t say if he
wants Cameron to do the same.  “The support from David Cameron gives me pleasure,”
Sarkozy said. “In this period, it doesn’t bother me for people
to say good things about me rather than bad.”  Sarkozy announced Feb. 15 that he’s running for a second
term. He trails his Socialist challenger  Francois Hollande  in
the polls ahead of the first round of elections on April 22. As
the top two vote getters, Sarkozy and Hollande are expected to
face off in the deciding round May 6.  Relations between Britain and France have been strained in
recent months by Cameron’s refusal in December to back a
European Union accord to strengthen the euro and by Sarkozy’s
push for an EU-wide financial-transaction tax.  To contact the reporter on this story:
