Kaufman Bros. LP, the minority-owned
investment bank that helped unwind U.S. stakes in bailed-out
financial companies, filed to liquidate in  New York .  The company listed both assets and debt of less than $10
million each in Chapter 7 documents filed today in  U.S.
Bankruptcy Court  in Manhattan. Chapter 7 proceedings let
companies liquidate their assets while being protected from
creditors.  Kaufman was founded in 1995 and billed itself as “the
country’s largest minority-owned and operated investment banking
and advisory firm” focused on technology, media,
telecommunications, green technology and health care. The firm
said in June that it helped advisory clients raise more than $50
billion since 1999.  The company shuttered operations Jan. 30. Kaufman had
assets of $3.26 million and partners’ capital of $1.21 million
as of Dec. 31, 2010, according to documents filed with
regulators.  Kaufman’s  website , before it was disabled, said the firm
participated in public offerings of  Citigroup Inc. (C)  and  American
International Group Inc. (AIG)  as the U.S. Treasury Department
disposed of stakes accumulated when it bailed out the firms
during the financial crisis.  The case is In re Kaufman Bros LP, 12-10664, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
