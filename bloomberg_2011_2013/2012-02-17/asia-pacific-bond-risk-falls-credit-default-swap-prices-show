The cost of insuring Asia-Pacific
corporate and sovereign bonds from default fell, according to
traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index dropped 9 basis points to
146 basis points as of 12:17 p.m. in Sydney, according to Credit
Agricole CIB. That’s set for the biggest daily decrease since
Nov. 30, prices from data provider CMA show.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  decreased 7 basis points to 164 as of
9:17 a.m. in  Hong Kong , Credit Agricole prices show. The gauge
is on course for its biggest fall since Jan. 26, according to
CMA, which is owned by CME Group Inc. and compiles prices quoted
by dealers in the privately negotiated market  The Markit iTraxx Japan index fell 8 basis points to 145.5
basis points as of 10:16 a.m. in  Tokyo , Citigroup Inc. prices
show. That’s set for its biggest daily decline since Feb. 8,
according to CMA.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
credit quality. A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
