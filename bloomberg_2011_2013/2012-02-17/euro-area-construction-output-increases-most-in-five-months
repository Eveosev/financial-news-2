European  construction output 
advanced the most in five months in December as a rebound in
 Spain  helped offset declines from Germany to  Portugal .  Construction (EUCPTSAM)  in the 17-nation euro region rose 0.3 percent
from November, when it gained a revised 0.2 percent, the
European Union’s  statistics office  in Luxembourg said today.
That is the biggest advance since July. From a year earlier,
 output  increased 7.8 percent.  In Germany, Europe’s largest economy, construction dropped
6.4 percent in December from the previous month, when it rose
3.3 percent, today’s report showed. France reported a decrease
of 2.2 percent, while Portugal saw a drop of 0.2 percent. In
Spain, output advanced 1.1 percent from November, when it
decreased 0.5 percent.  The statistics office had previously reported a monthly
gain of 0.8 percent in November. It didn’t provide December data
for nations including  Greece , Ireland, Italy and Austria.  The euro was little changed against the dollar after the
data, trading at $1.3159 at 10:08 a.m. in  London , up 0.2 percent
on the day.  In the 27-nation EU, construction output decreased 0.4
percent in December, according to the statistics office.  To contact the reporter on this story:
