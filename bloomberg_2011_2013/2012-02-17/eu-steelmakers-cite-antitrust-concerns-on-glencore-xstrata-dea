European steelmakers group Eurofer
said it is concerned Glencore International Plc’s takeover of
 Xstrata Plc (XTA)  may harm competition in the zinc, nickel and coal
markets.  Eurofer will gather data before deciding whether to file an
antitrust complaint with the European Commission over the
“competition implications of the merger,” Axel Eggert,
Eurofer’s public affairs director in Brussels, said in an e-mail
today.  Glencore, the world’s largest publicly traded commodities
supplier, agreed last week to buy Xstrata. The world’s biggest
mining deal may win antitrust approval because the EU  said in
2006  that Glencore’s 34 percent stake in Xstrata means they are
already a single group, according to analysts at Numis Corp.
“Our concerns are with regard to the potential impact on the
markets for zinc, nickel and coal,” Eggert said today on behalf
of the group, which has members including the world’s largest
steelmaker,  ArcelorMittal (MT) , and  Germany ’s largest steel producer
ThyssenKrupp AG.  Xstrata is “confident” that combining with Glencore
“will not result in any negative impact on competition in the
commodity markets” the company said in an e-mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
