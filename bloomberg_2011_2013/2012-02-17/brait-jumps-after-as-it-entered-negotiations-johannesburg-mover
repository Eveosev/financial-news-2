Brait SA (BAT) ,  South Africa ’s largest
private equity company, climbed the most in 11 months after the
 investment company  said it is in talks that may affect its
shares, without providing more details.  The stock rose as much as 5.1 percent to 21.80 rand, the
biggest jump since March 9, and closed 3.4 percent higher at
21.45 in Johannesburg.  Brait said Jan. 19 that it has 1.7 billion rand ($219
million) “available for new investments,” according to a
regulatory filing.  “They have some funds and may be looking to make an
acquisition in a new stock or take up a bigger stake in one of
their existing investments,” Jean Pierre Verster, an analyst
with 36ONE Asset Management Pty Ltd. in Johannesburg, said by
phone. Brait Chief Executive Officer John Gnodde declined to
comment.  Christo Wiese, chairman of Pepkor, one of Brait’s largest
investments, owns 33 percent of the South African private equity
firm. The investment management team at Brait owns 18 percent of
the company, acccording to Brait.  “With Christo Wiese and management being anchor
shareholders, I would be surprised if it is a takeover of
Brait,” Verster said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
