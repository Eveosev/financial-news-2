Komercni Banka AS (KOMB) , the Czech unit of
Societe Generale SA that last year took impairment charges on
its holdings of Greek government bonds, snapped a three-day rout
amid speculation Greece will secure a bailout.  The stock jumped as much as 3.1 percent and traded up 2
percent to 3,661.5 koruna by 9:47 a.m. in Prague. The Czech
Republicâ€™s  PX (PX)  gauge of companies, where Komercni Banka has a 17
percent weighting, advanced 1.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
