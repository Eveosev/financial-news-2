Asian  stocks  rose, with the regional
benchmark index set to match its longest streak of weekly
advances, after U.S. economic reports beat estimates and
optimism increased that  Greece  will get a second debt bailout,
boosting demand for riskier assets.  Honda Motor Co. (7267) , the carmaker that generates 44 percent of
its revenue in  North America , rose 2.4 percent in  Tokyo .
 Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. (8306) , Japan’s biggest lender, led
financial companies higher.  Billabong International Ltd. (BBG) , a
global surfwear maker, surged 46 percent in Sydney after
confirming a takeover approach.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index gained 1.1 percent to 127.23 as
of 8:02 p.m. in Tokyo. The measure has advanced 1.9 percent this
week, extending its winning streak to the longest since December
2005. The gauge has advanced nine consecutive weeks only three
times since 1988.  “It’s a distinct improvement from the fourth quarter last
year from the perspective of investor confidence and risk
appetite,” said Prasad Patkar, who helps manage about $1
billion at Platypus Asset Management Ltd. in Sydney. “When
there’s a bit of relief from the European front, the markets can
focus on fundamentals, which seem to be improving by the day.”  U.S. Data  Japan ’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average  rose 1.6 percent, its
biggest weekly gain since the period ended Dec. 2, as the yen
fell against all of its 16 major counterparts. The currency
declined to a four-month low after the Bank of Japan surprised
the market on Feb. 14 by expanding its government bond
purchases. A weaker yen boosts the overseas earnings of Japanese
companies.  Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 added 0.3 percent, and South
Korea’s Kospi Index advanced 1.3 percent.  Hong Kong ’s Hang Seng
Index gained 1 percent, while the Shanghai Composite Index was
little changed after swinging between gains and losses.  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  were little
changed today. The gauge advanced 1.1 percent in  New York 
yesterday after reports showed Americans filed the fewest claims
for jobless benefits since March 2008 and builders broke ground
on more houses than expected.  Manufacturing (OUTFGAF)  in the Philadelphia
region expanded this month at the fastest pace in four months as
orders and sales rose.  Exporters to the U.S. advanced. Honda gained 2.4 percent to
2,950 yen.  James Hardie Industries SE (JHX) , a building-materials
supplier that gets 68 percent of sales from the U.S., rose 2.3
percent to A$7.26 in Sydney.  Techtronic Industries Co. (669) , a power-
tool maker that counts North America as its largest market,
added 3.1 percent to HK$10.10 in Hong Kong.  Banks Rise  Financial companies contributed the most to gains in the
MSCI Asia Pacific Index amid optimism  Europe ’s debt crisis won’t
throw the global financial system into disarray.  Euro-area officials said the  European Central Bank  is
swapping its Greek bonds for new securities to protect from
losses in a debt restructuring. European governments are
considering cutting  interest rates  on emergency loans to Greece
and using contributions from the ECB to plug a new financing gap
in the second bailout for Athens, two people familiar with the
discussions said.  “The sense of worry is weakening slightly in markets
across the board,” said Hisakazu Amano, who helps oversee the
equivalent of $29 billion at T&D Asset Management Co. in Tokyo.
“Expectations for a U.S. economic recovery are increasing and
the uncertainties on the European debt issues are subsiding.”  TPG Eyes Billabong  Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group advanced 1.3 percent to 406
yen.  Nomura Holdings Inc. (8604) , Japan’s biggest brokerage by market
value, rose 3.3 percent to 345 yen.  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) , Europe’s
No. 1 lender, climbed 1.7 percent to HK$70.50.  Billabong International jumped 46 percent to A$2.62 after
it received a takeover approach from buyout firm TPG Capital
valuing the company at A$765 million ($824 million). The
interest comes less than two months after the apparel maker
started a review of its capital structure amid a slump in
earnings and looming debt payments.  The  Asia Pacific index  gained 11 percent this year through
yesterday, compared with an 8 percent advance by the  S&P 500  and
an 8.1 percent increase by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Stocks in
the Asian benchmark are valued at 14.4 times estimated earnings
on average, compared with 13 times for the S&P 500 and 10.9
times for the Stoxx 600.  Of 467 companies listed in the Asia Pacific index that have
reported net income since Jan. 9, 256 missed analysts’ estimates
while 126 beat them, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Bridgestone Corp (5108) , the world’s biggest tiremaker by market
value, jumped 4 percent to 1,833 yen after saying it expects net
income to surge 63 percent to 168 billion yen ($2.1 billion)
this year on growing sales. The Japanese tire company also said
it will spend about 4.7 billion yen to boost production
capacity.  To contact the reporter on this story:
