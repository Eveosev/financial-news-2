Duratex SA (DTEX3) ’s adjusted net income
fell 34 percent in the fourth quarter from the same period last
year, missing analysts’ estimates.  Sao Paulo-based Duratex, a maker of wood panels and
bathroom fixtures, reported adjusted net income of 79.4 million
reais ($46.3 million) in the fourth quarter, compared with 119.6
million reais in the same period a year earlier, according to a
regulatory filing. The company was expected to post an adjusted
net profit of 80.47 million reais, according to the median
estimate of six analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  The company said yesterday it plans to buy back as many as
20.89 million voting shares, or less than 10 percent of the
shares of that class that are traded on the market, according to
a regulatory filing. Duratex said the program is valid from Feb.
24, 2012 until Feb. 22, 2013, according to the filing.  -- Editor: Adriana Brasileiro  To contact the reporter on this story:
