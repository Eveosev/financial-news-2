Novartis AG (NOVN)  said it will add a
warning to the label for its blood-pressure drug Rasilez in
 Europe  to comply with a request from regulators.  Novartis is changing the product information for Rasilez,
sold in the U.S. as Tekturna, to say that the drug should not be
used to treat patients with diabetes or kidney problems who are
taking certain other medicines, the Basel, Switzerland-based
company said in a statement today.  The drugmaker is also complying with a recommendation of
the European Medicines Agency that the label include a warning
against combining products containing aliskiren, the active
ingredient in Rasilez, with heart drugs known as ACE inhibitors
or ARBs, the agency said today in an e-mailed statement.
Novartis halted a trial of the drug in December after it was
linked to increased risk of stroke and kidney problems.  Novartis said in January it expects that Tekturna sales in
2012 will be less than half of last year’s $557 million. The
company booked a fourth-quarter charge of $900 million related
to the lower forecast.  The company said today it has written to doctors worldwide
recommending that patients with type 2 diabetes not be treated
with products containing aliskiren if they’re also receiving an
ACE inhibitor or ARB.  Novartis is in continuing discussions with the U.S.  Food
and Drug Administration  over the use of the products, it said in
the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
