The Obama administration said it
won't defend laws that prohibit U.S. military service members
from obtaining benefits for their same-sex spouses.  Attorney General Eric Holder announced the decision today
in a letter to House Speaker  John Boehner , an Ohio Republican.  The  Justice Department  last year said it would no longer
defend the government against challenges to the Defense of
Marriage Act, which prohibits the federal government from
recognizing same-sex marriages for purposes of taxes, social
security and other programs.  The Justice Department is taking the same position on other
statutory provisions that “may affect the eligibility of same-
sex couples for military and veterans’ benefits,” Holder said
today in his letter.  Holder said the department’s position applies to challenges
under the Fifth Amendment’s equal protection guarantee.  To contact the reporter on this story:
