Gene-sequencing breakthroughs,
spawning a fast-growing, multibillion-dollar market for drugs
and medical tests, are also creating thorny questions over how
to regulate commercial use of the human genetic code.  Health regulators are fashioning rules for bolstering
oversight of laboratory-developed tests, including genetic
analysis, that may show whether an individual is predisposed to
certain diseases. Congress is determining whether patents on
genetic material should be treated differently from other
intellectual property.  The agencies, along with the U.S.  Supreme Court  in cases on
genetic patents, are reviewing laws and policies enabling the
use of genetic data to tailor treatment for each patient. The
changing landscape affects companies including  Quest Diagnostics
Inc. (DGX) ,  Roche Holding AG  and  Pfizer Inc. (PFE) , the world’s biggest
drugmaker.  “The industry is optimistic about the promise of the
technology but concerned about challenges on the regulatory and
legal fronts,” said Edward Reines, a patent attorney at Weil
Gotshal & Manges LLP in Redwood Shores,  California .  Genetic tests can indicate a patient’s susceptibility to
conditions including breast and ovarian cancer, cystic fibrosis,
Huntington’s disease or hemophilia -- and the most promising
treatment. The tests alone account for as much as $6 billion in
annual sales worldwide that may climb 15 percent a year,
estimates Ross Muken, an analyst covering life sciences for
Deutsche Bank Securities Inc.  Matching Patients, Products  The use of pairing drugs with diagnostics to help match
patients with products rose almost six-fold from 2006 to 2011,
according to the  Personalized Medicine Coalition , a Washington-
based nonprofit focused on educating the public and policy
makers on medicine tailored to individuals.  The drugs involved include Pfizer’s Xalkori for a rare form
of  lung cancer  and Basel, Switzerland-based Roche Holding’s
Zelboraf for a life-threatening form of skin cancer. Both are
accompanied by tests approved by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration to detect gene mutations.  The Supreme Court may say on Feb. 21 whether it will hear
two cases capable of changing the landscape for biotechnology
companies. In the first,  New Brunswick , New Jersey-based  Johnson
& Johnson (JNJ)  is asking the court to overturn a ruling that patent
owners must clearly describe what they said they have invented
in all patents. The second seeks a review of an appeals court
decision upholding the patentability of DNA sequences isolated
by  Myriad Genetics Inc. (MYGN)   Cancer Risk  In the case involving Salt Lake City-based Myriad, the
owner of a test for the hereditary risk of breast and ovarian
cancer contends that researchers created a new compound eligible
for patent protection by extracting the specific sequence from
the long strand of DNA.  Opponents including Ellen Matloff, director of the  Yale
Cancer Genetic Counseling Program , say Myriad simply identified
material that exists in nature.  “We’re all born with these genes,” said Matloff, a
plaintiff in the Myriad case. “They didn’t create them. They
don’t deserve a patent.”  Patents on individual DNA molecules including Myriad’s are
becoming “increasingly irrelevant” because the latest
platforms sequence genes en masse to avoid the need to isolate a
particular DNA molecule -- and potentially infringe a patent,
said James Evans, a professor of  genetics and medicine  at the
University of  North Carolina  at  Chapel Hill .  ‘A Disaster’  Evans said he’s more concerned about claims to patent a
mental process, such as finding an association between genes and
disease risk. The high court is considering the types of
diagnostics tests eligible for legal protection.  “What I think would be a disaster would be if the courts
were overly permissive,” Evans said. Some patents are
“abstract mental processes, and as such not patentable.”  The  U.S. Patent and Trademark Office  is conducting a
Congress-mandated study related to genetic testing and whether
special provisions should be created to ensure access to second
opinions on tests covered by patents. The first of two hearings
was held yesterday, and a report is due in June.  “These are really intense and difficult questions,” said
Brenda Jarrell, a patent lawyer with Choate, Hall & Stewart in
 Boston  who specializes in biotechnology. “It’s clearly good to
have incentives for companies, institutes or anyone to learn
more about the genetic basis of disease and treatments.”  Patent Options  The patent office probably will consider three options:
setting more stringent requirements to obtain diagnostic
patents, subjecting such patents to shorter terms than normal
patents, or requiring patent owners to license their technology
to competing labs, Jarrell said.  Patents aren’t the stumbling block to availability, said
Hans Sauer, associate general counsel for the Washington-based
 Biotechnology Industry Organization , said at the hearing.  “One has to strain quite hard to trace existing problems
with patient access and utilization of genetic tests back to
patents,” said Sauer, who called insurance issues the greatest
hindrance.  The patent agency’s historical position that no special
rules exist for individual technologies conflicts with social
and public policy issues surrounding health care, said  Antigone
Peyton , a patent lawyer with Cloudigy Law PLLC, of Alexandria,
Virginia.  “There’s this intensely personal aspect that you have with
diagnostic tests that you don’t have with something like the
iPhone,” said Peyton, who co-authored a study on how patents
affect access to genetic tests. “There are certain diagnostic
patents that have been used to impede the kind of progress we
could achieve. But that’s the price we pay by giving rewards to
those who innovate.”  FDA Plan  Another source of concern for parts of the genetic medicine
field is an FDA plan to oversee lab-developed tests. The policy
covers genetic analysis and may affect as many as 30,000
laboratories, according to David Mongillo, former vice president
for policy and medical affairs at the Washington-based American
Clinical Laboratory Association.  The new, still-unspecified regulatory protocol would apply
to tests made by large companies, such as Madison, New Jersey-
based Quest and Burlington, North Carolina-based  Laboratory
Corp. of America Holdings , as well as diagnostics from smaller
individual labs.  Regulation Concern  The lab industry says it’s already sufficiently regulated
by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services under the
Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments. Mongillo is
concerned that FDA oversight will slow innovation.  “This whole area of genetic and molecular medicine is
advancing so rapidly,” Mongillo said. “What these labs can do
is rapidly incorporate that new information into the laboratory-
developed tests and improve it or better target a patient.” FDA
approval still takes time “and the patient suffers,” he said.  It’s bad tests that are causing patients to suffer, said
 Jeffrey Shuren , director of FDA’s medical device review center.  “We’ve seen plenty of lab-developed tests that are
inaccurate,” Shuren told the House Energy and Commerce health
subcommittee on Feb. 15.  Some labs copy other companies’ FDA-approved tests, he
said, and “who knows if they’re actually any good? You may have
tests that are directing patients to get drugs that they
shouldn’t, or not get drugs that they should, and that’s a
disaster.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
