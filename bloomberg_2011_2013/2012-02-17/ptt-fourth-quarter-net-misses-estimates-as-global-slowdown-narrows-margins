PTT Pcl (PTT) , Thailand’s biggest
company, posted fourth-quarter profit that missed analyst
estimates as the weakening global economy narrowed profit
margins on sales of oil and gas.  Net income  fell 26 percent to 16.6 billion baht ($539
million), or 5.83 baht a share, from 22.5 billion baht, or 7.90
baht, a year earlier, Bangkok-based PTT said in a regulatory
filing. That compared with the 18.1 billion-baht average
estimate of nine analysts  surveyed  by Bloomberg.  PTT will spend 720 billion baht over five years to develop
gas pipelines and oil and gas fields in Thailand and overseas,
Chief Executive Officer Pailin Chuchottaworn said today. The
state-run company plans to supply 50 percent of the nation’s
energy needs by 2020, up from about 18 percent, he said.  “This year we have to work very hard to be able to achieve
performance at the same level as last year due to lots of
volatility and high energy costs,” Chief Financial Officer
Tevin Vongvanich said at a media briefing.  The company plans to raise oil and gas output to 900,000
barrels of oil equivalent per day by 2020.  PTT said sales jumped 21 percent to 595.4 billion baht in
the quarter ended December on higher  oil prices  and sales
volume. The share of income from its investments and affiliates
dropped 56 percent to 3.34 billion baht, mainly due to narrower
refining margins and lower petrochemical prices, it said.  Full-year profit rose 25 percent to a record 105.3 billion
baht as revenue surged 28 percent to 2.43 trillion baht. PTT’s
units and investments contributed 29.4 billion baht, a 57
percent increase from a year earlier.  Bond Sales  PTT will pay an interim dividend of 7 baht a share,
bringing the total dividend for 2011 to 13 baht, Tevin said. The
company will sell 15 billion baht of baht-denominated bonds in
May and will raise a further 10 billion baht through loans or by
selling  debt  in the third quarter, he said.  “Net income this year should beat last year’s level as oil
prices remain high and the growing economy should boost energy
demand,” Sutthichai Kumworachai, an analyst at Kim Eng
Securities  Thailand  Pcl, said by phone today.  PTT Exploration & Production Pcl, Thailand’s biggest energy
explorer, reported an unexpected 2.1 percent gain in full-year
profit on Jan. 31 because of higher product prices. Net income
was 44.7 billion baht, compared with the 43.7 billion-baht
average estimate of 23 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
