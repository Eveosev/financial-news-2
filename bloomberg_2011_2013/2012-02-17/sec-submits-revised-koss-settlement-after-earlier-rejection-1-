The U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission submitted a revised settlement of a lawsuit against
stereo headphone maker  Koss Corp. (KOSS)  and its chief executive
officer after a judge rejected an earlier one as too vague.  The SEC sued Milwaukee-based Koss in October, claiming it
had filed “materially inaccurate” financial statements from
2005 to 2009. The agency said the failure of Michael J. Koss,
who was CEO and chief financial officer, to supervise his
accounting staff enabled another executive to embezzle $30
million.  The SEC yesterday submitted a new settlement to U.S.
District Judge Rudolph T. Randa in  Milwaukee  after his rejection
of a prior one in December. As in the earlier one, the new
agreement requires the CEO to forfeit $450,000 and 160,000
options and to cooperate with the SEC. Neither the company nor
the Koss will admit or deny the SEC’s claims.  “There was no substantive difference” between the two
settlements, SEC lawyer Andrea Wood said today in a telephone
interview.  After rejecting the earlier proposal, Randa in December
asked the SEC to explain how it calculated the amount that Koss
would pay. SEC lawyers said the sum was equal to bonuses and
incentive pay that he received for the fiscal years 2008 and
2009 and part of 2010.  Randa said on Feb. 1 that the SEC’s response “largely”
satisfied his concerns.  Citigroup Case  Randa’s rejection of the December accord followed the Nov.
28 refusal by U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff in  New York  to
approve the SEC’s $285 million settlement with Citigroup Inc.
over a mortgage-backed securities fund. Rakoff said the agency
hadn’t provided him with enough facts.  Alan Berkeley, a partner in Pittsburgh-based  K&L Gates LLP (1142L) 
who is representing the company and the CEO, didn’t immediately
respond to a voice-mail message seeking comment on the revised
settlement.  Sujata Sachdeva, a former Koss finance executive, pleaded
guilty in 2010 to embezzling more than $30 million. She was
sentenced to 11 years in prison.  The case is U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission v. Koss
Corp., 11-cv-00991, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of
Wisconsin (Milwaukee). The criminal case is U.S. v. Sachdeva,
10-cr-00006, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of  Wisconsin 
(Milwaukee).  To contact the reporter on this story:
