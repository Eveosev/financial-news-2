U.S. stocks erased gains as optimism
among European leaders that a Greek bailout will be completed
failed to drive the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index above last
year’s peak.  The S&P 500 was little changed 1,357.96 at 11:06 a.m. in
 New York  after climbing 0.4 percent earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
