Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (TEVA) 
became the first generic drugmaker to gain U.S. approval to sell
a low-cost version of a  Roche Holding AG (ROG)  drug for colorectal and
breast cancers that have spread.  Teva, based in Petach Tikva,  Israel , is approved to market
150 milligram and 500 milligram strengths of capecitabine, the
active ingredient in Roche’s Xeloda, the Food and Drug
Administration said today in a  statement . Xeloda, approved in
1998, generated $1.6 billion in sales for Basel, Switzerland-based Roche last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “This medication is widely used by people living with
cancer, so it is important to have access to affordable
treatment options,’ Kathleen Uhl, acting director of the FDA’s
Office of Generic Drugs, said in the statement.  Capecitabine can increase the effect of blood thinners,
possibly leading to serious side effects, the FDA said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
