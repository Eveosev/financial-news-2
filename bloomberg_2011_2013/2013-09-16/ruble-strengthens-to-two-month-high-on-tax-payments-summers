The ruble climbed to the strongest
level in almost two months, buoyed by monthly tax payments and
rising appetite for emerging-market assets.  The currency advanced 0.5 percent against Bank Rossii’s
target basket of dollars and euros to 37.1308 by 3:37 p.m. in
Moscow, the ninth day of gains. The yield on 10-year government
bonds declined by 16 basis points, or 0.16 percentage point, to
7.27 percent.  The tax period, which lasts until the end of the month and
increases demand for rubles from exporting companies, started
today with mandatory transfers to pension and insurance funds.
Lawrence Summers, a former U.S. Treasury secretary, withdrew
from the race to lead the Federal Reserve, ending bets he would
undo the central bank’s policies aimed at holding down borrowing
costs. JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s  Emerging Markets  Currencies Index
rose 0.7 percent to 90.03, the highest since August 12.  “Exporters are driving preparations for the tax period,”
OAO  Rosbank (ROSB)  analysts led by Vladimir Kolychev said in an e-mailed note.  Russian companies will pay about 1.12 trillion rubles ($35
billion) of tax this month with 370 billion rubles, the largest
payment, for mineral extraction levies due Sept. 25, Anton Nikitin, an analyst at VTB Capital in Moscow, said in e-mailed
comments.  The currency of the world’s biggest energy exporter
advanced 0.3 percent versus the euro to 43.0680 and 0.7 percent
against the dollar to 32.2500. The ruble has gained 3.6 percent
against the dollar since Sept. 5, the sixth-best result among 24
developing-nation peers tracked by Bloomberg.  The recent rise in the ruble and other developing countries
currencies is a correction in a broader weakening trend, Nikitin
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
