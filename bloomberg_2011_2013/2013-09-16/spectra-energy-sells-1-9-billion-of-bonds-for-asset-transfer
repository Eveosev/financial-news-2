(Corrects issuer name in first paragraph, proceeds details
in third, in story published Sept. 16.)  Sept. 16 (Bloomberg) -  Spectra Energy Partners (SEP)  LP sold $1.9
billion of bonds in three parts to help fund the purchase of
assets.  The company issued $500 million of 2.95 percent, five-year
notes to yield 135 basis points more than similar-maturity
Treasuries, $1 billion of 4.75 percent, 10.5-year debt at a
relative yield of 190 basis points and $400 million of 5.95
percent, 30-year securities at a 205 basis-point spread,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Spectra Energy Partners will use proceeds from the offering
to purchase assets from Spectra Energy Corp., according to a
person with knowledge of the transaction who asked not to be
identified, citing lack of authorization to speak publicly.  The new bonds are expected to be rated Baa3, the lowest
level of investment grade, by Moody’s Investors Service, the
person said. Bank of America Corp., JPMorgan Chase & Co., Morgan
Stanley and Royal Bank of Canada managed the offering for the
Houston-based company.  The gas distributor last sold dollar-denominated debt in
February through its Spectra Energy Capital LLC subsidiary,
issuing $650 million of 3.3 percent, 10-year debentures at a
spread of 144 basis points, Bloomberg data show. The bonds
traded at 87.34 cents on the dollar to yield 4.99 percent on
Sept. 11, according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of
the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.  Transferring its assets to the master-limited partnership
will help boost dividends,  Spectra Energy Corp. (SE)  said in a June
11 statement. An MLP doesn’t pay corporate income tax, leaving
more cash for payments to investors.  To contact the reporter on this story:
