German Chancellor Angela Merkel
rejected a plea by her Free Democratic coalition partner for
help in surviving the Sept. 22 federal election.  FDP leader Philipp Roesler, reeling from a state election
drubbing for his party in  Bavaria  yesterday, called on backers
of Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union to split their ballot and
give the second vote to his party this weekend. Merkel slapped
him down today during a campaign rally.  “We have no votes to give away,” Merkel told supporters
in the town of Duderstadt, in Lower Saxony state. “Both votes
for the CDU, that’s our slogan.”  Merkel’s planned repeat of her current coalition was thrown
further into doubt after the FDP slumped to defeat in Bavaria,
where it failed to reach the 5 percent threshold needed to win
seats in the regional assembly.  That result prompted Roesler to make his plea for the
second of the two ballots each German voter receives. The first
ballot is cast for a candidate in their constituency, while the
second determines the share of seats each party gets in the
lower house of parliament, the Bundestag.  “Whoever wants to have Merkel, vote FDP,”  Rainer Bruederle , the FDP’s candidate for chancellor, told reporters in
Berlin today.  Merkel rebuffed that argument, saying that she wants the
first vote for the “strong voice” of the local CDU candidate
and the second vote for herself, because “I would like to work
for you for four more years.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
