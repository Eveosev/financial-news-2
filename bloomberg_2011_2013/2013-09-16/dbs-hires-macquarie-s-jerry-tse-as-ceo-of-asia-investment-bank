  DBS Group Holdings Ltd. (DBS) , Southeast
Asia’s largest bank, hired Jerry Tse from  Macquarie Group Ltd. (MQG) 
as chief executive officer for its  investment banking  unit,
replacing Stephen Ho.  Tse, 43, will start in November and be based in Hong Kong,
Grace Ngoh, a Singapore-based spokeswoman at the bank, said in
an e-mail. Ho is on sabbatical leave and remains with the firm,
she said.  DBS is ranked 10th advising on share sales in Asia outside
Japan this year, up from 18th in 2012, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. Chief Executive Officer  Piyush Gupta  said in
February 2010 the bank is seeking to reduce dependence on
Singapore from about two-thirds of revenue to 40 percent in five
years, with the rest of south and southeast Asia accounting for
30 percent and a similar share from Greater China.  Tse, who resigned from Macquarie this month after more than
five years at the Australian bank, has been involved with
investment banking in China for more than a decade, according to
a person with knowledge of the matter, who asked not to be named
before an official announcement is made. Tse had previously
worked for Morgan Stanley and Deutsche Bank AG.  In his new role, one of Tse’s major mandates will be to
boost DBS’s China and  Hong Kong  advisory operations, the person
said.  Elizabeth Cox, a Hong Kong spokeswoman at Macquarie,
declined to comment.  DBS got 38 percent of its profit from outside Singapore
last year, compared with 35 percent in 2008, according to the
bank’s annual reports.  To contact the reporter on this story:
