French country design suits many home interiors, but for a family who travels extensively and loves color, Moroccan was a better bet. "This Texas townhouse was bedecked in French country style for years and needed a new look," said Laura Umansky of Houston-based Laura U Interior Design, who led the charge on updating the space. "The family loves to travel, especially to Morocco, and their extensive collection of eclectic items from all their worldly travels made our choice simple." The entire home follows a Moroccan palette, filled with rich bold colors — with an emphasis on cobalt blue. White walls and dark trim keep the the look grounded and sophisticated. But the piece de resistance is the office, specifically designed as a work and inspirational space for the writer wife. There wasn't a budget for the office, shares Umansky, but there was a time constraint. "We had a small time crunch because the wife was expecting, and they were trying to get the home finished and settled before she was due," she said. The office is on the smaller side, a cozy space jutting off the entryway, separated from the rest of the home by a sliding barn door. The door was custom-built for the space, an elegant and functional feature that provides privacy without sacrificing space. "She wanted privacy but didn't want to close the room off," Umansky said. "The great thing about it is that you can open the door all the way, and it also shows off the arched entrance." Inside, the office maximizes its smaller space with custom built-ins. "The exotic curves and laser-cut panel inserts make the bookshelves, cabinet and desk really pop," Umansky said. Two padded seats sit under the windows on either side of the bookcase; a couch provides additional seating. White walls keeps the bright orange and pink upholstery from becoming overwhelming. The lighting— perforated hammered-tin lanterns — make the room cohesive and polished. See more of  Laura Umansky's design work on Zillow Digs .
