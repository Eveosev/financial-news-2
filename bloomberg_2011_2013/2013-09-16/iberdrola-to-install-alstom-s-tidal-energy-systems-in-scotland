Iberdrola SA (IBE) ’s U.K. unit agreed to
install tidal-energy turbines developed by  Alstom SA (ALO)  off the
west coast of Scotland.  ScottishPower Renewables Ltd., a unit of Spain’s largest
utility, plans to use four turbines supplied by Alstom at a site
between the islands of Islay and Jura, it said today in a
 statement  on its website. The machines will be set up alongside
four turbines developed by Andritz Hydro Hammerfest, the company
said, with the site reaching a capacity of about 10 megawatts.  Scotland offers one of the highest subsidies in the world
for projects that harness the power of the waves and tides. Its
waters are estimated to have as much as a quarter of  Europe ’s
tidal resources and a 10th of its wave resources. As yet there
are no commercial-scale projects in operation.  “Islay will now permit the two leading tidal power
technologies to be proven side by side and to take them both to
the point of commercialization,” Simon Christian, U.K. managing
director at ScottishPower Renewables, said in the statement.  Installation is expected to begin in late 2015. The
demonstration project should be a “launch pad” for future
large-scale sites around  Scotland , according to the statement.  Alstom’s technology was initially developed by Tidal
Generation Ltd., owned by  Rolls-Royce Holdings Plc. (RR/)  Alstom
bought the unit from Rolls-Royce in September 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
