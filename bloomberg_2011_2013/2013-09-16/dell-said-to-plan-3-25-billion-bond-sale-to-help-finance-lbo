Dell Inc. (DELL)  plans to raise $3.25
billion with a two-part bond offering after winning shareholder
approval for a $24.9 billion leveraged buyout, according to a
person with knowledge of the transaction.  The third-largest maker of personal computers intends to
issue $2 billion of first-lien seven-year notes and $1.25
billion of second-lien eight-year securities, said the person,
who asked not to be identified because terms aren’t set.  Bankers for the Round Rock, Texas-based company’s offering
plan to begin marketing the debt as soon as tomorrow, the person
said. Credit Suisse Group AG, Barclays Plc, Bank of America
Corp., Royal Bank of Canada and UBS AG are managing the
offering.  Approval for the buyout, announced Sept. 12, ended a battle
between Dell founder and Chief Executive Officer  Michael Dell 
and investors led by billionaire  Carl Icahn  and Southeastern
Asset Management Inc. over the takeover price. The takeover is
the biggest LBO since Blackstone Group LP took Hilton Worldwide
Inc. private in 2007.  To contact the reporter on this story:
