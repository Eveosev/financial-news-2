Commonwealth Bank of Australia  sold
$3 billion of bonds in a two-part, U.S. dollar-denominated
offering.  Australia ’s biggest lender by market value issued $1
billion of 2.5 percent, five-year notes and $2 billion of
floating-rate securities due in September 2016 that yield 50
basis points more than the three-month London interbank offered
rate, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The Sydney-based bank canceled a three-year portion of
fixed-rate debt, according to a person with knowledge of the
offering who asked not to be identified because terms weren’t
set.  Citigroup Inc., CBA, JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Morgan
Stanley managed the sale, Bloomberg data show.  Libor, the rate at which banks say they can borrow from
each other, was set today at 25 basis points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
