Indonesia’s bonds advanced, driving
the 10-year yield to a one-month low, and rupiah forwards gained
after  Lawrence Summers  withdrew from the race to become the next
Federal Reserve chief.  Summers may have provided less monetary stimulus than
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  when his term ends in January,
according to a Bloomberg Global Poll in which 47 percent of
respondents said  Janet Yellen , another candidate, would stick
with the current policy. One-month non-deliverable rupiah
forwards climbed for a third day after the central bank raised
 interest rates  last week to stem a slide in the currency.  “Summers is more conservative and would have been keen to
reduce stimulus sooner as he thinks the  U.S. economy  has
improved,” said Rully Nova, a foreign-exchange analyst at PT
Bank Himpunan Saudara 1906 in Jakarta. “Continuing euphoria
over  Bank Indonesia ’s responsiveness in raising rates to tackle
inflation is also supporting the rupiah and bonds.”  The yield on the 5.625 percent notes due May 2023 fell 40
basis points, or 0.40 percentage point, to 7.95 percent as of
9:45 a.m. in Jakarta, the lowest level since Aug. 14 and the
biggest drop in almost two months, according to prices from the
Inter Dealer Market Association.  One-month rupiah forwards rose 1 percent to 11,155 per
dollar, trading 2.3 percent stronger than the spot rate, the
biggest premium in data tracked by Bloomberg going back to 2001.
In the onshore market, the currency was little changed at 11,416
from 11,410 on Sept. 13, prices from local banks compiled by
Bloomberg show.  Ease Inflation  Bank  Indonesia  boosted its benchmark  reference rate  to 7.25
percent on Sept. 12 from 7 percent. The move will speed up an
improvement in the current-account deficit and stabilize
inflation, Deputy Governor Perry Warjiyo said the same day.
Consumer prices rose 8.79 percent in August from a year earlier,
the fastest pace in four years, official data showed Sept. 2.  One-month implied volatility in the rupiah, a measure of
expected moves in the exchange rate used to price options, fell
65 basis points to 17.79 percent, the least since Aug. 20, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. A  fixing  used to settle rupiah
forwards was set at 11,174 per dollar on Sept. 13, according to
the Association of Banks in Singapore.  To contact the reporter on this story:
