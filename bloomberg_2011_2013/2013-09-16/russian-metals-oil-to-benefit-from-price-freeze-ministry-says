Russia’s oil, metals, coal and
chemicals industries stand to benefit from a planned freeze in
state-regulated tariffs next year, according to an  Economy
Ministry  report sent to Prime Minister  Dmitry Medvedev .  Keeping tariffs such as transportation unchanged will
provide  oil companies  with savings of 99.8 billion rubles ($3.1
billion) in 2014-2016, while the metals industry will save 38.1
billion rubles, coal 37 billion and chemicals and petrochemicals
18.1 billion rubles, according to the report, a copy of which
has been seen by  Bloomberg News .  With economic growth at the slowest since a 2009 recession,
the government is seeking ways to tame inflation so the central
bank can cut  interest rates . Companies such as OAO Russian
Railways object to the plan, with the rail monopoly saying a
2014 freeze in tariff’s would prompt it to slash its investment
program by 75 percent.  Canceling next year’s tariff increases will lower domestic
profit at natural gas export monopoly  OAO Gazprom (OGZD)  by 590 billion
to 600 billion rubles from 2014 to 2016, according to the
report. Raising tariffs in line with inflation would reduce that
figure to 190 billion to 200 billion rubles, the report shows.  Gazprom can offset some of the impact of the tariff freeze
through internal cost savings and higher productivity, the
Economy Ministry said.  Electricity network companies may lose 97.3 billion rubles
during those three years, while Russian Railways may lose 250
billion to 260 billion rubles, according to the report.  Falling revenue at state companies will increase profit at
other industrial companies by 2.5 percent to 3 percent a year,
the ministry estimates. The economy as a whole, excluding the
financial industry, will save 438 billion rubles in 2014-2016,
while citizens will save an extra 129.1 billion, the report
shows.  To contact the reporters on this story:
