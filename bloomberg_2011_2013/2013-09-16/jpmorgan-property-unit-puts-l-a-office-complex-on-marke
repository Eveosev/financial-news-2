A  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  unit put its
 Century Park  property, a  Los Angeles  office complex where
 Creative Artists Agency  has its headquarters, up for sale.  J.P. Morgan Asset Management is marketing the 3.2 million-square-foot (297,000-square-meter) Century Park on behalf of
institutional investors, said Darin Oduyoye, a New York-based
spokesman for the company. The property, located in the Century
City business district, may fetch more than $2 billion, said a
person with knowledge of the plans who asked not to be
identified because the expected price isn’t public.  The complex has two 44-story towers housing high-end
offices along with stores and restaurants, as well as a 4-acre
(1.6-hectare) park and the Annenberg Space for Photography. A
sale may come by the end of the year, the person said.  Eastdil Secured LLC is the broker marketing the complex,
Oduyoye said. Martha Wallau, a spokeswoman for Eastdil, didn’t
immediately return a phone call seeking comment.  Blackstone Group LP (BX)  in April planned to market a 21-story
building at 1888 Century Park East valued at more than $300
million, two people with knowledge of the effort said at the
time.  J.P. Morgan Asset Management’s plans to market Century Park
were reported earlier today by the Hollywood Reporter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
