Copper climbed by the most in a
week, rebounding from a five-week low, as former Treasury
Secretary  Lawrence Summers  withdrew his nomination to lead the
 Federal Reserve , boosting bets a tapering will be slower.  Copper for delivery in three months on the London Metal
Exchange advanced as much as 1.1 percent to $7,120.25 a metric
ton, the biggest gain since Sept. 9, and was at $7,064.25 by
2:50 p.m. in  Shanghai . The price touched $7,024 on Sept. 13, the
lowest intra-day level since Aug. 8.  Summers would tighten Fed policy more than  Janet Yellen ,
who was his main rival to replace Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke ,
according to a Bloomberg Global Poll last week. The central bank
may trim Treasury purchases by $10 billion a month at its two-day meeting starting tomorrow, a separate survey showed.  “The metal market was encouraged by Summers’ departure,”
said Lin Hui, head of research at Orient Futures Co. in Shanghai.
“That gave a strong indication that a possible tapering of
quantitative easing would slow with the next Fed leader.”  Copper prices also rose as they climbed above a 60-day
moving average at around $7,045 a ton, Lin said. Inventories
tracked by the LME fell 3.8 percent last week, the most since
September last year.  Metal for delivery in December declined 0.2 percent to
close at 51,180  yuan  ($8,364) a ton on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange. The contract for delivery in December rose 0.3 percent
to $3.214 a pound on the Comex in New York.  On the LME, aluminum also increased, while tin and nickel
dropped. Zinc and lead were little changed.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
