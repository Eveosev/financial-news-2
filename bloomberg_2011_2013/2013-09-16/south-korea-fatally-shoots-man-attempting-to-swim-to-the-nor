South Korea ’s military shot and
killed a man trying to cross into  North Korea , the South’s Joint
Chiefs of Staff said.  The shooting took place about 2:20 p.m. after the man was
spotted in a river that serves as a border between the two
countries, the military said in a statement, which didn’t
identify the man or explain why he tried to enter North Korea.  “The person jumped into the Imjin river without complying
with our military guard’s order that he return south,” the
military said in the statement.  The shooting comes as North and South Korea reopened the
jointly run Gaeseong industrial complex today, five months after
it was shuttered amid the North’s threats of a preemptive
nuclear attack.  Citizens from North and South Korea, which remain
technically at war after the 1950-53  Korean War  ended in a
truce, aren’t allowed to travel to the other side without
approval.  Defection attempts from South to North are unusual. In
2009, a South Korean man wanted by police made it to the North
by cutting a hole in a fence inside the demilitarized zone which
separates the two countries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
