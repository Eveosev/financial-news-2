Commonwealth Bank of Australia 
plans to issue $3 billion of bonds in a two-part, U.S. dollar-denominated offering.  Australia ’s biggest lender by market value may sell $1
billion of five-year notes to yield 90 basis points more than
similar-maturity Treasuries and $2 billion of floating-rate
securities due in three years that may yield 50 basis points
more than the London interbank offered rate, according to a
person with knowledge of the offering. The Sydney-based bank
canceled a three-year portion of fixed-rate debt said the
person, who asked not to be identified because terms aren’t set.  Citigroup Inc., CBA, JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Morgan
Stanley will manage the offering, according to the person.  Libor, the rate at which banks say they can borrow from
each other, was set today at 25 basis points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
