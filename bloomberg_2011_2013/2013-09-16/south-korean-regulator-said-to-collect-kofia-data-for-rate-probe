South Korean antitrust agency
officials collected documents from a financial industry group
that sets benchmark rates amid a 14-month probe into borrowing
costs, two people with knowledge of the matter said.  Fair Trade Commission  inspectors on Sept. 13 gathered data
about certificate of deposit rates from a Seoul office of the
Korea Financial Investment Association, whose members include
brokerages and asset managers, the people said, asking not to be
identified as they aren’t authorized to talk to media. The
Chosun Ilbo newspaper reported the visit earlier today.  South Korea  in December introduced a new benchmark rate for
bank lending as the investigation into potential collusion by
lenders and brokerages to manipulate borrowing costs drew ire
from customers and lawmakers. The FTC had begun looking into
possible rigging of the 91-day CD cost, a key money-market rate
in the nation, in July 2012.  A spokesman for the Korea Financial Investment Association
-- which sets the CD rate twice a day based on submissions by 10
brokerages -- declined to comment on the FTC visit and asked not
to be named, citing the group’s policy. The FTC’s press official
didn’t return five calls to his office.  To contact the reporter on this story:
