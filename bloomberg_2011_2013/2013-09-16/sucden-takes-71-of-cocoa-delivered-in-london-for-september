Sucres et Denrees SA took 71
percent of all the cocoa delivered against the expired September
futures on the NYSE Liffe exchange in  London .  The Paris-based trader bought 13,210 metric tons of the
beans, said Derek Chambers, head of cocoa at company, known as
Sucden. The total delivery amounted to 18,670 tons and was the
biggest since the May contract expired, data on the exchange’s
website today showed. Beans from  Ivory Coast , the world’s
largest producer, amounted to 11,320 tons and Sucden was the
receiver of 5,860 tons of those, the data showed.  “Nearby cocoa is of good value, given the high prices at
auctions in Ivory Coast,” Chambers said by phone from Paris
today. Most grades of cocoa were trading at a premium to the
exchange in the physical market, he said.  Cocoa futures for September delivery expired last week at
1,699 pounds ($2,707) a ton, putting Sucden’s purchase at about
22.4 million pounds, according to Bloomberg calculations. The
total delivery was valued at 31.7 million pounds.  Beans from Ivory Coast for shipment from October to
December were offered at this morning’s auction at a minimum
price of 1,350  CFA francs  ($2.74) a kilogram (2.2 pounds),
according to data on the website of industry regulator Le
Conseil du Cafe-Cacao. That equates to about 1,720 pounds a ton.  Broker Sucden Financial Ltd., an arm of Sucres et Denrees,
acted on behalf of the company. Newedge U.K. Financial Ltd. took
delivery of 5,460 tons on behalf of a client, exchange data
showed. Brokers delivering were ADM Investor Services
International Ltd., Jefferies Bache Ltd., JP Morgan Securities
Plc, BNP Paribas Commodity Futures Ltd. and Newedge U.K.
Financial.  To contact the reporter on this story:
