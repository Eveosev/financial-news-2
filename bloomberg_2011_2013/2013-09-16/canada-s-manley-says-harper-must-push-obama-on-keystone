Prime Minister Stephen Harper must
continue to lobby President  Barack Obama  for approval of the
Keystone XL pipeline, said the head of an organization that
represents Canadian executives.  “Your continued direct engagement with President Obama is
critical,” John Manley, head of the Canadian Council of Chief
Executives, said today in a letter to Harper released on the
organization’s website.  Canada is at a “make-or-break” point in its negotiations
with the European Union on a free-trade pact, Manley said.
Unless both sides move quickly, an agreement may “slip out of
reach,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
