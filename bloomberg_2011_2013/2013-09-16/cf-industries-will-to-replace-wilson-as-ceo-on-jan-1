CF Industries Holdings Inc. (CF) , the
fertilizer producer that’s been criticized by activist hedge
fund Third Point LLC over its dividend payments, said W. Anthony Will will succeed Chief Executive Officer Stephen Wilson as of
Jan. 1.  Will, 48, currently CF’s senior vice president of
manufacturing and distribution, has been with North America’s
largest maker of nitrogen-based fertilizer since 2007,
Deerfield, Illinois-based CF said today in a statement. Wilson
will continue in his role as chairman, the company said.  “The board has focused on developing strong management
talent and we are confident that Tony Will has the right
experience and capabilities to lead CF Industries,” Wilson, 64,
said in the statement.  Will first served as a vice president of corporate
development and played “a major role” in the acquisition of
Terra Industries Inc. in 2010, CF said in the statement.  CF  rose  3.5 percent to $200.68 at the close in New York.
The shares have declined 1.2 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
