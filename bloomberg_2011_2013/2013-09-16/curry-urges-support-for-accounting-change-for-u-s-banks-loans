U.S. Comptroller of the Currency
 Thomas Curry  said a proposed change to the way banks set aside
reserves for bad loans is an “important step.”  Curry said he supports a plan by the  Financial Accounting
Standards Board  that would require banks to set aside more
reserves earlier for bad loans when “reasonable and supportable
forecasts” estimate a shortfall for a loan. Curry and other
bank regulators have warned banks not to reduce loan-loss
reserves to show higher profits.  Curry, the top U.S. national bank regulator, said lenders’
complaints about the new accounting proposal are “exaggerated”
and the change would require only a “far more modest” increase
in reserves than the lenders have suggested.  “None of this comes with a guarantee for a crisis-free
future,” Curry said in remarks prepared for a speech at a
conference of the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants in  Fort Washington ,  Maryland . “But the steps
proposed in the new accounting standard improve the chances that
when  credit quality  turns down and risk turns up, as they are
certain to do in the future, banks’ allowance levels will
appropriately reflect the risks retained in their loan
portfolios.”  Curry also said he is concerned that the proposal may be
burdensome for community banks and debt securitizers. 2He said
the OCC has urged FASB to provide “adequate” implementation
time for smaller, less complex banks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
