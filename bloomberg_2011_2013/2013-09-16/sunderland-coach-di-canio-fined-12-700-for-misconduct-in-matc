Sunderland coach Paolo Di Canio was
fined 8,000 pounds ($12,700) after accepting a charge of
misconduct because of his behavior in a 3-1 home loss to Arsenal
last weekend.  The manager received a standard penalty for the infraction,
 England â€™s Football Association said today on its website. Di
Canio invited referee  Martin Atkinson  to send him into the
stands after complaining about Arsenal time-wasting in the final
minutes of the game two days ago.  Sunderland is in last place in the Premier League, with 1
point from 4 games.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
