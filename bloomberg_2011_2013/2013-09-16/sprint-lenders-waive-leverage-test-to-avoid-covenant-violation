Sprint Corp. (S)  lenders agreed to
waive a quarterly leverage test until Dec. 31, following the
third-largest U.S. mobile phone carrier’s debt sale this month
that threatened to trigger a loan default.  Sprint, which also obtained similar agreements for its
revolving credit facility and a Canadian loan, has now received
all “necessary waivers” from lenders, the Overland Park,
Kansas-based company said in a statement today. Its $6.5 billion
bond sale would have breached the terms of its loans “by a
significant level” at the end of the month, according to a
Sept. 4 regulatory filing.  The company had about $1.9 billion of borrowings
outstanding linked to the loans on June 30, including $913
million letters of credit under the revolver, when its debt was
4.2 times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization, according to an Aug. 5 regulatory filing. Terms of
the loan prohibit the  leverage ratio  from exceeding 6.25 times.  Sprint completed the biggest junk-bond  offering  since 2008
with its sale at lower relative yields than it paid a year ago
after an investment from  Softbank Corp. (9984) , a company three times
the size of the U.S. unit. Sprint investors approved the $21.6
billion deal in June, giving Tokyo-based Softbank control of the
carrier.  Sprint issued $4.25 billion of 7.875 percent, 10-year bonds
that paid 498 basis points, or 4.98 percentage points, more than
similar-maturity Treasuries and $2.25 billion of 7.25 percent
securities due in 2021 at 466 basis points over benchmarks,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Both spreads are
narrower than a year ago, when the carrier paid 568 basis points
more than Treasuries to borrow $1.5 billion for eight years.  The notes due in 2023 were quoted at 103.8 cents on the
dollar today to yield 7.33 percent, Bloomberg prices show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
