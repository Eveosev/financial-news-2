Scotland  approved a Morgan Stanley-backed venture that will use turbines to harness the power of
tides to generate electricity in the region’s waters.  MeyGen Ltd., owned by  Morgan Stanley (MS) , Atlantis Resources
Corp. and International Power Ltd., a  GDF Suez (GSZ)  SA unit, won
consent to install tidal turbines in stages, starting with a 9-megawatt demonstration project, the Scottish government said
today in a statement on its  website . The project, in the
Pentland Firth off the coast of northern Scotland, may
eventually reach 398 megawatts.  The development will be “the largest tidal turbine array
in Europe and the first commercial project off these shores,”
Scottish Energy Minister Fergus Ewing said in the statement.
“When fully operational, the 86-megawatt array could generate
enough electricity to power the equivalent of 42,000 homes --
around 40 percent of homes in the highlands.”  Scotland, aiming for all of its electricity to come from
clean sources by 2020, may have as much as a quarter of  Europe ’s
tidal resources, according to government estimates. It offers
one of the highest subsidies in the world for marine energy.  The Scottish government also said today that the wave
energy technology companies Aquamarine Power Ltd. and Pelamis
Wave Power Ltd. will share 13 million pounds ($21 million). The
money comes from funds the government set aside to support the
testing of marine technologies to try to accelerate their
commercialization.  To contact the reporter on this story:
