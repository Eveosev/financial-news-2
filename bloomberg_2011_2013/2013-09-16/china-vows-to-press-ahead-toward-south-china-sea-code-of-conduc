China and the  Association of
Southeast Asian Nations  vowed to seek consensus on creating a
set of rules to avoid tensions in the  South China Sea , the
Foreign Ministry said today.  Officials at a three-day meeting in the Chinese city of
Suzhou agreed to set up a working group to discuss details of a
code of conduct and set up a panel of experts and eminent
people, Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei said today.  “The principles of making gradual progress and seeking
consensus is what was agreed upon by all participants to the
meeting,” Hong said.  China agreed to the talks on a code of conduct in July,
after having resisted negotiations as competition for oil, gas
and fish in the waters increased tensions with fellow claimants
including the  Philippines . It took almost a decade for Asean and
China to agree on a way to implement a non-binding 2002
declaration to keep peace in the waters.  Since 2010, China has cut the cables of survey ships
working for  Vietnam , chased away an exploration vessel near the
Philippines and sent its first deep-water drilling rig to the
region. Last year, China National Offshore invited bids for
exploration blocks that Vietnam had already awarded to companies
including Exxon Mobil Corp. and OAO Gazprom.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
