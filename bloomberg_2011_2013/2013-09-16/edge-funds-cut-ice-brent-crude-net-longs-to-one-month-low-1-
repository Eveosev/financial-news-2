Hedge funds  and other money
managers cut  bullish bets  for a second week to their lowest
level in a month, according to data from ICE Futures  Europe .  Speculative bets that prices will rise, in futures and
options combined, outnumbered short positions by 203,151 lots in
the week ended Sept. 10, the London-based exchange said today in
its weekly Commitments of Traders report. The reduction of
21,754 contracts, or 10 percent, brings net-longs down to their
lowest since Aug. 13.  Bearish positions by producers, merchants, processors and
users of Brent outnumbered bullish positions by 372,241, a 7
percent reduction in their net-short position from a week
earlier that brings it to the smallest since July 2.  ICE publishes, usually each Monday, aggregate numbers for
long and short positions for speculators and institutional
investors, as well as commercial companies that buy or sell
futures to protect against price moves. Analysts and investors
follow changes in speculators’ positions because such
transactions can reflect an expectation of a change in prices.  Brent fell 3.8 percent in the week to Sept. 10 to $111.25 a
barrel and traded at $109.67 as of 12:01 p.m. local time today
on the ICE exchange.  Swaps dealers trimmed net-long positions in Brent by 0.8
percent to 185,179, the lowest since April 9.  Money managers ’ net-long bets on European gasoil fell for
the first time in four weeks, by 0.4 percent to 83,100 lots.  To contact the reporter on this story:
