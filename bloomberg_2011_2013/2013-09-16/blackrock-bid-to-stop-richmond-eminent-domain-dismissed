BlackRock Inc. (BLK) ’s lawsuit with other
bondholders to block Richmond,  California , from seizing
underwater home loans through eminent domain was dismissed by a
federal judge in  San Francisco .  U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer ruled today that the
case had to be dismissed, rather than put on hold, because the
claims depend on “future events that may never occur.”  Breyer said on Sept. 13 that bondholders’ request for an
injunction blocking the city from continuing to pursue the plan
was premature because city council members hadn’t voted on
whether to go to state court to seize the loans.  Bank trustees for bondholders including Pacific Investment
Management Co. and DoubleLine Capital LP sued last month
alleging Richmond’s plan to seize more than 600 loans on which
the amount owed is more than the value of the property through
eminent domain and refinance them to give homeowners built-in
equity was unconstitutional.  Richmond Mayor Gayle McLaughlin and lawyers for Mortgage
Resolution Partners LLC, a firm that will provide financing, say
the plan will prevent foreclosures and blight. Lawyers for the
trustees allege that some of the targeted loans are still
performing and the plan will harm investors and disrupt the U.S.
housing market if it’s allowed to proceed and other communities
follow suit.  The cases are Wells Fargo Bank v. City of Richmond,
13-03663, and Bank of  New York  Mellon v. City of Richmond,
13-03664, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California
(San Francisco).  To contact the reporters on this story:
