Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC) , the largest U.S.
home lender, would survive $29.7 billion of loan defaults under
a company-run  stress test  and stay above minimum regulatory
capital levels in a severe economic downturn.  The bank’s Tier 1 common ratio would fall as low as 9.9
percent under a severely adverse scenario, above the 5 percent
minimum set by U.S. regulators, the San Francisco-based firm
said today in a  presentation  on its website. Wells Fargo would
set aside $48.5 billion in provisions, $18.8 billion more than
projected loan defaults over nine quarters through June 2015.
The firm would incur $3.8 billion in pretax losses in that span.  The biggest U.S. lenders must conduct so-called mid-cycle
stress tests using their own scenarios and disclose a summary of
the results. While the tests are submitted to the  Federal
Reserve , they aren’t related to approval of the banks’ capital
plans, which help determine dividends and share repurchases.  Wells Fargo’s projections assume home prices declining 20
percent and commercial real estate prices falling 30 percent.
The long-term mortgage rate would fall as low as 2.58 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
