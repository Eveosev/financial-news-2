Unionized workers at  General Motors
Co. (GM) ’s CAMI assembly plant in Ingersoll, Ontario, approved a
four-year deal with the automaker that the union said will help
to create “hundreds” of jobs.  Ninety percent of union members approved the pact at a
meeting in  London , Ontario, today,  Canada ’s Unifor union said in
an e-mailed statement. The agreement includes a C$3,000 ($2,910)
signing bonus and annual lump sum payments of C$2,000 in 2014,
2015 and 2016, the union said. It protects current pension
benefits for active workers and retirees and gives full-time
jobs to hundreds of temporary workers, Unifor also said.  The plant in Ingersoll bargains separately from other GM
plants represented by Unifor. Those factories reached a four-year labor agreement last year, which cut the hourly rate for
new hires to C$20.40 from C$23.80. The agreement was similar to
agreements reached with  Ford Motor Co. (F)  and Chrysler Group LLC.  GM on  March 8  announced plans to invest in the Ingersoll
plant to install body shop equipment and tools to permit the
factory to build more types of vehicles. The factory’s current
products include the Chevrolet Equinox.  To contact the reporter on this story:
