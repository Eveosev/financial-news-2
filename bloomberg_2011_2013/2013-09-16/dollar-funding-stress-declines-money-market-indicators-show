Money-market forward indicators
signaled short-term dollar funding conditions eased with the
rate banks say it would cost to borrow from one another for
three months dropping to the lowest in more than two years.  Three-month London interbank offered rate, or  Libor (US0003M) , fell
to 0.25185, the lowest level since July 2011, according to the
British Bankers’ Association. The Libor-OIS spread, a gauge of
banks reluctance to lend, narrowed to 15.5 basis points from
16.8 basis points on Sept. 13.  Overnight index swaps, or OIS, give traders predictions on
where the Fed’s effective funds rate will average for the term
of the swap. The central bank’s target rate is set in a range of
zero to 0.25 percent.  The difference between the two-year swap rate and the
comparable-maturity Treasury note yield, known as the swap
spread, narrowed 0.88 basis point to 15.1 basis points. The gap
is a gauge of investors’ perceptions of U.S. banking sector
credit risk as swap rates are derived from expectations for
dollar Libor.  Swap rates serve as benchmarks for investors in many types
of debt, including mortgage-backed and auto-loan securities.  The seasonally adjusted amount of U.S.  commercial paper 
rose $1.96 billion to $1.035 trillion in the week ended Sept. 11
according to Federal Reserve data.  Euribor-OIS Spread  The cost for European banks to convert euro-denominated
payment streams into dollars-based funding via the cross
currency swaps market increased. The three-month cross-currency
basis swap was 8.74 basis points below Euribor, from 8.61 basis
points below.  Foreign-exchange swaps are typically for periods of less
than a year, while cross-currency basis swaps usually range from
one to 30 years. The latter are agreements in which a person
borrows in one currency and simultaneously lends in a different
currency. The trade involves the exchange of two different
floating-rate payments, each denominated in a different currency
and based on a different index.  The Euribor-OIS spread, the difference between the euro
interbank offered rate and overnight indexed swaps, narrowed.
The measure of banks’ reluctance to lend to one another widened
to 13.2 basis points from 12.8 basis points.  Repo Rates  The overnight Treasury general collateral repurchase
agreement rate opened today at 0.09 percent, according to ICAP
Plc, the world’s largest inter-dealer broker.  The  average rate  for borrowing and lending Treasuries for
one day in the repo market was 0.073 percent on Sept. 13,
according to index data provided on a one-day lag by the
Depository Trust & Clearing Corp.  Securities dealers use repos to finance holdings and
increase leverage. Securities that can be borrowed at  interest
rates  close to the Fed’s target rate are called general
collateral. Those in highest demand have lower rates and are
called “special.”  The  average rate  for overnight federal funds, known as the
fed effective rate, was 0.08 percent. The rate opened today at
0.09 percent. The effective rate is a volume-weighted average of
trades between major brokers for overnight funds, reported on a
day lag by the  Federal Reserve Bank of New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
