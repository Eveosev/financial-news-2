Vincent McGonagle, the U.S.
Commodity Futures Trading Commission official who opened probes
of interest-rate manipulation by banks including UBS AG and
 Barclays Plc (BARC) , was named to head the CFTC market oversight unit.  McGonagle, who has been with the agency for nearly 16
years, will take the helm next month of a division responsible
for monitoring trading platforms, data repositories and new
products to ensure they aren’t susceptible to manipulation, CFTC
Chairman  Gary Gensler  said in a statement today.  “Liquid, fair and financially secure U.S. derivatives
markets are at the core of our mission, and I look forward to
being more directly involved in the regulatory oversight of
these markets,” McGonagle, 49, said in the statement.  In 2008, he opened an investigation into the London
interbank offered rate that has led to settlements with UBS,
Barclays and  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc . The three banks
have paid a total of about $2.5 billion in fines for colluding
to rig benchmark  interest rates  for profit or to mask their true
cost of borrowing.  The CFTC oversees futures and swaps markets tied to
interest rates,  default risk  and commodities including oil and
natural gas. The agency is implementing rules under the 2010
Dodd-Frank Act to boost swaps oversight after unregulated trades
were faulted for fueling the 2008 credit crisis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
