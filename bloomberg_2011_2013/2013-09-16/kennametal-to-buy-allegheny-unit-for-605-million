Kennametal Inc. (KMT) , a maker of metal-cutting tools, agreed to buy the tungsten materials unit of
supplier  Allegheny Technologies Inc. (ATI)  for $605 million to help
expand its aerospace and energy business.  The acquisition is structured as both an asset and stock
purchase that will create a cash tax benefit of as much as $70
million, Kennametal said today in a statement. The Latrobe,
Pennsylvania-based company said it expects the deal to close by
year’s end.  Adding ATI’s tungsten unit, which makes counterweights and
control services for aerospace manufacturers in addition to
industrial alloys and powders, will deepen Kennametal’s access
to raw materials. It will also accelerate Kennametal’s plans to
open its own tungsten carbide recycling facility.  The purchase will reduce planned capital expenditures by at
least $30 million, Kennametal said. The company will use cash
and available borrowings under its existing credit revolver to
pay for the tungsten business. Pittsburgh-based ATI said the
unit’s annual sales are about $340 million.  Kennametal was advised by JPMorgan Chase & Co. ATI’s
financial adviser was Goldman, Sachs & Co., and K&L Gates LLP
provided legal counsel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
