Northern Dynasty Minerals Ltd. (NDM) , a
Canadian metals explorer, fell the most in 15 months after  Anglo
American Plc (AAL)  withdrew from a partnership to develop the Pebble
copper project in Alaska.  Northern Dynasty plunged 34 percent to C$1.54 at the close
in Toronto, the biggest drop since May 22, 2012.  Anglo announced its exit today in a statement. The London-based company is reviewing its operations and said it’s
prioritizing capital for projects with the highest value and the
lowest risk. Anglo will take a $300 million writedown on its
interest in the project.  A call to Northern Dynasty’s Vancouver headquarters wasn’t
immediately returned.  The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said last year
that large-scale salmon habitats may be harmed by mining near
 Bristol Bay , Alaska, where Pebble is located. The deposit is
estimated to hold 81 billion pounds (37 million metric tons) of
copper, 5.6 billion pounds of molybdenum and 107 million ounces
of gold, according to Northern Dynasty’s  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
