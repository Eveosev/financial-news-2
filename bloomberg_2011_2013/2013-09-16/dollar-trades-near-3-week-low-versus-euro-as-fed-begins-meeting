The dollar declined, trading at
almost the lowest in a month, as analysts trimmed projections
for Federal Reserve reductions to the central bank’s bond-buying
during a two-day meeting starting today.  The U.S. currency weakened as the  Federal Open Market
Committee  will decide to slow its monthly purchases to $80
billion from $85 billion, according to the median estimate of
economists in a Bloomberg News survey, less reduction than
previous surveys. The euro strengthened for a second day against
the dollar and yen after an industry report showed German
investor confidence climbed more than forecast.  India ’s rupee
fell the most in two weeks on speculation a reduction in U.S.
stimulus may hurt demand for emerging-market assets.  “The market has been pricing in tapering and it’s likely
to come sooner or later,”  Robert Lynch , a currency strategist
at HSBC Holdings Plc in New York, said in a phone interview.
“It’s reasonable to expect they’ll emphasize the difference
between quantitative easing and interest-rate policies. They’ll
maintain a strong emphasis on that.”  The Bloomberg U.S. Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback
against the performance of a basket of 10 major currencies,
dropped 0.1 percent to 1,019.58 at 5 p.m. New York time, after
falling to 1,017.30 yesterday, the lowest level since Aug. 12.  The dollar fell 0.2 percent to $1.3359 per euro after
reaching $1.3386 yesterday, the weakest level since Aug. 28. The
U.S. currency rose 0.1 percent to 99.13 yen while the 17-nation
euro added 0.2 percent to 132.42 yen.  Real Climbs  Brazil ’s real climbed 1.2 percent to 2.2561 per dollar, the
strongest on a closing basis since July 25, after the nation’s
central bank rolled over foreign-exchange swap contracts worth
$1.97 billion to support the currency in an effort to curb
inflation.  Australia ’s dollar advanced 0.4 percent to 93.56 U.S. cents
after reaching 93.94 yesterday, the strongest since June 19. The
 New Zealand dollar  climbed for a second day, gaining 0.8 percent
to 82.37 cents. It touched 82.30 yesterday, the most since May
16.  The rupee fell for the first time in three days before the
 Reserve Bank  of India meets to review policy on Sept. 20.  “Nobody really wants to take a view ahead of the Fed and
RBI decisions,” said Vivek Chaturvedi, associate vice president
for foreign exchange and derivatives at Ratnakar Bank Ltd. in
Mumbai. “The rupee is in a delicate balance” after the recent
gains, he said.  Rupee Trade  The rupee fell 0.8 percent to 63.37 per dollar, the biggest
decline since Sept. 3. The currency has strengthened 3.7 percent
this month.  Trading in over-the-counter foreign-exchange options
totaled $16 billion, from $15 billion yesterday, according to
data reported by U.S. banks to the Depository Trust Clearing
Corp. and tracked by Bloomberg. Volume in options on the dollar-Chinese  yuan   exchange rate  amounted to $3.4 billion, the largest
share of trades at 21 percent. Options on the dollar-yen rate
totaled $2.3 billion.  Dollar-yuan options trading was 50 percent more than the
average for the past five Tuesdays at a similar time in the day,
according to Bloomberg analysis. Greenback-yen options trading
was 49 percent less than average.  The ZEW Center for European Economic Research said its
index of German investor and analyst expectations, which aims to
predict economic developments six months in advance, rose to
49.6 in September from 42 in August. That’s the highest level
since April 2010.  Economic Reading  “The German data has been helping the euro; Economic data
has been stable enough to carry the currency,” Sireen Harajli,
a strategist at Mizuho Bank in  New York , said in a telephone
interview.  The JPMorgan G7 Volatility Index fell to 8.99 percent, the
lowest in four months. It’s below the average 9.57 percent this
year.  The FOMC will decide to slow its monthly bond purchases to
$40 billion of Treasuries, down from $45 billion, and $40
billion of mortgage-backed securities, unchanged, according to
the median estimate of economists in a Bloomberg News survey. A
Sept. 6 survey projected a $10 billion cut per month in
Treasuries buying.  The central bank cut its target for overnight bank lending
to a range of zero to 0.25 percent in December 2008 as the
financial crisis mounted, and has vowed to keep it there until
the economy and employment show sustained signs of recovery.  “People are staying on the sideline before the FOMC
meeting,” Harajli said. “The Fed will probably reaffirm their
forward guidance tomorrow that tapering isn’t tightening,
 interest rates  are going to stay low.”  The euro has gained 4.7 percent this year, the best
performer of 10 developed-nation currencies tracked by Bloomberg
Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The dollar rose 3.3 percent, while
the yen tumbled 11 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
