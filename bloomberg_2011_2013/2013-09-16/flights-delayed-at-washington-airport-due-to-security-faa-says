Delays of as much as 90 minutes at
Washington  Reagan National  Airport tapered off following an
earlier halt on most flights in response to shootings at a
nearby U.S. Navy facility.  The U.S.  Federal Aviation Administration  ended a halt on
most flights at Reagan National shortly after 10 a.m. local
time, the agency said in a statement.  “We expect residual delays as we return to normal,” Lori
Weaver, a spokeswoman for the Metropolitan Washington Airports
Authority, said in an interview.  Aircraft scheduled to depart for Reagan National, the 26th-busiest U.S. airport according to trade group  Airports Council
International , were held on the ground around the U.S. until
about 10:30, according to the FAA.  Planes that were already in the air had been allowed to
land at National, the agency said in the statement.  The FAA
took the action “to facilitate law enforcement aircraft”
responding to the shooting, according to the statement.  The airport is located in  Virginia  across the Potomac River
from the U.S. Naval Sea Systems Command headquarters in
Washington. Four people were killed and eight injured in the
shootings, the Washington Post reported.  To contact the reporters on this story:
