The U.K.’s accounting regulator
opened an investigation of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP’s fiscal
2012 audit of  Berkeley Group Holdings Plc (BKG)  because a former
partner at the firm had joined the homebuilder’s board.  The  Financial Reporting Council  is reviewing whether there
was a conflict of interest when PwC audited the Cobham, England-based company’s financial statements for the year ended April
30, 2012, the regulator said in a  statement  today. Former PwC
U.K. vice chairman Glyn Barker joined Berkeley’s board in
January 2012 after 35 years at the accounting firm, according to
Berkeley’s website.  “We will continue to fully cooperate with the FRC’s
enquiries,” Jamie Harley, a spokesman for PwC, said by e-mail.
“We take our independence responsibilities very seriously.”  FRC investigations can result in reprimands, fines and
orders to withdraw licenses, according to the regulator’s
website.  Berkeley, the homebuilder focused on London and southeast
England, declined to comment.  Berkeley fell 1.6 percent to 2,125 pence in  London  at 12:15
p.m. The shares have risen 21 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
