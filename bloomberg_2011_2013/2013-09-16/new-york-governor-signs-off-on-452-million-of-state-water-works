Almost a half-billion dollars in
grants and low-interest loans for infrastructure works to
improve drinking water and sewage plants across  New York  state
have been signed off on by Governor  Andrew Cuomo .  The $452 million that was approved by the board of the New
York State Environmental Facilities Corp. on Sept. 12, most of
it low-cost financing, will help local governments fund water
and wastewater projects, Cuomo said in a statement.  About $350 million in subsidized, short-term loans post-Hurricane Sandy were to be used by the New York City Municipal
Water Finance Authority to support upgrades to the Hunts Point
water-treatment plant and replace the Orchard Beach pump station
in the Bronx. Funding included  Staten Island  and Saratoga and
Rockland counties to the Canadian border for septic-system
replacement loans to Morristown on the St. Lawrence River.  To contact the reporter on this story:
