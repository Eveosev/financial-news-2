Roche Holding AG (ROG) , the world’s
biggest maker of cancer medicines, named  Deutsche Lufthansa AG (LHA) 
Chief Executive Officer Christoph Franz to replace Chairman
Franz Humer next year.  Roche will propose his nomination to the annual shareholder
meeting on March 4, the Basel-based company said today in a
 statement . Franz’s term at Lufthansa expires May 31.  Humer, who led Roche for more than a decade, is credited as
an architect of Roche’s strategy of yoking its diagnostics and
drugs units together to create medicines targeted at individual
patients.  Humer, 67, was CEO when Roche  bought  a 30 percent stake in
U.S. biotechnology company Genentech Inc. in 1999 and helped
oversee the full takeover of the company as chairman in 2009.
The deals netted Roche its top-selling cancer medicines Rituxan
and Herceptin. The latter, a breast cancer drug, was the
company’s first “personalized” tumor treatment, with a
diagnostic test to show which women it is likely to help.  Franz, 53, has been Lufthansa CEO since 2011. He previously
served as CEO of Swiss International Air Lines.  To contact the reporter on this story:
