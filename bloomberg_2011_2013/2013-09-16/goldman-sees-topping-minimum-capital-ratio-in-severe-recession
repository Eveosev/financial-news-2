Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  said it
could survive a global market shock that would send stocks down
almost 40 percent and produce $20 billion in trading losses for
the firm.  Goldman Sachs would maintain a Tier 1 common ratio of at
least 8.9 percent during the shock, above the 5 percent minimum,
the New York-based firm said in a disclosure of its company-run
stress test. The test included the assumption of a
“reputational event” specific to Goldman Sachs that would
reduce its revenue over the nine-quarter length of the exam.  The biggest U.S. banks must conduct so-called mid-cycle
stress tests using their own scenarios and disclose a summary of
the results. Goldman Sach’s performance in its own test topped
that in the Federal Reserve’s version in March, in which it had
a minimum Tier 1 common ratio of 5.8 percent. The Fed’s test had
different assumptions and covered a different time period.  Goldman Sachs projected it would have a $6.2 billion net
loss over the nine quarters from April 2013 to June 2015 in a
“severely adverse scenario.” The bank would have $15.5 billion
of pre-provision net revenue in the period, overwhelmed by $20
billion in trading and counterparty losses, $1.1 billion in
other losses and a $600 million provision for loan losses.  To contact the reporter on this story:
