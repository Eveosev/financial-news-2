Mosaic Co. (MOS) ,  North America ’s second-largest fertilizer producer, cut its quarterly forecast for
potash and phosphate sales and prices because crop-nutrient
markets have “softened.”  Potash sales volumes in the third quarter will be 1.45
million to 1.65 million metric tons, down from a previous
forecast on July 16 of 1.8 million to 2.1 million tons,
Plymouth, Minnesota-based Mosaic said today in a statement.
Prices will be in the range of $330 to $340 per ton, compared
with the $330 to $360 a ton originally forecast, according to
the statement.  Global fertilizer markets have softened, in part, because
of fertilizer distributors’ cautiousness related to the break up
of Belarusian Potash Co., Mosaic said in the statement.  “Dealers are cautious and are deferring purchases,” Jim Prokopanko, Mosaic’s chief executive officer, said in the
statement.  In phosphates, Mosaic lowered its third-quarter sales
forecast to 2.6 million to 2.8 million tons from 2.9 million to
3.3 million tons. The company also narrowed its phosphate price
forecast to $430 to $440 per ton, from $430 to $465 in July.  On July 30,  OAO Uralkali (URKA) , the world’s largest potash
producer, quit Belarusian Potash, the largest trader of the crop
nutrient, because of a dispute with its partner Belaruskali.  To contact the reporter on this story:
