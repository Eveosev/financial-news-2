Essent Group Ltd., the mortgage
insurer backed by investors including Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
and  George Soros , filed to raise $287.5 million in an initial
public offering as investors pour capital into companies that
guaranty home loans.  Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Barclays Plc are
managing the offering, Bermuda-based Essent said today in a
regulatory filing. The offering size is a placeholder amount used
to calculate registration fees and may change.  Mortgages insurers  MGIC Investment Corp. (MTG)  and Radian Group
Inc., which are recovering from years of losses, have sold stock
and notes to investors including hedge fund manager John Paulson
who has been betting on the recovery of the U.S. housing market.
The guarantors cover losses when homeowners default and
foreclosures fail to recoup costs.  Proceeds from the offering may be used for “capital
contributions to support the growth of our insurance
subsidiaries,” Essent said in the filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
