The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX) 
will climb 12 percent to 1,900 by the end of next year as
valuations rise and investors pour money into mutual funds,
according to Citigroup Inc.  Tobias Levkovich, the firm’s chief U.S. equity strategist,
said he favors shares of larger companies over smaller ones
because foreigners will boost U.S. holdings and may prefer to
buy well-known stocks.  Computer makers , health-care providers
and consumer discretionary stocks will outperform, he said.  “There is plenty of dry powder to push share prices higher
as confidence returns,” Levkovich said in a Sept. 13 note. “A
shift toward  growth stocks  seems appropriate along with large-cap names especially if foreign money moves into U.S. markets.”  American equities have soared in 2013, sending the  S&P 500 
to a record, as companies increased  profits  for a fifth
consecutive year and the  Federal Reserve  maintained economic
stimulus. The U.S. equity benchmark is near the average
strategist forecast, which calls for the index to finish 2013 at
1,694, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Levkovich is more bullish than the average Wall Street
equity strategist. A Bloomberg survey of seven forecasters shows
the S&P 500 will end 2014 at 1,836. The estimates range from
1,955 to 1,650 for next year.  Citigroup in New York predicts the  Dow Jones Industrial
Average (INDU)  will rise 11 percent to 17,100 by the end of 2014 from
yesterday’s close. The projections are calculated using a
combination of nine methods, including valuation,  consumer
confidence , currency measures and earnings, he said.  Stocks Jump  Equities rallied today after  Lawrence Summers  withdrew his
bid to be the next Federal Reserve chairman and America and
Russia agreed on a plan to remove Syria’s chemical weapons. The
S&P 500 added 0.8 percent to 1,702.2 at 10:42 a.m. in New York.  Stock prices are being pushed higher by investors adding
cash to mutual funds and exchange-traded funds, at the same time
that companies repurchase more shares, Levkovich said.  Mutual funds have received about $13 billion this year, a
reversal from last year when more than $150 billion was
withdrawn, according to data from the Washington-based
 Investment Company Institute . Authorized U.S. buybacks have
reached a six-year high of more than $500 billion this year,
data from Birinyi Associates Inc. show.  The debate among U.S. lawmakers about whether to raise the
debt ceiling and the start of the central bank’s plan to reduce
stimulus measures may restrain the stock market in the next few
months, Levkovich said. The Fed will probably taper its monthly
bond-buying program by $10 billion to $75 billion this week, a
Bloomberg survey of economists showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
