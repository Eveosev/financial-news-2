The cost of hauling iron ore and
coal along  China ’s coast rose to a 16-month high, adding to
signs the nation’s demand is strengthening for the two
commodities that generate the most demand for dry-bulk shipping.  The China Coastal Bulk Freight Index, a measure of
commodity transporting rates between the nation’s ports,
advanced to 1,141.17 points on Sept. 13, a seventh weekly gain,
according to data from the Shanghai Shipping Exchange. The
measure has advanced 8.2 percent since the start of the year.  The increase is a sign of rising demand from China because
coastal ships transport both domestic and imported cargoes to
smaller Chinese ports from the nation’s bigger facilities,
according to Pareto Securities AS, an Oslo-based investment
bank. Imports of coal and iron ore are on course for a record
this year, according to  Clarkson Plc (CKN) , the largest shipbroker.
Rates for Capesize ships delivering both rose almost sixfold to
$30,020 since the start of June, Baltic Exchange data show.  “It is a clear sign of high domestic demand,” Eirik Haavaldsen, a shipping analyst at Pareto, said by e-mail today.
“This results in stockpiles being quickly emptied, and a
continued need for further international imports, thus
increasing demand for international vessels.”  Chinese stockpiles of rebar, the steel used to reinforce
concrete, dropped to 6.25 million metric tons in the week ended
Sept. 13, from 10.2 million tons in March, according to Shanghai
Steelhome Information, a government-backed research company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
