Qualitas Equity Partners SA, the
private-equity owner of Spain’s Grupo Garnica Plywood SA, has
appointed advisers for a possible sale of the firm, three people
with knowledge of the matter said.  Qualitas, a Madrid-based buyout firm founded in 2003, has
picked  Lazard Ltd. (LAZ)  for a possible sale of the plywood
manufacturer, said the people, who asked not to be identified
because the talks are private. The unit is valued at as much as
250 million euros ($332 million), they said.  Grupo Garnica, which was backed by Qualitas in a management
buyout in 2006, exports more than 75 percent of its plywood
production to markets outside its home base including Germany,
 France , Portugal,  Italy  and the U.K., according to the buyout
firm’s website. The company, with earnings before interest, tax
and amortization of more than 20 million euros last year, is
attracting interest from both private-equity firms and industry
buyers, the people said.  A spokeswoman for Lazard, based in  London , declined to
comment, while a spokesman for Grupo Garnica did not respond to
e-mailed requests seeking comment. Officials at Qualitas in
 Madrid  declined to comment.  Private-equity firms typically pool money from pension
plans and endowments with a mandate to buy companies within five
to six years, then sell them and return the money and a profit
after 10 years. The firms usually charge a management fee of as
much as 2 percent and keep 20 percent of the profits from
investments.  To contact the reporter on this story:
