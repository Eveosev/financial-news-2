Gold fell in London for the second
time in three sessions after Russia and the U.S. approved a plan
to destroy Syria’s chemical weapons, diminishing demand for
haven assets.  U.S. Secretary of State  John Kerry  and Russian Foreign
Minister  Sergei Lavrov  agreed Sept. 14 in Geneva on a framework
for finding and destroying Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s
stockpiles of poison gas. Gold demand in India and China is also
“quiet,” said Bernard Sin, the head of currency and metal
trading at bullion refiner MKS (Switzerland) SA in Geneva.  “The fears about an air strike are fast diminishing,”
Chris Gaffney, the senior market Strategist at EverBank Wealth
Management, said in a telephone interview from  St. Louis .
“Also, we are not seeing any support come in from physical
demand at current prices.”  Gold for immediate delivery declined 0.6 percent to
$1,318.49 an ounce at 6:54 p.m. in London. Last week, prices
tumbled 4.7 percent, the most since June 28, when the precious
metal dropped to $1,180.50, the lowest since August 2010.  Futures for December delivery rose 0.7 percent to settle at
$1,317.80 on the Comex in  New York . Prices climbed as much as
2.1 percent after former Treasury Secretary  Lawrence Summers 
withdrew from the list of candidates President  Barack Obama  is
considering to be the next Federal Reserve chairman, reducing
expectations for an early end to the central bank’s stimulus
measures.  Spot bullion has dropped 21 percent this year as investors
lost faith in the precious metal as a store of value amid an
equity rally and concern that the Fed may slow the pace of its
$85 billion monthly bond-purchase program. The central bank
begins a two-day meeting tomorrow.  Silver for immediate delivery fell 0.9 percent to $22.0208
an ounce in London, declining for the second time in three
sessions. Prices retreated 6.9 percent last week.  Spot platinum slipped 0.9 percent to $1,440.02 an ounce,
while palladium rose 0.5 percent to $703.95 an ounce, the second
straight advance.  To contact the reporters on this story:
