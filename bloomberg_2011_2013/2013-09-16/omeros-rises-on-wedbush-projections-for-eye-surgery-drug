Omeros Corp. (OMER)  climbed the most in
almost four years after an analyst raised an estimate for
potential use of the company’s drug used during eye surgeries.  Omeros rose 55 percent to $7.89 at 11:58 a.m., after
gaining as much as 64 percent in the largest intraday increase
since October 2009. The Seattle-based company fell 47 percent in
the 12 months before today.  The medicine, OMS302 is being developed for use during
ophthalmological procedures, including cataract surgery. The
 Food and Drug Administration  is cracking down on the sterility
of topical solutions used during intraocular lens replacement
surgery and OMS302 would be the only product combining pain
relief and pupil dilation that meet new requirements, Liana Moussatos, an analyst with Wedbush Securities in  Los Angeles ,
wrote in a note today to clients.  The prediction that “doubled our penetration estimate”
was based on “a conversation with a leading, high-volume
cataract surgeon,” said Moussatos, who recommends Omeros stock.  The FDA may decide whether to approve OMS302 by the middle
of next year.  The FDA is no longer allowing “homebrews” of the topical
solutions used in eye surgery after pharmacies that make their
own drugs recently encountered sterility issues. The agency also
requires each patient receive a separate bottle of topical
agents rather than surgeons using one bottle throughout a day of
surgery as was typical practice, Moussatos said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
