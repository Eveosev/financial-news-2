Germany ’s anti-euro AfD party took
its opposition to the single currency to new levels today as
members burned fake 500-euro ($669) notes in central Berlin.  Chancellor Angela Merkel’s coalition policy of bailing out
weaker euro states during the debt crisis that spread from
Greece is “the greatest waste of money since the inflation of
1923,” Bernd Lucke, the AfD’s leader, told a small crowd of
onlookers at the Brandenburg Gate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
