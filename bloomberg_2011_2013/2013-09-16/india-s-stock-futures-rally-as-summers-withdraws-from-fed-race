Indian stock-index futures climbed
as  Lawrence Summers  withdrew from the U.S. Federal Reserve
chairman race.  SGX CNX Nifty Index futures  for September delivery rose 1.6
percent to 5,968 at 10:23 a.m. in Singapore. The underlying CNX
 Nifty (NIFTY)  Index on the National Stock Exchange of India Ltd. was
little changed at 5,850.60 on Sept. 13. The S&P BSE Sensex fell
0.3 percent to 19,732.76. The gauge rose 2.4 percent last week.
The Bank of  New York  Mellon India ADR Index of U.S.-traded
shares rose 0.1 percent to 990.55.  Summers withdrew from contention before a two-day meeting
starting tomorrow, at which the central bank is forecast to
begin paring unprecedented bond purchases. Summers would tighten
policy more than  Janet Yellen , who was his main rival to replace
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke , according to a Bloomberg Global Poll
of investors, analysts and traders last week.  Reserve Bank  of
India Governor Raghuram Rajan will make his first interest-rate
decision Sept. 20.  “The policy decision by the Fed and its guidance, if any,
on tapering of the quantitative easing measures will be closely
watched,” Dipen Shah, head of private client group research at
Kotak Securities Ltd., said by e-mail on Sept. 13. “The first
meeting of the RBI under the new governor will also be an
important trigger for the market, especially the decision on
 interest rates .”  The rupee rallied 2.8 percent to 63.4950 per dollar last
week, according to prices from local banks compiled by
Bloomberg, after U.S. jobs data tempered speculation the Fed
will cut stimulus that’s buoyed emerging markets.  Price Data  Wholesale-price inflation probably rose 5.70 percent in
August, compared with 5.79 percent in July, according to the
median estimate of 25 economists in a Bloomberg survey, before
data due today.  Indian (SENSEX)  Oil Corp., the nation’s biggest refiner, may be
active after it increased gasoline prices by 1.63 rupees a
liter, the company said in an e-mailed statement on Sept. 13.  The RBI began tightening monetary policy in July to slow
depreciation in the currency. India’s central bank raised two
interest rates on July 15 and restricted lenders’ access to
cash. Policy makers also tightened limits on overseas
investments by local companies and curbed gold imports.  The rupee sank to an all-time low 68.845 per dollar on Aug.
28, hurt by the possibility of reduced U.S. monetary stimulus
and a current-account deficit that reached a record during the
last fiscal year.  The Sensex has increased 1.6 percent this year in local
currency terms and is  valued  at 13.9 times projected 12-month
earnings, compared with the five-year average of 14.1 times,
data compiled by Bloomberg show. It has lost 12 percent this
year in dollar terms.  Overseas investors  bought a net $150 million of domestic
shares on Sept. 12, data from the regulator show. That boosted
this year’s net inflow to $12.4 billion, the second-highest
among 10 Asian markets tracked by Bloomberg. Foreigners pulled
$3.7 billion from local equities in the three months to Aug. 31
as capital fled  emerging markets .  To contact the reporters on this story:
