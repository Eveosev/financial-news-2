Assa Corp., the part-owner of a 36-story Manhattan office building, acted as a front for  Iran  in
violating the U.S. embargo against that country and federal
money-laundering laws, a judge said in the government’s suit to
seize Assa’s property.  U.S. District Judge Katherine Forrest in Manhattan today
ruled against Assa before trial, saying that the company acted
as a front for Bank Melli, Iran’s national bank.  “The court has found that, based on the incontrovertible
record evidence, Assa was (and is) a front for Bank Melli, and
thus a front for the government of Iran,” Forrest said.  The U.S. sued Assa, based in the U.K.’s Channel Islands,
and the Alavi Foundation, a successor to a foundation set up by
Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi, who was overthrown as Iran’s leader
in 1979. The  Manhattan  office building was constructed by the
Pahlavi Foundation, a nonprofit group set up by the Shah.  Peter Livingston, a lawyer for Assa, didn’t immediately
return a voice-mail message seeking comment on the ruling.  The case is In re 650 Fifth Avenue and Related Properties,
08-cv-10934, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
