Mervyn King , the former Bank of
England governor who retired June 30, will join the Council on
Foreign Relations as a “distinguished visiting fellow,” the
New York-based group said today.  “Governor King strengthens our ability to assess financial
balance and practical problems,” Richard Haass, the Council’s
president, said in a statement. “We are excited and honored to
have someone of Mervyn King’s experience and stature.”  King, 65, is the second former central banker to have been
named a visiting fellow this month, according to the Council. He
follows  Stanley Fischer , who was governor of Israel’s central
bank from 2005 until June this year.  Before taking the helm of the Bank of England a decade ago,
King served as its chief economist and as deputy governor. He
was succeeded by  Mark Carney , the former Bank of Canada
governor.  The Council on Foreign Relations describes itself as a
nonpartisan organization that researches foreign policy issues.  To contact the reporter on this story:
