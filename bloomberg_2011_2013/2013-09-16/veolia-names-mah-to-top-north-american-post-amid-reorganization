Veolia Environnement SA (VIE)  named
former water solutions chief operating officer Terry Mah as
president of its North American businesses in a reorganization
in which Laurent Auguste leaves  Chicago  to lead the Paris-based
water company’s new Innovations and Markets department.  The management change came amid a reshaping of Europe’s
largest water company into nine geographically based businesses
mixing waste, water and energy operations, Paris-based Veolia
said today in a statement.  Veolia shares gained 2.5 percent to 13.185 euros in Paris
trading. That increased their advance the past year to 40
percent as CEO Antoine Frerot restructures Veolia and disposes
of units compared with a 34 percent gain by French water and
waste rival Suez Environnement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
