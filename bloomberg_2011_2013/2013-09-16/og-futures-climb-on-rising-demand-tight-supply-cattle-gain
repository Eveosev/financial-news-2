Hog futures headed for the biggest
gain in more than a week on signs of climbing demand for U.S.
pork amid limited supplies. Cattle prices also rose.  Wholesale  pork  added 2.8 percent last week to 98.16 cents a
pound, the biggest gain since Aug. 2, government data show. Spot
 hogs  rose to 93.71 cents a pound on Sept. 13, the highest in
almost four weeks, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said.
Meatpackers processed an estimated 2.172 million hogs in the
week through Sept. 14, down 11 percent from a year earlier, the
USDA estimates.  “Demand is still good,” Lawrence Kane, a senior market
adviser at Stewart-Peterson Group, said in a telephone interview
from Yates City,  Illinois . “Hog numbers haven’t broken higher
like everyone expects in the fall.”  Hog futures for December settlement climbed 0.8 percent to
87.95 cents a pound at 10:13 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange. A close at that level would be the biggest gain for a
most-active contract since Sept. 6.  Cattle futures for December delivery rose 0.1 percent to
$1.2925 a pound. The contract was down 4.9 percent this year
through Sept. 13.  Feeder-cattle futures for October settlement advanced 0.3
percent to $1.59725 a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
