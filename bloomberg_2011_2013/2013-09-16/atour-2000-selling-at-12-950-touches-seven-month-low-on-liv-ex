Five cases of 2000  Chateau Latour ,
a Bordeaux first-growth wine estate, sold for 8,160 pounds
($12,950) each on the Liv-ex market in London last week, taking
the vintage to its lowest level in seven months.  The transaction on Sept. 13 was 4 percent down from this
year’s high of 8,500 pounds reached in February and 28 percent
below the 11,275 pound record it reached in July 2011, when
demand for top Bordeaux was peaking.  The Liv-ex Fine Wine 50 Index, a benchmark for top Bordeaux
wines, has slipped 1 percent since the end of June, extending a
2 percent decline in the second quarter, after gaining 7 percent
in the first three months of the year. A muted investor response
to the Bordeaux 2012 sales campaign this year has also sapped
appetite for older vintages since April.  “Bordeaux was out of the spotlight” over the past month
as investors turned their attention to other regions, Liv-ex
said in a blog comment on the market trend.  The 2000 Latour ranks as the estate’s third-highest-priced
wine of the past 15 years, lagging only those from 2010 and
2009, according to merchant prices collated by  Liv-ex  on its
Cellar Watch website. Last week’s price was still more than
triple the 2,520 pounds a case for which it sold in August 2003
as it began trading on the exchange.  It was rated 98 on a 100-point scale by U.S. critic  Robert Parker  in a June 2010 online tasting note, making it the fourth-highest ranked vintage of the past 15 years.  Chateau Latour, with 78 hectares (193 acres) of vineyards,
traces its wine-growing history back to at least the 16th
century and has been owned since 1993 by French billionaire
 Francois Pinault , according to its  website .  Pauillac Estate  It was one of the first Bordeaux wine estates to install
stainless-steel tanks in its winery in the 1960s and fully
renovated them in 2001. Last year it set another precedent by
announcing it intended to no longer sell wine through the
Bordeaux futures system, instead reserving it for sale closer to
the time when it becomes ready to drink.  Latour is one of the five first-growth wine estates on the
left bank of the Gironde estuary and one of three in the
Pauillac district, along with Chateau Lafite-Rothschild and
Chateau Mouton-Rothschild. The classification was drawn up for
Napoleon III’s 1855 Paris Exhibition, and remains in force, with
Mouton joining the rank of first-growth in 1973.  To contact the reporter on this story:
