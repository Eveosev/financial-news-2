Jerrold Holdings Ltd., the U.K.
mortgage provider owned by Equistone Partners Europe Ltd., is
seeking to raise 200 million pounds ($319 million) of high-yield
bonds to replace bank loans.  The five-year senior-secured notes will help repay a 245
million-pound credit facility, according to a person familiar
with the offering, who asked not to be identified because terms
aren’t set  Standard & Poor’s assigned a B+ rating to the proposed
debt, the ratings firm said in a report. The ranking is four
levels below investment grade and reflects Jerrold’s
“relatively narrow profile as a specialist U.K. secured lender
with a focus on U.K. residential property, including second
charge mortgages and bridging finance,” according to S&P.  The revolving credit facility, a type of debt where money
repaid can be borrowed again, will mature in 2015, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The Cheshire, England-based company
got the loan last year alongside a 395 million-pound
securitization, according to its  website .  Equistone  bought  a minority stake in Jerrold in 2006 for
113.5 million pounds, the private-equity company says on its
 website . Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc, Jefferies Group LLC,
and Lloyds Banking Group Plc are managing the bond sale, people
with knowledge of the deal said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
