Morgan Stanley (MS)  said internal stress
tests show the firm can weather a severe economic crisis with a
profit while it sustains $7 billion in trading and counterparty
losses.  Morgan Stanley would maintain a Tier 1 common capital ratio
of at least 9.5 percent during a hypothetical shock scenario,
above the 5 percent minimum, the New York-based firm said in a
 summary  of its company-run test. It assumed the Standard &
Poorâ€™s 500 Index would drop 41 percent while the U.S. and euro-zone economies shrink 5 percent within the first year.  The company estimated it would generate a total pretax
profit of $600 million from the second quarter of 2013 through
the middle of 2015, while suffering $1.5 billion in loan losses.  The biggest U.S. banks must run their own tests on how they
would fare during a crisis to supplement those conducted by the
 Federal Reserve  six months earlier. The central bank reports
results each March based on different economic assumptions. The
most recent round showed 17 of the 18 largest firms surviving a
deep recession.  To contact the reporter on this story:
