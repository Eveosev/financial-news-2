Crude from the Bakken shale
formation weakened to its lowest level in 10 months against
domestic benchmark West Texas Intermediate after a  North Dakota 
regulator reported a boost in production.  Bakken’s discount to WTI widened $1.50 to $6.50 a barrel at
1:57 p.m.  New York  time, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It was the lowest level since Nov. 13.  Production in North Dakota rose 6.4 percent after well
completions more than doubled from June to July, Lynn Helms,
head of the state Mineral Resources Department, said Sept. 13.  “The production numbers are almost startling,” Helms
said. “We anticipate a big month in August as well.”  Crudes produced on the  Gulf Coast  also fell after
maintenance began at Exxon Mobil Corp.’s Baton Rouge refinery,
the fourth-largest in the U.S., reducing demand in the region.  Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium to WTI declined 35 cents to
$1.20 a barrel. Heavy Louisiana Sweet slipped 55 cents to $1.30
a barrel over WTI.  Mars Blend dropped 45 cents to a discount of $3.45 a
barrel, while Poseidon fell 60 cents to a $4.20 discount. Bonito
Sour weakened 60 cents to $1.25 a barrel below WTI.  Southern Green Canyon’s discount grew by 60 cents to $6.35
a barrel. The discount for  Thunder Horse  increased 60 cents to
$1.25. Eugene Island crude’s discount fell 55 cents to $1.25 a
barrel against WTI.  To contact the reporter on this story:
