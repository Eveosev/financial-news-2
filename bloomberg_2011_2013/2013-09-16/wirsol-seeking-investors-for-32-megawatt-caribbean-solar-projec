Wirsol Solar AG, the German
renewable-energy developer, expects to find investors for a 32-megawatt power project in the  Dominican Republic  by November.  The company is in talks with private investors and solar-panel suppliers to fund the facility and expects to have it
connected to the grid by the first quarter of next year,
Nikolaus Krane, a Wirsol director, said today in a telephone
interview.  Wirsol, based in Waghausel-Kirrlach, Germany, has installed
200 kilowatts of panels at the site in Monte Plata province and
cleared land for the rest of the panels, he said. The company
agreed last year to sell the plantâ€™s energy to state-power
 utility Corp. (UTC/C)  Dominicana De Empresas Electricas Estatales.  To contact the reporter on this story:
