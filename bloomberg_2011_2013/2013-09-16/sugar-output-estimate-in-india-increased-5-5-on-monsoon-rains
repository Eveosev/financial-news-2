Sugar production in  India , the
world’s second-biggest grower, will be 5.5 percent more than
estimated in July as the best monsoon rainfall in almost two
decades boosts yields, a millers’ group said.  The harvest will total 25 million metric tons in the season
starting Oct. 1, compared with 23.7 million tons predicted in
July, the  Indian Sugar Mills Association  said in an e-mailed
statement today. That’s more than the 24.5 million tons forecast
by the  National Federation of Cooperative Sugar Factories Ltd. 
last week. Output is estimated at 25.1 million tons this year.  A bigger harvest may increase the surplus available for
exports from India and add to a global glut. Futures in  New York 
are headed for a third-year of losses, the longest slump since
1992, as the world market is poised for a fourth year of surplus
in 2013-2014. Prices have fallen 10 percent this year.  “India must export to save on interest costs on carrying
sugar,” Rahil Shaikh, managing director of ED&F Man Commodities
India Pvt., said in an interview in  New Delhi  today. “India has
to make more raws to gain export markets,” said Shaikh, who
estimates shipments to total between 2 million tons to 3 million
tons in 2013-2014.  Stockpiles will surge to 10 million tons by the end of
2013-2014 from 8.7 million tons at the end of this season if the
nation fails to export any sugar, according to the mills
association. Demand will total 23.5 million tons next year, the
group estimates.  The area under cane planting will be 5.29 million hectares
this season, 9 percent more than the 4.85 million initial
estimate of the  Agriculture Ministry , the association said.
Increased planting and prospects for higher yields will expand
output, it said.  Monsoon rainfall in the three months through August was the
highest since 1994, data from the  India Meteorological
Department  showed. Parts of Maharashtra and Karnataka have got
above-average rainfall this year after facing drought because in
the past two years. The two states together account for 45
percent of the country’s sugar output.  To contact the reporters on this story:
