Implementing smart-water
efficiencies in  emerging markets  such as India may save as much
as $12.3 billion annually in losses from leaks and theft and
help curb scarcity issues, according to a study.  Brazil and Saudi Arabia were also among 72 countries that
cumulatively can achieve the savings if able to use smart
meters, networks, irrigation and software analytics that
optimize water use, the Washington-based infrastructure
researcher  Northeast Group LLC  said today in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
