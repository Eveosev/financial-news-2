The Canadian dollar increased to
its strongest level in a month amid speculation the U.S. Federal
Reserve won’t put an early end to its expansionary monetary
policy, boosting riskier assets.  The loonie, as the currency is nicknamed for the image of
the aquatic bird on the C$1 coin, rose the most in more than a
week versus the greenback as the exit of former U.S. Treasury
Secretary Lawrence Summers from the race to lead the Fed damped
bets monetary easing will conclude sooner than expected. The Fed
begins a two-day meeting tomorrow during which policy makers may
decide to slow asset buying. Government-bond yields declined the
most in a week.  “The foreign-exchange market today has been shaped by the
announcement that Larry Summers withdrew his candidacy,” David Doyle, a Toronto-based strategist at Macquarie Capital Markets,
said in a telephone interview. “That’s been broadly interpreted
as signaling that U.S. monetary policy over the coming five
years is likely to be less hawkish and more accommodative, which
is causing Canadian dollar strength.”  Canada ’s currency appreciated 0.3 percent to C$1.0324 per
U.S. dollar at 5 p.m. in New York after earlier touching
C$1.0283, the strongest level since Aug. 12. One Canadian dollar
purchases 96.88 U.S. cents.  Oil, Canada’s biggest export, slid 1.9 percent to $106.16 a
barrel in New York.  Bond Reversal  Benchmark 10-year government  bonds  fell after rising
earlier, pushing the yield on the security up two basis points,
or 0.02 percentage point, to 2.78 percent. It dropped as low as
2.69 percent. The price of the 1.5 percent debt due in June 2023
dropped 12 cents to C$89.23.  Foreign investors bought Canadian securities in July,
returning to bonds after a record divestment the previous month,
government figures showed. Purchases totaled C$6.09 billion
($5.91 billion) in July following June’s net sale of C$15.4
billion, Statistics Canada said in Ottawa.  “Canadian dollar-positive flows from both reserve managers
and investors helped to support CAD in 2011 and 2012,”  Camilla Sutton , head of currency strategy at  Bank of Nova Scotia (BNS) , wrote
today in a client note. “However, these have subsided in 2013
taking away an important driver of CAD strength.”  The loonie gained before a report tomorrow that may show
Canadian  factory sales  increased 0.5 percent in July, after
unexpectedly falling in June for the third time in four months,
according to the median  estimate  of a Bloomberg survey.  ‘Oversold’ Greenback  The U.S. dollar is “oversold and poised to reverse”
versus the loonie,  Shaun Osborne , chief currency strategist at
Toronto-Dominion Bank, wrote today in a client note. The
Canadian dollar will bounce off C$1.0275 per dollar and weaken
to at least the zone from C$1.0335 to C$1.04, he said.  Implied volatility for one-year options on the Canadian
dollar versus its U.S. counterpart was at 7.18 percent today,
the lowest since July 25. Implied volatility is used to set
option prices and gauge the expected pace of currency swings.
The average for this year is 7.41 percent.  Futures traders decreased their  bets  the Canadian dollar
will fall against its U.S. peer for the first time in four
weeks, figures from the Washington-based Commodity Futures
Trading Commission showed on Sept. 13. The difference in the
number of wagers by hedge funds and other large speculators on a
decline in the loonie versus those on a gain -- so-called net
shorts -- was 30,942 on Sept. 10, compared with 34,639 a week
earlier.  Risk Reversals  The three-month so-called 25-delta risk-reversal rate,
which measures the premium charged for the right to buy the U.S.
dollar against its Canadian counterpart versus contracts to
sell, rose to 1.34 percent, the highest in almost two weeks. The
measure rose to 1.64 percent on Aug. 23, the highest level on a
closing basis since July 2. The 2013 average is 1.26 percent.  Trading in over-the-counter options for the U.S. dollar-Canadian dollar pair amounted to $775 million, making up 5.3
percent of the $15 billion daily total. Greenback-loonie trading
was 70 percent more than the average for the past five Mondays
at a similar time in the day, according to Bloomberg analysis.  The loonie fell 2.6 percent in the past year against nine
other developed-nation currencies tracked by the Bloomberg
Correlation-Weighted Index, making it the third-worst performer.
The yen lost 20 percent, and the Australian dollar slipped 8.9
percent. The U.S. dollar rose 3.8 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
