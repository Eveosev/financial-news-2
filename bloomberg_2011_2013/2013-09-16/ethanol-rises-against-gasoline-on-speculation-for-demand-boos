Ethanol rose against gasoline on
speculation that a 25 percent price drop this month will lift
demand for the biofuel.  The spread, or price difference, narrowed 6.2 cents to
93.36 cents a gallon, tightening from the widest level since
September 2012, as futures rebounded from a three-year low and
as gasoline slumped on signs the U.S. won’t strike  Syria .  “It has been beat up enough that you’ll probably get a
bump here,” said Mike Blackford, a consultant at Intl FCStone
in  Des Moines ,  Iowa .  Denatured ethanol for October delivery rose 0.9 cents, or
0.5 percent, to $1.783 a gallon on the  Chicago  Board of Trade,
climbing from the lowest level since August 2010. Futures have
dropped 19 percent this year.  Gasoline for October delivery sank 5.3 cents, or 1.9
percent, to $2.7166 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The contract covers reformulated gasoline, made to be
blended with ethanol before delivery to filling stations.  Blackford said ethanol’s discount to the motor fuel gives
incentive for blenders to use as much of the additive as they
can to capture the price difference.  Ethanol is made primarily from corn in the U.S. The harvest
is usually from September to November.  Corn for December delivery fell 0.5 percent to $4.565 a
bushel in Chicago. The December crush spread of corn to ethanol
was minus 5 cents a gallon.  Increased supply of the grain will help lift output of the
fuel, Blackford said.  Fuel Production  Ethanol  production  in the week ended Sept. 6 rose 3.5
percent to 848,000 barrels a day, 12 percent lower than the
record 963,000 barrels a day in December 2011, data from the
Energy Information Administration show.  Stockpiles were at 16.3 million barrels, down 14 percent
from a year earlier, according to the EIA, the Energy
Department’s analytical arm. Imports tumbled 59 percent to
15,000 barrels a day.  Tracking certificates called Renewable Identification
Numbers, or RINs, are attached to each gallon of biofuel to help
the U.S. and refiners track compliance with federal consumption
targets.  Corn-based ethanol RINs  fell 3 cents to 57 cents, while
 advanced RINs , which cover biodiesel and Brazilian sugarcane-based ethanol, dropped 4 cents to 65 cents, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. The prices are the lowest since February.  In cash market trading, ethanol plunged 58 cents to $2.12 a
gallon on the  Gulf Coast , 49.5 cents to $2.125 on the West
Coast, 48.5 cents to $2.10 in  New York  and 27.5 cents to $2.035
in Chicago, data compiled by Bloomberg showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
