Brazil  economists raised their 2013
growth forecast for the third straight week while cutting next
year’s estimate for the fourth consecutive time, as growth in
the world’s second-largest economy struggles to gain traction.  Brazil’s gross domestic product will expand 2.40 percent
this year, compared with the previous week’s forecast of 2.35
percent, according to the Sept. 13 central bank survey of about
100 analysts published today. Growth will slow to 2.22 percent
next year, down from last week’s estimate of 2.28 percent.  President Dilma Rousseff’s administration is working to
overcome headwinds as officials seek to spur expansion. While
July retail sales and second quarter growth were stronger than
economists’ forecasts, the central bank has lifted interest
rates to fight inflation near the top of the target range.
Brazil’s monetary policy is aimed at limiting the effect of a
weaker real on consumer prices, central bank President Alexandre Tombini told executives on Sept. 12.  Swap rates on the contract due in January 2015, the most
traded in Sao Paulo today, fell 12 basis points, or 0.12
percentage point, to 10.34 percent at 9:03 a.m. local time. The
real strengthened by 0.9 percent to 2.2599 per U.S. dollar and
has declined 4.6 percent in the past three months, the second-most among 16 major currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  Uneven Growth  Recent indicators show that Brazil’s economy has been
growing unevenly. While retail sales in July jumped 1.9 percent,
almost 10 times above economists’ forecast, total economic
activity that month  declined  0.33 percent. Brazil’s gross
domestic product  grew  1.5 percent during the April to June
period, the most since the first quarter of 2010.  The central bank on Aug. 28 raised the benchmark Selic by a
half-percentage point to 9 percent, and has lifted the key rate
by 175 basis points this year, the fastest pace of monetary
tightening of any major world economy tracked by Bloomberg. The
bank considers the current pace of key rate increases to be
appropriate, as a weaker real pressures short-term inflation,
policy makers said in the minutes to their Aug. 27-28 meeting.  Annual inflation measured by the IPCA index  decelerated  in
August to 6.09 percent, the lowest since December, according to
the national statistics agency. Brazil’s central bank targets
annual inflation at 4.5 percent, plus or minus two percentage
points.  Economists in the central bank survey lifted their 12-month
inflation forecast for the 11th straight time, to 6.21 percent
from 6.13 percent last week. Year-end inflation next year will
reach 5.90 percent, up from the previous forecast of 5.85
percent.  Brazil will expand by about 2.7 percent this year,
according to the latest central bank estimate. The country’s
economy grew 0.9 percent last year and 2.7 percent in 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
