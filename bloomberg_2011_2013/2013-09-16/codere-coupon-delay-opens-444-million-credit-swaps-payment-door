Codere SA’s decision to delay a
bond coupon payment by two days opened the door for holders of
$444 million of credit-default swap contracts to ask for
settlement.  The Spanish gaming company said Sept. 13 that it will make
a payment on its $300 million of 9.25 percent bonds tomorrow,
rather than yesterday when it was due. That enables investors to
seek a payout on all outstanding credit-default swaps contracts,
according to the rules of the  International Swaps & Derivatives
Association .  “This will likely be a failure-to-pay  credit event  for the
CDS,” Chris Snow, an analyst at CreditSights Inc., wrote in a
note to investors.  There are total of 3,192 contracts covering a net $444
million of Codere’s debt, Depository Trust & Clearing Corp. data
show. ISDA’s determinations committee hasn’t been asked to make
a ruling, according to the industry group’s  website .  The company’s 9.25 percent bonds due February 2019 dropped
two cents to 49 cents on the euro, according Bloomberg prices at
9:20 a.m. in  London .  To contact the reporter on this story:
