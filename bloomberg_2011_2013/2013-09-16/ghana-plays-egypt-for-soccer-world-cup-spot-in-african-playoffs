Ghana , a quarterfinalist in the
2010 World Cup, must defeat Egypt to reach the 2014 soccer
competition in Brazil.  The teams will contest a two-game playoff in October and
November after being drawn together by  FIFA  and  Confederation of
African Football  officials in Cairo today. In the other four
playoffs,  Ethiopia  plays Nigeria,  Ivory Coast  faces Senegal,
Tunisia takes on Cameroon and  Burkina Faso  meets Algeria.  Ghana, ranked the 24th best national team by  FIFA , the
game’s governing body, narrowly missed a semifinal berth in
2010, losing to Uruguay in a penalty shootout. Egypt, a record
seven-time winner of Africa’s Cup of Nations, hasn’t appeared in
a World Cup since 1990 and never has reached the second round.  Ivory Coast, Africa’s highest-ranked team at No. 19,
appeared in the last two World Cups but went out in the group
stage on both occasions. Its playoff opponent, Senegal, reached
the quarterfinals of the 2002 World Cup, losing to Turkey.  Nigeria is aiming for its fifth World Cup appearance when
it takes on Ethiopia, a team it defeated 2-0 on the way to
winning the Cup of Nations this year.  The first playoff matches will take place Oct. 11-15, with
the second games Nov. 15-19.  To contact the reporter on this story:
