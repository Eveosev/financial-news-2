Taiwan ’s 10-year bond yield fell
the most in two years and the local currency strengthened as
Lawrence Summers withdrew from consideration to be the next
Federal Reserve chairman.  The move by Summers ended speculation his leadership would
lead to a faster exit from monetary stimulus that has fueled
demand for emerging-market assets. Taiwan sold NT$40 billion
($1.3 billion) of 10-year bonds at 1.799 percent on Sept. 14,
the highest yield for the tenor since 2008. The government has
failed to sell all the bonds offered at three auctions this 
year as it sought to cap borrowing costs.  The yield on Taiwan’s 1.75 percent government bonds due
September 2023 dropped seven basis points, the most since
September 2011, to 1.715 percent as of 10:23 a.m. in Taipei,
according to Gretai Securities Market.  “News came this morning that Summers is withdrawing from
Fed chairman, so Treasuries may rebound,” said Sandy Liao, a
fixed-income trader at KGI Securities Co. in Taipei. “The
change in sentiment has caused much volatility, but the Fed’s
policy direction actually hasn’t changed; this is just a short-term recovery.”  The Taiwan dollar gained 0.7 percent, the most since July
9, to NT$29.64 versus the greenback, Taipei Forex Inc. prices
show. The currency erased a 0.4 percent gain in the final half
an hour of trading on Sept. 14 amid suspected intervention. The
central bank has sold the local dollar in the run-up to the
finish on most days since March 2012, according to traders who
asked not to be identified.  One-month non-deliverable forwards rose 0.3 percent to
NT$29.568 per U.S. dollar, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. One-month implied volatility, a gauge of expected
moves in the exchange rate used to price options, rose two basis
points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 4.11 percent.  The  overnight interbank lending rate  was unchanged at 0.388
percent, a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan Interbank
Money Center showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
