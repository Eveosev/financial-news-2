Spot diesel fuel in New York and on
the U.S.  Gulf Coast  strengthened against futures as shipments to
Europe climbed.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel  in New York rose 0.37 cent to 0.13
cent a gallon below futures on the  New York Mercantile Exchange 
at 2 p.m., the strongest differential in nine days.  The same
fuel on the Gulf Coast  slid 0.13 cent to 3 cents under futures,
the smallest discount since Aug. 30.  A record 18 tankers were chartered to carry gasoline,
diesel and jet fuel from the U.S. Gulf to Europe in the week
ended Sept. 13, according to shipbroker Charles R. Weber Co. in
Greenwich, Connecticut. Six fixtures to Europe originated on the
U.S. East Coast, a year-to-date high, the report showed.  “We have noticed a significant increase in exports from
the U.S. Atlantic Coast in addition to constant flow from the
U.S. Gulf,” said Tom Finlon, director of Energy Analytics
Group., a  fund manager  in Jupiter,  Florida .  The spread between diesel in New York and the Gulf Coast
widened 1.55 cents to 4.18 cents a gallon, the most since June
28, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The 3-2-1 crack spread in New York, a rough measure of
refining margins for gasoline and diesel based on Brent oil in
Europe, slipped $3.28 to $8.34 a barrel, the lowest level since
January, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  The same spread on the Gulf Coast, based on West Texas
Intermediate oil in Cushing, Oklahoma, dropped $1.40 to $6.97 a
barrel, a second consecutive decline.  To contact the reporter on this story:
