As many as 560,000 people in the
cities of Kyoto and Osaka were ordered or advised to evacuate as
rains brought by Typhoon Man-Yi caused flooding, Japanese media
reported.  The Katsura river in Kyoto flooded in two areas around 10
a.m. today, forcing tourists at hotels to escape by boats, while
members of Japan’s Self-Defense Forces were dispatched to pile
sandbags, the Asahi newspaper said. Evacuation advisories were
lifted in some areas of Kyoto as of 2:20 p.m. local time today,
according to the city’s website.  Man-Yi, the 18th typhoon this season, was near Kumagaya,
north of Tokyo, as of noon and is headed northwest at about 55
kilometers per hour (34 miles per hour) as of 12:45 p.m., the
 Japan Meteorological Agency  said on its  website . The maximum
wind gust speed was 35 meters a second, it said.  Central Japan Railway Co. (9022)   suspended  operations of more than
80 bullet trains between Tokyo and Osaka as of 1:30 p.m. local
time because of high water levels in a river, the company said
on its website today.  More than 100  domestic flights  in and out of Tokyo’s Haneda
airport operated by  Japan Airlines Co. (9201) , and more than 150
domestic flights to and from the airport by  ANA Holdings Inc. (9202) ,
were canceled today as of 12:57 p.m., according to the airport’s
website.  Tokyo Electric Power Co., operator of the wrecked Fukushima
nuclear-power plant, planned to drain rainwater from a site
where it stores irradiated water in tanks, due to rising levels
caused by the typhoon, it said in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
