Bank of America  Corp., the second-largest U.S. bank, said it could survive a deep U.S. recession
that includes a 21 percent drop in housing prices and an 11.7
percent jobless rate.  The lender would keep its Tier 1 common ratio at 8.4
percent or higher during a hypothetical market shock and
recession, above the 5 percent minimum, Charlotte, North
Carolina-based Bank of America  said  in a disclosure of its
company-run  stress test . The bank said it would suffer loan
losses of $36.8 billion during the nine-quarter period, and a
$26.1 billion net loss.  The biggest U.S. banks must conduct so-called mid-cycle
stress tests using their own scenarios and disclose a summary of
the results. While the tests are submitted to the  Federal
Reserve , they aren’t related to approval of the firms’ capital
action plans that determine dividends and share buybacks.  Bank of America’s performance in its own test topped
results in the Fed’s version in March, which yielded a minimum
Tier 1 common ratio of 6.8 percent. The Fed’s test used
different assumptions and covered a different time period.  Bank of America’s severely adverse scenario included a 60
percent drop in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index. The lender
would have $14.2 billion in loan losses from credit cards, the
most of any category. Domestic first-lien mortgages would have a
loss rate of 2.8 percent during the period, the bank estimated.  To contact the reporter on this story:
