Steel reinforcement-bar futures in
 Shanghai  dropped for a fifth day, slipping to the lowest level
in more than six weeks, on concern that increased production by
 steel mills  will weigh on prices.  Rebar for delivery in January on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange fell as much as 0.4 percent to 3,643 yuan ($595) a
metric ton, the lowest intra-day level since Aug. 1. Futures
traded at 3,644 yuan at 11:30 a.m. local time, down 8.6 percent
this year. The building material lost 1.8 last week.  China ’s crude steel output advanced 1.3 percent in August
as profitability rose, with production jumping to 66.3 million
tons from 65.47 million tons in July, according to the National
Bureau of Statistics.  “The supply-side pressure is weighing on the market
despite the peak consumption season now,” said Ren Xinlei, an
analyst at Luzheng Futures Co. in Jinan. “Rebar is likely to
consolidate around 3,620  yuan  and 3,650 yuan.”  The average  spot  price of rebar fell 0.2 percent to 3,561
yuan a ton on Sept. 13, dropping for a seventh straight day, the
worst such run since June, according to Beijing Antaike
Information Development Co.  Iron ore  for immediate delivery at Tianjin port fell 0.5
percent to $134.50 a dry ton on Sept. 13, according to a  price
index  compiled by The Steel Index Ltd. The steel-making
ingredient reached a five-month high at $142.80 on Aug. 14.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
