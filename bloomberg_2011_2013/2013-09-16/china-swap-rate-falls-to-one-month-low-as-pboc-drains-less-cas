China ’s one-year interest rate
swaps fell to the lowest in more than a month after the central
bank withdrew less cash from the financial system last week.  The People’s Bank of China drained a net 1.1 billion yuan
($180 million) in the week ended Sept. 13, compared with 37
billion yuan in the previous period. It asked lenders to submit
orders for seven-day reverse-repurchase agreements, 28-day
repurchase contracts and 91-day bills today, according to a
trader at a primary dealer required to bid at the auctions.  “The PBOC will probably continue to maintain a neutral to
tight policy,” Li Zhiping and Liu Feng, analysts at Sinolink
Securities Co., wrote in a report yesterday.  The cost of one-year swaps, the fixed payment to receive
the floating seven-day repo rate, fell three basis point, or
0.03 percentage point, to 4.05 percent as of 10:34 a.m. in
 Shanghai . That’s the lowest since Aug. 15.  The  seven-day repo rate , a gauge of funding availability in
the banking system, declined 12 basis points to 3.47 percent, a
weighted average compiled by the National Interbank Funding
Center showed.  The yield on the government’s 4.08 percent bonds due August
2023 fell two basis points to 4.12 percent, according to prices
from the Interbank Funding Center.  China’s outstanding local government debt is between 15
trillion and 18 trillion  yuan  now, the Shanghai Securities News
reported today, citing Yan Yan, executive vice president at
China Chengxin Credit Management Co.
