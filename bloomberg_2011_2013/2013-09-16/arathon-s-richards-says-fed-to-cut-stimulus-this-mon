The  Federal Reserve  will at its
next meeting reduce its unprecedented stimulus to as little as
$60 billion each month, according to  Bruce Richards , chief
executive officer and co-founder of New York-based hedge-fund
firm Marathon Asset Management LP.  The tapering will begin this month with the U.S. central
bank reducing its bond purchases to the annual equivalent of
about $700 billion, Richards said today at the 19th Annual Alpha
Hedge West Conference in San Francisco.  “So the tapering isn’t much,” he said. “But there will
be another tapering and another tapering and another tapering.
And they’ll be done by next summer.”  Seventy-one percent of economists surveyed by  Bloomberg
News  predict the Fed will confirm at a meeting in the next two
days that it will reduce the $85 billion of monthly bond
purchases it has been using to boost the economy. Once the Fed
is done with the tapering it will be ready to raise  interest
rates , which won’t begin until March 2015 at the earliest,
according to Richards.  “Models say between March and October of 2015, when
unemployment goes to 6.5 percent,” he said of the timing for
interest-rate increases. “It’s going to take a while.”  Janet Yellen will be a “shoo-in” for confirmation if she
is nominated as the next chairman of the Federal Reserve,
Richard said.  “She will be very dovish for an extended period of time
and may taper slower” if she decides to move the benchmark for
increasing interest rates to 6 percent joblessness from 6.5
percent, or switch to an inflation peg, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
