(Corrects currency in fourth paragraph.)  The Bank of London & The Middle
East Plc, the largest Islamic bank in  Europe , said it plans to
list on the Nasdaq Dubai stock exchange in October, becoming the
first company to join the bourse in more than four years.  The bank expects to price the shares at $2.57 apiece,
giving it an implied market value of about $503 million, Chief
Financial Officer  Richard Williams  told reporters in Dubai
today. Existing shareholders, most of which are based in  Kuwait ,
will swap their shares for those in a new listed entity, BLME
Holdings, with no new capital being raised, he said.  The last company to list on either of the emirates’ two
stock exchanges was  Drake & Scull International (DSI)  in March 2009.
The bank’s plans come as Dubai’s economy recovers and its stocks
rebound from the global credit crisis. The DFM General Index has
climbed 64 percent this year, more than any of the 50 largest
equity markets, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The bank is “well capitalized” until 2016, with almost
250 million pounds ($398 million) at its disposal, Chief
Executive Officer Humphrey Percy said at the same press
conference.  “If at that time we decide we want to increase our
capital, we think we’ll be well positioned having listed on
Nasdaq Dubai,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
