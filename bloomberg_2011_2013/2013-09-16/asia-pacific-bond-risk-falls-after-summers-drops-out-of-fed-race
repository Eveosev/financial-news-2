The cost of insuring corporate and
sovereign bonds from non-payment in the Asia-Pacific region fell
today after former U.S. Treasury Secretary  Lawrence Summers 
dropped out of contention to head the  Federal Reserve .  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan declined 5 basis points to 135 basis
points as of 8:24 a.m. in  Hong Kong , Australia & New Zealand
Banking Group Ltd. prices show. The measure is poised for its
biggest one-day drop in a week and its lowest close since Sept.
10, according to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index decreased 2 basis points
to 111 as of 9:36 a.m. in Sydney, according to Westpac Banking
Corp. prices. The benchmark is set for its lowest close since
Sept. 11, according to CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos.
and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the private market.  Markets in Japan are closed today for a public holiday.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
