Spot wholesale electricity prices
slumped for a second day from  Washington  to Chicago as air-conditioning use waned amid milder weather.  Power consumption  on the PJM Interconnection LLC grid,
which serves more than 60 million people from Washington to
Chicago, will peak at 93,767 megawatts today, down 4.9 percent
from Sept. 13, according to its website. Demand surged in the
eastern U.S. last week after temperatures soared above 90
degrees Fahrenheit (32 Celsius).  A cold front will sweep across the Northeast and the 13
states making up PJM today, according to WSI Corp. in Andover,
 Massachusetts . The high in Washington today may be 76 degrees, 4
below normal, while Chicago’s reading may 11 lower than average
at 64 degrees, data show from AccuWeather Inc. in  State College ,
Pennsylvania.  Spot prices for PJM’s benchmark Western hub, which includes
deliveries to Washington, fell $2.33, or 7.1 percent, to average
$30.48 a megawatt-hour during the hour ended at 2 p.m. from the
same time on Sept. 13, grid data compiled by Bloomberg showed.  Prices were also lower on northeastern grids amid lower
regional demand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
