Brazil ’s real rose to a seven-week
high on speculation the next U.S. Federal Reserve chairman will
maintain stimulus for a longer period, supporting efforts by the
Latin American nation’s central bank to bolster the currency.  The real climbed 1.1 percent to 2.2543 per U.S. dollar at
9:47 a.m. in Sao Paulo, the strongest since July 25 on a closing
basis. Swap rates on the contract due in January 2015 declined
10 basis points, or 0.10 percentage point, to 10.36 percent.  Brazil’s currency rallied along with most emerging-market
counterparts after  Lawrence Summers  withdrew his candidacy as
Fed chairman. Brazil’s central bank sold $497 million of
foreign-exchange swaps and prepared for a rollover auction to
support the currency.  “The central bank is maintaining a firm hand on the
currency,”  Roberto Padovani , the chief economist at Votorantim
Ctvm, said by phone from Sao Paulo. “Today, the global
environment is risk-on, and that favors foreign inflows coming
back to emerging countries.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
