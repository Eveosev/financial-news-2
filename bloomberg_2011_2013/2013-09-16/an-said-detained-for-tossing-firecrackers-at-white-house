U.S. Secret Service officers
arrested a man outside the White House after he allegedly threw
firecrackers over its fence, a law enforcement official said.  The man was arrested at the scene and no one was injured,
said the official, who wasnâ€™t authorized to speak for the
record. Charges were likely, the official said.  The incident happened as  Washington  was on heightened alert
after a gunman earlier today killed at least 12 people at the
Washington Navy Yard a few miles away from the White House.  To contact the reporter on this story:
