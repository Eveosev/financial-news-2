Sugar fell for a second day in  New
York  on speculation investors who reduced bets on lower prices
will start selling again as the outlook for the next crop
improves in  India , the second-biggest producer. Cocoa rose.  Large and small speculators excluding  index funds  reduced
bearish bets on raw sugar traded in New York by 89 percent in
the week ended Sept. 10, according to U.S. Commodity Futures
Trading Commission  data compiled  by Bloomberg. Indian output
will climb to 25 million metric tons in the 12 months starting
Oct. 1, 5.5 percent above a previous forecast, the Indian Sugar
Mills Association said today, helped by higher monsoon rainfall.  “The bulls would say this proves that the managed funds
have now lost all faith in the bear trend and have calmly
climbed aboard the bullish train which is going to take the
market slowly but inexorably higher,” Robin Shaw, an analyst at
futures and options broker Marex Spectron Group in  London , said
in a report. “The bears would say these funds now have massive
ammunition to short the market again, once it has raised its
head high enough above the parapet.”  Raw sugar for delivery in March slid 0.6 percent to 17.58
cents a pound by 5:54 a.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in New York,
paring last week’s 5.3 percent gain. Refined, or white, sugar
for delivery in December fell 0.8 percent to $488.20 a ton on
NSYE Liffe in London.  Exchange Rates  Large and small speculators excluding index funds were net
short, or betting on lower prices, by 6,906 contracts as of
Sept. 10, CFTC data showed, down from 64,560 contracts a week
earlier. Sugar’s gains were last week mostly “neutralized” by
a stronger Brazilian real, Arnaldo Luiz Correa, a partner at
Archer Consulting in  Sao Paulo , said in a weekly report e-mailed
on Sept. 14.  Brazil  is the world’s biggest sugar producer.  NYSE Liffe will today publish the delivery against the
October white-sugar contract that expired last week. The
delivery will be “massive” at 6,263 lots, according to Marex
Spectron, equating to 313,150 tons. The delivered sweetener will
come from Brazil,  Guatemala , India and  Mexico ,  Naim Beydoun , a
broker at Swiss Sugar Brokers, said in a Sept. 15 report.  Cocoa for delivery in December rose 1.1 percent to $2,629 a
ton in New York after reaching $2,637, the highest since Sept.
17, 2012. Cocoa for the same delivery month gained 0.4 percent
to 1,705 pounds ($2,716) a ton in London.  Arabica coffee for delivery in December added 0.5 percent
to $1.2065 a pound on ICE. Robusta coffee for delivery in
November was unchanged at $1,747 a ton on NYSE Liffe.  To contact the reporter on this story:
