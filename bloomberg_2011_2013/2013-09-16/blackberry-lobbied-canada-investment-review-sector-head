BlackBerry Ltd. lobbied the head of
the Canadian government division that reviews foreign takeovers
and a policy adviser to Prime Minister  Stephen Harper  last
month, lobbying records show.  The company contacted Mitch Davies, assistant deputy
minister in Industry Canada’s investment review sector on Aug.
15, according to a posting in the federal lobbying registry. On
the same day, BlackBerry lobbied Phil Harwood, a policy advisor
in Harper’s office, and James Nicholson, director of policy for
Industry Minister  James Moore , according to the registry.  BlackBerry this month changed its lobbying registration to
add the Investment Canada Act, the nation’s foreign-takeover
law, as a subject of interest.  To contact the reporter on this story:
