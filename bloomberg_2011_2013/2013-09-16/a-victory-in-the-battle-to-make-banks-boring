If you like your banks boring, well capitalized and also contributing to the real economy, you will be cheered by  yesterday's quarterly review  from the Bank for International Settlements, which contains a  special feature  on "How have banks adjusted to higher capital requirements?" That's a much-discussed question with at least two possible bad answers. The  banks  argue against higher capital requirements by saying it would force them to cut back on lending.  I  wonder whether higher (risk-weighted) capital requirements will lead banks to just  monkey with the models  for their risk-weighted assets. But the BIS's answer is pretty solidly the good answer: Banks have increased capital ratios by retaining more earnings, without cutting back on lending or monkeying too much with the models:  Go team. But the retained earning comes more from retaining -- banks paid out 27 percent of their income as dividends in 2010-2012, versus almost 40 percent in 2005-2007 -- than from earning:* So the news is like: Hoo boy, that is not such a great story for banks to tell their shareholders: We're less profitable, less diversified (with more of our income coming from basic borrow-short-lend-long interest income), and return less cash to shareholders.  But it's a pretty good story for the banking regulators? Higher capital requirements have to come at  someone's  expense, at least in the short term. It's somewhat surprising that the someone has so far turned out to be mostly bank shareholders -- the people for whose benefit the banks are nominally run -- rather than, say, Small Business Borrowers or some other more politically attractive group. You can see why BIS would be happy to advertise that result. * Here's a table of that: ** Though that lending is a bit more expensive. Net interest income, as a percentage of assets,  is  up: Incidentally, the report has a good little overview at the beginning of ways that a bank could theoretically increase capital; here's what they have to say about this approach:
