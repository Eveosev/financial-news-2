HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA)  and  Morgan
Stanley (MS)  are working with outside firms to develop a shared
client-screening service amid a crackdown by regulators on money
laundering.  Genpact Ltd. and Markit Group Ltd. are creating the
service, which will help banks satisfy so-called know-your-client requirements, Hamilton, Bermuda-based Genpact said today
in a statement. The service will allow banks to start new
trading relationships faster and cut costs by sharing  expenses ,
according to the statement.  The U.S. fined London-based HSBC $1.9 billion last year
over claims the lender gave terrorists and drug cartels access
to the U.S. financial system. Europe’s biggest bank was accused
of failing to monitor more than $670 billion in wire transfers
and more than $9.4 billion in purchases of U.S. currency from
HSBC  Mexico , prosecutors said.  HSBC accepted responsibility at the time and said it’s “a
fundamentally different organization from the one that made
those mistakes.” New York-based Morgan Stanley, owner of the
world’s largest brokerage, hasn’t faced fines over money
laundering since the financial crisis.  Regulators have ordered U.S. banks including Citigroup Inc.
and JPMorgan Chase & Co. to tighten their controls.  The new service could “help drive higher standards,
consistency and best practice,” David Burnett, chief operating
officer of HSBC’s banking and markets unit, said in the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
