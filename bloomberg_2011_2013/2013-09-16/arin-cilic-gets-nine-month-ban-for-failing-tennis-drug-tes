Marin Cilic of  Croatia  was banned
for nine months after failing a drug test at a tournament in
 Germany , the  International Tennis Federation  said in an e-mailed
statement.  The  24-year-old Cilic , who was No. 11 on the ATP World Tour
rankings at the time, had the stimulant nikethamide in a urine
sample he gave on May 1 at the BMW Open in Munich after taking
glucose tablets bought from a pharmacy, according to the ITF.  The federation said that it found Cilic had ingested the
substance “inadvertently” and backdated his ban to May 1. It
will run until Jan. 31, 2014.  The ITF also ruled Cilic’s ranking points and prize money
from events after May 1 and before he accepted a “voluntary
provisional suspension” should be forfeited. It didn’t say when
the suspension began. Cilic pulled out of Wimbledon on June 26
with a knee injury, the ITF said at the time. He beat Marcos Baghdatis in the first round a day earlier.  Cilic lost to Wimbledon champion Andy Murray in the final
of a grass-court warm-up event at  London ’s Queens Club earlier
in June.  To contact the reporter on this story:
