The  New York Jets  cut punter Robert
Malone two weeks into the National Football League season,
replacing him with former Boston College punter Ryan Quigley.  Malone, 25, was in his second season with the Jets after
beating out Quigley during training camp and was released after
averaging 37.1 net yards per punt this season, the team said on
Twitter. That was  28th  of the leagueâ€™s 32 teams. He had 16
punts, including one for 84 yards during a season-opening win
over the  Tampa Bay Buccaneers , though his average distance fell
to 44.6 yards in a Week 2 loss to the New England Patriots from
48.4 yards per punt in Week 1.  New York also signed linebacker Scott Solomon, released
wide receiver Rahsaan Vaughn from the practice squad and added
linebacker Danny Lansanah to the practice squad, the team said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
