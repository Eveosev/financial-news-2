The U.S. Defense Department has
withheld $195 million in payments from  Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT) 
because of flaws in the company’s system of tracking costs and
schedules for F-35 jet contracts.  The amount held back through August is equal to as much as
5 percent of periodic billings by the Bethesda, Maryland-based
company. It has swelled from $47 million in 2012, when the
Pentagon started holding back the funds.  The Defense Contract Management Agency first raised
concerns in 2007 about internal company data generated for
Lockheed’s fighter programs -- the F-35, F-22 and F-16 jets. The
agency decertified the Pentagon-mandated Earned Value Management
System for the contractor’s aircraft operations in October 2010.  Payments will continue to be withheld until the agency
determines that Lockheed’s Fort Worth, Texas-based aeronautics
unit demonstrates that its corrective action plan approved in
March works, according to the agency.  The agency has scheduled a review that will take place by
Dec. 30, Jacqueline Noble, a spokeswoman for the  Defense
Contract Management Agency , said in an e-mailed statement.  Lockheed Martin spokeswoman Laura Siebert didn’t have an
immediate comment on the increase in withholding or the
company’s progress in correcting deficiencies with the system.  To contact the reporter on this story:
