Broadway’s $75 million “Spider-man” is dangling precariously from its delicate web.  “Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark” posted its worst sales to
date, down 8 percent from the previous week, which itself was a
new low since previews began in Nov. 2010.  The musical, with songs by Bono and The Edge of U2, sold
$731,000 of tickets, according to the trade association the
Broadway League. That’s far below its estimated weekly expenses
of $1 million and suggests the show has lost hundreds of
thousands of dollars over four consecutive weeks of six-figure
sales. (Beginning yesterday, the producers said Justin Matthew
Sargent replaced Reeve Carney, the original Peter Parker and
Spider-Man.)  The Jewish New Year played havoc with other stragglers.
“Annie” fell to $468,000 and “Cinderella” to $650,000 -- new
lows for both and short of half of their potential. “Annie”
closes on Jan. 5, 2014.  “Soul Doctor,” about the folksy Rabbi Shlomo Carlebach,
descended into the dreaded five figures, $98,000, 16 percent of
its sales potential.  In its first full week of previews, “ Big Fish ,” directed
and choreographed by Susan Stroman about a dying dad and angry
son, sold a solid $583,000 for seven performances. “Romeo and
Juliet,” which opens Thursday night, took in $472,000, up 7
percent.  And “The Glass Menagerie,” which stars Cherry Jones and
Zachary Quinto and opens next week, rose 46 percent to $466,000.  Muse highlights include  Jeremy Gerard  on theater and
Patrick Cole on  music .  To contact the reporter on this story:
