Former Treasury Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner  isn’t interested in serving as Federal Reserve
Chairman after  Lawrence Summers  today withdrew from
consideration for the post, according to a person familiar with
Geithner’s thinking.  Geithner, who has consulted with President Barack Obama on
whom to nominate, remains firm in his stance even after Summers
informed Obama he no longer wished to be considered as a
possible nominee to lead the central bank, according to the
person, who asked not to be identified.  “Any possible confirmation process for me would be
acrimonious and would not serve the interests of the Federal
Reserve, the administration, or ultimately, the interests of the
nation’s ongoing recovery,” Summers wrote in a letter dated
today to Obama.  To contact the reporters on this story:
