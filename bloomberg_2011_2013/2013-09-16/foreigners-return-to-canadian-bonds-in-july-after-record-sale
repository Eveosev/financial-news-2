Foreigners bought Canadian
securities in July, returning to bonds after a record divestment
the previous month, government figures showed.  Purchases totaled C$6.09 billion ($5.91 billion) in July
following Juneâ€™s net sale of C$15.4 billion,  Statistics Canada 
said today in Ottawa.  Foreign investors bought a net C$3.64 billion of bonds
after the June sale of C$19.1 billion. They also bought C$1.52
billion of stocks and C$927 million of money-market paper.  Total purchases so far this year have slowed to C$21.9
billion from C$42.7 billion for the same period in 2012, led by
a slowing of bond purchases.  Canadians  bought  a net C$947 million of foreign securities
in July, including a C$1.61 billion acquisition of bonds and
sales of C$730 million of stocks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
