Post Holdings Inc. (POST) , the maker of
Raisin Bran and Honey Bunches of Oats cereals, agreed to buy
 Glencore Xstrata Plc (GLEN) ’s Dakota Growers Pasta Co. for $370 million
to expand its food offerings.  The acquisition is set to be completed in January and will
add about $300 million to sales and as much as $46 million to
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization,
St. Louis-based Post said yesterday in a statement. The cash
deal will be financed using cash on hand and as much as $200
million in committed debt financing, Post said.  Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Bill Stiritz has been
buying products such as Premier Nutrition supplements and
Hearthside Food Solutions’ organic cereals and snacks since his
company was spun off from Ralcorp Inc. last year. The North
American pasta market is worth about $5 billion a year, Post
said in yesterday’s statement.  “Post continues to expand its portfolio into segments of
the overall  food industry  where it sees opportunities to grow
and diversify its strong  cash flow ,” Stiritz said in the
statement.  Post climbed 4.6 percent to close at $43.86 in New York
yesterday. Glencore, based in Baar, Switzerland, rose 0.1
percent to 341.90 pence in London. Dakota Growers is based in
Carrington, North Dakota.  Peter Grauer, the chairman of Bloomberg LP, the parent of
 Bloomberg News , is a non-executive director of Glencore Xstrata.  To contact the reporter on this story:
