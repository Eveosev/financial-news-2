Gold gained as the dollar dropped
to the lowest level in a month after Lawrence Summers withdrew
from consideration as the next Federal Reserve chairman before
the central bank meets this week to decide on stimulus. Silver
rallied from its worst week since June.  Bullion for immediate delivery climbed as much as 0.8
percent to $1,336.40 an ounce and traded at $1,329.38 by 8:19
a.m. in  Singapore . Prices dropped 4.7 percent last week, the
biggest decline since the period ended June 28. Gold for
December delivery rose 1.6 percent to $1,329.70 an ounce on the
Comex in New York, rallying from a 5.6 percent loss last week.  President  Barack Obama  had mentioned Summers and Fed Vice
Chairman Janet Yellen as potential candidates to lead the
central bank after Ben S. Bernankeâ€™s term as chairman expires
Jan. 31. The Fed is forecast to reduce its bond-purchase
program, called quantitative easing, this week, according to a
Bloomberg News survey. Summers, a former Treasury Secretary,
would tighten Fed policy more than Yellen, a Bloomberg Global
Poll showed last week.  The Bloomberg Dollar Index, a gauge against 10 major
trading partners, fell as much as 0.5 percent to the lowest
since Aug. 12. The index gained 3.4 percent this year while gold
tumbled 21 percent as investors lost faith in the metal as a
store of value and the Fed indicated it may buy fewer bonds.  The metal rose 70 percent from December 2008 to June 2011
as the U.S. central bank pumped more than $2 trillion into the
financial system by buying debt. Policy makers will cut monthly
purchases by $10 billion at their Sept. 17-18 meeting to $75
billion, a survey of 34 economists Sept. 6 showed.  Silver for immediate delivery was little changed at $22.22
an ounce. Prices slumped 6.9 percent last week, the most since
June 21. The metal for December delivery surged as much as 3.6
percent to $22.49 an ounce in New York before trading at $22.23.  Palladium advanced 1 percent to $707.55 an ounce while
platinum was little changed at $1,452.90 an ounce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
