The Washington  Nationals ’ game
tonight against the Atlanta Braves was postponed after at least
12 people were shot to death at the U.S. Naval Sea Systems
Command headquarters near the ballpark, the team said on
Twitter.  The game will be made up as part of a day-night
doubleheader tomorrow, Major League Baseball said in a
statement. The first game will start at 1:05 p.m. and the second
at 7:05 p.m.  “All of us here in the Nationals organization were deeply
saddened to learn of the tragic events that occurred this
morning only a few blocks from Nationals Park,” the team said
in a statement. “Our thoughts and prayers remain with our
friends at the Navy Yard and those impacted by today’s
incident.”  The shootings began around 8:15 a.m. about a mile from the
U.S. Capitol. Authorities closed streets near the Navy Yard and
lockdowns were imposed at nearby schools.  The Navy Yard shooting was the deadliest mass killing in
the U.S. since 20 pupils and six adults were shot in Newtown,
 Connecticut , in December. Last month, Army Major Nidal Hassan
was sentenced to death for a November 2009 shooting that left 13
people dead and more than 30 others wounded at Fort Hood,  Texas .  The District of Columbia used Parking Lot B at Nationals
Stadium as a site for people trying to reunite with family
members who worked at the Navy Yard.  To contact the reporter on this story:
