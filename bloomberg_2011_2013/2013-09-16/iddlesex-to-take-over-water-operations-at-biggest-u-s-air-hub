Middlesex Water Co. (MSEX)  was awarded a
privatization contract to take over water operations at the U.S.
Department of Defense’s largest air-freight hub, at Dover Air
Force Base, Delaware, under a 50-year agreement.  The 116-year-old water and wastewater provider’s Dover-based Tidewater Utilities unit will own and operate all water-related assets at the base, according to a statement today from
Iselin, New Jersey-based Middlesex. Terms weren’t disclosed.  “This agreement expands Middlesex Water’s suite of
services to include military base operations and further expands
our privatization efforts,” Bernadette Sohler, a Middlesex
spokeswoman, said in an e-mail today.  The privatization deal, after it’s approved by the Delaware
 Public Service Commission  and implemented, is expected to be
accretive to the company’s earnings immediately.  The base has more than 11,000 military personnel and family
members, according to its  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
