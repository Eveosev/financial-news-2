Natural gas futures surged in  New
York  to the highest price in more than seven weeks on
speculation that a supply report this week will show a smaller-than-normal increase amid hot weather in the Midwest.  Gas climbed 1.7 percent. Government data scheduled for
release on Sept. 19 may show inventories rose by 62 billion
cubic feet in the week ended Sept. 13, compared with the five-year average gain of 74 billion, according to Citi Futures
Perspective. MDA Weather Services said central U.S. temperatures
may be above-normal through Sept. 30.  “Traders are looking for a below-average storage injection
this week,” said  Phil Flynn , a senior market analyst at Price
Futures Group in  Chicago . “We still have some very hot
temperatures in the Midwest and the market is still trending
up.”  Natural gas for October delivery rose 6.1 cents to $3.738
per million British thermal units on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange , the highest settlement since July 23. Trading volume
was 3.1 percent above the 100-day average at 2:34 p.m. Prices
are up 12 percent this year and gained 4.2 percent last week.  The discount of October to November futures narrowed 0.2
cent to 7.6 cents. October gas traded 30.3 cents below the
January contract, compared with 31.2 cents on Sept. 13.  November $2.85 puts were the most active options in
electronic trading. They were 0.1 cent higher at 0.2 cent per
million Btu on volume of 1,455 at 2:54 p.m. Puts accounted for
47 percent of trading volume. Implied volatility for October at-the-money options was 28.91 percent at 2:45 p.m., compared with
27.75 percent on Sept. 13.  CFTC Report  Money managers’ net-long wagers on four U.S.  natural gas 
contracts rose by 3,120, or 1.2 percent, to 271,676 futures
equivalents, the highest level since July 23, according
Commodity Futures Trading Commission data released Sept. 13.  The measure includes an index of four contracts adjusted to
futures equivalents: Nymex natural gas futures, Nymex  Henry Hub 
Swap Futures, Nymex ClearPort Henry Hub Penultimate Swaps and
the ICE Futures U.S. Henry Hub contract. Henry Hub, in Erath,
 Louisiana , is the delivery point for Nymex futures, a benchmark
price for the fuel.  Gas inventories totaled 3.253 trillion cubic feet in the
week ended Sept. 6, 1.4 percent above the five-year average and
5 percent below year-earlier supplies, EIA data show.  The high in Chicago on Sept. 19 may be 83 degrees
Fahrenheit (28 Celsius), 9 more than usual, according to
 AccuWeather Inc.  in  State College ,  Pennsylvania .  The high in
Houston may be 92 degrees, 4 above normal.  Power Plants  Power generation accounts for 32 percent of U.S. gas
demand, according to the Energy Information Administration, the
Energy Department’s statistical arm.  Tropical Storm Ingrid was moving inland over  Mexico  with
maximum sustained winds of about 45 miles (75 kilometers) per
hour, the National Hurricane Center in Miami said in a 2 p.m.
advisory. The  Gulf of Mexico  will account for 5.6 percent of
U.S. gas production this year, EIA data show.  An area of disturbed weather over the northwestern
 Caribbean Sea  may move across the Yucatan Peninsula into the
southwestern Gulf of Mexico in the next few days, according to
the hurricane center. The system has a 20 percent chance of
becoming a tropical cyclone during the next five days.  Gas output will climb 2.3 percent, or 1.5 billion cubic
feet a day, to average 67.8 billion cubic feet a day in 2014,
faster than this year’s growth rate of 0.5 billion cubic feet a
day,  Bill Herbert , an analyst at Simmons & Co. in Houston, said
in a note to clients today.  Growth will be driven by increased production from the
Marcellus shale in the Northeast and associated gas from oil
drilling while decline rates at legacy unconventional wells
flatten, Herbert said.  The U.S. met 87 percent of its own energy needs in the
first five months of 2013, on pace to be the highest annual rate
since 1986, according to EIA data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
