Libya  restored about 25 percent of
its oil production capacity with the start of the El Feel and
Sharara fields following talks between the government and
striking workers, state-run news agency Lana reported.  The El Feel, or Elephant, field, with a capacity of 140,000
barrels a day and the 300,000 barrel-a-day Sharara fields
resumed pumping today, Lana cited Abdulwahhab El-Gayedi, head of
the Libyan parliament’s oil-industry crisis group, as saying.
Both fields are supplying the nation’s 120,000 barrel-a-day
Zawiya refinery, Mansur Abdallah, the plant’s oil movement
coordinator, said today by phone from Tripoli.  Libya, holder of Africa’s biggest oil reserves, is pumping
about 250,000 barrels a day, compared with a post-revolution
high of 1.6 million barrels achieved a year ago, as a labor
dispute at oil terminals cripples its ability to export, Deputy
Oil Minister Omar Shakmak said Sept. 12. The nation is losing
$130 million a day because of the suspension, according to the
 finance ministry .  Production from Sharara, operated by  Repsol SA (REP) , and El
Feel, operated by  Eni SpA (ENI) , both in western Libya, was halted by
protesters on Aug. 26, according to the Oil Ministry.  To contact the reporters on this story:
