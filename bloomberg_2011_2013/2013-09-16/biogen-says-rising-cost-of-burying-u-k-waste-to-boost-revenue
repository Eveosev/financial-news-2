Biogen Ltd., a U.K. developer of
facilities that generate electricity from food waste, said
revenue is set to double by the end of 2015 as the cost of
burying waste rises.  The company is building four plants that will use household
and commercial food waste to generate power, Richard Barker, the
chief executive officer of Bedfordshire-based Biogen, said by e-mail. These should start working by the end of 2014, helping to
more than double Biogen’s revenue, which was 8 million pounds
($13 million) last year, by the end of 2015, he said.  Supermarkets and businesses are being pushed to send their
food waste to anaerobic digestion facilities such as Biogen’s by
a  landfill tax  that makes it increasingly expensive to bury
waste. It was introduced in April 2012 at 64 pounds a metric ton
and rose to 72 pounds in the same month this year.  “Together with our existing plants we will be able to
process over 220,000 tons per year and generate in excess of
90,000 megawatt-hours per annum,” Barker said.  Biogen plans to have nine working facilities feeding
electricity into the U.K. grid by 2017. Its clients include
retailers, manufacturers, caterers and supermarkets.  Kier Group
Plc (KIE)  bought half of Biogen for 24.4 million pounds in August last
year. Biogen will use this money as well as investment from Iona
Capital Ltd. to build the plants.  To contact the reporter on this story:
