Gasoline fell along with crude as a
U.S. accord with Russia reduced the threat of an American
military strike against  Syria .  Futures slid as the Sept. 14 agreement to pursue the
destruction of Syria’s chemical weapons eased concern that
Middle East regional tensions would be ignited and crude supply
disrupted by a U.S. targeted attack on Syria.  “The biggest contributor to today’s decline is that Russia
and the U.S. have agreed on a plan to put Syria’s chemical
weapons under international control,” said  Andy Lipow ,
president of Lipow Oil Associates LLC in Houston. “The market
doesn’t see the U.S. conducting a missile attack on Syria for an
extended period of time.”  Gasoline for October delivery fell 4.54 cents, or 1.6
percent, to $2.7242 a gallon at 9:31 a.m. on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange  on trading volume that was 8.3 percent below
the 100-day average.  The accord, negotiated by U.S. Secretary of State  John Kerry  and Russian Foreign Minister  Sergei Lavrov , sets a
framework for finding, securing and destroying Syrian President
Bashar al-Assad’s stocks of poison gas. The agreement quelled
the prospect of a U.S. military strike on Syria in response to
an Aug. 21 chemical weapons attack outside Damascus.  “This is mostly about Syria today,” said  Andrew Lebow , a
senior vice president at Jefferies Bache LLC in New York.  “The
market beginning last week was in the process of removing the
 risk premium  that had been attached to Syria.”  Pump Price  The motor fuel’s  crack spread  versus West Texas
Intermediate crude narrowed 36 cents to $7.75 a barrel while the
fuel’s  premium  over Brent gained 76 cents to $4.30.  Pump prices , averaged nationwide, fell 0.6 cent to $3.517 a
gallon, 34.7 cents below a year ago, Heathrow, Florida-based AAA

cents, or 0.8 percent, to $3.0874 a gallon. Trading volume was
