Campaigning for  Azerbaijan ’s
presidential election next month kicked off as incumbent  Ilham Aliyev  prepares to face a candidate backed by the secular
opposition’s largest alliance in a decade.  Aliyev, who’s been touring the country and signing decrees
to increase public-sector wages, visited newly reconstructed
schools in the capital, Baku, today as pupils returned from
summer vacation. His challenger is Camil Hasanli, a prominent
historian and professor at Baku State University who was
nominated last month by the opposition National Council of
Democratic Forces.  Aliyev, 51, who succeeded his father in a disputed
presidential ballot 10 years ago, was nominated by the ruling
New Azerbaijan Party, or YAP, in July to compete for a third
term in office. The Azeri leader’s family has run the oil-rich
 Caspian Sea  state for more than four decades.  Human Rights Watch  said Sept. 2 that the authorities are
engaged in a “deliberate” and “abusive” strategy to limit
dissent before the vote. The New York-based group also reported
a “dramatic” deterioration in the government’s record on
freedom of expression, assembly, and association in the last 18
months.  Eight other candidates representing small pro-government
parties are also running in the election, which is scheduled for
Oct. 9. The opposition’s initial choice, Oscar-winning
screenwriter Rustam Ibrahimbayov, was disqualified because he
also holds Russian citizenship.  To contact the reporter on this story:
