An IVF clinic owner in  London  is
opening an egg bank today to encourage more donations to help
treat women who are struggling to conceive.  The company that runs the private  London Women’s Clinic  is
starting the London Egg Bank, the country’s first such facility,
to address the shortage of donors, according to an e-mailed
statement.  A U.K. law  removed anonymity  from donation of sperm and
eggs in 2005. Egg donors weren’t allowed to be paid more than
250 pounds ($400) until last year. They can now receive as much
as  750 pounds  for their time and expenses.  “We are hoping to inform women about egg donation and to
make it simpler,” Kamal Ahuja, director of the London Women’s
Clinic, which is owned by the same company as the egg bank, said
in the statement.  Almost  1,400 women  in the U.K. donated eggs for use in IVF
treatment in 2010, according to the Human Fertilization and
Embryology Authority, the country’s regulator. Others have been
driven abroad by the lack of donors, the London Egg Bank said.  A  study  of more than 1,400 European egg donors, presented
at the  European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology 
meeting in London in July, found that more than half donated out
of altruism, though financial compensation was also a
significant incentive for some donors.  The London Egg Bank is part of JD Healthcare Group, which
includes the London Women’s Clinic, the London Sperm Bank and
the Bridge Centre. The egg bank will also provide egg-freezing
and storage services for women not ready to begin a family, the
company said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
