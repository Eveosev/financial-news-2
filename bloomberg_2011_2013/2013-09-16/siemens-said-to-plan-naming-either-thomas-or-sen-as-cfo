Siemens AG (SIE) ,  Europe ’s largest
engineering company, is poised to promote Ralf Thomas or Michael Sen to the position of chief financial officer, said three
people with knowledge of the matter.  The Munich-based company has yet to decide between the two
candidates, said the people, who are familiar with the hiring
process and asked not to be named as the talks are private.
Thomas is the finance chief of Siemens’s industry division and
Sen holds the same role at the health-care business.  While the CFO shortlist also includes two external
candidates, an internal appointment is the preferred option
because of Siemens’s complex structure and both Thomas and Sen
are well regarded within the company, the people said. The
finance chief may be appointed at a supervisory board meeting on
Wednesday, the people said. Siemens declined to comment.  The company needs to name a new finance chief after Joe Kaeser became chief executive officer last month, replacing
 Peter Loescher  after five profit forecast cuts in six years.  To contact the reporters on this story:
