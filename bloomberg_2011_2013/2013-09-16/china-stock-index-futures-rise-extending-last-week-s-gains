China’s stocks  fell for a second
day, led by material producers, financial companies and
airlines, after technical indicators signaled shares were
overbought. Smaller-company shares rallied.  Jiangxi Copper Co. and Anhui Conch Cement Co. led declines
for material companies with losses of at least 1.4 percent.
 Shanghai Pudong Development Bank (600000)  Co. tumbled 3.5 percent, paring
a rally to 36 percent since Aug. 22, when the Ministry of
Commerce said the city’s free-trade zone proposal had been
approved in July.  China Eastern Airlines Corp. (600115)  slid 5 percent
after valuations jumped to a one-year high.  Huayi Brothers Media
Corp. (300027)  paced a rally for smaller companies on the ChiNext index.  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  fell 0.2 percent to 2,231.40
at the close after rising 4.5 percent last week. The 14-day
relative strength index, measuring how rapidly prices have risen
or dropped during a specified time period, was at 72.4 today.
Readings above 70 show a price may be poised to fall.  “We need a technical correction after the rally,” said
Mao Sheng, an analyst for Huaxi Securities Co. in Chengdu. “You
see cash rotating to the smaller caps, which doesn’t need as
much liquidity as large caps. Also, there’s speculation
September and October data may not be as good as August.
Cyclical stocks started dropping because of this.”  The CSI 300 Index slipped 0.4 percent to 2,478.39, paring a
gain to 15 percent since reaching this year’s low on June 27.
The  Shanghai  index has rallied 14 percent since the low as
August data ranging from exports to industrial output showed
growth is accelerating and as companies based in the city surged
after the State Council approved a free-trade zone. The ChiNext
gained 2 percent today.  Materials, Banks  The Shanghai measure is  valued  at 9 times its projected 12-month earnings, compared with the five-year average of 12.6
times, according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg. Trading volumes
were 14 percent above the 30-day average today.  Jiangxi Copper, the biggest producer of the metal, lost 1.5
percent to 16.97  yuan . Anhui Conch, the largest cement company,
dropped 1.4 percent to 15.98 yuan.  China Eastern  led declines for industrial shares, slumping

Shanghai free-trade zone is negative for Chinese banks because
of faster compression of net interest margins if authorities
allow yuan  interest rates  to be fully deregulated, Jefferies
Group LLC said in a report dated Sept. 13.  Biggest Gains  The financial and industrial  gauges  in the CSI 300 have
each rallied 12 percent since Aug. 22, the most among 10
industry groups, on speculation the free-trade zone will lure
more business and boost earnings.  The trade zone is “very positive” and will help improve
the country’s competitiveness, World Bank President Jim Yong Kim
said at a briefing in Shanghai over the weekend. Premier  Li
Keqiang  may travel to the city at the end of this month to
officiate the opening ceremony for the city’s free-trade zone,
two people with knowledge of the matter said.  The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index climbed 1.3 percent
as former Treasury Secretary  Lawrence Summers  withdrew his name
from consideration to be chairman of the  Federal Reserve . The
Bloomberg China-US Equity Index rose 0.4 percent on Sept. 13.  Film company Huayi Brothers surged 5.1 percent, adding to a
10 percent jump on Sept. 13. The company paid 210 million yuan
for a 20 percent stake in Jiangsu Yao Lai Cinema Management,
Variety reported.  The Shanghai index is poised to extend gains as investors
anticipate the Chinese economy will keep strengthening, said Tom DeMark, the developer of market-timing indicators who predicted
the gauge’s rally from a four-year low in June.  “The sharp acceleration over the past two weeks has
introduced the possibility of a positive fundamental development
which could extend the current rally into something more than
one normally would expect,” the founder of Market Studies LLC,
