European Union average corn yields
will be lower than expected last month after hot and dry weather
in  Italy  during flowering in August hurt the grain, according to
the bloc’s crop-monitoring unit.  The average yield is forecast at 6.88 metric tons per
hectare (2.47 acres) from 6.05 tons in 2012, the EU’s Monitoring
Agricultural Resources unit wrote in a  report  today. The outlook
was cut from 6.97 tons per hectare expected last month.  Italy was the EU’s second-largest corn grower behind France
last year, overtaking  Romania , where output slumped due to a
summer heatwave. Yields in Romania are expected to rebound 83
percent this year, beating a 3.6 percent gain in Italy.  In Italy, “the critical flowering and grain-filling phases
for maize largely coincided with a long hot and dry period which
affected yield potentials,” MARS wrote, using another name for
corn. “Yields are expected to be below average.”  Farmers in Italy are expected to harvest an average 8.66
tons of corn per hectare, less than the 8.92 tons forecast in
August and up from 8.36 tons per hectare gathered last year.
Romanian farmers are seen reaping 3.95 tons of the grain per
hectare, up from 2.16 tons in 2012 and down from last month’s
prediction of 4.18 tons per hectare.  In  France , the 28-bloc’s largest corn producer, average
yields are predicted to be 9.01 tons per hectare, MARS wrote, up
from 8.91 tons in 2012 and compared with an August forecast of
9.06 tons per hectare.  To contact the reporter on this story:
