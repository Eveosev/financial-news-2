As  Boeing Co. (BA)  prepares to fly the
first of its bigger 787 Dreamliners, Chief Executive Officer Jim McNerney is plotting production of the marquee jet at a faster
pace as he gains confidence it has overcome a troubled past.  A smooth takeoff for the 787-9, which may have its first
test flight as early as today, should help Chicago-based Boeing
speed the Dreamliner’s manufacturing tempo to profit from a
backlog of 853 orders worth $146.5 billion, according to
Bloomberg Industries estimates.  The latest Dreamliner features tighter design and
manufacturing controls that the world’s largest aerospace
company is using to develop the 737 Max and 777x. While Boeing
is working to produce 10 Dreamliners a month by year’s end, the
most ever for a twin-aisle jet, McNerney is studying boosting
output again when the 787-10 makes its mid-decade debut.  “We have a marketplace that wants us to go higher,”
McNerney told a  Morgan Stanley (MS)  Industrials and Autos Conference
yesterday, while saying Boeing won’t do so until assuring that
production and the supply chain are stable at the record pace.
“The two words ‘787’ and ‘stable’ haven’t always been used in
the same sentence.”  Accelerating Dreamliner production and avoiding setbacks
like the battery fires that grounded the fleet this year are
critical if Boeing is to keep revenue growing as it redesigns
the best-selling 737 and 777 jets, said George Ferguson, senior
analyst with Bloomberg Industries in Skillman, New Jersey.  Company’s Future  “Without getting the 787 program up and moving and
delivering, they’re going to be in a situation shortly where the
777 will be the only wide-body program that’s delivering any
volume,” Ferguson said in a phone interview. “The 787 is the
hope of the future for this company when it comes to the wide-body business.”  Boeing rose 3.9 percent yesterday to $115.67 -- the highest
level in at least 33 years -- after  Peter Arment , an aerospace
analyst with Sterne, Agee & Leach Inc., raised his price target
$44 to $164 per share.  Arment, who is based in Birmingham,  Alabama , rates Boeing
buy and predicts the company could generate about $40 billion in
free cash flow between 2014 and 2017. Aircraft deliveries may
increase 24 percent to about 800 annually by mid-decade.  “Boeing’s got it teed up,” Gary Bradshaw, a fund manager
with Hodges Capital Management in  Dallas , said in a phone
interview. “If they can execute, it should be a very good stock
for a number of years.”  Supply-Chain Issues  Boeing is aware of the stakes and created a “disciplined
management model” to guide development of the latest Dreamliner
while it was still working to resolve design issues and supply-chain snarls that left the first 787-8 and a redesigned 747
years behind schedule, said Scott Fancher, Boeing’s vice
president and general manager of airplane development.  “It’s a complex challenge to define the right combination
of design and build improvements for a derivative while you’re
developing the parent airplane,” Fancher said last month in an
interview in his Everett, Washington, office. “Despite that
complexity, we loaded the -9 into the factory the very day we
scheduled over 2 1/2 years ago.”  The initial flight of the new Dreamliner will be from Paine
Field, adjacent to Boeing’s factory in Everett, where the first
787-9 was assembled.  The new jet is 20 feet (6 meters) longer than the 787-8 and
seats 40 more people, which should boost its operating economics
for airlines, Richard Aboulafia, vice president with Teal Group,
a consultant based in Fairfax,  Virginia , said in a phone
interview. The first of two planned Dreamliner derivatives, the
-9 accounts for 45 percent of orders for Boeing’s largest wide-body program.  Longer Range  Boeing’s newest airplane has a list price of $249.5 million
and seats 250 to 290 passengers. It also has a longer range than
the first Dreamliner: 8,000 to 8,500 nautical miles (14,800 to
15,750 kilometers) compared with the 787-8’s range of 7,650 to
8,200 miles.  The 787-9 also features new technology to reduce airframe
drag and fuel burn, according to Fancher, who declined to
discuss specifics.  Boeing’s system may involve suction that circulates air
through the leading edges or surface of the plane’s horizontal
and vertical stabilizers to reduce turbulent air flow, Robert Mann, an aerospace consultant, said in a phone interview.  Lower Drag  “By doing so, you reduce drag while maintaining the
desired lift,” said Mann, who heads R.W. Mann & Co., based in
Port Washington, New York. Increasing the efficiency of the
plane’s surface could boost its fuel savings “a couple
percent,” he added.  Doug Alder, a Boeing spokesman, declined to comment on fuel
savings for the 787-9.  Boeing’s oversight of its suppliers is much improved since
the first 787 was delivered 3 1/2 years late in 2011 after the
company grappled with fire, parts shortages and integrating
designs completed by suppliers rather than its engineers, said
Aboulafia. He estimates Boeing’s tab to develop the 787-8 was
“in the $20 billion range when all the smoke cleared.”  “Today we work shoulder to shoulder with all our
partners,” Fancher said. “Pulling the partners into the design
team, not holding them at arm’s length,” is a key lesson
learned from the 787-8, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
