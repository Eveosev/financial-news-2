European construction output
increased for the first time in seven months in January led by a
rebound in  Germany  following frigid weather in the prior month.  Construction in the euro region rose 1.8 percent from
December, when it declined 2 percent, the European Union’s 
statistics office  in Luxembourg said today. That is the first
increase since June 2010. From a year earlier, January
construction decreased 4.5 percent.  The coldest winter in 40 years kept workers in Germany, the
region’s largest economy, off construction sites in December.
German construction jumped 36 percent in January after a 24
percent slump in the prior month, today’s data showed.  French output increased 7.9 percent, while  Portugal  posted
a 1.3 percent decline, according to the report.  In the 27-nation European Union, January construction rose
1 percent from December.  To contact the reporter on this story:
