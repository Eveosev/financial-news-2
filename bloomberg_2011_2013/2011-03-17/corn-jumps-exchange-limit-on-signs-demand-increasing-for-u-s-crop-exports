Corn prices jumped the most in five
months on signs that demand is increasing for U.S. grain after
prices slumped following last week’s earthquake in  Japan , the
world’s biggest buyer.  U.S. exporters reported sales more than doubled in the week
ended March 10 from a week earlier, government data showed
today. The  U.S. Department of Agriculture  also reported the sale
of 116,000 metric tons to unknown destinations for delivery
before Sept. 1. Before today, the cost of corn at shipping
terminals near  New Orleans  fell 15 percent this month.  “Export sales suggest demand is improving,” said  Mark Schultz , the chief analyst at Northstar Commodity Investment Co.
in Minneapolis. “There is some speculation that sales to
unknown may be headed to China,”, Schultz said.  Corn futures for May delivery surged by the exchange limit
of 30 cents, or 4.9 percent, to close at $6.465 a bushel at 1:15
p.m. on the Chicago Board of Trade, the biggest gain for a most-
active contract since Oct. 20. Yesterday, the price touched
$6.08, the lowest since Jan. 12.    China , the second-biggest producer, became a net importer
last year for the first time since 1996 after adverse weather
reduced crops. The U.S. is the leading grower and exporter.  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $66.7 billion in
2010, government figures show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
