Tokyo Electric Power Co. engineers
have laid a new power line to the stricken No. 2 reactor at the
Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant, the  International Atomic Energy
Agency  said.  The new line, measuring about one kilometer (0.6 miles),
aims to restore power to the plantâ€™s cooling systems, which were
knocked out by the earthquake and tsunami March 11, a company
official earlier told a press conference on NHK.  Engineers plan to reconnect power after they finish
spraying water to cool the Unit 3 reactor building, the IAEA
said, citing Japanese authorities. Spraying temporarily stopped
at 10:09 local time, the agency said on its  website .  To contact the reporters on this story:
