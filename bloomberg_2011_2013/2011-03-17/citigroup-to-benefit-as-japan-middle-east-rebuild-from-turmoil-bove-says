  Citigroup Inc. (C) , the U.S. lender
emphasizing international growth, may benefit as  Japan  rebuilds
from last week’s earthquake and the Middle East rebounds from
political turmoil, according to analyst  Richard Bove .  Citigroup may profit as Japanese corporations raise money
for reconstruction after the quake and tsunami, and from Arab
states trying to create jobs, Bove wrote today in a note titled
“Buy This Stock Now.” Bove, based in Lutz,  Florida , is an
analyst with Rochdale Securities LLC.  “Citigroup is not going to suffer any meaningful setback
due to the global issues currently under way,” Bove wrote.
“The stock has fallen on a false premise. As this is better
understood, the shortfall that has occurred in the past two
months will be reversed.”  Shares of the New York-based bank, ranked third by assets
among U.S. lenders, set a 16-month high of $5.15 on Jan. 14,
following a 43 percent jump in 2010. They’ve since fallen below
$4.45. Bove has attributed the drop to a slowdown in developing
economies, which account for more than half of the bank’s
profit, according to Chief Executive Officer  Vikram Pandit .  Japan represents the bank’s third-largest concentration of
credit outstanding, with $39.2 billion of investment securities,
loans and trading assets linked to the Japanese government,
according to a regulatory filing. Citigroup is likely to lose
about $700 million on its Japanese investment, which the bank
should be able to manage, Bove said.  Jon Diat, a spokesman for the bank, declined to comment on
the report. The stock gained 2 cents to $4.41 as of 1:41 p.m. in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading. Bove is forecasting
the price will reach $7.
