The number of mobile-phone users in  Rwanda  jumped 51 percent in 2010, boosted by increased
competition, lower taxes and promotions by operators,  New Times 
reported, citing the Rwanda Utilities Regulatory Agency.  The total increased to 3.6 million people from 2.4 million
a year earlier, the Kigali-based newspaper said.  The East African nation has the second-lowest mobile-phone
subscription rate in the region after neigboring Burundi, the
New Times said. By 2015, the agency expects more than half of
Rwandaâ€™s 10 million people to use the devices, the newspaper
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
