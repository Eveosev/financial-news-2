Taiwan’s government bonds advanced,
pushing benchmark 10-year yields to the lowest level since
November, as a worsening radiation leak from  Japan  prompted
investors to favor the safest assets.  The  Taiwan dollar  fell to a two-week low after the head of
the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission said yesterday Japan’s
Fukushima Dai-Ichi power plant is releasing “extremely high”
levels of radiation that could be life-threatening. Global funds
sold $1.6 billion more Taiwanese shares than they bought in the
past seven days, according to exchange data.  “The nuclear risk in Japan led to selling of Asian assets
and regional currencies,” said Samson Tu, who helps manage $1.6
billion of fixed-income securities at Uni-President Assets
Management Corp. in Taipei.  The yield on the 1.375 percent bond due March 2021 dropped
four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 1.317 percent,
according to Gretai Securities Market. That was the lowest level
for a benchmark 10-year security since Nov. 12.  “There’s not room for 10-year yields to drop much
further,” said Tu. “To me, the resistance level is 1.28
percent.”    Taiwan ’s dollar closed 0.1 percent lower at NT$29.574
against its U.S. counterpart, according to Taipei Forex Inc. The
currency reached NT$29.647 earlier, the weakest level since
March 3.  To contact the reporter on this story:
