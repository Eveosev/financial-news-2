Deutsche Bank AG’s South African
unit hired Anna Mulholland as head of precious metals research.  Mulholland, formerly Anglo American Plc’s head of investor
relations in  South Africa , will join April 4, Mike Gresty, the
local research chief for Deutsche Bank, said by phone today.  Mulholland, a chartered financial analyst who previously
worked as an equity analyst at Morgan Stanley, replaces Johann Steyn, who joined Citigroup Global Markets Ltd. last year as a

in the Financial Mail’s annual survey.  South African precious metals companies include  AngloGold
Ashanti Ltd. (ANG) , the world’s third-largest gold producer, and Anglo
Platinum Ltd., the largest platinum producer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
