The cost of insuring against
default on European corporate bonds rose, according to traders
of credit-default swaps.  Contracts on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 50
companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings climbed 3 basis
points to 412, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. at 7:30 a.m. in  London . The index is a benchmark for the cost of protecting
bonds against default and an increase signals deterioration in
perceptions of  credit quality .  The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings rose 0.5 basis point to 105.25. The
Markit iTraxx Financial Index of 25 banks and insurers rose 1.5
to 159 and the subordinated index was 2 higher at 280.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($14 million) of debt from default for five years
is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer face
value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
