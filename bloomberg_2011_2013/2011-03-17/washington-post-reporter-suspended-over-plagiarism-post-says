The Washington Post said it
suspended Pulitzer Prize-winner Sari Horwitz because she copied
material from the Arizona Republic newspaper.  Horwitz, who won a Pulitzer with colleague Scott Higham in
2002 and was part of two Pulitzer-winning teams from the Post in
1998 and 2007, joined the Post in 1984, and issued an apology
over what she said was “using another newspaper’s work as if it
were my own,” adding that she accepted the punishment.  Washington Post Executive Editor Marcus Brauchli said a
review of Horwitz’s work had not revealed any other examples of
plagiarism. The Post issued an apology to its readers on its
website on Wednesday and will repeat it in the print edition
today.  Post executives determined that Horwitz had used paragraphs
from the Republic over the investigation into Jared Lee
Loughner, accused of shooting Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords
and 18 others in Tucson in January.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:  Chris Peterson  at
