Blackstone Group LP doesn’t have
any investments in  Russia  “that I know of,” said John Studzinski, a senior managing director at the firm.  “We know the government is trying to make the environment
more friendly,” he said at the Bloomberg Link Hedge Fund
Conference in  London  today. Russia’s relative risk is “case by
case, industry by industry.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
