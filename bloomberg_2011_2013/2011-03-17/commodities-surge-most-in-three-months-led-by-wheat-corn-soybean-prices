Commodities rose the most in three
months, led by wheat and corn.  The Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of 19 raw materials
rose 7.71, or 2.3 percent, to 345.88 at 10:39 a.m. New York
time. A close at that level would mark the biggest gain since
Dec. 1.  Wheat rose as much as 5.7 percent, and corn jumped as much
as 4.9 percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
