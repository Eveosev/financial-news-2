  LG Electronics Inc. (066570)  still plans to
introduce an Android-based tablet computer in  Japan  this month,
even as the country grapples with the aftermath of its strongest
earthquake on record.  “There’s no reason to believe there will be any delay from
our previous estimate,” Ken Hong, a Seoul-based spokesman for
the world’s third-largest handset maker, said by telephone
today.    NTT Docomo Inc. (9437) , the exclusive Japanese carrier for LG’s
Optimus Pad, started taking advance orders for the model on
March 15 as initially planned, and shipments will begin by the
end of the month, said Naoko Minobe, a spokeswoman for Docomo.  Japan is one of the first markets where the tablet
computer, sporting an 8.9-inch touch screen and running the
latest version of  Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s Android operating system, will
go on sale. LG unveiled the tablet, its first using Android, in
Barcelona last month.    Apple Inc. (AAPL)  is delaying its initial plan to release the iPad
2 in Japan on March 25. No new date has been set,  Natalie Kerris , a spokeswoman for Apple, said March 15.  To contact the reporters on this story:
