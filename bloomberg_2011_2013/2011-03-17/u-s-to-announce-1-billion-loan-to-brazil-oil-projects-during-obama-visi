The U.S. Export-Import Bank plans
to provide a loan of $1 billion for deep-water oil exploration
in  Brazil , the  Valor  newspaper reported, without saying where it
got the information.  The bank will also help finance Brazilian infrastructure
projects for the 2014 World Cup and 2016 Olympics, the Sao
Paulo-based newspaper said today. The bank plans to announce the
loans during President Barack Obamaâ€™s visit to Brazil this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
