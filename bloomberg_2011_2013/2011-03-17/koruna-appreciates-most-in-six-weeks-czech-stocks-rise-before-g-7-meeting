The Czech Republic’s main equity
index rose from its lowest in almost three months and the koruna
strengthened to the euro as  Japan  moved closer to containing its
nuclear crisis, restoring investors’ demand for risk worldwide.  The PX stock gauge rose 0.4 percent at its 4:28 p.m. close
in  Prague , with  Erste Group Bank AG (EBS)  and coal company  New World
Resources NV (NWR)  among the biggest gainers. The koruna appreciated
0.6 percent to 24.372 per euro, snapping a three-day selloff.  European and U.S. equities jumped as Tokyo Electric Power
Co. said it may connect a power cable to the Fukushima nuclear
plant as workers try to restart the cooling system and prevent a
meltdown. Group of Seven officials will discuss ways to help the
world’s third-largest economy after the March 11 earthquake.  “No bad news has come from  Asia  today, which was enough to
significantly improve investor sentiment,” Miroslav Adamkovic,
an analyst at Komercni Banka AS, the Prague-based unit of
Societe Generale SA, wrote in a report today.  NWR, the biggest Czech supplier of coal to steelmakers,
rose 1.4 percent to 271.8 koruna, its highest close since March
8.  CEZ AS (CEZ) , the country’s biggest power producer, added less than
0.1 percent to 824.5 koruna, its third day of gains and its
highest closing price since Feb. 25.  To contact the reporter on this story:
