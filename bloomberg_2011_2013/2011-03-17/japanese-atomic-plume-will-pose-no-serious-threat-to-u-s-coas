Radiation wafting toward the U.S.
from stricken nuclear reactors in  Japan  poses far less threat
than 1950s-era atomic weapons testing or the 1986 Chernobyl
accident, weather and public health experts said.  The radiation plume from the reactors is moving northeast
over the Pacific, the Austrian Meteorological and Geophysics
Center reported on its website. Weather patterns over the ocean
will bring it to the U.S. today or tomorrow, said  Jeff Masters ,
co-founder of  Weather Underground  Inc. in  Ann Arbor ,  Michigan .  Even in a worst-case scenario of a reactor meltdown at the
Fukushima plant, dilution of the radiation by the Jet Stream and
Pacific winds is likely to prevent harmful radiation from
reaching the West Coast, said Thomas McKone, an adjunct
professor in the Department of Environmental Health Sciences at
the  University of California , Berkeley.  “There is enormous dilution between Japan and here,” said
McCone, who is also a senior staff scientist at the U.S. Energy
Department’s  Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory . “I don’t
think there can be any measurable health impacts in
California.”  After Chernobyl, experts found no measurable health effects
to humans from direct radiation exposure outside of a 50-mile
radius, according to McKone. Bombs tested in the U.S. in the
1950s and 1960s released much more radiation than is coming from
the Fukushima plant, crippled by Japan’s largest earthquake on
record and the resulting tsunami, Masters said.  Comparing Fallout  “It is hard to compare a bomb going off up in the air over  Nevada  with something 5,000 miles away in Japan at the
surface,” Masters said. “The exposure was far, far greater
from the Nevada test explosions.”  More than 500 atmospheric nuclear weapons tests were
conducted worldwide prior to 1963, according to the U.S. Centers
for Disease Control. The  U.S. government , in a study that
included the CDC and the  National Cancer Institute , estimated in
2006 that anyone living in the lower 48 states after 1951 had
been exposed to some fallout.  About 50 deaths have been directly attributed to radiation
from Chernobyl, while 4,000 may eventually die from the side
effects of exposure, mostly from cancer or related disease,
according to a 2005 World Health Organization report.  Radiation particles released into the air from the Japanese
reactor vessels and spent-fuel ponds are moving southeast before
extending in a northeasterly pattern over the Pacific. Particles
may start moving northwest as the winds are expected to shift.  Particles in Plume  Radioactive barium, cesium, iodine and tellurium have been
detected in the plume, the Austrian agency said. A partially
dispersed cloud passed through the Tokyo area yesterday,
according to the Austrian center.  “Whether it will be even detectable” when it arrives in
the U.S. “is a question in my mind because of the amount of
dispersion that goes on over at least a 5,000-mile track that
that stuff had to take,” said Masters. “It just wasn’t emitted
in large enough quantities to be a threat to human health and it
may not even be detectable.”    California  Governor  Jerry Brown  said the state is
monitoring the situation. His spokeswoman, Elizabeth Ashford,
said that “at this point, there is no risk to California from
radiation.”  That hasn’t stopped fear from spreading, said Kirk Smith, a
professor at the University of California School of Public
Health at Berkeley who has studied the fallout from Chernobyl
and the health risks of radiation.  Moving East  Smith said some of his students have discussed moving to
Denver to get away from fallout, unaware that exposure to
naturally occurring daily radiation is higher in mountainous  Colorado  than at  sea level  in California.  “The radiation you get on a flight to Denver would be far
higher than anything that could come from Japan,” Smith said.    San Francisco  residents have rushed to stores to buy
potassium iodide pills, which can protect against
radiation exposure, said Eileen Shields, a spokeswoman for the
city  Public Health  Department.  “People are wasting their money and there is no reason to
do it because there is no radiation level sufficient to merit
this,” Shields said. The Johns Hopkins Office of  Critical Event
Preparedness and Response  warned that the drug may have serious
side effects for people with certain allergies and kidney and
thyroid problems.  The state of California and  Los Angeles  County may put up
additional radiation monitors to assess the situation, said
Chris Ipsen, division chief for the city of Los Angeles’s
emergency management department.  California Watch  The best chance to detect the radiation in California may
come next week when the plume mixes with storm systems coming
ashore along the coast, said Masters, who before founding
 Weather Underground  tracked acid rain and air pollution.  “That would be the most likely time for it to get to the
ground and be detectable,” Masters said. “But again, the
amounts are going to be pretty darn small.”  Tracking a plume isn’t an exact science, said Sue Haupt,
scientific program manager at the  National Center for
Atmospheric Research  in Boulder, Colorado, and a meteorology
professor and researcher at  Pennsylvania  State University.  The mapping requires computer models, and variables include
the height of the release as well as the weather patterns it
encounters.  Complicated Patterns  Weather over the Pacific can be complicated, said Jim
Andrews, a senior forecaster for AccuWeather Inc. in  State
College , Pennsylvania.  The Jet Stream is always dipping and buckling, so anything
being carried on the wind could be blown over a wide area. In
addition, winds at different levels of the atmosphere blow in
different directions, which may shear apart a cloud of
radiation, he said.  “Certainly the weather is going to play a large factor,
otherwise the size of the particle will dictate how long it is
going to take to settle” to the surface, said David Stauffer, a
meteorology professor at Penn State. “The larger ones will fall
out quicker than the smaller ones.”  While plumes of radiation linked to the Chernobyl explosion
were detected all over the world, the amount at places such as  Hawaii  was less than the  radiation exposure  from a chest X-ray,
Smith said.  “Radiation is odd, and it has this terrible history of
being born in secrecy and war,” Smith said. “We are capable of
measuring extremely small amounts, but just because you can
measure it doesn’t mean it’s dangerous.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
