Three Pakistani cricketers will
stand trial in  London  on May 20 over charges they conspired to
take payments to fix a Test match against England last year.  Former captain  Salman Butt , 26, and fast bowlers Mohammad
Amir, 18, and Mohammad Asif, 28, were present at Westminster
Magistrates Court where Senior District Judge Howard Riddle
ordered that they and agent Mazhar Majeed, 35, return to a U.K.
court for trial.  The three players were given unconditional bail and Majeed,
a U.K. resident, was told to surrender his passport as part of
bail conditions.  The four men were arrested and charged with “conspiracy to
obtain and accept corrupt payments and also a conspiracy to
cheat” following incidents during a Test match against  England 
in August.  U.K. prosecutors said Majeed accepted money to arrange for
the players to bowls “no balls” on Aug. 26 and 27 during the
fourth cricket Test against England at Lord’s Cricket Ground in
London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
