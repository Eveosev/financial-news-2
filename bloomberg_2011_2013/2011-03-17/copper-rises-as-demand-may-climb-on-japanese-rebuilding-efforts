Copper jumped the most in 10 months
on speculation that demand may increase as  Japan  rebuilds after
last week’s earthquake and tsunami.  Reconstruction and refurbishing of damaged plants,
buildings and infrastructure should lead to greater commodity
consumption, particularly building materials, James Steel, an
analyst at HSBC Securities in New York, said in a report this
week.  “Base metals will definitely benefit from the ultimate
reconstruction effort when it gets under way,” said Nic Brown,
an analyst at Natixis Commodity Markets Ltd. in  London . “There
is a danger that it may take longer for that reconstruction
effort to materialize than the base-metals market may
anticipate.”  Copper futures for May delivery rose 14.65 cents, or 3.5
percent, to settle at $4.334 a pound at 1:16 p.m. on the Comex
in  New York , the biggest gain since May 21. The metal climbed to
a record of $4.6575 on Feb. 15.  On the London Metal Exchange, copper for delivery in three
months gained $285, or 3.1 percent, to $9,545 a metric ton
($4.32 a pound) at 6:11 p.m. local time.  Aluminum, lead, nickel, zinc and tin also increased in
London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
