Japanese policy makers, battling
their country’s worst crisis since World War II, may need to
move faster to weaken the yen and shore up stocks if they are to
avoid a deeper economic slump.  The yen jumped yesterday to a post-war high and the  Nikkei
225 (NKY)  Stock Average extended its slide since the March 11
earthquake and tsunami to 14 percent as workers try to prevent a
meltdown at a nuclear plant north of Tokyo. Investors are now on
guard for an intervention to weaken the yen as Group of Seven
finance chiefs prepare to meet via conference call today at 7
a.m. Tokyo time.  While the  Bank of Japan  will pump in an extra 5 trillion
yen ($60 billion) of stimulus, former central bank and World
Bank officials yesterday urged bolder measures. As Japan teeters
on the edge of another recession, the additional money is just
one-tenth the amount the U.S. Federal Reserve is injecting into
its economy through quantitative easing.  “It feels like the ground is crumbling beneath us,” said
Masaaki Kanno, who used to work at the BOJ for a quarter of a
century and is now chief  Japan  economist at JPMorgan Chase & Co.
in Tokyo. “This is a psychological war, and I don’t understand
why the government hasn’t moved yet, and why the BOJ hasn’t come
out with something extraordinary.”  ‘Epic Calamity’  The currency’s rise against the dollar yesterday, which
extended gains over the past week to 5 percent, was driven by
speculation and the government is monitoring its moves, Economy
Minister Kaoru Yosano said.  Investors are nevertheless concerned that policy makers are
proving too timid, according to  Tim Condon , Singapore-based head
of Asia research with ING Groep NV. Economists at BNP Paribas SA
say the economy will shrink 1.2 percent this year, having
previously forecast growth of 1.6 percent.  “This isn’t a central bank that’s likely to act boldly --
it has presided over 20 years of deflation,” said Condon, who
formerly worked for the  World Bank . “An epic calamity has
struck the economy and the risk is that a conservative monetary
policy response intensifies deflation pressure and deepens the
economic downturn.”  Coordinated Intervention  The decision of the G-7 to confer has prompted speculation
that the BOJ may soon start selling the yen, perhaps with the
support of its counterparts, in what would amount to the first
coordinated intervention since September 2000’s united effort to
lift the euro. A rising yen hurts the overseas competitiveness
of Japanese exporters.  Japan may seek the G-7’s blessing to intervene and “it
will be easy to gain international support” for it to stabilize
the market, said  Masafumi Yamamoto , chief currency strategist at
Barclays Bank Plc in Tokyo.    Shane Oliver , head of investment strategy in Sydney at AMP
Capital Investors Ltd, which manages $98 billion, said there is
even a “very strong case to be made for broad, coordinated
intervention” because the yen’s rise “makes it tougher for
manufacturers in already very tough circumstances, risking
making the economic setback deeper.”  Japan last intervened in September when it sold 2.12
trillion yen in the first such operation since 2004. The yen
still continued to climb and that means the “focus now is
whether preparations are in place for a concerted
intervention,” Naohiko Baba, chief Japan economist at Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. in Tokyo, wrote in a report yesterday.  G-7 Statement  There are parallels with October 2008 when the collapse of
Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. spurred demand for the yen. On
that occasion, the G-7 took no action other than to issue a
statement in which it expressed concern “about the recent
excessive volatility in the exchange rate of the yen and its
possible adverse implications for economic and financial
stability.”  “The G-7 gave the green light for action on the yen a long
time ago,” said  Geoffrey Yu , a currency strategist at UBS AG in  London . “This statement has never been rescinded.”  The G-7’s reluctance to act in markets during the past
decade may reflect the realization that its ability to influence
them has diminished as daily foreign-exchange trading more than
doubled from $1.7 trillion in 1998. Since 2003, the group has
advocated currencies be set in markets free of government
interference and members may also be concerned that any
intervention would undermine its calls for  China  to stop
restraining its yuan.  ‘Last Resort’  Joint intervention “is the last resort because central
banks still question whether this works or not,” said Yu.  Japanese Finance Minister  Yoshihiko Noda  will use today’s
call to outline how the world’s third-biggest economy has been
affected by the March 11 quake and tsunami, he told reporters
yesterday. French Finance Minister  Christine Lagarde  said the
previous day that the aim of the call was to “see how we can
purchase their bonds and how to respond on the financial
level.”  The yen is surging as the risk of radiation leaks from the
crippled nuclear plant stoke prospects Japanese insurers and
investors will redeem overseas assets to pay for damages.  The BOJ yesterday added 6 trillion yen to the financial
system to help ease liquidity, bringing the total size of
emergency one-day operations this week to 34 trillion yen. On
March 14, it doubled to 10 trillion yen a program to buy assets
such as government and corporate debt, exchange-traded funds and
real-estate investment trusts. It also maintains a 30 trillion
yen fund to encourage banks to increase lending.  The 40 trillion yen total should be boosted to 100 trillion
yen, according to JPMorgan Chase’s Kanno. “The BOJ doesn’t need
to actually use all that money -- the important thing is to get
that number 100 trillion out in the news and induce a sense of
safety,” he said.  To contact the Bloomberg News staff on this story:
