Japan may cooperate with the U.S.
and Europe to intervene in the  currency markets  after the yen
rose to a record high against the dollar today, according to
Mizuho Securities Co.  Should Group-of-Seven nations agree that the yen is showing
excessive volatility and disorderly movements, “that may lead
to joint intervention by Japan, the U.S. and Europe to sell yen
for dollars and euros,”  Yasunari Ueno , chief market economist
at the unit of Japan’s second-largest bank, wrote in a report
published today.  The yen reached a post-World War II high of 76.36 per
dollar today on concern radiation leaks will worsen from
crippled nuclear plants after Japan’s strongest earthquake on
record. The currency erased gains amid speculation Japanese
policy makers will intervene to weaken the currency.  The yen traded at 79.63 as of 10:28 a.m. in  Tokyo  from the
79.59 close yesterday in New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
