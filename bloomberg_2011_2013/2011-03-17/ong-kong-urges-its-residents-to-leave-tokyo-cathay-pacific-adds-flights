  Hong Kong ’s government urged its
residents leaving in  Tokyo  to return home or move to southern  Japan , joining warnings from the U.S. and the U.K. as the crisis
deepens at an earthquake-damaged nuclear plant.  People should leave “due to the evolving situation at the
Fukushima nuclear facility and disruptions to transport, power
and other infrastructure in Tokyo,” Hong Kong’s government said
in a statement posted on its website yesterday evening. The city
said it is arranging for additional flights to leave from
Tokyo’s Narita airport.  Tokyo Electric Power Co.’s failure to end the threat of
radiation from the Fukushima plant, located 220 kilometers (135
miles) north of Tokyo, has also prompted France, Germany and
Australia to advise their citizens to consider leaving the city.    Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd. (293) , based in Hong Kong, added
services from Tokyo yesterday and today, with both flights
leaving Narita at 9:50 p.m. local time, according to an e-mailed
statement from the carrier earlier yesterday. Cathay has offered
discounted one-way tickets for people seeking to leave.  Those from Hong Kong who need to stay in Tokyo should
register with the Chinese city’s Immigration Department,
according to the statement. The city’s Security Department has a
red, or “significant threat” warning on travel to all of
Japan, with a black, or “severe threat,” rating on the four
prefectures most affected by the earthquake.  To contact the reporter on this story::
