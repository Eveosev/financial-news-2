The Bank of  Japan  deserves praise
for its policy response to the nation’s worst earthquake and
ensuing nuclear crisis, said  Norman Chan , chief executive of the
Hong Kong Monetary Authority.  “The BOJ has done quite a lot by injecting unprecedented
amounts of liquidity into the system,” Chan said in response to
questions during a panel discussion in Sydney today. “The BOJ
has done what it can.”  Japan’s central bank has injected 33 trillion yen ($417
billion) into the banking system this week, trying to settle
markets after the earthquake March 11 that triggered a tsunami
which killed thousands and damaged a nuclear plant on the
northeastern coast.  Finance ministers and central bankers of the Group of Seven
industrial nations will hold talks tomorrow to discuss the
aftermath of the quake, Japanese Finance Minister  Yoshihiko Noda 
said in  Tokyo  today.  Chan said that while it’s the duty of monetary authorities
and central banks to make sure markets remain orderly, they
shouldn’t try to prevent them from gyrating during crises.  “They key question is to ensure that during those swings,
which are inevitable in unusual circumstances, the integrity of
the market remains intact,” he said.  Chan, who was in Sydney to attend a forum on trading with  China , said that nation’s approach to full convertibility for
its currency would be an “incremental” process.  “If you are looking for a concrete timetable you will be
disappointed,” he said. “The Chinese approach is incremental,
trial-and-error, and one step at a time.”  Offshore Center    Hong Kong  is seeking to grow as an offshore center for yuan
trading, as Chinese Premier  Wen Jiabao  allows the currency to
become more readily available beyond China’s borders to reduce
reliance on U.S. dollars in trade and finance.  Yuan deposits in Hong Kong rose 18 percent from December to
a record 370.6 billion yuan ($56 billion) in January, according
to the HKMA, as policy makers prepared to allow companies to
sell yuan-denominated shares in the city and to let funds invest
in the mainland’s debt markets.  Sales in the city of yuan-denominated debt, known as dim
sum bonds, totaled 13.3 billion yuan in the first two months of
the year compared with zero in the same period of 2010. The
amount of local-currency debt issued in  Shanghai  rose 13 percent
to 267.5 billion yuan.  To contact the reporters on this story:
