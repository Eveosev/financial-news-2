Britons will experience one of the
largest falls in income in the developed world when they stop
working unless they save more and retire later, the  Organization
for Economic Cooperation and Development  said.  The Paris-based OECD’s pensions report, published today,
said the average net replacement rate, which measures how post-
retirement income compares with pre-retirement income, is 69
percent for its 34 member countries. For the U.K., it’s 42
percent. Only Mexico, Ireland and  Japan  have a lower rate.  Greece  tops the league with a rate of 111 percent.  “The U.K. ticks the boxes for financial sustainability and
having a diversified system,” Edward Whitehouse, the report’s
author, said in a telephone interview. “Where it falls down is
on the adequacy of the pensions. If people don’t save, they’re
going to have a fairly miserable time in retirement.”  Both the previous Labour government and the current
Conservative-led coalition have tried to deal with the
shortfall. Starting in 2012, the U.K. will move to an “opt-
out” system, in which employees are enrolled in private savings
plans by default, putting aside 8 percent of their incomes. The  retirement age  is also set to rise.  To contact the reporter on this story:
