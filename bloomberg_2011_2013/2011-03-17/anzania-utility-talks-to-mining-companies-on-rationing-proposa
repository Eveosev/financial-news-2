Tanzania Electric Supply Co ., the
state-run electricity utility, is talking to mine operators on a
parliamentary panel’s proposal to ration power to the industry.  “Management is now talking to miners and all other
stakeholders on the issue,” Badra Masoud, a spokesman for the
power generator, said by phone from  Dar es Salaam  today.  Tanesco, as the company is known, is rationing power after
a drought cut water at hydropower plants, reducing generation to
470 megawatts, from capacity of 1,000 megawatts. A parliamentary
panel proposed cutting power to miners by at least 30 megawatts.
African Barrick Gold Ltd., a unit of the world’s biggest gold
producer, is among companies operating in the country.  “It is something we do not expect to happen,” Chamber of
Minerals and Energy Executive Secretary Emmanuel Jengo said in
e-mailed response to questions today. “To request the mining
companies to relinquish almost 50 percent of the power they need
is the same as asking the industry to shut down.”  The government would lose about 6.2 billion Tanzanian
shillings ($4.1 million) in royalties and 4.8 billion shillings
in taxes a month as a result, he said.  Tanzania is  Africa ’s fourth-biggest gold producer.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
