  Deutsche Lufthansa AG (LHA) ,  Europe ’s
second-biggest airline, said it aims to increase earnings and
sales this year as economic growth improves.  Lufthansa’s main airline brand will probably increase
operating profit from 382 million euros ($536 million) in 2010
as spending reductions help make up for higher fuel prices and
political turmoil that may limit traffic gains, the carrier said
today in its  annual report .  Net income totaled 1.1 billion euros last year, the
Cologne, Germany-based airline’s biggest profit since 2007,
helped by a worldwide recovery in  air travel , higher fares on
long-distance flights and a one-time tax gain of 400 million
euros, the company said March 9. Lufthansa is trying to restore
earnings at its Austrian Airlines and BMI units, acquired in
2009, by cutting jobs and switching to more profitable routes.  “The result looks fundamentally very good, especially the
contribution from the Lufthansa brand passenger division,” said
Hartmut Moers, a Dusseldorf, Germany-based analyst at WestLB AG
with an “add” recommendation on the shares. “The vague
outlook is no surprise and not owed to current uncertainties -
it’s simply been company policy.”  Lufthansa rose as much as 2.1 percent to 13.85 euros and
was up 0.3 percent as of 11:16 a.m. in  Frankfurt  trading. The
stock has declined 17 percent, valuing the company at 6.23
billion euros.  Main Brand’s Targets  The Lufthansa-brand passenger division has a goal of
reducing costs by 1 billion euros from 2008 through 2011. The
unit’s operating profit, defined as revenue minus expenses and
excluding gains or costs from asset sales, will be helped by at
least 350 million euros in savings from the cost-cutting program
this year, Lufthansa said.  The Austrian Airlines unit aims to become profitable this
year, with the BMI division in the U.K. aiming for profit in the
mid-term, the company said.  Lufthansa said yesterday that it’s ordering 30 planes from
Airbus SAS’s A320neo series, a model based on the aircraft
manufacturer’s current A320 lineup that will be equipped with
engines that burn 15 percent less kerosene. Delivery is
scheduled to start in 2016. Lufthansa also ordered five  Boeing
Co. (BA)  777-model cargo aircraft.  Chief Executive Officer Christoph Franz, who succeeded  Wolfgang Mayrhuber  as head of Lufthansa on Jan. 1, set an 8
percent operating-margin target for the namesake brand in
September, when he was still running the division. The airline
and unions for pilots, ground and cabin personnel have agreed on
pay freezes over the last 12 months.  ‘Rougher’ Competition  “2011 will not be a walk in the park,” as “the headwinds
of competition are becoming rougher,” Franz said today at a
news conference in Frankfurt. “The Lufthansa group will face up
to these challenges and maintain a successful course.”  Yield, a measure of fares based on revenue per passenger
and distance flown, increased 8.4 percent last year, led by
18 percent gains on flights serving the Americas,  Asia  and the
Pacific, Chief Financial Officer Stephan Gemkow said at the news
conference. Yield in Europe fell 3.6 percent. Lufthansa foresees
“no recovery” in ticket pricing in the region for 2011, the
CFO said.  Industrywide earnings are bound to slump almost 50 percent
this year as higher  oil prices  limit the effects of a recovering
economy, the  International Air Transport Association  forecast
March 2.  Fuel Costs  Lufthansa increased its forecast for fuel costs in 2011 to
6.8 billion euros from an earlier prediction of 6.5 billion
euros. Spending on jet kerosene totaled 5.2 billion euros in
2010. With 71 percent fuel costs fixed by hedging contracts for
2011 and 26 percent for 2012, the company profits if the market
price of crude oil is at least $91 a barrel, Gemkow said. That
compares with earlier hedging protecting Lufthansa at
$88 a barrel.  Lufthansa’s earnings in 2010 were held back by pilot
strikes, a Europewide flight ban resulting from an ash-cloud
emanating from an Icelandic volcano in the second quarter and
heavy snowfall at in the region at the end of the year.  The carrier is “extremely worried” about the situation in  Japan  following the March 11 earthquake, Franz said today.
Political unrest in the Middle East poses a risk to BMI’s target
of earning a profit in 2012, Gemkow said.  The company is restoring the dividend at 60 cents a share
after dropping the payout a year earlier. Lufthansa said today
that conditions for paying a dividend for 2011 “should also be
fulfilled.”  Former CEO Mayrhuber’s pay and bonuses last year increased
to 3.5 million euros from 2.5 million euros in 2009. Franz and
Gemkow each earned about 2.4 million euros in 2010, while Stefan Lauer, the head of the company’s airlines based outside  Germany ,
received compensation of 2.5 million euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
