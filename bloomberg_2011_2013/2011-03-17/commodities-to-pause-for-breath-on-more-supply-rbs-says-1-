Commodity prices will “pause for
breath” this year and next as producers boost output amid
higher prices, while gold, silver and coal are set to decline,
Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc said.  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Total Return Index of 24
commodities this month reached the highest level since November
2008 as tension in the Middle East and North Africa boosted
crude oil above $100 a barrel and pushed gold prices to a
record. “Renewed pricing tension” will return in 2013 and
aluminum, copper, palladium and platinum may perform best
through 2014, the bank said in a report dated yesterday.  Higher commodity prices are often viewed as an inflation
signal. Asian countries from  China  to Indonesia raised  interest
rates  this year to curb rising consumer prices, and higher oil
prices may limit economic growth, RBS said. The  Federal Reserve 
and the  European Central Bank  may increase borrowing costs by
the end of 2012, the bank said, adding that the top 20 mining
companies will spend more than $80 billion this year.  “Many producers have fat operating margins and are awash
with cash,”  Nick Moore , head of commodity strategy in London,
said in the report. “Volume growth is the new mantra. Against
this now-unstoppable supply surge, the world is not a happy
place. The market frets about a slowing Chinese economy, rising
world inflation and the fallout from events in Japan.”  Quake, Tsunami  The S&P GSCI index dropped 3.8 percent on March 15, the
most since July 2009, as Japanese authorities battled to contain
a nuclear accident north of  Tokyo  after the country’s strongest-
ever earthquake and subsequent tsunami last week.  Coking-coal and thermal-coal supplies will increase 39
percent and 35 percent through 2014, respectively, RBS
estimated. Aluminum and nickel supply will climb 31 percent and
iron-ore output will rise 26 percent, it said.  Gold for immediate delivery reached a record $1,444.95 an
ounce on March 7 and traded at $1,399.93 at 11:33 a.m. in London
today. Prices will average $1,350 this year and $1,300 next
year, RBS said. Silver traded at $34.41 an ounce and will
average $27.50 this year, the bank said.  Benchmark interest rates may climb to 3.25 percent by the
end of 2012 for the Fed and 2.75 percent for the ECB, the report
shows.  To contact the reporter on this story:  Nicholas Larkin  in  London  at
