Bulgaria’s economy may grow as much
as 3.2 percent this year, driven by exports,  EFG Eurobank
Ergasias SA (EUROB)  said, raising its estimate after the government
revised fourth-quarter gross domestic product figures higher.  GDP may expand 3.2 percent, rather than the previous
prediction of 2.5 percent, Platon Monokroussos, the chief
economist at Eurobank,  Greece ’s second-largest lender, said at a
conference in Sofia today.  Bulgaria, the  European Union’s  poorest country in terms of
per-capita GDP, is recovering from its worst recession in more
than a decade after a three-year lending boom stalled and
foreign investment dried up during the global credit crisis. The
economy expanded 2.8 percent from a year earlier in the fourth
quarter, compared with a preliminary estimate of 2.1 percent,
the statistics office said on March 11.  "The fourth-quarter data are encouraging and we feel that
it is possible to have economic growth exceeding 3 percent this
year,’’ Monokroussos said. "That is provided there are no
serious external shocks."  The government forecasts 3.6 percent growth this year after
0.2 percent in 2010 and a 5.1 percent contraction in 2009. The
country is counting on public spending and demand for its
exports in metals, machinery, textiles and furniture to drive
GDP.  Exports, which account for 57.8 percent of GDP, rose 16
percent from a year ago after a preliminary estimate of a 10.7
percent gain in the fourth quarter and an 18.5 percent increase
in the previous three months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
