  Consumer confidence  in Kenya, East
Africa’s biggest economy, declined in February amid concern
about fuel and food prices, drought and a weakening currency, a
survey showed.  The consumer confidence index compiled by TNS Research
International East Africa dropped to 118 from 136 in September,
Melissa Baker, chief executive officer of the group, said in a
phone interview today from Nairobi, the capital.  Kenya’s shilling depreciated to a 17-year low in March,
while inflation accelerated for the fourth consecutive month to
6.5 percent in February after transport costs jumped 13 percent,
the country’s National Bureau of Statistics said on Feb. 28.
International Criminal Court Chief Prosecutor Luis Moreno-Ocampo
initiated an investigation into six senior politicians accused
of post-election violence in 2008, spurring concern that further
unrest may ensue.  “A lot of people are fearing problems resulting from the
Ocampo 6,” Baker said.    Kenya ’s Energy Regulatory Commission on March 14 set
maximum retail prices for regular gasoline at 100.9 shillings
($1.17) a liter (0.26 gallons) in the capital, Nairobi, an
increase of 2.8 percent from the previous month.  Much of Kenya, the world’s biggest black-tea exporter, will
probably receive below normal rainfall during the March-to-May
long rainy season, crimping agricultural production, the  Kenya
Meteorological Department  said March 8.  To contact the reporter on this story:
