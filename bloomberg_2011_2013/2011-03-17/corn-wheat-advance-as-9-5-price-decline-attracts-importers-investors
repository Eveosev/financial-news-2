Wheat and corn climbed in  Chicago 
on signs that declines after last week’s earthquake and tsunami
in Japan are spurring demand from importers and end-users.  Wheat for May delivery rose 2.5 percent to $6.785 a bushel
at 12:45 p.m. Paris time on the Chicago Board of Trade, paring a
gain of as much as 3.2 percent. Milling wheat traded on NYSE
Liffe in Paris added as much as 3.5 percent.  Grain consumers are taking advantage of falling prices by
making purchases to cover their needs for the remainder of the
2010-11 season, according to Agritel, a Paris-based company that
advises more than 2,000 farmers on buying and selling their
crops.  “End-users snapped up purchases after values tumbled,
which is helping prices,” said Han Sung Min, a senior trader at
Korea Exchange Bank Futures Co. in  Seoul . “The rebound may be
short-lived because investors remain jittery, monitoring to what
extent the disaster will impact the market.”  Corn for May delivery added 1.5 percent to $6.26 a bushel
in Chicago after rising as much as 2 percent earlier.  “From a fundamental view, the U.S. corn situation remains
critical, with stocks expected to be at extremely low levels at
the start of the season,” Agritel said. “All the more because
ethanol production continues to show an ongoing vigor that adds
to the fundamental tension in the market.”  Corn Inventories  Global corn stockpiles will drop for a third consecutive
season in the year through June 2012 as record world production
fails to satisfy rising demand, the International Grains Council
forecast last month. Inventories before the next harvest will
equal 15 percent of demand, the least since 1974, according to
U.S. Department of Agriculture data.  Soybeans for May delivery rose 1.5 percent to $13.0625 a
bushel after yesterday gaining 1.3 percent, the most since March
2. The price for the most-active contract fell 5.7 percent this
month before today.  As much as 2 inches of rain in the past 24 hours left
soybean fields too wet for harvesting in  Brazil , the second-
biggest exporter of the oilseed, World Weather Inc. said in a
report yesterday.  Feed makers including the Korea Feed Association in  South
Korea , the world’s third-biggest corn buyer, purchased 110,000
metric tons of corn and 165,000 tons of soybean meal in tenders
yesterday. The Major Feedmill Group plans to buy 190,000 tons of
corn in a tender today, the most sought by the group in a single
bidding since August.  Radiation Risk  Corn slumped 9.7 percent in the four sessions through
yesterday and wheat plunged 11 percent on speculation that the
March 11 earthquake, the subsequent tsunami and the risk of
radiation from a damaged nuclear plant would reduce demand from  Japan . The country is the world’s biggest buyer of corn.  May-delivery milling wheat rose 5.75 euros to 212 euros a
ton in Paris. The grain added 1.6 percent yesterday after
falling 13 percent in the preceding three sessions.  “As we get close to the 200-euro level for the May 2011
expiry, some buyers are taking positions,” Agritel said.  “Wheat buyers were still very much present in the ports,”
Bourges, France-based farm adviser Offre & Demande Agricole said
in a comment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
