The U.S. State Department said its
first evacuation charter flight left  Japan  today with fewer than
100 people aboard.  The flight, bound for Taipei, was the first of several
planned for family members and dependents of State Department
personnel stationed in the northeastern region of Japan, which
suffered major damage from an earthquake and tsunami.  One or two additional flights are likely tomorrow,
Undersecretary of State for Management Patrick Kennedy said at a
briefing for reporters.  The department also has chartered 14 buses that are en
route to the Sendai area for U.S. residents and tourists who
wish to leave, Kennedy said. Those buses will take U.S. citizens
to Tokyo for flights out of Japan.  There are an estimated 350,000 U.S. residents in Japan,
including about 90,000 in the  Tokyo  area, Kennedy said.  All State Department personnel are expected to continue to
report to work, he said.  The magnitude-9 earthquake that struck Japan March 11
caused a 7-meter (23-foot) tsunami that engulfed the northeast
coast. More than 5,400 people have been confirmed dead,
according to the  National Police Agency .  There have been no reports of any American deaths, Kennedy
said. State Department spokesman Mark Toner said there are no
plans to move the U.S. embassy from Tokyo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
