  Germany ’s GDL train drivers union
lost a legal battle to take strike action in the north of the
country,  Die Welt  reported today, citing a labor judge.  The union can’t strike until negotiations with privately
held Nord-Ostsee-Bahn have been completed or collapse, Judge
Sabine Goeldner-Dahmke said, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
