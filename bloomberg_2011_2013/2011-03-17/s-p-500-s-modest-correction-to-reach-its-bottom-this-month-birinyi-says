The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
will fall to 1,232 by March 31, marking the bottom of a “modest
correction,” according to Birinyi Associates Inc., which cited
data measuring average drops of at least 5 percent since 1945.  The decrease would represent a 3.3 percent retreat from
today’s close of 1,273.72. When the  S&P 500  loses 5 percent
during a rallying period, the decline lasts an average of 41
days and extends to 8.3 percent, according to a report today by
Cleve Rueckert, an analyst at Birinyi Associates. The S&P 500
peaked this year at 1,343.01 on Feb. 18, its highest level since
June 2008. It has since fallen 5.2 percent, paring gains since
March 9, 2009, to 88 percent.  “History suggests that the current decline will be short-
lived, and most likely presents a buying opportunity,” the
Westport, Connecticut-based research and money-management firm
said in a report today.    Thomas Lee , equity strategist at JPMorgan Chase & Co., and
Mary Ann Bartels of Bank of America Corp. also said this week
that U.S. equities are poised to climb. Birinyi was one of the
first to tell clients to buy as the S&P 500 fell to its 12-year
low in March 2009 and has held a bullish outlook since then,
saying stocks are in the midst of a “multi-year” rally and may
climb as high as 2,854 by 2013, based on past bull cycles.  S&P 500 Gains  The S&P 500 climbed 1.3 percent to 1,273.72 at 4 p.m. in
New York, the first advance of the week. The  Dow Jones
Industrial Average  climbed 1.4 percent to 11,774.59.  While the average 5 percent decline leads to an 8.3 percent
drop for the benchmark equity index, Birinyi said a correction
forms 33 percent of the time and becoming a  bear market  is
“even less likely,” according to the report. Slides that lead
to bear markets have occurred in 10 percent of the cases. A
correction is often defined as a 10 percent drop.  Laszlo Birinyi, the firm’s founder, said in December that
the S&P 500 may climb to 1,333 in 2011. The firm said in its
February report that may be conservative, as “2011 has gotten
off to a positive start.” The index is forecast to rally 11
percent to 1,400 from yesterday’s close, according to the
average projection of 13 strategists surveyed by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
