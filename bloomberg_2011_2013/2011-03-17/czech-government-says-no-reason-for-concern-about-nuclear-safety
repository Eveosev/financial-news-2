The Czech government sees no reason
for concern about the safety of the country’s two nuclear
plants, Prime Minister Petr Necas said.  “There is absolutely no reason for switching off Temelin
and Dukovany,” Necas said today at a press conference in
Prague. “It would provoke an economic collapse.”    CEZ AS (CEZ) , the state-controlled utility, will go ahead with
plans to expand the Temelin plant, Necas said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
