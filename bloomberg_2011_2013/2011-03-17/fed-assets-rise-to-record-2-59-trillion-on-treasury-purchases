The  Federal Reserve ’s total assets
rose by $5.98 billion to $2.59 trillion, the seventh consecutive
record-setting week, as the central bank bought  Treasury
securities  as part of the second round of its quantitative
easing strategy.  Treasuries held by the Fed rose by $14.3 billion to $1.28
trillion as of yesterday. The Fed’s holdings of mortgage-backed
securities fell by $4.83 billion to $944.1 billion and federal
agency debt fell by $3.26 billion to $140 billion, according to
a weekly release by the central bank today.  The central bank has purchased $439.6 billion in Treasuries
since Nov. 12 under plans to purchase $600 billion of government
debt through June and reinvest proceeds from maturing mortgage
debt. The unconventional monetary easing is aimed at spurring
economic growth and preventing inflation from falling too low.  M2  money supply  rose by $9.7 billion in the week ended
March 7, the Fed said. That left M2 growing at an annual rate of
4.1 percent for the past 52 weeks, below the target of 5 percent
the Fed once set for maximum growth. The Fed no longer has a
formal target.  The Fed reports two measures of the money supply each week.
M1 includes all currency held by consumers and companies for
spending, money held in checking accounts and travelers checks.
M2, the more widely followed, adds savings and private holdings
in money market.  M1 fell by $30.9 billion, and over the past 52 weeks M1
rose 9.6 percent, according to the central bank. The Fed no
longer publishes figures for M3.  To contact the reporter on this story:
