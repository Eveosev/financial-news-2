A see-through dress that Royal
bride-to-be  Kate Middleton  wore at a charity fashion show sold
tonight at an auction in  London  for 78,000 pounds ($125,890).  The dress, offered at the specialist fashion salesroom
 Kerry Taylor Auctions  six weeks before the Royal Wedding, sold
to an unidentified bidder in the room. It had been estimated to
fetch between 8,000 pounds and 10,000 pounds, based on hammer
prices. The purchase price includes salesroom fees.  Middleton wore the diaphanous knitted lace dress, designed
by Charlotte Todd, during the annual charity fashion show in
2002 at St. Andrew’s University, where she and  Prince William 
were students. The two of them were just friends before the
prince, who’d paid 200 pounds for a front-row seat, saw her
sashaying down the runway in Todd’s creation, according to the
U.K.’s Daily Mail newspaper.  Todd was the seller of the dress, originally designed as a
skirt. The garment was part of her student project titled “The
Art of Seduction” at the University of the West of  England ,
Bristol, the auction house said.  (Scott Reyburn writes about the art market for Muse, the
