The Swiss franc strengthened for a
fifth day against the dollar as  Japan ’s struggle to avert
disaster at a nuclear-power plant spurred demand for safety and
the  Swiss National Bank  kept  interest rates  unchanged.    Switzerland ’s currency climbed to its strongest level since
Jan. 3 against the euro. The Zurich-based SNB left its three-
month Libor target rate at 0.25 percent, in line with the
forecasts of all 20 economists in a Bloomberg News survey. The
franc advanced against its higher-yielding peers, including the
Australian and New Zealand dollars, amid concern that Japan’s
earthquake will hamper the global economic recovery, boosting
demand for the currency as a haven.    Risk aversion  is behind recent moves,” said Sven Schubert, a foreign-exchange analyst at Credit Suisse Group AG
in Zurich. “We don’t see an immediate need for monetary
tightening from the SNB.”  The Swiss franc strengthened 0.5 percent to 90.39 centimes
per dollar as of 9:44 a.m. in  London , after appreciating earlier
to 89.11, the strongest since Bloomberg records began in 1971.
Switzerland’s currency was at 1.2666 per euro, after
strengthening earlier to 1.2433.  The SNB predicted inflation of 0.8 percent in 2011,
compared with a prior forecast of 0.4 percent. For 2012, it
projects 1.1 percent consumer price growth, up from 1 percent
previously. It raised its forecast for economic growth this year
to 2 percent from 1.5 percent.  More than 300 workers are racing to prevent a meltdown and
spread of radiation from the crippled Fukushima Dai-Ichi power
station north of  Tokyo , an increase from a core group of 50
engineers yesterday, Tokyo Electric Power Co. said. The nation’s
most powerful earthquake on record triggered a tsunami that
killed thousands and damaged the reactors’ cooling systems.  To contact the reporter on this story:
