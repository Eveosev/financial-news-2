A group representing Russian grain
producers urged the government to decide “immediately” whether
to lift a ban on cereal exports for the 2010 harvest.  “This decision should be made immediately, because process
of export contracts’ preparation takes at least two to three
months, and the decision’s delay until May and June reduces
certainly its effect,” the board of  Russia’s Grain Union  said
in a statement e-mailed today.  The government imposed the ban, scheduled to run through
July 1, after the country’s worst drought in at least half a
century damaged crops last year.  Russia ’s grain harvest fell 37
percent to 60.9 million metric tons in 2010 from 97.1 million
tons in the prior year.  Silos in southern Russia are now at full capacity of 5.4
million tons, up from 4.2 million tons a year earlier, leaving
no space to store the new harvest, the board said. That may lead
to “large-scale losses of grain quality and quantity,” it
said.  Carryover grain stockpiles were 9.2 million tons, or 30
percent of Russia’s total reserves, in the North Caucasian and
Southern federal districts as of Feb. 1, up from 8.6 million
tons a year earlier, the board said. Carryover inventories may
exceed 7 million tons in the country’s south if exports do not
reduce the amount of grain stored in elevators there, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
