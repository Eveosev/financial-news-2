     March 17 (Bloomberg)--  Shangri-La Asia Ltd. (69) , Asia’s biggest
luxury hotel company by market value, has stopped buying fresh
food from Japan as concerns over radioactive contamination
spread throughout Asia.  “Our guests’ safety is our top priority," said Sari Yong,
a spokeswoman for the company that runs 71 hotels worldwide.
"Therefore as a precaution we have temporarily stopped importing
fresh food from Japan."  To contact the reporter on this story:
