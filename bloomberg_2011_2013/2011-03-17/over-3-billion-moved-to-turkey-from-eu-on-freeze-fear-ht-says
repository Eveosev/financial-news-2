More than $3 billion has been moved
to Turkey from European banks in the last two weeks amid fears
accounts will be frozen as autocratic Middle Eastern regimes
fight to stay in power,  Haberturk  newspaper reported.  The money transfers accelerated after European Union
countries began a freeze on assets connected to Libyan leader  Muammar Qaddafi , who has been fighting a rebellion for the past
month, Haberturk said, citing unnamed banking officials.  Billions have been transferred from accounts in  Germany ,
Austria and non-EU member  Switzerland  to Turkey, it said. Much
of the money from Germany and Austria is believed to belong to
the Qaddafis, who have sparred with Swiss authorities for years,
the newspaper said, citing bank officials.  It said the funds were being moved by Arab “sheiks”
without further identifying who was actually transferring the
money.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
