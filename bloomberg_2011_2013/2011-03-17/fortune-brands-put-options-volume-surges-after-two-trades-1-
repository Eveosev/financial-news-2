  Fortune Brands Inc. (FO)  put volume
surged to its highest level since November after two trades with
a strike price 16 percent below today’s close.  Two blocks of more than 2,800 June $50 puts to sell
Fortune, the maker of Jim Beam bourbon and Titleist golf balls
that’s planning to break itself up, traded at 9:58 a.m. in New
York, one at 65 cents each and one 70 cents each, data compiled
by Bloomberg show. The open price for the contract was 65 cents.
Open interest for the June $50 puts was 166 before today.  A total of 7,700 puts changed hands today, more than 13
times the four-week average and almost double the number of
calls to buy. The June $50 puts, which were the most traded,
accounted for more than nine-tenths of all put volume and gained
25 percent to 75 cents. Fortune rose 0.2 percent to $59.63.  The Deerfield, Illinois-based company said Dec. 8 it would
split into three separate businesses and focus on distilled
spirits, after activist investor  William Ackman  acquired a
stake. The company will spin off its home and security division
and sell or spin off the golf unit, Fortune said in December.
The stock has gained 20 percent in the past year, compared with
a 16 percent increase for companies in the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index that are dependent on consumer discretionary spending.  Fortune’s implied volatility, the key gauge of option
prices, for at-the-money options expiring in 30 days has risen
to 27.75 from its 18.31 low on Feb. 4, the lowest level since
October 2007.  Calls give the right to buy 100 shares of a security for a
certain amount, the strike price, by a set date. Puts convey the
right to sell. Investors use options to guard against
fluctuations in the price of securities they own, speculate on
share-price moves or bet that volatility, or stock swings, will
rise or fall.  To contact the reporter on this story:
