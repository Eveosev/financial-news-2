Canadian stocks rose for the first
time in four days as oil prices advanced with continuing unrest
in the Middle East and northern  Africa  and economic data from  Canada  and the U.S. showed a strengthening recovery.    Suncor Energy Inc. (SU) , the country’s biggest oil and gas
producer, gained 2.5 percent as crude climbed above $100 a
barrel.  Royal Bank of Canada (RY) , the country’s largest lender by
assets, increased 0.7 percent as Canadian wholesale sales rose
for a sixth month.  Teck Resources Ltd. (TCK/B) , the country’s biggest
base-metals and coal producer, rallied 4.1 percent as copper and
zinc gained.  The Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index advanced 138.46
points, or 1 percent, to 13,663.28 at 10:41 a.m. in Toronto. It
fell to a six-week low yesterday.  Oil prices “have stabilized at the elevated levels,” said  Greg Eckel , who helps oversee about C$1 billion ($1 billion) as
a money manager at Morgan Meighen & Associates Ltd. in Toronto.
“If there are pipeline disruptions and production disruptions,
it obviously reduces supply.”  The index had lost 4.3 percent this month through yesterday
after eight months of gains. Oil companies dropped as crude
prices retreated from the peak touched at the outbreak of the
Libyan civil war, while mining and insurance stocks declined
after the March 11 earthquake and tsunami in  Japan .  Crude oil futures rallied as much as 2.8 percent as
fighting intensified in  Libya . Natural gas jumped after the U.S.
Energy Department said stockpiles declined more than 21 of 22
analysts in a Bloomberg survey had forecast.  ‘Key Call’  Suncor advanced 2.5 percent to C$43.12 after being named a
“key call” by George Toriola, an analyst at UBS AG.  Canadian
Natural Resources Ltd. (CNQ) , the country’s second-largest energy
company by market value, rose 2.8 percent to C$47.21.    Pacific Rubiales Energy Corp. (PRE) , which produces oil and gas
in  Colombia , surged 5.5 percent to C$27.50 after releasing
details of its contract with Ecopetrol SA to develop the Quifa
Block. The shares sank to a six-month low on March 14 on concern
the contract may lead to a smaller participation interest in the
project for Pacific Rubiales than previously thought.  Wholesale sales increased 1.5 percent in January,  Statistics Canada  said today. The figure exceeded nine of 11
economists’ estimates in a Bloomberg survey.  Claims Fall  In the U.S., first-time unemployment claims fell to 385,000
last week from a revised 401,000 the previous week, the Labor
Department said in  Washington . Economists had forecast a total
of 388,000 claims, according to the median of 44 estimates in a
Bloomberg survey.  Thirty-three of 43 S&P/TSX financial stocks gained. Royal
Bank increased 0.7 percent to C$59.45.  Manulife Financial Corp. (MFC) ,  North America ’s fourth-largest insurer, climbed 2 percent to
C$16.46. Brokerage  GMP Capital Inc. (GMP)  rose 2.8 percent to C$14.70.  Producers of raw materials used in industry advanced as all
major base metals gained on the London Metal Exchange.  Teck rose 4.1 percent to C$53.21.  First Quantum Minerals
Ltd. (FM) , Canada’s second-largest publicly traded copper producer,
gained 3.6 percent to C$118.90.  Equinox Minerals Ltd. (EQN) , which
mines copper in Africa, increased 3.9 percent to C$5.06.    Minera Andes Inc. (MAI) , which explores for precious and base
metals in  Argentina , surged 18 percent to C$2.66 after
announcing plans to spin off its Los Azules copper project into
a new company.    Cameco Corp. (CCO) , the world’s second-largest uranium producer,
decreased 2.3 percent to C$28.68. The shares have plunged 21
percent this week as the Japanese nuclear crisis has jeopardized
a renaissance in nuclear power.  Lumber producer  Canfor Corp. (CFP)  advanced 4.9 percent to
C$13.63. The stock has soared 12 percent since the earthquake on
speculation rebuilding in Japan will increase demand for wood
products.  Western Forest Products Inc. (WEF) , which exports forest
products to  Asia , soared 25 percent to C$1.19, extending its
five-day gain to 89 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
