  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  hid from
the South Korean Heungkuk Life Insurance Co. that it had bet
against the viability of a collateralized debt obligation the
bank sold as safe, according to a lawsuit filed in  New York .  The insurer seeks more than $47.3 million in damages from
the New York-based banking firm according to its 56-page
complaint accusing Goldman Sachs of fraud and negligent
misrepresentation.  “Goldman had utilized its specialized knowledge of the
subprime mortgage market to make a massive, concealed bet
against the very CDO that it sold to Heungkuk,” the insurer
said in its complaint.  The complaint focuses on the bank’s Timberwolf I CDO Ltd.,
a $1 billion CDO Heungkuk claims was marketed as “highly rated,
secure and profitable.”  Timberwolf was called “one shitty deal,” by a bank
executive in a 2007 internal e-mail written eight days after the
Heungkuk investment, according to the complaint. The e-mail by
now-former Goldman executive  Thomas Montag  was released publicly
by U.S. Senate lawmakers last year.    Michael DuVally , a spokesman for the New York-based
investment bank, today declined to comment on the Heungkuk case.  The case is Heungkuk Life Insurance Co. v. The Goldman
Sachs Group Inc., 11cv1856, U.S. District Court, Southern
District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
