  Deutsche Lufthansa AG (LHA)  ,  Europe ’s second-biggest airline, said it aims to increase
earnings and sales this year as economic growth improves.  Lufthansa’s main airline brand will probably raise
operating profit from 382 million euros ($534 million) in 2010
as spending reductions help make up for higher fuel prices and
political turmoil that may limit traffic gains, the carrier said
today in a statement distributed at a news conference.  EQUITIES:

eightfold on lower writedowns and financing expenses, and

*Lanxess (LXS GR) said fourth-quarter net income rose, and the
company proposed a dividend increase.

shutting down its Neckarwestheim 1 and Philippsburg 1 nuclear
reactors and taking them off the electricity grid following the

2 billion-euro ($2.8 billion) facility to replace an existing
credit line, a person familiar with the deal said.  ECONOMY/GOVERNMENT/GENERAL:
