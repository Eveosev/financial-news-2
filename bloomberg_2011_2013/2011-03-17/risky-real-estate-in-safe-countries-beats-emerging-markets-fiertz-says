Real estate investors should look
at riskier assets in stable countries to improve returns as
prime properties yield less and emerging markets lose stability,
according to Stuart Fiertz, co-founder of  Cheyne Capital
Management (UK) LLP .  “It is becoming more important to switch attention away
from trophy assets in central business districts, where yields
are falling,” Fiertz said today at the Bloomberg Link Hedge
Funds conference in London.  Sales of existing commercial property in London generated
more money than in any other city last year, according to New
York-based research group Real Capital Analytics Inc. Investors
were drawn to offices and homes in the center of the U.K.
capital by low  interest rates  and concerns that the global
economy will deteriorate.  “Anyone could make money in the  property market  up to
2007,” Peter Cosmetatos, finance director of the  British
Property Federation , said at today’s conference. “Now we can
see a difference between the prime, reliable, boring property
and the rest, where there are some interesting investment
opportunities.”  Countries such as the U.K. and  Germany  are more attractive
for real estate investments than assets in emerging markets
because they are  politically stable and “the rules are
respected,” Fiertz said.  “With the events of the last few weeks, we are more aware
how frightening and uncertain most of the world is,” said
Cosmetatos. “Buying real estate roots you to the ground it’s
on.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
