Stocks in the developed world and
emerging markets may rally in coming years as they trade below
historical valuations, said  Jeremy Siegel , a professor of
finance at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School.  Price-to-earnings ratios in emerging markets are
“extremely cheap,” while the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
normally trades at 19 times earnings in periods of low  interest
rates , which is about 40 percent above current levels, he said.  “We could have a bull year for the next two to three years
with gains of 10 to 15 percent per year in the S&P 500,” he
said today at a conference in Santiago. “Stocks are still below
the long-term trend and there is still room for them to rally.”  Siegel recommends investing in stocks with high dividend
payments.  “The top dividend payers of the  S&P 500  are the type of
stocks you want to hold if you are a conservative investor in
the U.S.,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
