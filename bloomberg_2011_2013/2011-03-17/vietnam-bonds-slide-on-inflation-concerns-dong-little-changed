  Vietnam ’s benchmark five-year bonds
fell, pushing their yield to a 10-month high, on concern
inflation is gathering pace. The dong was little changed.  Consumer prices will rise 1.8 percent to 2.2 percent this
month from February, according to a government forecast
published March 15. Last month’s 2.1 percent increase was the
biggest since June 2008 and the 12.3 percent inflation rate was
the highest in two years, official figures show.  “I think the  bond market  now is really concerned about
higher inflation,” Francois Chavasseau, head of fixed-income
research at Sacombank Securities Joint-Stock Co., said in a
telephone interview from  Ho Chi Minh City . “I’m expecting a
continuation in the rise of bond yields.”  Five-year bond yields climbed four basis points to 11.94
percent, the highest rate since May 11, according to a daily
fixing from banks compiled by Bloomberg. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point.  The dong traded at 20,860 per dollar as of 4:11 p.m. in
Hanoi, little changed from 20,863 yesterday, according to prices
from banks. The central bank set the  reference rate  at 20,658,
the same as yesterday, its website showed. The currency is
allowed to trade up to 1 percent on either side of the official
rate.  --Nicholas Heath. Editors: James Regan, Ven Ram  To contact the reporter on this story:
