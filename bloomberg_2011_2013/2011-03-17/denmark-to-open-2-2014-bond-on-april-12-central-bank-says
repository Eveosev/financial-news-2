Denmark’s central bank said a 2
percent bullet loan maturing 2014 will be opened on April 12, in
a statement published today. The security will replace a 5
percent 2013 bullet bond as a so-called key on-the-run issue,
the bank said. The 5 percent 2013 loan will continue as a two-
year benchmark “until further notice,” it said.    “The opening is contingent on stable market conditions,”
the bank said.   The total offered amount at the auction is a maximum of 5
billion kroner ($939 million), it said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
