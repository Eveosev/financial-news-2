The United Nations food agency
warned East African nations against using export bans to combat
record food prices and urged them instead to consider reducing  import duties .  Bans on shipments implemented by African and South Asian
countries in the past “may be negative in the long term” because
they may reduce global trade, Castro Camarada, the Food and
Agricultural Organization’s East Africa coordinator, told
reporters today in Addis Ababa,  Ethiopia ’s capital.  As a net importer of food and dependent on food aid, the
region is especially vulnerable to prices that surged to a new
peak for the eighth successive month in February, according to
the FAO’s Food Price Index.  Reducing import duties “could be a favorable” response as
long as countries have the “budget to deal with it,” Camarada
said.  Ethiopia’s temporary abolition of some taxes on food items
was partly responsible for the rate of growth in food prices
slowing from 44.3 percent in 2009 to a 5.5 percent decline in
2010, State Minister of Finance Abraham Tekeste said to the FAO
and African Union conference.  To contact the reporter on this story:
