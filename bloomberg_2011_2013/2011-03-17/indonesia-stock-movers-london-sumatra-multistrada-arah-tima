Shares of the following companies
had unusual moves in Indonesian trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses, and prices are as of the 4 p.m. Jakarta time close.  The  Jakarta Composite index (JCI)  declined 47.27 points, or 1.3
percent, to 3,484.21, the sharpest drop since Jan. 31.  PT Multistrada Arah Sarana (MASA IJ), an Indonesian tire
producer, rose 1.9 percent to 270 rupiah. The company’s 2010 net
income rose to 176.1 billion rupiah ($20 million) from 174.9
billion rupiah a year earlier, the tire producer said in a
statement published in Kontan today.  PT Semen Gresik (SMGR IJ), Indonesia’s biggest cement
producer, fell 2.9 percent to 8,350 rupiah, the steepest drop
since Jan. 27. The shares retreated amid concern  Japan ’s nuclear
crisis will boost the price of alternative energy such as coal,
which is used in the production of cement, according to Teguh P. Hartanto, an analyst at PT Bahana Securities in Jakarta. As much
as 29 percent of the total cost in making cement is coal
related, Hartanto said.  PT Telekomunikasi  Indonesia  (TLKM IJ), the nation’s largest
telephone company, dropped 3.6 percent to 6,800 rupiah, the
biggest decline since Jan. 7. The company’s 2010 revenue may be
below expectations, Raymond Kosasih and William Bratton,
analysts at Deutsche Bank AG, wrote in a note today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
