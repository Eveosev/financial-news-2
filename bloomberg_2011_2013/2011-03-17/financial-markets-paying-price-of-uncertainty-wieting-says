World markets are paying the
“price of uncertainty” as the effects of the earthquake,
tsunami and nuclear disaster unfold in  Japan , said Steven Wieting, managing director of economic and market analysis at
Citigroup Global Markets Inc. in  New York .  “We have to understand that you cannot in the midst of an
ongoing, evolving disaster have a hard prediction for exactly
what the impact will be,” Wieting said today in a radio
interview on “Bloomberg Surveillance” with Tom Keene.  “The uncertainty around what the impact will be, by
itself, has a price,” Wieting said. “Once we know what
ultimately the outcomes are then that price, that particular
uncertainty price, can go away. But there are still economic
effects.”  (In the U.S., hear Bloomberg Radio on satellite radio: Sirius
