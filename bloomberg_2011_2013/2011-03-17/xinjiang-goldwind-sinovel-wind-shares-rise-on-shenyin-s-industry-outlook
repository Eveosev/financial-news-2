Shares in Xinjiang Goldwind Science
& Technology Co. and Sinovel Wind Group Co. rose in Shenzhen and  Shanghai  trading after Shenyin & Wanguo Securities Co. said  China ’s wind-power industry may grow faster than market
consensus.  Xinjiang Goldwind rose 3.5 percent to 23.12 yuan in
Shenzhen as of 9:48 a.m.  while Sinovel Wind Group Co climbed
2.9 percent to 78.37 yuan in Shanghai.  The wind-power industry in China may grow faster than
market consensus because the Chinese government has suspended
approval of new nuclear projects following radiation leaks at a
plant in Japan following the March 11 earthquake, according to
Shenyin & Wanguo Securities Co.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
