  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS) ,
the biggest U.K. government-owned bank, said it reduced
taxpayer-assisted funding by 21 percent to 57.6 billion pounds
($93 billion) last year.  The Edinburgh-based lender had 41.5 billion-pounds of loans
and guarantees from the government’s Credit Guarantee Scheme and
16.1 billion pounds from the Bank of England’s  Special Liquidity
Scheme . That’s 15.3 billion pounds lower than the total in 2009.  The U.K. financial authorities introduced the SLS at the
peak of the credit crisis to allow banks to swap hard-to-trade
mortgage-backed securities for government bonds. The CGS, also
introduced in 2008, is designed to ensure short-term liquidity.  The government has injected 45.5 billion pounds into RBS to
bolster its capital and insures about 195 billion pounds of its
risky assets.  To contact the reporters on this story:
