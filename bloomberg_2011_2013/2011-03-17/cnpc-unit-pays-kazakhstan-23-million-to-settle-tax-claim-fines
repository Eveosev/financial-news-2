China National Petroleum Corp.’s
Kazakh unit paid 3.3 billion tenge ($23 million) in back
royalties and rent tax, as well as fines, prosecutors said.  AO CNPC-AktobeMunaiGaz decreased its taxable income by the
amount of money it paid for oil export duties, in violation of
the law, the Prosecutor General’s Office said in a  statement 
yesterday on its website. CNPC-AktobeMunaiGaz paid the taxes and
fines in full under a court order, the prosecutors said, without
giving the period for the tax claims.  To contact the reporter on this story:
