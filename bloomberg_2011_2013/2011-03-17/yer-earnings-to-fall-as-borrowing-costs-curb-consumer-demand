  Myer Holdings Ltd. (MYR) ,  Australia ’s
biggest department store chain, said annual earnings will fall
as rising household borrowing costs and fuel prices crimp
consumer demand.  Earnings excluding one-off items will fall as much as 5
percent in the 12 months ending July from the A$169 million
($166 million) reported last year, Melbourne-based Myer said in
a statement today. The company today reported an 8.8 percent
drop in first-half profit excluding items to A$108.9 million.  First-half sales fell 3.5 percent as retailers boosted
discounting to draw customers and reverse the slide in  consumer
spending . Myer is adding private label fashions and dropping
products such as home appliances to boost profitability and
limit the impact of declining revenue.  “Sales have improved since January but are still behind
last year,” Chief Executive Officer Bernie Brookes said in the
statement. “In the second half of 2011 we anticipate trading
conditions will continue to be challenging.”  Myer shares rose 3.9 percent to A$3.22 as of 1:01 p.m. in
Sydney. The stock, which has fallen 9.3 percent this year, has
never traded higher than the A$4.10 issue price of its Nov. 2009
initial public offering that raised A$2.1 billion.  Net income for the first half surged to A$106.8 million in
the six months ended Jan. 29 from A$21.3 million a year earlier.
The net income result this year includes A$2.1 million in costs
related to the IPO, compared with A$93.5 million worth of
charges in the year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
