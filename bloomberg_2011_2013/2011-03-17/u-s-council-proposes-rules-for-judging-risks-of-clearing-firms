A council of U.S. regulators in
charge of preventing another financial crisis proposed rules to
help the panel decide which clearinghouses are systemically
important and require additional oversight.  The Financial Stability Oversight Council voted today in  Washington  to request public comment on how it should
decide which clearinghouses and utilities pose a potential
threat to the financial system.  The council is led by Treasury Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner  and includes Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke
and the chairmen of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.,
Securities and Exchange Commission and Commodity Futures Trading
Commission.  Market utilities settle and clear transactions among
financial firms. A preliminary version of the councilâ€™s so-
called proposed rulemaking was released in November.  To contact the reporter on this story:
