Investing in  Russia  is the cheapest
way to profit from Asian growth as the region consumes oil and
gas from the world’s largest energy exporter, said Roland Nash,
chief investment strategist at Verno Capital.  “Equity evaluations on Asia are predicting a great deal of
growth over the next few years,” Nash said at the Bloomberg
Link Hedge Fund Conference in  London  today. “If the equity
markets are right about Asia, it’s very difficult to see how
Russia won’t perform.”  Russia offers the “cheapest” way to benefit from Asian
growth, Nash said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
