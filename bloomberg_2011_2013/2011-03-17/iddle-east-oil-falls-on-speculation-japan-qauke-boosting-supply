Middle East oil for sale to  Asia 
fell for a third day on speculation supplies are rising after
Japanese refiners shut plants following the country’s largest
recorded earthquake.  Murban, produced by Abu Dhabi National Oil Co., dropped 21
cents to a premium of 20 cents a barrel to its official selling
price for May loading, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Qatar Marine for the same period fell 25 cents to a premium of 7
cents, Bloomberg data showed.  The temblor shut about 1.3 million barrels a day of
refining capacity, or 29 percent of the country’s total. Cosmo
Oil Co. said a fire is still burning at its 220,000 barrel-a-day
Chiba plant. Kyokuto Petroleum Industries Ltd. said it’s
restarting a 175,000 barrel a day facility in the same city and
expects the plant to be fully operational in a “few days.”  Oman oil for immediate loading rose $3.13, or 3 percent, to
$107.42 a barrel today, according to Bloomberg data. Dubai for
loading in May was up 3 percent at $107.14 and Murban crude
climbed 2.7 percent to $110.70.  Oman futures for May delivery gained $2.52 to $107.50 a
barrel on the  Dubai Mercantile Exchange  at 7:03 p.m. Singapore
time, with 887 contracts traded. The settlement price was set at
$106.31 a barrel at 12:30 p.m. Dubai time.  The Brent-Dubai exchange for swaps, or EFS, for May
narrowed 9 cents to $6.02 a barrel, according to data from PVM
Oil Associates, a brokerage. The exchange for swaps for June
fell 15 cents to $5.95.  To contact the reporter on this story:
