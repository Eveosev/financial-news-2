The  European Central Bank  welcomed
a draft change to the European Union treaty that would establish
a permanent rescue mechanism in 2013 for distressed euro-area
nations.  “The ECB encourages Member States to approve the draft
decision promptly in order for it to enter into force at the
date provided in it, which is 1 January 2013,” the Frankfurt-
based ECB said in a legal opinion published today. It also said
the European Stability Mechanism, or ESM, “should be granted
the capacity to employ an appropriate range of instruments in
order to be able to effectively fight against contagion in
situations of acute market instability.”  The planned ESM will replace the EU rescue system set up
with the  International Monetary Fund  for three years last May
after a 110 billion-euro ($154 billion) loan package for  Greece 
failed to prevent increases in the borrowing costs of other
high-deficit euro nations. The main pillar of the current 750
billion-euro system is the European Financial Stability
Facility.  To contact the reporter on this story:
