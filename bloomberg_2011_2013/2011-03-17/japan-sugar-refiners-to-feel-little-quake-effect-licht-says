  Japan ’s sugar-refining industry is
unlikely to feel “much of an impact” from last week’s
earthquake and tsunami, German researcher F.O. Licht said.  “Most of the plants are situated around the Tokyo Bay area
and in southern Japan,” Licht said in a report today. Japan
consumes between 2.1 million and 2.2 million metric tons of
sugar a year, according to the company.  Rains last year caused a “sharp” reduction in sugar-beet
planting on the northern island of Hokkaido, the report shows.
“This has led to the expectation that the country will need to
raise its raw sugar imports significantly this year,” Licht
said. Imports are forecast to reach 1.4 million tons in 2010-11,
it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
