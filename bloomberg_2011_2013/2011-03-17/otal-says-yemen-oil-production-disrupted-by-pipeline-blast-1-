  Total SA (FP) , the largest foreign
investor in Yemen, said oil production has been disrupted by a
pipeline blast while  OMV AG (OMV)  said the incident hasn’t halted its
crude exports for now.  Total owns a 15 percent interest in Yemen’s Block 5, where
output was hit, Phenelope Semavoine, a company spokeswoman, said
in a telephone interview today. The company’s production from
other blocks wasn’t affected, she said. OMV is exporting oil
from stocks in the Arabian Peninsula country, Sven Pusswald, a
company spokesman, said.  Yemeni news website Marib Press reported March 15 that
armed men caused an explosion that damaged the pipeline, which
pumps 120,000 barrels a day. Production from two  oil fields  was
halted as a result, according to the website. The blast would be
the second on an energy facility in Yemen in five months,
following an explosion on a crude pipeline in November.  Political protests that have overthrown governments in
Tunisia and  Egypt  have spread to Yemen, where demonstrators
demanding an end to President Ali Abdullah Saleh’s three-decade
rule have clashed with security forces. Saleh is a key U.S. ally
in the campaign against al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. His
government also faces a secessionist movement in the south.  Maintain Output  Yemen is struggling to maintain output of crude oil, which
accounts for 27 percent of the country’s gross domestic product
and 90 percent of its exports, according to the  World Bank . Oil
production has fallen from 457,000 barrels a day in 2002 to
298,000 barrels a day in 2009, according to BP Plc statistics.  Block 5 , which is operated by Jannah Hunt Oil Co, produces
an average of 42,000 barrels a day, according to Total’s
 website . Total also operates block 10, which produces about
60,000 barrels a day, and is the biggest shareholder in a Yemen
liquefied natural gas venture, Yemen LNG Co.  OMV operates the Habban oil field, which produced 6,300
barrels a day in 2009, the company said in its  annual report 
that year.  To contact the reporter on this story:  Robert Tuttle  in Doha at
