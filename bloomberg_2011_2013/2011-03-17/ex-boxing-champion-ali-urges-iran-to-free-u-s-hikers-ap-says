  Muhammad Ali , the former world
heavyweight boxing champion, has sent letters to Iran’s supreme
leader seeking the release of two detained U.S. nationals and is
willing to travel there to help the process, the Associated
Press reported, citing his wife.  Muhammad Ali, a prominent American Muslim, addressed a
letter last month to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei
asking Iran to release Josh Fattal and Shane Bauer, AP said. A
similar letter had been sent last year, the report said, citing
Lonnie Ali, his wife.  Bauer and Fattal were detained in July 2009 for illegally
crossing into Iran from Iraqi Kurdistan. Their companion  Sarah
Shourd , who was held alongside them, was released on bail in
September 2010. The U.S. government has said the trio mistakenly
wandered across the border during a hiking trip.  Ali suffers from Parkinson’s Disease and his visit to Iran
would depend on the state of his health, his wife said,
according to the AP.  To contact the reporter on this story:
