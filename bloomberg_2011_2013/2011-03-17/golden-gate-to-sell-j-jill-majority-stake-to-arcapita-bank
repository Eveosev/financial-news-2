  Golden Gate  Capital Corp., a
private equity firm, agreed to sell a majority stake in the J.
Jill clothing business to Arcapita Bank BSC, a Bahrain-based
investment bank, less than two years after buying the company.  Golden Gate, based in  San Francisco , will remain a minority
shareholder in the company, according to a statement today.
Terms of the deal werenâ€™t disclosed. J. Jill President and Chief
Executive Officer Paula Bennett will continue to lead the
Quincy, Massachusetts-based retailer.  Golden Gate bought J. Jill in June 2009 from  Talbots Inc. (TLB) 
for about $75 million. Talbots, after purchasing J. Jill for
about $517 million in 2006, posted losses in part from consumers
cutting spending during the recession.  J. Jill operates more than 200 stores across the U.S. and
caters to women over the age of 35. Bank of America Merrill
Lynch acted as financial advisor to J. Jill, while Kirkland &
Ellis LLP provided legal advice, according to the statement.  Interest in specialty retailers has advanced since J.
Crew Group Inc. announced in November that TPG Capital in  Fort
Worth , Texas, and Los Angeles-based Leonard Green & Partners LP
would acquire the New York-based chain for $3 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
