  Daimler AG (DAI) , the world’s largest
maker of commercial vehicles, rejected a report that it may
still create a truck alliance with Fiat Industial SpA.  “There are no talks between Fiat and Daimler,” Heinz Gottwick, a spokesman for the Stuttgart, Germany-based
automaker, said by phone.  Manager Magazin  reported  that the Agnelli family is
prepared to link the entire company or just the Iveco heavy
trucks unit with a partner, including Daimler, citing people
close to John Elkann, the head of the Agnelli family.  Fiat’s controlling family is prepared to reduce its 30
percent stake in Fiat Industrial in connection with a deal, the
magazine said in an advanced release of a story to be published
tomorrow. A Fiat spokesman declined to comment.  Daimler Chief Financial Officer Bodo Uebber said in an
interview this week with Bloomberg that the automaker, which
makes Mercedes-Benz, Freightliner, and Fuso vehicles, walked
away from talks with Fiat last year, because the company takes a
“disciplined” approach to acquisitions.  Fiat Industrial shares rose as much as 44 cents, or 4.9
percent, to 9.41 euros and traded at late level as of 3:52 p.m.
in Milan. Daimler rose 2.5 percent at 45.49 euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
