The  International Monetary Fund 
warned that the political crisis in  Ivory Coast  could have
“severe” spillover effects on the economy of West Africa.  The Washington-based IMF said there are “considerable
risks” to the recovery of the  West African Economic and
Monetary Union . Rising oil and food prices will fan inflation
and a projected expansion of about 4.3 percent in the eight-
country region requires a “rapid and peaceful solution” to the
Ivory Coast standoff, the IMF said.  “If not resolved soon,” the turmoil could “have severe
human and financial cost for neighboring countries” in the
monetary union and in the region, “including though trade,
migration, and financial sector channels,” the IMF said in an
e-mailed statement today following a March 14 board meeting
about the common policies of the union.    Ivory Coast , the world’s top cocoa producer, is on the
brink of civil war, with more than 400 people killed since a
disputed Nov. 28 election, according to the  United Nations .
While  Alassane Ouattara  is the internationally recognized
winner, incumbent President Laurent Gbagbo, who retains the
loyalty of the armed forces, refuses to cede power.  The IMF also urged member countries to restore the
functioning of the union’s banking commission, saying it is
“critical to ensure effective supervision and minimize the
spillover risk” from Ivory Coast.  To contact the reporter on this story:
