U.S. Gulf crude premiums
strengthened versus West  Texas  Intermediate as Brent oil’s
premium to the U.S. benchmark widened past $12 a barrel.  The gap between May-delivery futures for WTI and for Brent,
its European counterpart, increased 50 cents to $12.15 a barrel
at 1:06 p.m. in  New York . The differential for the contract
nearest to expiration reached a record $15.94 on Feb. 16.  When Brent gains versus WTI, it strengthens the value of
low-sulfur U.S. grades that compete with West African oil priced
against Brent.  Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium to WTI strengthened 90
cents to $15 a barrel at 11:59 a.m. in New York, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium
widened 95 cents to $15.70.  Among Gulf Coast sour, or high-sulfur, grades, Mars Blend
gained $1.45 to $10.20 a barrel over the benchmark. Poseidon’s
premium strengthened $1.70 to $10.25.  Southern Green Canyon’s premium increased $1.25 to $7.75 a
barrel. Thunder Horse added 15 cents to $11.65 over WTI.  West Texas Sour’s discount narrowed 25 cents to $3.65 a
barrel. WTS is delivered in Midland, Texas, so its price is less
influenced by imports.  Syncrude’s premium weakened $1.50 to $12.75 a barrel.
Syncrude is a light, low-sulfur synthetic oil derived from the  tar sands  in  Alberta . The discount for Western Canada Select
narrowed 25 cents to $19.50 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:  Aaron Clark  in New York at
