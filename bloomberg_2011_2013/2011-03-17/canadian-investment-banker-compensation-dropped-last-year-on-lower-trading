Compensation for investment-banking
heads at  Canada ’s six largest banks fell an average 8.6 percent
last year as trading revenue declined, while chief executive
officers at most of the lenders received higher pay.  Total direct compensation for the top eight investment
bankers was an average of C$7.67 million ($7.77 million) in
2010, according to regulatory filings. That compares with an
average of C$8.39 million a year earlier.    Royal Bank of Canada (RY)  was among lenders that said trading
revenue fell in the year ended Oct. 31 because of “lower client
volumes and tighter spreads,” reducing investment-banking
profit by 6.8 percent to C$1.65 billion.  As a result, RBC Capital Markets Co-Group Head Mark Standish received C$10.4 million in direct compensation, a 26
percent decrease from the year earlier, while Co-Group Head Doug McGregor received C$10.2 million, a 22 percent decline.  “Part of it is perception,” Bill Vlaad, president of
Toronto-based recruiter Vlaad & Co., said in an interview. “The
upper echelon has to take it on the chin a little bit harder in
order to lead the troops.”  CIBC World Markets, the investment-banking unit of Canadian
Imperial Bank of Commerce, was the only firm that paid its top
investment banker more in 2010.  CIBC World Markets  CEO Richard Nesbitt was awarded C$7.96 million in direct compensation last
year, 47 percent higher than in 2009, according to a regulatory
filing today.  TD Securities head Robert Dorrance received C$8.1 million
in 2010, down 1.8 percent, while BMO Capital Markets CEO Tom Milroy was awarded C$7 million, down 6.7 percent from 2009, for
example.  Bank Chiefs  In comparison, bank CEOs received higher compensation, with
the exception of  National Bank of Canada (NA) ’s Louis Vachon. Royal
Bank CEO Gordon Nixon received C$11 million, a 5.8 increase from
the year-earlier period, the result of higher overall profit at
the country’s largest lender.    Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD)  CEO Edmund Clark received C$11.3
million, an 8.4 percent increase from the year earlier.  Bank of
Nova Scotia (BNS)  increased CEO Richard Waugh’s compensation by 10
percent to C$10.7 million after the bank posted record profit.  Bank of Montreal (BMO) ’s William Downe was paid C$9.54 million, a 28
percent boost from 2009. Canadian Imperial increased the
compensation of CEO Gerald McCaughey by 50 percent to C$9.34
million in 2010 from the year earlier.  To contact the reporters on this story:
