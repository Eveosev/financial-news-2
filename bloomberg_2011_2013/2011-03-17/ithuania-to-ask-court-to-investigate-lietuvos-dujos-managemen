  Lithuania  wants a regional court in
Vilnius to investigate operations by  Lietuvos Dujos (LDJ1L)  AB
management, including representatives of shareholder OAO
Gazprom, as the state continues a dispute with the Russian gas
supplier.  Chief Executive Officer Viktoras Valentukevicius, Chairman
Valery Golubev and board member Kiril Seleznev ignored the
interests of Lithuania and didn’t negotiate a fair gas price for
supplies from  Russia , the Vilnius-based Energy Ministry said in
an e-mailed statement today.  Lietuvos Dujos spokeswoman Sigita Petrikonyte-Jurkuniene
was not immediately available for comment when contacted by
telephone by Bloomberg.  The Baltic state asked the European Commission on Jan. 25
to investigate possible market abuse by Gazprom after the
company said Lithuania, unlike neighboring Latvia and Estonia,
won’t receive gas-price cuts because the country plans to begin
unbundling ownership of its gas industry.  Lithuania pays about $100 more than  Germany  for 1,000 cubic
meters of Russian natural gas, the government has previously
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
