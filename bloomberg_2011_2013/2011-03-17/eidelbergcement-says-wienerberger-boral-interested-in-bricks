  HeidelbergCement AG (HEI) , the world’s
third-largest maker of cement and concrete, said  Wienerberger
AG (WIE) , the biggest brick maker, and  Boral Ltd. (BLD) ,  Australia ’s largest
seller of building materials, are among parties interested in
buying its brick business.  While selling fringe assets including the brick business
and light-weight concrete remains a topic, Chief Executive
Officer  Bernd Scheifele  said he will not do “fire sales” and
rather wait until asset prices in the  construction industry 
improve further, according to comments at a press conference
today in Heidelberg, where the cement maker reported earnings.  HeidelbergCement’s building materials segment posted 1.17
billion euros in sales last year, a decline of 7.7 percent.
About half of that is from bricks, whose sales volumes follow
residential building trends, spokesman Andreas Schaller said.  While Wienerberger is “always interested” in bricks, the
company is not in talks with HeidelbergCement about the asset,
Barbara Braunoeck, a spokeswoman for the Austrian company, said
in a telephone interview from Vienna today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
