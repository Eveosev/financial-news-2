  Angola  produced 8.55 million carats
of diamonds last year, Endiama EP, the country’s state-run gem
company, said.  Preliminary estimates show that Angola earned $956 million
from the sale of gems at an average price of $111.74 per carat,
the Luanda-based company said in an e-mailed statement today.  The southern African nation was the world’s fourth-largest
diamond producer by value in 2009, according to the  Kimberley
Process , the global body that monitors sales of so-called
conflict diamonds. Endiama holds stakes in all diamond mines in
Angola.  The company has “practically shut down” its operating
unit, known as Endiama P&P, after its debt increased, said a
company official who declined to be identified because he isn’t
authorized to speak to the media.  To contact the reporter on this story:
