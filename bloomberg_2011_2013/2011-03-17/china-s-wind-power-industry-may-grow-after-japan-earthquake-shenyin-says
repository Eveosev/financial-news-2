China’s wind-power industry may
grow faster than market consensus because the Chinese government
has suspended approval of new nuclear projects following
radiation leaks at a plant in  Japan  following the March 11
earthquake, according to Shenyin & Wanguo Securities Co.  Wind power can partially replace nuclear power as an
alternative energy, Li Xiaoguang and Qi Qi, analysts at the
Shanghai-based brokerage, wrote in a report today.  The photovoltaic industry and makers of power transformers
may benefit as well, as the country steps up construction of
power grids to transmit electricity from the northwest region,
according to the report.  The brokerage recommended shares of Xiangtan Electric
Manufacturing Co., Xinjiang Goldwind Science & Technology Co.
and China XD Electric Co.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
