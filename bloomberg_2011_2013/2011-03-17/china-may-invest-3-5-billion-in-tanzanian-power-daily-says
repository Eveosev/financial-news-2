Sichuan Hongda Co. may invest $3.5
billion in a 600-megawatt power plant in  Tanzania  along with two
other companies, the  Daily News  reported, citing Zitto Kabwe,
head of a parliamentary committee on state-owned enterprises.  Sichuan plans to collaborate with Tanzania’s National
Development Corp., or NDC, and Liganga Iron Ore on the project,
the Dar es Salaam-based newspaper said.  The NDC also formed a joint venture with  Australia ’s  Atomic
Resources Ltd. (ATQ)  to produce 450 megawatts from a $350 million
plant at Mbinga district, the newspaper said. The company will
be known as Tancoal Energy, it said. In addition, an
unidentified investor plans to build a $400 million, 500-
megawatt plant near the Kiwira coal mine, the Daily News said.  The power plants, which are awaiting Cabinet approval, may
begin supplying power within five years, allowing Tanzania to
export electricity to neighboring Malawi, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
