  Algeria  awarded oil and natural-gas
exploration licenses to national energy company Sonatrach and
one to Compania Espanola de Petroleos SA of  Spain , two of 10
permits being offered in a bidding round.  Sonatrach won exploration rights in Rhourde Fares and Cepsa
was granted a license for Rhourde Rouni, according to a
statement from Al Naft, the national hydrocarbon resources
agency. Both blocks are in the Berkine basin of eastern Algeria.  The awards are Al Naft’s first since Youcef Yousfi replaced
Chakib Khelil as oil minister at the end of May.  Algeria, a member of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries, pumped 1.25 million barrels of oil a day in
February, making it the 10-largest producer among the group’s 12
members, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story: Salah Slimani at
