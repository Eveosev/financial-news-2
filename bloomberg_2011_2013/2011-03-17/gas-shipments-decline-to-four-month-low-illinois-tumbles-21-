Natural gas shipments scheduled for
delivery to U.S. households dropped to the lowest level in more
than four months as warmer weather reduced heating demand.
Deliveries for  Illinois  tumbled 19 percent.  Scheduled shipments for residential use declined for a
third day, down 12 percent to 28 million dekatherms (27.2
billion cubic feet), the lowest level since Oct. 27, based on a
sample amount of gas pipeline nominations compiled by Bloomberg
as of 10:14 a.m. in  New York .  About 2.70 million dekatherms were to be delivered to
Illinois homes, down from yesterday’s 3.33 million, Bloomberg
data show.  Temperatures will be as much as 14 degrees Fahrenheit above
normal in the U.S. East, Midwest and South through March 21,
according to Commodity Weather Group LLC in Bethesda, Maryland.  The high temperature in Chicago may be 64 degrees
Fahrenheit (18 Celsius) today, 16 degrees above normal,
according to AccuWeather Inc. in  State College , Pennsylvania.  Natural gas accounts for 81 percent of Illinois’s heating
demand, according to  the Energy Department .  Gas at the Alliance Pipeline delivery point near Chicago
slid 0.2 percent to $3.8773 per million British thermal units
yesterday on the  Intercontinental Exchange .  To contact the reporter on this story:
