  Kenya ’s shilling strengthened
against the dollar, boosted by inflows of foreign currency from
the agricultural industry and as demand for the U.S. currency by
importers tapered off.  The currency of East Africa’s biggest economy gained 0.4
percent to 85.60 per dollar at 11:05 a.m. in Nairobi, the
capital. It closed at 85.90 yesterday.  “The local unit is being supported by inflows from the
agricultural sector and a slowdown in dollar demand by
importers,” Wilson Mutai, a trader at Nairobi-based African
Banking Corp., said in a phone interview today.  The shilling has depreciated 6.1 percent this year to the
weakest level since March 1994. Traders have cited political
unrest in North Africa and the Middle East, as well as
speculative positions against the shilling, as being among the
reasons for the Kenyan currency’s weakness, according to the
country’s central bank.  Agriculture generates about half of Kenya’s foreign-
exchange earnings. The East African nation is the world’s
biggest black-tea exporter and  Europe ’s largest source of cut
flowers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
