Rajan Krishnan, chief executive
officer of Baroda Pioneer Asset Management Co. in Mumbai, which
had 29.61 billion rupees ($655 million) in assets at the end of
2010, comments on  India ’s central bank policy and the stock
markets. He spoke in a phone interview today.  The  Reserve Bank  of India raised  interest rates  for the
eighth time in a year today to rein in inflation that
unexpectedly accelerated last month. Governor Duvvuri Subbarao
increased the benchmark repurchase rate by a quarter-percentage
point to 6.75 percent, according to an e-mailed statement. All
26 economists in a Bloomberg News survey had predicted the
decision. The central bank boosted the reverse repurchase rate
to 5.75 percent from 5.5 percent.  The Bombay Stock Exchange’s Sensitive Index, or Sensex,
declined 0.6 percent to 18,250.68 at 12:50 p.m. in Mumbai. The
gauge has lost 13 percent from the record close on Nov. 5.  On his investment strategy:  “Bank stocks will be under pressure over the next two to
three months. There is pressure on banks’ net interest margins.  ‘‘We are underweight on banking. We may consider trimming
our exposure to banks further if we find better opportunities in
other sectors.’’  Krishnan, who declined to name specific companies, said he
would not change his investment strategy based on today’s
central bank policy. Baroda Pioneer favors stocks in the
software, energy and health sectors, while being underweight on
financials, telecom and utilities, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
