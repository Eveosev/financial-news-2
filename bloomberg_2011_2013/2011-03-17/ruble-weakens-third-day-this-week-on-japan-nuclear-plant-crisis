The ruble weakened for the third
day this week against the central bank’s dollar-euro basket as  Japan  worked to contain radiation leaks, stoking concern the
fallout may slow the global economy.  The Russian currency depreciated 0.2 percent to 33.8134
versus Bank Rossii’s target basket, used to temper swings in the
ruble. The basket rate is calculated by multiplying the dollar-
ruble rate by 0.55, the euro-ruble rate by 0.45, then adding
them together. The ruble slid 0.4 percent to 40.01 per euro at
12:06 p.m. in Moscow.  Asian stocks fell today after two nuclear regulators said
fuel rods at the Fukushima Dai-Ichi power plant may be exposed
and could be leaking radiation. The fallout from Japan’s worst
earthquake on record and subsequent nuclear crisis, which
followed weeks of unrest spreading across the Middle East, may
curb demand for emerging-market commodity exports.  The ruble was little changed against the dollar at 28.67.  To contact the reporter on this story:
