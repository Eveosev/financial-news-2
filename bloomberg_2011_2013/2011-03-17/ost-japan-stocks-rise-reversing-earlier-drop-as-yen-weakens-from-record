Japanese equities reversed earlier
declines, with the Topix index swinging to a gain of 0.2
percent, as the yen retreating from a record eased pressure on
exporters, tempering concern that a nuclear crisis may cripple
the worldâ€™s third-largest economy.  The Nikkei 225 Stock Average pared its decline to 0.3
percent and was at 9,070.09 at 2:31 p.m. in  Tokyo . The broader
Topix index climbed 0.2 percent after dropping as much as 4.3
percent. Eleven stocks rose for every four that fell. Many
stocks were untraded at the open, suggesting sell orders
temporarily overwhelmed those to buy for some shares. Twenty-one
of the 33 industry groups in the Topix index advanced.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
