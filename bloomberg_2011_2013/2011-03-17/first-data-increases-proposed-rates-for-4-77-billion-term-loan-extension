First Data Corp., the credit-card
processor acquired by KKR & Co. in 2007 for $27.5 billion,
increased the interest rate itâ€™s offering lenders to extend a
portion of its loans, according to a person briefed on the
transaction.  The Atlanta-based company will pay lenders delaying
maturities on $4.77 billion of loans an interest rate 4
percentage points more than the London interbank offered rate,
said the person, who declined to be identified because the terms
are private. The company had initially offered to increase the
margin to 3.75 percentage points.  Credit Suisse Group AG and Citigroup Inc. are arranging the
amendment that would extend $3 billion of term loans to March
2018 from September 2014 and a $1.77 billion revolving  credit
line  to June 2015 from September 2013, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The loans currently have a 2.75
percentage point margin over Libor, the rate banks charge to
lend to each other.           Lenders have until 5 p.m. to submit responses to the banks,
the person familiar with the talks said. The extension is
contingent on the sale of at least $750 million of notes in 90
days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
