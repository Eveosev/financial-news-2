  Genomic Health Inc. (GHDX) , maker of a
gene test that helps identify which breast cancer patients will
benefit from chemotherapy, said using the technology changed
treatment choices 33 percent of the time in European studies.  Chemotherapy was used 17 percent less often in  Germany  and
14 percent less often in the U.K. when breast cancer patients
were given the test before their doctors made decisions about
how to treat them, the Redwood City, California-based company
said in a statement. The findings were presented at the  St.
Gallen International Breast Cancer Conference  in  St. Gallen ,
Switzerland.  The test examines 21 different genes in tissue samples
taken from a woman’s breast tumor to assess her chances of being
helped by chemotherapy and her odds of having a recurrence.
Genomic Health is conducting studies to support coverage of the
test’s use by medical insurers and government health programs
and build sales, Chairman Randal Scott said in an interview
yesterday.  The test provides “further insight into the underlying
tumor biology of  breast cancer ” and “gives me greater
confidence in selecting the most appropriate treatment option
based on that patient’s individual disease,” Simon Holt, a
breast surgeon at the Hywel Dda NHS Trust Board in Wales and
leader of the U.K. study, said in the statement.  Genomic Health fell 60 cents, or 2.5 percent, to $23.16 at
4 p.m. New York time in Nasdaq Stock Market composite trading.
The shares have gained 21 percent in the past 12 months.  To contact the reporter on this story:  Rob Waters  in San Francisco at
