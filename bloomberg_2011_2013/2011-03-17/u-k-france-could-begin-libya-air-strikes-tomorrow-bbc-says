The U.K.â€™s armed forces could be in
action over Libya by tomorrow should the United Nations pass a
resolution enacting a no-fly zone tonight, the  BBC  reported,
citing unidentified senior government people. Air strikes could
begin with unilateral actions by the British and French air
forces, with logistical support from Arab allies, the BBC said,
without attribution.  To contact the reporter on this story:
