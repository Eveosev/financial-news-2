Yuan non-deliverable forwards fell
to a six-week low as the risk of radiation leaking from a
nuclear power plant in  Japan  prompted investors to favor safe-
haven assets such as the dollar.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index of regional stocks dropped 0.4
percent after the head of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission
told lawmakers the Fukushima Dai-Ichi plant is releasing
“extremely high” levels of radiation that could be life-
threatening. The yen reached the strongest level since World War
II on speculation Japanese investors will sell overseas assets
and repatriate funds.  “The uncertainties arising from the Japan nuclear crisis
drove investors back into risk-aversion mode,” said Kenix Lai,
a foreign-exchange analyst at Sun Hung Kai Financial Securities
Ltd. in Hong Kong. “Market sentiment is poor.”  Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards fell 0.02 percent to
6.4615 per dollar as of 5:05 p.m. in  Hong Kong , reflecting bets
the yuan will strengthen 1.7 percent in a year, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The contracts touched 6.4675, the
weakest level since Feb. 1.  The yuan fell 0.05 percent closing at 6.5744 per dollar in  Shanghai , from 6.5713 yesterday, according to the  China  Foreign
Exchange Trade System. It touched 6.5628 on March 7, the highest
since China unified official and market exchange rates at the
end of 1993.  The People’s Bank of China set the currency’s reference
rate 0.04 percent stronger at 6.5690 per dollar. The currency is
allowed to trade up to 0.5 percent on either side of the
official rate.  Japan faces a “serious situation,” Yukiya Amano, head of
the  International Atomic Energy Agency , told reporters in Vienna
before departing for talks with authorities in  Tokyo  today.
Foreign governments began evacuating citizens from Japan’s
