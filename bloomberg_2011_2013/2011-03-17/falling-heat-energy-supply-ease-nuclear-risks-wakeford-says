Richard Wakeford, a professor at
the University of Manchester’s  Dalton Nuclear institute ,
comments on the importance of reconnection of electricity at the
Fukushima Dai-Ichi atomic plant  On reconnecting electricity:  “We don’t know how much damage has been done to the pipes.
If the pipes are intact then you’re O.K. and there is nothing to
suggest that when the generators were on that there wasn’t
cooling water being delivered.”  “The reconnection of the electricity supply is very good
news, but it depends on there being water to pump and there
being no major break in the pipes. Whether you can supply enough
water to the cooling ponds is very difficult to know.”  On radioactive decay heat falling:  “Over the last few days, the radioactive decay heat has
dropped dramatically, but there is still enough heat there where
if you leave the water level, you start getting the cladding
breaking down. Depending on the power level of reactors when
they were shut, they can take one to two weeks to cool down.”  “This situation is nothing like Chernobyl where the blowup
radiated fuel way up in the air. You’re not seeing that here and
the ground level release does not go far.”  If fuel melts and gets out of the containment vessel:  “The fuel would start dropping into suppression well and
it’s designed to do that. So ultimately you’d get a load of
molten fuel in there. It’s a mess, but the containment is
maintained.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
