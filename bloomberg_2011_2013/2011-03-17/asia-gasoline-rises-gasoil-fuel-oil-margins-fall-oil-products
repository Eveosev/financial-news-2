Asia gasoline rose for the first
time in five days as refineries continued to run at reduced
output in quake-hit Japan. Refining margins for gasoil, naphtha
and  fuel oil  declined.  Light Distillates  Open-specification naphtha for delivery to Japan rose 1.4
percent to $940 a metric ton, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Benchmark 92-RON gasoline gained 0.4 percent to $114.65 a
barrel, the first increase since March 10. Gasoline’s premium to
Brent fell $1.45 to $2.18 a barrel, Bloomberg data showed.  The premium of Japan-delivered naphtha to Brent, or the
crack spread, fell to $93.10 a ton from $97.66 at the end of
Asian trading yesterday, Bloomberg data showed.  Gasoline’s premium to naphtha narrowed $1.10 to $11.80 a
barrel, Bloomberg data showed. A narrower reforming margin means
the profit from turning naphtha into gasoline is decreasing.  Blackouts and a lack of gasoline are hindering businesses
from returning to normal, according to an official at the Bank
of  Japan ’s Aomori branch.  Cargill Inc. sold 25,000 tons of naphtha for second-half
May delivery to Royal Dutch Shell Plc at $941 a ton, traders
said.  Middle Distillates  Gasoil, or diesel, with 0.5 percent sulfur, rose 1.3
percent to $129.75 a barrel, retracing yesterday’s losses. Jet
fuel rose 0.9 percent to $130.85 a barrel.  The premium of gasoil to Dubai crude, a measure of refining
profit for the fuel, fell $1.48 to $22.61 a barrel, Bloomberg
data showed. Yesterday the crack spread surged to $24.09 a
barrel, the widest since Sept. 26, 2008, as refinery outages in
Japan led to shortages.  PetroChina Co. plans to ship 220,000 metric tons of fuel to
Japan to aid disaster recovery following the March 11
earthquake, President Zhou Jiping said in  Hong Kong  today.  China International United Petroleum & Chemical Corp., also
known as Unipec, bought 150,000 barrels of gasoil with 0.5
percent sulfur from Shell at a premium of 10 cents a barrel over
benchmark prices. The cargo was for loading April 1 to April 5.  PetroChina bought 250,000 barrels of gasoil with 0.25
percent sulfur from Total SA at a premium of $1.10 a barrel over
prices of the 0.5-percent sulfur grade published by Platts in
the remaining days of March.  Vitol Group bought 150,000 barrels of jet fuel loading
April 1 to April 5 from BP Plc at a discount of 10 cents to
benchmark prices for March 17 and March 31.  Fuel Oil  Asian benchmark 180-centistoke fuel oil fell 1.4 percent to
$634 a ton, according to Bloomberg data. The price of 380-
centistoke fuel oil, mainly used as marine fuel, declined 1
percent to $618.50 a ton.  Fuel oil’s discount to Dubai crude, or the crack spread,
doubled to $8.85 a barrel from $4.37, Bloomberg data showed.    Singapore ’s stockpiles of residues, or fuel oil, declined
for a third week, data from a unit of the Ministry of Trade and
Industry showed.  Onshore inventories of residues, including fuel oil and
low-sulfur waxy residue and excluding bitumen, fell 2.3 percent
to 18.5 million barrels in the seven days to March 16, the
longest losing streak since the three weeks to Jan. 6.  Refinery News  Four ethylene plants in eastern Japan were halted because
of the March 11 earthquake, Jiji newspaper reported, citing
Kyohei Takahashi, chairman of the Japan Petrochemical Industry
Association. The plant shutdowns in Kashima, Chiba and Kawasaki
will reduce the country’s output capacity by 25 percent,
Takahashi said.  Kyokuto Petroleum Industries Ltd., a joint venture between
Exxon Mobil Corp. and Mitsui & Co., said it’s restarting its
175,000 barrel-a-day refinery in Chiba, Japan, according to a
statement on its web site.  Japan is preparing to boost refinery production in the west
of the country to increase supplies to the north, damaged by the
March 11 earthquake, according to a trade ministry statement.
Reserves in western Japan will be used to supply the Kanto
region, which includes  Tokyo , the statement said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
