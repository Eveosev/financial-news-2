  Morgan Stanley (MS) , the sixth-largest
U.S. bank by assets, was sued by employees who alleged their
stock-option and retirement savings plans sustained losses in
2008 because the company invested too heavily in its own shares.  G. Kenneth Coulter of  Florida  and five other participants
in the plans said in a complaint in  Manhattan  federal court that
the New York-based bank and its directors breached their
fiduciary duty by failing to manage the plans’ assets and by not
providing accurate information.  At the end of 2007, the plans held about $2.2 billion worth
of Morgan Stanley stock, according to the complaint. The value
of the company stock in the plans fell to about $673 million by
the end of 2008, the plaintiffs said. The plaintiffs are seeking
proceeds on behalf of employees who participated in the plans
from Jan. 2, 2008, to Dec. 31, 2008.  “Morgan Stanley and its stock were exposed to
extraordinary risk as a result of the financial perils of the
entire banking sector,” the plaintiffs said. “Company stock
was an imprudent, inappropriate and exceedingly risky
investment.”  Mark Lake, a spokesman for Morgan Stanley, declined to
comment on the lawsuit, which is related to a class-action suit
filed in federal court in  New York  in 2007 being presided over
by U.S. District Judge  Deborah Batts .  The case is Coulter v. Morgan Stanley, 11-CV-1849, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
