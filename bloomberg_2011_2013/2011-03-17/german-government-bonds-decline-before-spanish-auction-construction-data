German  government bonds  fell as a
stock-market recovery and lower Spanish borrowing costs at a
debt auction today sapped demand for the safest assets.  Ten-year German yields rose after reaching the lowest in
two months yesterday and two-year notes snapped a nine-day
streak of gains. European stocks halted a six-day slide amid
speculation Group of Seven nations will move to calm markets
that have been roiled by the nuclear disaster that followed last
week’s earthquake in  Japan .  France  also sold debt today.  Yields are “a little bit higher today and equities are up
a little bit -- it’s a small bounce,” said  Luca Jellinek , head
of European interest-rate strategy at Credit Agricole SA’s
corporate and investment banking unit in  London . “The Spanish
auction was okay, and that’s a risk-supportive event.”  Bund yields rose nine basis points to 3.18 percent as of
4:27 p.m. in London, after reaching 3.07 percent yesterday, the
lowest since Jan. 18. The 2.5 percent security due January 2021
fell 0.705, or 7.05 euros per 1,000-euro ($1,402) face amount,
to 94.36. Yields on two-year notes increased 11 basis points to
1.59 percent.  G-7 finance chiefs will hold talks tomorrow on the economic
and financial impact of Japan’s March 11 earthquake, which
triggered a tsunami and damaged the cooling systems of a nuclear
power plant north of  Tokyo . The crisis sent world stock markets
slumping and drove the yen to a post-World War II high.  Spanish Auction    Spain  sold 4.1 billion euros of 10-year debt and 30-year
securities, its first auction since European leaders agreed
March 12 to increase the capacity of the European Union’s
emergency bailout fund. Demand rose versus the last time
securities of similar maturity were offered Feb. 17, though the
auction missed the maximum 4.5 billion-euro target.  The 10-year bonds were sold at a yield of 5.162 percent and
the 30-year debt at 5.875 percent. In the secondary market, 10-
year securities declined after the sale, increasing the yield by
seven basis points to 5.25 percent.  The “overbidding,” or lower rate for the auction, is a
“sign of a good sale,” said  Huw Worthington , a fixed-income
strategist at  Barclays Capital  in London.  France sold 8.5 billion euros of notes today, and also sold
index-linked bonds maturing in 2016 and 2022. The EU is selling
4.6 billion euros of seven-year bonds to help fund aid to
Ireland and Romania.  Portuguese 10-year yields rose six basis points to 7.56
percent, leaving the additional yield investors demand to hold
the securities instead of bunds at 4.39 percentage points, two
basis points lower than yesterday’s close.  Moody’s Investors Service downgraded  Portugal ’s credit this
week by two steps to A3, four notches above so-called junk
status. Portugal’s Social Democrats, the biggest opposition
group in parliament, said they won’t support new deficit-
reduction measures presented by the government on March 11.  Euro-area construction output increased for the first time
in seven months in January, rising 1.8 percent from December,
the EU’s statistics office in Luxembourg said today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
