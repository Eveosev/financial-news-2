  Air Berlin Plc (AB1) ,  Germany ’s second-
biggest airline, said its net loss widened last year after costs
rose and it incurred losses on derivative financial instruments.  The 2010 net loss of 97.2 million euros ($136 million)
compared with a loss of 9.5 million euros in the year-earlier
period, the Berlin-based company said in a statement today.
Sales rose 14.8 percent to 3.72 billion euros, it said.  “The revenue growth fell short of expectations,” Air
Berlin said. “In particular, the harsh winter in  Europe , the
air-space restrictions imposed as a result of the volcanic
eruption, as well as the air-traffic-controller strike in Spain
and the announcement of strikes against Air Berlin have left a
clear mark in the company´s operational result.”  Earnings of European airlines such as Germany’s  Deutsche
Lufthansa AG (LHA)  were held back in 2010 by strikes, a Europe-wide
flight ban resulting from an  ash cloud  caused by an Icelandic
volcano in the second quarter and heavy snowfall at the end of
the year.  Air Berlin reported an operating loss of 9.3 million euros,
compared with a profit of 28.5 million euros in 2009. The
company’s financial result amounted to a loss of 133.3 million
euros, compared with a loss of 51 million euros in 2009.  “In addition to losses from the valuation of derivative
financial instruments and decreased foreign exchange gains, the
expenses associated with the repurchase of the 2009 convertible
bonds, amounting to 42.2 million euros, contributed in
particular to increased charges,” Air Berlin said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
