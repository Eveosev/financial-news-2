(Corrects time reference in third paragraph.)  Silver has become so expensive by
comparison with gold that it’s poised to fall, according to
Citigroup Inc.’s global commodities team.  The CHART OF THE DAY compares the price of the precious
metals for immediate delivery since 1980, when the billionaire
Hunt brothers’ effort to corner the silver market collapsed, and
displays the gold-silver ratio.  As the bottom panel shows, 41.6 ounces of silver cost as
much as one ounce of gold at the end of February. The ratio
bottomed on March 11 at 39.5, the lowest since October 1983.  Silver appears vulnerable to losses even though investment
and industrial demand have surged amid relatively stable supply,
the team wrote yesterday in a report. The metal is increasingly
being used in batteries, electronics, identification tags,
medical equipment, plasma display screens, solar panels,
textiles and water purification, they wrote.  “Much of this has been priced into the market,” Citigroup
said, adding that “positive fundamentals” aren’t sufficient to
counter the threat of losses.  Even so, silver is likely to hold above its recent lows
through the rest of the first half, in the bank’s view. This
year’s low in the  spot market  was $26.40 an ounce, reached on
Jan. 28.  (To save a copy of the chart, click here.)  To contact the reporter on this story:  David Wilson  in New York at
