  Australia ’s dollar dropped to the
lowest level in almost seven months against the yen on concern a
nuclear crisis in  Japan , its second-largest trading partner,
will slow the economy and prompt an interest-rate cut.    New Zealand ’s dollar, nicknamed the kiwi, weakened versus
all of its 16 most-traded counterparts as investors lost
appetite for currencies linked to global growth. The Aussie fell
versus 13 of its major peers on speculation the Reserve Bank of
Australia may lower rates next month after Japan’s worst
earthquake killed thousands and damaged a nuclear plant.  “Panic hit markets in the U.S. and  Europe , and if that’s
sustained, we will probably get that RBA cut that is priced,”
said  Adam Carr , senior economist at ICAP Australia Ltd. in
Sydney.  The Australian dollar fell 1.2 percent to 77.40 yen at 1:46
p.m. in New York, from 78.30 yesterday. It touched 74.48 yen,
the lowest level since Aug. 25. The Aussie slipped 0.3 percent
to 98.13 U.S. cents.  New Zealand’s dollar slid 2.2 percent to 56.67 yen, from
57.95. The kiwi declined 1.5 percent to 71.74 U.S. cents, from
72.81 cents.  The Reserve Bank of New Zealand cut its key interest rate
last week to a record low 2.5 percent, citing the economic
damage of an earthquake that struck Christchurch last month. It
was the nation’s deadliest temblor since 1931. Consumer
confidence plunged to the lowest level in two years this
quarter, data showed today, after the quake hurt sentiment.  RBA Governor Glenn Stevens left Australia’s cash rate
unchanged at 4.75 percent this month for a third straight
meeting, saying the current level is “mildly restrictive.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
