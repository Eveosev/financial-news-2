The yen fell as Group of Seven
officials were scheduled to discuss the aftermath of last week’s
earthquake in  Japan  amid speculation governments may intervene
to weaken the currency after it reached a post-World War II
high.  The yen slid to 79.24 per dollar as of 7:15 a.m. in  Tokyo 
from 78.89 yesterday in  New York . Japan’s currency declined to
111.09 against the euro from 110.61.  To contact the reporter on this story:
