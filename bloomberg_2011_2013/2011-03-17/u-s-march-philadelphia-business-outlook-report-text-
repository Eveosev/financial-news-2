The following is the text of the
Philadelphia area manufacturing activity from the  Federal Reserve
Bank of Philadelphia .  Results from the Business Outlook Survey suggest that regional manufacturing
activity continued to show improvement in March. The survey’s broadest
indicators either improved from their readings in February or remained at
relatively high levels.  Increases in input prices continue to be widespread,
and more firms have been reporting increases in prices for their
manufactured goods in recent months. The survey’s broad indicators of future
activity also showed notable improvement this month. Most firms also
indicated that they expect acceleration in production over the next quarter.  Indicators Suggest Growth Picked Up
The survey’s broadest measure of manufacturing conditions, the diffusion
index of current activity, increased from 35.9 in February to 43.4 this
month (see Chart).  This is the highest reading since January 1984.  The
demand for manufactured goods is showing continued strength: The new orders
index increased 17 points this month, the sixth consecutive monthly increase.
The shipments index was little changed this month and remains at a high
level.  Firms also reported that unfilled orders and delivery times rose
again this month. Twice as many firms reported increases in inventories this
month (24 percent) than reported decreases (12 percent). And the current
inventory index has now been positive for three consecutive months and is at
its highest reading in four years.  FirmsEresponses continue to indicate overall improved labor market
conditions.
The current employment index fell back 5 points, but for the seventh
consecutive month, the percentage of firms reporting an increase in
employment (25 percent) is higher than the percentage reporting a decline (7
percent).   Over twice as many firms reported a longer workweek (25 percent)
than reported a shorter one (12 percent).  Firms Continue to Report Higher Prices
Firms continue to report price increases for inputs as well as their own
manufactured goods. The prices paid index declined 3 points this month but
has still increased 51 points over the past six months. Sixty-four percent
of the firms reported higher prices for inputs this month.  On balance,
firms also reported a rise in prices for manufactured goods:  The prices
received index increased 2 points and has steadily increased in recent
months. Thirty-two percent of firms reported higher prices of their own
goods this month, compared with 29 percent in February.  Manufacturing Outlook Improves
The future general activity index increased 16 points, to a reading of 63.0,
its highest reading since February 1993 (see Chart). The indexes for future
new orders and shipments also improved, increasing 18 and 8 points,
respectively.
Continuing to reflect optimism about employment expansion in the
manufacturing sector, the future employment index increased 6 points. More
firms expect to increase employment over the next six months (33 percent)
than expect to decrease employment (2 percent).  In special questions this month, firms were asked about their expectations
for production growth for the upcoming second quarter (see Special
Questions).  Over 75 percent of the firms expect increases in production in
the second quarter; 10 percent expect decreases. This is in contrast to the
situation in March of last year, when 57 percent of the firms were expecting
growth and 17 percent were expecting declines in production.  Sixty-six
percent of the firms said second quarter production growth would represent
an acceleration in growth (16 percent characterized it as “significant
accelerationE 49 percent said the expected growth represented “some
accelerationE.  Summary  According to respondents to the March Business Outlook Survey, the region’s
manufacturing sector continued to expand this month. The survey’s broad
indicators remain at high levels, and responses suggest a notable
improvement in new orders this month. Increases in input prices continue to
be reported, and more firms have been reporting higher prices for their own
manufactured goods in recent months.  Firmsoutlook for the next six months
also showed a notable improvement this month.
