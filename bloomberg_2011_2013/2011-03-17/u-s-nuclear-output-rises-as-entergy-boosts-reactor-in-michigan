U.S. nuclear-power output rose 0.7
percent after rates increased at the Calvert Cliffs 2 reactor in  Maryland  and Entergy Corp. boosted its Palisades unit on Lake
Michigan, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission said.  Production nationwide increased by 619 megawatts from
yesterday to 87,161 megawatts, or 86 percent of capacity,
according to a report today from the NRC and data compiled by
Bloomberg. Fifteen of the nationâ€™s 104 reactors were offline.  Constellation Nuclear Energy Group LLC , a joint venture of  Constellation Energy Group Inc. (CEG)  and Electricite de France SA,
boosted its 867-megawatt Calvert Cliffs 2 reactor to 83 percent
of capacity from 56 percent yesterday.  Another reactor at the plant, the 867-megawatt Calvert
Cliffs 1, is operating at full power. The plant is located 38
miles (61 kilometers) south of Annapolis.    Entergy Corp. (ETR)  increased its 778-megawatt Palisades reactor
to full power from 52 percent of capacity yesterday. The plant
is located 37 miles west of Kalamazoo, Michigan.  Some reactors close for maintenance and refueling during
the spring and fall in the U.S., when demand for heating and
cooling is lower. The outages can increase consumption of
natural gas and coal to generate electricity.  The average U.S. reactor  refueling outage  lasted 41 days in
2009, according to the  Nuclear Energy Institute .  To contact the reporter on this story:
