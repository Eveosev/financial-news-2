Turkish police carried out
synchronized raids on 40 addresses and arrested 20 people with
alleged grudges against Ibrahim Tatlises, a singer shot with a
Kalashnikov in downtown Istanbul on March 13,  Hurriyet  said.  Police compiled a list of Tatlises’s possible enemies and
received court permission to track them, the newspaper said.
Cell-phone data from two people on the list showed they were
near the crime scene a week before the shooting, Hurriyet said,
citing police. The data also showed the men called a long-time
enemy of Tatlises’s, Abdullah Ucmak, who was arrested in the
roundup, it said.  The Kalashnikov used in the shooting was found at the home
of Ucmak’s girlfriend, according to the newspaper.  Tatlises was shot in the head and was woken from an induced
coma for the first time yesterday, when he was able to speak and
respond to questions, Hurriyet said, citing his doctors. The
singer is unable to move his left arm and part of his skull has
been implanted into his abdomen, it said. His doctors say the
immediate risk to his life has fallen to 10 percent from 80
percent, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
