The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the
biggest business association, and a Chinese counterpart set up a
group to allow chief executive officers from the two countries
to exchange views on policy.  “U.S. CEOs have established dialogues with counterparts in  Europe , Latin America and other parts of the world,” Chamber
President  Tom Donohue , head of a delegation visiting Beijing,
said in a statement today. “These exchanges promote trust and
understanding, and provide well-informed CEOs with an informal
mechanism to exchange views on economic and commercial policy
issues and offer recommendations to their governments.”  An inaugural dialogue in Beijing today was attended by
executives including People’s Bank of China Governor Zhou Xiaochuan, Carlyle Group co-founder Daniel D’Aniello and  Lenovo
Group Ltd. (992)  Chairman Liu Chuanzhi among others. Earlier, the U.S.
delegation met with Premier Wen Jiabao at Beijing’s Zhongnanhai
leadership compound.  China’s relations with the U.S. are being carried out in a
“good atmosphere,” Foreign Minister  Yang Jiechi  said last
week, after ties were strained by disputes over currency and
monetary policies and U.S. arms sales to Taiwan.  --Michael Forsythe. Editors: Ben Holland, Karl Maier.  To contact the Bloomberg News staff on this story:
