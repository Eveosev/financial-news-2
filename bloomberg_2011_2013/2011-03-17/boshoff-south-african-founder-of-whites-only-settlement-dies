Carel Boshoff, who founded a white
segregationist settlement known as Orania in  South Africa â€™s
North Cape Province, died yesterday, his Oranje Movement said.
He was 83.  A theology professor, Boshoff moved to Orania in 1993. It
was the only town in South Africa reserved exclusively for
whites following the end of apartheid rule in 1994.  Boshoff was diagnosed with cancer in 2008 and his condition
worsened in the past few months, the Orania Movement said on its
 website . He is survived by six children and 23 grandchildren.  To contact the reporter on this story:
