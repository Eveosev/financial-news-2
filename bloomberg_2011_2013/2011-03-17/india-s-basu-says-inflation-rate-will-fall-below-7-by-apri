  Kaushik Basu , chief economic
adviser to India’s Finance Ministry, comments on inflation and
rising international crude prices. He spoke at a media briefing
in  New Delhi  today.  The  Reserve Bank of India  today raised  interest rates  for
the eighth time in a year and raised its inflation forecast
twice in three months. The repurchase rate was raised to 6.75
percent from 6.5 percent the reverse-repurchase rate to 5.75
percent from 5.5 percent.  “The inflation rate in the month of March will go down but
will not go below 7.5 percent. I am expecting a sharper drop in
inflation in April and I expect it to go below 7 percent. So the
inflation trajectory is looking good.”  On crude prices:  “If it remains high, it will put pressure on our fiscal
calculation. In the  finance ministry  we are very serious about
our fiscal target. If it sustains at high level, we will have to
look at other ways to tackle it, potentially without giving in
on our fiscal target.”  On diesel prices:  “If prices rise, either we do a one-time increase or take
it on the fiscal side. My own preference is, if you confront the
choice like this, it is worthwhile to consider diesel price
deregulation.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
