Japanese equities pared declines as
the yen’s retreat from a record eased pressure on exporters amid
optimism that a reconnected power line and more workers will
help avert a nuclear disaster in the world’s third-largest
economy.  The  Nikkei 225  fell 1.4 percent to 8,962.67 at the 3 p.m.
close in  Tokyo  after falling 5 percent. The broader Topix index
dropped 0.8 percent to 810.8 with five stocks rising for every
three that fell. Eleven of the 33 industry groups in the index,
which briefly swung to a gain in the afternoon, advanced.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
