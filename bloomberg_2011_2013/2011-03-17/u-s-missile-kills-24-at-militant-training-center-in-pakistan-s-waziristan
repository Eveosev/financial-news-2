A missile attack by U.S. pilotless
aircraft killed at least 24 Islamic militant guerrillas at a
training center in North Waziristan, on the Afghan border, a
Pakistani army press officer said.  Missiles struck in Datta Khel, an area of rocky mountains,
said the officer, speaking by phone in the northwestern
provincial capital of  Peshawar . He said his orders don’t permit
him to be cited by name.  The men killed were fighters of a local Pakistani Taliban
commander, Hafiz Gul Bahadur, who dominates Datta Khel, about 16
kilometers (10 miles) east of North Waziristan’s main town,
Miranshah, said Haroon Khan, a rescue worker reached by phone in
Miranshah.  Under Bahadur, Datta Khel is a center for militants of
Afghan Taliban commander Jalaluddin Haqqani, as well as al-Qaeda,
according to Bill Roggio, editor of the  Long War Journal , an
independent, U.S.-based organization that monitors the U.S.
military campaigns against militant groups.  The missile strike was the fifth in four days in  Pakistan ’s
semi-autonomous tribal zone along the Afghan border, according
to a database of attacks maintained by the journal. The U.S.
paused missile attacks in the zone from Jan. 23 until Feb. 20,
it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
