Goalkeeper Jens Lehmann has come
out of retirement to rejoin Arsenal until the end of the season,
the Premier League club said on its website.  Lehmann, 41, signed a monthly rolling contract to serve as
back up to  Manuel Almunia  following injuries to Lukasz
Fabianski, Wojciech Szczesny and Vito Mannone.  “Lehmann is a great short-term signing for us and will be
a valuable asset during a crucial time of the season,” Arsenal
manager  Arsene Wenger  said. “Jens has kept himself very fit
during this season and will provide quality backup to Manuel
Almunia.”  Lehmann made 199 appearances for Arsenal from 2003-08. He
played every game in the Gunners’ unbeaten run to the Premier
League title in 2003-04 and also helped the club to the F.A. Cup
title in 2006.  “I’m very excited to be rejoining Arsenal,” Lehmann  said .
“I have many great memories from my previous time at the club
and Arsenal has always had a place in my heart.”  Lehmann returned to Germany in 2008 and spent two years at
Stuttgart before announcing his retirement after last season.  He’ll be available for Arsenal’s game at West Bromwich in
two days, the club said. Arsenal is second in the Premier
League, three points behind  Manchester United .  To contact the reporter on this story:
