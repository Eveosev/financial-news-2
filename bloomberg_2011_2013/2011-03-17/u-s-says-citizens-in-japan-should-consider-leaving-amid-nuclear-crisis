U.S. citizens in  Japan  should
consider leaving the country, the State Department said, citing
the “deteriorating” situation at the earthquake-stricken
Fukushima nuclear power plant.  “The State Department strongly urges U.S. citizens to
defer travel to Japan at this time and those in Japan should
consider departing,” it said today in an e-mailed statement.  The U.S. joins countries including France and  Germany  in
recommending citizens consider leaving Japan as foreign
governments took a more pessimistic view of Japan’s battle to
contain damage to nuclear reactors at the Fukushima power
station. The U.S. previously advised citizens living within 50
miles (80 kilometers) of the plant to leave the area or stay
indoors if evacuation wasn’t practical.  The latest advisory cited a ’’possibility of lower-level
radioactive materials reaching greater distances’’ than the 50-
mile zone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
