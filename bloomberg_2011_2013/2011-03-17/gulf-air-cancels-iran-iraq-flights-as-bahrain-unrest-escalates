Gulf Air, Bahrainâ€™s state-owned
carrier, canceled all flights to and from  Iran  and Iraq and
temporarily shut sales offices in the capital city of Manama, as
the Gulf state declared a state of emergency.  The airline plans to resume flights to Iran on March 21 and
to Iraq on March 18, it said in a statement on its website. The
carrier canceled services on four routes to Iraq and Iran each.  Bahrain declared a three-month state of emergency this week
after troops from  Saudi Arabia  and other Gulf states arrived to
help quell a month of protests driven by majority Shiites, who
are calling for democracy and civil rights.  To contact the reporter on this story:
