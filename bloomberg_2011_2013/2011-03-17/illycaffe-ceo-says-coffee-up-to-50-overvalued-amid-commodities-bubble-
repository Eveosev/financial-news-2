Coffee in  New York  is as much as 50
percent overvalued as speculators drive up futures prices,
helping inflate a global commodities “bubble,” Illycaffe SpA
Chief Executive Officer Andrea Illy said.  A more “reasonable” price for coffee would be between
$1.80 and $2.20 per pound, Illy said today in an interview in  Sao Paulo . Coffee could fall to as low as $1.50 a pound should
output increase and global stockpiles rebound, he said.  Futures, which rose to $2.9665 a pound on March 9, the
highest since May 1997, more than doubled in the past year on
concern rising world demand will outpace supply amid adverse
weather in Latin America, the main grower of arabica coffee.
Farmers in  Brazil  and other producing nations may seek to boost
output to take advantage of higher prices, according to Illy.  “Coffee is trapped in the middle of a huge commodities
speculation,” said Illy, who heads the company founded by his
grandfather in Trieste,  Italy , in 1933. “We are now in a bubble
for all commodities, and the bubble will burst for sure.”  Global output may rise 10 percent in the next crop year as
growers are encouraged to invest more in their crops, Illy said.
Still, consumer demand may slow to 1 percent this year from 1.5
percent in 2010 on higher costs, he said.  Price ‘Correction’  Rising output combined with slower consumption growth “may
create already next year conditions for a significant correction
in the pricing,” he said.  Illycaffe may pass on rising costs to consumers this year
even after boosting prices by 10 percent last year, Illy said.
The increase may take place in the June, July or August period,
when the company purchases its beans from producers, he said.
Brazilian beans account for half of the company’s blends.  Brazilian production of the commodity this year will
probably be between 45 million and 47 million bags, the highest
crop in a low-yielding cycle, compared with a record crop of 55
million bags last year, he said.  Brazil may harvest between 41.9 million bags and 44.7
million bags this year, compared with 48.1 million bags last
year, the Agriculture Ministry said on Jan. 6. One bag of coffee
weighs 60 kilograms (132 pounds).  Arabica coffee for May delivery advanced 5.05 cents, or 1.9
percent, to $2.7205 a pound at 11:59 a.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in
New York. Robusta coffee for May delivery rose $117, or 4.7
percent, to $2,604 a metric ton on NYSE Liffe in  London  after
reaching $2,615, the highest level since March 13, 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
