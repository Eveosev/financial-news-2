Following is the text of the
Feb. consumer prices from the Labor Department.  The  Consumer Price Index  for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) increased
  0.5 percent in February on a seasonally adjusted basis, the U.S.
  Bureau of Labor Statistics reported today. Over the last 12 months,
  the all items index increased 2.1 percent before seasonal adjustment.  Though the seasonally adjusted increase in the all items index was
  broad-based, the energy index was once again the largest contributor.
  The gasoline index continued to rise, and the index for household
  energy turned up in February with all of its components posting
  increases. Food indexes also continued to rise in February, with
  sharp increases in the indexes for fresh vegetables and meats
  contributing to a 0.8 percent increase in the food at home index, the
  largest since July 2008.  The index for all items less food and energy rose in February as
  well. Most of its major components posted increases, including the
  indexes for shelter, new vehicles, medical care, and airline fares.
  The apparel index was one of the few to decline.  The 12-month changes in major indexes continue to trend upward. The
  all items index increased 2.1 percent for the 12 months ending
  February; the figure was 1.1 percent as recently as November. The 12-
  month increase in the index for all items less food and energy
  reached 1.1 percent in February after being as low as 0.6 percent in
  October. The 11.0 percent increase in the energy index is the largest
  since May 2010, while the 2.3 percent rise in the food index is the
  largest since May 2009.   Table A. Percent changes in CPI for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U): U.S. city

Consumer Price Index Data for February 2011  Food  The food index rose 0.6 percent in February after rising 0.5 percent
  in January. The food at home index, up 0.7 percent in January, rose
  0.8 percent in February. Five of the six major grocery store food
  groups posted increases. The index for fruits and vegetables
  increased the most, rising 2.2 percent as the fresh vegetables index
  increased 6.7 percent. The index for meats, poultry, fish, and eggs
  advanced 1.2 percent with the index for meats up 1.9 percent. The
  dairy and related products index increased 0.6 percent, as did the
  index for other food at home. The index for nonalcoholic beverages,
  which rose 1.5 percent in January, advanced 0.2 percent in February.
  The index for cereals and bakery products, which was unchanged in
  February, was the only major grocery store food group not to rise.
  Over the past 12 months, the index for food at home has risen 2.8
  percent with all six groups increasing. The index for food away from
  home rose 0.2 percent in February and has risen 1.6 percent over the
  past 12 months.  Energy  The energy index rose 3.4 percent in February and has risen 9.8
  percent over the last three months. The gasoline index continued to
  increase, climbing 4.7 percent in February after a 3.5 percent rise
  in January. (Before seasonal adjustment, gasoline prices rose 2.2
  percent in February.) The index for household energy, which fell 0.2
  percent in January, rose 1.3 percent in February. The fuel oil index
  rose 5.8 percent, the index for natural gas advanced 3.4 percent, and
  the electricity index increased 0.4 percent. The index for gasoline
  has risen 19.2 percent over the last 12 months; the household energy
  index has increased 1.4 percent over that span, with the fuel oil and
  electricity indexes rising but the index for natural gas declining.  All items less food and energy  The index for all items less food and energy rose 0.2 percent in
  February, the same increase as in January, with most of its major
  components posting increases. The shelter index rose 0.1 percent in
  February, with rent and owners' equivalent rent both also rising 0.1
  percent. After declining in January, the new vehicles index rose 1.0
  percent in February, its largest increase since October 2009. The
  medical care index rose 0.4 percent in February after a 0.1 percent
  increase in January. The index for medical care commodities rose 0.7
  percent and the medical care services index advanced 0.4 percent. The
  index for airline fares increased 2.1 percent in February, its fourth
  consecutive monthly increase of over two percent. The index for
  recreation rose 0.3 percent, its second straight monthly increase.
  The indexes for household furnishings and operations and for used
  cars and trucks both edged up 0.1 percent in February. In contrast to
  these increases, the apparel index turned down in February, declining
  0.9 percent after increasing 1.0 percent in January.  The index for all items less food and energy increased 1.1 percent
  over the last 12 months. The shelter index has gone up 0.8 percent
  over that time period with the rent index up 1.1 percent. The indexes
  for airline fares, medical care, new vehicles, and used cars and
  trucks were among the indexes that increased over that span.  Indexes
  that declined include household furnishings and operations, apparel,
  and recreation.  Not seasonally adjusted CPI measures  The Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) increased
  2.1 percent over the last 12 months to an index level of 221.309
  (1982-84=100). For the month, the index increased 0.5 percent prior
  to seasonal adjustment.  The Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers
  (CPI-W) increased 2.3 percent over the last 12 months to an index
  level of 217.535 (1982-84=100). For the month, the index rose 0.5
  percent prior to seasonal adjustment.  The Chained Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (C-CPI-U)
  increased 2.0 percent over the last 12 months. For the month, the
  index increased 0.5 percent on a not seasonally adjusted basis.
  Please note that the indexes for the post-2009 period are subject to
  revision.  The Consumer Price Index for March 2011 is scheduled to be released
  on Friday, April 15, 2011, at 8:30 a.m. (EDT).  Transmission of material in this release is embargoed until

prices over time of goods and services purchased by households.  The
Bureau of Labor Statistics publishes CPIs for two population groups:
(1) the CPI for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W), which
covers households of wage earners and clerical workers that comprise
approximately 32 percent of the total population and (2) the CPI for
All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) and the Chained CPI for All Urban
Consumers (C-CPI-U), which cover approximately 87 percent of the total
population and include in addition to wage earners and clerical worker
households, groups such as professional, managerial, and technical
workers, the self-employed, short-term workers, the unemployed, and
retirees and others not in the labor force.  The CPIs are based on prices of food, clothing, shelter, and fuels,
transportation fares, charges for doctors' and dentists' services,
drugs, and other goods and services that people buy for day-to-day
living.  Prices are collected each month in 87 urban areas across the
country from about 4,000 housing units and approximately 26,000 retail
establishments-department stores, supermarkets, hospitals, filling
stations, and other types of stores and service establishments.  All
taxes directly associated with the purchase and use of items are
included in the index.  Prices of fuels and a few other items are
obtained every month in all 87 locations.  Prices of most other
commodities and services are collected every month in the three
largest geographic areas and every other month in other areas.  Prices
of most goods and services are obtained by personal visits or
telephone calls of the Bureau's trained representatives.  In calculating the index, price changes for the various items in each
location are averaged together with weights, which represent their
importance in the spending of the appropriate population group.  Local
data are then combined to obtain a U.S. city average.  For the CPI-U
and CPI-W separate indexes are also published by size of city, by
region of the country, for cross-classifications of regions and
population-size classes, and for 27 local areas.  Area indexes do not
measure differences in the level of prices among cities; they only
measure the average change in prices for each area since the base
period.  For the C-CPI-U data are issued only at the national level.
It is important to note that the CPI-U and CPI-W are considered final
when released, but the C-CPI-U is issued in preliminary form and
subject to two annual revisions.  The index measures price change from a designed reference date.  For
the CPI-U and the CPI-W the reference base is 1982-84 equals 100.  The
reference base for the C-CPI-U is December 1999 equals 100.  An
increase of 16.5 percent from the reference base, for example, is
shown as 116.500.  This change can also be expressed in dollars as
follows:  the price of a base period market basket of goods and
services in the CPI has risen from $10 in 1982-84 to $11.65.  For further details visit the CPI home page on the Internet at
 http://www.bls.gov/cpi/  or contact our CPI Information and Analysis
Section on (202) 691-7000.  Note on Sampling Error in the Consumer Price Index  The CPI is a statistical estimate that is subject to sampling error
because it is based upon a sample of retail prices and not the
complete universe of all prices.  BLS calculates and publishes
estimates of the 1-month, 2-month, 6-month and 12-month percent change
standard errors annually, for the CPI-U.  These standard error
estimates can be used to construct confidence intervals for hypothesis
testing.  For example, the estimated standard error of the 1 month
percent change is 0.03 percent for the U.S. All Items Consumer Price
Index.  This means that if we repeatedly sample from the universe of
all retail prices using the same methodology, and estimate a
percentage change for each sample, then 95% of these estimates would
be within 0.06 percent of the 1 month percentage change based on all
retail prices.  For example, for a 1-month change of 0.2 percent in
the All Items CPI for All Urban Consumers, we are 95 percent confident
that the actual percent change based on all retail prices would fall
between 0.14 and 0.26 percent.  For the latest data, including
information on how to use the estimates of standard error, see
"Variance Estimates for Price Changes in the Consumer Price Index,
January-December 2010".  These data are available on the CPI home page
( http://www.bls.gov/cpi ), or by using the following link
 http://www.bls.gov/cpi/cpivar2010.pdf   Calculating Index Changes  Movements of the indexes from one month to another are usually
expressed as percent changes rather than changes in index points,
because index point changes are affected by the level of the index in
relation to its base period while percent changes are not.  The
example below illustrates the computation of index point and percent
changes.  Percent changes for 3-month and 6-month periods are expressed as
annual rates and are computed according to the standard formula for
compound growth rates.  These data indicate what the percent change
would be if the current rate were maintained for a 12-month period.  Index Point Change  CPI

groups, the Bureau of Labor Statistics publishes seasonally adjusted
as well as unadjusted changes each month.  For analyzing general price trends in the economy, seasonally adjusted
changes are usually preferred since they eliminate the effect of
changes that normally occur at the same time and in about the same
magnitude every year--such as price movements resulting from changing
climatic conditions, production cycles, model changeovers, holidays,
and sales.  The unadjusted data are of primary interest to consumers concerned
about the prices they actually pay.  Unadjusted data also are used
extensively for escalation purposes.  Many collective bargaining
contract agreements and pension plans, for example, tie compensation
changes to the Consumer Price Index before adjustment for seasonal
variation.  Seasonal factors used in computing the seasonally adjusted indexes are
derived by the X-12-ARIMA Seasonal Adjustment Method.  Seasonally
adjusted indexes and seasonal factors are computed annually.  Each
year, the last 5 years of seasonally adjusted data are revised.  Data
from January 2006 through December 2010 were replaced in January 2011.
Exceptions to the usual revision schedule were: the updated seasonal
data at the end of 1977 replaced data from 1967 through 1977; and, in
January 2002, dependently seasonally adjusted series were revised for
January 1987-December 2001 as a result of a change in the aggregation
weights for dependently adjusted series. For further information,
please see "Aggregation of Dependently Adjusted Seasonally Adjusted
Series," in the October 2001 issue of the CPI Detailed Report.  Effective with the publication of data from January 2006 through
December 2010 in January 2011, the Video and audio series and the
Information technology, hardware and services series were changed from
independently adjusted to dependently adjusted.  This resulted in an
increase in the number of seasonal components used in deriving
seasonal movement of the All items and 54 other lower level
aggregations, from 73 for the publication of January 1998 through
December 2005 data to 82 for the publication of seasonally adjusted
data for January 2006 and later.  Each year the seasonal status of
every series is reevaluated based upon certain statistical criteria.
If any of the 82 components change their seasonal adjustment status
from seasonally adjusted to not seasonally adjusted, not seasonally
adjusted data will be used in the aggregation of the dependent series
for the last 5 years, but the seasonally adjusted indexes before that
period will not be changed.  Note: 37 of the 82 components are not
seasonally adjusted for 2011.  Seasonally adjusted data, including the all items index levels, are
subject to revision for up to five years after their original release.
For this reason, BLS advises against the use of these data in
escalation agreements.  Effective with the calculation of the seasonal factors for 1990, the
Bureau of Labor Statistics has used an enhanced seasonal adjustment
procedure called Intervention Analysis Seasonal Adjustment for some
CPI series.  Intervention Analysis Seasonal Adjustment allows for
better estimates of seasonally adjusted data.  Extreme values and/or
sharp movements which might distort the seasonal pattern are estimated
and removed from the data prior to calculation of seasonal factors.
Beginning with the calculation of seasonal factors for 1996, X-12-
ARIMA software was used for Intervention Analysis Seasonal Adjustment.  For the seasonal factors introduced in January 2011, BLS adjusted 29
series using Intervention Analysis Seasonal Adjustment, including
selected food and beverage items, motor fuels, electricity and
vehicles.  For example, this procedure was used for the Motor fuel
series to offset the effects of events such as damage to oil
refineries from Hurricane Katrina.  For a complete list of Intervention Analysis Seasonal Adjustment
series and explanations, please refer to the article "Intervention
Analysis Seasonal Adjustment", located on our website at
