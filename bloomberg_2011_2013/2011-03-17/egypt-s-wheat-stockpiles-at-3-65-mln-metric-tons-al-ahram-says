The Egyptian government’s wheat
stockpiles are at 3.65 million metric tons, which is enough to
cover the North African country’s needs for five months,  Al
Ahram  reported, citing Nomani Nomani, vice-chairman of the
state-run General Authority for Supply Commodities.    Egypt ’s sugar stockpiles reached 321,000 tons, which is
enough for three months, in addition to daily production of
8,000 tons, the Cairo-based newspaper cited Nomani as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
