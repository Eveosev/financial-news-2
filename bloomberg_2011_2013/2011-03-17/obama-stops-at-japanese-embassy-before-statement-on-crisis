President  Barack Obama  paid
respects at the Japanese embassy in Washington today and plans
to make a statement on the situation in Japan later today.  Obama declined to answer questions about Japan following a
meeting at the White House with Irish Prime Minister  Enda Kenny ,
saying he would address the issue later. The administration
announced he will make remarks at 3:30 p.m. Washington time.  Japanese authorities are battling to cool quake-damaged
nuclear reactors at a Tokyo Electric Power Co. plant 135 miles
(220 kilometers) north of Tokyo following the March 11
earthquake, the country’s worst on record.  The crisis is nuclear industry’s worst catastrophe since
Chernobyl, and the U.S., U.K., France, Germany and  Australia 
have advised their citizens to consider leaving Tokyo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
