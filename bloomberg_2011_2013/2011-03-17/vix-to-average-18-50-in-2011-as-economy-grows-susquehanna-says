The VIX benchmark index for U.S.
stock options will average 18.50 this year, below its historic
average, as the continuing economic recovery reduces stock-
market swings, Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP said.  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fluctuations are likely to
decrease as the  Federal Reserve  keeps  interest rates  near record
lows to boost economic growth, according to a report from Trevor Mottl, the firm’s head of derivative strategy. That will reduce
stock swings, based on an analysis of post-recessionary periods
over the past five decades, the New York-based strategist said.  “Improving U.S. economic conditions, accommodative
monetary policy, and increased real financial activity will act
to collectively stabilize risk-asset prices, supporting our
forecast of lower realized S&P 500 volatility,” Mottl wrote.  The S&P 500 will have a realized volatility, a gauge of
past stock swings, of 13 this year and average 30-day at-the-
money implied volatility of 16, Mottl said in the report
yesterday. His forecast for the VIX, as the Chicago Board
Options Exchange Volatility Index is known, to average 18.50
compares with a 20.38 average for the gauge over its two-decade
history and an 18.32 average so far this year.  VIX Increases  The VIX, which measures the cost of  S&P 500  options, jumped
21 percent to 29.40 yesterday for its highest close since July
as traders snapped up more options to guard against equity
declines spurred by Japan’s nuclear crisis. The index has soared
46 percent in the past three days for the biggest three-day gain
since May 20, when the index closed at last year’s peak of
45.79, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  After the past seven recessions and the 1987 stock-market
crash, realized volatility for U.S. equities reverted to below-
average levels of 13.60, on average, seven months after stocks
bottomed out, Mottl wrote. The volatility stayed below that
level for the rest of the three-year post-trough period, he
said. The S&P 500 has rallied 86 percent since falling to a 12-
year low on March 9, 2009.  The S&P 500 had a realized volatility of 22.6 from the
March 9 low over the next year, and realized 17.4 over the next
12 months, according to the report.  “Risks associated with our forecast are the economic
impact of continued instability in the Middle East, declining
U.S. economic conditions, increasing budgetary concerns at the
state and municipal levels, and the potential for contagion due
to sovereign risks in the E.U. and macro risks from  Japan ,”
