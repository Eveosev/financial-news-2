The  Bank of Japan  should cut short-
term interest rates to curb the yen’s surge to a postwar record
rather than intervene in  currency markets  on behalf of the
government, according to Credit Suisse Group AG.  “The yen may remain at 78-79 against the dollar unless the
spread in short-term interest rates between Japan and the U.S.
widens” through the interest-rate reductions,  Hiromichi Shirakawa , chief Japan economist at Credit Suisse in Tokyo and a
former Bank of Japan official, wrote in a report today.  The central bank should lower the interest rate on a 30
trillion yen ($378 billion) credit program, as well as the
interest on excess reserves held by financial intuitions at the
BOJ, Shirakawa wrote.  The yen reached as high as 76.36 earlier today, past the
previous post-World War II high of 79.75 reached in April 1995.
Japan’s government ordered the BOJ to sell yen in the market on
Sept. 15 for the first time since 2004 as the currencies climb
last year threatened an export-led economic recovery.  BOJ policy makers on March 14 doubled the size of its
asset-purchase plan to 10 trillion yen and kept the benchmark
interest rate at a range of zero to 0.1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
