Japanese individuals bought the
most domestic stocks in 10 months last week, the  Tokyo  Stock
Exchange said, as the benchmark Topix index fell 4.2 percent.  Net purchases totaled 340.4 billion yen ($4.3 billion) in
the week ended March 11, the most since the week ended May 7,
according to data from the Tokyo bourse that includes exchanges
in Osaka and Nagoya.  “It shows that individual investors trade against the
trend,” said Takahiro Tsuchiya, a strategist at Daiwa Institute
of Research Ltd.  Foreign institutional investors, who represent almost 70
percent of trading in  Japan , bought 68 billion more Japanese
equity than they sold last week, for a 19th consecutive week of
net purchases, today’s data showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
