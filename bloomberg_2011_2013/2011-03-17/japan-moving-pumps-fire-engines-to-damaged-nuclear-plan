  Japan ’s Self-Defense Forces are
transporting water pumps to the damaged nuclear plant in
Fukushima prefecture and plan to spray water from the ground,
Defense Minister Toshimi Kitazawa said.  The pumps will be provided by the U.S. military for use by
the Tokyo Electric Power Co., Kitazawa said, without giving
further details. Eleven fire engines will pour water from the
ground after helicopters dropped water on the Fukushima Dai-Ichi
plant’s No. 3 reactor a total of four times today, he said.  Authorities had hoped to drop water from the air yesterday,
then abandoned the plan because radiation levels were too high,
he said. The operation was conducted today after those levels
dropped, he said.  Police forces will also assist in spraying water onto the
reactors from the ground, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
