  Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4) , Brazil’s
state-controlled oil company, won approval from the U.S. Bureau
of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement to begin
oil and natural-gas production at its Chinook-Cascade project.  Petrobras, as the Rio de Janeiro-based company is known,
will begin production soon at the fields in 8,200 feet of water
in the Gulf of Mexico, the agency said today in an e-mailed
statement. The project has the capacity to produce 80,000
barrels a day of oil and 16 million cubic feet of gas a day.  Chinook-Cascade will be the largest project that Petrobras
starts outside of Brazil this year, Chief Financial Officer  Almir Barbassa  said Feb. 25. Petrobras makes more money from
foreign oil output, which is sold at international prices. The
bulk of Petrobras’s domestic output is refined in  Brazil  and
sold at a discount to international prices, Barbassa said.  Petrobras plans to double oil production by 2020 to 5.4
million barrels a day, mainly from growth in domestic oil
production.  Petrobras rose 0.9 percent in  Sao Paulo  to 28.02 reais at
2:10 p.m. New York time.  To contact the reporters on this story:
