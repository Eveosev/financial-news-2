Advertising spending in the U.S.
rose 6.5 percent last year, led by a rebound in television and
Internet promotions, according to a media research firm.  Total advertising expenditures were $131.1 billion, New
York-based Kantar Media said today in a statement. Fourth-
quarter ad spending rose 7 percent from a year earlier, it said.  Television-ad spending rose 10 percent last year as
politicians campaigned for mid-term elections, people tuned in
for the soccer  World Cup  and car companies and banks increased
budgets after the recession, Kantar said. Internet display
advertising, with growth of 9.9 percent, had the second largest
increase.  Ad spending in magazines climbed 2.9 percent, helped by a
3.3 percent increase in consumer publications.  Newspaper advertising declined 3.5 percent, with local
newspapers falling 4.6 percent. Local newspaper spending has
declined for 21 straight quarters, Kantar said. Ad spending in
national newspapers rose 2.7 percent in 2010 as the Wall Street
Journal expanded publishing, Kantar said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
