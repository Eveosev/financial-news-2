A Muslim leader was killed in  Ivory
Coast ’s commercial capital, Abidjan, after unidentified gunmen
broke into a mosque and opened fire,  l’Inter  reported, without
identifying him.  At least one other person died in the March 15 incident in
the suburb of Port-Bouet 2, which is dominated by supporters of
President-elect Alassane Ouattara, the Abidjan-based newspaper
said, citing Ousmane Diakite, spokesman for the mosque.  Since Ivory Coast’s disputed November elections, at least
10 mosques have been attacked by supporters of incumbent
President  Laurent Gbagbo , who refuses to cede power to Ouattara,
a Muslim, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
