  Thailand ’s baht rose, touching a
two-month high, after overseas investors added to holdings of
the nation’s assets this week.  The currency strengthened for a second day after global
funds bought $17.6 million more Thai shares than they sold this
week through yesterday, exchange data showed. The baht has
gained 0.9 percent this month, the most among Asia’s 10 most-
traded currencies excluding the yen, as local companies and
investors increased the amount of funds they are bringing home
due to  Japan ’s worsening nuclear crisis, said Kozo Hasegawa, a
foreign-exchange trader at Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp.  “The baht probably got a boost from some repatriation
money as nuclear concerns are growing,” said Bangkok-based
Hasegawa.  The baht strengthened 0.4 percent to 30.34 per dollar as of
3:47 p.m. in Bangkok, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The currency earlier touched 30.14, the strongest level since
Jan. 5. It will trade between 30.15 and 30.50 tomorrow, Hasegawa
said.  The yen touched a post-World War II high of 76.36 per
dollar on speculation the nation’s insurers and investors will
redeem overseas assets to pay for damages. Japan is the biggest
investor in Thailand and is the Southeast Asian nation’s second-
largest export market.  “With strong trade ties with Japan, the baht also moved in
tandem with the yen,” said Hasegawa. “The market may be quite
volatile.”    Government bonds  were unchanged. The yield on the 3.125
percent bond due December 2015 held at 3.32 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
