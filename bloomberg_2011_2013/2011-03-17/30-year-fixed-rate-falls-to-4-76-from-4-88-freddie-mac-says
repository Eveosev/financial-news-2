U.S.  mortgage rates  fell to the
lowest in almost two months, tracking a drop in Treasury yields
as  Japan ’s deepening nuclear crisis spurred demand for
relatively safe investments.  The average rate for 30-year fixed loans declined to 4.76
percent in the week ended today from 4.88 percent a week ago,
according to  Freddie Mac . The average 15-year rate was 3.97
percent, down from 4.15 percent in each of the past two weeks,
the McLean, Virginia-based mortgage-finance company said in a
statement.  Yields on 10-year U.S. Treasury notes, which are benchmarks
for some consumer loans, fell this week to the lowest level
since December and stocks sank, reflecting investors’ concern
about the risk of radiation leaks at the Fukushima Dai-Ichi
nuclear plant 135 miles north of  Tokyo .  “There’s been a little flight to -- I don’t want to say
safety -- quality,” said Keith Gumbinger, vice president of  HSH
Associates , a publisher of consumer-loan data in Pompton Plains,  New Jersey . “As long as trouble remains in the forefront,  interest rates  are likely to be lower than they otherwise would
be.”  The drop in rates probably will lead to an increase in
refinancing, Gumbinger said.  Loan Applications  Mortgage applications in the U.S. fell 0.7 percent in the
week ended March 11, according to the  Mortgage Bankers
Association ’s index. The Washington-based group’s measure of
purchase applications declined 4 percent and its refinancing
gauge climbed 0.9 percent.  Housing starts plunged to a 22-month low in February, and
permits for construction fell to a record low, the Commerce
Department said yesterday. U.S. homebuilders are competing with
foreclosures and falling prices for existing homes.  Rates for home loans began climbing from a record low of
4.17 percent in the week ended Nov. 11 and reached a 10-month
high of 5.05 percent in February. The rate decline since then
has pushed the monthly payment for a $300,000 mortgage to about
$1,567 from $1,620.  To contact the reporter on this story: Rebecca McClay in New
