  Australia  should price carbon
emissions at between A$20 and A$30 a ton, rising at 4 percent a
year, when it introduces planned laws aimed at curbing
emissions, government climate change adviser  Ross Garnaut  said.  The price should then float, “without caps or floors, in
mid-2015 unless the independent regulator judges that there are
insufficient international trade opportunities to secure
liquidity and stability,” Garnaut wrote in a report released
today. A framework document the government put out on Feb. 25
didn’t include a carbon price.  Prime Minister  Julia Gillard  wants to set a carbon price
starting in July 2012 in preparation for a trading system that
could begin as early as 2015. The opposition Liberal-National
coalition, led by  Tony Abbott , has vowed to fight the plan,
saying it would add to household electricity bills.  A multiparty climate change committee, formed after a
request from the Greens party, will recommend a strategy before
the government introduces laws to parliament. The committee is
due to meet tomorrow.  Australia, the world’s biggest coal exporter, has set a
target of generating 20 percent of its power from renewable
sources like wind and solar by 2020.  To contact the reporter on this story:
