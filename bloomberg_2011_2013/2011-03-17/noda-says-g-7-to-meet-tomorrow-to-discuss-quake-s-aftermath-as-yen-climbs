Japanese Finance Minister  Yoshihiko Noda  said finance ministers and central bankers of the Group of
Seven industrialized nations will hold a telephone conference
tomorrow to discuss the aftermath of a March 11 earthquake.  French Finance Minister  Christine Lagarde  informed Noda
about the meeting, scheduled to be held tomorrow at 7 a.m. Tokyo
time, Noda told reporters in Tokyo today.  “I will explain the impact of Japan’s earthquake on the
economy, developments in financial markets, and Japan’s
response” to the earthquake, he said. Currencies will be a
topic as they discuss markets, the finance minister said.  Japan’s currency was at 78.97 per dollar as of 1:09 p.m. in
Tokyo, down 3 percent from the high reached earlier today. It’s
advanced 5 percent since the close on March 10, a day before the
disaster struck Japan.  To contact the reporters on this story:
