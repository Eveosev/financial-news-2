Overseas investors sold a net 1.25
billion rupees ($27.6 million) of Indian stocks yesterday,
taking their outflow from equities this year to 71.7 billion
rupees, the nation’s market regulator said.  Foreigners purchased 22.1 billion rupees of shares and sold
23.4 billion rupees, the  Securities and Exchange Board of India 
said  today . They bought a net 8.51 billion rupees of bonds,
bringing total purchases in debt this year to 152.2 billion
rupees.  Global investors, attracted by  India ’s economic expansion,
bought a record 1.33 trillion rupees of shares in 2010, lifting
the benchmark index 17 percent and making it the best performer
among the world’s 10 biggest equity markets. The gauge has shed
11.5 percent this year.  Foreign funds have placed 4.4 trillion rupees in equities
and 939 billion rupees in bonds since they were allowed into the
country in 1993. The previous record was in 2009 when flows
reached 834.2 billion rupees, sparking the biggest advance in 18
years. Funds withdrew a record 530 billion rupees from stocks in
2008, setting off the worst annual slump.  The regulator provides data on shares bought and sold by
large investors, including trades in the primary and secondary
markets, with a delay of at least a day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
