European Union carbon allowances
for December retreated as the  United Nations  indicated that the
supply of offset credits may increase. Natural gas declined.  EU carbon for December fell 1 percent to 17.08 euros a
metric ton as of 9:20 a.m. on  London ’s ICE Future’s  Europe . The
contract lost as much as 25 cents earlier, its biggest decline
since Feb. 3. It closed yesterday at the highest price since
October 2010.  The  supply  of new UN offsets may increase after project
developers boosted requests to 28.9 million metric tons for
delivery from March 18 through April 15, according to a UN
website. That compares with new supply of 6.9 million tons in
February. Offsets are created from emissions-cutting projects
and can be used for compliance in the European system and by
governments with international targets under the  Kyoto treaty .  The premium of EU permits over UN offsets for delivery in
December, traded as a separate spread contract on ICE, shrank 4
cents to 4.20 euros a metric ton. It closed yesterday at the
widest premium since the contract began trading in January 2009.
The UN issued 1.2 million credits yesterday, the highest number
since March 10, UN data on Bloomberg show.  U.K. gas for summer delivery, the six months through
September, slipped 1 percent to 64.75 pence a therm.  To contact the reporter on this story:
