Regulators should strengthen
European Union-wide bank stress tests to better examine lenders’
sovereign debt holdings, said Adam Farkas, the nominee to be the
executive director of the European Banking Authority.  The EBA, which is preparing the exams, could review whether
the tests should include the possibility of a sovereign default,
Farkas said. That possibility was left out of draft scenarios
circulated to banks earlier this month and seen by Bloomberg
News.  “I would personally opt for a stricter approach either in
the form of more disclosure of these assets, if not fully
include them in the tests,” Farkas told lawmakers European
Parliament in Brussels during his confirmation hearing. “If
needed for credibility, I would not hesitate to propose that.”  Last year’s EU stress tests were criticized for not being
stringent enough because lenders in the 27-nation region were
shown by regulators to need only 3.5 billion euros ($4.9
billion) of new capital, about a 10th of the lowest analyst
estimate.  The EBA said on March 2 that it will publish the results of
the 2011 tests in June.
