  Credit Agricole SA (ACA) ,  France ’s third-
largest lender, said it seeks to increase profit by more than
fivefold in 2014, helped by a turnaround at the international
consumer-banking business.  Net income should rise to between 6 billion euros ($8.4
billion) and 7 billion euros in the period, the Montrouge-based
company said today in a statement. That compares with profit
last year of 1.26 billion euros.  Chief Executive Officer Jean-Paul Chifflet, who took over a
year ago, said in December the bank’s strategic plans over the
next 10 years are “less adventurous” compared with the past
decade. To help meet the 2014 profit goal, the lender said it
plans to post earnings of more than 900 million euros at the
international-banking unit after a loss of 928 million euros
last year, as it opens more branches in countries such as Italy.  “The group’s core mission is to be a retail and deposits
bank, and they’re reaffirming it,” said Francois Chaulet, who
helps manage 200 million euros at Montsegur Finance in Paris and
owns the lender’s shares. “It’s reassuring.”    Credit Agricole  fell 15 cents, or 1.3 percent, to 11.14
euros at 1:48 p.m. in Paris trading, reversing earlier gains.
That gives the company a market value of 26.7 billion euros.  The bank expects overall revenue to total more than 25
billion euros in 2014, while return on equity may reach 10
percent to 12 percent in the period.  Credit Agricole had a net loss of 328 million euros in the
fourth quarter, compared with net income of 433 million euros a
year earlier because of a writedown on its stake in Italy’s
Intesa Sanpaolo SpA.  Capital Level  Credit Agricole’s overall loss in the quarter contrasted
with rising earnings at its French competitors.  BNP Paribas (BNP)  SA,  Europe ’s largest bank, last month said fourth-quarter profit
gained 14 percent, helped by higher revenue at its investment
bank.  Societe Generale (GLE)  SA’s net income quadrupled in the period,
helped by a turnaround at its Russian unit and on fewer
writedowns at the corporate and investment bank.  Credit Agricole reiterated today it won’t need to sell new
shares to comply with Basel III capital rules and the bank seeks
to have a Tier 1 common equity ratio, a measure of financial
strength, of more than 8.75 percent in 2014.  The French lender plans to pay a dividend of 35 percent of
profit this year, it said.  The company plans to add 50 branches and 150,000 retail
clients in  Italy  by 2014, where it already has 1.7 million
customers.  “We have been through two or three complex, touchy
years,” Chifflet told reporters today in Montrouge. “Our
priority is to develop in Europe.”  Talks are continuing with  China ’s Citic Securities Co. on
combining investment-banking units in  Asia  and on a “global
platform” for a brokerage, Credit Agricole said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
