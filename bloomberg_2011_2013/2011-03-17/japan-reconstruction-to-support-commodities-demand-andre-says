Sudeshna Andre, a product
specialist with  Amundi Asset Management , comments on the impact
of last week’s earthquake and tsunami in  Japan  on commodity
prices.  Amundi is a joint venture between  France ’s Credit Agricole
SA and Societe Generale SA, with $950 billion under management.
Andre made these comments to reporters in Kuala Lumpur today.  On market reaction:  “The market is in a panic mood. In the short term,
commodities are a risky investment, but in the medium term Japan
needs massive reconstruction and that will support demand for
commodities involved in building, specifically energy.”  On beneficiaries:  “All commodities used in construction, copper of course,
should benefit from the reconstruction.”  On global food prices:  “There’s a major difference between hard commodities and
soft commodities. Food prices will be supported because there
are more people to feed. The story of soft commodities will be a
story of volume growth.”  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
