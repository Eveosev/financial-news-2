Serbia introduced a three-month ban
on wheat and flour exports as the government tries to control
prices of staples, including bread, and slow inflation,
Agriculture Minister Dusan Petrovic told B92 TV Channel last
night.  The temporary measure followed greater-than-planned exports
so far this year, “exceeding the planned 500,000 tons by far
and we are now close to 650,000 tons already,” Petrovic, the
newly appointed Minister of Agriculture said.  The export ban was adopted following “consultations with
the European Union and talks with CEFTA,” he said, referring to
the Central European Free Trade Agreement which also gathers
Albania, Bosnia,  Croatia , Macedonia, Montenegro, Moldova and
Kosovo. CEFTA is Serbia’s main export market.  To contact the reporter on this story:
