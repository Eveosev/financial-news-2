Peru’s sol rose the most in a week
as exporters increased purchases of the currency to pay taxes,
U.S. and European stocks rose and  Japan  moved closer to
restoring power at a nuclear plant.  The sol advanced 0.1 percent to 2.7680 per  U.S. dollar  at
the close of trading, from 2.7705 yesterday.  Peruvian companies led by metal exporters sold dollars to
pay taxes before an annual deadline expiring next month. U.S.
and European stocks rallied amid speculation that Japan will
contain its nuclear crisis and that the Group of Seven nations
will move to calm markets after the March 11 earthquake.  “It’s been a day of strong rallies in equity markets,”
said Gonzalo Navarro, head trader at  Banco Santander  in Lima.
“In March, positive news always carries more weight than
negative news because almost every day there are dollar flows”
from firms paying taxes, he said. Companies took advantage of
two straight days of declines in the sol to purchase the local
currency, Navarro said.  The central bank didn’t buy dollars in the foreign exchange
market today or issue certificates of deposit payable in
dollars.  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-
denominated bond due August 2020 was unchanged at 6.28 percent,
according to Deutsche Bank AG’s local unit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
