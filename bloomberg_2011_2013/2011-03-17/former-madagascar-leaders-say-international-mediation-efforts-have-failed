Madagascar’s three main opposition
groups said international mediation efforts to end a two-year
political and economic crisis have failed.    Marc Ravalomanana , ousted by Andry Rajoelina with the help
of the military in 2009, and former presidents Didier Ratsiraka
and  Albert Zafy , yesterday denounced proposals from Southern
African Development Community mediators to resolve the crisis,
according to an e-mailed statement from the group. The ex-
presidents appealed to SADC leaders to urgently intervene.  “We call on SADC to recognize that their mediation efforts
have failed,” Ravalomanana said in the statement on behalf of
the trio. “SADC’s mediators can now be seen as supporting the
illegal regime in our country, at the expense of the Malagasy
people.”  The reappointment by President Rajoelina of Camille Vital
as prime minister of the country’s transitional government
ignored SADC’s proposals for a government of national unity.  “The prime minister needs to be appointed by the
opposition parties to ensure a balance of power until the
elections,” Ravalomanana said, describing Vital as Rajoelina’s
“closest political ally.”  Vital was chosen after Rajoelina “thought hard and looked
at all the aspects of the situation,” the president told
reporters in Antananarivo, the capital, yesterday. All
nominations for the post from other political parties were taken
into account, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
