Tanzanian President Jakaya Kikwete
blocked plans by the ports authority to build a multi-storey
warehouse for imported vehicles at the  Dar es Salaam  harbor, the
 Daily News  reported.  Instead, the authority should use the space to handle and
store containers and other dry cargo amid a shortage of space at
the facility, the Dar es Salaam-based newspaper cited Kikwete as
saying.  In 2009, Dar es Salaam Port handled 6.6 million metric tons
of cargo, according to information from the countryâ€™s National
Bureau of Statistics.  To contact the reporter on this story:
