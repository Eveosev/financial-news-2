U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne ’s plans to erase the bulk of the  budget deficit 
by 2015 will reduce economic growth by 0.5 percent a year, the
National Institute of Economic and Social Research said.  Smaller spending cuts and more tax increases would provide
greater support for the economy, the London-based research group
said today. Delaying the squeeze would “boost employment and
output,” it said.  “Fiscal consolidation could be delayed and the markets
won’t panic,” Ray Barrell, a senior research fellow at Niesr,
said at a briefing to discuss the backdrop to Osborne’s March 23
budget. “The chancellor should rebalance the consolidation with
higher taxes and more spending.”  The institute said it expects the economy to remain
“weak,” with output expanding 0.2 percent in the current
quarter and 1.5 percent this year, “well below” potential.
Household disposable income will be lower than in 2008 and
unemployment will peak at 2.6 million this year, it said.  Osborne has embarked on the biggest fiscal tightening since
World War II, with plans to slash more than 300,000 public-
sector jobs over the next four years.  Yesterday, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development trimmed its U.K. growth forecast for 2011 to 1.5
percent, fueling expectations that Osborne will announce a
downgrade of the Treasury’s 2.1 percent prediction next week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
