Bahrain Petroleum Co., operator of
the kingdom’s only refinery, is proceeding with planned
maintenance amid a military curfew and police crackdown on anti-
government protests in the Persian Gulf island nation.  The state-owned refinery has shut down a hydrocracker as
part of scheduled work, while other operations were continuing,
a company official said today, asking not to be identified by
name because of a company policy barring unauthorized interviews
with media. Maintenance workers and others were manning the
facility, and no officials have declared force majeure on
refinery exports, the official said.  The company, known as Bapco, started the partial shutdown
last month. Maintenance was scheduled from Feb. 16 until early
April, according to a company statement in January. Bapco can
shorten the servicing schedule and delay work that hasn’t been
started, a Bapco official said last month.  The refiner plans to perform work on its low-sulfur diesel
plant, according to the January statement. The equipment to be
shut down includes a hydrocracker, a hydrogen plant, a sulfur-
recovery unit and flare, and units for crude, gas recovery and
vacuum distillation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
