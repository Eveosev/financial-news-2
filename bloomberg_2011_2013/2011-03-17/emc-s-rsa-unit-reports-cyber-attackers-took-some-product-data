EMC Corp.’s RSA unit said it was
hit by a cyber attack that resulted in some information being
taken from its systems, including data related to RSA’s SecurID
authentication products.  The matter isn’t expected to have a material impact on
financial results, EMC said in a filing today. The company is
investigating the attack and working with authorities, RSA
Executive Chairman Art Coviello said in an open letter to
customers.  The information taken related to RSA’s two-factor
authentication products, which combine things like personal-
identification numbers and tokens with biometric data such as
fingerprints. The data could be used to reduce the effectiveness
of the products, RSA said. The company said it is communicating
with customers and telling them how to protect themselves.  EMC, based in Hopkinton,  Massachusetts , said it has no
evidence that any customers have been affected.  EMC rose 25 cents to $25.56 at 4 p.m. on the New York Stock
Exchange. The shares have gained 12 percent this year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
