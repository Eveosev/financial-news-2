Niger won’t be deterred from
nuclear power by the crisis in  Japan , according to a report in
Le Sahel today, citing the nation’s energy and mines minister.  Djibo Salamatou Gourouza Magagi was cited by the government
newspaper as saying that nuclear generation can provide low-cost
electricity and help speed up the country’s development.  In Niger, only 8 percent of households have access to
electricity, while the ratio is below 1 percent in rural areas,
the minister was quoted as saying at a seminar organized by the  International Atomic Energy Agency  yesterday.  Niger is the sixth-biggest producer of uranium.  To contact the reporter on this story:
