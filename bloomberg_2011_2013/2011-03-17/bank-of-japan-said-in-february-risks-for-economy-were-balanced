  Bank of Japan  board members said
last month that risks for the economy were largely balanced,
according to minutes of a Feb. 14-15 released in Tokyo today.  The central bank this week stepped up short-term liquidity
and expanded its asset-purchase program to contain investor
panic after an earthquake and deepening nuclear crisis caused
stocks to plunge and the yen to surge.  To contact the reporter on this story:
