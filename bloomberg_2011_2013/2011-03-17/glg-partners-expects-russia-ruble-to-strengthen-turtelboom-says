GLG Partners LP is betting on gains
in  Russia ’s ruble and said it is “one of the biggest trades we
have on,” Bart Turtelboom, co-head of emerging markets, said at
the Bloomberg Link Hedge Fund Conference in  London  today.  Russia is Turtelboom’s “favorite” emerging market because
it will see a number of initial public offerings and has
abundant natural resources, he said earlier today.  To contact the reporter on this story:  Chris Kay  in London at   ckay5@bloomberg.net .  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
