U.S. regulators have paid out
almost $9 billion to cover loans and other losses at failed
financial institutions sold to stronger companies, the Wall
Street Journal reported, citing data from the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp.  The costs are down to loss-sharing deals struck by the FDIC
which protect buyers from most of the risk linked to loans at
failed banks; by Jan. 31 the FDIC has paid out $8.89 billion
during the financial crisis, and officials estimate $21.5
billion more will be paid between 2011 and 2014, the newspaper
said.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:  Chris Peterson  at
