  Poland ’s energy regulator won’t
allow  Polskie Gornictwo Naftowe i Gazownictwo SA (PGN) , known as
PGNiG, to raise natural-gas prices from April 1, said Agnieszka Glosniewska, the watchdog’s spokeswoman.  The  regulator  had until today to decide on higher prices
from the start of next month.  “The procedure won’t be completed today as PGNiG asked for
a bigger price increase,” Glosniewska said today in a telephone
interview from Warsaw.  In an updated request sent to the energy watchdog, Poland’s
dominant gas company asked for higher gas prices, Marek Woszczyk, the head of the regulator, said yesterday. On Feb. 23,
Woszczyk said PGNiG wanted an increase of less than 10 percent
in the initial request.  PGNiG imports about two-thirds of its gas from  Russia ,
buying the fuel at a price set in dollars based on a nine-month
average of oil-related products, and selling it at a rate set in
zloty by the regulator.  To contact the reporter on this story:
