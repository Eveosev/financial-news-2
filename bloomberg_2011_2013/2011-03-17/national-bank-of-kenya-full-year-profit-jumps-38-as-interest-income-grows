  National Bank of Kenya Ltd. (NBKL) , a
state-run lender, fell the most in a week on the  Nairobi Stock
Exchange  after it reported a 38 percent increase in full-year
that didn’t meet investor expectations.  The stock dropped as much as 2.75 shillings, or 6.3
percent, to 41 shillings, where it was trading at 10:54 a.m. in
Nairobi, the capital. A close at that level would be the lowest
since Jan. 12, according to Bloomberg data.  National Bank earlier reported net income climbed to 2.02
billion shillings ($23.5 million) in the 12 months through
December, from 1.46 billion shillings a year ago. Net interest
income, the money banks make from interest charges on loans,
advanced 31 percent to 4.37 billion shillings, Chief Executive
Officer Reuben Marambii told reporters at a briefing.  “The results were below our expectations,” Renaldo D’souza,
an analyst at Nairobi-based Genghis Capital Ltd., said in a
phone interview today.  NBK, as the lender is known, will pay a dividend for the
first time since 1998, Marambii said. Preference shareholders
will receive 75 cents a share, while ordinary stockholders will
get 60 cents, Marambii said.  “A dividend of 60 cents per share is better than nothing,”
D’souza said. “Giving half of profits to shareholders is
reasonable, although the dividend yield is low.”  In the 12 months to December 2010, retained earnings, or
profit which isn’t paid out as a dividend and are invested back
in the company, improved to 2 billion shillings from 53.6
million shillings a year earlier.  NBK, which opened five outlets last year, plans to add 20
more branches this year, Marambii said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
