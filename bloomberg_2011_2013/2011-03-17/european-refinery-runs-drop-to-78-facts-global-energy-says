European refineries in developed
nations are running at 78 percent capacity this month, down from
80 percent in February, according to estimates from Singapore-
based researcher Facts Global Energy Inc.  European plants in members of the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development are processing about 12.7 million
barrels of crude a day, versus 12.9 million barrels a day in
February and 13.2 million barrels a day in January, Facts said.  “The reduction is mostly from maintenance and also some
run cuts,” Roy Jordan, a London-based analyst at Facts, said by
telephone today. The continent’s refiners typically carry out
work during spring and fall, when seasonal demand is lower.  “It’s been the middle distillates that have been keeping
refiners afloat” amid poor economics for processing other
fuels, Jordan said, referring to a category of products that
includes diesel, heating oil and jet fuel.  Gasoil’s crack spread, or premium to Brent, fell 7.3
percent to $16.42 a barrel at 2:32 p.m. on  London ’s ICE Futures
Europe exchange today. The crack, a measure of refining profit,
rose about 21 percent in the past month, according to ICE data.  The European naphtha crack, which is at a discount to
Brent, widened to $8.25 a barrel, according to data from London-
based brokerage PVM Oil Associates Ltd. The gap expanded to a
two-year low at $8.32 a barrel on March 15. Gasoline cracks
shrank for the fourth day to $4.01 a barrel more than Brent, PVM
data show. That’s the lowest in three weeks.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
