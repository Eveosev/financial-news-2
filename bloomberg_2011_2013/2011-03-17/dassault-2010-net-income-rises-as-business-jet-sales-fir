  Dassault Aviation SA (AM) , the maker of
fighter planes and the Falcon business jets, said net income
rose 25 percent last year as the corporate aircraft market began
to emerge from a three-year slump.  Net income rose to 395 million euros ($552.8 million), from
of 315 million euros a year earlier, the Paris-based company
said in a statement today. Dassault delivered a record 95
Falcons in 2010, from 77 in 2009, helping push up revenue by 22
percent to 4.19 billion euros, it said.  Dassault ended 2010 with nine fewer business-jets orders
than at the end of 2009, as more customers canceled orders than
placing them. The tally was worse in 2009, when the year-end
order intake was a negative 98, after cancellations from
customers including NetJets Inc., a unit of Warren Buffett’s  Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A) , which dropped 65 orders.  “Even if the pace of Falcon cancellations linked to the
recession in 2010 has eased compared with 2009, new orders are
slow to pick up,” Dassault said in the release.  Military revenue in  France  fell 2 percent in 2010, the
company said, without providing figures. Last year, 11 Rafale
fighter jets were delivered to the French state, compared with
14 in 2009. The decrease was offset by a gain in net sales
linked to French military support and development programs,
Dassault said.  The company will ask shareholders at its annual meeting to
approve a dividend payment of 10.70 euros a share, compared with
8.8 euros for 2009.  The net income figures exclude the impact of Dassault’s
holdings in  Thales SA (HO) ,  Europe ’s biggest defense electronics
provider. Dassault owns a quarter of the company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
