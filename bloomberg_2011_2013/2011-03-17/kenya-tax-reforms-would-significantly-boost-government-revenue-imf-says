  Kenya , East Africa’s biggest
economy, has the potential to boost tax revenue by 40 billion
shillings ($467 million) by changing its tax system, the  International Monetary Fund  said.  “Substantial revenue can be realized from the real-estate
and the informal sector,” Ragnar Gudmundsson, the IMF’s
resident representative in Kenya, said in an e-mailed statement
today in Nairobi, the capital. “Broadening the income and
corporate-tax brackets could significantly improve Kenya’s tax
collection.”  Kenya collected 560 billion shillings in taxes in the
fiscal year through June 2010. Taxes taken by the country’s
Revenue Authority were 11 percent below the target of 271.1
billion shillings for the five months through November,
according to the Central Bank of Kenya. Finance Minister  Uhuru Kenyatta  is to present a supplementary budget to parliament on
March 22.  The IMF is working with the government on a new VAT law and
on starting a Tax Reform Commission to improve administration,
Gudmundsson said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
