John Lillhoek, a spokesman at the
Swedish Radiation Safety Authority, comments on the outlook and
work being done to contain the crisis at  Japan ’s Fukushima Dai-
Ichi atomic power plant.  “The situation is serious,” he said. “You could play
with both good and bad scenarios at the moment, so it is
impossible to tell how this will pan out, but we believe the
Japanese are doing the right things.”  The authority, which oversees safety at  Sweden ’s nuclear
reactors, issued a statement today advising Swedes not to travel
to Japan and to evacuate an area of 80 kilometers (50 miles)
surrounding the troubled reactor.  To contact the reporter on this story:
