  Alassane Ouattara  won last year’s
presidential election in Ivory Coast, and the West African
nation’s Constitutional Council was wrong to declare incumbent
leader Laurent Gbagbo the victor, South African President Jacob Zuma said.  While Gbagbo complained about voting irregularities in four
northern regions, the commission annulled the results from
seven, Zuma, who’s one of five Africa leaders appointed by the
African Union to mediate in the crisis, said today.  If the commission disqualified the votes that Gbagbo
disputed, “Ouattara would have still have won,” Zuma told
lawmakers in  Cape Town . By annulling votes from three more
regions, the commission abused its authority and changed the
outcome of the Nov. 28 election, he said.  After initially backing Ouattara in January,  South Africa 
declared its neutrality in the electoral dispute on Feb. 17,
saying the election results were inconclusive. The African Union
reaffirmed its support for Ouattara last week, and South Africa
then said it fully supported the stance of the 53-nation group.  To contact the reporter on this story:
