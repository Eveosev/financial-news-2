Indonesia faces the risk
accelerating global food an  oil prices  will speed  core inflation 
in Southeast Asia’s biggest economy, said  Andrew Colquhoun ,
Fitch Ratings head of Asia-Pacific sovereigns.  There may be some risk of inflationary pressures from food
and fuel broadening into the rest of the economy, Colquhoun said
in Jakarta today. Accelerating core inflation could be very
difficult to get back “in its box,” he said.  Consumer-price growth in February slowed to 6.84 percent
from a year earlier, compared with a 7.02 percent pace in
January, a report showed March 1. Core inflation, a measure of
price gains excluding volatile items such as food, gained to
4.36 percent from 4.18 percent.  Bank Indonesia  has said core
inflation may accelerate to about 5 percent this year.  A strengthening rupiah will mitigate any effect on  Indonesia ’s budget deficit this year, Finance Minister Agus Martowardojo told reporters after making opening remarks at the
Fitch presentation today. The deficit won’t rise above 2 percent
of gross domestic product, he said.  Indonesia’s sovereign credit rating may reach investment
grade in the third quarter, Coordinating Minister for the
Economy Hatta Rajasa told reporters in Jakarta today at a
separate event.  To contact the reporter on this story:
