Oil options volatility increased as
the underlying futures contract rose after sustained fighting in  Libya  and unrest in Bahrain threatened to further cut crude
production.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
May, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 40 percent as of 2 p.m. in New York, up
from 39.3 percent yesterday.  Crude oil for April delivery rose $3.44 to settle at
$101.42 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . The
contract is up 22 percent from a year ago. The May contract rose
the same amount, to $102.39.  May $130 calls were the most active options in electronic
trading today among those not expiring, with 1,922 lots changing
hands. They rose 14 cents to 37 cents a barrel. May $95 puts,
the next most active contract, lost $1.14 to $1.58 a barrel with
1,509 contracts trading. One contract covers 1,000 barrels of
oil. April options expired at the close of floor trading today.  Nymex distributes real-time data for electronic trading and
releases information on floor trading, where the bulk of options
trading occurs, the next business day.  December $75 puts were the most active options traded
yesterday, with 9,000 lots changing hands. They rose 6 cents to
$2.00 a barrel. The next most active option, April $100 calls,
