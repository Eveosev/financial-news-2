All seats on the  Hungarian central
bank ’s rate-setting Monetary Council may be filled next week as
lawmakers are scheduled to vote on two vacancies.  A vote to confirm them is scheduled for March 21, pending
nominations by a committee where the ruling Fidesz party has a
majority, according to the legislature’s agenda e-mailed to
reporters today. The Economy Committee’s secretariat had no
information on when the nominations may take place.  Prime Minister Viktor Orban stripped central bank President
Andras Simor of his right to nominate two of the four outside
members of the seven-member Monetary Council, defying criticism
from the European Commission and the  European Central Bank .
Orban and his allies, who won elections in April, have
criticized the central bank for being too slow to cut and then
quick to raise  interest rates .  The mandate of the four outside members of the Monetary
Council expired on March 1. Parliament on March 7 confirmed
Ferenc Gerhardt and Andrea Bartfai-Mager, both of whom worked
under former central bank President Zsigmond Jarai, as rate
setters. The Economy Committee postponed nominations for the two
other vacancies.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
