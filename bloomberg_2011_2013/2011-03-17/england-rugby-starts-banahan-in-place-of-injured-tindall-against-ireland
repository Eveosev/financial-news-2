Matt Banahan will start for England
in place of the injured  Mike Tindall  in this weekend’s match
against Ireland, the final game in the rugby Six Nations
tournament.  The change at center is the only one made by manager  Martin
Johnson  from the 22-16 victory over Scotland last weekend.
Banahan will play his 11th match for England, which could win
the Grand Slam by defeating Ireland in Dublin. Nick Easter will
be captain in Tindall’s absence.  David Strettle was added to the bench.  England team
