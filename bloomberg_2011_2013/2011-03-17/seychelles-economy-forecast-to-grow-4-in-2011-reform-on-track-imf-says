Seychelles’s economy will probably
expand by 4 percent this year after growing more than 6 percent
in 2010, the  International Monetary Fund  said in a statement on
its website today.  Inflation is estimated to accelerate to about 5.5 percent
from zero last year, the Washington-based institution said. The
country is making good progress in implementing structural
reforms and has almost halved external debt over the past two
years to 48 percent of gross domestic product, it said.  “We also support the authorities’ planned tightening of
the monetary policy stance to contain the risk from excess
liquidity in the banking system and prevent the buildup of
domestic inflationary pressure,” the IMF said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
