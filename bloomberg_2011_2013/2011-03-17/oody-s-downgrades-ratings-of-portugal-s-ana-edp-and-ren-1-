Moody’s Investors Service said it
downgraded utility EDP-Energias de  Portugal  SA, energy grid
manager REN-Redes Energeticas Nacionais SA and airport operator
ANA-Aeroportos de Portugal SA after cutting the Portuguese
government’s debt rating earlier this week.  Lisbon-based EDP’s rating was lowered to Baa1 from A3, with
a stable outlook, Moody’s said today. REN was downgraded to Baa1
from A3, with a negative outlook. The rating of ANA was cut to
A3 from A2, with a stable outlook.  Portugal’s credit rating was cut two steps by Moody’s on
March 15 to A3, four steps from so-called junk status, with the
outlook on the grade “negative.” The rating company cited
Portugal’s “subdued growth prospects” and “implementation
risks for the government’s ambitious fiscal consolidation
targets.”  The  Portuguese government  will report a 2010 budget deficit
equivalent to or less than 7 percent of gross domestic product,
narrower than the 7.3 percent gap previously forecast by the
government, Prime Minister  Jose Socrates  said on Jan. 28. The
government has set a target for a deficit of 4.6 percent in 2011
and aims to reach the European Union limit of 3 percent in 2012.  To contact the reporters on this story:
