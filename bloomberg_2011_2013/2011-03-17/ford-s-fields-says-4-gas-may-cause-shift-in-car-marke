Gasoline that has risen to 2008
prices may cause a shift in consumers’ car-buying patterns, said  Mark Fields ,  Ford Motor Co. (F) ’s president of the Americas.  “There is a natural kind of water level that if a gallon
of gas goes over, that may shift the market mentality,” Fields
said today at a factory in Wayne,  Michigan , where Ford’s
redesigned Focus small car has begun production. “When it
starts getting over $4 a gallon or gets to triple digits when
you fill up your tank, that catches people’s attention.”  U.S. regular unleaded gasoline prices rose 27 percent from
a year earlier to an average $3.55 a gallon yesterday, according
to AAA. U.S. gasoline prices peaked at $4.11 per gallon in July
2008, according to AAA.  The new Focus, which goes on sale this month, and the
Fiesta subcompact that debuted in June are the foundation of
Chief Executive Officer  Alan Mulally ’s bet that U.S. buyers will
pay more for fuel-efficient small cars equipped with amenities
typically found in larger models. The Focus gets 40 miles per
gallon on the highway and starts at about $17,000, with some
versions priced as high as $29,000.  Worldwide sales of the Focus and its global variants are
targeted to reach 2 million by 2012, which will cut costs by
having more than 80 percent of parts in common, the Dearborn,
Michigan-based automaker has said.  “We couldn’t be launching the Focus at a better time,”
Fields said today. “We’re in a much better position to handle
anything the market throws at us.”  Ford Profit  Ford, the only major U.S. automaker to avoid bankruptcy in
2009, earned $6.56 billion in 2010, the most since 1999. New
models such as the Fiesta and redesigned Taurus sedan helped
2010 U.S. sales rise 17 percent, outpacing the industrywide gain
of 11 percent.  Mulally, who came to Ford from Boeing Co. in 2006, has
revived the automaker by emphasizing quality and expanding its
lineup with small cars such as the Focus and Fiesta, which gets
40 mpg on the highway. Ford earned $9.28 billion in the last two
years after $30.1 billion in losses from 2006 through 2008.  As a reward for the turnaround, Ford on March 3 paid
Mulally unrestricted stock worth $56.5 million and gave
Executive Chairman  Bill Ford  unrestricted shares valued at $42.4
million. Ford withheld some of the stock awards to cover their
income taxes. After taxes, Mulally received $33.4 million and
Bill Ford got $25.1 million.  Fields received stock awards valued at $4.66 million on
March 3 and March 5 under the company’s long-term incentive
plan. After Ford withheld some shares to cover income taxes,
Fields received $2.76 million.  Ford rose 8 cents to $14.26 at 4:15 p.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading. The shares have dropped 15 percent
this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
