Two U.S. drone strikes killed at
least 30 people in  Pakistan ’s North Waziristan tribal area,
state-run  Pakistan  Television News reported today, citing people
it didn’t identify.  Two unmanned spy planes fired four missiles on a militant
training camp, PTV reported. The attack targeted a meeting of
tribal elders and killed 40 people, Aaj Television reported
earlier.  “Such acts of violence take us away from our objective of
elimination of terrorism,” said General Ashfaq Parvez Kayani,
the Pakistan army chief of staff, who said the missiles struck
“peaceful citizens including elders of the area.”  U.S. State Department spokesman Mark Toner declined to
comment. “We don’t discuss drones,” he told reporters in  Washington .  Pakistan is a main U.S. ally in the fight against al-Qaeda-
linked militants and the Obama administration is pressing it to
cooperate more fully in the war against the militant Islamic
Taliban in neighboring  Afghanistan .  President Asif Ali Zardari’s cooperation with Obama hasn’t
been popular with Pakistanis, particularly his tolerance of U.S.
drone missile attacks on tribal areas on the Pakistani side of
the border.  To contact the reporter on this story:
