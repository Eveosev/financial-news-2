The Obama administration froze the
assets of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and six other
officials in an effort to pressure the government to end its
crackdown on protesters.  Property in the U.S. or interests in property belonging to
al-Assad and the officials will be frozen, the Treasury
Department said in a statement today. The other officials
include Syrian Vice President Faruq al-Shara, Prime Minister
Adel Safar, Interior Minister Mohamad Ibrahim al-Shaar and
Defense Minister Ali Habib Mahmoud.  The European Union will impose more sanctions on  Syria  next
week, an Obama administration official said in a conference call
with reporters. The conference call was given on condition the
official not be identified.  “The  United States  continues to strongly condemn the
Syrian government’s use of violence and intimidation against its
people and urges President al-Assad and his regime to answer the
calls of the Syrian people for a more representative government
and embark upon the path of meaningful democratic reform,” the
Treasury said in its statement.  U.S. citizens are “generally prohibited from engaging in
transactions” with the officials, according to the statement.  Syria today intensified a crackdown on anti-government
protesters with a coordinated attack on several suburbs of the
capital, Damascus, and on a city in the southern governorate of
Daraa, where the unrest began two months ago.  To contact the reporters on this story:
