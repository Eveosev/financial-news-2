New York state paid 996 employees
more last year than Governor  Andrew Cuomo ’s base salary of
$179,000, according to a compilation of payroll  data  by the
Empire Center for New York State Policy in  Albany .  Most of those who earned more than the governor work in the
83 campuses and three hospitals of the state and city university
systems, which aren’t under the governor’s direct control. The
employment  information  collected by  Empire , a group that
advocates less  government spending , doesn’t include the cost of
pensions or other benefits.  Cuomo, a Democrat who announced a voluntary 5 percent pay
cut for himself and top staff soon after he took office this
year, is seeking $450 million of labor savings from about
130,000 workers he does oversee to help close a $10 billion
budget gap. Union contracts expire March 31, and Cuomo’s budget
calls for 9,800 dismissals if there is no cost-cutting deal.  With pay averaging $100,552, the  New York  State Police had
the highest average earnings among executive-branch agencies,
the  report  said.  The highest paid worker outside of the state or city
university systems, at number 127, was Raudline Etienne, chief
investment officer of New York’s $140.6 billion pension  fund .
Etienne, who was paid $285,063, was previously a managing
director at RogersCasey, a Darien, Connecticut-based adviser to
pension and retirement plans.  Million-Dollar Coach  The highest pay, $1.03 million, went to Kevin Broadus,
former men’s basketball coach at the  State University of New
York  at Binghamton, after he and the school agreed to end his
contract. An investigation led by former New York Chief Judge
Judith Kaye found the school’s athletic and other departments
were  giving  preferential treatment to athletes.  The number of state workers paid more than $175,000 rose by
96, or about 10 percent, from 2009, even though Governor  David Paterson  had a declared a hiring freeze and announced layoffs of
900 workers before his term ended Dec. 31.  Cuomo’s $132.5 billion  budget  calls for $206.4 million of
cuts in state aid to higher education and $134.8 million to the
state university hospitals. He wants lawmakers to approve a
$175,000 ceiling on pay for superintendents at the state’s 700
school districts. The salaries are now set by locally elected
school boards.  To contact the reporter on this story:
