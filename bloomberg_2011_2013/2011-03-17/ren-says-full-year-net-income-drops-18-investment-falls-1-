REN-Redes Energeticas Nacionais SA,
the operator of  Portugal â€™s electricity and gas networks, said
full-year profit fell 18 percent after earnings in 2009 were
helped by a canceled provision.  Net income dropped to 110.3 million euros ($155 million)
from 134 million euros a year earlier, the Lisbon-based company
said today in a regulatory filing. In 2009, profit was helped by
the cancelation of a 22.8 million-euro provision, REN said.
Investment fell 5 percent to 443 million euros.  REN plans to invest 3.2 billion euros through 2016 on new
lines and substations, as well as on natural gas storage
facilities and pipelines. The grid operator has to extend links
to wind parks and other plants as companies try to increase
generation capacity with units that emit less carbon dioxide
than coal plants.  Of the planned total investment, 2.3 billion euros will be
spent on electricity assets and 900 million euros on natural gas
infrastructure. The company estimates its regulated asset base
will increase at an average annual rate of 7 percent from 2009
through 2016, while net debt will increase to 3.3 billion euros
in 2016 from 2.14 billion euros in 2009. Debt fell to 2.1
billion euros at the end of 2010.  REN in November said it forecasts 9 percent average annual
growth through 2016 in earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization. It company forecasts recurrent
net income will increase at the same pace. Full-year ebitda rose
12 percent to 431 million euros in 2010, REN said today.  Spain and Portugal aim to increase power interconnection
capacity to 3,000 megawatts by 2013 as part of a plan to develop
an Iberian  electricity market . Besides adding electricity links,
REN is expanding its liquefied natural gas terminal in Sines and
gas-storage facilities.  REN shares fell 0.4 percent to close at 2.47 euros in
Lisbon today before the earnings announcement. The stock has
declined 4.3 percent this year for a market value of 1.32
billion euros.  Portugal controls 51 percent of REN through stakes owned by
a government holding company and by state-owned savings bank
Caixa Geral de Depositos SA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
