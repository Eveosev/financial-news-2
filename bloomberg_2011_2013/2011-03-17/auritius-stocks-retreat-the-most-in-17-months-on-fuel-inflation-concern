Mauritius’s stocks gauge fell the
most in almost 17 months, led by  State Bank of Mauritius Ltd. (SBM) ,
as  oil prices  advanced for a second day, stoking concern that
inflation will erode profit.  The 37-member SEMDEX Index retreated 1.6 percent to
1,946.92 by 1:30 p.m. close in Port Louis, the biggest drop
since September 2009.  State Bank , the second-largest lender by
market value, slumped 3.8 percent to 88.5 rupees, the lowest
since December 2009.  Crude for April delivery surged as much as 1.9 percent to
$99.86 a barrel as concern that political unrest may cut Middle
Eastern exports countered estimates that the earthquake in  Japan 
will curtail fuel demand. Mauritius gasoline prices climbed 5.8
percent in the 10 weeks through March 14, while retail prices
advanced 9 percent in the period, State Trading Corp. said. The
country’s inflation rate rose to 6.8 percent in February, the
highest since November 2008, adding to pressure on the central
bank to raise interest rates.  “There’s an element of panic-selling by some local
investors who are concerned by increase in fuel prices that will
affect profit margins,” Imrith Ramtohul, a senior investment
manager at Mauritius Union Assurance Ltd. who helps oversee 6
billion rupees ($208.7 million) in assets, said in a phone
interview today. “There’s speculation of a probable increase in
the repo rate that will further affect profitability and
indirectly the economy.”  The central bank will probably raise its benchmark interest
rate, currently at 4.75 percent, when it announces its next
decision on March 28, with 22 of 30 analysts in a PluriConseil-
l’Express survey expecting an increase, l’Express, a Port Louis-
based newspaper, reported yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
