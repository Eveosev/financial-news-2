International communities must show
solidarity with those rebelling against autocratic rule in the
Middle East and North Africa because the tide is turning against
the Arab Spring, said  Nawal El Saadawi , an Egyptian political
activist of more than four decades, in a conference call today
organized by the Women’s Media Center.  On difficulties in  Egypt :  “The Hosni Mubarak men and the military are trying to
abort the revolution. Since Jan. 25, there are gangs, who are
attacking the revolutionary people.”  Young men and women who visited me in my home “are angry
with the military council, who established a council to revise
the constitution with no women and no young men.”  These young men and women “are secular, they are for  women’s rights , they are for a radical change of the
constitution, item two that says Egypt is an Islamic state. The
military doesn’t want that, the external powers don’t want
that.”  “The counter-revolution is great. But I am still
optimistic and I am still hopeful because I lived with the young
women and men who initiated the revolution and who slept in
Tahrir Square in the cold, night after night and persisted until
Mubarak resigned.”  “It is a struggle and it is ongoing” and “the young
people who carried out this revolution aren’t naïve.”  On aid:  “American aid to Egypt is disastrous. America should cut
it. It doesn’t go to the poor classes; it goes to the ruling
class. America should not give aid to any country. We need
equality not aid.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
