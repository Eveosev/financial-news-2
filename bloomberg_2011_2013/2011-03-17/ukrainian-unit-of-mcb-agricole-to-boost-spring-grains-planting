Ukrzernoprom Agro , a Ukrainian
agricultural company owned by Vienna-based MCB Agricole Holding
AG, plans to increase its spring grains sowing by 20 percent.  Kiev-based Ukrzernoprom, which operates in 12 Ukrainian
regions, will plant more than 30,000 hectares (74,100 acres)
with spring grains and oilseeds, compared with about 25,000
hectares last year, the company said today in a  statement  on its
website.  The companyâ€™s total grains and oilseeds planting for the
2011 harvest, including spring and winter crops, will reach
85,000 hectares, according to the statement.  Ukrzernoprom will increase the area under corn to 6,175
hectares from 3,743 hectares last year, according to the
