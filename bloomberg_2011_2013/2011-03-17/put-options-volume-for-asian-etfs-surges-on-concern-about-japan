Put trading for an exchange-traded
fund tracking Japanese shares surged to a record yesterday after
equities in the nation jumped, while U.S. volume for bearish
contracts on nations elsewhere in  Asia  also increased as the
nuclear crisis north of  Tokyo  intensified.  More than 383,300 puts to sell the  iShares MSCI Japan Index
Fund (EWJ)  changed hands in the U.S. yesterday. The ETF fell 3.7
percent to $9.66, the lowest price since September. Yesterday’s
put volume was 11 times the four-week average. Trading of
bearish options on ETFs tracking South Korean and Chinese stocks
rose to the highest levels in at least nine months.    Japan ’s  Nikkei 225  Stock Average rallied 5.7 percent
yesterday after plunging 16 percent since March 11 in the worst
two-day drop since 1987. The MSCI All-Country Asia ex-Japan
Index fell 3.7 percent this week, while the Shanghai Composite
Index, which tracks the bigger of  China ’s stock exchanges,
dropped 2.4 percent and Korea’s  Kospi Index (KOSPI)  declined 2.2
percent. The tsunami that followed Japan’s worst earthquake on
record damaged the Fukushima nuclear power plant, spurring
concern of increased risk of radiation.  “These investors appear to be concerned with downside in
shares alongside the ongoing nuclear radiation problem in
Japan,” options strategists at Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP
wrote in a report yesterday, referring to put buyers.  The Nikkei 225 fell 3.7 percent to 8,757.67 at 9:27 a.m.
Tokyo time today.  Nuclear Reactors  U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission Chairman Gregory Jaczko
told a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee that all cooling
water at one of the reactors has drained from the spent-fuel
pool and “radiation levels are extremely high, which could
possibly impact the ability to take corrective measures.” The  Associated Press  said Japanese officials denied all the water
has drained and said the reactor, known as Unit 4, is stable.  Trading of bearish  iShares MSCI South Korea Index Fund (EWY) 
options surged for a second day to a 10-month high, with most of
the trading concentrated in contracts with a strike price 2.8
percent below yesterday’s close. An investor bought a block of
March $55 puts for 16 cents each, according to the Susquehanna
report and data compiled by Bloomberg. The contracts expire at
the end of the week. More than 39,000 puts traded yesterday, 8.5
times the four-week average and 55 times the number of calls.
The ETF fell 1.9 percent to $56.61 yesterday.  Put volume for the  iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund (FXI)  rose to
its highest level since June. More than 135,500 puts traded,
three times the four-week average and 2.5 times the number of
calls to buy. The biggest trade was a block of 15,079 April $40
puts for 69 cents each, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The ETF
dropped 2.5 percent to $41.75. The April $40 puts were the most-
traded contracts and accounted for more than one-third of all
put trades.  Calls give the right to buy 100 shares of a security for a
certain amount, the strike price, by a set date. Puts convey the
right to sell. Investors use options to guard against
fluctuations in the price of securities they own, speculate on
share-price moves or bet that volatility, or stock swings, will
rise or fall.  To contact the reporter on this story:
