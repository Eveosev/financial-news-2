  Spain  sold 4.1 billion euros ($5.8
billion) of 10-year and 30-year bonds as borrowing costs eased
and demand increased.  Spain sold 3.22 billion euros of 10-year bonds at an
average yield of 5.162 percent, compared with 5.2 percent on
Feb. 17, the last time similar-maturity securities were sold,
and in the market before the sale. It sold 911 million euros of
30-year debt at 5.875 percent, down from 5.957 percent at an
auction last month, the Madrid-based Treasury said.  Demand for the 10-year benchmark was 1.81 times the amount
sold, compared with 1.54 times last month. The Treasury aimed to
sell a maximum of 4.5 billion euros in total.  The sale was the first bond auction in the so-called
periphery nations since European leaders agreed on March 12 to
boost the effective capacity of its rescue fund to the full 440
billion euros, while tightening enforcement of debt and deficit
limits. Spain’s 10-year bonds rallied yesterday to their highest
in more than a month, widening the gap in yields with  Portugal .  “It’s a fairly decent auction, given the market didn’t
give much of a concession before the sale,” said  Peter Schaffrik , head of European fixed-income strategy at  RBC Capital
Markets  in  London . “We are quite positive on tier-two countries
which include Spain after the European summit. The fact that it
didn’t go wrong is good.”  The gap between Spanish and German 10-year borrowing costs
narrowed to 207 basis points after the sale, from 209 basis
points at 10 a.m. in Madrid, and 208 basis points yesterday.
That compares with a euro-era high of 298 basis points on Nov.
30 after Ireland sought a European bailout, and an average of 15
basis points in the first decade of monetary union.  To contact the reporter on this story:
