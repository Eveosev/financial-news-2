Foreign grants to help Jordan
finance  government spending  increased 26 percent last year, the
government said.  Jordan received 418.8 million dinars ($590.6 million) in
2010, up from 333.4 million dinars in 2009, the  Ministry of
Finance  in Amman said in a  statement  on its website.  The kingdom’s budget deficit narrowed 31 percent to 1.05
billion dinars last year after receipt of the grants and a
reduction in government spending. Jordan, which imports more
than 90 percent of its oil, relies on foreign investment and
grants to finance gaps in the budget and the current account.  The projected budget shortfall for the year after grants
was 1 billion dinars, or 5.3 percent of gross domestic product.
The 2009  budget deficit  more than doubled to 1.44 billion dinars
from 692.7 million dinars the previous year.  Foreign debt  climbed 19 percent to 4.6 billion dinars last
year, the  ministry  said.  Domestic debt  increased 18 percent to
6.85 billion dinars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
