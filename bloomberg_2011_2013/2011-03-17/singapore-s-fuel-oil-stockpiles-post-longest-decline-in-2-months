  Singapore ’s stockpiles of residues,
or  fuel oil , declined for a third week, data from a unit of the
Ministry of Trade and Industry showed.  Onshore inventories of residues, including fuel oil and
low-sulfur waxy residue and excluding bitumen, fell 2.3 percent
to 18.5 million barrels in the seven days to March 16, the
longest losing streak since the three weeks to Jan. 6,
 International Enterprise Singapore  said in an e-mailed statement
today.  Stockpiles of middle distillates, including gasoil and
kerosene, rose 0.8 percent to 14.4 million barrels. Light
distillates such as naphtha, reformate and gasoline rose 20
percent to 12.3 million barrels, the biggest gain since Sept. 29.  The trade ministry surveys refiners,  oil companies  and
storage terminals on a voluntary basis. The results may exclude
some offshore storage capacity, International Enterprise said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
