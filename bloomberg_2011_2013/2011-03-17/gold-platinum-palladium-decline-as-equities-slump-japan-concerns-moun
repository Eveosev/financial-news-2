Gold rose for a second day in  New
York  as unrest in northern Africa and the Middle East spurred
demand for an investment haven.  Libyan leader  Muammar Qaddafi ’s warplanes dropped bombs
around Benghazi, bringing the war to the opposition stronghold
for the first time as the United Nations Security Council
debates action to protect civilians. Bahrain arrested six
opposition leaders as unrest continued to spread, after protests
during the past month led to the ouster of regimes in Tunisia
and Egypt. Gold rose to a record $1,445.70 an ounce on March 7.  “You have the bargain hunters coming in as the Middle East
is going up in flames,” said  Frank McGhee , the head dealer at
Integrated Brokerage Services LLC in  Chicago .  Gold futures for April delivery rose $8.10, or 0.6 percent,
to settle at $1,404.20 at 1:45 p.m. on the Comex in New York.  The metal touched $1,380.70 on March 15, the lowest since
Feb. 17. Last week’s earthquake and tsunami in  Japan  killed
thousands and sparked a nuclear-plant crisis, prompting
investors to sell assets on concern that global economic growth
would slow.  “Gold is still very susceptible to waves of asset
liquidation as Japan repatriates assets,” McGhee said.  Silver futures for May delivery fell 21.4 cents, or 0.6
percent, to close at $34.258 an ounce on the Comex, the third
decline this week.  Palladium futures for June delivery advanced $11.75, or 1.7
percent, to $716.80 an ounce on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . Earlier, the price touched $687, the lowest since Nov.
30. Platinum futures for April delivery gained $6.40, or 0.4
percent, to $1,706.90 an ounce, after earlier dropping to
$1,658, the lowest since Nov. 30.  Platinum and palladium, used to make pollution-control
devices in automobiles, are headed for a weekly loss as Japan’s
automakers including Toyota Motor Corp. and Honda Motor Co. have
suspended some operations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
