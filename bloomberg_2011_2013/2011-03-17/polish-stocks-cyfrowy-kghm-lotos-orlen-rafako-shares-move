Poland’s WIG20 Index climbed for
the first time in three days, increasing 43.35, or 1.6 percent,
to 2,757.54 at the 5:30 p.m. close in Warsaw.  The following were among the most active stocks on the  Warsaw Stock Exchange  today. Stock symbols follow company names.    Cyfrowy Polsat SA (CPS)  , Poland’s largest satellite
television broadcaster, fell for a second day, retreating 0.33
zloty, or 2.1 percent, to 15.07 zloty. Fourth-quarter net income
fell to 36.9 million zloty ($12.6 million) from 41.4 million
zloty a year earlier, missing the 40.8 million-zloty mean
estimate of eight analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.    KGHM Polska Miedz SA (KGH)  , the copper producer with the
biggest European mine output, advanced for a second day, adding
5.7 zloty, or 3.4 percent, to 175.8 zloty. Copper rose on
speculation that demand may increase as  Japan  rebuilds after
last week’s earthquake and tsunami.  PKN Orlen SA (PKN PW), Poland’s biggest oil company, gained
for the first time this week, adding 1.76 zloty, or 3.5 percent,
to 51.5 zloty.  Grupa Lotos SA (LTS)  , the second-largest
refiner, climbed 0.94 zloty, or 2.3 percent, to 41.96 zloty. Oil
rose on concern that unrest in North Africa and the Middle East
will spread, reducing shipments from the region.    Rafako SA (RFK)   declined 0.11 zloty, or 1 percent, to
10.89 zloty, the lowest close in more than a year as Poland
canceled talks to sell its stake in utility ZE PAK SA to the
power engineering company.  To contact the reporters on this story:
