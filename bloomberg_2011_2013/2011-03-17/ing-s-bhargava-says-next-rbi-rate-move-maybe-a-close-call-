Deepali Bhargava, an economist at
the Indian unit of ING Groep NV in Mumbai, comments on  India ’s
interest rates and inflation.  The  Reserve Bank  of India today raised the repurchase rate
and reverse repurchase rate by a quarter percentage point each
to 6.75 percent and 5.75 percent.  “The central bank is sounding more worried on inflation as
it doesn’t give an indication as to when it will consistently
begin to moderate. Our base case is the central bank will raise
rates by 50 basis points in the rest of 2011.  ‘‘At the same time the tone of policy sounds off risks to
economic growth. So the timing and extent of the next rate
increase is going to be a very close call.  ‘‘Crude oil is going be a concern for a prolonged period so
one should not expect any dramatic movement in the inflation
pattern.  ‘‘Global developments are adding to the uncertainty though
I don’t think the Japan situation will have a significant impact
besides on trade.’’  To contact the reporter on this story:
