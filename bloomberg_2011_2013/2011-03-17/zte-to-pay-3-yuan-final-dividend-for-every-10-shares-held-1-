  ZTE Corp. (000063) , China’s second-biggest
maker of phone-equipment, said it plans to pay a final dividend
comprising of 3 yuan for every 10 shares, and the bonus issue of
two for every 10 existing shares.  The company’s full-year profit rose 32 percent to 3.25
billion yuan ($494 million), or 1.15 yuan a share, it said in a
statement to the  Hong Kong  stock exchange today, citing the
financial standards adopted in the city. The earnings were in
line with preliminary figures posted by the company in January.  Separately, ZTE plans to invest 16 billion yuan in a
research and development base in the eastern Chinese city of
Nanjing, with construction expected to take 10 years, according
to a separate stock exchange filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:  Mark Lee  in Hong Kong at
