  Kerry Properties Ltd. (683) , a Hong Kong-
based builder controlled by the family of Malaysian billionaire  Robert Kuok , said underlying profit for 2010 rose 59 percent
after it sold more apartments in Hong Kong.  Earnings excluding gains from property revaluation and
deferred taxes rose to HK$3.41 billion ($437 million) from
HK$2.14 billion a year earlier, Kerry said in a filing to Hong
Kong’s stock exchange today. That compares with the HK$3.2
billion average estimate of 13 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.
Sales rose to HK$21.2 billion from HK$12.9 billion.  An economic recovery in Hong Kong, near record-low  mortgage
rates , and an influx of buyers from  China  boosted real estate
values in the city by more than 65 percent since early 2009.
Kerry booked profits from apartment sales in projects including
the Island Crest and Primrose Hill in  Hong Kong  and Parkside
Residence in the eastern Chinese city of Hangzhou.  “Hong Kong remains one of the most attractive markets for
property investment,” Kerry’s Chairman Kuok Khoon Chen said in
today’s statement.  Kerry in August paid HK$1.29 billion in a government land
auction for a 77,469-square-foot plot in Hong Kong’s Kowloon
Tong district. The per-square-foot price of HK$16,587 was a
record for the Kowloon Peninsula.  Hong Kong’s government has imposed additional property
transaction taxes, raised down-payment ratios and said it will
increase land supply to curb surging home prices.  Kerry shares fell 1.4 percent to HK$37.55 at the 4 p.m.
close in Hong Kong, after earnings were announced, bringing its
decline this year to 7.3 percent. That compares with the 8.3
percent drop in the Hang Seng Property Index, which tracks Hong
Kong’s seven biggest developers and doesn’t include Kerry.  Kerry will pay a final dividend of 52 Hong Kong cents,
compared with 40 Hong Kong cents a year earlier.  To contact the reporters on this story:
