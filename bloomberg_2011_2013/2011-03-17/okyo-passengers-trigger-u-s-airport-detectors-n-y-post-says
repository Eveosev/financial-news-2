Radiation detectors at Dallas-Fort
Worth and Chicago O’Hare airports were triggered when passengers
from flights that started in Tokyo passed through customs, the
New York Post reported.  Tests at Dallas-Fort Worth indicated low radiation levels
in travelers’ luggage and in the aircraft’s cabin filtration
system; no passengers were quarantined, the newspaper said.  Details of the incident at O’Hare weren’t immediately
clear, the Post said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
