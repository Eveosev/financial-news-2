Equatorial Guinea’s Ceiba crudes will be unchanged at four
cargoes each in May, according to loading programs obtained by
Bloomberg News.  Doba shipments are 950,000 barrels each and Ceiba cargoes
are 1 million barrels each.    Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  is the operator for the Doba field. Doba

fuels such as gasoline and diesel and has low sulfur content.
Ceiba crude is medium sweet. The field is operated by  Hess Corp. (HES)   To contact the reporter on this story:
