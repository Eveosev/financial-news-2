Canadian wholesale sales rose a
sixth straight month in January, increasing at more than twice
the pace forecast by economists, on a surge in car shipments, a
government report showed.  Wholesale sales increased 1.5 percent to C$46.7 billion
($47.2 billion),  Statistics Canada  said today in Ottawa,
compared with the 0.6 percent gain that was the median estimate
in a Bloomberg survey with 11 responses. In volume terms, sales
increased 1.6 percent, the agency said.  The report adds to evidence the country’s recovery
sustained its momentum into the first quarter, after the economy
expanded at an annualized pace of 3.3 percent pace in the final
three months of last year, the fastest among Group of Seven
nations. The statistics agency yesterday reported that factory
sales rose 4.5 percent in January, the most since July 2009.  Motor vehicle and parts sales rose 4.9 percent to C$7.93
billion in January, the highest level since June 2007. Building
material wholesalers advanced 2.6 percent. Overall gains were
pared by a 2 percent drop in sales of machinery and equipment
wholesalers, Statistics Canada said.  Excluding motor vehicles and parts, wholesale sales rose
0.9 percent in the month to C$38.8 billion.  Inventories increased 1.8 percent to C$53.7 billion. The
inventory-to-sales ratio, a measure of how many months it would
take to deplete stocks at the current sales pace, remained 1.15.  The agency today also revised its estimate of December’s
wholesale sales rise to 0.9 percent after an earlier estimate of
a 0.8 percent advance.  To contact the reporter on this story:
