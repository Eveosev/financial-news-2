Swiss industrial production
increased in the fourth quarter as surging export demand
prompted companies to step up spending.  Output increased 7.4 percent from the previous three
months, when it rose 1.4 percent, the Neuchatel-based  Federal
Statistics Office  said in a statement today. In the year,
production increased 6.1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
