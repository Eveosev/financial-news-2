  Turkey  is risking "digital chaos"
by delaying the shift to summer time by a day, Sabah newspaper
reported, citing the Association of Information Technology
Industrialists.  The Communications Ministry in Ankara has delayed the one-
hour change to March 28 to protect thousands of students who are
due to take the university entrance examination the day before,
Sabah said. The ministry warned banks and airlines that theyâ€™d
have to take steps to avoid disruption.  Many smart mobile phones and computers are likely to make
the scheduled adjustment a day early and there may be confusion
over bus and aircraft timetables, the newspaper said.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
