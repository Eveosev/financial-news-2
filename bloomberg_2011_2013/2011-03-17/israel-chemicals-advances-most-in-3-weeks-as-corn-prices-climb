  Israel Chemicals Ltd. (ICL) , which
extracts minerals from the  Dead Sea  to make fertilizer, rose the
most in almost three weeks as corn prices jumped.  The shares gained 3.8 percent, the most since Feb. 27, to
55.20 shekels at the 4:30 p.m. close in Tel Aviv.  Corn futures for May delivery increased 2.2 percent after a
U.S. government report showed higher export sales last week.  “This is a big move for corn and that’s benefiting the
whole sector,” said Gilad Alper, a senior analyst at Meitav
Investment House Ltd.  Prices for plant nutrients such as potassium, nitrogen and
phosphorus are climbing, as expanding food demand and inclement
weather strain global supplies of corn, soybean and wheat.  To contact the reporter on this story:
