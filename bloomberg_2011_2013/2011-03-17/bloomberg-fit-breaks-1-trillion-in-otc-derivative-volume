Bloomberg readies for 2011 launch of Swaps Execution Facility  New York  -- Bloomberg Fixed-Income Trading executives today
announced that they have broken through the $1 trillion mark in
electronically traded interest-rate swaps and credit default
swaps for 2011.  More than 16,000 trades have been executed on Bloomberg’s Fixed-
Income Trading (FIT) platform so far this year, with 23 dealers
and more than 450 buy-side participants, representing a 50
percent increase in fixed income trading volume in our system
over the last year.  “We are setting record-breaking volumes and experiencing
remarkable growth, thanks to strong participation from an
extensive list of buy-side and sell-side participants,” said Ben
Macdonald, Bloomberg Global Head of Fixed-Income. “This success
positions us well to be the industry’s leading Swap Execution
Facility.”  Bloomberg intends to register with the U.S. Commodity Futures
Trading Commission (CFTC) and the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) as a Swap Execution Facility (SEF) and Security
Based Swap Execution Facility (SBSEF) respectively, as required
by the Dodd-Frank Act.  “Our electronic trading tools for over-the-counter derivatives
and our central clearing links will be the backbone of our SEF
offering,” Macdonald said. “Meanwhile, we are still seeing
strong growth in our voice confirmation trading (VCON).”  Building on Bloomberg’s Central Counterparty Connectivity Launch
in 2009, all trades executed on Bloomberg FIT can be routed
directly to CME Clearing, the IntercontinentalExchange (ICE),
the International Derivatives Clearing Group (IDCG) and LCH.
