The commission that oversees the
customs union joining Russia, Belarus and  Kazakhstan  imposed a
permanent import tax on  palm oil .  The duty is 40 euro cents ($0.56) a kilogram (2.2 pounds),
the commission said on its  website  today. It applies to raw palm
oil and so-called fractions. Fractionation is a separating
process that makes palm oil more useful as a cooking oil.  To contact the reporter on this story:
