Foreigners bought a net C$13.3
billion ($13.4 billion) of Canadian securities in January, led
by purchases of federal  government bonds .  Foreign investors bought C$10.1 billion of bonds during the
month, Statistics Canada said today in Ottawa, with federal
government bonds accounting for just over half of the purchases.
Non-residents also bought C$1.33 billion of stocks and C$1.86
billion of money-market paper. Economists predicted a C$6
billion net purchase of Canadian securities for December,
according to the median of three estimates by Bloomberg News.  Purchases of Canadian bonds rose to an unprecedented C$95.9
billion last year, as the countryâ€™s relatively faster growth and
stronger fiscal record attracted investors. Canada is seeking to
become the first Group of Seven country to balance its budget
following the global recession, aided by a quicker-than-forecast
expansion that is fueling revenue. The economy expanded at a 3.3
percent annual pace in the fourth quarter, the fastest among
Group of Seven nations.  Canadians bought a net C$1.98 billion of foreign securities
in January, led by U.S. stocks,  Statistics Canada  said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
