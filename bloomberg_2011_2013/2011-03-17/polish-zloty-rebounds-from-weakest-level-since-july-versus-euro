The zloty rebounded versus the euro
after depreciating to its weakest level in eight months earlier
today.  The Polish currency appreciated 0.4 percent to 4.0814 per
euro as of 10:25 a.m. in Warsaw after. Earlier it reached
4.1217, its weakest intraday level since July 2010.  A 2.3 percent depreciation in the previous three sessions
pushed the 14-day relative strength index for the zloty-euro
pair to 24.8 at yesterdayâ€™s close, its lowest in 10 months.
Readings lower than 30 suggest in technical analysis that an
asset may gain. The RSI stood at 29 today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
