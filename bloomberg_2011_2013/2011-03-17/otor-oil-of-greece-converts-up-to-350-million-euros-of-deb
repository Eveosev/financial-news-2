Motor Oil Hellas SA,  Greece ’s
second-largest refiner, has stopped sales of gasoline to  Libya 
amid unrest in the North African country and extended maturity
of some of its debt.  “There are currently no gasoline sales to Libya,” Motor
Oil’s Chief Financial Officer Petros Tzannetakis said today in a
telephone interview from  Athens . “There’s no problem with
selling the gasoline” elsewhere, he said.  Libya’s civil war follows unrest in Algeria, Tunisia and
Egypt that boosted Brent crude prices to almost $120 a barrel on
concern supplies would be disrupted.  Motor Oil, based in Athens, extended maturity of 300
million to 350 million euros ($421 million to $491 million) of
debt, Tzannetakis said on a conference call earlier today.  The refiner posted 2010 net income of 131.1 million euros
from 108 million euros a year earlier, it said yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
