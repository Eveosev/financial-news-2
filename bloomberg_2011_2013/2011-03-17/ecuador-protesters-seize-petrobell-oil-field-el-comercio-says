Petrobell Inc., an Ecuadorean oil
producer, evacuated its Tiwino 5 oil field in the Amazon region
after an indigenous group took control of the site, El Comercio
reported, citing a company statement.  Petrobell asked the government for help ending the conflict
and rescuing employees who have taken shelter in the jungle to
escape protesters, the Quito-based  newspaper  said today in it’s
online edition. The newspaper didn’t say why the group was
protesting.  No one answered the telephone at Petrobell’s Quito
headquarters today after normal business hours.  To contact the reporter on this story:
