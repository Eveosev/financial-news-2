 Oman’s oil production wasn’t
affected by a strike staged yesterday by workers of Petroleum
Development Oman,  Gulf News  reported, without saying where it
obtained the information.  People employed at PDO’s Yibal, Marmul and Fahud oil fields
halted work yesterday, demanding better pay, said the Dubai-
based newspaper, citing an unidentified employee.  Demonstrations were also organized yesterday by employees
of the Port Services Corp. and guards of Security and Safety
Services who blocked the traffic to airport for a time, the
newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
