South African President  Jacob Zuma 
and four other African leaders will meet in the Mauritanian
capital on March 19 to discuss their planned effort to mediate
the crisis in Libya, the  African Union  said.  The group is “leading an urgent African action” to
encourage political reform in the North African nation where
rebels are battling Muammar Qaddafi’s government, the 53-member
bloc said in an e-mailed statement today from Addis Ababa, the
Ethiopian capital.  Zuma and the leaders of the Republic of Congo, Mauritania,
Mali and Uganda will be joined by  African Union  Commission
Chairman Jean Ping at the meeting in Nouakchott, according to
the statement.  The African Union said it wants to help to start an
“inclusive dialogue” to solve the crisis and is opposed to any
form of foreign military intervention in  Libya .  To contact the reporter on this story:
