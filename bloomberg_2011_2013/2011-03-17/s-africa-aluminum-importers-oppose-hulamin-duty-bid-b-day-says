Some Aluminium Association of South
Africa members disagreed with  Hulamin Ltd. (HLM) ’s application with
the nation’s International Trade Administration Commission for a
10 percent duty on semi-fabricated, rolled products, Business
Day reported.   Most members of the association weren’t aware of the
application and didn’t have time to lodge objections with the
commission, the Johannesburg-based newspaper cited Metal & Tool
Trade Managing Director Volker Schutte, a member of Afsa, as
saying. Hulamin Chief Executive Officer Richard Jacob said the
company followed the trade commission’s protocol, according to
Business Day.    Afsa Executive Director Mark Krieg said the association
said members were divided on Hulamin’s application and that the
organization has assumed a neutral position, the newspaper
reported.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
