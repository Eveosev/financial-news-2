The  National Football League  filed
court papers opposing a bid by players to unseal arbitration
records in a dispute over some $4 billion in television money.  U.S. District Judge David S. Doty in  Minneapolis  this month
ordered the release of redacted portions of the record. While
the players’ union and two news organizations asked for the
release of more files, the league argues they contain
commercially sensitive information.  “This material reflects the league’s internal negotiating
strategy and assessment of media rights, as well as the terms of
contracts the NFL has with various business partners,” NFL
Chief Operating Officer Brian Rolapp said in a filing today.
“If unredacted versions of these documents were disclosed, it
would cause commercial harm to the NFL.”  The union asserts the documents will show that the
television deals in question would provide owners with money
from the networks even with games canceled during a lockout. The
league says the television deals, which earned hundreds of
millions of dollars in new broadcast money by redistributing
some digital rights, were negotiated in good faith.  The case is White v. NFL, 4:92-cv-00906, U.S. District
Court, District of Minnesota (Minneapolis).  To contact the reporter on this story:
