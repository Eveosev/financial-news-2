Hitesh Zaveri, a  fund manager  at
Enam Asset Management Co. in Mumbai, which manages about $310
million, comments on the outlook for Indian stocks after the
central bank signaled inflationary pressures are building as it
raised  interest rates  today. Zaveri spoke in a phone interview
from his office today.  The Bombay Stock Exchange Sensitive Index, or Sensex, fell
0.8 percent to 18,214.76 at 1:25 p.m. local time.  The  Reserve Bank  of India increased the repurchase rate to
6.75 percent from 6.5 percent, according to an e-mailed
statement today. All 26 economists in a Bloomberg News survey
had predicted the decision. The central bank boosted the reverse
repurchase rate to 5.75 percent from 5.5 percent.  Outlook:  “The central bank’s anti-inflationary stance implies a
higher interest regime and so the upside to the stock market
will be capped. It may give very moderate returns in the next
three to six months.  Stocks to buy and sell:  ‘‘Funds may go slow on the capital goods sector gradually,
as companies may cut  capital expenditures  against the backdrop
of higher interest rate scenario. The focus may shift to the
defensive sectors like  consumer goods  and pharmaceuticals.’’
Zaveri declined to name companies.  Investment Strategy:  ‘‘Most of stocks we own are already based on the
expectation of higher interest rates, so there is going to be
status quo on that.  ‘‘Investors should now identify themes for March 2012 and
2013 and look to participate accordingly.’’  To contact the reporter on this story:
