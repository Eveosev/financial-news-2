  Bank of Baroda (BOB)  Ltd.’s Kenyan unit
said full-year profit more than doubled as interest earnings
climbed.  Net income increased to 1.39 billion shillings ($16.2
million) in the 12 months through December, from 524.2 million
shillings a year earlier, the Nairobi-based lender said in a
statement published in the Standard newspaper today. Net
interest income, the money banks earn from interest charges on
loans, grew 50 percent to 1.68 billion shillings, it said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
