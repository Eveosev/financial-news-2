The  St. Louis Blues  are for sale
after Chairman David Checketts failed to reach an agreement to
take control of the National Hockey League team, the  St. Louis
Post-Dispatch  said.  Checketts owns 20 percent of the team and said he got
financing to buy  TowerBrook Capital Partners LP ’s 70 percent
stake, although the sides couldn’t settle on a price, the
newspaper said.  “I’ve been unable to make a deal with them,” Checketts,
who owns investment company  SCP Worldwide , told the newspaper.
“As a result, I’ve got to turn from being a buyer to a
seller.”  Game Plan LLC has been hired to sell the team and the lease
for the Scottrade Center, the newspaper said. TowerBrook backs
the sale, the report said.  The team, last in the Western Conference’s five-team
Central Division, was valued at $165 million in December by
Forbes magazine, with revenue of $79 million and an operating
loss of $6.2 million.  Checketts, who bought his stake in 2006, didn’t return
voice mails left at his home and at his office after hours.  To contact the reporter on this story:
