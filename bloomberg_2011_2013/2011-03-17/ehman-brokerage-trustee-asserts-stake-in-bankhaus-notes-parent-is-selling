The trustee liquidating the  Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ)  brokerage said the unit had an ownership
interest in notes that the Lehman parent planned to buy for
$957 million from its German affiliate, Lehman Brothers Bankhaus
AG.  The trustee “reserves all rights with respect to any
future disposition of the underlying assets and notes,”
according to a court filing today.  The size of brokerage’s stake in the notes and assets
wasn’t disclosed.  Earlier this month, the Lehman parent said it will pay
$957 million to buy $1.5 billion of notes held by Bankhaus.
Lehman a year ago won a U.S. bankruptcy judge’s approval to
spend $1.4 billion to buy loans and mortgages from Bankhaus,
after telling the judge it aimed to generate gains for creditors
by buying discounted loans.  The bankruptcy case is In re Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.,
08-13555,  U.S. Bankruptcy Court , Southern District of  New York 
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
