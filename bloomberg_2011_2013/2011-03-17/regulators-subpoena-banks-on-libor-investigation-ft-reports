U.S. regulators investigating
whether U.S. and European banks manipulated the setting of the
London interbank offered rate have served subpoenas on four
banks to request information, the Financial Times reported,
citing people familiar with the matter.    UBS AG (UBSN) ,  Bank of America Corp. (BAC) ,  Citigroup Inc. (C)  and  Barclays
Plc (BARC)  received subpoenas, the FT said. WestLB AG, which has also
received requests for information, said it had not received a
subpoena, the newspaper said, citing WestLB.  Agencies involved in the probe into the setting of Libor
for U.S. dollars between 2006 and 2008 include the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission, the U.S. Commodity Futures
Trading Commission, the U.S. Department of Justice, the U.K.’s
Financial Services Authority and the Japanese Financial
Supervisory Agency, the FT said.  The regulatory agencies, Bank of America, Barclays and
Citigroup declined to comment, the FT said.  UBS said on March 15 that it had been subpoenaed by the
three U.S. agencies and also had received an information request
from  Japan .  Barclays Capital spokesman Seth Martin didn’t respond to a
call and e-mail request for comment after business hours.
Citigroup spokeswoman Danielle Romero-Apsilos declined to
comment when contacted by e-mail. Bank of America doesn’t
comment on regulatory matters, spokesman Jerry Dubrowski said by
telephone. A message left for WestLB press spokesman Richard
Bassett outside of office hours wasn’t immediately returned.  To contact the reporter on this story:
