  Walt Disney Co. (DIS)  suspended all
administrative and store operations in  Tokyo  in the aftermath of
the March 11 earthquake and tsunami in  Japan .  “Our top priority is the well-being of our employees and
their families during this challenging time and we will continue
to closely monitor the situation as it develops,” the Burbank,
California-based company said today in a statement.  Tokyo Electric Power Co. has scheduled blackouts in the
city to conserve energy. Subway lines are running fewer trains,
shops are closing early and offices are shutting off non-
essential electricity as the country copes with the disaster.
The blackouts are compounding the economic fallout from last
week’s magnitude-9 earthquake and tsunami.  Disney gained 16 cents to $40.76 at 4:15 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. The stock has advanced 8.7
percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
