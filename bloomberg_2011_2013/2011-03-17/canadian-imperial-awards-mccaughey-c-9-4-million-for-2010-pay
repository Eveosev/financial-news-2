Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce
paid Chief Executive Officer Gerald McCaughey C$9.34 million
($9.47 million) in compensation last year, 50 percent more than
the year earlier.  McCaughey, 54, received a salary of C$1.5 million, a C$3.13
million cash bonus and C$4.7 million in restricted shares, stock
options and long-term incentives for 2010, according to a filing
today by  Canada ’s fifth-biggest bank. That compared to C$6.24
million in compensation in 2009. The amounts exclude pension
costs.  McCaughey led CIBC to a profit of C$2.45 billion in the
fiscal year ended Oct. 31, double the amount in 2009. He
expanded the Toronto-based bank with three acquisitions,
including the purchase of  Citigroup Inc. (C) ’s C$2.1 billion
Canadian credit-card portfolio, a $150 million investment for a
stake in Bermuda-based Bank of N.T. Butterfield & Son Ltd., and
the purchase of CIT Business Credit Canada from partner CIT
Group Inc. to expand corporate lending.  CIBC also said it awarded Richard Nesbitt, head of the
bank’s investment-banking unit, C$7.96 million for the year, up
46 percent from 2009.  Canadian Imperial is the last of the country’s six-biggest
banks to report 2010 compensation for its top executives.  To contact the reporter on this story:
