Ethanol futures gained the most in
five months in  Chicago , following crude oil and gasoline higher,
as violence in Libya and Bahrain raised the prospect of fuel
supply disruptions.  The grain-based additive increased as Libyan leader  Muammar Qaddafi  dropped bombs around Benghazi and as Bahraini security
forces arrested six opposition leaders a day after a military
curfew was imposed on parts of the country. Ethanol is part of
U.S. energy plans to reduce foreign oil imports.  “Everything was a little oversold,” said Mike Blackford,
a consultant at INTL FCStone Inc. in  Des Moines , Iowa. “Ethanol
is playing catch up with the other energies. It’s acting well.”  Denatured ethanol for April delivery surged 10.6 cents, or
4.6 percent, to $2.403 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade,
the steepest advance since Oct. 8. Futures are up 51 percent in
the past year.  In cash market trading ethanol on the West Coast jumped 1
cent, or 0.4 percent, to $2.49 a gallon and in the U.S. Gulf the
additive increased 3 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $2.555, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in Chicago added 1.25 cents, or 0.5 percent, to
$2.375 a gallon and in  New York  the biofuel gained 3.5 cents, or
1.4 percent, to $2.495.  Crude oil for April delivery rose $3.44 to settle at
$101.42 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . It was the
biggest gain since Feb. 23. The contract is up 22 percent from a
year ago.  Gasoline futures for April delivery added 10.69 cents, or
3.8 percent, to settle at $2.9506 a gallon in New York. It was
the biggest gain since Feb. 23.  An average ethanol mill in Iowa is losing 2 cents on every
gallon produced, while a plant in  Illinois  is pocketing about 5
cents, according to Ag Trader Talk.  To contact the reporter on this story:
