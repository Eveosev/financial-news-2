Poland’s benchmark stock index rose
the most in two weeks as rallying commodity prices boosted
shares of copper producer  KGHM Polska Miedz SA (KGH)  and oil refiners.  The WIG20 Index jumped 1.6 percent to 2,757.54 at its 5:30
p.m. close in Warsaw, following western European markets higher
as investors speculated that Group of Seven nations will move to
calm markets after Japan’s earthquake-induced nuclear crisis.
The zloty strengthened 0.8 percent to 4.0648 per euro.  “The markets seem to have been oversold because of Japan
and some investors decided it’s time to buy again, particularly
ahead of tomorrow’s G-7 meeting,” Lukasz Bugaj, a Warsaw-based
analyst at Bank Millennium SA, said by phone. “In the near
future the WIG20 Index may again test the 2,800 level.”  G-7 finance chiefs will hold talks on financial markets and  Japan ’s economy tomorrow, after the March 11 quake triggered a
drop in global stocks and drove the nation’s currency to a post-
World War II high. Tokyo Electric Power Co. said the company may
connect a power cable to the Fukushima nuclear plant as workers
try to restart the cooling system and prevent a meltdown.  KGHM, the copper producer with the biggest European mine
output, jumped 3.4 percent to 175.8 zloty, its second day of
gains, as copper rose on speculation that demand may increase as
Japan rebuilds after last week’s earthquake and tsunami.  PZU SA, Poland’s largest insurer, rallied 3.3 percent to
351 zloty, the biggest jump since May 26.  Bank Pekao SA (PEO) , the
country’s second-largest lender, increased 1.7 percent to 167.9
zloty.  PKN Orlen SA, the country’s largest oil company, added 3.5
percent to 51.50 zloty, the highest close since January 2008.  Grupa Lotos SA (LTS) , the second-largest refiner, gained 2.3 percent
to 41.96 zloty. Oil rose for a second day, topping $100 a barrel
in  New York , as concerns that political unrest may cut Middle
Eastern exports countered estimates that the earthquake in Japan
will curtail fuel demand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
