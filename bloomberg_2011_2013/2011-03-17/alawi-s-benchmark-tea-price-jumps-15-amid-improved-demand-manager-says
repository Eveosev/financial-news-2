The benchmark price of tea in  Malawi ,  Africa ’s largest producer of the crop after Kenya,
jumped 15 percent at auction amid improved demand, according to
Tea Brokers Central Africa, which manages the country’s sales.  The leaf rose to $2.48 a kilogram (2.2 pounds) from $2.15
at the previous auction, Tea Brokers said in an e-mailed report
today. Since January, 4.6 million kilograms of tea have been
sold at an average price of $1.63, compared with 5.8 million
kilograms at a price of $1.71 last year, it said.  Tea is Malawi’s second-largest foreign exchange earner,
after tobacco, generating 8 percent of total export earnings.
The U.K. is typically the largest buyer of tea from Malawi.  To contact the reporter on this story:
