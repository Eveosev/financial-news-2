The lead prosecutor in the
investigation into alleged coup plots against Turkish Prime
Minister  Recep Tayyip Erdogan  is examining links to the 2007
killing of Christians in Malatya, the state-run Anatolia news
agency reported.  The former head of the military police in Malatya was
detained on authority of a search order from prosecutor Zekeriya
Oz,  Haberturk  newspaper said without specifying how it got the
information. A soldier was also detained in the eastern province
of Siirt as Oz ordered raids in nine different provinces,
Anatolia said.  Malatya was the scene of the 2007 torture and killing of
three people, including a German national, who worked at a
Christian book publisher. The attack is being investigated as
part of the widening probe into the alleged “Ergenekon” plan
to foment domestic chaos that would lead to an overthrow of
Erdogan’s government, Anatolia said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
