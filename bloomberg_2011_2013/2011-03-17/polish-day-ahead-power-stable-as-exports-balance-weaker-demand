Polish day-ahead electricity was
little changed the past week as weaker demand was balanced by
increased exports to  Germany ,  Europe ’s largest power market.
Prices may rise next week amid forecasts for colder weather.  Next-day baseload power was little changed at 199.74 zloty
($68.74) a megawatt-hour in the week to today, according to
Bloomberg calculations based on Polish Power Exchange data.  Average daily power demand was as high as 19,170 megawatts
this week, down 3.9 percent from last week’s highest daily
average, according to  system load data . Exports to Germany
increased as Poland’s neighbor announced it would halt its seven
oldest nuclear reactors for a three-month safety review after
the explosions at an atomic plant in  Japan . That’s equivalent to
25 percent of the country’s atomic capacity.  Temperatures in Warsaw may fall to as low as minus 3
degrees Celsius (27 Fahrenheit) on March 21 from today’s low of
3 degrees, according to CustomWeather Inc. data on Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
