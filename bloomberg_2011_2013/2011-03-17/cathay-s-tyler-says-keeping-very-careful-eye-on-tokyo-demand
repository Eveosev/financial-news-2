  Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd. (293)  Chief
Executive Officer Tony Tyler comments on demand for flights from  Tokyo  following an earthquake in Japan. The carrier has added
extra flights from the city yesterday and today.  He spoke today in  Hong Kong  in an interview with Bloomberg
TV.  On demand for flights from Japan:  “At the moment, with the extra flights we’ve got, we’ve
got enough seats to accommodate all the passengers who want to
come back. But we’ll keep a very careful eye on demand and of
course if we need to put more flights on we’ll do so.  ‘‘The longer-term financial, economic impact really remains
to be seen, but clearly it will probably be something of
significance because  Japan ’s a very important market for us.  ‘‘It’s very different from the old days. 30 years ago
Cathay Pacific got 30 percent of its revenue from Japan, but
that is very, very different of course nowadays. It’s nothing
like that, but it’s an important market to us.”  On his plans to fly to Tokyo today:  “I want to offer some support and thanks and encouragement
to the Cathay Pacific staff in Tokyo who’ve been working very
hard in very stressful and difficult circumstances for a week;
really making sure that Hong Kong people can get home and that
other people who need to return to Japan can do that too.
They’re doing a fantastic job and I want to go encourage them
and thank them.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
