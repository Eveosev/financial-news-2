Vitol Group, the world’s largest
independent oil trader, moved employees out of Bahrain amid
police crackdowns on anti-government protesters this week, a
company spokesman said.  About a dozen traders and operations staff are employed in
the energy trader’s Bahrain office, and non-Bahraini citizens
are now working from Vitol’s office in Dubai in the  United Arab
Emirates , said the spokesman, who asked not to be identified,
citing company policy.  More than a month of protests led by Bahrain’s majority
Shiites have resulted in several deaths among protesters and
police, and parts of the island nation’s capital, Manama, are at
a standstill. The government declared a three-month state of
emergency on March 15 as troops from  Saudi Arabia  and other Gulf
states arrived to support the regime.  An operations official who answered a call to Vitol’s
office in Bahrain directed inquiries to the Persian Gulf
regional headquarters in Dubai. The operations official, also
declining to be identified, said he was a Bahraini citizen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
