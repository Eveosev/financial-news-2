Congressional efforts to reduce the
federal deficit shouldn’t restrict funding for the  Commodity
Futures Trading Commission , which needs more money to avert a
repeat of the credit crisis, CFTC Chairman  Gary Gensler  said.  “We recognize that the  budget deficit  presents significant
challenges to Congress and the American public,” Gensler said
today in remarks prepared for a House Appropriations Committee
hearing in  Washington . “But we cannot forget that the 2008
financial crisis was very real.”  The CFTC budget has been frozen at its fiscal 2010 level --
along with those of other federal agencies -- by a stalemate
between Republicans aiming to cut spending and Democrats looking
to fund implementation of the Dodd-Frank Act. The CFTC and the
Securities and Exchange Commission are responsible for expanding
oversight of derivatives under the regulatory overhaul.  Lawmakers moved to increase regulation of the  derivatives
market  after largely unregulated trades helped spark the worst
financial crisis since the Great Depression. Dodd-Frank, enacted
in July, aims to reduce risk and boost transparency by having
most swaps traded on exchanges and guaranteed by clearinghouses.  President  Barack Obama  has requested an increase to $308
million for fiscal 2012 and proposed user fees to help the CFTC
carry out its responsibilities. The agency is currently
operating under its $169 million budget for fiscal 2010 while
the $261 million request for is tied up in congressional
negotiations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
