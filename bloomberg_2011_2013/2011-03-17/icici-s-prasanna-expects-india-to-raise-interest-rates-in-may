Prasanna Ananthasubramaniam, chief
economist at Mumbai-based ICICI Securities Primary Dealership
Ltd., comments on the  Reserve Bank  of  India ’s decision to raise
interest rates for the eighth time this year.  The central bank increased the repurchase rate to 6.75
percent from 6.5 percent, according to an e-mailed statement
today. It will announce its next monetary policy review on May
3.  “The guidance clearly suggests that we should expect
another interest rate hike in May. It will be 25 basis points.
The language is hawkish and focusing on inflation.  ‘‘The Reserve Bank of India is worried about the latest
inflation data. Their objective was to ensure that food and fuel
inflation does not filter into core inflation, but already it
looks like core inflation is moving up.’’  To contact the reporter on this story:
