Ismael R. Ozanne, the district
attorney of  Wisconsin â€™s  Dane County , filed a lawsuit in circuit
court over the passage of the law limiting collective-bargaining
rights for public-employee unions, the Wall Street Journal
reported.  Ozanne, a Democrat based in Madison, said Republicans
voting on the bill violated the law by failing to post notice of
the March 9 meeting 24 hours before it started, the newspaper
said.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
