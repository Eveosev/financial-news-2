Serbia’s government approved today
an 18.5 million-euro ($26 million) loan for the upgrade of
railways in the Bosnian Serb Republic, part of neighboring
Bosnia-Herzegovina.  The loan, approved a day before Prime Minister  Mirko Cvetkovic  travels to meet Bosnian Serb officials to discuss
closer economic ties, will have a three-year grace period on
repayment and a 1 percent annual interest rate, the press office
for Cvetkovic’s Cabinet said by telephone today.  The Bosnian Serb Republic will repay 14 million euros over
18 years and 4.5 million euros over eight years, the government
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
