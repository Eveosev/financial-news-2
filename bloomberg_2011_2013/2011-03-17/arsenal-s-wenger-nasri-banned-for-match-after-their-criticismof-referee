Arsenal manager  Arsene Wenger  and
midfielder Samri Nasri will miss the club’s first European match
next season because of their comments after the team’s 3-1
Champions League loss to Barcelona.  Wenger was also fined 10,000 euros ($14,000). The pair
criticized the officials after the March 8 match. Robin van
Persie was sent off for a second yellow card with the score 1-1,
which would have sent the London club through to the
quarterfinals.    UEFA  also banned Tottenham assistant manager Joe Jordan for
one game after his confrontation last month with AC Milan
captain Gennaro Gattuso, who was banned for four matches for his
part in the incident. Jordan will miss the first leg of Spurs’
quarterfinal match.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
