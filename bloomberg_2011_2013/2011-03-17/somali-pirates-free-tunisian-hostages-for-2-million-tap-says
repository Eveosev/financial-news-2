Somali hijackers freed crew members
of a Panama-flagged ship seized in November after they were paid
a ransom of $2 million, the state-run  Agence Tunis Afrique
Presse  reported.  The crew of the MV Hannibal II, which included 22 Tunisians
and 10 others, was released and the ship is on its way to
Djibouti, where a civilian plane will be sent to repatriate the
Tunisians, the Tunis-based agency said, citing the Transport and
Equipment Ministry.  The Hannibal was hijacked on Nov. 11 off the  Gulf of Aden ,
and the pirates had initially asked for a ransom of 7.3 million
euros ($10 billion), it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
