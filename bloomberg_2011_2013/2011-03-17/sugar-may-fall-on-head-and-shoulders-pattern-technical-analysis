Sugar in  New York  may fall as low
as 22.89 cents a pound after forming a head-and-shoulders
pattern, signaling a 12 percent decline, according to  technical
analysis  by Societe Generale SA.  The attached chart shows raw sugar for May delivery in New
York this week formed a “bearish” head-and-shoulders pattern
after prices slipped below the so-called neckline. The second
chart shows the sweetener may fall to 24.80 cents, which is
calculated by subtracting the distance of the drop from Feb. 2
through Feb. 24 from the March 8 peak, before declining to the
November low of 22.89 cents.  “We are now triggering this head and shoulders because we
are breaking the neckline,” said Stephanie Aymes, a cross-
commodity technical analyst with  Societe Generale  in London.
“We should keep on dropping on the May contract. There is a
possibility to drop all the way back to the lows of mid-
November.”  Raw sugar for May delivery traded at 25.98 cents at 12:32
p.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in New York yesterday. Prices for the
most-active contract have gained 43 percent in the past year on
concern that a global production surplus may be smaller than
expected, and reached a 30-year high of 36.08 cents on Feb. 2.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index. The head-and-shoulders pattern
occurs when prices form consecutive troughs, with the middle
trough being either higher or lower than the other two.  To contact the reporter on this story:
