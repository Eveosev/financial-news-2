The UN Security Council approved a
resolution authorizing a no-fly zone over  Libya , demanding a
cease-fire and allowing “all necessary measures” to protect
civilians, “excluding a foreign occupation force of any form on
any part of Libyan territory.”  Ten nations, including the  United States , voted for the
measure, none against it, and five abstained. Russia and  China ,
which hold veto power, abstained.  To contact the reporter on this story:
