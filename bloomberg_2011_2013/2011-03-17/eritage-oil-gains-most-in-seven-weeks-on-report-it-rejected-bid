  Heritage Oil Plc (HOIL)  rose the most in
more than eight months in London after the Financial Times
reported that the company rejected a 1.2 billion-pound ($1.9
billion) takeover bid as too small.  Heritage advanced 23.8 pence, or 8.2 percent, to 313.5
pence, the most since July 6.  An unidentified Abu Dhabi-based company made an informal
bid of 425 pence a share, the newspaper reported.  Heritageâ€™s Chief Financial Officer Paul Atherton and  Tanya
Clarke , head of  investor relations  at the company, were not
immediately available for comment when two calls were made to
each of their mobile phones today.  The Jersey, the U.K.-based company is exploring for oil and
gas in the Iraqi region of Kurdistan,  Pakistan , Tanzania, Mali,
the Democratic Republic of Congo and Russia, according to its
 website .  In January, Heritage shares plunged the most in almost
three years after it discovered natural gas instead of oil in
its Miran West-2 well in Kurdistan. Atherton at the time said
the company may supply gas to  Turkey  and to  Europe  through a
planned pipeline.  Heritage had $614 million in cash as of the end of
September, it said in a statement. Most of it was secured last
year after selling its oil field interests in the Lake Albert
basin in Uganda to Tullow Oil Plc for about $1.5 billion.  Heritage has been in a dispute with the Ugandan government
over the assets sale after the authorities claimed it owed about
$404 million in capital gains tax.  The company had to deposit about $121.5 million with the
Ugandan Revenue Authority and $283.4 million in an escrow
account to complete the transaction with Tullow, which this week
signed a memorandum with the government to advance oil
development in country.  To contact the reporter on this story:
