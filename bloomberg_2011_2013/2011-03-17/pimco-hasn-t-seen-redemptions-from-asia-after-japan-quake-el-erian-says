Pacific Investment Management Co.,
the world’s biggest manager of bond funds, hasn’t seen
redemptions from Asia investors following last week’s earthquake
in  Japan , Chief Executive Officer Mohamed El-Erian said.   The immediate effect is to worry about the human
consequences first, El-Erian said in an interview
with Margaret Brennan on Bloomberg Television’s “InBusiness.”  The yen strengthened for a fifth day on speculation Japan
will delay intervention to limit the currency’s advance to
counter the repatriation of assets by insurers and investors
seeking to pay for damages after the nation’s worst earthquake.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
