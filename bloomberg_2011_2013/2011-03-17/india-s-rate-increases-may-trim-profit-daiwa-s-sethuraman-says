N. Sethuraman Iyer, chief
investment officer of Daiwa Asset Management India Pvt.,
comments on the outlook for Indian stocks after the central bank
signaled inflationary pressures are building as it raised  interest rates  today. Iyer, who oversees about 4 billion rupees
($88.5 million) in assets spoke in a phone interview from his
office in Mumbai today.  The Bombay Stock Exchange’s Sensitive Index, or Sensex,
fell 0.6 percent to 18,258.28 at 12:48 p.m. in Mumbai.  The  Reserve Bank  of India increased the repurchase rate to
6.75 percent from 6.5 percent, according to an e-mailed
statement today. All 26 economists in a Bloomberg News survey
had predicted the decision. The central bank boosted the reverse
repurchase rate to 5.75 percent from 5.5 percent.  “The concern is that at some point of time all these rate
increases are going to hurt growth.  ‘‘I don’t think we can work with the same kind of growth
projections that have been let out by the government.  ‘‘There won’t be an immediate shift of funds from the rate-
sensitive sectors like automakers, but if it happens it will be
a gradual shift if the rates keep rising.  ‘‘Investors now need to be more conservative on what kind
of return expectations they are working on. Earnings growth
expectations of as much as 25 percent for the next year may now
moderate to as little as 15 percent.’’  To contact the reporter on this story:
