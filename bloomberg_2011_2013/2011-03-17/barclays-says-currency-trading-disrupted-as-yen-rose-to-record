  Barclays Plc (BARC)  said it halted trading
of the yen versus the dollar yesterday on its foreign-exchange
trading system as the Japanese currency surged to a record high
in late New York trading.  “Due to unprecedented volume in yen-based currency pairs,
we extended our normal daily reset time period between New
York/Asia time zones,” London-based spokeswoman Schuyler
Clemente said in a statement today. “Subsequent to this, we
maintained superior yen pricing through a period of extremely
high volume without interruption.”  The yen reached a post-World War II record against the
dollar, jumping 4.5 percent in 26 minutes as the risk of
radiation leaks from a crippled Japanese nuclear plant stoked
speculation insurers and investors will redeem overseas assets
to pay for reconstruction. Barclays, the U.K.’s third-biggest
bank, wasn’t more specific about the extent of the delay.  The yen strengthened to as high as 76.36 per dollar at 5:21
p.m. in  New York  yesterday, according to a quote recap available
in Bloomberg data, from 79.78 at 4:55 p.m.  Japan ’s currency
closed 0.9 percent higher at 78.89 in New York trading today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
