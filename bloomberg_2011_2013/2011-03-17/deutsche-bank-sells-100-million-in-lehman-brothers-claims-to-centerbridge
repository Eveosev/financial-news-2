  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  sold $100 million
in claims on bankrupt Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. to
Centerbridge Partners LP units.  The claims on Lehman and its commercial paper unit had the
same numbers as the $325 million claims sold earlier by  Swedbank
AB (SWEDA)  to Frankfurt-based Deutsche Bank, according to records in  U.S. Bankruptcy Court  in Manhattan. Earlier this week,  Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  disclosed it had bought $50 million of the same
claims. Och-Ziff Capital Management Group LLC bought $20
million.  Creditors and investors are buying Lehman claims in advance
of a wrangle over a $61 billion payment plan, which they may
vote on by Oct. 14, Lehman said yesterday in a filing. Holders
of claims on Lehman’s commercial paper and derivatives units are
in line to claim extra money from the parent company, which
guaranteed the units’ debt.  Opposing them, Paulson & Co. and other bondholders managed
to improve their promised payout after filing a liquidation
proposal that competed with Lehman’s.  Trading in IOUs issued by Lehman totaled $28.8 billion last
year, four times the total for 2009, according to data from
SecondMarket Holdings Inc., which tracks illiquid markets.  The case is In re  Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ) , 08-13555,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
