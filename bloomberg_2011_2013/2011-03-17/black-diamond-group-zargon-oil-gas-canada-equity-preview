Canadian stocks rose, capping a
weekly gain, as mining shares increased with precious metal
prices after the Group of Seven nations agreed to intervene in
 currency markets  following last week’s earthquake in Japan.  Barrick Gold Corp. (ABX) , the world’s biggest producer of the
precious metal, advanced 2.3 percent, as gold rallied for the
third day on investor demand for an alternative to gyrating
currencies.  Goldcorp Inc. (G)  gained 2.1 percent.  Kinross Gold Corp. (K) 
added 1.2 percent.  Suncor Energy Inc. (SU)  fell 2 percent  after oil
declined on a cease-fire in Libya.  The Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index advanced 43.48
points, or 0.3 percent, to close at 13,789.63 in Toronto for a
0.8 percent weekly gain.  “We had the shock come in that sent markets down,” said
Sadiq Adatia, who oversees C$12 billion ($12.2 billion) of
assets as Toronto-based chief investment officer at Russell
Investments Canada. “You notice very quickly how people are
starting to grab up names again and jump back in the market.
It’s more of a buying opportunity.”  A subgroup of raw materials producers in the benchmark
Canadian equity index slumped 7.8 percent from March 4 through
March 16 as commodity prices fell. Gold and silver declined as
investors sold precious metals to raise cash as equity markets
fell after the March 11 earthquake.  Japan’s central bank repeated its pledge to pursue
“powerful monetary easing” as policy makers sought to reduce
the threat of the world’s third-largest economy sinking into a
recession. Japan began the effort, with  Europe ’s central banks
following up in their markets, sending the yen down the most
against the dollar since 2008.  Precious Metals  Gold climbed for a third day, rising 0.8 percent to
$1,416.10 an ounce in  New York . Silver advanced 2.3 percent to
$35.058 an ounce.  Barrick rallied 2.3 percent to C$48.87. Goldcorp advanced
2.1 percent to C$46.76. Kinross added 1.2 percent to C$14.51.
Agnico-Eagle Mines Ltd. rose 1.8 percent to C$65.55.  Silver Wheaton Corp. (SLW)  added 2.4 percent to C$39.25.  Greystar Resources Ltd. (GSL)  slumped 1.9 percent to C$2.75.
Colombia plans to reject Greystar’s proposed $1 billion gold and
silver mine, which lacked “viability” because of environmental
concerns, Colombia’s Mines and Energy Minister Carlos Rodado
said.  The company said today in a statement it will meet with
regulators next week to discuss “alternative options.”
Vancouver-based Greystar withdrew its permit applications
yesterday for the Angostura deposit in northeastern Colombia,
according to Rodado.  Crude Declines  Oil fell after Libya said it will cease military operations
against rebels and begin talks aimed at resolving the dispute
that has curtailed crude production and exports.  Crude oil for April delivery dropped 35 cents to settle at
$101.07 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Futures
were up as much as 2.2 percent intraday before the Libyan
announcement.  Suncor Energy slumped 2 percent to C$43.09.  Canadian
Natural Resources Ltd. (CNQ)  dropped 0.9 percent to C$47.81.  Encana
Corp. (ECA)  rose 1.7 percent to C$33.65, the highest price since July.
 Talisman Energy Inc. (TLM)  advanced 1.5 percent to C$23.64.  Uranium One Inc. was the biggest gainer in the Canadian
benchmark equity index, paring its weekly decline to 34 percent.
The shares rose 14 percent to C$3.93 today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
