The U.S. housing market is “close
to the bottom,” said Jan Hatzius, chief economist at Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. in  New York .  “The valuation of real estate is much more reasonable
now,” Hatzius said today in an interview on Bloomberg
Television. “Over the next few years, the housing sector is
going to improve.” For now, “there’s still a lot of excess
supply out there,” he said.  Sales of U.S. previously owned homes unexpectedly climbed
in January to the highest level in eight months, led by rising
demand for distressed properties as investors took advantage of
lower prices, figures from the National Association of Realtors
showed last month.  To contact the reporters on this story:
