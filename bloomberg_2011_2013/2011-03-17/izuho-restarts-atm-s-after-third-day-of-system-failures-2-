  Mizuho Financial Group Inc. (8411) ,  Japan ’s third-biggest bank by market value, restarted automated
teller machine service nationwide, its third day of system
outages following the country’s biggest earthquake on record.  While Mizuho Bank is investigating the exact cause of the
disruption, a surge in transactions may have caused the glitch,
said the bank’s President Satoru Nishibori at a press conference
held in  Tokyo  today. It may take more time for the system to
return to normal operation, he said.  The breakdowns follow a two-day outage of its money
transfer system and today’s ATM and Internet service failure
after a record 9-magnitude earthquake struck Japan on March 11,
leading to power outages. The system failure is not related to
the earthquake, Nishibori said.  The Tokyo-based company’s Mizuho Bank unit as of yesterday
was unable to complete 440,000 transactions valued at 570
billion yen ($7.2 billion), it said in a statement on its
website. Unit spokesman Gaku Deguchi said the system was
restarted at 11:30 a.m.  Earlier this week, Prime Minister  Naoto Kan  appealed for
calm as the government worked to help hundreds of thousands of
people facing freezing temperatures with no power, while Tokyo
Electric Power Co. battled to prevent a nuclear catastrophe at
its earthquake-damaged Fukushima plant 220 kilometers (135
miles) north of Tokyo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
