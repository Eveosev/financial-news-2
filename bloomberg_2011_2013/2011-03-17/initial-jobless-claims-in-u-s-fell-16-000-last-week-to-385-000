Fewer Americans filed first-time
claims for  unemployment insurance  payments for a third week in
the last four, indicating progress in the labor market.  Applications for jobless benefits decreased 16,000 in the
period ended March 12 to 385,000, in line with the median
forecast in a Bloomberg News survey, Labor Department figures
showed today. The four-week average of claims dropped to the
lowest level since July 2008. The number of people on
unemployment benefit rolls fell, while those getting extended
payments rose.  Fewer firings along with increased hiring and a lower
unemployment rate may help lift household spending, which
accounts for 70 percent of the economy. Federal Reserve policy
makers this week said the expansion is getting stronger and the
labor market is “improving gradually.”  “As demand has picked up, and the labor component of the
economy has been relatively tight, businesses are now seeking to
add more to their employment ranks,” said  Russell Price , a
senior economist at Ameriprise Financial Inc. in  Detroit , who
correctly forecast the number of initial claims.  Economists projected 388,000 claims last week after a
previously reported 397,000, according to the median estimate in
the Bloomberg survey. Projections ranged from 375,000 to 400,000
in the survey of 44 economists.  Today’s report covers the week the Labor Department surveys
businesses to calculate the monthly payroll figures. The four-
week moving average, a less-volatile measure, declined to
386,250 from 393,250.  Stock Futures  Stock-index futures held gains after the reports. The
contract on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 1.1 percent to
1,268.2 at 8:37 a.m. in  New York . Treasuries fell, pushing up
the yield on the benchmark 10-year note to 3.25 percent from
3.17 percent.  The number of people continuing to collect jobless benefits
fell by 80,000 in the week ended March 5 to 3.71 million.
Economists forecast the number would drop to 3.75 million,
according to the Bloomberg survey. The continuing claims figure
does not include the number of workers receiving extended
benefits under federal programs.  Those who’ve used up their traditional benefits and are now
collecting emergency and extended payments increased by about
54,000 to 4.36 million in the week ended Feb. 26.  The  unemployment rate  among people eligible for benefits,
which tends to track the jobless rate, held at 3 percent for a
third week.  States, Territories  Forty-two states and territories reported an increase in
claims, while 11 had a decrease in the week ended March 5. These
data are reported with a one-week lag.  Initial jobless claims reflect weekly firings and tend to
fall as job growth -- measured by the monthly non-farm payrolls
report -- accelerates.  Earlier this month, Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  told
Congress that while economic growth will accelerate this year,
he wanted to see a “sustained period of stronger  job
creation .”  U.S. central bankers this week reiterated his view during
their second meeting of the year, reaffirming plans to buy $600
billion of Treasuries through June to boost growth. Fed
officials said in a statement that “the unemployment rate
remains elevated.”  Demand Effect  Retailers like  Foot Locker Inc. (FL) , the largest U.S. athletic
shoe store chain, also said unemployment must keeping declining
to sustain demand.  “As we begin 2011, there are encouraging signs that the  U.S. economy  is stabilizing,” Robert W. McHugh, chief financial
officer at the New York-based company, said during a March 3
earnings call. “However, unemployment, while coming down
slowly, remains high and there is risk that rising costs may
continue to put downward pressure on overall  consumer
spending .”  Still, Bernanke said during his March 1 testimony to
lawmakers that there are “grounds for optimism about the job
market over the next few quarters, including notable declines in
the unemployment rate in December and January, a drop in new
claims for unemployment insurance, and an improvement in firms’
hiring plans.”  The jobless rate fell in February to 8.9 percent, the
lowest since April 2009 and the third straight monthly decline,
Labor Department figures showed March 4. More seasonable weather
helped boost payrolls by 192,000, the most since May.  To contact the reporter on this story:
