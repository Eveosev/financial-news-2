RTL Group and  Modern Times Group AB (MTGA) 
have submitted bids for  ProSiebenSat.1 Media AG (PSM) ’s units in
Belgium and Scandinavia, three people familiar with the matter
said. ProSiebenSat.1 rose 4.2 percent in Frankfurt trading.  RTL Group,  Europe ’s biggest broadcaster, bid for assets in
Belgium and Modern Times, Sweden’s largest private broadcaster,
made an offer for the Scandinavian division, the people said.
They didn’t specify how much the offers are worth and declined
to be identified because the talks are confidential.  Telegraaf
Media Groep NV (TELEG) , which owns 12 percent stake of ProSiebenSat.1,
is interested in the Dutch assets, one person said.  ProSiebenSat.1,  Germany ’s biggest private broadcaster, has
solicited bids for its channels in Scandinavia, Belgium and the  Netherlands . Chief Executive Officer Thomas Ebeling said March 3
a decision on a possible sale of these businesses would take
place in the second quarter. ProSiebenSat.1’s assets in the
Nordic region,  Belgium  and Netherlands had a combined value of 2
billion euros, according to the company’s 2009 annual report.  RTL and Modern Times would “clearly achieve synergies,”
said Sarah Simon, a media analyst in  London  for Berenberg Bank.
She said that in the past, both companies have “done more
organic deals rather than M&A, so they are likely to be on the
cautious side of valuation.” Simon has a hold rating and a 23
euros share-price target on ProSiebenSat.1.  ProSiebenSat.1 shares rose 80.5 cents to 20.15 euros.
Modern Times climbed 3.2 percent in Stockholm.  Speculation  Publications including the Financial Times have reported
that Belgian media group De Persgroep NV and Finland’s  Sanoma
Oyj (SAA1V)  may also be interested in ProSiebenSat.1’s Belgian and Dutch
operations.  Spokespeople for RTL, Modern Times, ProSiebenSat.1,
Telegraaf Media, KKR and Permira and Sanoma declined to comment
today. De Persgroep couldn’t immediately be reached for comment.
Modern Times is looking at ProSiebenSat.1’s Scandinavian assets,
CEO  Hans-Holger Albrecht   told  Swedish newspaper  Dagens Industri 
this year.  ProSiebenSat.1 is controlled by private-equity firms
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. and Permira Advisers LLP. In 2007,
they combined ProSiebenSat.1 with SBS Broadcasting Group,
another company they control, to add TV stations and radio
networks in Scandinavia, Belgium, Netherlands and southeastern
Europe. KKR and Permira may sell their interest in the company,
Die Welt reported in December, citing people in the financial
markets it didn’t identify.  ‘Operating Momentum’  “It makes sense to sell now when there is operating
momentum,” said Sonia Rabussier, a media analyst for Silvia
Quandt Bank in Frankfurt. She said the owners “are definitely
interested in deleveraging” the company to make it more
attractive for either a financial investor or for a share
placement.  ProSiebenSat1 on March 3 proposed a higher dividend as
recurring fourth-quarter operating profit rose 17 percent on
higher advertising revenue.  The Unterfoehring, Germany-based company runs the Kanal 5
and Kanal 9 television channels in  Sweden , the TV Norge, FEM,
The Voice TV and Max channels in Norway, The Voice TV and TV
Viisi channels in Finland and the Kanal 5, Kanal 4, The Voice TV
and 6’eren channels in Denmark. In the Netherlands, it has the
SBS 6, Net5 and Veronica channels and in Belgium, ProSiebenSat.1
owns the VT4 and VIJFTV channels.  European Operations  Modern Times’ Viasat broadcasting unit runs more than 60
television channels in 33 countries and RTL has 40 television
channels and 33  radio stations  in 10 countries according to the
companies’ websites.  ProSiebenSat.1, Germany’s biggest broadcaster, had 2009
sales of 335 million euros ($469 million) in the Nordic region,
or about 12 percent of revenue, and was listed with an asset
value of 914 million euros in the annual report. In Belgium and
the Netherlands, ProSiebenSat.1 had sales of 392 million euros,
with the assets valued at 1.12 billion euros. Final bids are due
at the start of April, one of the people said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
