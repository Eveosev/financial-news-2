  Vietnam , the world’s largest
producer of robusta beans, exported 40,000 metric tons of coffee
in the first 10 days of March, Dutch coffee trader  Nedcoffee BV 
said.  February shipments totaled 83,944 tons, while stockpiles at
the end of February were 262,465 tons, Nedcoffee, which has
offices in Vietnam, said in an e-mailed report.  Vietnam exports were forecast to reach 90,000 tons in
February, according to figures released by the  General
Statistics Office  in Hanoi, the capital, on Feb. 25. Exports may
rise 9.4 percent to 1.28 million tons this calendar year, the
 Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development  said Feb. 9.  The price of coffee in Vietnam has risen as high as 46,500
dong ($2.23) a kilogram, surpassing a record in 1994, Thoi Bao
Kinh Te Vietnam newspaper reported March 7 without saying where
it got the information.  “Due to this high price of coffee, financial difficulties
appear, so most of the coffee exporters in the country have only
bought and exported about 30 to 40 percent of the annual plan
for 2010-11,” Nedcoffee said in the report.  Robusta coffee for May delivery rose $109, or 4.4 percent,
to $2,596 a ton at 2:13 p.m. on NYSE Liffe in  London . Prices
earlier today reached $2,615, the highest level since March 13,
2008.  Robusta, used in instant coffee and espresso, is harvested
mostly in  Asia  and parts of  Africa . The arabica variety is grown
mainly in Latin America and favored for specialty beverages such
as those made by Starbucks Corp.  To contact the reporter on this story:
