Shanto Ghosh, an economist at
Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu India Pvt. comments on India’s
inflation and  interest rates . The  Reserve Bank  of India today
raised the repurchase rate and reverse repurchase rate by a
quarter percentage point each to 6.75 percent and 5.75 percent.
Ghosh spoke in a telephone interview from  New Delhi .  “The pressures to manage inflation, out of the evolving
domestic and global situations, have only intensified. So the
pace of further monetary tightening may see some acceleration.  ‘‘I am expecting another 100 basis points increase in
interest rates in the next 12 months. We surely need some out-
of-the-box thinking now that the pressures from oil price
volatility are intensifying.  ‘‘I am beginning to wonder if the central bank is running
out of options in managing the inflation situation. The central
bank hasn’t specified on why the previous policy measures did
not have the desired impact.’’  To contact the reporter on this story:
