  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  wants to be
compensated for the canceled carbon-capture and storage project
in Barendrecht, the Netherlands,  Algemeen Dagblad  reported,
citing a company spokesman.  Shell incurred costs before the government unilaterally
annulled the contract, the newspaper cited spokesman Wim van de
Wiel as saying. The project was canceled Nov. 4 after residents
and town officials opposed the plan, citing safety concerns and
the facilityâ€™s experimental nature.  To contact the reporter on this story:
