Alcoa Inc.  rejected a report
published yesterday in the  Tuoi Tre  newspaper that it agreed to
temporarily halt a bauxite project in  Vietnam  pending a
government review of the industry.  “We have not called a halt to the project,” Mike Belwood,
a spokesman for the New York-based company, said today in a
telephone interview. “We are awaiting the master review then we
will make further decisions around development of the project.”  Aluminum Corp of China Ltd.,  known as Chalco, also agreed
to a suspension of its bauxite project, Tuoi Tre reported
yesterday. A spokesman for Chalco declined to comment when
contacted by Bloomberg News.  The Vietnamese government asked state-owned  Vietnam
National Coal-Mineral Industries Group , known as Vinacomin, to
suspend the projects, pending the development of a masterplan
for the country’s bauxite industry, the newspaper reported.
Vinacomin is a partner in the projects with Chalco and Alcoa.  Vinacomin has been waiting for two years for the government
to revise its masterplan, Nguyen Van Hoa, a deputy chief
executive officer at Vinacomin, said today in a phone interview.  Alcoa in 2008 signed an agreement to work with Vinacomin to
develop Vietnam’s aluminum industry, which included exploring
the feasibility of developing a bauxite mine and alumina
refinery in Dak Nong province and conducting due diligence on
acquiring a stake in another proposed alumina refinery.  -  Nicholas Heath . With reporting from Nguyen Dieu Tu Uyen in
