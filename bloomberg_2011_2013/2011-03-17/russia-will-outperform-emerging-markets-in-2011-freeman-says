Russia’s stocks will outperform
emerging-markets peers by the end of this year, according to
Ronald Freeman, a member of OAO Severstal’s board.  “People are still predicting about a 10 to 12 percent rise
in the oil price, so it’s pretty locked in,” Freeman said at
the Bloomberg Link Hedge Fund Conference in  London  today. “You
can also make money in Russian fixed income -- the spreads have
come down by half, and could come down by half again.”  Russia’s Micex Index has rallied 2.9 percent so far this
year as oil, the country’s chief export earner, surged on
protests and uprisings in the Middle East and North Africa.  To contact the reporter on this story:
