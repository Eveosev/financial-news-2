Workers battling to prevent a
meltdown at a stricken nuclear power plant in northern  Japan 
will use helicopters to spray water on the reactors, an
official at the Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency said today.  The operations will begin as soon as conditions allow, the
official said in a televised press conference. Workers would
also spray water from the ground on the Fukushima Dai-Ichi
nuclear power plant if possible, he said.  Some of the power at the plant may be restored in the
afternoon, the official said. A  power outage  that occurred
after the magnitude-9.0 earthquake struck March 11 crippled the
cooling mechanisms at the reactors. Workers have struggled to
keep water levels high enough to prevent a meltdown.  Editor: Brian Fowler.  To contact the reporter on this story:
