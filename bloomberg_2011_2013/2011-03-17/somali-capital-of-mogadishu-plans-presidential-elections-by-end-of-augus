Somalia’s capital, Mogadishu, will
hold a presidential election before the end of August, said
Sharif Hassan Sheikh Adan, the speaker of parliament.  “There will be a committee that organizes the presidential
elections including the African Union,” the six-nation
Intergovernmental Authority on Development and the  United
Nations , Adan said in a statement read by Awad Ahmed Ashara, a
spokesman for parliament, in the city today.  The Western-backed Transitional Federal Government of
Somalia’s mandate is scheduled to expire in August. Last month,
Somali lawmakers announced they would extend parliament’s tenure
for three more years, even after the government failed to enact
a new constitution or organize elections. President Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed has called for a review of the extension,
while Adan has said lawmakers won’t reverse the decision.  Most of southern and central Somalia has been seized by the
Islamist al-Shabaab militia since it began a campaign against
the government in 2007, while President Sheikh Sharif’s
administration controls only parts of Mogadishu, backed by  African Union  peacekeepers. The U.S. accuses al-Shabaab of
having links to al-Qaeda.  The UN has said it regrets the decision by parliament to
extend its mandate and wants the TFG replaced by a new body.
Somalia hasn’t had a functioning central administration since
the ouster of former dictator Mohamed Siad Barre in 1991.  To contact the reporter on this story:
