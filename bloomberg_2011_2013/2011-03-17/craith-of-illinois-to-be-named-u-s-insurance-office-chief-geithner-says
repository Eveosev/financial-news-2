Michael McRaith, director of the
Illinois Department of Insurance, will be named to lead the new
Federal Insurance Office, U.S. Treasury Secretary  Timothy F.
Geithner  said today.  The office was created by last year’s Dodd-Frank financial
overhaul law to gather data on the  insurance industry  and to
negotiate internationally on its behalf. The office doesn’t have
regulatory power.  Geithner made the announcement during a meeting of the
Financial Stability Oversight Council in Washington today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
