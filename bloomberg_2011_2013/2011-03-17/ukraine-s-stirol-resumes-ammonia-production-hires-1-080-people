PAT Concern Stirol, a Ukrainian
chemical maker, said it restarted production of ammonium nitrate
after fixing equipment that had been idle since 2009 because of
an accident.  The company, based in Horlivka, eastern  Ukraine , produced
20,000 tons of ammonium nitrate in February, up from 5,000 tons
the previous month, Chief Executive Officer Serhiy Pavlyuchuk
said today in an e-mailed statement.  Stirol also hired 1,080 people and now employs more than
4,000, according to the statement. The company was set up in
1933 and 85 percent of its products are exported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
