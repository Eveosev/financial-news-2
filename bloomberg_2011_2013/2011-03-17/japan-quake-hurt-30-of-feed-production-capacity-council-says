(Corrects to show area earthquake damage was in area that
accounts for 30 percent of capacity. Story was published March
17.)  The earthquake and tsunami last
week in  Japan  “severely damaged” importing facilities in a
part of the country that accounts for about 30 percent of total
compound feed-production capacity, the U.S. Grains Council said.  “While no official reports on total grain-trade impact
have been made known to the Council, major importing facilities
in northern mainland Japan have been severely damaged by the
natural disaster, causing some to be not operational for the
time being,” the trade group said today in an e-mail. Japan’s
production capacity was about 25 million metric tons, the group
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
