  HMV Group Plc (HMV)  Chief Executive
Officer Simon Fox said speculation of the retailer’s “premature
death” is destabilizing and vowed that the music and DVD chain
will survive.  “In five years’ time we will still have hundreds of stores
on the high streets,” the CEO of the Maidenhead, England-based
company told reporters today at the Retail Week conference
in  London . HMV is “absolutely” meeting a timetable to work
with its lenders, Fox said.  HMV, the owner of about 600 Waterstone’s bookstores and
HMV music outlets, is closing 60 stores this year and halving
its dividend to stave off collapse. The retailer is halfway
through the closures with “the vast majority” achieved through
letting leases expire, which is cheaper than renegotiating with
landlords to abandon stores, Fox said.  The retailer’s stock surged as much as 17 percent and was
up 1.75 pence, or 15 percent, at 13.25 pence as of 2:54 p.m. in
London. The gain pared HMV’s six-month decline to 77 percent.  Fox is betting on new technologies like Apple Inc.’s iPad,
a music ticketing and festival business, and  internet sales  to
drive growth. The retailer said March 1 that full-year pretax
profit before one-time items is likely to be “moderately
below” analysts’ estimates, and that it may not meet some
banking covenant tests.  “It’s very difficult for our staff at the moment” because
of speculation the company may fold, Fox said. “I’m very
confident they have a long-term future but obviously it’s
unsettling for all of us to read what we often read.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
