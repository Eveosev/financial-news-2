The effects of an earthquake in  Japan  on global equities may be limited and the MSCI All-Country
World Index is “mildly oversold,” increasing opportunities to
buy in the event of further declines, Citigroup Inc. said.  “The latest setback has driven the index back 4 percent
below our target line so making future returns look more
attractive again,” according to a report dated yesterday by
analysts led by  Robert Buckland .  The index of shares in developed and emerging markets
retreated for a fourth day, losing 0.2 percent to 323.39 as of
12:32 p.m. Singapore time. The gauge has lost 4 percent since
the March 11 earthquake and tsunami that killed more than 4,000
people and crippled a nuclear power facility. Citigroup has an
end-2011 target of 360 for the index.  “Perhaps ongoing fears about events in the Middle East and
Japan will provide the impetus for global equities to get even
more oversold,” Buckland, Citigroup’s London-based chief global
equity strategist, said in the report. “Unless these events
have a meaningful impact upon the global economy, which we do
not think they will, then a further sell-off would offer an
opportunity for us to get more bullish.”  Investors are trying to assess whether the quake will hurt
Japan’s economy enough to derail worldwide growth spurred by
more than $12 trillion pumped into the financial system by
governments and central banks since 2008. Global gross domestic
product is forecast to expand 4.4 percent this year and 4.5
percent in 2012, according to the Washington-based  International
Monetary Fund .  Japan’s Growth  Japan accounted for $5.4 trillion, or 8.7 percent, of world
GDP in 2010, when the global economy expanded by 5 percent, the
fastest pace since 2007, the  IMF  said. Japan may expand 1.5
percent this year, the fifth-worst rate among the world’s 24
developed nations, according to the IMF’s World Economic Outlook
from October.  Japan’s earthquake may cause damage of as much as 10
trillion yen ($126 billion), or 2 percent of gross domestic
product, close to the damage caused by the Kobe earthquake in
1995, Citigroup said in the report. The immediate reaction of
the Japanese equity market is “overdone,” the brokerage said,
adding that it will stay “overweight” on Japanese stocks amid
low valuations and the prospect for recovery.  Japan’s Prime Minister  Naoto Kan  said March 13 Japan is
facing its worst crisis since World War II after the quake. The
official death toll at 8 a.m. Tokyo time was 4,314 people, with
8,606 missing, the  National Police Agency  said. The tsunami and
fears of a meltdown at Tokyo Electric Power Co.’s Fukushima Dai-
Ichi nuclear plant forced 451,059 people from their homes.  Exchange’s Appeal  Tokyo Stock Exchange President  Atsushi Saito  appealed for
calm on March 15 as the  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average plunged 16
percent in the first two trading days after the earthquake, the
most for the period since 1987. The measure rebounded 5.7
percent yesterday.  The Nikkei dropped 0.7 percent in recent trading, leaving
the gauge 13 percent lower since the close on March 10, the day
before the earthquake struck.  To contact the reporter on this story:
