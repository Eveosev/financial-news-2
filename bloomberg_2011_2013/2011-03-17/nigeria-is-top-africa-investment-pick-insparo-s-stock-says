  Nigeria  is Insparo Asset
Management’s favorite choice for investment in African and
Middle Eastern frontier markets, according to Chief Strategist
Graham Stock.  Nigeria is his top pick because of its oil exports, fast-
growing economy and strong consumer demand, Stock said at the
Bloomberg Link Hedge Fund Conference in  London  today.  Ghana and
Qatar are also among the company’s favorites, he said.  Nigeria, Africa’s largest producer of the commodity, gets
more than 80 percent of its revenue from oil.  To contact the reporter on this story:
