Japanese Prime Minister  Naoto Kan 
named former Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii as a special
adviser to help with the government’s response to a nuclear
crisis and its worst earthquake on record.  Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano made the announcement
at a news briefing today in Tokyo. Fujii, currently deputy
cabinet secretary, will be replaced by  Yoshito Sengoku , who held
Edano’s post until two months ago.  Edano urged Japanese to cut their energy consumption in
Tokyo after Tokyo Electric Power Co., operator of the stricken
Fukushima nuclear plant 135 miles north of the capital, said
sudden blackouts in the city were possible.  Edano said he had no information on whether workers had
begun spraying water from a mobile cannon onto reactor No. 3 at
the Fukushima plant. He said he hoped the reactor would begin
cooling as soon as possible.  To contact the reporter on this story:
