Big Buck’s, the 10-11 favorite
ridden by Ruby Walsh, won his third consecutive World Hurdle,
the main race of the day at the centenary Cheltenham horseracing
festival.  Big Buck’s, trained by Paul Nicholls, took the lead from
Cross Kennon heading to the last of 12 fences then held off a
late charge from Grands Crus (7-2) to match Inglis Dever’s mark
of three victories in the three-mile race in western  England .
Mourad, at 8-1 odds, finished third.  “He’s an airplane,” Walsh told Channel 4. “He’s a
wonderful horse.”  Big Buck’s is the first horse to win the World Hurdle three
straight years. Inglis Dever’s victories came in 2005, 2007 and
2008.  “Class is what he’s got and that was awesome today,”
Nicholls said. “I think that was Big Buck’s career best.”  Today’s other winners were Noble Prince (4-1),  Buena Vista 
(20-1), Albertas Run (6-1), Holmwood Legend (25-1), Junior (10-
3) and Plato (6-4).  The four-day Cheltenham festival, one of the main events on
the U.K. jumps-racing calendar, ends tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
