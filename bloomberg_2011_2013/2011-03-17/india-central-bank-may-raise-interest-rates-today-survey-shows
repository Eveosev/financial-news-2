India’s central bank may raise  interest rates  today, a Bloomberg News survey showed, after
inflation accelerated last month.  The  Reserve Bank  of India will probably increase its
repurchase rate by a quarter-point to 6.75 percent, all 26
economists in the survey said. It may boost the reverse
repurchase rate to 5.75 percent from 5.5 percent, according to
25 of 26 forecasts, with one predicting no change. The RBI is
due to announce the decision on its  website  at noon in Mumbai.  India’s inflation unexpectedly quickened to 8.31 percent in
February. Price gains in the South Asian nation are still
“sticky” and high, and the central bank may increase borrowing
costs in the near future, Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services
said yesterday.  Governor Duvvuri Subbarao on Jan. 25 raised rates for the
seventh time in a year and pledged to persist with an “anti-
inflationary monetary stance.” The RBI aims to keep inflation
in a range of 4 percent to 4.5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
