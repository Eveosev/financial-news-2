Sweden’s  house prices  rose from a
year earlier, supporting the central bank’s plans to continue
tightening monetary policy.  House prices rose 3 percent in the three months through
February from the same period a year earlier,  Statistics Sweden 
said in a statement on its website today. Property prices have
risen on an annual basis for 22 consecutive months. Prices were
unchanged from the previous three-month period, the office said.  The central bank has signaled credit-driven house-price
growth may prompt it to pick up the pace of monetary tightening
as it tries to steer the European Union’s fastest economic
rebound. The bank raised its benchmark rate a fifth time last
month, bringing it to 1.5 percent, and signaled more tightening
is to come.  The central bank “will hike four more times this year to
2.5 percent by the end of the year,” said Anna Raman, an
economist at Svenska Handelsbanken AB in  Stockholm . “It can’t
be excluded that they will increase it even more.”  The krona gained 0.1 percent against the euro to trade at
9.0148 at 12:28 p.m. in Stockholm. Against the dollar, the krona
gained 0.8 percent to 6.4327.  Sweden’s non-seasonally-adjusted jobless rate fell last
month to 7.9 percent from 8.2 percent, the office said in a
separate release today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
