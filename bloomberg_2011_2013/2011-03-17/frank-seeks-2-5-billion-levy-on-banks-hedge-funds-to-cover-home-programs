U.S. House Democrats are looking to  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) ,  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  and  Bank of
America Corp. (BAC)  to pick up the tab for housing programs targeted
by Republican budget cuts.  Representative  Barney Frank  of  Massachusetts , the top
Democrat on the Financial Services Committee, introduced a
measure today that would impose a $2.5 billion levy on financial
firms with more than $50 billion in assets and hedge fund
managers with more than $10 billion in assets. The money would
be collected through risk-based assessments.  Republicans have targeted four housing programs as they
attempt to cut back on federal spending, voting yesterday to
eliminate the Neighborhood Stabilization Program. They are also
scheduled to vote on eliminating the Obama administrationâ€™s
signature foreclosure-prevention effort, the Home Affordable
Modification Program.  Frank, as a member of the minority party, would need
Republicans to support the measure for it to move forward.  He proposed a similar levy last year to cover the cost of
the Dodd-Frank financial regulation law. That fee, which would
have raised $19 billion, was cut from the bill to gain the
support of Senator  Scott Brown , a Massachusetts Republican who
joined Democrats in passing the broader regulatory overhaul.  To contact the reporter on this story:
