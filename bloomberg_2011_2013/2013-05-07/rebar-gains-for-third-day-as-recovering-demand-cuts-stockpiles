Steel reinforcement-bar futures in
 China  rose for a third straight session after inventory
declined, boosting optimism that demand is strengthening as
property developers accelerate projects.  The contract for October delivery on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange rose as much as 1 percent to 3,658  yuan  ($593) a metric
ton, and traded 3,644 yuan a ton at 10:40 a.m. Beijing time.
Futures have advanced 2.9 percent after touching a five-month
low of 3,542 yuan on May 2.  Rebar  inventory  in China tracked by Shanghai Steelhome
Information Technology Co. fell to 9.23 million tons on May 3,
the lowest since Feb. 22. China’s efforts to implement more
property curbs have had limited impact, with March home prices
rising in the most cities tracked by the government since
September 2011, while housing sales jumped 69 percent in the
first quarter.  “Rebar inventory should drop faster now after the May 1
holiday, and the strong housing starts should sustain a rally in
the rest of the second quarter,” Wu Zhili, analyst at Shenhua
Futures Co., said by phone from Shenzhen.  The average  spot price  for rebar gained 0.3 percent to
3,581 yuan yesterday, according to the Beijing Antaike
Information Development Co. Spot  iron ore  at Tianjin port was
unchanged at $128.10 a dry ton, Steel Index Ltd. data show.  To contact  Bloomberg News  staff for this story:
