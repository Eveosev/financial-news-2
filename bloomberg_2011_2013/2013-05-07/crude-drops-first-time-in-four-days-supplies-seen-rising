West Texas Intermediate crude fell for
the first time in four days before government data that may show
U.S. stockpiles rose last week from an 82-year high.  Futures decreased 0.6 percent as supplies climbed by 2
million barrels in a Bloomberg survey ahead of an Energy
Information Administration report tomorrow that may also show
higher production and weaker demand. The U.S. cut its 2013 price
forecasts for both WTI and Brent crude in the EIA’s  Short-Term
Energy Outlook  today.  “High inventories and weak demand do not make a  bull
market ,” said  Michael Lynch , president of Strategic Energy &
Economic Research in Winchester,  Massachusetts .  WTI for June delivery slid 54 cents to settle at $95.62 a
barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . The volume of all
futures traded was 3.9 percent above the 100-day average for the
time of day at 3:27 p.m. in New York. Futures climbed to $96.16
yesterday, the highest close since April 2. Prices jumped 5.6
percent in the previous three sessions.  Prices were little changed after the  American Petroleum
Institute  reported that U.S. inventories rose 680,000 barrels to
389.1 million. The June contract slid 64 cents to $95.52 a
barrel in electronic trading at 4:33 p.m. The contract traded at
$95.45 before the report was released at 4:30 p.m.  Brent Slips  Brent for June settlement slipped $1.06, or 1.1 percent, to
end the session at $104.40 a barrel on the London-based ICE
Futures Europe exchange. Volume was 37 percent above the 100-day
average. U.K. businesses were closed yesterday for a public
holiday, and Brent trading volume was 44 percent below the
three-month average.  Brent’s premium to WTI narrowed to $8.78 a barrel, based on
settlement prices, from $9.30 yesterday.  U.S. crude stockpiles gained 0.5 percent last week to 397.3
million barrels, according to the Bloomberg survey before
tomorrow’s EIA weekly inventory report. That would put them at
the highest level since 1931. Eleven respondents forecast an
increase and one no change in inventories.  Oil “seems to be losing some momentum with expectations
that we are going to see another rise in crude inventories,”
said  Gene McGillian , an analyst and broker at Tradition Energy
in  Stamford ,  Connecticut .  Output Forecasts  U.S. oil  production , which climbed to the highest level
since 1992 in April, has exceeded 7 million barrels a day since
early February, according to the EIA, the Energy Department’s
statistical arm.  Gasoline demand  slumped 3.8 percent to 8.42
million barrels a day in the week ended April 26 and imports
rose 8 percent.  “It’s hard to maintain a strong rally when you are
concerned about demand and increasing supplies,” said  Phil Flynn , senior market analyst at the Price Futures Group in
 Chicago .  Oil production from outside of OPEC will rise 2.1 percent
from 2012 to 53.85 million barrels a day in 2013, led by gains
in the U.S. and  Canada , the EIA said today. The 2013 output
projection was up 80,000 barrels a day from April’s report. U.S.
output is projected to climb 7.9 percent this year.  The EIA also revised down its forecast for global fuel
demand for this year, to 89.93 million barrels a day from 90
million estimated last month.  WTI will average $93.17 a barrel this year, 75 cents below
the April estimate, the EIA said in the monthly report. The
Brent outlook was $105.89, down from $107.96 last month. Based
on those prices, the WTI-Brent spread would average $12.72,
narrower than last month’s $14.04 estimate and the year-to-date
average of $15.93.  North Sea  The Brent-WTI premium will widen to $10 to $15 a barrel in
the third quarter, amid “upward pressure” on Brent and a
“neutral to bearish” forecast for WTI, according to a report
dated yesterday by  Michael Wittner , the head of oil-market
research at Societe General SA in New York.  Daily shipments of the four  North Sea  crude grades that
make up the Dated Brent benchmark will drop to an eight-month
low in June as maintenance curtails production at oilfields in
the Ekofisk system, according to loading programs obtained by
Bloomberg today. That may strengthen the Brent side of the WTI-
Brent spread as WTI weakens.  The WTI-Brent spread shrank to $8.58 a barrel on May 3 from
$23.18 on Feb. 8, based on settlement prices, amid expectations
of an inventory drop in Cushing,  Oklahoma , the delivery point
for Nymex futures.  Ozark Pipeline  Enbridge Inc. (ENB)  said yesterday it will shut the Ozark
pipeline to Wood River,  Illinois , from Cushing for 10 days
starting June 10 for planned maintenance, said Larry Springer, a
company spokesman in Houston. The line has the capacity to move
215,000 barrels a day of crude.  Prices also fell as  Saudi Arabia  pumped the most in five
months in April, a person with knowledge of its output said. the
world’s largest crude exporter pumped 9.32 million barrels a day
in April, about 180,000 barrels more than in March, the person
said, declining to be identified because the information is
confidential. Output last month was the most since November,
when the kingdom pumped 9.49 million barrels a day, oil ministry
data showed.  Saudi Arabia is the largest producer in the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries.  Implied volatility for at-the-money WTI options expiring in
June was 21.7 percent at 3:27 p.m., down from 23 percent
yesterday, data compiled by Bloomberg showed.  Electronic trading volume on the Nymex was 508,636
contracts as of 4:34 p.m. It totaled 645,120 contracts
yesterday, 10 percent above the three-month average. Open
interest was 1.78 million contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
