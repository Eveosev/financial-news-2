Delaware became the 11th state to
recognize  same-sex marriages  after its Senate voted 12-9 to
legalize gay weddings and to convert civil unions to marriages.
Governor Jack Markell signed the bill into law, according to a
statement from his office.  Delaware joined 10  states  and  Washington , D.C., in allowing
same-sex marriage, including three where voters authorized it
last year, according to the Washington-based Human Rights
Campaign. Last week, Rhode Island Governor Lincoln Chafee, an
independent, signed a bill authorizing gay weddings there.  “Today, we wrote a new chapter in our history and proved,
once again, justice and equality continue to move forward in
Delaware,” Markell, a 52-year-old Democrat, said in the
statement.  The Civil Marriage Equality and Religious Freedom Act of
2013 take effect July 1, the governor said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
