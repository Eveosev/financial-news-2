Hertz Global Holdings Inc. (HTZ) , the
largest publicly traded U.S. auto-rental chain, said it will
move its headquarters to Florida from  New Jersey  following its
acquisition of Dollar Thrifty Automotive Group.  Hertz is relocating its home base to Estero, Florida, from
Park Ridge, New Jersey, according to a statement. Dollar
Thrifty, acquired in November, is based in Tulsa,  Oklahoma .  As many as 700 jobs will be moved to Florida over a two-
year period while more than 2,000 Hertz and Dollar Thrifty
personnel will remain in New Jersey, the company said. That
figure includes about 150 employees who work in Park Ridge. The
move is scheduled to be completed in early 2015.  Hertz acquired Dollar Thrifty for $2.6 billion to solidify
its position as the second-largest U.S. rental-car chain behind
closely held Enterprise Holdings Inc.  Avis Budget Group Inc. (CAR)  is
the third largest.  U.S. antitrust regulators are investigating whether
 Macquarie Group Ltd. (MQG) ’s private-equity arm violated a consent
decree allowing it to buy the Advantage rental car brand from
Hertz, two people familiar with the matter have said.  Macquarie, in a joint venture with  Franchise Services of
North America Inc. (FSN) , acquired Advantage under a Nov. 15 agreement
with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission that let Hertz buy Dollar
Thrifty.  Hertz fell 0.6 percent to $24.81 at the close in New York.
The shares have gained 52 percent this year compared with the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index’s 14 percent increase.  To contact the reporter on this story:
