The  Topix Index (TPX)  climbed the most in a
month, erasing losses from the 2008 collapse of Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc., as Japanese markets reopened from a holiday
during which the yen slid and U.S. jobs data beat estimates.  Sony Corp. (6758) ,  Japan ’s No. 1 exporter of consumer electronics,
rose 6.4 percent.  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  added 4.9 percent after the
Nikkei newspaper reported the carmaker will beat profit
estimates when it posts results tomorrow. Japan Steel Works
Ltd., which forges reactor containment vessels, surged 16
percent after Japan won its first nuclear plant order since the
Fukushima meltdowns.  The Topix rose 3.1 percent to close in  Tokyo  at 1,188.57, a
level not seen since before Lehman filed for  bankruptcy
protection  on Sept. 15, 2008. Japan’s broadest gauge of equities
has rallied 65 percent since mid-November, making it the world’s
best-performing major stock index, as the yen weakened amid
optimism a change in government and central bank leadership will
pull Japan out of deflation.  “We saw solid U.S. jobs data even though the market was
nervous about downside risks, and that’s boosting stock
buying,” said Isao Kubo, a Tokyo-based equity strategist at
Nissay Asset Management Corp., which oversees about 5 trillion
yen ($50.5 billion.) “As the yen has weakened, corporate
forecasts suggest profits are going to improve a lot this year.
The market likes that.”  After a record earthquake and tsunami, nuclear meltdowns
and a surge in the yen, Japan is the last of the five biggest
equity markets to recover to pre-crisis levels. Topix  industry
groups  tracking consumer lenders and real estate companies led
the recovery from the March 2009 bottom following Lehman’s
collapse, almost quadrupling.  Nikkei 225  The  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  today climbed 3.6 percent to
14,180.24, closing above 14,000 for the first time since June
2008. The exporter-heavy gauge recouped its losses from the
Lehman shock on March 9.  Hino Motors Ltd., a truckmaker majority owned by Toyota,
climbed 675 percent to lead rebounding shares on the Nikkei 225
since the depths of the financial crisis. Tokyu Land Corp.
jumped about 470 percent. Softbank Corp., the mobile-phone
carrier headed by billionaire Masayoshi Son, increased almost
330 percent.  Futures of the  S&P 500 index  lost 0.1 percent today after
the measure yesterday extended its record level following data
last week that showed U.S. employers added more workers than
forecast in April.  Earnings Season  Of the 284 companies on the Topix that have reported  full-
year earnings  since April 1, and for which Bloomberg has
estimates, 162 beat projections. Toyota and Hitachi Ltd. are
among almost 700 companies on the measure scheduled to report
earnings this week, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Bank of America Merrill Lynch raised its 12-month target
for the Topix from 1,250 to 1,350, about 14 percent above
today’s level. If the yen were to slide to 120 per dollar, the
index could rise to 1,450, the brokerage said.  The yen is trading at 99.01 per dollar after weakening
about 2 percent in the past three trading sessions.  Japanese exporters rallied. Sony gained 6.4 percent to
1,731 yen and Taiyo Yuden Co., a maker of capacitors for
televisions and smartphones that makes 76 percent of its sales
outside Japan, surged 9.2 percent to 1,502 yen.  Komatsu Ltd. (6301) ,
Japan’s largest construction machinery maker, rose 4.2 percent
to 2,613 yen.  Japan Steel  Toyota advanced 4.9 percent to 5,760 yen, the highest since
February 2008. The Nikkei newspaper said a weaker yen and
improving overseas sales will help the world’s biggest carmaker
post full-year operating profit of about 1.3 trillion yen,
beating the mean analyst estimate of 1.24 trillion yen.  Japan Steel Works soared 16 percent to 579 yen, the biggest
advance since October 2008, after  Mitsubishi Heavy (7011)  Industries
Ltd. and Areva SA of  France  signed a $22 billion agreement on
May 3 to build a nuclear power plant in  Turkey . Mitsubishi Heavy
added 4.9 percent to 684 yen.  Mitsui & Co. (8031) , Japan’s second-biggest trading house, gained
4.3 percent to 1,374 yen after projecting a dividend of 51 yen
per share, up 8 yen from a year earlier.  The Nikkei Stock Average Volatility Index added 2.5 percent
to 24.80, indicating traders expect a swing of about 7.1 percent
on the benchmark gauge during the next 30 days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
