Empresa Nacional de Telecomunicaciones
SA ,  Chile ’s second-largest mobile telephone operator, rose to a
four-week high after reporting first-quarter earnings that
surpassed some analyst estimates.  Entel, as the company is also known, advanced 2.5 percent
to 9,383.6 pesos at the close of trading in Santiago, the
biggest gain since April 23. The  Ipsa (IPSA)  index rose 0.3 percent.  First-quarter net income was 37.2 billion pesos ($79.1
million) and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization was 124 billion pesos, Entel said after the close
of trading yesterday. Net income fell from 52.5 billion pesos a
year ago as a result of a change in the accounting method for
mobile postpaid handhelds, according to a  filing  posted on the
website of Chile’s securities regulator.  Banco Santander SA had expected Ebitda of 113 billion pesos
and profit of 30.1 billion pesos, while  Banco de Chile (CHILE)  said in a
note today that Ebitda was higher than expected, without
providing its own estimate.  “We believe results will likely have a positive impact on
the stock,” Santander analysts Nicolas Khaliliyeh and Francisco Errandonea wrote in a note today. “Moreover, the stock’s recent
weakness due to its acquisition of Nextel Peru should be viewed
as a buying opportunity.”  Entel said April 4 that it agreed to buy Nextel Peru for
$400 million. The stock has fallen 4.2 percent since then.  To contact the reporter on this story:
