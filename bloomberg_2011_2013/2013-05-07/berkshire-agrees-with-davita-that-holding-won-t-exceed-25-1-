Warren Buffett ’s  Berkshire Hathaway
Inc. (BRK/A) , the largest investor in dialysis provider  DaVita
HealthCare Partners Inc. (DVA) , agreed not to acquire more than 25
percent of the company.  The so-called standstill agreement was disclosed today in a
regulatory filing by Denver-based DaVita. Such accords are
typically arranged by companies seeking to prevent an
unsolicited takeover.  Berkshire held almost 15 million DaVita shares, a stake of
about 14 percent, according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg based
on a March filing. The stake is valued at more than $1.7
billion, based on DaVita’s closing price of $117.56 today.  Under the agreement, which applies when Berkshire’s stake
is 15 percent or more, Buffett’s company will refrain from
proposing “any business combination, merger, tender offer,
exchange offer or similar transaction,” according to a document
included in the filing.  The agreement was signed by DaVita President Javier Rodriguez and Ted Weschler, the former hedge fund manager hired
by Buffett to help run Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire’s
investment portfolio.  Buffett didn’t respond to a request for comment sent to an
assistant. Skip Thurman, a spokesman for DaVita, didn’t respond
to phone calls seeking comment  Peter Grauer, chairman of Bloomberg LP, the parent
company of Bloomberg News, has served on DaVita’s board of
directors since 1994.  To contact the reporter on this story:
