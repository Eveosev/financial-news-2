Live Nation Entertainment Inc. (LYV) , the
world’s biggest concert promoter and ticket seller, said first-
quarter sales climbed on higher revenue from events, sponsorship
and advertising.  Sales increased 6.4 percent to $923.7 million, the  Beverly
Hills , California-based company said in a statement yesterday.
That exceeded the $920.2 million average of five analysts’
estimates, according to data  compiled  by Bloomberg.  The company reported a net loss of $63.2 million, or 33
cents a share,  compared  with a loss of $69.2 million, or 37
cents, a year earlier, beating the average analyst estimate for
a 36-cent loss.  Live Nation is redesigning its Ticketmaster unit to boost
revenue and wring more profit from ticketing, as well as moving
to reduce money-losing concerts. The results are the first for
the company after the exit of former Chairman Irving Azoff, who
was replaced in March with Greg Maffei, president and CEO of
Live Nation’s biggest shareholder,  Liberty Media Corp. (LMCA)   The number of worldwide events hosted by Live Nation
increased 1.6 percent to 4,880, while attendance climbed 12
percent to 8.1 million, according to the statement.  “This is a great attendance figure,” Chief Operating
Officer Joe Berchtold said in an interview yesterday. “We’re
driving more attendance for each show.”  ‘Growth Drivers’  Adjusted operating income rose to $52.9 million from $48.2
million, missing the $53.9 million average analyst estimate. It
excludes acquisition costs, asset sales, depreciation,
amortization and stock-based compensation.  Live Nation expects sponsorship and advertising “to
continue to be one of its primary growth drivers” and forecast
an increase in full-year adjusted operating income to be in
“the high-single to low-double digits, consistent with the past
few years,” it  said  in a separate statement.  The company will increase market share in concerts and
ticketing by about 5 million tickets between 2012 and 2015, and
expects to deliver over half of that growth this year, Chief
Executive Officer Michael Rapino said on a conference call
yesterday.  Live Nation shares gained 2.2 percent to $13.23 at the
close in  New York  yesterday, and have  increased  42 percent this
year.  Adjusted operating profit from the sponsorship and
advertising division rose 15 percent to $23.8 million as the
unit’s revenue increased 11 percent to $40.1 million.  New Business  Ticketing profit fell 18 percent to $59.6 million as
revenue was little changed at $325.1 million. The number of
tickets the company handled fell 2.6 percent to 35.7 million, as
some big concert tours went on sale earlier in the year,
Berchtold said on the call.  Concerts lost $13.1 million, compared with a loss of $25
million a year earlier, as revenue climbed 14 percent to $513.5
million.  Azoff stepped down in December to start a new business
representing artists including the Eagles and other acts he
managed for the company’s Artist Nation unit. In the quarter,
that unit lost $1.1 million, compared with a loss of $3 million
a year earlier, as revenue slid 18 percent to $50.3 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
