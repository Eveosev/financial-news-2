Air Arabia PJSC (AIRARABI)  surged to the highest
level in more than three years on investor optimism the  Middle
East ’s biggest no-frills airline will benefit from Dubai’s
tourism recovery.  The stock jumped 4.1 percent to 1.04 dirhams, the highest
close since March 2010. That brought the surge this quarter to
34 percent. About 50.8 million shares traded, or 2.7 times the
three-month daily average, making the stock the  fourth-most
traded  on the benchmark DFM General Index. The measure was
little changed.  Dubai plans to double the number of visitors to 20 million
by 2020 and triple annual revenue from the industry to 300
billion dirhams ($82 billion), the government said. Air Arabia
said last month  first-quarter  passenger traffic climbed 17.5
percent to a record 1.45 million. The carrier will take delivery
of 10 planes next year and is looking into raising funds in 2014
for the aircrafts, Chief Executive Officer Adel Ali said in an
interview today.  “Air Arabia is benefiting from the recovery in the tourism
activity in Dubai,” said Walid Mourad, Dubai-based  fund manager 
at ING Investment Management Middle East Ltd. “Their average
revenue per passenger and load factor have been improving
significantly.”  The company last year started flights to nine additional
destinations from its hub in Sharjah,  United Arab Emirates . That
helped boost passenger numbers by 13 percent to 5.3 million in
2012 and profit by 56 percent. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. raised
its price estimate for the airline in February to 1.14 dirhams.  Five analysts recommend investors buy the shares, according
to  data  compiled by Bloomberg. Six have a hold rating on the
stock and one advises selling it, the data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
