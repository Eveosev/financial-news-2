The European Union will back  Mexico ’s
Herminio Blanco over Brazil’s Roberto Azevedo to become the next
head of the  World Trade Organization , Bloomberg BNA reported,
citing officials following the process.  Representatives of the 27-nation EU met in Brussels
yesterday and agreed to vote on their choice after failing to
reach a consensus decision on whether to recommend Blanco or
Azevedo to the WTO selection committee.  The members agreed that the EU candidate would be the one
getting the most votes. Two rounds of voting yielded the same
result: 15 member states preferring the Mexican Blanco and 12
the Brazilian Azevedo, according to the officials.  France and the U.K. have been the main supporters for
Blanco, a former Mexican trade minister who served as his
country’s chief negotiator in the  North American Free Trade
Agreement . The European Commission has lobbied for Azevedo, who
currently serves as Brazil’s ambassador to the WTO.  To contact the reporter on this story:
