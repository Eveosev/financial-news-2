EOG Resources Inc. (EOG) , the oil producer
with the most acreage in  Texas ’ Eagle Ford Shale, rose the most
in nine months after first-quarter profit beat analysts’
estimates by 52 percent.  EOG, based in Houston,  increased  7.7 percent to $135.69 at
the close in  New York , the biggest gain since Aug. 3. The shares
have climbed 12 percent this year.  Excluding gains on asset sales and losses from commodity
contracts, per-share profit was $1.80, 62 cents higher than the
average of 32 estimates  compiled  by Bloomberg. First-quarter net
income rose 53 percent to $494.7 million, or $1.82 a share, from
$324 million, or $1.20, a year earlier, EOG said in a statement
after markets closed yesterday.  “EOG leads its peers in organic production growth and
financial flexibility,”  Fadel Gheit , a New York-based analyst
for Oppenheimer & Co., wrote today in a note to clients. “The
company continues to optimize drilling of its core plays while
expanding into new areas in the Permian and Williston basins.”  Oppenheimer rates the shares equivalent to a buy and Gheit
doesn’t own them.  To contact the reporter on this story:
