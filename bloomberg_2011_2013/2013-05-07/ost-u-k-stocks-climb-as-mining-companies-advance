U.K. stocks  rose, with the FTSE 100
Index reaching its highest level in more than five years, as
commodity producers advanced and Britain’s equity markets
reopened following a public holiday.  HSBC Holdings Plc gained 3 percent after  Europe ’s largest
bank said first-quarter profit almost doubled. BHP Billiton Ltd.
and Rio Tinto Group climbed more than 1.5 percent, dragging  U.K.
mining companies  higher. G4S Plc plunged 15 percent as the
security provider predicted that operating margin will continue
to narrow this year after dropping in the first quarter.  The FTSE 100 added 35.84 points, or 0.6 percent, to
6,557.30 at the close in  London , its highest level since
December 2007. The equity benchmark completed an 11-month rally
in April, its longest stretch of gains since the index started
in 1984. The broader FTSE All-Share Index increased 0.5 percent
today, while Ireland’s ISEQ Index rose 0.9 percent.  “Now the market buys any dip, and it looks like it’s
pricing equities as the only asset class that can give us a
decent return in this low interest-rate environment,” Otto Waser, chief investment officer at R&A Research & Asset
Management AG in Zurich, told Mark Barton on Bloomberg
Television. “This re-pricing is just not over.”  The Bank of England will probably leave its stimulus
program on hold this week after the economy avoided a triple-dip
recession in the first three months of the year. Policy makers
will not expand quantitative easing beyond 375 billion pounds
($580 billion) when they meet on May 9, according to a Bloomberg
News  survey of economists .  Volumes Increase  The number of shares changing hands in FTSE 100-listed
companies was 20 percent greater than the average of the past 30
days, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  HSBC, the  heaviest  stock on the  FTSE 100 (UKX) , rose 3 percent to
735 pence. Pretax profit increased to $8.43 billion in the first
quarter, from $4.32 billion the year before as bad loan charges
and operating costs declined. That beat the $8.04 billion that
analysts had predicted.  An index of U.K. lenders advanced the most in 12 weeks as
Barclays Plc climbed 3.8 percent to 307.40 pence and Standard
Chartered Plc gained 2.6 percent to 1,700 pence. Lloyds Banking
Group Plc added 2.1 percent to 55.19 pence, its highest price in
more than 10 weeks.  A gauge of London-listed  commodity producers  posted its
biggest three-day rally since October, paring its decline this
year to 12 percent. BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto, the world’s two
largest mining companies, added 1.9 percent to 1,883 pence and
1.7 percent to 3,072.5 pence, respectively.  G4S Tumbles  G4S slumped 15 percent to 260 pence, its biggest plunge
since October 2011, after saying that its operating margin
narrowed by 0.6 percentage points in the first quarter.  “Group margins are expected to continue to be impacted
adversely in the short term,” G4S said in a statement.  Prudential Plc (PRU) , the U.K.’s biggest insurer, lost 0.9
percent to 1,145 pence. The company said that the profit margin
on new business at its U.S. unit narrowed to 54 percent of the
annual premium equivalent in the first quarter, from 64 percent
a year earlier. The annual premium equivalent is calculated as
all the regular payments plus 10 percent of any lump-sum
payments that the insurer received during the reporting period.
The shares have still  rallied 33 percent  so far this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
