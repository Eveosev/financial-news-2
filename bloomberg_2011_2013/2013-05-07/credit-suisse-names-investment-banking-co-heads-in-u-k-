Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) , Switzerlandâ€™s
second-largest bank, named Charles Donald and Jonathan Grundy as
co-heads of U.K. investment banking, replacing Sebastian Grigg.  Grigg will become a vice chairman of European, Middle East
and Africa investment banking at Credit Suisse, the bank said in
memos to employees. A spokeswoman for Credit Suisse in London
confirmed the contents of the memos today.  The bank has been reshuffling senior bankers in  Europe  and
on May 1 named Marisa Drew and Ewen Stevenson as co-heads of the
European investment-banking business to replace Jamie Welch, who
will join Dallas-based Energy Transfer Partners LP. Donald
joined Credit Suisse from  Nomura Holdings Inc. (8604)  in 2010, while
Grundy, who had previously worked at Merrill Lynch & Co. and
 Morgan Stanley (MS) , joined in 2009.  Credit Suisse posted a jump in first-quarter  profit  last
month on lower costs and improved earnings at the securities
unit. Revenue from underwriting and advisory at the Zurich-based
bank rose 3.4 percent to 763 million francs ($811 million), as
increases in debt and equity underwriting were partially offset
by lower fees from mergers and acquisitions.  Financial News reported the moves earlier today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
