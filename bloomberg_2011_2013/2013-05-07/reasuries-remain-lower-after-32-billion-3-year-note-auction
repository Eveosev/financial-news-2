Treasuries fell, pushing the 10-year
note yield higher for a third day, as the government received
lower-than-average demand at the auction of $32 billion of
three-year notes.  The  bid-to-cover  ratio, which gauges demand by comparing
total bids with the amount of securities offered, was 3.38,
compared with an average of 3.57 for the past 10 sales. The U.S.
will sell $24 billion of 10-year debt tomorrow and $16 billion
of 30-year bonds on May 9. Bidding has slowed at Treasury
auctions this year with the economy showing signs of recovery.  “The 10- and 30-year bond auctions will be the big drivers
for the tone the rest of the week,” said Tom Simons, an
economist in New York at Jefferies LLC, one of the 21 primary
dealers that bid on U.S. debt auctions. “The big question will
be have they cheapened up enough? We are near important
psychological levels in the long end.”  The U.S. 10-year note  yield  climbed two basis points, or
0.02 percentage point, to 1.78 percent at 5 p.m. in  New York ,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 2 percent
security due in February 2023 fell 5/32, or $1.56 per $1,000
face amount, to 101 31/32.  The yield climbed to the highest since April 12 and traded
above its 200-day moving average for a second day, an indication
it may rise.  The  yield  on the current three-year note rose one basis
point to 0.34 percent. Two-year note yields increased one basis
point to 0.22 percent.  Auctions Detail  Bidding has slowed at Treasury auctions this year, with the
$753 billion in debt sales attracting an average of $3.02 in
orders to buy per dollar of debt sold, compared with a record
$3.15 in 2012, according to data released by the Treasury and
compiled by Bloomberg.  The 10-year note sale on April 10 drew a bid-to-cover ratio
of 2.79, versus an average of 2.92 for the past 10 sales.  The three-year debt drew a yield of 0.354 percent, compared
with a forecast of 0.355 percent in a Bloomberg News survey of
eight of the  Federal Reserve ’s 21 primary dealers.  “Three-year notes are yielding more than two-year notes,
so there is demand,” Simons said. “The three-year sector is
pretty stable, given the Fed’s stance on easing and the safety
bid.”  Indirect bidders, an investor class that includes foreign
central banks, purchased 30.7 percent of the notes, the most
since September and compared with an average of 25.8 percent for
the past 10 sales.  Direct bidders, non-primary-dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, purchased 14.6 percent of
the notes at the sale, the least since September and compared
with an average of 19.5 percent for the past 10 auctions.  Bond Returns  Treasury three-year notes have handed investors a gain of
0.2 percent this year, compared with an increase of 0.6 percent
in 2012, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes. The
broader Treasuries market has gained 0.3 percent this year after
gain of 2.2 percent last year.  The sales this week will raise $12.4 billion of new cash,
as maturing securities held by the public total $59.6 billion,
according to the Treasury.  Yields surged last week, with the 10-year rising 11 basis
points, as stronger-than-forecast jobs data increased optimism
that the  U.S. economy  is gathering pace.  “After the employment number, we didn’t have any real
retracement in prices, which means rates were probably too
low,” said Paul Horrmann, a broker in New York at Tradition
Asiel Securities Inc., an interdealer broker.  The 10-year term premium, a model that includes
expectations for  interest rates , growth and inflation, was at
minus 0.73 percent, the closest to zero since April 2. A
negative reading indicates investors are willing to accept
yields below what’s considered fair value.  Treasuries have fallen 0.5 percent this month as of
yesterday, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes.
The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  returned  1.3 percent including
reinvested dividends, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
