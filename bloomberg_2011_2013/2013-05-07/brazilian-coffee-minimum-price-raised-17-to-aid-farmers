Brazil , the world’s biggest coffee
producer and exporter, raised the minimum domestic price for the
arabica variety by 17 percent to help increase income for
farmers after international prices slumped.  The benchmark price for government purchases of the
commodity was raised to 307 reais ($153) per 60-kilogram (132-
pound) bag, from 261.69 reais, the  Agriculture Ministry  said on
its website today. The ministry will also propose 3.1 billion
reais of loans for coffee growers and roasters.  “This measure is very important, but is only a first
step,” Silas Brasileiro, head of the country’s National Coffee
Council, said in an interview from Brasilia. “The government is
signaling that it will take more measures to help producers,
such as auctions or measures to compensate sales below minimum
price.”  Futures for the mild-tasting arabica beans have declined 18
percent in  New York  in the past 12 months after Brazil reaped a
record crop in 2012 and is set to almost match the amount this
year. Arabica for for July delivery rose 0.7 percent to $1.427 a
pound on ICE Futures U.S. in New York.  Brazilian coffee producers will harvest between 47 million
bags and 50.2 million this year, approaching last year’s record
50.8 million bags, the government said in January.  To contact the reporter on this story:
