German stocks  advanced, pushing the
benchmark DAX Index to an all-time high, as  Allianz SE (ALV)  and
 Commerzbank AG (CBK)  posted quarterly earnings and as factory orders
in Europe’s largest economy unexpectedly increased.  Allianz rose to the highest price since May 2008 after
first-quarter operating profit beat analysts’ forecasts.
Commerzbank gained 2.6 percent after reporting a loss that was
narrower than estimated.  Stada Arzneimittel AG (SAZ)  jumped the most
in almost 18 months after posting sales that beat projections.  The DAX climbed 0.9 percent to a record level of 8,181.78
at the close in  Frankfurt . The gauge rallied 3.9 percent last
week as the  European Central Bank  cut its  interest rates  and the
U.S. jobless rate unexpectedly dropped. The broader HDAX Index
added 0.8 percent to its highest-ever level.  “German stocks are rallying to record highs as there’s
still liquidity fueling the markets and we’ve seen relatively
sound macro data,” said Matthias Jasper, head of equities at
WGZ Bank AG in Dusseldorf, Germany. “Today, we’ve also seen
positive data from corporates like Allianz. People should stay
invested in equities and look for further increases. I expect a
pretty strong rally in the second half.”  The volume of shares changing hands in companies listed on
the DAX was 27 percent lower than the average of the past 30
days, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Factory Orders  German  factory orders , adjusted for seasonal swings and
inflation, increased 2.2 percent in March, following a 2.2
percent gain a month earlier, the Economy Ministry in Berlin
said. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg had forecast on average a
drop of 0.5 percent.  The  Reserve Bank  of  Australia  cut its  benchmark interest
rate  to a record low of 2.75 percent. Eight of 29 economists in
a Bloomberg survey had predicted the seventh cut in the past 19
months.  Allianz added 3.6 percent to 120.70 euros after saying
first-quarter operating profit increased 20 percent to 2.80
billion euros ($3.67 billion). Europe’s biggest insurer also
said it is on course to meet its 2013 forecast.  “The start to this year can be described as truly
successful,” Chief Executive Officer Michael Diekmann said in a
statement.  Bank Shares  Commerzbank rose 2.6 percent to 11.09 euros after Germany’s
second-biggest lender reported a first-quarter net loss of 94
million euros. Analysts on average had forecast a loss of 153.7
million euros.  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) , the country’s largest bank, climbed 1.5
percent to 37.13 euros. A gauge of banking shares was the best
performer among the 19 industry groups in the Stoxx Europe 600
Index today.  Stada Arzneimittel jumped 9.1 percent to 32.63 euros, the
biggest increase since November 2011, after Germany’s biggest
publicly traded maker of generic drugs reported first-quarter
sales that beat estimates and confirmed its earnings forecasts
for 2013 and 2014.  Hochtief AG jumped 5.9 percent to 56.51 euros, the highest
price since July 2011. Germany’s largest construction company
said it expects full-year net income of 180 million euros to 220
million euros, compared with a previous forecast of 174 million
euros to 190 million euros.  Separately, the builder agreed to sell its airport division
to Public Sector Pension Investment Board of  Canada  for about
1.5 billion euros.  HeidelbergCement AG (HEI)  rallied 3.5 percent to 56.03 euros as
French peer Lafarge SA reiterated its full-year forecast.  “We expect to see cement demand growth in our markets of
between 1 percent and 4 percent in 2013,” Lafarge’s Chief
Executive Officer Bruno Lafont said in a statement.  Hannover Re  slid 1.9 percent to 63 euros after the world’s
fourth-biggest reinsurer said first-quarter profit fell 15
percent to 221.4 million euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
