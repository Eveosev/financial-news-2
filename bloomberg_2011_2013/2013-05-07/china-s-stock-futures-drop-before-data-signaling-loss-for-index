China’s stocks  rose for a third day
before the release of trade data tomorrow, as gains by consumer
staples producers and property developers overshadowed losses by
drug and technology companies.  Liquor maker Kweichow Moutai Co. surged the most in eight
months as valuations at 77 percent below the three-year average
lured buyers. Pang Da Automobile Trade Co. climbed 8.2 percent
after Citic Securities Co. rated the stock outperform. Kangmei
Pharmaceutical Co. snapped its longest stretch of gains since
March, while  Goertek Inc. (002241) , a supplier to Apple Inc., halted an
18 percent advance in the previous three days. Data may show
that exports grew 9.1 percent in April, the slowest in five
months, according to a Bloomberg survey of economists.  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  rose 0.2 percent to 2,235.57
at the close, after changing directions at least 49 times. Five
shares climbed for every four that fell on the measure, with
trading volumes down 3.8 percent from the 30-day average. The
CSI 300 Index added 0.2 percent to 2,529.94.  “The volume isn’t great enough to continue the gains we
have had so far in May -- at least not the kind we saw in the
past two sessions” when the  Shanghai  index rose more than 1
percent, Zhou Lin, an analyst at Huatai Securities Co., said by
phone from Nanjing. “Investors don’t expect too much from the
data over the next two days. They have come to terms the economy
isn’t going to recover as fast as expected.”  The Shanghai Composite has slumped 7.9 percent from a Feb.
6 high on concern slowing economic growth is hurting  earnings .
 China ’s manufacturing missed forecasts in April while the
services industry expanded at the slowest pace since August
2011, according to official surveys. The stocks measure trades
at 9.2 times estimated earnings, compared with the seven-year
average of 15.7, according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg.  Consumer Valuations  Consumer-staple stocks rose 1.4 percent, the biggest gain
on the CSI 300 after utilities. Kweichow Moutai, the largest
producer of baijiu liquor, jumped 5.6 percent to 187.69  yuan ,
the most since Sept. 4. The stock trades at 10.8 times estimated
profit, compared with the three-year average of 19.1. Wuliange
Yibin Co., the second-largest, surged 2.6 percent to 22.87 yuan.  Pang Da surged 8.2 percent to 5.83 yuan, the biggest
advance since Feb. 20. Citic Securities rated the stock
outperform, saying auto dealers’ business environment will
improve this year as growth in auto sales will accelerate to
over 10 percent.  Property stocks  led gains in the Shanghai index, with China
Vanke Co., the biggest developer, surging 2.3 percent to 11.58
yuan after yesterday reporting contract sales of 12.4 billion
yuan for April. Gemdale Corp. rose 1.4 percent to 7.43 yuan.  ‘Reset Expectations’  A gauge of technology stocks on the CSI 300 slid 1.1
percent, the most among 10 industry groups. Goertek fell 1
percent to 57.62 yuan. Kangmei led losses for drugmakers,
falling 1.8 percent to 17.76 yuan.  Chinese imports probably rose 13 percent in April, less
than the previous month’s 14 percent, tomorrow’s data will show.
Shipments abroad gained 10 percent in March. An “astounding”
92.9 percent jump in exports to  Hong Kong , the most in 18 years,
raises questions on data quality, researcher IHS Inc. said.  “The April data could show if growth has accelerated in
the current quarter and whether speculative capital inflows have
ended,”  Alaistair Chan , a Sydney-based economist for Moody’s
Analytics, wrote in a report. “The mismatch between reported
exports and reality explains some of the downside surprise in
China’s first-quarter GDP numbers. April’s trade numbers could
reset expectations.”  Yuan Plan  The government is due to report inflation data on May 9.
Consumer prices gained 2.3 percent from a year earlier in April,
below a government assumption for 2013 of 3.5 percent, following
a 2.1 percent advance in March, according to the median estimate
of economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  The yuan strengthened, rebounding following its biggest
loss of 2013, as Premier  Li Keqiang  pledged to come up with a
plan this year that would allow investment capital to move more
freely in and out of China.  The proposal, part of the government efforts to loosen
control over the currency and interest rates, will include a
mechanism enabling individuals to invest overseas, the nation’s
Cabinet said yesterday. The yuan rose 0.2 percent to 6.1537 per
dollar as of 4:02 p.m. in Shanghai, according to the China
Foreign Exchange Trade System.  The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  advanced 0.3 percent
today. The Bloomberg China-US 55 Index added 0.8 percent in  New
York  yesterday, while the  iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund (FXI) 
climbed 0.5 percent.  -- Editors: Allen Wan, Chan Tien Hin  To contact the reporter on this story:
