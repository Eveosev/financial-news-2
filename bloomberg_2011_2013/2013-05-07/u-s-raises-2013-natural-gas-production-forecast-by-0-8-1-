The U.S. raised its natural-gas
production outlook for 2013 for the first time in three months
amid gains from onshore wells.  Marketed gas production will average a record 69.90 billion
cubic feet a day this year, up from 69.33 billion estimated in
April, the Energy Information Administration said in its monthly
 Short-Term Energy Outlook , released today in  Washington . Output
will rise to an all-time high for the sixth straight year as new
wells come online at shale formations, such as the Marcellus in
the Northeast, government data show.  Gas prices  at the benchmark Henry Hub in Erath,  Louisiana ,
will average $3.80 per million British thermal units, higher
than the previous estimate of $3.52, according to the report
from the EIA, the Energy Department’s statistical arm. The
average may slump to $3.77 in the third quarter before climbing
to $3.92 during the final three months of the year.  “The Henry Hub spot price averaged $4.17 per million Btu
in April, the highest monthly average price since July 2011,”
the EIA said. “ Henry Hub  spot prices will fall through
September as natural gas markets loosen with lower summer
demand. Going into the summer, EIA expects production to be
slightly higher than last year’s levels, while summer electric
power demand is projected to be lower than last year’s record-
high levels.”  Gas output in the lower 48 states will average 64.77
billion cubic feet a day, up from last month’s estimate of 64.25
billion. The forecast for total gas consumption fell to 70.17
billion cubic feet a day from 70.28 billion.  Electricity Generation  Demand for gas from power plants will average 22.78 billion
cubic feet a day this year, lower than the previous estimate of
22.95 billion. The estimate for daily industrial usage increased
0.8 percent to 19.79 billion cubic feet from 19.61 billion in
April’s report.  LNG imports will average 410 million cubic feet a day this
year, down from 450 million in the April forecast. The EIA said
it expects LNG imports “to remain at minimal levels of less”
of less than 500 million cubic feet a day through 2014.  Gas inventories at the end of October will total 3.796
trillion cubic feet, down 134 billion from the same time last
year, according to the report. The number was revised up from
3.973 trillion the previous month.  Natural gas for June delivery fell 7.6 cents, or 1.9
percent, to $3.935 per million Btu at 12:59 p.m. on the  New York 
Mercantile Exchange. Prices have gained 17 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
