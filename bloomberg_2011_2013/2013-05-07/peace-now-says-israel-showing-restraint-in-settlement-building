Peace Now, which monitors Israeli
settlement construction in the West Bank, said Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu’s new government hasn’t issued any tenders or
approved any additional building plans.  “It’s not a freeze, but restraint,” Peace Now spokeswoman
Hagit Ofran said in a phone interview. Netanayhu’s new
government was formed in March.  Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has said a halt in
settlement building is a condition for him to resume peace talks
with  Israel , which the U.S. is seeking to revive. Negotiations
stalled in 2010 after Netanyahu declined to extend a 10-month
construction freeze in the West Bank.  Netanyahu promised the U.S. to curb planning and
construction in the West Bank until mid-June, Haaretz newspaper
reported today, citing unidentified senior Israeli officials.  Israel Army Radio said Netanyahu told Housing Minister Uri Ariel to freeze the West Bank tenders. Ariel, interviewed by the
radio, declined to comment on the report, though he said he
would insist that the budget allots money for such construction.  Ofran said about 2,000 housing units are being built in
West Bank settlements and about 500 in East Jerusalem, a part of
the city that the Palestinians seek as the capital of their
state.  To contact the reporter on this story:
