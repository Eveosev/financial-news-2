Record lows for an indicator of U.S.
bond volatility show investors may be overly confident in the
 Federal Reserve ’s ability to prop up the market, according to
 Michael Shaoul , Marketfield Asset Management LLC’s chief
executive officer.  The CHART OF THE DAY displays monthly readings for this
gauge, the Bank of America Merrill Lynch MOVE Index, during the
past 25 years. The index is derived from prices paid for options
on Treasury notes and bonds.  Last month, the MOVE fell below 50 for the first time. A
record low of 49.04 was set on May 1 -- and tied two days later,
even as Treasuries declined in response to April job growth that
exceeded economists’ forecasts.  Investors are demonstrating the kind of faith in Fed
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  and his central-bank colleagues that
they had during the 1990s under his predecessor,  Alan Greenspan ,
Shaoul wrote yesterday in an e-mailed note to clients of his New
York-based firm. The Fed is currently buying $85 billion of debt
each month under a policy of so-called quantitative easing.  “We ourselves take less comfort from the current state of
affairs,” he wrote. “The stubborn belief that exists in the
bond market” is at odds with its returns this year by
comparison with stocks, the note said.  Bonds had a 0.6 percent total return -- price changes and
interest payments -- for the year through last week, according
to the Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index. As for stocks, the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index returned about 14 percent after
accounting for dividends.  To contact the reporter on this story:
