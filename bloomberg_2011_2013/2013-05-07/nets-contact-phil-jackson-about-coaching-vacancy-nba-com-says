The Brooklyn Nets contacted Phil Jackson to determine his interest in coaching the team next
season,  NBA.com reported , citing a person familiar with the
situation it didn’t identify.  The Nets reached out to Jackson yesterday, NBA.com said, a
day after they fired interim coach P.J. Carlesimo following the
team’s loss to the Chicago Bulls in the first round of the
National Basketball Association playoffs.  There’s no indication how long Jackson, who won a total of
11 NBA championships as coach of the Chicago Bulls and Los
Angeles Lakers, would take before responding to the Nets’
inquiry, the report said.  The Detroit Pistons said last week that Jackson will be an
adviser for the team in its coaching search. Jackson, 67, left
the Lakers after the 2010-11 season and is frequently mentioned
whenever a high-profile coaching or front-office vacancy occurs
in the NBA. ESPN reported last week that the Toronto Raptors
were pursuing him as team president.  To contact the reporter on this story:
