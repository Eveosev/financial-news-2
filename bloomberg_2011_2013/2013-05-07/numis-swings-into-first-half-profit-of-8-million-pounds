Numis Corp. (NUM) , a broker for smaller
companies in the U.K., swung into profit in the fiscal first
half on record institutional commission and trading revenue.  The company had net income of 7.97 million pounds ($12
million) in the six months to March 31 compared with a loss of
624,000 pounds in the year-earlier period, London-based Numis
said in a statement today. Revenue rose to 32.4 million pounds
from 23.3 million pounds a year ago.  “We have seen a marked improvement in both secondary and
primary income during the first half of our 2013 financial
year,” Chief Executive Officer Oliver Hemsley said in the
statement. “Our second half has started well.”  Numis said it benefitted from “strong inflows” of funds
into equities during the fiscal first half, with the FTSE
SmallCap index gaining 18.4 percent and the FTSE 250 advancing
19 percent. Companies also raised more than twice the amount in
share sales compared with last year, reflecting a “resurgence
of interest for good-quality initial public offering
prospects,” Numis said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
