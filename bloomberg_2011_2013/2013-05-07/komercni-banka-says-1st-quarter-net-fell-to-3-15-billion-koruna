Komercni Banka AS, the Czech unit of
Societe Generale SA, said first-quarter net fell to 3.15 billion
koruna from 3.49 billion koruna a year earlier, the Prague-based
lender said in the statement.  Net interest income totaled 5.26 billion koruna, compared
with 5.55 billion koruna in the earlier period.  The Czech central bank kept interest rates near zero for a
fourth meeting last week as policy makers debate whether to
weaken the koruna amid the recession. The economy has shrunk for
five consecutive quarters, the longest contraction since at
least 1996, as households and businesses spend less because of
 Europe â€™s debt crisis and government austerity.  To contact the reporter on this story:
