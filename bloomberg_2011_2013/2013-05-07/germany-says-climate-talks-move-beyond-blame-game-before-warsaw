Climate talks that ended today in
Berlin moved beyond a “blame game,” said  Germany ’s Environment
Minister Peter Altmaier, after recent disagreements.  Representatives from 35 nations met in the city before
United Nations-mandated discussions on tackling climate change
due this year in Warsaw. Delegates from more than 190 states aim
to reach a deal in 2015 to curb greenhouse gas emissions from
2020. They plan to replace the Kyoto Protocol, which was adopted
in 1997 and limits pollution from industrial nations.  “Everybody realized we cannot afford to miss the
opportunity of advancing in Warsaw,” Altmaier said at a press
conference with Polish Environment Minister Marcin Korolec. “We
have to deliver in 2015. There’s no excuse if you don’t.”  Participants in Berlin agreed that the key elements and
functions of a new deal should be clarified by early 2014 and a
draft should be ready by March 2015, Altmaier and Korolec said
in a joint statement handed to reporters after the talks.  Discussions in Warsaw must deliver “concrete results” on
issues such as climate financing, Altmaier said. They should
become “an important step” toward a 2015 deal, Korolec said.  Developed and developing countries have disagreed over who
should take greater responsibility for tackling climate change.  To contact the reporter on this story:
