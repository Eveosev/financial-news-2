Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW)  is
recalling 220,000 vehicles globally for a front-passenger air-
bag defect that caused Japanese carmakers to recall 3 million
vehicles last month.  Affected vehicles are BMW 3-Series models produced from
December 2001 to March 2003. Munich-based BMW expects that
180,000 of the vehicles are still in use, Bernhard Santer, a
spokesman, said by phone.  BMW’s recall is caused by faulty air-bag inflators from
Japanese supplier  Takata Corp. (7312) , the same problem that led to
mass recalls at Toyota Motor Corp., Honda Motor Co. and Nissan
Motor Co. in April. Klaus Draeger, BMW’s head of purchasing and
supplier network, said at the time that Takata was a minor air-
bag supplier for the company and that BMW was examining whether
it was affected.  Daimler AG said in April that it wasn’t affected as the
defective part wasn’t built into Mercedes-Benz vehicles.  A recall of more than 10 million Toyota cars and trucks in
2009 and 2010 over floor mats jamming accelerator pedals marred
the image of  Asia ’s biggest automaker and shed light on the
risks of using the same part on a whole range of vehicles to cut
costs.  BMW isn’t aware of any incidents related to the defect,
Santer said. He declined to comment on the financial effect of
the recall. BMW is replacing the air bags free of charge for
each customer in a service that takes about an hour, Santer
said.  A phone call to Takata’s public relations office in  Tokyo 
after regular business hours wasn’t answered.  The recalls in April led to Takata shares tumbling 9
percent on the day of the announcements by the three biggest
Japanese car-makers. The Tokyo-based parts maker was also
involved in a recall of almost 9 million vehicles to replace
faulty seat belts in 1995, a record for the  auto industry  at the
time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
