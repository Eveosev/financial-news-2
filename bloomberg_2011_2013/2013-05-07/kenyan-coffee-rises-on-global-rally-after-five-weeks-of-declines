auction, rebounding from five weeks of declines in line with a
global rally.  The average price for all coffee sold gained 8 percent to
$152.66 for a 50-kilogram (110-pound) bag from $141.35 a week
ago, the Nairobi Coffee Exchange said today by e-mail. The
benchmark AA grade advanced 7.9 percent to average $285.15.  Kenya produces arabica coffee, sought after for blending
into specialty beverages. Export destinations for its beans
include  Germany , the U.S. and  Sweden , according to the Kenya
Coffee Producers and Traders Association, which owns the
exchange. Arabica futures gained the most this year in  New York 
trading on May 2, according to figures compiled by Bloomberg.  Sales climbed 41 percent to 7,437 bags worth $1.38 million,
from 5,257 bags valued at $906,251 at the previous sale, the
exchange said. Supplies increased 1.5 percent to 21,780 bags.  Following are details of todayâ€™s auction in dollars a 50-
