Record  tin exports  from Indonesia, the
largest shipper, are under threat after prices tumbled into a
 bear market  and below production costs at some smelters.  Futures fell 14 percent to $20,200 a metric ton this year
on the London Metal Exchange as Indonesian smelters accelerated
sales before tougher rules on the purity of shipments start in
July. Production costs average $22,000 a ton, the Indonesian Tin
Mining Association estimates. Prices will rally as much as 19
percent to $24,000 by the end of December, according to the
median of 18 forecasts from analysts, exporters and traders
compiled by Bloomberg.  A similar survey in January predicted $28,750, underscoring
the surprise at the scale of first-quarter exports. Analysts are
still bullish because while supplies of metals from aluminum to
copper are exceeding demand, Barclays Plc and Morgan Stanley
expect a fourth consecutive year of tin shortages. Shipments of
personal computers, tablets and mobile phones, all using tin-based solder, will surge 9 percent to a record 2.4 billion units
this year, according to Gartner Inc., a research company.  “Tin is still, from a fundamental perspective, in a better
shape than most of the LME-traded metals,” said Duncan Hobbs,
an analyst at Macquarie Group Ltd. in  London . “We’re just a
little less positive on the tin balance than we were at the
beginning of the year.”  Curbing Shipments  Tin tumbled into a bear market May 1 after dropping 20
percent from its closing high Jan. 18, amid increasing concern
that economic growth may slow. The LMEX index of six industrial
metals retreated 9.4 percent this year, and six of the seven
worst performers in the Standard & Poor’s GSCI gauge of 24
commodities are precious or base metals. The MSCI All-Country
World Index of equities gained 9.9 percent. A Bank of America
Corp. index shows Treasuries returned 0.3 percent.  Indonesia’s exports jumped 20 percent to 26,805 tons in the
first quarter, the highest level on record for the period,
Macquarie Group estimates. That pace is unlikely to continue
beyond June because smelters usually respond to price slumps by
curbing shipments, new quality standards start in the third
quarter and producers have been reducing stockpiles, according
to Morgan Stanley.  PT DS Jaya Abadi, whose plant in Bangka-Belitung province
supplies about 3,600 tons of ingots a year, is already cutting
output, said Operations Director Muhammad Buntar Gunawan.
Production costs are $21,000 a ton, he said.  New Regulations  Exports may be further impeded by new rules increasing the
tin content of cargoes and reducing lead and cadmium levels.
Fifteen to 20 smelters will be able meet the new regulations,
said Hidayat Arsani, president of the country’s 30-member tin
mining association. CV Serumpun Sebalai, a smelter company in
Central Bangka, can produce higher-grade tin but will need new
technology to cut lead content, President Director Tjahyono
said.  Morgan Stanley estimates this year’s supply shortage at 800
tons, as consumption rises 5.8 percent to 358,000 tons. Barclays
predicts a 7,000-ton deficit, with stockpiles averaging 3.3
weeks of demand, the lowest since at least 2004.  Futures aren’t signaling shortages right now, with tin for
immediate delivery priced at a $50 discount to the benchmark
three-month contract. While that’s smaller than the $62 spread
reached March 21, traders were paying a premium of as much as
$120 in September, bourse data show.  Stockpiles in warehouses tracked by the LME reached 14,670
tons on April 16, the most since November 2011. Orders to
withdraw metal declined 15 percent since the start of the year,
exchange data show. Inventories in Malaysia account for 87
percent of the global total.  Refined Metal  Global supply of refined metal will advance 6.5 percent to
357,000 tons this year, the fastest expansion since 2010, Morgan
Stanley estimates. That’s still little changed from 2007 as ores
become harder to extract. Mining companies in  Indonesia  are now
digging 12 meters (39 feet) down, a fourfold increase from five
years ago, the country’s tin mining association said in January.  Indonesia may ship 80,000 tons this year, according to the
median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of 12 exporters, traders
and analysts. While that’s more than the 75,000 tons predicted
in the January survey, it would be 19 percent less than the
amount sold in 2012. The government is forecasting a 10 percent
gain in production to 100,000 tons.  Shares of PT Timah, the world’s third-largest producer,
fell 11 percent to 1,370 rupiah in Jakarta trading this year.
They will reach 1,443 rupiah in 12 months, the average of nine
 analyst forecasts  compiled by Bloomberg shows. The company will
report a 38 percent gain in profit to 594 billion rupiah ($61
million) this year, according to the mean of 10 estimates.  Shutting Smelters  Producers curbed supplies previously during slumps, with 24
of 28 smelters in Bangka Belitung shutting smelters or selling
less in August, after futures fell to a two-year closing low.
Tin rallied 12 percent the following month. Sales were also
reduced in the final quarter of 2011, spurring a 19 percent
rebound in prices in the first three months of 2012.  Shortages may be exacerbated by economic growth in  China ,
the biggest tin refiner and consumer, which may accelerate this
quarter and next, according to the median of 30 analyst
estimates. A decline in the country’s tin imports and domestic
production signal a run down in stockpiles, which may boost
demand in the second half of the year, according to Barclays.  Combined shipments of  personal computers , mobile phones and
tablets will increase a further 6 percent to 2.56 billion units
in 2014 and reach almost 3 billion units in 2017, according to
 Stamford , Connecticut-based Gartner. Solder accounted for about
50 percent of tin consumption last year. A mobile phone contains
about 0.7 gram of tin and a tablet as much as 3 grams, according
to data from ITRI Ltd., a  St. Albans , England-based researcher,
and Henkel AG, a Dusseldorf-based solder maker.  “Tin is still our favorite one,” said  Gayle Berry , an
analyst at Barclays in London. “It’s the only one in deficit
this year. Having said that, we have become cautious.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
