The cost of insuring Asia-Pacific
corporate and sovereign bonds against non-payment fell,
according to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index slipped 0.5 basis point
to 97.5 basis points as of 10:15 a.m. in Sydney, according to
 Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC)  prices. The measure is on course for the
lowest close since Nov. 5, 2010, according to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan fell 1 basis point to 101 as of 8:17
a.m. in  Singapore , Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc prices show.
The benchmark has fallen 6.5 this month, according to CMA, which
is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices quoted by
dealers in the privately negotiated market.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index dropped 6 basis points to 80
as of 9:15 a.m. in  Tokyo , according to Deutsche Bank AG prices.
The drop is the biggest since April 5, putting the gauge on
track for the lowest close since May 2008, according to CMA.
Japanese markets were closed May 3 through May 6 for public
holidays.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
