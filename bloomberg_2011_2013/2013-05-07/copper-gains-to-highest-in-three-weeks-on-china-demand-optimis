Copper climbed to the highest level in
three weeks on speculation that demand may improve in  China , the
biggest user. Aluminum and lead also advanced.  Copper for delivery in three months gained as much as 1.4
percent to $7,374 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange, the
highest level since April 15, and was at $7,325 at 10:44 a.m. in
 Shanghai . The metal recorded the biggest daily advance in 18
months on May 3. The LME reopened after a holiday yesterday.  Copper  stockpiles  tallied by the Shanghai Futures Exchange
fell for a fifth week to 213,782 tons last week, the lowest
since February. LME inventories recorded the first weekly drop
in three months. European Central Bank President Mario Draghi
said yesterday that further interest-rate cuts are possible
after reducing them to a record low last week.  “Copper may have seen the low for the first half in April,
as we learned that demand is improving,” Zhang Tianfeng, an
analyst at Dongxing Futures Co., said by phone from Shanghai.
“It may be poised to test $7,500 as the retreat in April should
have factored in all the negative news from China.”  China’s customs department will release April trade data
tomorrow and the statistics bureau will announce consumer and
producer price growth on May 9.  Copper for delivery in July on the Comex advanced 0.3
percent to $3.321 per pound, while the September contract on the
Shanghai Futures Exchange rose 0.7 percent to 53,200  yuan 
($8,637) a ton.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
