Spot gasoline weakened against futures
for a third day on the  Gulf Coast  as  Valero Energy Corp. (VLO) 
finished maintenance at a Meraux, Louisiana, refinery.  A fluid catalytic cracker at the 135,000-barrel-a-day
 Meraux plant  is increasing toward planned rates after the work,
said  Bill Day , a San Antonio-based spokesman for Valero. The
refinery carried out catalyst changes through the month of
April, he said.  Valero also completed maintenance at the  McKee refinery  in
Texas yesterday, while  Phillips 66 (PSX)  finished work at its Borger,
Texas, plant. The site have a combined capacity of 316,000
barrels a day.  Conventional, 85-octane gasoline, or CBOB on the Gulf Coast
weakened by 1.88 cents to  17.63 cents  a gallon below futures on
the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 2:11 p.m., data compiled by
Bloomberg show. It was the third consecutive loss, the longest
string of declines since March 25.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel fuel  in the region was unchanged at
a discount of 3.5 cents versus futures.  The  3-2-1 crack spread  in the Gulf, a rough measure of
refining margins based on West Texas Intermediate in Cushing,
 Oklahoma , retreated 23 cents to $21.83 a barrel. The same spread
for Light Louisiana Sweet oil strengthened by 12 cents to $10.88
a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
