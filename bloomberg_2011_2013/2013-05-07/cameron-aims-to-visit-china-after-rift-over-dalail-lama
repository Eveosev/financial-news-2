U.K. Prime Minister  David Cameron  is
intending to visit  China  this year, his office said,
acknowledging that his meeting with the Tibetan spiritual
leader, the Dalai Lama, in 2012 caused tension.  Cameron has visited China once as premier, in November
2010, when he stopped on his way to a Group of 20 summit in
Seoul. On that occasion, he refused a Chinese request to remove
a poppy from his lapel, worn in memory of Britain’s war dead.
The flower has a difference resonance in China, which lost two
opium wars with Britain in the 19th century.  British prime ministers have tried to visit China about
every two years, with previous trips in 2005 and 2008. Cameron’s
spokesman, Christian Cubitt acknowledged “differences” between
the U.K. and China today, saying the government aims to
“manage” them “with respect.”  “The Chinese government always lobbies hard against any
meetings between foreign governments and the  Dalai Lama ,”
Cubitt told reporters in  London . “We’ve made clear in advance
that British ministers will decide whom they meet and when.”  China filed a formal diplomatic complaint with the U.K.
after Cameron met the Dalai Lama in London in May last year,
saying relations between the two countries had been “seriously
damaged.”  The Dalai Lama has lived in  India  since fleeing Tibet in
1959 from China’s military takeover. China accuses the Nobel
Peace Prize winner of waging a campaign for independence while
he says he is seeking autonomy for Tibet.  To contact the reporter on this story:
