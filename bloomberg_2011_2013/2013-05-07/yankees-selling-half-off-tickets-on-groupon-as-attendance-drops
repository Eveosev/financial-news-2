The  New York Yankees  are selling
tickets at more than a 50 percent discount on the coupon website
 Groupon Inc. (GRPN)  as attendance lags behind last season, even though
the team is off to a better start.  The tickets, for games against either the Seattle Mariners
on May 14-16 or Cleveland Indians on June 3-5, are for terrace
level seats at Yankee Stadium for $22, a $24 savings, according
to the Groupon offer. The team also is discounting pricier
tickets, selling $60 seats for $35 and $95 seats for $60.  The Yankees, with All-Stars  Derek Jeter ,  Alex Rodriguez ,
 Curtis Granderson  and  Mark Teixeira  among players sidelined with
injuries, have played 19 home games this season,  averaging
37,414 fans  per contest to rank sixth in  Major League Baseball .
Through the same number of games last season, the team’s average
home attendance was 40,710 and its record was 16-14, two games
worse than this year.  For the 2012 season, New York averaged 43,733 fans to rank
second behind the Philadelphia Phillies. The Yankees haven’t
finished lower than No. 2 in average home attendance since 2001,
when they were third.  The Yankees were selling $6 tickets yesterday for the
Mariners series games on the terrace, grandstand and bleacher
seats as part of its “MasterCard Monday” 24-hour deals. Last
week the team offered Jim Beam Suite seats for $80, a $50
discount.  The least-expensive tickets on the secondary market for the
May 14 Yankees-Mariners game are going for $14 on Stubhub.com,
according to ticket aggregator TiqIQ.  Price Decline  The average list price for resale tickets to games at
Yankee Stadium was $58 in 2012, $79 in 2011 and $85 in 2010,
according to New York-based TiqIQ.  “This season should follow the trend,” Chris Matcovich, a
spokesman for TiqIQ, said in an e-mail.  Jason Latimer, a spokesman for the Yankees, didn’t
immediately respond to an e-mail seeking comment on the discount
programs.  The Yankees have had a winning start to the season even
with the key injuries. New York has won seven of its past 10
contests and is two games behind the American League East-
leading  Boston Red Sox , who are 21-11.  Oddsmakers were concerned about the makeup of the Yankees’
roster entering the season. The Atlantis Casino Resort in Reno,
Nevada, in February put the team’s projected win total at 86
1/2. The Yankees haven’t won fewer than 87 games in a full
season since 1992.  To contact the reporter on this story:
