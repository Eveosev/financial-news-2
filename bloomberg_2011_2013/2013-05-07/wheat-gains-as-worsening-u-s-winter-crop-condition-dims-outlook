Wheat climbed for the first time in
three days after the government said winter-crop conditions
worsened in the U.S., the largest shipper, reigniting concern
that production will suffer. Corn and soybeans advanced.  Wheat for delivery in July rose as much as 0.8 percent to
$7.085 a bushel on the  Chicago  Board of Trade, after losing 3.5
percent in the past two days. Futures were at $7.06, up 0.5
percent, by 9:42 a.m. in Singapore on volume that was 48 percent
below the 100-day average for that time of day.  About 32 percent of the winter-wheat crop was  rated  good-
to-excellent as of May 5, down from 33 percent a week earlier
and 63 percent a year earlier, according to the U.S. Department
of Agriculture. Some 23 percent of the spring-variety was
planted, behind last year’s 82 percent and an average of 50
percent in the previous five years, the USDA said yesterday.  “The USDA’s weekly crop progress report showed a further
deterioration in the U.S. winter-wheat crop conditions and
underlined the slow pace of spring wheat seeding,”  Luke Mathews ,
a commodity strategist at  Commonwealth Bank of Australia , wrote
in a report e-mailed today.  Corn for July delivery gained as much as 0.6 percent to
$6.405 a bushel in Chicago, before trading at $6.3775. Planting
of corn in the U.S., the largest grower, was 12 percent complete
in the week ended May 5, the slowest pace for that week since
1984, according to the USDA.  The slow pace of planting “should ensure production
concerns remain a feature of the corn market over the next week
or so,” Mathews said.  Soybeans for July delivery advanced 0.3 percent to $13.7375
a bushel. About 2 percent of the soybean crop was seeded,
 trailing  the average of 12 percent for that week in the previous
five years, a USDA report showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
