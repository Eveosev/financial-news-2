CEZ AS, the  Czech Republic ’s largest
electricity company, climbed to the highest level in three weeks
after reporting first-quarter earnings that beat analyst
estimates and raising full-year profit targets.  The  stock  gained as much as 2.3 percent to 582 koruna, the
highest price since April 16, and was up 0.9 percent at 574
koruna as of 12:05 p.m. in Prague. The 14-member PX Index
advanced 0.4 percent.  Net income in the three months through March rose 24
percent to 17.9 billion koruna, the company said today, more
than the 14.7 billion-koruna average estimate of nine analysts
in a Bloomberg survey. CEZ posted a gain of 1.5 billion koruna
from trading carbon permits, while earnings were also buoyed by
1.9 billion koruna after the company stopped operations in
Albania, where the utility lost its license last year.  “The results were significantly better than our estimate
and the market consensus,”  Josef Nemy , an analyst at Komercni
Banka AS, said in a note published after the earnings were
released.  The utility raised its  earnings guidance  after concluding a
50-year contract for supplies of brown coal. The target for 2013
net income was increased to 37.5 billion koruna from 37 billion
koruna, while the goal for earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization was lifted to 81 billion koruna
from 80 billion koruna.  The increased targets do not include proceeds from the
March disposal of the Chvaletice coal-fired plant, which may add
a further 2 billion koruna to net income this year, Chief
Financial Officer Martin Novak said at a press conference in
Prague today. The transaction must first be approved by the
anti-monopoly office, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
