Petrominerales Ltd. (PMGC)  fell the most
since September on concern the Canadian oil producer will be
forced to sell assets at below-market prices to pay back debt
after agreeing to buy an oil block in  Colombia .  Petrominerales declined 9.7 percent to 10,480 pesos at 2:02
p.m. in Bogota, the biggest drop on a closing basis since Sept.
12. The Colombian-traded shares have tumbled 29 percent this
year, the worst performance on the Colcap index, which has
declined 7.9 percent.  The company agreed to buy an 87.5 percent interest in the
Canaguaro block in the Llanos Basin in eastern Colombia for
$15.95 million in cash and a commitment to cover some initial
costs. Petrominerales seeks to operate the block, which includes
a oil-producing field, once the deal closes, according to a
statement yesterday.  “The potential for near-term production is quite valid,”
Alan Knowles, an analyst at Haywood Securities Inc., said in a
telephone interview from Calgary. “People are concerned, even
though it’s not a material acquisition, but they’re in front of
a debt repayment.”  Petrominerales may need cash because holders of convertible
bonds will probably exercise an option to demand repayment of
about $200 million in August, Knowles wrote in a May 6 research
report to clients.  To contact the reporter on this story:
