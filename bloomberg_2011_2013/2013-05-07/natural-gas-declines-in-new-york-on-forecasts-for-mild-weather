Natural gas futures fell for a second
day in New York, dropping to a one-month low, as forecasts
called for seasonal temperatures across the Northeast and
Midwest that will curb demand from power producers.  Cooler air will prevail in the Midwest and southern and
eastern states through May 16, Commodity Weather Group LLC of
Bethesda, Maryland, said today in a note to clients.
Temperatures in  New York  will reach 69 degrees Fahrenheit (21
Celsius) on May 16, two degrees below normal. Chicago will rise
to 72 degrees, two degrees above average.  “It looks as if the switch from late-season heating demand
to shoulder-season demand levels is under way,” said  Gene McGillian , an analyst and broker at Tradition Energy in
 Stamford ,  Connecticut .  Natural gas for June delivery slipped 2.5 cents, or 0.6
percent, to $3.986 per million British thermal units at 9:22
a.m. on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  after dropping to
$3.96, the lowest intraday price since April 5. Trading was 8.3
percent above the 100-day average for the time of day.  The fuel has increased 19 percent so far this year as the
coldest March since 2002 boosted heating demand and eliminated a
stockpile surplus. Supplies advanced 43 billion cubic feet to
1.777 trillion in the week ended April 26, 6.2 percent below the
five-year average, the Energy Information Administration
reported last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
