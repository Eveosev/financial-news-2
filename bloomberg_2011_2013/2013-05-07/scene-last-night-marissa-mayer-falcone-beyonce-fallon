Marissa Mayer , chief executive officer of  Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO) , colored her hair in pinstripes of red, blue and green to go with her red dress.  Anne Hathaway  dyed her hair peroxide blonde and wore “the most punk gown I could find in Valentino’s archive,” black with some sections exposed by silvery outlines. Her husband wore black eyeliner. “I love it, it makes his eyes pop,” she said.  The Metropolitan Museum of Art Costume Institute Gala on Monday night, opening the show “Punk: Chaos to Couture,” celebrated the punk look as well as punk spirit.  “Punk is an attitude, a state of mind,” said actress Rooney Mara, wearing black lipstick and a white-lace Givenchy gown. “I don’t think I dress very punk.”  Damian Lewis, star of Showtime’s “Homeland,” joked that his nod to the theme was showing up angry.  “Punk is not caring what other people think,” said Madonna, in torn fishnet stockings.  “I’m a bit of a rebel,” Beyonce said.  Punk is “do-it-yourself individualism,” said Andrew Bolton, the curator of the Met show. “It’s about innovation and creativity,” he added. Mohawks? Not so much. He excluded them as “cliches.”  Guests on the other hand took utter delight in copying and offering fresh takes on iconic punk looks. For some makeup was enough:  Emily Blunt  wore bright pink eyeshadow. Designer Wes Gordon sported a soft, floppy “faux hawk,” as he put it, and was accompanied by French model Constance Jablonski in a dress he designed with metallic fabric.  Half Punk  Lauren  Santo Domingo , co-founder and creative director of Moda Operandi Inc. and a ball co-chairman, wore spiky earrings by Jar of Paris, a regal silver silk gown from Dolce & Gabbana’s Alta Moda collection, and a choker by Eddie Borgo, from Moda Operandi’s punk collection.  “I couldn’t do punk with much authenticity,” she said. “I did wear Doc Martens in the ’90s, but so did everyone.” Moda Operandi is the sponsor of the exhibition and the ball.  Lisa Maria Falcone, whose film “Mud” starring  Matthew McConaughey  has been doing well at the box office, wore a Zaldy gown made of sheets of neon yellow-green studs, paired with a black plastic brassiere.  “I like to take it in a different direction,” Falcone said.  Marc Jacobs  wore pajamas, which he said wasn’t very rebellious. “Wearing a tuxedo is the most subversive thing you can do, because everything’s just gone so far,” he said.  Best Accessories  That meant  Robert Kraft , owner of the  New England Patriots ,  Tiger Woods  and comedians  Jerry Seinfeld  and  Jimmy Fallon  were all rebellious, in tuxedos. Their best accessories, they agreed, were their dates.  “Women are smarter than men, so hanging out with a good woman is good business,” Kraft said, standing with his girlfriend, Ricki Noel Lander. “One thing about my association with Ricki is she comes with a different point of view and much of it is right in vogue with what’s going on in the world today,” Kraft said.  “I think punk will come back,” Lander said.  The ball raised “approximately $11.3 million,” according to Nancy Chilton, a spokeswoman for the museum.
