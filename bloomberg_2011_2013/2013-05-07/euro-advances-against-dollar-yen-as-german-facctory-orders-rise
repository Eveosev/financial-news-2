The euro advanced against the dollar
and erased a drop versus the yen after a report showed German
factory orders unexpectedly jumped in March.  The 17-member currency gained 0.3 percent to $1.3110 as of
11:10 a.m. London time. It strengthened 0.2 percent to 130.10
yen after earlier dropping as much as 0.5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
