  Shanghai Aerospace Automobile
Electromechanical Co. (600151) , a maker of car air conditioners and
solar-power parts, plans to sell wholly-owned Jiayuguan Taike
Photovoltaic Power Co. for at least 250 million yuan ($40.6
million).  The company is seeking buyers through an equity exchange
for the solar-farm developing unit, according to a statement
posted to the  Shanghai Stock Exchange  today.  The unit is building 100 megawatts of solar plants in
Chinaâ€™s northwestern province of Gansu, Shanghai Aerospace said.
Construction of 50 megawatts of the projects will be completed
by the end of June, with the rest scheduled for year-end.  The unit sale, once completed, will bring a profit of more
than 49 million yuan for Shanghai Aerospace, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
