General Motors Co. (GM) , the largest
foreign automaker in China, said it won regulatory approval to
build a Cadillac factory to boost sales of  luxury vehicles  in
the world’s biggest automobile market.  The  National Development and Reform Commission  has signed
off on the plant, which will be located in Shanghai’s Jinqiao
zone, with construction beginning in June, Dayna Hart, a GM
spokeswoman, said in an e-mail today. Investments will total at
least 8 billion yuan ($1.3 billion) and annual production
capacity will be 150,000 units, she said.  The plant would allow GM to avoid paying China’s 25 percent
import tariff as it seeks to bolster Cadillac sales in the
country. The move is part of Chief Executive Officer Dan Akerson’s plans for the luxury brand to compete with  Bayerische
Motoren Werke AG (BMW) ’s BMW and  Volkswagen AG (VOW) ’s Audi.  GM sold 30,010 Cadillacs in  China  last year, trailing
Audi’s 405,838, BMW’s 327,341 and Daimler AG’s Mercedes-Benz at
196,211 units, according to company figures. The Detroit-based
automaker discontinued production of the Cadillac SLS in China
after the model was replaced by the XTS, Hart said.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
