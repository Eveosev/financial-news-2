Copper futures fell from a three-week
high on concern that trade data this week in  China , the world’s
top user of industrial metals, will add to evidence that the
country’s economy is slowing.  Chinese imports probably climbed 13 percent in April after
increasing 14.1 percent in March, based on the median estimate
in a Bloomberg survey before tomorrow’s data. Exports increased
9.2 percent, the slowest in five months, the survey showed.
Copper buyers are looking for more signs of a recovery after a
rise in U.S. payrolls boosted the price by the most in 18 months
on May 3, said Brian Booth at Long Leaf Trading Group.  “We saw a good jump in prices last week, but since then,
there’s been nothing to reinforce the moves, and the market is
waiting to see that,” Booth, a senior market strategist, said
in a telephone interview from  Chicago . “Copper is backing off a
bit until then.”  Copper futures for July delivery fell 0.6 percent to $3.292
a pound at 11:01 a.m. on the Comex in New York. Earlier, the
price reached $3.3475, the highest for a most-active contract
since April 15. On May 3, the metal jumped 6.8 percent. Through
yesterday, the commodity slid 9.4 percent this year.  On the London Metal Exchange, copper for delivery in three
months dropped 0.2 percent to $7,255.75 a metric ton ($3.29 a
pound). Aluminum, lead, nickel, tin and zinc also declined. The
LME was closed yesterday for a public holiday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
