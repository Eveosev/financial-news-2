Portugal ’s notes led gains in the euro
area’s so-called periphery as the nation’s first sale of 10-year
bonds since its bailout in 2011 attracted demand for more than
three times the amount being raised.  The nation’s  two-year  yields dropped to the lowest since
July 2010. Investors submitted bids for 10.2 billion euros
($13.4 billion) of the debt maturing in February 2024, compared
with the 3 billion euros being sold, according to a person
familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified because
they’re not authorized to speak about it. German bunds fell for
a third day as factory orders unexpectedly increased in March,
damping demand for the region’s safest assets.  “The demand Portugal got from investors was strong, which
reinforces the positive sentiment,” said Alessandro Giansanti,
a senior rates strategist at ING Groep NV in Amsterdam. “In a
low-yield environment, investment is attracted to securities
that offer yield.”  Portugal’s two-year  yield  fell 14 basis points, or 0.14
percentage point, to 2.42 percent at 5 p.m.  London  time, after
reaching 2.40 percent, the lowest since July 28, 2010. The 3.6
percent bond due in October 2014 gained 0.195, or 1.95 euros per
1,000-euro face amount, to 101.63.  The nation’s five-year yield declined eight basis points to
4.14 percent. The 10-year bond yielded 5.52 percent after
falling to 5.435 percent, the  lowest  since Aug. 31, 2010.  Portuguese Sale  Portugal is selling  10-year bonds  for the first time in
more than two years as it seeks to regain full access to debt
markets. The nation stopped selling bonds until this year after
requesting a 78 billion-euro bailout from the European Union and
 International Monetary Fund  in April 2011.  “The 10-year maturity is a very important maturity because
it completes the yield curve and so completes our process of
returning to bond markets and normalizes our access to
markets,” Portuguese Finance Minister Vitor Gaspar told
reporters in Brussels. “At this moment we have already been
able to totally finance our needs for this year and are starting
the pre-financing for 2014.”  Portugal’s sale will support the bond markets of other
highly indebted European nations, according to  Peter Chatwell , a
senior fixed-income strategist at Credit Agricole Corporate &
Investment Bank in London.  ‘Periphery Positive’  “It marks further progress in exiting the bailout
programmes of the worst of the euro sovereign debt crisis,”
Chatwell wrote in an e-mailed note today. “We expect investor
appetite to be strong, with the deal likely to be a beneficiary
of the prevailing ‘yield grab’ mentality.”  Italian 10-year yields dropped five basis points to 3.87
percent.  German factory orders, adjusted for seasonal swings and
inflation, increased 2.2 percent from February, the Economy
Ministry in Berlin said. Economists forecast a 0.5 percent drop,
according to the median of 39 estimates in a Bloomberg survey.  Ten-year bund yields climbed six basis points to 1.30
percent after reaching 1.31 percent, the most since April 11.  Germany  allotted 740 million euros of inflation-linked
bonds due in April 2023 at a so-called real yield of minus 0.4
percent, the  lowest  on record according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Austria’s 10-year bond yields rose three basis points to
1.67 percent after the nation sold 660 million euros of debt
maturing in 2023 at a record-low auction yield of 1.621 percent.  Portuguese bonds returned 5.8 percent this year through
yesterday, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. Austrian
securities gained 1.7 percent, and Germany’s rose 0.8 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
