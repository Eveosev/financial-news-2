Beijing Tong Ren Tang Chinese Medicine
Co. more than  doubled  from the offer price on its first day of
trading in Hong Kong amid speculation the seller of traditional
drugs and health products will boost profitability.  The shares rose to HK$7.01 at the midday trading break in
the city, about 2.3 times the offer price of HK$3.04. The Hong
Kong-based company was spun off from  Tong Ren Tang Technologies
Co. (1666) , a maker of traditional Chinese medicines.  “Tong Ren Tang is a very strong brand,” Derrick Sun, a
health-care analyst at Bank of China International in Hong Kong,
said by phone. “Investors should prefer the spinoff to Tong Ren
Tang Technologies, as the spinoff might enjoy higher margins and
faster growth going forward.”  Demand for Beijing Tong Ren Tang’s offering was expected to
be strong because the parent company granted preferential shares
to qualified existing stockholders, limiting the stock available
to other investors, Sun said.  The preferential offer was 6.45 times oversubscribed, the
company said in an e-mailed statement yesterday.  The company is about 40 percent  owned  by Tong Ren Tang
Technologies, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Beijing
Tongrentang Co., a traditional-medicine maker listed in
 Shanghai , holds a 35 percent stake.  To contact the reporter on this story:
