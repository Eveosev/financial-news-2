World exports of seven major edible
oils and fats are expected to jump 5.2 percent on increased
import requirements by China and  India , led by higher  palm oil 
deliveries, Oil World said.  Export shipments of six vegetable oils and tallow may be 71
million metric tons in the 2012-13 season through to September
from 67.5 million tons in the previous season, the Hamburg-based
researcher wrote in an e-mailed report today.  World exports of palm oil and palm-kernel oil are predicted
to climb to a record, accounting for two thirds of combined
exports of the seven analyzed oils and fats, Oil World wrote.
Crude palm oil futures have dropped 33 percent in  Malaysia  in
the past 12 months.  “The global dependence on palm oil and palm-kernel oil
will continue to rise this season due to insufficient supplies
of other oils and fats,” the researcher wrote.  Global palm-oil exports are forecast to climb to 43.6
million tons in 2012-13 from 40.4 million tons in 2011-12, while
those of palm-kernel oil may climb to 3.44 million tons from
3.08 million tons.  Soybean oil shipments are expected to rise to 9.85 million
tons from 9 million tons, with exports seen accelerating in May
as supplies from Argentina, Brazil and  Paraguay  make up for a
decline in U.S. sales, Oil World said.  Sunflower Seeds  World exports of sunflower-seed oil may slide to 6.46
million tons from 7.28 million tons last season, while rapeseed-oil shipments are predicted to slip to 3.96 million tons from
4.15 million tons in 2011-12, according to Oil World.  “The European Union sharply stepped up imports of sun oil
to satisfy interior demand,” the researcher said. “Also China
and  Iran  boosted imports of sun oil so far this season, thus
reducing supplies available for the rest of the world.”  Tallow exports are seen falling to 1.61 million tons from
1.69 million tons, falling to the lowest in at least four years
on a “substantial decline” of shipments from the U.S., the
largest exporter of the animal fat, Oil World said.  “This development has been largely caused by a dramatic
increase in domestic tallow consumption in the U.S., where a
growing portion of domestic production has been absorbed by the
expanding biodiesel industry,” Oil World wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
