Citigroup Inc. (C)  sued  Barclays Plc (BARC)  for
more than $141 million, claiming the London-based bank refused
to indemnify it for losses suffered providing foreign-exchange
settlement services to Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.  Citigroup’s Citibank NA unit said in a complaint filed
yesterday in Manhattan federal court that it lost the money
extending credit, at Barclays’ request, to Lehman in the week
following Lehman’s Sept. 15, 2008, bankruptcy filing. Citigroup
said it settled foreign-exchange trades for Lehman while
Barclays worked to buy Lehman’s U.S. broker-dealer business.  Barclays agreed to indemnify New York-based Citigroup for
its settlement-related losses from Sept. 17 to Sept. 19,
according to the complaint.  “In clear breach of the parties’ agreement, Barclays has
refused Citibank’s repeated demands that it honor its
indemnity,” according to the complaint.  A phone message seeking comment from Barclays on the
lawsuit wasn’t immediately returned.  The case is  Citibank NA  v. Barclays Bank Plc, 13-cv-03036,
U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
