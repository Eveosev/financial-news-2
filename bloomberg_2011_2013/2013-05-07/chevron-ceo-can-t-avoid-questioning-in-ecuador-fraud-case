Chevron Corp. (CVX)  lost a bid to stop Chief
Executive Officer John Watson from being questioned by the
attorney the company is suing over claims he committed fraud to
win a $19 billion verdict in a pollution case in Ecuador.  U.S. Magistrate Judge James Francis in Manhattan today
ruled that Watson’s experience in leading the 2001 Chevron-
Texaco merger is “likely to have given him personal knowledge
of the environmental issues underlying the Ecuador litigation.”  Francis also overruled San Ramon, California-based
Chevron’s objection to a deposition of vice president and
general counsel Edward Scott by defendant Steven Donziger, who
is accused in the racketeering lawsuit of improperly influencing
a court expert whose findings were used by the Ecuador judge in
the environmental damage case in the Amazon.  Kent Robertson , a spokesman for the company, didn’t
immediately respond to a phone call seeking comment on the
ruling.  Donziger has denied wrongdoing and plaintiffs in the
Ecuadorian case have said the oil company is attacking him to
avoid responsibility for the damages.  The racketeering case is Chevron v. Donziger, 11-00691,
U.S. District Court, District of  New York  (Manhattan). The case
in Ecuador is Aquinda v. Chevron, 002-2003, Superior Court of
Nueva Loja,  Lago Agrio , Ecuador.  To contact the reporter on this story:
