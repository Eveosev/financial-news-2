American International Group Inc. (AIG)  can
proceed with a lawsuit against  Bank of America Corp.  over
residential mortgage-backed securities purchased from the bank’s
Countrywide Financial unit, a judge ruled.  U.S. District Judge Mariana Pfaelzer in Los Angeles
yesterday partly denied a defense request she throw out the
case, ruling that New York-based AIG can pursue claims of
fraudulent inducement.  AIG sued  Charlotte , North Carolina-based Bank of America
and Countrywide for $10 billion in damages in 2011, alleging it
was misled into thinking that loans underlying its investment
were issued according to underwriting guidelines that had been
“long abandoned.”  AIG “plausibly alleges that the underwriting guidelines
stated in the offering documents were false,” Pfaelzer said in
her 40-page ruling.  Lawrence Grayson, a Bank of America spokesman, didn’t
immediately reply to a voice-mail message seeking comment.  The judge rejected claims that the defendants orally
misrepresented underwriting practices and gave false assurances
to investors about the quality of guidelines. She gave AIG
permission to amend the claims.  She also threw out allegations that underwriters Merrill
Lynch and Banc of America Securities knew of malfeasance at
Countrywide, while again giving the insurer permission to re-
plead them. Bank of America bought Countrywide in 2008.  The case is AIG v. Countrywide, 11-10549, U.S. District
Court, Central District of  California  ( Los Angeles ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
