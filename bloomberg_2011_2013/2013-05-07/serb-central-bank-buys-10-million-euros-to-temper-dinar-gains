Serbia ’s central bank today bought
euros for the sixth time this year to slow gains in the dinar as
the currency traded at its strongest levels in 13 months.  The Belgrade-based Narodna Banka Srbije purchased 10
million euros ($13.1 million) from commercial banks to “ease
the excessive daily volatility” of the currency, it said on its
website. The bank bought 50 million euros on April 29.  Three currency traders in Belgrade, who asked to remain
unidentified in line with the policies of their banks, said the
central bank was buying euros at levels of about 110.40 and
110.60 dinars to the euro, after the Serbian currency gained 0.3
percent on the day.  The dinar traded at 110.66 at 6:01 p.m. in Belgrade. It has
gained 2.45 percent against the euro in the past six months.  With today’s intervention, the National Bank of Serbia
purchased a total of 90 million euros to slow the gains in the
dinar. The currency’s strengthening was triggered by the
European Commission’s decision to recommend that European Union
member states begin membership talks with Serbia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
