Oaktree Capital Group LLC (OAK) , the world’s
largest distressed-debt investor, said first-quarter profit more
than tripled as it realized higher gains on investments and
collected more fees.  Net income rose to $57.6 million, or $1.91 a share, from
$18.6 million, or 82 cents, a year earlier, Los Angeles-based
Oaktree said in a statement today. The shares rose as much as
6.9 percent, the most since Oaktree’s April 2012 initial public
offering.  Oaktree is hunting for returns in  Europe , where the firm is
raising a fund to take advantage of a pullback in lending, and
the  emerging markets , where Oaktree is targeting debt held by
troubled issuers or those in danger of default. The firm is also
raising $3 billion for its sixth fund that seeks to take control
of mid-sized companies that are distressed. Assets under
management rose to $78.8 billion from $77.1 billion at the end
of 2012 as the firm attracted $2.6 billion of new money.  “It’s a great time to sell debt and it’s even a great time
to sell stocks, so that’s what we’re doing,”  John Frank ,
Oaktree’s managing principal, said on a conference call today
with investors and analysts. “As long as the markets remain
strong, as they have been, I would imagine you will continue to
see significant realizations.”  Oaktree  rose  5.5 percent to $57.24 at 1:46 p.m. in New York
trading, after earlier surging to $57.99. The shares gained 26
percent this year and 33 percent since the firm’s public
offering last year. Oaktree raised $380 million in the IPO,
selling 8.84 million shares for $43 each, the bottom of the
proposed range.  Record Profit  Oaktree profited from several investments in the first
quarter, completing its sale of Jackson Square Aviation LLC in
January and selling shares of  Charter Communications Inc. (CHTR)  and
property-services company  Savills Plc. (SVS)   Adjusted net income, a measure of profit excluding some
costs including noncash equity compensation and income taxes,
rose 93 percent to $335.8 million, or a record $1.95 a share,
from $173.6 million, or 90 cents, a year earlier. Oaktree’s
distributable earnings also reached a quarterly record, more
than doubling to $295 million, or $1.79 a share. The firm said
it will pay a  dividend  of $1.41 per unit on May 21.  Oaktree said it finished raising its so-called Enhanced
Income Fund, which invests in senior loans, with $1.8 billion.
The firm expects that the fund, which targeted $1.5 billion,
will surpass $2 billion when invested and leveraged and can
deliver “high single-digit” returns net of fees, Frank said
today.  Oaktree also said it has collected $750 million for its
sixth real estate opportunities fund, which is targeting $1.5
billion. Frank said by year-end he expects to attract $1 billion
of new commitments to the firm’s strategic credit segment, which
has raised $900 million to invest in stressed companies
typically ignored by the distressed-debt team because they
offered lower-than-targeted returns.  To contact the reporter on this story:
