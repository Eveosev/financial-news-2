American Express Co. (AXP) , the biggest
credit-card issuer by purchases, said Chief Financial Officer
Daniel T. Henry is retiring later this year.  Henry, who turns 64 this year, will remain in the job while
the company searches for a successor, which could take a couple
of months, New York-based American Express said today in a
statement.  “We decided that now was the right time to begin the
transition,” Chief Executive Officer Kenneth Chenault said in
the statement. “We have agreed on a timetable and arrangement
that will ensure a smooth transition, giving us the flexibility
to search for a new chief financial officer while continuing to
benefit from Dan’s leadership.”  Henry joined American Express in 1990 from Ernst & Young
LLP and was named CFO in 2007, according to the statement.
Before taking over the top finance job, he led the team that
supported the firm’s U.S. Consumer, Small Business and Merchant
Services Group and served as corporate comptroller, the company
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
