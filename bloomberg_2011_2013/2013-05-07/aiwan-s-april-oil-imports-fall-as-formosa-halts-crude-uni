Taiwan , which imports more than 99
percent of its crude requirements, purchased less of the fuel in
April after  Formosa Petrochemical Corp. (6505)  halted a unit for
scheduled maintenance.  Shipments fell 8.8 percent from a year earlier to 26.98
million barrels, the  Ministry of Finance  said in Taipei today.
The island’s April oil bill dropped 21 percent to $2.92 billion,
the ministry said in a statement.  Formosa Petrochemical, Taiwan’s only publicly traded oil
refiner, shut its No. 1 crude distillation unit in mid-March for
50 days of maintenance, Lin Keh-yen, a company spokesman, said
April 11. The refinery’s April sales fell 21 percent from year
earlier, the company said in a  statement  yesterday.  To contact the reporters on this story:
