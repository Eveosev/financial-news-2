JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) ’s asset-
management unit agreed to buy the 31-story tower at 425
Lexington Ave. in  midtown Manhattan  for about $650 million, a
person with knowledge of the plans said.  A contract to acquire the 750,000-square-foot (70,000-
square-meter) building is likely to be completed soon, said the
person, who asked not to be identified because the talks are
private. It’s one of two  Manhattan  towers being marketed by
Houston-based developer Hines, along with 499 Park Ave.,
designed by I.M. Pei.  New York commercial-property  transactions are forecast to
climb this year as investors globally see Manhattan as a safe
place to buy real estate. Brokerage Cushman & Wakefield last
month projected sales of $14.6 billion for the first half of
2013, up from $10.8 billion a year earlier.  Alyson Leiter, a Hines spokeswoman, said the company had no
comment on the planned sale of 425 Lexington. Douglas Harmon,
senior managing director at Eastdil Secured, who’s marketing the
building, and Darin Oduyoye, a spokesman for New York-based
JPMorgan, also declined to comment.  Law firm Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP, the tower’s
primary tenant, with 595,000 square feet on 26 floors, renewed
its lease through 2033, Hines said last month.  Hines bought the glass tower, completed in 1987, for $346
million in 2003, according to Real Capital Analytics Inc., a New
York-based property-research firm. The building is on the east
side of Lexington between East 43rd and 44th streets, just north
of the Chrysler Building.  The JPMorgan agreement was reported by Crain’s  New York 
Business on its website earlier today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
