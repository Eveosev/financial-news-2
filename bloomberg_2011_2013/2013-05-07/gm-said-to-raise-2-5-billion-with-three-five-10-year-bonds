General Motors Co. (GM)  raised $2.5 billion
through its finance unit in a three-part bond offering, the
automaker’s first issue in almost nine months.  The sale from General Motors Financial Co. consisted of $1
billion of three-year, 2.75 percent notes that yield 241 basis
points more than similar-maturity Treasuries, and $750 million
each of five-year, 3.25 percent debt at a spread of 250 basis
points and 10-year, 4.25 percent securities at 247, according to
person with knowledge of the transaction who asked not to be
identified. The deal was initially marketed at $2 billion.  Proceeds will be used to help finance a portion of the
company’s $4.2 billion purchase of Ally Financial Inc.’s
operations in  Europe  and  Latin America  to repay an inter-company
loan and to fund working capital, the Fort Worth, Texas-based
unit said yesterday in a regulatory filing.  Ally (ALLY) , formerly known as GMAC Inc., was owned by GM until
2006, when the automaker sold 51 percent to Cerberus Capital
Management LP. GMAC almost collapsed under the weight of bad
subprime mortgages during the financial crisis.  GM Financial last issued new bonds on Aug. 13 with a $1
billion sale of 4.75 percent securities due 2017, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. A basis point is 0.01 percentage
point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
