Brazil ’s government may shut off the
country’s four most expensive thermo plants after water
reservoir levels increased, a government official said.  The increased reserves during Brazil’s rainy season make it
more likely officials will agree at a meeting tomorrow to turn
off the most expensive diesel plants, said  Marcio Zimmermann ,
executive secretary at Brazil’s Energy Ministry.  Brazil’s southeastern reservoirs, responsible for 70
percent of the country’s hydropower, are at 62.7 percent of
capacity, according to the power grid operator’s website. The
government expected those levels would be slightly above 50
percent, Zimmermann said.  “We are confident that this decision will not affect the
power supply in the country,” Zimmermann said today in an
interview from his office in Brasilia.  Brazil has turned on the full capacity of thermo plants
this year to avoid power cuts as water reservoirs for hydro
facilities dropped to the lowest level in 12 years. Thermo
plants are more costly to operate than hydro ones because of
fuel prices. This raised costs for power distribution companies
such as state-run utility Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras SA,
known as Eletrobras, which were compensated by government.  To contact the reporter on this story:
