Axel Springer AG (SPR) , Europe’s biggest
newspaper publisher, said first-quarter profit before some items
fell 3 percent as the company invested more in digital products
and print revenue continued to decline.  Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization excluding some items declined to 132.4 million
euros ($173 million), the Berlin-based company said in a
statement today. Revenue rose 1.8 percent to 803.6 million,
compared with analysts’ average estimate of 811 million euros,
led by gains from Web-based products outside of  Germany .  Chief Executive Officer Mathias Doepfner, eleven years into
his job, this year vowed to speed up a transition from the
declining newspaper business to digital publications and
classified ads, a move that’s set to depress profit this year.
The non-print business was the biggest contributor to earnings
in the quarter, gaining 34 percent to 62.8 million euros.  “The strong revenue and earnings growth of the digital
media segment confirms us that accelerating the digital
transformation of  Axel Springer  is the right course,” Doepfner
said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
