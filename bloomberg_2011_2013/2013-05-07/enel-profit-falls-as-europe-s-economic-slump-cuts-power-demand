Enel SpA (ENEL) , Italy’s largest utility,
said first-quarter profit dropped 26 percent as  Europe ’s
economic slump cut electricity sales.  Net income slid to 852 million euros ($1.12 billion) from
1.15 billion euros a year earlier after  125 million euros of
writedowns, according to a stock-exchange statement. The Rome-
based company said revenue fell 1.5 percent to 21 billion euros.  Economic stagnation in the company’s main markets in Italy
and Spain is hurting earnings as clients reduce energy
consumption. Enel said electricity sales in the quarter fell 7.1
percent to 76.7 terrawatt hours, while gas sales remained flat
at 3.4 billion cubic meters.  The company said in March it’s planning 4 billion euros of
cost reductions in Italy and Spain and 6 billion euros of asset
sales to help cut debt to 37 billion euros next year. Net debt
at the end of March was up 0.8 percent at 43.3 billion euros.  Enel Chief Executive Officer  Fulvio Conti  said in an
interview on March 21 that he planned to battle stagnant profits
in mature markets by shifting focus to faster growing markets in
 Latin America  and Eastern Europe. The company currently gets
about 60 percent of earnings before interest, tax, depreciation
and amortization from Italy and Spain and the rest from Latin
America, Eastern Europe and its renewable energy business.  To contact the reporters on this story:
