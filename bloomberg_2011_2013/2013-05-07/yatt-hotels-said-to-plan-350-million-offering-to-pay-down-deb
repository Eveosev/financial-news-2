Hyatt Hotels Corp. (H) , the lodging chain
controlled by the Pritzker family, issued bonds to help pay down
debt in its first sale since 2011.  The company sold $350 million of 3.375 senior notes due
July 2023 to yield 165 basis points more than similar-maturity
Treasuries, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Proceeds
will be used to redeem $250 million of 5.75 percent bonds due
August 2015 and to fund a tender offer for $250 million of 6.875
percent securities maturing August 2019, Chicago-based Hyatt
said in a regulatory filing. Any remaining proceeds will be used
for general corporate purposes.  Hyatt last offered debt in August 2011, selling $250
million of 5.375 percent, 10-year notes with a relative yield of
300 basis points, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
bonds traded at 113 cents on the dollar on April 19 to yield
3.55 percent, or 180 basis points more than Treasuries,
according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co. and  SunTrust
Banks Inc. (STI)  managed the new offering, according to the filing.
The bonds are  rated  Baa2 by Moody’s Investors Service, the
credit grader said in a statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
