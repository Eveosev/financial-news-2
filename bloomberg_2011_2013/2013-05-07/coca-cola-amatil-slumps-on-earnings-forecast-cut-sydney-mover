Coca-Cola Amatil Ltd. (CCL) ,  Australia ’s
largest listed drinks company, fell the most in more than four
years after it said first-half profit would drop amid
discounting and import competition.  The bottler fell 6.8 percent to A$13.57 at 10:44 a.m. in
Sydney today, headed for its biggest drop since February 2009,
after reporting earnings before interest and tax in the six
months ending June would drop 8 percent to 9 percent. The
company had previously forecast earnings growth over the full
2013 financial year, and said today that it expects growth to
resume in the second half.  Australian food and drink suppliers have been squeezed by
competition between the country’s two largest supermarkets,
Woolworths Ltd. and Wesfarmers Ltd.-owned Coles, which together
control about 80 percent of the nationwide grocery market. The
Australian dollar’s longest run above parity with the  U.S.
dollar  since at least 1983 has also encouraged cheaper food
imports, hurting Amatil’s SPC Ardmona packaged foods business.  “The grocery channel has experienced a very difficult
start to the year due to the continuation of higher levels of
competitor discounting,” Terry Davis, managing director, said
in a trading update released for the company’s annual
shareholder meeting in Sydney today. “SPC Ardmona earnings have
been materially impacted by increased importing of private label
packaged fruit by retailers.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
