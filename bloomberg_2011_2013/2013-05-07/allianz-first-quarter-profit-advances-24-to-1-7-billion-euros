Allianz SE (ALV) ,  Europe ’s biggest insurer,
said first-quarter profit climbed 24 percent after all of its
businesses saw improved results and the industry had no major
claims from natural disasters.  Net income increased to “around” 1.7 billion euros ($2.2
billion) from 1.37 billion euros a year earlier, the Munich-
based insurer said in a statement on its website. Operating
profit rose to 2.8 billion euros from 2.33 billion euros,
beating the 2.4 billion-euro average estimate of five analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg.  Allianz said in March that it expects “many challenges”
from 2012, including low interest rates and an uncertain
economic outlook, to persist this year. The company said today
it’s on course to meet a full-year goal for operating profit of
8.7 billion euros to 9.7 billion euros compared with the 9.5
billion euros reported in 2012.  “The improvements in our results come from all business
segments,” Chief Executive Officer Michael Diekmann said in the
statement. “We are well on our way toward achieving our
operating profit outlook for the entire year.”  Allianz advanced 1.8 percent to 118.50 euros at 9:03 a.m.
in Frankfurt trading, bringing the gain this year to 13 percent
and valuing the company at 54 billion euros.  The company is proposing a dividend of 4.50 euros a share
from last year’s profit, which almost doubled to 5.49 billion
euros. Allianz is holding its annual shareholders’ meeting in
Munich today.  Global insurance rates rose slightly on average in the
first quarter, with the U.S. seeing the biggest increase of 2
percent to 4 percent, insurance broker  Marsh & McLennan Cos. (MMC)
