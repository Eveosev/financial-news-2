India ’s rupee fell for a fourth day,
the longest losing streak since February, on concern capital
inflows will slow after the central bank said it sees limited
room to adjust policy to spur the economy. Bonds gained.  Reserve Bank  of India Governor Duvvuri Subbarao, who cut
 interest rates  on May 3 for a third time this year, said in an
interview with Bloomberg TV India a day later that the odds of
further monetary easing are “practically non-existent.” A drop
in fund inflows would leave the rupee more vulnerable to India’s
current-account deficit, according to  Federal Bank Ltd. (FB)  The
shortfall in the broadest measure of trade widened to a record
$32.6 billion in the last quarter of 2012.  “The biggest concern for the Indian economy and the rupee
is the current-account deficit,” said Ravi Ranjit, chief
manager in Mumbai at Federal Bank. “A more dovish rhetoric from
the RBI might have brought in some more inflows, but unless the
deficit contracts, the rupee will stay under pressure.”  The rupee declined 0.2 percent to 54.32 per dollar as of
9:38 a.m. in Mumbai, the longest losing streak since Feb. 11,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. One-month implied
volatility, a gauge of expected moves in the  exchange rate  used
to price options, fell six basis points to 8.52 percent.  Foreigners added $1.2 billion to their holdings of Indian
equities last month, the least since June, exchange data show.  The central bank lowered its  repurchase  rate to 7.25
percent from 7.5 percent last week, taking this year’s reduction
to 75 basis points, or 0.75 percentage point.  Rate Outlook  “The baseline case is that the possibility of easing is
practically non-existent,” Subbarao said in the Bloomberg TV
interview. Any expectation that the outlook is for “another
salvo” of loosening is “inaccurate,” he said, adding
inflation and the current-account gap will determine future
policy changes.  The current-account gap probably widened to an all-time
high of around 5 percent of gross domestic product in the fiscal
year ended March 31, the governor said in a conference call with
analysts yesterday, adding that the deficit is expected to
shrink in the current period.  The RBI will buy as much as 100 billion rupees ($1.8
billion) of debt due in 2017, 2024, 2025 and 2032 today, the
monetary authority said in an e-mailed statement after the
market closed on May 3.  The yield on the 8.15 percent bonds due June 2022 dropped
to 7.74 percent from 7.75 percent yesterday in Mumbai, according
to the central bank’s trading system.  Three-month onshore rupee forwards traded at 55.33 per
dollar, compared with 55.19 yesterday, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Offshore non-deliverable contracts were
at 55.03 versus 54.90. Forwards are agreements to buy or sell
assets at a set price and date. Non-deliverable contracts are
settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
