An envelope containing a suspicious
powder and a letter describing it as anthrax was received in the
clerk’s office at the federal courthouse in  Brooklyn ,  New York ,
court officials said.  The New York City fire and police departments responded to
the report today and are investigating the substance. The fire
department was called to the courthouse at 3:59 p.m., an
official with the department said.  The department said as many as 21 people are being
evaluated for exposure. As many as three people may need to be
decontaminated, said Charles Dunne,  U.S. Marshal for the Eastern
District of New York .  As of 5:30 p.m., a hallway leading to the clerk’s office in
the south wing of the courthouse had been taped off, and police,
firefighters and other emergency personnel were on the scene.  The building hadn’t been evacuated. A portion of the
elevators were temporarily shut down “due to police activity
that’s going on in our lobby,” according to a notice over the
court’s public address system.  To contact the reporters on this story:
