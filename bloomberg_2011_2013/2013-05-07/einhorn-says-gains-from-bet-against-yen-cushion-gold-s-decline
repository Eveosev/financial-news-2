Hedge fund manager David Einhorn said
first-quarter gains from betting against the Japanese currency
cushioned declines tied to gold, and told investors that
monetary policy affirms his strategy on both assets.  “The Bank of Japan officially joined the global monetary
printing race,” Einhorn said today on a conference call held by
his  Greenlight Capital Re Ltd. (GLRE)  reinsurer. “It seems that every
time a central banker takes a more aggressive action, without
short-term negative consequences, it reinforces the behavior of
other central bankers. We believe that recent events, including
the regime change at the Bank of Japan, support our long-term
thesis of both a weaker yen, and stronger gold.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
