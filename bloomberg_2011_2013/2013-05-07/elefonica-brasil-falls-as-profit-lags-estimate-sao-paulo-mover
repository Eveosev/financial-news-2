Telefonica Brasil SA, the nation’s
largest phone company by revenue, fell the most since November
after reporting that profit missed estimates as revenue from
fixed services slumped because of increased competition.  The Sao Paulo-based company, also known as Vivo, retreated
3.2 percent to 52.40 reais at the close of trading, the steepest
one-day drop since Nov. 26. It was the worst performance in the
benchmark  Ibovespa (IBOV) , which rose 1.5 percent.  First-quarter adjusted net income was 810.2 million reais
($402.8 million), according to data compiled by Bloomberg after
the company reported earnings before trading today. The average
 estimate  of nine analysts was for a profit of 949.9 million.  The result below forecasts “was attributable to struggling
landline business, whose deterioration accelerated whereas we
expected slight improvement,” Luis Azevedo and Tales Freire,
analysts at Banco Bradesco SA’s brokerage unit, wrote in a note
to clients today.  Revenue from fixed services such as phone, Internet and
cable television declined 8.9 percent to 2.9 billion reais in
the three months through March from a year earlier, Telefonica
said in a regulatory filing. The company cited tougher
competition because of bundled promotions. The decline was 3.1
percent in the fourth quarter.  The stock has gained 6.9 percent this year, compared with
the Ibovespa’s 7.7 percent decline. Vivo is the brand under
which Telefonica is reorganizing its mobile, fixed-line,  cable
television  and Internet services.  To contact the reporter on this story:
