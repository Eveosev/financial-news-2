Societe Generale SA (GLE) ,  France ’s second-
largest bank, said it plans to cut 550 jobs at its Paris
headquarters as part of additional cost reductions amid a slump
in European economies.  “We are currently in negotiation, in discussion with our
unions in France on a staff-reduction plan,” Deputy Chief
Executive Officer Severin Cabannes said in a Bloomberg
Television interview today. “The total impact for this first
step” will be 550 jobs, he said.  Societe Generale, which in February set out plans to
reorganize its main businesses into three units, is seeking
additional cost cuts at home after trimming about 1,600
corporate and investment banking jobs worldwide last year.  The bank plans to reach 900 million euros ($1.18 billion)
of additional savings by 2015 after 550 million euros in 2012,
bringing total expense reductions to 1.45 billion euros over the
period, it said in a statement today.  Societe Generale  is “streamlining” its activities around
French retail banking, international retail banking and
corporate and investment banking, Cabannes said. The company
seeks a “very strict management of external expenses” and is
continuing its “internal pooling of resources,” he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
