Hannover Re (HNR1) , the world’s fourth-
biggest reinsurer, said first-quarter profit dropped 15 percent
as lower interest rates and tougher competition weighed on
margins and the group did not repeat earlier unrealized gains.  Net income declined to 221.4 million euros ($289.6 million)
from 261.3 million euros a year ago, the Hanover, Germany-based
reinsurer said in a statement today. That beat the 211.3
million-euro average estimate of six analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg.  Hannover Re expects profit to decline to 800 million euros
from a record 858 million euros last year, it said in March.
After a drop in interest rates in 2012, Hannover Re said a goal
of a 3.4 percent return on investments this year was
“ambitious” and posted an annualized return of 3.2 percent for
the quarter as investment income dropped 20 percent.  “This results is a first successful step toward
accomplishing our full-year goal,” Chief Executive Officer
 Ulrich Wallin  said in an e-mailed statement today. “For the
current financial year, Hannover Re believes that both non-life
and life and health reinsurance offer sufficient growth
potential for the company to be able to achieve its goals.”  Underwriting profit in non-life more than doubled to 98.1
million euros after an “exceptionally untroubled major-loss
experience in the first quarter,” the group said.  Hannover Re’s shareholders meet for an annual general
meeting in Hanover today, when they will consider a dividend
payment for last year. In March, the company set the dividend
for 2012 at a record 2.60 euros a share plus a bonus of 0.40
euros, compared with 2.10 euros a share in 2011.  The shares have advanced 9.3 percent this year, lagging
behind a gain of 12 percent for the 28-company Bloomberg Europe
500 Insurance Index and valuing the firm at 7.77 billion euros.  German insurer  Talanx AG (TLX)  owns 50.2 percent of the firm.  To contact the reporters on this story:
