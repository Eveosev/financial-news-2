Fannie Mae (FNMA)  and  KPMG  LLP agreed to
settle an eight-year-old investor class action for $153 million,
according to Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine, whose state’s
employee pension fund was a plaintiff in the case.  Shareholders sued Washington-based  Fannie Mae  over a
$6.3 billion overstatement of earnings, alleging that the
company and accounting firm KPMG were involved in issuing false
and misleading financial reports in violation of federal
securities law.  The settlement announced today, which is subject to the
approval of a federal judge in Washington, is less than the
$10 billion then-Ohio Attorney General Marc Dann said Fannie Mae
investors were entitled to in 2007.  “Given the immediate and substantial benefit of
$153 million, the risk in establishing settling defendants’
liability and proving damages, and the potential limitation on
the ability of Fannie Mae to satisfy a judgment,” the
settlement “represents an outstanding recovery,” DeWine said
in memo filed in support of the proposed settlement.  Andrew Wilson , a Fannie Mae spokesman, didn’t immediately
reply to a phone message seeking comment.  “KPMG determined that it was in the firm’s best interest
to put this matter behind us and avoid the significant
additional cost, and the distraction and inherent uncertainty,
of protracted litigation,” Manuel Goncalves, the accounting
firm’s director of national media relations, said in an e-mailed
statement.  The case is Federal National Mortgage Association
Securities, Derivative and “ERISA” Litigation, 04-cv-01639,
U.S. District Court,  District of Columbia  (Washington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
