BRD-Groupe  Societe Generale SA (GLE) ,
 Romania ’s second-biggest bank by assets, said its first-quarter
profit fell 84 percent on rising bad-loan costs and lower fees.  Net income dropped to 13 million lei ($4 million) from 83
million lei in the year-earlier period, the Bucharest-based
lender said in a  regulatory statement  today. Bad-loan costs grew
4.2 percent in the first quarter from a year earlier, according
to the statement.  BRD, majority-owned by  France ’s Societe Generale SA, posted
its first loss last year since at least 2003, according to  stock
exchange data , mainly because of soaring bad-loan charges as a
stagnating economy made it difficult for citizens to repay
loans. The Romanian banking industry posted the third
consecutive year of losses in 2012.  “In the first quarter of 2013, the bank had operated in a
still difficult economic environment marked by low demand for
banking products and services,” it said in the statement. “The
risk cost continued to be strongly influenced by the adverse
environment and remained close to the level recorded in the
first quarter of 2012, but it dropped when compared with the
previous two quarters.”  BRD’s first-quarter net banking income, its main source of
revenue, dropped 11 percent to 687 million lei from 768 million
lei a year earlier, according to the statement. Operating
expenses declined 6.3 percent as BRD seeks to improve its cost-
income ratio, a measure of profitability, this year, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
