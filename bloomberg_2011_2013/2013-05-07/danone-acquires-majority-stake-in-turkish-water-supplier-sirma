Danone, owner of the Evian water
brand, acquired a 50.1 percent stake in Sirma to expand in
 Turkey ’s water market. No terms were disclosed.  Sirma has sales of almost 100 million euros ($131 million),
Paris-based Danone said today in an e-mailed statement. The
partnership agreement strengthens Danone’s bottled water
business in Turkey, where it’s already present with Hayat.  Danone, the world’s largest yogurt maker, said the
transaction will accelerate Sirma’s expansion in Turkey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
