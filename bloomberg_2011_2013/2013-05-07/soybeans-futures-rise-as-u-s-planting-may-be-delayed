Soybean futures gained for the second
time in three sessions on speculation that planting will be
delayed in the U.S., the world’s top exporter last year, because
winter-wheat collection will be later than normal.  About 2 percent of  soybeans  in the U.S. were planted as of
May 5, down from 22 percent last year and the five-year average
of 12 percent, the Department of Agriculture said yesterday.
Winter wheat was about 20 percent headed, compared with 64
percent in 2012 and the five-year average of 39 percent.  “We’re going to have a late wheat harvest, and that may
delay some of the bean planting,”  Mike Zuzolo, the president
of Global Commodity Analytics & Consulting in Lafayette,
 Indiana , said in a telephone interview.  Soybean futures for July delivery rose 0.9 percent to
$13.8175 a bushel at 11:46 a.m. on the Chicago Board of Trade.
The price through yesterday dropped 2.9 percent this year.  Wheat futures for July delivery rose 0.5 percent to $7.06 a
bushel. The price through yesterday dropped 9.7 percent this
year.  Growers normally start collecting winter wheat in late May
and early June. This year, crops are two to four weeks behind
normal development, Zuzolo said.  Corn futures for July delivery rose 0.9 percent to $6.425 a
bushel. Planting in the U.S., the largest grower, was 12 percent
completed in the week ended May 5, the slowest pace for that
week since 1984, according to the USDA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
