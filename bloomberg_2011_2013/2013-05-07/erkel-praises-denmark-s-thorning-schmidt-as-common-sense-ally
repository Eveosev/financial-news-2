Chancellor Angela Merkel  praised
Denmark as a German ally in talks on the European Union’s budget
and expressed regret that Germany’s northern neighbor hasn’t
joined the euro area.  Merkel made the off-the-cuff comments at a chamber of
commerce event near the northern German city of Rostock after
the host said Merkel and Danish Prime Minister Helle Thorning- Schmidt are from different political camps.  Thorning-Schmidt, a Social Democrat, is “extremely common-
sense” and “we work together very well” regardless of
political affiliation, said Merkel, a Christian Democrat.  While the Danes “unfortunately aren’t in the euro area,”
the country is “a very important friend and ally on many
European issues,” including the EU budget, Merkel said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
