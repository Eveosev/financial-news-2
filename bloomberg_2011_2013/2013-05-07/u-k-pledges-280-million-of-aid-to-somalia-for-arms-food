The U.K. has pledged 180 million
pounds ($280 million) to help Somalia tackle the threats of
famine and al-Qaeda, something Prime Minister David Cameron said
was essential to British security.  Britain will provide 35 million pounds to a fund to improve
security and governance, including sending military experts to
help develop the Somali army, and 145 million pounds for famine
relief.  The announcement came at the close of an international
conference hosted by Cameron to encourage support for the
African nation, which has become a base for al-Qaeda and piracy.  “This is not just vital for Somalia, this is vital for
Britain, for our national security,” Cameron told reporters.
“If we ignore it, we will be making the same mistakes in
Somalia that we made in  Afghanistan  in the 1990s.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
