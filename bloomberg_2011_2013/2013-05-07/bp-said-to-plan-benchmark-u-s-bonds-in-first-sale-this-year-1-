BP Plc (BP/)  sold $3 billion of dollar-
denominated bonds in its first offering this year.  BP Capital Markets, a unit of  Europe ’s second-largest oil
company, issued $250 million of five-year, floating rate debt to
yield 51 basis points more than the three-month London interbank
offered rate, $1.25 billion of 1.375 percent, five-year notes to
pay 68 basis points more than similar-maturity Treasuries and
$1.5 billion of 2.75 percent, 10-year securities at a relative
yield of 108 basis points, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  The bonds may be rated A2 by Moody’s Investors Service,
according to a person familiar with the transaction. The
floating portion was added after BP began marketing the sale
today, said the person, who asked not to be identified because
terms aren’t set.  The company last sold debt in November, issuing $1 billion
each of 0.7 percent, three-year securities at a relative yield
of 35 basis points; 1.375 percent, five-year debt at 65 basis
points; and 2.5 percent, 10-year bonds at 85, Bloomberg data
show.  The bonds due November 2022 traded at 98.723 cents on the
dollar to yield 2.65 percent on May 3, according to Trace, the
bond-price reporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority.  Royal Dutch Shell Plc is Europe’s biggest oil company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
