A panel of Indian lawmakers proposed
dropping a clause from planned mining laws that requires coal
and lignite companies to share their profits with local
communities and pay for development projects where they operate.  Companies mining the two fossil fuels should instead
contribute an amount equal to the royalty paid to state
governments for mineral extraction during the fiscal year, the
cross-party group said today in a report tabled in parliament.
That would put them in the same position as miners of iron ore
and other commodities under the Mines and Mineral (Development
and Regulation) Bill, 2011.  If accepted by the government and approved by parliament,
the recommendation may reduce the financial burden the
legislation imposes on miners including  Coal India Ltd. (COAL) , the
world’s largest producer. Under the existing draft legislation,
coal miners had to set aside 26 percent of their profits. The
government is setting up a fund to address concerns that local
people don’t benefit from environmentally damaging mining
operations.  Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is aiming to replace an act
passed by lawmakers in 1957 and to win support for industry from
local people who have protested the setting up of facilities on
land near their communities. In some parts of eastern and
central  India , anger over resource exploitation has helped
Maoist rebels recruit support.  To contact the reporters on this story:
