Swiss unemployment held at the highest
level in two years in April, indicating that the economy remains
vulnerable to the strong franc.  The  jobless rate , adjusted for seasonal swings, was
unchanged at 3.1 percent, the State Secretariat for Economic
Affairs in Bern said in an e-mailed statement today. That’s in
line with the  median estimate  of 11 economists in a Bloomberg
News survey. The unadjusted jobless rate fell to 3.1 percent
from 3.2 percent.  Switzerland has managed to escape the slump that has
befallen the 17-nation euro area, thanks in part to a cap of
1.20 per euro on the franc set by the Swiss National Bank in
September 2011. The central bank cited the need to shield the
economy from deflation and a recession for the move.  The number of job openings in the country increased by 113
to 16,135 in April, today’s report showed. A total of 190,367
people were looking for a job, 3,857 fewer than in the previous
month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
