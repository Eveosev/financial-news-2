BlackBerry (BBRY)  dropped the most in almost
a month after Pacific Crest Securities said the Canadian
smartphone maker may have to cut back production of its
BlackBerry 10 devices because of lower-than-expected sales.  BlackBerry declined 4.8 percent to $14.82 at the close in
 New York , the biggest one-day drop since April 11. The shares
are up 25 percent this year, outpacing the 14 percent gain of
the Standard & Poor’s Index.  The company, based in Waterloo, Ontario, is counting on its
BlackBerry 10 software platform to revive sales after ceding
 market share  to operating systems by Apple Inc. and Google Inc.  BlackBerry is still maintaining production levels of 1.5
million to 2 million devices a month,  James Faucette , a Pacific
Crest analyst, said in a research note today. With estimated
sales of about 1 million to 1.25 million units in each of the
last two months, BlackBerry will have to reduce manufacturing at
some point, Faucette said.  “BlackBerry will look to continue aggressively filling the
channel,” said Faucette, who has the equivalent of a sell
rating on the shares. “However, as we detect retailers and
carriers carrying lower inventory levels without an accompanying
reacceleration in sales, we would conclude that production cuts
are likely for the company.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
