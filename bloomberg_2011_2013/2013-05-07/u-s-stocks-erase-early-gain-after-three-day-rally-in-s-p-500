U.S. stocks erased early gains that
had sent the Standard & Poorâ€™s 500 Index to a record level for a
fourth straight day.  The  S&P 500  fell less than 0.1 percent to 1,616.7 at 10:20
a.m. in New York after gaining as much as 0.4 percent earlier.
Technology and financial shares were the biggest drag on the
index, while telephone and utility companies rose the most among
the 10 main groups.  The S&P 500 advanced 0.2 percent to a record yesterday
after the benchmark gauge for U.S. equities topped 1,600 for the
first time on May 3. U.S. stocks are in the fifth year of a  bull
market  amid better-than-estimated corporate earnings and three
rounds of bond purchases by the Federal Reserve. The S&P 500 has
rallied 13 percent in 2013.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
