OAO RusHydro, the Russian renewable
energy producer that has lost about 40 percent of market value
in the past year, rallied in Moscow and  New York  as company
officials take advantage of the decline to buy back stock.  American depositary receipts  of the state-run power company
jumped 4 percent to a one-month high of $1.84 in New York,
following a 1.3 percent advance of the stock on Moscow’s  Micex
Index (INDEXCF)  to the highest close since April 2. RusHydro led gains on
the Bloomberg Russia-US Equity Index of the most-traded Russian
stocks in the U.S., which was little changed at 95.37.  RusHydro, which slumped to a record low in New York April
19, follows OAO Lukoil and  CTC Media Inc. (CTCM) , Russian companies
planning buybacks or whose executives have purchased shares as
the Micex gauge slid to the cheapest level since June last
month. George Rizhinashvili, a RusHydro deputy chairman, boosted
his stake almost sixfold since November, company filings showed,
and management may buy more stock, according to Timur
Ahmedzhanov, head of  investor relations .  “When management votes for the stock with its own ruble,
there could be no better reason for the market to reconsider the
stock,”  Mark Rubinstein , head of research at IFC Metropol in
Moscow, said in a telephone interview yesterday. “It’s a very
positive sign. Management knows better than analysts how the
company is really doing.”  RTS Index  futures  were little changed in U.S. hours at
140,740. The Market Vectors  Russia  ETF, the largest dedicated
Russian exchange-traded fund, decreased 0.6 percent to $27.13.
The RTS Volatility Index, which measures expected swings in
futures, fell 1.4 percent to 20.40.  Boosting Stake  RusHydro rose to 58.33 kopeks, or 1.9 cents, in Moscow
yesterday. Rizhinashvili increased his stake to 0.017 percent
from 0.0029 percent in November, when he first bought shares of
RusHydro, according to regulatory filings.  “Management knows the company really well and they spend
their own bonuses to buy the stock,” Ahmedzhanov, Moscow-based
head of investment relations at the company, said by phone
yesterday. “Investors like that.”  RusHydro has tumbled 51 percent in Moscow from last year’s
high on March 5 as the government limits power tariff increases
and the Interior Ministry probes alleged embezzlement at the
company. Vladimir Pekhtin, who resigned from the lower house of
parliament in February after bloggers published documents
showing he owned luxury property in Miami, has been approved to
RusHydro’s board, according to a statement last month.  2012 Dividend  RusHydro is expected to decide on its 2012 dividends by the
end of the month, according to Moscow-based analysts Sergey
Beiden at Otkritie Financial Corp. and Fedor Kornachev at ZAO
Raiffeisenbank. The company, which posted an adjusted net income
of 31.8 billion rubles ($1.02 billion) last year, paid about 10
percent profit in dividends in 2011, Beiden said. Russia
requires that all government-backed companies pay no less than a
quarter of profit as dividends.  There is a “good chance” the company will meet the
government’s requirement already for its 2012 dividends,
Otkritie’s Beiden said.  CTC Media Inc., the Nasdaq-listed Russian television
network, gained 0.4 percent to $11.40 in New York, the biggest
advance since April 29. The board approved a 2.5 million share
buyback program, Chief Executive Officer Boris Podolsky said on
a March 6 conference call.  OAO Lukoil is “ready” to buy back shares when the price
falls, Deputy Vice-President Andrei Gaidamaka said in November.
Chief Executive Officer  Vagit Alekperov  and his deputy  Leonid Fedun  spent $260 million to buy the oil producer’s shares,
according to December regulatory filings.  Lukoil Gains  Lukoil rose 0.1 percent to $64.73 in New York yesterday,
while adding 0.6 percent to 2,014.90 rubles, or $64.90, in
Moscow.  Russia’s Micex Index trades at 5.3 times estimated
earnings, the lowest valuation among 21  emerging markets  tracked
by Bloomberg. That compares with a valuation of 10.8 for
 Brazil ’s Bovespa index and 9.2 times for  the Shanghai Composite
Index . The Russian gauge rose 0.4 percent to 1,413.43 yesterday
in a second day of gains.  Ruble futures showed the currency unchanged at 31.99 per
dollar in U.S. hours. Russia’s ruble gained less than 0.1
percent to 31.04 per dollar yesterday and rose 0.2 percent to
35.3305 against the dollar-euro basket used by the central bank
to manage swings that erode exporter competitiveness.  Crude oil for June delivery increased 0.6 percent to $96.16
a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  yesterday. Brent
oil for June settlement added 1.3 percent to $105.46 a barrel.
 Urals crude , Russia’s major export oil blend, jumped 2.9 percent
to $104.83 per barrel.  United Co. Rusal, the world’s largest aluminum producer,
rose 2.3 percent to HK$4.03 in Hong Kong trading as of 10:13
a.m. local time. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index gained 1.1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
