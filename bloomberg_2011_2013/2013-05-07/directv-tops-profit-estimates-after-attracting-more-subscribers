DirecTV (DTV) , the largest U.S. satellite-television provider, rose the most in four years to an all-time
high after reporting first-quarter profit that topped estimates,
bolstered by Latin American subscriber growth.  DirecTV shares  surged 6.9 percent to $61.95 at the close in
 New York , the biggest one-day gain since March 23, 2009.  Charter
Communications Inc. (CHTR) , another pay-TV provider, also jumped on
better-than-predicted earnings. Its stock climbed 4.4 percent to
$109.69, also a record closing price.  DirecTV is counting on its  Latin America  expansion to fuel
growth -- a bet that paid off last quarter. The company added
583,000 customers in the region, beating the 505,000 predicted
by analysts. It also added 21,000 U.S. subscribers, better than
the 10,000 estimated. That may help reassure investors who have
been concerned that growth is sputtering.  “DirecTV reported results that were better than expected,
due to balanced growth and profitability in Latin America,”
 Vijay Jayant , an analyst at ISI Group in New York, said in a
note to clients.  Excluding one-time costs, DirecTV’s  profit  was $1.43,
topping the $1.09 average estimate of analysts compiled by
Bloomberg. Sales rose 7.6 percent to $7.58 billion, the El
Segundo, California-based company said today in a statement,
beating the average analyst estimate of $7.52 billion.  The uptick in customers coincides with a U.S. rate increase
of 4.5 percent on average, driving revenue per user to $96.05.
Still, net income fell to $690 million, or $1.20 a share, from
$731 million, or $1.07, a year earlier. Mounting programming
costs and  Venezuela ’s currency devaluation led to the decline in
profitability.  Stock Buybacks  DirecTV repurchased $1.38 billion in stock in the quarter,
helping boost the per-share earnings figure. The company’s pace
of buybacks has exceeded that of its cable-TV rivals, a sign of
strength for the company, said  Todd Mitchell , an analyst at
Brean Capital LLC in New York. He has a buy rating on DirecTV
shares.  DirecTV will probably lose subscribers in the second
quarter, Chief Executive Officer Mike White said during a
conference call. The company lost customers in last year’s
second quarter, the first ever quarterly decline in DirecTV’s
history.  Average revenue per user will be higher in the second half
of this year as customers pay more for products such as the
company’s Genie high-definition digital recording device, White
said. DirecTV’s stock has gained 24 percent this year.  Charter Earnings  Billionaire  John Malone  is DirecTV’s fifth-largest
investor, holding 27.7 million shares. This month, the media
mogul bought 27 percent of Charter, the fourth-largest U.S.
cable company.  Charter’s net loss of $42 million, or 42 cents a share,
narrowed from $94 million, or 95 cents, a year earlier. Sales
rose 4.9 percent to $1.92 billion, the  Stamford , Connecticut-based company said in a statement, matching the average analyst
estimate. Charter added 99,000 Internet and 59,000 telephone
subscribers in the period, though it lost 24,000 TV customers.  Charter’s shares are up 44 percent this year. Analysts are
 predicting  that Charter will become a profitable company next
year for the first time since emerging from bankruptcy in 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
