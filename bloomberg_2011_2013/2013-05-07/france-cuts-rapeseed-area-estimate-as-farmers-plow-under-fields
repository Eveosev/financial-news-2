France  cut the estimate for this
year’s rapeseed area after poor crop development caused by
excessive winter rains prompted farmers to plow under fields.  French rapeseed planting fell an estimated 8 percent to
1.48 million hectares (3.65 million acres) from 1.61 million
hectares a year earlier, the  Agriculture Ministry  wrote in an
 online report  yesterday. That’s down from last month’s outlook
for 1.52 million hectares of the oilseed.  March was unusually cold and wet, with precipitation that
was 52 percent above normal, the ministry reported last month.
France is the European Union’s largest grower of rapeseed, wheat
and barley.  “The rainy winter and spring penalized the winter crops in
the northern half of France, going so far as to sometimes prompt
the plowing under of plots,” the ministry wrote. “The humid
and cold month of March has delayed their development, as well
as sowing of spring crops.”  France’s soft-wheat area is estimated to rise 2.4 percent
to 4.98 million hectares, similar to last month’s outlook, while
the outlook for the barley area was little changed at 1.6
million hectares, falling 5.1 percent from 2012 as less spring
barley was planted.  Corn planting is predicted to be little changed at 1.72
million hectares, according to the ministry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
