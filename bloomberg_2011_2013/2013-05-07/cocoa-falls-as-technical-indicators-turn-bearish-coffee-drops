Cocoa fell in London and extended
declines in  New York  as technical indicators turned bearish amid
sufficient global supplies. Coffee retreated.  Cocoa climbed 9 percent so far this year on NSYE Liffe and
7.3 percent on ICE as money managers boosted bets on higher
prices because of “improving chart patterns,” broker INTL
FCStone Inc. said in a report e-mailed today. Technical
indicators look “remotely bearish for the first time in several
sessions,” Sterling Smith, a futures specialist at Citigroup
Inc. in  Chicago , said in a report e-mailed yesterday.  “We remain somewhat cautious on the markets going into the
summer months, as outside of  Indonesia , there does not seem to
be any pressing supply issues,” FCStone said. “We think prices
will struggle to take out $2,570 a ton mark in May, while a
possible correction could take us down to $2,270 a ton.”  Cocoa for July delivery fell 0.2 percent to 1,564 pounds
($2,430) a metric ton by 10:27 a.m. on NYSE Liffe in  London . The
exchange was closed yesterday for holidays. Cocoa for July
delivery slipped 0.1 percent to $2,399 a ton on ICE Futures U.S.
in New York, after dropping as much as 1.3 percent yesterday.  Money managers boosted bets on rising prices of London
cocoa to the highest level in almost five months in the week
ended April 23, according to NYSE Liffe. The net-long position
rose to 39,764 futures and options contracts in the period, up
from 27,305 contracts a week earlier and the highest net-long
position since Dec. 4, exchange data showed. NYSE Liffe will
update trader holdings data later today.  Indonesia, Ghana  Cocoa shipments from Indonesia’s Sulawesi fell to 5,905
tons in April from 8,662 tons a month earlier, Firman Bakri,
executive secretary at the Indonesian Cocoa Association, said on
May 1. Indonesia is the third-biggest cocoa producer after  Ivory
Coast  and  Ghana .  “We are not as bullish on the tropicals, since the markets
are well supplied in the case of sugar and coffee, while cocoa
seems to be rising more on technicals than anything else, with
no signs of any pressing supply issues,” FCStone said.  Robusta coffee futures for delivery in July slipped 0.1
percent to $2,019 a ton on NYSE Liffe. Arabica coffee futures
for July delivery fell 0.1 percent to $1.4165 a pound on ICE.  White, or refined, sugar for delivery in August rose 0.2
percent to $497.70 a ton in London. Raw sugar for delivery in
July fell 0.6 percent to 17.71 cents a pound in New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
