Mitsui & Co. (8031) , the most reliant of
Japan’s six major trading houses on commodities for profit,
forecast a weakening yen to be the biggest contributor to its
net income this year.  Mitsui forecast net income to gain 62.1 billion yen ($623
million) to 370 billion yen in the year to March 31 from the
previous period, according to a statement today. The
depreciating yen alone will help contribute 65 billion yen to
profit for the year, the Tokyo-based trader said.  Higher copper and coal sales will add another 15 billion
yen to profit, while higher operating costs at resource assets
and lower commodity prices will reduce profit by 48 billion yen,
Mitsui said.  Policies to promote a weaker yen and the return of their
backer Shinzo Abe as  Japan ’s prime minister in December have
caused the currency to fall more than 20 percent in the past six
months, the most among the 10 developed-market currencies
tracked by Bloomberg Correlation Weighted Indexes. The dollar
rose 1.2 percent and the euro 3.9 percent in the period. Mitsui
expects the yen to average 95 to the dollar in the year to March
31.  The dollar will likely strengthen in the second half of
this year, Mitsui’s Chief Financial Officer Joji Okada said at a
briefing in Tokyo today.  Mitsui gained 4.3 percent, the most in more than six months,
to 1,374 yen at the close in Tokyo today.  Oil Forecast  The trader, the largest in Japan after  Mitsubishi Corp. (8058) ,
forecast oil dropping to an average $103 per barrel from $114,
and copper falling to $7,500 a ton in  London  from $7,950 in the
previous 12 months. It expects to pay a dividend of 51 yen per
share this year, maintaining the 25 percent payout ratio from
the previous year.  Net income fell 29 percent last year to 307.9 billion yen
on lower iron ore and coal prices, the company reported today.
That’s less than the company’s 310 billion yen target and below
the 324 billion yen average of 17 analyst estimates compiled by
Bloomberg. Mitsui’s innovation division, which includes media
and information technology assets, and machinery were the only
two units to post a profit increase.  To contact the reporter on this story:
