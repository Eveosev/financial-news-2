Treasuries declined, with 10-year
yields at the highest level in three weeks, before U.S. sells
$32 billion of three-year notes today, the first of three
auctions this week for $72 billion.  Yields on 10-year notes rose the most in seven months after
the Labor Department said May 3 that the U.S. added more jobs
than forecast last month and the  unemployment rate  fell to a
four-year low. The securities are at almost the least expensive
in a month, according to the 10-year term premium. The U.S. is
scheduled to sell $24 billion of 10-year debt tomorrow and $16
billion of 30-year bonds on May 9.  “Given the employment report, the market’s a lot
cheaper,” said  Ray Remy , head of fixed income in New York at
Daiwa Capital Markets America Inc., one of 21 primary dealers
that trade directly with the  Federal Reserve . “The market’s
pulled back nicely. It’s a good environment for the auctions.”  The U.S. 10-year note  yield  climbed two basis points, or
0.02 percentage point, to 1.78 percent at 11:51 a.m. in New
York, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 2 percent
security due in February 2023 fell 6/32, or $1.88 per $1,000
face amount, to 101 31/32. The yield climbed to the highest
since April 12.  The 10-year yield traded above its 200-day moving average
for a second day, an indication it may rise.  Market Value  The 10-year term premium, a model that includes
expectations for  interest rates , growth and inflation, was at
minus 0.73 percent, the closest to zero since April 2. A
negative reading indicates investors are willing to accept
yields below what’s considered fair value.  Yields surged last week, with the 10-year rising 11 basis
points, as stronger-than-forecast jobs data increased optimism
that the  U.S. economy  is gathering pace.  “The number on Friday was a good number, and pushed back
some of the deflation concerns,  but it wasn’t a homerun
number,” said Jason Rogan, director of U.S. government trading
at Guggenheim Partners LLC, a New York-based brokerage for
institutional investors. “We are still in a range and how the
auctions are dealt with will determine where we go from here,
especially the long end auctions.”  Bidding has slowed at Treasury auctions this year, with the
$721 billion in debt sales attracting an average of $3.01 in
orders to buy per dollar of debt sold, compared with a record
$3.15 in 2012, according to data released by the Treasury and
compiled by Bloomberg.  Auction Analysis  The April three-year note offering’s  bid-to-cover  ratio was
3.24, after reaching a record 3.96 at the October sale. The
average at the past 10 auctions was 3.57.  Indirect bidders, a class of investors that includes
foreign central banks, bought 19 percent of the notes at the
April 9 sale after being awarded 20.6 percent the month before.
That compared with an average of 25.8 percent at the past 10
offerings.  Direct bidders , non-primary-dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, purchased 16.2 percent of
the securities at the last sale, compared with a record high
26.9 percent at the February offering and an average of 19.5
percent at the past 10 auctions.  The sales will raise $12.4 billion of new cash, as maturing
securities held by the public total $59.6 billion, according to
the Treasury.  Budget Talks  President  Barack Obama  on Feb. 4 signed legislation
suspending the $16.4 trillion debt limit through May 18. The
Treasury said on May 1 it can use “extraordinary measures” to
meet its obligations and to stay under the ceiling “for a
period of time after May 19.”  Investors will favor U.S. shares over bonds, said  Jeremy Siegel , a professor at the  University of Pennsylvania ’s Wharton
School and author of the book “ Stocks for the Long Run .” Job
gains will lead Fed officials to consider scaling back bond
purchases, known as quantitative easing, he said.  The Fed is buying $85 billion of Treasury and mortgage debt
a month to support the economy by putting downward pressure on
borrowing costs. The central bank bought $1.5 billion of
Treasuries due from February 2036 to February 2043 today,
according to the Fed Bank of New York’s  website .  “You’re going to get some continued rotation out of bonds,
out of bank accounts, out of money funds,” Siegel said
yesterday on Bloomberg Television’s “Street Smart” with  Trish Regan  and  Adam Johnson . “All we need is a couple more strong
employment figures. You’re going to hear more people from the
Fed saying, ‘Yeah maybe we should taper off QE.’ You’re going to
see that 10-year note go to 2.5 percent before you can turn
around.”  Treasuries have fallen 0.5 percent this month as of
yesterday, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes.
The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  returned  1.3 percent including
reinvested dividends, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “We have had a big shift with the jobs print,” said Barra Sheridan, a rates trader at Bank of Montreal in  London .
“Momentum is going to be negative for Treasuries this week.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
