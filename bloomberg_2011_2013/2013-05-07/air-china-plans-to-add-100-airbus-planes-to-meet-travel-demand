Air China Ltd. (1055) , Asia’s biggest carrier
by market value, plans to add 100 Airbus SAS planes to help meet
rising travel demand.  The board approved the expansion for the company and its
units, Air  China  said in a statement yesterday. The Beijing-
based airline didn’t specify a timeframe or the type of aircraft
it’s buying.  Carriers in China will need 5,260 new planes worth $670
billion through 2031, Boeing Co. forecast in September. China
has become the world’s biggest source of tourists, overtaking
 Germany  and the U.S., after its citizens increased the number of
outbound trips by 18 percent last year, according to the
Beijing-based China Tourism Academy in April.  “We see the order as positive,” Credit Suisse AG analysts
led by Davin Wu wrote in a  note  to clients today. “We believe
that the orders are mainly narrow-body A320 aircraft for short-
haul routes.”  Air China  rose  1.3 percent to close at HK$6.79 in  Hong
Kong . Its shares traded in Shanghai gained 1.5 percent to 5.51
 yuan .  Air China also said yesterday that its board approved the
early disposal of six A340 planes, a four-engine wide-body jet
that Airbus stopped manufacturing following slack demand. The
carrier, which had a fleet of 301 aircraft at the end of
December, is due to receive 113 planes in the three years
through 2015, it said in March.  To contact the reporter on this story:
