U.S. crude  inventories  probably rose
from a 82-year high as domestic output remained near the most in
two decades and demand fell, a Bloomberg survey showed.  Stockpiles grew by 2 million barrels, or 0.5 percent, to
397.3 million, the most since 1931, according to the median of
11 analyst estimates before an Energy Information Administration
report tomorrow. Ten respondents forecast an increase and one no
change in the inventories.  U.S. oil  production , which climbed to the highest level
since 1992 in April, has exceeded 7 million barrels a day since
early February, according to the EIA, the Energy Department’s
statistical arm.  Gasoline demand  slumped 3.8 percent to 8.42
million barrels a day in the week ended April 26 and imports
rose 8 percent.  “Domestic production continues its relentless rise,” Bill O’Grady, chief market strategist at Confluence Investment
Management in  St. Louis , which oversees $1.4 billion, said in a
telephone interview. “Driving activity remains pretty slack.
You are just going to have a lot of crude oil.”  West  Texas  Intermediate crude for June delivery extended
gains yesterday after rising 1.7 percent to $95.61 on May 3,
when the Labor Department said the U.S. unemployment rate fell
to a four-year low. The contract was down 75 cents, or 0.8
percent, at $95.41 at 10:33 a.m. on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange .  Production Slips  U.S. oil  production  was 7.31 million barrels a day in the
week ended April 26, down from a 21-year high of 7.33 million
the previous week. Output levels were 19 percent more than a
year ago.  “You are going to see increases in domestic production,”
said Tom Finlon, Jupiter, Florida-based director of Energy
Analytics Group LLC. “The long-term trend on domestic
production expectations is intact.”  Oil  stockpiles  jumped 6.7 million barrels a day to 395.3
million, the most since 1931. The EIA compiled inventories
monthly beginning in 1920 and weekly starting in 1982.  A combination of horizontal drilling and hydraulic
fracturing, or fracking, has unlocked supplies trapped in shale
formations in states including  North Dakota ,  Oklahoma  and Texas.
Crude output in North Dakota surged to 779,000 barrels a day in
February, up 39 percent from a year earlier.  Rising oil production helped the U.S. meet 84 percent of
its energy needs last year, the most since 1991, according to
the EIA. The measure of self-sufficiency increased to 88 percent
in December, the highest level since February 1987.  ‘Changing World’  “U.S. production is changing the energy world as we know
it,” said  Phil Flynn , senior market analyst at the Price
Futures Group in  Chicago . “Supply is outpacing demand.”  U.S.  gasoline consumption  was 3.2 percent lower than a year
earlier in the week ended April 26.  Total petroleum demand 
dropped 3.6 percent to 17.9 million barrels a day, the lowest
level since March 15.  The gains in oil inventories came mostly from rising
imports, Finlon said.  Imports jumped 602,000 a day, or 8 percent, to 8.17 million
barrels, the most since Jan. 4. In the first 17 weeks of 2013,
imports have averaged 7.77 million barrels a day, down 12
percent from a year earlier.  Imports from  Kuwait   rose  411,000 barrels a day and Nigeria
imports gained 351,000 barrels. Shipments from  Canada  declined
359,000 barrels a day.  “The flow that we saw, the sharp increase from Kuwait, is
likely to continue,” Finlon said. The drop in Canada shipments
“was temporary in nature. It will recover.”  Refinery Rates  The Bloomberg survey also showed that U.S. refineries
operated at a rate of 84.9 percent last week, up 0.5 percentage
point from a week ago. The utilization  rate  was 86.4 percent a
year earlier.  “I am not looking for enough of a pickup in refining
activity to offset supply gains,” O’Grady said.  Tesoro Corp. (TSO)  said on April 29 that its 58,000-barrel-a-day
Salt Lake City refinery is undergoing planned maintenance.
 Valero Energy Corp. (VLO)  on April 27 reported planned maintenance in
the 170,000-barrel-a-day McKee refinery in Texas.  The Bloomberg survey also forecast that inventories of
 distillate fuel , a category that includes heating oil and
diesel, rose 500,000 barrels, or 0.4 percent, to 116.3 million.
Eight analysts forecast a gain and three a drop.  Gasoline  stockpiles  probably slipped 450,000 barrels, or
0.2 percent, to 215.5 million, according to the survey. Seven
respondents predicted a decrease, two a gain and two no change.  The EIA is scheduled to release the weekly report at 10:30
a.m. tomorrow in  Washington .  To contact the reporter on this story:
