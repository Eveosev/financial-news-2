Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s services in Syria are
now inaccessible, the operator of the world’s most popular
search engine said.  Google’s transparency  report , which tracks the status of
Google products available to users around the world, showed a
dropoff in  Internet traffic  in Syria, which is in the midst of a
civil war. Services became inaccessible just before 3 p.m. New
York time, according to the report.  Umbrella Security Labs, part of Web traffic-services
provider OpenDNS Inc., also  reported  a “significant drop in
traffic from Syria.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
