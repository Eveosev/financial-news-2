The Defense Department is looking for
ways to cut the size and budgets for agencies and staff that
provide support to the active-duty military, Deputy Defense
Secretary  Ashton Carter  said.  The Pentagon is “driving down the tail to strengthen the
tooth,” Carter said today at the  National Press Club  in
Washington.  The support functions include members of the Office of the
Secretary of Defense, personnel assisting the Joint Chiefs of
Staff, people working with combatant commanders and employees of
the defense agencies, Carter said. The group represents  “a
fifth of the department’s  budget  and merits at least as much
scrutiny as the military services,” he said.  The Pentagon is seeking $526.6 billion in its 2014 budget,
a request that assumes President  Barack Obama  and Congress will
find a way to call off the automatic budget cuts called
sequestration.  Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel has asked Carter and General
Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, to
conduct a review of strategic choices in light of a $1 trillion
reduction in the Pentagon’s planned spending over the next
decade. The review is due to be completed by May 31.  The Pentagon also faces the possibility of requiring as
many as 750,000 civilian employees to go on unpaid leave because
of automatic budget cuts that will force the department to cut
$37 billion from its budget for the current fiscal year ending
Sept. 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
