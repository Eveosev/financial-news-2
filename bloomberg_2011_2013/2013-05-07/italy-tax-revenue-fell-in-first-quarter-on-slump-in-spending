Italian tax revenue fell 0.3 percent
in the first quarter as the countryâ€™s two-year recession
continues to erode  consumer spending .  Total tax revenue in the first three months through March
amounted to 87.8 billion euros ($114.9 billion), down 223
million euros from the same quarter last year, according to a
report by the  Finance Ministry  posted on its website.  Indirect taxes fell 7.4 percent, or by about 3 billion
euros, with revenue from the value-added tax dropping 8.6
percent. The fall was only partially offset by an increase of
direct taxes of 5.9 percent, or 2.8 billion euros.  Italian household spending has contracted as the country
remains mired in its longest  recession  in more than two decades.
With unemployment remaining near a 20-year high, the new
government has pledged a series of tax cuts to boost growth and
create jobs. Prime Minister Enrico Letta has also said he will
seek to postpone a 1 percentage point increases in the value-
added tax due in July.  Income tax accounted for 50.3 percent of revenue in the
first quarter, up from 49.3 percent the previous year. Value-
added tax fell to 22.9 percent of the total from 25 percent a
year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
