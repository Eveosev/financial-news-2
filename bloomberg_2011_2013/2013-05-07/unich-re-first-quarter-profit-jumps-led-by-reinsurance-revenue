Munich Re , the world’s biggest
reinsurer, said first-quarter profit jumped 25 percent, beating
estimates, after reinsurance revenue rose and it reported no
major losses from natural catastrophes.  Net income climbed to 972 million euros ($1.27 billion)
from 780 million euros a year-earlier, the Munich-based company
said in a statement today. That compared with a 932 million-euro
median estimate of seven analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Munich Re, led by Chief Executive Officer Nikolaus von Bomhard is benefitting from the absence of major catastrophes
and stable prices. While lower  interest rates  depress revenue,
prices will be unchanged this year, according to a report from
Aon Benfield, the world’s largest reinsurance broker.  “There happened to be lower claims burdens from major
losses, but the Group’s operating earnings also proved to be
robust,” Chief Financial Officer Joerg Schneider said in the
statement. “After this good start, we are optimistic of
achieving our profit target for the year of close to 3 billion
euros.”  Munich Re’s shares rose 8.7 percent this year, valuing the
company at 26.5 billion euros. That compared with a 12 percent
increase for the 28-company Bloomberg Europe 500 Insurance Index
and an 11 percent advance for Zurich-based  Swiss Re Ltd, (SREN)  the
world’s second-biggest reinsurer.  The firm’s reinsurance unit posted a profit for the first
quarter rising 30 percent to 827 million euros. Premium
income advanced 1.8 percent to 7 billion euros. Natural 
catastrophe losses were 24 million euros compared with 41 
million euros a year previously, while man-made losses fell to
81 million euros from 223 million euros.  Investment income fell to 2 billion euros from 2.24 billion
euros in the first quarter of 2012, matching the 2 billion-euro
median estimate of nine analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. A return
on investments of 3.6 percent for the quarter compares with a
full-year target of about 3.3 percent.  The company’s combined ratio in property and casualty
reinsurance improved to 86 percent from 95 percent a year ago. A
ratio above 100 percent means claims and costs exceed premium
income, leaving a loss from underwriting.  To contact the reporter on this story:
