Kenya ’s shilling headed for the
biggest drop in two months as speculators increased demand for
dollars on expectations that the central bank will cut its
benchmark  interest rate .  The currency of  East Africa ’s biggest economy weakened as
much as 1.5 percent and traded 0.3 percent lower at 83.94 per
dollar by 2:35 p.m. in the capital, Nairobi, the most on a
closing basis since March 6.  Kenya’s Monetary Policy Committee, led by central bank
Governor Njuguna Ndung’u, will probably reduce the benchmark
interest rate by 25 basis points to 9.25 percent, according to
the median estimate of eight economists surveyed by Bloomberg.
Four predict the rate will stay unchanged, while forecasts for a
cut range from 50 basis points to 100 basis points.  The MPC left the key lending rate unchanged at 9.5 percent
at the last meeting in March.  “When the rate is cut for economic growth, businesses
borrow shillings, but use them to buy dollars to import goods,
since we are a net importer,” Duncan Kinuthia, head of trading
at Nairobi-based Commercial Bank of Africa Ltd., said by phone.
“There has also been some build up in corporate demand for
dollars.”  Uganda ’s shilling depreciated 0.2 percent at 2,559 per
dollar. Tanzania’s shilling weakened as much as 0.2 percent
before trading unchanged at 1,628 per dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
