U.S. Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew
called for an end to federal spending cuts known as
sequestration, a narrower  budget deficit , and adoption of the
Obama administration’s proposal to boost employment and economic
growth.  “It is time to put that sensible plan in place so that
more Americans can get back to work and more businesses can
innovate, expand and hire,” Lew said in a statement released
during his trip to  Cleveland  today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
