SandRidge Energy Inc. (SD) , the energy
producer that added four board members under pressure from TPG-
Axon Capital Management LP, said its first-quarter loss widened
as it sold assets.  The company had a net loss of $493.2 million, or $1.03 a
share, compared with a loss of $232.1 million, or 58 cents, a
year earlier, Oklahoma City-based SandRidge said in a statement
on PR Newswire. Excluding a $398 million loss on asset sales and
other one-time items, SandRidge broke even, compared with
forecasts for a 5-cent loss, the average of 24 analysts’
estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  SandRidge said it will have $1.45 billion in capital
expenses in 2013, $700 million lower than 2012, as it tries to
concentrate on drilling the best acreage in the Mississippi Lime
oil field, according to the statement. It reduced its full-year
production forecast to the equivalent of 32.7 million barrels of
oil from 34.3 million earlier this year.  Revenue from oil and natural gas production rose 40 percent
to $478 million from a year ago, according to the statement.
Production costs rose to $14.73 per barrel from $13.77 as
higher-cost oil from its offshore wells made up a greater part
of production, according to the statement.  SandRidge, which has been looking to reduce its debt, sold
acreage in the Permian Basin oil field to Sheridan Holding
Company II LLC for $2.6 billion in January. Investors will watch
for any more details about the company’s production forecasts,
said  Scott Hanold , an analyst with RBC Capital Markets LLC in
 Minneapolis .  Land Deals  “Everyone’s going to be focused on the situation with  Tom Ward  and what’s going to happen to him,” Hanold said in an
interview before the earnings were released. He rates
SandRidge’s shares the equivalent of hold and doesn’t own any.  TPG-Axon, which owns 7.3 percent of SandRidge, has
pressured the company to revamp its board and fire Ward, its
chief executive officer. SandRidge agreed March 14 to allow TPG-
Axon to name four board members and said a  law firm  will review
land deals between the company and Ward’s family.  The earnings were released after the close of regular
trading in  New York . SandRidge rose 1.7 percent to $5.39 at the
close.  To contact the reporter on this story:
