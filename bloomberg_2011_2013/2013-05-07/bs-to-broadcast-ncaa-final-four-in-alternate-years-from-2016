The men’s college basketball
championship game will be broadcast on  Time Warner Inc. (TWX) ’s TBS
every other year beginning in 2016, the network and  CBS Corp. (CBS) ’s
CBS Sports announced today.  CBS will retain the title game in 2014 and 2015, with TBS
handling the national semifinals, according to a joint statement
from the networks. They will then alternate the Final Four
coverage, including both semifinals and the final.  The news “represents another win-win arrangement that
continues to help us extend the reach of this marquee property
by combining the resources of our two organizations,” CBS
Sports Chairman Sean McManus said in a statement.  CBS, which has shown the National Collegiate Athletic
Association tournament’s championship game since 1982, and the
TBS cable network signed a 14-year partnership in 2010 for
exclusive television rights to the tournament.  Earlier round coverage will continue to be carried across
four national television networks -- CBS, TBS, TNT and truTV,
the networks said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
