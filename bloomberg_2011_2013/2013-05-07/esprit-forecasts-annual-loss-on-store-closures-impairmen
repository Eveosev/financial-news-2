Esprit Holdings Ltd. (330) , the Hong Kong-
based apparel seller whose two top executives quit last year,
forecast a ’’substantial’’ fiscal-year loss on store closures
and loss of goodwill.  Revenue for the third quarter ended March 31 dropped 7.9
percent to HK$6.7 billion ($863 million) from a year earlier,
Esprit said in a stock exchange statement today. The annual loss
will come partly from a goodwill impairment of as much as HK$2
billion related to China investments, it said.  Esprit, which gets about 78 percent of its sales from
Europe, in February posted a wider-than-estimated first-half
loss of HK$465 million on weaker consumer demand there. The
apparel seller has  invested  in advertising and store upgrades as
it faces competition from bigger rivals including  Hennes &
Mauritz AB (HMB) , Fast Retailing Co. Ltd. and  Inditex SA (ITX) ’s Zara.  Comparable-store sales fell 1.5 percent for the quarter
ended March. Esprit raised more than HK$5 billion in a rights
offer in November to fund efforts to revive its brand. The stock
gained 1.5 percent this year and closed at HK$10.90 in  Hong Kong 
today.  Esprit lost two executives over 48 hours in June as ex-
chairman Hans Joachim Koerber resigned a day after then-Chief
Executive Officer Ronald Van der Vis quit. The departures fueled
doubts over the company’s ability to see its transformation plan
through.  To contact the reporter on this story:
