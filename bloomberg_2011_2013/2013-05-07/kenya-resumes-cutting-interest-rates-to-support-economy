Kenya ’s central bank resumed cutting
interest rates to support the economy after peaceful elections
two months ago helped to ease investors’ concerns that the vote
would destabilize the country.  The Monetary Policy Committee, led by central bank Governor
Njuguna Ndung’u, cut the benchmark  interest rate  by 100 basis
points to 8.5 percent, the Nairobi-based bank said in an e-
mailed statement today. The median estimate of eight economists
surveyed by Bloomberg was for the rate to be lowered to 9.25
percent.  Inflation was unchanged at 4.1 percent in April, below the
government’s target of 5 percent, giving the central bank room
to ease borrowing costs. Elections in March didn’t repeat the
violence that followed disputed polls six years ago, allowing
policy makers to focus on spurring  East Africa ’s biggest
economy.  “The central bank will look to support economic growth now
that the elections are over,” Eric Munywoki, a research analyst
at Nairobi-based Old Mutual Securities Ltd., said by phone
before the decision. “I also don’t see government borrowing at
high rates now.”  Uhuru Kenyatta defeated former Prime Minister  Raila Odinga 
in the March 4 presidential vote, pledging to boost economic
growth to 10 percent a year from a projected 5.6 percent in
2013.  The MPC lowered its benchmark rate by 8.5 percentage points
between July and January, and left it unchanged at 9.5 percent
in March. The shilling has gained 2.6 percent against the dollar
since the election.  To contact the reporter on this story:
