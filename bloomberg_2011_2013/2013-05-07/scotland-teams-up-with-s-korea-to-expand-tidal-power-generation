Scotland , whose coastline is pounded
by the North and Irish Seas as well as the Atlantic Ocean,
agreed to collaborate with South Korea to expand in tidal power.  Scottish Development International, the government’s trade
and investment arm, will work with South Korea’s Incheon
Metropolitan City to share knowledge, ideas and technologies,
according to a government  statement .  Scotland, seeking to get all of its electricity from clean
sources by 2020, may have as much as a quarter of  Europe ’s tidal
resources, according to government estimates. It offers one of
the highest subsidies in the world for marine energy.  South Korea, also expanding the use of renewables,
introduced rules last year requiring power utilities to get 2
percent of their supply from clean sources. The so-called
renewable portfolio standard will rise to 10 percent by 2022.  To contact the reporter on this story:
