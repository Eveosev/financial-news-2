Gerdau SA, Latin America’s largest
steelmaker, said first-quarter profit declined 60 percent,
missing analysts’ estimates, after sales fell at its North
American unit.  Net income dropped to 148.2 million reais ($74 million)
from 396.6 million reais a year earlier, the Porto Alegre,
Brazil-based company said today in a statement. Gerdau was
expected to post profit excluding one-time items of 154.1
million reais, the  average of  seven estimates compiled by
Bloomberg. Its earnings missed estimates for a third consecutive
quarter.  A more severe winter than usual pared sales in North
America, which represents about 40 percent of revenue, Gerdau
said. Net sales declined 0.4 percent to 9.17 billion reais, from
9.2 billion a year earlier, pushed down by a 13 percent decline
in shipment volumes from Gerdau’s North American unit.  “We expect a more significant recovery of metal spreads in
the U.S. in the second and third quarter,” Alan Glezer, an
equity analyst at Banco Bradesco SA’s brokerage unit in Sao
Paulo, said in a report on May 3. “In  Brazil , we remain
optimistic about demand as we approach a phase of intense
infrastructure investments.”  Gerdau fell 3.6 percent to 14.90 reais at 10:31 a.m. in Sao
Paulo, the most in three weeks. Before today, the stock lost 6
percent in 12 months, more than the 8.9 percent decline in
Brazil’s benchmark Ibovespa  index .  Price increases partly offset a 4 percent decline in total
steel shipments, which fell to 4.56 million metric tons, Gerdau
said.  (Gerdau is scheduled to hold a  conference call  with
investors today at 1 p.m.  New York  time.)  To contact the reporter on this story:
