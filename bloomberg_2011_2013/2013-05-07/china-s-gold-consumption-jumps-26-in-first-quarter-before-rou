Gold consumption in  China , the world’s
largest user after India, jumped 26 percent in the first three
months of 2013 from a year ago amid strong bullion sales and
rising jewelry demand, an association said.  Total consumption reached 320.54 metric tons in the first
quarter, the China Gold Association said today in an e-mailed
report. Purchases of gold bars surged 49 percent to 120.39 tons,
while jewelry gained 16 percent to 178.59 tons, it said. Gold
output in China, the world’s largest producer, gained 11 percent
in the same period to 89.91 tons, according to the association.  First-quarter sales preceded gold’s slump into a  bear
market  last month, with prices tumbling 14 percent the two days
through April 15, the worst drop in three decades. The slump led
to a surge in demand for jewelry, coins and bars from India and
the U.S. to China. China’s imports of the metal from  Hong Kong 
surged to a record in March, the Hong Kong government said on
its website today.  “This came out better than our expectation because these
sales were done before the gold market rout in April when more
people rushed to buy gold,” Song Qing,  fund manager  at Lion
Fund Management Co., China’s first asset manager to place money
in foreign exchange-traded gold funds.  Bullion of  99.99 percent purity  on the Shanghai Gold
Exchange dropped 4.3 percent in the first quarter, and was at
294  yuan  a gram ($1,486 an ounce) today. The weeklong Lunar New
Year holiday, when consumers bought gold jewelry and bars as
gifts in the most-important festival, was in February this year.
In  London , gold for immediate delivery traded 13 percent lower
this year at $1,459.29 an ounce.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
