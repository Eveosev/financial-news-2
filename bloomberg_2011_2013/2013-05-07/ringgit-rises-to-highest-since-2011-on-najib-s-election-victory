The ringgit strengthened to its
highest since August 2011 and  government bonds  rose after
Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak’s coalition retained power
in the weekend poll, bolstering the outlook for economic reforms.  Najib’s Barisan Nasional alliance, also known as the
National Front, won 133 of 222 parliamentary seats in the May 5
election, extending a 55-year rule. The premier has embarked on
a $444 billion spending spree to build railways, power plants
and roads in an attempt to achieve developed-nation status by
2020 at the same time as vowing to cut the budget deficit.
Opposition leader  Anwar Ibrahim , whose group secured 89 seats,
alleges electoral fraud and has disputed the outcome.  “At least part of the uncertainty is out of the picture,”
said Andy Ji, a foreign-exchange strategist in Singapore at
 Commonwealth Bank of Australia. (CBA)  “The opposition is still
contesting the results but it’s not going to make much of a
difference. The ringgit will consolidate around the current
level.”  The currency advanced 0.4 percent to 2.9682 per dollar as
of 10:19 a.m. in  Kuala Lumpur  and touched 2.9570, the strongest
level since Aug. 2, 2011, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It’s headed for the biggest three-day gain since
December 2008.  Results ‘Positive’  Following the election result yesterday, the ringgit
rallied 1.8 percent, the largest advance since June 2010. The
FTSE Bursa Malaysia KLCI Index of shares climbed as much as 7.8
percent before closing up 3.4 percent at a record.  One-month implied volatility in the currency, a measure of
expected moves in the  exchange rate  used to price options,
climbed 10 basis points to 7.62 percent. The gauge dropped 119
basis points, or 1.19 percentage points, yesterday to 7.52
percent, the biggest decline since January 2012.  The yield on the 3.26 percent sovereign notes due March
2018 fell one basis point to 3.11 percent today, the lowest
level for a benchmark five-year bond since September 2011,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “Election results are positive for Malaysian assets,”
 Rohit Arora  and  Igor Arsenin , strategists at Barclays Plc, wrote
in a research note yesterday. “Potential upside for the ringgit
remains, but large moves are unlikely given the likelihood of FX
intervention.”  Three-month non-deliverable forwards in the ringgit were
little changed at 2.9818 per dollar after rising 2.2 percent
yesterday.  Bank Negara Malaysia has kept its benchmark  interest rate 
at 3 percent since May 2011 to spur growth in the $288 billion
economy, Southeast Asia’s third largest. Policy makers next meet
to set rates on May 9, with all 17 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg predicting no change.  To contact the reporter on this story:
