Palm oil fell for a fourth day on
concerns that global production may increase this month and a
rally in the ringgit to the highest since August 2011 may reduce
the appeal of commodities priced in the Malaysian currency.  The contract for July delivery fell as much as 0.7 percent
to 2,235 ringgit ($750) a metric ton on the Bursa  Malaysia 
Derivatives, before trading at 2,246 ringgit at 3:52 p.m. in
 Kuala Lumpur . Futures, which lost 7.9 percent this year, reached
2,230 ringgit yesterday, the lowest since on Dec. 13.  Output from Malaysia, the world’s second-largest producer,
gained 5.3 percent to 1.4 million tons in April, while exports
fell 6.5 percent to 1.44 million tons, a Bloomberg survey
published yesterday showed. Reserves decreased 5.1 percent to
2.06 million tons, the least since July, according to the survey.
Official data are due for release on May 10.  “People are looking at the current month’s production
which is anticipated to be about 8 percent to 10 percent higher
in Malaysia, and  Indonesia  is also expected to record higher
output after a few months of lower production,” said Chandran Sinnasamy, head of trading at LT International Futures Sdn.
“That will apply pressure. There’s no robust demand at the
moment to support prices.”  Production in Indonesia, the largest supplier, may reach 28
million tons this year from 25.7 million tons in 2012, Derom Bangun, chairman of the country’s  palm oil  board, said today.
That was lower than a February forecast of 30 million tons.  The rally in the ringgit also weighed on futures, Chandran
said. The ringgit strengthened after Malaysian Prime Minister
Najib Razak’s coalition retained power in the weekend poll,
bolstering the outlook for economic reforms.  Soybeans for July delivery gained 0.5 percent to $13.7575 a
bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade.  Soybean oil  climbed 0.6
percent to 49.06 cents a pound.  Refined palm oil for September delivery declined 0.7
percent to close at 5,904 yuan ($960) a ton on the  Dalian
Commodity Exchange . Soybean oil for same month delivery
retreated 0.2 percent to end at 7,362  yuan  a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
