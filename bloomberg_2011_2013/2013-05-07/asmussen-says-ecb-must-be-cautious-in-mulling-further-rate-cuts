European Central Bank Executive Board
member Joerg Asmussen said while policy makers are prepared to
cut interest rates again if the economic situation warrants it,
they must also exercise caution.  The ECB lowered rates last week “because data justified it,
and we also clarified that we are ready to act again if the
economic data require us to do so,” Asmussen said at an event
in Schwaebisch Gmuend,  Germany , tonight. “But of course we also
have to be cautious. If we keep interest rates too low for too
long, it can have real costs.”  The Frankfurt-based ECB on May 2 cut its  benchmark rate  to
a record-low of 0.5 percent and said it is also open to taking
its deposit rate, currently at zero, into negative territory.
President Mario Draghi said the decision was reached by
consensus, meaning not all of the ECB’s 23 Governing Council
members agreed with the move. Asmussen reiterated tonight that
the decision was taken “by consensus.”  “We have done a lot with standard measures like interest-
rate cuts, and non-standard measures,” such as the pledge to
buy government bonds if certain conditions are met, Asmussen
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
