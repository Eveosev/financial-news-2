U.S. economic growth may quicken to 3
percent or more early next year from the current pace of 2
percent to 2.5 percent as the effects of federal spending cuts
subside, Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew said.  “There is no reason, looking at the beginning of next
year, not to see an economy that’s growing at a 3-plus percent
rate,” Lew said in response to questions after a speech to the
City Club of  Cleveland  today. “We go into next year in a
stronger position.”  Lew based his projection on a resolution of across-the-
board government spending cuts known as sequestration, which he
said is holding back growth in the first half of this year.
Another restraint on the U.S. expansion has been stagnant growth
in  Europe , the biggest market for U.S. exports, Lew said.  Lew, who is traveling to the U.K. later this week for talks
with Group of Seven finance ministers, also said European policy
makers have responded to calls for a stronger emphasis on growth
over fiscal austerity.  “They’ve given more time to countries like Portugal and
Ireland and  France  to meet fiscal targets. That’s going to have
some effect,” and “the  European Central Bank  has loosened up
on its lending rates,” he said. “We can participate, as I will
this weekend, in meetings with my counterparts and make the
case. We have had some success, I think, in urging them in the
right direction.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
