Citigroup Inc. (C) , the bank that took the
most U.S. aid during the credit crisis, sold $1.25 billion of
subordinated debt.  The lender issued 3.5 percent, 10-year notes that pay 178
basis points more than similar-maturity Treasuries, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The New York-based bank’s debt is
expected to be rated Baa3 by Moody’s Investors Service.  Citigroup sold subordinated bonds in February with an $894
million sale of 4.05 percent notes due July 2022, which paid
203.6 basis points more than Treasuries, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Those securities traded yesterday at
104.8 cents on the dollar to yield 3.44 percent, or 168.3 basis
points more than benchmarks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
