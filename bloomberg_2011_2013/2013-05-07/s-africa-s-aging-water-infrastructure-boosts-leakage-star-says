Aging water infrastructure in  South
Africa ’s Gauteng province is leading to increased losses from
leakage, the Johannesburg-based Star newspaper reported.  Provincial municipalities lost about 481 million kiloliters
(106 trillion gallons) of water in fiscal 2011-12, said Fred
Nel, a Democratic Alliance party spokesman, citing figures from
the provincial ministry, according to the Star. Nel said losses
rose 36 percent from a year before, the newspaper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
