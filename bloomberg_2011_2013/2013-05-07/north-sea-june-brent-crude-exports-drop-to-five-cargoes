Exports of North Sea Brent crude for
June are planned at five cargoes of 600,000 barrels each, one
less than this month, a loading program obtained by  Bloomberg
News  showed.  There are no consignments set to load next month until June
14, the plan showed. The reason for the two-week gap in the
schedule is not yet known, according to a survey of four traders
with direct knowledge of the loading program.  Jonathan French, a London-based spokesman for  Royal Dutch
Shell Plc (RDSA) , the operator of the Brent field, declined to comment
either on loading or maintenance schedules when contacted by
Bloomberg News today.  Brent is one of four North Sea oil grades that make up the
Dated Brent benchmark, which is used to price crude from the
 Middle East , Africa and  Russia . June plans for the other three
blends, Forties, Oseberg and Ekofisk, are also scheduled to be
issued to traders today.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporters on this story:
