Emerson Electric Co. (EMR) , a maker of air-
conditioner compressors and equipment for power plants and data
centers, cut its 2013 profit forecast after a sluggish worldwide
economy curbed demand in the first quarter.  Earnings for the year will probably be $3.48 to $3.58 per
share, the St. Louis-based company said today in a statement.
That trails the $3.60 average of analysts’ estimates as well as
Emerson’s previous projection of $3.53 to $3.63. Net income of
77 cents a share in the fiscal second quarter, which ended March
31, trailed the 78-cent average of analysts’ estimates.  “Economies around the world are struggling for momentum,”
Chief Executive Officer  David Farr  said in the statement.
“Demand slowed in the second half of the quarter as overall
global business confidence deteriorated. We do not see a
catalyst to economic growth over the next six to nine months.”  The global economy may remain weak for about five years as
U.S. and European policy makers grapple with reducing debt, Farr
predicted in September. The company saw 6 percent growth in
 emerging markets  in the first quarter, in line with the CEO’s
prediction that growth there would outpace that in developed
countries.  Emerson fell 1.3 percent, the biggest drop in the Standard
& Poor’s 500 Industrials Index, to $56.56 at 4:01 p.m. in  New
York . The shares have climbed 6.8 percent this year.  Net income rose 2.9 percent to $561 million from $545
million, or 74 cents a share, a year earlier, the company said.
Revenue grew less than 1 percent to $5.96 billion,  trailing
analysts’ estimates  of $6.03 billion.  “After a weaker than expected February and March, orders
in April continued to trend downward, reflecting further
deterioration in business confidence,” the company said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
