The Energy Information Administration
lowered its forecast for summer 2013 gasoline prices.  U.S. consumers will pay an average 16 cents a gallon less
for gasoline this summer than a year ago, the statistical arm of
the Energy Department said today in its monthly Short-Term
Energy Outlook. The EIA’s April forecast predicted prices would
average 6 cents a gallon less than in 2012.  The agency expects regular-grade  gasoline  will average
$3.53 a gallon from April through September, down from the April
estimate of $3.63 a gallon. Diesel fuel will average $3.88 a
gallon, less than the prior forecast of 3.94.  “U.S. drivers will get a break at the pump this summer as
the average gasoline price is now expected to be $3.53 a gallon,
16 cents less than last summer and significantly lower than the
$3.78 per gallon peak price reached in late February,”  Adam Sieminski , the EIA’s administrator, said in an e-mailed
statement.  Lower crude prices will keep motorists’ costs in check,
according to the EIA. Brent, the pricing basis for U.S. oil
imports, is down 7.1 percent from a year ago, while West Texas
Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark, has dropped 2.2 percent.
Regular gasoline, which averaged $3.538 a gallon in the week
ended yesterday, is 25.2 cents a gallon below a year earlier,
the EIA said yesterday.  Lower Prices  The EIA lowered its forecast for gasoline prices at the
pump for all of 2013 and reduced its estimate for demand.  Regular-grade gasoline will average $3.50 a gallon this
year, down from last month’s forecast of $3.56. Prices in 2012
averaged $3.63 a gallon.  Prices may average $3.39 in 2014, the department estimated,
unchanged from the April forecast.  Gasoline  consumption  this year will average 8.68 million
barrels a day, lower than the 8.69 million in last month’s
projection. Demand in 2014 may be 8.69 million barrels a day,
down from last month’s forecast of 8.7 million.  Distillate demand, including diesel and heating oil, will
be 3.8 million barrels a day this year, up from last month’s
outlook of 3.79 million. Consumption in 2014 is estimated to be
3.81 million, unchanged from the previous forecast.  To contact the reporter on this story:
