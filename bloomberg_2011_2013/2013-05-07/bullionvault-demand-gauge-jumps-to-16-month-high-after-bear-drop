BullionVault, an online service for
investors to buy and sell physical gold and silver, said its
Gold Investor Index climbed to a 16-month high last month as the
biggest price drop in three decades triggered more demand.  The index jumped to 58.6 in April, the highest since
December 2011, from 53.3 in March, the London-based company said
today in an e-mailed report. A reading above 50 means more
buyers than sellers. Gold tumbled 14 percent in two days last
month, the biggest decline since 1983. It traded at $1,462.61 an
ounce by 6:57 a.m. in London, down 13 percent this year.  Bullion declined in April as Cyprus said it intends to sell
part of its  gold reserves  and investors in exchange-traded funds
sold the most  tonnage  for any month on record. BullionVault said
new-account openings were the strongest since January 2012.  “While this surge in new business is already easing, it
shows the strength of pent-up Western household interest in
physical bullion, which was previously deterred by higher
prices,” Adrian Ash, head of research at BullionVault, said in
the report. “The response to April’s sharp fall is redolent of
Asian gold demand. Developed-world savers didn’t chase prices
higher in late 2012. Now they’re buying the drop.”  The index peaked at 71.7 in September 2011 and was at a
six-month low in March. Gold climbed to a record $1,921.15 in
September 2011 and rallied 11 percent in the third quarter last
year, the most in two years.  BullionVault’s customers own gold worth about 1 billion
pounds ($1.56 billion), the company said. The metal is stored in
vaults in  London , Zurich,  New York  and  Singapore .  To contact the reporter on this story:
