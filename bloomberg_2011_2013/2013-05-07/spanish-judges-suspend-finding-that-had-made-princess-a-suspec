Judges at a regional court in  Spain ’s
Balearic Islands suspended a magistrate’s ruling that had made
Princess Cristina, the daughter of King Juan Carlos, an official
suspect in an investigation of corruption allegations centered
on her husband’s business activities.  By a vote of 2 to 1, the panel of judges at the court in
Palma de Mallorca upheld an appeal by public prosecutors to
suspend the ruling against the princess and cancel her planned
testimony before the court until the investigating magistrate,
Jose Castro, provides more evidence, the court said in an e-
mailed statement today.  The prosecutors’ April 3 appeal was later joined by the
lawyers defending both the princess and her husband.  Cristina’s husband, Inaki Urdangarin, is a suspect in a
fraud, embezzlement and money-laundering probe that focuses on
the non-profit Noos Institute, which was founded to make Spanish
companies more competitive. The institute, where Urdangarin was
chairman, won 5.8 million euros ($7.45 million) of contracts
from the regional governments of Valencia and the Balearic
Islands between 2004 and 2007 without participating in a
competitive tender, ABC newspaper reported last year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
