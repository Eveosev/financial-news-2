Telstra Corp. (TLS) ,  Singapore
Telecommunications Ltd. (ST) ’s Optus unit and  TPG Telecom Ltd. (TPM)  agreed
to pay a total of A$1.96 billion ($2 billion) for Australian
wireless spectrum for broadband services.  Telstra, the nation’s biggest phone company, will pay A$1.3
billion for spectrum in the 700 megahertz and 2.5 gigahertz
bands, the Australian Communications & Media Authority said in
an e-mailed  statement  today. Second-ranked Optus will pay A$649
million for an allocation in both airwaves, which were
previously used for television, the regulator said.  Australia’s largest phone companies are buying airwaves to
build their mobile operations as the construction of a national
fiber network limits their ability to be wholesalers of more-
profitable fixed-line services. Melbourne-based Telstra bought
its maximum permitted allocation in the 2.5 gigahertz band,
which is suitable for wireless broadband, and will finance the
15-year licenses from debt, the company said.  TPG will pay A$13.5 million for spectrum in the 2.5
gigahertz range, the government said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
