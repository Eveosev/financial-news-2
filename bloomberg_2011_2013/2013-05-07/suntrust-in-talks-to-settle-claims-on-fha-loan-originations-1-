SunTrust Banks Inc. (STI) , Georgia’s biggest
lender, said it’s in talks with U.S. authorities to settle
claims over its handling of loans backed by the Federal Housing
Administration.  The U.S. Department of Justice and the Department of
Housing and Urban Development’s inspector general informed the
company of their preliminary investigative findings during the
first quarter, Atlanta-based SunTrust said today in a regulatory
filing. The allegations include violations of the  False Claims
Act , it said.  “The government and the company are engaged in settlement
discussions, but the company disagrees with the analysis and
methodology used to support the government’s allegations,”
SunTrust wrote in the filing.  In October, the U.S. sued Wells Fargo & Co., the largest
U.S. mortgage originator, over claims the San Francisco-based
bank made reckless loans that caused losses for a federal
insurance program when borrowers defaulted. The complaint
alleges misconduct over more than a decade related to the firm’s
participation in a Federal Housing Administration program and
follows similar cases against other lenders including Citigroup
Inc. and Deutsche Bank AG.  To contact the reporter on this story:
