Ronnie O’Sullivan became the first
player in 17 years to secure back-to-back world snooker
championships by beating Barry Hawkins, winning the title for
the fifth time after effectively taking 12 months out.  O’Sullivan, 37, compiled six century breaks -- a record for
a final at the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield,  England  -- on the
way to an 18-12 victory last night. He had taken a 15-12 lead
into the last session of the best-of-35 frames final and reeled
off the last three frames in about half an hour with breaks of 77,
88 and 86.  England’s O’Sullivan had entered the 32-man tournament as
the bookmakers’ favorite even after playing one competitive
match since capturing the title a year ago. He’s the first
player to successfully defend the world championship since
Stephen Hendry in 1996, though he said after his victory that he
doesn’t know if he will try to win three in a row.  “I can’t say that I will be back next year because I
enjoyed my year out,” O’Sullivan told the British Broadcasting
Corp. “Now I’ve got to enjoy one of the most amazing things
I’ve ever done, retaining the world championship.”  O’Sullivan, nicknamed “The Rocket” for his fast playing
style, extended his perfect record in finals at snooker’s
biggest event to 5-0 to claim the trophy and  winners’ check  for
250,000 pounds ($388,400). He also won the title in 2001, 2004
and 2008.  Hawkins, ranked No. 14 in the world and an 80-1 outsider
with bookmakers when the tournament began April 20, had never
made it beyond the second round before this year.  “I tried my hardest in that final and I just made a few
more mistakes than Ronnie,” said Hawkins, who won a career-high
125,000 pounds as the runner-up. “You cannot afford to do that
against a player of his caliber because he is just unbelievable.
The way he makes it look so easy is just amazing.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
