The Ibovespa rallied to a one-week
high as companies that depend on domestic demand gained amid
speculation that policy makers will limit increases in  Brazil ’s
target lending rate.  B2W Cia. Digital led gains by retailers. Banco do Brasil SA
was the best performer among financial stocks. Toll-road
operator Cia. de Concessoes Rodoviarias rose the most in two
weeks. Railroad company  ALL America Latina Logistica SA (ALLL3)  advanced
after posting first-quarter earnings that beat analysts’
estimates.  Brazil’s benchmark equity gauge added 0.7 percent to
55,795.64 at 12:01 p.m. in Sao Paulo. Forty-one  stocks  advanced
on the measure while 24 fell. The real weakened 0.1 percent to
2.0111 per dollar. Swap rates on the contract due in January
2015 dropped 0.07 percentage point to 8.17 percent before a
report tomorrow that is forecast to show annual inflation slowed
in April.  “The latest inflation figures weren’t so bad,” Luis
Gustavo Pereira, an analyst at Futura Corretora in  Sao Paulo ,
said in a telephone interview. “It doesn’t look like we’re
going to see increases steep enough to have a negative impact on
equities.”  The central bank board voted 6-to-2 last month to increase
the benchmark Selic rate to 7.50 percent from a record low 7.25
percent, saying in its statement that the “resilience of
inflation” required action.  B2W, Banco do Brasil  B2W added 0.9 percent to 11.49 reais. Banco do Brasil
climbed 3 percent to 25.09 reais. CCR rose 2.6 percent to 20.31
reais.  ALL rose 1.3 percent to 10.49 reais. The company posted
adjusted net income of 33.9 million reais in the first quarter,
more than the 24.6 million reais average of three  estimates 
among analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  The Ibovespa has  retreated  12 percent from this year’s peak
on Jan. 3 amid concern accelerating inflation may curb Brazil’s
economic recovery and the government’s interventionist policies
will hurt profits in industries including utilities and energy.
The MSCI BRIC Index of shares in Brazil,  Russia ,  India  and  China 
has lost 4.3 percent over the same period.  Brazil’s main equity gauge  trades  at 12.4 times analysts’
earnings estimates for the next four quarters, compared with
10.7 for the MSCI  Emerging Markets  Index of 21 developing
nations’ equities, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Trading volume for stocks in Sao Paulo was 7.65 billion
reais yesterday, which compares with a daily average of 7.71
billion reais this year through April 30, according to data
compiled by the exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
