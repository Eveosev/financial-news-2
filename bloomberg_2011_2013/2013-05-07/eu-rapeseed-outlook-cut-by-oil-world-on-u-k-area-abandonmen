European Union rapeseed production
will increase less than previously expected after U.K. farmers
abandoned at least 200,000 hectares (494,200 acres) of the
oilseed due to “severe crop deterioration,” Oil World said.  The EU rapeseed crop is expected to be 19.8 million metric
tons, 500,000 tons more than last year and 400,000 tons below a
previous estimate, the Hamburg, Germany-based oilseed industry
researcher wrote in a report today.  Detrimental weather meant U.K. farmers will replant part of
the winter rapeseed area with lower-yielding spring varieties or
spring barley, according to Oil World. EU output this year will
“considerably” trail 20.6 million tons harvested in 2010 and
21.7 million tons in 2009, it said.  “Supplies of rapeseed will be tighter than previously
expected,” Oil World wrote. “The deteriorated rapeseed-
production prospects in the EU are likely to be a supportive
element for rapeseed prices, which may widen their premium over
soybeans.”  U.K. output of the oilseed may be 1.8 million to 1.9
million tons compared with 2.56 million tons in 2012, Oil World
said.  France ’s crop may fall to 5.2 million tons from 5.48
million tons due to an area decline of about 100,000 hectares.  Production is expected to climb by 600,000 tons in  Germany 
and 200,000 to 300,000 tons on  Poland , according to Oil World.  To contact the reporter on this story:
