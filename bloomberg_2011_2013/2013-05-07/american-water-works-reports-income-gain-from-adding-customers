American Water Works Co. (AWK) , the largest
publicly traded U.S. water company, said adding 22,000 customers
boosted net income as quarterly revenue fell short of analystsâ€™
estimates.  Net income rose 38 percent to about $58 million, or 32
cents a share, from a year earlier, the Voorhees, New Jersey-
based company said in a statement today. Sales increased 2.8
percent to $636.1 million, compared with expectations of $649.1
million, the average of nine estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  American Water Works reiterated that it expects 2013
earnings per share to be in the range of $2.15 to $2.25.  The company said yesterday it was increasing its quarterly
 dividend  12 percent to 28 cents per share.  To contact the reporter on this story:
