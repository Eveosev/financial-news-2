Indian stock-index futures gained as
overseas funds extended this year’s record purchases of the
nation’s equities.  SGX CNX Nifty Index futures  for May delivery rose 0.2
percent to 5,991.5 at 9:51 a.m. in Singapore. The underlying CNX
 Nifty (NIFTY)  Index climbed 0.5 percent to 5,971.05 yesterday, extending
a three-week rally. The S&P BSE Sensex Index added 0.5 percent
to 19,673.64. The Bank of  New York  Mellon India ADR Index of
U.S.-traded shares increased 0.6 percent.  Foreign funds bought a net $196 million of local shares on
May 3, taking their net investment in stocks this year to $11.8
billion, a record for the period according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Funds bought a net $802 million worth of equities
last week, the most in 12 weeks, the data show.  “Global liquidity has increased further and this huge
liquidity is going to last for some time,” Raamdeo Agrawal,
joint managing director at Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd.
in Mumbai, said in an interview with Bloomberg TV India
yesterday.  Lower borrowing costs from  Europe  to the U.S. and  Japan 
have stoked inflows into  India . The European Central Bank
trimmed rates to a record low last week and the Federal Reserve
said it will keep buying $85 billion of bonds a month to
stimulate the U.S. economy.  The Sensex capped a third week of gains on May 3, the
longest run since December. The gauge has rebounded 7.9 percent
since plunging to a seven-month low on April 9, as overseas
investors stepped-up purchases of Indian equities amid optimism
the Reserve Bank of India would cut interest rates at its May 3
policy review. While the RBI lowered borrowing costs that day,
Governor Duvvuri Subbarao told Bloomberg TV India in a May 4
interview the possibility of further easing is “practically
non-existent.”  The Sensex has advanced 1.3 percent in 2013 and is valued
at 13.3 times  projected 12-month profits , compared with a
multiple of 10.5 times for the MSCI  Emerging Markets  Index. The
 Indian (SENSEX)  gauge’s 50-day volatility, a measure of price swings,
rose to the highest level since Aug. 8 yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
