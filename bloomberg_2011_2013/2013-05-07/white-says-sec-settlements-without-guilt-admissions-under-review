The U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission is reviewing its practice of settling cases without
requiring defendants to admit guilt, the agency’s chairman said
today in congressional testimony.  SEC Chairman Mary Jo White, a former federal prosecutor,
told a House Appropriations subcommittee that the policy has
benefited investors while saving SEC resources. The settlements
leave no question “about what the conduct was,” White said.  White’s comment provides an early window into whether
she’ll change a practice that has been criticized by lawmakers,
consumer groups and jurists including U.S. District Court Judge
Jed Rakoff. The SEC has defended “no admit, no deny”
settlements for the same reasons that White outlined.  “It is a very good end in many cases,” she told
lawmakers. “It saves resources and you do not incur the
litigation risk and you get lots of money to investors a lot
quicker.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
