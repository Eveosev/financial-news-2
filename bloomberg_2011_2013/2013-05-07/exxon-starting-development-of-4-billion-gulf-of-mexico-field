Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) , the largest U.S.
oil company, said it will invest more than $4 billion in the
development of its Julia oil field in the  Gulf of Mexico .  Oil production is expected to start in 2016 from the field,
which was discovered in 2007, Irving, Texas-based Exxon said in
a statement today. The resource in place is estimated to be
almost 6 billion barrels, Exxon said.  The Julia unit was the subject of a 2011 Exxon lawsuit
against the U.S. over the government’s decision to cancel the
offshore leases because Exxon hadn’t proceeded quickly enough
with development. The litigation was later settled, allowing the
company “to develop this very large, but technically
challenging, resource as quickly as possible using a phased
approach,” Patrick McGinn, an Exxon spokesman, said in January
2012.  An initial phase of the project is designed for daily
output of 34,000 barrels of oil, the company said in today’s
statement. It will have tie-backs to a production facility
operated by  Chevron Corp. (CVX)  Exxon and  Statoil ASA (STL)  both have a 50
percent stake in the Julia unit.  “Julia is one of the first large oil discoveries in the
ultra-deepwater frontier of the Gulf of Mexico,” Neil Duffin,
president of Exxon’s development company, said in the statement.
“This resource is located more than 30,000 feet below the
ocean’s surface. Enhanced technologies will be deployed to
ensure the safe and environmentally responsible development of
this important energy resource.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
