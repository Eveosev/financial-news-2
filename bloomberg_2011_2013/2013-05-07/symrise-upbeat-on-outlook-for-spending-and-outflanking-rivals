Symrise AG (SY1) , the fourth-biggest maker
of flavors and fragrances, forecast a “favorable” development
in  consumer confidence  in 2013 as it reiterated plans to grow
faster than competitors on average. The stock rose the most in
almost a year.  Sales gains in 2013 will exceed the 2 percent to 3 percent
increase expected for the global fragrance and flavor market,
Holzminden, Germany-based Symrise said today in a statement.
First-quarter earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization rose 6 percent from a year earlier to 92.8 million
euros ($121.7 million), in line with analyst estimates.  The results contrast with figures at Swiss rival  Givaudan
SA (GIVN) , which reported first-quarter sales last month that missed
estimates on weaker demand for fine fragrances as  Europe ’s debt
crisis weighs on demand for luxury items. Symrise Chief
Executive Officer Heinz-Juergen Bertram reiterated today that he
plans to boost revenue 5 percent to 7 percent a year until the
end of the decade, adding about 1 billion euros to annual sales.  “Even though some European countries continue to be
impacted by the euro crisis, Symrise expects to see an overall
positive economic climate in its sales markets,” the company
said today.  Symrise rose as much as 5.8 percent to 34.99 euros, the
biggest intraday jump since May 23, 2012, and was trading up 5.7
percent at 12:22 p.m. in  Frankfurt . The stock is trading this
year at the  highest  since Symrise’s December 2006 initial public
offering, boosting the company’s market value to 4.13 billion
euros.  First-quarter sales increased 5.8 percent to 457.6 million
euros, matching estimates. Net income gained 7 percent to 46
million euros, beating the 44.7 million-euro average estimate.  Symrise, the maker of perfume ingredients for Dior’s
Fahrenheit, plans to boost Ebitda to more than 500 million euros
by 2020, with margins at 19 percent to 22 percent of revenue,
the company said, repeating a target laid out in March.  To contact the reporter on this story:
