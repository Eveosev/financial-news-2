  Swiss stocks  advanced, with the Swiss
Market Index trading near its highest level in more than five
years, as companies from Adecco SA to OC Oerlikon Corp. rose
after reporting earnings.  Adecco increased 1.1 percent after posting a gross margin
for the first three months of the year that beat analysts’
estimates. OC Oerlikon gained 1.8 percent after saying that its
first-quarter results met its own forecasts.  The SMI (SMI)  climbed 0.3 percent to 7,953.72 at 10:43 a.m. in
Zurich. The equity benchmark has risen for eight consecutive
months, its longest monthly winning streak in seven years. The
SMI has rallied 17 percent this year. The broader Swiss
Performance Index added 0.4 percent today.  “SMI is moving higher this morning driven mainly by
financials and the cyclical sector,” Ion-Marc Valahu, co-
founder and fund manager at Clairinvest in Geneva. “The equity
market is nearing levels not seen since January 2008.”  Adecco (ADEN)  gained 1.1 percent to 51.25 Swiss francs after the
world’s biggest supplier of temporary workers described its
first-quarter results as solid given the ongoing recession in
many European countries. Sales of 4.6 billion euros ($6
billion), missed the  average analyst forecast  in a Bloomberg
survey of 4.7 billion euros.  Oerlikon increased 1.8 percent to 11.10 francs as the
textile-machinery maker reiterated its forecast for the full
year after reporting first-quarter revenue of 723 million francs
($770 million). The company generated sales of 737 million
francs in the same quarter last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
