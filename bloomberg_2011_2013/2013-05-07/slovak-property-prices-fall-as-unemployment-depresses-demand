 Slovak residential property prices
fell 0.6 percent in the first quarter after two consecutive
increases as rising unemployment depresses demand for housing,
the central bank said.  The average price for residential property declined to
1,240 euros ($1,623) per square meter (10.8 square feet) in the
first three months of 2013 from 1,247 euros in the fourth
quarter of last year, the Bratislava, Slovakia-based Narodna
Banka Slovenska  said  today on its website. Prices gained 0.4
percent on the year.  The economy of the export-oriented eastern euro-area member
is slowing because of the blocâ€™s debt crisis, causing
unemployment to rise to a nine-year high. The average price of
residential property is 20 percent down from a peak reached in
the second quarter of 2008.  Prices varied from 588 euros a square meter in the Nitra
region of western Slovakia, to 1,670 euros in the capital,
Bratislava.  To contact the reporter on this story:
