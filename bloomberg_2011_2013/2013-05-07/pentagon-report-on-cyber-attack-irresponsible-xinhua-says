A Pentagon report that accuses  China 
of a cyber espionage campaign is irresponsible and harmful to
the mutual trust, the official Xinhua News Agency said, citing a
military researcher.  The Pentagon report said the Chinese military has targeted
U.S. government computers with intrusions that seek sensitive
data. It was irresponsible for the Pentagon to make such an
assertion as the Chinese government and armed forces have never
sanctioned hacking activities, Xinhua cited Wang Xinjun as
saying. Wang is a researcher at the Academy of Military Sciences
of the Chinese People’s Liberation Army.  “It is an allegation based on presupposition,” Wang said,
according to Xinhua. “The groundless accusations reflect the
U.S. distrust of China.”  Both China and the U.S. are victims of cyber crimes and
should work together to tackle the problem, Wang said, according
to the report.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
