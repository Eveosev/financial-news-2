Prudential Plc (PRU) , the U.K.’s biggest
insurer by market value, said first-quarter revenue rose 8
percent, beating analysts’ estimates on higher demand for life
and health insurance in Hong Kong and Indonesia.  Sales, measured on an annual premium equivalent basis,
climbed to 1.04 billion pounds ($1.6 billion) from a year
earlier, beating the 1.02 billion-pound average estimate of 15
analysts surveyed by the company. Profit from new business
increased 5 percent to 563 million pounds, topping the 555
million-pound analyst estimate.  “Against a background of low long-term interest rates and
uncertain economic growth, we remain focused on executing our
strategy and capturing the long-term profitable growth
opportunities available to us, particularly in the growing
markets of Asia,” Chief Executive Officer Tidjane Thiam said in
the statement.  Prudential’s sales in southeast Asian countries such as
 Indonesia , Singapore and  Malaysia  has strengthened the firm’s
position in what it called the most long-term profitable
insurance market in the world and has raised its  dividend  by 53
percent since 2009. By contrast, the insurer has shifted away
from its home U.K. market, where profit margins have come under
pressure, and has curbed sales in the U.S.  The firm’s net flows into its asset-management divisions
increased 66 percent to 3.5 billion pounds, bringing assets
under management to 301.2 billion pounds.  Prudential has increased 34 percent this year, making it
the third-best performer in the 28-member Bloomberg Europe 500
Insurance Index, which has advanced 12 percent. The stock rose
0.1 percent to 1,156 pence a share at 9:25 a.m. in  London ,
valuing the company at about 29.5 billion pounds.  Thiam, 50, earned 7.8 million pounds in 2012 even after
becoming the first serving  FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  CEO to receive a
public rebuke from the U.K. regulator for failing to notify the
authorities of a $35.5 billion bid for  AIA Group Ltd. (1299)  early
enough. Prudential’s share price has almost doubled since Thiam
took the job in October 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
