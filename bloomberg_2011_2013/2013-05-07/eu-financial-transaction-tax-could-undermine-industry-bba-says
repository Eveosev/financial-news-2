The European Union’s planned tax on
financial transactions could undermine efforts by the industry
and regulators to make the system more stable, according to the
British Bankers’ Association.  Banks in  London  view the levy as having the potential to
“disrupt significantly capital markets and the transmission of
liquidity, which support the real economy,” BBA Chairman Nigel Wicks said in a letter to  Bank of England  Governor  Mervyn King 
published today. Members support a decision by the U.K. to
challenge the plan if participating  member states  “do not make
substantial changes,” according to the letter dated May 3.  “The FTT is not a tax on financial institutions but
instead the consumers of their services,” the BBA said. “The
tax will hurt ‘‘fixed-rate mortgages, utility and fuel bills,
food costs and pensions and savings, and in the process have a
further dampening effect on economic growth.’’  The EU on Feb. 14 unveiled its proposal for a 0.1 percent
levy on  stock  and bond trades and 0.01 percent on derivatives
trades with ties to participating countries. The measure exempts
primary offerings of  government bonds  though includes secondary
market trades. The EU estimates the move could raise as much as
35 billion euros ($45.9 billion) a year.  The BBA said that in the short term, the ‘‘tax-take could
be a multiple’’ of the estimate, ‘‘which would clearly not be
sustainable.’’  To contact the reporters on this story:
