Phil Ivey, nine-time winner of the
 World Series  of Poker tournament, sued a unit of  Genting Bhd. (GENT)  in
 London  over what he said was 7.8 million pounds ($12 million) of
unpaid winnings.  Ivey, 37, said he won the money playing the Punto Banco
game at Genting’s  Crockfords  casino in London last year,
according to an e-mailed statement.  “Crockfords has left me no alternative but to proceed with
legal action, following its decision to withhold my winnings,”
said Ivey, whose career earnings from tournaments total more
than $16 million, according to his statement. Ivey’s lawyer,
 Matthew Dowd , confirmed the suit in a phone interview.  Genting is Southeast Asia’s largest casino operator and in
March bought a Las Vegas site, once home to the Stardust resort,
for $350 million. Ivey lost to Andy Frankenberger, a former
derivatives trader at BNP Paribas SA, in the final of last
year’s World Series of Poker event.  A spokesman for Crockfords’ law firm Kingsley Napley
LLP in London declined to immediately comment, and a phonecall
to Genting’s Kuala Lumpur headquarters out of hours wasn’t
answered.  To contact the reporter on this story:
