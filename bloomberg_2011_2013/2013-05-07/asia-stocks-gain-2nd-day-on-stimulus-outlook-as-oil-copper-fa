Global stocks rose, with the Dow Jones
Industrial Average closing above 15,000 for the first time, as
earnings at companies from  Societe Generale  SA to DirecTV and
 Allianz SE  beat estimates and German factory orders increased.
 Australia ’s dollar fell as the central bank cut  interest rates .  The Dow jumped 87.31 points to close at 15,056.2 at 4 p.m.
in New York and the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.5 percent
to 1,625.96, reaching a record for a fourth straight day. The

Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  said further cuts in rates

come down to level that begets a rotation into cyclicals that
have strong balance sheets and strong dividend yields,” Steven Soranno, a Bethesda, Maryland-based senior equities analyst for
Calvert Investments Inc., which oversees about $12 billion, said
by telephone. “The old adage used to be ‘Don’t fight the Fed.’
Now it’s ‘Don’t fight the Feds,’ plural. Australia came in with
the rate cut and that just adds to the coordinated central bank
easing.”  Market Movers  Caterpillar Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Verizon
Communications Inc. rose more than 1.6 percent to lead the Dow’s

July 2010. Investors submitted bids for 10.2 billion euros

bonds at a record-low yield of 1.621 percent and the same amount
of securities due in 2019 at 0.794 percent. Germany’s 10-year
