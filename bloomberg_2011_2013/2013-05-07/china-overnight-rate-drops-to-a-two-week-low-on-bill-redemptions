China’s overnight money-market rate
declined to a two-week low on speculation that rising
redemptions of central bank bills and  repurchase agreements  will
increase cash supply.  A total of 186 billion  yuan  ($30.2 billion) of such
securities will mature this week, adding capital to the
financial system, compared with 30 billion yuan last week,
according to Song Qiuhong, a bond analyst at Foshan Shunde Rural
Commercial Bank Co. The People’s Bank of China drained 55
billion yuan from the financial system today by offering 28-day
repurchase contracts, according to a statement on its website.  “The increasing redemptions are helping boost short-term
 money supply ,” said Song, who is based in Guangdong province’s
Foshan city.  The one-day  repurchase rate , which measures interbank
funding availability, fell 42 basis points to 2.37 percent as of
10:18 a.m. in Shanghai, according to a weighted average rate
compiled by the National Interbank Funding Center. It earlier
touched 2.21 percent, the lowest since April 18.  The one-year swap contract, the fixed cost needed to
receive the floating seven-day repurchase rate, dropped one
basis point, 0.01 percentage point, to 3.26 percent, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
