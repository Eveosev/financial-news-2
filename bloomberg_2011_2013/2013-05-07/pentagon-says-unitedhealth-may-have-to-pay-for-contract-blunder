The U.S. Defense Department may ask
 UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH)  to reimburse the government after
military families experienced long delays getting medical-care
referrals.  Minnetonka, Minnesota-based UnitedHealth, the nation’s
largest insurer, took over a $20.5 billion contract from TriWest
Healthcare Alliance Corp. on April 1.  The contract includes “provisions for the recovery of
costs due to poor performance,” said Austin Camacho, a
spokesman for the Pentagon’s health-care system, known as
Tricare. The government will consider seeking reimbursement from
UnitedHealth, he said in an e-mail today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
