Emerging-market economic growth was
probably the weakest since September 2011 last month as global
demand for manufacturing and services declined, HSBC Holdings
Plc said, citing a survey of purchasing managers.  The HSBC  Emerging Markets  Index, which is compiled by
London-based Markit Economics and tracks conditions at more than
5,000 companies, fell to 51.3 in April from 52.5 in March, HSBC
said today in a report. A value above 50 indicates expansion and
below 50 signals contraction.  The International Monetary Fund trimmed its global growth
forecast April 16 as the euro-region recession extends into a
second year, dragging down the rest of the world. The global
economy will expand 3.3 percent this year, the Washington-based
lender said, cutting its prediction a fourth time.  “Weaker economic growth across most advanced markets is
now being felt in the emerging world as well,” said  Frederic
Neumann , HSBC’s co-head of Asian economic research. “Slower
growth raises the vulnerability of emerging markets to a broader
shake-out in advanced economies, whether a deeper slump in
 Europe  or renewed financial stress that would quickly propagate
across emerging markets as well.”  The MSCI Emerging Markets Index has fallen 0.4 percent this
year, compared with a 14 percent gain for the S&P 500.  The HSBC Emerging Markets Future Output Index, which gauges
company executives’ expectations for output in a year, fell for
a second month to its weakest since September, HSBC said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
