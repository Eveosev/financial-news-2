Gold investments through exchange-
traded products dropped $17.9 billion so far this year through
April, BlackRock Inc. said.  Outflows continued in April as moderating inflation
expectations sent prices plunging, BlackRock said in an e-mailed
report today. The total outflow for all commodities in the first
four months this year was $17.8 billion, compared with inflows
of $6 billion for the same period last year, it said. Gold
assets in ETPs stood at $105.7 billion in April, it said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
