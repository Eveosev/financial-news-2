Out of a Fairy Tale This stone castle in the middle of a forest clearing looks like something out of the pages of a Grimm fairy tale. Located on 20 private acres at 28523 Bacus Rd, Sedro Woolley, WA, the home is currently listed for $1.395 million. Over the Bridge & Through the Woods “What’s so striking to me, you come to this pedestrian gate and there’s this bridge across the creek which makes it like a real moat,” said listing agent Jean Groesbeck of Coldwell Banker Bain. “The water runs through the creek to a waterfall, and when you walk to the waterfall, it spills into a pond. It’s the most beautiful oasis, and there’s salmon that come through that creek.” Lighting the Way The home was designed to be a true castle — stone walls, circular design and all. The only difference from the medieval structures and this castle, located in Sedro Woolley, northeast of Seattle, is the amount of light in the home. “People think it’s going to be cold and damp,” Groesbeck said. “But there are nice large windows that add a lot of light. The home was designed to be an open floor plan.” Relaxing Retreat Measuring 2,972 square feet, the home has 3 bedrooms, 2 baths, a contemporary kitchen and spacious living room. The property also includes a hot tub and sauna – a relaxing retreat after a hike in the woods. Wooded Escape “It’s going to appeal to someone who loves nature,” Groesbeck said.
