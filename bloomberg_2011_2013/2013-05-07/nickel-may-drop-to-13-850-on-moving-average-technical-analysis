Nickel, which entered a  bear market 
this month, will probably decline further to the lowest level
since June 2009, according to Trading Central SA.  Futures may drop about 7.9 percent to $13,850 a metric ton
over the next month, said Ludwig Garric, Paris-based head of
Commodity Research, who correctly predicted the rally in
soybeans to a record last year.  “The near-term outlook favors the bear camp,” Garric said
in an e-mail dated yesterday. The 20-day moving average has
slipped below the 50-day moving average and both are heading
lower, turning into areas of resistance, he said. Prices are
making successive lower-highs and lower-lows, signaling a
bearish trend, he said.  Moving averages point to changes in price trends. When a
short-dated average breaks below a longer one, the move suggests
that prices may decline, and vice versa. Resistance levels are
marked by clusters of sell orders, according to technical
analysts, who say that past moves may be used to predict trends.  Nickel for three-month delivery traded at $15,040 on the
London Metal Exchange at 1:58 p.m. in  Singapore . The 20-day
moving average was $15,445 and the 50-day average was $16,183.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts use charts of
trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
