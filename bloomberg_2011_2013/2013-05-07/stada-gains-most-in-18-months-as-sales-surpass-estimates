Stada Arzneimittel AG (SAZ) , Germany’s
biggest publicly traded generic-drug maker, climbed the most in
18 months after first-quarter sales rose more than estimated and
the company reiterated its 2013 profit forecast.  Stada gained 6.8 percent to 31.93 euros at 12:41 p.m. in
 Frankfurt . The stock climbed as much as 8.2 percent, the biggest
intraday advance since Nov. 10, 2011.  Sales jumped 8 percent to about 477 million euros ($625
million), the Bad Vilbel, Germany-based company said in a
 statement  today. Analysts predicted 473 million euros, the
average of six  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg. Revenue in
eastern Europe and the  Commonwealth of Independent States 
climbed 33 percent, led by a 42 percent jump in Russia.  “Stada delivered a very impressive operating performance
that was driven by strong organic growth in the CIS/Eastern
Europe region,” Thomas Maul, an analyst at DZ Bank AG, wrote in
a note to clients today. He recommends buying the stock.  Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortization climbed 7 percent to 98.5 million euros from 92.3
million euros a year earlier. Earnings per share missed
estimates because of a temporary increase in the  tax rate , said
James Vane-Tempest, an analyst at Jefferies International Ltd.
in London who has an underperform rating on the stock.  To contact the reporter on this story:
