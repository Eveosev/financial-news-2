Gulf of  Mexico  crudes on the spot
market weakened as Brent declined, making cargoes from overseas
more attractive to buyers.  Brentâ€™s premium over U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate
narrowed 52 cents to $8.78 a barrel. Gulf crudes compete with
foreign oils priced against Brent for space in U.S. Gulf Coast
refineries.  Light Louisiana Sweet weakened by 85 cents to $10.45 a
barrel more than WTI at 4:18 p.m., the smallest premium since
May 24, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Heavy Louisiana
Sweet fell 75 cents to $10.35 a barrel more than WTI.  Mars Blend slipped 90 cents to $6.30 a barrel more than the
U.S. benchmark. Crude from the Poseidon formation weakened by 45
cents to a $6.30 premium.  Crude from the Southern Green Canyon saw its premium dip by
65 cents to $5.20, and Thunder Horse weakened 10 cents to an $9
premium.  To contact the reporter on this story:
