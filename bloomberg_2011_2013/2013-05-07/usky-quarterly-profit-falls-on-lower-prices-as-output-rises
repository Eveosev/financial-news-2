Husky Energy Inc. (HSE) , the integrated oil
natural gas producer controlled by Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka- Shing, said first-quarter profit fell as prices for crude oil,
natural gas liquids and bitumen fell.  Net income declined to C$535 million ($533 million) or 54
cents a share, from C$591 million, or 60 cents, a year earlier,
the Calgary-based company said in a statement on Marketwired
today. Excluding one-time items, per-share profit was 3 Canadian
cents more than the 53-cent average of 11  analystsâ€™ estimates 
compiled by Bloomberg.  As Husky seeks to increase  oil production  5 percent to 8
percent in each of the next four years, the company is boosting
the amount of western Canadian crude it can process at
refineries in the U.S. Midwest. Husky benefits from lower costs
of Canadian heavy crude at its refineries and  upgrader , which
converts it into light oil.  The price of Western Canada Select, the Canadian  heavy
crude benchmark , fell 12 percent from a year earlier to average
$66.99 a barrel in the quarter, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Output averaged the equivalent of 321,000 barrels of crude
a day from 320,000 a year earlier.  Husky, which is  70 percent  owned by Li according to data
compiled by Bloomberg, released results before the start of
regular trading on North American markets. The company rose 2.4
percent to C$29.92 yesterday in Toronto. The shares have one
buy, 16 hold and three sell  recommendations  from analysts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
