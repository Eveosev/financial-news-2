BP Plc (BP/)  failed to increase production
at Azerbaijan’s largest oilfield in the first quarter even after
coming under fire from the nation’s president.  The Azeri-Chirag-Guneshli field in Azerbaijan’s section of
the  Caspian Sea  produced 8.06 million metric tons (662,000
barrels a day) of oil in the first three months of 2013, down
8.4 percent from a year earlier, BP said today in a statement.  In a televised speech in October, President Aliyev
criticized the output slump that started at the end of 2010,
demanding that BP replace those responsible. London-based BP
subsequently switched executives in the region and said it
planned “long-term stabilization of ACG production,” which
made up 77 percent of total Azeri output last year.  The latest decline compares with an 8.3 percent drop in the
first quarter of last year. The offshore natural gas field of
Shah Deniz, also led by BP, increased production 21 percent in
the first quarter to 2.42 billion cubic meters. BP’s local
office in Baku, the Azeri capital, didn’t give an explanation
for the production figures. Tamam Bayatli, BP’s spokeswoman in
the region, couldn’t immediately be reached for comment.  ACG, where partners include State Oil Co. of Azerbaijan, or
Socar,  Statoil ASA (STL) ,  Chevron Corp. (CVX)  and  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) , cut
production 7 percent last year to 32.9 million tons. Socar said
in October output would be 33 million tons this year before
rising to 35 million tons in 2014.  To contact the reporter on this story:
