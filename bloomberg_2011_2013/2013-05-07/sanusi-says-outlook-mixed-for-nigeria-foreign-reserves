Nigeria’s foreign-currency reserves
will probably keep expanding while facing risks from lower-than-
projected oil output and falling prices, central bank Governor
Lamido Sanusi said.  Quantitative easing by central banks in the U.S., the U.K.
and  Japan  “all point to a likelihood of strong capital flows to
emerging and frontier markets” that may benefit Nigeria, Sanusi
said today in an e-mailed response to questions. Still, “the
combination of lower global oil prices and weak output
performance in Nigeria may lead to a slowdown.”  Oil production in  Africa ’s biggest producer fell to 1.81
million barrels a day in March, the lowest level since September
2009, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Nigeria relies on
crude exports for about 80 percent of government revenue and
more than 90 percent of foreign income, according to the central
bank.  Foreign-currency reserves rose 33 percent to $48.9 billion
on May 3 from a year earlier, according to  data  published by the
central bank.  “We always said that the budget based on projections of
about 2.5 million barrels per day was founded on overly
optimistic and unrealistic assumptions,” Sanusi said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
