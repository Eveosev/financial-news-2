European Union Economic and Monetary 
Affairs Commissioner  Olli Rehn  praised Slovenia for taking 
steps to bolster the economy while saying it’s too early to 
know whether the nation can avoid becoming the sixth euro-area
member to need a financial rescue.  “We first want to analyze the programs before
commenting,” Rehn said in an interview today in Brussels.
“Slovenia is intensively preparing a stability and reform
program that will tackle the problems they are facing and
reverse the negative trend in the economy.”  Slovenia plans to increase taxes to make up for a swelling
budget shortfall as the country works to recapitalize its banks.
The Adriatic nation’s overhaul program and bank-recapitalization
plan, which will be presented to the European Commission, are
meant to show Slovenia can avoid requesting outside assistance.  “In these days we are expecting that they will present the
stability and reform programs to the commission,” Rehn said.
“We will then assess them and provide our analysis of the
situation shortly.”    Since the  European debt crisis  broke out in 2009, Greece,
Ireland, Portugal,  Spain  and Cyprus have sought international
emergency aid. Pledges from the euro area and the  International
Monetary Fund  have totaled 496 billion euros ($649 billion).   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
