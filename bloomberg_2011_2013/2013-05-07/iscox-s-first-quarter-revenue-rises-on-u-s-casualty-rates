Hiscox Ltd. (HSX) , the second-biggest
Lloyd’s of London by market value, said first-quarter revenue
rose on higher demand and casualty premium rates in the U.S.  Gross written premiums advanced 12.3 percent to 506.1
million pounds ($787 million) in the three months through March
31, compared with 450.7 million pounds in the year-earlier
period, the Hamilton, Bermuda-based firm said today in a
statement. The period was “benign” for claims, it said.  “We are in a good position to benefit from rate rises in
the U.S. casualty market and it is pleasing to see substantial
growth here,” Chief Executive Officer Bronek Masojada said in
the statement.  Hiscox’s  revenue  has been bolstered by rising demand in the
U.S., the world’s biggest insurance market, after investing in a
dedicated division in the country over the last three years. The
insurer, which also sells policies to U.S. clients through its
unit at Lloyd’s, is seeking to benefit from faster economic
growth and sales of specialist insurance to retail customers.  Hiscox USA posted a 35 percent rise in premiums to $64.3
million, the company said. Its U.K. and Bermuda divisions grew
8.5 percent and 6 percent, respectively.  Hiscox is the third-best performer on the nine-member FTSE
ASX Nonlife Insurance Index this year, increasing 20.2 percent,
compared with the index’s 5.9 percent climb.  To contact the reporter on this story:
