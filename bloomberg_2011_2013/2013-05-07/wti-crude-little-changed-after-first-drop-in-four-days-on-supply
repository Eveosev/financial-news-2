Brent futures dropped for a second day
after industry data showed U.S. crude inventories climbed for a
second week.  Futures dropped as much as 0.8 percent after declining 1
percent yesterday. U.S. crude supplies increased  680,000 barrels 
last week, the  American Petroleum Institute  said. An Energy
Information Administration report today may show stockpiles
gained 2 million barrels, rising from the most in more than 82
years, according to a Bloomberg News survey. The EIA cut its
forecasts for West Texas Intermediate and Brent on increasing
output and lower global consumption. Bank of America Corp. said
WTI will drop to average $90 a barrel this year.  “The oil futures market has a stand-by approach ahead of
the weekly EIA report, and we are seeing some profit-taking,”
Myrto Sokou, an analyst at Sucden Financial Ltd. in  London , said
by phone.  Brent for June settlement fell as much as 87 cents to
$103.53 a barrel and was at $103.87 as of 1:23 p.m. local time
on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The European
benchmark grade was at a premium of $8.12 to WTI compared with
$8.78 yesterday. The spread was $8.58 on May 3, the narrowest
based on closing prices since December 2011.  WTI for June delivery was at $95.75 a barrel, up 13 cents,
in electronic trading on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange. The
volume of all contracts traded was 0.1% percent above the 100-
day average.  Forecasts  WTI will average $93.17 a barrel this year, down 75 cents
from the April projection of $93.92, the EIA, the Energy
Department’s statistical arm, said yesterday in its monthly
Short-Term  Energy Outlook . Brent will average $105.89 in 2013,
down $2.07 from last month’s prediction.  Oil production outside the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries will rise 2.1 percent to 53.85 million
barrels a day in 2013, led by gains in the U.S. and  Canada ,
according to the EIA. The forecast increased by 80,000 barrels
from April’s report. U.S. output will climb 14 percent to 7.42
million barrels a day, the department said.  OPEC will produce 35.88 million barrels a day this year,
the EIA said. Last month’s forecast was 35.98 million. OPEC’s 12
members pump about 40 percent of the world’s crude.  The EIA lowered its 2013 outlook for global oil consumption
to 89.93 million barrels a day from 90 million estimated last
month.  Many Barrels  Bank of America said in a report dated yesterday that the
Brent-WTI spread could widen again unless rules against
exporting U.S. crudes are removed.  “There are way too many barrels in commercial and
strategic storage in the U.S., and the ability of refiners to
keep displacing foreign crudes seems limited going forward,”
the bank said.  U.S. gasoline inventories fell by 186,000 barrels last
week, the API data showed. Supplies are projected to decline by
475,000 barrels in the EIA report, according to the median
estimate of 12 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Distillate-fuel stockpiles, including heating oil and
diesel, rose 1.1 million barrels, according to the API. The EIA
will report a gain of 500,000 barrels, the survey shows.  The API collects stockpile information on a voluntary basis
from operators of refineries, bulk terminals and pipelines. The
government requires that reports be filed with the EIA for its
weekly survey.  “The outlook is going to remain muted for the U.S. for
consumption of oil,” said  David Lennox , an analyst at Fat
Prophets in Sydney. “There is also U.S. domestic supply, which
continues to grow.”  China ’s net  crude imports  rose to the highest level in
three months in April, data from the General Administration of
Customs in Beijing showed today. Deliveries climbed to 5.62
million barrels a day, from 5.39 million a day in March. China
is the world’s second-biggest oil consumer, accounting for 11
percent of the world’s demand in 2011, according to  BP Plc (BP/) ’s
Statistical Review of World Energy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
