The International Monetary Fund will
disburse 39 million euros ($51 million) to Bosnia-Herzegovina,
as part of a stand-by loan program to help the country overhaul
its economy and stabilize public finances.  The second tranche under the $509 million-euro arrangement
brings lending to the former Yugoslav republic to almost 156
million euros, the Washington-based lender said in an e-mailed
statement. The Fund approved “reforms of war-related benefit
programs,” reduction of health-care costs and administration
cuts.  The IMF urged the government to keep spending tight this
year to ensure fiscal consolidation, according to the statement.
Some slippage on revenue targets was possible “in the event of
weaker-than-expected growth,” the IMF said.  Bosnia needs to boost competitiveness and create jobs in
order to unlock its growth potential, the IMF said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
