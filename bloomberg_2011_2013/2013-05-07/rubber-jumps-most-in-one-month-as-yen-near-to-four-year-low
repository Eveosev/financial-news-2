Rubber surged the most in a month as
 Japan ’s currency dropped to near a four-year low, boosting the
appeal of yen-based futures, and as U.S. payrolls climbed.  Rubber for October delivery climbed as much as 5.9 percent
to 268.4 yen a kilogram ($2,714 a metric ton), the biggest gain
for a most-active contract since April 8. Futures traded at
266.3 yen on the Tokyo Commodity Exchange at 10:15 a.m., paring
this year’s loss to 12 percent. The market reopened today after
a four-day weekend.  The yen weakened to 99.44 per dollar, nearing a four-year
low of 99.95 reached on April 11. The Japanese currency came
under pressure amid expectations that the U.S. economic recovery
will gather pace after a report showed the nation added more
jobs than forecast last month.  “Optimism grew that the U.S. recovery is picking up,
boosting investor appetite for rubber futures,”  Kazuhiko Saito ,
an analyst at broker Fujitomi Co. in Tokyo, said by phone today.  American payrolls grew by 165,000 workers last month after
a revised 138,000 gain in March that was higher than first
estimated, Labor Department figures showed May 3. U.S. economic
growth will slow to 1.5 percent this quarter before
strengthening to 2.6 percent in the final three months of the
year, according to Bloomberg surveys.  Rubber for delivery in September on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange lost 0.4 percent to 19,865  yuan  ($3,221) a ton. Thai
rubber free-on-board added 0.6 percent to 85.85 baht ($2.90) a
kilogram on May 3, according to the Rubber Research Institute of
 Thailand .  To contact the reporter on this story:
