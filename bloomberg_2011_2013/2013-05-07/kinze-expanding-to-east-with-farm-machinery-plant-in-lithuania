Kinze Manufacturing Inc., an Iowa-
based maker of farm machinery, will open it’s first factory
outside the U.S. in  Lithuania  this year to support expansion in
central and eastern Europe.  The Baltic plant is “geared to increasing sales in  Russia ,
Ukraine and the whole of the European Union,” Kinze Vice
President Susanne Veatch said today in a joint statement e-
mailed by Lithuania’s investment agency in Vilnius. Important EU
markets include the  Czech Republic , Bulgaria and Hungary, she
said.  Kinze, which says it’s the U.S.’s second-biggest producer
of planting and seeding equipment, this autumn will start an
assembly line at a site near Vilnius, the Lithuanian capital. By
2017, it will build up to full manufacturing with a staff of 250
beginning in 2017, according to the statement.  Lithuania is seeking to attract more investments in the
field of mechanical engineering to develop a modern metalworking
and equipment manufacturing cluster for eastern European
markets, Prime Minister Algirdas Butkevicius said in the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
