Israel ’s  Finance Ministry  proposed
raising taxes and cutting planned spending in the draft budget
for 2013-14 it presented today.  A copy of the plan the ministry sent by e-mail today set
2013 spending at 388 billion shekels ($109 billion). The  budget 
for 2014 was set at 408 billion shekels. The ministry proposed
the plans be brought to parliament for approval no later than
June 10.  Israel’s Cabinet on May 5 approved Finance Minister Yair Lapid’s proposal to raise the budget deficit target to 4.65
percent of economic output this year, a level the central bank
has said is high. Standard & Poor’s lowered the country’s local
currency rating to A+/A-1 from AA/A-1+, citing “recent fiscal
slippage.”  The financial daily Calcalist said the budget plan includes
a proposed 1.5 percentage point increase in income tax across
all brackets and an added 1 percentage point to value-added tax,
bringing it to 18 percent. Corporate tax will also be boosted to
26 percent.  The Globes financial daily said the budget pares 7 billion
shekels from planned spending, including public sector wage
raises and defense outlays.  Spending in 2012 was 385 billion shekels.  To contact the reporter on this story:
