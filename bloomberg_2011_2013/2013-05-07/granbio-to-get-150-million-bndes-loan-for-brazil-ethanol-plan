Banco Nacional de Desenvolvimento
Economico & Social,  Brazil ’s development bank, will loan a
division of GranBio Investimentos SA 300.3 million reais ($149.6
million) to build the world’s second plant that produces ethanol
from crop waste.  The 350 million-real plant is planned for the northeastern
city of Sao Miguel dos Campos and will be able to produce 82
million liters (22 million gallons) of fuel a year from sugar-
cane residues, the Rio de Janeiro-based lender said in an e-
mailed statement today. BNDES, as it is known, owns 15 percent
of Sao Paulo-based GranBio.  The technology allows mills to produce 45 percent more fuel
from cane’s straw and crushed stems. The first such plant was
built in  Italy , according to the statement.  GranBio said in January it expected to receive 280 million
reais in financing from the bank for the project.  To contact the reporter on this story:
