Tedy Bruschi, Orlando Pace, Danny Wuerffel and Tommie Frazier were among 14 people elected to
college football’s Hall of Fame.  Former  Wisconsin  running back Ron Dayne, North Carolina
State tailback Ted Brown, Texas defensive back Jerry Gray,
Kentucky end Steve Meilinger, Oklahoma linebacker Rod Shoate,
Michigan State linebacker Percy Snow and Baylor quarterback Don
Trull also were elected, the National Football Foundation said
in a  news release .  The group, choosing players from college football’s top
division, announced yesterday that former Miami quarterback
Vinny Testaverde also will be enshrined.  The 12 players will join two coaches -- Wayne Hardin, who
led Navy and Temple, and Bill McCartney, who was at Colorado
from 1982-94 -- for the Dec. 10 induction at the 56th National
Football Foundation awards dinner in New York.  Bruschi, who played linebacker for the  National Football
League ’s New England Patriots from 1996 to 2008, was a defensive
end for the University of  Arizona  from 1992 to 1995, ending his
college career with 52 sacks to tie for the all-time lead at the
top level of the sport.  Pace played offensive tackle at  Ohio State University  from
1994 to 1996 and was a two-time unanimous All-American. He was
the first pick in the 1997  NFL draft , for the  St. Louis Rams .  Wuerffel, a quarterback, won the Heisman Trophy, given to
college football’s top player, in 1996 while leading the
University of Florida to a national championship.  Frazier, also a quarterback, helped the University of
Nebraska to national titles in 1994 and 1995, finishing his
college career with a 33-3 record as a starter.  Testaverde and Dayne also won Heismans, while seven of
those elected were named first-team All-Americans in multiple
years.  Players must have been recognized as first-team All-
Americans to become eligible. They can be elected 10 years after
completing college play and their “post football record as a
citizen is also weighed,” according to the National Football
Foundation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
