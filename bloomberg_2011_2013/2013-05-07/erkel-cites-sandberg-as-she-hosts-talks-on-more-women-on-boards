Chancellor Angela Merkel  said that
German companies must do more to raise the “snail’s pace” at
which they are appointing women to senior management posts.  Merkel, in opening remarks to a conference in Berlin today
with about 75 women in leading positions in business, science,
the arts and administration, said that companies hadn’t held to
their promise to raise the numbers of women in top posts. While
a voluntary commitment on behalf of companies is preferable to
legislation now, “something has to move” to overcome the lack
of progress to date, she said.  “We have to make sure that more women get leading
positions,” Merkel said. “Right now we have a waste of human
resources.” She cited recent talks she held with Facebook Inc.
Chief Operating Officer  Sheryl Sandberg , when they discussed
some of the “controversial theses” of Sandberg’s book. Merkel
didn’t elaborate.  Merkel, who hosted the event in the chancellery under the
banner of “reassuring women to take responsibility,” has been
criticized by opposition parties for refusing to legislate now
to achieve those aims. With federal elections on Sept. 22,
Merkel’s coalition rebuffed an opposition move last move to set
binding quotas for women on boards with immediate effect, and
instead agreed to introduce a quota of 30 percent from 2020.  To contact the reporter on this story:
