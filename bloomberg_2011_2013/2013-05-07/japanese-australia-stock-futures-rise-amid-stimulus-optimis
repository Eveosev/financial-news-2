earnings and as investors await Chinese trade data.  American Depositary Receipts  of  Canon Inc. (7751) , a camera maker
that gets 80 percent of sales outside Japan, climbed 0.6
percent. Those of  Coca-Cola Amatil Ltd. (CCL)  rose 1.2 percent,

reports earnings.  Futures on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  expiring in

Matthew Sherwood, Sydney-based head of investment market
research at Perpetual Ltd., which manages about $25 billion.
“Economic data remains in the Goldilocks range -- weak enough
to warrant continued stimulus, but strong enough to keep
earnings expectations positive.”  Interest Rates  Reserve Bank  of Australia Governor  Glenn Stevens  and his
board yesterday cut the benchmark  interest rate  to a record-low

if needed after reducing them to the lowest ever last week.  Futures on  Hong Kong ’s Hang Seng Index gained 0.9 percent

from a year earlier, below a government assumption for 2013 of
3.5 percent, according to the median estimate of economists.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index, the benchmark regional
equities gauge, climbed 9.8 percent this year through yesterday
amid optimism the Bank of Japan will deploy more measures to
beat deflation and policy makers in the U.S. and Europe remain
on standby to buoy growth.  Relative Value  That left the gauge yesterday trading at 14.3 times average
estimated earnings compared with 14.7 for the  Standard & Poor’s
500 Index (SPX)  and 13.2 times for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index,
