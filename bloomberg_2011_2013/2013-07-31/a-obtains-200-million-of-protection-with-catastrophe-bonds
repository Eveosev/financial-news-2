The  Metropolitan Transportation
Authority , which suffered $4.8 billion in damage from Superstorm
Sandy last year, obtained $200 million of protection with bonds
designed to guard against wreckage linked to storm surges.  New York  City’s subway operator is paying less than the
cost of traditional property coverage by buying protection from
MetroCat Re Ltd., a Bermuda-based special-purpose insurer that
issued the three-year securities, the MTA said today in a
statement. The bonds yield 4.5 percentage points more than
three-month Treasury bills, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  After Sandy struck New York on Oct. 29, triggering a tidal
surge that inundated rail stations and tunnels, it became
“exceedingly difficult for the MTA to obtain insurance,”
Thomas Prendergast, chairman and chief executive officer of the
authority, said in the statement. “But as a result of this
savvy and novel reinsurance arrangement, we are now in a
stronger position should our area, God forbid, face another
large-scale storm-surge event within the next three years.”  Bond investors would stand to lose money on the notes,
rated BB- at  Standard & Poor’s , if future storm surges exceed
certain thresholds that Sandy would have breached, triggering
payments to the MTA’s First Mutual Transportation Assurance Co.,
according to a July 12 report from S&P analyst Gary Martucci.  To contact the reporter on this story:
