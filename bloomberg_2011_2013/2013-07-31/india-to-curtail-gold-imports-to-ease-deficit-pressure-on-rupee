India  will contain gold imports
below 845 metric tons this year as Asia’s third-biggest economy
takes steps to curb a record current-account deficit and defend
the currency, Finance Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram said.  Inbound shipments of bullion fell in June and July from a
year earlier and the government is determined to limit imports
below the amount bought in the year ended March, Chidambaram
told reporters in New Delhi today. Imports between July 1 and
July 25 were 45 tons, he said, without elaborating.  India, the world’s largest bullion user, has doubled a tax
on imports this year and tightened rules on overseas purchases
to tackle a surge in demand after bullion entered a bear market
in April. The rupee slumped to a record this month on concern
that the current-account deficit will widen from a record in the
year ended March. The deficit is the biggest risk to the $1.9
trillion economy, according to the central bank.  “We expect to save considerable amount of foreign
exchange” on account of reduced gold imports, which were about
$50 billion in 2012-2013, Chidambaram said. “Some more steps
are on the anvil to fund the current-account gap” and the
government may curtail imports of non-essential items, he said.  Gold consumption in India, which ships in almost all the
bullion it uses, accounted for 20 percent of global demand in
2012, according to data from the World Gold Council.  The  Reserve Bank of India  on July 22 made it mandatory for
importers to set aside 20 percent for re-exports as jewelry. The
measures to moderate demand boosted the premium that jewelers
pay to importers to about $10 an ounce over the London spot
price from as low as $4 a week earlier, according to the the All
India Gems & Jewellery Trade Federation.  Borrowing Norms  Spot gold gained 0.3 percent to $1,330.73 an ounce at 4:48
p.m. in Mumbai, paring losses to 21 percent this year. Gold for
delivery in August fell 0.4 percent to 28,580 ($472) rupees per
10 grams on the  Multi Commodity Exchange of India Ltd. (MCX)   India plans to ease overseas borrowing norms for companies
in consultation with the central bank and is looking at steps to
increase investments from Indians overseas to finance the
current-account shortfall, Chidambaram said.  The  current-account deficit , the broadest measure of trade
tracking goods, services and investment income, widened to $87.8
billion in the year ended March 31 from $78.2 billion in
2011-2012, according to official data. The rupee touched a
record low of 61.2125 per dollar on July 8.  To contact the reporters on this story:
