U.S. gasoline  pump prices  may follow
July’s 14-cent rise with another increase in August, according
to AAA, the nation’s largest motoring organization.  July’s average price of $3.58 a gallon is the third-highest
on record for the month, Heathrow, Florida-based AAA said today
in a statement. The potential for late-summer hurricanes and
refinery problems at a time when many Americans take late-summer
trips may boost prices in coming weeks.  The average jumped 33 cents a gallon last August because of
refinery shutdowns and the impact of Hurricane Isaac along the
Gulf Coast, AAA said in a statement today.  “Millions of Americans take long road trips in August and
any unexpected production problems can result in serious supply
and demand issues,” Avery Ash, a spokesman for AAA in
 Washington , said in the statement.  July prices increased at the fastest rate since February,
propelled by higher “crude costs, refinery glitches and rising
summer demand,” according to Ash.  The average is $3.627, AAA said today on its website.
Prices are 12.7 cents higher than a year ago and reached a
yearly high of $3.786 on Feb. 26. The low for the year is $3.291
on Jan. 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
