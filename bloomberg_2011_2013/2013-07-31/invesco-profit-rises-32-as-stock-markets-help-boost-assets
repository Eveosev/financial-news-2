  Invesco Ltd. (IVZ) , owner of the Invesco
and PowerShares funds, said second-quarter profit rose 32
percent as equity market gains boosted assets and the fees
charged for overseeing them.  Net income increased to $202.6 million, or 45 cents a
share, from $153.9 million, or 34 cents, a year earlier,
Atlanta-based Invesco said today in a statement. Excluding
certain items, adjusted earnings of 50 cents a share missed the
average  estimate  of 51 cents in a Bloomberg survey of 21
analysts.  “Invesco’s flow prospects remain healthy reflecting
favorable asset positioning, strong investment performance track
records and a broadening distribution footprint,” Michael Kim,
an analyst with Sandler O’Neill & Partners LP in New York, wrote
in a research note before the results were released.  Chief Executive Officer Martin Flanagan has used
acquisitions to broaden Invesco’s offerings beyond traditional
stock and bond mutual funds since taking over in 2005. Invesco’s
assets climbed 12 percent in the 12 months ended June 30 to
$705.6 billion, according to preliminary figures reported by the
company on July 10. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index advanced 18
percent in the same period, and the MSCI All Country World Index
rose 14 percent.  Assets under management excludes money managed by Atlantic
Trust Private Wealth Management, the unit Invesco agreed in
April to sell to Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce,  Canada ’s
fifth-largest bank, for $210 million. Atlantic Trust managed
$21.7 billion as of June 30. The companies said at the time they
expect to complete the deal in the second half of 2013.  Shares Rally  Invesco announced results before the start of regular U.S.
trading. Its shares rose 24 percent this year through yesterday,
compared with a 29 percent gain by Standard & Poor’s 20-company
 index  for asset managers and custody banks.  BlackRock Inc. (BLK) , the world’s largest asset manager, said
July 18 its second-quarter net income rose 32 percent to $729
million as investors deposited a net $11.9 billion in the New
York-based company’s funds, driven by multiasset products and
index funds. T. Rowe Price Group Inc. missed analysts’ estimates
July 24 after institutional clients led a record $8 billion in
withdrawals in the quarter. The Baltimore-based money manager
said net income increased 20 percent to $245.8 million.  (Invesco will hold a conference call at 9 a.m. New York
time. The call-in number is 1-866-617-1526 in the U.S. and
Canada, and +1-210-795-0624 elsewhere.)  To contact the reporter on this story:
