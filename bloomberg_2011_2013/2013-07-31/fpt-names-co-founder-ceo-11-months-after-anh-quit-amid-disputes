FPT Corp.,  Vietnam ’s largest listed
telecommunications company, appointed co-founder Bui Quang Ngoc
as chief executive officer, almost 11 months after Truong Dinh
Anh resigned over disagreements with the board.  FPT’s board picked Ngoc because he “deeply understands”
the company, has broad management experience and can deploy new
strategies, Chairman Truong Gia Binh, who served as CEO
preceding Ngoc, said in an e-mailed statement today.  The leadership shift comes as Hanoi-based FPT, which has
offices in 11 countries, moves to increase sales overseas by
providing cloud computing, big data and mobile technology
services.  “There won’t be a transition period,” Lam Nguyen, a Ho
Chi Minh City-based analyst at International Data Corp., said in
a phone interview. “He is familiar with the culture.”  FPT was unchanged at 43,000 dong as of the close in Ho Chi
Minh City trading. The stock has rallied 22 percent so far this
year, outpacing the 19 percent advance in the benchmark  VN
Index. (VNINDEX)   The company will achieve a revenue target of $1.3 billion
this year, compared with $1.2 billion in 2012, Binh said in a
July 17 interview.  Net income rose 7 percent in the first half from a year
earlier to 803 billion dong ($38 million), the company reported
July 25. Revenue increased 9 percent to 12.48 trillion dong for
the same period.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
