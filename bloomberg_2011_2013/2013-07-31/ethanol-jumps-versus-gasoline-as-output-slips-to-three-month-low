Ethanol strengthened against
gasoline after the U.S. government reported production of the
biofuel reached a three-month low last week.  The discount to gasoline narrowed 3.33 cents to 75.02 cents
a gallon at 12:17 p.m. New York time as the Energy Information
Administration said  output  fell 2.5 percent to 832,000 barrels a
day, the lowest level since April 12, and  imports  tumbled 68
percent to 13,000 barrels a day.  “The industry has cut back on production dramatically over
the past few weeks,” said Michael Breitenbach, a broker and
director of research at Blue Ocean Brokerage LLC in New York.
“Imports have been arriving at a slower pace than earlier in
the summer.”  Denatured ethanol for August delivery rose 5.9 cents, or
2.6 percent, to $2.294 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Prices have climbed 4.8 percent this year.  Gasoline for August delivery increased 2.57 cents, or 0.9
percent, to $3.0442 a gallon on the New York Mercantile
Exchange. The contract covers reformulated gasoline, made to be
blended with ethanol before delivery to filling stations.  Stockpiles of the additive plunged 4.7 percent to 16.5
million barrels, according to the EIA, the Energy Department’s
statistical unit. That’s 15 percent below year-earlier levels.  Corn for September delivery rose 3.5 cents, or 0.7 percent,
to $4.99 a bushel in  Chicago . The more-actively traded December
contract gained 1.5 cents to $4.79.  The corn crush spread, or the cost difference between a
gallon of ethanol and the corn needed to make it, based on
September contracts, was 37 cents, up from 34 cents yesterday.  Inventory Projection  Inventories of the ethanol feedstock before the September
harvest may be 26 percent below last year, according to U.S.
Agriculture Department data.  Tracking certificates called Renewable Identification
Numbers, or RINs, are used by the government and refiners to
monitor compliance with the energy law.  Corn-based-ethanol RINs added 7 cents today to $1.09, while
 advanced RINs , which cover Brazilian sugarcane-based ethanol and
biodiesel, climbed 9 cents to $1.15, data compiled by Bloomberg
show.  In cash market trading, ethanol in the U.S. Gulf was
unchanged at $2.32 a gallon; on the West Coast prices gained 5
cents to $2.48; in Chicago the additive rose 1.5 cents to $2.25;
and in New York the biofuel added 1 cent to $2.375 a gallon,
data compiled by Bloomberg show.  West Coast ethanol’s premium over the Gulf widened 5 cents
to 16 cents, while Chicago’s discount to New York slimmed 0.5
cent to 12.5 cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
