Norway ’s unemployment rate
unexpectedly dropped in May, damping speculation the central
bank will cut interest rates in September.  Unemployment, adjusted for seasonal variations, fell to 3.4
percent in May from 3.5 percent in April, Oslo-based  Statistics
Norway  said on its website today. Unemployment was seen at 3.5
percent, according to the median estimate of four economists
surveyed by Bloomberg.  Norway’s central bank in June signaled an increased chance
for an  interest rate  cut this year as inflation is slower than
projected amid weakening economic growth in western Europe’s
largest oil producer.  The krone pared some losses, trading down less than 0.1
percent at 7.88 per euro as of 10:08 a.m.  Norway’s $740 billion sovereign wealth fund, the world’s
biggest, has shielded the nation from the fallout of the euro
area’s shrinking economy. While survey unemployment in Norway is
up from 2012 levels, it remains below the record 12.2 percent
rate in the 17-nation euro area.  Norges bank estimates unemployment will average 3.75
percent this year and the next.  To contact the reporter on this story:
