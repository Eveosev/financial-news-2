British police said 22 law firms
were among the clients of four private investigators who were
jailed last year for using illegal methods to get information.  The  Serious and Organised Crime Agency  compiled the list of
clients ahead of the successful prosecution of the private
detectives. It also includes 10 insurance companies, an  oil
company  and eight companies in financial services.  SOCA passed the list to Parliament’s Home Affairs
Committee, asking it not to publish the names because it could
prejudice future investigations, and because it wasn’t saying
any of the companies on its list had broken the law. The
committee published the categories of companies today as a
compromise. Deputy Prime Minister  Nick Clegg  said the government
will publish plans later today to regulate private
investigators.  “I am very concerned about the role of rogue private
investigators who work at the margins of what is acceptable,”
Clegg told reporters in  London . “It is not right to have guns
for hire out of and beyond the usual rules.  To contact the reporter on this story:
