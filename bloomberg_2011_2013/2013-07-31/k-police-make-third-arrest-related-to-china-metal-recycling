Hong Kong’s police arrested a third
person related to the investigation into  China Metal Recycling
Holdings Ltd. (773) , the company that the city’s securities regulator
accused of fabricating sales.  A 37 year-old man surnamed Fung was arrested yesterday
morning, according to a police statement dated July 30. Two
people were arrested on July 26 in connection with the case and
both are currently on bail, an earlier police statement said. It
identified the two as a 46 year-old man surnamed Lam and a 42
year-old woman surnamed Lai.  A woman who answered the phone at China Metal’s office said
the company had no comment. Alan Fung, the company’s group
finance director, didn’t immediately respond to an e-mail.  The Securities and Futures Commission is seeking to
liquidate the Hong Kong-based scrap metal dealer after it found
evidence that the company inflated the size of its business to
gain a listing in 2009. China Metal adds to a series of
accounting scandals at Chinese companies that is prompting
regulators to toughen enforcement and share-sale rules.  The court will hear the case on Aug. 2 on the continuation
of appointment of provisional liquidators, where China Metal
will have the chance to address the allegations, the SFC said in
a July 29 statement.  The case is Securities and Futures Commission and China
Metal Recycling Holdings Limited, HCCW 210/2013,  Hong Kong ’s
Court of First Instance.  To contact the reporter on this story:
