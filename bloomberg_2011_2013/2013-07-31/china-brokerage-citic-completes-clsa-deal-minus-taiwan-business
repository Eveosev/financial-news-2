Citic Securities Co. (6030) ,  China ’s largest
broker by market value, completed its purchase of  Credit
Agricole SA (ACA) ’s CLSA unit, withholding $100 million of the $1.25
billion price pending its acquisition of the Taiwan operation.  Citic is paying $841.7 million for the 80.1 percent of CLSA
that it doesn’t already own, and will pay about $100 million
more if it wins regulatory approval and buys the Taiwan business
in the next three years, the Beijing-based buyer said in a
statement to the Hong Kong stock exchange. The change won’t have
a material impact on CLSA’s operations, Citic said.  Citic Securities had said the deal will boost  the share of
revenue  from overseas operations to 20 percent, up from the 5
percent that it gets now primarily from its Hong Kong unit. The
brokerage, founded in 1995, is controlled by government-owned
Citic Group Corp., which holds a 23 percent stake.  The parent company was established in 1979 by Rong Yiren --
who went on to become a vice president of China -- to support
former leader  Deng Xiaoping ’s experiment with open markets. Its
businesses now span banking to real estate and oil exploration,
and the group reports directly to China’s cabinet.  Citic completed the $310.3 million purchase of 19.9 percent
of CLSA last year.  Taiwanese law prohibits Chinese brokerages from owning more
than 15 percent of an unlisted broker on the island, which has
been governed separately from the mainland since a civil war
that ended in 1949.  If Citic wins approval to buy the Taiwan operation, the
final price will depend on the unit’s net book value.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
