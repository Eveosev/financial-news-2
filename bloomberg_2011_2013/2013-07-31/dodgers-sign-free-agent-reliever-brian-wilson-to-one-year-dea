The Los Angeles Dodgers signed free-agent reliever  Brian Wilson , who led  Major League Baseball  with
163 saves from 2008 to 2011 for the  San Francisco Giants .  Wilson, 31, appeared in only two games last year before
undergoing season-ending surgery on his right elbow and missing
the Giants’ run to a second World Series title in three years.
He became a free agent in December.  A three-time All-Star known for his bushy black beard,
Wilson joins a Dodgers team that’s in first place in the
National League West division. Wilson probably will be a setup
man to closer Kenley Jansen in the Los Angeles bullpen, which
began last night ranking 11th among 15 NL teams with a 3.82
earned run average.  Wilson, who signed a one-year deal, had a 20-20 record with
a 3.21 ERA and 171 saves for the Giants from 2006 through 2012.
He led the NL with 48 saves in 2010, when he was on the mound
for the final out of San Francisco’s World Series win against
the  Texas Rangers . Wilson has struck out 340 batters in 320
career innings in the major leagues.  Wilson last pitched in the majors on April 12, 2012. The
Dodgers are scheduled to play the Giants seven times during
September, the final month of the regular season.  To contact the reporter on this story:
