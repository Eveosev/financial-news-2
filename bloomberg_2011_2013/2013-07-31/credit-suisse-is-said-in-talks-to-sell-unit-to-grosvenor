Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) ,
Switzerland’s second-largest bank, is in advanced talks to sell
its private-equity business to Grosvenor Capital Management LP,
according to two people familiar with the matter.  The parties could reach an agreement as soon as this week,
said the people, asking not to be identified because the
discussions are private. A deal hasn’t been finalized and the
talks could still fall apart, according to the people.  Credit Suisse joins a growing number of financial
institutions that sold off private-equity divisions as banks
face regulatory pressure to reduce investments with their own
money. JPMorgan Chase & Co. announced last month it was spinning
out the last remaining private-equity unit, One Equity Partners,
which manages $4.5 billion JPMorgan capital, into a stand-alone
company.  Grosvenor Capital, which is based in Chicago, invests about
$23 billion of client assets in  hedge funds . Credit Suisse’s
unit oversees assets of about $20 billion that are invested in
private-equity funds.  The Wall Street Journal reported earlier today that a deal
may be announced as early as this week.  Jack Grone, a spokesman for Credit Suisse, and  Tom Johnson ,
a spokesman for Grosvenor at Abernathy MacGregor Group Inc.,
declined to comment on the talks.  To contact the reporters on this story:
