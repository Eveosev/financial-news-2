Malaysia ’s ringgit declined the most
in three weeks and bonds extended losses after  Fitch Ratings  cut
the nation’s credit outlook to negative from stable, citing
rising debt levels and a lack of budgetary reform.  The currency dropped to a three-year low and 10-year bond
yields climbed to the highest since April 2011 after Fitch said
in a statement yesterday that Malaysia’s public finances are its
“key rating weakness.” The shrinking current-account surplus
and $2.9 billion of sovereign debt maturing today raises the
risk of capital outflows, putting the ringgit on course for its
worst month in more than a year.  “The dynamics of Malaysia’s current-account surplus
getting narrower and the fiscal deficit getting wider are
negative for the ringgit,” said  Nizam Idris , head of fixed
income and currency strategy at Macquarie Bank Ltd. in Singapore.
“The shorter-term issue is the bond repayment, which the market
has been worried about.”  The ringgit depreciated 0.6 percent, the biggest decline
since July 8, to 3.2462 per dollar as of 10:33 a.m. in  Kuala
Lumpur , according to data compiled to Bloomberg. The currency
touched 3.2475, the weakest level since July 2010, and lost 2.7
percent this month.  The yield on 3.48 percent government notes due March 2023
rose one basis point to 4.11 percent, the highest for a
benchmark 10-year note since April 2011 and adding to an 18
basis-point increase yesterday. The two-year onshore interest-rate swap climbed two basis points to 3.36 percent, matching the
highest level since August 2011, based on closing prices
compiled by Bloomberg.  Deficit Target  Fitch affirmed Malaysia’s long-term foreign currency-denominated rating at A-, the fourth-lowest investment grade.
It will be difficult for the government to meet a 3 percent
deficit target in 2015 without more consolidation, the company
said in the statement.  Malaysia’s debt to gross domestic product ratio of 53.5
percent is higher than 25 percent in Indonesia, 51 percent in
the  Philippines  and 43 percent in Thailand, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. It’s also approaching the government’s 55
percent limit. The  budget deficit  widened to 4.7 percent of GDP
in 2012 from 3.8 percent in 2011, led by a 19 percent rise in
spending on public wages ahead of the May election, Fitch said.  Pressure on the ringgit will remain until the external
outlook improves and  Bank Negara Malaysia  will probably defend
the ringgit’s 3.25 per dollar level, according to a DBS Group
Holdings Ltd. research note today. The current-account surplus
will narrow to 6 percent in 2013 from 6.1 percent last year and
12 percent in 2011, a Bloomberg survey of economists shows.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves
in the  exchange rate  used to price options, rose 20 basis points,
or 0.20 percentage point to a three-week high of 8.74 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
