39 Celsius) as the heat indexes top 105 degrees with humidity,
the service said. The lows will be only about 80 degrees.  The Electric Reliability Council of Texas Inc., which
manages the flow of power for 23 million customers, expects

than yesterday’s peak of 62,998. Top demand so far this summer
was 64,426 megawatts on June 27, according to Ercot.  “There currently is plenty of generation available to
serve the anticipated needs,” Robbie Searcy, a spokeswoman for
Ercot in Austin, said in an e-mail.  Spot power at Ercot’s benchmark North hub, which includes
deliveries to  Dallas , rose $7.58, or 29 percent, to average
$34.07 a megawatt-hour during the hour ended at noon Central
time compared with the same hour yesterday, grid data compiled
by Bloomberg showed.  One megawatt is enough to power 500 average Texas homes
under normal conditions, according to Ercot. Last summer,
electricity use topped 66,000 megawatts in June.  Northeast Mixed  Northeast prices were mixed amid seasonal weather as power
