(Corrects headline to say Blackstone is buying offices
from  GE Capital .)  Blackstone Group LP (BX) , the largest
manager of private-equity real estate funds, is poised to buy
seven Australian office buildings from  GE Capital Real Estate 
for A$290 million ($262 million), according to three people
familiar with the matter.  Blackstone is expected to complete the purchase within a
week, according to the people, who asked for anonymity as the
deal hasn’t been finalized. The New York-based private-equity
firm, which oversees $229.6 billion in assets, will borrow about
70 percent of the funds for the purchase from GE Capital as part
of the deal, one of the people said.  GE Capital in May agreed to sell seven office buildings in
Perth, Melbourne and Sydney to Australian property trust  Mirvac
Group (MGR)  for A$584 million, as it shifts from real estate
management to lending. Blackstone’s strategy in  Australia  has
been to buy lower-quality assets that need redevelopment or
leasing work.  Paul Heller, Sydney-based managing director at Blackstone,
didn’t immediately respond to a voicemail message seeking
comment. A Sydney-based spokeswoman for GE Capital, who asked
for her name not to be used, declined to comment.  The properties, most of which are considered B or B+
quality assets, are located in major Australian cities including
Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane, one of the people said.  The Australian Financial Review and the Australian
newspapers earlier reported the transaction.  To contact the reporter on this story:
