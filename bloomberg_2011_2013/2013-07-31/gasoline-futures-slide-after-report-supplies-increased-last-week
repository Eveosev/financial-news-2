Gasoline fell after an industry-funded report that supplies of the motor fuel increased last
week.  Futures pared the biggest monthly gain since March 2012
after the  American Petroleum Institute  said stockpiles rose 1.8
million barrels in the week ended July 26. Prices rebounded
briefly on reports that the  U.S. economy  grew more than forecast
in the second quarter and more private-sector jobs were added in
July.  “Gasoline been weighed down by the surprise build in the
API report but we’re seeing support from the GDP figures and job
growth numbers,” said  Andy Lipow , president of Lipow Oil
Associates LLC in Houston.  Gasoline for August delivery fell 3.2 cents, or 1.1
percent, to $2.9865 a gallon at 9:54 a.m. on the  New York

best performer in the Standard & Poor’s GSCI commodity index.  The more actively traded September contract fell 3.28 cents
to $2.9422 a gallon.  The Energy Information Administration is scheduled to
report last week’s stockpiles at 10:30 a.m. today in  Washington .
The EIA will probably say that gasoline inventories fell 1.5
million barrels and that distillate supplies, including diesel
and heating oil, increased 450,000 barrels, according to the
median estimate of 12 analysts in a survey by Bloomberg.  GDP Increases  Gross domestic product, the value of all goods and services
produced, rose at a 1.7 percent annualized rate in the second
quarter, after a 1.1 percent gain the prior quarter, Commerce
Department figures showed today in Washington. The median
forecast of 85 economists surveyed by Bloomberg called for a 1
percent advance.  Consumer spending , the biggest part of the
economy, climbed 1.8 percent after increasing 2.3 percent in the
previous period.  U.S. companies added 200,000 jobs in July, figures from the
Roseland, New Jersey-based ADP Research Institute showed. The
median forecast of 40 economists surveyed by Bloomberg called
for a 180,000 gain.  The  Federal Reserve  may signal its intentions today on
maintaining the scale of its $85 billion in bond purchases.  “The next move in the market is awaiting the Fed
comments,” Lipow said.  Fed Stimulus  The central bank ends a two-day meeting today. Fed Chairman
 Ben S. Bernanke  has said that the bank may start paring stimulus
aimed at furthering growth as the U.S. economy improves.  “If you’re worried about tapering you should be more
worried after this morning’s strong data because the stronger
the economy, the better chance the Fed will start cutting back
on bond purchases sooner than later,” said  Phil Flynn , senior
market analyst at Price Futures Group in  Chicago .  Gasoline’s  crack spread  versus WTI fell $1.70 to $20.17 a
barrel. The fuel’s  premium  to Brent narrowed 59 cents to $17.45.  Pump prices , averaged nationwide, rose 0.3 cent to $3.627 a
