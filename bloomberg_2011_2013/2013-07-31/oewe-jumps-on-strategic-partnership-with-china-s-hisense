Loewe AG (LOE) , the German maker of luxury
televisions that applied for creditor protection two weeks ago,
rose the most in a month after announcing a strategic
partnership with  China ’s  Hisense Electric Co. (600060)   Loewe  climbed  as much as 35 percent, its steepest intraday
gain since June 26, and was trading up 26 percent at 2:01 p.m.
in  Frankfurt , valuing the company at 29 million euros ($38
million). Trading volume was nine times the three-month daily
average.  Loewe, responsible for the first public television
transmission in 1931, and Qingdao, China-based consumer
electronics-maker Hisense will cooperate in purchasing,
production, development, and sales, the Kronach, Germany-based
company said in a statement.  The German company filed for creditor protection on July 16
at Coburg local court to reorganize with the help of strategic
partners and investors. In recent years, Loewe struggled to win
buyers in its dominant European market for flat-screen TVs,
audio speakers and home entertainment systems, as sales fell to
250 million euros last year from 374 million euros in 2008.  With today’s agreement, Loewe will gain access to the
Chinese market while Hisense will make use of its partner’s
distribution network in western Europe. Loewe will start by
distributing Hisense products in  Austria . The Chinese company
will give Loewe access to the latest TV panel technology. In
return, Loewe is offering its software for multimedia and
Internet applications, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
