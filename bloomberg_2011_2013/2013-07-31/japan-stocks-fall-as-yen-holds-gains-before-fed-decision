Japan stocks  fell on the busiest day
of earnings season, with the Topix index completing a third
straight monthly decline, as the yen traded near a one-month
high to the dollar.  Honda Motor Co. (7267) , a carmaker that gets almost half its
revenue from  North America , lost 2.2 percent before a Federal
Reserve policy decision.  Tokyo Electric Power (9501)  Co., the owner of
the crippled Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear power plant, dropped 5.7
percent on a report a local government opposes reactor restarts.
Gungho Online Entertainment Inc., an Internet-game company that
surged tenfold this year through yesterday, plunged 13 percent.
KDDI Corp., the nation’s third-largest mobile carrier by value,
jumped 6.9 percent as operating profit surged.  The Topix dropped 1.5 percent to 1,131.70 at the close in
Tokyo after rising the most in three weeks yesterday. All but
four of the 33 industry groups retreated. The gauge slid 0.2
percent this month. The  Nikkei 225  Stock Average lost 1.5
percent to 13,668.32 today, sliding 0.1 percent on the month.  “Investors don’t want to make big moves until they see how
the Fed’s decision affects U.S. equities,” said  Yutaka Miura , a
senior technical analyst at Mizuho Securities Co., a unit of
 Japan ’s third-biggest lender by market value. “Japanese stocks
were sensitive to the yen’s level throughout the day. They
extended losses toward the close as the yen spiked.”  This month’s decline in the Topix caps the longest losing
streak since September 2011. The  gauge  remains 32 percent higher
for the year amid optimism Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will push
through reforms while the  Bank of Japan  continues record
stimulus to beat deflation. Investor attention is now shifting
to whether reforms will be implemented and the  sales tax  raised
as planned to rein in the fiscal deficit and national debt.  Earnings Peak  Earnings season for Topix companies  peaked  today with 284
firms reporting results. Of the 131 companies on the measure
that have posted quarterly results and for which Bloomberg has
estimates, 52 percent  beat  projections. Profits on the gauge are
projected to rise 66 percent from the previous quarter,
according to a Bloomberg  survey .  Futures on the  S&P 500  fell 0.1 percent today after the
measure gained less than 0.1 percent in  New York  yesterday as
investors weighed earnings. U.S. home prices rose 12.2 percent
in May, the most in more than seven years, a report showed.  The  Federal Open Market Committee , which has said it may
start paring stimulus should the  U.S. economy  meet forecasts,
concludes a two-day meeting today. The Fed will begin to reduce
bond purchases in September, according to a Bloomberg survey of
economists.  Exporters Retreat  Exporters retreated as the yen held gains against the
dollar and strengthened in the last hour of trading. Japan’s
currency touched 97.78 to the greenback today. Honda, Japan’s
third-largest carmaker, lost 2.2 percent to 3,630 yen. Nikon
Corp., the world’s second-biggest camera maker, fell 2.1 percent
to 2,049 yen.  Tokyo Electric Power declined 5.7 percent to 599 yen. Trade
Minister Akira Amari did not persuade Niigata Governor Hirohiko
Izumida to approve reactor restarts at a meeting yesterday, the
Nikkei newspaper reported. The prefecture is home to the
utility’s Kashiwazaki-Kariwa nuclear plant, the world’s largest
by generating capacity.  Japan Airlines Co., which relisted last year after emerging
from bankruptcy, slipped 2.6 percent to 5,200 yen. Jana Partners
LLC, a $6 billion activist hedge fund run by  Barry Rosenstein ,
said it took a stake in the carrier.  Gungho Online tumbled 13 percent to 80,000 yen, its lowest
close since April 24, after plunging 13.4 percent yesterday. The
company is the best-performing stock this year on the MSCI World
Index of developed-market firms.  Takara Holdings Inc. (2531)  slumped 10 percent to 832 yen, the
most in more than two years and the largest slide on the Nikkei
225. The drinks maker yesterday posted an operating loss of 241
million yen for the quarter ended in June.  KDDI Climbs  Companies reporting better earnings advanced. KDDI jumped
6.9 percent to 5,410 yen as operating profit surged 90 percent
from the previous year. Hitachi Ltd. gained 2.8 percent to 658
yen as the electronic-equipment manufacturer increased its
first-half profit forecast by 50 percent to 15 billion yen.  The Topix traded at 1.21 times book value today, compared
with 2.48 for the S&P 500 and 1.70 for the Stoxx Europe 600
Index yesterday. The Japanese gauge’s  historic volatility  was at
24.76 today, down 43 percent from a July 2 high of 43.21.  To contact the reporters on this story:
