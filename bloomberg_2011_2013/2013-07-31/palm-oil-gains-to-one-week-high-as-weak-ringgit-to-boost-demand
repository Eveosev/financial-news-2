Palm oil advanced for a second day
to the highest level in a week on speculation that a slump in
the ringgit to a three-year low may boost exports from Malaysia,
the world’s second-biggest producer.  The contract for delivery in October climbed as much as 1.4
percent to 2,245 ringgit ($691) a metric ton on the Bursa
Malaysia Derivatives, the highest price for most active futures
since July 24, and was at 2,230 ringgit at 11:39 a.m. in  Kuala
Lumpur . Futures are headed for a 4.9 percent drop this month,
the most since February, after reaching the lowest level since
October 2009 on July 26.  The ringgit declined the most in three weeks to the weakest
level since July 2010 after  Fitch Ratings  cut Malaysia’s credit
outlook to negative from stable, citing rising debt levels and a
lack of budgetary reform. Palm oil shipments fell 7 percent to
1.09 million tons in the first 25 days of July from the same
period in June, according to surveyor Intertek. Exports were
down 14 percent in the first 20 days, according to Intertek
data.  “Exports are starting to improve because of the weaker
ringgit,” said Han Qiang Sim, an analyst at Phillip Futures
Pte. in  Singapore . “When you have a weak ringgit, crude  palm
oil  is actually deemed to be cheaper from the importer point of
view. Prices are also supported by technical factors.”  Palm oil’s 14-day relative strength index was below 30 on
July 29, a technical signal to some analysts that an asset’s
price has fallen too fast and is poised to increase.  Soybean oil  for delivery in December advanced 0.9 percent
to 43.07 cents a pound on the Chicago Board of Trade. Soybeans
for delivery in November rose 0.4 percent to $12.0775 a bushel.  Refined palm oil for January delivery climbed 1.8 percent
to 5,444 yuan ($888) a ton on the  Dalian Commodity Exchange ,
while soybean oil gained 1 percent to 7,048  yuan .  To contact the reporter on this story:
