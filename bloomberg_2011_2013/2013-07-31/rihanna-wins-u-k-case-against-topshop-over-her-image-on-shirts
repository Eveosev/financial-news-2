Rihanna won a lawsuit against
Arcadia Group Plc, Topshop’s parent company, over t-shirts it
was selling which featured a photo of the pop star taken during
a video shoot in 2011.  “A substantial number of purchasers are likely to be
deceived into buying the t-shirt because of a false belief that
it has been authorized by Rihanna herself,” Judge Colin Birss
ruled today.  Topshop had a license from the photographer to use the
image, but not one from the singer, according to the ruling.
Rihanna’s lawyers had argued that customers would have been
deceived into thinking that the t-shirt had been approved by
her.  The judge didn’t rule on how much the London-based retailer
would have to pay the singer.  The case is Robyn Rihanna Fenty & ors v. Arcadia Group
Brand Ltd, case no. 12-1378, U.K.  High Court  of Justice,
 Chancery Division .  To contact the reporter on this story:
