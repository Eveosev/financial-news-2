Danish apartment prices are rising
at a pace that may be unsustainable, according to Danske Bank
A/S, the nation’s biggest lender.  Apartment prices rose 2.5 percent in May from April, and
12.4 percent from a year earlier, according to data published
today by Copenhagen-based Statistics Denmark.  “Such a high price rise can’t be justified on the back of
the economic development,”  Steen Bocian , chief economist at
Danske, said in a note. “At this point, we’re not looking at a
bubble in the apartment market, but if the development continues
in the coming quarters, there’s a considerable risk.”  Denmark’s $355 billion economy has struggled to surface
from its latest housing bubble which burst in 2008, wiping about
20 percent off property values in the slump that followed.
Danes, who carry the world’s biggest private debt burden
relative to disposable incomes, have been reluctant to spend on
concern the housing market could fall further.  “One or two years ago, buyers feared more price falls and
held back,” Bocian said. Today’s data suggest that
“expectations for future price developments have changed as the
turnaround in the housing market has taken hold,” he said.  House prices rose 0.5 percent in May from the month
earlier, and gained 3.9 percent from a year earlier, the
statistics office’s data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
