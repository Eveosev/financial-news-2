German stocks  dropped, paring their
monthly gain, as data showed retail sales in Europe’s largest
economy unexpectedly fell in June and as investors awaited the
outcome of the Federal Reserve’s policy meeting.  ThyssenKrupp AG (TKA)  tumbled 4.3 percent after UBS AG advised
investors to sell the shares.  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  lost 2.5 percent
after Handelsblatt reported Germany’s largest bank may have to
raise legal provisions by 1.4 billion euros ($1.9 billion).
 Volkswagen AG (VOW)  rose 1.8 percent as the carmaker posted an
unexpected increase in second-quarter profit.  HeidelbergCement
AG (HEI)  advanced 2.4 percent after earnings beat estimates.  The  DAX Index (DAX)  declined 0.4 percent to 8,239.34 at 9:56 a.m.
in Frankfurt. The equity benchmark has climbed 3.5 percent this
month and 7.1 percent from a low on June 24. The broader HDAX
Index fell 0.3 percent today.  The volume of shares changing hands in DAX-listed companies
was 41 percent higher than the average of the last 30 days,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  German  retail sales , adjusted for inflation and seasonal
swings, dropped 1.5 percent in June from May, when they had
risen 0.7 percent, the Federal Statistics Office in Wiesbaden
said. Economists had predicted an increase of 0.2 percent last
month, according to a Bloomberg News survey. Sales fell 2.8
percent from a year earlier.  Fed Policy  Investors awaited the outcome of the Federal Open Market
Committee’s two-day policy meeting to gauge the timing of
tapering of the Fed’s bond purchases and the shape any further
stimulus would take. The central bank will leave its benchmark
interest rate at 0.25 percent, according to all economists in a
Bloomberg survey.  The European Central Bank and the Bank of England announce
policy decisions tomorrow.  A preliminary report at 8:30 a.m. in  Washington  may show
the U.S. economy grew at a 1 percent annual rate in the second
quarter. It expanded at a 1.8 percent pace in the first three
months of the year.  A separate release at 8:15 a.m. may show companies in the
U.S. hired a net 180,000 workers this month, economists
projected. The ADP Research Institute’s data had showed that
private employers increased their workforce by 188,000 in June.  To contact the reporter on this story:
