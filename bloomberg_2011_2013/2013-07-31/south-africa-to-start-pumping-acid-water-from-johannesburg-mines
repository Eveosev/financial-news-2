South Africa will begin pumping acid
water from disused mines that’s threatening to flood
Johannesburg, according to the  Department of Water Affairs .  Equipment being installed in Germiston, east of
Johannesburg, will be able to pump water from the city’s central
basin within the next four months, said Trevor Balzer, the
department’s acting director-general.  Acid water seeping from shuttered  gold mines  is rising
under Johannesburg and, if left untreated, could pollute its
water supply or flood the city. Iron disulfide, the “fool’s
gold” found in left-over rocks from gold mining, combines with
rainwater to form sulfuric acid and other chemicals.  “We hope to get those pumps operational by October or
November this year to keep the water level below the
environmentally critical level,” Balzer said in an interview
yesterday. The government plans a tender for rights to treat the
water toward the end of the year.  The government already pumps acid water from the western
basin in the Witwatersrand, Balzer said. If levels rise too high
it could contaminate water used for human consumption and
agriculture, according to a 2010 report presented to the  Inter-Ministerial Committee on Acid Mine Drainage .  The acid water under Johannesburg was formed during a gold-mining boom lasting more than a century from the 1890s. It has
progressively filled underground cavities that lie under  South
Africa ’s biggest city, according to a 2011  study  by the
University of the Witwatersrand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
