Indian (SENSEX)  stock-index futures dropped,
signaling the benchmark S&P BSE Sensex index may extend the
longest losing streak in almost four months.  SGX CNX Nifty Index futures  for August delivery fell 0.3
percent to 5,787 at 9:49 a.m. in  Singapore . The underlying CNX
 Nifty (NIFTY)  Index slumped 1.3 percent to 5,755.05 yesterday, the
lowest close since June 27. The Sensex dropped for a fifth day,
also declining 1.3 percent. The gauge has lost 0.2 percent in
July, heading for a second monthly slide. The Bank of  New York 
Mellon  India  ADR Index of U.S.-traded shares tumbled 2.2
percent, the biggest loss since June 24.  India’s central bank left  interest rates  unchanged at its
policy meeting yesterday, saying increases in borrowing costs
earlier this month to stem a slide in the rupee will be reversed
in a measured way as the currency stabilizes. The rupee, down 12
percent in the past six months, has been hurt by a record
current-account deficit and the prospect of reduced U.S.
monetary stimulus, which has spurred capital outflows from
 emerging markets .  “There was expectation that there will be a partial
rollback of the liquidity tightening measures,” Alex Mathews,
head of research at  Geojit BNP Paribas Financial Services Ltd. (GBNP) ,
said by phone from the southern Indian city of Kochi. “That
didn’t come through, plus any rate cut for the next three months
at least is ruled out. That’s spooking investors. A forecast for
slower growth is weakening the rupee. A weak rupee increases a
sell-off by foreign investors and inflation risks.”  Growth Forecast  The  Reserve Bank of India  cut its economic growth forecast
for the year ending March 2014 to 5.5 percent from 5.7 percent
and maintained the benchmark rate at 7.25 percent. The Indian
economy’s resilience to shocks has eroded and the rapid
weakening of the rupee has put the country into a vicious
spiral, RBI Governor Duvvuri Subbarao said yesterday.  The rupee fell 1.8 percent to 60.485 per dollar in Mumbai
yesterday, the biggest drop since June 10, according to prices
from local banks compiled by Bloomberg. It touched 60.575
intraday, the weakest level since July 8, when it plunged to an
unprecedented 61.2125.  “It seems slightly strange for the RBI to tell the market
it will unwind liquidity tightening measures as and when the
currency has stabilized,”  Robert Prior-Wandesforde , an analyst
at Credit Suisse Group AG, wrote in a note e-mailed today. “By
indicating such an approach, it presumably makes it less likely
that stability will actually be achieved.”  Foreign Flows  Global funds  sold a net $35.3 million of local shares on
July 29, paring this year’s net purchases to $12.3 billion, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. They have sold $1.05 billion of
Indian stocks this month, the most among 10 Asian markets
tracked by Bloomberg, extending June’s $1.8 billion sell-off.  ICICI Bank Ltd. (ICICIBC)  may announce today profit of 22.2 billion
rupees ($367 million) for the three months ended June 30,
according to 40 analysts in a Bloomberg survey.  Bharti Airtel Ltd. (BHARTI)  may report quarterly net income of 7.5
billion rupees, according to the median estimate of 33 analysts
in a Bloomberg survey.  Four of the 13 Sensex members that have posted earnings so
far for the June quarter missed analyst estimates. About 27
percent of companies in the measure missed forecasts for the
three months ended March, and 43 percent in the quarter through
December, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  The Sensex has lost 0.4 percent this year and  trades  at
13.7 times projected 12-month earnings, down from a 17-month
peak of 14.2 times on July 23. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index
trades at 10 times.  To contact the reporter on this story:
