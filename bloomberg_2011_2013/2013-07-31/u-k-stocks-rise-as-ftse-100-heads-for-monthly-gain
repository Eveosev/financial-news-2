better and I expect that optimism to continue, certainly for the
rest of the summer,” said Gerard Lane, a strategist at Shore
Capital Group Ltd. in Liverpool,  England . “U.K. earnings have
been OK. One of the things in favor for U.K. companies is that
domestic and U.S. operations have been good.”  U.S. Economy  In the U.S., gross domestic product rose at a 1.7 percent
annualized rate in the second quarter, from a 1.1 percent gain

separate survey, economists forecast that the Fed will start
reducing its $85 billion monthly bond-purchase program in
September.  “Everyone is looking at September as the time frame for
the Fed’s transition into tapering. I’d be surprised if they say
something that would upset that road map,” Lane said.  The volume of shares changing hands in  FTSE 100 (UKX)  companies
