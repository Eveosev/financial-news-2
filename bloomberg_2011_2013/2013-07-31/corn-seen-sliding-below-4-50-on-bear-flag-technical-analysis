Corn may extend its slump this year
to the cheapest level since 2010, according to technical
analysis by INTL FCStone Inc.  After the December contract dropped to a then 31-month low
of $4.895 a bushel on July 5, prices rebounded to $5.2825 on
July 11, creating a so-called bear flag that signals a drop to
$4.47, the lowest since September 2010, said Matt Ammermann, a
commodity risk manager at FCStone in  London . A bear flag, named
for its resemblance to an inverted flag on a pole, occurs when a
security is falling, pauses and consolidates, and continues its
drop.  “The market now is going to be chewing lower, but it’s
probably not going to be a drastic drop because yields are still
a big question mark in the U.S.,” Ammermann said in a telephone
interview yesterday. “Just going by technical support, we’re
looking at $4.47, although psychological support would be
$4.50.”  Corn futures for December delivery are down 21 percent this
year on the Chicago Board of Trade as the U.S. Department of
Agriculture expects the country’s farmers to harvest a record
13.95 billion bushels, 29 percent more than the previous year
when crops were hurt by drought. Sixty-three percent of the corn
crop in main producing states was in good or excellent condition
as of July 28, the USDA says. The harvest starts in September.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
