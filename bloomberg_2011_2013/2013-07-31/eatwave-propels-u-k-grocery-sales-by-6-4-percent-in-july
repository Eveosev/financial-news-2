U.K. grocery sales rose sharply as
the summer heatwave boosted demand for barbecues, soft drinks
and frozen food.  Growth in sales value at the U.K.’s biggest supermarkets
surged 6.4 percent in the four weeks ended July 20, the Nielsen
market research company said in a report today. That compares
with an increase of 2.3 percent in the previous four-week
period. The growth rate was almost twice that achieved by
supermarkets during the London 2012 Olympic Games.  Sales of soft drinks and alcohol accounted for the largest
growth segment, followed by frozen food and fresh produce as
temperatures in the U.K. topped 28 degrees for 17 consecutive
days, the longest spell of that type since 1995. Budget grocer
Aldi had the biggest increase in sales in the 12-week period
ended July 20, with Lidl and upmarket grocers Waitrose Ltd. and
 Marks & Spencer Group Plc (MKS)  also outpacing rivals.  “Waitrose and M&S, in particular, benefited from shoppers’
appetite for fresh foods in July, as did  Sainsbury (SBRY) , who also
increased market share in the last four weeks,” Mike Watkins,
Neilsen’s U.K. head of retailer and business insight, said in
the statement. “Aldi’s momentum continued,” while  Tesco Plc (TSCO) 
and Wal-Mart Stores Inc-owned Asda “didn’t benefit as much from
the surge in spend that the summer weather delivered for some
other retailers.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
