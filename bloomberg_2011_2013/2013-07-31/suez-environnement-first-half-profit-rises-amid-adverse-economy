Suez Environnement (SEV) , Europe’s second-biggest water company, reported first-half profit more than
tripled even as waste volumes contracted in Europe because of an
“adverse” economic environment.  Net income rose to 132 million euros ($175 million) from 40
million euros a year earlier after provisions taken last year
including on a desalination project in Australia weren’t
repeated, Chief Executive Officer Jean-Louis Chaussade said on a
conference call.  Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization, or ebitda, at the Paris-based utility rose 7.2
percent to 1.21 billion euros, beating a 1.19 billion euro
average estimate of four analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  The utility, 34 percent-owned by  GDF Suez (GSZ)  SA, the former
French gas monopoly, reiterated its earnings targets for the
year. The company in February forecast ebitda of at least 2.55
billion euros, and a debt-to-ebitda ratio of about 3 for 2013.
The utility also pledged to keep its dividend payout this year
equal to or higher than the 65 euro cents a share it paid in
2012.  Suez Environnement and its larger rival  Veolia
Environnement SA (VIE)  are seeing waste-treatment volumes decline as
economic weakness in Europe hurts factory output. The utilities
compete in  France  to provide municipal waste and water services.  Suez Environnement’s net debt was little changed at 7.833
billion euros, compared with the year earlier period, according
to today’s statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
