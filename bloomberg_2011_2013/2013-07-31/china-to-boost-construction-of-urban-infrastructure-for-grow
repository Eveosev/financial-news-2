China  will boost construction of
urban infrastructure such as public transportation facilities as
part of its plans to press on with economic reforms and maintain
steady second-half expansion.  Building works will include subway and light rail, the
State Council said in a statement issued after a regular meeting
in Beijing today.  At the same meeting chaired by premier Li Keqiang, the
State Council also studied outsourcing some public services,
according to the statement. No details were given on which
services.  China is targeting 7.5 percent growth this year, a goal
that could be under threat after a second straight quarterly
slowdown. Authorities also want to counter mounting debt risks,
with policy makers ordering an audit of government borrowing
this month and engineering a money-market cash squeeze in June
to encourage banks to better manage liquidity.  The government will also renovate pipelines, build
facilities for the treatment and recycling of waste water and
garbage, as well as strengthen tests and retrofitting of
bridges, according to the statement.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
