Light and Heavy Louisiana Sweet
crudes weakened against West Texas Intermediate as the U.S.
benchmark gained ground today on international marker Brent.  WTI’s discount to Brent narrowed $1.21 to $2.62 a barrel at
2:34 p.m.  New York  time. When Brent drops versus WTI, it
decreases the value of low-sulfur U.S. grades that compete with
West African and North Sea oil priced against the European
benchmark.  Light Louisiana Sweet weakened by 90 cents to a premium of
$5.60 a barrel over WTI at 2:08 p.m. New York time, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium to
WTI narrowed $1 to $5 a barrel.  Southern Green Canyon weakened by $1.75 to a 75-cent
discount to WTI. Mars Blend’s premium to WTI lost 50 cents to 90
cents a barrel. Poseidon’s premium fell 70 cents to 50 cents a
barrel.  The premium for  Thunder Horse , which has a lower sulfur
content than Mars, Poseidon and Southern Green Canyon, was
unchanged at $3.75.  To contact the reporter on this story:
