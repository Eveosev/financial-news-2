The won headed for its biggest
monthly gain in a year after economic growth accelerated and
concern a reduction in Federal Reserve stimulus was imminent
eased.  Government bonds  declined.  Gross domestic product increased 2.3 percent in the second
quarter from a year earlier, compared with 1.5 percent in the
previous three months, official data showed July 25. Daewoo
Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering Co. and Samsung Heavy
Industries Co. won more than 3 trillion won ($2.7 billion) of
drillship contracts this month. None of 54 economists surveyed
by Bloomberg expect the Fed to begin paring asset purchases
after its meeting ending today.  “ South Korea ’s fundamentals were shown solid with better-than-expected GDP and as shipbuilders won many overseas deals,”
said Hong Seok Chan, an analyst at Daishin Economy Research
Institute in Seoul. “As long as the external risks remain weak,
mainly the Fed tapering concern, demand for the won will have
the upper hand.”  The won advanced 2.3 percent this month to 1,116.60 per
dollar as of 10:02 a.m. in  Seoul , the biggest monthly gain since
June 2012, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The currency
fell 0.3 percent today and weakened 4.7 percent in 2013. The won
may strengthen to 1,090 by the end of this quarter and to 1,078
by year-end, Hong forecast.  Volatility, Bonds  Half of the 54 economists polled by Bloomberg predicted a
reduction of the Fed’s bond-buying program to $65 billion per
month in September from $85 billion. South Korea must focus on
reducing the impact on the country when the U.S. monetary
authority tapers, a central bank board member said at the July
11 policy meeting, according to minutes released yesterday.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves
in the  exchange rate  used to price options, dropped 3.62
percentage points to 7.77 percent in July. It fell 13 basis
points, or 0.13 percentage point, today.  South Korea’s current-account surplus was at $7.24 billion
last month after a record $8.64 billion in May, the  Bank of
Korea  said yesterday.  The yield on the 2.75 percent government bonds due June
2016 rose four basis points this month to 2.92 percent,
according to Korea Exchange Inc. prices. The yield increased one
basis point today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
