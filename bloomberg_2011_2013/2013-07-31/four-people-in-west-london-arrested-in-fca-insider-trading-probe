The U.K. markets regulator arrested
four people in West London and searched two homes as part of an
investigation into insider trading.  The Financial Conduct Authority and London police arrested
three men, ages 29, 51 and 56, and a 25-year-old woman this
morning and are questioning them at a police station, the
regulator said in an e-mailed statement today.  None of the four hold regulated positions in the finance
industry, according to a person familiar with the issue. The
people arrested are a father, his son and daughter, and an
acquaintance.  The regulator has arrested more than a dozen people on
suspicion of insider trading this year, including employees of
Schroders Plc, BlackRock Inc. and Man Group Plc’s GLG Partners
hedge fund division.  Today’s arrests, in the Southall neighborhood, aren’t
linked to any previous investigations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
