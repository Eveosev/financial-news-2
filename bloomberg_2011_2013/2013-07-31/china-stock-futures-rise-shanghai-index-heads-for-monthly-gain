China’s stocks  rose, capping gains
for the benchmark index this month, as real-estate developers,
cement companies and household-appliance makers rallied on
speculation the government may loosen property curbs.  China Vanke Co. (000002)  and Poly Real Estate Group Co. advanced at
least 2.8 percent, driving a gauge of developers to the biggest
gain among industry groups.  Anhui Conch Cement Co. (600585)  climbed 1.5
percent and GD Midea Holding Co., the second-biggest appliance
maker, surged 1.9 percent. Zhejiang Dahua Technology Co. tumbled
6.8 percent, dragging technology companies lower.  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  rose 0.2 percent to 1,993.80
at the close.  China  will stabilize growth and promote the
healthy and stable development of the real-estate market, the
government said yesterday after a Politburo meeting. Investors
had expected the nation’s highest-decision making body to say
the government should maintain property restrictions, said Wei Wei, an analyst at West China Securities Co. in  Shanghai .  “The Politburo didn’t mention any curb measures related to
the  property market  and that sounds like the industry will see
some loosening going forward,” said Wei. “The government may
step up measures to bolster economic growth in the second half
and new policy makers don’t want to see a big slump in economic
growth.”  The Shanghai index gained 0.7 percent in July after
plunging 14 percent last month. The CSI 300 Index rose 0.2
percent to 2,193.02 today, while the  Hang Seng China Enterprises
Index (HSCEI)  lost 0.3 percent. The Bloomberg China-US 55 Index, the
measure of the most-traded U.S.-listed Chinese companies, added
0.7 percent in  New York  yesterday.  Politburo Meeting  For the year, the Shanghai index is down 12 percent on
concern slowing growth will damp earnings. The measure trades at
8.1 times 12-month projected profit, approaching the lowest
level in at least five years,  data  compiled by Bloomberg show.  Authorities will maintain steady second-half  expansion  amid
“extremely complicated domestic and international conditions,”
the official Xinhua News Agency reported yesterday after a
meeting led by President Xi Jinping. China will keep a prudent
monetary policy and a proactive fiscal stance, Xinhua said.  The Shanghai Composite’s property index jumped 2.1 percent.
Vanke, the nation’s biggest listed property developer, rose 2.8
percent to 9.52 yuan. Poly Real Estate, the second largest,
added 3.2 percent to 10.19 yuan.  China Merchants Property
Development Co. (000024)  climbed 4.5 percent to 26.91 yuan.  Property-related companies such as cement producers and
appliance makers also rallied. Anhui Conch, China’s biggest
cement maker, rose 1.5 percent to 14.46 yuan. Midea added 1.9
percent to 13.37 yuan.  “There could be some loosening (or at least no more
tightening) of housing policies in the near term,” Jinsong Du,
head of property research at Credit Suisse Group AG, wrote in an
e-mailed response to questions.  PMI Tomorrow  Former Premier  Wen Jiabao  in March stepped up a three-year
campaign to cool  home prices , ordering the central bank to raise
down-payment requirements for second mortgages in cities with
excessive cost gains and telling local governments with the
biggest price pressures to tighten home-purchase limits.  The statistics bureau is scheduled to release results of
its official manufacturing index for July tomorrow. The reading
is estimated to be 49.8, down from the previous month’s 50.1,
according to the median estimate of 35 economists. A preliminary
reading by HSBC and Markit’s Purchasing Managers Index last week
was 47.7, below the 50 level that divides expansion and
contraction.  China Life Insurance Co., the nation’s biggest insurer,
added 1.6 percent to 13.26  yuan . The company attributed its
estimated first-half 50 percent profit surge to an increase in
investment income. The company posted a 26 percent drop in
profit in the first half of 2012.  Poor Performance  A measure of technology stocks slumped 1.5 percent, the
most among the CSI 300’s 10 indexes. Even after today’s loss, it
has advanced 26 percent this year. Zhejiang Dahua slid 6.8
percent to 37.92 yuan, the most since Jan. 4.  Hangzhou HIK-Vision Digital Technology Co. (002415)  fell 3.3 percent to 19.76 yuan.  Trading volumes in the Shanghai Composite were 27 percent
lower than the 30-day average today while 30-day  volatility  was
at 25.7, near the highest level since December 2010, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Four years after China’s  growth  helped lead the global
economy out of a recession and won the admiration of luminaries
from billionaire  George Soros  to Nobel laureate  Joseph Stiglitz ,
the nation’s stock market has lost more money for investors than
any other in the world.  The Shanghai Composite, which doubled in 10 months through
August 2009 as the government poured $652 billion of stimulus
into building roads, railways and housing, has tumbled 43
percent from its high, destroying $748 billion in market value.
Only Greece’s  ASE Index (ASE)  has fallen more in percentage terms.  “The Beijing consensus as endorsed by some western
observers as an alternative to the market economy is indeed a
sham,” said Hao Hong, the Hong Kong-based head of China
research at Bank of Communications Ltd., whose forecasts for
stock losses have proved prescient. “Now we are all paying for
it.”  --Zhang Shidong. Editors: Allen Wan, Darren Boey  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
