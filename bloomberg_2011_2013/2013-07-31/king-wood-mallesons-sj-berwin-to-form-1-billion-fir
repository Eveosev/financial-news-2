King & Wood Mallesons and SJ Berwin
LLP agreed to merge to form a  law firm  with about $1 billion in
revenue and more than 2,700 lawyers.  From November 1, the combined firm will have more than 550
partners in 30 locations, according to a joint statement today.  The deal adds London-based SJ Berwin to Asia’s largest law
firm, formed last year by the combination of Beijing-based  King
& Wood  and Sydney-based Mallesons Stephen Jaques. It follows the
creation last month of Norton Rose Fulbright, a 3,800-attorney
firm which includes partnerships from London, Houston,
 Australia , Canada and South Africa.  Partners at the  China , Hong Kong, Australia and London
firms all gave widespread support to the merger in votes that
concluded today, King & Wood Mallesons Global Managing Partner
Stuart Fuller said at a media briefing.  SJ Berwin’s senior partner Stephen Kon will become a deputy
chairman of the combined firm. Wang Junfeng, who founded King &
Wood in 1993, remains chairman based in Beijing.  The combination with SJ Berwin will provide clients with an
international platform for inbound and outbound Chinese
investment, King & Wood Mallesons’ Managing Partner China Wang Ling said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
