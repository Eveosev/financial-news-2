The winners of the  U.S. Open  singles
tennis titles will get a record $2.6 million each, an increase
of 37 percent.  The Grand Slam tournament has boosted its total prize money
by more than one-third to $34.3 million as it increased pay for
the wheelchair event and will also “significantly” raise daily
expenses for players, the U.S. Tennis Association said in an e-mailed statement.  Prize money for each round of the singles has been
increased, the USTA said.  A first-round loser in the main draw will receive $32,000,
or 39 percent more. An exit in the second round will be rewarded
with 43 percent more -- or $53,000 -- while $93,000 will be paid
for a third-round departure, also an increase of 43 percent.  The U.S. Open is following the example of Wimbledon, which
boosted prize money for this year’s event by 40 percent to 22.6
million pounds ($34.3 million), including 1.6 million pounds
each for the singles champions.  The U.S. Open, where Britain’s  Andy Murray  and American
 Serena Williams  are defending champions, starts Aug. 26 in  New
York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
