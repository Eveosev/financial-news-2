to the highest level in four months.  Gasoline inventories  on the U.S. West Coast, known as the
PADD 5 region, gained for the third straight week, adding

July 26, the Energy Information Administration, the Energy
Department’s statistical arm, said today. That’s the highest
level since March 15.  California-blend gasoline, or Carbob, supplies jumped 14
percent to 5.62 million barrels last week, the highest level
