Germany , the biggest solar market by
installed capacity, will this year reduce subsidy payments to
power-plant developers to a third of  Japan ’s support level as
installations continue to outpace government targets.  Germany’s feed-in-tariff will shrink 1.8 percent a month
from August through October, the  Bundesnetzagentur  grid
regulator said today in an e-mailed statement. In October, it
will for the first time drop to below 0.1 euros ($0.13) a
kilowatt-hour for plants sized between 1 megawatts and 10
megawatts.  While German first-half solar installations fell 41 percent
over the same period last year, they’re still expected to exceed
the government’s target of between 2.5 gigawatts and 3.5
gigawatts for the entire year, said Jochen Homann, the head of
the regulator.  Germany, which added more than 7 gigawatts of solar panels
in each of the past three years, installed 2.57 gigawatts in the
first half.  Europe ’s biggest economy began offering its
industry-changing feed-in tariff for solar in 2004, building on
previous smaller incentive programs. German consumers finance
the feed-in-tariff via a surcharge on their electricity bills
that jumped 47 percent to a record this year.  Japan, which also seeks to cut solar subsidies to reduce
the cost of its own clean-energy expansion, currently pays solar
developers 37.8 yen ($0.39) a kilowatt-hour.  To contact the reporter on this story:
