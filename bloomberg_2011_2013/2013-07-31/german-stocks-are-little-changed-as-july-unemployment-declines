German stocks were little changed as
companies from Bayer AG to HeidelBergCement AG posted earnings
that beat estimates and as unemployment in July fell, offsetting
an unexpected decline in June retail sales.  Bayer added 3.1 percent as pretax profit in the second
quarter beat estimates. HeidelbergCement advanced 2.8 percent
after earnings beat estimates. ThyssenKrupp AG tumbled 4.2
percent after UBS AG advised investors to sell the shares.
Deutsche Bank AG lost 2.6 percent after Handelsblatt reported
 Germany â€™s largest bank may have to raise legal provisions by 1.4
billion euros ($1.9 billion).  The DAX Index rose less than 0.1 percent to 8,272.86 at
10:30 a.m. in  Frankfurt . The equity benchmark has climbed 3.9
percent this month and 7.5 percent from a low on June 24. The
broader HDAX Index rose 0.1 percent today.  The number of people out of work in July decreased by a
seasonally adjusted 7,000 to 2.93 million, the Nuremberg-based
Federal Labor Agency said today. Economists predicted the
jobless number would remain unchanged, according to the median
of 34 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey. The adjusted jobless
rate stayed at 6.8 percent, near a two-decade low.  German retail sales, adjusted for inflation and seasonal
swings, dropped 1.5 percent in June from May, when they had
risen 0.7 percent, the Federal Statistics Office in Wiesbaden
said. Economists had predicted an increase of 0.2 percent last
month, according to a Bloomberg News survey. Sales fell 2.8
percent from a year earlier.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
