Canadian  stocks  fell for a second
day as shares of potash and gold producers slumped and the U.S.
Federal Reserve refrained from indicating when it will
reduce the pace of stimulus.  Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc.  and Agrium Inc. fell at
least 2.3 percent, extending declines to a second day. Rubicon
Minerals Corp. and Alacer Gold Corp. lost more than 8 percent as
the price of the metal slipped.  CGI Group (GIB/A)  Inc. soared 9.8
percent to a record after topping earnings and revenue
estimates. Intact Financial Corp. climbed 2.8 percent as second-quarter operating earnings beat forecasts.  The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index (SPTSX)  slipped 95.11
points, or 0.8 percent, to 12,486.64 at 4 p.m. in Toronto. The

since September 2012. Trading volume was 16 percent higher than
the 30-day average.  “ Canada ’s economy is expanding very slowly,” said Anish Chopra, a  fund manager  with TD Asset Management Inc. The firm
manages C$216 billion ($210 billion). “Investors are looking
for confirmation things are continuing to grow, albeit slowly,
before they have the confidence to re-enter the market.”  Canadian gross domestic product rose 0.2 percent in May
after a 0.1 percent gain in April. Economists had forecast a 0.3
percent increase. The  U.S. economy  grew at a 1.7 percent
annualized rate in the second quarter, ahead of the median
forecast for a 1 percent advance according to a Bloomberg survey
of economists.  Fed Guidance  The U.S. Fed repeated the pledge it has used since
September that it will continue its bond purchases until the
U.S. labor market outlook has improved substantially. Policy
makers also left unchanged their commitment to hold the target
interest rate near zero as long as the jobless rate remains
above 6.5 percent and the outlook for inflation over one to two
years doesn’t exceed 2.5 percent.  Raw-material producers fell the most in the S&P/TSX, losing
2.5 percent as a group. Eight of 10  industries  in the Canadian
equity benchmark declined. Technology stocks climbed 5.2 percent
as a group for the biggest increase in three months.  Potash Corp. slumped 8.5 percent to C$29.88, a three-year
low, and Agrium lost 2.3 percent to C$87.14. Potash Corp. has
plunged 23 percent in the past two days.  OAO Uralkali (URKA) , the biggest supplier of the fertilizer potash
in the world, said yesterday that it would end production

former  Soviet Union .  Shares in gold miners declined as the price of the precious
metal fell as much as 1.5 percent. Rubicon Minerals lost 8.1
percent to C$1.36 and Alacer Gold dropped 8 percent to C$2.43.  CGI Jumps  CGI Group, an information and business services provider,

contracts, extensions and renewals in the quarter, bringing
total bookings in the past year to C$9.3 billion. The company’s
