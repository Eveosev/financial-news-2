Mitsubishi Estate Co. (8802) ,  Japan ’s
biggest developer by market value, said first-quarter profit
gained 44 percent after the profitability of its residential
business improved.  Net income rose to 17.1 billion yen ($174 million) in the
three months ended June 30 from 11.9 billion yen a year earlier,
the company said in a statement to the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
Revenue gained 16 percent to 227.8 billion yen.  The results bring Mitsubishi Estate a step closer to
achieving an increase in full-year profit for the first time in
three years. The inventory of apartments fell to 56 units in
June, the lowest level since at least 1998, the company said.  The operating profit margin for Mitsubishi Estate’s
residential division rose to 3.6 percent in the first quarter
from 0.5 percent a year earlier, it said in the statement. The
company expects the profit margin to double to 6.9 percent by
March 2014, it said.  Operating profit from the residential business gained to
2.2 billion yen from 297 million yen in the first fiscal
quarter, the company said. Operating profit from the office
business fell 6.4 percent to 26.7 billion yen after Mitsubishi
Estate closed some office buildings.  Shares of Mitsubishi Estate fell 1.8 percent to 2,516 yen
as of 1:24 p.m. in  Tokyo , trimming the year-to-date gain to 23
percent. The Topix Real Estate Index has climbed 38 percent this
year.  The Tokyo-based developer kept its profit forecast at 58
billion yen for the year ending March 31, on sales of 1.07
trillion yen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
