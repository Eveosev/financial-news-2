A lawsuit brought in the U.S. by
Petroleos Mexicanos, alleging bribery of its officials by
 Siemens AG (SIE)  and SK Engineering & Construction Co., was dismissed
because the case had no domestic links.  U.S. District Judge Louis Stanton in  Manhattan  yesterday
threw out the complaint by Mexico’s state-owned oil company
against the German and South Korean companies, which had been
partners on a refinery modernization project.  “The RICO claims here are extra-territorial: they allege a
foreign conspiracy against a foreign victim conducted by foreign
defendants participating in foreign enterprises,” Stanton said
in his decision.  Pemex, in a complaint filed in December, said Siemens and
SK bribed Pemex officials while bidding on the project in
Mexico’s Cadereyta region. After the venture won the contract in
1997, the project was plagued by cost overruns and construction
disputes, leading the defendants paid more bribes to keep the
contract, Pemex claimed.  The case is  Petroleos Mexicanos  v. Conproca SA de CV, 12-cv-9070, U.S. District Court, Southern District of  New York 
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
