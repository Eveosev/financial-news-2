SodaStream International Ltd. (SODA) , the
Israeli maker of home soda machines, surged the most in 11 weeks
after boosting its revenue outlook for 2013 and reporting
second-quarter earnings that beat analysts’ estimates.  Shares of the Airport City, Israel-based company jumped 15
percent to $67.10 at 10:08 a.m. in  New York . The advance pared
the stock’s retreat in July to 8 percent, the biggest slump
since October.  SodaStream projects 2013 sales to increase about 30 percent
to $567.2 million, up from a previous forecast of 27 percent.
Sales for the second quarter rose 29 percent to $132.4 million
and net income grew 36 percent to $12.9 million.  “Today’s guidance increase is, in our view, a clear signal
that the business is healthy, that expectations for the holiday
season are positive and that the long term story is on track,”
 David Kaplan , an analyst at Barclays Plc in  Tel Aviv  who rates
the stock the equivalent of buy, wrote in an e-mailed report.  The company fell to a six-week low in New York on July 9 as
the New York Post reported that SodaStream is struggling to
attract buyout interest after looking to sell itself for at
least three months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
