Jive Software Inc. (JIVE)  fell the most
since going public in December 2011 after the maker of social-networking products reported a wider loss, cut its full-year
forecast and Robert W. Baird & Co. downgraded the stock.  Jive plummeted 21 percent to $13.42 at the close in  New
York , its lowest price since Dec. 17.  Steven Ashley , an analyst
at Baird, downgraded the stock today to neutral from outperform.
He set a 12-month target price of $16.  The company lowered its revenue and profit forecast for
2013 and reported a wider second-quarter loss, according to a
statement yesterday. The  Palo Alto , California-based software
maker has struggled to sell to mainstream buyers and shorten
sales cycles, Jive Chief Executive Officer Tony Zingale said.  “When they reported their Q2 earnings, they mentioned that
the sales cycles are longer than planned, and this is reducing
their sales force productivity,” Tim Klasell, a Minneapolis-based analyst at Northland Securities Inc. said today in a
telephone interview. “People are a little bit disappointed that
they are having more challenges than was anticipated. The stock
clearly was not pricing in those challenges.”  Jive cut its 2013 revenue forecast to as much as $146
million from its previous estimate of as much as $153 million.
It said its full-year adjusted loss would be 59 cents to 62
cents a share, compared with a previous range of 55 cents to 62
cents. The company posted a second-quarter adjusted loss of 14
cents a share, compared with 11 cents a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
