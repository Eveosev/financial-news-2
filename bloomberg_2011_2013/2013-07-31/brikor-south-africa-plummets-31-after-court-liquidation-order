Brikor Ltd. (BIK) , a South African
brickmaker, dropped 31 percent before trading in its shares was
suspended after the High Court in KwaZulu-Natal province ordered
its provisional liquidation.  Brikor’s request to halt trading in its stock was approved
by the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, according to a statement
today. It fell to 9 rand with volume at 4.5 times the three-month daily average before the statement, issued at about 1:30
p.m. local time.  FirstRand Ltd. (FSR)  filed an application for the liquidation of
Brikor’s assets on July 12, which was heard yesterday, according
to an earlier stock exchange statement today. In 2011, Brikor
started a restructuring plan at FirstRand’s instruction, with
assets being sold last year. Brikor and FirstRand are scheduled
to return to the KwaZulu-Natal  High court  on Oct. 8.  To contact the reporter on this story:
