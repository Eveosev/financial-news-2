Christian Benitez died of heart
failure a day after a match earlier this week, according to his
Qatari soccer club.  The 27-year-old  Ecuador  national team player was taken to
al-Ahli Hospital in Doha after making his debut for Eljaish. The
club released the cause of death today on its website, without
giving more details.  “The official medical reports were issued by official
state entities and stated that the sudden death was caused by
heart failure,” the team said in the statement. “Eljaish Club
management assures that it will transfer the body of the late
player to Ecuador immediately after finishing all legal
procedures which are applied in the state of Qatar.”  The striker joined Eljaish on a three-year contract from
 Mexico ’s Club America this month. He was rushed to the hospital
where he suffered cardiac arrest shortly after complaining about
stomach pains, according to an earlier statement on the
Ecuador soccer federation’s website.  Benitez, known as Chucho, reported no ill effects after
playing in Eljaish’s 2-0 victory over Qatar Sports Club in the
Sheikh Jassem Cup on July 29, the team said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
