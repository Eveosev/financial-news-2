Suncorp Group Ltd. (SUN) , an Australian
lender and insurer, said profit fell as much as 34 percent in
the year ended June, more than analyst estimates after losses on
its non-core loans portfolio.  The company estimates a  full-year profit  of A$480 million
($432 million) to A$500 million, compared with A$724 million a
year earlier, according to a statement today. That is lower than
the A$586 million mean  forecast  of 10 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg.  Chief Executive Officer Patrick Snowball has focused on
exiting commercial property, corporate loans, and leases that
were worth A$18 billion in 2009 to reduce risk and steer Suncorp
toward insurance and personal and small business lending. The
unit that housed the sour loan portfolio is expected to post a
full-year loss of A$630 million, it said in the statement.  The board intends to declare a special  dividend  of 20 cents
a share, in addition to a 30 cent payout, bringing the total for
the year to 75 cents, it said in a stock exchange filing.  The Brisbane-based company received A$940 million from
 Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  for the sale of a portfolio that
includes mostly bad loans, which it sold at 60 cents for every
dollar. Suncorp said June 13, the non-core portfolio had shrunk
to A$2.8 billion as at May 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
