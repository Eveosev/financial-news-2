Indonesia ’s rupiah is set for the
worst monthly performance since February 2009 after the central
bank allowed the currency to weaken to reflect the nation’s
current-account shortfall. Government bonds fell.  The rupiah is moving toward a new equilibrium and is in
line with economic fundamentals, Bank Indonesia said on July 23,
when the currency slid by the most in a year. The current-account gap may be about $8 billion in the second quarter and $6
billion in the third, compared with $5.3 billion in the first
three months of this year, Deputy Governor Perry Warjiyo said
yesterday. The monetary authority has allowed the rupiah to
gradually depreciate this month, he said on July 12.  “The rupiah’s weakness is in line with broad dollar
strength and an external balance that’s still weak,” said Mika Martumpal, head of treasury research and strategy at PT Bank
CIMB Niaga in Jakarta. “Bank Indonesia remains in the market
but its mission now is more to reduce volatility when needed.”  The rupiah fell 3.4 percent this month to 10,273 per dollar
as of 9:00 a.m. in Jakarta, prices from local banks show. It
reached a four-year low of 10,293 yesterday and was unchanged
today. The spot rate traded at a 1.9 percent premium to the one-month non-deliverable forwards, which declined 3 percent in July
and 0.1 percent today to 10,468.  A  fixing  by the Association of Banks in  Singapore  used to
settle rupiah forwards was set at 10,301 yesterday, compared
with 9,981 on June 30. One-month implied volatility, a measure
of expected moves in the exchange rate used to price options,
fell 1.49 percentage points in July and rose 12 basis points
today to 12.67 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The yield on the 5.625 percent bonds due May 2023 climbed
97 basis points, or 0.97 percentage point, this month to 8.10
percent, prices from the Inter Dealer Market Association show.
The yield reached 8.30 percent on July 16, the highest level
since March 2011. It was little changed today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
