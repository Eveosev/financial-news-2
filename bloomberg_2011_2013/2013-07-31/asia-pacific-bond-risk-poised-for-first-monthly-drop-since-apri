The cost of insuring corporate and
sovereign bonds in the Asia-Pacific region against non-payment
is poised for its first monthly decline since April, according
to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  was unchanged today at 142 basis points
as of 8:18 a.m. in  Hong Kong , Westpac Banking Corp. prices show.
The gauge is set for a 10.4 basis-point fall in July, the first
improvement in risk perception in three months, according to
data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index was also little changed at
100.5 basis points at 9:15 a.m. in  Tokyo , according to Citigroup
Inc. prices. The benchmark is set to decline 9.3 basis points in
July after rising by 26.3 over the previous two months,
according to CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and
compiles prices quoted by dealers in the private market.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index dropped 1 basis point to
122 as of 10:31 a.m. in Sydney, according to National Australia
Bank Ltd. prices. The gauge has fallen from 137.1 basis points
at the end of June, also snapping two months of gains, CMA
prices show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
