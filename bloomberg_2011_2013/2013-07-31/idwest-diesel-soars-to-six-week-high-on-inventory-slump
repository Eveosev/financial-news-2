U.S. Midwest diesel fuel
strengthened to a six-week high relative to futures after a
government report showed  area inventories  slumped.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel fuel  in Group 3, the area from
Tulsa,  Oklahoma , north to  Minnesota  and  North Dakota , gained
0.38 cent to a premium of 1.63 cents versus New York Mercantile
Exchange futures at 2:36 p.m., the  strongest level since  June
18, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The same fuel in
 Chicago  weakened 0.5 cent to a discount of 3 cents a gallon.  Stockpiles of the fuel in the Midwest, known as PADD 2,
retreated  177,000 barrels  to 28.7 million barrels in the week
ended July 26, a second consecutive decline, according to U.S.
Energy Information Administration data. Regional inventories of
gasoline  slipped 838,000 barrels  to 48.3 million.  The  3-2-1 crack spread  in Group 3, a rough measure of
refining margins for gasoline and diesel based on West Texas
Intermediate oil in Cushing, Oklahoma, widened 29 cents to
$21.90 a barrel. The  same spread  in Chicago dropped 35 cents to
$18.43 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
