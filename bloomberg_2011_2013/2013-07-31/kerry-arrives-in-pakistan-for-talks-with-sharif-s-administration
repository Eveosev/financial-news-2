U.S. Secretary of State  John Kerry 
arrived in Islamabad today in the first visit by a top American
official since  Nawaz Sharif  was elected Pakistan’s prime
minister in May.  Kerry will emphasize cooperation on economic development,
fighting terrorism, regional stability and nuclear security,
U.S. officials, who asked not to be identified in advance of the
talks, told reporters traveling with him. The visit was kept
secret until his arrival because of the daily threat of
terrorist attacks in Pakistan.  The top U.S. diplomat is scheduled to hold more than 12
hours of meetings tomorrow with Sharif and top civilian and
military leaders. Kerry also will make a stop in London for
meetings en route back to  Washington , according to State
Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki.  To contact the reporter on this story:
