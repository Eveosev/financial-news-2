SAS Group (SAS)  bonds gained in Stockholm
trading after the company raised fresh cash through a sale and
leaseback agreement on its airplanes and a private placement.  The yield on SAS’s convertible Swedish krona bond maturing
on April 1, 2015, fell 40 basis points to 19.46 percent, its
lowest level since July 2, according to prices by Nordea Bank AB
compiled by Bloomberg. The yield on its 10.5 percent 2014 note
slid 33 basis points to 6.79 percent.  SAS said today that it has raised 35 million euros ($46.5
million) in a private placement to support its longer-term
liquidity level and to pay off maturing debt. In a separate
statement, the Stockholm-based company said it also completed
the sale and leaseback of six planes to ELFC and Deucalion
Capital X Limited.  “My view would be that bond investors see it as positive
that SAS is raising additional financing and improving the
company’s financial flexibility,” Louis Landeman, an analyst at
Danske Bank A/S, said in an e-mailed response to questions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
