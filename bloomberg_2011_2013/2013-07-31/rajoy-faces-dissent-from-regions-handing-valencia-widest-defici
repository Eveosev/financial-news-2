Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy  is
facing pushback from some regional leaders as he tries to rein
in Spain’s  budget deficit .  Budget Minister Cristobal Montoro won only “majority”
support at a meeting of regional government presidents in Madrid
yesterday where he agreed that Valencia would be allowed the
widest budget deficit this year, the minister said in an e-mailed press release late yesterday.  “This is a proposal of individual stability targets for
each region which is balanced, sensible, realistic, adapted to
the circumstances and positive for each region and for Spain as
a whole,” Montoro said in the note.  The Madrid region, which is governed by Rajoy’s  People’s
Party , voted against the plan,  El Pais  newspaper reported,
citing comments by the  Madrid  budget chief Enrique Ossorio.
Madrid was joined in opposing Montoro by Catalonia, which is
chafing at the strictures imposed by the national government as
regional President Artur Mas pushes for independence, El Pais
said.  Valencia was set a deficit limit of 1.6 percent of gross
domestic product while Catalonia was allowed a shortfall of 1.58
percent compared with 1.07 percent for the Madrid region and 1
percent for Extremadura, the ministry said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
