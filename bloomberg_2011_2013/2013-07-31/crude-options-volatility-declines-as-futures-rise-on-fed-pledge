Crude options volatility fell after
futures jumped 1.9 percent as the  Federal Reserve  kept the pace
of its bond-buying intact to boost the economy.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
September, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a
gauge of options value, was 21.57 percent on the  New York 
Mercantile Exchange at 3:40 p.m., down from 22.12 yesterday.  The Fed pledged to keep buying $85 billion in bonds every
month and said persistently low inflation could hamper the
economic expansion. Investors had been awaiting signals that the
Fed might taper its efforts.  “We might be further away from tapering and that is
especially bullish for oil,” said  Phil Flynn , senior market
analyst at Price Futures Group in  Chicago .  West Texas Intermediate crude for September delivery rose
$1.95 to settle at $105.03 a barrel on the Nymex.  The most active options in electronic trading today were
September $94 puts, which fell 9 cents to 5 cents a barrel on
volume of 4,081 lots traded as of 3:41 p.m. December $75 puts
were the second-most active, dropping 4 cents to 19 cents on
volume of 4,017 contracts.  Puts accounted for 64 percent of electronic trading volume.
In the prior session, bearish bets made up 51 percent of 128,393
contracts exchanged.  September $95 puts were the most-active options yesterday
with 11,257 contracts changing hands as they increased 7 cents
to 18 cents a barrel. September $105 calls fell 62 cents to
$1.05 on 5,737 lots.  Open interest was highest for December $80 puts, with
38,482 contracts. Next were December $90 puts with 37,373 lots
and December $110 calls with 34,041.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on open-outcry volume, where the bulk of options activity occurs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
