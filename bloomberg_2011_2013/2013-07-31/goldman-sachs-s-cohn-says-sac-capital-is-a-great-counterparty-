Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  President
 Gary Cohn  said his firm continues to do business with SAC
Capital Advisors LP, the hedge fund that was indicted on charges
of insider trading last week.  “They’re an important client to us, they have been an
important client to us,” Cohn, 52, said today in an interview
on CNBC. “We continue to trade with them, and they’re a great
counterparty.”  Goldman Sachs, which gets more than half its revenue from
trading, is the first Wall Street firm to comment publicly on
its dealings with the $14 billion hedge fund company founded by
Steven A. Cohen. Bank of America Corp., JPMorgan Chase & Co. and
 Morgan Stanley (MS)  were among firms that were continuing to trade
with SAC Capital after the indictment, four people briefed on
the matter said last week.  SAC Capital denied it encouraged or tolerated  insider
trading  and said it will continue to operate as it works through
the allegations. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
filed an administrative complaint against Cohen, seeking to ban
him from overseeing investor funds for allegedly failing to
supervise employees and prevent them from engaging in insider
trading.  The hedge fund has been among the largest trading clients
for New York-based Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, according
to people with knowledge of the relationships. SAC Capital,
based in Stamford, Connecticut, has used those firms, along with
JPMorgan, Credit Suisse Group AG and Barclays Plc, as prime
brokers, Reuters reported in 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
