Maple Leaf Foods Inc. (MFI) , the Canadian
producer of foods from hamburgers to frozen pasta, fell the most
in more than two years after second-quarter earnings missed
analysts’ estimates due to global pork and raw material
volatility.  Maple Leaf declined 7.4 percent to C$14.35 at the close in
Toronto, the biggest drop since November 2010. The shares have
jumped 20 percent this year, compared with a 0.4 percent gain in
the Standard and Poor’s/TSX Composite Index.  The Toronto-based company posted per-share profit,
excluding one-time items, of 2 cents, trailing the 15-cent
 average  of 15 estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Sales declined
3.7 percent to C$1.21 billion ($1.18 billion).  “Hog production returns, global pork markets and volatile
raw-material markets all contributed to a material year-over-year earnings decline,” Michael H. McCain, chief executive
officer of Maple Leaf, said in a statement.  Maple Leaf is in the midst of a five-year overhaul, which
began in 2010, that includes closing eight plants and cutting
1,550 jobs by 2014.  To contact the reporter on this story:
