Sumitomo Electric Industries Ltd. (5802) , a
Japanese maker of electric wire, cables and electric monitoring
systems, will supply a large-size storage battery system to
stabilize the flow of wind and solar power on the northern
island of Hokkaido.  The battery system will be set up at  Hokkaido Electric
Power Co. (9509) ’s Minami Hayakita substation in the town of Abira and
will have 60-megawatt hours of storage capacity, Sumitomo and
the utility said in a statement today.  Japan introduced an incentive program for clean energy a
year ago to diversify its energy mix. The newly added renewable
capacity has been mostly solar.  The battery system is among the three plans the Ministry of
Economy, Trade and Industry announced in April because the
island has been flooded with applications for large-size solar
projects as developers sought inexpensive and flat land.  The system, using vanadium redox flow battery technology,
will be installed by March 2015 for the three-year pilot
project, according to the statement.  By the end of March, solar applications for grid
connections on  Japan ’s northernmost island totaled 1,568
megawatts for plants of 2 megawatts or larger, according to an
April 17 statement from Hokkaido Electric, which said it has
capacity for only 400 megawatts for solar.  The battery system will increase the utility’s capacity for
wind and solar by about 40 megawatts, according to the ministry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
