Recession in Europe and social
unrest in the  Middle East  are slowing Turkish export growth,
Turkish Economy Minister Zafer Caglayan said in an e-mailed
statement following the release of June export data.  Turkey ’s exports last month fell 6 percent from a year
earlier to $12.4 billion while imports rose 2.8 percent to $21
billion, the state statistics agency in Ankara said today. The
trade deficit stood at $8.57 billion, beating a median estimate
of $10 billion in a Bloomberg survey of 11 economists. Exports
during the first half of the year grew by 1.4 percent to $75.2
billion compared with the same period last year.  “Export growth is down more because of slower growth in
our export markets than because of export performance,”
Caglayan said. “We managed to increase our exports despite the
crisis in  Europe  and the Arab Spring.”  The European Union remains Turkey’s top market, accounting
for 42 percent of Turkey’s exports last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
