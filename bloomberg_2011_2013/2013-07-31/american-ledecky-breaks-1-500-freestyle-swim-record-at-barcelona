Katie Ledecky of the U.S. swam the
fastest ever 1,500-meter freestyle to win the event at the world
championships in  Barcelona .  Ledecky, 16, of Bethesda,  Maryland , was one of three gold
medalists for the U.S. last night. Missy Franklin, 18, and Matt
Grevers, 28, won the 100-meter backstroke finals.  Ledecky’s time of 15 minutes, 36.53 seconds broke the
previous record by more than six seconds as she outdueled
defending world champion Lotte Friis of Denmark, whose second-place time also beat the mark of 15:42.54 set by Kate Ziegler on
June 17, 2007.  Ledecky already had a gold in the 400-meter freestyle,
while Franklin added to her 400-meter freestyle relay gold.  Yannick Agnel of  France  won his second gold medal, in the
men’s 200-meter freestyle, to accompany a 400-meter freestyle
