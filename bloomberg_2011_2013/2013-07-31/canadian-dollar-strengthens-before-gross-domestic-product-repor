The Canadian dollar rose before a
government report forecast to show the nation’s economy expanded
for a fifth consecutive month.  Canada’s gross domestic product rose 0.3 percent in May,
compared with 0.1 percent increase the month before, according
to a Bloomberg survey with 20 responses. The Canadian economy
has been resilient, with recent data for May showing the biggest
monthly employment gain in a decade and the fastest growth in
 retail sales  in three years.  “It probably will be modestly supportive for the Canadian
dollar,” said  Shaun Osborne , chief currency strategist at
Toronto-Dominion Bank, by phone from Toronto before the report.
“Better data is generally good for a currency, but not material
enough to push us out of the range.”  The loonie, as the currency is nicknamed for the image of
the waterfowl on the C$1 coin, rose 0.1 percent to C$1.0293 per
 U.S. dollar  at 8:04 a.m. in Toronto. One loonie buys 97.15 U.S.
cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
