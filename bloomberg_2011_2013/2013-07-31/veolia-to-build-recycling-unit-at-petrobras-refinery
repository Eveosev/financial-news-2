Veolia Environnement SA (VIE) , Europe’s
biggest water company, has agreed to build a recycling unit at
Petroleo Brasileiro SA’s sixth-largest refinery.  The Alberto Pasqualini REFAP facility in southern  Brazil ,
with a daily capacity of 200,000 barrels, will use the
technology to recycle oil-bearing material back into the
refinery’s coker unit, Veolia said in a statement today. Terms
of the deal weren’t disclosed.  The recycling unit is expected to be operational in
November and using it will save Petrobras about $1.5 million
annually, Veolia said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
