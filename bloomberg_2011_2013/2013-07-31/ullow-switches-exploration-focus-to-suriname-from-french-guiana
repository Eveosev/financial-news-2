Tullow Oil Plc (TLW)  plans to switch its
exploration focus to  Suriname  from French Guiana after drilling
three unsuccessful wells in the overseas region of  France .  “There won’t be any more wells in the near term after GM-ES-5” which will be located on the Cingulata prospect near the
Zaedyus-1 discovery, said Tullow Exploration Director Angus McCoss. “With that data in hand and the rig departing we are
trying to rethink, regroup, reassemble the prospect inventory.”  Tullow opened a new oil frontier off the northeast coast of
 South America  with its Zaedyus well in 2011. Together with  Royal
Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  and  Total SA (FP) , the London-based company was
targeting about 1.4 billion barrels of oil resources in French
Guiana with its drilling campaign. Tullow will shift focus to
neighboring Suriname, where it’s a partner with  Statoil ASA (STL)  in
 Block 47 , after joining  Inpex Corp. (1605)  in Block 31.  “The venture hasn’t been successful in locating the wells
since the Zaedyus first well,” McCoss said in a phone
interview. “In the mid-term the focus of activity will
certainly” be Suriname “but we are not giving up on French
Guiana. The prospectivity there is too rich, too strong, so we
will be back.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
