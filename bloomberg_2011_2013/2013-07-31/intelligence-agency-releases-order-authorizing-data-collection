The Office of the Director of
National Intelligence declassified and released three documents
detailing the court authorization and congressional briefings
related to a program that collects the phone records of millions
of U.S. citizens.  The documents include a 17-page court order from April 25
that provides the guidelines for the use of a bulk collection
program authorized under the Patriot Act. The declassification
and release of the information comes after disclosures by former
U.S. intelligence contractor Edward Snowden.  To contact the reporter on this story:
