European stocks  were little changed,
with the Stoxx Europe 600 Index completing its biggest monthly
gain since October 2011, as a report showed the U.S. economy
expanded at a faster-than-expected pace.  Anheuser-Busch InBev NV jumped 6.9 percent after the maker
of Stella Artois lager posted earnings that beat estimates.
Invensys Plc added 1.1 percent after Schneider Electric SA
agreed to buy the company for 3.4 billion pounds ($5.2 billion).  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index added 0.1 percent to 299.58 at
the close of trading London, after earlier climbing as much as
0.4 percent and dropping as much as 0.5 percent. The gauge
rallied 5.1 percent in July as Federal Reserve President Ben S.
Bernanke said the central bank remains flexible on the pace of
its bond-buying program. The Fed will reveal the outcome of a
two-day policy meeting after European markets close today.  “The U.S. is the engine of global recovery, so the
question is how sustainable the economic improvement can be,”
said Lorenzo Carcano, senior portfolio manager at B Metzler Seel
Sohn & Co KGaA in  Frankfurt . “It’s important to look forward
and listen to any guidance from Bernanke on the development of
the economy, and it’s very key that he manages market
expectations. I expect his wording to be cautious, but at some
point the Fed will have to reduce stimulus.”  Fed Meeting  Bernanke has said that low inflation and high unemployment
mean the central bank needs to continue buying bonds. The Fed
will leave the benchmark  interest rate  at 0.25 percent when it
announces its decision, according to every economist in a
Bloomberg survey. The central bank may begin to reduce its bond-purchase program in September, economists predicted in a
separate survey.  The U.S. economy, the world’s largest, grew at a 1.7
percent annual rate in the second quarter, after expanding at a

according to a report from the Commerce Department. Economists
had predicted a 1 percent expansion for the period, according to
the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey.  A separate release showed that companies in the U.S. hired
a net 200,000 workers in July, the highest reading this year.

advance since May 2010. Second-quarter organic normalized

growth of 3.7 percent for the period.  Diageo Plc, which brews Guinness beer, Johnnie Walker
whisky and Smirnoff vodka, rose 3.2 percent to 2,054 pence. The
world’s biggest distiller posted operating profit excluding some
items of 3.53 billion pounds, compared with a 3.48 billion-pound
median estimate.  SABMiller Plc added 2.6 percent to 3,220.5 pence, as a

its biggest gain in almost four weeks.  Invensys advanced 1.1 percent to 496.3 pence after

company’s revised guidance.  The number of shares trading hands in Stoxx 600-listed
companies was 12 percent lower than the average of the past 30
