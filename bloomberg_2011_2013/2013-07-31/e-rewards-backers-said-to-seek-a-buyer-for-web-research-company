E-Rewards Inc.’s private-equity backers are seeking a sale of the online market research company, people with knowledge of the matter said.  The closely held company, which conducts surveys over the Web, may fetch at least $600 million, said one of the people, who asked not to be named because the process is private. The company is working with Morgan Stanley to find a buyer, said the people.  E-Rewards, whose backers include private-equity firms TA Associates Inc. and Sutter Hill Ventures as well as venture-capital firm Polaris Partners, has received interest from at least one buyout firm, said one of the people, without providing details.  Akhilesh Raina, a spokesman at Morgan Stanley, declined to comment. Representatives for TA Associates, Sutter Hill, Polaris and Plano, Texas-based E-Rewards didn’t respond to e-mails and phone calls seeking comment.  TA Associates paid $60 million for a minority stake in the company in 2008, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Since that investment, E-Rewards, founded in 1999, has made acquisitions including London-based market-research provider Research Now Ltd. and San Francisco-based Peanut Labs Inc.  E-Rewards has about 1,200 employees, according to its website. The company reported about $300 million in revenue last year, according to one of the people familiar with the situation.
