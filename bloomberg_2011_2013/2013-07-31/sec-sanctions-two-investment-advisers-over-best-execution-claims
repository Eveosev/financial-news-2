The U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission sanctioned two investment advisory firms for failing
to seek best execution on client trades placed with their in-house broker units.  A.R. Schmeidler & Co., based in  New York , agreed to pay
more than $1 million to settle claims that it failed to re-evaluate whether it was providing advisory clients best
execution, the SEC said today in a statement.  In the same statement, the SEC said Indianapolis-based
Goezler Investment Management and its owner agreed to pay
$500,000 to resolve the agencyâ€™s claims that it misled investors
about the process of selecting itself as the broker for advisory
clients, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
