Following is the text of the Gross
Domestic Product report from the Commerce Department.  NATIONAL INCOME AND PRODUCT ACCOUNTS
 GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT:  SECOND QUARTER 2013 (ADVANCE ESTIMATE)  COMPREHENSIVE REVISION: 1929 THROUGH FIRST QUARTER 2013  Real gross domestic product -- the output of goods and
services produced by labor and property located in the  United
States  -- increased at an annual rate of 1.7 percent in the
second quarter of 2013 (that is, from the first quarter to the
second quarter), according to the “advance” estimate released by
the  Bureau of Economic Analysis .  In the first quarter, real GDP
increased 1.1 percent (revised).  The Bureau emphasized that the second-quarter advance
estimate released today is based on source data that are
incomplete or subject to further revision by the source agency.
The “second” estimate for the second quarter, based on more
complete data, will be released on August 29, 2013.  The increase in real GDP in the second quarter primarily
reflected positive contributions from personal consumption
expenditures (PCE), exports, nonresidential fixed investment,
private inventory investment, and residential investment that
were partly offset by a negative contribution from federal
government spending. Imports, which are a subtraction in the
calculation of GDP, increased.  The acceleration in real GDP in the second quarter
primarily reflected upturns in nonresidential fixed investment
and in exports, a smaller decrease in federal  government
spending , and an upturn in state and local government spending
that were partly offset by an acceleration in imports and
decelerations in private inventory investment and in PCE.  Comprehensive Revision of the National Income and Product
Accounts  The estimates released today reflect the results of the
14th comprehensive (or benchmark) revision of the national
income and product accounts (NIPAs) in conjunction with the
second quarter 2013 “advance” estimate  Quarterly estimates are expressed at seasonally adjusted
annual rates, unless otherwise specified. Quarter-to-quarter
dollar changes are differences between these published estimates.
Percent changes are calculated from unrounded data and are
annualized.  “Real” estimates are in chained (2009) dollars.
Price indexes are chain-type measures.  The price index for gross domestic purchases, which
measures prices paid by U.S. residents, increased 0.3 percent in
the second quarter, compared with an increase of 1.2 percent in
the first. Excluding food and energy prices, the price index for
gross domestic purchases increased 0.8 percent in the second
quarter compared with 1.4 percent in the first.  Real personal consumption expenditures increased 1.8
percent in the second quarter, compared with an increase of 2.3
percent in the first.  Durable goods increased 6.5 percent,
compared with an increase of 5.8 percent.  Nondurable goods
increased 2.0 percent, compared with an increase of 2.7 percent.
Services increased 0.9 percent, compared with an increase of 1.5
percent.  Real nonresidential fixed investment increased 4.6 percent
in the second quarter, in contrast to a decrease of 4.6 percent
in the first.  Nonresidential structures increased 6.8 percent,
in contrast to a decrease of 25.7 percent.  Equipment increased
4.1 percent, compared with an increase of 1.6 percent.
Intellectual property products increased 3.8 percent, compared
with an increase of 3.7 percent.  Real residential fixed
investment increased 13.4 percent, compared with an increase of
12.5 percent.  Real exports of goods and services increased 5.4 percent
in the second quarter, in contrast to a decrease of 1.3 percent
in the first.  Real imports of goods and services increased 9.5
percent, compared with an increase of 0.6 percent.  Real federal government consumption expenditures and gross
investment decreased 1.5 percent in the second quarter, compared
with a decrease of 8.4 percent in the first.  National defense
decreased 0.5 percent, compared with a decrease of 11.2 percent.
Nondefense decreased 3.2 percent, compared with a decrease of
3.6 percent.  Real state and local government consumption
expenditures and gross investment increased 0.3 percent, in
contrast to a decrease of 1.3 percent.  The change in real private inventories added 0.41
percentage point to the second-quarter change in real GDP after
adding 0.93 percentage point to the first-quarter change.
Private businesses increased inventories $56.7 billion in the
second quarter, following increases of $42.2 billion in the
first quarter and $7.3 billion in the fourth.  Real final sales of domestic product -- GDP less change in
private inventories -- increased 1.3 percent in the second
quarter, compared with an increase of 0.2 percent in the first.  Gross domestic purchases  Real gross domestic purchases -- purchases by U.S.
residents of goods and services wherever produced -- increased
2.4 percent in the second quarter, compared with an increase of
1.4 percent in the first.  Disposition of personal income  Current-dollar personal income increased $140.1 billion
(4.1 percent) in the second quarter, in contrast to a decrease
of $157.1 billion (4.4 percent) in the first.  The upturn in
personal income primarily reflected sharp upturns in personal
dividend income and in wages and salaries and a sharp
deceleration in contributions for government social insurance (a
subtraction in the calculation of personal income).  *    Personal dividend income increased in the second quarter,
in contrast to a large decrease in the first. The first-quarter
decline in dividend income primarily reflected the accelerated
and special
dividends that were paid by many companies in the fourth quarter
of 2012.  *    Wages and salaries increased in the second quarter, in
contrast to a decrease in the first. The first-quarter decline
in wages and salaries is based on preliminary quarterly census
of employment and wages data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.  *    The sharp deceleration in contributions for government
social insurance primarily reflected the first-quarter
expiration of the “payroll tax holiday” that increased the
social security contribution
rate for employees and self-employed workers by 2.0 percentage
points.  Personal current taxes increased $36.0 billion in the
second quarter, compared with an increase of $74.3 billion in
the first.  Disposable personal income increased $104.1 billion (3.4
percent) in the second quarter, in contrast to a decrease of
$231.5 billion (7.2 percent) in the first.  Real disposable
personal income increased 3.4 percent, in contrast to a decrease
of 8.2 percent.  Personal outlays increased $44.7 billion (1.5 percent) in
the second quarter, compared with an increase of $98.7 billion
(3.4 percent) in the first.  Personal saving -- disposable
personal income less personal outlays -- was $553.4 billion in
the second quarter, compared with $494.0 billion in the first.  The personal saving rate -- personal saving as a
percentage of disposable personal income -- was 4.5 percent in
the second quarter, compared with 4.0 percent in the first.  For
a comparison of personal saving in BEA’s national income and
product accounts with personal saving in the Federal Reserve
Board’s flow of funds accounts and data on changes in net worth,
go to www.bea.gov/national/nipaweb/Nipa-Frb.asp  Current-dollar GDP  Current-dollar GDP -- the market value of the nation’s
output of goods and services -- increased 2.4 percent, or $98.1
billion, in the second quarter to a level of $16,633.4 billion.
In the first quarter, current-dollar GDP increased 2.8 percent,
or $115.0 billion.  COMPREHENSIVE REVISION OF THE NATIONAL INCOME AND PRODUCT  ACCOUNTS: 1929 THROUGH FIRST QUARTER 2013  Today, BEA released revised statistics of gross domestic
product (GDP) and of other national income and product accounts
(NIPAs) series from 1929 through the first quarter of 2013.
Comprehensive revisions, which are carried out about every 5
years, are an important part of BEA’s regular process for
improving and modernizing its accounts to keep pace with the
ever-changing  U.S. economy .  Most of the tables in this release present revised
statistics for 2002 through the first quarter of 2013.  Selected
NIPA tables, with statistics from 1929 forward, are available on
BEA’s Web site (www.bea.gov).  Most of the remaining NIPA tables
will be released later in August.  An article describing the
statistics will be published in the September 2013 issue of
BEA’s monthly journal, the Survey of Current Business.  Summary of revisions  The picture of the economy shown in the revised estimates
is very similar in broad outline to the picture shown in the
previously published estimates.  The similarity and some of the
differences can be seen in the following:  *    For 1929-2012, the average annual growth rate of real GDP
was 3.3 percent, 0.1 percentage point higher than in the
previously published estimates.  For the more recent period,
2002-2012,
the growth rate was 1.8 percent, 0.2 percentage point higher
than in the previously published estimates.  *    For 2002-2012, the average rate of change in the prices
paid by U.S. residents was 2.3 percent, 0.1 percentage point
lower than in the previously published estimates.  *    For 2009-2012, the average annual growth rate of real GDP
was 2.4 percent, 0.3 percentage point higher than in the
previously published estimates.  The percent change in real GDP
was revised up 0.1 percentage point for 2010, was unrevised for
2011, and was revised up 0.6 percentage point for 2012.  *    For the period of contraction from the fourth quarter of
2007 to the second quarter of 2009, real GDP decreased at an
average annual rate of 2.9 percent; in the previously published
estimates, it
decreased 3.2 percent.  *    For the period of expansion from the second quarter of 2009
to the first quarter of 2013, real GDP increased at an average
annual rate of 2.2 percent; in the previously published
estimates, it         increased 2.1 percent.  Improvements incorporated in this comprehensive revision  Comprehensive revisions encompass three major types of
improvements:  *    Changes in definitions and in classifications that update
the accounts to more accurately portray the evolving U.S.
economy,  *    Changes in presentations that make the NIPA tables more
informative, and  *    Statistical changes that introduce new and improved
methodologies and that bring in newly available and revised
source data.  The improvements incorporated in the revised estimates
have been previewed in a series of articles in the Survey and
are available on BEA’s Web site at www.bea.gov/gdp-revisions.  Changes in definitions, classifications, and presentations.
The changes in definitions, in classifications, and in
presentations introduced in this comprehensive revision include
the following:  *    Expenditures by business, government, and nonprofit
institutions serving households (NPISH) for research and
development (R&D) are recognized as fixed investment.  The new
treatment improves BEA’s measures of fixed investment and allows
users to better measure the effects of innovation and intangible
assets on the economy.  *    Similarly, expenditures by private enterprises for the
creation of entertainment, literary, and artistic originals are
recognized as fixed investment, further expanding BEA’s measures
of intangible assets.  *    In the NIPA fixed investment tables, a new category of
investment, “intellectual property products,” consists of
research and development; entertainment, literary, and artistic
originals;
and software.  *    Transactions of defined benefit pension plans are recorded
on an accrual accounting basis, which recognizes the costs of
unfunded liabilities.  *    An expanded set of ownership transfer costs for residential
fixed assets is recognized as fixed investment, and the accuracy
of the associated asset values and services lives is improved.  *    The reference year for the chain-type quantity and price
indexes and for the chained-dollar estimates is updated to 2009
from 2005.  Statistical changes.  Important statistical changes that
introduce new and improved methodologies and that bring in newly
available source data include the following:  *    BEA’s 2007 benchmark input-output (I-O) accounts, which
provide the most thorough and detailed information on the
structure of the U.S. economy, are used to benchmark the
expenditure components of GDP and some of the income components.  *    Beginning with 1966, the estimates of employers・
contributions to state and local government- sponsored defined
contribution pension plans are improved by incorporating new
source data.  *    Beginning with 1985, the methods for computing financial
services provided by commercial banks are improved to establish
a more accurate picture of banking output.  *    Beginning with 1993, the estimates of proprietors・income
are improved by more accurately accounting for the  capital gains 
and losses attributable to corporate partners.  *    Beginning with 1993, the estimates of mortgage interest
paid for nonfarm permanent-site housing are improved by
incorporating several new data sources.  A table that summarizes the major sources of revision for
selected NIPA components is available on BEA’s Web site at
www.bea.gov/gdp-revisions.  Effects of improvements on major aggregates.  The
improvements and the new and revised source data incorporated
with this comprehensive revision have notable effects on
current-dollar NIPA aggregates without changing broad economic
trends or the general patterns of business cycles.  In the
aggregate, changes in definitions (mainly the recognition of new
forms of fixed investment) have the largest effect on current-dollar GDP and GDI for 1929・012, and statistical changes
(improved data and methodologies) tend to have smaller effects.
For example, for 2012, the level of current-dollar GDP was
revised up $559.8 billion; $526.0 billion of this upward
revision resulted from definitional changes.  Changes in definitions (mainly accrual accounting for
defined benefit pension plans, which credits households with the
value of accrued benefits from these plans) raise personal
income and personal saving; statistical changes have mixed
effects on personal income and on personal saving.  News release tables.  This release includes the tables that
will be regularly shown in future GDP news releases; in addition,
special tables have been included to highlight the effects of
the comprehensive revision.  The special tables are:  *    Tables 1A, 2A, and 4A compare revised and previously
published estimates for percent changes  in real GDP, for contributions to percent change in real
GDP, and for percent changes in chain-        type price indexes for GDP and related measures,
respectively;  *    Tables 7A, 7B, and 7C show annual levels, percent changes,
and revisions to percent changes for current-dollar GDP, for
real (chained-dollar) GDP, and for chain-type price indexes for
GDP,
respectively;  *    Table 12C shows revisions to corporate profits by industry.  Most of the tables show annual estimates beginning with
2002; quarterly estimates (if shown) begin with the first
quarter of 2007.  Three of the regular tables -- tables 3, 11,
and 12 -- are split into A and B segments in this release to
accommodate this longer-than-usual time span.  With this release, selected NIPA tables are available on
BEA痴 Web site.  Most of the remaining NIPA tables will be
available later in August.  New and revised data  The revised estimates reflect the incorporation of newly
available and revised source data.  The most important source
data that affect the estimates are BEA’s benchmark 2007 input-output (I-O) accounts.  The revised estimates also incorporate
data on inventories, on receipts and expenses of business
establishments and of governments, on sales by detailed
commodity and by product line, on final industry and product
shipments from the 2007 Economic Census, and on trade margins
from both the 2007 Economic Census and the 2007 annual surveys
of merchant wholesale and of retail trade.  In addition, the
revised estimates incorporate monthly and annual Census Bureau
industry data on manufacturing, on wholesale trade, and on
retail trade for 2003 forward.  The revised estimates also
reflect data on housing from the 2010 decennial Census of
Population and Housing.  Estimates that are based on BEA’s
international transactions accounts (ITAs) -- primarily net
exports of goods and services and rest-of-the-world income
receipts and payments -- were revised to reflect improvements to
the ITAs that were introduced since 2009.  Estimates of
underreported income were revised using  Internal Revenue Service 
(IRS) National Research Program data for 2006.  Other data that
were incorporated include revised data on the expenditures and
receipts of state and local governments for fiscal years 2006-2009 from the Census Bureau.  The revised estimates for 2010-2012 also reflect the
incorporation of newly available and revised source data that
became available since the last annual NIPA revision in July
2012.  The most important of these data sources are Census
Bureau annual surveys of state and local governments for fiscal
year 2010 (revised) and fiscal year 2011 (preliminary), of
manufactures for 2010 (revised) and 2011 (preliminary), of
merchant wholesale trade and of retail trade for 2010 (revised)
and 2011 (preliminary), and of services and of the value of
construction spending for 2010 and 2011 (revised) and 2012
(preliminary); federal government budget data for fiscal years
2012 and 2013 (revised); Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)
quarterly census of employment and wages (QCEW) for 2010-2012
(revised); IRS tabulations of corporate tax returns for 2010
(revised) and 2011 (preliminary) and of sole proprietorship and
partnership tax returns for 2011; and U.S. Department of
Agriculture (USDA) farm statistics for 2010-2012 (revised).  Data from BEA’s annual revision of the ITAs were
incorporated for 2010-2012 for most components at their “best
level;” revisions for earlier years, along with data from the
June 2014 revision of the ITAs, will be incorporated in the
NIPAs in the 2014 annual revision.  _____________  The revisions  For this comprehensive revision, many current-dollar
estimates were revised back to 1929, the earliest year for which
NIPA estimates are available, as a result of changes in
definitions, in classifications, and in presentations.  Real GDP growth.  For 1929-2012, the average annual growth
rate of real GDP was 3.3 percent, 0.1 percentage point higher
than in the previously published estimates.  For the more recent
period, 2002-2012, the average annual growth rate was 1.8
percent, 0.2 percentage point higher than in the previously
published estimates.  For the most recent years, 2009-2012, the
average annual growth rate of real GDP was 2.4 percent, 0.3
percentage point higher than in the previously published
estimates. For the 3 most recent years, the annual growth rate:  *    was revised up from 2.4 percent to 2.5 percent for 2010,
*    was unrevised at 1.8 percent for 2011, and  was revised up from 2.2 percent to 2.8 percent for 2012.  Real GDI growth.  For 1929-2012, the average annual growth
rate of real GDI was 3.3 percent, 0.1 percentage point higher
than in the previously published estimates.  For the more recent
period, 2002・012, the average annual growth rate was 1.8 percent,
0.2 percentage point higher than in the previously published
estimates.  For the most recent years, 2009・012, the average
annual growth rate of real GDI was 2.6 percent, 0.3 percentage
point higher than in the previously published estimates.  For
the 3 most recent years, the annual growth rate:  *    was revised down from 3.1 percent to 2.7 percent for 2010,
*    was revised up from 1.8 percent to 2.5 percent for 2011,
and
*    was revised up from 2.2 percent to 2.5 percent for 2012.  Business cycles.  For the contraction that lasted from the
fourth quarter of 2007 to the second quarter of 2009, real GDP
decreased at a 2.9 percent annual rate; in the previously
published estimates, it decreased 3.2 percent.  The cumulative
decrease in real GDP (not at an annual rate) was 4.3 percent; in
the previously published estimates, the cumulative decrease was
4.7 percent.  In the revised estimates, real GDP decreased in
the first, third, and fourth quarters of 2008 and in the first
and second quarters of 2009.  For the expansion from the second quarter of 2009 to the
first quarter of 2013, real GDP increased at a 2.2 percent
annual rate; in the previously published estimates, it increased
2.1 percent. From the third quarter of 2009 to the first quarter
of 2013, real GDP increased in all quarters except for the first
quarter of 2011, when real GDP decreased 1.3 percent; in the
previously published estimates, real GDP increased in all
quarters during this period.  Earlier business cycles show
little revision.  Price changes.  The revisions to major price indexes are
small.  For 1929-2012, the average annual increase in the price
index for gross domestic purchases was revised down from 3.0
percent to 2.9 percent; the average annual increase in the price
index for GDP was unrevised at 2.9 percent.  For 2002-2012, the
average annual increase in the price index for gross domestic
purchases was revised down from 2.4 percent to 2.3 percent; the
average annual increase in the price index for GDP was revised
down from 2.3 percent to 2.1 percent.  For 2009-2012, the
average annual increase in the price index for gross domestic
purchases was revised down from 1.9 percent to 1.8 percent; the
average annual increase in the price index for GDP was revised
down from 1.8 percent to 1.6 percent.  For 1929-2012, the average annual increase in the price
index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE) was unrevised
at 2.9 percent.  For 2002・012, the average annual increase in
the PCE price index was revised down from 2.2 percent to 2.1
percent.  For 2009-2012, the average annual increase in the PCE
price index was unrevised at 2.0 percent.  Real disposable personal income (DPI) growth.  For 1929-2012, the average annual increase in real DPI was 3.2 percent,
0.1 percentage point higher than in the previously published
estimates.  For 2002-2012, the average annual increase was 2.0
percent, 0.2 percentage point higher than in the previously
published estimates.  For 2009-2012, the average annual increase
was 1.8 percent, 0.2 percentage point higher than in the
previously published estimates.  Personal saving.  Personal saving (DPI less personal
outlays) was revised up for 1929-2007, down for 2008, and up for
2009-2012.  These revisions reflect the revisions to DPI and are
mainly the result of adopting the accrual treatment of defined
benefit pension plans.  The personal saving rate (personal
saving as a percentage of DPI) was revised up for 1929-2007,
down for 2008, and up for 2009-2012, reflecting the revisions to
personal saving.  Revisions to current-dollar estimates  The revisions to current-dollar GDP, to personal income
and its disposition, and to national income are shown in table
1B.  This table shows the “revisions in level,” that is, the
revised estimates less the previously published estimates; table
1B also shows the revisions as a percent of the previously
published estimates for selected years.  The revised levels of
annual GDP and its major components for 1965-2012, along with
percent changes from the preceding year and revisions to the
percent changes, are shown in table 7A.  GDP.  Current-dollar GDP was revised up for all years
(1929・012).  The upward revisions to current-dollar GDP mainly
reflect the recognition of additional expenditures -- for R&D;
for the creation of entertainment, literary, and artistic
originals; and for an expanded set of ownership transfer costs -
- as fixed investment (see “Revision Analysis for GDP, 2012”).
The new accrual treatment for government-sponsored defined
benefit pension plans results in revisions to current-dollar GDP
through revisions to supplements to wages and salaries for
government employees (specifically, employer contributions for
employee pension and insurance funds); these revisions are
upward for 1929-1978, downward for 1979-1991, and upward for
1992-2012.  PCE.  Revisions to PCE are generally small before 1985;
PCE was revised up for 1985 and 1986, down for 1987-2011, and up
for 2012.  PCE for services accounts for most of the revisions
for all years except for 2011.  Services.  PCE for services was revised up for 1985 and
1986, down for 1987-2010, and up for 2011 and 2012.  For most
years beginning with 1985, the improved method for estimating
services of commercial banks results in downward revisions to
PCE for financial services.  For 1965-2012 (and for several
prior years), the gross output of NPISH was revised down; the
removal of R&D expenses of NPISH (and their reclassification as
fixed investment) more than offsets the addition to expenses of
consumption of fixed capital (CFC) for R&D capital.  The
revisions also reflect the incorporation of the 2007 benchmark
I-O accounts, of new and revised annual Census Bureau surveys of
services, and of other new and revised source data.  Goods.  Revisions to PCE for goods begin with 1998 and
follow a mixed pattern, with downward revisions for 2010・012.
The revisions to PCE for goods reflect the incorporation of the
2007 benchmark I-O accounts, of new and revised data from the
Census Bureau’s retail trade surveys, and of other new and
revised source data.  Private fixed investment.  Current-dollar private fixed
investment was revised up for 1929-2012.  The upward revisions
reflect the recognition of additional expenditures -- for R&D;
for the creation of entertainment, literary, and artistic
originals; and for an expanded set of ownership transfer costs -
- as fixed investment.  Nonresidential structures.  The downward revisions for
2003-2012 primarily reflect the incorporation of data from the
2007 benchmark I-O accounts, of revised footage drilled and
expenditure data from the Census Bureau and trade sources, and
of revised Census Bureau construction spending data.  Equipment.   Software is now classified as part of
intellectual property products rather than as part of private
equipment and software.  Private equipment (without software)
was revised up for 2003- 2012, reflecting the incorporation of
BEA’s 2007 benchmark I-O accounts, of new and revised Census
Bureau surveys of manufactures, and of other new and revised
source data.  Residential fixed investment.  The upward revisions to
residential fixed investment for 1929-2012 mainly reflect the
recognition of an expanded set of ownership transfer costs for
residential fixed assets as fixed investment.  The revisions
also reflect the incorporation of data from the 2007 benchmark
I-O accounts and of new and revised data from the Census Bureau
surveys of construction spending.  Intellectual property products.  Beginning with this
comprehensive revision, the NIPA tables include a new category
of fixed investment, “intellectual property products.”  The
recognition of expenditures for R&D and for the creation of
entertainment, literary, and artistic originals as fixed
investment results in upward revisions to gross private domestic
investment.  The downward revisions to software investment for
2010-2012 (and small revisions for 2003-2009) reflect the
incorporation of the 2007 benchmark I-O accounts and of new and
revised annual Census Bureau surveys of services.  Change in private inventories.  The revisions begin with
2002 and are mostly upward; the revisions are dominated by
revisions to nonfarm inventories for 2002-2010 and by farm
inventories for 2011 and 2012.  The revisions to nonfarm
inventories reflect data from a variety of sources, including
newly available and revised Census Bureau data on inventory book
values, and the incorporation of new commodity price weights
from the 2007 benchmark I-O accounts.  The revisions to farm
inventories reflect revised USDA farm statistics for 2010-2012.  Exports and imports of goods and services.  Revisions to
net exports of goods and services are generally small before
2002; the revisions are upward for 2002-2007, downward for 2008-2011, and upward for 2012.  The revisions to net exports are
mostly due to revisions to exports for 2002-2009 and for 2012
and are mostly due to revisions to imports for 2010 and 2011.
Exports were revised up for 2002-2007, down for 2008-2010, and
up for 2011 and 2012.  The revisions to imports are upward for
2010 and 2011 and are small for other years.  The estimates
reflect the incorporation of revised data from BEA’s ITAs for
1999-2012.  Government consumption expenditures and gross investment.
Government consumption expenditures and gross investment was
revised up for 1929-2012.  The revisions mainly reflect the
recognition of expenditures for R&D as fixed investment and the
addition to consumption expenditures of the CFC for R&D assets.  Federal government.  The upward revisions to federal
government consumption expenditures and gross investment for
1929-2012 mainly reflect the recognition of expenditures for R&D
as fixed investment.  The new accrual treatment for defined
benefit pension plans results in upward revisions to
contributions for employee pension and insurance funds for 1929-1979 and downward revisions for 1980-2012.  The revisions also
reflect improved source data and methods, including revised
 federal budget  data for 2012 and 2013.  State and local government.  State and local government
consumption expenditures and gross investment was revised up for
1929-1975, down for 1976-1988, and up for 1989-2012.  These
revisions mainly reflect the new accrual approach for measuring
state and local government-sponsored defined benefit pension
plans, which results in revisions to state and local government
contributions for employee pension and insurance funds that are
upward for 1929-1978, downward for 1979-1986, and upward for
1987-2012.  Revisions also result from statistical changes,
including the incorporation of improved source data on
expenditures for defined contribution pension plans and the
improved method for estimating services of commercial banks.
The revisions also reflect the incorporation of the 2007
benchmark I-O accounts, of new and revised government finances
data from the Census Bureau, and of other new and revised source
data.  Personal income.   Personal income was revised up for
1929-2007, down for 2008, and up for 2009-2012.  These revisions
mainly reflect the accrual approach for measuring defined
benefit pension plans, which results in upward revisions to
personal income receipts on assets for 1929-2012 and in upward
revisions to supplements (specifically, employer contributions
for employee pension and insurance funds) for 1929-1975, for
1989-2002, and for 2004-2011.  A number of other definitional
and statistical changes affected the revisions to personal
income.  The revisions to the components of personal income are
discussed below.  Wages and salaries.  The revisions mainly reflect
revisions to private wages and salaries.  The revisions are
generally small and mixed for years prior to 2002, are downward
for 2002-2011, and are upward for 2012.  The revisions reflect
revised estimates of misreporting and new and revised BLS QCEW
data.  Supplements to wages and salaries.  The revisions to
supplements reflect the revisions to employer contributions for
pension and insurance funds that result from the accrual
approach for measuring defined benefit pension plans.  Employer
contributions for state and local government defined benefit
plans was revised up for 1929-1978, down for 1979-1986, and up
for 1987-2012. Employer contributions for federal government
defined benefit plans was revised up for 1929-1979 and down for
1980-2012.  Employer contributions for private defined benefit
plans was revised down for 1968-1985, up for 1986-2001, down for
2002-2006, up for 2007, and down for 2008-2012. Contributions
for state and local government defined contribution pension
plans was revised up for 1967-2012, reflecting the incorporation
of improved source data.  Proprietors’ income.  Proprietors’ income was revised down
for 1965-2011 and up for 2012; the revisions for years before
1965 are small.  Nonfarm proprietors’ income was revised down
for 1965-2011 and up for 2012.  The revisions to proprietors・
income primarily reflect revisions to nonfarm proprietors’
income for most years (except for 2009 and for 2012).  Farm
proprietors’ income had relatively large upward revisions for
2011 and 2012, reflecting the incorporation of revised USDA data
for 2010-2012.  The revisions to nonfarm proprietors’ income reflect a
number of definitional and statistical changes as well as
revised source data.  Revisions due to the improved accounting
for the capital gains and losses attributable to corporate
partners are downward for 2002-2008, upward for 2009, and
downward for 2010-2012.  Revisions due to the capitalization of
expenditures for the creation of entertainment, literary, and
artistic originals and for an expanded set of ownership transfer
costs are downward, while the revisions due to the
capitalization of R&D expenditures are upward.  The revisions
also reflect new IRS estimates for underreporting of income as
well as new IRS tabulations of tax return data for sole
proprietorships and partnerships for 2011.  Rental income of persons.  Rental income of persons was
revised down for 1929-2002 and was revised up for 2003 forward.
The improved methodology for estimating mortgage interest paid
for nonfarm permanent site housing results in downward revisions
to rental income of persons for 1993 -2001 and upward revisions
for 2002-2012.  The recognition of an expanded set of ownership
transfer costs for residential assets as fixed investment
results in downward revisions for all years, partly offsetting
the upward revisions to rental income of persons for 2003-2012.
The revisions also reflect revisions to owner- and tenant-occupied space rent, based on data from the 2010 Census of
Housing and the incorporation of other new and revised source
data.  Personal interest income.  Personal interest income was
revised up for all years except for 2008.  The upward revisions
mainly reflect the new accrual treatment of defined benefit
pension plans. Personal interest income was also affected by
several other changes in methodology, including an improved
method for distributing the investment income of regulated
investment companies by type of income and the improved method
for measuring interest associated with financial services of
commercial banks.  Revisions to personal interest income also
reflect the incorporation of new and revised source data from
the Federal Reserve Board and other sources.  Personal dividend income.  Personal dividend income was
revised up for most years for 1991- 2009, was revised down for
2010, was revised up for 2011, and was revised down for 2012.
The revisions to personal dividend income reflect the improved
method for distributing the investment income of regulated
investment companies by type of income as well as the
incorporation of new and revised IRS tabulations of corporate
tax returns and of data from BEA’s ITAs on dividends from the
rest of the world.  Personal current transfer receipts.  Personal current
transfer receipts was revised down for 2002, up for 2003-2009,
and down for 2010-2012.  The revisions reflect the incorporation
of new and revised source data.  Contributions for government social insurance.  The
revisions to contributions for government social insurance
(which is deducted in the calculation of personal income) are
small for 2002-2012.  Personal current taxes.  Personal current taxes was
revised up for 2011 and 2012; revisions are generally small for
prior years.  The revisions reflect the incorporation of new tax
collections data from the Treasury Department and the  Social
Security Administration  and of new and revised Census Bureau
state and local government finances data.  Disposable personal income.  The pattern of revisions to
disposable personal income, which is equal to personal income
less personal current taxes, is similar to that of personal
income.  Personal outlays.  This series consists of PCE, personal
interest payments, and personal current transfer payments.  The
revisions to personal outlays primarily reflect the revisions to
PCE that were previously described.  Personal interest payments
was revised up for 1985 forward; revisions for prior years are
small.  The revisions to personal interest payments result from
the improved method for measuring the financial services of
commercial banks and associated interest income from the
incorporation of new and revised source data.  Personal current
transfer payments was revised down for 2007-2012.  GDI.  Current-dollar GDI, like current-dollar GDP, was
revised up for all years for 1929-2012. The upward revisions to
current-dollar GDI and GDP mainly reflect the recognition of
additional expenditures -- for R&D; for the creation of
entertainment, literary, and artistic originals; and for an
expanded set of ownership transfer costs -- as fixed investment.  National income.  National income was revised up for 1929・
978, down for 1979-2001, up for 2002-2004, down for 2005-2010,
and up for 2011 and 2012.  The revisions to national income
reflect the revisions to the components of national income that
were previously described; the revisions to the remaining
components of national income are discussed below.  Corporate profits with inventory valuation and capital
consumption adjustments.
Corporate profits was revised up for 1929-1986, down for 1987-2001, and up for 2002-2012. Revisions to corporate profits due
to the capitalization of expenditures for R&D and for the
creation of entertainment, literary, and artistic originals are
upward for 1929-2012.  Revisions to corporate profits due to the
new accrual treatment of defined benefit pension plans are
upward for 1968-1985, downward for 1986-2002, upward for 2003-2006, downward for 2007-2009, and upward for 2010-2012.  The
improved method for distributing the investment income of
regulated investment companies by type of income results in
revisions that are downward for 1992-2001, upward for 2002, and
downward for 2003-2012.  The revisions to corporate profits also
reflect the incorporation of new and revised IRS tabulations of
corporate tax return data and of new and revised data from BEA’s
ITAs and from other sources.  Net interest and miscellaneous payments.  Net interest and
miscellaneous payments was revised up for most years for 1965-2001 and down for 2002-2012.  Revisions for years prior to 1965
are small.  The revisions reflect the incorporation of several
definitional and statistical improvements, including the new
accrual treatment of defined benefit pension plans, the improved
method for distributing the investment income of regulated
investment companies by type of income, the improved methodology
for estimating mortgage interest paid for nonfarm permanent site
housing, and the improved method for measuring the financial
services of commercial banks, and the incorporation of new and
revised data from a number of sources.  Consumption of fixed capital (CFC).  CFC was revised up
substantially for 1929-2012.  The upward revisions to CFC
reflect the addition of CFC for R&D; for the creation of
entertainment, literary, and artistic originals; and for an
expanded set of ownership transfer costs of residential assets.
In addition, CFC was revised up to reflect a faster depreciation
rate of brokers・commissions on residential structures.  The
revisions to CFC also reflect statistical improvements and
revisions to BEA’s estimates of fixed investment and prices.  Statistical discrepancy.  The statistical discrepancy,
which is the difference between GDP and GDI, was revised for
1929-2012.  The directions of the revisions are mixed for 1929-2000; the statistical discrepancy was revised down for 2001-2003,
was revised up for 2004-2008, was revised down for 2009, was
revised up for 2010, and was revised down for 2011 and 2012.
(In theory, GDP should equal GDI; in practice, they differ
because their components are estimated using largely independent
and less-than-perfect source data.)  Next release -- August 29, 2013, at 8:30 A.M. EDT for:
