Aer Lingus Group Plc (AERL)  stuck to a
forecast that full-year earnings will match the figure from 2012
as the Irish airline expands trans-Atlantic operations.  Operating profit excluding one-time gains or losses will be
“broadly” in line with the 69.1 million euros ($91.7 million)
posted last year, Dublin-based Aer Lingus said today in a
statement. Second-quarter earnings on that basis declined 8.2
percent to 29.1 million euros, while sales increased 6.2 percent
to 398.2 million euros.  Aer Lingus is looking to grab a bigger slice of the
lucrative market for flights linking North America with Europe,
adding San Francisco and Toronto as destinations next year. The
carrier is also pursuing a contract-flying strategy aimed at
handling short-haul routes for major European airlines that are
keen to exit unprofitable services while retaining feeder
traffic to their hubs.  “Our long-haul business has grown significantly ahead of
capacity additions ex-the U.S., and that’s U.S. traffic not just
to Ireland, but also into continental Europe,” Chief Commercial
Officer Stephen Kavanagh said on a conference call with
journalists today. “We’re having good success with using Dublin
as a hub for trans-Atlantic operations.”  Aer Lingus  fell  as much as 0.2 percent to 1.66 euros as of
9:20 a.m. in Dublin, reversing a gain of as much as 3.2 percent
earlier in the day. The stock has risen 50 percent this year
valuing the company at 880.5 million euros.  The airline expanded long-haul capacity by 16 percent in
the quarter and filled 95 percent of seating in June. Aer Lingus
spent 2.1 million euros in the first quarter on training staff
and adding aircraft to begin wet-lease operations in April for
London-based Virgin Atlantic Airways Ltd.’s Little Red domestic
service, Chief Financial Officer Andrew Macfarlane said on the
call.  The first-half net loss widened to 23.5 million euros from
21.9 million euros a year earlier, Aer Lingus said. Sales
climbed 5 percent to 657.9 million pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
