China  arrested two people for
selling more than 35,000 kilograms of horse meat as beef, the
official Xinhua News Agency reported today.  The suspects, two brothers, had operated in a county in the
eastern Chinese province of Jiangxi and began passing off horse
as beef because the profit from beef sales was low, according to
Xinhua. They collected more than 1.28 million  yuan  ($209,000) in
sales, according to the report. Another accomplice remains at
large, Xinhua reported, without citing anyone.  The incident is the latest in a series of food safety
violations that have come to light as Premier  Li Keqiang  seeks
to ease public outrage sparked by cases including tainted milk
powder and chemicals in liquor. Chinaâ€™s central government
called on local authorities to tighten scrutiny of meat
production and sales in May after police busted a ring that sold
fox and mink meat as mutton.  Earlier this year, companies including  Nestle SA (NESN)  and Ikea
Group pulled products in Europe after tests found horse meat in
beef products. The European Union ordered testing across the
region, while South Africa, spurred by the discoveries, began
investigating how unlabeled donkey, goat and water buffalo got
into supermarket products.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
