Natural gas futures rebounded from a
five-month low in  New York  on speculation that seasonal weather
helped limit U.S. inventory gains.  Gas rose as much as 1.2 percent before a government report
tomorrow that may show supplies expanded 54 billion cubic feet
last week, based on the median of 10  analyst estimates  compiled
by Bloomberg. The five-year average gain for the period is 47
billion and the year-earlier increase was 28 billion. Gas slid
to a five-month low yesterday on mild weather.  “We were bound to get a little bit of a retracement after
the market came down pretty hard,” said Tom Saal, senior vice
president of energy trading at FCStone Latin America LLC in
Miami. “The focus today and tomorrow will be on the number for
storage. If you compare it to last year, the number is bearish,
but if you compare it to earlier in the season, the numbers
might be a little less bearish to neutral.”  Natural gas for September delivery rose 1.7 cents, or 0.5
percent, to $3.449 per million British thermal units at 9:26
a.m. on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Trading volume was 59
percent below the 100-day average. Prices have declined 3.2
percent since June, heading for a second monthly drop.  To contact the reporter on this story:
