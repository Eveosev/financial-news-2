Taiwan’s bonds fell this month, with
the benchmark  five-year  yield rising the most since December
2010, on speculation the  Federal Reserve  will start tapering its
asset purchases this year.  The U.S. monetary authority may give further clues after
the end of a two-day meeting today on when it will begin paring
the stimulus that has boosted demand for emerging-market assets.
Local bonds dropped for a third day after the Ministry of
Finance set the cutoff yield higher than traders expected at a
30-year bond auction yesterday.  The yield on the 0.875 percent notes due January 2018 rose
12 basis points, or 0.12 percentage point, this month to 1.12
percent in Taipei, according to Gretai Securities Market.  “We’re waiting to see if the Fed is going to send more
definite signals on when the tapering will begin,” said  James Wang , a fixed-income trader at Yuanta Securities Co. in Taipei.
“The yield the  finance ministry  set yesterday was closer to
what traders would accept, and concern over the MOF reining in
rising yields in the primary market has eased.”  The MOF sold NT$26.3 billion ($878 million) of 30-year
notes yesterday, short of the NT$30 billion offered, at a cutoff
yield of 2.5 percent, according to an official statement.
Traders in a Bloomberg survey expected it to be 2.3 percent.  Dutch Auction  Taiwan sells bonds through Dutch auctions where investors
bid on the yield and the government sets the coupon by taking
the highest winning offer. While a cutoff yield is set at each
sale, the Treasury only imposes it if the highest bid exceeds
the limit.  The  Taiwan dollar  was little changed in July at NT$30.12
and fell 0.4 percent today against the greenback, Taipei Forex
Inc. prices show. Global funds bought $2.8 billion more Taiwan
stocks than they sold this month, according to exchange data.  The local dollar rose 0.1 percent 14 minutes before the 4
p.m. close. The central bank has sold the currency in the run-up
to the close on most days in the past year, according to traders
who asked not to be identified.  One-month non-deliverable forwards slipped 0.2 percent this
month and today to NT$30.01, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. One-month implied volatility, a gauge of expected
moves in the  exchange rate  used to price options, fell 148 basis
points in July to 3.965 percent. It rose 11 basis points today.  The  overnight interbank lending  rate was steady at 0.388
percent, according to a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan
Interbank Money Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
