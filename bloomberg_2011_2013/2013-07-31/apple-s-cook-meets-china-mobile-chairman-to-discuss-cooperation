Apple Inc. (AAPL)  Chief Executive Officer
 Tim Cook  met  China Mobile Ltd. (941) ’s chairman for the second time
this year in Beijing to discuss possible cooperation between the
iPhone maker and the world’s largest phone company.  Cook visited Xi Guohua at the carrier’s headquarters
yesterday morning, China Mobile said in an e-mailed statement
today. Kitty Potter, a Beijing-based spokeswoman for Apple, said
she had no information on Cook’s agenda.  China Mobile, with 740 million subscribers in the world’s
largest handset market, is the only one of the nation’s three
carriers not currently offering the iPhone. China Mobile’s
third-generation network is incompatible with the device, and
Apple hasn’t made the required adjustments.  Cook and Xi held talks in Beijing in January. China is
Apple’s second-largest market after the U.S., and China Mobile
accounts for 63 percent of the nation’s users. China Mobile
Chief Executive Officer Li Yue said last year a deal must be
mutually beneficial to both companies.  The current visit comes as Apple said this week it will
investigate allegations by advocacy group China Labor Watch that
factories run by Taiwanese supplier  Pegatron Corp. (4938)  use underage
workers, pay insufficient wages and force employees to work
overtime.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
