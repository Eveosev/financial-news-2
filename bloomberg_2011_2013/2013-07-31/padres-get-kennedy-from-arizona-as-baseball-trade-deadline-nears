The  Baltimore Orioles  acquired
pitcher Bud Norris from the Houston Astros ahead of yesterday’s
Major League Baseball trade deadline, seeking to bolster their
starting rotation as they pursue a playoff berth.  Norris, who is 6-9 with a 3.93 earned run average, goes
from the team that has the worst record in the majors to a squad
that’s 59-49. Baltimore is 5 ½ games behind first-place  Boston
Red Sox  in the American League Eastern Division and trails the
Tampa Bay Rays and  Cleveland Indians  by one-half game for the
AL’s wild-card playoff spot.  The Astros, who are 36-70, also traded outfielder Justin Maxwell to the Kansas City Royals for minor-league pitcher Kyle
Smith before MLB’s 4 p.m. Eastern time trade deadline.  The  San Diego Padres  acquired pitcher Ian Kennedy, a former
21-game winner, from the  Arizona  Diamondbacks for left-handed
reliever Joe Thatcher, a minor league pitcher and a draft pick.  Norris, a 28-year-old right-hander, is 34-46 with a 4.33
ERA over five seasons with the Astros. He joins a starting
rotation that includes Jason Hammel, Chris Tillman, Miguel Gonzalez, Scott Feldman and Wei-Yin Chen. Baltimore placed
Hammel on the disabled list yesterday with a strained right
elbow.  The Padres got Kennedy for Thatcher, minor-league reliever
Matt Stites and a competitive-balance selection that falls
between the second and third round of the 2014 draft.  Kennedy, 28, was the Diamondbacks’ opening-day pitcher each
of the last three seasons and finished fourth in the National
League Cy Young Award voting in 2011 after going 21-4 with a
2.88 ERA. He was 15-12 with a 4.02 ERA last season and this year
is 3-8 with a 5.23 ERA.  ‘Step Forward’  “We’re excited to add a starting pitcher of Ian’s
pedigree,” Padres General Manager Josh Byrnes said in a
statement. “He is under club control through 2015, and we feel
he will help us take another step forward as a team.”  Kennedy has a 49-38 record with a 3.99 ERA in 133 games,
including 131 starts, since breaking into the majors with the
 New York Yankees  during the 2007 season.  Thatcher, 31, is 3-1 with a 2.10 ERA in 50 relief
appearances this season and adds a left-hander to the
Diamondbacks’ bullpen as they pursue a playoff spot.  The Red Sox got former Cy Young winner Jake Peavy two days
ago as part of a three-team deal with the Chicago White Sox and
 Detroit Tigers .  To contact the reporter on this story:
