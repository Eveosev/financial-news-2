India ’s 10-year bond yield headed
for the biggest monthly advance in four years as a plunging
rupee raised concern the central bank may have to prolong
increases in borrowing costs intended to support the currency.  The rupee fell to within 0.1 percent of a record low today
and has dropped 3.3 percent against the dollar this week. The
 Reserve Bank  of India said yesterday this month’s increases in
the bank and marginal standing facility rates will be reversed
in a measured way as the currency stabilizes.  “While the RBI has guided that these measures are
temporary, there is no guarantee that depreciation pressures
will end within that timeframe,” Nomura Holdings Inc. economist
 Sonal Varma  in Mumbai and strategist Vivek Rajpal in  Singapore 
wrote in a note yesterday. “In our view, the rupee is
fundamentally poised to weaken.”  The yield on the 7.16 percent bonds due May 2023 rose 87
basis points in July to 8.32 percent as of 10 a.m. in Mumbai,
according to prices from the central bank’s trading system. That
was the biggest monthly advance for a benchmark 10-year yield
since March 2009. The rate increased six basis points today and
reached 8.42 percent on July 24, the highest since May 2012.  India’s currency has been hurt by a record current-account
deficit and the prospect of less U.S. monetary stimulus, which
has spurred capital outflows from  emerging markets . Global funds
have cut holdings of Indian debt by $8.9 billion from a  record 
$38.5 billion on May 21. The  Federal Reserve  said May 22 that
its asset-buying program could be tapered if the U.S. job market
continues to improve.  RBI Measures  GovernorDuvvuri Subbarao held the repurchase rate at 7.25
percent yesterday, after the RBI said July 29 the rupee has
become the priority for monetary policy. The central bank this
month capped the amount banks can borrow in daily repurchase
auctions at 0.5 percent of deposits and increased the daily
balance requirement for lenders’ cash-reserve ratios to 99
percent from 70 percent. It also raised the marginal standing
facility and the  bank rate  to 10.25 percent from 8.25 percent.  The one-year interest-rate swap, a derivative contract used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, rose 12 basis
points, or 0.12 percentage point, today to 9.61 percent, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. It touched 9.63 percent, the highest
level in almost five years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
