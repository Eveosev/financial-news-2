Stocks in Switzerland  were little
changed, with the benchmark Swiss Market Index heading for the
biggest monthly gain since March, as investors awaited U.S.
economic-growth data and the  Federal Reserve ’s policy decision.  The  SMI (SMI)  dropped 0.1 percent to 7,803.73 at 10:21 a.m. in
Zurich, having earlier lost as much as 0.6 percent. The
benchmark gauge has gained 1.5 percent in July as the Fed said
it remains flexible on the future of its bond-buying program.
The central bank will reveal the outcome of its two-day meeting
after European markets close today. The broader Swiss
Performance Index decreased 0.1 percent today.  The volume of shares changing hands in Stoxx 600 companies
was 20 percent lower than the average of the last 30 days,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The Fed will leave its  benchmark interest rate  at 0.25
percent, according to every economist in a Bloomberg survey. The
central bank may begin to reduce its bond-purchase program in
September, economists predicted in a separate survey.  A report at 8:30 a.m.  New York  time may show the world’s
biggest economy grew at a 1 percent annual rate from April
through June. It expanded at a 1.8 percent pace in the first
three months of the year.  A separate release at 8:15 a.m. will show companies in the
U.S. hired a net 180,000 workers this month, economists
projected. The ADP Research Institute’s report showed that
private employers increased their workforce by 188,000 in June.  To contact the reporter on this story:
