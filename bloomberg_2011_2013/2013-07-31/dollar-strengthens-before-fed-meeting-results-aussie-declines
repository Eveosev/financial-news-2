The dollar gained on expectations
that the  Federal Reserve  will reiterate plans to slow the pace
of monthly asset purchases this year at the conclusion of
today’s policy meeting.  The greenback erased losses versus the euro and yen as
reports showed companies boosted payrolls in July by the most
this year and the  U.S. economy  grew more than projected in the
second quarter. Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said this month a
reduction in the central bank’s bond-buying program would depend
on the economy’s performance. The Australian dollar fell to its
weakest level in almost three years on speculation the country’s
central bank will cut  interest rates .  “The better-than-expected nature of the data is considered
taper-positive,”  Joe Manimbo , a market analyst at Western Union
Business Solutions, a unit of Western Union Co., said by phone
from  Washington . “The dollar is getting a solid fundamental
boost. Nothing in the data subtracts from expectations of a
September taper.”  The Bloomberg U.S. Dollar Index rose 0.1 percent to
1,027.99 at 12:37 p.m. in New York, the third straight daily
gain. The index is down 1.2 percent this month.  The U.S. currency declined 0.2 percent to $1.3289 per euro,
after gaining as much as 0.4 percent. The greenback climbed 0.3
percent to 98.30 per yen after touching 98.59.  Japan ’s currency
decreased 0.5 percent versus the euro to 130.63, after
increasing 0.5 percent to 129.32, the strongest since July 12.  Rand, Forint  The  Federal Open Market Committee  will release its
statement at 2 p.m. in Washington. The panel will probably wait
until September to reduce the monthly purchases by $20 billion
to a total of $65 billion, according to half of the 54
economists surveyed by  Bloomberg News  from July 18-22.  South Africa ’s rand declined versus all 16 of its most-traded peers even as the country’s trade gap narrowed for a
second month in June. The  deficit  fell to 7.7 billion rand ($775
million) from 11 billion rand in May, the Pretoria-based South
African Revenue Service said in an e-mailed statement today.  The currency weakened 1 percent to 9.8965 per dollar after
touching 9.9490, the lowest since July 19. The rand has fallen
0.2 percent versus the dollar in July.  The  Hungarian forint  headed for its first monthly loss in
four after the country’s central bank said it would continue
cutting interest rates and as the economy minister met lenders
to discuss plans to phase out foreign-currency mortgages.  The forint was little changed at 225.53 per dollar after
falling to 227.24, the lowest since July 11. The forint weakened
0.2 percent to 299.80 per euro.  GDP Increase  The Fed’s asset purchases “are by no means on a preset
course,” and could be reduced or expanded as economic
conditions warrant, Bernanke told lawmakers on July 17.  U.S. gross domestic product, the value of all goods and
services produced, rose at a 1.7 percent annualized rate, after
a 1.1 percent gain the prior quarter, Commerce Department
figures showed. The median forecast of 85 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg called for a 1 percent advance.  Companies in the U.S. boosted payrolls in July by the most
this year as employers grew more optimistic demand will pick up
in the second half of the year. The 200,000 increase in
employment was more than projected and followed a revised
198,000 gain in June that was higher than initially estimated,
according to data today from the ADP Research Institute in
Roseland,  New Jersey . The median forecast of 40 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg called for a July advance of 180,000.  Aussie Drops  The dollar has strengthened 4.8 percent this year, the
second-most behind the euro’s 5.7 percent increase, according to
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes that track 10 developed-nation currencies. The Australian dollar led all decliners with
an 11 percent drop, while the yen fell 8.8 percent, the second-most.  The Australian dollar declined to its weakest level in
almost three years as speculation the  Reserve Bank  of  Australia 
will cut borrowing costs next week curbed demand for the
currency. Governor Glenn Stevens said yesterday the inflation
outlook provided room for additional policy easing.  Stevens’s comments “really left the door open for more
easing, and those dovish signs give us more confidence in our
view that the RBA will cut rates once again,” said Janu Chan,
an economist at St. George Bank Ltd. in Sydney. “The Aussie
will weaken from here,” said Chan, who sees the currency at 89
cents by year-end.  The Aussie declined 1.1 percent to 89.63 U.S. cents after
dropping to 89.42 cents, the weakest level since September 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
