Nigerian banks  will see
profitability decline because of tougher regulations and higher
funding costs, said  Fitch Ratings .  “We expect new limits on bank charges imposed by the
 Central Bank  of  Nigeria  to dent what have been highly profitable
fees and commissions, particularly for those with large retail
franchises,” Fitch said in a statement today. “ Monetary policy 
continues to be tight with the central bank last week raising
the cash reserve requirement on public sector deposits.”  Nigeria’s central bank introduced a 50 percent cash reserve
requirement on public sector funds on July 23 after warning of
the risk of excess liquidity in the banking system. The
regulation, which applies to about 1.3 trillion naira ($8.1
billion) of deposits, could result in 500 billion naira of
liquidity being withdrawn, Fitch said.  Lower Treasury bill yields this year may weaken interest
income, said Fitch. An increase in the annual levy paid by the
country’s banks to fund the Asset Management Corp. of Nigeria,
which the government set up in 2010 to buy lenders’ bad debts,
may boots cost-to-income ratios, the ratings company said. The
charge was raised to 0.5 percent of bank assets, from 0.3
percent.  The Nigerian Stock Exchange Banking 10 Index, which tracks
the 10 largest lenders by market value, has advanced 19 percent
this year, trailing the 35 percent increase of the  Nigerian
Stock Exchange All-Share Index. (NGSEINDX)   To contact the reporter on this story:
