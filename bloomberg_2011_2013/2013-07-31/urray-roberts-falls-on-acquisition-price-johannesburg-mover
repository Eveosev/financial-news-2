Murray & Roberts Holdings Ltd. (MUR) ,
 South Africa ’s second-biggest builder by market value, fell the
most in more than two years as investors fretted the company
will overpay for an Australian acquisition.  The  stock fell  5.6 percent, the biggest decline since
February 2011, to 23.78 rand at close in Johannesburg, the
lowest level since June 14. About 8.6 million shares traded, 4.6
times the three-month daily average.  Murray & Roberts offered to buy the 38.4 percent in
 Australia ’s Clough Ltd it doesn’t already own for about 4
billion rand ($403.9 million) in cash, the Johannesburg-based
company said in a statement after the market closed yesterday.
It will pay about A$1.46 a share, a 31 percent premium over
 Clough’s (CLO)  July 30 close of $1.115, according to the statement.  “The initial market reaction would appear to be concern
that Murray & Roberts would pay an excessive premium for the
remaining interest in Clough,” Brent Madel, an analyst at Cape
Town-based BPI Capital Africa Pty Ltd., said in a phone
interview today. “It may take a few days for investors to
correctly ascertain whether this level of premium is warranted
given the strong growth prospects Clough has in the Australian
LNG market.”  Murray & Roberts is targeting the oil, gas, power and
mining industries to propel medium- to long-term growth, Chief
Executive Officer Henry Laas said in a separate e-mailed
statement yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
