The  Boston  Red Sox acquired former
Cy Young Award winner Jake Peavy as part of a three-team deal
with the Chicago White Sox and  Detroit  Tigers less than 24 hours
before today’s trade deadline.  The seven-player trade, in which shortstop Jose Iglesias
went to the Tigers and outfielder Avisail Garcia moved to the
White Sox, was announced by Red Sox General Manager  Ben Cherington  in a team e-mail late last night.  The Major League Baseball trade deadline is today at 4 p.m.
New York time.  The Red Sox are a half-game behind the Tampa Bay Rays in
the American League East division and are seventh of the 15 AL
teams with a 3.80 earned run average.  Peavy, 32, a three-time All-Star, went 19-6 with a 2.54 ERA
for the San Diego Padres in 2007 to win the Cy Young Award as
the National League’s best pitcher. He is 8-4 this season for
the White Sox with a 4.28 ERA, and has a record of 128-97 in 12
major league seasons with the Padres and the White Sox, whom he
joined in 2009.  Iglesias, 23, an infielder, is hitting .330 in 62 games for
Boston this season. Garcia, 22, hit .319 for the Tigers last
year, including a .455 average in Detroit’s AL Championship
Series victory against the  New York  Yankees, and has slumped to
a .241 average in 30 games in 2013.  As part of the deal, Cherington said, the Red Sox also
received right-handed reliever Brayan Villarreal, 26, from the
Tigers and the White Sox got minor leaguers J.B. Wendelken and
Francelis Montas, both right-handed pitchers, and infielder
Cleuluis Rondon from Boston.  To contact the reporter on this story:
