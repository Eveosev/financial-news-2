Australian office vacancies surged to
the highest level in 14 years as subdued consumer and business
confidence weighed on demand for space.  The vacancy rate across  Australia ’s five biggest cities and
national capital Canberra climbed to 10.1 percent by July 1,
from 8.4 percent six months earlier, according to an e-mailed
report from industry group  Property Council of Australia . The
rate is the highest since July 1999, John Nguyen, national
research manager at the council, said by telephone.  Australia’s  unemployment rate  rose to 5.7 percent in June,
the highest since September 2009, government data showed, and
business hiring, sales and profits slumped to a four-year low, a
survey by National Australia Bank Ltd. taken from June 24 to 28
found. Prime Minister Kevin Rudd has repeatedly warned since
taking office last month that a slowing  China  could lead to a
recession in Australia.  “There is no surprise that weak office space demand
mirrors Australia’s lackluster economic fundamentals,” Property
Council Chief Executive Officer Peter Verwer said in the report.
“Stubbornly low business and  consumer confidence  is impeding
job growth and new investment, which translates into dwindling
demand for office space.”  Brisbane had the highest vacancy rate, at 12.8 percent, up
from 9.3 percent at the start of 2013, with take-up of space by
tenants the lowest on record, the council said. Canberra
recorded a slight increase to 12 percent, even though more space
was withdrawn than was added during the six months, the report
showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
