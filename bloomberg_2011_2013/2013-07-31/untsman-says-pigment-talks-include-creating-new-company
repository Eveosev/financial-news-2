Huntsman Corp. (HUN)  said talks about
consolidating the titanium-dioxide pigment industry include an
option to merge assets with a competitor’s and spin off the new
company to shareholders.  Huntsman, the fourth-biggest producer of the pigment known
by its chemical formula TiO2, said in April that it may divest
the unit that makes the commodity or acquire assets. Chief
Executive Officer Peter Huntsman said on a conference call today
that talks continue.  “When you look at a division that potentially could be
combined with somebody else and spun off, that would uniquely
fit TiO2 better than perhaps any of our other divisions, given
the number of people right now who are looking to sell, merge
buy, whatever in that industry,” Huntsman said in a phone
interview today.  DuPont Co., the world’s largest producer of TiO2, last week
became the fourth company to announce it was considering options
for its pigment assets.  Rockwood Holdings Inc. (ROC)  plans to sell or
spin off the unit that makes the commodity used to whiten paints
and plastics, while  Stamford , Connecticut-based  Tronox Ltd. (TROX)  said
in February it was interested in acquiring TiO2 assets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
