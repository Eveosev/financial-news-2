Shun Tak Holdings Ltd. (242) , the company
founded by gambling billionaire Stanley Ho, is planning to build
a hotel-to-office complex on an island next to Macau.  The Hong Kong-based company won a bid for a site in Hengqin
for 721 million yuan ($118 million), according to a statement to
the Hong Kong stock exchange. The site will be developed into an
office, hotel, service apartment and commercial project,
according to the statement.  China designated Hengqin as a tourism, business and
cultural zone, and a resort is under construction in the area,
Shun Tak said.  SJM Holdings Ltd. (880) , the casino company founded by
Stanley Ho, received final approval in May to build build a
casino resort in Macau’s Cotai area.  “The location and strategic value of this Hengqin project
naturally complement our existing hospitality business in
Macau,”  Pansy Ho , managing director of Shun Tak, said in a
separate statement.  The site will have direct access to port and commercial
facilities at the border between Hengqin and Macau and will be
located at a planned transportation hub, the company said. Site
works are expected to begin late this year, according to the
statement.  Galaxy Entertainment Group Ltd. (27)  have also expressed
interest in pursuing a non-gambling project in the area.  To contact the reporter on this story:
