Chile’s benchmark  IPSA (IPSA)  headed for
the biggest monthly loss among the world’s major stock indexes
amid tax concern and a tumble in the shares of fertilizer maker
Soc. Quimica y Minera de Chile SA.  The IPSA fell 0.2 percent to 3,742.15 at 2:49 p.m. in
Santiago and has retreated 7.1 percent in July, its biggest
monthly drop since September 2011. SQM dropped 4.9 percent today
to 14,962 pesos, extending its loss this month to 27 percent,
the biggest since the financial crisis in 2008. The MSCI
 Emerging Markets  Index has climbed 1 percent in July.  “SQM made the fall steeper,” German Guerrero, a partner
at brokerage MBI Inversiones, said in a phone interview from
Santiago. “Chile was already underperforming other emerging
markets in July on concern that the next government will
increase company taxes.”  SQM plunged 21 percent in two days as Russia’s OAO Uralkali
said it would leave a supply agreement that limited the
production of potash, a key fertilizer ingredient, and that
underpinned prices.  Former President  Michelle Bachelet , who is running on a
political platform that includes raising corporate taxes, won a
primary election on June 30 to become the main opposition bloc’s
presidential candidate. She is leading polls before the November
elections.  To contact the reporter on this story:
