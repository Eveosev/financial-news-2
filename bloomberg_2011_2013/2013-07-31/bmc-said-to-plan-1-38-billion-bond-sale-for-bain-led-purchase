BMC Software Inc. (BMC)  issued $1.63
billion of dollar-denominated debt after increasing the offering
by about 18 percent and reducing a planned loan package.  The information technology provider, which yesterday
scrapped plans for a 250 million-euro ($333 million) portion of
the sale, issued 8.125 percent, eight-year securities to yield
589 basis points more than similar-maturity Treasuries,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Proceeds will be used to help fund the company’s $6.9
billion buyout by a group led by Bain Capital LLC and Golden
Gate Capital. The cash will be placed in escrow until the
acquisition is completed, the company said in a July 31
statement. The bonds are graded Caa1 by Moody’s Investors
Service, the ratings company said in a statement.  The sale was earlier marketed at $1.38 billion, according
to a person with knowledge of the transaction who asked not to
be identified because the terms weren’t set.  BMC cut the amount of loans it’s seeking to about $3.9
billion from $4.5 billion, according to a person with knowledge
of that transaction. The largest loan, a $2.88 billion term
obligation that matures in May 2020, will pay the higher of 5
percent or 4 percentage points more than the London interbank
offering rate, a borrowing benchmark that was set at 27 basis
points today. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  The note offering is the largest high-yield issue globally
since Schaeffler AG sold $2 billion in dollars and euros on July
18, Bloomberg data show.  Credit Suisse Group AG, Royal Bank of Canada, Barclays Plc,
Deutsche Bank AG, Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Citigroup Inc.,
Jefferies Group LLC and Mizuho Financial Group Inc. managed the
offering for the Houston-based company, Bloomberg data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
