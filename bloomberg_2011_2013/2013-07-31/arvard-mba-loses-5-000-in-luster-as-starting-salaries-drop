An MBA from  Harvard Business School 
may have lost a bit of its shine -- about $5,000 worth.  The median salary for the school’s 2013 graduates dropped
by that amount compared with last year’s class, according to
preliminary career data published by the school. By graduation
in May, 15 percent of the class hadn’t received a job offer,
compared with 11 percent in 2012, said Christine Van Dae,
manager of market intelligence at the school.  Fewer students went into financial services, one of the
highest-paid industries for MBA graduates, which may have
contributed to the salary dip. Financial services firms hired 27
percent of the Harvard Class of 2013 by graduation, down from
final figures of 45 percent in 2008 and 35 percent in 2012.
Technology companies, meanwhile, picked up 18 percent of the
class by graduation, up from final figures of 7 percent in 2008
and 12 percent in 2012.  Wall Street, once considered the default destination for
many Harvard MBA graduates, has lost much of its appeal since
the financial crisis began in 2008. Layoffs, salary reductions
and hiring cuts have turned off many students. Tech companies
aren’t the only ones benefiting from this shift.  Consulting, which is the only other industry with salaries
comparable to those in financial services, also has seen an
increase in recent years. Twenty-five percent of the Harvard
Class of 2013 went into consulting, according to the preliminary
data, compared with 21 percent in 2008. The share of graduates
taking consulting jobs has hovered between 25 percent and 28
percent in the years since then, according to the final tallies.  More Confidence  Like many business schools, Cambridge, Massachusetts-based
Harvard polls students throughout the year, so the snapshot of
MBA job placement at graduation is likely to change over the
summer. Because of the improving economy, Van Dae said,
graduates had more confidence waiting for the right opportunity
rather than taking the first job that came along.  “We just don’t know what we’ll see with the final numbers
three months after graduation,” Van Dae said.  Industries that are paying the most lucrative salaries to
2013 Harvard grads include consulting and venture capital, both
with median salaries of $135,000, according to the preliminary
data. Graduates taking jobs at hedge funds had a median salary
of $138,000, while those headed into private equity reported a
median of $150,000.  Duke University’s Fuqua School of Business in Durham, North
Carolina, also recently released preliminary career data for its
Class of 2013, which showed that the bulk of graduates went into
consulting and financial services. While the  number of MBAs
receiving job offers by graduation had dropped, Fuqua grads saw
their median salary rise 2.5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
