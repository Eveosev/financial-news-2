Copper rebounded after dropping to
the lowest level in almost three weeks amid speculation that
 China ’s determination to stabilize growth will help boost demand.
Aluminum, lead, nickel and zinc also climbed.  Copper for delivery in three months gained as much as 1.3
percent to $6,824 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange and
was at $6,820 at 10:02 a.m. in  Shanghai . The price declined to
$6,721 yesterday, the lowest since July 10, and is heading for a
monthly advance.  China will maintain steady second-half growth amid
“extremely complicated domestic and international conditions,”
the official Xinhua News Agency reported yesterday after a
Politburo meeting led by President Xi Jinping. The government
will also promote stable and healthy  development  of the  property
market , without mentioning curbing speculative demand, according
to the report. The country is the world’s biggest copper user.  “A shift of China’s stance from pushing forward reform to
maintaining growth may have significant implications for copper
prices,” said Cheng Xiaoyong, an analyst at Baocheng Futures Co.  Copper for delivery in November was little changed at
48,950  yuan  ($7,986) a ton on the Shanghai Futures Exchange.
Metal for delivery in September climbed 0.8 percent to $3.0665 a
pound on the Comex.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
