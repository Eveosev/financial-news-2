Taylor Wimpey Plc (TW/) , the U.K.’s
second-largest homebuilder by volume, said first-half profit
rose 5.3 percent on demand for larger, more expensive homes.  Net income increased to 136.1 million pounds ($207 million)
from 129.2 million pounds a year earlier, the  High Wycombe ,
England-based company said today in a statement. Revenue
increased 11 percent to 1 billion pounds as the company
completed 5,191 homes compared with 5,083 a year earlier.  Like most of its U.K. competitors, Taylor Wimpey has
boosted margins by focusing on homes rather than apartments and
by building on land bought cheaply after the financial crisis.
The company’s operating profit margin widened by 2 percentage
points to 13.1 percent from a year earlier as the company sold
more family-sized homes, Chief Executive Officer Pete Redfern
said by telephone.  “The average square footage of our product has increased
about 4 percent, now that’s a very large shift,” he said.
“We’ve not seen a shift of that scale at any point in the 13
years I’ve been in the business.”  Taylor Wimpey advanced as much as 2.5 percent in London
trading, giving the company a market value of 3.47 billion
pounds. The stock was up 0.9 percent at 107.2 pence as of 9 a.m.
Taylor Wimpey climbed 63 percent this year, the second-best
performance after  Persimmon Plc (PSN)  among companies on the Bloomberg
EMEA Homebuilders index.  The government’s Help to Buy program to assist homebuyers
resulted in 235 sales during the period, Redfern said. The
company said it has made 1,300 reservations through Help to Buy
since the program started in April.  To contact the reporters on this story:
