Italy’s unemployment rate stayed
near a record high in June as companies remain reluctant to hire
amid the country’s recession.  Joblessness (ITMUURS)  dropped to 12.1 percent from 12.2 percent in
May, which was the highest since the data series began in the
first quarter of 1977, the Rome-based national statistics office
Istat said in a preliminary report today. The June rate was
lower than the 12.3 percent median of nine estimates in a
Bloomberg News survey. Unemployment remained above 10 percent
for a 17th month.  Last month, Prime Minister Enrico Letta’s Cabinet approved
tax breaks for companies that offer permanent job contracts to
young workers or convert temporary contracts into open-ended
ones. Letta has said the government plans to pass a second
package of measures for youth employment later this year.  The unemployment rate for people between the age of 15 and
24 rose to 39.1 percent in June, Istat said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
