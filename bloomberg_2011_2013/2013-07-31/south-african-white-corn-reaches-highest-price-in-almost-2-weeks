South African white corn rose to the
highest level in almost two weeks amid increased concern about
stockpiles of the grain, a trader said.  “There are more and more concerns over white-corn
stocks,” Brink van Wyk, a trader from BVG (Pty) Ltd., said by
phone in  Pretoria .  White corn for delivery in December, the most active
contract, gained 0.8 percent to 2,374 rand ($241) a metric ton,
the highest since July 18, by the close on the South African
Futures Exchange in Johannesburg. The yellow variety for
delivery in September was little changed at 2,140 rand a ton.  South Africa  will probably produce 5.75 million tons of
white corn this season, according to a prediction made by the
 Crop Estimates Committee  on July 25. That would be 2.4 percent
less than the panel’s 5.9 million-ton forecast in June.  Exports of white corn were 42,227 tons in the week to July
26, the highest in 10 weeks, Pretoria-based South African Grain
Information Service said on its website.  “There is a concern with the crop size plus more possible
exports,” Van Wyk said.  South Africa is the continent’s biggest corn producer. A
meal made from the white variety is a staple food in the
country, while yellow corn is mainly used as  animal feed .  Wheat for delivery in December gained 0.2 percent to 3,305
rand a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
