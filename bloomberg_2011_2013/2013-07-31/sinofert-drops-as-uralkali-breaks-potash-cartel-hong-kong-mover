Sinofert Holdings Ltd. (297) , a potash
distributor, fell to the lowest in a year in Hong Kong after
OAO Uralkali broke from a group that controlled about 40 percent
of world exports, potentially weakening prices.  Beijing-based Sinofert, which got 24 percent of its  sales 
last year from potash fertilizers, slumped 6.9 percent to
HK$1.22 at 11:05 a.m. in Hong Kong, the lowest since July 4,
2012. The benchmark  Hang Seng  index rose 0.3 percent.  Uralkali, the largest producer, said yesterday it will no
longer sell the crop nutrient through Belarusian Potash Co.
Shares of Uralkali and its competitors including Saskatoon,
Canada-based Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc., which owns 22
percent of Sinofert, tumbled after the announcement.  “Sinofert is one of two potash distributors for Belarusian
Potash Co. in  China ,” Citigroup Inc. analysts Oscar Yee and
Horace Chan said in a report. “We expect Sinofert to lose
potash market share in China given its focus on sea-bourne trade
but limited exposure in rail shipment from  Russia .”  Uralkali, based in Berezniki, Russia, sees global potash
prices falling below $300 a metric ton, Chief Executive Officer
Vladislav Baumgertner said. The last accord Belarusian Potash
signed, for sales into China, was agreed at $400 a ton. That’s
one of three price agreements whose terms were published in
2013, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Sinofert is likely to book an inventory loss in the second
half due to potential decline in potash prices, Citigroup said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
