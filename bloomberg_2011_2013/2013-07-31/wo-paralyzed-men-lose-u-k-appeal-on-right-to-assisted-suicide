Two paralyzed men lost their appeal
to legally seek assistance to end their lives, a U.K. court
ruled today in a right-to-die case.  Paul Lamb and another man, only identified as Martin,
suffer from locked-in syndrome, meaning that while they can’t
speak or control their muscles, they are mentally lucid. The men
sought a court declaration that anyone who helped them commit
suicide wouldn’t be prosecuted.  A third man, Tony Nicklinson, who was part of the appeal
died in August 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
