Ibovespa  futures  fell, a sign the
stock gauge may pare a monthly gain, as faster-than-forecast
U.S. growth fueled speculation that the Federal Reserve may pare
stimulus that has boosted demand for emerging-market assets.  Brewer  Cia. de Bebidas das Americas  may move after posting
second-quarter earnings that missed analysts’ estimates. Real
estate company  Tecnisa SA (TCSA3)  may be active after reporting a profit
that was more than analysts had forecast for the April-to-June
period.  Ibovespa futures contracts expiring in August lost 0.4
percent to 48,220 at 9:42 a.m. in Sao Paulo. The equity index is
up 2.3 percent this month. The real slid 0.5 percent to 2.2950
per dollar.  U.S. index futures fell after a report from the Commerce
Department showed the country’s gross domestic product rose at a
1.7 percent annualized rate in the second quarter, after a 1.1
percent gain the prior quarter. The median forecast of 85
economists surveyed by Bloomberg called for a 1 percent advance
for last quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
