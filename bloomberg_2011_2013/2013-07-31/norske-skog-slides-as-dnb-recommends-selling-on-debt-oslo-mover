Norske Skogindustrier ASA (NSG)  dropped in
Oslo trading after DNB ASA advised investors to sell shares in
Europe’s third-largest newsprint maker as a frail balance sheet
and weak paper market curb the company’s ability to repay debt.  Shares in Norske Skog, based in Lysaker near Oslo, fell as
much as 4.3 percent, the  most in more than a week , and traded 3
percent lower at 3.80 kroner as of 10:45 a.m. in the Norwegian
capital. About 840,000 shares have been traded so far today, 90
percent of the average daily volume in the last three months.  Norske Skog, grappling with 6.64 billion kroner ($1.1
billion) of debt, is trying to strengthen its balance sheet amid
excess supply in the newsprint market, competition from online
media and rising raw-material costs. The company has sold
assets, including its 51 percent stake in the Pisa mill in
 Brazil  last month, to raise funds and reduce expenditure.  “Based on its stretched balance sheet, pure exposure to a
weak paper market and lack of earnings diversification, the
financing of its 2015 bond maturities looks increasingly
challenging in the absence of sustained price increases,” DNB
analysts Alexander Tallberg and Sampsa Karhunen said in a note
today. “We initiate coverage of Norske Skog with a sell
recommendation” and a 3 kroner price target, they wrote.  Norske Skog, which has assets in Europe, Asia and South
America, has 1.72 billion kroner of current and non-interest
bearing debt maturing before the end of 2014, including 888
million kroner of bonds, according to its second-quarter report.  Debt Burden  It then has another 1 billion kroner of debt due in 2015,
including a $158 million bond, the report shows.  While recent asset sales and the possibility of more are
supportive for the company’s 2014 bonds, “2015 is our main
concern,” DNB said. “In the absence of sustained improved
pricing, we believe it will be challenging for the company to
fulfill its fourth quarter 2015  maturities  without significant
restructuring or divestments.”  Yields on the papermaker’s 6.125 percent 2015 bond rose
eight basis points to 25.78 percent today, according to prices
compiled by Bloomberg. Shares in the company have slumped 98
percent since trading at a high of 158.806 kroner on March 11,
2002.  To contact the reporter on this story:
