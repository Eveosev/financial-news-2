Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) , the world’s largest
online retailer, will produce pilot episodes for five kids’
television shows, strengthening its programming for families.  Amazon will decide which of the pilots to expand into full-series production based on feedback from customers who watch the
videos online, according to a statement today. The Seattle-based
company debuted samples of eight comedy shows and six kids’
programs in April.  The new shows bolster Amazon’s lineup of original content
as it challenges competitors such as Hulu LLC and  Netflix Inc. (NFLX) ,
the world’s largest subscription video service. Netflix has also
funded original programs such as the political thriller “House
of Cards.”  “For the first time we are offering live-action and
animated programming for older children and continuing with
entertaining, educational, programming for preschool aged
children,” Roy Price, director of Amazon Studios, said in a
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
