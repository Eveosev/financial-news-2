Visa Inc. (V) , the world’s biggest
payment network, fell the most in two years after a judge ruled
that the Federal Reserve had erred by inflating the debit-card
fees that banks can charge retailers.  Visa fell as much as 11 percent in New York trading before
dropping 5.9 percent to $180.15 at 12:43 p.m., the most since
August 2011. Swipe, or interchange fees, are set by  Foster City ,
California-based Visa and  MasterCard (MA)  Inc., which collect the
money and remit it to card-issuing member banks.  U.S. District Court Judge Richard Leon in Washington ruled
today that the Fed considered data it wasn’t allowed to use in
setting a 21-cent cap on debit-card fees under the Dodd-Frank
Act of 2010. The decision handed a victory to retailers who
challenged the fees as being too high.  MasterCard, the second-biggest U.S. network, slid as much
as 5.7 percent before falling 0.2 percent to $600.38.  To contact the reporter on this story:
