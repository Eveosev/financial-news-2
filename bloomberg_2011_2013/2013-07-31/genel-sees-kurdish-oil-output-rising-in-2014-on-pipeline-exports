Genel Energy Plc (GENL) , the largest oil
producer in  Iraq ’s Kurdistan region, expects output to rise once
a pipeline to  Turkey  becomes available in the fourth quarter.  “There will be a substantial increase in production next
year,” Chief Financial Officer Julian Metherell said today in
an interview, without giving a specific forecast. “The pipeline
is currently 15 kilometers short of the tie-in. We’re confident
that we’ll have export capability through it, and that will
allow us to utilize our capacity.”  The London-listed company run by former  BP Plc (BP/)  Chief
Executive Officer  Tony Hayward , which has capacity to pump
80,000 barrels a day, is seeking to export its crude by pipeline
to cut transportation costs. Genel has been sending cargoes to
Turkey by truck since Iraq’s northern Kurdistan region halted
exports through a central government-run pipeline in December.  Genel climbed as much as 2.3 percent to 961 pence in London
trading, and was at 950.5 pence as of 9:51 a.m. local time.  The company, which pumped 41,500 barrels a day in the first
half, sends as much as 40,000 barrels a day to Turkey, where it
sells for $75 a barrel after transportation costs. Genel’s two
biggest producing fields, Tawke and Taq Taq, may both have
capacity of 200,000 barrels a day by the end of 2014, Metherall
said. Genel owns 44 percent of Taq Taq and 25 percent of Tawke.  Kurdish Pipelines  The Kurds, sparring with the Oil Ministry in  Baghdad  over
the sharing of revenue from crude sales and payments owed to
international producers, have started building their own
pipelines to neighboring Turkey as a step toward economic self-sufficiency.  Genel today raised estimates for its gas reserves at the
Miran and Bina Bawi fields to 8 trillion cubic feet to 14
trillion cubic feet. The company is looking to sell a portion of
Miran, where it holds a 100 percent interest, and negotiate
deals to sell the gas in Turkey.  Genel has also added 500 million barrels of contingent
resources through exploration this year, and is targeting
another 500 million barrels with new wells at Taq Taq and off
 Morocco  later this year.  The company’s output will rise to 45,000 barrels to 55,000
barrels of oil equivalent a day this year from 44,500 barrels in
2012, generating revenue of $300 million to $400 million, it
said today.  Genel’s revenue rose to $160.6 million in the first six
months of 2013 from $123.1 million a year earlier. It has $867.1
million in cash on its balance sheet.  Investors including Hayward and financier  Nathaniel Rothschild  bought Genel, a Turkish company, in 2011 with more
than $2 billion raised through an investment vehicle in an
initial public offering. It will consider returning cash to
investors next year, Metherell said today.  If the company exports via pipeline for higher selling
prices, and if it can take on debt and sell an interest in its
Miran gas discovery, “there may be some scope for capital
return,” Metherell said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
