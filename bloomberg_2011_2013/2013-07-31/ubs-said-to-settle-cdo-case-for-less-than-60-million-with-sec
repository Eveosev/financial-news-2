UBS AG (UBSN) , Switzerland’s largest bank,
is poised to settle U.S. regulatory claims that it misled
investors in a 2007 mortgage-bond deal that soured as housing
prices collapsed, a person familiar with the matter said.  The bank will pay less than $60 million in a deal with the
Securities and Exchange Commission, said the person, who asked
not to be named because the matter isn’t public. None of UBS’s
executives will be targeted, the person said.  Zurich-based UBS is seeking to wrap up legal claims left
over from the U.S. housing slump. The bank posted preliminary
earnings last week that beat analysts’ estimates, even as it
booked charges tied to an $885 million settlement with the U.S.
Federal Housing Finance Agency. That case focused on claims that
the lender improperly sold mortgage-backed securities to U.S.-
backed financiers  Fannie Mae (FNMA)  and  Freddie Mac (FMCC)  during the housing
bubble.  The case follows a string of cases involving collateralized
debt obligations beginning with the SEC’s lawsuit against
 Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  in 2010. Fabrice Tourre, a Goldman
Sachs executive who worked on the deal known as Abacus, is
awaiting a jury verdict over the SEC’s fraud claims against him.  Florence Harmon, an SEC spokeswoman, and  Karina Byrne , a
spokeswoman for UBS in New York, declined to comment.  The settlement was reported earlier today by the Wall
Street Journal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
