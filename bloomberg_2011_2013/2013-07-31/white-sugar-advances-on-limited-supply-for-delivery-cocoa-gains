Refined sugar climbed for a fifth
day in  London , the longest winning streak in more than four
months, on concern supplies that can be delivered when the
October futures expire will be limited. Cocoa advanced.  White, or refined, sugar, for October delivery was $10.30 a
metric ton more expensive than the futures for December, NYSE
Liffe data on Bloomberg showed. That is up from $2.50 a ton at
the end of last month. The market structure in which earlier
contracts cost more than later ones is known as backwardation
and may signal limited supplies. The white  sugar premium  over
the raw variety traded in New York rose 5.3 percent this month,
also signaling smaller supplies of the refined type.  “The white premium is firm and so is the October/December
spread,” Fabienne Pointier, an analyst at Lausanne,
Switzerland-based researcher Kingsman SA, said by e-mail today.
“At the moment, I don’t see much deliverable white sugar around
for the October expiry. The Thais are still not selling and
Brazilian millers are not focusing on refined. We also see
demand in importing countries.”  White sugar for October delivery was 0.2 percent higher at
$490.10 a ton by 11:24 a.m. on NYSE Liffe in London. Raw sugar
for delivery in October slid 0.2 percent to 16.90 cents a pound
on ICE in  New York . Prices touched 16.94 cents a pound.  Sugar supplies will outpace demand by 3.5 million tons in
the 2013-14 season starting in October, according to the London-based  International Sugar Organization  in London. That follows a
record surplus of 10 million tons in 2012-13. While raw sugar
prices were little changed this month, white sugar gained 1.1
percent. White sugar has also fared better this year, sliding
6.4 percent while raw futures tumbled 13 percent.  “London has been the leader for the recent surge in sugar
prices,” Sterling Smith, a futures specialist at Citigroup in
 Chicago , said in a report e-mailed yesterday.  Robusta coffee for delivery in September declined 0.2
percent to $1,872 a ton on NYSE Liffe. Arabica coffee for
delivery in September fell 0.5 percent to $1.1975 a pound on
ICE.  Cocoa for September delivery was up 0.5 percent at 1,555
pounds ($2,365) a ton in London. Cocoa for September delivery
gained 0.5 percent to $2,298 a ton in New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
