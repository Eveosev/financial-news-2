Desarrolladora Homex SAB (HOMEX*) , Mexico’s
biggest homebuilder by 2012 revenue, rebounded from a record low
after a government minister pledged support for the country’s
developers.  The shares surged 29 percent to 3.68 pesos at 1:10 p.m. in
Mexico City. The Culiacan, Mexico-based company plunged 57
percent in the prior three days, the most among 2,588 securities
on the Bloomberg World Index with average daily trading volume
of at least 1 million shares.  Mexico’s largest homebuilders, which also include Corp. Geo
SAB and Urbi Desarrollos Urbanos SAB, have hired advisers to
help restructure debt accumulated while buying up properties
that have since lost value because of shifts in government
housing policies. The homebuilders “have all the support” of
the government, Carlos Ramirez Marin, the minister for urban and
agrarian territorial development, told reporters in  Mexico  City.
They are “very important for the country,” he said.  Today’s rally is driven by “the pure speculation that the
government is going to intervene to not leave the homebuilding
sector bankrupt,” Aldo Miranda, a trader at Intercam Casa de
Bolsa SA in Mexico City, said in an e-mailed response to
questions. “I think it’s very risky for your investment to
depend on whether the government intervenes or not.”  The shares of Corp. Geo SAB and Urbi Desarrollos Urbanos
SAB were suspended from trading after they failed to meet the
Mexican stock exchange’s deadline last week for reporting
second-quarter results.  To contact the reporter on this story:
