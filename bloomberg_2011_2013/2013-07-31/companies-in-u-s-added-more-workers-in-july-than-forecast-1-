Companies in the U.S. boosted
payrolls in July by the most this year as employers grew more
optimistic demand will pick up in the second half of the year.  The 200,000 increase in employment was more than projected
and followed a revised 198,000 gain in June that was higher than
initially estimated, according to data today from the ADP
Research Institute in Roseland,  New Jersey . The median forecast
of 40 economists surveyed by Bloomberg called for a July advance
of 180,000.  Job gains, higher stock prices and rising home values are
shoring up Americans’ confidence, helping counter the effects of
this year’s government spending cuts and giving a boost to U.S.
growth. Federal Reserve policy makers, wrapping up a two-day
meeting today, are evaluating progress on growth and employment
as they consider whether to trim their record monetary stimulus.  “The job market has admirably weathered the fiscal
headwinds, tax increases and government spending cuts,”  Mark Zandi , chief economist at Moody’s Analytics Inc., in  West
Chester ,  Pennsylvania , said in a statement. Moody’s produces the
figures with ADP. “This bodes well for the next year when those
headwinds are set to fade.”  Stock-index futures fluctuated as investors awaited the
Fed’s policy announcement. The contract on the Standard & Poor’s
500 Index expiring in September was little changed at 1,684.7 at
8:28 a.m. in  New York .  Estimates in the Bloomberg survey ranged from gains of
140,000 to 215,000. June’s figure was revised from a previously
reported increase of 188,000.  Service Employment  Manufacturers, construction companies and other goods-producing industries increased payrolls by 22,000. Construction
employment grew by 22,000 and factory payrolls decreased by
5,000, today’s report showed. Payrolls at service providers
climbed by 177,000.  Companies employing 500 or more workers added 57,000 jobs.
Employment at businesses with 50 to 499 employees increased
60,000 and the smallest companies boosted payrolls by 82,000,
the report showed.  ADP in October changed the method it uses to calculate its
employment figures dating back to 2001. The report now is
derived from a larger sample and is released jointly with
Moody’s Analytics.  The Labor Department may report on Aug. 2 that private
payrolls, excluding government jobs, climbed 195,000 in July
after a 202,000 increase a month earlier, according to the
Bloomberg survey median. The jobless rate fell to 7.5 percent,
matching a four-year low, from 7.6 percent in June, economists
projected.  To contact the reporter on this story:
