  British American Tobacco Plc (BATS) ,
Europe’s largest cigarette maker, said first-half operating
profit rose 4 percent as higher prices offset falling
consumption.  Adjusted profit from operations increased to 2.94 billion
pounds ($4.5 billion), the London-based company said in a
statement today. That compares with the 2.95 billion-pound
estimate of nine analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Sales growth,
excluding currency shifts, was 4 percent. Chief Operating
Officer  John Daly  will step down, the company also said.  “The business is performing well, and we are confident of
another year of good earnings growth,” Chairman Richard Burrows
said in the statement.  The maker of Lucky Strike and Pall Mall cigarettes is
stepping up the development of alternative nicotine products
amid stricter government constraints on smoking. It started
selling its own electronic cigarette Vype online in the U.K.
yesterday and is waiting for approval for another alternative
product that may be introduced on the market as soon as next
year.  BAT is “the leader in the reduced risk area, given all the
R&D it has carried out over the years,”  Erik Bloomquist , an
analyst at Berenberg Bank in  London , said by e-mail. “Vype is
recognition that the market place is evolving quickly and shows
they are willing to meet consumer needs with a variety of
products.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
