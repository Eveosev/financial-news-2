Ineos Group Holdings Ltd., a U.K.-
based chemicals and biofuels producer, is making ethanol in
commercial volumes from plant waste at its Florida facility.  The company will deliver next month its first commercial
shipment of cellulosic ethanol from the  Indian River BioEnergy
Center , the Lyndhurst, England-based company said today in a
statement.  The facility has an annual production capacity of about 8
million gallons (30 million liters) and next year will also
begin producing fuel from solid municipal waste.  “The ability to divert waste materials from communities by
converting them into competitively priced renewable fuel and
power offers an excellent value proposition,” Peter Williams,
chief executive officer of the company’s Ineos Bio unit, said in
the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
