Las Vegas Sands Corp. lost a bid to
set aside a $101.6 million jury award to Richard Suen, a Hong
Kong businessman who claimed he helped the casino operator
obtain a gaming license in Macau.  Clark County District Judge Rob Bare at a hearing yesterday
in Las Vegas denied the request by Sands to enter judgment in
its favor. The judge also rejected the alternative of ordering a
new trial or cutting the jury award.  “What he said was, ‘Hey, if you get me the license, it is
worth it,’” the judge said, referring to testimony by Sands
Chairman and majority owner  Sheldon Adelson  during the trial, as
he denied the casino operator’s request to lower the award.  Adelson, 79, testified that Suen, a friend of his younger
brother Lenny Adelson, had contributed nothing to helping  Sands
get a concession in Macau in 2002. The Nevada jury in May
awarded Suen $70 million in damages, to which Bare added $31.6
million in pre-judgment interest.  “Nothing has changed,” Ron Reese, a spokesman for Sands,
said yesterday in an e-mail. “We will absolutely appeal.”  “We are very pleased that Judge Bare denied all the
motions made by the Sands,” John O’Malley, a lawyer for Suen,
said after the hearing. “We expect Las Vegas Sands to appeal
and we will defend the verdict.”  The case is Suen v.  Las Vegas Sands Corp. (LVS) , 04A493744,
Nevada District Court, Clark County (Las Vegas).  To contact the reporter on this story:
