ICICI Bank Ltd. (ICICIBC) ,  India ’s second-largest lender by assets, posted a 25 percent increase in first-quarter profit due to gains from stock and bond holdings.  Net income  climbed to 22.7 billion rupees ($372 million),
or 19.61 rupees a share, in the three months ended June 30, from
18.2 billion rupees, or 15.71 rupees, a year earlier, the
Mumbai-based lender said in an exchange filing today. That
matched the 22.2 billion-rupee median of 40 analyst estimates
compiled by Bloomberg.  Shares of ICICI fell 3.1 percent today as investors’
concern that widening currency swings will hurt  India’s economy 
overshadowed the profit gain. Chief Executive Officer  Chanda Kochhar ’s 20 percent target for credit growth this year may also
be hampered by the Reserve Bank of India’s decision to increase
borrowing costs and an economic slowdown.  “Treasury gains and a check on bad loans were the drivers
for June quarter profit,” Vishal Narnolia, a Mumbai-based
banking analyst at SMC  Global Securities Ltd. (GLBS) , said by
telephone. “Investors are waiting for clarity on how the lender
will navigate the rising cost of funds and cash crunch after the
Reserve Bank’s recent tightening measures.”  India’s economy expanded 5 percent in three months to June
30, according to the median of 14 analyst estimates compiled by
Bloomberg. The South Asian nation’s gross domestic product may
grow 5.7 percent in the year through March 2014, based on a
survey of forecasts from other organizations, the RBI said in a
report on July 29.  Higher Borrowing Costs  The  Reserve Bank , which cut the benchmark repurchase rate
three times this year, started tightening policy to halt a slide
in the rupee, which plunged to a record low of 61.2125 a dollar
on July 8.  The RBI boosted the  bank rate  and the marginal standing
facility, two benchmarks for its provision of funds to lenders,
to 10.25 percent from 8.25 percent on July 15, and last week
capped its funding support and increased banks’ daily cash
reserve requirements.  “A tight monetary stance could heighten risks in the
system,” Santosh Singh, an analyst at Espirito Santo Securities
Ltd., said in a July 29 note. “If  interest rates  were to rise
and financial-sector companies were to pass on the costs, we may
see a non-performing loan spurt.”  Shares of ICICI fell 3.1 percent to 896.95 rupees as of
1:34 p.m. in Mumbai trading. The stock has slumped 21 percent
this year, keeping pace with the Bankex Index’s drop.  Treasury Gains  The lender posted treasury income of 4 billion rupees for
the three months to June 30, compared with a loss of 210 million
rupees a year earlier, ICICI said.  The net interest margin, a measure of lending
profitability, widened to 3.27 percent from 3.01 percent a year
earlier. Net interest income, or revenue from lending minus
payments on deposits, rose 20 percent to 38.2 billion rupees.  The bank’s gross bad-loan ratio shrank to 3.23 percent from
3.54 percent a year earlier, according to the  statement .  Bad loans at Indian lenders swelled to 3.7 percent of total
loans as of Dec. 31, the highest in at least five years, before
narrowing to 3.4 percent at the end of March, data compiled by
the central bank show. The ratio may increase to 3.8 percent by
September, the RBI said in a  report  last month.  Total outstanding loans at ICICI increased by 12 percent to
3 trillion rupees at the end of June. Loan growth at Indian
lenders slowed to 13.7 percent in June, the lowest since 2009,
before accelerating to 14.2 percent in July,  data  compiled by
the RBI shows.  The bank’s ability to charge more for international lending
in line with rising U.S. treasury rates will help sustain profit
growth, Hatim Broachwala, a Mumbai-based banking analyst at
Karvy Stock Broking Ltd., said by telephone before the earnings
were announced. Lending by overseas branches comprise more than
one-fourth of ICICI’s total advances.  To contact the reporter on this story:
