Yelp Inc. (YELP)  reported second-quarter
revenue that topped analysts’ estimates as more local businesses
opted to pay for advertising on its consumer-review website. The
shares jumped as much as 12 percent in late trading.  Sales climbed 69 percent to $55 million, the San Francisco-based company said today in a statement, exceeding the $53.3
million average analyst prediction compiled by Bloomberg. The
net loss narrowed to $878,000, or 1 cent a share, from a loss of
$2 million, or 3 cents, a year earlier. Analysts on average had
projected a loss of 4 cents in the recent quarter.  Chief Executive Officer  Jeremy Stoppelman  is banking on
partnerships with companies such as reservation site  OpenTable
Inc. (OPEN) , food-delivery site Eat24 Hours LLC and iPhone maker  Apple
Inc. (AAPL)  to get consumers spending more time on Yelp. Increasing
user engagement can help the company attract more advertising
from local businesses, which jumped 77 percent to $44.8 million
-- or 81 percent of total revenue -- in the second quarter.  “We’re increasingly positive on Yelp’s efforts to close
the loop and drive transactions on the site,” Kaizad Gotla, an
analyst at JPMorgan Chase & Co. in New York, wrote in a report
yesterday. He has a neutral rating on Yelp.  Yelp shares climbed as high as $46.87 in extended trading
after the report. They had gained less than 1 percent to $41.80
at the close in  New York  and have more than doubled so far this
year.  Higher Forecast  Third-quarter revenue will be $58 million to $59 million,
the company said. That compares with the average analyst
projection of $57.4 million, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Annual sales will be $222 million to $224 million,
compared with an average  estimate  of $219.8 million.  Total reviews on Yelp’s sites, where consumers rate and
comment on local businesses such as coffee shops, hair salons,
pet shops and plumbers, increased 41 percent in the second
quarter to more than 42.5 million, while average monthly unique
visitors grew 38 percent from a year earlier to about 108
million, Yelp said.  The company expanded search ads to its mobile application
in the fourth quarter and added display ads in the first three
months of 2013. About 59 percent of Yelp searches originated on
mobile, including its app and through the Web on wireless
devices, in the second quarter, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
