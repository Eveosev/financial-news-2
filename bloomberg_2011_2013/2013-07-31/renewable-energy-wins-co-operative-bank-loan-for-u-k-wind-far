Renewable Energy Generation Ltd. (WIND) , a
Jersey-based clean power developer, won a 4.2 million-pound
($6.4 million) loan from the Co-Operative Bank Plc for a wind
farm in northern England.  The 10-year project-finance loan with a 6.075 percent rate
will fund the Orchard End plant in Lancashire, the company said
today in a statement outlining completion of its financing.  REG plans to sell the 4-megawatt venture to New York-based
asset manager  BlackRock Inc. (BLK)  later this year, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
