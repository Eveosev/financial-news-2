Detroit  property owners can file tax
appeals against the city during its bankruptcy, a federal judge
ruled, while barring them from collecting refunds.  Michigan  Property Tax Relief LLC this week asked the judge
overseeing Detroit’s $18 billion bankruptcy to let its clients
pursue their claims. The company said they have been blocked by
the Michigan Tax Tribunal from challenging tax bills because of
the bankruptcy.  Lawsuits and other legal actions against Detroit were
automatically halted when the city filed the biggest U.S.
municipal bankruptcy on July 18. U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Steven Rhodes today permitted property owners to “take all steps
necessary to file property tax appeals.”  The company and its clients, however, “shall not take any
action to prosecute the appeals or collect any refund of any
pre-petition property tax overpayment absent further order of
this court,” Rhodes said in an order.  The case is City of Detroit, 13-bk-53846,  U.S. Bankruptcy
Court , Eastern District of Michigan (Detroit).  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
