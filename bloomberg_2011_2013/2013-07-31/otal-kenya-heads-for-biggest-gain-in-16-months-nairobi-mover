Total Kenya Ltd., the unit of
 Europe ’s third-largest oil company, made its biggest gain in
almost four months after Standard Investment Bank Ltd. raised
its recommendation on the stock to a buy from sell.  The shares added 5.3 percent to 15.85 shillings by the
close in the capital, Nairobi, the most since April 3. About 4.6
times the three-month daily average of shares were traded.  Standard Investment Bank upgraded its target price on the
stock to 37.68 shillings from 15.30 shillings, analyst Eric Musau said in a note e-mailed after the Kenyan market closed
yesterday.  “While Total Kenya posted a loss for financial year 2011
and financial year 2012, we see a strong recovery in 2013,” he
said. Standard Investment Bank boosted their prediction for
revenue by 12 percent to 119.1 billion shillings ($1.4 billion),
Musau said.  Total  Kenya ’s shares gained 14 percent this year, while the
FTSE NSE Kenya 25 Index rallied 27 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
