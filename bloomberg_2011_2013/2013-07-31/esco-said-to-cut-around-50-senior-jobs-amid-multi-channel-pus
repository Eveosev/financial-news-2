Tesco Plc (TSCO)  plans to cut around 50
senior management positions as part of its push to inject more
digital and multi-channel skills into the struggling grocer, a
person familiar with the matter said.  The senior management members are just below board or
executive-board level, the person said. The exits at  Europe ’s
largest grocer will be across all departments at the Cheshunt,
England-based head office including marketing, the person said.  Tom Hoskin, a spokesman for Tesco, declined to comment.
Retail Week earlier reported on the company’s intentions.  Chief Executive Officer  Philip Clarke  has vowed to turn the
retailer into a business with multiple selling platforms as part
of his 1 billion-pound ($1.5 billion) turnaround plan. This
year, he has hired former Amazon executive Robin Terrell as
multi-channel director and promoted Blinkbox founder Michael
Comish as the group digital officer. Tesco reported a 1 percent
drop in U.K. same-store sales in June, the weakest performance
in a year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
