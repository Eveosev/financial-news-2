Hog futures rose for the first time
in a week on signs of increasing demand for U.S. pork. Cattle
prices were little changed.  Meatpackers are probably earning $10 to $12 per hog
slaughtered, according to Northstar Commodity Investment Co.
About 376,000 of the animals were processed in the week ended
July 27 in the  Iowa  and southern Minnesota region, up 5.6
percent from a year earlier, U.S. Department of Agriculture data
show. Wholesale  pork  rose 1.2 percent to $1.0121 a pound
yesterday, the highest since July 12, USDA data show. Futures
lost 4 percent in the previous four sessions.  “Packer margins get back in the black a little bit,” Mark Schultz, a chief analyst at Northstar Commodity Investment Co.,
said in a telephone interview from  Minneapolis . “Bottom line is
you still have a market that’s been down hard and probably gets
a little bit of a bounce.”  Hog futures for October settlement climbed 0.6 percent to
83.725 cents a pound at 10:36 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange. The commodity declined 2.9 percent this year through
yesterday.  Cattle futures for October delivery fell 0.1 percent to
$1.2555 a pound on the CME, after fluctuating between gains and
losses. Prices were down 5 percent this year through yesterday.
Feeder-cattle futures for August settlement added 0.1 percent to
$1.5345 a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
