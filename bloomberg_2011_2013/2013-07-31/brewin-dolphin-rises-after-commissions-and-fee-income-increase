Brewin Dolphin Holdings Plc (BRW) , a U.K.
stockbroker and fund manager, climbed as much as 6 percent in
London trading as rising fee income offset the effect of a ban
on commissions paid by fund managers.  Total income rose 14 percent to 73.3 million pounds ($111.5
million) in the third quarter to June 30, up from 64.5 million
pounds a year earlier, the London-based company said in a
statement today. Core fee and commission income was 27 percent
higher than the same period last year, while “trail income”
fell after the implementation of the Retail Distribution Review.  Brewin repeated that it expects operating margins to
surpass 25 percent by 2016. Former Morgan Stanley executive
David Nicol became Brewin’s chief executive officer in March
after the resignation of executive chairman Jamie Matheson, who
began a review aimed at improving profitability near the end of
his eight-year tenure as executive chairman. Brokers have been
charging more up-front fees to clients in the wake of the retail
distribution review.  “It will be difficult for management to retain their jobs
post-2016 should they not achieve these now well-defined
targets, so we believe they are well-incentivized,” David McCann, an analyst at Numis Securities Ltd. with an add rating
on the shares, wrote in an e-mailed note.  Total income beat Numis’s estimate of 70 million pounds,
probably because trail income is dropping off less quickly than
expected, McCann wrote. Funds under management declined 2.1
percent to 27.5 billion pounds, below Numis’s 27.6 billion-pound
estimate.  Brewin Dolphin  shares  were up 2.6 percent to 250.70 pence
