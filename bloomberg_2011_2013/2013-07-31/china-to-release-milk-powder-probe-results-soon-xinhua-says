China completed an anti-monopoly
probe into several milk powder companies and will release the
results soon, the official Xinhua  News Agency  reported, citing
the National Development and Reform Commission.  The baby formula companies being investigated had set a
minimum price on milk powder, which led to high prices, the
state-run news agency said on its microblog today, citing Xu
Kunlin, head of the NDRC’s pricing supervision department.  Milk powder companies  Danone (BN)  to Mead Johnson Nutrition Co.
were part of five named on July 2 by the NDRC, China’s top
economic planning agency, for possibly violating anti-monopoly
laws and setting prices too high. The agency said in a People’s
Daily report that it had evidence to show their pricing
increased about 30 percent since 2008, the same year milk powder
contaminated with melamine killed six infants.  Other producers named included  Nestle SA (NESN) ’s Wyeth brand,
 Abbott Laboratories (ABT) , Dutch producer Royal FrieslandCampina NV,
and local firm  Biostime International Holdings Ltd. (1112) , the
People’s Daily reported. Within days, Danone and Nestle SA
reduced some prices by as much as 20 percent. Mead Johnson, the
country’s largest infant formula seller, announced its own cuts
July 10.  Nestle, Danone, Mead Johnson, Abbott Laboratories, Royal
FrieslandCampina and Biostime International had said earlier
this month they were working with the government on the matter.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
