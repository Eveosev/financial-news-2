Rubber pared the first monthly gain
in six ahead of U.S. economic growth data and a policy statement
by the Federal Reserve today.  The contract for delivery in January fell as much as 2.1
percent to 238.7 yen a kilogram ($2,435 a metric ton) on the
Tokyo Commodity Exchange and was at 242.6 yen at 11:52 a.m.
Prices gained 2.7 percent this month, paring losses this year to
20 percent.  The Fed has indicated its $85 billion monthly bond
purchases could be trimmed should the U.S. economy meet its
forecasts, though Chairman Ben S. Bernanke has said there’s no
fixed schedule for tapering stimulus. The government may say
today that gross domestic product growth slowed last quarter,
while employment data are also scheduled this week.  “Investors are waiting for the outcome of the FOMC meeting
whether they will taper quantitative easing,” said Lee Chen
Hoay, an analyst at Phillip Futures Pte., from  Singapore .  U.S. gross domestic product probably grew at a 1 percent
annualized rate from April through June, compared with 1.8
percent in the previous three months, according to the median
estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News before the
Commerce Department data today.  Rubber for January delivery gained 1.3 percent to 17,745
 yuan  ($2,895) a ton on the Shanghai Futures Exchange. Thai
rubber free-on-board fell 1 percent to 77.25 baht ($2.46) a
kilogram yesterday, the lowest level since October 2009,
according to the Rubber Research Institute of  Thailand .  To contact the reporter on this story:
