Wheat rose the most in three weeks
on signs that demand is increasing from importers including
 Egypt , the world’s top buyer. Soybeans and corn also gained.  Egypt agreed to purchase 240,000 metric tons in a tender
yesterday from suppliers in Romania and Ukraine. Japan said
yesterday it will resume importing U.S. western white-wheat
after it banned shipments in May following the discovery of an
unapproved gene-altered crop in  Oregon . Since June 1, the U.S.
has sold or shipped 12.3 million tons of the grain, up 45
percent from a year earlier, government  data  show.  “Wheat is moving higher on optimism about global export
demand,”  Shawn McCambridge , senior grain analyst for Jefferies
Bache LLC in  Chicago , said in a telephone interview. “Importers
are looking to build some inventories.”  Wheat futures for delivery in September increased 1.4
percent to close at $6.6425 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the Chicago
Board of Trade, the biggest gain since July 9. The decline pared
the gain in July to 1 percent, after touching a 13-month low of
$6.48 on July 25.  China also has stepped up acquisitions of U.S. supplies
after prices slumped and wet, cold weather damaged yields and
crop quality in the Asian country, McCambridge said. The
nation’s imports may reach 12 million tons this year, above the
8.5 million forecast by the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  on
July 11, he said.  Soybeans, Corn  Soybean futures for delivery in November rose 0.3 percent
to $12.0625 a bushel, after touching $11.9425, the lowest for a
most-active contract since January 2012. The most-active
contract fell 3.7 percent this month.  U.S. exporters sold 410,000 tons of soybeans to unknown
buyers, the USDA said in separate reports the past two days.  Corn futures for delivery in December gained 0.3 percent to
$4.79 a bushel, paring this month’s decline to 6.3 percent after
cool weather boosted pollination across the Midwest.  Rain yesterday in the central Midwest was more than some
forecasters expected, with some areas getting 1 inch (2.5
centimeters), Commodity Weather Group said today in a report.
The USDA projects the U.S. corn and soybean harvests will be the
biggest ever this year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
