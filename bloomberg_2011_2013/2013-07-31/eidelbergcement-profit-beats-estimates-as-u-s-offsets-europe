HeidelbergCement AG (HEI) , the world’s
third-largest maker of cement, posted second-quarter profit that
beat analysts’ estimates as sales in  North America  and the
recovering U.K. market offset declines elsewhere in  Europe .  Operating income before depreciation rose 5.5 percent to
734 million euros ($973 million), the Heidelberg, Germany-based
company said today in a statement. That beat the 725 million-euro average estimate of 10 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.
Sales increased 0.5 percent to 3.8 billion euros.  The company, which dates back to 1873, is pursuing 1.01
billion euros in cost savings by the end of 2013 as demand for
building materials drops in parts of Europe amid recessions in
the region. HeidelbergCement reiterated it expects to increase
revenue and operating income this year, while “significantly”
increasing pretax profit.  “The measures we introduced to improve margins are showing
results,” Chief Executive Officer Bernd Scheifele said in the
statement. “We were able to implement price increases in our
principal markets, and our efficiency improvement programmes are
progressing according to plan.”  Lafarge SA (LG) , the world’s biggest cement maker, said last
week it will sell more assets to cut debt after a deterioration
in European demand and poor weather for construction cut second-quarter profit. The Paris-based company said it expects cement
demand growth in its markets this year to be in the range of
zero to 3 percent, down from a previous range of 1 percent to 4
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
