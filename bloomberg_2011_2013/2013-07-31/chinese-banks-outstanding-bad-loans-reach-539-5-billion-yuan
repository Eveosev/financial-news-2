Chinese banks’ outstanding bad loans
stood at 539.5 billion  yuan  ($88 billion) at the end of June, at
a ratio of 0.96 percent, the  China  Banking Regulatory Commission
said.  China’s local government financing vehicles’ combined
outstanding loans gained 6.2 percent to total 9.7 trillion yuan
at the end of June, according to a statement that was posted on
the commission’s website.  Chinese banks’ profits may decline in the next three years
as a government crackdown on industrial overcapacity slows
lending and sours loans, JPMorgan Securities (Asia Pacific) Ltd.
said today. Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd., China
Construction Bank Corp., Agricultural Bank of China Ltd., and
Bank of China Ltd. were among the world’s five most profitable
lenders last year, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  The growth rate of local government financing vehicles
outstanding loans was nine percentage points lower than the
average loan growth as of the end of June, according to the
statement.  CBRC said that it will prevent risks in credit, liquidity,
asset management products and trust businesses in the statement.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
