The real dropped to a four-year low
as U.S. economic growth fueled speculation that the  Federal
Reserve  will curtail stimulus, prompting  Brazil ’s central bank
to intervene to stem the currency’s decline.  The real depreciated 0.4 percent to 2.2905 per dollar at
10:34 a.m. in  Sao Paulo , the weakest level on a closing basis
since March 2009, after earlier dropping 0.8 percent. It
extended the loss this month to 2.8 percent, the biggest among
24 emerging-market dollar counterparts.  The currency pared its decline as the central bank sold
$1.5 billion of foreign-exchange swap contracts in the 20th day
of intervention since May 31. The real’s depreciation pushes up
the price of imports and threatens to further fuel inflation,
which helped spark nationwide street protests in June.  “This positive drive of growth in the U.S. is good for the
world, but there’s also a repositioning of liquidity,” Flavia Cattan-Naslausky, a strategist at Royal Bank of Scotland Group
Plc, said by phone from Stamford,  Connecticut . “If the real
surpasses 2.3 per dollar, the currency is going to hit inflation
expectations.”  The  U.S. economy  grew 1.7 percent in the second quarter, up
from 1.1 percent in the first three months of the year, the
Commerce Department reported today.  Brazilian swap rates on the contract maturing in January
2015 increased six basis points, or 0.06 percentage point, to
9.65 percent, the highest level since July 5. They have declined
22 basis points this month.  To contact the reporters on this story:
