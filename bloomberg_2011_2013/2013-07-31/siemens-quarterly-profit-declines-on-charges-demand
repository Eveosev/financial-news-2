Siemens AG (SIE) , which today promoted
finance head Joe Kaeser to chief executive officer, said
quarterly operating profit dropped 31 percent amid rising
charges for failed train and solar energy projects.  So-called sector profit from the main health care,
industry, infrastructure and energy divisions fell to 1.26
billion euros ($1.7 billion), the company said today. Sales
dropped 2 percent to 19.3 billion euros. The average estimate of
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was for 18.7 billion euros.  Siemens earlier today named Kaeser as CEO to take over from
 Peter Loescher  after  Europe ’s biggest engineering company
repeatedly missed profit targets and charges mounted for failed
power and train projects. The company, which makes products from
power turbines to high-speed trains, last week said it no longer
predicts an operating profit margin of at least 12 percent of
sales in the 12 months through September 2014.  The company said today it expects “clear” order growth
and a “moderate” decline in revenue for fiscal 2013, with
earnings of 4 billion euros.  The stock was down 0.2 percent as of 12:23 p.m. in
Frankfurt trading.  U.S. rival General Electric this month reported quarterly
profit that beat analysts’ estimates as demand for  jet engines 
and oil-and-gas drilling equipment drove the order backlog to a
record.  To contact the reporter on this story:
