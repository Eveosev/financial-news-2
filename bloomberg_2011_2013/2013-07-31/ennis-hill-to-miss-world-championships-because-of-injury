Olympic heptathlon champion Jessica
Ennis-Hill has withdrawn from next month’s  IAAF World
Championships  in Moscow because of an Achilles and heel injury.  “Up until now we have been focusing on managing the pain
so I can train and get myself in shape to go out there to win in
Moscow -- which has meant not focusing on finding a cure for the
injury,” Ennis-Hill said in an e-mailed British Athletics
statement today. “The time has now come to stop chasing fitness
and look to cure the problem.”  Ennis-Hill won the heptathlon in front of a sellout crowd
of 80,000 at the London Olympics last year. She used last
weekend’s Anniversary Games in London -- where she finished last
in the long jump and fourth in the 100-meter hurdles -- as a
test of her fitness.  “I am so glad I got to compete in  London  last weekend as
it gave me a clear picture of where I am, and it is definitely
not where I want to be both regarding pain and also form,” said
Ennis-Hill, the 2009 world champion. “To say I am gutted is an
understatement: no athlete likes to miss the opportunity to
compete at a major championships. They don’t come round that
often.”  The world championships start Aug. 10.  To contact the reporter on this story:
