Siam Cement Pcl (SCC) , Thailand’s fifth-biggest company by market value, said net income more than
doubled in the second quarter on dividend contributions and a
recovery in margins at its petrochemical unit.  Profit was 9.9 billion baht ($316 million), or 8.27 baht a
share, compared with 4.3 billion baht, or 3.57 baht, a year
earlier, the company said. That exceeded the average estimate of
8.7 billion baht in a Bloomberg  survey  of 11 analysts.  Chief Executive Officer Kan Trakulhoon said today that Siam
Cement will acquire a company that makes roofing products in
Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam and the Philippines, extending a
strategy of expansion in  Southeast Asia  to tap rising incomes in
countries neighboring Thailand. Higher  oil prices  helped
earnings recover at its petrochemical unit, Kan said on July 17.  Revenue increased 6 percent in the second quarter from a
year earlier to 106.5 billion baht. The company said it received
2.9 billion baht in dividend contributions from SCG Investment
during the period.  Profit at SCG Chemicals Co., Siam Cement’s petrochemicals
unit, was 2.6 billion baht, from a year-earlier loss of 1
billion baht, the company said. SCG Paper said net income fell
by 6 percent to 1 billion baht and SCG Cement had a 15 percent
increase in profit to 3.4 billion baht.  To contact the reporter on this story:
