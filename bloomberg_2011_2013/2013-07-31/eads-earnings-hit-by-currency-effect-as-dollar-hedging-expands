European Aeronautic, Defence & Space
Co. (EAD)  said first-half earnings suffered from a 170 million euro
($225 million) currency revaluation as the company expanded its
hedging policy to lock in low euro rates.  Commercial airplane unit Airbus, which will now lend its
name to the entire group, had a 108 million-euro charge in the
first six months to reflect the revaluation and a dollar
mismatch on so called pre-delivery payments that customers make
before receiving their jet, the Toulouse-based company said.  EADS is exposed to swings in the  exchange rate  between the
dollar and euro since most of its costs are in the European
currency, with planes sold by Airbus priced in dollars. The
company needs to buy financial contracts to protect revenue
translated back into euros since every 10-cent drop in the value
of the dollar against the euro costs the company about 1 billion
euros in pretax profit.  EADS secured $10.3 billion worth of new hedge contracts in
the first six months, adding $5.3 billion in the second quarter,
according to a presentation to analysts. The average rate for
the hedges was $1.32, compared with the $1.33 average rate at
the end of March.  EADS has hedged costs for this year, covering about 23.4
billion euros, at an average rate of $1.37, trailing the $1.36
rate it saw last year. The hedge rate for next year should be
$1.35, one cent above the figure locked in six months ago.  The $82.1 billion hedgebook EADS has ammased to lock in
costs on future Airbus deliveries has an average rate of $1.34
per euro compared to $1.35 at the end of last year. The total
has a negative 1.1 billion euro mark-to-market value with a
closing rate at mid-year of $1.31.  The euro was little changed today in Frankfurt and traded
at $1.3265 as of 9:47 a.m.  The strength of Airbus orderbookings has increased the
amount of “exposure,” or amount of dollar sales that require
coverage from hedges in the coming years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
