Centrica Plc (CNA) , the largest energy
supplier to U.K. households, said first-half profit rose because
of higher gas consumption during a prolonged cold winter.  Adjusted earnings advanced to 767 million pounds ($1.2
billion) from a revised 753 million pounds a year earlier, the
Windsor, England-based company said today in a statement. That
beat the median estimate of 719 million pounds from four
analysts in a Bloomberg News survey.  “Against a backdrop of sustained cold weather, average
residential gas consumption was up 13 percent compared to last
year and significantly above seasonal normal levels,” Centrica
said in the statement.  Operating profit at Centrica’s British Gas residential unit
was “marginally” higher than a year earlier, with higher
environmental and commodity costs offsetting increased
consumption.  Centrica in June bought a 25 percent stake in Cuadrilla
Resources Ltd.’s shale gas licenses in northern England for 40
million pounds in cash. In April, it agreed to purchase, with
state-run Qatar Petroleum, natural gas fields from Canada’s
 Suncor Energy Inc. (SU)   The company plans to double profitability in  North America 
within five years and yesterday agreed to buy  Hess Corp. (HES) ’s
energy marketing unit for $731 million in cash.  To contact the reporter on this story:
