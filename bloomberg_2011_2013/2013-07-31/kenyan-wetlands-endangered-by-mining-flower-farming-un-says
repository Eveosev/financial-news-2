Kenya ’s wetlands must be better
protected from manmade risks including the diversion of water
for agriculture and pollution from urbanization, the  United
Nations  said.  Areas under threat include the western Lake Victoria North
Basin Wetlands, where parts are being developed for mining or
farming, and the Rift Valley Basin Wetlands, the UN Environment
Programme said today, citing the new Kenya Wetlands Atlas.  Wetlands are degrading more rapidly than other ecosystems
because policy makers misunderstand their role in supporting
animal and plant life and storing carbon, UNEP Executive
Director Achim Steiner said in a statement in Nairobi. Kenya is
improving policy to protect wetlands, Secretary for Environment,
Water and Natural Resources Judi Wakhungu said in the statement.  The Rift Valley Basin Wetlands contain Lake Naivasha, which
is designated a  Wetland of International Importance  and is
facing pressure from water-intensive flower farming, UNEP said.  Kenya,  East Africa ’s largest economy, is a major flower
producer that sells to  Europe . The country relies on agriculture
for a fifth of its economic output, and is the world’s biggest
exporter of black tea.  The government may consider adopting a wetlands law and
classifying more sites as protected, according to the UN, which
helped compile the wetlands atlas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
