Qatar Airways  Ltd., which pulled one
of its Boeing 787 Dreamliners out of service ten days ago, said
the plane resumed flying today after replacing some parts.  A delay in shipping one of the components to Qatar Airway’s
hub in Doha, Qatar, caused the plane to be taken out of service
since July 22, the carrier said in an e-mailed statement today,
without specifying which parts were required.  “Qatar Airways confirms that its Boeing 787 Dreamliner A7-BCB has reconvened service after a number of technical
components required replacement,” it said. Once the component
had arrived, it required three days of post-assembly and
testing.  Qatar Airways said last week that it found a “minor”
technical issue while the plane was on the ground, without
providing details. The incident followed a spate of mishaps for
the Boeing 787, including a fire on board an Ethiopian Airlines-owned Dreamliner this month at  Heathrow Airport , and a three-month grounding of the global fleet after batteries caught fire.  Qatar Airways currently has six Boeing 787 Dreamliners in
its fleet and 54 on order, according to its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
