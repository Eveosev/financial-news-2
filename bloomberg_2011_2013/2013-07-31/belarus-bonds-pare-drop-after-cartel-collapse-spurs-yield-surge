(Corrects year that BPC was founded in third paragraph of
story published yesterday.)  Yields on Belarus’s dollar bonds
pared their biggest jump in six weeks after  Russia ’s OAO
Uralkali pulled out of a cartel with a state-owned local miner,
spurring concern budget revenue will fall.  The yield on Belarus’s 2018 Eurobond was steady at 9.09
percent after surging 83 basis points yesterday, the most since
June 20, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The yield on the
country’s dollar notes due 2015 fell seven basis points, or 0.07
percentage point, to 8.96 percent as of 11:28 a.m. in Minsk,
after surging to the highest since June 8 yesterday.  Uralkali said yesterday it will no longer sell the
fertilizer through Belarusian Potash Co., the Minsk-based
 marketing company  it established in 2005 with rival miner
Belaruskali. Until yesterday, BPC controlled about 40 percent of
global potash exports. Belarus, which has no significant natural
resources other than potash, earned $2.7 billion from selling
the crop nutrient abroad last year, or 5.6 percent of total
export revenue.  To contact the reporter on this story:
