Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA (BBVA) ,
 Spain ’s second-biggest bank, said quarterly profit more than
doubled after it sold pension units in  South America  and set
aside less money for souring real-estate assets.  Second-quarter  net income  rose to 1.15 billion euros ($1.5
billion) from 505 million euros a year ago, the Bilbao, Spain-based bank said in a filing to regulators today. That matched
the average  estimate  of 12 analysts in a Bloomberg survey.  BBVA has forecast profit to climb as it completes the
cleanup of its Spanish real estate assets and  divisions  such as
its  U.S. bank  join Latin American units in contributing to
earnings. Profit was boosted by 471 million euros of gains from
the sale of pensions businesses in Colombia and  Peru .  “BBVA showed a decent performance from international
businesses but conditions in Spain are still putting
profitability under pressure,” said Daragh Quinn, an  analyst  at
Nomura International in  Madrid  with a neutral recommendation on
the stock.  BBVA shares rose 0.5 percent to 7.12 euros in Madrid,
extending this year’s advance to 2.3 percent compared with an
8.3 percent gain for the 44-member Bloomberg Europe Banks and
Financial Services Index. Shares of  Banco Santander SA (SAN) , Spain’s
biggest bank that yesterday said second-quarter profit jumped
eightfold to 1.05 billion euros, have declined 9.9 percent.  Dividend Policy  The bank is sticking to its policy of paying two dividends
in cash and two mostly in shares a year and will review it
toward the 2013, Chief Operating Officer Angel Cano said on a
 webcast  today. The Bank of Spain told lenders in June that
dividend distributions for 2013 should be “limited.”  Bad loans as a proportion of lending rose to 5.5 percent
from 5.3 percent in March and 4 percent a year ago as loans
newly classed as in default advanced to 4.1 billion euros in the
second quarter from 3.6 billion euros in the first. BBVA is
still in talks with the Bank of Spain about how it will comply
with an April order to review loans that have been refinanced to
see whether more provisions should be set aside, Cano said.  Loan provisioning costs dropped to 1.34 billion euros from
2.18 billion euros a year earlier. First-half losses from BBVA’s
Spanish real estate unit fell to 629 million euros from 1.43
billion euros as net property exposure decreased to 15.1 billion
euros from 15.4 billion euros in March, the bank said.  Capital Ratio  BBVA’s core capital ratio was 11.3 percent, up from 11.2
percent in March, and its  leverage ratio  under full Basel III
rules was 4.8 percent. Net interest income declined 1.7 percent
to 3.68 billion euros in the year and was up from 3.62 billion
euros in the first quarter. Gross lending dropped 1.1 percent.  The  Mexican  unit reported an increase in net income to 441
million euros at constant exchange rates from 434 million euros
a year ago as lending climbed at an annual rate of 7.3 percent,
the bank said. Earnings from Spanish banking fell to 173 million
euros from 413 million euros a year earlier as the bad-loan
ratio rose to 4.7 percent from 3 percent.  BBVA’s South American banks reported net income of 265
million euros, down from 273 million euros a year ago. Profit
from its Eurasian business, with stakes in lenders such as in
Turkey and  China , fell to 250 million euros from 279 million
euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
