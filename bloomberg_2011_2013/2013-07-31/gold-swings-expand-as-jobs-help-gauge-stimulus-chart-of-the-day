Gold traders should brace themselves
for bigger-than-normal price moves tomorrow as investors use
U.S. jobs data to gauge when the Federal Reserve will slow
stimulus that helped cap a 12-year bull rally last year.  The CHART OF THE DAY shows gold’s swings were above average
on five of the seven days this year, including the last four,
when the Labor Department released its monthly employment
report. The metal traded as much as $42.22 an ounce above its
intraday low on July 5, when payrolls rose more than economists
surveyed by Bloomberg had forecast. The average daily swing this
year has been about $26.08, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Gold dropped 21 percent this year after some investors lost
faith in the metal as a store of value. Prices rose in July for
the first month since March after Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke
said it’s too early to decide whether to curb bond buying in
September, after saying on June 19 that purchases could slow if
the economy improves. Fed policy markers pledged to keep buying
$85 billion in bonds every month at the conclusion of a two-day
meeting yesterday.  “The gold price is driven primarily by U.S. government
monetary and fiscal policies,” said Tom Winmill, who helps
manage about $200 million of assets in Walpole, New Hampshire,
for Midas Funds. “That is why the gold market is looking so
hard at jobs data. Gold will continue to be very volatile.”  Payrolls probably grew by 185,000 workers in July after
rising by 195,000 in June, according to the median forecast of
economists in a Bloomberg survey. Tomorrow’s data may also show
the unemployment rate fell to 7.5 percent, the survey showed.
Half the economists in a July 18-22 Bloomberg survey said the
central bank will trim monthly bond buying to $65 billion in
September, from $85 billion now.  Gold for immediate delivery traded at $1,325.25 an ounce in
 London  yesterday. Prices, which reached a record $1,921.15 in
September 2011, set a 34-month low of $1,180.50 on June 28. The
metal closed lower on four of the days this year when the Labor
Department released monthly jobs data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
