Samsung Electronics Co. (005930) , the world’s
largest smartphone maker, said it will release Galaxy S4 phones
in China and Australia capable of operating on dual 4G LTE
networks.  The Galaxy S4 smartphone and its mini version will be
compatible with both the technology standards currently
supporting high-speed 4G networks, the Suwon, South Korea-based
company said in a statement today. The widely deployed Frequency
Division Duplex, or FDD, and the Time Division Duplex, or TDD,
are the two primary methods of delivering the 4G service based
on Long Term Evolution, or LTE, technology.  “The long-term evolution market is still at an initial
stage that has a high growth potential and is expected to help
smartphone market to regain momentum,” Shin Jong Kyun, head of
Samsung’s mobile business, said in an e-mailed interview. “The
alternative TDD-LTE technology will be adopted not only in  China 
but also other markets, including U.S., Australia, Europe and
 Russia .”  To contact the reporter on this story:
