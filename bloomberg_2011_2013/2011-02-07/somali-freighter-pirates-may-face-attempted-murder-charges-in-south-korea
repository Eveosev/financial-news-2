Somali pirates captured by  South
Korea ’s navy last month in a raid to free the crew of a hijacked
freighter may face charges including attempted murder, the Korea
Coast Guard said.  One of the five pirates allegedly shot the captain of the
Samho Jewelry in an attempt to kill him, the Korea Coast Guard
said today in an e-mailed statement. The captain has been
receiving medical treatment after suffering a gunshot wound in
the Jan. 21 operation in the Gulf of Aden.  Under South Korea’s  criminal law , the penalty for murder
while engaged in an act of piracy can be death or a life
sentence. While a failed attempt to kill may receive a less
severe sentence, the law doesn’t specify exact terms.  The case will be handed over to South Korean prosecutors,
who will determine charges, the coast guard said. Other charges
may include piracy, kidnapping and robbery, according to the
statement.  The South Korean military rescued 21 crew members and
killed eight pirates in the nation’s first such raid since
sending warships to the area in 2009. The Samho Jewelry was
hauling chemicals and was headed to  Sri Lanka  from the  United
Arab Emirates  when it was hijacked on Jan. 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
