  South Africa  should study building a
new coal-export harbor to meet surging demand from  Asia  or risk
falling behind nations that are investing in transportation and
output of the fuel, research company McCloskey Group said.  “South Africa is the natural supplier for  India ’s new
demand,” Managing Director Gerard McCloskey said at the Mining
Indaba conference in Cape Town today. Yet the nation is “humble
in its aspirations” and infrastructure is underfunded, he said.  Planned new rail lines in African countries may increase
regional coal output, while Mozambique and Botswana are also
looking to boost production, he said.  While South Africa last year expanded capacity at Richards
Bay Coal Terminal to an annual 91 million metric tons, state-run
rail operator Transnet Ltd., which delivers most of the fuel to
the facility, is only able to carry about 65 million tons. The
country last year shipped 62.86 million tons from the terminal,
owned by producers including BHP Billiton Ltd. and  Xstrata Plc .  The terminal handles more than 90 percent of South Africa’s
coal exports, while Asia overtook  Europe  as the country’s main
overseas market for the product during the past two years.  “The European market is fading but the Asian market is
really booming,” McCloskey said. “One in three ships that goes
out of Richards Bay now heads for India.”  The government should consider appointing a coal “czar”
to encourage development of the industry, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
