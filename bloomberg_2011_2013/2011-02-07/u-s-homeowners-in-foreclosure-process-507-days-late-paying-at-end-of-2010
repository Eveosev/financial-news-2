U.S. homeowners in the foreclosure
process were an average of 507 days late on payments at the end
of last year as lenders handled a record rate of mortgage
delinquencies,  Lender Processing Services Inc . said today.  The average grew 25 percent from 406 days at the end of
2009, according to the Jacksonville, Florida-based mortgage
processing and default management company.  “The sheer volume of loans going through the system is
going to extend those timelines,” said Herb Blecher, senior
vice president for analytics at Lender Processing. Foreclosure
processing also was slowed by “an abundance of caution” in the
last three months of 2010 after lenders were accused of using
faulty documentation and procedures to seize homes, he said.  A national jobless rate of 9 percent is increasing loan
defaults and weighing down prices as foreclosed properties sell
at a discount. Homeowners with 6.87 million loans -- 13 percent
of all mortgages -- were at least 30 days behind on their
payments as of Dec. 31, Lender Processing said.    Florida  led the nation with a 23 percent delinquency rate,
followed by Nevada at 21 percent, Mississippi at 19 percent, and
Georgia and New Jersey at 15 percent, the loan processor said.  California homeowners who didn’t make their mortgage
payments had the longest average wait before receiving a notice
of default at 379 days, followed by Florida at 349 days,
Maryland at 345 days,  New York  at 344 days, and Rhode Island and  Washington , D.C., at 341 days.  Delinquent homeowners held onto their properties for the
longest in Vermont, where it took an average 754 days to lose
their homes, followed by 697 days in New York, 695 days in  Maine , 688 days in Florida and 682 days in  New Jersey .  The number of U.S. homes receiving a foreclosure filings
may climb 20 percent this year, reaching a peak of the housing
crisis, as banks step up the pace of seizures, RealtyTrac Inc.
said Jan. 13. A record 2.87 million properties received notices
of default, auction or repossession last year, according to the
Irvine, California-based data provider.  To contact the reporter on this story:  John Gittelsohn  in New York at
