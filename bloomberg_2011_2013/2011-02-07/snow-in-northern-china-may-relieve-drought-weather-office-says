Snow and rain forecast in northern
and eastern  China  for the next three days may ease a drought in
the regions, the National Meteorological Center said.  Henan, the top wheat-growing region, and southern Shandong,
the second-biggest producer, may get as much as 3 millimeters of
rain or snow by Feb. 10, according to the forecaster. This
“system of precipitation” will bring moisture to some of the
drought-affected areas, it said in an e-mail today.  About 35 percent of the wheat crop in China’s eight main-
growing regions has been affected by dry conditions since
October, the official news agency China News Service said today.  Anhui and Jiangsu provinces are also expected to get rain
or snow, the weather forecaster’s e-mail said.  --William Bi. Editor: Tan Hwee Ann  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
