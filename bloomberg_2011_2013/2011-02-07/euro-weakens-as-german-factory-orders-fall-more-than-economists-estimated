The euro weakened against the dollar
after data showed German factory orders fell more than analysts
estimated in December.  The euro slipped 0.2 percent to $1.3551 as of 11:07 a.m. in  London , and was little changed at 111.65 yen.  German factory orders dropped 3.4 percent from November the
Economy Ministry in Berlin said today. Economists forecast a 1.5
percent decline, according to the median of 37 estimates in a
Bloomberg News survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
