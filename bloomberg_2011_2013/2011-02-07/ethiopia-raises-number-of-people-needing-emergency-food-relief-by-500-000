  Ethiopia  raised the estimate of the
number of people who will need food aid this year by half a
million to 2.8 million because of drought in the Somali region,
Agriculture State Minister Mitiku Kassa said today.  The government in November estimated that a bumper harvest
had cut the number of Ethiopians needing emergency food aid to
2.3 million from more than 5 million. About 107,000 children may
need treatment for severe malnutrition, the United Nations
humanitarian coordinator in Ethiopia, Eugene Owusu, said at a
joint briefing with Mitiku in the capital,  Addis Ababa .  Failure of rains from October to December in the arid
eastern Somali region and the southeast of Oromia region are
“having a significant humanitarian impact,” Owusu said.  Water shortages could persist until May in the drought-
affected areas, Amy Martin, deputy head of the  UN Office for the
Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs , said today in an
interview.  The Somali region has been the scene of clashes between
government forces and the Ogaden National Liberation Front rebel
group. The insurgents have been fighting for self-determination
for the people of the Ogaden, a region that borders Somalia, for
16 years.  Ethiopia, sub-Saharan  Africa ’s second-most populous nation
and top coffee producer, has another 7.8 million people who
receive food or cash under the Productive Safety Net Program,
Mitiku said. The program is financed by donors including the
U.S., the European Union, the  World Bank  and the U.K.  To contact the reporter on this story:
