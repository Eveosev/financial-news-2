African countries should pursue a
“green revolution” to protect the world’s poorest continent from
rising global food prices, said former Brazilian President  Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva .  “There can be no sovereignty without food sovereignty,” he
told a meeting of the World Social Forum in Dakar, Senegal,
today. “I am convinced that  Africa  has all the conditions
necessary to follow the path trailed by Brazil, with the
promotion of a green revolution.”  An index of 55 food commodities climbed 3.4 percent to a
record 231 points in January from a month earlier, according to
the  United Nations ’ Food and Agricultural Organization. Prices
rose 25 percent in 2010, sparking concern of a return to high
costs that hindered economies and caused riots in 2008.  Lula urged African countries to unite politically and
distance themselves from “the major world powers” by forging
ties with other developing nations. “Those who give us lessons
on how to manage our own economies were not able to avoid the
crisis that overtook their own countries and from there, all of
humanity,” he said.  The former leader, who said he visited 29 African countries
during his eight-year term, said the continent “has more
relevance than ever” to other developing nations like  Brazil .  To contact the reporter on this story:
