Irish residential rates fell 0.6
percent in 2010 to 830 euros ($1,127) a month, 27 percent below
the 2007 peak, according to Dublin-based  Daft  property website.  The decline compared with a 15 percent drop in 2009, Daft
said in the report. In Dublin, rents rose 0.3 percent to 1,080
euros.  “The key condition for a leveling off in prices is
clearing the overhang on the market,” Ronan Lyons, an economist
at Daft, said in the report. “In Dublin’s rental market, and to
a lesser extent in those of the other cities around the country,
that happened over the course of 2010.” Nationally
“significant oversupply” remains, Lyons said.  Irish  house prices , which quadrupled in the decade through
2007, have plunged as unemployment rose during the recession,
banks tightened lending criteria and a building boom left the
country with a housing glut.  To contact the reporter on this story:
