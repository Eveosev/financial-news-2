The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index may
end 2020 at 2,450 given the benchmark measure’s average price-
earnings ratio since 1940, according to UBS Wealth Management.  The advance requires an 86 percent advance in the next
decade from today’s closing level of 1,319.05. Companies in the
benchmark gauge for U.S. stocks have traded at about 14.7 times
earnings since 1940,  Mike Ryan , chief investment strategist, and
Kurt Reiman, head of thematic research, wrote in a report. The
annualized total return for the index will be about 9 percent
over the next 10 years, as earnings of companies in the index
increase to $165 a share, they said.  “It would be a mistake to structurally underweight
equities,” they wrote in the report titled “The Decade Ahead.”
“After a decade in which bonds outperformed stocks by one of the
widest margins on record, the fortunes of these two asset
classes will reverse. Bonds will come under severe pressure,
while stocks should post reasonably attractive returns.”  Interest rates will likely rise in the next 10 years, as
inflation accelerates, according to UBS. Private sector credit
demand will rebound, while federal budget deficits will persist,
the Zurich-based bank said. The  S&P 500  has gained 26 percent
since Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben Bernanke  indicated in August
that he would buy Treasuries to boost the economy.  The average forecast of 12 strategists surveyed by
Bloomberg News calls for the S&P 500 to end 2011 at 1,392, a 5.5
percent increase from the benchmark measure’s level today.  Laszlo Birinyi, one of the first money managers to advise
buying U.S. stocks before they bottomed in March 2009, said in a
report to clients last month that the average length and size of
bull markets suggests the S&P 500 will rally to 2,854 on Sept.
4, 2013. Given how long the advances that began in 1962, 1982,
1990 and 2002 lasted, the current rally should continue another
32 months, according to Westport, Connecticut-based Birinyi
