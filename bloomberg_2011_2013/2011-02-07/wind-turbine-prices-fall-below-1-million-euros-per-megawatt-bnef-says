Wind turbine prices last year fell
below 1 million euros ($1.4 million) a megawatt for the first
time since 2005, Bloomberg New Energy Finance said.  Global turbine contracts signed in the last six months of
2010 for delivery this year averaged 980,000 euros a megawatt,
the London-based analyst said today in a statement. That’s down
from 1.06 million euros for contracts signed in 2009 and a peak
of 1.21 million euros in 2007 and 2008, the group said.  “Delays in  project financing  decreased demand for  wind
turbines  in 2010, which translated into severe over-capacity in
several markets, such as the U.S. and  Spain ,” the report’s
author, Eduardo Tabbush, said in an e-mail. “This will hurt the
margins of manufacturers and component suppliers. However,  wind
energy  has never been so competitive.”  New wind power installations fell 7 percent worldwide last
year, weighed down by depressed electricity demand in weaker
nations and the difficulty faced by project developers in
getting finance, the Global Wind Energy Council said Feb. 2. At
the same time, it said wind power is now rapidly expanding
beyond traditional “rich-country” markets.  The cost of generating wind power in the most breezy areas
has fallen below $69 a megawatt-hour, which compares with $67
for coal-fired  power plants  and $56 for combined cycle plants
using gas, Tabbush said.  All manufacturers showed “aggressive pricing,” with some
contracts dipping below 900,000 euros a megawatt, New Energy
Finance said. The U.S. was the lowest-priced market, with an
average charge of 930,000 euros per megawatt, it said.  The researcher started compiling the index in 2009, and has
since also gathered data from earlier years. Prices haven’t
dipped this low since 2005 when German and Spanish incentives
spurred the market, Tabbush said. Before that, prices were lower
“but it was a niche market,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
