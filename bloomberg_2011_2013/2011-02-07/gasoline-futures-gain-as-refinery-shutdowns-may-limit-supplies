Gasoline rose on speculation that
refinery shutdowns may limit supplies of the motor fuel.  Futures gained as Valero Energy Corp. shut its Aruba
refinery after a water tank collapsed. Exxon Mobil Corp. has
started work at its 503,000-barrel-a-day plant in  Baton Rouge ,  Louisiana . ConocoPhillips has shut a fluid catalytic cracker at
its Borger plant in the  Texas  Panhandle, according to two people
familiar with refinery operations.  “This could be the fallout from all these refinery
issues,” said  Tom Knight , vice president of trading and supply
at Truman Arnold Cos. in Texarkana, Texas.  Gasoline for March delivery added 1.52 cents, or 0.6
percent, to settle at $2.4505 a gallon on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . The gasoline crack spread, based on March
contracts, widened $2.19 to $15.44 a barrel.  Flint Hills Resources LLC shut a fluid catalytic cracker at
its Corpus Christi, Texas, refinery on Feb. 4 because of an
instrument malfunction. The refinery has a daily crude
processing capacity of 305,000 barrels a day.  Stockpiles of gasoline probably rose 3 million barrels last
week, according to the median estimate of 10 analysts in a
survey by Bloomberg News. Gasoline inventories rose 6.15 million
barrels in the week ended Jan. 28 to 236.2 million, the highest
since March 1993, according to Energy Department data.  Gasoline demand, measured by deliveries to wholesalers,
slipped to the lowest level since February 2010.    Egypt  Standoff  President  Barack Obama  said Egypt is “making progress” in
negotiating an end to the standoff between the government of
President  Hosni Mubarak  and the protesters demanding his ouster.  Obama spoke in response to a question about talks in Cairo
between Vice President  Omar Suleiman  and some opposition leaders
after two weeks of demonstrations intended to topple Mubarak.
Suleiman promised to issue within a month a draft list of
changes needed to hold free elections.  Heating oil and crude oil both reached two-year highs last
week on concerns that political unrest in Egypt would spread
throughout the Middle East.  “The situation hasn’t gotten much better but they’re
talking to each other so the unknown is a little less unknown,”
said Ray Carbone, president of Paramount Options Inc. in  New
York  and a trader at the Nymex.  Heating oil for March delivery fell 1.06 cents, or 0.4
percent, to settle at $2.7061 a gallon. The heating oil crack
spread, based on March contracts, added $1.11 to $26.18 a
barrel.  WTI-Brent Spread  The premiums of gasoline and heating oil over West Texas
Intermediate crude widened as European benchmark Brent crude
futures advanced to the highest level versus WTI, the U.S.
benchmark, since at least April 2003. The spread, based on March
futures traded on Nymex and ICE Futures Europe, increased 97
cents to $11.77 a barrel.  Supplies of distillates, including heating oil and diesel,
probably fell 1 million barrels, according to the survey.  Distillate stockpiles fell 1.58 million barrels to 164.1
million in the week ended Jan. 28 and demand increased 4.9
percent, according to department data. Heating oil inventories
dropped 6.7 percent to 39.2 million, the lowest level since May
2009.  Regular gasoline at the pump, averaged nationwide, lost 0.2
cent to $3.122 a gallon yesterday, AAA said on its  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
