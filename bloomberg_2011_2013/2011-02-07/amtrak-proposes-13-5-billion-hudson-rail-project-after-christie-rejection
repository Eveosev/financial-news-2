  Amtrak  is proposing a $13.5 billion
project that will include building two commuter rail tunnels
from New Jersey to  New York  by 2020, replacing a $9.7 billion
project that  New Jersey  Republican Governor Chris Christie
killed.  The so-called Gateway project would allow New Jersey
Transit and Amtrak to add 13 and eight trains per hour,
respectively, at peak times into New York, according to an e-
mailed statement today from Senator Frank Lautenberg, a New
Jersey Democrat.  “The Gateway Project is a vision for our future that will
shorten commutes, create jobs, increase property values and grow
New Jersey’s economy,” Lautenberg said in the statement.  Amtrak would spend $50 million on preliminary engineering
and design work and take the lead in finding other funding
sources, according to the statement. Possible contributors
include the states of New York and New Jersey;  New Jersey
Transit , New York’s Metropolitan Transportation Authority and
the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, as well as
private investors, it said.  Lautenberg and Senator Robert Menendez, also a New Jersey
Democrat; Amtrak Chief Executive Officer Joseph Boardman and
Amtrak board member Anthony Coscia announced the proposed
project at a press conference in Newark, New Jersey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
