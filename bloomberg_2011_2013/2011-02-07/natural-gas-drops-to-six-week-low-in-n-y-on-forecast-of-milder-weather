Natural gas dropped 4.8 percent, the
biggest decline in three months, as forecasts showed milder
weather next week, reducing demand for the heating fuel.  Gas fell to the lowest price in more than six weeks as the  National Weather Service  predicted temperatures will be higher
than usual in the U.S. East and Midwest from Feb. 12 to Feb. 16.
The weather has been colder than normal this month. U.S. gas
stockpiles are 0.2 percent above the five-year average,
according to an Energy Department report last week.  “It’s gradually getting warmer and you are having
declining winter-heating needs,” said Carl Neill, an energy
consultant at Risk Management Inc. in Atlanta. “The storage
draws are big and strong but they just haven’t been overwhelming
enough to really draw down storage to below average levels.”  Natural gas for March delivery fell 20.6 cents to $4.104
per million British thermal units on the  New York  Mercantile
Exchange, the lowest settlement price since Dec. 23. The
percentage loss was the biggest since Nov. 1. The futures have
dropped 26 percent from a year ago.  There will be widespread above-normal weather for the
“central to eastern thirds of the nation” next week, according
to Commodity Weather Group LLC in Bethesda,  Maryland .  New York will have a high of 52 degrees Fahrenheit (11
Celsius) on Feb. 15, 11 degrees above normal, according to
 AccuWeather Inc.  in  State College ,  Pennsylvania .  Boston  will
have a high of 47 degrees, 8 degrees above normal.  About 52 percent of U.S. households use natural gas for
heating, according to the Energy Department.  Supply Report  U.S. gas inventories fell 189 billion cubic feet in the
week ended Jan. 28 to 2.353 trillion, the Energy Department said
on Feb. 3. The surplus to the five-year average narrowed from
1.2 percent the previous week.  The number of U.S. gas drilling rigs declined by two last
week to 911, according to Baker Hughes Inc. The rig count was
3.8 percent higher than a year earlier.  Benchmark gas prices at the  Henry Hub  will average $3.94
million Btu this year, analysts including Biliana Pehlivanova at  Barclays Capital  in New York said in a report today.  Prices will rise to $4.50 next year, they said.  “Ultimately, the recovery in prices must come from the
supply side; there is no demand boost over the next few years
that could single-handedly restore market balance,” the
analysts said.  LNG Imports  Imports of liquefied natural gas to  North America  will be
unchanged at 1.2 billion cubic feet a day this year “as the
region continues to struggle with domestic oversupply,” the
Barclays analysts said.  GDF Suez’s LNG terminal near Boston is scheduled to receive
two cargos this month, according to vessel tracking data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Catalunya Spirit, which can move as much as 135,423 cubic
meters of the fuel, or about 2.92 billion cubic feet of natural
gas, is scheduled to arrive on Feb. 14, the data showed.  GDF
Suez  Cape Ann, which can move as much as 145,000 cubic meters of
LNG, is scheduled to arrive on Feb. 20.  Gas futures volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was
413,623 as of 2:56 p.m., compared with the three-month average
of 291,000. Volume was 292,536 on Feb. 4. Open interest was
865,691 contracts. The three-month average open interest is
794,000.  The exchange has a one-business-day delay in reporting open
interest and full volume data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
