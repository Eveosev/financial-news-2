Geopolitical concerns such as the
unrest in  Egypt  are unlikely to keep prices above $100 a barrel
because of ample OPEC spare capacity, according to a report by  Barclays Capital .  “Given the available spare capacity in key OPEC member
countries, it is unlikely to stay above $100 once these concerns
subside, in our view,” analysts including Amrita Sen said in
the report, published today. “Our view remains that while oil
prices are set to spend a fair amount of time above $100 a
barrel, it is unlikely to average $100 this year.”  The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, which
pumps about 40 percent of the world’s crude, had 5.44 million
barrels a day in spare capacity in January, based on estimated
production of 29.4 million barrels a day in a Bloomberg News
survey of  oil companies , producers and analysts.  Crude on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  hasn’t traded
above $100 a barrel since October 2008, as it declined from a
record $147.27. Brent crude oil on the London-based Ice Futures
Europe exchange settled above $100 for four days last week.  Oil for March delivery fell $1.55, or 1.7 percent, to
settle at $87.48 a barrel on the Nymex. It has averaged $89.61 a
barrel so far this year. Brent crude in  London  fell 58 cents, or
0.6 percent, to $99.25 a barrel. It has averaged $97.69 in 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
