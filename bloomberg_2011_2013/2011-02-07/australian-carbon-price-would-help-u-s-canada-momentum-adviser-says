  Australia , the world’s biggest coal
exporter, would “cease to be a drag” on global efforts to
tackle climate change if the country introduced a carbon price,
the government’s adviser  Ross Garnaut  said.  Australia could take a leadership role by imposing a cost
on carbon and help the U.S. and Canada “maintain momentum in
policies to reduce emissions,” he wrote in the second of eight
reports updating his 2008 analysis.  Australia is “the country with the greatest national
interest in effective mitigation, the country facing the
greatest resistances to changing the established pattern of
energy use and the developed country that is placed best to do
well in a low-carbon global economy,” Garnaut wrote in the
report, released today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
