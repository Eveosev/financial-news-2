U.S. stocks rose, sending the  Dow
Jones Industrial Average  up for a sixth straight day, as
takeover announcements bolstered investors’ optimism.    Beckman Coulter Inc . surged 10 percent as Danaher Corp.
agreed to acquire the laboratory-equipment maker for $6.8
billion.  Pride International Inc . rallied 16 percent after Ensco
Plc said it will buy the drilling contractor for $7.3 billion.  Wesco Financial Corp . added 1.8 percent as  Warren Buffett ’s  Berkshire Hathaway Inc . won the backing of the company’s board
to buy the 19.9 percent of stock it doesn’t own in the unit.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.6 percent to
1,319.05 at 4 p.m. in  New York , the highest since June 2008. The
Dow added 69.48 points, or 0.6 percent, to 12,161.63, extending
its longest stretch of gains since November. The Nasdaq-100
Index rallied 0.5 percent to 2,349.20, the highest since
February 2001. The Russell 2000 Index gained 1 percent to
808.32, the highest since October 2007.  “Animal spirits are returning,” said Stanley Nabi, New
York-based vice chairman of Silvercrest Asset Management Group,
which oversees $9.5 billion. “Companies have a lot of cash and
they should continue to look at other companies. We’re going to
see more M&A deals. That’s an indication of optimism about the
economy. That bodes well for stocks.”  The gain in stocks last week pushed the Dow to its first
close above 12,000 since June 2008 as earnings, an expansion of
American manufacturing and a decrease in the  unemployment rate 
overshadowed unrest in  Egypt . About three-quarters of the
companies in the  S&P 500  that have reported quarterly results
since Jan. 10 have topped analysts’ projections for per-share
profit, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Improving Sales  More U.S. companies are exceeding sales forecasts than any
time in four years, helping extend the biggest stock-market
rally since 1936. Caterpillar Inc. and  United Parcel Service
Inc ., barometers for the economy because of their building and
delivery businesses, are among the 72 percent of S&P 500
companies that reported more revenue last quarter than analysts
estimated as of the end of last week, the largest proportion
since at least 2006, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  While U.S. earnings have surpassed Wall Street estimates
for seven straight quarters, sales have trailed forecasts on
average since 2008, as the U.S. ended its worst recession in
seven decades and employers cut as many as 8.75 million workers.
Penn Capital Management says unexpected revenue growth shows the
economy is expanding enough that companies can stop firing
people and closing plants.  ‘Couldn’t Cut Anymore’  “You really did need top-line growth because the cost-
cutting got to where you couldn’t cut anymore,” said  Eric Green , a money manager at Penn Capital Management in
Philadelphia, which oversees $5.6 billion. “But you’re seeing
it now. Many companies are having that nice top-line growth, and
as that goes up, it should have a magnified effect on earnings.
It’s very positive for the equity markets.”  Global mergers and acquisitions increased to $668.3 billion
in the fourth quarter, the highest since the third quarter of
2008, according to data compiled by Bloomberg data. So far in
2011, $207.9 billion of transactions have been announced, with
54 percent from deals targeting U.S. companies.  Beckman Coulter surged 10 percent to $82.65. Danaher will
start a tender offer of $83.50 a share for all of Beckman
Coulter’s outstanding stock within seven days, Danaher said
today in a statement. The price represents a premium of about 45
percent to  Beckman Coulter ’s closing price on Dec. 9, the day
before speculation of a sale began, Danaher said.  Pride Surges  Pride International gained 16 percent to $39.80. Ensco said
it will acquire the Houston-based company for $41.60 a share in
cash and stock, creating the world’s second-largest offshore
drilling company.  Wesco rose 1.8 percent to $387.50. Berkshire won the
backing of Wesco’s board for a $547.6 million buyout. Buffett,
80, is seeking to simplify Berkshire’s holdings as he prepares
the company for an eventual change of leadership. Omaha,
Nebraska-based Berkshire has controlled Wesco for  more than 25
years . Buffett, Berkshire’s chairman and chief executive
officer, told Wesco in a letter that he wouldn’t proceed without
the approval of the firm’s independent directors.  Financial shares had the biggest gain of 10 industries in
the S&P 500, rising 1.5 percent as a group. American
International Group Inc. rallied 5.5 percent to $42.18.  Loews Rallies    Loews Corp . jumped 4.5 percent to $43.27. The holding
company run by New York’s Tisch family reported fourth-quarter
profit excluding some items of $1.17 a share, topping the
average analyst estimate by 34 percent, according to Bloomberg
data. CNA Financial Corp. rose 8.8 percent to $30.19. The
Chicago-based commercial insurer controlled by Loews posted
fourth-quarter earnings that beat analysts’ estimates and said
it resumed paying quarterly dividend at 10 cents a share.    Bank of America Corp . rose 2.7 percent to $14.67. The
biggest U.S. lender by assets said it extended more than $685
billion in credit to individuals, small businesses, nonprofits
and large companies in 2010. The bank extended $92 billion of
credit to small and medium-sized businesses, exceeding its goal
of $86 billion.    Genzyme Corp . gained 0.8 percent to $74.02. Sanofi-Aventis
SA is still examining the books of the biotechnology company as
it works toward a $19.2 billion takeover. Sanofi and Genzyme are
discussing a price of about $74 a share plus potential
additional payments tied to the performance of a Genzyme drug,
and the boards were slated to meet yesterday, four people with
knowledge of the plan said earlier. An announcement was possible
as early as today, they said.  ‘No Further Comment’  “As we have previously said, we’ve signed a
confidentiality agreement with Genzyme and are continuing to
review non-public information,” Jean-Marc Podvin, a spokesman
for Paris-based Sanofi, said in a telephone interview yesterday.
“We have no further comment.”    Chesapeake Energy Corp . advanced 4 percent to $31.27. The
most-active U.S. natural-gas driller intends to raise $5 billion
by selling its Fayetteville shale holdings and its stakes in two
companies. It will use the money to cut debt.  UBS AG boosted its year-end projection for the S&P 500 by
100 points to 1,425, as the outlook for the economy and earnings
improve. The previous estimate was for 1,325, the Zurich-based
firm said in a note today.  “Our upgrade is primarily driven by a reacceleration in
economic data, which should support stronger top- and bottom-
line growth,”  Jonathan Golub , chief U.S. market strategist,
wrote in the note. “While typically earnings surprises decline
as a recovery matures, current quarter results appear to show a
reacceleration.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
