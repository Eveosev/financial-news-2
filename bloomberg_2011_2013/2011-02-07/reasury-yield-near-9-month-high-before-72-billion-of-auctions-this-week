The difference in yield between 2-
and 30-year Treasuries shrank by the most in four days as the  Federal Reserve  prepares to buy longer-term debt tomorrow, the
second of three bond purchases by the central bank this week.  The Treasury 30-year bond yield declined for first time in
six days as the Fed prepared to purchase up to $2.5 billion in
Treasuries maturing between August 2028 and November 2040 as
part of its plan to bolster the economy. The yield on 10-year
securities earlier reached a nine-month high following the Feb.
4 report that showed U.S. unemployment fell to 9 percent in
January. Treasury plans to sell $72 billion in notes and bonds
during the next three days.  “The long bond caught a bid ahead of the long-end buyback
tomorrow, which has flattened the curve some,” said  Ian Lyngen ,
a government bond strategist at CRT Capital Group LLC in
Stamford,  Connecticut . “The Fed’s involvement and the higher-
yield levels there should drive demand at the week’s sales.”
The yield curve measures difference between yields of short- and
long-term maturities.  The 2-year to 30-year yield curve narrowed five basis points
to 3.94 percentage points at 5:02 p.m. in New York, after the
spread hit a record high of 4.02 percent on Feb. 1, according to
BGCantor Market Data.  10-Year Notes  Yields on 10-year notes increased one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 3.63 percent. It earlier reached 3.69
percent, the highest level since May 4. The price of the 2.625
percent security maturing in November 2020 decreased 1/32, or 31
cents per $1,000 face amount, to 91 22/32.  Two-year note yields advanced two basis points to 0.76
percent, after touching 0.79 percent, the highest level since
June 4.  The Fed bought $8.4 billion of U.S. securities due from
February 2018 to November 2020 today as part of its plan to buy
$600 billion in  U.S. debt  through June to spur the economy. On
Feb. 9 it plans to buy $6 billion to $8 billion of Treasuries
maturing between February 2015 and July 2016.  Global bonds have lost investors 0.5 percent this month,
according to indexes compiled by Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
The debt has dropped 2.6 percent since the end of August,
compared with a 22 percent rally for the MSCI All Country World
Index of stocks during the same period.  ‘Broken Out’  “Treasury rates have broken out of recent ranges and are
headed to higher yields,” said  William O’Donnell , head U.S.
government bond strategist at Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc’s
RBS Securities unit in  Stamford , Connecticut, one of 20 primary
dealers that trade with the Fed.  Treasuries 10-year notes closed above 3.57 percent on Feb.
4, signaling a “bearish breakout,” to higher yields, O’Donnell
wrote in a note to investors. “Friday’s range break in 10-year
notes confirmed that bearish impulses remain and that the
correction lows are not in yet.”  The Treasury will auction $32 billion of three-year notes
tomorrow, $24 billion of 10-year debt the next day and $16
billion of 30-year bonds on Feb. 10. The amounts match those of
the previous quarterly refunding in November.  U.S. unemployment unexpectedly dropped to 9 percent last
month from 9.4 percent in December, the Labor Department
reported Feb. 4. New applications for  unemployment benefits 
dropped during the week ended Feb. 5, according to the median
forecast in a separate survey before a Feb. 10 report from the
Labor Department.  Consumer Mood  The University of Michigan’s consumer-sentiment index may
increase to 75 this month from 74.2 in January, according to the
median forecast of 48 economists before the Feb. 11 report  Fund managers became more bearish on the outlook for
Treasuries through March, according to a weekly survey by Ried
Thunberg ICAP Inc. Ried’s sentiment index fell to 45 for the
seven days ended Feb. 4 from 49 the week before. A figure less
than 50 indicates investors expect prices to decline.  More than 40 percent of the  government bonds  the Fed bought
in January under quantitative easing was auctioned in the
previous 90 days, up from 20 percent in December and 15 percent
in November, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch. The Fed
is concentrating on newer securities as its $600 billion program
depletes primary dealers’ holdings of Treasuries to the lowest
since November 2009.  The Fed purchases are helping keep a lid on borrowing costs
for companies and homebuyers as the economy recovers. Yields on
corporate bonds have averaged about 4.84 percent since the
buying began in November, below the 5.48 percent for all of
2010, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
