The Australian and  New Zealand 
dollars strengthened against their U.S. counterpart as interest-
rate increases by China failed to quell investor appetite for
currencies linked to growth.  Australia’s dollar, called the Aussie, dropped briefly
versus the greenback after China,  Australia ’s largest trading
partner, raised interest rates for the third time since mid-
October to curb rising prices. It rebounded to trade at almost a
one-month high.  “Over the last 12 months when we saw Chinese rate hikes
we’ve seen commodity and some of the major currencies weaken
against the  U.S. dollar , but this particular move by the Chinese
authorities was very well anticipated,” said  Nick Bennenbroek ,
head of currency strategy at  Wells Fargo & Co . in  New York . “So
the impact that you have sometimes seen from Chinese monetary
tightening is not present today.”  Australia’s dollar appreciated 0.4 percent to $1.0180 at
11:29 a.m. in New York. It rose to as high as $1.0189, almost
the strongest level since Jan. 3, and dropped as much as 0.2
percent to $1.0115. It traded at 83.37 yen, down 0.1 percent,
from 83.44 yen yesterday. Earlier it advanced to 83.73 yen, the
strongest level since May 13.  New Zealand’s dollar strengthened 1 percent to 77.78 U.S.
cents and gained 0.5 percent to 63.69 yen, from 63.39.  China’s benchmark one-year lending rate will increase to
6.06 percent from 5.81 percent, effective tomorrow, the People’s
Bank of  China  said on its website today. The one-year deposit
rate will rise to 3 percent from 2.75 percent.  Confidence Rises  The Aussie earlier rose to a nine-month high against the
yen after a private survey showed Australian business sentiment
rebounded in January as concern receded over the impact of
flooding that devastated the state of Queensland.  The index increased to 4, its first advance since August,
from negative 3 in December, according to a National Australia
Bank Ltd. survey of more than 400 companies from Jan. 27 to Feb.
4 that was released today.  The New Zealand dollar briefly pared gains after Prime
Minister John Key said his government’s commitment to spending
restraint is intended to take pressure off  interest rates  and
keep the currency from rising to a level that hurts exports.  To contact the reporters on this story:
