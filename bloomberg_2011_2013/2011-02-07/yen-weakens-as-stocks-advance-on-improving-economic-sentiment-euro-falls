The yen fell against most of its
major peers as rising stock markets led investors to sell
securities denominated in the Japanese currency in favor of
higher-yielding assets.  The Japanese currency slid against the dollar for a fourth
day as European stocks rose on optimism the recovery in the
global economy is strengthening. The U.S. unemployment rate
unexpectedly dropped to 9 percent last month from 9.4 percent in
December, the Labor Department said on Feb. 4. Employers added
36,000 workers, less than the median forecast for 146,000. The
euro fell against the dollar, erasing an earlier gain, as a
report showed German factory orders fell more than forecast in
December.  “While rates everywhere else are likely to go up, people
don’t expect Japanese rates to follow,”  Paul Robson , a senior
foreign exchange strategist at Royal Bank of Scotland Plc in  London , said. “The yen has just been caught out by rate spreads
and reviving risk appetite with people looking through some of
the weather distortions on payrolls and seeing that as a
positive for the global environment.”  Japan’s currency weakened 0.2 percent to 82.35 per dollar,
as of 11:39 a.m. in London. The yen was little changed at 111.63
per euro. The euro traded 0.2 lower at $1.3554.  To contact the reporter on this story:
