Japan’s stocks gained for a second
day after earnings increased and the U.S. unemployment rate
unexpectedly fell, strengthening confidence in the global
economic recovery.  Toyota Motor Corp., the world’s largest carmaker, rose 0.9
percent. Credit Saison Co., a consumer lender, and Ebara Corp.,
a pump maker, surged at least 8.7 percent after they boosted
profit forecasts. Mizuho Financial Group Inc., Japan’s No. 3
bank by market value and the biggest share holder of Credit
Saison, rose 1.2 percent. Yokogawa Electric Corp., a maker of
electronic measuring tools, leapt 7.6 percent after its share-
price estimate was raised at Nomura Holdings Inc.  “Employment and corporate earnings are steadily improving
in the U.S., and the market has a bright outlook on the
economy,” said  Masaru Hamasaki , who helps oversee about $17
billion in Tokyo as chief strategist at Toyota Asset Management
Co. “Japanese companies’ earnings are also strong so far and
confidence is increasing.”  The Nikkei 225 Stock Average rose 0.5 percent to 10,592.04
at the 3 p.m. close in Tokyo. The broader Topix index gained 0.5
percent to 940.43 with more than three stocks advancing for each
that fell. Both gauges reached the highest levels since May 13.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index were little
changed today. The index advanced 0.3 percent on Feb. 4 in  New
York  to its highest close since June 2008 after the Labor
Department said the U.S. unemployment rate fell to 9 percent in
January from 9.4 percent in December. Economists surveyed by
Bloomberg had expected an increase to 9.5 percent.  U.S. Employment  “Employment in the U.S. is improving steadily, although
the pace is slow,” said  Tomochika Kitaoka , a senior strategist
in Tokyo at Mizuho Securities Co. “If employment keeps
recovering, even if the pace is slow, a sense of security in a
cyclical recovery of the  U.S. economy  will start to spread.”  The Topix has risen 4.6 percent this year, compared with
gains of 4.2 percent by the S&P 500 and 3.7 percent by the Stoxx
Europe 600 Index. Stocks in the Japanese benchmark were valued
at 16.1 times estimated earnings on average, compared with 13.7
times for the  S&P 500  and 11.3 times for the Stoxx 600.  Toyota gained 0.9 percent to 3,490 yen and was the second-
largest single contributor to the Topix’s gain. Hitachi Ltd.,
Japan’s third-largest listed company by revenue, climbed 2.3
percent to 498 yen, the highest since November 2008. Toshiba
Corp., a maker of electronics and power equipment that gets more
than half of its revenue abroad, rose 1.2 percent to 523 yen.  Yen Weakens  The yen depreciated to as low as 82.29 against the dollar
today in Tokyo, compared with 81.58 at the close of  stock
trading  in Tokyo on Feb. 4. Against the euro, Japan’s currency
weakened to 112.02 from 111.24. A weaker yen boosts the value of
overseas income at Japanese companies when converted into their
home currency.  Credit Saison surged 8.7 percent to 1,594 yen and had the
third-biggest increase in the Nikkei. The consumer lender
boosted its net income forecast for the year ending March 31 by
38 percent to 16.5 billion yen ($200 million).  Ebara jumped 14 percent to 450 yen, the biggest gain in the
Nikkei. The pump maker projected full-year net income will more
than double to 11 billion yen. That’s 22 percent higher than its
previous forecast.  Sega Sammy Holdings Inc., a maker of video-game and
pachinko machines, advanced 3 percent to 1,796 yen, its highest
close since July 2007. The company said net income for the
April-December period more than doubled to 36.8 billion yen from
16.9 billion yen a year ago.  Banks Advance  Banks were the biggest contributors to the Topix’s gain.
Mizuho rose 1.2 percent to 164 yen. Mitsubishi UFJ Financial
Group Inc., Japan’s largest publicly traded bank, rose 1.6
percent to 447 yen. Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc., the
second-biggest bank, climbed 0.7 percent to 2,909 yen.  Yokogawa Electric leapt 7.6 percent to 720 yen after Nomura
increased its share-price estimate on the stock to 770 yen from
680 yen. Yamaha Corp., a maker of musical instruments, gained
1.7 percent to 1,110 yen as Tachibana Securities increased its
rating on the company to “strong outperform” from
“outperform.” Kobe Steel Ltd., a steelmaker, advanced 0.9
percent to 224 yen after the company was boosted to
“outperform” from “neutral” at Daiwa Securities Group Inc.  Today, 88 of the 1,668 companies in the Topix index were
scheduled to release earnings statements. Of the 976 that have
reported results since Jan. 1 for the latest quarter, 133 have
exceeded analysts’ estimates, while 95 have missed them,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
