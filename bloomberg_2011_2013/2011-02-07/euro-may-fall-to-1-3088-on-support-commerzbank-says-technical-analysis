The euro may weaken to as low as
$1.3088 should it break below a key support level against the
U.S. currency, Commerzbank AG said, citing technical indicators.  “Euro-dollar sold off at the end of last week,”  Karen Jones , head of fixed-income, commodity and currency  technical
analysis  at Commerzbank in London, wrote in an e-mailed report
today. “We suspect that this market has topped near-term just
ahead of much tougher resistance at $1.3978 and $1.40.”  The first level represents the 78.6 percent Fibonacci
retracement of the euro’s decline against the dollar from Nov. 4
to Jan. 10, while $1.40 is a psychological resistance level,
Jones said in a telephone interview.  “A close below the Jan. 31 low at $1.3571 will confirm the
move lower and leave the market under pressure to sell off to
the 55-day moving average at $1.3326, then the 200-day moving
average at $1.3088,” Jones said.  The euro fell 0.1 percent to $1.3572 as of 10:38 a.m. in  London .  A support level is an area on a chart where technical
analysts anticipate orders to buy a currency and its related
instruments. The stronger the support, the more selling is
needed for a drop below that level. Fibonacci analysis is based
on the theory that prices rise or fall by certain percentages
after reaching a high or low.  To contact the reporter on this story:
