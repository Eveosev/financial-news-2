Arabian Construction Co., an Abu
Dhabi-based firm, and  Simplex Infrastructures Ltd . have secured
a contract to build  India ’s tallest tower.  World One, a 117-story building in Mumbai, will be the
second tallest residential building in the world with a height
of 442 meters (1,450 feet) when it’s completed in 2015, the
company, known as  ACC , said in an e-mailed statement yesterday.  The residential tower, designed by the New York City
architectural firm  Pei Cobb Freed and Partners , includes private
pools, home theaters, outdoor Jacuzzis, an elevated park and an
observatory lounge at a height of 305 meters, the company said.  Construction firms in the  United Arab Emirates  are
searching for new markets after the global credit crisis caused
a property boom in the federation to burst. ACC, which built
some of the U.A.E.’s tallest buildings, is working on the
construction of the tallest building in  Jordan .  Simplex has built landmarks in India such as the Supreme
Court building and is working on the construction of the first
Ritz Carlton hotel in India, ACC said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
