A furnace at  Vale SA ’s Copper Cliff
nickel smelter in  Canada  was shut for the second time this year
because of a faulty wall, a company spokeswoman said.  Liquid metal, or matte, leaked when a tapping block on the
northeast wall of Flash Furnace Two failed yesterday morning at
the site in Sudbury, about 200 miles (320 kilometers) north of
Toronto, said Angie Robson.  Furnace One, shut yesterday as a precaution, was being
brought back into production today, and there were no injuries,
Robson said.  “We’re currently working to determine the cause of the
failure and the extent of the impact,” she said. “We don’t
know at this point how long the furnace will be down.”  She couldn’t say how much matte leaked and declined to give
daily production levels at the plant.  The south wall in the same unit ruptured on Jan. 1,
knocking out the furnace for three weeks, she said.  Both of the smelter’s furnaces were built in the early
1990s as part of a sulfur dioxide abatement program and are
usually re-built about every five years, Robson said. The last
re-build of unit two was in 2007.  Vale, the world’s largest iron-ore producer, acquired
Canadian nickel miner Inco Ltd. in January 2007. The C$19.4
billion ($19.6 billion) deal was the biggest foreign acquisition
by a Brazilian company.  Last week, Vale, based in  Rio de Janeiro , and the United
Steelworkers Union, signed a five-year collective agreement to
end an 18-month strike at the Voisey’s Bay nickel mine in the
Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador.  To contact the reporter on this story:
