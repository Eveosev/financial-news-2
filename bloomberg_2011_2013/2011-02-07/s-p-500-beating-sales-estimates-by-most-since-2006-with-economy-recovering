More U.S. companies are exceeding
sales forecasts than any time in four years, helping extend the
biggest stock-market rally since 1936.    Caterpillar Inc . and  United Parcel Service Inc ., barometers
for the economy because of their building and delivery
businesses, are among the 71 percent of Standard & Poor’s 500
Index companies that reported more revenue last quarter than
analysts estimated, the largest proportion since at least 2006,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Sales beat projections
by an average 2.2 percent, the most in two years, the data show.  While U.S. earnings have surpassed Wall Street estimates
for seven straight quarters, sales have trailed forecasts on
average since 2008, as the U.S. ended its worst recession in
seven decades and employers cut as many as 8.75 million workers.
Bank of America Corp. and Penn Capital Management say unexpected
revenue growth shows the economy is expanding enough that
companies can stop firing people and closing plants.  “You really did need top-line growth because the cost-
cutting got to where you couldn’t cut any more,” said  Eric Green , a money manager at Penn Capital Management in
Philadelphia, which oversees $5.6 billion. “But you’re seeing
it now. Many companies are having that nice top-line growth, and
as that goes up, it should have a magnified effect on earnings.
It’s very positive for the equity markets.”  Manufacturing Growth  Strengthening global economic growth and higher-than-
estimated earnings have pushed the S&P 500 up 29 percent since
July 2, its 2010 low. The index topped 1,300 on Feb. 1, a 31-
month high, after reports showed U.S. manufacturing accelerated
at the fastest pace since May 2004 last month and  consumer
spending  exceeded forecasts.  The S&P 500 rose 0.6 percent at 4 p.m. in New York as
takeover announcements bolstered investor optimism. The  Dow
Jones Industrial Average  advanced for the sixth straight day,
the longest streak since November.  Stocks gained last week, sending the S&P 500 up 2.7 percent
to 1,310.87 as the U.S.  unemployment rate  slipped to 9 percent,
the lowest level since April 2009. Companies added 36,000
workers in January, the fewest in four months, as winter storms
kept job seekers at home. The  S&P 500  has surged 94 percent
since March 2009, the biggest advance for a comparable period
since 1936, according to  Howard Silverblatt , an index analyst
for S&P in New York.  Worst Since 1930s  Total revenue for S&P 500 companies may rise 7.5 percent
this year, the most since 2007, to an all-time high of $1,017.44
a share, according to analyst estimates compiled through Feb. 6
by Bloomberg. Sales fell 13 percent between November 2008 and
October 2009 as the worst U.S. recession since the 1930s forced
businesses and consumers to cut back on spending.  “The market has been saying with a pretty clear signal
since the August lows that double-dip fears were misplaced, that
we were set to see a reacceleration in economic activity in
2011, and I think all of that is true,” said Scott Migliori,
the San Francisco-based U.S. chief investment officer at RCM, a
unit of Allianz Global Investors that oversees more than $145
billion. “The market has already told us that the economy is
going to grow pretty robustly in 2011.”    David Bianco , the chief U.S. equity strategist at Bank of
America, says faster-than-estimated sales means corporate
expense reductions aimed at propping up earnings may be ending,
with demand for goods and services increasing.  Lehman Brothers  Since the start of the third quarter of 2008, when Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc. filed the largest bankruptcy in U.S.
history, sales for S&P 500 companies have missed estimates by an
average of 0.1 percent, while earnings have surpassed forecasts
by 2.9 percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The fourth
quarter was the first time since 2008 that the average sales
surprise reached 2 percent, the data show.  “Fourth-quarter results are coming in strong on all
measures,” Bianco, who estimates the S&P 500 will climb to
1,400 by the end of the year, wrote in a Jan. 31 report.
“Better-than-expected sales growth means earnings growth is
being driven not by cost-cutting, but by improving demand.”  The sales recovery may spur hiring, Migliori said. The
world’s largest economy will grow 3.1 percent in 2011 and 3.2
percent in 2012, the most over two years since 2004 and 2005,
according to the median estimates of more than 50 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg.  ‘Highly Correlated’  “Sales tends to be highly correlated to economic
activity,” said Greg Woodard, a strategist at Manning & Napier
in Fairport,  New York , which manages about $36 billion.
“Growing revenue is very important for companies. You’re
starting to see that transition away from cost-cutting on the
quarterly reports, and we’re starting to see the very early
signs of hiring, and that’s a positive signal.”  Caterpillar, the world’s largest maker of construction
equipment, said it added about 19,000 jobs last year, including
a 15 percent increase in the U.S. The Peoria, Illinois-based
company beat analysts’ projections for fourth-quarter sales by
11 percent, the most since 2008. The shares gained 64 percent
last year and closed at an all-time high of $100.47 today.  “We’ve become somewhat more positive about economic growth
in the developed economies,”  Mike DeWalt , Caterpillar’s
director of  investor relations , said during a Jan. 27 call with
analysts. “2010 was the first year of sustained recovery from a
tough year in 2009. 2011 looks better, and we’re expecting
record profits.”  Slow Recovery  Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said last month
that the decline in the unemployment rate is likely to be slow
even with a pickup in U.S. growth in 2011, adding that “it
could take four to five more years for the job market to
normalize fully.”  The S&P 500 has climbed 26 percent since Bernanke indicated
in August that he would buy Treasuries to boost the economy. The
rally sent 82 percent of U.S. companies’ shares above their 200-
day average on Jan. 18, the most since April 15, according to
New York Stock Exchange data compiled by Bloomberg. When that
happened in April, the index began a 16 percent decline.  Greenwood Capital Associates’  Walter Todd  says the stock
market may retreat because operating margins have climbed so
high it suggests companies have few expenses left to cut. Even
with sales beating estimates, profitability may narrow, slowing
earnings growth, he said.  Margins Expand  The S&P 500’s operating margin had its biggest annual
increase in eight years during 2010 as executives reduced jobs
and U.S. worker productivity increased by 3.6 percent, the most
since 2002, Labor Department data show. Operating margins
reached 19.8 percent on average in November, the highest level
since 2007. Excluding financial companies, the 2010 margin
exceeded the 2006 peak, according to Bank of America’s Bianco.  “Looking at individual reports, you start to see the
margins problem arise, and that creates problems,” said Todd,
who helps manage about $900 million. “That sets up the
opportunity for a pullback.”  Industrial shares in the S&P 500 including Caterpillar have
collectively gained 37 percent since July 2 for the third-
biggest gain among the index’s 10 main industries, behind energy
and material stocks.  The  Institute for Supply Management ’s factory index rose to
60.8 in January, the highest level since May 2004, according to
a Feb. 1 report from the Tempe, Arizona-based group. That
exceeded the most optimistic forecast in a Bloomberg News survey
of economists. Readings greater than 50 signal growth.  Housing Uptick    General Motors Co ., the automaker that emerged from
bankruptcy in July 2009, said on Feb. 1 that U.S. sales last
month rose 22 percent, more than analysts estimated. The
Detroit-based company plans to add a third shift and about 750
jobs to its assembly plant in Flint, Michigan, to meet rising
demand for pickups “because we’ve been encouraged by the uptick
in housing starts and construction projects across  Michigan  and
across the country,”  Mark Reuss , president of GM North America,
told reporters and workers at the plant on Jan. 24.  The shares have climbed 11 percent since GM’s initial
public offering on Nov. 17.  “You’re definitely going to see an increase in hiring in
almost every industry this year,” said Green, who expects the
unemployment rate to fall to about 7 percent by the end of the
year. “Usually after a recession and difficult times, it takes
a period of adjustment, cost-cutting and cash-hoarding. As
demand goes up, you need to have employees working.”  Record High  UPS shares rallied to $74.59 on Feb. 1, the highest price
since April 2008, after the world’s largest package-delivery
company said adjusted profit jumped 44 percent to $1.08 a share
in the fourth quarter and sales climbed 8.4 percent to $13.4
billion, both topping analysts’ forecasts. The Atlanta-based
company cited more online shopping during the holidays.  U.S. consumer spending, which accounts for about 70 percent
of the economy, increased at a higher-than-forecast rate of 0.7
percent in December, Commerce Department data showed on Jan. 31.
Gross domestic product rose at a 3.2 percent annual rate in the
last three months of 2010, bringing the volume of all goods and
services produced to $13.38 trillion and surpassing the pre-
recession peak reached in the fourth quarter of 2007.  At  Google Inc ., the owner of the world’s most popular
search engine, executives are preparing for the biggest year of
employee growth in the company’s history. Google, which plans to
hire at least 6,000 people, posted revenue that beat forecasts
by 5.1 percent on Jan. 21, Bloomberg data show. The company got
more than 75,000 applications in the last week of January, a
record, spokesman Aaron Zamost said on Feb. 3.  DuPont, the biggest U.S. chemical maker by stock-market
value, raised its 2011 profit forecast on Jan. 25 and reported
higher-than-estimated earnings and sales. Shares of the
Wilmington, Delaware-based company have risen 6.9 percent this
year as Chief Executive Officer Ellen Kullman invests in
industrial enzymes, solar energy and modified seeds.  “As the global economy recovers, we drove volume and price
up in all major regions of the world,” Nicholas Fanandakis, the
chief financial officer of DuPont, said in an earnings
conference call on Jan. 25. “If this was a video conference,
you’d see me sitting here with all smiles.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
