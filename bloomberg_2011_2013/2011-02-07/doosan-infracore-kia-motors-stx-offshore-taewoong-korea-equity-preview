Shares of the following companies had
unusual moves in South Korea trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses, and prices are as of the 3 p.m. close in  Seoul .  The  Kospi Index  fell 12.04, or 0.6 percent, to 2,069.70.  Shipbuilders: Samsung Heavy Industries Co. (010140 KS) lost

STX Offshore & Shipbuilding Co. (067250 KS) dropped 7.3 percent
to 32,250 won. The shares declined after the Financial Times
newspaper reported Japanese shipbuilders are calling on their
government to counter the so-called cheap currency advantage of
their South Korean rivals.  “The report about Japanese shipyards as well as recent
gains in Korean shipyards seem to have triggered some profit-
taking today,” said Song Seong Yeob, a  fund manager  at KB Asset
Management Co. in Seoul.  Doosan Infracore Co. (042670 KS),  South Korea ’s largest
construction-equipment maker, gained 3.9 percent to 30,950 won.
The company was raised to “overweight” from “neutral” at
JPMorgan Chase & Co.  Korea Petrochemical Industrial Co. (006650 KS), a chemical
products maker, lost 5 percent to 104,000 won, after reporting
explosions at its plant in Ulsan, South Korea. The drop was the
most since July 1.  Taewoong Co. (044490 KS), a South Korean maker of parts for
wind power plants, added 1.2 percent to 51,500 won, after
rallying as much as 6.3 percent earlier. The U.S. government
identified four locations for offshore wind projects, a move
that may accelerate the development of renewable energy
projects. Interior Secretary  Ken Salazar  and Energy Secretary
Steven Chu announced the Wind Energy Areas, along the coasts of  New Jersey , Delaware, Maryland and Virginia, during a conference
call.  To contact the reporter on this story:
