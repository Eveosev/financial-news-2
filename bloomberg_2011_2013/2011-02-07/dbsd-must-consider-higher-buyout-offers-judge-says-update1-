DBSD North America Inc., a satellite-
communications company, has an obligation to its creditors to
consider any offers that are better than one from  Dish Network

Reisman, a lawyer for DBSDâ€™s creditors, said a third party was
interested, without disclosing who the potential bidder is.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
