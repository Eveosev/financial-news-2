South Africa will aim to “correct”
laws governing mining rights by year-end after  Lonmin Plc  and  Impala Platinum Holdings Ltd . disputed the award of licenses.  Impala and Lonmin, the world’s second- and third-largest
platinum producers, have challenged the award of permits to a
unit of Holgoun Group for land where they say they already hold
rights. Holgoun is part-owned by Sivi Gounden, a former
director-general of public enterprises in South Africa.  An overlap in rights at Lonmin’s property occurred because
of a “weakness” in the law, Shabangu said today in a speech in
Cape Town. “As part of the review we’ve got to revisit that
particular area and correct that particular area,” she said,
adding that the state won’t alter mining rights already granted.  Disputes over mine licensing in South Africa have affected  Anglo American Plc ’s Kumba Iron Ore unit and Imperial Crown
Trading Ltd. over the past year, as well as Lonmin and Impala.
The government placed a six-month moratorium on the award of
prospecting rights, effective Sept. 1, to audit the system,
after suspending three ministry officials for maladministration.  Shabangu expects to lift the moratorium in March, she said
today. The world’s largest platinum producer is  Anglo Platinum
Ltd .  To contact the reporter on this story:
