Top-ranked tennis player  Rafael Nadal 
was named sportsman of the year at the 2011 Laureus World Sports
Awards Ceremony in Abu Dhabi today. Olympic downhill skiing
champion  Lindsey Vonn  of the U.S. took the sportswomen’s award.  Spain’s Nadal won the French Open, Wimbledon and the  U.S.
Open  last year before losing in the Australian Open
quarterfinals last month. He was seeking to become the first man
to hold all four major titles simultaneously since  Rod Laver  in
1969.  Vonn, currently going for her fourth consecutive overall
World Cup title, is in second place behind Maria Riesch of
Germany.  The winners were voted by the Laureus World Sports Academy,
a panel made up of 46 leading sportsmen and sportswomen
including  Franz Beckenbauer , Jack Nicklaus and Dawn Fraser, the
organizers said in a release. Proceeds from the awards underpin
the Laureus Sport for Good Foundation, which supports 83
community sports projects around the world, they added.     To contact the editor responsible for this story:
