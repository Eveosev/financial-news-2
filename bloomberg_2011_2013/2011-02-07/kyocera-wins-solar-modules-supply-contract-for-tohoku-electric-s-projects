  Kyocera Corp ., a Japanese maker of
electronic components, won a contract to supply solar modules
for two Tohoku Electric Power Co. projects in northern Japan.  Kyocera will provide 2 megawatts of modules to Tohoku
Electric’s solar-power plant in Miyagi prefecture and 1 megawatt
to another in Aomori prefecture, Kyoto-based Kyocera said today
in a statement. The two projects will together supply 3.7
megawatt-hours of electricity a year, enough for 1,100
households, the company said.  The plants will also reduce carbon dioxide emissions by a
combined 1,800 metric tons, according to the statement. Kyocera
didn’t provide financial details. The plants are expected to
begin operations in January 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
