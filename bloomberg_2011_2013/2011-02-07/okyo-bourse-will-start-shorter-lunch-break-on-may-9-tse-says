The Tokyo Stock Exchange will shorten
its lunch break beginning May 9, Satoshi Mimura, a spokesman for
the Tokyo exchange, said by telephone today.  The Tokyo bourse will cut its lunch break by 30 minutes if
testing of the new schedule goes as planned, Mimura said. The
TSE announced in November that it planned to extend trading
hours by starting the lunch break at 11:30 a.m. instead of 11
a.m. Osaka Securities Exchange Co., the operator of Japan’s
biggest market for startups, also said on Jan. 25 it will
shorten its lunch break by 30 minutes starting in May.  “We have sent notices to market players that we plan to
cut the lunch break and expand trading hours from May 9 after
system tests are done,” Mimura said. “If the process goes
smoothly, we will shorten the lunch break.”  Overseas exchanges have been extending their trading hours
as competition intensifies in the region. Hong Kong Exchanges &
Clearing Ltd. said on Jan. 24 it won approval to cut its lunch
break to 90 minutes from two hours from March 7, while Singapore
Exchange Ltd., operator of the city’s derivatives and securities
market, decided to scrap its midday trading break from March.  “In Japan, trading tends to focus around the beginning and
end of trading sessions, so extending the hours probably won’t
boost volume,” said Naoki Fujiwara, who helps oversee $6
billion in Tokyo at Shinkin Asset Management Co.  To contact the reporters on this story:
