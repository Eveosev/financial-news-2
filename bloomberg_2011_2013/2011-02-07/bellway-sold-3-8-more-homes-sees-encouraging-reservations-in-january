  Bellway Plc , a U.K. homebuilder
specializing in first-time buyers, said it sold 3.8 percent more
homes in its fiscal first half as the housing market showed
signs of recovery.  The total climbed to 2,332 in the six months through
January from 2,247 a year earlier, the Newcastle, England-based
company said today in a statement. The average selling price
increased 8 percent to about 168,000 pounds ($271,000).  U.K. house prices unexpectedly rose in January as fewer
owners put properties on the market, according to a report last
week from Halifax, the mortgage unit of Lloyds Banking Group
Plc. The government should pressure retail banks to increase
mortgage lending to alleviate a “very very challenging” market
for first-time buyers, Bellway Finance Director Alistair Leitch
said today in a telephone interview.  “They might need to sit in a dark room and thrash
something out, some sort of incentive,” he said. “Clearly not
all first-time buyers have the bank of mum and dad behind them
or 15,000 to 20,000 pounds sitting around waiting for a deposit
to be put on something.”  Last week, Prime Minister  David Cameron  told lawmakers in
the House of Commons that he’s certain that banks will meet his
coalition government’s demands on reducing bonuses and
increasing lending.  Shares Rise  Bellway rose as much as 4 percent to 665 pence in London
and closed up 2.8 percent at 657.5 pence, giving the company a
market value of 795 million pounds.  Panmure Gordon & Co analysts  Mark Hughes  and Rachael Waring
maintained their “buy” recommendation for the stock with a
target price 737 pence, saying that Bellway’s share price
doesn’t reflect its net asset value.  Operating profit margin increased by about 100 basis points
in the first half from 6.1 percent a year earlier, Bellway said
in the statement. For the six months through July, the margin
may reach as much as 10 percent and will be at least 9.5
percent, Leitch said. The company predicted a margin in the
“low to mid-teens” in fiscal 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
