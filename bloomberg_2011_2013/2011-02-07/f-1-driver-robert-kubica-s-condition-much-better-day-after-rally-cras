Lotus Renault Formula One driver  Robert Kubica ’s general condition is “much better,” a day
after he crashed in a rally in  Italy , his team said in a
statement.  The 26-year-old Pole crashed in the Ronde di Andora Rally,
suffering multiple fractures. He was airlifted to hospital and
later placed in an induced coma after surgery on his hand.  “He was briefly woken up by the doctors of the Santa
Corona Hospital (Pietra Ligure) this morning. The Lotus Renault
GP driver was then able to talk to his relatives. He was also
able to move his fingers, which is encouraging for the rest of
his recovery process,” the team said.  The team added that Mario Igor Rossello, Director for the
Regional Centre of Hand Surgery at San Paolo Hospital in Savona,
“did not notice any swelling or infection on his right forearm,
and this is another good sign, although it will be several days
before it is known if the operation has been 100 percent
successful.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
