Mohamed Kamel, chief executive
officer of the Red Sea resort builder  Egyptian Resorts Co ., said
he was optimistic that tourism in  Egypt  would rebound because
the industry has proved resilient to crises in the past.  “People are now looking at Egypt as a more competitive
destination because of the  exchange rate ,” Kamel said in a
telephone interview. “And during crises, more concessions are
made to tourists to get business jumpstarted.”  Kamel added that it was too early to gauge the impact on
the company’s land sales and that Egyptian Resorts is assessing
the situation. “The tourism industry has to pick up first,” he
said.  Protests demanding an end to President Hosni Mubarak’s 30-
year rule erupted Jan. 25 in Cairo and have left as many as 300
people dead, according to the  United Nations . Egypt’s  tourism
industry  lost $1.5 billion during the unrest, the state-run
Middle East News Agency reported on Feb. 5.  Egyptian Resorts owns a 41 million square-meter (441
million square-feet) plot of land 22 kilometers (14 miles) south
of Hurghada on Egypt’s Red Sea coast. The company develops the
land with infrastructure such as water, electricity and
communication links, and sells it to sub-developers in the
hospitality or in the second-home business.  The Egyptian pound dropped 2.2 percent since the start of
the crisis to 5.95 against the dollar.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
