The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
voted to switch the assessment base for its  reserve fund  to
deposits from assets, shifting the burden for protecting
customers against  bank failures  toward larger lenders.  The rule, part of a joint-agency rulemaking requirement
under the Dodd-Frank Act, was approved by the FDIC board in a
unanimous vote at a meeting in  Washington  today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
