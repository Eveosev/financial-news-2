The U.S. government identified four
locations for offshore wind projects, a move that may accelerate
the development of renewable energy projects.  Interior Secretary  Ken Salazar  and Energy Secretary Steven
Chu announced the Wind Energy Areas, along the coasts of  New
Jersey , Delaware, Maryland and  Virginia , during a conference
call today.  Under the program, the Interior Department’s Bureau of
Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement will conduct
environmental reviews for the four areas and, if no significant
issues are identified, may issue leases to energy developers by
the end of this year.  The two agencies introduced in December a similar program
to fast-track the development of solar energy plants at 24 sites
on federal land.  The initiative will “quickly stand up an American offshore
wind industry,” Salazar said in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
