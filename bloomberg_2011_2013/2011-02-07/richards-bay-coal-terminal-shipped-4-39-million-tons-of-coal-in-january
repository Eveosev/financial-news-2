  Richards Bay  Coal Terminal Ltd.,
Africa’s largest export facility for the fuel, shipped 10
percent less coal in January compared with a year earlier after
derailments and heavy rains disrupted rail operations.  The Richards Bay terminal shipped 4.39 million metric tons
of coal last month compared with 4.87 million tons in January
last year and 6.15 million in December, Richards Bay Coal
Terminal, on South Africa’s northeastern coast, said in a report
posted on its  website . By the end of January this year it had
stock of 1.76 million tons, it said.  Heavy rain since December in South Africa derailed trains,
flooded crops and added to coal producers’ problems in
Australia, where floods have shut mines in Queensland. South
Africa declared 28 municipalities across seven of its nine
provinces disaster areas last month with most of the country
receiving almost double its normal rainfall.  Asia overtook Europe as South Africa’s largest coal
shipping destination in 2009 as economies in the East grew
faster than in Europe. South Africa shipped 59 percent of the
total to Asia last year and a quarter to Europe. India bought
almost a third of Richards Bay’s exports last year.  Owners of RBCT include  BHP Billiton Ltd ., the world’s
biggest mining company,  Xstrata Plc  and  Anglo American Plc .  To contact the reporter on this story:
