Tshipi e Ntle Manganese Mining (Pty)
Ltd., a mine developer in  South Africa  controlled by black
investors, agreed to invest 1.45 billion rand ($200 million) to
develop a manganese mine in the nation’s Northern Cape province.  Construction of the Tshipi Borwa mine, near the town of
Hotazel, will begin in the first half and ore production will
start within 18 months, the company said today in a statement.
Tshipi e Ntle expects annual output of 2.4 million metric tons
for at least 60 years, and a possible expansion to 5 million
tons should “economic circumstances” allow, it said.  Tshipi e Ntle is 50.1 percent held by Ntsimbintle Mining, a
group led by black investors and charities and chaired by Saki Macozoma, deputy chairman of Standard Bank Group Ltd.,  Africa ’s
largest lender. Singapore-based  OM Holdings Ltd . is a
shareholder in Ntsimbintle and will market some of the new
mine’s output, according to the statement.  Jupiter Mines Ltd., an Australian manganese and iron-ore
developer, holds the balance in Tshipi e Ntle. Manganese is used
to toughen steel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
