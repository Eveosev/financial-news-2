The premiums for Light Louisiana
Sweet and Heavy Louisiana Sweet crudes rose to the highest
levels against West  Texas  Intermediate since at least 1991 as
the U.S. benchmark fell against its European counterpart.  The spread between March-delivery futures for WTI and
Brent, the basis for European and West African crudes, increased
97 cents to a record $11.77 a barrel. A larger premium for Brent
makes imports to the Gulf Coast more expensive than U.S. grades.  “The bottleneck at Cushing is depressing the price of WTI
because it’s landlocked,” said Sung Yoo, an analyst with
JPMorgan Chase & Co. “WTI is trading at a discount relative to
all the other global crudes.”  Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium strengthened 70 cents to
$13.50 a barrel at 2:12 p.m. in New York, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg, the widest gap since 1991 when Bloomberg
began collecting the data. Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium to
WTI increased 50 cents to $12.50 a barrel.    Gulf Coast  sour, or high-sulfur, grades also increased
relative to WTI. Mars Blend’s premium strengthened $1 to $7.75 a
barrel, while Poseidon increased 85 cents to $7.85 over the
benchmark. Southern Green Canyon’s premium rose 25 cents to $6 a
barrel.  Thunder Horse’s premium to WTI strengthened 65 cents to
$11.50, the highest level in Bloomberg data going back two
years. West Texas Sour’s discount widened 10 cents to $5.40. WTS
is delivered in Midland, Texas, so its price is less influenced
by imports.  Canadian Crudes Weaken  Canadian crudes weakened after  Enbridge Inc . shut its Line
6B that transports oil from Griffith, Indiana, to Sarnia,
Ontario, for about five days of planned repairs.  Seven pipeline segments will be replaced during the work
that started today, Lorraine Grymala, a company spokeswoman,
said in an e-mail. The 290,000-barrel-a-day line will also be
shut starting March 7 for five days to replace another seven
segments.  Syncrude weakened 50 cents to a premium of $4.50 to WTI.
Syncrude is a light, low-sulfur synthetic oil derived from the  tar sands  in  Alberta . The discount for Western Canada Select
widened 10 cents to $25.50 a barrel.  Enbridge began operating its Spearhead crude oil pipeline
at reduced rates during daylight hours while it performs
maintenance that started Feb. 3, Larry Springer, a company
spokesman, said in a phone interview last week.  The pipeline operator expects to meet all customer
shipments in February, according to the Houston-based Springer.
The work is scheduled to last six days, he said.  The Spearhead pipeline, which spans 657 miles (1,058
kilometers) from  Chicago  to Cushing,  Oklahoma , is running at
normal rates at night, according to Springer.  To contact the reporter on this story:  Aaron Clark  in  New York  at
