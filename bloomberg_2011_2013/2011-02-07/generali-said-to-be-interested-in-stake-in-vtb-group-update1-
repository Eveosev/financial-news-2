  Assicurazioni Generali SpA  may buy
about 1 percent of VTB Group, Russia’s second-largest lender,
for about $300 million, said a person with knowledge of the
situation.  Italy’s biggest insurer expressed its interest in buying
the stock through a planned share sale of a 10 percent stake of
the bank owned by the Russian government, said the person, who
asked not be identified because the talks are private.  Russia will start the sale of its 10 percent stake in VTB
today, an official in the government’s press service said on
Feb. 4. The government hired Deutsche Bank AG, Merrill Lynch and
VTB Capital for the sale and doesn’t intend to sell another
stake in the Moscow-based lender for at least three months after
the deal is completed, the official said.  A Generali official at the company’s Trieste headquarters
declined to comment. A VTB spokesman in Moscow said the outcome
of the presentation to investors may be known by Feb. 11,
declining to comment on Generali’s bid. Generali may become a
strategic investor in the company, newspaper Vedomosti reported
today, citing two unidentified people working on the matter.    Russia  boosted its stake in the bank to 85.5 percent from
77.5 percent in September 2009 by acquiring shares for 180
billion rubles ($6 billion) as part of a program to stabilize
the financial industry. VTB President  Andrei Kostin  said Oct. 1
that the lender “definitely” planned to conclude the sale of a
10 percent government stake by mid-2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
