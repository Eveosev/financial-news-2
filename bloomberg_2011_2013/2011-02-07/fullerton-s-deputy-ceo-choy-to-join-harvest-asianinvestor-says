Temasek Holdings Pte’s executive
director and president, Hsieh Fu Hua, will help to oversee the
Singapore-owned investment company’s Fullerton Fund Management
Co. as the unit seeks a new chief executive officer.  Choy Peng Wah will step down as deputy CEO of Fullerton
effective Feb. 11, the Temasek unit said in an e-mailed response
to questions. The move will leave Fullerton without a leader
after its former CEO, Gerard Lee, left to join Lion Global
Investors Ltd. in November.  Hsieh, a member of Fullerton’s board, will work closely
with Chan Chia Lin, the fund-management firm’s chief investment
officer, and Wah Geok Sum, its chief operating officer, to guide
the company while it looks for a new CEO, Fullerton said.  Choy is joining Harvest Global Investments in  Hong Kong  as
CEO effective Feb. 14, AsianInvestor reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
