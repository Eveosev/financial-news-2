SA, which is trying to sell its renewable energy assets with a
price tag of as much as 4.6 billion euros ($6.26 billion) is
struggling to find a single buyer, the Wall Street Journal
reported, citing people familiar with the matter.    Enel SpA ,  Gas Natural SDG SA  and an investment fund at  Morgan Stanley  have expressed interest in some assets; if a
single buyer isnâ€™t found ACS may split the units up for sale,
the newspaper said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:  Chris Peterson  at
