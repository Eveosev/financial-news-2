  Mark Wilson  birdied the second
playoff hole at the  Phoenix Open  in Arizona to defeat
Jason Dufner for his second U.S. PGA Tour win this season.  It’s Wilson’s fourth career title.  Wilson, who also won the Sony Open in  Hawaii  last month,
sank a putt from nine feet on the 10th hole at the TPC
Scottsdale course to secure his latest victory. Dufner parred
the hole when his long birdie putt came up short. Both players
finished four rounds at 18-under par.  “I’m ecstatic,” Wilson said in a televised interview on
the Golf Channel. “It’s crazy. I’m just riding the train as
long as I can. This is the best golf I’ve played in my life.”  Players were forced to return to the course this morning to
finish the tournament after cold temperatures and frost caused
delays throughout the event.  Wilson earned $1.1 million. His other wins came at the
2009 Mayakoba Golf Classic in  Mexico  and 2007 Honda Classic in  Florida . Scotland’s Martin Laird and Fiji’s  Vijay Singh  tied for
second at 16-under. Laird shot a final-round of 6-under 65, one
better than Singh’s last-round score.  Tiger Woods didn’t play in the event. The world’s No. 3-
ranked golfer will next compete in the Omega Dubai Desert
Classic beginning Feb. 10 at the Emirates Golf Club in Dubai.  To contact the reporter on this story:
