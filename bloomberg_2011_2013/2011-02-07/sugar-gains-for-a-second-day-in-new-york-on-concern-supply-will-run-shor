Sugar rose for a second session on
concern that world production will trail demand, further eroding
inventories. Coffee gained, while cocoa fell.  Sugar output in  India , the world’s second-largest grower,
may expand less than estimated in the current crop year,
Balrampur Chini Mills Ltd. said today. Rabobank Australia Ltd.
yesterday forecast a global production deficit. Prices have more
than doubled since May as adverse weather damaged crops.  “We still have supply concerns and strong demand,” said  Jimmy Tintle , an analyst at Transworld Futures in Tampa.
“Everyone is watching for India’s output.”  Raw sugar for March delivery rose 0.04 cent, or 0.1
percent, to settle at 32.68 cents a pound at 2 p.m. on ICE
Futures U.S. in New York.  In  London , refined-sugar futures for May delivery gained
$9.30, or 1.2 percent, to $778.80 a metric ton on NYSE Liffe.  Indian production may be as much as 24.5 million tons in
the year ending Sept. 30, according to Balrampur, the nation’s
second-largest sugar company, down from a November forecast of
25 million tons.  Brazil  is the world’s biggest producer.  Flooding followed by Tropical Cyclone Yasi reduced
Australian estimates by about 800,000 tons, said  Wayne Gordon , a
Rabobank analyst. Sugar output may be 3.5 million tons from the
June-to-December harvest this year, compared with 3.6 million
tons from the previous crop and below expectations of 4.2
million to 4.3 million tons, according to Rabobank. Australia is
the third-largest exporter, after Brazil and Thailand.  Coffee, Cocoa  Arabica-coffee futures for March delivery advanced 0.45
cents, or 0.2 percent, to $2.4975 a pound on ICE. In London,
robusta-coffee futures for March delivery rose $8, or 0.4
percent, to $2,215 a ton.    Hedge funds  and money managers increased their bullish bets

during the week ending Feb. 1, Commodity Futures Trading
Commission data show. It was the largest gain since Oct. 19.  Cocoa futures for May delivery fell $25, or 0.8 percent, to
