  Canada ’s dollar dropped from a two-
year high against its U.S. counterpart as crude oil, the
nation’s biggest export, fell for the third day on reduced
concern supplies will be disrupted by protests in  Egypt .  “Oil seems to be the overarching kind of driver,” said  Sacha Tihanyi , a currency strategist at Bank of Nova Scotia in
Toronto. “Risk sentiment is probably going to be a big deciding
factor in which direction the currency goes.”  The Canadian currency rose to its highest level since May
2008 versus the greenback on Feb. 4 after a government report
showed the nation’s employers added in January four times the
jobs forecast by economists.  Canada’s currency slid 0.4 percent to 99.08 cents per  U.S.
dollar  at 5:00 p.m. in  New York , from 98.73 cents on Feb. 4,
when it touched 98.32 cents, the strongest since May 29, 2008.
One Canadian dollar buys $1.0097. The loonie appreciated 1.4
percent last week in its biggest five-day gain since Dec. 3.  Futures on crude oil fell 2 percent to $87.24 a barrel
after touching $87.18, the lowest level since Jan. 28. The
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gained 0.6 percent, while the
S&P/TSX Composite Index advanced 0.2 percent.  Employment rose by 69,200 in January, and the  labor force 
increased by 106,400, Statistics Canada said last week. The
jobless rate rose to 7.8 percent from December’s 7.6 percent as
more people sought work. Economists forecast 7.6 percent
unemployment and job growth of 15,000, according to the median
estimates of economists in Bloomberg News surveys.  Currency ‘Strength’  “The overhang from the Canadian unemployment number has
underpinned the Canadian dollar’s strength,” said Michael O’Neill, managing director at Knightsbridge Foreign Exchange
Inc. in Toronto.  The probability that the central bank will boost its key
policy rate one-quarter percentage point by May climbed to 72
percent today, from 61 percent on Feb. 4 and 47 percent on Jan.
27, according to Bank of Nova Scotia data derived from overnight
index swaps. Traders are also pricing in a second rate increase
sooner, according to the data.  The  Bank of Canada  has left its benchmark interest rate at
1 percent since boosting it for a third consecutive meeting in
September. Canada led the Group of Seven nations with interest-
rate increases last year on signs the world’s 11th-largest
economy was emerging from a global recession. The central bank
said Jan. 18 that future increases would be “carefully”
considered.  Housing Starts  Canadian housing starts increased in January to 173,500 at
a seasonally adjusted annual pace, according to the median
forecast of 19 economists in a Bloomberg News survey. The report
from Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. is due tomorrow.  “This week overall is likely to remain supportive of the
Canadian dollar,” wrote  Mark McCormick , a currency strategist
at Brown Brothers Harriman & Co. in New York, in a note to
clients. “January housing starts will likely confirm strength
in the domestic economy.”  The yield on Canada’s 10-year bond fell three basis points,
or 0.03 percentage point, to 3.43 percent after touching 3.50
percent, the highest level since May 18. The 3.5 percent
security maturing in June 2020 rose 21 cents to C$100.55.  Canadian building permits rose for the first time in three
months in December, led by multifamily housing. The total value
of permits issued by municipalities increased 2.4 percent to
C$5.66 billion ($5.73 billion) after a revised November decrease
of 10.5 percent,  Statistics Canada  said today.  To contact the reporter for this story:
