Orascom Construction Industries,  Egypt ’s largest publicly-traded builder, said it resumed work at
50 locations across the country, representing almost 90 percent
of total work sites.  The company’s fertilizer plants “have continued to produce
at normal” rates, Cairo-based Orascom said in a statement on
its website. “Several export shipments have been completed this
week including 52,000 tons of urea which has been sold out
through mid-March, as well as two ammonia vessels totaling
38,500 tons which are expected to be completed shortly,” it
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
