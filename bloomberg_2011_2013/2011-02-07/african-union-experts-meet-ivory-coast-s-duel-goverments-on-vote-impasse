The  African Union  team of experts
tasked with finding a peaceful solution to  Ivory Coast ’s post-
election impasse met representatives today of the two men who
are claiming victory in the country’s November vote.  A 15-member delegation from the regional bloc met Alassane Ouattara’s Prime Minister Guillaume Soro, and other members of
his administration, said Ambroise Niyonsaba, special
representative of the African Union in Ivory Coast. Ouattara is
the internationally recognized winner of the election.  The group also met with members of the government of  Laurent Gbagbo , including Foreign Affairs Minister Alcide Djedje
and Affi N’Guessan, an adviser. Gbagbo, the incumbent, has ruled
for a decade and refuses to cede power to Ouattara, alleging
electoral fraud in parts of the  country’s north .  Niyonsaba declined to give details about the talks by phone
today from Abidjan, the commercial capital, where they took
place. The team will stay in the West African nation until Feb.
10. They will present their findings to a panel of five African
presidents tasked with resolving the standoff that was
established by the continental union at a meeting in  Addis Ababa 
last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
