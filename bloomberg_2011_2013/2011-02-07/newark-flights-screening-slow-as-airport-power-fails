  New Jersey ’s  Newark Liberty
International Airport , a Continental Airlines hub, regained
electric power after a failure lasting more than an hour forced
carriers to divert some flights.  Power was restored at 3:51 p.m. local time to the 20,000
affected customers, Public Service Electric & Gas Co. said today
in a statement. An equipment failure occurred in a switching
station yard in Elizabeth, New Jersey, around 2:30 p.m., and the
cause is under investigation, the utility said.  Some Continental flights were sent elsewhere, and others
had to circle the airport in a holding pattern, said  Mary Clark ,
a spokeswoman for parent company  United Continental Holdings
Inc . Continental has backup generators, allowing some planes to
continue taking off and landing, Clark said.  The Federal Aviation Administration temporarily held
Newark-bound planes at their departure airports to ease
congestion, according to an agency website. The power loss also
slowed security screening for travelers, Clark said.  Checkpoint machines were being recalibrated, according to
the  Port Authority of New York & New Jersey , which operates
Newark Liberty and the region’s other major airports, New York’s
LaGuardia and Kennedy. Three terminals and the AirTrain rail
link lost electricity, the  port authority  said.  Newark was the 14th-busiest airport in the U.S. in 2009,
with 33.4 million passengers, according to Airports Council
International.  To contact the reporters on this story:
