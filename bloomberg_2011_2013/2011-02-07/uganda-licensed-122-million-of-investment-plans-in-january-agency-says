Uganda licensed investment projects
worth $122 million last month, said Maggie Kigozi, the executive
director of the  Uganda  Investment Authority.  The agency licensed 29 projects which are expected to
create 2,590 jobs, Kigozi told reporters today in the capital,
Kampala. The growth in investment was driven by interest in the
agriculture, finance, real estate and manufacturing industries,
she said.  Kenya was the biggest source of planned investments, with
an estimated $55 million, followed by Mauritius with $14 million
and South African companies which aim to invest $10.7 million,
the agency said.  The government will probably license $3 billion worth of
projects this year, $1 billion of which will made by foreign
investors, on growth in the petroleum and mining industries,
Kigozi said on Jan. 6. The East African nation approved $1.7
billion in project in 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
