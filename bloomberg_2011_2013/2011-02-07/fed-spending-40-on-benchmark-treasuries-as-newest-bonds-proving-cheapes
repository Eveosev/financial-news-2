The  Federal Reserve ’s Treasury
purchases already have succeeded in driving investors to  junk
bonds  and stocks. Now, policy makers are focusing on benchmark  government securities , helping contain rising yields that set
rates on everything from corporate debt to mortgages.  More than 40 percent of the  government bonds  the Fed bought
in January for its so-called quantitative easing were auctioned
in the previous 90 days, up from 20 percent in December and 15
percent in November, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
The central bank is concentrating on newer securities as its
$600 billion program depletes primary dealers’ holdings of
Treasuries to the lowest since November 2009.  “They’re getting all the bang for their buck that they
can” by purchasing so-called on-the-run bonds, said Mitchell Stapley, the  Grand Rapids , Michigan-based chief fixed-income
officer for Fifth Third Asset Management, which oversees $22
billion. “When you’re the largest buyer out there, when you
replace China in terms of the size of your holdings of  Treasury
securities , that will happen.”  The Fed purchases are helping keep a lid on borrowing costs
for companies and homebuyers as the economy recovers. Yields on
corporate bonds have averaged about 4.84 percent since the
buying began in November, below the 5.48 percent for all of
2010, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes. The
average rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage has been 4.61 percent,
in line with 2010’s 4.69 percent and lower than the 5.93 percent
of the past decade, according to  Freddie Mac  in McLean,
Virginia.  Maintaining Demand  Quantitative easing has boosted demand for Treasuries as
President Barack Obama’s budget deficits exceed $1 trillion,
adding to the nation’s $8.96 trillion in marketable debt.
Investors bid $3.04 for each dollar of bonds sold in the
government’s $178 billion of auctions last month, the most since
September, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Yields on Treasuries of all maturities fell to an average
of 1.88 percent in January, the first monthly drop since
October, Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data show. The
benchmark 10-year note may decline to 3.52 percent at the end of
the second quarter from 3.64 percent Feb. 4, based on the median
estimate of 76 economists, strategist and analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg. Current rates compare with the average of 5.26
percent during the past two decades. The rate rose three basis
points to 3.66 percent at 9:06 a.m. in  New York .  Weekly Slump  The 10-year note yield increased 31 basis points last week,
according to BGCantor Market Data. The price of the 2.625
percent security due November 2020 fell 2 15/32, or $24.69 per
$1,000 face amount, to 91 3/4.  Since Nov. 3, when Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  announced
the plan to buy government debt to keep the economy from falling
into deflation, 10-year yields have increased about one
percentage point as expectations for inflation rose. The
purchases and signs that the economy is recovering have reduced
demand for the safety of government debt in favor of riskier
assets and the  Standard & Poor’s  500 Index has risen 9.4
percent.  Speculative-grade corporate bond yields fell to 4.68
percentage points, or 468 basis points, more than Treasuries
last week, the least since November 2007 and down from 6.22
percentage points in November, according to Bank of America
Merrill Lynch index data. Debt rated lower than Baa3 by Moody’s
Investors Service or less than BBB- by Standard & Poor’s is
below investment grade, or junk.  Biggest Owner  The Fed became the biggest owner of  U.S. government debt  in
November, when holdings reached $896.7 billion, overtaking  China ’s $895.6 billion, according to Treasury and central bank
data. It purchased $288 billion since Nov. 12, mostly from
dealers, reducing  Wall Street ’s holdings of long-term Treasuries
to a so-called net short position of negative $22.3 billion in
the week ended Jan. 19.  That means prices shown to the Fed when it buys will
continue to increase, according to Credit Suisse Group AG, one
the 20 primary dealers that trade directly with the central
bank.  Now, the Fed is turning to benchmark bonds for quantitative
easing because older, or off-the-run, securities are becoming
too expensive as measured by the bid-ask spread showing the
difference between the lowest price for securities offered for
sale and the highest bid.  The difference between the prices at which investors are
willing to buy and sell older five-year notes due February 2016
has widened to 1.0833 basis points since Nov. 3, according to
Bank of America. In the five months before the Fed announcement
the spread was 0.97 to 0.99 basis point. Every 0.1 basis point
on $600 billion of bonds would save the Fed about $6 million.  Deficits, Inflation  Creating more demand for newer bonds gives Wall Street an
added incentive to buy at government sales, helping keep
benchmark yields in check.  “Dealers are more likely to bid more aggressively at
Treasury auctions if they can sell to the Fed in the not-so-
distant future,” strategists at Bank of America Merrill Lynch
said in a Jan. 31 note to investors.  While the Fed’s purchases have helped boost confidence,
bigger deficits and speculation that inflation may accelerate
have sent yields higher, said Larry Dyer, a U.S. interest-rate
strategist in New York with HSBC Holdings Plc’s HSBC Securities
unit. Treasuries lost 3.7 percent since the beginning of
November, including reinvested interest, after returning 8.59
percent in the first 10 months of 2010, Bank of America Merrill
Lynch data show.  “The Fed has monopoly control over front-end rates,” Dyer
said. “But in bringing down long-term  interest rates , the Fed
is having a much tougher time.”  Yield Curve  Bernanke has kept the target interest-rate for overnight
loans between banks in a range of zero to 0.25 percent since
December 2008. The difference between yields on two- and 10-year
yields rose to 2.89 percentage points last week, above median of
1.81 percentage points the past decade. A widening yield curve
has historically been a sign that investors anticipate a
strengthening economy.  The  Institute for Supply Management  said Feb. 1 that its
factory index accelerated in January to the fastest pace in more
than six years and the Labor Department said Feb. 4 the U.S.
unemployment rate dropped to 9 percent in January from 9.4
percent in December as  job creation  slowed amid winter storms.  Optimism on the outlook for the economy allowed companies
in the U.S. to sell $159 billion of bonds last month, a record
for January, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.    Goldman Sachs Group Inc ., the fifth-biggest  U.S. bank  by
assets, sold $3.5 billion last week in its largest dollar-
denominated issue without government backing since 2004.  Shrinking Spreads  The bank’s new securities included $2.5 billion of 3.625
percent debt maturing in 2016 that yields 158 basis points more
than similar-maturity Treasuries, Bloomberg data show. In July,
Goldman Sachs issued $2.25 billion of 5-year, 3.7 percent notes
that paid 205 basis points more than benchmarks.    Microsoft Corp . issued $2.25 billion of bonds, according to
Bloomberg data. The Redmond, Washington-based company’s $750
million of 2.5 percent, 5-year notes were priced to yield 38
basis points more than Treasuries, compared with 40 basis points
on its $1.75 billion sale of 1.625 percent, 5-year debt on Sept.
22. The new spread was the narrowest since Gillette Co. sold
$300 million of 2.875 percent, 5-year debentures on March 4,
2003, at 37.5 basis points.  “Buying the newer issues has a more-direct impact on yield
targeting and the Fed’s goal of keeping rates low within a
range,” said  George Goncalves , head of interest-rate strategy
at Nomura Holdings Inc., another primary dealer. “The Fed has
taken some of the liquidity out of the market, which gives their
purchases more impact.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
