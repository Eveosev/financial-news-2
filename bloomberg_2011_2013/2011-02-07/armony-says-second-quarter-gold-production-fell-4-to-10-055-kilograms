Harmony Gold Mining Ltd.,  Africa ’s
third-largest producer of the metal, said fiscal second-quarter
operating profit rose 33 percent as the price of bullion jumped.  Operating profit increased to 867 million rand ($119.8
million) in the three months through Dec. 31 from 652 million
rand the previous quarter, the Johannesburg-based company said
in a statement today. The gold price increased 12 percent in the
quarter compared with the previous three months while Harmony’s
cash operating costs decreased 1 percent in dollar terms.  “The company has turned the corner -- unprofitable
operations were closed and our longer-life lower cost operations
are profitable and sustainable,” Chief Executive Officer Graham Briggs said in the statement.  Harmony is trying to boost output of gold, which has
increased in value each year during the past decade. The metal
jumped 30 percent last year after governments spent trillions of
dollars and kept  interest rates  low to bolster economies, while  Europe ’s sovereign-debt crisis also boosted demand. Gold reached
a record $1,431.25 an ounce on Dec. 7.  Harmony forecast it will produce between 1.45 million
ounces and 1.5 million ounces in the full fiscal year and is
“confident” it will reach its target of producing 2 million
ounces of gold a year by 2013. The company in fiscal 2010
produced 1.43 million ounces of gold.  Production during the second quarter declined 4 percent
following an Oct. 20 accident at Harmony’s Kusasalethu mine,
which damaged a shaft, the company said.  Harmony fell 21 cents, or 0.3 percent, to 79.59 rand as of
9:23 a.m. in Johannesburg. The stock has gained 1.8 percent over
the past six months, lagging behind larger rivals  AngloGold
Ashanti Ltd .’s 5.5 percent gain and  Gold Fields Ltd .’s 16.32
percent surge.  To contact the reporters on this story:
