LG Display Co., the world’s second-
largest maker of liquid-crystal displays, said it’s in talks
with  TPV Technology Ltd . to form a venture in  Poland  to
manufacture LCD modules and televisions.  The venture will help reduce production costs by making TV
parts and sets in one factory, Claire Ohm, a Seoul-based
spokeswoman for LG Display, said in a telephone interview today.
LG has similar operations in China with TPV and AmTran
Technology Co.  The company is yet to decide on investments and when to
begin production, Ohm said. Newspim, a Korean-language online
news provider, reported LG Display’s plan earlier today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
