The Australian dollar weakened after
a government report showed retail sales fell 0.3 percent in the
last quarter of 2010, adjusted for inflation, the first decline
since the three months ended Sept. 30, 2009.  The currency slid to $1.0116 as of 11:32 a.m. in Sydney
from $1.0123 before the announcement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
