The  Green Bay Packers  lead the
Pittsburgh Steelers 21-10 at halftime of the Super Bowl as they
seek a record 13th National Football League championship.  The Packers scored touchdowns 17 seconds apart during the
first quarter and have intercepted Steelers quarterback  Ben Roethlisberger  twice at  Cowboys Stadium  in Arlington,  Texas . The
biggest halftime deficit that a team has overcome to win the
Super Bowl is 10 points.  Green Bay quarterback  Aaron Rodgers  threw a 29-yard
touchdown pass to Jordy Nelson with 3:51 left in the opening
quarter and Nick Collins followed with a 37-yard interception
return for a score. Rodgers tossed a 21-yard touchdown pass to
Greg Jennings 2:24 before halftime, a score that came four plays
after Roethlisberger’s second interception.  The Steelers trailed 21-3 before getting an eight-yard
touchdown pass from Roethlisberger to Hines Ward with 39 seconds
left in the second quarter. Pittsburgh’s first points came on a
33-yard field goal by Shaun Suisham.  Rodgers has completed 11 of 16 passes for 137 yards and two
touchdowns. Roethlisberger, who has led the Steelers to two  Super Bowl  titles, is 13-of-21 for 143 yards and one score.  Only three times in the Super Bowl’s 45-year history has
the team that made more turnovers won the game.  The Packers won the most recent of their three Super Bowl
titles 14 years ago and their 12 NFL championships are the most
all time. The Steelers are seeking their record-extending
seventh Super Bowl title and third in six years.  While eight of the past 10 teams to lead the Super Bowl at
halftime went on to win, the team trailing after the opening 30
minutes has won two of the past three years. The New Orleans
Saints rallied from a 10-6 halftime deficit last season to beat
the Indianapolis Colts 31-17.  To contact the reporter on this story:
