  Loews Corp ., the company run by  New
York ’s Tisch family, gained the most since May after fourth-
quarter earnings beat analysts’ estimates and the insurance unit
declared its first dividend since 2008.  Loews advanced $1.87, or 4.5 percent, to $43.27 at 4:00
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. Operating
income in the fourth quarter was $1.17 a share, compared with
the 88 cent estimate of 2 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  CNA
Financial Corp ., the insurer controlled by Loews, will pay a
dividend of 10 cents a share on March 2, the company said in a
statement today.  The payout “demonstrates the progress we have made in
restoring our financial strength,” said Thomas Motamed, CNA’s
chief executive officer, in the statement.  CNA, 90 percent-owned by Loews, went to its parent for
capital amid investment declines and three quarterly losses at
the end of 2008 and beginning of 2009. The insurer in December
redeemed the remaining $500 million of preferred stock issued to
Loews during the financial crisis, allowing it to resume its
dividend.  Fourth-quarter net income at Loews jumped 16 percent to
$466 million as results improved at Chicago-based CNA on so-
called limited partnership investments, which can include  hedge
funds , private equity and real estate. Net income at CNA
advanced to $302 million from $246 million.  CNA gained $2.45, or 8.8 percent, to $30.19, the biggest
jump since August 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
