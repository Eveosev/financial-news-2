Asian stocks fluctuated after the
MSCI Asia Pacific Index’s biggest weekly gain this year, as
increased earnings and lower U.S. unemployment tempered declines
in energy stocks as oil fell on easing tensions in Egypt.  Toyota Motor Corp., the world’s biggest carmaker, gained
0.9 percent in Tokyo. Sega Sammy Holdings Inc. climbed 3 percent
after the maker of video-game and pachinko machines said profit
rose.  Cnooc Ltd .,  China ’s largest offshore oil producer, led
energy companies in the region lower as receding violence in
Egypt drove crude prices lower.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index was little changed at 139.47 as
of 6 p.m. in Tokyo after climbing as much as 0.5 percent and
retreating 0.2 percent. Four stocks rose for every three that
fell on the gauge, which climbed 1.4 percent last week for the
sharpest weekly increase this year as improving corporate
earnings overshadowed concern over Egypt’s political instability.  “The stronger-than-expected earnings are confirming what
we’re seeing in the economic data,” said Nader Naeimi, a
Sydney-based strategist at AMP Capital Investors Ltd., which
manages about $93 billion. “Equity markets are still vulnerable
to profit taking given the strong gains last year, as well as to
building inflationary pressures.”  Japan’s  Nikkei 225  Stock Average advanced 0.5 percent and
South Korea’s Kospi Index also rose 0.5 percent. The S&P/ASX 200
Index added 0.1 percent in Australia, where a government report
showed the nation’s retail sales increased less than economists
forecast.  Chinese Developers    Hong Kong ’s  Hang Seng Index  slipped 1.1 percent, with  China
Resources  Land Ltd. and China Overseas & Investment Ltd. leading
mainland developers lower after Premier Wen Jiabao pledged to
curb market speculation. Chinese markets remain closed for the
Lunar New Year until Feb. 9, while exchanges in Taiwan and
Vietnam resume trading on Feb. 8.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.1 percent
today. The index advanced 0.3 percent on Feb. 4 in  New York  to
the highest close since June 2008 after the Labor Department
said the U.S. unemployment rate fell to 9 percent in January
from 9.4 percent in December. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg
had expected an increase to 9.5 percent.  U.S. data this week are forecast to show rising consumer
borrowing and optimism among small businesses, following the
unexpected drop in unemployment, while German reports may point
to increasing factory orders and industrial production.    Egypt  Tension Eases  Investor sentiment also improved after Egyptian Vice
President  Omar Suleiman  and some members of the opposition
agreed on limited steps to resolve their nation’s crisis, even
as the government stood firm against protester demands for
President Hosni Mubarak to resign.  Toyota gained 0.9 percent to 3,490 yen in Tokyo and Sega
Sammy climbed 3 percent to 1,796 yen. Credit Saison Co., a
consumer lender, surged 8.7 percent to 1,594 yen after boosting
its full-year net income forecast 38 percent to 16.5 billion yen
($200 million).  In Hong Kong, Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd., the city’s
biggest carrier, surged 2 percent to HK$20.85 as optimism over
global recovery boosted some airline stocks.  Qantas Airways Ltd .,
Australia’s largest airline, rose 0.8 percent to A$2.43.  “Employment in the U.S. is improving steadily, although
the pace is slow,” said  Tomochika Kitaoka , a senior strategist
in Tokyo at Mizuho Securities Co. “If employment keeps
recovering, even if the pace is slow, a sense of security in a
cyclical recovery of the  U.S. economy  will start to spread.”  Hana, Woori Gain  Hana Financial added 3.4 percent to 47,000 won in Seoul.
Woori Finance Holdings Co. gained 3.5 percent to 14,950 won.
Also in  Seoul , Hanjin Heavy Industries & Construction Co. jumped
8.4 percent to 41,200 won after Samsung Securities Co. raised
its stock rating to “buy” from “hold.”    HSBC Holdings Plc , Europe’s biggest bank, climbed 1.1
percent to HK$88 in Hong Kong, where markets last week shut at
12:30 p.m. on Feb. 2., amid optimism the region’s economic
difficulties are easing.  Esprit Holdings Ltd . which gets about
80 percent of its sales from  Europe , added 2.9 percent to
HK$38.85.  Europe-linked stocks also climbed as regional leaders
reiterated a pledge at a Feb. 4 summit to complete their plan to
bolster the 440 billion-euro ($599 billion) European Financial
Stability Facility.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index increased 1.3 percent this year
to the last close, compared with gains of 4.2 percent by the S&P
500 and 3.7 percent by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Stocks in the
Asian benchmark were valued at 14.1 times estimated earnings on
average, compared with 13.7 times for the S&P 500 and 11.3 times
for the Stoxx 600.  Energy Stocks  Today, 20 of the 1,019 companies in the MSCI index were
scheduled to release earnings statements. Of the 345 that have
reported results since Jan. 1 for the latest quarter, 138 have
exceeded analysts’ estimates, while 108 have missed them,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  A measure of energy stocks had the biggest drop today among
the 10 industry groups tracked by the Asia Pacific index, as
easing concerns over tensions in Egypt led crude oil to trade
near the lowest price in a week.  Cnooc Ltd., China’s largest offshore energy producer, sank
2.9 percent to HK$17.26 in Hong Kong. PetroChina Co., the
nation’s largest oil producer, lost 3.6 percent to HK$10.76, and
China Petroleum & Chemical Corp., also known as Sinopec, slid
4.2 percent to HK$8.38.  Developers also slumped in Hong Kong, with China Resources
losing 2.1 percent to HK$13.98 and China Overseas dropping 1.9
percent to A$14.60.  Australian Retailers  Australian retailers dropped after  Myer Holdings Ltd ,
Australia’s largest department store, cut its profit forecast
for the 2011 financial year. Net profit after tax in the year
ending June 2011 will be as much as 5 percent less than a year
earlier, the Melbourne-based company said in a statement to the
Australian stock exchange.  Myer plunged 11 percent to A$3.32 in Sydney. Rival  David
Jones Ltd . dropped 4.2 percent to A$4.53, and  Harvey Norman
Holdings Ltd ., the nation’s largest furniture and electrical
retailer, declined 3.6 percent to A$2.93.
      JB Hi-Fi Ltd ., an Australian electronics retailer, climbed
1.8 percent to A$19.43 after reporting a 16 percent increase in
first-half net income.  To contact the reporters on this story:
