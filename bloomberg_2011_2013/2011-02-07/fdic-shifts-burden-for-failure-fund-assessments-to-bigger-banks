The Financial Stability Oversight
Council, a group of regulators charged with preventing a
financial crisis, approved a proposal today outlining how the
 U.S. Treasury ’s assessment fee would be administered.  The  proposal , which will be open for public comment for 60
days, determines which companies will be subject to an
assessment fee, what are the total expenses necessary to carry
out the activities covered by the assessment and how the fee
will be calculated.  The rule is part of the sweeping financial-regulation
overhaul mandated by Dodd-Frank to prevent a repeat of the
market tumult that followed the 2008 bankruptcy of Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc. The fees will help replenish some
operating expenses of the FSOC, the Office of Financial
Research, the Financial Research Fund and some covered Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp. expenses.  The companies subject to the assessment are U.S. bank
holding companies with at least $50 billion in total
consolidated assets, foreign banking organizations with at least
$50 billion in total consolidated assets in U.S. operations and
nonbank financial companies required to be supervised by the
Federal Reserve Board.  The assessment rate will be announced June 2012 and
companies will be billed in early July with the first payment
due July 20. Initial assessment amounts will depend on the
president’s 2013 fiscal year budget.  To contact the reporters on this story:
