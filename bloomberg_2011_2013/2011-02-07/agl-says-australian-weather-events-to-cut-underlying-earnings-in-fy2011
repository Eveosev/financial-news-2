  AGL Energy Ltd ., the Australian power
and gas retailer, cut its full-year profit forecast after
surging temperatures boosted demand at a time when the utility
had to buy supplies at increased wholesale prices.  The shutdown of the Yabulu power station because of
Tropical Cyclone Yasi and the disruption of gas supplies to the
Oakey generator in Queensland, along with several days of record
electricity demand in New South Wales and  South Australia ,
prompted the company to lower its outlook, AGL said in a
statement to the stock exchange today.  “Extreme weather” will cut underlying net income to
between A$415 million ($420 million) and A$440 million for the
year ending in June, compared with a previous forecast of A$450
million to A$480 million, the Sydney-based company said.  JPMorgan Chase & Co. upgraded AGL shares on Feb. 4 to
“overweight” from “neutral,” saying their 14 percent decline
from an Oct. 25 peak of A$16.83 was “overdone.” While AGL’s
failure to acquire any assets in the New South  Wales  power asset
sale in December disappointed investors, the company is set to
“aggressively attack the market” after improving its billing
system, Sydney-based analyst Jason Steed wrote in a report.  AGL rose 0.5 percent to A$15.01 in Sydney trading, compared
with a 0.1 percent gain for the benchmark S&P/ASX 200 Index. The
shares earlier fell as much as 2.1 percent to A$14.61.  A record heat wave in Sydney, a cyclone and flooding in
Queensland “exposed AGL to increased customer demand for
electricity” when wholesale electricity prices climbed to as
much as A$12,500 per megawatt hour. That compared with recent
wholesale prices below A$40 per megawatt hour, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:  James Paton  in Sydney   jpaton4@bloomberg.net .  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
