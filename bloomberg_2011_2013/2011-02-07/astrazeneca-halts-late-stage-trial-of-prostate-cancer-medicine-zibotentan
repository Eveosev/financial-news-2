  AstraZeneca Plc  stopped a late-stage
trial of the zibotentan treatment for a type of prostate cancer
after a review showed the drug was unlikely to meet the goals of
the study.  The review by an independent monitoring committee indicated
the experimental medicine was unlikely to help patients with
non-metastatic castrate-resistant prostate tumors live longer or
delay progression of the disease, the London-based drugmaker
said in a statement today.  AstraZeneca halted another late-stage study of zibotentan
in patients with a form of the cancer in September after the
drug failed to help patients live longer. The U.K.’s second-
biggest drugmaker said at the time that it wouldn’t seek
regulatory approval of zibotentan.  The company said it will continue another test of the
treatment in combination with chemotherapy in men whose disease
has spread. Full results of that study are expected in the
second half of the year.  AstraZeneca rose 12 pence, or 0.4 percent, to 2,945 pence
