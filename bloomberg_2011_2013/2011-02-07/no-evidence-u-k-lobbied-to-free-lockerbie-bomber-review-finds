There is no evidence that the U.K.
government lobbied the Scottish government for the release of
Lockerbie bomber Abdel Basset Al-Megrahi, a review by the
head of the U.K. civil service has found.  “I have not seen any evidence that HMG pressured or
lobbied the Scottish government for the transfer or release of
Mr. Megrahi,” Cabinet Secretary Gus O’Donnell wrote in the
report published today. “Indeed, throughout this period, the
former government took great effort not to communicate to the
Scottish government its underlying desire to see Mr. Megrahi
released before he died.”  “Moreover, it is clear that HMG considered that any
attempts to pressurize or lobby the Scottish government could be
counterproductive to achieving this outcome,” O’Donnell wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
