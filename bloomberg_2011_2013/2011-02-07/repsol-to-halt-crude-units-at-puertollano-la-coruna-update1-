  Repsol YPF SA ,  Spain ’s largest oil
company, plans to halt crude processing units at its Puertollano
and La Coruna refineries for maintenance this year.  Crude unit 2 will be idled at La Coruna for 18 days in the
second quarter, the Madrid-based company said today in an e-
mailed statement. A gasoline plant will be halted for 21 days in
the fourth quarter, it said. La Coruna refinery in northern
Spain has the capacity to process 120,000 barrels of oil a day.  Crude unit 2 and a vacuum plant at Puertollano will be
stopped for 29 days in the fourth quarter, according to the
statement. A gasoline unit and coker will be halted for 20 days
and 39 days, respectively, during this time. The refinery can
handle 140,000 barrels of oil a day.  Refiners have to shut processing units periodically to
ensure safe and efficient operations and to detect problems
before they arise. Cokers process heavy oils such as  fuel oil 
into light products including naphtha and gasoil.  A vacuum unit and lubricants plant at the Cartagena
refinery halted operations today for a month of maintenance,
Repsol said. The facility can process 100,000 barrels of oil a
day, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The following table lists planned halts in 2011 at Repsol’s
refineries. Capacity is shown in thousands of barrels a day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
