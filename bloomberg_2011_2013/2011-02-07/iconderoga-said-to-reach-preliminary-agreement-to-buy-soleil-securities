Ticonderoga Securities LLC, the New
York-based broker-dealer started in 2009, has reached a
preliminary agreement to buy Soleil Securities Corp., according
to two people with direct knowledge of the situation.  A definitive pact may be signed in the next few weeks, said
one of the people, who declined to be identified because the
company hasn’t announced the takeover talks publicly.  Soleil has 17 research analysts covering 10 subjects
including consumer companies, financial services and utilities,
according to its  website . Vince Farrell handles portfolio
strategy. Soleil, owned partly by the venture-capital unit of
Bain Capital LLC, has offices in New York,  Boston , Cleveland,
Minneapolis and  San Francisco , according to its website.  Kelsea Michael, a spokeswoman for Ticonderoga at CJP
Communications, declined to comment. Soleil Chief Executive
Officer Terry Gardner didn’t respond to a telephone message left
at his office. Alex Stanton, a Bain spokesman, declined to
comment.  Soleil was started in 2003 following the $1.4 billion
settlement between Wall Street firms and the Securities and
Exchange Commission over allegations the banks used biased
research to gain underwriting and merger assignments.  Ticonderoga has about 75 employees, including six research
analysts, Michael said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
