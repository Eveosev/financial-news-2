What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Wheat futures are called to open 7 cents to 9 cents a bushel
higher on the Chicago Board of Trade, the Kansas City Board of
Trade and the  Minneapolis Grain Exchange  after  Egypt  bought
170,000 metric tons and Iraq and Bangladesh announced new
tenders for imports, said  Jim Gerlach , the president of A/C
Trading Inc. in Fowler, Indiana.  -- Corn futures may open 2 cents to 4 cents a bushel higher in
Chicago after increased U.S. export sales signaled that a rally
to a 30-month high has yet to limit demand for the grain used in
food and animal feed, Gerlach said.  -- Soybean futures may open 8 cents to 10 cents a bushel higher
on the CBOT amid speculation that rising demand for U.S.
supplies will reduce inventories before this yearâ€™s harvest to a
five-year low, Gerlach said. Soybean-oil futures are expected to
open up 0.1 cent to 0.2 cent a pound, and soybean-meal futures
may open $2 to $3 higher per 2,000 pounds.  To contact the reporters on this story:
