  Julius Baer Group Ltd ., the 121-year
old Swiss wealth manager, plans to buy back as much as 500
million Swiss francs ($524 million) of shares after full-year
profit declined 9.3 percent.  Net income fell to 353 million francs in 2010 from 389
million francs a year earlier, the Zurich-based bank said today
in an e-mailed statement. The private bank plans to repurchase
as much as 5 percent of its outstanding shares by its annual
shareholder meeting next year.  As clients reassess the benefits of cross-border accounts,  Switzerland ’s fifth-biggest money manager must decide whether to
build branch networks in Europe and  Asia  to compete with larger
rivals such as UBS AG and Credit Suisse Group AG. Net inflows
increased to 5.4 billion francs in the second half of 2010, from
3.3 billion in the previous six months, Baer said.  “We’ve seen regained momentum in the second half and hope
to continue this into 2011,” Chief Executive Officer Boris Collardi told reporters on a conference call today from Zurich.  Baer rose 2.1 percent to 44.49 francs as of 9:32 a.m. in
Zurich trading, valuing the bank at 9.2 billion francs. The
stock has climbed 39 percent over the past 12 months compared
with a 15 percent gain in the 48-member Bloomberg  Europe  Banks
and Financial Services Index.  Total managed assets fell to 170 billion francs at the end
of 2010 from 175 billion francs two months earlier, partly
because of gains in the Swiss currency against the dollar and
euro, which together account for more than two-thirds of client
assets.  New Hiring  The negative currency effect over the full year was about
14 billion francs, Baer said.  Baer increased its total number of relationship managers by
85 to 752 over the year and said that its annual hiring target
remains 40 to 50. Two-thirds of last year’s additions came from
the bank’s acquisition of ING Groep NV’s Swiss business, which
added 13.5 billion francs to managed assets.  Collardi may use the bank’s excess capital to make more
acquisitions.  “There are still a few targets in the market which could
be interesting,” Chief Financial Officer Dieter Enkelmann told
reporters.  Profit, excluding integration and restructuring costs and
amortization, climbed 6 percent to 504 million francs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
