Norway’s krone declined a fourth day
against the dollar and weakened versus the euro as crude oil
traded near its lowest level in a week and data showed the pace
of manufacturing growth slowed more than analysts estimated.  The Norwegian currency weakened against all of its 16 most-
traded peers. Crude oil futures dropped as much as 0.6 percent
as receding violence in  Egypt  allayed concern supplies would be
disrupted. Norway’s manufacturing production rose 2.2 percent in
December from the previous year, the Oslo-based statistics
office said, missing the median forecast of five economists
surveyed by Bloomberg for a 4.2 percent rise and easing pressure
on the central bank to raise  interest rates .  “The Norges Bank continues to be for some people
frustratingly dovish and that has capped the upside for the
krone,” said  Henrik Gullberg , a currency strategist at Deutsche
Bank AG in London. “I still think that the krone will
appreciate but the pace of appreciation will be determined by
oil prices and the Norges Bank.”  The krone depreciated 0.6 percent against the dollar to
5.7924 as of 11:20 a.m. in  London  and slid 0.5 percent to 7.8511
against the euro.  Sweden’s krona was little changed at 8.8086 per euro and
was 0.3 percent weaker at 6.4987 per dollar.  The Swedish government had a budget surplus of 29.9 billion
kronor in January, the National Debt Office said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
