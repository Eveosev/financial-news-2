The U.S. government needs to end its
role in the mortgage market as it decides the future of  Fannie
Mae  and  Freddie Mac , Congressman Scott Garrett said.  “Let me stress and be very clear where I stand: I am
firmly committed to a purely private U.S. mortgage market over
time, free of any government subsidies or guarantees,” Garrett
said today in Orlando at the American Securitization Forum trade
group’s annual conference.  The New Jersey Republican is chairman of the House
Financial Services subcommittee on capital markets and
government-sponsored enterprises.  Fannie Mae, based in Washington; and McLean, Virginia-based
Freddie Mac are the government-controlled mortgage finance
companies taken over during the financial crisis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
