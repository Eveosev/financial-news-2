Motiva Enterprises LLC’s  Port Arthur ,
Texas, refinery didn’t shut down yesterday, contrary to
information in a filing with the state, according to Jill Davis,
a company spokeswoman.  “The refinery is operational,” Davis said in an e-mail.  A  filing  with the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality
yesterday showed the 300,000-barrel-a-day refinery shut down
because of an “unanticipated nitrogen supply disruption.” The
plant was following emergency procedures, the filing showed.  Motiva is a refining and marketing joint venture of Saudi
Refining Inc., a subsidiary of Saudi Arabian Oil Co., and Shell
Oil Co., a unit of  Royal Dutch Shell Plc .  To contact the reporter on this story:
