  Anglo Platinum Ltd ., the largest
producer of the metal, said profit jumped threefold last year as
platinum prices increased and a unit disposal boosted income.  Earnings advanced to 39.09 rand a share, from 12.34 rand a
year earlier, the Johannesburg-based company said today in a
statement. Anglo Platinum resumed dividend payments, declaring a
final distribution of 6.83 rand a share.  The price of platinum, used to make jewelry and pollution-
control devices for cars, rose 33 percent to average $1,613.46
an ounce in  London  last year, after falling two-thirds from a
record $2,301.50 reached in 2008. Platinum imports into  China ,
the biggest auto market, gained 40 percent in 2010, according to
the General Administration of Customs, as vehicle sales climbed.  Earnings excluding one-time items, a benchmark for local
analysts, rose to 19.35 rand a share, compared with a Feb. 3
median estimate of 19.57 rand from 12 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg. Profit was also boosted by the sale of a 37 percent
interest in the  Western Bushveld Joint Venture .  Chief Executive Officer Neville Nicolau is seeking to raise
output even after cutting more than 18,000 jobs and closing
shafts to stem rising debt following platinum’s 2008 tumble.  The company said in July it may refine and sell 2.5 million
ounces of platinum in 2010 and 2.6 million ounces this year. It
also mines palladium and rhodium, typically associated with
platinum.    Anglo American Plc  owns about 79 percent of the company,
which mines mostly in  South Africa , the world’s largest supplier
of the precious metal. Anglo Platinum has risen 5.3 percent this
year in Johannesburg trading, and gained 0.4 percent to 730.90
rand as of 10:01 a.m. local time today.  Competitor Impala Platinum Holdings Ltd. lost 0.9 percent
to 211 rand, extending its year-to-date decline to 9.4 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
