Cameroon ,  Africa ’s fourth-biggest
cocoa producer, may exceed a target for the 2010-11 season after
a program to distribute new trees took effect, the country’s
state-controled industry group said.  “Production will certainly go beyond 200,000 metric tons by
the end of the season,” said John Atanga, communications officer
for the Cocoa Development Authority, in a phone interview today,
declining to give a specific figure. Cameroon’s August-to-July
harvest period produced 198,000 tons in 2009-10, according to
the Cocoa and Coffee Board.  Between 2008 and 2010, the agency provided 14.1 million new
cocoa trees to farmers in the center, south and eastern
production zones, Atanga said. They were sold for 50  CFA francs 
($0.10), subsidized from the usual price of 250 francs, he said.  “The plants distributed in 2008 are already bearing fruits
and production is expected to step up,” he said. Aging trees,
which provide fewer pods than younger ones, in  Ivory Coast  and
Cameroon may hinder international supplies of the chocolate
ingredient, Mother Earth Investments AG said in October.  The plants are grown on 11,500 hectares of new farmland,
Atanga said, though the number of trees provided is “far from
satisfying demand.” Cameroon’s 4 million cocoa farmers need
about 60 million plants each year, he added.  Cameroon ranks behind Ivory Coast,  Ghana  and  Nigeria  as
Africa’s top growers. March delivery beans shed 24 pounds, or
1.1 percent, to 2,115 pounds per ton at 1:52 p.m. in London
trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
