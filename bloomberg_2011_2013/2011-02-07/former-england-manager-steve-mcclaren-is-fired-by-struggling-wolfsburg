Former England manager  Steve McClaren 
has been fired by  Wolfsburg  as the club struggles to avoid
relegation from  Germany ’s top soccer league.  “We are no longer convinced that we will be able to bring
the season to a stable end in cooperation with Steve McClaren,”
club managing director Dieter Hoeness said in a  statement  on
Wolfsburg’s website.  McLaren, 49, joined the team in July after leading  FC
Twente  to its first Dutch Eredivisie title last season. He’ll be
replaced by his assistant, Pierre Littbarski.  Under McLaren, Wolfsburg won only won five league games out
of 21. The team is one point above the relegation zone after a
1-0 defeat at Hannover at the weekend.  McClaren had been the first English manager in the
Bundesliga’s top division, and Wolfsburg’s third new coach in a
year.  Wolfsburg finished eighth last season after winning its
first Bundesliga title in 2009 under coach Felix Magath, who
left to join Schalke. His successor Armin Veh was dismissed in
January 2010, with Lorenz-Guenther Koestner taking over on a
caretaker basis.  In the Netherlands, McClaren became the first English coach
to win a major European league championship since Bobby Robson
at Porto in 1996. He joined Twente in June 2008, seven months
after being fired as coach of  England ’s national team when the
squad failed to qualify for the 2008 European Championship.  His previous coaching career included leading England’s
Middlesbrough to the League Cup title in 2004 and reaching the
UEFA Cup final two years later.  To contact the reporter on this story:
