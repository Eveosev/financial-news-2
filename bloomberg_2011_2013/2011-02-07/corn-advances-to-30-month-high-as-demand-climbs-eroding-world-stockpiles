Corn rose to a 30-month high in  Chicago  as the U.S. government may lower its stockpile estimate
on increased demand from  China  and ethanol makers. Wheat gained
after  Egypt  bought U.S. and Argentine grain.  A U.S. Department of Agriculture report due Feb. 9 will
forecast corn inventories at 125.4 million metric tons on Sept.
1, down from a month-ago estimate of 127 million tons, according
to a Bloomberg News survey. China may import a record 9 million
tons of corn, the U.S. Grains Council said last week.  “The tight inventory situation, high demand from the
ethanol-producing industry and a gloomier production outlook
through Argentina, in our view, are supporting corn prices,”  Carsten Fritsch , an analyst at Commerzbank AG in  London , said in
a report today.  Corn for March delivery advanced 3 cents, or 0.4 percent,
to $6.815 a bushel at 1:14 p.m. London time on the Chicago Board
of Trade. Prices reached $6.825, the highest level for a most-
active contract since July 15, 2008. The grain is up 8.3 percent
this year.  Chinese corn imports that met the council’s estimate would
be more than double the record 4.3 million tons set in 1995.
Demand is increasing after the Asian nation’s government sold
grain from state warehouses to curb food prices.  Corn Inventories  “With increasing demand for corn from China and ethanol
producers, supplies of the grain will be tightening this year,”
said Han Sung Min, a broker at Korea Exchange Bank Futures Co.
in  Seoul . “This may drive the U.S. government to lower its
forecast for global stockpiles further this week.”  Wheat for March delivery advanced 8.25 cents, or 1 percent,
to $8.62 a bushel. The grain reached $8.7275, the highest level
since August 2008, on Feb. 3. Milling wheat for March delivery
traded on NYSE Liffe in Paris added 1 percent to 277.50 euros
($376.65) a ton.  Egypt, the world’s largest wheat importer, will raise its
spending to buy the grain by 1.5 billion Egyptian pounds ($252
million), the Cairo-based  Finance Ministry  said Feb. 5. Also
that day, the country purchased 170,000 tons of wheat.  Almost two weeks of protests across Egypt against President  Hosni Mubarak  left as many as 300 people dead, according to the
United Nations. Elevated food prices contributed to the
demonstrations. The ministry had already allotted an extra 1.3
billion pounds for commodity purchases.  Soybeans for March delivery gained 9.25 cents, or 0.6
percent, to $14.4275 a bushel in Chicago.  To contact the reporters on this story:
