  South Africa  will allow mining
companies to submit applications for prospecting rights online
in an effort to increase transparency and efficiency, Mineral
Resources Minister Susan Shabangu said.  A moratorium on new applications for prospecting rights,
imposed at the beginning of September, will be lifted at the end
of March, she said in a statement distributed in Cape Town
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
