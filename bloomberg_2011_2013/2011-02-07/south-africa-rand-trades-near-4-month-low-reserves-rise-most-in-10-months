The rand fell against the dollar,
extending this year’s slump to worst performer among emerging
markets, as the central bank boosted foreign reserves by the
most in 10 months as it steps up efforts to curb currency gains.    South Africa ’s currency declined as much as 0.5 percent to
7.2918 per dollar and traded 0.2 percent weaker at 7.2649 by
4:20 p.m. in Johannesburg, taking its loss this year to 8.7
percent. The move put the rand within 6 cents of the 7.3189
reached on Feb. 4, the weakest intraday level since Sept. 2.  Gross reserves rose 3.7 percent from the previous month to
$45.5 billion in January, the Pretoria-based  Reserve Bank  said
on its website today. That was the biggest increase since March.  “The South African Reserve Bank has clearly become a lot
more aggressive in the market,” analysts including John Cairns,
head of foreign-exchange research at Rand Merchant Bank, wrote
in a client note today. “Combine this with significant selling
out of our domestic  bond market  and one can understand why the
rand has been so weak.”  Today’s reserve data suggests that the central bank
purchased $1.1 billion last month, RMB, which is the investment
banking arm of FirstRand Ltd., South  Africa ’s second largest
financial services group, said in the note.  The rand had its biggest monthly drop in two years in
January, slumping 7.6 percent. Finance Minister  Pravin Gordhan 
pledged in his mid-term budget speech in October to transfer
part of the government’s higher-than-estimated tax revenue to
the central bank to boost reserves to weaken the rand.  Yield Advantage Eroded  South Africa’s currency also slid this year as investors
dumped the country’s bonds on expectations the yield advantage
of other nations will rise faster than in Africa’s biggest
economy.  Brazil , Poland,  South Korea , Malaysia and  Australia 
have all started raising  interest rates , boosting their yield
advantage over South Africa, where the benchmark rate is at a
30-year low.  Central bank Governor Gill Marcus said the 5.5 percent main
interest rate is expected to remain “relatively stable for some
time,” following a unanimous decision by the monetary policy
committee to leave it unchanged on Jan. 20.  The yield on the 13.5 percent security due September 2015
surged 52 basis points last month as foreign investors sold the
securities. The so-called R157 bond climbed 19 cents today to
121.26 rand, reducing the yield by 5 basis points, or 0.05
percentage point, to 7.90 percent.  The longer-dated 10.5 percent bond maturing December 2026,
known by traders as the R186, climbed 32 cents to 115.52 rand,
pushing the yield down 3 basis points to 8.68 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
