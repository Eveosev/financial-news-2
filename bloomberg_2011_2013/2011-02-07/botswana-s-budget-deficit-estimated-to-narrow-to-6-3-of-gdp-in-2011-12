Botswana, the world’s biggest diamond
producer, plans to slash its fiscal deficit in 2011-12, as it
moves balance its budget the year after, after gem sales
rebounded from the global financial crisis.  The deficit will probably narrow to 6.3 percent of gross
domestic product in the year through March 2012 from an
estimated 10.1 percent this year, Finance Minister Kenneth Matambo said in a budget speech today in the capital, Gaborone.
The economy expanded by 10.7 percent last year, buoyed by a 21.7
percent expansion in the  mining industry , he said.  “The objective is to follow an expenditure path that is
consistent with the commitment to reach a balanced budget by
2012-13,” he said. “If the economic recovery can be sustained,
we will be on track to balance our budget.”  The  budget deficit  in the southern African country, which
accounts for about a fifth of global diamond output, widened
when the global economic crisis led to a slump in mining
exports. Some mines were forced to close, leading to an economic
contraction of 6 percent in 2009, according to the central bank.
The government cut spending and froze public sector salaries. A
rebound in gem sales has boosted the economy and tax collection.  State spending is forecast at 41 billion pula in 2011-12
and revenue at 34.1 billion pula, of which mining accounted for
a third, Matambo said.  Botswana’s economic growth is expected to slow to 6.8
percent in 2011 before accelerating to 7.1 percent next year,
Matambo said. Inflation is forecast to slow to below 6 percent
in the second half of this year, he said. Annual inflation was
7.4 percent in December, the central statistics office said on
Jan. 14.  Single  Tax Rate   The government plans to sell 49 percent of Botswana
Telecommunications Corp. by the end of April and is finalizing
an asset sale program, Matambo said. The state will impose a
single corporate tax rate of 22 percent from the next fiscal
year, he said.  The tax rate replaces the two-tier system of a 15 percent
rate and an additional tax of 10 percent.  Botswana took a $1.5 billion loan from the  African
Development Bank  in 2009, the first in 17 years, as diamond-
export earnings fell and borrowed 943 million pula from the  World Bank  last year to boost electricity capacity.  To contact the reporter on this story:
