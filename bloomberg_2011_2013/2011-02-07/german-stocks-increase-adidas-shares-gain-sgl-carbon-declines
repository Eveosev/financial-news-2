German stocks rose, sending the  DAX
Index  to its highest level in three years, on speculation
increasing corporate earnings will continue to support the rally
in equities.    Adidas AG  gained 3.6 percent after Chief Executive Officer
Herbert Hainer was reported as forecasting a positive growth
trend for 2011 and higher sales from China. GEA Group AG jumped
6.2 percent after the engineering company reported profit that
beat analysts’ estimates. SolarWorld AG surged 6.7 percent after
full-year earnings advanced.  The benchmark DAX added 0.9 percent to 7,283.62 at the 5:30
p.m. close in  Frankfurt , the highest level since January 2008.
The gauge has gained 5.3 percent this year amid optimism that
the global economic recovery is gathering strength. The broader  HDAX Index  rose 1 percent today.  “It doesn’t look like the world economy is going to lose
any momentum in 2011, if anything it is gaining momentum,” said  Mike Lenhoff , chief strategist in  London  at Brewin Dolphin
Securities Ltd., whose parent company oversees $33 billion.
“This will be supportive for equities.”  Factory Orders  Stocks maintained gains even after a report showed German
factory orders declined more than expected in December. Orders
dropped 3.4 from the previous month, adjusted for seasonal
swings and inflation. A Bloomberg survey of economists had
forecast a decline of 1.5 percent. Orders increased 5.2 percent
in November from the prior month.  “Many are arguing for a correction given that the market
appears overbought and the sentiment is seen as overly
bullish,” JPMorgan Chase & Co. London-based equity strategist  Mislav Matejka  wrote in a report today. “We believe risk-reward
for stocks remains compelling, and continue to advise buying
into any weakness.”  Adidas gained 3.6 percent to 47.69 euros, the biggest rally
since September. Hainer said the company will grow significantly
this year after a strong 2010, Deutsches Anleger Fernsehen
reported, citing an interview. Adidas will grow 15 percent to 20
percent annually in  China  over the next five years and exceed 1
billion euros in revenue ($1.36 billion) this year, Hainer said,
according to the television interview.  Raised Dividend  GEA jumped 6.2 percent to 22.78 euros. The engineering
company supplying the food and energy industries reported
earnings for last year that beat analysts’ estimates and raised
its dividend.  The Bochum, Germany-based company proposed to lift its
dividend to 40 cents a share from 30 cents, it said in a
statement today. Earnings before interest and taxes before
restructuring expenses rose to 140 million euros, ahead of a 118
million-euro Commerzbank estimate.
     SolarWorld rose 6.7 percent to 8.34 euros after the German
solar-cell manufacturer said full-year earnings before interest
and tax increased to 193 million euros from 153 million euros.  Separately, the stock was raised to “neutral” from
“underperform” at Credit Suisse Group AG, which wrote in a
report that there is “too much upside risk to remain bearish”
on the stock. SolarWorld has rebounded 14 percent this year
after a 50 percent slump in 2010. WestLB AG upgraded the stock
to “add” from “neutral.”    Deutsche Bank AG ,  Germany ’s largest bank, gained 1.3
percent to 46.82 euros, its fifth straight advance. The stock
was raised to “buy” from “add” by analysts at Commerzbank
AG, who cited higher earnings estimates for the lender.  Air Berlin, Drillisch        Air Berlin Plc  advanced 3.8 percent to 3.58 euros. The
airline’s passenger traffic increased 5.7 percent to 2.15
million in January, the airline said today. The January load
factor rose to 72 percent from 69 percent, the Berlin-based
company said.    Drillisch AG  climbed 5.7 percent to 6.91 euros, its sixth
consecutive increase. The company said it plans to increase its
dividend for 2010 by 70 percent to 50 euro cents after reporting
a 13 percent gain in full-year adjusted earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.    SGL Carbon SE  declined 1.6 percent to 27.09 euros. The
stock was cut to “neutral” from “buy” at UBS AG, which also
downgraded its price estimate to 28 euros from 30 euros.  -- With assistance from Julie Cruz in Frankfurt. Editors: Will
