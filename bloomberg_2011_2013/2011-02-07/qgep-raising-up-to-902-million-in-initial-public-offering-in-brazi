QGEP Participacoes SA , the energy
exploration and production unit of Queiroz Galvao SA, is raising
as much as 1.52 billion reais ($902 million) in an initial
public offering, less than expected.  QGEP’s shares were priced at 19 reais each, less than the
range of 23 to 29 reais that was included in the company’s  Jan.
21 prospectus . The primary sale includes 69.3 million shares,
plus a supplementary offering of as much as 10.4 million shares,
according to a regulatory filing today.    Oil companies  are selling shares and seeking partners in  Brazil  to cover costs and reduce exploration risks.  HRT
Participacoes em Petroleo SA , aiming to be the country’s largest
private oil and gas producer, raised about $1.5 billion in an
October IPO to help fund exploration in the Amazon and off the
coast of Namibia.  QGEP has the concessions for eight blocks, including some
pre-salt fields, in the Santos, Jequitinhonha and Camamu basins
off the Brazilian coast, according to the prospectus. The
company also has a 45 percent stake in the offshore Campo de
Manati gas field, which has a production capacity of 50,300
barrels of oil equivalent a day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
