Russian banks boosted lending to
retail clients at the fastest monthly pace since September 2008
as record-low  interest rates  and growing consumer optimism about
the country’s economic recovery spurred demand for credit.  Retail lending rose 2.2 percent in December, the biggest
gain in 27 months, after a 1.5 percent increase in November, the
central bank said today in a  report  on its website. Corporate
loans advanced 1.1 percent, compared with 1.6 percent the
previous month.  The central bank has sought to spur lending and economic
growth by keeping its refinancing rate at a record-low 7.75
percent since June. Rather than raise the benchmark rate, Bank
Rossii tried to cool inflation by increasing the deposit rate in
December and the reserve ratio for banks last month.  Russian  consumer confidence  rose in the fourth quarter,
gaining 1 percentage point to minus 10 after retreating 4
percentage points in the previous three months, the  Federal
Statistics Service  said Jan. 11. Economic growth in 2011 will
probably exceed last year’s 4 percent rate, Finance Minister
Alexei Kudrin said Feb. 2. The economy of the world’s biggest
energy supplier contracted 7.8 percent in 2009.  Overdue bank loans dropped to 5.7 percent of all lending in
December, the lowest level since July 2009, according to
Bloomberg calculations based on central bank data released
today.  Delinquent corporate loans improved to 5.3 percent from 5.6
percent in November, and non-performing consumer loans totaled
6.9 percent compared with 7.3 percent a month earlier.  Loan Growth Accelerates  Lending is set to increase by 20 percent this year, central
bank Chairman Sergey Ignatiev said Dec. 8. Retail lending rose
14.3 percent last year after shrinking 11 percent in 2009. That
outpaced the 12.1 percent increase in corporate lending after a
0.3 percent gain in 2009, central bank data show.  The financial industry’s “main indicators,” including
loans and assets, will probably gain between 17 percent and 20
percent a year during the next five years, growing at about half
the pre-crisis pace and helping the government slow inflation to
5 percent by 2015, Ignatiev said during a government meeting on
Jan. 24.  The banking industry posted a combined profit of 573.4
billion rubles ($19.5 billion) last year, almost triple the 2009
figure of 205.1 billion rubles, Bank Rossii said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
