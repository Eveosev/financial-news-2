Natural gas futures posted their
biggest weekly drop in more than eight months on the outlook for
demand, as stockpiles rose more than expected and commodities
tumbled on speculation that economic growth will slow.  Gas dropped 9.9 percent this week, the most since the five-
days ended Aug. 27, after the Energy Department said inventories
increased by 72 billion cubic feet last week, above the 67
billion analysts estimated. Commodities slid the most in 31
months yesterday and extended declines today.  “The meltdown in commodities drove a bit of a selloff for
gas,” said Gordy Elliott, a risk-management specialist at FC
Stone LLC in  St. Louis Park ,  Minnesota . “The gas industry seems
quite confident about its ability to keep production levels
up.”  Natural gas for June delivery fell 2.6 cents, or 0.6
percent, to settle at $4.235 per million British thermal units
on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . The futures have dropped
3.9 percent this year.  Gas stockpiles rose to 1.757 trillion cubic feet in the
week ended April 29, the Energy Department reported yesterday.
Storage injections for the previous two weeks had fallen short
of analysts’ predictions as compiled by Bloomberg. Inventories
were 1 percent below the five-year average.  “We haven’t been very far on either side of the five-year
average storage level” for the past few weeks, said  Tim Evans ,
an energy analyst with Citi Futures Perspective in  New York .  Commodity Markets  Commodities tumbled yesterday as the dollar climbed against
the euro after European Central Bank President  Jean-Claude
Trichet  said inflation risks will be watched “very closely,”
signaling the ECB may wait until after June to raise rates.  A strengthening dollar makes commodities priced in the
currency less attractive for investors.  Crude oil for June delivery tumbled $2.62, or 2.6 percent,
to $97.18 a barrel in New York, the lowest settlement price
since Feb. 28 and capping the biggest weekly decline since
December 2008.  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index of commodities fell 6.5
percent yesterday, the most since Jan. 7, 2009, and lost 0.9
percent today.  The U.S. jobless rate climbed to 9 percent, the first
increase since November, the Labor Department said today in
 Washington . Applications for jobless benefits gained 43,000 to
474,000 in the week ended April 30, the most since August,
department figures showed yesterday.  The measure of employee output per hour increased at a 1.6
percent annual rate after a 2.9 percent gain the prior three
months, according to the department.  Mild Weather  Mostly normal temperatures are likely in the eastern and
central U.S. from May 11 through May 15, according to Commodity
Weather Group in Bethesda,  Maryland . The mild weather may reduce
the demand for gas for heating and cooling.  The high temperature in New York on May 12 may be 69
degrees Fahrenheit (21 Celsius), 1 degree below normal,
according to AccuWeather Inc. in  State College ,  Pennsylvania .  Power plants  use 30 percent of the nation’s gas supplies,
according to the Energy Department.  Gas futures volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was
306,293 as of 3:20 p.m., compared with the three-month average
of 324,000. Volume was 476,447 yesterday. Open interest was
998,631 contracts, down from a record a day earlier. The three-
month average open interest is 939,000.  The exchange has a one-business-day delay in reporting open
interest and full volume data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
