Germans should invest their savings
in emerging-market funds to bolster their pensions rather than
accept the low interest rates lenders offer on deposits,  Juergen Fitschen , co-chief executive officer of  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) , said.  “We have a sustainable overhang of deposits in Germany,”
Fitschen said at a conference in Frankfurt today. “It isn’t
good for young  emerging markets  to be investing their surpluses
in mature markets. Capital should go the other direction.”  German deposits have swollen as consumers shy from
investing amid the European sovereign debt crisis and as savers
abroad transfer funds to the euro area’s perceived safe haven.
The country’s economy risks becoming less competitive if a
culture of risk-aversion sets in, said Fitschen, 64.  “We could say we have enough risks in our lives and put
our money in accounts at savings and cooperative banks where
we’d get no interest but could feel no one could take it away,”
he said. “If society wants to take that approach, it will lose
competitive dynamic.”  Fitschen also said that while all banks are “welcome” in
Germany, “you have to wonder what banks that offer
significantly higher  interest rates  than we do are doing with
the money.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
