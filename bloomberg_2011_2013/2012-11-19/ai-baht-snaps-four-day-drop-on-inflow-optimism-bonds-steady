Thailand’s baht snapped a four-day
decline after U.S. President  Barack Obama  expressed confidence
he will be able to reach a budget agreement with Congress,
boosting risk sentiment.  Government bonds  were steady.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  of shares climbed by the most
in a month as Obama began a new round of deficit-reduction talks
with top Republicans and Democrats in a bid to avoid automatic
tax increases and spending cuts set to take effect in January,
the so-called fiscal cliff. Foreign funds  bought  $481 million
more sovereign notes than they sold this month, according to
data from the Thai Bond Market Association.  “Asia is still the place where investors like to put their
money,” said Disawat Tiaowvanich, a foreign-exchange trader at
 Bangkok Bank Pcl. (BBL)  “But investors want to see how the U.S. will
deal with the fiscal cliff.”  The baht appreciated 0.2 percent to 30.71 per dollar as of
8:48 a.m. in Bangkok, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
One-month implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate swings
used to price options, was unchanged at 4.3 percent.  Southeast Asia’s second-largest economy expanded 3 percent
in the third quarter from a year earlier, compared with 4.2
percent growth in the previous three months, according to the
median estimate in a Bloomberg survey before official data due
9:30 a.m. local time.  The yield on the 3.625 percent notes due May 2015 was
little changed at 2.88 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
