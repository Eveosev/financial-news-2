British Sky Broadcasting Group Plc (BSY) ,
the U.K.’s biggest pay-TV provider, sold $800 million of 10-year
bonds in its first debt sale in four years.  The company, in which  Rupert Murdoch ’s News Corp. owns
about 39 percent, issued the 3.125 percent debentures to yield
157 basis points more than similar-maturity Treasuries,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The coupon is the
company’s lowest on record, the data show. Proceeds will be used
to refinance debt and for general corporate purposes.  BSkyB previously sold bonds in November 2008, issuing $600
million of 9.5 percent, 10-year debentures to yield 587.5 basis
points more than similar-maturity Treasuries, Bloomberg data
show. The debt was quoted at 140.1 cents on the dollar to yield
2.29 percent on Nov. 16, according to prices compiled by
Bloomberg.  The new securities may be rated Baa1 by Moody’s Investors
Service, according to a person familiar with the transaction,
who asked not to be identified citing lack of authorization to
speak publicly. Barclays Plc and JPMorgan Chase & Co. managed
the offering for the Middlesex, U.K.-based company, Bloomberg
data show.  BSkyB reported a 5.1 percent increase in fiscal first-
quarter operating profit to $310 million pounds ($493 million)
on Nov. 1, which beat analyst estimates.  News Corp. (NWSA)  abandoned its 7.8 billion-pound bid for the rest
of the company in July after allegations of phone hacking at its
now-defunct News of the World tabloid engulfed the media company
and prompted an unprecedented political backlash.  To contact the reporter on this story:
