Chile’s peso rose from a 16-week low
after the central bank reported faster-than-forecast growth and
as copper gained on optimism a U.S. deal can be reached to avoid
automatic spending cuts and tax increases.  The peso appreciated 1.1 percent to 479.75 per  U.S. dollar 
at 12:07 p.m. in Santiago after falling to 484.79 on Nov. 16,
the weakest close since July 26. Copper for March delivery rose
1.8 percent to $3.525 a pound on the Comex in New York today.  The MSCI World Index of global stocks advanced 1.7 percent
on speculation the  U.S. economy  may avoid $600 billion of tax
increases and spending cuts in January. House Speaker  John
Boehner  and White House Press Secretary  Jay Carney  described a
Nov. 16 meeting on the so-called fiscal cliff as constructive.  “There are expectations of a deal soon,” said Francisco Schneider, the head of foreign exchange at Celfin Capital SA.
“Markets are more optimistic.”  Chile’s economy grew 5.7 percent in the three months
through September from a year earlier, the central bank reported
today. That is the second straight quarter the economy has
beaten the median forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  The two-year swap rate rose six basis points, or 0.06
percentage point, to 5.06 percent. The three-year rate rose six
basis points to 5.11 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
