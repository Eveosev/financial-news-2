Carson Block , the founder of Muddy
Waters LLC, said he’s betting against shares of  Olam
International Ltd. (OLAM)  because he questions the accounting methods
used by the Singaporean trader of agricultural products.  Speaking today at the Ira Sohn Investment Conference in
London, Block said Olam is booking  profits  on transactions
before it’s clear how deals will work out over time. Olam is
“heavily” indebted and aggressive in how it reports so-called
biological gains on its investments, he said.  “It’s a leap of faith to think the company is being honest
with its valuation” gains, Block told the conference. “We
think the company will fail.” Recoveries for Olam  investors 
will be “negligible,” he added.  Aditya Renjen, a spokesman for Olam, couldn’t immediately
be reached outside of normal business hours for comment. A call
to Olam’s  London  office went to voicemail and wasn’t immediately
returned.  To contact the reporter on this story:
