Telkom SA advanced for the first
time in two weeks after  Africa ’s biggest fixed-line operator
reduced losses at its fast-growing mobile phone unit 8ta and
appointed a new chairman.  Shares in the Pretoria-based company gained as much as 3.1
percent and traded 2 percent higher at 15.95 rand by 4:49 p.m.
in Johannesburg, on track for the first daily increase since
Nov. 2. More than 1.3 million shares changed hands, 93 percent
of the daily average over the past three months.  Revenue at 8ta, the mobile phone unit started in 2010,
jumped 198 percent to 898 million rand ($101 million) in the six
months through September, while earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization at the unit fell 45 percent, the
company said in a statement today. Telkom wants to expand into
higher-margin mobile and broadband markets to offset declines at
its traditional fixed-line business.  “8ta isn’t burning quite as much cash as it did and that’s
about the only positive you can take from these results,” Chris Gilmour, an analyst at Johannesburg-based Absa Investments, said
by phone. “The announcement on Friday of Jabu Mabuza as
chairman is also a very positive thing; I think this signals a
sea change in the top management of Telkom.”  Mabuza, who is also deputy chairman of  Tsogo Sun Holdings
Ltd. (TSH) , was one of two new directors appointed to Telkom’s board
to replace departing members including previous chairman Lazarus Zim. Chief Executive Officer Nombulelo Moholi has also said she
will step down.  Telkom, 39.8 percent owned by the South African government,
reported a 65 percent decline in first-half earnings per share
to 30.2 cents as costs rose. It also made provisions for a 449
million rand antitrust fine for abusing its dominant position in
the telecommunications industry between 1999 and 2004.  The company’s  30-day historical volatility , a measure of
stock swings, increased to 29.63 from 29.48 on Nov. 16. The
FTSE/JSE Africa All Share Index’s  30-day volatility measure was 
at 8.86 versus 8.96 previously. A higher reading means an
asset’s price can have bigger moves.  To contact the reporter on this story:
