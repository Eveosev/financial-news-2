Rob Gronkowski  of the New England
Patriots will miss the next four to six weeks with a broken
forearm, NFL.com reported, citing an unidentified person close
to the All-Pro tight end.  Gronkowski, the only tight end in National Football League
history to have at least 10 touchdown catches in three straight
seasons, left yesterday’s 59-24 win against the Indianapolis
Colts in the fourth quarter. He had seven receptions for 137
yards and two touchdowns before the injury.  Gronkowski, 23, has 31 touchdown catches in his past 30
regular-season games for the Patriots. He has 53 catches for 748
yards and 10 scores this season for New England, which has won
four straight games to improve to 7-3.  The Patriots, who next visit the  New York  Jets in a
Thanksgiving Day game on Nov. 22, have also been without tight
end  Aaron Hernandez  since Week 7 because of an ankle injury.  To contact the reporter on this story:
