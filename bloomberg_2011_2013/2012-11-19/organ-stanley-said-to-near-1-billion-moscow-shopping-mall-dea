Morgan Stanley (MS)  bought a Moscow
shopping mall in the biggest acquisition of a Russian retail
property, according to the New York-based bank.  A fund managed by Morgan Stanley acquired Metropolis
Shopping and Entertainment Mall from  Capital Partners , the
Kazakh developer that opened the property in 2009, the bank said
in a statement today. Morgan Stanley paid about $1.2 billion for
the mall, two people familiar with the transaction said. They
asked not to be identified because the terms haven’t been made
public.  The deal follows Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund VII’s $1.1
billion purchase of the Galeria mall in  St. Petersburg  last
year. That transaction contributed to an annual 4 percent
Increase in Russian commercial real estate sales during the
first nine months of last year, according to data compiled by
Real Capital Analytics Inc.  “The acquisition of Metropolis will deliver operational
synergies and strategic benefits associated with owning two
prime shopping centers in Russia,” said Morgan Stanley, which
described the purchase as the largest ever in the country’s
commercial real estate market.  The Metropolis mall in northwest Moscow, near the main
highway to the city’s airport, has 82,000 square meters of
retail space and 2,900 parking spaces. The shopping center
attracted about 55,000 visitors a day last year, Morgan Stanley
said.  Capital Partners  was advised by  Jones Lang LaSalle Inc. (JLL)   To contact the reporter on this story:
