Ukraine will probably export a
record 3.2 million metric tons of grains this month, according
to the Ukrainian Grain Association.  Shipments came to 1.8 million tons in Novemberâ€™s first 16
days, of which wheat made up 900,000 tons, the Kiev-based
industry group said in a statement on its website dated Nov. 16.
Deliveries also included 800,000 tons of corn, it showed.  Grain exports in the current marketing year begun July 1
were 10.3 million tons as of Nov. 16, including 5 million tons
of wheat, 3.6 million tons of corn and 1.6 million tons of
barley, according to the association.  Average daily shipments declined to around 47,000 tons
between Nov. 12 and Nov. 16 from 65,000 tons in the Nov. 5-12
period, according to the statement.  To contact the reporters on this story:
