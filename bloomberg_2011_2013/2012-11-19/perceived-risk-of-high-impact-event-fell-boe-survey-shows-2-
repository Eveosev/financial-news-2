The perceived probability of the
U.K. financial system suffering a high-impact event fell in the
second half from the first, according to the results of the Bank
of England’s Systemic Risk Survey published today.  The chances of such an event are low, according to 34
percent of respondents, up from 23 percent in the first half,
the BOE said in a report on its website. Twenty percent said the
probability is high or very high, down 16 percentage points.  Confidence in the stability of the U.K. financial system
also improved, with 16 percent saying they’re completely or very
confident, up 3 points. Fourteen percent said they’re not very
confident, down 8 points.  One in 10 of those surveyed said public anger or distrust
of financial institutions was one of the most pressing risks
facing the industry, with “the main concern around
repercussions, in terms of financial penalties and reputational
damage, from the Libor scandal,” according to the report.  Regulators are probing at least a dozen financial firms
over allegations they colluded to manipulate the London
interbank offered rate, the benchmark for $300 trillion of
securities from mortgages to  student loans .  The central bank surveyed 79 market participants at banks,
asset managers,  hedge funds  and other large financial
institutions, mostly executives responsible for firms’ risk-
management activities, from Sept. 24 to Oct. 25.  To contact the reporter on this story:
