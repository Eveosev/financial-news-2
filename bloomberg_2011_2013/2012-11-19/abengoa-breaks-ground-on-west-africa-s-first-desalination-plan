Abengoa SA (ABG) , the Spanish company
that’s developed desalination plants from Algeria to India and
China, has broken ground on West Africa’s first desalination
facility, a venture meant to benefit 500,000 people in Ghana.  The Nungua desalination plant will require a $125 million
investment and have the capacity to produce 60,000 cubic meters
of drinking water a day using reverse-osmosis technology, said
Abengoa, which is responsible for designing and constructing
facility in Accra, the country’s capital.  Work on the plant is expected to take 24 months, Abengoa
said. The project is receiving $179 million in backing from the
Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency, the political risk
insurance arm of the  World Bank .  Sojitz Corp. (2768)  last month said a subsidiary, Daye Water
Investment ( Ghana ) BV of the Netherlands, will take part in the
water project with Abengoa, whose shares have dropped 42 percent
this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
