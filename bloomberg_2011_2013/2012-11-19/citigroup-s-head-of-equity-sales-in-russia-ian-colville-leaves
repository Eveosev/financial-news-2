Citigroup Inc. (C) ’s head of equity
sales for Russia and the Commonwealth of Independent States, Ian Colville, said he left the bank after two years in the position.  The American, previously employed by  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  in
Moscow as head of equity sales, confirmed by telephone he had
departed without elaborating on the reasons. Colville joined the
company in September 2010 from Carpathian Capital Management,
where he was a fund manager. Irina Kiparoidze, a Citigroup
spokeswoman in Moscow, couldn’t immediately comment when reached
by telephone.  Western investment banks have been retreating and scaling
back in Moscow because of falling revenue and reduced margins.
ING Groep NV, the biggest Dutch financial services company, said
last month it will close its Russian equities unit following
 UniCredit SpA (UCG) , which said in June it would shutter its Russian
securities operation. Will Hammond, a senior Moscow equity
salesman, left Citigroup in July as part of the group’s drive to
eliminate jobs and cut costs.  Stephen Jennings , who founded Russia’s Renaissance Capital
17 years ago, said on Nov. 15 he is stepping down after
billionaire Mikhail Prokhorov rebuffed his requests seeking more
cash for the money-losing investment bank, according to two
people with knowledge of the talks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
