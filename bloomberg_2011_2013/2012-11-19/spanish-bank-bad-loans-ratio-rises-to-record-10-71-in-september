Spanish lenders saw bad loans as a
proportion of total lending climb to a record 10.71 percent in
September as the country’s five-year slump spurred non-payment
by companies and real estate developers.  The ratio increased from a revised 10.52 percent in August
as 3.65 billion euros of loans  turned sour  in the month, the
Bank of  Spain  said on its website today. The bad-loans ratio was
7.16 percent a year ago.  Spain’s recession continues to push loan  defaults  to new
highs as lenders, including  Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA (BBVA) ,
report rising non-payment by companies and property developers.
The government introduced rules last week to protect low-income
families from eviction after mounting mortgage defaults spurred
home repossessions by banks.  Bank lending  expanded 0.2 percent in September from August
and dropped 4.9 percent from the same month a year ago, the Bank
of Spain said. Deposits rose 1.4 percent from the previous month
and declined 7.3 percent from a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
