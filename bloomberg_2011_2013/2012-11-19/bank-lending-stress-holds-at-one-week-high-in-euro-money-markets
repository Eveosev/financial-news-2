European banks’ reluctance to lend
to one another held at the highest in a week, according to a
money-market indicator.  The difference between the euro interbank offered rate and
overnight indexed swaps, known as the Euribor-OIS spread, was
little changed at 12.4 basis points, or 0.124 percentage point,
at 8:30 a.m. in  London , the highest since Nov. 8, data compiled
by Bloomberg show. The measure has risen from 10.4 basis points
on Oct. 26, the lowest since August 2007.  The cost for European banks to borrow in dollars fell from
the highest in two months. The three-month cross-currency basis
swap was 29 basis points below Euribor from minus 30 on Nov. 16.
The one-year basis swap was 31 basis points below Euribor from
minus 31.6.  The European Banking Federation’s euro overnight index
average, or Eonia, of unsecured lending deals was set at 0.079
percent on Nov. 16 from 0.078 percent the day before. The Eonia
swap, an estimate of average overnight borrowing costs over the
next three months, was little changed at 6.8 basis points.  Lenders increased  overnight deposits  at the European
Central Bank on Nov. 16 to 216 billion euros ($276 billion) from
214 billion euros the day before, the least since December 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
