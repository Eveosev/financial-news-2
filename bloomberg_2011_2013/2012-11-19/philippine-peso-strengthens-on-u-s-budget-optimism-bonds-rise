The Philippine peso strengthened,
snapping a five-day decline, as speculation the U.S. will
resolve its budget deadlock spurred demand for riskier assets.  The currency advanced the most since Oct. 25 as the nation
reported a sixth straight month of surplus in its balance of
payments. Asian stocks rose the most in a month after President
 Barack Obama  expressed confidence he and Congress would reach an
agreement to avoid the so-called fiscal cliff involving $607
billion of spending cuts and tax increases.  “The situation in the U.S. could turn out to be a long
grind but people are hopeful there won’t be a breakdown,” said
Patrick Ella, an economist in  Manila  at Security Bank Corp.
“There’s better sentiment.”  The peso appreciated 0.4 percent to 41.19 per dollar in
Manila, according to data from Tullett Prebon Plc. The currency
fell 0.7 percent last week, the most since the five-day period
ended Aug. 17. It may trade between 41.15 and 41.40 this week,
Ella said.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate
swings used to price options, fell to 4.6 percent from 4.7
percent on Nov. 16, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The  Philippines  had balance of payments surpluses of $604
million in October and $6.43 billion in the first 10 months,
according to official figures released today.  The yield on the 5.875 percent bonds due March 2032
declined one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 5.64
percent, according to Tradition Financial Services.  The treasury plans to sell 9 billion pesos ($218 million)
of seven-year bonds tomorrow, according to its sales calendar.
It last sold similar-maturity notes on Aug. 28 at an average
yield of 4.662 percent and canceled an auction on Oct. 23.  To contact the reporter on this story:
