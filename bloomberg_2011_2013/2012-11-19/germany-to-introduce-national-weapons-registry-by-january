Germany  is introducing a national
firearms registry that will be operational next year,
implementing a European Union directive two years ahead of its
due date.  The register will pool nearly 550 local-level databases of
gun owners, the  Interior Ministry  said in an e-mailed statement
today. The EU weapons directive requires every member state to
put in place a national registry by December 31, 2014.  The German government decided to accelerate the
introduction of the catalog after a 2009 school shooting. A 17-
year-old gunman killed 15 people, including nine children and
three teachers, in a school in the town of Winnenden, near
Stuttgart, before committing suicide.  “The national weapons registry contributes significantly
to the security in Germany,” said German Interior Minister
 Hans-Peter Friedrich  in the statement. “Through the national
weapons registry, the police will be able to check countrywide,
who owns which weapon legally.”  In a second step, the registry will also track producers,
traders and importers of legally bought weapons in Germany. The
Cologne-based Federal Administration Office will operate the
database.  To contact the reporter on this story:
