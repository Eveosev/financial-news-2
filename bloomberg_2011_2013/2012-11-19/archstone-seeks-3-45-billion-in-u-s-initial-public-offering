Archstone Inc. (ASN) , the U.S. apartment
landlord that’s owned by the estate of Lehman Brothers Holdings
Inc., is seeking as much as $3.45 billion in its initial public
offering.  The Englewood, Colorado-based company updated the amount
sought in a  regulatory filing  today from a placeholder of $100
million. The company hasn’t yet specified the number of shares
it will sell or the price range, and the amount sought is
subject to change.  Lehman, which exited bankruptcy in March, took over all of
Archstone in May. The defunct bank filed Aug. 10 to take
Archstone public after battling billionaire  Sam Zell  to get full
control of the company, setting the stage for a multibillion-
dollar IPO later this year or early next.  Archstone, which plans to organize itself as a real estate
investment trust, plans its IPO as shares of U.S.  apartment
REITs  have gained 222 percent since dropping to a low in March
2009, outperforming the broader Bloomberg REIT index and the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  Rental  revenue  at Archstone in the three months through
Sept. 30 increased 8.3 percent to $272.7 million from a year
earlier, the filing showed. The company booked a net loss of
$176.6 million compared with profit of $106.2 million a year
earlier.  Citigroup Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. are leading the
offering.  To contact the reporter on this story:
