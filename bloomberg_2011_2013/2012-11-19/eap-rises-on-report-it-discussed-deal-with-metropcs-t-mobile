Leap Wireless International Inc. (LEAP) ,
the San Diego-based pay-as-you-go wireless carrier, rose 5.5
percent on a report that it held talks with MetroPCS
Communications Inc. about a three-way deal with  T-Mobile USA .  MetroPCS, which announced plans last month to merge with
Deutsche Telekom AG’s T-Mobile division, disclosed in a Nov. 16
filing that it previously discussed a deal involving a third
party as well. A person familiar with the situation identified
that company as Leap, Bloomberg reported today.  The shares rose to $6.30 at the close in New York. The
increase pared Leap’s year-to-date decline to 32 percent.  Leap, one of MetroPCS’s biggest competitors in the prepaid
market, has been struggling to hang on to customers as its
rivals upgrade to speedier networks that use a technology called
long-term evolution, or LTE. The company lost about 269,000
users last quarter.  To contact the reporters on this story:
