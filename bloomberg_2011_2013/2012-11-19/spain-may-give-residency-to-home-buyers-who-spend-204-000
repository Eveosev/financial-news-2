Spain  is considering granting
temporary residency to foreigners who buy homes valued at
160,000 euros ($204,000) or more, the deputy trade minister said
today.  “In coming weeks, we will start to reform the law
regarding foreigners to reactivate demand abroad and contribute
toward reducing housing stock,” Jaime Garcia-Legaz said at a
conference in Madrid. The changes are likely to have the most
effect on Russians and Chinese, he said.  The price level, which is the average for Spain, isn’t
definite, according to a spokesman for the deputy minister. The
measure would replicate agreements established in Ireland,
 Portugal  and the U.S., he said.  Spanish Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Garcia-Margallo
announced the plan in Congress on Nov. 14, the spokesman said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
