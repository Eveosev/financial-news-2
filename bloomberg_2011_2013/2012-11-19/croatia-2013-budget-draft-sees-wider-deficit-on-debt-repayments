Croatia’s  budget deficit  will widen
next year to 3.1 percent of economic output as the government
repays debt and begins contributing to the European Union’s
coffers upon entry in July.  “Our economic program for the next year is ambitious,
relying on boosting the economy by reducing the value-added tax
in tourism and some other branches, by continued fiscal
discipline and by becoming part of the EU market,” Finance
Minister Slavko Linic said as he submitted the 2013 budget draft
to Parliament today.  The 10-month-old  government  of Premier Zoran Milanovic has
vowed to reduce public-sector spending and remove obstacles to
investment to speed up the sale of state companies and bring the
economy out of a recession.  The budget draft forecasts economic growth at 1.8 percent
next year, compared with an expected contraction of 1.1 percent
in 2012, Linic said. Spending will increase to 124.5 billion
kuna ($21.1 billion) from a revised 120 billion this year, with
revenue seen at 113.7 billion kuna. The deficit this year is
seen at around 3 percent of gross domestic product.  While the government will cut spending on health care and
public wages, expenditures will rise because of 2 billion kuna
in interest payments on debt, including guarantees for
shipyards, and  Croatia ’s 1.7 billion kuna in contributions to
the EU.  Fiscal Consolidation  Though public debt will increase to 55 percent of GDP next
year and to 56 percent in 2013, the government “will continue
to strengthen capital investments, to stick with fiscal
consolidation and to coordinate policies with EU regulations,”
Linic said, adding state borrowing will total 26.7 billion kuna
in 2013.  The  International Monetary Fund  on Nov. 13 said Croatia’s
economy will shrink 1.5 percent this year, urging the government
to remove barriers to investment and employment growth in order
to return to growth in 2013. The European Commission said on
Nov. 7 the economy will contract 1.9 percent in 2012.  Fitch Ratings  raised Croatia’s outlook Sept. 5 to stable
from negative, citing the government’s progress in meeting
spending-cut demands and reducing the budget deficit during a
recession. It affirmed the long-term foreign currency rating at
BBB-, on par with EU members Latvia and  Bulgaria .  Croatia is rated an equivalent Baa3 at Moody’s, the lowest
investment grade, and BBB- by  Standard & Poor’s .  To contact the reporter on this story:
