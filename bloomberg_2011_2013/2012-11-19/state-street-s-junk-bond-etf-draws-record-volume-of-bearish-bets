Investors are placing a record
volume of bearish bets on junk bonds by shorting State Street
Corp.’s  exchange-traded fund  that owns the notes as the debt
loses value for the first month since May.  The volume of borrowed shares of the SPDR Barclays High
Yield Bond  ETF  surged to 22.8 million on Nov. 16, about three
times the average during the past year and up from 9.75 million
shares a month ago, according to Markit Group Ltd. In a short
sale, traders sell borrowed stock in a bet they can profit from
price declines.  Investors are using ETFs, which typically allow individuals
to speculate on securities without directly owning them, to
hedge against further declines in junk bonds as the notes lose
0.7 percent this month, according to Bank of America Merrill
Lynch index data. Speculative-grade debt funds reported $1.3
billion of redemptions last week, the biggest withdrawal since
June, as concern mounts that the U.S. economy won’t grow quickly
enough to support the most-indebted corporate balance sheets.  Borrowed shares of BlackRock’s junk-bond  ETF , the biggest
of its kind, rose to 7.4 million on Nov. 16, the most since Aug.
21, Markit data show. Unlike mutual funds, whose shares are
priced once daily, ETFs are listed on exchanges and are bought
and sold like stocks.  The five biggest junk-bond ETFs have lost $2.77 billion of
assets since Sept. 20, when the funds’ assets reached a high of
$31.98 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
