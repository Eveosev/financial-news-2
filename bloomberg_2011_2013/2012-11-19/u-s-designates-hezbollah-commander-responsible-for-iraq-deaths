The U.S. Treasury Department placed
sanctions on Ali Mussa Daqduq al-Musawi, a Hezbollah commander
responsible for attacks against coalition forces in  Iraq .  As a result, any of Daqduq’s property or interests in
property in the United States are blocked, and U.S. persons are
prohibited from engaging in transactions with him, Treasury
spokesman John Sullivan said today in an e-mail.  Daqduq is responsible for numerous acts, including planning
an attack on the Karbala Joint Provincial Coordination Center in
January of 2007 that killed five U.S. soldiers, the Treasury
Department said today in a written  statement .  An Iraqi court dismissed terrorism charges and false
documents charges against Daqduq on May 7, and on Nov. 16 he was
released from custody, according to the Treasury.  David Cohen, the Treasury’s undersecretary for terrorism
and financial intelligence, said in today’s statement that
Daqduq is a dangerous Hezbollah operative “responsible for
planning and carrying out numerous acts of terrorism in Iraq.”  “The United States is extremely disappointed he was
allowed to go free and we will continue our efforts to bring him
to justice,” Cohen said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
