Equinox Holdings Inc.’s $700 million
of covenant-lite term loans to refinance debt rose in initial
trading, according to Markit Group Ltd.  A $500 million first-lien term portion began trading Nov.

lien piece first changed hands at 99.25 cents, according to
Markit. The loans were sold to investors at 98.75 cents and 98
cents, respectively, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The first-lien slice pays interest at 4.25 percentage
points more than the London interbank offered rate, while the
second-lien portion pays interest at 8.5 percentage points more
than Libor, the data show. Both portions have a 1.25 percent
floor on the lending benchmark.  First-lien lenders were offered one-year soft-call
protection of 101 cents while second-lien creditors are being
offered hard-call protection of 103 cents during the first year
and 102 cents in the second year and 101 cents the following
year, the data show.  Bank of America Corp., Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. and Citigroup Inc. arranged the deal for the New York-based
