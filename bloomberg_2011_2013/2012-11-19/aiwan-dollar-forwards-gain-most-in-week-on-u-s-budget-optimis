Taiwan dollar forwards strengthened
by the most in a week after President  Barack Obama  expressed
optimism the U.S. will succeed in avoiding the so-called fiscal
cliff.  Government bonds  were little changed.  Obama began a new round of deficit-reduction talks with top
Republicans and Democrats in a bid to thwart automatic tax
increases and spending cuts that threaten to throw the country
into recession next year. Official data due tomorrow will show
Taiwan’s export orders rose 0.3 percent in October from a year
earlier, after a 1.9 percent expansion the previous month,
according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey.  “The fiscal cliff poses a lot of uncertainties as it’s not
an economic problem, it’s political,” said Samson Tu, a Taipei-
based  fund manager  at Uni-President Assets Management Corp.,
which oversees $700 million. “The  Taiwan dollar  will probably
continue its slow appreciation as other Asian currencies
continue to strengthen.”  One-month non-deliverable forwards climbed 0.2 percent to
NT$29.053 versus the greenback as of 4:21 p.m. in Taipei,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The contracts were at a
0.5 percent premium to the spot rate, which appreciated 0.2
percent to NT$29.202, based on Taipei Forex Inc. prices.  The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia  Dollar Index , which tracks the
region’s most-traded currencies, rose 0.1 percent today, taking
gains since June to 2.2 percent. Obama expressed confidence
yesterday that he could reach an agreement with Congress to
avoid the $607 billion of spending cuts and tax increases.  The yield on the Taiwanese government’s 1.125 percent bonds
due September 2022 was 1.118 percent, compared with 1.119
percent on Nov. 16, according to Gretai Securities Market. The
overnight  interbank lending rate  was little changed at 0.385
percent, a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan Interbank
Money Center shows.  To contact the reporter on this story:
