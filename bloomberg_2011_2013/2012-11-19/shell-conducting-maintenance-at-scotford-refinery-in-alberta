Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  has begun
maintenance at its  Scotford refinery  near  Edmonton ,  Alberta .  There will be no material effect on production, Stephen
Doolan, a company spokesman based in Calgary, said in an e-mail.  Doolan declined to disclose which unit is undergoing
maintenance or the duration of the work.  The plant can process 97,870 barrels of crude oil a day,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It produces gasoline,
jet fuel, diesel, propane, butane and sulfur, according to a
company  website .  The refinery is adjacent to an  upgrader  that can process
255,000 barrels a day of oil sands bitumen into lighter crude.  To contact the reporter on this story:
