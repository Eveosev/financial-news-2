YPF SA (YPFD)  said today its signed
agreements with Santa Cruz province to extend concessions have
received local legislature approval and were published in the
provincial official gazette.  Argentina’s largest energy producer has obtained a 25-year
extension for the concessions it has in the province, YPF said
in a regulatory filing today.  The concessions represented 16.9 percent of YPF’s total
reserves as of Dec. 31 2011, the filing said. YPF is based in
Buenos Aires.  In exchange for the extension, YPF agreed to pay 15 percent
in royalties for its oil and natural gas output and 10 percent
in royalties for its shale production, YPF said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
