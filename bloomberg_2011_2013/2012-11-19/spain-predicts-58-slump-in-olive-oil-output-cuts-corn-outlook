Spain ’s  Agriculture Ministry 
forecast a 58 percent plunge in olive-oil production this year,
predicted lower wine output and cut its outlook for corn.  Olive-oil production is predicted to slump to 673,700
metric tons from 1.6 million tons last year, the ministry wrote
in a  report  on its website.  Spain is the biggest exporter of olive oil, used in cooking
and salad dressings. The country had its second-driest summer in
60 years, with the June-through-to-August period the fourth-
warmest since 1961, the ministry said in September.  Wine production in Spain, the third-largest producer behind
France and  Italy , is estimated at 33.5 million hectoliters (885
million gallons), dropping 13 percent from 38.6 million
hectoliters in 2011, according to the report.  The corn harvest may fall 0.5 percent to 4.13 million tons
from 4.15 million tons in 2011, based on the situation at the
end of September, the ministry said, reversing an outlook for
the crop to rise 2.3 percent.  Wheat production fell 26 percent to an estimated 5.09
million tons, similar to the outlook a month earlier. Spanish
farmers harvested 5.98 million tons of barley, 28 percent less
than last year and 70,200 tons less than previously estimated,
the report showed.  Spain was the European Union’s second-biggest wheat
importer in the 2011-12 season, behind Italy, EU data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
