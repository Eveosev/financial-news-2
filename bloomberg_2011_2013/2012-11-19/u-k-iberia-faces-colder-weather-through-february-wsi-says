The U.K., Spain and Portugal will
probably face lower-than-normal temperatures in the next three
months, forecaster  WSI Corp . said.  “Most of the trends in the various models have been more
suggestive of increased winter blocking in the North Atlantic,”
 Todd Crawford , chief meteorologist at Andover, Massachusetts-
based WSI, said today in an e-mailed statement.   “Because of
this, we have made changes in our forecast towards colder winter
temperatures across parts of western  Europe .”  Higher-than-normal temperatures were expected across other
regions, especially western Russia, the forecaster said.  Recent changes to various long-lead indicators made the
weather picture for the winter period highly uncertain, WSI
said. The company has more than 200 energy clients in the U.S.
and Europe.  To contact the reporter on this story:
