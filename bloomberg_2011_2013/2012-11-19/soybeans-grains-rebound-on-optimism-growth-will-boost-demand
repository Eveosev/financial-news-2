Soybeans rose the most in three
weeks and grains advanced on optimism that the U.S. will avoid
the so-called fiscal cliff as  Europe  took steps to resolve a
Greek rescue, bolstering prospects for commodity demand.  President  Barack Obama  said yesterday he’s “confident”
about reaching an budget agreement with lawmakers to avoid $607
billion in automatic tax increases and spending cuts. European
finance officials met in Paris today to try to forge a common
position to aid  Greece .  “The perception is that the U.S. and European governments
will avoid a financial crisis, and that is bringing in some new
investor buying,” Greg Grow, the director of agribusiness at
Archer Financial Services Inc. in Chicago, said in a telephone
interview. “There are signs of end-users increasing forward
purchases to lock in lower prices.”  Soybean futures for January delivery rose 0.8 percent to
close at $13.9475 a bushel at 2 p.m. on the  Chicago  Board of
Trade, the biggest gain for a most-active contract since Oct.
24. The oilseed has dropped 22 percent from a record $17.89 on
Sept. 4 as rain improved crop prospects in Brazil, the world’s
second-biggest exporter, and the U.S.  U.S. exporters sold 20,000 metric tons of soybean oil to an
unknown buyer, the government said today.  Corn futures for March delivery climbed 1.6 percent to
$7.425 a bushel. The price has declined 13 percent from a record
$8.49 on Aug. 10.  Wheat futures for March delivery gained 0.5 percent to
$8.5775 a bushel. The price fell in the previous six  sessions,
the longest slump since September 2011.  The U.S. was the top exporter of the three commodities last
year. Corn is the nation’s biggest crop, valued at $76.5 billion
in 2011, followed by soybeans at $35.8 billion, government
figures show. Wheat is the fourth-largest at $14.4 billion,
behind hay.  To contact the reporter on this story:
