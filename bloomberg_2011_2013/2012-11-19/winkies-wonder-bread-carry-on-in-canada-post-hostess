Twinkie and Wonder Bread lovers in
the U.S. can still head north of the border to stock up on the
baked goods even with the bankruptcy of Hostess Brands Inc.  Saputo Inc. (SAP) ,  Canada ’s largest dairy processor, has the
trademark and brand rights to Hostess CupCakes and Hostess
Twinkies in the country and manufactures the products
themselves, said Sandy Vassiadis, a spokeswoman for the company.  “It’s totally separate,” she said, in an interview from
Saputo’s headquarters near  Montreal . “We own the rights in
Canada so what’s happening in the U.S. doesn’t affect us.”  The same holds true for Wonder Bread, which in Canada is
owned, manufactured and distributed by Toronto-based  George
Weston Ltd. (WN) , Canada’s largest food manufacturer and majority
owner of the Loblaw Cos. grocery chain.  “We own the brand in Canada so everything that’s happening
south of the border has no effect in Canada,” said Geoff
Wilson, the senior vice president of  investor relations .  A strike forced Irving, Texas-based Hostess to shutter
operations and dismiss more than 18,000 employees last week
after changing diets in the U.S. led to years of sales decline.  PepsiCo Inc. (PEP)  has its own Hostess brand in Canada, a line of
potato chips sold at discount grocers. The potato chips aren’t
affected by the U.S. filing and will continue to be
sold in Canada, said Sheri Morgan, a spokeswoman for PepsiCo by
phone from Toronto.  To contact the reporter on this story:
