SandRidge Energy Inc. (SD) , the  oil
company  that lost more than one-fourth of its market value this
year, adopted a shareholder rights plan after two of its major
owners called for a sale of the company.  Another shareholder, Prem Watsa of  Fairfax Financial
Holdings Ltd. (FFH) , increased his stake in the company and praised
its chief executive,  Tom Ward .  “We believe Tom Ward is one of the best operators in the
business and that the company he has built, SandRidge Energy, is
poised to do well in the long term,” Watsa said in an
interview.  Under the plan, stockholders will receive the right to buy
additional shares, exercisable if an outside party acquires more
than 10 percent of the company or an institutional investor
acquires 15 percent of the company, according to a statement
today.  The company also changed its bylaws to make it more
difficult to overhaul SandRidge’s board by requiring a majority
vote of its shares to fill vacancies or change the board’s
rules, according to the statement.  “Today’s actions are designed to protect the interests of
all of our stockholders,” according to the statement. “The
board and management look forward to continuing to engage in
constructive dialogue with stockholders regarding our plans for
the business.”  Sale Urged  TPG-Axon Management LP Chief Executive  Dinakar Singh  and
Jonathan Fiorello of Mount Kellett Capital Management LP have
written to SandRidge’s board, calling for SandRidge to put
itself up for sale, fire Ward and allow major shareholders to 
appoint new directors.  SandRidge’s stock price should be as much as $20 a share;
it’s been driven down by poor management and a lack of board
oversight, the investors said in their letters. Mount Kellett’s
Fiorello said the company should delay a plan to sell its
acreage in the Permian Basin until a new board is appointed.  Ward, who founded SandRidge in 2006, was paid $25.3 million
in salary, bonus, stock awards and other compensation in 2011.  Strategy  Ward has defended SandRidge’s strategy, including the
 Permian Basin (PBT)  auction. Selling the reserves will allow SandRidge
to concentrate on the Mississippian formation in Oklahoma and
 Kansas , where rates of return are higher, Ward said at an
industry conference Nov. 14.  Analysts have said the Mississippian is worth less because
it produces more natural gas than the company’s Permian fields.  Singh’s TPG-Axon owns 6.2 percent of SandRidge and Mount
Kellett owns 4.5 percent. Watsa increased his stake to 10.4
percent, according to a Nov. 16 filing.  SandRidge announced the rights plan after the close of
regular trading. SandRidge rose 5.2 percent to close at $5.62 in
 New York . The stock has fallen 31 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
