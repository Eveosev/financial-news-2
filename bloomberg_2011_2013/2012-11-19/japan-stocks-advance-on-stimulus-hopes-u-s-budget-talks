Japanese  stocks  rose, with the  Topix (TPX) 
Index capping the biggest gain in a three-day period since March
2011, as utilities jumped on speculation elections next month
will hand power to an opposition party more supportive of
nuclear power and as a weaker yen buoyed exporters.  Toyota Motor Corp. added 1.4 percent as the yen touched a
seventh-month low after a report opposition leader Shinzo Abe
said he would choose someone in favor of inflation targets as
the next central bank governor.  Shikoku Electric Power Co. (9507) 
climbed 10 percent to lead gains among utilities.  Japan Tobacco
Inc. (2914)  jumped 6.5 percent as a finance ministry official said the
government will postpone selling a stake in the company.  The Topix rose 1.4 percent to close at 762.16 in  Tokyo ,
with almost six shares advancing for each that fell. The index
has risen 5.5 percent in the three days since the ruling party
called for elections that polls suggest the opposition Liberal
Democratic Party will win. The  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  gained
1.4 percent to 9,153.20 today.  “Every yen the currency depreciates has a big impact on
earnings,” said  Masaru Hamasaki , Tokyo-based chief strategist
at Toyota Asset Management Co., which manages the equivalent of
$22 billion. “The LDP is calling for stimulus measures and they
are expected to win.”  The Topix has fallen 18 percent since the Democratic Party
of Japan took power on Sept. 16, 2009, compared with a 27
percent advance for Standard & Poor’s 500 Index. Shares on the
Japanese gauge trade at 0.9 times book value, while those on the
S&P 500 are valued at 2.1. A number below one means companies
can be bought for less than the value of their assets.  Fiscal Cliff  Futures on the S&P 500 added 0.2 percent today. The measure
added 0.5 percent on Nov. 16 after U.S. House Speaker John
Boehner said talks over the so-called fiscal cliff were
“constructive.” President  Barack Obama  told reporters in
Bangkok yesterday that he’s “confident we can get our fiscal
situation dealt with.”  The S&P 500 has lost almost 5 percent since the Nov. 6
election set up a budget showdown between Obama and the
Republican-controlled House. The gauge has dropped so far that
it would have to advance 26 percent to reach the valuation of
bull markets since John F. Kennedy was in the White House.  Abe, the former prime minister who leads the LDP, said he
will choose someone who is in favor of inflation targets as the
next BOJ Governor, Kyodo news reported Nov. 17. The central bank
should be responsible for sustaining employment like the U.S.
Federal Reserve, Abe said according to the report.  Inflation Target  Japan ’s currency fell to the lowest level in almost seven
months ahead of a Bank of Japan policy decision tomorrow. All 21
economists surveyed by Bloomberg said they expect BOJ Governor
Masaaki Shirakawa’s board to take no action at this meeting.  Exporters gained after the yen depreciated to as low as
81.59 per dollar, the weakest since April 25. Against the euro,
Japan’s currency weakened to 104.11 from 103.43 at the close of
stock trading on Nov. 16. A weaker yen boosts overseas income at
Japanese companies when repatriated.  Toyota Motor rose 1.4 percent to 3,370 yen. Nikon Corp., a
camera maker that gets about 85 percent of its sales overseas,
jumped 4.7 percent to 2,080 yen.  Utilities advanced for a third day, gaining the most today
among the Topix’s 33 industry groups. Shikoku Electric jumped 10
percent to 1,076 yen. Kansai Electric Power Co. gained 5.5
percent to 744 yen.  Utilities Surge  The Topix gauge tracking  power  companies has risen 9.8
percent in the three days after the Dec. 16 elections were
called. Polls show the LDP, which promoted Japan’s atomic
industry during most of its five decades in power, will win.  Oil companies gained after crude for January delivery rose
to as high as $87.68 a barrel in electronic trading on the  New
York  Mercantile Exchange. JX Holdings Inc., owner of Japan’s
biggest refiner, jumped 4.9 percent to 426 yen. Idemitsu Kosan
Co. climbed 3 percent to 6,960 yen.  Japan Tobacco gained the most in the Nikkei 225, rising 6.5
percent to 2,411 yen after a finance ministry official said the
government will postpone a planned sale of part of its stake in
the tobacco maker. Separately, Japan Tobacco said in a statement
that it will acquire  Egypt  waterpipe tobacco maker Al Nakhla.  To contact the reporter on this story:
