Turkey  expects to allow about 60
foreign and local banks to operate as an increasing number of
institutions apply for licenses, according to Mukim Oztekin,
head of the Banking Regulation and Supervision Agency.  “Foreign banks’ interest in the Turkish market is fast
increasing,” Oztekin said today in Istanbul. “We take
financial strength as the most important criteria.” About 49
banks are currently operating in Turkey, he said.  Italy’s largest retail bank,  Intesa Sanpaolo SpA (ISP)  applied to
Turkey’s regulator to open a branch and Bank of Tokyo-
Mitsibushi, a unit of  Japan ’s biggest lender  Mitsubishi UFJ
Financial Group Inc. (8306) , has made a formal application, he said.  “Both these banks meet our criteria.” he said.
Standard Chartered Bank is interested to open a branch or carry
out investment banking activities in Turkey, while South Korean
banks were also interested, Oztekin said, without giving names.  To contact the reporter on this story:
