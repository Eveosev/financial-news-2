Malaysia’s ringgit forwards
strengthened by the most in almost two weeks after official data
showed the country’s economic growth beat estimates.  Government
bonds  declined.  Gross domestic product  rose 5.2 percent in the third
quarter from a year earlier, more than the 4.8 percent increase
forecast in a Bloomberg News survey, according to a Nov. 16
report. Central bank governor Zeti Akhtar Aziz said at press
briefing in Kuala Lumpur that day that full-year expansion will
be a least 5 percent, compared with an earlier projection of 4
percent to 5 percent.  “The better economic data is helping to drive demand for
the ringgit,” said Azmi Shukri Rahman, a foreign-exchange
trader at CIMB Investment Bank Bhd. in Kuala Lumpur.
“Expectations of inflows into the Malaysian equity and bond
markets should also keep the currency firm in the near term.”  Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards appreciated 0.2
percent to 3.1193 per dollar as of 4:33 p.m. in  Kuala Lumpur ,
the biggest advance since Nov. 7, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The contracts to buy or sell the ringgit in a year
traded at a 1.8 percent discount to the spot rate. Non-
deliverable forwards are settled in dollars.  The ringgit rose 0.3 percent to 3.0640 per dollar, data
compiled by Bloomberg showed. One-month implied volatility, a
measure of exchange-rate swings used to price options, declined
32 basis points, or 0.32 percentage point, to 5.20 percent, the
least since April 2008.  The yield on the 3.314 percent notes maturing in October
2017 rose one basis point to 3.18 percent, according to Bursa
Malaysia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
