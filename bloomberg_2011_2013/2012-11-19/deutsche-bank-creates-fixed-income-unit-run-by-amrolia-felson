Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) , Germany’s biggest
bank, is combining its fixed-income and foreign-exchange
businesses to be overseen by Zar Amrolia and Wayne Felson.  The unit will be called fixed income and currencies and the
plan was announced in a memo to staff on Nov. 16, according to a
spokeswoman for the bank in  London .  Deutsche Bank is firing staff and reviewing businesses as
 Europe ’s sovereign-debt crisis curbs trading and rising capital
demands weigh on profitability. The fixed-income business, which
has traditionally been the bank’s biggest revenue contributor,
will be a “drag” on return-on-equity under the latest round of
capital requirements by the Basel Committee on Banking
Supervision, co-Chief Executive Officer Anshu Jain has said.  Amrolia, 49, currently heads global foreign exchange while
Felson, 41, runs rates and credit trading. Financial News
reported their appointments earlier today.  --  To contact the reporters on this story:
