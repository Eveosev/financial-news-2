Lansdowne Partners LP, the largest
Europe-based hedge fund that focuses on equities, bought shares
of  UBS AG (UBSN)  last month as it increased its holdings in the
financial services industry.  UBS Chief Executive Officer  Sergio Ermotti  has taken “the
commendable decision to focus upon its asset management and
advisory businesses,” Lansdowne said in a performance report
for its European Equity Fund, a copy of which was obtained by
Bloomberg. The position is equivalent to 5 percent of the fund’s
net asset value, the firm said in the report.  Ermotti is shrinking UBS’s investment-banking operations
and seeking to focus the lender on its wealth management unit,
the world’s second-largest, to boost returns for shareholders.
His plans include 10,000 job cuts at the Zurich-based lender.  Andrew Honnor, a Lansdowne spokesman in  London , declined to
comment by e-mail, citing the hedge fund’s policy of not
discussing individual investments.  The firm manages about $2.2
billion across all of its European funds, according to Honnor.  Two of the Lansdowne’s European Equity Fund’s five biggest
holdings are in the financial services industry: Ageas, the
majority owner of  Belgium ’s biggest life insurer, and Dutch
insurer Delta Lloyd NV.  To contact the reporter on this story:
