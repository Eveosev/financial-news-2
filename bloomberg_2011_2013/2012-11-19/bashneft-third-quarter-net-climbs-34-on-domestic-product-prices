OAO Bashneft, the oil producer
controlled by billionaire Vladimir Evtushenkov’s AFK Sistema,
said profit rose 34 percent, beating analysts’ estimates on
higher sales of domestic products.  Net income increased to $547 million in the third quarter
from $407 million a year earlier, the company said in a
statement on its website. That beat the $464 million average
 estimate  of six analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Revenue advanced
3.7 percent to $4.62 billion.  “The third quarter was our company’s most successful this
year” after increasing retail sales, Bashneft President
Alexander Korsik said in the statement.  Bashneft sold about 0.2 million metric tons from inventory
in the third quarter, driving profits, Alexander Kirevnin, an
oil analyst at VTB Capital, said today by e-mail.  Oil production gained 1 percent to 3.88 million tons in the
quarter, while refining volumes added 0.5 percent to 5.32
million tons, according to Bashneft.  Russian  oil companies  benefited as export duties lagged
behind increase in prices for crude and products in the third
quarter. OAO Rosneft,  Russia ’s largest oil producer, more than
tripled profits. TNK-BP, Russia’s third-largest producer, and
OAO Gazprom Neft also gained.  Bashneft’s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation
and amortization, a measure of profitability, advanced 34
percent to $962 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
