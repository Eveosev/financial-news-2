The cost to protect Argentine bonds
against default fell for the first time in eight days after
bondholders of restructured debt argued in support of the
government in its legal battle with holdouts.  Five-year credit default swaps fell 312 basis points to
2,797 basis points at 12:06 p.m. in  New York , according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the biggest drop on a closing
basis since June 2009. One-year swaps plunged 538 basis points
to 6,918.  A group of creditors who accepted the terms of Argentina’s
2005 and 2010 debt restructuring, including Gramercy Advisors
LLC and Massachusetts Financial Services Co., asked a New York
court to “recognize the serious harm” they face from an Oct.
26 court decision that Argentina can’t pay the so-called
exchange bondholder group, or EBG, without paying holders of
defaulted debt.  “The injunction threatens to magnify the losses of these
guiltless third-parties by making it impossible for them to
receive payments that everyone agrees are lawfully owed,” the
group said in a brief filed Nov. 16. The decision “threatens to
deprive the EBG members of their Due Process rights.”  The yields on  Argentina ’s 8.75 percent dollar bonds due in
2017 sold under New York law as part of the restructuring fell
146 basis points, or 1.46 percentage point, to 16.35 percent at
12:06 p.m., according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The bond’s
price surged 3.73 cents to 76.34 cents on the dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
