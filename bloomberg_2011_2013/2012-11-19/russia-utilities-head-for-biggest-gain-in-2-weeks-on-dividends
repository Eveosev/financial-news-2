Russian utilities  headed for the
biggest gain in two weeks after the government approved dividend
rules for state-owned companies.  MSCI Inc. (MSCI) ’s Russia Utility Index rallied 2.3 percent to
35.66 by the close in Moscow, poised for the strongest advance
since Nov. 6. OAO MRSK Holding rose 0.7 percent to 1.896 rubles.
Federal Grid Co. gained 1.5 percent, while OAO Inter RAO UES
added 1.1 percent to 2.47 kopeks. OAO RusHydro increased 1.5
percent to 73.42 kopeks.  The government approved regulations requiring state
companies to pay no less than 25 percent of their net income in
dividends, according to a website document posted Nov. 16.  “If this decree starts working, this will be very positive
for investors,” Elina Kulieva, an analyst at  Alfa Bank , said by
phone from Moscow. “Power companies’ large capital-spending
programs didn’t allow them to pay high dividends.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
