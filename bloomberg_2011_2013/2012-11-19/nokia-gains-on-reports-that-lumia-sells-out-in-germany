Nokia Oyj (NOK1V)  shares rose the most in a
month after the company said it received reports that its new
Lumia 920 smartphone had sold out in  Germany .  The shares  rose  as much as 5.5 percent to 2.23 euros, the
biggest intraday gain since Oct. 18, and traded at 2.22 euros at
11:59 a.m. Helsinki time. The Stoxx Europe 600 Index climbed 0.9
percent as shares around the world snapped the longest losing
streak in almost a year.  Nokia is working to make all models available again in
Germany after receiving reports that many shops had run out of
the Lumia 920, according to a posting on the Espoo, Finland-
based company’s  Facebook page . Nokia started selling the device,
which uses  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) ’s Windows Phone 8 operating system,
this month.  The company is relying on its Lumia line to revive sales
and challenge the iPhone and Android devices. Last month, Nokia
posted its sixth straight quarterly loss and said the last three
months of the year will be “challenging” as it brings out new
models.  To contact the reporter on this story:
