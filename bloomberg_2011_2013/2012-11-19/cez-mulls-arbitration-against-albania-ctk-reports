CEZ AS (CEZ) , the Czech Republic’s largest
power producer, is considering filing an arbitration suit
against Albania because the country’s water utilities haven’t
been paying for supplied electricity, CTK reported, citing
spokeswoman Barbora Pulpanova.  CEZ started disconnecting the utilities in Albania at the
end of last week and later reconnected them again to comply with
a Tirana court decision on Nov. 17, CTK said. The Albanian
police forced CEZ employees in various locations to renew the
power supply and took six CEZ workers into custody, later
releasing four of them, according to the report.  The Albanian energy market regulator started a process of
withdrawing the license from CEZ last week, CTK said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
