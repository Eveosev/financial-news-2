Steel reinforcement-bar futures
declined the most in two months after a report that property
prices gained in 35 Chinese cities fueled concern that the
government won’t relax curbs on the sector.  The contract for May delivery fell 2.7 percent, the biggest
decline since Sept. 20, to close at 3,544 yuan ($568) a metric
ton on the Shanghai Futures Exchange.  New home prices rose in October in more cities than the
previous month, indicating the government may refrain from
relaxing curbs on the  property market . Prices climbed in 35 of
the 70 cities the government tracks, compared with 31 in
September, according to data from the statistics bureau
yesterday. Prices fell in 17 cities.  “The property sector will continue to face pressure from
macro controls,” Wanda Futures Co. said in a report today.
Rebar steel is mostly used in construction.  The global  steel industry  may face a “double dip”
situation as reorganization “hasn’t taken place fully,”  Dae-
Woo Lee, senior economist at Posco Research Institute, said in
 Hong Kong  today. The industry’s continued expansion reduced
capacity utilization, he said.  Iron ore  with 62 percent content delivered to  China ’s
Tianjin port was unchanged at $122.80 a dry ton on Nov. 16, data
compiled by the Steel Index Ltd. show. Rebar for  immediate
delivery  fell 0.3 percent to 3,708  yuan  a ton today, according
to Beijing Antaike Information Development Co.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
