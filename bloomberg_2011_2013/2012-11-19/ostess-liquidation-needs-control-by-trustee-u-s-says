The U.S. trustee in the bankruptcy
of Hostess Brands Inc. asked a judge to take control of the
company’s liquidation away from the baker of Twinkies and Wonder
bread.  U.S. Trustee Tracy Hope Davis today urged U.S. Bankruptcy
Judge Robert D. Drain in White Plains, New York, to convert the
case to a Chapter 7 from Chapter 11, based partly on the
company’s intent to pay executive bonuses.  Hostess officials “have not demonstrated that the insider
bonuses are permissible,” Davis wrote in a court filing.  The U.S trustee, part of the U.S. Justice Department, filed
the objection before a bankruptcy court hearing today in White
Plains. Hostess, based in Irving,  Texas , said Nov. 16 it would
shut down and fire more than 18,000 workers after a strike by
its bakers’ union slowed production.  The case is In re Hostess Brands Inc., 12-22052, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York (White Plains).  To contact the reporter on this story:
