Ligand Pharmaceuticals Inc. (LGND)  rose the
most in 14 months after its drug to help people with low blood
platelet counts was approved by U.S. regulators for use in
hepatitis C patients.  Ligand  rose  14 percent to $19.07 at the close in New York,
its biggest one-day gain since August 2011. The La Jolla,
California-based company said today the  Food and Drug
Administration  approved the medicine to enable hepatitis C
patients with low blood platelet counts to take interferon
therapy.  The company had sold the rights to the drug to London-based
 GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK) , which will pay Ligand royalties. Of the 4.2
million people in the U.S. with hepatitis C, about 3.5 percent
have low blood platelet counts that disqualify them from
treatment with interferon.  “Otherwise very sick patients, who had little to no
therapeutic options, will now have an opportunity to potentially
receive treatment for hepatitis C,” John Higgins, Ligand’s
chief executive officer, said in a statement.  Interferon is given as a weekly injection for a year,
carries flu-like side effects, and cures roughly half of
patients.  The Ligand treatment wasn’t tested with new, experimental
therapies that don’t include interferon. Pharmaceutical
companies led by Gilead Sciences Inc., Abbott Laboratories and
Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. are developing pill-based hepatitis C
treatments in a bid to replace interferon therapies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
