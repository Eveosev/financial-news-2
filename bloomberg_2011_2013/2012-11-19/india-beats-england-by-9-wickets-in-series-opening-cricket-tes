India  beat England by nine wickets
in their series-opening cricket Test in Ahmedabad to take a 1-0
lead in the four-match contest.  Cheteshwar Pujara, who made an unbeaten 206 in India’s
first innings batting at No. 3, was promoted to open and hit 41
not out to help India reach the 77-run target off 15.3 overs
after lunch on the final day. England was earlier dismissed for
406 in its second innings.  “The ball was hard and it was coming nicely onto the
bat,” said Pujara, who was named man of match after making 247
runs without being dismissed. “Obviously I had a lot of
confidence after scoring a double hundred. I was quite positive
and I was sighting the ball well.”  India made 521-8 declared batting first before bowling
England out for 191 and enforcing the follow-on to try and wrap
up the victory without having to bat again. England captain
 Alastair Cook  scored 176 and Matt Prior made 91 as the touring
team took the match into a fifth day.  England started the final day on 340-5, 10 runs ahead of
the hosts, but lost Cook and Prior in the first hour.  “It was a great fightback, we were in a really tough
situation,” said Cook, playing his first match as England Test
captain since being appointed on a permanent basis. “To get it
to the last day, there’s always a glimmer of hope with five down
and it had to be something very special. Unfortunately it wasn’t
to be today but we fought hard and we can take a lot from the
second half of this game with our batting.”  The second Test in Mumbai starts Nov. 23, with matches in
Kolkata and Nagpur to follow.  England , which secured a 4-0 sweep
when the teams met in the U.K. last year, hasn’t won a Test
series in India since its 1984-85 tour.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
