OTP Bank Nyrt. (OTP) , Hungary’s largest
lender, fell the most in a month after the government said a
special bank tax will be permanent, breaking a pledge to phase
it out.  The shares dropped 2.8 percent to 4,000 forint by the end
of trade in Budapest, the biggest plunge on a closing basis
since Oct. 18.  FHB Jelzalogbank Nyrt. (FHB) , a Hungarian mortgage
lender, declined 1.1 percent to 450 forint. The benchmark BUX
stock  index , where OTP has a 30 percent  weighting  and FHB has
0.8 percent, retreated 0.4 percent.  The tax will stay “permanently,” the Economy Ministry
said late Nov. 16. The levy is part of a set of measures,
including higher duties on energy and utility companies, aimed
at keeping the budget deficit within the European Union’s limit
of 3 percent of gross domestic product.  “This latest move could force further deleveraging of
Hungary’s banking sector,” Marta Czajkowska-Baldyga, a Warsaw-
based analyst at  KBC Groep NV (KBC) , wrote in a research report today.
“We expect the news to have a negative trading impact.”  Economy Minister  Gyorgy Matolcsy  backtracked a month ago on
a promise to halve the bank levy from 2013, pledging instead to
cut it the following year at a meeting with Bavarian Finance
Minister Markus Soeder.  To contact the reporter on this story:
