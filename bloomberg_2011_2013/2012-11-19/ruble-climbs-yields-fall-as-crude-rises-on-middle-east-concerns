The ruble rose and government bond
yields fell as crude oil, Russia’s main export earner, advanced
on concern  Middle East  unrest will disrupt supplies.  The ruble added 0.2 percent to 31.6725 against the dollar
by 10:57 a.m. in Moscow after a 0.3 percent loss last week. An
index of five-year government bond yields fell five basis points
to 6.998 percent, the lowest in a month.  Israeli Prime Minister  Benjamin Netanyahu  said yesterday
that the army may “significantly widen” an assault on the  Gaza
Strip . Crude oil, which together with natural gas accounts for
about 50 percent for Russia’s government revenue, climbed 1.1
percent to $87.90 per barrel in  New York .  Non-deliverable forwards showed the ruble at 32.1474 per
dollar in three months. The currency was down 0.1 percent versus
the euro at 40.44 and was little changed against the central
bank’s euro-dollar target basket at 35.6182.  The extra yield that investors demand to own Russia’s
dollar bonds over U.S. Treasuries fell three basis points to
206, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s EMBI Global Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
