Invest AD, an Abu Dhabi-based asset
manager, said it started a Middle East and Africa bond fund
today with an initial capital of $25 million to tap high growth
economies where companies can’t easily get bank loans.  The bond fund, the first of its kind at Invest AD, will
primarily invest in U.S. dollar-denominated debt across the
region, the fund’s manager, Dilawer Farazi, said in an interview
in Abu Dhabi yesterday. Forty percent of the fund will be
earmarked for sovereign and quasi-sovereign bonds while 60
percent will be invested in corporate bonds, Farazi said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
