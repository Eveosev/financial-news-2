Even with all the concern about the
so-called fiscal cliff, another confrontation over government
borrowing limits and Chinese ownership of  U.S. debt , foreign
investors can’t get enough Treasuries.  Brazil, Belgium, Luxembourg, Russia, Switzerland, Taiwan
and Hong Kong boosted their holdings of U.S. government
securities by a collective $264.8 billion since the last debt
ceiling debate ended in August 2011, Treasury data released Nov.
16 show. The purchases more than made up for the  $123 billion
decline  in Treasuries owned by  China , America’s biggest overseas
creditor, to $1.156 trillion.  The rise in  international ownership  shows growing
confidence in the U.S. while China’s reduced stake undermines
Republican assertions that the nation has gained too much
influence. President  Barack Obama  and Congressional leaders
agreed Nov. 16 to begin talks on a long-term fiscal plan to
avert more than $600 billion in mandated spending cuts and tax
increases scheduled to big Jan. 1 that threaten the recovery.  “Despite our fiscal situation, despite all these issues,
there hasn’t been much of a buyers’ strike from the Treasury’s
perspective,” Aaron Kohli, an interest-rate strategist at BNP
Paribas in  New York , one of 21 primary dealers that trade with
the  Federal Reserve , said in a Nov. 13 telephone interview.
“One has been replaced by the other and that really does
demonstrate the depth of demand.”  Bond Yields  BNP forecasts the 10-year yield will rise to 2 percent by
June 2013, keeping it below the average of about 5 percent since
1990. The benchmark 10-year note’s yield fell 2.5 basis points
last week, or 0.025 percentage point, to 1.58 percent, according
to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The rate was 1.62 percent at
11:04 a.m. in New York.  Democratic Senate Majority Leader  Harry Reid  and Republican
Speaker of the House  John Boehner  said the first meeting between
the parties and Obama suggested progress was possible.  Treasuries have returned 2.8 percent this year and 1
percent since the election Nov. 6, according to Bank of America
Merrill Lynch bond indexes. After Obama’s re-election, the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Stock Index has declined 4.6 percent,
while the  U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) , which measures the currency against
six of America’s major trading partners, has risen 0.6 percent.  Chinese ownership of U.S. debt was an issue during the
election battle.  China Threat  “Does the America we want borrow a trillion dollars from
China? No,” Republican candidate  Mitt Romney  said Aug. 30 in
accepting the Republican presidential nomination at the party’s
convention in Tampa, Florida.  A super-political action committee, the Americans for
Prosperity Foundation, joined with the advocacy group Citizens
Against Government Waste to air television advertisements that
showed China’s ownership of Treasuries as a threat to U.S.
independence.  “America tried to spend and tax itself out of a great
recession” and saddled itself with “crushing debt,” a Chinese
professor in the future tells his students as English subtitles
appear on  the screen . “Of course we owned most of their debt,
so now they work for us.”  David Koch , who with his brother  Charles Koch  controls
Wichita-based Koch Industries Inc., is chairman of the Americans
for Prosperity Foundation. The billionaires fund groups that
advocate policies favored by the Republican party.  Message Purpose  “The message is not to be scared of what could happen with
China, the message is to look at our policies domestically and
look at the decisions we’re making and ask ourselves whether
this is a path we want to continue to go down,” Levi Russell, a
spokesman for the Americans for Prosperity Foundation said in a
Nov. 16 telephone interview.  Japan, which raised its  stake  by 6.9 percent this year to
$1.13 trillion, is on a pace to surpass China and top the list
of foreign creditors by January.  The drop in holdings by China, whose economy is the world’s
second-biggest, reflects a shifting emphasis from growth driven
by exports fueled by a cheap currency, toward more internal
consumption, according to Win Thin, the global head of emerging-
market strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman & Co. in New York  ‘Geopolitical Superpower’  China’s currency, the  yuan , has appreciated 1.9 percent in
the past year and reached 6.2252 per dollar on Nov. 14, the
strongest level since the government unified the official and
market exchange rates at the end of 1993. “It’s part of the
rebalancing of the economy,” Thin said in a Nov. 16 telephone
interview.  The combined holdings of Brazil, Switzerland, Belgium,
Russia, Taiwan and Hong Kong, which own more than $100 billion
in U.S. securities each, have increased their positions by at
least 14 percent since August 2011, Treasury data show. They
collectively own $1.23 trillion, up 28 percent.  “There’s been a lot of shifts in who’s doing what,”  Carl Lantz , head of interest-rate strategy in New York at Credit
Suisse Group AG, a primary dealer, said in a Nov. 9 telephone
interview. “The overall picture is the U.S. remains the reserve
currency, and that comes from the position as an economic and
geopolitical superpower. By default there’s no better option.”  Stimulus Spending  The dollar’s  share  of global reserves jumped to 61.9
percent as of June 30 from 60.5 percent a year earlier, the
Washington-based  International Monetary Fund  said Sept. 28. The
euro’s share fell to 25.1 percent from 26.7 percent.  Credit Suisse raised its year-end forecast for the 10-year
Treasury yield on Nov. 8 to 1.75 percent from 1.35 percent on
expectations the U.S. will avoid the fiscal cliff.  Marketable debt  in the U.S. has risen to $10.9 trillion
from $4.4 trillion at the start of the financial crisis in July
2007 as policy makers borrowed to finance two rounds of stimulus
spending and record budget deficits exceeding $1 trillion for
four straight years in order to rescue the banking system and
the automobile industry.  Total Treasury debt, which also counts securities that
aren’t tradable, such as those held in the Social Security Trust
Fund, was  $16.26 trillion  at the end of October, according to
the government. The debt ceiling of $16.39 trillion may be
reached about the end of December, the Treasury said in its Oct.
31 Quarterly Refunding Statement.  After losing 8.6 million jobs in 2008-2009, the  U.S.
economy  has since added 4.4 million positions, with the
 unemployment rate  declining to 7.9 percent in October from a
high of 10 percent in October 2009. The Reuters/University of
Michigan preliminary consumer sentiment index rose to 84.9 in
November, the highest level since July 2007.  Relative Growth  Gross domestic product in the U.S. will increase 2.2
percent in 2012, followed by gains of 2 percent next year and
2.75 percent in 2014, according to the median estimate of almost
100 analysts in a Bloomberg News survey.  That’s better than the average of 1.28 percent this year
for the Group-of-10 nations, followed by 1.3 percent growth in
2013 and 1.98 percent in 2014, separate surveys show.  The Fed and Chairman Ben S. Bernanke, after injecting $2.3
trillion into the financial system, said in September they would
buy $40 billion a month in mortgage bonds until it sees
“sustained improvement in the labor market.”  “We have a free and open economy and a Fed that’s not
afraid to act,” said Scott Colyer, who manages $9.5 billion as
chief investment officer at Advisors Asset Management in
Monument, Colorado, in a Nov. 15 interview at Bloomberg
headquarters in New York. “We have fixed, fundamentally, the
problems.”  Colyer said he stopped buying Treasuries last year on the
expectation that the next significant move in bond prices will
be down as either the economy improves or the market perceives
its debt burden as untenable.  Currency Reserves  The rise in foreign Treasury holdings comes as global
currency reserves grew 7.8 percent to  $10.79 trillion  in the
last year, Bloomberg data show. During that period, Brazil’s
reserves increased 7.2 percent to $377.8 billion,  Hong Kong ’s
expanded 7.1 percent to $301.7 billion and Taiwan’s rose 1.5
percent to $399.2 billion.  Brazil’s stake in U.S. government bonds has climbed 14
percent to $250.5 billion in the 13 months since Aug. 31, 2011,
Hong Kong’s position has ballooned by 33 percent to $135.7
billion and Taiwan’s has soared by 40 percent to $200.4 billion.  Belgium’s has grown 54 percent to $133.7, Luxembourg’s has
climbed 29 percent to $148.1 billion, and Russia’s has increased
18 percent to $162.8 billion during the same period.  The  Swiss National Bank , which bought unprecedented amounts
of foreign currencies to keep the franc from appreciating beyond
1.20 per euro since September 2011, raised its Treasury holdings
by 24 percent to $195.8 billion in the 12 months ended Sept. 30.
That represents almost half its reserves of 424.4 billion francs
($448 billion).  Storm Center  Switzerland is “surrounded by the heart of the storm”
engulfing Europe,  Jack McIntyre , a  fund manager  who oversees $33
billion in global debt at Brandywine Global Investment
Management in Philadelphia, said in a Nov. 14 telephone
interview. “They probably don’t mind having exposure away from
Europe.”  McIntyre has reduced his Treasury holdings and is buying
local-currency Brazilian debt and also “nibbling” at Italian
and Portuguese government securities, he said.  Foreign investors held 50.7 percent of the outstanding
public debt of the U.S. in September, the most in a year,
according to Treasury data released Nov. 16. Of the Treasuries
held outside of the U.S., 72.8 percent, or $3.97 trillion, are
owned by  official institutions  including central banks, finance
ministries and other fiscal agents, Treasury data show.  “As the global economy evolves you do get different
players coming in,” Larry Dyer, a U.S. interest rate strategist
with HSBC Holdings Plc in New York, a primary dealer, said in a
Nov. 15 telephone interview. “As long as the river of dollars
flowing out of the U.S. continues, odds are people are going to
buy something with it, and the first stop of any accumulation
that goes to a central bank is likely to be the Treasury
market.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
