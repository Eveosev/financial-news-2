The  Portuguese government  forecast
debt will rise to 120 percent of gross domestic product this
year, higher than predicted earlier, before peaking in 2014 at a
lower level than it previously estimated.  Debt will peak at 122.3% of GDP in 2014 after reaching
122.2% in 2013, Finance Minister Vitor Gaspar said in Lisbon
today as he announced the completion of the sixth quarterly
review of the country’s aid program. The government previously
forecast debt would reach 119.1 percent of GDP this year, 123.7
percent in 2013 and 123.6 percent in 2014. The budget deficit
targets for this year and 2013 were unchanged.  “Executing the budget in 2012 continues to be a difficult
exercise,” Gaspar said. This year’s  deficit  target “will be
met and the government is not considering resorting to
additional measures.”  Prime Minister  Pedro Passos Coelho  is battling rising
joblessness and a deepening recession as he raises taxes to meet
the terms of a 78 billion-euro ($100 billion) bailout from the
European Union and the  International Monetary Fund .  Portugal  has
already been given more time to narrow its deficit after  tax
revenue  missed forecasts and as the economy heads for a third
year of contraction in 2013.  Deficit Targets  The government aims to reach a deficit of 5 percent of
gross domestic product in 2012 instead of the previous goal of
4.5 percent, Gaspar said on Sept. 11 after EU and IMF officials
agreed on the new targets. It aims for a deficit of 4.5 percent
in 2013 rather than the prior objective of 3 percent. It will
only cut the deficit below the EU’s 3 percent limit in 2014,
when it targets a 2.5 percent gap.  The finance minister on Oct. 3 said the government plans to
implement an “enormous” increase in taxes on wages and other
income to meet budget deficit targets in 2013, when the  economy 
is set to shrink for a third year. Income tax will increase
through a 3.5 percent surcharge on 2013 income and a reduction
in the number of tax brackets to five from eight.  The government plans to revamp the country’s corporate tax
and will try to obtain savings from public-private partnership
contracts, Gaspar said today. Next year the government aims to
sell postal operator CTT-Correios de Portugal and rail freight
company CP Carga, he said. It plans to cut spending by about 4
billion euros in the two years through 2014.  Gaspar also reaffirmed forecasts for GDP to shrink 3
percent this year and 1 percent in 2013. The economy will expand
0.8 percent in 2014, he said.  Economic growth  has averaged less
than 1 percent a year for the past decade, placing Portugal
among  Europe ’s weakest performers. The  unemployment rate  is
forecast to rise to 16.4 percent in 2013 from 15.5 percent this
year.  With the conclusion of the sixth review, Portugal will
receive 2.5 billion euros from its aid package. After that
disbursement it will have received 87 percent of its bailout,
not including a 12 billion-euro recapitalization facility for
banks that’s part of the aid program, Gaspar said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
