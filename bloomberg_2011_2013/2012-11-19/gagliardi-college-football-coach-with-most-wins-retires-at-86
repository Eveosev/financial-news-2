John Gagliardi, whose 489 wins are
more than any other coach in college football history, is
retiring from Division III  Saint John’s University  in  Minnesota .  The 86-year-old Gagliardi has coached for 64 years, 60 at
the all-male school in Collegeville, Minnesota, according to the
university’s athletics web page. He retires with a record of
489-138-11, 81 more victories than former Grambling State coach
Eddie Robinson.  “Nobody ever said that getting older was easy,” Gagliardi
said on the website. “Luckily I’ve always been blessed with
great players, friends, family and support to make it this
far.”  Gagliardi doesn’t allow players to call him “coach.” His
biography on the university website details his methods, which
include no tackling in practice, no whistles, no athletic
scholarships and no practices longer than 90 minutes.  He will remain on staff until his contract expires on June
30 and a search for his successor will begin immediately, the
school said. Saint John’s, a Catholic liberal arts school with
an undergraduate enrollment of 1,900, finished the season 5-5,
its 44th consecutive non-losing campaign.  “Arguably, John Gagliardi has impacted the lives of as
many young men as any individual in the history of Saint John’s
University,” school President Michael Hemesath said on the
website. “His legacy of educating young men at Saint John’s is
one that any coach or professor would envy.”  Gagliardi was inducted into the  College Football Hall of
Fame  in 2006. He won 30 conference title and national
championships in 1963, 1965, 1976 and 2003.  Former Florida State University coach Bobby Bowden has the
most wins at college football’s top level, 377.  To contact the reporter on this story:
