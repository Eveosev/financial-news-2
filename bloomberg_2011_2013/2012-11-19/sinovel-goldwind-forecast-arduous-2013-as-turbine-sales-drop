Sinovel Wind Group Co. (601558)  and  Xinjiang
Goldwind Science & Technology Co. (002202) , China’s biggest makers of
 wind turbines , forecast a difficult 2013 after reporting a
decline in sales in the third quarter.  “China’s wind market will be a bit arduous next year as it
demands quite a process to cope with grid constraints, slowing
growth and economic environment,” Han Junliang, chairman of
Sinovel, said at a conference in Beijing on Nov. 16.  Goldwind also predicts tough market conditions as
“difficulties accelerate,” Chief Executive Officer Wu Gang
said at the China Windpower Conference the same day. The two
companies, which together account for a quarter of China’s wind
market, have posted losses in the three months ended Sept. 30.
Sinovel’s sales plunged 82 percent and Goldwind fell 42 percent.  China , the biggest market for the companies, will for the
first time post a 20 percent drop in annual installations to
16.4 gigawatts this year. It will add 16.3 gigawatts of wind
farms in 2013, Bloomberg New Energy Finance said in a Nov. 14
report.  Chinese regulators implemented a stricter approval process
for on-land projects in 2011 as grids struggled to carry
electricity generated from wind-energy installations. The nation
had 10 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity from wind farms
unused last year and the number may grow this year, said Qin
Haiyan, secretary general of the Chinese Wind Energy
Association.  “Sinovel has relied heavily on orders from large wind
bases in northern Chinese provinces, and these have been most
severely affected by grid-related delays and the tighter
permitting rules,” BNEF analysts led by Justin Wu wrote in the
report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
