Telefonica SA (TEF) , which last month sold
shares in its German unit and is considering an initial public
offering for its Latin America business, said there’s no need to
do the same in the U.K.  “I’m very focused on the local market,” Ronan Dunne,
chief executive officer of Telefonica’s O2 U.K. unit, said in an
interview with Bloomberg Television today. “There is no need to
IPO other businesses other than the Latin American business,
which they have signaled they’re looking at.”  The offering of Telefonica’s German unit was the biggest
European IPO this year. Madrid-based Telefonica,  Europe ’s most
indebted phone company, has also explored an IPO of its Latin
American business. In the past months, the Spanish operator has
also sold a stake in China Unicom (Hong Kong) Ltd. and disposed
of the Atento call-center division.  Telefonica’s O2 unit lost its No. 1 position in the British
market when  France Telecom SA (FTE)  and  Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE)  combined
their local units in 2009 to form a 50-50 joint venture, now
called EE. The business has drawn interest from private-equity
companies, France Telecom CEO Stephane Richard said last week,
adding that the companies may also consider an IPO for EE.  Telefonica rose 0.6 percent to 10.07 euros ($12.86) at 2:29
p.m. in Madrid trading. The stock had declined 25 percent this
year through Nov. 16.  To contact the reporters on this story:
