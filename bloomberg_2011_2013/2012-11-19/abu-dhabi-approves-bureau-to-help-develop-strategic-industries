Abu Dhabi, capital of the United
Arab Emirates and the holder of most of the country’s oil,
approved plans to set up an office to oversee and develop
industrial projects, an official said.  The Abu Dhabi Industrial Development Bureau will be
responsible for strategies to encourage petrochemicals, oil,
manufacturing and other “vital” industries, Mohammed Omar
Abdulla, undersecretary of Abu Dhabi Department for Economic
Development, told reporters. A law authorizing the new bureau
may be ready this year, he said.  The office will set industrial regulations, Abdulla said
today in the capital, which is also the largest of the U.A.E.’s
seven emirates.  The Persian Gulf country contains about 6 percent of the
world’s proven crude oil reserves, according to BP Plc, and
produced 2.63 million barrels a day in October, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
