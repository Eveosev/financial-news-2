Pohjolan Voima Oy,  Finland ’s second-
biggest utility, will set up two subsidiaries that will trade
power on behalf of its production units and represent the
company’s owners on the Nord Pool Spot AS exchange.  The units will start operating next month, Marko Nylund,
executive vice president of generation management, said by phone
today from Helsinki. PVO Power Management will trade within-day
and day-ahead power, while PVO Power Services will act as a
legal exchange member representative on behalf of some of the
company’s 21 owners, which include paper makers  UPM-Kymmene Oyj (UPM1V) 
and  Stora Enso Oyj (STERV) , as well as locally owned energy companies.  “As of December 1, we will stop buying and selling power
on the the Nord Pool Spot exchange in Oslo on behalf of our
shareholders,” Nylund said.  Pohjolan Voima, the main shareholder in the Olkiluoto
nuclear reactors, produced 14.47 terawatt-hours of power last
year, some 20 percent of total Finnish output. Its current
trading unit, PVO-Pool Oy, will cease power trading and instead
provide staffing and information technology services to the two
new entities, Nylund said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
