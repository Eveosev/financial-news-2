Det Norske Oljeselskap ASA (DETNOR)  outgoing
Chief Executive Officer Erik Haugane said the shares will double
by 2015 as reserve estimates are set for the Johan Sverdup
oilfield and the company becomes a full-fledged producer.  The 59-year-old, who will next year step down as CEO of the
company he founded in 2001, said he will remain a shareholder
through his  investment company , Koerven AS, which holds 724,414
shares. That represents 0.57 percent of the Trondheim-based
company, which is valued at 10.3 billion kroner ($1.8 billion).  “A good deal of the market has short-term investment
horizons,” he said in an interview. “I’m at least going to
make sure I’m sitting with quite a few shares since I know the
upturn is coming.”  The stock has already more than tripled since the company
announced the first find on its side of what is now known as the
Johan Sverdrup field, which may hold 3.3 billion barrels of oil
equivalent.  Statoil ASA (STL) , which owns 40 percent of both blocks
that contain the field, has said new reserve estimates will be
released early next year, while a development plan is due in
2014 and an output start in 2018.  Det Norske is transforming itself from an exploration
company into an oil producer as pumping is scheduled from fields
such as Jette in March next year and Ivar Aasen in 2016. Ivar
Aasen, of which Det Norske holds 35 percent, could yield 25,000
barrels of oil a day at its peak in 2018, compared to the
company’s output of about 800 barrels of oil equivalent a day in
the third quarter, according to its  website .  Short Term  By 2014, when the Sverdrup plan is released and Aasen is
two years away from production, it will be “sufficiently short-
term for the markets to start to react,” he said.  Swedbank First Securities analyst Teodor Sveen Nilsen, who
has a buy recommendation and a target price of 130 kroner,
estimated the company’s production will grow to as much as
26,000 barrels a day in 2017 and more than 80,000 barrels a day
in 2021.  The  shares  have dropped from a record close of 98.5 kroner
on Sept. 14 to 81.25 kroner as of the 4:30 p.m. close in Oslo.  Det Norske said in October that Haugane would leave after a
mutual agreement.  Aker ASA (AKER) , the biggest owner with 49.99 percent
of the shares, said the company needed to improve operationally
and strengthen its team in order to become a full oil producer.  Det Norske took a 1.9 billion write-down on the North Sea
Jette project in the third quarter after technical problems with
a production well. Chairman Svein Aaser said in an interview
that organizational changes could in hindsight have been made
before the development of the field started.  Haugane said his stepping down had nothing to do with Jette
since the departure had been agreed on before the difficulties.
He said he would now seek to sit on boards at Norwegian
companies and would be unlikely to seek an executive post at a
rival company. Det Norske will also likely be his only
investment, he said.  “I’m not an investor type,” he said. “It’s not very
exciting.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
