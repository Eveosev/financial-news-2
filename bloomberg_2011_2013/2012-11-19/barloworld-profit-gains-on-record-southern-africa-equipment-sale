Barloworld Ltd. (BAW) , a seller of
equipment to mines and construction companies, said record sales
to mines in southern  Africa  boosted fiscal full-year profit.  Net income rose 53 percent to 1.6 billion rand ($181
million) in the 12 months through September from a year earlier,
the Johannesburg-based company said in a statement. Sales
increased 18 percent to 58.6 billion rand and earnings per share
climbed 53 percent to 7.35 rand, beating the median  estimate  of
6.74 rand by eight analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  “We expect a slowing of mining-unit sales due to a global
slowing of mining capital expenditure,” Chief Executive Officer
Clive Thomson said by phone from Johannesburg. Spending on
infrastructure, especially in Angola and  Russia , will counter
the lower sales to mines, he said.  Barloworld, which also has operations in Russia and  Spain ,
said on Oct. 1 that global industry sales of new mining
equipment will probably drop 25 percent after reaching a record
this year. The worst labor unrest at  South Africa ’s mines since
the end of apartheid has led to stoppages at gold, platinum,
coal and iron-ore mines.  Increased uncertainty in the global and local economy has
led to some deferment in mining capital expenditure, the company
said.  The  stock  rose 2.6 percent to 75.01 rand, the highest since
Sept. 21, by the close in Johannesburg. More than 804,780
shares, or 90 percent of the daily average over the last three
months, changed hands.  To contact the reporter on this story:
