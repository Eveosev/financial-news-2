Egypt  has dropped Ukraine from its
approved list of wheat suppliers, with an exception for some
traders, said Nomani Nomani, the vice chairman of the state-run
 General Authority  for Supply Commodities.  “I didn’t completely close the door to Ukrainian wheat
imports,” Nomani said today by telephone from Cairo. “Traders
due to ship Kazakh wheat from Ukrainian ports, for example,
still have the option to ship Ukrainian wheat instead. But they
have to take responsibility for that.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
