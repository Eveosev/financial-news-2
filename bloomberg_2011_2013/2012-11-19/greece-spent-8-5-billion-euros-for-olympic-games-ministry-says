Greece spent 8.5 billion euros
($10.9 billion), less than previously reported, to host the
 Olympic Games  in 2004, the year its  budget deficit  jumped,
according to a faxed statement by the  finance ministry  today.  The games, the most expensive ever, cost Greece about 10
billion euros, Greece’s former finance minister George
Alogoskoufis had said Oct. 2005.  The country’s budget gap reached 7.5 percent of gross
domestic product in 2004, boosted by costs for the event. Greece
narrowed its budget deficit from more than 15 percent of GDP in
2009 -- five times the European Union limit -- to 9.4 percent in
2011. The spending gap is due to shrink to below 7 percent of
GDP this year and to almost 5 percent in 2013.  To contact the reporters on this story:
