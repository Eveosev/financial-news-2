Natural gas futures dropped in New
York for the second time in three days on forecasts for warmer-
than-normal weather that would cut heating-fuel consumption.  Gas dropped 1.9 percent after MDA Weather Services in
Gaithersburg,  Maryland , said temperatures may be above normal
across most of the contiguous U.S. states through Nov. 23, with
normal weather the following week. Heating demand in the U.S.
may be 35 percent lower than usual on Nov. 22, data from Weather
Derivatives in Belton,  Missouri , show.  “We’re probably going to get warmer weather down the road,
and that’s keeping a lid on prices,” said Dominick Chirichella,
senior partner at the Energy Management Institute in New York.
“Futures are still holding up pretty well at these levels,
though.”  Natural gas for December delivery fell 7.1 cents to settle
at $3.719 per million British thermal units on the New York
Mercantile Exchange. The futures are up 12 percent from a year
ago. Prices advanced to $3.835 per million Btu in electronic
trading, the highest intraday price since Nov. 4, 2011.  December $4 calls were the most active gas options in
electronic trading. They were 1.3 cents lower at 1.2 cents on
volume of 652 contracts as of 2:43 p.m. Calls accounted for 60
percent of options volume.  Prices have failed to settle above the 62 percent Fibonacci
retracement level of $3.806,  Stephen Schork , president of Schork
Group Inc. in Villanova, Pennsylvania, said in a note to clients
today. Fibonacci analysis is based on the theory that prices
tend to drop or climb by certain percentages after reaching a
high or low.  Hedge Funds  Gas has climbed 25 percent since Sept. 26 on speculation
that colder weather will increase heater use.  Hedge funds sold natural gas to utilities last week as
colder-than-normal weather bolstered heating demand and pushed
prices to the highest level in more than a year.  Money managers reduced net-long positions, or  wagers  on
rising prices, by 6.4 percent in the week ended Nov. 13,
according to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s
Commitments of Traders report Nov. 16. Commercial users
including power generators increased buying by 11 percent.  Citigroup Inc. raised its forecast for 2013 natural gas
prices by 6 percent to $3.55 per million Btu, citing lower-than-
expected stockpiles as power plants switched to gas from coal,
according to a report from the bank.  The low in New York on Nov. 22 may be 45 degrees Fahrenheit
(7 Celsius), 5 above normal, according to  AccuWeather Inc.  in
State College,  Pennsylvania . The low in  Chicago  may be 39
degrees, 7 more than the usual reading.  Weather Outlook  About 50 percent of U.S. households use gas for heating,
according to the Energy Department.  A lack of Pacific Ocean warming and of blocking patterns in
the Atlantic will probably mean warmer-than-normal weather in
the eastern U.S. for the next three months, Todd Crawford, chief
meteorologist at WSI, said in an Oct. 22 seasonal forecast.  Temperatures in the East may be about 2 degrees Fahrenheit
(1 Celsius) above normal from November through January, while
the Northwest cools, Crawford said.  Gas inventories were 5.6 percent above the five-year
average in the week ended Nov. 9, according to the Energy
Department. The  surplus  was down from a six-year high of 61
percent in March. Supplies fell 18 billion cubic feet last week
to 3.911 trillion, the earliest seasonal decline since 2007.  Marketed gas production will average a record 68.84 billion
cubic feet a day this year, up 4 percent from 2011, the Energy
Department said Nov. 6 in its Short-Term Energy Outlook. The
department’s forecast for gas consumption fell to 69.75 billion
cubic feet a day from 69.76 billion predicted last month.  Gas Drilling  The number of rigs drilling for gas in the U.S. rose by
four to 417 in the week ended Nov. 16, according to data from
Baker Hughes Inc. in Houston. The rig count is down 48 percent
this year.  “EIA expects that growth in associated gas from crude oil,
as well as continued drilling in liquids-rich areas, will help
offset the decline in drilling activity,” the Energy
Department’s Energy Information Administration said in the
monthly outlook.  The boom in oil and natural gas production helped the U.S.
cut its reliance on imported fuel. America met 83 percent of its
energy needs in the first six months of the year, department
data show. If the trend goes on through 2012, it will be the
highest level of self-sufficiency since 1991.  Gas futures volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was
220,389 as of 2:49 p.m., compared with the three-month average
of 367,000. Volume was 309,232 on Nov. 16. Open interest was
1.16 million contracts. The three-month average is 1.14 million.  The exchange has a one-business-day delay in reporting full
volume and open interest data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
