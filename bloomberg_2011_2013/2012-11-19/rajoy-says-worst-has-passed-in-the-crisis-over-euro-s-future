Spanish Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy 
said the “worst has passed” in the crisis of confidence over
the euro’s future, even as the nation continues to fight for
lower borrowing costs.  “There are doubts about the irreversibility of the euro,
it’s true that there were more a few months ago than today,”
Rajoy told reporters today at a news conference in Madrid with
Brazilian President  Dilma Rousseff . “I’m totally and absolutely
convinced that the worst has passed.”  Rajoy, who says he is still deciding whether to seek a
bailout that would allow the  European Central Bank  to buy the
nation’s debt, said Spain’s biggest problem is the cost of
financing. Ten-year benchmark bond yields rose to 5.88 percent
today, almost four months after Rajoy first said he may consider
asking for help to reduce the cost of financing the euro area’s
second-largest budget gap.  “The most important problem in  Spain  isn’t cutting the
deficit, which we have to do, the most important problem is
having financing for the whole economy at reasonable prices,”
Rajoy said. That’s why the government is fighting for greater
political and economic integration in the euro region, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
