Tsogo Sun Holdings Ltd. (TSH) , a South
African casino operator, said first-half profit rose on higher
takings from both its hotels and gaming divisions as gamblers
shrugged off slowing economic growth.  Net income increased 34 percent to 743 million rand ($84
million) in the six months through September from a year
earlier, the Johannesburg-based company said today in a
statement. Revenue advanced 10 percent to 4.8 billion rand.  “We target middle-market consumers in  South Africa ,”
Chief Executive Officer Marcel von Aulock said by phone from
Johannesburg. They are experiencing economic stress, but aren’t
as affected by unemployment as less well-off consumers, he said.  Consumer spending  in Africa’s biggest economy is under
pressure amid unemployment of 25.5 percent and economic growth
that will slow to 2.5 percent this year, the lowest since the
2009 recession, according to central bank and government
estimates. The  Reserve Bank  cut  interest rates  to a 30-year low
of 5 percent on July 19 to support economic growth.  Tsogo’s shares  rose  3.2 percent to 24.72 rand in
Johannesburg by 10:57 a.m., paring four trading days of losses.
About 7,500 shares changed hands, or 4 percent of the daily
average over the last three months.  Tsogo, which has more than 90 hotels in Africa, said that
while the trading performance in the first half was
“encouraging,” its outlook is uncertain due to inconsistent
monthly results in the period. September trading levels were
particularly strong, it said.  The company raised its half-year dividend by 20 percent to
24 cents per share. The shares have risen 50 percent this year,
compared with a 16 percent increase in the FTSE/JSE  Africa  All
Share Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
