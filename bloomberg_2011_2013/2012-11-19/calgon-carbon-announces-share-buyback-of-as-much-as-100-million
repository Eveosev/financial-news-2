Calgon Carbon Corp. (CCC) , a water-
purification and ultraviolet technology solutions provider for
municipalities and industries, announced a share buyback plan
for as much as $100 million of stock.  Board approval of the repurchase program demonstrates its
support “as well as its confidence in the company’s
opportunities for long-term growth from  emerging markets  such as
disinfection byproducts, mercury removal from flue gas and
ballast water treatment,” Calgon Carbon Chief Executive Officer
Randy Dearth said in a statement.  The program represents about 14 percent of the Pittburgh-
based company’s market value. The shares rose 3 percent on the
news, trimming losses this year to 22 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
