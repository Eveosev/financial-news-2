Fiat Industrial SpA (FI)  raised its offer
for the remaining stake in  CNH Global NV (CNH)  that doesn’t already
own after the American company spurned an earlier bid.  Fiat Industrial offered to pay CNH investors a special
dividend of $10 per share, the Turin-based company said today.
Fiat Industrial owners will receive one share in the merged
entity for each share they own, while CNH stockholders would get
3.828 shares for each share.  CNH last month rejected Fiat Industrial’s proposal to
combine the two companies in a share exchange with no premium
for CNH investors as “inadequate.” Fiat Industrial, which
already owns 88 percent of CNH, gave the American company two
days to decide whether to accept “this best and final offer.”  Fiat Industrial Chairman  Sergio Marchionne , who’s targeting
more than 25 billion euros ($32 billion) in sales for Fiat
Industrial this year, is seeking to create the world’s third-
largest capital-goods company in the combination. The merged
entity would have a product range spanning Iveco delivery
trucks, New Holland harvesters and FPT ship engines.  CNH  gained  as much as 7.3 percent to $47.69, the highest
since Jan. 31, and was up 4.1 percent as of 9:54 a.m. in  New
York  trading. Fiat Industrial was 1.2 percent in Milan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
