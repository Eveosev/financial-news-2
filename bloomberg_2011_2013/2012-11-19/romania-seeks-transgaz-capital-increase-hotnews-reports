Romania is seeking to change the
procedure for a minority stake sale in  Transgaz SA (TGN)  and opt for a
capital increase instead of a secondary share sale, hotnews.ro
reported, citing Economy Minister Daniel Chitoiu.  The eastern European country, which has pledged to the
International Monetary Fund to sell 15 percent of Transgaz by
the end of this year, reconsidered the sale because of market
conditions and the company’s funding needs, Chitoiu told the
news website in an interview.  The funds from the capital increase will be used by
Transgaz for investments in the country’s natural-gas grid and
for other projects, such as Nabucco gas pipeline, Chitoiu told
 hotnews , adding that a listing will be at a “fair” price.  To contact the reporter on this story:
