Bluewaters Communications Holdings
LLC sued Formula One chief Bernard Ecclestone and CVC Capital
Partners Ltd. over the sale of a stake in F1 for $650 million,
saying it was the “high bidder” for the racing company, which
it values at $10 billion.  The financial firm, in a Nov. 16 filing in  New York  State
Supreme Court, alleged that the deal went to CVC as a result of
a $44 million bribe paid by Ecclestone to steer the stake to
CVC, which kept him on as head of F1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
