Portugal’s economic recovery program
is “broadly on track, despite stronger headwinds” to growth,
the  International Monetary Fund , the  European Central Bank  and
the European Union said today in a joint statement.  The nation’s economy is expected to contract 1 percent next
year and then expand by 0.8 percent in 2014, the three
organizations, often referred to as the “troika,” said after a
week-long review of the program.  The troika also said that Portugal “should gradually
return to positive quarterly growth rates”  next year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
