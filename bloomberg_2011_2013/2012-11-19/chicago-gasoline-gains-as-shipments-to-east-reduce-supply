Gasoline gained for a second day in
 Chicago  as distributors sent fuel to the U.S. East Coast in the
wake of  Hurricane Sandy , drawing down Midwest supplies already
hovering at the lowest level in more than 20 years.  Requests to ship fuel along  Buckeye Partners LP (BPL) ’s Line
415/521, which transports products from the Midwest and delivers
to areas including Pittsburgh, exceeded maximum capacity last
week, the company said Nov. 16. The boost in nominations may
continue to strain supplies that fell 1.07 million barrels to
44.5 million in the Padd 2 region last week, the  lowest  since
the Energy Department started publishing weekly data in 1990.  Conventional gasoline for ethanol blending, or CBOB,
advanced 8.5 cents to trade at a premium of 2 cents a gallon
over futures on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 2:42 p.m.
Gasoline in the Midcontinent, or Group 3 market, gained 0.25
cent to trade at a discount of 12.13 cents a gallon.  The largest crude unit at BP Plc’s  Whiting refinery  in
 Indiana  remains shut for maintenance and is also contributing to
the advance, according to Steve Mosby of ADMO Energy LLC.  “Things have been so tight in the East, they’re sending
gasoline to the East Coast,” Mosby, vice president of ADM, a
supply consultant in  Kansas City ,  Missouri , said in a telephone
interview. “You’re still seeing the effects of Sandy and there
are also still some issues at BP Whiting. Those are the two
things holding it together.”  BP Maintenance  BP shut the Whiting refinery’s largest crude unit, known as
Pipestill 12, on Nov. 5 for a planned maintenance turnaround,
according to a person familiar with the situation. The crude
unit has a capacity of 235,000 barrels a day, the person said.  Stockpiles of the motor fuel on the U.S. East Coast dropped
1.54 million barrels to 45.1 million last week, according to the
Energy Department. Supplies are constrained as Phillips 66’s
238,000-barrel-a-day  Bayway refinery  remains offline for
repairs. Operations are expected to return by the end of the
month, the company said Nov. 5.  Reformulated gasoline in the  New York  Harbor declined by
7.5 cents to trade at a premium of 9.50 cents a gallon over
futures at 3:54 p.m. local time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
