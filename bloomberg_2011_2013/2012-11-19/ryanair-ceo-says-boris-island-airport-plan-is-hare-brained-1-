Ryanair Holdings Plc (RYA)  Chief Executive
Michael O’Leary told U.K. lawmakers that  London  Mayor Boris Johnson’s plans for a new airport serving southeast  England  are
“insane, stupid, hare-brained” and called for the expansion of
current sites. Johnson said that would be “a disastrous policy.”  A U.K. government move to hold an inquiry into airport
capacity in the southeast is also putting off decisions that
urgently need to be taken, O’Leary told Parliament’s Transport
Committee, adding that London’s Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted
airports all need at least one new runway.  “It’s just another issue of the U.K. kicking the aviation
can further down the road,” O’Leary said.  Construction of a new hub in the Thames estuary, dubbed
“Boris Island” by the U.K. media, would add capacity away from
heavily inhabited areas, minimizing the impact of aircraft
noise, according to Johnson. The mayor said today on Bloomberg
Television that Heathrow would need at least two more runways to
compete with Amsterdam, Paris, Madrid and  Frankfurt .  “To expand it is simply environmentally catastrophic for
much of west London, but also inadequate,” Johnson said in an
interview. “Stop thinking about locating our No. 1 hub airport
in the west London suburbs and go for an alternative location.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
