Olympic skiing champion  Lindsey Vonn 
returned to training yesterday for the first time since being
hospitalized with severe intestinal pain.  The U.S. Ski and Snowboard Association said on its  website 
that Vonn, a 28-year-old American, participated in a giant
slalom training session near her home in Vail, Colorado.  Vonn, who was hospitalized for three days last week,
decided to return to gate training after a brief free-skiing
session the day before, the association said.  “She hasn’t lost any of her skills, her skiing was right
there,” U.S. women’s technical head coach Roland Pfeifer said
in a statement on the website. “Obviously she has a lack of
energy, but now it’s a matter of how fast she’s able to recharge
her battery.”  Pfeifer said it was too early to tell whether Vonn will be
able to compete in two World Cup races on Nov. 24-25 in Aspen,
 Colorado .  “We are day by day right now,” he said. “She is in a
very good mood and she is so happy to be back.”  Vonn won a gold medal in the downhill and a bronze in the
super-giant slalom at the 2010 Vancouver Winter Olympics. She’s
a four-time World Cup overall champion and has been the downhill
champion each year since 2008 and the super-G champion each year
since 2009.  A 12-year member of the U.S. ski team, Vonn is also a high-
profile endorser, working with brands including car company  Audi
AG (NSU) , watchmaker Rolex Group, sporting goods company  Under Armor
Inc. (UA) , energy drink maker Red Bull GmbH and  Vail Resorts Inc. (MTN)   To contact the reporter on this story:
