The “super cycle” of commodity
prices gains  has ended as  China’s economy  shifts to slower
growth and supplies increase, according to  Citigroup Inc. (C)   Prices won’t move “sharply” higher even as stimulus
measures from global central banks lift growth and demand
rebounds by the end of 2013, analysts led by New York-based
Edward L. Morse, the bank’s global head of commodities research,
said today in an e-mailed report. Returns will be more
“differentiated” among raw materials depending on supply-
demand balances, Citigroup said.  “It is now clear that the commodity super cycle is over,”
Morse said. “No longer will a pure long-only strategy bring the
returns expected in 2002 to 2008. Nor will conditions
approximating those of the last decade return any time soon.”  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot Index of 24 raw materials,
which has increased almost fourfold since 2001, is up less than
1 percent this year as growth slowed in economies including
 China , the world’s biggest consumer of cotton, soybeans and
copper. In week ended Nov. 13, money managers lowered  bets  on a
commodity rally for a sixth straight week, the longest slump
since the depths of the global recession four years ago,
