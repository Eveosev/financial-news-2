Honda Motor Co. (7267) ’s U.S. rebound will
continue through 2012’s final months, helping the carmaker boost
deliveries about 25 percent this year even after  Hurricane Sandy 
reduced October gains, said U.S. sales chief  John Mendel .  The company expects to deliver almost 1.46 million Honda
and Acura brand vehicles this year in the U.S., up from 1.15
million a year ago, Mendel said in an interview on Nov. 16.
Honda’s sales rose only 8.8 percent last month, compared with
the 16 percent average gain of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.
Honda is the No. 2 Japanese automaker by U.S. sales.  “November will be a pretty good month for us -- I see
nothing different in November and December that will change the
course of where we’ve been this year,” Mendel said. Honda brand
sales for the year should be “within 10,000 or 12,000 units”
of 1.3 million, with the Acura luxury brand at “160,000, maybe
a little bit more,” he said.  Demand for the Tokyo-based carmaker’s cars and trucks in
the U.S., its biggest market, has been aided by a redesign of
the CR-V crossover, restyled Accord sedan and record production
at North American plants that were slowed last year by parts
shortages stemming from natural disasters in  Asia . Honda is
counting on a modified version of the Civic, currently the top-
selling U.S. small car, that goes on sale late this month to
keep growth going into 2013.  The company’s shares slid 0.1 percent to 2,599 yen as of
9:52 a.m. in Tokyo trading today. The benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock
Average added 0.2 percent.  Honda’s sales grew 22 percent to 1.17 million through
October. Besides the Civic increase, CR-V is the top-selling
sport-utility vehicle so far this year, and Acura recorded a 28
percent sales gain in the first 10 months.  Sandy Recovery  Sandy, the largest Atlantic storm in U.S. history, hit the
Northeast on Oct. 29, bringing floods and cutting power to
millions of customers in  New York  and  New Jersey . As many as
200,000 new and used vehicles may eventually be replaced in the
region as a result of the storm, the National Automobile Dealers
Association estimated this month.  Industrywide sales in October fell short of the average
estimate of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg after Sandy slammed
the East Coast during the industry’s busiest time of the month.
Total U.S. light-vehicle deliveries rose 6.9 percent, below the
12 percent gain that was the average of nine estimates.  Carmarkers have said they expect to make up sales lost in
October and replace thousands of new vehicles damaged by the
storm.  “New York metro area lost a bunch of cars, but we’ve
reallocated a bunch that were in transit,” Mendel said. “We’re
doing everything we can to get those dealers up and running as
quickly as possible, because it’s not just about the dealers,
it’s customers. People there need cars.”  Honda’s U.S. headquarters are in Torrance,  California .  To contact the reporter on this story:
