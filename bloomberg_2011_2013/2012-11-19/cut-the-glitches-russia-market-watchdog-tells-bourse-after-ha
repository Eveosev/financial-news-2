The Moscow Exchange must put an end
to frequent trading stoppages that are hurting  Russia ’s goal of
becoming a global financial hub, the country’s market service
chief said.  “The frequency of the trading halts doesn’t add positive
sentiment to our financial market and the exchange needs to do
everything to cut the number of glitches,”  Dmitry Pankin  told a
conference in Moscow today. “Their frequency has been high of
late.”  The Moscow Exchange halted  currency trading  for more than
2-1/2 hours because of a software error on Nov. 14. The day
after Russia’s RTS Index merged with the Micex in December 2011,
the exchange shut down equity futures trading because of a
technical problem. In April it stopped trading on its main
market, citing problems with the way deals are displayed.  The exchange has a new reserve office and has updated
software to allow the bourse to switch trading to a backup
platform during a shutdown, Alexander Afanasiev, Chief Executive
Officer at the exchange, said at the same conference today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
