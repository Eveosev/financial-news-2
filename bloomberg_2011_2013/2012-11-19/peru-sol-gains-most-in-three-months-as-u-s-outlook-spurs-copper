Peru ’s sol rose the most in three
months as copper rallied on prospects the U.S. budget crisis
will be resolved.  The currency appreciated 0.4 percent to 2.5980 per U.S.
dollar in trading today, the most on a closing basis since July
26, according to Deutsche Bank AG’s local unit. The central bank
said it bought $20 million in the spot market today, paying an
average 2.5980 soles per dollar.  Copper, Peru’s top export, climbed the most in nine weeks
as optimism that U.S. officials may reach a deal to prevent $607
billion of automatic tax increases and spending cuts from taking
effect in January boosted the outlook for global growth and
demand for the metal. House Speaker John Boehner and White House
Press Secretary Jay Carney both described a Nov. 16 meeting with
President  Barack Obama  as constructive.  The yield on Peru’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-denominated
bond due in August 2020 was little changed at 4.25 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The price rose 0.03
centimo to 123.26 centimos per sol.  To contact the reporter on this story:
