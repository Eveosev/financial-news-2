A gauge of U.S. corporate credit
risk fell as President  Barack Obama  expressed confidence he will
reach a budget agreement with Congress.  The Markit CDX North America Investment Grade Index, a
credit-default swaps benchmark that investors use to hedge
against losses or to speculate on creditworthiness, dropped 3.3
basis points to a mid-price of 105.9 basis points at 8:26 a.m.
in New York, according to prices compiled by Bloomberg.  A compromise by lawmakers on a deal to avert the so-called
fiscal cliff may lessen investor concern that an economic
slowdown will hinder companies’ ability to repay debt. The
president met with senior Democrats and Republicans on Nov. 16
for talks to avoid $607 billion in spending cuts and tax
increases set to take effect next year.  “I am confident we can get our fiscal situation dealt
with,” Obama said yesterday at a news conference in Bangkok.  The credit-swaps index typically falls as investor
confidence improves and rises as it deteriorates. The contracts
pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails to meet its
obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A basis point
equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10 million of
debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
