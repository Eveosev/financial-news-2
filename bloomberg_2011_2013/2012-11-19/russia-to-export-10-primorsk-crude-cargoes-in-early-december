Russia , the worldâ€™s largest energy
exporter, plans to export 10 cargoes of Urals crude in the first
five days of December from the Primorsk port, one more than a
month earlier, a partial loading program obtained by  Bloomberg
News  showed.  Primorsk, on the Baltic Sea, will load a total of 1 million
metric tons from Nov. 30 to Dec. 5, the program showed.  Russia will export 380,000 tons of Urals from Novorossiysk
on the  Black Sea  from Nov. 30 to Dec. 4, comprising one lot of
140,000 tons and three 80,000 ton consignments, according to the
plan. The port loaded 520,000 tons the same period a month
earlier.  The Ust-Luga port on the  Baltic Sea  will export three
cargoes of 100,000 tons each from Dec. 1 to Dec. 5, one less
than this month, the schedule showed.  The shipping plan for the whole of December will be
released later this month. Loading programs are schedules of
crude shipments compiled by field operators to allow buyers and
sellers to plan their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
