The  Dominican Republic  should lower
public debt to 35 percent of gross domestic product from 44
percent forecast for this year, the  International Monetary Fund 
said.  Economic performance and policy implementation have
deteriorated in the past two years in the Caribbean nation, the
IMF said in a statement today. The economy will probably grow
less than 4 percent this year after expanding 7.8 percent in
2010 and 4.5 percent last year, according to the statement,
which followed a Nov. 5-16 visit to the country by IMF staff.  Dominican banks are “well capitalized” and recent changes
to boost  tax revenue  are a positive development, the fund said.  “Macroeconomic policies should be geared towards reducing
fiscal and external vulnerabilities,” the IMF said. That would
require a stronger fiscal position and “a tighter monetary
stance that is consistent with strengthening the international
reserves position.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
