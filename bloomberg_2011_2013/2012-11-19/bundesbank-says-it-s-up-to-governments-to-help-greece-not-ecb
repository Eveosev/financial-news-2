Germany’s Bundesbank said any
further aid for  Greece  has to come from governments and the
 European Central Bank  can’t be involved.  “It is clearly the responsibility of fiscal policy makers
to decide on further help for Greece, as well as to provide the
financing and assume the risks involved,” the Frankfurt-based
Bundesbank said in its monthly bulletin published today. “This
is not the responsibility of monetary policy.”  The Bundesbank also reiterated its opposition to the ECB’s
new bond-purchase plan, saying it is important to maintain a
strict separation between fiscal and monetary policy “to avoid
the impression of monetary policy being co-opted by fiscal
policy interests.”  “The Bundesbank still remains critical of Eurosystem
government-bond purchases and the stability risks these may
entail, in particular if they are used to resolve government
financial difficulties through monetary policy,” it said.  The central bank said the German economy may continue to
weaken due to the uncertainty caused by  Europe ’s sovereign debt
crisis.  “The economy is currently influenced by a streaky overall
picture that is likely to continue to darken by the end of the
year,” it said. “The uncertainties stemming from the
sovereign-debt crisis are as much a concern as the mixed
economic signals from other regions of the world.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
