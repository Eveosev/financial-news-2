China ’s money-market rate advanced,
after touching the lowest level since June, on speculation the
central bank will opt to keep lending rates stable.  The People’s Bank of China gauged demand for sales of
seven-, 14- and 28-day reverse-repurchase contracts this week,
together with 28- and 91-day repurchase agreements, according to
a trader at a primary dealer required to bid at the auctions.
The PBOC pulled a net 75 billion  yuan  ($12 billion) out of the
financial system in the seven days through Nov. 15, the second
weekly withdrawal, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “People just don’t see much downside in the seven-day repo
rate,” said Weisheng He, a Citigroup Inc. strategist in
 Shanghai . Authorities “will keep the seven-day reverse repo
rate stable,” he said.  The  seven-day repurchase rate , a gauge of interbank funding
availability, rose 30 basis points to 3.21 percent as of 10:39
a.m. in Shanghai, according to a weighted average compiled by
the National Interbank Funding Center. It touched 2.3 percent
earlier, the lowest since June 8.  China’s new home prices rose in October in more cities than
the previous month, indicating the government will refrain from
relaxing curbs on the property market. Prices climbed in 35 of
the 70 cities the government tracks, compared with 31 in
September, according to data from the statistics bureau
yesterday. The cost of new homes fell in 17 cities.  The one-year interest-rate swap, the fixed cost to receive
the seven-day repo rate, was unchanged at 3.22 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The yield on 3.39
percent government bonds due August 2022 fell two basis points,
or 0.02 percentage point, to 3.49 percent, according to data
from the Interbank Funding Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
