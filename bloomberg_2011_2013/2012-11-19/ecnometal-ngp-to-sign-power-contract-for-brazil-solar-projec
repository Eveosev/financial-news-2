Tecnometal Equipamentos Ltda.,
 Brazil â€™s only photovoltaic panel maker, and the U.S. developer
 New Generation Power  expect to complete a contract this week to
sell energy from solar project to the municipality of Itajobi.  The electricity will be sold for less than the rates the
local government pays for public lighting, which may cost as
much as 400 reais ($193) a megawatt-hour, Carlos Evangelista,
business manager for Tecnometal, said today in a telephone
interview. He expects to sign the 20-year contract Nov. 22 with
the city in Sao Paulo state.  The 1-megawatt project, which will cost 7 million reais, is
scheduled to be complete in the second half of next year and may
be expanded to 3 megawatts in 2014, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
