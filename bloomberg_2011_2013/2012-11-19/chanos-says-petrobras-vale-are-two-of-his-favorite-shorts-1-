Jim Chanos, who oversees $6 billion
at Kynikos Associates Ltd., said he’s betting against Brazil’s
 Petroleo Brazileiro SA (VALE5)  and  Vale SA (VALE3) , adding that investors buying
the stocks risk subsidizing failed government policies.  “Increasingly, these state and capitalist marriages end up
giving capitalists the short end of the stick,” the hedge-fund
manager said at the Ira Sohn Investment Conference in London
today. While Brazil is “resource-rich,” its state-backed
companies are overvalued, Chanos added.  Petroleo Brasileiro’s annual expenses are eating up its
cash, Chanos said. Investors betting that the company’s shares
will rise are assuming that future oil exploration will boost
returns while production is actually declining, he said.  Vale, the world’s biggest iron-ore producer, is reliant on
exports to China, Chanos said. With growth in the Asian nation
slowing, Vale’s prospects are worsening, he said.  “This is a company expanding into a glut that is about to
fall,” he told the conference.  To contact the reporter on this story:
