Aabar Investments PJSC agreed to
sell its stake in Mercedes-Benz’s Formula One racing team to the
luxury-car brand’s parent  Daimler AG (DAI)  as the Abu Dhabi investor
further cuts ties to the automaker.  Aabar will sell its holding in Mercedes Grand Prix Ltd. to
Daimler UK Ltd. for an undisclosed sum, Aabar’s parent
International Petroleum Investment Co. said today in a
statement. The deal is conditional on approval from German and
Italian antitrust authorities.  The Abu Dhabi sovereign-wealth fund unloaded its remaining
voting stake in Daimler in October. Aabar had bought a 9 percent
stake in the Stuttgart, Germany-based manufacturer in March 2009
after financial markets collapsed. As part of that partnership,
Aabar acquired 40 percent of the Mercedes Formula One team.  Daimler last month scrapped a Mercedes profit target for
the second time, citing the effects of the  European debt crisis .
The world’s third-largest luxury-car brand this year has fallen
further behind Bayerische Motoren Werke AG and  Volkswagen AG (VOW) ’s
Audi.  To contact the reporter on this story:
