West Ham missed the chance to move
up to fifth place in English soccer’s Premier League after a 1-1
home draw against  Stoke City .  Jonathan Walters  put the visiting team ahead at Upton Park
in  London  last night when he swept in Glenn Whelan’s 13th-minute
corner kick. Joey O’Brien tied it three minutes after halftime
to extend Stoke’s winless league run on the road to 16 games.  “It is a great result after going 1-0 down and these lads,
they make it tough for you,” West Ham captain  Kevin Nolan  said
in a televised interview. “We were a bit gutted because we
wanted to get the win to go to fifth.”  The result allows both teams to keep their positions in the
20-team standings. West Ham remains in seventh place, though
moves level on Arsenal with 19 points after 12 matches. Stoke’s
seventh draw this season keeps it in 14th-place.  After O’Brien pulled West Ham level with his first Premier
League goal, Modibo Maiga and Gary O’Neil both went close for
the home team, and Winston Reid put his stoppage-time header too
close to Stoke goalkeeper Asmir Begovic.  “We could have finished them off with more clinical
finishing,” said West Ham manager  Sam Allardyce . “Everyone in
the second half raised their game, took Stoke to the wire, and I
think everyone would say we deserved the three points.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
