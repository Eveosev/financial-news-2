Winter-grain conditions in Ukraine
are “fairly good” this year after most areas received
beneficial rain in October, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s
 Foreign Agricultural Service  said.  Dry weather in September and early October allowed for
“rapid” planting of the 2013-14 winter-grain crop, though the
dryness hampered emergence and crop establishment in some
regions, the FAS wrote in an online  report  dated Nov. 15.  Southeastern Ukraine remained dry in the past two months
and started to improve by early November, according to the FAS.
Crimea remains unfavorably dry, the service wrote. Drought at
the end of 2011 destroyed about 30 percent of winter grains in
the 2012-13 season, according to the unit.  “Despite the localized dryness in the southeast, overall
conditions for Ukraine’s winter grains are fairly good, and
certainly much better than at this time last year,” the USDA
service wrote.  Farmers in Ukraine had planted 6.6 million hectares (16.3
million acres) of winter wheat as of Nov. 6, compared with 6.5
million hectares a year earlier, the FAS wrote, citing data from
Ukraine’s agriculture ministry. Winter wheat accounts for 95
percent of Ukraine’s production of the grain, it said.  Winter barley was sown on 1.07 million hectares, with
planting about 90 percent completed, according to the report. At
the same time last year, 1.04 million hectares had been planted
of a final sown area of 1.37 million hectares, the FAS wrote.
Winter barley typically accounts for about 25 percent of
Ukraine’s barley area, the unit said.  Planting of winter rapeseed was completed by the end of
September, and the area has been reported as 8.94 million
hectares, down from 9.36 million hectares, according to the
report. Winter rapeseed accounts for 90 percent of total output.  To contact the reporter on this story:
