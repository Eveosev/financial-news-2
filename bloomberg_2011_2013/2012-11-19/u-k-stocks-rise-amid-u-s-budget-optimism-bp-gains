U.K. stocks  advanced the most in
more than five months on optimism the U.S. will avoid a fiscal
deadlock after President  Barack Obama  said he is confident of
winning Congress support for a deal.  BP Plc advanced the most this month after a report that
 Europe ’s second-largest oil company plans a share buyback.  HSBC
Holdings Plc (HSBA)  gained 3.8 percent after saying it held talks to
sell its stake in Ping An Insurance (Group) Co.  The FTSE 100 Index climbed 132.07 points, or 2.4 percent,
to 5,737.66 at the close in London, the biggest gain since June
6. The gauge has  rallied 9.1 percent from this year’s low  on
June 1 as the European Central Bank announced an unlimited bond-
buying plan and the Federal Reserve started a third round of
quantitative easing. The broader FTSE All-Share Index rose 2.2
percent today, while Ireland’s ISEQ Index added 1.2 percent.  “A bounce in risk assets, following days of declines, is
the first glimmer of life we’ve seen in equities for quite a few
sessions,” said Simon Denham, managing director of Capital
Spreads in  London . “The promise from U.S. politicians that they
will work through the Thanksgiving holidays to cut a deal seems
to be giving bulls a reason to dip their toes back in.”  Obama said at a press conference in Bangkok yesterday that
he is “confident” of striking a deal with Congress to avoid
the fiscal cliff, or $607 billion of automatic spending cuts and
tax increases scheduled to occur at the start of 2013. He is on
a three-nation tour in Asia.  Budget Talks  Before the trip, Obama began a new round of deficit-cut
talks with senior Republicans and Democrats. His Treasury
Secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, said Nov. 16 that the two
parties must strike a deal soon as the lack of agreement is a
“huge cloud of uncertainty hanging over the economy.”  Republicans are also signaling willingness to compromise.
House Speaker John Boehner said after the U.K. markets closed on
Nov. 16 that he held constructive budget talks with Obama and
would accept increased government revenue and spending cuts.  Sales of previously owned houses  in the U.S. rose 2.1
percent to a 4.79 million at an annual rate in October, from a
revised 4.69 million a month earlier, the National Association
of Realtors said in a report today. That exceeded the average of
4.74 million annual pace estimated by economists in a Bloomberg
survey.  BP (BP/)  gained 3.6 percent to 431.6 pence, the biggest increase
since Oct. 30. The company will spend as much as 3.7 billion
pounds ($5.9 billion) on a share buyback early next year, the
Sunday Times reported, without citing anyone.  HSBC, Barclays  HSBC rallied 3.8 percent to 618.3 pence after Europe’s
biggest lender by market value said in a statement that it’s in
talks to sell its $9 billion stake in Ping An Insurance,  China ’s
second-largest insurer.  A  gauge  of banking shares rose the most since Aug. 3.
 Barclays Plc (BARC)  climbed 6.6 percent to 249.75 pence after Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. raised its recommendation on the shares to buy
from neutral.  Ocado Group Plc (OCDO)  jumped 24 percent to 75 pence, the biggest
rally since Jan. 12, after saying it will raise 35.8 million
pounds by selling 55.9 million new shares at 64 pence each to
existing investors. The U.K. online grocer said in a statement
its lenders have agreed to extend the maturity of a capital
expenditure facility by 18 months to July 6, 2015.  Lamprell Plc (LAM)  rallied 17 percent to 81.25 pence after
Liberum Capital wrote in a note that the company’s share price
does not reflect the underlying value of its business. The oil-
rig engineer has “competitive advantages” in many of its
markets, Liberum wrote. The shares have plunged 70 percent so
far this year.  Lamprell declined as much as 10 percent earlier today after
it increased its estimate for 2012 loss to $105 million.  Associated British Foods Plc (ABF)  advanced 2.9 percent to 1,434
pence after Societe Generale SA wrote in a note profits at the
company’s Primark unit may grow to 1.3 billion pounds in 2022
from 356 million pounds in the year ended Sept. 15. SocGen
upgraded the shares to buy from hold.  To contact the reporter on this story:
