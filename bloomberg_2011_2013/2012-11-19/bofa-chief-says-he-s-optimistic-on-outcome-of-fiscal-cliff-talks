Bank of America Corp.  Chief
Executive Officer  Brian T. Moynihan  said he’s encouraged by the
tone of discussions in Washington designed to avert the so-
called fiscal cliff.  “I’m more optimistic by everything I’ve read,” Moynihan
said today in London during a Bloomberg Television interview.
Lawmakers are taking the matter “very seriously,” he said.  Moynihan, 53, told investors this month that businesses
have delayed capital spending until the outcome of the fiscal
cliff negotiations in Washington becomes clear. The term refers
to a package of tax increases and spending cuts that begin
taking effect in January unless Congress comes up with a new
budget plan.  Bank of America shares gained 70 percent this year as of 11
a.m. in New York, the best showing in the Dow Jones Industrial
Average. The bank ranks second by assets in the U.S. and is
based in Charlotte,  North Carolina .  To contact the reporters on this story:
