The French water company  Veolia
Environnement , whose shares have slumped 11 percent this year
amid a restructuring, named Francois Bertreau as chief operating
officer to oversee cost-cutting efforts.  Bertreau, 57, who begins Dec. 1, will “be in charge of
putting in place the company’s new organizational structure,”
the Paris-based utility said today in a statement.  Chief Executive Officer Antoine Frerot is cutting debt
and scaling back global operations to boost profits. The company
plans to sell 5 billion euros ($6.4 billion) of assets and cut
investments this year and next. It has said it will also reduce
operating costs by 270 million euros in 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
