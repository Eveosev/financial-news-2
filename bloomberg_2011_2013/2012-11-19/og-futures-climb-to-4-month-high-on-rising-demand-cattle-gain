Hog futures rose to a four-month
high on signs of a rebound in demand for U.S. pork and tighter
supply. Cattle prices advanced.  Wholesale  pork  rose on Nov. 16 for the first time in six
sessions, after dropping to a six-week low a day earlier,
according to the  U.S. Department of Agriculture . Meat plants
slaughtered 1.6 percent fewer hogs last week than the previous
week, while carcass weights in the  Iowa  and southern Minnesota
region fell 0.7 percent from a year earlier to 272.6 pounds
(123.7 kilograms) in the week ended Nov. 10, USDA data show.  “There is strong wholesale hog value,” Jason Roose, an
analyst at U.S. Commodities Inc. in  West Des Moines , Iowa, said
in a telephone interview. “Even though the hurricane in the
East Coast had weakened demand, we’re still seeing packers look
for meat to put in cold storage.”  Hog futures for February settlement climbed 1.1 percent to
close at 87.425 cents a pound at 1 p.m. on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange, after reaching 87.875 cents, the highest
for a most-active contract since July 9.  Cattle futures for February delivery gained 0.1 percent to
$1.3015 a pound on the CME, rising for the third straight
session. Feeder-cattle futures for January settlement increased
0.3 percent to $1.46 a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
