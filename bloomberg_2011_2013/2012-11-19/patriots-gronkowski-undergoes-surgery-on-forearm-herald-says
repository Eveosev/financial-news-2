Rob Gronkowski  of the  New England
Patriots  underwent surgery this morning to repair a broken left
forearm, the Boston Herald reported, citing an unidentified
person.  Gronkowski, the only tight end in National Football League
history to have at least 10 touchdown catches in three straight
seasons, will miss 4-6 weeks, NFL.com reported last night. It’s
not known if the timetable has changed following surgery, the
newspaper said.  The 6-foot-6, 265-pound All-Pro tight end left yesterday’s
59-24 win against the Indianapolis Colts in the fourth quarter.
He had seven receptions for 137 yards and two touchdowns before
the injury.  Gronkowski, 23, has 31 touchdown catches in his past 30
regular-season games for the Patriots. He has 53 catches for 748
yards and 10 scores this season for New England, which has won
four straight games to improve to 7-3.  The Patriots, who next visit the New York Jets on Nov. 22,
have also been without tight end  Aaron Hernandez  since Week 7
because of an ankle injury.  To contact the reporter on this story:
