European stocks will fall further
after breaching a level that held since European Central Bank
President Mario Draghi unveiled an unlimited bond-buying
program, according to a technical analyst at Commerzbank AG.  Draghi announced on Sept. 6 a plan to purchase debt in an
attempt to regain control of interest rates in the euro area.
The Stoxx Europe 600 Index closed at 265.49 on Sept. 5. The
gauge slid below that level for the first time on Nov. 16. It
had rallied as high as 276.18 on Oct. 18.  “We fell below the September level, which in my point of
view is a signal that the consolidation which began back in
September is going to expand both in time and in space and the
next really good support is in the area of the 200-day moving
average, 260 to 261,” Petra Grafin Von Kerssenbrock, a
technical analyst at Commerzbank, said in a telephone interview.  The Stoxx 600 has dropped 4.3 percent since the re-election
of President  Barack Obama  on Nov. 6 as traders turned their
focus to the so-called fiscal cliff that will trigger $607
billion of tax increases and spending cuts next year, sending
the U.S. into recession, if Congress doesn’t reach a compromise.  The index dropped 1 percent to 262.86 at the close of
trading on Nov. 16, for a 2.7 percent weekly decline, the
biggest since June.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study price
graphs to predict changes in a security, commodity, currency or
index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
