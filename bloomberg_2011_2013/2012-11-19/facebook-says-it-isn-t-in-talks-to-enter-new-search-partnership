Facebook Inc. (FB) , owner of the world’s
largest social network, said it isn’t in talks to form a new
search partnership and is working on improving its own search
capabilities.  “People expect a better search experience on Facebook,”
the Menlo Park, California-based company said in an e-mailed
statement today. “We are working on improvements to better meet
those expectations but are not in talks to enter into a new
search partnership.”  The comments came in response to a story in the Sunday
Telegraph that said Facebook was in talks about forging an
alliance with  Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO) , the biggest U.S. Web portal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
