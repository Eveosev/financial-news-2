President  Francois Hollande  said
some European Union countries have not shown enough “solidarity,”
as he pledged to fight for structural and agricultural funds in
the 27-nation bloc’s budget to be debated this week at a summit
in Brussels.  “Some countries, that I won’t name, only come to cash in
their checks, their rebate and their discounts because their
idea of  Europe  is to get back exactly what they’ve spent,”
Hollande said in a speech in Paris today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
