Tower Semiconductor Ltd. (TSEM) , the maker
of customized chips which has two foundries in Israel, surged
the most in two months in New York on speculation a cease-fire
in the Gaza Strip will hold.  Migdal Haemek, Israel-based Tower climbed the most since
Sept. 4, jumping 9.3 percent to $8.10 at the close of trading in
New York. Shares have fallen 14 percent this year. Tower shares
traded in  Tel Aviv  gained 1.7 percent to 31.41 shekels, or the
equivalent of $8.01. Tower’s 30-day historic  volatility , a
measure of stock swings, rose to a five-week high in the U.S.  Egypt  and Turkey are working to help end fighting that has
killed 96 Palestinians and three Israelis as the escalating
conflict threatens the region. Tower, which owns foundries in
the U.S. and Japan, will also benefit from a global recovery in
personal computers and television sales, according to Chardan
Capital Markets LLC.  “A cease-fire is a very big deal for Tower because they
have so much production capacity in Israel,”  Jay Srivatsa , the
managing director of equity research at Chardan,  said by phone
from New York. “If the market starts to pick up again,
foundries such as Tower start to see activity long before PC
retailers or handset retailers.”  The  Standard & Poor’s 500 (SPX)  Index rose the most in two months
on better-than-expected U.S. housing data and President Barack Obama’s expression of confidence in budget talk. The S&P gained
2 percent to 1,386.89.  To contact the reporter on this story:
