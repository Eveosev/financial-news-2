German 10-year bonds fell for the
first time in three days amid speculation European Union finance
ministers meeting tomorrow will agree to keep bailout funds
flowing to  Greece , damping demand for safer assets.  Bunds dropped along with Treasuries and U.K. gilts amid
optimism U.S. lawmakers will reach a deal to avoid the so-called
fiscal cliff of tax increases and spending cuts. Greece’s 10-
year bonds rose for a seventh day after EU finance chiefs last
week gave the nation an extra two years to reach budget-deficit
goals, even as the EU and International Monetary Fund disagreed
over extending the deadline. Spanish notes fell before the
nation sells 4.5 billion euros ($5.8 billion) of bills tomorrow.  “Bunds are slightly under pressure, which is most likely
due to expectations on Greece building up,” said  Michael Leister , a fixed-income strategist at Commerzbank AG in  London .
The market will welcome “signals that the IMF and EU are to
compromise,” he said.  German 10-year yields rose two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 1.36 percent at 4:47 p.m. London time. The
rate dropped to 1.31 percent on Nov. 13, matching the lowest
since Aug. 31. The 1.5 percent bond maturing in September 2022
fell 0.22, or 2.20 euros per 1,000-euro face amount, to 101.32.  Two-year notes yielded minus 0.022 percent. A negative
yield means investors who hold the security until it matures
will receive less than they paid to buy it.  EU Meeting  The meeting of the ministers from the 17-member euro area
in Brussels underscores skirmishing among EU officials
confronting rising unemployment and a slowing economy as they
struggle with the three-year-old sovereign-debt crisis.  IMF Managing Director  Christine Lagarde  took issue with
European governments’ decision last week to push back Greece’s
debt-reduction target by two years to 2022 against the fund’s
recommendations, raising questions over whether the IMF would
keep financing the nation.  The yield on Greece’s 2 percent security due in February
2023 dropped 27 basis points to 17.20 percent, leaving the price
at 32.61 percent of face value. The run of price gains is the
longest since the period ending Oct. 9.  In addition to tomorrow’s bill sale,  Spain  is scheduled to
auction a combined 3.5 billion euros of bonds maturing in 2015,
2017 and 2021 on Nov. 22.  Spanish Yields  Spain’s  two-year  rate climbed eight basis points to 3.33
percent, after rising to 3.35 percent, the highest level since
Oct. 11.  That left the  yield difference , or spread, between the
securities and the nation’s 10-year bonds five basis points
narrower at 254 basis points, after reaching 249 basis points,
the least since Oct. 30.  Spain’s 10-year yield was two basis points higher at 5.90
percent, while the rate on similar-maturity Italian bonds rose
three basis points to 4.90 percent.  The  Portuguese government  will hold a press conference
about the results of the sixth review of the country’s financial
aid program today at 6:30 p.m. in Lisbon, the  Finance Ministry 
said in an e-mail.  Volatility on Portuguese bonds was the highest in euro-
region markets today, followed by those of  Germany , according to
measures of 10-year or equivalent-maturity debt, the spread
between two- and 10-year securities, and credit default swaps.  The yield on Portuguese 10-year bonds dropped 32 basis
points to 8.47 percent, after falling to 8.46 percent, the
lowest since Nov. 5.  German bonds returned 4 percent this year through Nov. 16,
according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. Spanish securities
gained 2.2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
