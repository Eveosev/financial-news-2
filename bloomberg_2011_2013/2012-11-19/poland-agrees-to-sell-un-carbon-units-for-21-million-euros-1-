Poland agreed to sell UN-sanctioned
Assigned Amount Units to two World Bank carbon funds for 21
million euros ($27 million).  The sale, for an unspecified number of AAUs, is to the
World Bank’s Spanish Carbon Fund and Carbon Fund for  Europe ,
according to a statement on the Polish  Environment Ministry ’s
 website .  Poland has signed 10 deals worth 109 million euros to sell
surplus AAUs, the ministry said. The country has agreed sales
with  Japan , Ireland, Spain and the World Bank, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. AAUs are allocated to 38 developed
countries under the Kyoto Protocol and represent each nation’s
cap on greenhouse-gas emissions. Each country must surrender
AAUs corresponding to their verified discharges each year
between 2008 and 2012. Surplus AAUs may be sold to countries
with shortfalls of the permits.  Magdalena Sikorska, a spokeswoman for the Polish
Environment Ministry, declined to comment on the number of
permits sold.  To contact the reporter on this story:
