FuelCell Energy Inc. (FCEL) , the Danbury,
Connecticut-based maker of fuel-cell power plants, agreed to
build a system at a  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)  data center in Wyoming that
will run on gas generated from wastewater.  The 200-kilowatt plant will be installed next year at the
Dry Creek Water Reclamation Facility in Cheyenne, according to a
statement today. FuelCell’s systems use a chemical reaction to
produce electricity from natural gas, methane or biogas that’s
emitted from wastewater treatment plants.  Building a data center alongside the water plant makes a
fuel cell a good fit because they generate “continuous baseload
power right where the biogas is generated,” Chief Executive
Officer Chip Bottone said in the statement.  Electricity that’s not used by the server farm will be
given to the water facility. The project may be partially funded
by a $1.5 million grant on which the Wyoming Business Council
will vote Dec. 6.  To contact the reporter on this story:
