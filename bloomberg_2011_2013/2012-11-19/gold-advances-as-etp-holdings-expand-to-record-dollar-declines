Gold futures rose the most in a
week, tracking gains in commodities, as prospects improved for a
U.S. budget deal and unrest in the  Middle East  spurred demand
for the metal as an alternative investment.  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot Index of 24 commodities
rose to a four-week high, and the MSCI All-Country World Index
of equities advanced for the first time since Nov. 6 amid
optimism that U.S. lawmakers will reach an accord to avert
automatic spending cuts and tax increases scheduled to start
2013. Israel said its army was ready to invade the  Gaza Strip .  “People are in a ‘risk-on’ mode as they expect  Washington 
to come up with a solution” on the so-called fiscal cliff,  Adam Klopfenstein , a senior market strategist at Archer Financial
Services Inc. in Chicago, said in a telephone interview. “The
situation in the Middle East is also putting some bid under
gold.”  Gold futures for December delivery rose 1.1 percent to
settle at $1,734.40 an ounce at 1:56 p.m. on the Comex in  New
York , the biggest gain for a most-active contract since Nov. 6.
The price has advanced 11 percent this year.  Holdings in gold-backed  exchange-traded products  rose 4
metric tons to a record 2,603.7 tons on Nov. 16, data compiled
by Bloomberg show. Assets and prices gained this year as central
banks from the U.S. to Asia took steps to bolster economies.  Silver futures for December delivery climbed 2.5 percent to
$33.189 an ounce on the Comex, the biggest jump since Nov. 6.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , platinum futures for
January delivery rose 1.4 percent to $1,583.80 an ounce, the
biggest increase since Oct. 31.  Palladium futures for December delivery surged 3 percent to
$645.30 an ounce, the highest settlement in a month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
