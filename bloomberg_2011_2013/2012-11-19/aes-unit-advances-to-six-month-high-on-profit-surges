AES Gener SA (AESGENER) ,  Chile ’s second-largest
power producer, rose to the highest in six months after
reporting a 20-fold increase in third-quarter profit, beating
some analyst estimates.  The unit of Arlington, Virginia-based  AES Corp. (AES)  gained 1.9
percent to 299.19 pesos at the close in Santiago, the highest
price since May 8.  Net income climbed to $37.4 million from $1.78 million a
year earlier, the Santiago-based company said in a Nov. 16
statement. Sales jumped 17 percent to $565 million while
earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, or
Ebitda, rose to $183 million from $155 million.  “We remain buyers of AES Gener,” Banchile-Citi analysts
including Andrew McCarthy and Marcelo Britto wrote in a note to
clients. “The results manifested strong growth in Ebitda.”  Sales and Ebitda beat  Banco Santander SA (SAN) ’s estimates by
more than 10 percent. Santander forecast a $1 million net loss,
analysts including Adolfo Ortuzar wrote in a note to clients.  AES Gener has returned 19 percent over the past year,
including dividends, making the stock the best performer among
global peers tracked by Bloomberg. The shares fetch 11.3 times
enterprise value over Ebitda, the data show. Banchile-Citi, the
joint research department of Citigroup Inc. and Banco de Chile,
said it trades at a 13 percent discount to its replacement cost.  To contact the reporter on this story:
