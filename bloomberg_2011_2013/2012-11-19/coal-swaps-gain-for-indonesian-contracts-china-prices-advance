Swaps prices rose for a third day
for thermal coal from  Indonesia , the world’s largest exporter of
the fuel, according to Ginga Petroleum Singapore Pte.  The swap for Indonesian sub-bituminous coal with a
calorific value of 4,900 kilocalories a kilogram in the first
quarter of 2013 rose 40 cents to $62.75 a metric ton on a net-
as-received basis on Nov. 16, Ginga said in an e-mail today. The
December contract gained 25 cents to $61 a ton.  Contracts for coal with a heating value of 5,500
kilocalories a kilogram for shipment to South  China  in the first
quarter of next year climbed 10 cents to $84.50 a ton on a net-
as-received basis, the energy broker said. The swap for December
added 5 cents to $84.05 a ton.  The spot price for coal of 5,500 kilocalories per kilogram
at the port of Qinhuangdao, China’s largest for delivering the
fuel, was unchanged at 630  yuan  ($101) to 645 yuan a ton as of
yesterday compared with a week earlier, data from China Coal
Transport and Distribution Association showed today. Stockpiles
at the port rose to 6.46 million tons.  A commodity swap is a financial agreement whereby a
floating price is exchanged for a fixed rate over a specified
contract period.  About 60 percent of Indonesia’s coal is classified as sub-
bituminous. Higher moisture levels and a lower carbon content
reduce the heating value compared with better-quality stock.
Sub-bit coal has kilocalories of less than 6,100 per kilogram,
according to the Indonesian energy ministry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
