Michael Schoen has left his position
as  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) ’s head of debt capital markets for
 Latin America , according to a person familiar with the matter
who asked not to be identified because he isn’t authorized to
comment publicly.  Credit Suisse press officer Victoria Harmon declined to
comment in a phone interview. Calls to Schoen’s office were
answered by a Credit Suisse worker who declined to identify
herself.  Schoen moved from JPMorgan Chase & Co. to Donaldson Lufkin
& Jenrette Inc. in 2000. The investment bank was acquired by
Credit Suisse in November of that year.  The Zurich-based bank is the 11th biggest underwriter of
Latin American international debt sales in 2012, dropping four
positions from a year earlier, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Schoen’s departure was reported earlier by Latin Finance.  To contact the reporter on this story:
