Manila Water Co. (MWC)  shares closed at a
7 1/2-year high after the company and  Metro Pacific (MPI)  Water
Investments Corp., which has a stake in Maynilad Water Services
Inc., formed a partnership for a water venture in Cebu.  The Cebu bulk water supply project, a public-private
partnership project, will provide 35 million liters (9.23
million gallons) a day of water. Manila Water supplies water to
half of the Philippine capital while Metro Pacific’s operations
range from real estate to sanitation services.  The water utility’s shares advanced 3 percent to 32.15
pesos, the highest close since the stock started trading March
2005. The stock has surged by 66 percent this year. Earlier this
year, the  Manila Water  consortium signed a joint venture with
Cebu’s government to develop the first long-term bulk water
supply project in the province.  To contact the reporter on this story:
