Domestic sugar sales in  Brazil , the
worldâ€™s largest producer, were 1.1 percent more profitable than
exports in the week ended Nov. 16, depressing prices, according
to University of Sao Paulo research group Cepea.  Local prices for crystal sugar, which accounts for 68
percent of all sweetener sold within Brazil, slid 1 percent in
the week ended Nov. 16 to 50.60 reais ($24.33) a 50-kilogram
(110 pounds) bag, from 51.12 reais the previous week, according
to the report.  Making crystal sugar from cane was 29 percent more
profitable than producing anhydrous ethanol, the type blended
into gasoline, and 36 percent more advantageous than hydrous
ethanol, used in flex-fuel cars, Cepea said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
