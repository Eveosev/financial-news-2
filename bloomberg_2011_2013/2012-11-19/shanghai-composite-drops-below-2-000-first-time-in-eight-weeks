Most  Chinese stocks  rose, as the
 Shanghai  Composite Index rebounded from a drop below the 2,000
level. Brokerages and cement producers advanced.  Citic Securities led gains for brokerages after the
Shanghai Securities News reported that the  China  Securities
Regulatory Commission lowered benchmarks for calculating capital
requirements.  Kweichow Moutai Co. (600519) , the biggest maker of baijiu
liquor, slid the most since March on speculation inventories are
increasing, hurting the outlook for prices. Ping An Insurance
(Group) Co. dropped to the lowest level since January after HSBC
Holdings Plc said it’s in talks to sell all of its Hong Kong-
traded shares in the Chinese insurance company.  About two stocks gained for every one that declined in the
Shanghai Composite, which fell 0.1 percent to 2,012.90 as of
2:51 p.m. local time. It slumped to as low as 1,995.72 earlier
today. The CSI 300 Index slid for a third day, losing 0.2
percent to 2,173.20.  The Shanghai gauge, the benchmark index for equities traded
mostly by local investors, has declined 8.4 percent this year
amid concern China’s new leadership may slow efforts to reduce
the government’s grip on the economy, which expanded at the
slowest pace in more than three years last quarter. The index is
valued at 11 times reported  earnings , according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  “The stock index breached 2,000 because there’s no
concrete policy measure for the economy and liquidity is getting
tighter as we approach the end of the year,” said Wei Wei, an
analyst at West China Securities Co. in Shanghai. “If you can,
get out of the market and don’t enter for the rest of year.
There are still risks and stocks will continue declining below
2,000.”  The  Shanghai Composite (SHCOMP)  last breached 2,000 for less than
two minutes during  intraday  trading on Sept. 26. It rallied 4.1
percent the following two days, the biggest gain among world
equity indexes, on speculation the government would take steps
to boost stocks.  China completed the most important phase of a once-a-decade
power transition last week, with Xi Jinping succeeding Hu Jintao
as head of the ruling Communist Party.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
