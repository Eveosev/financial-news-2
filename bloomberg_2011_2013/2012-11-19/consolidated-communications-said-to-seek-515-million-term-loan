Consolidated Communications Holdings
Inc. (CNSL)  is seeking a $515 million term loan to refinance its non-
extended term loan B, according to a person with knowledge of
the transaction.  The six-year debt will pay interest at 3.75 percentage
points to 4 percentage points more than the London interbank
offered rate, said the person, who asked not to be identified
because the information is private. Libor, a rate banks say they
can borrow in dollars from each other, will have a 1.25 percent
floor.  Consolidated Communications is proposing to sell the loan
at 99 cents on the dollar, the person said, reducing proceeds
for the company and boosting the yield to investors.  Lenders are being offered one-year soft-call protection of
101 cents, meaning the company would have to pay 1 cent more
than face value to refinance the debt during the first year, the
person said.  Wells Fargo & Co . is arranging the financing for the
Mattoon, Illinois-based communications provider, according to
the person.  The company’s non-extended  term loan  due in 2014 pays
interest at 2.5 percentage points more than Libor and was quoted
at 99.375 cent today, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Laura ZuHone, a spokeswoman for Consolidated
Communications, didn’t immediately respond to an e-mail seeking
comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
