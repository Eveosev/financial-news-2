Tata Global Beverages Ltd. (TGBL) ,
 Starbucks Corp. (SBUX) ’s Indian partner, declined the most in more than
eight months in  Mumbai  trading after Morgan Stanley  downgraded 
its recommendation on the stock.  The company’s  shares  fell 5.3 percent to 164.15 rupees at
the close in Mumbai, the most since Feb. 27. The stock has
climbed 82 percent this year, compared with the 19 percent gain
in the benchmark Sensitive Index.  The rating on the stock was cut to underweight, the
equivalent of a sell, from equalweight at Morgan Stanley on
concern there will be limited gains from its venture with
Starbucks and Tata Global suffers from poor earnings
“visibility,” a lack of pricing power and slow pace of revenue
growth, Morgan Stanley analysts Nillai Shah, Girish Achhipalia
and Sanath Sudarsan wrote in a note to investors today.  “To that extent the recent stock move seems exaggerated,”
Shah, Achhipalia and Sudarsan said. “Save for cyclical
improvement in the international coffee business, we fail to see
any structural change in growth, profitability, market construct
or return ratios for the company.”  Tata Global got about 70 percent of its revenue, including
that of units, from  outside   India  in the year ended March 31,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Tea accounted for 72
percent of its total sales, while coffee contributed 27 percent,
the  data  shows.  Starbucks announced an equal joint venture with Tata Global
earlier this year and opened its first store in the country in
Mumbai last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
