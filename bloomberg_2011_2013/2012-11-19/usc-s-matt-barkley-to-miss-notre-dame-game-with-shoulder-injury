quarterback Matt Barkley will sit out the Trojans’ Nov. 24
regular-season finale against top-ranked Notre Dame because of a
sprained throwing shoulder.  Barkley, 22, was injured during the fourth quarter of USC’s
38-28 loss to UCLA two days ago. USC coach  Lane Kiffin  told
reporters yesterday that Max Wittek would start when the Trojans
host Notre Dame, which needs a win to earn a spot in college
football’s Bowl Championship Series title game.  Barkley was regarded as a top-10 pick in the 2012 National
Football League draft before returning to school for his senior
season to pursue a national championship. While Barkley has
thrown 36 touchdown passes -- three short of his school-record
39 last year -- the Trojans have a 7-4 record.  “I feel very bad for him and his family,” Kiffin said
last night on a media teleconference. “This is not the way
anybody pictured the team’s season or his season going.”  Barkley has made 24 straight starts since missing USC’s
previous home game against  Notre Dame  in 2010 because of an
ankle injury. The Trojans lost 20-16, their only defeat against
the Irish in the past 10 years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
