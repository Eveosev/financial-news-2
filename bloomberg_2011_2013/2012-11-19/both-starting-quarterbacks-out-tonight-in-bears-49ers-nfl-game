Both teams will be missing their
starting quarterback because of a concussion tonight when the
San Francisco 49ers host the Chicago Bears in a National
Football League game.  The 49ers said in an e-mail today that Alex Smith “has
been declared out for this evening’s game after being evaluated
by team medical director Dr. Dan Garza.”  Smith, 28, was knocked out of a Nov. 11 game against the
St. Louis Rams. Colin Kaepernick will start in his place against
the Bears.  Chicago’s Jay Cutler, 29, was injured the same day in the
Bears’ game against the Houston Texans. Jason Campbell will
start in Cutler’s place.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
