Groupon Inc. (GRPN)   shares rose as much as
15 percent after Tiger Global Management LLC, the $8 billion
hedge fund run by Chase Coleman and Feroz Dewan, said it
acquired a 9.9 percent stake in the daily deal site.  The shares rose 45 cents to $3.55 at 11:59 a.m. in New
York. Earlier, they touched $3.57, their biggest gain since
July. Tiger Global bought 65 million shares in Chicago-based
Groupon, a stake valued at $201.8 million based on yesterday’s
closing price, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission.  The investment is a sign of confidence that Groupon, which
has declined more than 80 percent since its November 2011
initial public offering, can find new channels of growth as
demand for online coupons fades. New York-based Tiger Global
also has stakes in struggling Internet portal  Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO)  and
 Facebook Inc. (FB) , operator of the world’s largest social network.  Groupon plunged to a record closing low of $2.63 last week
after reporting third-quarter revenue that missed estimates. It
sold shares at $20 apiece in its IPO, valuing the company at
about $12.7 billion.  Groupon backers divesting stakes include Battery Ventures,
which sold all of its 15.99 million shares earlier this year,
and Andreessen Horowitz, which sold its 5.1 million shares in
June. Bloomberg LP, the parent company of  Bloomberg News , is an
investor in Andreessen Horowitz.  Eric Lefkofsky, the chairman and largest shareholder in
Groupon, transferred 18.7 million of his company’s shares to
early investors, consultants and advisers in August.  To contact the reporter on this story:
