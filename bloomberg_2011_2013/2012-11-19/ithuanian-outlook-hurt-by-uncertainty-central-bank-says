Lithuania’s  economy  will probably
grow at a slower pace than previously estimated next year as
economic and political uncertainty reduce consumption and
investment, the central bank said.  Gross domestic product will expand 3.1 percent, down from
an August estimate of 3.4 percent,  Lietuvos Bankas , based in the
capital, Vilnius, forecast today in an e-mailed statement. It
kept this year’s 3 percent growth estimate unchanged.  The Baltic nation is awaiting the formation of a new
government after last month’s parliamentary elections were won
by parties pledging to boost the minimum wage and review the tax
system. GDP growth has slowed from the European Union’s second-
fastest pace of 5.9 percent last year as the continent’s debt
crisis damps demand for  Lithuania ’s products.  “Uncertainty about the future is restraining consumption
and forcing companies to delay expansion decisions,” the
central bank said.  The central bank also raised its inflation-rate forecasts
for this year and next, to 3.2 percent and 2.8 percent, from
August estimates of 2.9 percent in 2012 and 2.4 percent in 2013.  The revision reflected faster-than-expected growth of
prices for food, fuels and industrial goods, it said.  Consumer-price growth decelerated to 3.1 percent in
October, the slowest since July.  To contact the reporter on this story:
