Coal export prices at  South Africa ’s
 Richards Bay , the continent’s biggest terminal for shipping the
fuel, rose to their highest level in more than two months.  Coal for  immediate delivery  added $4.41, or 5.4 percent, to
$86.43 a metric ton in the week to Nov. 16, according to IHS
McCloskey data on Bloomberg. That’s the highest level since
Sept. 7. The price is quoted on a free-on-board basis, which
excludes delivery costs.  Prices may fall this week, Bevan Jones, a general manager
at London Commodity Brokers Ltd., said in a weekly note.  “South African coal is not pricing into most destinations
with Colombian coal comprising most cargoes into Amsterdam-
Rotterdam-Antwerp,” Jones wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
