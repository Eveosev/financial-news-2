     Nov. 19 (Bloomberg) --Crude oil options volatility fell as
futures rose on concern that  Israel ’s attacks on the  Gaza Strip 
will foment unrest in the  Middle East , and on optimism that U.S.
lawmakers can reach a budget compromise.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
January, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a
gauge of options prices, was 28.64 percent on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange  as of 1:38 p.m., down from 29.76 percent on
Nov. 16.  “It’s coming off because of the higher prices and we’re
moving out of a range,” said Fred Rigolini, vice president of
Paramount Options Inc. in  New York .  January-delivery crude oil rose $2.59, or 3 percent, to
$89.51 a barrel on the Nymex.  Israeli ground forces are poised to invade the Gaza Strip
for the first time in almost four years amid efforts by  Egypt 
and  Turkey  to help end the conflict in which 96 Palestinians and
three Israelis have been killed.  President  Barack Obama  is negotiating with a divided
Congress to try to avert $607 billion in automatic tax increases
and spending cuts. Obama told reporters during a news conference
in Bangkok yesterday that he is “confident we can get our
fiscal situation dealt with.”  The most active options in electronic trading today were
January $105 calls, which rose 4 cents to 22 cents a barrel on
volume of 2,862 lots at 1:44 p.m. January $75 puts were the
second-most active, with 2,848 lots exchanged as they fell 12
cents to 7 cents a barrel.  Bets that prices would rise, or calls, accounted for 53
percent trading volume.  Exchange Data  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
