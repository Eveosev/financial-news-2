BlackRock Inc. (BLK) , the world’s biggest
money manager, named Russ Koesterich to the newly created
position of chief investment strategist.  Koesterich will be responsible for communicating the firm’s
strategy and market outlook to investors and financial advisers,
New York-based BlackRock said today in a statement. Koesterich
will report to Ken Kroner, global head of the firm’s multi-asset
strategies group.  BlackRock, which manages $3.67 trillion, started a five-
year branding campaign earlier this year as it seeks to get
investors back into higher-yielding assets such as stocks. Chief
Executive Officer Laurence D. Fink and other BlackRock
executives have said that clients need to diversify and can be
harmed by staying in cash-like products.  “The financial world is more uncertain than it’s ever been
and a succession of seismic events has left investors unsure of
what to do next,” Koesterich said in the statement. “We
believe that opportunities do exist for investors.”  Koesterich, who in 2010 was named global investment
strategist for BlackRock’s iShares exchange-traded fund
business, will continue in that role, according to today’s
statement. Koesterich was previously the global head of
investment strategy for active equities and was a senior
portfolio manager in the U.S. market-neutral group at Barclays
Global Investors, which BlackRock acquired in 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
