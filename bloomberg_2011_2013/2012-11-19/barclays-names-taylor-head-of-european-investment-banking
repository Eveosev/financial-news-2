Barclays Plc (BARC) , Britain’s second-
largest bank, named Richard Taylor head of its  investment
banking  division for Europe, the Middle East and Africa,
replacing Tom King as the bank overhauls management of the unit.  Taylor will also keep his job as head of investment banking
for the U.K. and Ireland, London-based Barclays said in an
internal memorandum seen by Bloomberg News. A spokesman for the
bank declined to comment.  The lender is “maintaining a strong regional team that is
aligned with our global business,” Skip McGee, Barclays’s
corporate and investment banking chief executive officer in the
Americas and King, deputy head of the investment banking
division said in the memo. King became deputy head of investment
banking in October.  Barclays CEO  Antony Jenkins , who succeeded  Robert Diamond 
in August following the Libor-rigging scandal at its investment
bank, is reviewing which parts of the company will be sold or
shrunk as the bank seeks to boost profitability and overhaul its
culture. The company combined parts of its fixed income and
equities operations in October and promoted McGee.  As part of the announcement, Barclays said Mark Warham will
become sole head of mergers in EMEA, while Matthew Ponsonby will
be chief operating officer of investment banking in the region.  To contact the reporter on this story:
