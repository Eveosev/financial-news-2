West Texas Intermediate crude oil
futures rose above $88 a barrel for the first time since Nov. 7
as prices gained partly on concern that Middle East unrest will
disrupt supply.  WTI crude for January delivery rose as much as $1.13 to
$88.05 a barrel in electronic trading on the  New York  Mercantile
Exchange and was at $87.95 at 11:43 a.m. London time. Prices are
also gaining on speculation the U.S. will avert automatic
spending cuts and tax rises that threaten to throw the nation
into recession.  To contact the reporter on this story:
