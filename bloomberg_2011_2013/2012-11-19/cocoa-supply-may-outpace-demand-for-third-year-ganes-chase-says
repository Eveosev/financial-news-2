Cocoa supplies may outpace demand
for a third year if the weather is favorable for global crops,
according to Judy Ganes-Chase, the president of J. Ganes
Consulting LLC.  “The balance can swing from a shallow deficit of 11,000
metric tons to a surplus of as much as 138,000 tons if the
weather is fine,” she said during an interview today in
Abengourou, Ivory Coast. “I wouldn’t be surprised if we ended
the season in a surplus yet again.”  In the season started Oct. 1, production will total 4.05
million to 4.2 million tons, up from 3.99 million a year
earlier, Ganes-Chase estimates. Bean processing will rise 2.5
percent to 4.02 million tons after contracting 0.15 percent last
season, she said.  Cocoa will average $2,200 a ton to $2,250 this season,
Ganes-Chase forecast. Prices will be supported even as supplies
increase by a rebound in demand and political turmoil in Ivory
Coast, the world’s biggest producer, she said.  Useage by bean processors will probably grow because of
increased profitability, Ganes-Chase said. The so-called
combined ratio, which measures the price of cocoa butter and
powder relative to that of beans, has risen above 3, a level
that starts becoming more attractive for grinders to turn
factories back on, she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
