Qatar Telecom QSC (QTEL) , the countryâ€™s
biggest company by revenue, is seeking a syndicated loan for
about $1 billion to refinance existing debt, according to a
person with direct knowledge of the deal.  Qtel, as the Doha-based company is known, has requested
proposals from banks for loans maturing in three, four and five
years, the person said, who asked not to be identified as the
terms are private.  Officials from the company did not immediately respond to
an e-mailed request for comment.  The company signed about $2 billion of credit lines in 2010
that pay interest of 115 basis points to 145 basis points more
than benchmark rates, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
