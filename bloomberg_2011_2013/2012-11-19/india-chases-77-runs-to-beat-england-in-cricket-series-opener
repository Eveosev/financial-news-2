India needs 77 runs to beat England
in their series-opening cricket Test after dismissing the
touring team for 406 in its second innings on the final morning.  Resuming at 340-5 following on, England added 66 runs to
its total as spin bowler Pragyan Ojha removed Matt Prior for 91
and  Alastair Cook  for 176 to finish with four wickets for 120
from his 55 overs.  Zaheer Khan  had  Tim Bresnan  caught at short
cover to end the innings and send the teams to the lunch break.  India made 521-8 declared in its first innings before
bowling out England for 191 and enforced the follow on to try
and wrap up the victory without having to bat again.  The match is the first of four between the teams. England,
which secured a 4-0 sweep when the teams met in the U.K. last
year, hasnâ€™t won a Test series in India since its 1984-85 tour.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
