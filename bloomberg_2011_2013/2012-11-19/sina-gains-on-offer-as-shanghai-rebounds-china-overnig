Chinese equities jumped the most in
two months in New York as  Sina (SINA)  Corp. soared on a report e-
commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. will buy as much as 20
percent of the Internet company’s Twitter-like Weibo service.  The  Bloomberg China-US Equity Index (CH55BN)  of the most-traded
Chinese shares in the U.S. gained 2.2 percent to 91.58
yesterday, the biggest advance since Sept. 27. Sina jumped as
much as 13 percent after  China  Business News said Alibaba values
Weibo at $3 billion.  SouFun Holding Ltd. (SFUN)  climbed on rising home-
price data.  China Unicom (Hong Kong) Ltd. (CHU)  traded at the biggest
premium over Hong Kong since September after adding the most
third-generation mobile users this year last month.  The China-US measure gained after the  Shanghai Composite
Index (SHCOMP)  rebounded from below the key 2,000 level for the second
time in eight weeks, ending the day 0.1 percent higher. The
market’s ability to hold that “psychological level” is bullish
in the short term, according to Auerbach Grayson & Co. Shanghai-
based Sina, which has a market value of $3.2 billion, has lost
6.6 percent in New York this year, and  traded  for 61 times
estimated earnings on Nov. 14, the least since May.  “Alibaba’s reported valuation of Sina’s Weibo, if it is
real, gives a significant premium” to the short-message social
network, Echo He, a senior analyst at Maxim Group LLC who rates
the stock sell, said by phone in New York yesterday. “Sina does
need the investment to further support its development on
Weibo.”  China ETF Jumps  The  iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund , the biggest Chinese
exchange-traded fund in the U.S., advanced 2.2 percent to $36.55
yesterday in New York, the steepest one-day gain since Nov. 1.
The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index climbed 2 percent to 1,386.89,
as U.S. President  Barack Obama  expressed confidence that he will
be able to achieve agreement with Congress over the nation’s
budget.  Sina’s shares increased 7.8 percent to $48.59 in the U.S.,
the biggest one-day jump since Nov. 5. They earlier surged as
much as 13 percent to $50.80.  Alibaba, China’s biggest e-commerce company, may buy a 15
percent to 20 percent stake in Sina’s Weibo business, the report
by China Business News cited Cheng Lingfeng, a person in the
media industry, as saying.  China Unicom’s American depositary receipts advanced 5
percent to $15.42, the steepest climb since Aug. 23. The ADRs,
each representing 10 underlying shares, traded 1.5 percent  above 
its Hong Kong stock, the widest premium since Sept. 13.  China Telecom Dividend  The nation’s second-largest wireless operator, China Unicom
added a net 3.2 million 3G users for a total of 70.07 million
last month, according to data published on its website
yesterday. The increase compared with a 3.18 million gain in
September and was the biggest monthly addition this year.  China Telecom Corp. (CHA) , the nation’s biggest fixed-line phone
carrier, may raise its 2013 dividend to 9.5 Hong Kong cents (1.2
cents) from 8.5 cents after investors requested higher payouts,
Hong Kong’s Apple Daily reported, citing an unidentified person
in the fund industry. The company’s ADRs gained 3.4 percent in
New York, the most since Sept. 13, to $55.07. The ADRs’ 1.4
percent  premium  over Hong Kong shares was also the widest in two
months.  The  Shanghai  Composite rose to 2,016.98 by the close of
trading yesterday, paring its decline this year to 8.3 percent.
A rally in the final hour lifted the gauge from an intraday low
of 1,995.77. The gauge last breached 2,000 during intraday
trading on Sept. 26.  ‘Taking a Shot’  The rebound may have been spurred by government-backed
buying of stocks “but I don’t think anybody knows,” Richard Ross, a technical strategist at Auerbach Grayson said by phone
in New York yesterday. Even in the case of intervention, “I
would still say this is a good place to be taking a shot here,”
 he said, predicting a 5 percent to 7 percent gain in the
Shanghai measure this year.  The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  of companies traded
in Hong Kong, the gauge of so-called H shares, rose 0.5 percent
to 10,290.21 yesterday, climbing for a second trading day.  “I would be better a buyer of H shares than local Chinese
shares,” Ross said. “I see a nice rally in global equities
through the year-end and H shares stand to benefit
accordingly.”  China’s ruling Communist Party last week completed the most
important phase of its once-a-decade power transition, as Xi Jinping replaced Hu Jintao as the head of the party and the
nation’s military. The move ushers in the fifth generation of
leaders to take control of the world’s second-biggest economy.  ‘Still Uncertainty’  “There’s still uncertainty about the direction that the
new administration is going in,” Timothy Ghriskey, chief
investment officer at New York-based Solaris Group LLC, which
manages about $2 billion of assets including Chinese stocks,
said by phone yesterday. “Investors are sort of holding back
now as they would want to see actually what happens in actions,
not just in words.”  SouFun, China’s biggest real estate information website,
added 2.9 percent to $18.15 in New York, the biggest rally in
two weeks.  New home prices in the nation climbed in 35 of the 70
cities the government tracks in October, compared with 31 in
September, according to data from the statistics bureau issued
yesterday. Prices fell in 17 cities.  21Vianet Group Inc. (VNET) , a Beijing-based Internet data-center
service provider, surged after Piper Jaffray & Co. analyst
Christopher Larsen raised his price estimate by $1 to $16
yesterday. He reiterated a buy recommendation on the stock.  Yuan NDFs Strengthen  21Vianet’s ADRs rose 7 percent to $9.94, the biggest
advance since Aug. 27. They rebounded from a three-month low
reached on Nov. 16.  Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards on the  yuan  climbed
0.23 percent to 6.3325 per dollar in New York, strengthening the
most since Oct. 25, after the currency rose 0.02 percent to
6.2345 in Shanghai yesterday. The currency traded at a 1 percent
premium to the central bank’s daily fixing, the maximum it’s
allowed to fluctuate, according to the China Foreign Exchange
Trade System.  Thirty-day  volatility  in the Bloomberg China-US gauge was
18.37 yesterday, up from 17.15 on Nov. 16, and compares with
this year’s average of 22.59. The  Bloomberg Chinese Reverse
Mergers Index (CHINARTO) , which tracks a basket of companies that gained
U.S. listings after buying firms that already trade, added 1.7
percent to 70.71.  To contact the reporter on this story:
