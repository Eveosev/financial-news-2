Nordic electricity for delivery next
month climbed to the highest in more than two weeks as forecasts
of reduced rainfall indicated less water for hydropower
production.  Hydropower assets compared with the seasonal average may
fall by 34 percent to 6.46 terawatt-hours over the next two
weeks, Markedskraft AS data on Bloomberg show. A high pressure
weather system with dry and cool conditions may set in at the
end of next week, Energi Danmark A/S said on its website.  Electricity for delivery next month gained as much as 1.7
percent to 39.50 euros ($50.44) a megawatt-hour, the highest
since Nov. 1, and traded at 39.35 euros as of 2:42 p.m on Nasdaq
OMX Group Inc.’s energy exchange in Oslo. Power for January
through March gained 0.9 percent to 41 euros, having earlier
traded as high as 41.10 euros.  The benchmark near-quarter contract is unlikely to climb
above 44 euros, due to a glut of water and high nuclear
utilization rates, which together point to a higher power
balance than in the past few winter periods, SEB AB,  Sweden ’s
third-largest bank, said today in an e-mailed research note.  The Nordic region meets more than half its power needs by
running  water through turbines , which is why rain affects
electricity prices. Nuclear reactors provide a fifth of the
region’s electricity.  EON SE,  Germany ’s biggest utility, has delayed the start of
the Swedish 473-megawatt Oskarshamn-1 reactor by seven days to
Nov. 26, the company said today in a filing with the Nord Pool
Spot AS exchange in Oslo. The reactor has been idle since Oct.
30, 2011.  Nordic nuclear reactors were running at 96 percent of their
combined capacity as of 7:33 a.m., up by 2 percentage points
from Nov. 16, data from operators showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
