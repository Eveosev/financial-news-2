Old Mutual Plc (OML) , the U.K.’s third-
largest insurer, bought a majority stake in Uruguay’s Aiva
Business Platforms to boost sales in  Latin America .  Family-owned Aiva employs about 120 people and has more
than $800 million in assets under management, Old Mutual said in
a statement today. Terms of the purchase weren’t disclosed.  “Aiva, together with Old Mutual’s  emerging markets 
businesses, will take advantage of operational synergies in
Colombia and Mexico in due course,” London-based Old Mutual
said in the statement.  The insurer is expanding its emerging-markets division,
which includes China, India and Mexico, amid a deepening
economic slump in Europe. Revenue at the unit increased 19
percent in the third quarter, making it the firm’s fastest-
growing division.  The  shares  rose 2.3 percent, the most since Oct. 1, to
23.99 rand at the 5 p.m. close in Johannesburg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
