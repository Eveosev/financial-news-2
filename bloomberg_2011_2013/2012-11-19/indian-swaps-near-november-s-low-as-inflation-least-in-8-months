India’s  interest-rate swaps  were
near their lowest level this month on speculation slowing
inflation and economic growth will prompt the central bank to
cut interest rates.  The wholesale-price index rose 7.45 percent in October from
a year earlier, the least since February, the Commerce Ministry
reported last week. Industrial output dropped 0.4 percent in
September after a revised 2.3 percent gain in August, according
to the  Central Statistical Office .  “Swaps are reflecting expectations of a cut in interest
rates,” said Debendra Kumar Dash, a fixed-income trader at
 Development Credit Bank Ltd. (DEVB)  in Mumbai. “The deceleration in
inflation and drop in economic activity should spur some
monetary easing in January.”  The fixed payment to lock in one-year borrowing costs was
at 7.75 percent in Mumbai, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The rate touched 7.72 percent on Nov. 15, the lowest
level since Oct. 30.  The yield on the benchmark 8.15 percent government bonds
due June 2022 was little changed at 8.19 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
