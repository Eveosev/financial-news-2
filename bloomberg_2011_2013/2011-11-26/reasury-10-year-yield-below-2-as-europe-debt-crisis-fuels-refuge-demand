Treasuries rose, pushing the yield
on the 10-year note down for a second week, as concern the
European debt crisis may escalate drove investors to the safety
of  U.S. government debt .  Benchmark 10-year yields closed at less than 2 percent for
the first time in eight weeks and fell below comparable German
bunds. The yield difference widened to 0.31 percentage point,
the most since April 2009, as borrowing costs in the European
region soared. U.S. auction yields dropped to record lows as the
Treasury sold $99 billion in notes. A report Dec. 2 is forecast
to show the U.S. added 120,000 jobs in November.  “There’s not a lot of confidence in places outside the
U.S. right now,” said Christopher Bury, co-head of fixed-income
rates at Jefferies Group Inc., one of the 21 primary dealers
that trade with the  Federal Reserve . “The overall risks have
been increasing and that’s contributed to Treasuries performance
over the last week. Discussions out of Europe are not making
much headway and the markets are not trading very well.”  Ten-year note yields dropped five basis points, or 0.05
percentage point, on the week to 1.96 percent in New York,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 2 percent note
due in November 2021 rose 13/32, or $4.06 per $1000 face amount,
to 100 10/32.  Yield Records  The yield dropped to 1.87 percent on Nov. 23, approaching
the record low 1.67 percent set Sept. 23.  Trading in Treasuries closed at 2 p.m. yesterday in  New
York , after being shut the previous day for Thanksgiving.  U.S. yields set record lows at auctions this week even as
the U.S. deficit reduction Congress’s supercommittee failed Nov.
21 to reach a deal, setting the stage for $1.2 trillion in
automatic spending cuts, and as the Fed and the Treasury sold
$116 billion in notes.  A $35 billion two-year note auction on Nov. 21 produced the
highest bid-to-cover ratio on record for a fixed-coupon Treasury
note or bond, 4.07, while a $35 billion five-year debt sale the
next day was priced at a record low yield for the securities of
0.937 percent. A $29 billion seven-year auction on Nov. 23
garnered a record low yield of 1.415 percent.  The Fed sold $8.531 billion of securities maturing in
February 2012 through July 2012 on Nov. 21 as part of its plan
to lower borrowing costs that’s become known as Operation Twist,
according to the Fed Bank of New York’s website. The central
bank also sold $8.63 billion in Treasuries maturing from March
2014 to November 2014, in a second operation that day.  Supply Handle  “Supply has never been a problem when the markets are in
turmoil,” Paul Horrmann, a broker in New York at Tradition
Asiel Securities Inc., an interdealer broker said Nov. 21.
“There doesn’t seem to be any concrete solutions in Europe.”  Germany  failed to sell all the bonds it wanted to at an
auction Nov. 23, sparking concern investors are becoming wary of
even the most creditworthy euro-region nations. Total bids at
the auction of the bunds due in January 2022 amounted to 3.889
billion euros ($5.2 billion) out of a maximum target for the
sale of 6 billion euros, according to Bundesbank data. The yield
on the 10-year German bund climbed yesterday to 2.26 percent,
the highest since Oct. 28.  “The market is anticipating that if Germany is going to be
wrapping or guaranteeing in some way other countries debts, then
German yields should be higher,” Bury said.  Merkel Rules  German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  on Nov. 24 ruled out joint
euro-area borrowing and an expanded role for the  European
Central Bank  in fighting the debt crisis.  The cost of insuring European sovereign bonds against
default soared to a record and Spanish, Italian and Belgian two-
year notes slumped. Two-year Italian yields climbed 58 basis
points to a euro-era record high 7.90 percent.  Italy had to pay almost 7 percent to sell six-month bills
at an auction yesterday, fanning investor concern that the
world’s fourth-biggest borrower may struggle to finance its
debt. The Italian Treasury paid 6.504 percent to auction 8
billion euros of the six-month debt, almost twice the 3.535
percent a month ago and the highest since August 1997.  “With European yields off so much, it will take a while
for domestic traders to reassess relative value,” said  Jim Vogel , interest rate strategist at FTN Financial in  Memphis ,
 Tennessee . “If we become the new ultra safe haven, we can’t
short Treasuries.”  Stress Measure  Interest-rate swap spreads, a measure of stress in credit
markets, climbed this week. The difference between the two-year
swap rate and the comparable-maturity Treasury note yield
increased a basis point yesterday to 54.81, near the highest
since May 2010, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  European governments may ease provisions in a planned
permanent rescue fund requiring bondholders to share losses in
sovereign bailouts, German Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble 
suggested yesterday.  There may be changes to the European Stability Mechanism,
due to come into force in 2013. European leaders persuaded
bondholders last month to accept a 50 percent loss on their
holdings of Greek debt as part of an interim rescue effort.  Europe ’s debt crisis and the ensuing demand for safety has
pushed Treasuries up 9.7 percent this year, set for the biggest
annual gain since 2008, according to Bank of America Merrill
Lynch data. German bunds returned 7 percent and Japanese bonds
advanced 2 percent, the indexes show.  The Labor Department may report a 120,000 increase in
November nonfarm payroll jobs, up from an 80,000 gain in
October, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg News
survey of 32 economists.  To contact the reporter on this story:
