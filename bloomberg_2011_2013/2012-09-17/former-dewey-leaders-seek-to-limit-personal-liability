The top three former executives at
Dewey & LeBoeuf LLP, the defunct  law firm , filed objections to
aspects of the proposed settlements with about 400 partners
designed to bring in $71 million.  Steven Davis , the former chairman; Stephen DiCarmine, the
former  executive director , and Joel Sanders, the ex-chief
financial officer, said last week that it’s improper that
releases under the settlements end up making them solely liable
for the firm’s failure.  The law doesn’t permit the settlements to eliminate their
rights to have liability for only their “proportionate share”
of damages, the three ex-executives said in a filing in U.S.
Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan. They also object to making secret
the identities of the settling partners, saying they need to
know who settled in preparing their defenses.  The firm’s former leaders also want the bankruptcy judge to
strike a provision that would prevent settling partners from
helping them fight lawsuits. The settlements come up for
approval at a Sept. 20 hearing.  Several former partners have a motion scheduled for hearing
that day asking the judge to appoint a Chapter 11 trustee. The
official committee representing partners instead advocates
having an examiner perform an investigation before settlements
are approved.  Dewey once had 1,300 lawyers before liquidation began under
Chapter 11 in May. The petition listed assets of $193 million
and liabilities of $245.4 million as of April 30.  The case is In re Dewey & LeBoeuf LLP, 12-12321,  U.S.
Bankruptcy Court , Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
