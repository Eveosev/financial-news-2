Singapore home sales dropped 27
percent in August from a month ago as homebuyers stayed away
from purchases in a month considered inauspicious based on the
Chinese Lunar calendar.  The island state’s private residential property sales fell
to 1,421 units from 1,946 apartments in July, according to data
released by the  Urban Redevelopment Authority  today.  “Sales last month declined because the Ghost Festival in
the seventh month of the Chinese lunar calendar is considered an
unlucky time to buy according to Chinese tradition,” said
Nicholas Mak, Singapore-based  executive director  at SLP
International Property Consultants, a real estate consulting
company. “Sales should rebound when we get data next month.”  Singapore is trying to rein in property prices in a city
that’s about half the size of  Los Angeles , where residential
 prices  surged to a record at the end of 2011. The government
earlier this month said it plans to cap the number of homes that
can be developed in suburban projects as it seeks to curb the
increasing trend of so-called shoebox apartments.  One Dusun Residences sold 153 homes of the 154 available,
while The Parc Olympia development on Flora Drive with 110
homes, and V on Shenton on the central business district, which
sold 65 apartments, were among the most popular sites, the data
showed.  Prices of non-landed private residential properties
increased by 0.6 percent in the Core Central Region in the
quarter ended June compared with a decrease of 0.6 percent in
the three months to March 31, a separate government report
showed. Prices in Outside Central Region climbed at a slower
pace of 0.4 percent in the quarter, compared with a gain of 1.1
percent in the previous quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
