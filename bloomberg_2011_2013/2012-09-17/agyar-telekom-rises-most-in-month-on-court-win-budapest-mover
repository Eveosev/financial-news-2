Magyar Telekom Nyrt., the Hungarian
unit of  Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE) , rose the most in a month after a
Hungarian court annulled the results of a tender awarding mobile
frequency to a potential competitor.  The shares rose 2.4 percent 429 forint by the close in
Budapest, the biggest rally since Aug. 15. The benchmark BUX
index of shares slid 0.8 percent.  The court found “serious procedural law infringements” in
the tender for the country’s fourth mobile frequency, which was
won by a consortium of state-owned companies, after the three
existing mobile service providers, Magyar Telekom and the local
units of Vodafone Plc’s and  Telenor ASA (TEL) , appealed the results.  “Based on existing regulations at the time of the tender,
state-owned companies couldn’t have taken part as bidders in the
tender,” Gyorgy Mohay, the ruling judge in the case said today
when presenting the ruling.  The court’s ruling is binding and can’t be appealed, Mohay
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
