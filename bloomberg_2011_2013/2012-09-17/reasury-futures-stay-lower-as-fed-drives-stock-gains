Treasuries fell for a second day as
the Federal Reserve’s decision to spur the  U.S. economy  with
asset purchases sent stocks higher around the world.  U.S. government securities handed investors a 0.6 percent
loss in the past month through Sept. 14, Bank of America Merrill
Lynch indexes show. The  MSCI All-Country World Index (MXWD)  of shares
returned more than 5 percent, including reinvested dividends,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The Fed said on Sept.
13 it would buy $40 billion of mortgage-backed securities a
month. The  European Central Bank  announced plans the week before
to purchase debt in the euro area.  “The bias is for higher yields over the next month or
two,” said  Peter Jolly , Sydney-based head of market research
for National Australia Bank Ltd. “We have seen some big
sledgehammers from the ECB and, notably, the Fed that will
encourage an economic recovery.”  Benchmark U.S. 10-year  rates  rose one basis points to 1.87
percent as of 7:48 a.m. in London, according to Bloomberg Bond
Trader prices. The price of the 1.625 percent security due in
August 2022 fell 2/32 to 97 3/4.  Benchmark 10-year yields climbed as high as 1.892 percent
on Sept. 14, the most since May 10.  To contact the reporter on this story:
