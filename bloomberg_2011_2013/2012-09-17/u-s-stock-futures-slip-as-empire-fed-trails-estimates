U.S. stock-index futures maintained
losses after a report showed manufacturing in the  New York  area
shrank more than forecast  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index expiring in
December lost 0.3 percent to 1,455.2 at 8:31 a.m. in New York.  The  Federal Reserve  Bank of New York’s general economic
index dropped to minus 10.41, the lowest since April 2009, from
minus 5.85 in August. The median forecast of 53 economists in a
Bloomberg survey called for minus 2. Readings less than zero
signal contraction in the so-called Empire State Index that
covers New York, northern  New Jersey  and southern Connecticut.  U.S. stocks have advanced for two straight weeks, sending
the S&P 500 to the highest level since 2007, as the Federal
Reserve’s plan to buy mortgage securities fueled demand for
riskier assets.  Commodity, financial and industrial shares had the biggest
gains last week among 10 groups in the  S&P 500 . U.S. Steel
Corp. and Caterpillar Inc. climbed at least 5.7 percent during
the week. Bank of America Corp. increased 8.5 percent as a
German court cleared the way for Europe’s bailout fund. Apple
Inc. rose 1.6 percent to a record after introducing a new
version of the iPhone.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
