Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) , the
second-biggest maker of processors for personal computers, said
Thomas Seifert is resigning as chief financial officer and
departing the company.  Seifert, who joined AMD as CFO in 2009, will leave as of
Sept. 28 and a search is under way for his successor, the
company said in a statement. Devinder Kumar, senior vice
president and corporate controller, will serve as interim chief
financial officer, AMD said.  “Seifert’s departure is not based on any disagreement over
the company’s accounting principles or practices, or financial
statement disclosures,” AMD said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
