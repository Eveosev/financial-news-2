Estonian doctors and nurses will
strike starting Oct. 1 over complaints that poor working
conditions are prompting an exodus of medical staff from the
Baltic nation.  Hospitals in the capital, Tallinn, and the second-biggest
city, Tartu, will halt outpatient services and may stop
inpatient care a week later, the doctors’ and medical workers’
unions said today in a joint e-mailed statement. Other major
hospitals may join the strike in the second week, they said,
without providing a possible duration for the action.  Teachers went on strike in March to demand higher salaries
as  Estonia  became the only euro-area nation to post budget
surpluses in the last two years by freezing public-sector wages.
Doctors are leaving for countries such as  Finland , where
vacancies are increasing, salaries are four times higher and the
language is closely related to Estonian, the unions say.  Doctors want “to be able to treat patients in our home
country with a normal workload and motivating wages,” Iivi
Luik, the head of the medical workers’ union, said in today’s
statement.  About a quarter of Estonia’s 4,000 specialized doctors are
above pension age, and more than a third of all physicians are
considering working abroad, the doctors’ union said in June.  Doctors in the  North Estonia Medical Center , the country’s
biggest hospital, earn 2,296 euros ($3,006) a month, compared
with the national average of 900 euros, while they exceed
nominal workloads by an average of 43 percent, according to the
hospital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
