Tesla Motors Inc. (TSLA)  rose the most in
four months after Morgan Stanley boosted its rating on the
electric-car maker to overweight, saying concerns that Model S
production is increasing too slowly “are overdone.”  The  shares  climbed 7.1 percent to $32.54 at the close in
New York, its biggest daily advance since May 10. Tesla has
gained 14 percent this year.  “A new Model S has to be perfect right out of the box,”
Adam Jonas, a Morgan Stanley analyst, wrote in a report. “We
have urged investors to allow for a slower Model S ramp as Tesla
prioritizes perfection over quantity.” Jonas, who raised his
rating from underweight, estimated deliveries of 230 of the cars
this quarter, 2,000 in the fourth quarter and 15,000 in 2013.  Tesla, based in  Palo Alto , California, wants to become
profitable from sales of the Model S as early as next year.
Chief Executive Officer  Elon Musk  has said the company has
10,000 orders for the vehicle and will deliver 5,300 this year
and 20,000 in 2013. The Model S starts at $57,400.  Jonas raised his price target on Tesla to $50 from $45.  To contact the reporter on this story:
