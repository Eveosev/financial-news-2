The Polish zloty retreated from a
four-week high after European Union finance minister failed to
make headway about new banking regulations for the bloc.  The zloty lost 1 percent to 4.1028 per euro as of 5:06 p.m.
in Warsaw, the steepest decline among more than 20 emerging-
market currencies tracked by Bloomberg. The yield on 10-year
notes rose 2 basis points to 4.97 percent.  While the Polish zloty jumped to the strongest level since
Aug. 17 last week as the  Federal Reserve  pledged to buy bonds
until the U.S. job market improves, it weakened after EU finance
ministers meeting in Cyprus didn’t agree on the timetable for a
more unified banking system.  “The profit-taking that has set in after a few days of
gains will probably turn investors’ attention to local
factors,”  Marcin Mrowiec , chief economist at  Bank Pekao SA (PEO) 
wrote in an e-mailed note to clients. “These are unlikely to be
conducive to zloty’s appreciation.”  Polish  industrial output  growth probably slowed to 1.2
percent last month from 5.2 percent in July, the statistics
office will say on Sept. 19, according to a median estimate in a
Bloomberg survey of economists.  To contact the reporter on this story:
