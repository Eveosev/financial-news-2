On the one-year anniversary of the  Occupy Wall Street  movement, it’s easy to get caught up in the numbers: hundreds of protesters converging on  New York ’s financial district, dozens arrested, at least 16 U.S. cities with protests planned, one concert featuring Tom Morello of Rage Against the Machine. There are, however, other ways to measure the impact of this “ roving carnival ”: how much money the movement is raising and where it's going. While the Alliance for Global Justice  donation page  and other related  donation sites  are user-friendly, the movement’s New York City General Assembly accounting working group’s  records  are less so. The  last meeting notes  posted to the site are from March 31. According to the group’s “General Standard Operating Procedures,” published April 8, updates to its  donations  and  expenditures  would be made public. Yet both links now return the message, “This site has been archived or suspended.”   Watching the tweets, images and videos stream in, I want to believe that OWS has the potential to help narrow inequality in the U.S. I don’t want to make an e-donation or  order the protesters a pizza . If the goal of today’s protests is to increase awareness and re-energize its protesters, the movement seems to be achieving that. But if the goal is to push OWS forward, and elevate the conversation into action that results in lasting change, the actions of the last few months don’t look too promising.
