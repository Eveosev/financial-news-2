Sight deposits of domestic banks
with the  Swiss National Bank  increased last week.  Average sight deposits rose to 294.2 billion francs ($317
billion) in the week ending Sept. 14 from 291.1 billion francs
in the previous week, the Zurich-based SNB said in a  statement 
on its website today. Average sight deposits calculated on an
accumulated monthly basis advanced to 290.5 billion francs from
289.2 billion francs, the central bank said.  Sight deposits have been pushed higher as the SNB increased
liquidity and bought euros from banks to defend its currency
ceiling, crediting lendersâ€™ deposits with the amount of francs
sold. The central bank introduced the limit of 1.20 francs per
euro in September 2011 to fight deflation risks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
