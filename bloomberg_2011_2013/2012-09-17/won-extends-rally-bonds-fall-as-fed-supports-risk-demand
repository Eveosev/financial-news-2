South  Korea ’s won strengthened to a
six-month high and government bonds fell as the  Federal
Reserve ’s announcement of further stimulus continued to support
demand for riskier assets.  Overseas investors bought $1.7 billion more of the nation’s
shares than they sold last week, exchange data show. Policy
makers must control volatile capital flows as quantitative
easing measures taken in the U.S. and Europe have a “negative
spillover” into  developing countries , Bank of Korea Governor
Kim Choong Soo said on Sept. 14.  “It’s a market still driven by Fed’s announcement,
although further gains will depend on overseas inflows to the
stock market” said Lee Jung Hyun, a Seoul-based currency dealer
for  Industrial Bank of Korea. (024110)  The risk of central bank
intervention to curb currency gains is limiting appreciation,
according to Lee.  The won advanced 0.1 percent to close at 1,115.97 per
dollar in  Seoul , after a 1 percent gain on Sept. 14 that marked
its best performance since May, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It earlier touched 1,113.35, the strongest level
since March 2. One-month implied volatility, a measure of
exchange-rate swings used to price options, rose 24 basis
points, or 0.24 percentage point, to 6.15 percent.  Sales at major South Korean department stores dropped 6.9
percent last month, the biggest decline since November 2004, a
government report showed today.  Bonds Slide  The yield on the government’s 3.25 percent bonds due June
2015 increased four basis points to 2.90 percent, the highest
level in almost a month, Korea Exchange Inc. prices show. Three-
year debt futures slid 0.10 to 105.87 and the one-year interest-
rate swap advanced four basis points to 2.96 percent.  The U.S. 10-year bond yield climbed 14 basis points to 1.87
percent in  New York  on Sept. 14, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  “U.S. Treasuries fell last week as the Fed’s announcement
of another quantitative easing spurred inflation concerns, and
similar worries are affecting the Korean market today,” said
Kong Dong Rak, a Seoul-based bond analyst at Taurus Investment &
Securities Co.  To contact the reporter on this story:
