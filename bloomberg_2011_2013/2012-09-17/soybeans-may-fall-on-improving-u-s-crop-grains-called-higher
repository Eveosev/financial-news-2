What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets, which resume trading at 5 p.m.
on the Chicago Board of Trade.  -- Soybean futures may open 3 cents to 5 cents a bushel lower
after rain improved U.S. crop  conditions , and projected moisture
in  South America  may aid early crop development, Jerrod Kitt,
the director of research at Chicago-based Linn Group, said in a
telephone interview.  -- Wheat futures may open steady to 2 cents a bushel higher on
speculation that dry weather in the next two weeks will hinder
planting in the U.S. Great Plains, where drought conditions
cover about 40 percent of the region, Kitt said.  -- Corn futures are called to open steady to 2 cents a bushel
higher as the lowest prices in seven weeks and forecasts for
falling world wheat production spur increased demand from
livestock producers, Kitt said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
