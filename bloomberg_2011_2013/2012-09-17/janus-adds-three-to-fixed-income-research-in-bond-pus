Janus Capital Group Inc. (JNS) , the
Denver-based asset manager struggling with client withdrawals,
added three analysts to its fixed-income research team as part
of an effort to reduce the firm’s reliance on stock-focused
investments.  Craig Klein will serve as global credit analyst, joining
Janus from UBS Securities, where he was part of the firm’s
special situations group, the company said today in a statement.
Jason Brooks, former director of commercial mortgage-backed
securities at TIAA-CREF, was appointed global securitized
products analyst, and Corinna Lyon, a former member of Janus’s
sales and marketing team, was named portfolio information
analyst,  “The addition of these professionals further demonstrates
Janus’s commitment to offering the depth and personnel necessary
to deliver strong risk-adjusted returns and preserve capital for
our clients,” Gibson Smith, the firm’s co-chief investment
officer,  fixed income , said in the statement.  Chief Executive Officer Richard M. Weil, a former executive
at bond giant Pacific Investment Management Co., has worked to
diversify the firm since he took over in February 2010 by
expanding its fixed-income capabilities. Janus’s bond lineup
attracted $1.1 billion in deposits in the second quarter, while
the rest of the company lost $5.1 billion in client withdrawals,
making for the firm’s 12th consecutive quarter of net
redemptions.  Assets in bond-only products accounted for $23.8 billion,
or 16 percent of Janus’s total assets as of June 30. Janus owns
the Janus, Intech and Perkins funds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
