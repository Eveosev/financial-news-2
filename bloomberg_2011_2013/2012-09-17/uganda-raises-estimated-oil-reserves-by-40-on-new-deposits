Uganda raised estimated oil
reserves by 40 percent to 3.5 billion barrels after two new
discoveries, according to Ernest Rubondo, the commissioner for
petroleum exploration and production.  The increase from 2.5 billion barrels follows appraisal
work at the two deposits as well as revisions from 10 existing
fields, he said today by phone from Entebbe, near Kampala, the
capital.  Uganda is set to become Africa’s newest oil producer when
London-based  Tullow Oil Plc (TLW)  and its partners, China National
Offshore Oil Corp. and France’s Total SA, begin pumping crude
from 2016. Output had been held up by legal hitches and delays
clearing regulatory obstacles.  The new fields are in exploration area 1, while the 10
fields are in area 1 and 2 of the Albertine region near the
border with the  Democratic Republic  of Congo, he said.  “We made two new discoveries in May and June last year,”
Rubondo said. “Evaluations of these discoveries were made this
year and there was an ongoing appraisal of 10 fields.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
