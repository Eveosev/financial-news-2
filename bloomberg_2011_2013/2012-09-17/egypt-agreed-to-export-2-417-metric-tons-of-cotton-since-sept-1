Egypt  agreed to export 2,417 metric
tons of cotton since the current marketing year began Sept. 1,
the Alexandria Cotton Exporters Association said.  Shipments of the fiber were worth $7 million through Sept.
13, the group said today in a weekly bulletin. The Giza 88
variety accounted for 872 tons of agreed sales and Giza 86 made
up the rest, it said.  Egypt produces the worldâ€™s finest extra-long staple cotton,
which is stronger and softer than shorter-staple cotton and used
in luxury clothing. Switzerland, Bangladesh and  India  are the
top importers of Egyptian cotton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
