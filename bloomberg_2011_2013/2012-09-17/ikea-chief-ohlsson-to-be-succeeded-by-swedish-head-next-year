Ikea,  the world’s largest home-
furnishings retailer, said Chief Executive Officer Mikael Ohlsson will step down next year after a career spanning more
than 30 years and be succeeded by the head of its Swedish unit.  Ohlsson, who became CEO in 2009, will be replaced as
president and CEO on Sept. 1, 2013, the company said today in a
e-mailed statement. His replacement will be 41-year-old Peter
Agnefjall, who has held a number of management positions at the
retailer since 1995.  Agnefjall will face the challenge of continuing Ikea’s
expansion outside of  Europe , where the company gets about 80
percent of sales. The retailer said in June it would consider
entering  India  after policy clarity, and open stores faster in
 China . Today, Ikea said its business direction, covering the
period through 2020, will remain in place.  “I have had the privilege to follow Peter since he first
joined Ikea and we have collaborated closely throughout the
years,” Ohlsson said in the statement. “Peter has a strong
commitment to Ikea and our vision and is a good leader.”  Ohlsson, 55, plans to use his past experience “at board
capacity in various businesses and organizations and spend more
time with his family,” Ikea said in the statement.  Sales at Ikea have risen every year since 2001, and climbed
6.9 percent to 25.2 billion euros ($33.1 billion) in the fiscal
year ended Aug. 31, 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
