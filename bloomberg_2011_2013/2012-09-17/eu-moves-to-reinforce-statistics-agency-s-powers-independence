The European Union reinforced the
powers and independence of its statistics office, including
strengthening the autonomy of the head of the agency, as part of
efforts to prevent a recurrence of the sovereign-debt crisis.  The European Commission cited “the need to strengthen the
governance of European statistics, taking into account
significant developments in recent years,” the EU’s executive
arm in Brussels said in a statement today. Those developments
included  Greece ’s discovery in late 2009 that its  budget deficit 
was three times larger than estimated, which prompted the EU to
complain of “severe irregularities” in the nation’s economic
figures.  The measures to bolster Eurostat, the Luxembourg-based
statistics agency, are part of the EU’s efforts to strengthen
oversight of the budgets and economic policies of the 27 EU
governments. The strengthening of Eurostat “should be mirrored
at the national level by all member states as soon as
possible,” according to the statement.  “Events related to some national statistics in the recent
past created doubts among the public and global investors about
the reliability of statistics, with damaging consequences for
the European system of statistics as a whole,” the EU said.  In particular, today’s measures underline the independence
of the head of Eurostat. “Transparent recruitment and dismissal
procedures are required for the chief statistician, based on
professional criteria only, and he/she must act in an entirely
autonomous manner in carrying out his/her tasks,” the EU said.  Today’s moves follow a decision in 2010 to grant Eurostat
power to investigate national accounts more closely.  To contact the reporter on this story:
