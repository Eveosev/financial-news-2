BP Plc (BP/)  and its partners in the
Russian oil venture TNK-BP won dismissal of Norex Petroleum
Ltd.’s lawsuit claiming more than $1 billion damages over the
loss of a controlling stake in a Russian oil company.  Justice Eileen Bransten of New York State Supreme Court in
Manhattan dismissed Norex’s complaint in a decision made public
today, saying it was “clearly untimely” and barred under the
statute of limitations.  Norex sued BP, Access Industries Inc.,  Alfa Group 
Consortium, Renova Inc., and TNK-BP last year in New York state
court, claiming it was wrongfully stripped of its controlling
interest in the Russian oil company Yugraneft and was owed
dividends.  Norex, which said it had a 60 percent stake in Yugraneft
that was reduced to 20 percent by a Russian court, claimed
damages of more than $1 billion. Yugraneft is a  subsidiary  of
TNK-BP.  Norex Chairman Alex Rotzang said the company would appeal
the decision.  “Norex believes there are strong grounds for an appeal,”
he said in a statement.  Owen Pell, an attorney at  White & Case  who represented TNK-
BP, said the company was pleased with the decision. Attorneys
for BP, Access, Alfa Group and Renova didn’t immediately comment
or couldn’t be reached for comment.  The case is Norex Petroleum Ltd. v. Blavatnik, 650591-2011,
New York State Supreme Court, New York County (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
