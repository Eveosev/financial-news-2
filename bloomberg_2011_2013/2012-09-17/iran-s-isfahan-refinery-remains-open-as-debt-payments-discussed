Iran ’s refinery in Isfahan is still
operating as it holds talks with Isfahan Petrochemical Co. on
payments owed, a spokesman for the  oil company  said.  Isfahan Oil Refining Co. stopped supplying feedstock to the
chemical plant after debts rose to more than 2.4 trillion rials
($196 million), according to Mohammad Sadeq Hajian.  “Both companies had a meeting in Tehran last week to
discuss about possible ways for clearing debts,” Hajian said
today in a phone interview. “But as officials of Isfahan
Petrochemical were insisting that they don’t have enough money
to settle even a small share of the debts, officials of Isfahan
refinery didn‘t agree to start providing them with feedstock.”  The petrochemical producer halted operations because of
insufficient funds to buy feedstock, pay wages and settle
overdue debt, state-run  Mehr news agency  reported Sept. 2.
 Tehran Times  said Sept. 11 that the 370,000 barrel-a-day
refinery also shut, citing a statement from the oil company.  “Our operation has never been shut and we have no debts to
pay,” Hajian said. “Arak Petrochemical Co. and Sepahan Oil Co.
in Isfahan are still buying feedstock from us.”  Iran is facing declining income from energy sales amid
international sanctions against buyers of its oil. The U.S. and
allied nations imposing embargoes have said  Iran’s nuclear
program  may include efforts to develop atomic weapons. The
Islamic republic denies the charge and says it wants nuclear
expertise for civilian use.  To contact the reporter on this story:
