Bolivia ’s cultivation of the coca
leaf, the raw material used to produce cocaine, dropped roughly
12 percent in 2011 from 2010, according to a  survey  published
today.  The national coca monitoring survey by the United Nations
Office on Drugs and Crime and Bolivia’s government showed that
the area under cultivation decreased to 27,200 hectares from
31,000 (105 square miles from 120), marking the first such
decline in the Andean nation since 2005.  The survey’s release follows last week’s publication of a
U.S. government report that found Bolivia had “failed
demonstrably during the previous 12 months to adhere to their
obligations under international narcotics agreements.” Bolivian
President  Evo Morales , a former coca farmer, rejected the U.S.
position.  “If they want authority in the fight against drug
trafficking, why doesn’t the U.S. eliminate the market in the
U.S.?” Morales said Sept. 15 in the state of Potosi.  The U.S.  Presidential Memorandum  also listed Venezuela and
Myanmar as having failed to fight the drug trade.  The coca leaf has an important role in indigenous Bolivian
religion and culture, and the government accepts cultivation of
77 square miles of coca leaf for traditional uses.  Bolivia expelled the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration
in 2008, and withdrew in 2011 from a UN convention that limits
chewing the coca leaf.  Data published by the U.S. Office of National Drug Control
Policy also  note a decrease  in 2011 from 2010, but said
potential cocaine production increased due to more efficient
production techniques.  To contact the reporter on this story:
