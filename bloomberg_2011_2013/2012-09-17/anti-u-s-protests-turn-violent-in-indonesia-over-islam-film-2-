About 400 Indonesian protesters
clashed with police outside the U.S. Embassy in Jakarta as
demonstrations against an anti-Islam film spread to  Southeast
Asia .  Police fired tear gas when the demonstrators started
throwing rocks at officers outside the embassy, spokesman
Rikwanto, who goes by only one name, said by telephone today.
The protest ended about 5 p.m. and the street in front of the
embassy has been reopened, Rikwanto said.  “Eleven officers are injured because of the rock throwing,
with some protesters also using slingshots.” Rikwanto said.
“The area is now littered with rocks.”  Arab protests against a film denigrating Islam eased
yesterday after mobs stormed the American embassy compound in
 Tunisia  and targeted diplomatic missions in Sudan and Yemen.
Four Americans were killed in a Sept. 11 attack on the U.S.
consulate in Benghazi,  Libya .  The Islamic Defenders Front, which has led raids on
nightclubs and forced Lady Gaga to cancel a concert in June,
helped organize today’s protests. While  Indonesia  has the
world’s largest population of Muslims, it maintains a secular
government and recognizes other religions.  The U.S. Embassy in  Bangkok  said it would close at noon
tomorrow after Thai police informed it that “several hundred
people” planned a demonstration beginning at 1 p.m. local time.
The embassy “is not aware at this time of any specific threat
to U.S. citizens in  Thailand ,” according to a statement posted
on its website today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
