Turkish prosecutors ordered the
body of former Turkish President Turgut Ozal to be exhumed for
an autopsy to investigate suspicions surrounding his death, the
Anatolia agency said.  The chief prosecutors’ office in Ankara issued the ruling
today, Anatolia said.  A state-run board under the supervision of President
 Abdullah Gul  said in a report in June that the 1993 death of
Ozal was suspicious and should be investigated. It said there
had been no satisfactory investigation into allegations by some
of Ozal’s family members and lawmakers that he might have been
poisoned.  Ozal was elected prime minister in 1983 after civilian rule
was restored following a military coup. He was president between
1989 and 1993 and died that year aged 65.  To contact the reporter on this story:
