BP Plc sold  North Sea  Forties crude
at a lower price than its last offer. Petraco Oil Co. sought to
buy Russian Urals blend in northwest  Europe  without success.  Angola,  Africa â€™s second-largest oil producer, will reduce
its crude exports in November to 52 cargoes, five less than next
month, according to a preliminary loading program obtained by
Bloomberg.  North Sea  BP sold Forties lot F1001 for Oct. 3 to Oct. 5 loading to
Phibro, a unit of Occidental Petroleum Corp., at 5 cents a
barrel more than Dated Brent, according to a Bloomberg survey of
traders and brokers monitoring the Platts trading window. The
London-based company last offered a cargo at a premium of 16
cents on Sept. 12.  Reported crude trading typically occurs during the Platts
window, which ends at 4:30 p.m.  London  time. Before the session,
Forties loading in 10 to 25 days was 7 cents less than Dated
Brent, unchanged from Sept. 14, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Brent for November settlement traded at $116.23 a barrel on
the ICE Futures Europe exchange in London at the close of the
window, down from $116.96 on Sept. 14. The December contract was
$115.69, a discount of 54 cents to November.  Three Forties cargoes for loading in September were delayed
by five to six days, bringing the total number of deferrals this
month to five, three people with knowledge of the shipping
schedule said.  Consignment F0908 was postponed by six days and will now be
exported on Sept. 27 to Sept. 29, while lot F00907 will load on
Sept. 24 to Sept. 26, also six days later than scheduled, said
the people, declining to be identified because the information
is confidential.  Cargo F0909 was pushed back by five days to load on Sept.
29 to Oct. 1, they said. A total of three cargoes for loading in
September were advanced, with one added and five deferred.  Mediterranean/Urals  Petraco failed to buy 100,000 tons of Urals crude for
loading on Oct. 3 to Oct. 7 at $1.85 a barrel less than Dated
Brent, unchanged from the price for the last trade on Sept. 13,
the survey showed.  There were no bids or offers for the blend in the
Mediterranean. Urals was at $1.38 a barrel less than Dated Brent
for delivery in the Mediterranean, unchanged from the previous
session, data compiled by Bloomberg showed.  West Africa  Angola  plans to ship 50 million barrels, or 1.67 million
barrels a day, in November, the plan showed. This compares with
1.77 million in October.  Qua Iboe was unchanged at $1.61 a barrel more than Dated
Brent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
