August 2012 was the fourth-warmest
August globally since 1880 and the 330th consecutive month in
which temperatures worldwide were above the 20th-century average,
the  U.S. National Climatic Data Center  said.  The average temperature on land and over the ocean was 61.2
degrees Fahrenheit (16.2 Celsius), 1.1 degree above the
century’s average,  the agency said today .  “Most areas of the world experienced higher-than-average
monthly temperatures, including far northeastern  North America ,
central and Southern Europe, and east-central  Asia ,” the agency
said. “In the Arctic, sea ice extent averaged 1.82 million
square miles, resulting in the all-time lowest August sea ice
extent on record.”  The last time the global temperature was below the 20th
century’s average was February 1985, and the last time there was
a cooler-than-average August was 1976, said the agency, part of
the  National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration . In the
Arctic, the six smallest amounts of sea ice have been recorded
in the past six years.  Melting in the Arctic is expected to continue through the
middle of September.  In the Antarctic, sea ice during August was 1.6 percent
about average, the fourth most extensive level for the month in
the 34 years since records have been kept, the agency said.  It’s currently winter in the Southern Hemisphere.  To contact the reporter on this story:
