The yen traded near its lowest
level in four months amid speculation that the  Bank of Japan (8301) 
will expand monetary stimulus to rein in the currency’s
strength.  The yen maintained a two-day slide versus the dollar that
pushed it down to a one-week low as a territorial dispute
between  Japan  and  China  escalated. Demand for the 17-nation euro
was limited before data today forecast to show German investor
confidence hovered near its lowest level this year.  “A lack of additional monetary easing could risk a
stronger yen,” said  Daisaku Ueno , a senior foreign-exchange and
fixed-income strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley
Securities Co. in  Tokyo , a unit of Japan’s biggest listed bank.
He says the Bank of Japan will probably increase its asset-
purchase program by about 5 trillion yen ($64 billion).  The yen traded at 103.16 per euro as of 8:43 a.m. in Tokyo
from 103.24 at the close yesterday, when it fell to 103.86, the
weakest level since May 9. Japan’s currency was little changed
at 78.72 per dollar, after yesterday touching 78.93, the lowest
since Sept. 7. The euro fetched $1.3105 from $1.3117.  Five of 21 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News predict
the BOJ will ease policy at a meeting ending tomorrow, with
sixteen expecting a move by October.  The bank increased a fund to buy assets such as government
debt by 5 trillion yen to 45 trillion yen in July, and has kept
its target for overnight lending between zero and 0.1 percent
since October 2010.  In  Germany , the ZEW Center for European Economic Research
is forecast to say its  index of investor and analyst
expectations , which aims to predict economic developments six
months in advance, was at minus 20 in September, according to a
 Bloomberg News  survey of economists. The gauge slid to minus
25.5 last month, the lowest this year.  -- Editors: Benjamin Purvis, Jonathan Annells  To contact the reporter on this story:
