ArcelorMittal (MT) , the world’s biggest
steelmaker, will resume coke production at its plant in
Monessen, Pennsylvania, by May 2014 to reduce the company’s
purchases of the raw material.  ArcelorMittal (MT)  will spend $50 million to restart the plant,
which has been idled since May 2009, the Luxembourg-based
company said in a statement today. The company expects to employ
180 workers at the factory, which can produce 370,000 tons of
coke a year. Coke is produced from metallurgical coal and used
for steelmaking.  To contact the reporter on this story:
