ThyssenKrupp AG (TKA)  and  Salzgitter AG (SZGG) ,
Germany’s biggest steelmakers, fell after a downgrade by UBS AG
and concerns that overcapacity will hurt the European industry.  ThyssenKrupp dropped as much as 4.2 percent, the steepest
slide since Aug. 2, as UBS AG said expectations for the benefits
from the sale of the company’s Steel Americas unit are too high.  “The market got overexcited by a potential Steel Americas
disposal,” Carsten Riek, a UBS analyst, wrote in an e-mailed
note, cutting ThyssenKrupp to “sell” from “neutral.”  European steel companies have seen margins squeezed as the
region’s economic woes curb demand from the car, appliance and
building industries, weighing on prices. Austria’s  Voestalpine
AG (VOE)  reported a 34 percent decline in net income last month, and
 ArcelorMittal (MT)  posted a 28 percent drop in earnings in July.  ThyssenKrupp’s Head of Steel Edwin Eichler and Salzgitter
Chief Executive Officer Heinz Joerg Fuhrmann wrote in a letter
that they disagree with Voestalpine CEO Wolfgang Eder, who said
steel capacity in  Europe  is as much as 60 million metric tons
more than supply, the Financial Times Deutschland said today.  Eder, also head of the Eurofer lobby, earlier called for a
European-wide restructuring plan to reduce excess capacity.  ThyssenKrupp fell 2.9 percent to 17.96 euros by 10:16 a.m.
in  Frankfurt . Salzgitter declined 2.1 percent to 34.28 euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
