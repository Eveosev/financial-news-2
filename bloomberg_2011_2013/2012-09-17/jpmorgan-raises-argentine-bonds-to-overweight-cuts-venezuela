JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  raised
Argentine bonds to overweight from marketweight, saying debt
prices already reflect investor concern about  capital controls 
and nationalizations and that economic growth could quicken.  “Argentina’s economy has touched bottom and is in the
process of benefiting from both a cyclical lift and a more
comfortable balance of payments position that should extend into
2013,” Vladimir Werning, a JPMorgan economist in New York,
wrote in a report.  While government intervention “will continue to generate
headline risk,” it is already reflected in asset prices,
Werning said.  The government is scheduled to release second-quarter
growth figures on Sept. 21. The economy probably expanded 0.5
percent in the quarter from the year-earlier period, according
to the median forecast from 10 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  While raising Argentine debt to overweight, JPMorgan cut
 Venezuela  to marketweight after a four-month rally in the
securities.  The extra yield investors demand to own Argentine
government dollar debt over U.S. Treasuries fell 24 basis points
to 846 basis points at 6:20 p.m. in  Buenos Aires  while
Venezuela’s bond spread rose 10 basis points to 956 basis
points, according to JPMorgan’s EMBIG index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
