Syrian rebels have tortured
detainees and committed extra-judicial or summary executions in
Aleppo, Latakia and Idlib that may amount to war crimes,  Human
Rights Watch  said.  Opposition forces have executed more than a dozen people,
including four after a rebel battalion stormed a police station
in Haffa in June, the New York-based group said in an e-mailed
statement today. Six of 12 detainees held in two opposition
detention facilities said they were tortured, in particularly by
prolonged beating of the soles of their feet, the group said.  Syrian rebels have been fighting to topple the government
of President Bashar Al-Assad for 18 months, in a conflict that
has killed more than 26,000 people, according to the U.K.-based
Syrian Observatory for  Human Rights . Government forces and
opposition fighters are resorting to increasingly violent
tactics to tip the balance of power in their favor.  “Declarations by opposition groups that they want to
respect human rights are important, but the real test is how
opposition forces behave,” said  Nadim Houry , deputy  Middle East 
director at Human Rights Watch. “Time and again Syria’s
opposition has told us that it is fighting against the
government because of its abhorrent human rights violations. Now
is the time for the opposition to show that they really mean
what they say.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
