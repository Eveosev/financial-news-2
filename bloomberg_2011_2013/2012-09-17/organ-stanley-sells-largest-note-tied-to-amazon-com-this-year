Morgan Stanley (MS)  sold $16.2 million
of one year auto-callable notes tied to  Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) , the
biggest offering linked to the world’s largest Internet retailer
since December.  The securities, issued Sept. 12, pay 3.588 percent each
quarter that the company’s stock is at least 75 percent of its
initial price, according to a  prospectus  filed with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission. They are automatically
redeemed if the shares are higher than or equal to the starting
value. The bank distributed the notes for a 1.5 percent fee.  On Dec. 15, HSBC Bank Plc sold through its U.S. unit $19
million of one-year securities tied to the Seattle-based company
that pay 10 percent annually, with an additional 7.65 percent if
the stock gains at least 10 percent, according to a  prospectus 
filed with the SEC. Since the note’s issuance, the company’s
shares have climbed about 43 percent, while the value of the
security has increased 9.7 percent, according to Trace, the
bond-price reporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority.  Earlier this month, the online goods seller unveiled new e-
readers, including a Kindle Fire with an 8.9-inch screen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
