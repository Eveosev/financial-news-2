Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. (TCS) ,
India’s largest software exporter, led the nation’s technology
companies lower on concern the rupee’s gain to a four-month
record will reduce the value of their earnings.  Tata Consultancy fell 5 percent to 1,342.10 rupees, the
most since May 8, at the close in Mumbai trading.  Infosys Ltd. (INFO) 
declined 2.6 percent to 2,564.50 rupees, the most since July 16,
and shares of  Wipro Ltd. (WPRO)  fell 1.7 percent to 384.80 rupees. The
benchmark Sensitive Index climbed 0.4 percent.  The rupee, Asia’s worst performing currency in the past six
months, rose after the government allowed overseas retailers to
invest in Asia’s third-largest economy and said foreign airlines
can own minority stakes in local carriers. A stronger local
currency hurts exporters because it reduces the value of
repatriated earnings.  “The IT companies have gained a lot from the depreciation
of the rupee recently,” said Ankita Somani, an analyst at Angel
Broking Ltd. in Mumbai. “Now they’re going to lose some of that
with all these reforms that have come in, strengthening the
rupee.”  The rupee touched 53.6550 today, the strongest level since
May 15.  Tata Consultancy derived 91.4 percent of its revenue from
outside India in the year ended March 31, according to its
annual report. Infosys got 97.8 percent of its revenue from
overseas India in the year ended March 31, the company said.  Every 1 percent movement in the  Indian rupee  against the
 U.S. dollar  has an  impact  of about 50 basis points on Infosys’s
operating margin, the company said in its annual report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
