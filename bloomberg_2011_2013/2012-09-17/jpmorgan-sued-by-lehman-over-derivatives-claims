JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) , which has
been fighting defunct Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. over about
$6 billion of claims for payment, was sued by Lehman over
$2.2 billion in derivatives obligations, according to a
bankruptcy court filing in Manhattan.  Lehman is asking a judge to rule on the “overstated”
demands by the bank, which was the main short-term lender to
Lehman around the time of its 2008 collapse.  Previously, Lehman sued JPMorgan over $8.6 billion in
collateral that it wants back. The latest suit was filed Sept.
