Iran is set to open the largest oil
desalination plant in the  Middle East  in the next Iranian year,
an industry official told state  Press TV .  The desalination plant near the Asmari oil field in the
southwestern city of Ahvaz will be able to process 220,000
barrels a day of crude oil, Mohsen Dahanzadeh, managing director
of Karun Oil and Gas Production Co. said, according to the
report. Iranâ€™s new calendar year starts on March 21.  The plant will ensure production of high-quality oil and
prevent possible cuts in output when existing desalination
plants in the region undergo maintenance, Dahanzadeh said. Some
40 percent of the construction has been completed, he said.  Karun Oil and Gas is a subsidiary of the National Iranian
South Oil Co., which is in charge of producing and processing
crude from Ahvaz, Mansouri, Ramin and Ab-Teymur oil fields,
according to the report.  Iran  is one of the main producers in
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
