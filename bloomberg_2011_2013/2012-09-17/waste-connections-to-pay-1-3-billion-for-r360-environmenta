Waste Connections Inc. (WCN)  agreed to
buy subsidiaries of R360 Environmental Solutions Inc for about
$1.3 billion, adding oilfield waste-treatment services in the
Permian, Bakken and Eagle Ford.  The transaction is expected to increase Waste Connection’s
earnings by boosting profit from treating, recovery and disposal
services for oil and natural-gas producers, the company said in
a statement today.  “Through acquisitions and new facility development, R360
has created leading positions in key basins, providing closed
loop oilfield waste services within an increasingly stringent
regulatory environment,” Ronald J. Mittelstaedt, chairman and
chief executive officer of Waste Connections, said in the
statement. “This acquisition represents a natural extension of
our existing E&P disposal activities.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
