Colombia ’s peso fell from a one-
month high as growing concern over the  European debt crisis  cut
into demand for higher-yielding, emerging-market assets.  The peso slipped 0.2 percent to 1,797.64 per  U.S. dollar  at
9:07 a.m. in Bogota. It touched 1,786.43 on Sept. 14, the
strongest level since Aug. 8. Today’s decline pared the peso’s
gain this year to 7.8 percent.  “The peso is following declines in external markets,”
Daniel Escobar, the head analyst at Global Securities in Bogota,
said in a telephone interview. “We’re also seeing some dollar
purchases from companies.”  Global stocks declined as European Union finance ministers
failed to agree on a timetable for a more unified banking sector
and clashed over terms of bailout requests and the role of the
 European Central Bank  at a meeting Sept. 14 in Cyprus.  The yield on Colombia’s 10 percent peso-denominated debt
due in July 2024 was little changed at 6.56 percent, according
to the central bank. It fell to 6.5 percent on Sept. 13, the
lowest level on a closing basis since the securities were first
issued in 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
