Refined-sugar prices in  Colombia 
are down 17 percent this year, according to the Association of
Sugar Cane Growers of Colombia, known as Asocana.  The average price of a sack of sugar last month was 79,000
pesos ($43.92), compared with 95,000 pesos in December, the
association said today in an e-mailed statement, citing
Corabastos, the country’s network of wholesalers. Each sack
weighs 50 kilograms. Refined-sugar futures on NYSE Liffe in
London averaged $572.69 a metric ton last month, down from
$608.08 in December.  “The domestic sugar price, as with all products imported
without restrictions, is based on international prices,” Luis
Fernando Londoño Capurro, the president of Asocana, said in the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
