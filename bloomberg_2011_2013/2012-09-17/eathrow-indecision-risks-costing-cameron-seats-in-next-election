London Mayor  Boris Johnson  attacked
Prime Minister  David Cameron ’s aviation policy as “lamentable”
and said his government must speed up its review into airport
capacity or face “economic catastrophe.”  Johnson said the commission led by  Howard Davies , which was
set up by Cameron to put off a decision on the expansion of
London’s Heathrow Airport until after the 2015 election, must
report by the end of 2013. The mayor, who opposes the building
of additional runways at Heathrow, reiterated his backing for a
hub airport in the Thames estuary.  “The government program to address the looming aviation
capacity crunch in the U.K. is far too slow and I am hugely
concerned that their intended timetable sets a course for
economic catastrophe,” Johnson said in a speech in central
 London  today.  “I will continue to work with the government and the
Davies Commission, but the urgency of the situation and the
lamentable attention that the government has paid to this
pressing issue has forced me to accelerate the work that I will
do to develop a credible solution,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
