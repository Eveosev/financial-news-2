British singer Sarah Brightman may
join a tourist flight to the International  Space Station ,  RIA
Novosti  reported, citing an industry official it didnâ€™t
identify.  Brightman, the former wife of Phantom of the Opera composer
 Andrew Lloyd Webber , may sign a contract at the end of October
or early November, the Russian news service said.  The space station may start accepting tourists from the
Soyuz spacecraft after the Russian Federal Space Agency agrees
on a new schedule for sending astronauts into space with
international partners, according to RIA Novosti.  To contact the reporter on this story:
