Russian coffee demand slowed in the
past decade and now accounts for about 5 percent of the global
market, according to the Moscow-based  Rusteacoffee Association .  World demand is estimated at 137.1 million bags for 2012,
said Ramaz Chanturiya, head of the industry lobby group that
includes Russian coffee and tea producers. Russian consumption
rose minimally in the past 10 years after 10 percent to 15
percent growth in the 1990s, he said at the Third Moscow
International Coffee Forum today.  Instant coffee is poised to become a budget product in
 Russia  in five to seven years as demand for that variety of the
beverage weakens, Chanturiya said. Instant coffee accounted for
69 percent of total national consumption last year, down 3
percentage points from 2010, he said.  Global coffee demand is set to expand 2 percent to 3
percent a year, led by  Southeast Asia , and may reach 172.2
million bags by 2021, according to Rusteacoffee. World supply is
seen at 131.6 million bags this year, Chanturiya said. Each bag
weighs 60 kilograms (132 pounds).  To contact the reporter on this story:
