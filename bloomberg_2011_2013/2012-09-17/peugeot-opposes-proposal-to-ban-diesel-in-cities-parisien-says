PSA Peugeot Citroen (UG)  opposes banning
diesel-fueled cars in cities, an idea socialist deputy Jean-
Marie Le Guen broached at an environmental conference last week,
Le Parisien said, citing Guillaume Faury, the carmakerâ€™s
development chief.  The average car in  France  is 8.5 years old, and a better
solution would be seeking measures to get older cars out of
circulation, as those are the ones that pollute most, Faury was
quoted as telling the newspaper.  To contact the reporters on this story:
