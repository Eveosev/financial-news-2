A halt in Libya’s oil output would
probably cause prices to soar because OPEC’s spare production
capacity is limited to about 2 million barrels a day, the head
of the U.S. Energy Information Administration said.  Unexpected outages in countries including Sudan, Syria,
Yemen and Brazil have reduced output from oil producers outside
of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, EIA head
 Adam Sieminski  said at a conference in  Rio de Janeiro  today.  A stoppage of production in Libya “would probably create a
spike in  oil prices ,” Sieminski said.  Violence in the Middle East, including a Sept. 11 attack in
Libya that killed the U.S. ambassador and three colleagues
contributed to oil price gains last week. The attacks on U.S.
and other diplomatic missions in Libya, Egypt, Tunisia, Sudan
and Yemen over the past few days were largely sparked by a film
denigrating Islam’s prophet.  Oil declined the most in eight weeks after dropping $2.67 a
barrel in 6 minutes during the last 30 minutes of floor trading.  Crude for October delivery fell $2.38, or 2.4 percent, to
settle at $96.62 a barrel on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange.
The price fell to $94.65 at 2:09 p.m. from $97.32 at 2:03 p.m.
on a surge in volume. The daily decline was the largest since
July 23.  To contact the reporter on this story:
