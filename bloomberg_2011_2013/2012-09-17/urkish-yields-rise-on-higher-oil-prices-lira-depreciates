Turkish bond  yields  climbed as oil
increased and bondholders boosted expectations for inflation
before a central bank rate meeting tomorrow.  Yields on two-year benchmark debt advanced 10 basis points
or 0.10 percentage point, to 7.33 percent at the 5 p.m. close in
Istanbul, the biggest increase since Sept. 12. The yield on lira
bonds due in January 2022 rose nine basis points to 8.30 percent
today, the highest level since Aug. 22.  Crude gained for a third day on concern that tension in the
 Middle East  will disrupt supplies.  Turkey  imports more than 98
percent of the oil it consumes. Bondholders lifted their
inflation  projections  to 6.4 percent today, the highest level in
more than three months, based on the extra yield on fixed-rate
lira bonds over notes paying returns tied to consumer prices.  “We see selling in 10-year bonds,” Ugur Kucuk, a fixed-
income strategist at Is Investment Securities in Istanbul, said
in e-mailed comments. Inflation expectations in the medium term
are rising, he said.  The lira fell less than 0.1 percent to 1.7969 per dollar,
paring this month’s increase to 1.2 percent, the lowest gain
among emerging markets in  Europe ,  Africa  and the Middle East.  Turkey’s benchmark two-year yield has fallen 368 basis
points this year, the biggest decline among  emerging markets .  The central bank cut the  average cost for lenders  to 6.17
percent on Sept. 14, the lowest since November, as it lent at
its minimum policy rate since June 4. That compares with a high
of 11.93 percent on Jan. 6. The bank in Ankara provides funding
to Turkish lenders at rates between 5.75 percent and 11.5
percent in daily repurchase agreement auctions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
