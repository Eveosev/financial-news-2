Vietnam ’s government bonds fell,
pushing the five-year yield to the highest level in almost two
months, on concern inflation will quicken. The dong was steady.  Consumer prices will probably increase 5.75 percent in
September from a year earlier, Saigon Securities wrote in a
research note today. Inflation was 5.04 percent in August,
official data show, and the full-year rate will be 6 percent,
Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung said on Sept. 13.  “Prices in Vietnam will climb due to the impact of
commodity prices in the international market,” said Hoang Nu
Ngoc Thuy, an analyst at Bank for Investment & Development of
Vietnam in  Hanoi .  The yield on the five-year notes gained nine basis points,
or 0.09 percentage point, to 9.96 percent, the highest level
since July 19, according to a daily fixing from banks compiled
by Bloomberg.  The dong traded at 20,855 per dollar as of 4:43 p.m. in
Hanoi, compared with 20,850 on Sept. 14, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The  State Bank  of Vietnam set the
currency’s reference rate at 20,828, unchanged since Dec. 26,
according to its website. The dong is allowed to trade as much
as 1 percent on either side of the rate.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
