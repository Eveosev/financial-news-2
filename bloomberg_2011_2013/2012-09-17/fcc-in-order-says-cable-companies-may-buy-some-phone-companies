Cable providers may buy telephone
companies that serve customers in their franchise areas, the
Federal Communications Commission said in  an order  published
today.  The agency granted a request from the  National Cable &
Telecommunications Association , a Washington-based trade group
with members including the largest U.S. cable provider,  Comcast
Corp. (CMCSA) , and No. 2 Time Warner Cable Inc.  The order concerned so-called competitive local exchange
carriers, a class of companies that includes  Cbeyond Inc. (CBEY)  and  TW
Telecom Inc. (TWTC) , and doesn’t include the largest U.S. telephone
providers  AT&T Inc. (T)  and Verizon Communications Inc.  The deals would still be subject to FCC review, and they
could help cable companies move into business services, David Kaut, a Washington-based analyst for Stifel Nicolaus & Co., said
in a Sept. 7 note.  “We commend the commission for removing outdated obstacles
that have historically deterred pro-competitive transactions
between cable operators and competitive local phone companies,”
 Michael Powell , president of the Washington-based trade group,
said in an e-mailed statement.  Commissioner Robert McDowell, a Republican, in a statement
called the ruling “the right public policy outcome.”  “Consumers will benefit from the increased efficiencies
springing from strategic combinations between cable companies
and competitive local telecom companies,” McDowell said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
