Russian  industrial production 
expanded less than forecast in August as the pace of
manufacturing growth slowed.  Output at factories, mines and utilities rose 2.1 percent
from a year earlier, compared with a 3.4 percent advance the
previous month, the Moscow-based Federal Statistics Service said
today in an e-mailed statement. That’s less than the 3.1 percent
median forecast in a Bloomberg  survey  of 13 economists.
Production fell 0.2 percent from July.  The world’s largest energy exporter forecasts economic
expansion will slow to 3.5 percent this year from 4.3 percent in
2011 as drought damages crops, growth eases in  China , its
largest single trading partner, and Europe grapples with a debt
crisis. The  International Monetary Fund  said today it may
downgrade  Russia ’s 2012 and 2013 growth forecasts.  “The industrial production slowdown is based on a range of
fundamental factors, such as weakness in export demand and
slowing domestic investment demand,” Vladimir Osakovskiy, chief
economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch in Moscow, said by
phone before the release.  The  Micex (INDEXCF)  Index of 30 stocks advanced 0.1 percent to
1,536.56 as of 3:07 p.m. in Moscow. A close at that level would
be the highest since April 3. The ruble weakened 0.5 percent to
30.6381 per dollar.  Manufacturing growth slowed to 4.1 percent from a year
earlier in August, down from 5.7 percent the previous month, the
service said. Production at mines grew 0.8 percent and output at
utilities rose 0.2 percent, both weaker than in July.  Russian fixed capital investment growth slowed to 3.8
percent from a year earlier in July, the weakest level in 15
months, the statistics service said last month.  To contact the reporters on this story:
