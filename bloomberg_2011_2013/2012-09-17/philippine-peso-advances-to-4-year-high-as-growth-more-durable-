The Philippine peso fell the most
in a month as some investors deemed recent gains excessive.
 Government bonds  declined.  The currency retreated from a four-year high reached today
after advancing by the most in almost a year on Sept. 14. The
 Federal Reserve  said the day before it will expand its holdings
of long-term securities with open-ended purchases of $40 billion
of mortgage debt a month in a third round of quantitative easing.
The dollar’s 14-day relative strength index against the peso
touched 33 on Sept. 14, near the 30 level that indicates to some
traders that a dollar rebound is likely.  “It’s more profit-taking” by traders that’s driving the
peso lower, said Joey Cuyegkeng, an economist at ING Groep NV in
 Manila . “Markets have already priced in a strong balance-of-
payments surplus report for August, which comes out this week.”  The peso weakened 0.5 percent to 41.600 per dollar in
Manila, the most since Aug. 15, according to Tullett Prebon Plc.
The currency touched 41.358 earlier, the strongest level since
April 1, 2008. It advanced 0.9 percent on Sept. 14, the most
since Sept. 28, 2011. The peso has risen 5.3 percent this year,
the second-best performance among  Asia ’s 11 most-active
currencies.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate
swings used to price options, declined 25 basis points to 5
percent.  Remittances, the largest source of foreign exchange after
exports, increased 5.4 percent in July from a year earlier, the
biggest increase since February, the central bank reported today.
International reserves climbed $1 billion to a record $80.8
billion at the end of August, official data showed on Sept. 7.  Central bank Governor Amando Tetangco said in a speech in
Manila today the nation’s economic growth was ‘broad-based’ and
‘more durable’ despite the global slowdown.  The yield on the government’s 4.75 percent bonds due
September 2022 rose two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point,
to 4.72 percent, according to prices from Tradition Financial
Services.  To contact the reporter on this story:
