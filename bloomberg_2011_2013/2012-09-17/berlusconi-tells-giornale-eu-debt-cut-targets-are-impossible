Former Italian Prime Minister
 Silvio Berlusconi  said debt-reduction targets required by the
European Union are unrealistic and urged tax cuts to boost
economic growth, according to an interview with newspaper Il
Giornale.  “Italy should reduce its debt by 40 billion euros ($52
billion) to 50 billion euros each year, which is absolutely
impossible,” Berlusconi, citing EU rules, told Il Giornale, a
newspaper owned by Berlusconi family.  Berlusconi said if he were to lead the next government, he
would retract Prime Minister  Mario Monti ’s property tax on
primary residences, according to Giornale.  To contact the reporter on this story:
