LDK Solar Co. (LDK) , the second-biggest
maker of wafers used to convert sunlight to power, reported a
wider second-quarter loss as output costs rose and prices fell.  The net loss was $254.3 million, compared with a loss of
$87.7 million a year earlier, the Jiangxi, China-based company
said in a statement. Sales tumbled 53 percent to $235.4 million.  Solar-wafer demand dropped after Chinese producers flooded
the market and economies slowed. Operating losses at LDK and a
weakening export outlook have dragged its stock down 70 percent
this year in U.S. trading. The company’s credit rating was cut
one level to A by Shanghai Brilliance Credit Rating & Investors
Service Co. on Sept. 3, its second downgrade since June.  LDK shipped 316.7 megawatts of wafers and 135.6 megawatts
of cells and modules in the quarter. It produced 538.1 metric
tons of polysilicon, the main raw material used in solar cells.
 GCL-Poly Energy Holdings Ltd. (3800)  is the world’s biggest maker of
polysilicon and solar wafers.  LDK recorded impairment losses of $30.5 million on
property, plant and equipment sales in the period, and ended the
quarter with $296.2 million in cash and cash equivalents, and
$523.4 million in short-term pledged bank deposits, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
