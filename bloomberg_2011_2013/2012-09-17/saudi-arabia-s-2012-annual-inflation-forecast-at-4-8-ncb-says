Saudi Arabia ’s average annual
inflation is forecast to slow to 4.8 percent this year and 4.5
percent next year,  National Commercial Bank  said in an e-mailed
report.  “The liquid state of the economy suggests that prices
should remain somewhat contained without raising concerns for
policy makers,” the Jeddah-based bank said yesterday. Average
inflation last year was 5 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Inflationary pressures in the kingdom, the Arab world’s
largest economy, are expected to stabilize in the third quarter
as global increases in food costs slow and inflation eases in
other countries, the  Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency  said in a
report on its website last month. Inflation in August slowed to
3.8 percent from 4 percent in July, the lowest level in almost
three years, as food and beverages and housing, fuel and water
costs eased, the Central Department of Statistics said Sept. 12.  Saudi Arabia’s economy grew 7.1 percent last year, buoyed
by higher  oil prices  and a government spending spree aimed at
preventing the kind of political unrest that has spread across
most Arab countries. The kingdom’s economy expanded 5.5 percent
in the second quarter from a year earlier, the slowest pace
since at least 2010, as oil prices declined, the statistics
department said on Sept. 13  To contact the reporter on this story:
