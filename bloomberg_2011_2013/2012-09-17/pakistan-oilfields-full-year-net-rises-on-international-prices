Pakistan Oilfields Ltd. (POL) , the
nation’s third-biggest energy explorer, said full-year profit
rose 10 percent because of higher global  oil prices .  Net income climbed to 11.9 billion rupees ($126 million),
or 50.11 rupees a share, in the 12 months ended June 30 from
10.8 billion rupees, or 45.72 rupees a share, a year earlier,
the Rawalpindi-based company said in a filing today. Sales rose
13.7 percent to 30.8 billion rupees.  Pakistan Oilfields benefited from an 18.5 percent increase
in the average price of Arab Light crude in the period from a
year earlier, said Naveed Vakil, head of research at AKD
Securities in Karachi, who has a buy recommendation on the stock.
The company increased oil production by 2 percent to 4,637
barrels per day and gas production by 1 percent to 87.3 million
cubic feet a day, he said.  “These flat increases were because of delays in bringing
new discoveries into the system, plus slippages in the current
production as well,” Vakil said. “We expect production levels
to be better since these slippages and delays will be
addressed.”  Pakistan Oilfields rose as much as 3.2 percent to 433.60
rupees in Karachi  trading . The shares have advanced 24 percent
this year, compared with a 39 percent gain in the benchmark
KSE100 index.  The company plans to pay a cash dividend of 35 rupees a
share, according to the filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
