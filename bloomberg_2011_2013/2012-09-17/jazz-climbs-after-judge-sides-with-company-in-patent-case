Jazz Pharmaceuticals Plc (JAZZ)  climbed to
its highest value ever after winning a federal judge’s support
in a patent dispute over its best-selling medicine Xyrem to
treat narcolepsy.  Jazz increased 15 percent to $55.29 at 4 p.m. New York
time. The Dublin-based company rose to its highest price since
the shares began trading in June 2007.  U.S. District Judge Esther Salas sided with Jazz on the
interpretation of most disputed terms in eight patents in its
suit against Roxane Laboratories Inc.,  Corey Davis , an analyst
for Jefferies & Co., wrote in a note today. In patent cases, the
judge’s interpretation of disputed terms forms the baseline for
all legal arguments that follow.  “At first blush this seems like a clear win for Jazz,”
wrote Davis, who is based in New York.  The case was filed in November 2010 in federal court in
Newark,  New Jersey . The two sides argued over how to interpret
the patents in April. No date has been set for further
proceedings based on the judge’s ruling, Bill Craumer, a company
spokesman, said.  Jazz asked the  Food and Drug Administration  in July to
rescind Roxane’s application for a generic version of Xyrem. The
drug brought in $233 million last year, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
