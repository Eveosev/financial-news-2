The oldest-ever bottle of Bowmore whisky released by the distiller will go on sale in Edinburgh next month for a minimum of 100,000 pounds ($162,000), a price that would be a record for a Scotch.  The Bowmore 1957 is 54 years old and was bottled in 2011 and only 12 bottles are in existence, Bowmore said in an e- mailed statement today. The auction will take place at Bonhams in the Scottish capital on Oct. 10, with a second bottle on sale in New York two weeks later, the company said. The net proceeds will go to five Scottish charities, it said.  A bottle of 55-year-old Glenfiddich malt whisky produced to honor the oldest living Scot  sold at auction  on Dec. 14 in Edinburgh for a record 46,850 pounds. The whisky, which was put into casks in 1955, had a guide price of between 30,000 and 35,000 pounds and all the proceeds from the sale were donated to Water Aid. Bidding started at 22,000 pounds.  Bowmore was founded in 1779 on Islay off  Scotland â€™s west coast. Whiskies from the island, also including Lagavulin and Laphroaig, are known for their peaty smokiness.
