Slovenian banks, including Nova
Ljubljanska Banka d.d. and  Nova Kreditna Banka (KBMR)  Maribor, are
solvent though the situation is deteriorating, central bank
Governor Marko Kranjec said.  “Slovenian banks are solvent but the situation is
worsening because companies are less and less able to repay
loans,” Kranjec, who’s also a member of the Governing Council
of the  European Central Bank , said today in an interview with
the public broadcaster Radio Slovenija, reiterating his view
from a week ago. “And Slovenian banks are liquid.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
