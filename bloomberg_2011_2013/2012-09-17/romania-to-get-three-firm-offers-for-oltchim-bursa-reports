Romania’s Economy Ministry will
probably receive three firm offers from investors interested in
acquiring a majority stake in  Oltchim SA (OLT) , Bursa reported, citing
Remus Vulpescu, who heads the ministry’s office responsible for
industrial-asset sales.  The ministry, which plans to hold an auction for the
Oltchim sale tomorrow, has already received offers for the
chemical company, Vulpescu told Bursa, without providing more
details. A bidding deadline expires today at noon in Bucharest.  Vulpescu also said a share sale in Oltchim may be
endangered by a law suit initiated by media owner Dan Diaconescu
that challenges a plan to sell company debt to the state
together with the share package, according to Bursa.  To contact the reporter on this story:
