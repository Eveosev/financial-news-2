Mvelaphanda Group Ltd. (MVG)  slumped the
most since its 1996 stock listing as the South African
investment company spun off Times Media Group Ltd., which
started trading in Johannesburg today.  Mvelaphanda  shares  declined as much as 50 percent to 1.65
rand and were down 34 percent as of 11 a.m. in Johannesburg.
Times Media, which holds publication and entertainment assets
including Sunday Times weekly, Financial Mail magazine and
Summit TV business-news channel, traded at 11.50 rand.  Mvelaphanda was given approval by  Avusa Ltd. (AVU)  shareholders
last month to buy the shares it doesn’t already own in the
publisher of  South Africa ’s biggest Sunday newspaper. Times
Media is the holding company that owns Avusa’s stock.  To contact the reporter on this story:
