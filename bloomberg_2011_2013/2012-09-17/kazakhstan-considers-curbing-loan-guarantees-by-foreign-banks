Kazakhstan ’s central bank may
restrict foreign banks from providing guarantees used by their
units in the country to underwrite loans because that gives them
an advantage over local lenders.  “This question is under discussion,” central bank Deputy
Chairman Daniyar Akishev said in interview today in the
financial capital, Almaty. “We want the conditions to be equal
for everyone.”  The central bank “reckons” foreign banks should inject
capital instead of providing guarantees, said Akishev, adding
that overseas lenders say this may boost lending costs in
Kazakhstan. He declined to say when a decision would be made.  UniCredit SpA (UCG)  signed a guarantee agreement with its ATF
Bank unit in December 2009, which underwrites corporate loans of
$2.8 billion, ATF Bank said on its  website  last month. Under
this guarantee that could run until April 2029, loan losses of
more than $728 million are guaranteed by Italy’s biggest bank.  UniCredit declines to comment on political debates in
Kazakhstan, said Tiemon Kiesenhofer, a Vienna-based bank
spokesman. ATF Bank didn’t reply to an e-mail seeking comment.  ATF Bank and its subsidiaries recognized cumulative loan
losses and an associated right to compensation from UniCredit of
$597 million under the guarantee agreement as of June 30.
UniCredit paid $2.12 billion for control of ATF Bank in 2007.  To contact the reporter on this story:
