The European Union, the 27-nation
bloc locked in a trade dispute with  China  over solar-panel
sales, backed a call from German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  for
talks to resolve the impasse.  The European Commission, the EU’s trade authority in
Brussels, supports plans for a “political dialogue,” Merkel
said today in Berlin after speaking with EC President  Jose Manuel Barroso . No EU state would refuse such talks if they’re
“substantial” and “open,” she said.  The EU this month threatened to impose tariffs on panels
from China, saying European competitors may be victims of unfair
price undercutting. Companies such as Bonn-based  Solarworld AG (SWV) ,
emboldened by similar U.S. measures against China this year, are
seeking to bolster their defenses as growing Asian competition
squeezes profit margins.  Chinese wind-energy and solar companies including Suntech
Power Holdings Co. have grabbed market share from EU rivals that
once dominated the industry. The increased competition cut panel
prices by half last year, tipping at least a dozen companies
into bankruptcy.  Merkel said in August she was seeking talks to prevent the
opening of anti-dumping proceedings in  Europe . China, in turn,
called for dialogue to safeguard economic and trade ties, the
Xinhua News Agency reported Sept. 15. Europe accounts for about
three-quarters of the global photovoltaic market.  The U.S. has proposed anti-dumping duties ranging from 31
percent to 250 percent on Chinese solar manufacturers after the
Commerce Department in May ruled they sold products below cost.  To contact the reporter on this story:
