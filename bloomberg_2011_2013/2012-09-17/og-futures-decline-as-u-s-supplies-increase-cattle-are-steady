Hog futures fell for the first time
in four sessions as U.S. farmers sent more animals to slaughter
after livestock-feed costs jumped. Cattle were little changed.  About 2.43 million hogs were slaughtered last week, up 18
percent from a week earlier, U.S. Department of Agriculture data
show. The most-severe drought in the U.S. since 1956 drove up
the price of corn, the main ingredient in  animal feed , by 55
percent from mid-June to Sept. 14.  “We have a huge number of slaughter hogs coming to market
as farmers are trying to get them off the farm and not feed them
anymore,” Paul Beere, a grain and livestock adviser at Prime
Agricultural Consultants in Brookfield,  Wisconsin , said in a
telephone interview.  Hog futures for December settlement dropped 0.6 percent to
73.45 cents a pound at 10:07 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange. The price rose 3.5 percent in the previous three
sessions, partly on signs the demand for U.S. pork exports may
increase.  Cattle futures for December delivery fell less than 0.1
percent to $1.29875 a pound on the CME.  Feeder-cattle futures for October settlement rose 0.8
percent to $1.4785 a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
