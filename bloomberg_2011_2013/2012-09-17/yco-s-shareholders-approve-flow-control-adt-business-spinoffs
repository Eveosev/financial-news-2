Tyco International Ltd. (TYC) 
shareholders have approved the spinoffs of its flow-control
business and ADT North America home security operations.  The flow-control products and services business, which
sells industrial valves, expects to formally merge with  Pentair
Inc. (PNR)  on Sept. 28 to shareholders of record today and be renamed
Pentair Ltd., Tyco said. It also said quarterly guidance for the
flow control business remain unchanged.  The deal for the merger was announced March 28. Tyco shares
have risen 19 percent this year while Pentair’s have surged 27
percent. On Sept. 14, Pentair shareholders approved the merger
of the water filtration company and Tyco’s flow control
operations. Completion of the deal values the flow unit at about
$4.9 billion including debt.  The new company in which Schaffhausen, Switzerland-based
Tyco’s shareholders hold 52.5 percent of Minneapolis-based
Pentair will be the world’s largest flow, filtration and
equipment-protection company, said Pentair Chief Executive
Officer Randall Hogan, who will lead the combined business.  To contact the reporter on this story:
