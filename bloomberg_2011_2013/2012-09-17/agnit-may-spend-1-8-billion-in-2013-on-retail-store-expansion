OAO Magnit (MGNT) ,  Russia ’s largest food
retailer by market value, may open more stores than previously
intended in 2012 after reviewing summer revenue figures and said
it plans as much as $1.8 billion in  capital spending  next year.  Magnit will probably spend $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion to
open as many as 1,555 outlets this year, the retailer said today
in a statement. That’s more than the $1.4 billion top end of a
target the company reiterated in a  presentation  last month.
Magnit said it boosted spending plans after analyzing results
for July through the first half of September.  Billionaire Sergey Galitskiy’s retailer may open a net
1,000 convenience stores this year versus previous guidance of
800 stores, while the target for new cosmetics outlets was
reduced to 500 from 550, the company said. Magnit said it plans
to open 50 to 55 hypermarkets and Magnit Family stores in 2012,
with as many as 60 next year. Capital expenditure in 2013 may be
$1.6 billion to $1.8 billion.  “The company became more optimistic on  convenience stores ,
sales growth and margin on earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization,” said Mikhail Terentiev, an
 analyst  at Otkritie Capital in Moscow.  Sales may rise 30 to 32 percent this year, with an Ebitda
margin of 9 percent to 9.5 percent, Magnit said today. The
company had previously told analysts that sales would rise as
much as 30 percent, with a margin of 8.5 percent to 9 percent,
according to Terentiev.  Next year, the retailer plans to open a net 800 to 1,000
convenience stores, 55 to 60 hypermarkets and 500 cosmetics
stores, according to the statement. The company said it may
update its 2013 guidance in October or November after releasing
third-quarter results.  Magnit had 5,309 stores at the end of last year, it said
last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
