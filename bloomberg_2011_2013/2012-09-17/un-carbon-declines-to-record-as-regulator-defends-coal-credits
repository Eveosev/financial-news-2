United Nations emission credits
dropped to a record as the regulator defended allowing supplies
of offsets from more-efficient coal plants in emerging nations.  Certified Emission Reduction credits for December fell 8.9
percent to close at 1.53 euros ($2.01) a metric ton on the ICE
Futures Europe exchange in London, an all-time low.  The Clean Development Mechanism Executive Board on Sept. 13
approved a  revised set of rules  governing how many emission
credits more-efficient new natural gas- and coal-powered plants
are eligible to receive in emerging and developing nations. The
conclusion on the so-called methodology will boost supply and
cause prices to fall, Eva Filzmoser, director of CDM Watch, an
environmental lobby group in Brussels, said at the time.  “The revision that the board just approved in Bangkok
makes the methodology much more stringent and addresses the
concerns” cited by the board’s technical panel, David Abbass, a
spokesman for the Bonn-based CDM board, said today by e-mail.  The rules were originally put in place in September 2007 to
encourage emerging nations to invest in efficient coal and
natural gas plants, Abbass said today by phone.  “It makes sense that fossil fuels are used as efficiently
as possible,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
