Kazakhstan  doesn’t plan to inject
money into state-owned  BTA Bank (BTAS) , which has defaulted on its debt
twice in three years, Deputy Prime Minister Kairat Kelimbetov
said.  Speaking in a Sept. 15 interview in Ukraine’s Black Sea
city of Yalta, where he attended the Yalta European Conference,
Kelimbetov wouldn’t elaborate on the government’s plans for the
lender.  BTA, Kazakhstan’s third-largest bank by assets, said last
month that an Almaty court had prolonged a restructuring
deadline by three months to Dec. 20. BTA had been seeking an
agreement by September after failing to make a January interest
payment on dollar bonds due July 2018.  Sovereign-wealth fund Samruk-Kazyna took BTA over in
February 2009, two months before the nation’s largest lender at
the time defaulted on $12 billion of debt. The government holds
an 81.5 percent stake in BTA, which won 92 percent creditor
approval for a restructuring plan in May 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
