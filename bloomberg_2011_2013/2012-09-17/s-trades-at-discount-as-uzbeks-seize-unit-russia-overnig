OAO Mobile TeleSystems (MBT) , Russia’s
biggest mobile phone company, sank in  New York  to trade at a
discount to competitor VimpelCom Ltd. for the first time in two
years after Uzbekistan moved to seize its subsidiary.  The phone company, known as MTS, tumbled 3.6 percent to
$18.48 in New York yesterday, sending valuations to 11.57 times
earnings, below the 11.52 multiple for VimpelCom for the first
time since May 2010. The  Bloomberg Russia-US Equity Index (RUS14BN)  of the
most-traded Russian companies in New York halted a four-day
rally as  futures  expiring in December on the dollar-denominated
RTS index lost 1.5 percent to 155,020 in New York yesterday.  The criminal court in Tashkent, Uzbekistan, said the state
can nationalize Uzdunrobita, the mobile phone company owned by
MTS, the Russian company said in a statement yesterday. Uzbek
authorities earlier froze $700 million of the unit’s cash and
property, according to the statement. MTS lost its license in
 Turkmenistan  in 2010 before restarting operations in the central
Asian country last month.  “The events in Uzbekistan just serve to remind investors
of the higher risk and cost of doing business for foreign listed
companies operating in central  Asia ,” Simon Mandel, the
director of emerging Europe equity sales at Auerbach Grayson &
Co. in New York, said by e-mail yesterday. “Another risk for
MTS could come from additional charges such as retroactive tax
claims or fines by the Uzbek government.”  The  Market Vectors Russia ETF (RSX) , the biggest U.S.-traded
exchange-traded fund that holds Russian shares, fell 2.1 percent
to $30.33. The RTS Volatility Index retreated 0.2 percent to
31.20.  License Frozen  American depositary receipts of MTS plunged the most since
June 21 in New York yesterday.  The stock  fell 2.3 percent to
236.62 rubles in Moscow, or the equivalent of $7.73. One ADR is
equal to two ordinary shares.  The mobile phone provider has invested $1.5 billion in
Uzbekistan since 2004 and wrote off $579 million in Uzbekistan-
related assets in the second quarter. The company had its
license frozen by local authorities on July 17, following
accusations the local subsidiary violated its permit and didn’t
pay enough taxes.  “MTS reserves the right to use all legal options,
primarily in the international arena, and initiate proceedings
against officials involved in illegal actions against the
company,” the company said in an e-mailed statement yesterday.  VimpelCom  VimpelCom (VIP) , the world’s sixth-biggest mobile phone company,
dropped 1 percent to $11.83 yesterday.  The commpany’s subsidiary  Orascom Telecom Holding SAE (ORTE)  is
disputing the $1.3 billion fine imposed by an Algerian court
against its Djezzy unit for allegedly violating foreign-exchange
regulations, according to an April 12 statement. Algeria has
sought control of Djezzy since 2010, freezing money transfers
and bank accounts and asking the unit to pay back-dated taxes.  “With MTS trading at cheaper valuations than VimpelCom we
still see the company as an attractive option on telecom growth
in the CIS region, especially given Vimpelcom’s troubled Middle
East exposure and Algeria overhang,” Mandel said.  OAO Sberbank, Eastern Europe’s biggest lender, fell 2.1
percent to $12.42, the most since July 30. The  stock  declined
1.4 percent to 95.68 rubles, or $3.13 in Moscow yesterday.  ‘More Selling’  Russia ’s central bank is selling 7.6 percent of OAO
Sberbank for at least 156 billion rubles, or $5.1 billion. Bank
Rossii is offering the equivalent of 1.71 billion shares in
ordinary and global depositary stock at a range of 91 rubles to
the market price at the time the order book closes, the central
bank and Sberbank said in a statement yesterday.  MD Medical Group Investments Plc , Russia’s largest private
chain of maternity centers, is seeking to raise at least $150
million through an initial public offering in  London , the
company said yesterday in a statement.  The  Federal Reserve ’s open-ended asset purchase program
last week followed the  European Central Bank ’s Sept. 6
announcement of an unlimited bond-buying program to combat the
region’s debt crisis.  “There will be more selling as in the presence of QE3 and
a fund purchasing mechanism in Europe equity investors will look
to buy Russia,” Ian Hague, the founding partner at Firebird,
which manages $1.3 billion, said in a phone interview from New
York yesterday. “People who were holding back will be getting
in now as Russia is among the cheapest and most liquid BRIC
markets.”  Oil Slumps  Russia’s 30-stock, ruble-denominated  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  sank 0.3
percent to 1,530.36 yesterday. The Micex trades at 5.86 times
analysts’ earnings estimates for member companies. That compares
with a valuation of 13.75 for companies on  Brazil ’s Bovespa
index, a ratio of 9.53 for the Shanghai Composite Index and
14.66 for the BSE India Sensitive Index.  Oil, Russia’s major export, dropped the most in eight weeks
in New York yesterday as crude options for the October futures
expired.  Oil for October delivery tumbled 2.4 percent to $96.62 a
barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the largest decline
since July 23. The futures expire on Sept. 20. Prices are down
2.2 percent this year.  Brent for November settlement sank 2.5 percent to $113.79 a
barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. Urals
crude, Russia’s major export oil blend, dropped 3.3 percent to
$111.18 yesterday, losing the most since June 21.  United Co. Rusal (486) , the world’s largest aluminum producer,
dropped 0.2 percent to HK$4.66 in Hong Kong trading as of 11:05
a.m. local time. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index gained 0.1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
