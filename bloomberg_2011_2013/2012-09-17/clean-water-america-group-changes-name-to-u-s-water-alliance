The Clean Water America Alliance
has changed its name to the U.S. Water Alliance and formed a new
water management network.  “Hello, my name is U.S. Water Alliance,” the Washington,
D.C.-based organization, which started four years ago, said in a
website statement.  “We’re changing our name but not our game,” Alliance
President Ben Grumbles said.  “The alliance’s mission -– uniting
people and policy for ‘one water’ sustainability --remains the
same. Our new name is easier to remember and more closely
aligned with the integrated ‘one water’ vision we’re working
toward in watersheds and communities across the U.S.”  The 14 groups making up OWM, or the one water management
network, include American Rivers, National Association of Water
Companies, The Pacific Institute, U.S. Water Alliance and the
Western Coalition of Arid States, the alliance said last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
