Slovenia won’t need an
international bailout if the government adopts and carries out
the measures it’s announced, central bank Governor Marko Kranjec
said.  “If the government enacts all the stabilization measures
it has announced, the  credit rating  would then be improved and
therefore there would not be a need for Slovenia to ask for
financial assistance,” Kranjec said today in an interview with
public broadcaster Radio Slovenija.  Prime Minister  Janez Jansa ’s government is working on a
plan to recapitalize the country’s banks and overhaul the labor
market and pensions system. Economists have said Slovenia may
become the next euro-region nation to ask for a bailout to prop
up its banking industry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
