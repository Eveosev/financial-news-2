Croatia’s government said it is
canceling collective contracts stipulating benefits for public
workers to the year-end after negotiations with unions broke
down over cuts proposed by the Cabinet.  “The basic collective contract for officials and employees
in the public sector is being canceled,” the government said in
a statement on its website. The decision will take effect three
months from today, it added.  Prime Minister  Zoran Milanovic  said in January the
government will trim costs by 4 billion kuna ($710 million) to
narrow the 2012  budget deficit  to 2.9 percent of economic output
from 4.2 percent in 2011.  Fitch Ratings  on Sept. 5 revised
Croatia’s outlook to stable from negative, citing progress in
sticking to budget targets.  The  World Bank , Fitch and other credit-rating companies
have urged the government to press on with a reduction in the
size of the bloated public sector and revamp collective
contracts that give vast benefits to public workers.  The Adriatic Sea nation, which is struggling to revive its
economy after three years of recession or stagnation, is set to
join the European Union in July 2013.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story: Jasmina
