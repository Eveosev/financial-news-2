Tropical Storm Nadine, the 14th
named system of the  Atlantic hurricane season  that runs through
November, has turned east-northeastward and away from the U.S.
and Caribbean.  Nadine was 675 miles (1,085 kilometers) southwest of the
Azores with winds of 70 miles per hour, the Miami-based National
Hurricane Center said in a 5 a.m. Atlantic time  advisory .  Tropical Depression Kristy off  Mexico â€™s Pacific coast is
forecast to become a remnant low today. The system was 630 miles
west-northwest of southern  Baja California  with winds of 35 mph.  Further west,  Lane  strengthened to a Category 1 hurricane
on the five-step Saffir-Simpson scale, according to the NHC. It
is 1,160 miles west-southwest of the tip of Baja, moving north-
northwest and posing no threat to land.  To contact the reporter on this story:
