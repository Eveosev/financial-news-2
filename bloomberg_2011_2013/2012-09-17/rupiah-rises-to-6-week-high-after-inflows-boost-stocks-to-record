Indonesia ’s rupiah climbed to a
six-week high on signs capital inflows into local assets are
increasing after the  Federal Reserve  unveiled a third round of
debt purchases, a policy that boosts the supply of dollars.  The  Jakarta Composite (JCI)  Index of shares surged to a record on
Sept. 14 as foreign investors bought $221 million more local
stocks than they sold last week, exchange data show. Global
funds added 3.43 trillion rupiah ($363 million) to government
 debt holdings  last week through Sept. 13, government figures
show. The Fed announced last week it will start buying $40
billion a month of mortgage debt to support the  U.S. economy .  The rupiah strengthened 0.6 percent to 9,453 per dollar as
of 9:15 a.m. in Jakarta, the strongest level since Aug. 7,
prices from local banks compiled by Bloomberg show. The currency
reached 9,609 on Sept. 13, the weakest level since May. One-
month implied volatility, which measures exchange-rate swings
used to price options, held at 5 percent.  “The rupiah can reach as high as 9,400 today as investors
hunt for high-yielding currencies on renewed risk appetite,”
said Nurul Eti Nurbaeti, the Jakarta-based head of treasury
research at PT Bank Negara Indonesia. “This optimism will
remain until the end of the month, lending support for the
rupiah at 9,500.”  The yield on the government’s 7 percent notes due May 2022
dropped 13 basis points last week, or 0.13 percentage point, to
5.86 percent on Sept. 14, the lowest level since Aug. 10, prices
from the Inter Dealer Market Association show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
