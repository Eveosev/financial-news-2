Cooler-than-normal weather will
probably give way to seasonal temperatures in the U.S. Northeast
as September comes to a close, said  Matt Rogers , president of
Commodity Weather Group LLC.  Temperatures may be 3 to 5 degrees Fahrenheit (1.7 to 2.8
Celsius) below normal from Sept. 22 to Sept. 26 in the Midwest
before becoming more seasonal Sept. 27 to Oct. 1, said Rogers,
based in Bethesda,  Maryland .  “The big blocking features that are responsible for the
current series of cool pushed into the Midwest, East and South
in mid-late September are showing signs of movement now,”
Rogers said in a note to clients.  Temperature fluctuations outside normal levels have little
impact on energy markets at this time of year because they are
still close to ideal conditions for comfort. However, if October
were to start cool, that could boost natural gas demand for
heating.  The average low temperature in  New York City  on Sept. 18 is
65 degrees, which is also the benchmark used to calculate
heating and cooling degree days. That’s the temperature at which
energy isn’t supposed to be needed to either warm or cool.  The normal average temperature in New York on Sept. 21 is
68 degrees, or 10 degrees less than in July, according to MDA
EarthSat Weather in Gaithersburg, Maryland. The normal average
is 64 in Boston, 70 in Washington, 72 in Atlanta, 63 in Chicago,
78 in Houston, 60 in Seattle and 72 in  Burbank , California.  To contact the reporter on this story:
