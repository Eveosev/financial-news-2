An Egyptian soldier who was
severely injured in clashes between militants and government
forces in north Sinai has died, the North Sinai Security
Directorate said in an e-mailed statement late yesterday.  Unidentified militants renewed an attack on an Egyptian
security headquarters in north Sinai yesterday, wounding six
conscripts, while gunmen opened fire on a vehicle belonging to
the Multinational Force and Observers.  The attack on the security headquarters in the peninsula
was the latest after  Egypt  carried out an operation in the area
to root out militants following an August attack that left 16
Egyptian border guards dead.  To contact the reporter on this story:
