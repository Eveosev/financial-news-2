Ethanol fell to the lowest level
since July as corn, the main ingredient used to produce the fuel
additive, fell the most since May.  Futures slipped to the lowest level since July 2 as corn
sank as much as 4.4 percent. Ethanol supplies rose to a six-week
high in the week ended Sept. 7, Energy Department data show.  “Corn is off pretty hard and ethanol is tracking it pretty
closely,” said  Chris Wilson , an analyst at Atten Babler Risk
Management LLC in Galena,  Illinois . Crush margins are still
under intense pressure with a return in production, he said.  Denatured ethanol for October delivery fell 8.8 cents, or
3.6 percent, the most since Jan. 12, to $2.344 a gallon at 1:31
p.m. on the Chicago Board of Trade.  In cash market trading, ethanol fell 7.5 cents to $2.415 a
gallon in  New York , 7 cents to $2.345 in Chicago, 8 cents to
$2.405 in the U.S. Gulf and 5.5 cents to $2.515 on the West
Coast, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Corn for December delivery fell 27.75 cents, or 3.6
percent, to $7.5425 a bushel in  Chicago . One bushel makes at
least 2.75 gallons of ethanol.  Ethanol producers have wrestled with negative margins to
manufacture the fuel in the face of higher corn costs as the
worst U.S. drought in more than 50 years parched crops in the
grain-rich Midwest.  To contact the reporter on this story:
