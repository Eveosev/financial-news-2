AT&T Inc. (T) , the largest U.S. phone
company, said customers ordered a record number of the  Apple
Inc. (AAPL)  iPhone 5.  AT&T subscribers ordered more of the new smartphone model
than any previous iPhone both on its first day of preorders and
during the weekend, the carrier said in a statement today,
without providing details.  Apple  shares  rose to a record on Sept. 14 after the
company said orders for the iPhone 5 from its online store won’t
be shipped for two weeks, fueling speculation the new model had
sold out. The iPhone 5 is still available for preorder at AT&T’s
 website  and will be sold in its retail stores beginning Sept. 21
at 8 a.m. local time, AT&T said in the statement today.  AT&T, the first carrier in the world to sell the iPhone in
2007, said Oct. 20 it had activated more than 1 million iPhone
4S handsets, which it described then as the most successful
start for sales of any iPhone model.  AT&T said it has the nation’s largest fourth-generation
wireless network, covering 275 million people.  The iPhone is Apple’s  best-selling product , making up about
two-thirds of profit. The company’s entry into the smartphone
market in 2007 has resulted in sales of 244 million iPhone units
and helped Apple become the most valuable company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
