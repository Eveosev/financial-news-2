Spanish  government bonds  declined,
pushing the two-year yield to the highest since Sept. 6, after
European Union finance ministers meeting in Cyprus failed to
agree on the timetable for a more unified banking system.  The  two-year  rate rose as much as 13 basis points to 3.26
percent, and was at 3.22 percent as of 7:51 a.m. London time.  Spanish 10-year bond yields rose six basis points to 5.85
percent, the highest since Sept. 7, while the rate on similar-
maturity Italian debt climbed five basis points to 5.07 percent.  The yield on two-year Italian debt rose seven basis points
to 2.34 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
