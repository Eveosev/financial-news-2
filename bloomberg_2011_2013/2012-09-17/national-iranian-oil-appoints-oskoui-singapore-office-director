National Iranian Oil Co.  has
appointed Morteza Oskoui as the managing director of its
Singapore office, replacing Ghassem Mohsenian, according to
three people with direct knowledge of the move.  Oskoui was previously in the crude-marketing department at
the state oil producer’s Tehran headquarters, the people said,
asking not to be identified because they aren’t authorized to
speak to the media.  Oskoui began work in the company’s Singapore office in
August, one of the people said.  A spokesman for NIOC couldn’t be reached by phone today and
an e-mail seeking comment was unanswered.  To contact the reporter on this story:
