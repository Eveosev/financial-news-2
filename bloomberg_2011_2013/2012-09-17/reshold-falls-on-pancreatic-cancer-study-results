Threshold Pharmaceuticals Inc. (THLD) 
tumbled the most in almost three years after its experimental
pancreatic cancer drug didn’t significantly improve patients’
overall chance of survival.  Threshold fell 20 percent to $7 at 4 p.m.  New York  time, in
its biggest drop since November 2009. The shares of the South
 San Francisco , California-based company had increased more than
five-fold in the 12 months through yesterday.  Patients treated with Threshold’s TH-302 plus chemotherapy
had a median survival of 9.2 months compared with 6.9 months for
those treated with only chemotherapy in the second of what are
typically three phases of clinical studies needed for regulatory
approval, Threshold said in a statement today. The trial wasn’t
designed to detect a statistically significant improvement in
overall survival, the company said.  “We are pleased with the overall consistency of results
from this study demonstrating activity of TH-302 and, as a
consequence, a randomized Phase 3 trial of TH-302 in patients
with advanced first-line pancreatic cancer is planned to be
initiated together with our partner  Merck KGaA (MRK) ,” Barry Selick,
chief executive officer of Threshold, said in the statement.  The study met its primary goal in demonstrating a 63
percent improvement in progression-free survival for patients
treated with TH-302 plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone,
Threshold said in February.  Threshold plans to present the secondary overall survival
results at the European Society for Medical Oncology 2012
Congress that starts this month in Vienna.  To contact the reporter on this story:
