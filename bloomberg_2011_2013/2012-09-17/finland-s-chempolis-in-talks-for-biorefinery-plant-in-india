Finland’s Chempolis Ltd. is in
talks with Indian sugar companies to set up a biorefinery in the
South Asia nation.  The Oulu-based company, which provides technology that
allows raw materials like sugar-cane pulp, bamboo and straw to
be converted into biofuels, expects to finalize a deal by the
second quarter of next year, the company said in an e-mailed
response to questions.  A biorefinery in  India  would probably be based on bagasse,
a pulpy waste left over after juice is extracted from sugar
cane, Chempolis said. It declined to identify the sugar
companies with whom it’s negotiating.  Such projects typically cost as much as 40 million euros
($52 million), it said. They produce 15,000 tons to 30,000 tons
of ethanol a year and take 18 months to 24 months to build, it
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
