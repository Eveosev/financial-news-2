The  Internal Revenue Service  said
Prince Rogers Nelson, known as the recording artist Prince,
failed to comply with a summons issued on behalf of French tax
authorities.  The IRS asked the pop singer to appear in response to a
request from its French counterpart “to examine the French
income tax liability of Mr. Prince Rogers Nelson for tax years
2009 and 2010,” according to the documents filed yesterday in
federal court in  Minneapolis .  Nelson hasn’t responded, the IRS said. The petition asks
the court to enforce the summons. A hearing on the matter is
scheduled for Oct. 18 before U.S. District Judge David S. Doty.  The French government lodged its request in July 2011 in a
letter listing several concerts it believed Prince had played in
 France  during the two years at question and asking for
additional documentation about the relationship between the
artist and the production and recording company Paisley Park
Enterprises.  Peter Gleekel, an attorney who has represented Prince,
didn’t immediately respond to a phone call seeking comment on
the summons. A second attorney, Traci Bransford, couldn’t be
reached because her phone was disconnected.  Dan Applegate, an IRS lawyer, declined to comment.  The case is U.S.A. v. Nelson, 12-mc-00071, U.S. District
Court, District of Minnesota (Minneapolis).  To contact the reporter on this story:
