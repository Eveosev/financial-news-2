A U.K. lawmaker that wants the
country out of the European Union lost an appeal of fines
imposed by the region’s assembly after he compared President
 Herman Van Rompuy  to a damp rag.  Nigel Farage, a member of the EU Parliament from the  U.K.
Independence Party  that seeks the country’s withdrawal from the
27-nation bloc, was punished for a 2010 speech in which he said
the former Belgian prime minister had “all the charisma of a
damp rag and the appearance of a low-grade bank clerk.”  Van
Rompuy  was present for the speech in parliament’s chamber.  Farage lost his challenge at the EU’s General Court that
sought to overturn a penalty of 2,980 euros ($3,900), according
to a  court order  dated Sept. 5 and published today.  The case is: T564/11 Nigel Paul Farage v European
Parliament and Jerzy Buzek.  To contact the reporter on this story:
