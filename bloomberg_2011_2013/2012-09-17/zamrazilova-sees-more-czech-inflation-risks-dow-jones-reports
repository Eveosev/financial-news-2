Czech policy maker  Eva Zamrazilova 
sees prevailing pro-inflationary risks and they have been
confirmed by the new quantitative easing in the U.S., Dow Jones
Newswires reported, citing an interview.  Zamrazilova was against the quarter-point interest-rate cut
in June that brought the benchmark two-week repurchase rate to a
record-low 0.5 percent. She has sought interest-rate increases
in two out of five monetary-policy meetings this year and voted
for no change at the last session.  To contact the reporter on this story:
