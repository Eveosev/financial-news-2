Groupon Inc. (GRPN) , operator of the
biggest daily-deals website, fell the most in more than a month
on concern that marketing costs are rising amid waning consumer
interest in online coupons.  Shares of Chicago-based Groupon dropped 9.9 percent to
$4.75 at the close in New York, the biggest decline since Aug.
14. The  stock  has tumbled 77 percent this year.  As the discount service expands marketing efforts and gains
a greater portion of revenue from Groupon Goods, an e-commerce
site for marked-down products, “we see overall margin expansion
and cash flow growth as tenuous,” said Ken Sena, an analyst at
 Evercore Partners Inc. (EVR) , in a research report. He recommends
selling shares and has a $3 price estimate.  “Marketing expenses are on the rise given daily-deal
fatigue,” Sena wrote.  Paul Taaffe , a spokesman for Groupon,
declined to comment on the note.  The company makes money by selling discounts -- known as
Groupons -- from businesses such as restaurants and nail salons.
It then splits the revenue with the retailers. Last month,
Groupon reported second-quarter revenue that missed estimates
because of economic weakness in  Europe .  Groupon Goods made up most of the company’s $65.4 million
in direct revenue, which more than tripled from $19.2 million in
the first quarter, the company said last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
