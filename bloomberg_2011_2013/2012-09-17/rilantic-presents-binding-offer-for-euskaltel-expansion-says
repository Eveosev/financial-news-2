Trilantic  Capital Partners  has
presented the only binding offer to buy as much as a 45 percent
stake in cable company Euskaltel SA,  Expansion  reported, without
citing anyone.  The whole of Euskaltel may be valued at 600 million euros
($788 million) to 700 million euros, below an original valuation
1 billion euros, the newspaper said. Other private equity funds
including The  Carlyle Group LP (CG)  and Apax Partners LLP lost their
interest in the deal, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
