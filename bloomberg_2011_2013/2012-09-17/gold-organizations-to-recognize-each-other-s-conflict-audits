The London Bullion Market
Association and organizations from the jewelry and other
manufacturing industries will recognize each other’s audit
programs to halt the use of so-called conflict gold.  The  LBMA , Responsible Jewellery Council and the Conflict
Free Smelter Program use third party audits of gold refiners to
help companies use conflict-free metal. The cross-recognition
will mean more efficient audits for refiners and the bullion
industry, the organizations said in a statement e-mailed today.  U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission commissioners voted
3-2 on Aug. 22 to adopt a so-called conflict minerals rule
requiring companies to make reasonable efforts to trace sources
of tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold in their products and a
deeper search if the metals may have come from mines that have
helped fund armed groups in the  Democratic Republic  of Congo.  About 4 metric tons of conflict gold is mined each year in
the DRC, according to the LBMA, which cited United Nations
estimates. Global production will be 2,652 tons this year,
Barclays Plc estimates. The 63 LBMA good delivery gold refiners
account for about 85 to 90 percent of global bullion production.  The Conflict Free Smelter Program was developed by the
Global e-Sustainability Initiative and the Electronic Industry
Citizenship Coalition.  To contact the reporter for this story:
