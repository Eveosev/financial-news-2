BowLeven Plc (BLVN) , the U.K. oil explorer
that’s focused on Cameroon, will start searching for oil in
 Kenya  after buying a 50 percent stake in an onshore exploration
block from Adamantine Energy Ltd.  BowLeven will fund two years of exploration at an estimated
cost of $10 million in Block 11b extending over 14,000 square
kilometers (5,400 square miles) in northwest Kenya, where U.K.
explorer  Tullow Oil Plc (TLW)  made the country’s first oil discovery
earlier this year, according to a statement today.  “This new acreage affords the company exposure to an
exciting new hydrocarbon province for a minimal capital
commitment,” BowLeven Chief Executive Officer Kevin Hart said
in the statement.  The block covers the Loeli, Lotikipi, Gatome and South
Gatome basins, north of the Lokichar basin where Tullow’s
Ngamia-1 well found oil in March this year. Geological analysis
suggests the basins are similar to Lokichar, BowLeven said.  “The two companies have complementary technical and
operational skill sets and we can draw upon the outstanding
track record of BowLeven’s technical team in Cameroon,”
Adamantine Energy’s CEO Chris Matchette-Downes said.  BowLeven will provide technical support to Adamantine
Energy and the initial exploration program will include an
airborne geophysical survey and the acquisition of 2D seismic,
the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
