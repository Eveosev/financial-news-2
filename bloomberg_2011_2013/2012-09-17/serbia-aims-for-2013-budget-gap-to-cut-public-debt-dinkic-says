Serbia will try to achieve a budget
gap of 3.5 percent of economic output next year instead of a
tentatively planned 4 percent, in an effort to reign in public
debt and avoid bankruptcy, Finance Minister  Mladjan Dinkic  told
 B92  broadcaster yesterday.  All subsidies except for agriculture will be reduced and
the state will spend less on public procurements, Dinkic said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
