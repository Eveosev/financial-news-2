The ruble retreated for the first
time in almost two weeks, paring its biggest rally since 2010,
as investors bet the currency’s gains were overdone.  The Russian currency lost 0.4 percent to 30.5900 per dollar
at 7 p.m. in Moscow. It slid 0.3 percent versus the euro at
40.1950 and 0.3 percent against the central bank’s target euro-
dollar basket.  The ruble’s slide snapped a nine-day winning streak. The
U.S. Federal Reserve said Sept. 13 it will purchase $40 billion
of mortgage debt a month and hold the federal funds rate near
zero through mid-2015, spurring appetite for riskier emerging-
market assets. That followed an earlier promise of unlimited
bond-purchases by the  European Central Bank .  “As the ruble lost potential for further strengthening,
some investors chose to buy back the foreign currency,” Alexey
Egorov, an analyst at Nomos Bank in Moscow, said by e-mail.  Non-deliverable forwards showed the ruble at 31.0275 per
dollar in three months compared with 30.7197 on Sept. 14.  The ruble’s rally last week was helped by speculation the
currency would strengthen as investors bought rubles to buy the
stock of OAO Sberbank,  Russia ’s biggest lender, which announced
its share sale today, Sergey Fishgoyt, deputy head of foreign
exchange at Otkritie Financial Corp., said by e-mail.  At the same time, most of the shares will be sold abroad,
Fishgoyt said. “There will be no need to snap up rubles for
that,” he said.  $5.1 Billion  Bank Rossii is offering the equivalent of 1.71 billion
shares in ordinary and global depositary stock at a range of 91
rubles to the market price at the time the order book closes,
the central bank and Sberbank said in a statement today. A sale
at the low end of the range would raise 156 billion rubles ($5.1
billion). Sberbank’s shares closed at 96.99 rubles on Sept. 14.  The extra yield investors demand to own Russia’s dollar
bonds over  U.S. Treasuries  rose 6 basis points to 191, according
to JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s EMBI Global Index. An index of five-
year government bond yields compiled by the Micex was up 3 basis
points at 7.552 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
