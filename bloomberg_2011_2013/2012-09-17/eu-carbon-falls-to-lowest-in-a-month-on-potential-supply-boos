European Union carbon permits
dropped to their lowest in more than a month after the regulator
said it would finish an upgrade of the market’s registry system
by Oct. 2, allowing a supply boost.  EU allowances for December decreased as much as 2.6 percent
to 7.26 euros ($9.54) a metric ton on the ICE Futures Europe
exchange in  London , the lowest since Aug. 13, and were at 7.29
euros at 4:20 p.m. United Nations Certified Emission Reduction
credits for December dropped as much as 14 percent to a record
1.45 euros.  The upgraded registry will allow the start of a 1.1 billion
euro program of sales for the next phase of the world’s biggest
greenhouse gas market by traded volume, the commission  said
today  on its website. The period, known as Phase 3, runs from
2013 to 2020.  “Today’s announcement of the single registry timetable
could trigger selling” with prices declining as low as 6.80
euros a ton this week, Konrad Hanschmidt, an analyst in London
for Bloomberg New Energy Finance, said today in an e-mailed note
sent before the commission published its statement. Prices may
rise as high as 8 euros this week as the regulator separately
considers a temporary supply withdrawal, he said.  The upgraded registry will open at 8 a.m. Brussels time on
Oct. 2, the commission said. Operations of the current registry
will be suspended starting Sept. 27, allowing for the improved
software, the regulator said.  The upgraded registry will include so-called trusted
accounts that allow faster trading, the commission said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
