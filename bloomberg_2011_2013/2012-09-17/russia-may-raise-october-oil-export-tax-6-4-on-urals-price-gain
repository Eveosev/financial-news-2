Russia , the world’s biggest energy
exporter, may increase  duties  on most oil shipments abroad by
6.4 percent from Oct. 1, reaching the highest rate since June
after Urals crude prices rose.  The standard export duty is set to rise to $418.90 a metric
ton, or about $57.15 a barrel, from $393.80 a ton in September,
according to Bloomberg calculations based on data from the
 Finance Ministry .  The government is extending tax breaks for offshore and
hard-to-recover resources to stimulate output and meet President
 Vladimir Putin ’s goal of more than 10 million barrels a day for
at least a decade. Production climbed to a post-Soviet high of
10.38 million barrels a day in August, according to preliminary
data from the Energy Ministry.  The discounted rate on some eastern Siberian and Caspian
Sea grades will probably increase to $210.10 a ton from $191.30
this month. Extra-heavy crude is taxed at 10 percent of the
regular levy, or $41.80 in October.  Russia bases the export duties on the average Urals blend
price from the 15th day of one month to the 14th of the next.
The benchmark export grade averaged $113.98 a barrel during the
most recent period,  Alexander Sakovich , a Finance Ministry
adviser, said by phone today. In the previous monitoring period,
it averaged $108.25, according to the ministry.  Prime Minister  Dmitry Medvedev  must sign off on the levies
before they take effect.  The duty for middle distillates, such as diesel, and heavy
products, such as  fuel oil , may grow to $276.40 a ton next month
from $259.90 in September. A gasoline tax imposed from May 2011
to counter domestic shortages is likely to increase to $377 a
ton from $354.40 this month. That is 90 percent of the crude oil
duty.  The government may increase the duty on liquefied petroleum
gases such as butane and propane to $172.50 a ton in October
from $76.20 this month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
