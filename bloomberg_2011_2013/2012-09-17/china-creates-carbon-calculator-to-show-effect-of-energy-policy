China  is creating an online carbon
calculator to help power consumers gauge how the nation’s energy
choices affect its ability to cut pollution and ensure supply.  The calculator adapts a  British  website set up in 2010, the
U.K. Department of Energy and Climate Change said today.  The tool developed by China’s Energy Research Institute and
U.K. counterparts allows experts or ordinary users to study the
effect of building power plants or spurring efficiency on  energy
security  and greenhouse-gas emissions, it said in a statement.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
