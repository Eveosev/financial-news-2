Asian  stocks  fell as tensions
between Japan and China increased, pushing down shares of Tokyo-
listed companies from  Honda Motor Co. (7267)  to Fast Retailing Co. amid
signs of slowing growth in the U.S. and a worsening  European
debt crisis .  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the world’s largest mining company, slid
0.6 percent in Sydney as metal prices dropped. Fast Retailing,
Asia’s biggest apparel chain, tumbled 7 percent, in Tokyo as it
was forced to shut stores in China amid anti-Japanese protests.
Hokuriku Electric Power Co. surged 6.4 percent after a Japanese
government minister signaled he has no plans to stop
construction of nuclear reactors.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index lost 0.2 percent to 123.1 as of
7:15 p.m. in Tokyo, with about five stocks falling for every
four that rose. Gains among utilities limited losses on Japan’s
Nikkei 255 Stock Average as equity markets reopened today after
a public holiday.  “There is concern that anti-Japanese protests may reduce
investment into China in the mid- and long-term,” said Koji Toda, chief  fund manager  at Resona Bank Ltd. in Tokyo, which
oversees about 15 trillion yen ($191 billion). “The situation
is uncertain and we don’t know how long it will last.”  Honda,  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  and Nissan Motor Co. all reported
damage to dealerships in the eastern Chinese city of Qingdao as
protesters smashed store fronts and cars in demonstrations
sparked by Japan’s purchase last week of islands claimed by both
countries.  Annual Gain  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  rose more than 8 percent this
year through yesterday compared with a 16 percent gain on the
 S&P 500  and a 12 percent advance for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index
amid speculation central banks will step up measures to promote
global economic growth. The Asian benchmark traded at 12.8 times
estimated earnings compared with 14.1 for the S&P 500 and 12.2
for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  slid 0.4 percent and the
broader  Topix Index (TPX)  advanced 0.2 percent. South Korea’s Kospi
Index gained 0.1 percent and Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index fell
0.2 percent.  Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index slipped 0.3 percent and China’s
Shanghai Composite lost 0.9 percent. Singapore’s Straits Times
Index declined 0.4 percent and Taiwan’s  Taiex Index  slipped 0.4
percent.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index lost 0.3 percent
today. The index fell 0.3 percent in New York yesterday, when
the  Federal Reserve Bank of New York  said its general economic
index of manufacturing dropped to minus 10.41, the lowest
reading since April 2009, from minus 5.85 in August. Readings
less than zero signal contraction in the so-called Empire State
Index that covers New York, northern New Jersey and southern
Connecticut.  Spanish Aid  European Central Bank Governing Council member Luc Coene
said rising bond yields may force Spain into asking for aid and
submitting to the ECB’s conditions for granting it. Spanish bond
yields climbed past 6 percent yesterday for the first time since
Sept. 7, the day after ECB President  Mario Draghi  gave details
of the central bank’s new government bond purchase plan.  If “markets see that Spain will not” ask for assistance,
“then it will not last long before spreads will rise again, and
then Spain will be somewhat forced to come back on its decision
and submit to the conditionality program,” Coene said at a
panel discussion in London yesterday.  BHP Billiton  fell 0.6 percent to A$33.96 and Rio Tinto Ltd.
slid 0.4 percent to A$57.25 in Sydney after the London Metal
Exchange Index of industrial metals lost 0.8 percent yesterday.  Island Spat  Japanese companies that do business in China dropped as the
territorial dispute sparked the worst diplomatic crisis between
the two nations since 2005, putting at risk a trade relationship
that’s tripled in the past decade to more than $340 billion.  Honda slid 2.5 percent to 2,604 yen. Nissan, the biggest
Japanese automaker by sales in China, sank 5 percent to 701 yen.
 Fast Retailing (9983) , which had the biggest decline in the Asia-
Pacific index, slumped 7 percent to 17,480 yen after it
shuttered 42 Uniqlo shops in China.  Local partner to Honda and Toyota,  Gaungzhou Automobile
Group Co. (2238) , dropped 1.8 percent to HK$5.36. It fell 4.6 percent
yesterday.  Ajisen (China) Holdings Ltd., a Hong Kong-listed Ramen-
noodle restaurant-chain operator, slipped 0.8 percent to
HK$4.97. The company, whose shares fell 7.1 percent yesterday,
has been forced to close some stores after being targeted by
rioters, Haitong International Securities Co. analyst Gloria
Wang wrote in a note.  Nuclear Japan  Japanese utilities gained the most among 33 industry groups
on the Topix Index after the Nikkei newspaper reported Japanese
Trade Minister  Yukio Edano  signaled he has no plans to stop
construction of reactors that have already been approved,
despite a goal to scrap nuclear power by the end of the 2030s.  Hokuriku Electric soared 6.4 percent to 917 yen. Tohoku
Electric Power Co. jumped 4.3 percent to 535 yen.  Fortescue Metals Group Ltd. (FMG)  surged 17 percent to A$3.50
after Australia’s third-biggest iron-ore producer arranged $4.5
billion of new debt to refinance bank loans, easing concern the
Perth-based company may need to sell assets or stock to repay
debt.  Sony Corp. (6758) , Japan’s biggest exporter of consumer
electronics, gained 4.5 percent to 1,027 yen after public
broadcaster NHK reported on Sept. 14 the company will invest
about 50 billion yen ($636 million) in Olympus Corp. and set up
a company to manufacture medical equipment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
