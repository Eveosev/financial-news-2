D&D  London  Ltd., the restaurant
group that owns Coq d’Argent and about 30 other restaurants,
formed a joint venture with Borsa Restaurants and the Turkish
entrepreneur Mehmet Ali Yalcindag to open in Istanbul.  The venture has secured a 14,000-square-foot (1,300 square-
meter) site in Trump Towers and plans to open restaurants,
private dining rooms, event spaces and a bar early in 2013.  D&D, whose venues include Paternoster Chop House and Le
Pont de la Tour, said that earnings before interest, tax,
depreciation, amortization and one-time items rose 3 percent
from a year earlier to 6.7 million pounds ($10.9 million) in the
12 months ended March 31. Revenue from  London restaurants  open
at least a year increased by four percent.  “I am very optimistic about our prospects for the current
financial year and beyond,” Chairman and Chief Executive Des Gunewardena said today in an e-mailed statement. “Our new
joint-venture partnership in  Turkey  will mark another exciting
step.”  In recent weeks, D&D has added two new establishments
serving the City of London financial district:  South Place
Hotel , and  Old Bengal Warehouse , which consists of two
restaurants, a wine shop and a bar.  (Richard Vines is the chief food critic for Muse, the arts
