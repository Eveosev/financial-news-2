Chicago Mayor  Rahm Emanuel  filed an
injunction motion seeking a court order to immediately stop the
teachers union strike that has already forced the cancellation
of more than a week of school.  The strike, which began Sept. 10, continued today after
union delegates rejected the employment contract with the city
their leaders approved. Emanuel filed for an injunction today in
Cook County Circuit Court to get Chicago children back to class.  “I will not stand by while the children of Chicago are
played as pawns in an internal dispute within a union,”
Emanuel, 52, said in a statement yesterday. Emanuel said the
continued walkout is illegal because it’s over issues “that are
deemed by state law to be non-strikable.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
