Companies that advise retail
consumers on their investments face tougher bonus rules from the
European Union’s top markets regulator.  Bonuses for salespeople should “reflect the fair treatment
of clients” to reduce incentives for poor sales practices, the
European Securities and Markets Authority said in a consultation
paper on its website today. Firms should include factors such as
“compliance with regulatory requirements” when calculating
variable bonuses for staff, ESMA said.  “The presence of financial incentive schemes for sales
staff that do not take account of the clients’ best interests”
is a key factor behind the promotion of unsuitable products,
Steven Maijoor, chairman of Paris-based ESMA, said in an e-
mailed statement.  Payouts for managers at financial firms have been under
scrutiny from regulators and lawmakers since the fall of Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc. in 2008. Banks including Barclays Plc and
Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc said in June they would
compensate small and medium-sized businesses improperly sold
interest-rate derivatives following a probe by the U.K.
financial regulator.  To contact the reporter on this story:
