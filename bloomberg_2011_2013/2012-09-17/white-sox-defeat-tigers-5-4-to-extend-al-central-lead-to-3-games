The  Baltimore Orioles  pulled within
a half-game of the  New York Yankees  atop the American League
Eastern Division after a 10-4 rout of the  Seattle Mariners .  Nate McLouth and Matt Wieters hit home runs for the
Orioles, who opened a 7-1 lead after two innings last night at
Safeco Field in Seattle. They improved to 83-64 to narrow the
gap against the Yankees (83-63), who were off yesterday.  Baltimore is in Seattle again tonight, when the Yankees
open a three-game Major League Baseball series at home against
the Toronto Blue Jays.  The Chicago White Sox extended their margin atop the AL
Central to three games with a 5-4 win over the Detroit Tigers.  The White Sox scored the tying and go-ahead runs in the
fifth inning when Alex Rios broke up a double play with a hard
slide and caused an errant throw by Detroit second baseman Omar Infante.  The White Sox (80-66) and second-place Tigers (77-69) were
playing the makeup of a game that had been rained out last week
at U.S. Cellular Field in Chicago. Both teams have 16 regular-
season games left.  To contact the reporter on this story:
