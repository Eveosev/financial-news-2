Taiwan ’s dollar rose for a second
day, touching a four-month high, after the  Federal Reserve ’s
asset-purchase plan spurred demand for the island’s stocks.
 Government bonds  declined.  The currency has rallied 1 percent since Sept. 13, when the
Fed said it will start open-ended purchases of $40 billion of
mortgage debt per month, and hold  interest rates  near zero at
least through mid-2015. Global funds bought $66 million more
local stocks than they sold today, taking 2012 net purchases to
$1.5 billion, exchange data show. Taiwan’s dollar pared its
advance toward close of trading on speculation the central bank
sought to curb gains, according to two traders who asked not to
be identified.  “It looks like there’s a lot of speculative money coming
into Taiwan,” said Tarsicio Tong, a foreign-exchange trader at
 Union Bank of Taiwan (2838)  in Taipei. “The Taiwan dollar’s surge was
also caused by panic selling of the greenback” due to
speculation the local currency will strengthen beyond the NT$29
per dollar level, he said.  Taiwan’s dollar rose 0.2 percent to NT$29.399 against its
U.S. counterpart, according to Taipei Forex Inc. It touched
NT$29.198 earlier, the strongest level since May 3. One-month
non-deliverable forwards fell 0.1 percent to NT$29.298, a 0.1
percent premium to the spot rate, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  The central bank, which has kept its benchmark rate at
1.875 percent since June 2011, will meet to review borrowing
costs on Sept. 20.  The yield on Taiwan’s 1.125 percent notes due September
2022 climbed one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 1.203
percent, according to Gretai Securities Market. The  overnight
money-market rate  held at 0.386 percent, a weighted average
compiled by the Taiwan Interbank Money Center shows.  To contact the reporter on this story:
