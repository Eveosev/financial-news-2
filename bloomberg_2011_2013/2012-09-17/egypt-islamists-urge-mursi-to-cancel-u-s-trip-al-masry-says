Egyptian militant group al-Gama’a
al-Islamiya called on President Mohamed Mursi to cancel his
visit to the U.S. on Sept. 23 because of the anti-Islam film
which has sparked protests throughout the  Middle East , al-Masry
al-Youm newspaper reported today.  “Mursi has to prove he doesn’t separate between religion
and politics like his predecessors,” the Cairo-based newspaper
cited a spokesman for the group as saying. “We have elected
Mursi to defend our religion,” and the president shouldn’t be
concerned about a possible cut in U.S. military aid, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
