Orascom Development Holding AG (ODHN) ,
rose the most in more than six months after the Swiss hotel
builder said that it had sold all the apartments in its Chedi
Andermatt ski-resort project.  The stock rose as much as 8.2 percent, the biggest intraday
advance since March 9, and was up 3.3 percent at 15.75 Swiss
francs as of 11:33 a.m. in Zurich, giving the company a market
value of 450 million francs ($485 million).  Orascom has sold the remaining 73 apartments at its Chedi
Andermatt project for 122.7 million francs, the company said in
a statement last night. The buyer was Acuro Immobilien AG, a
real-estate investment vehicle in which Orascom Chairman  Samih Sawiris  is a minority shareholder, the Swiss construction
company said.  The Chedi complex at the ski-resort of Andermatt consists
of a five-star hotel with 50 hotel rooms as well as 106
apartments and 13 lofts and penthouses, according to the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
