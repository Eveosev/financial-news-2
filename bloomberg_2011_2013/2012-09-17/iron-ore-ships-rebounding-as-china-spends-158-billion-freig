Iron-ore  ships are poised to earn
more than operating costs for the first time this year as rates
rally on speculation Chinese  steel mills  will accelerate imports
because of a 1 trillion-yuan ($158 billion) building program.  Capesizes, each carrying 160,000 metric tons of ore, will
earn $12,500 a day in the fourth quarter, according to the
median of eight analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg,
compared with $4,469 on average since the end of June as
assessed by the  Baltic Exchange . Investors may profit by buying
forward freight agreements, traded by brokers and used to bet on
future costs, which are seen at $9,075. Ship owners need $7,437
to pay overheads including crew and repairs, a London-based unit
of Moore Stephens LLP advising the industry estimates.  China , accounting for 65 percent of seaborne demand, bought
the most ore in three months in August and  stockpiles  at ports
fell for the first time since March, government and Shanghai
Steelhome Information data show. Ore prices that neared a three-
year low on Sept. 5 have since rallied 26 percent as the state
announced spending on everything from subways to roads to
warehouses. Increasing demand for the commodity, the second-
biggest cargo after oil, will help diminish a glut in shipping.  “The 1 trillion-yuan package should provide a lifeline to
struggling Capesize owners,” said Frode Moerkedal, an analyst
at RS Platou Markets AS in Oslo whose recommendations on the
shares of shipping companies returned 20 percent in the past two
years. “Capesizes should benefit from the investment, as
they’re the main vessel class to ship iron ore.”  Commodity Cargoes  Rates tumbled as much as 89 percent to $2,644 this year as
fleet expansion outpaced growth in demand, according to the
London-based exchange, whose data are used as benchmarks for
about 75 percent of commodity cargoes. While Capesizes rallied
89 percent to $5,006 since Aug. 21, this quarter’s average would
be the lowest for data going back to 1999. Earnings may rise as
high as $25,000 in the next several months, said  Omar Nokta , an
analyst at Dahlman Rose & Co. in  New York .  Ore at the Chinese port of Tianjin, a global benchmark,
last traded at $109.60 a so-called dry ton, down from as much as
$149.40 in April, according to The Steel Index Ltd., a unit of
McGraw-Hill Cos. Prices, which retreated as  China’s economy 
slowed for six consecutive quarters, rebounded after the
government announced building plans on Sept. 5 and 6 that  Nomura
Holdings Inc. (8604)  estimates are worth $158 billion.  Investors can profit from the rally in rates by buying
shares of shipping companies with a higher proportion of their
fleets operating in the  spot market  rather than on long-term
charters, Nokta said. That includes Eagle Bulk Shipping Inc.,
Genco Shipping & Trading Ltd. and  Baltic Trading Ltd. (BALT) , all based
in New York, he wrote in a Sept. 10 report.  Morgan Stanley  Seaborne iron-ore exports will expand 14 percent next year,
the most since at least 2005 and three times faster than in
2012, Morgan Stanley estimates. The Capesize fleet’s 8.6 percent
expansion will be the smallest since 2009 and compares with 12
percent this year, according to the bank.  While the projected fourth-quarter Capesize rate would
cover owners’ operating expenses, it wouldn’t be enough to also
meet the cost of their debt. Once interest and loan repayments
are included, the break-even level rises to $15,000 a day on
average, according to Platou. Earnings last exceeded that in the
final three months of 2011.  The combined market value of the 14-member Bloomberg Pure
Play Dry Bulk Shipping Index has fallen to $5.86 billion from
$36.2 billion in May 2008, data compiled by Bloomberg show. D/S
Norden A/S, located in Hellerup,  Denmark , Seoul-based STX Pan
Ocean Co. and Antwerp, Belgium-based Cie. Maritime Belge SA are
the largest members of the gauge.  Shipbrokers’ Association  Capacity gluts exist across most of the merchant shipping
fleet. Rates for the largest  oil tankers  slumped 62 percent this
year, according to Clarkson Research Services Ltd., a unit of
the world’s largest shipbroker. An index reflecting charges for
six types of containers fell 29 percent in the past year, a
gauge from the Hamburg Shipbrokers’ Association shows. Moore
Stephens estimates operating costs every September and its 2012
review has yet to be published. Daily expenses for Capesizes
rose 1.7 percent to $7,437, it said in a report a year ago.  The rally in Capesizes and iron-ore prices may not last
because growth is slowing around the world. The  International
Monetary Fund  cut its 2013 global forecast to 3.9 percent from
4.1 percent in July. The 17-nation euro area contracted in the
second quarter and won’t expand again for another year, based on
the median of 22 economist estimates compiled by Bloomberg.
China’s economy will expand 7.9 percent in 2012, the least since
1999, according to 34 economist estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Investment Model  “It’s clearly slowing down fast,”  Jim Chanos , the founder
and president of hedge fund Kynikos Associates Ltd., said in an
interview on Sept. 11 at Bloomberg’s headquarters in New York.
“Will there be rallies in iron ore and other industrial
commodities, from time to time? Of course. But I think
structurally, until China really addresses this credit-driven
infrastructure and fixed-asset investment model, the surprises
are going to be on the downside.”  Shares of Baltic Trading, which operates nine bulk-
commodity carriers, fell 29 percent to $3.39 in New York trading
this year. The stock will rally to $5.38 in the next 12 months,
according to the  average  of four analyst estimates compiled by
Bloomberg. Genco declined 45 percent since the start of January
and Eagle Bulk retreated 12 percent.  Crude Steel  Producing a ton of crude steel in a blast furnace requires
about 1,400 kilograms (3,086 pounds) of iron ore, 770 kilograms
of coal and 270 kilograms of limestone and scrap steel,
according to the World Steel Association. Global crude-steel
output rose 0.8 percent to 895.4 million tons in the first seven
months from a year earlier, the Brussels-based WSA estimates.
Production will reach an all-time high of 1.56 billion tons in
2012 and 1.62 billion in 2013, according to MEPS (International)
Ltd., a Sheffield, England-based industry consultant.  Increasing iron-ore shipments mean the Capesize fleet will
work at about 80 percent of capacity in the next 12 months, from
77 percent, Platou estimates.  China imported 62.45 million tons of ore in August, 7.9
percent more than the previous month, customs data show.  Inventories held at ports retreated 1.2 percent to 98.5
million tons, according to Shanghai Steelhome Information, a
research company based in the city. The nation has imported more
in the second half of every year relative to the first six
months in all but one of the past 20 years, based on data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Imports  “There should be more iron-ore and coal imports into China
to satisfy the increased steel demand resulting from the new
infrastructure projects,” said Doug Mavrinac, a Houston-based
analyst at Jefferies & Co. “The dry-bulk shipping market could
finally make the cyclical turn toward sustainable profitability
for 2013 and beyond.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
