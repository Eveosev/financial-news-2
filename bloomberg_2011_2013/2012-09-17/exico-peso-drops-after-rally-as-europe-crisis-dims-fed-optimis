Mexico ’s peso fell as European
finance ministers hit an impasse at euro-region debt crisis-
talks, damping optimism that the global economic expansion was
poised to strengthen.  The peso fell 0.4 percent to 12.7713 per  U.S. dollar  at 4
p.m. in Mexico City, after touching 12.7090 per dollar on Sept.
14, the strongest level since April 3. It rose 2.1 percent last
week, the biggest weekly since the period ended June 29.  While Mexico has benefited from speculation that a third
round of Federal Reserve bond buying would bolster the world’s
biggest economy, a rally in global stocks and emerging-market
currencies waned today amid European crisis concern. European
Union finance ministers failed to agree on a timetable for a
more unified banking industry at a meeting Sept. 14 in Cyprus,
while Citigroup Inc. cut  China ’s 2013 economic growth forecast
to 7.6 percent from 8 percent.  “When bad news starts to come out of  Europe  and
uncertainty sets in, investors tend” to sell the peso,
Alejandro Padilla, a debt strategist at Grupo Financiero Banorte
SAB in Mexico City.  Yields on on Mexican peso bonds due in 2024 fell three
basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 5.70 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The price rose 0.35
centavo to 137.87 centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
