Gulf Coast  gasoline weakened after
Phillips 66 restarted several units at its Alliance refinery in
Belle Chasse, Louisiana.  Phillips 66 expects all units at the 247,000-barrel-a-day
plant to be started by the end of the week, the company said in
a statement on its website. Power was lost to the refinery on
Sept. 5, the second time in about a week after the plant was
shut in preparation for Hurricane Isaac.  The premium for conventional, 87-octane gasoline on the
Gulf Coast fell 1.13 cents to 7.75 cents a gallon versus futures
traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 4 p.m., according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt delivery fell 9.3 cents to
$3.017 a gallon.  Delta Air Lines Inc. (DAL) ’s Monroe Energy LLC subsidiary is
starting the crude unit at the  Trainer oil refinery  in
Pennsylvania, a person with direct knowledge of the schedule
said yesterday.  The crude unit is warming up and will take about two days
to return to service ahead of other process units at the plant,
said the person, who asked not to be identified because the
information isn’t public.  The premium for reformulated, 87-octane gasoline in  New
York  Harbor, fell 7.25 cents to 17.75 cents a gallon versus
futures. It is the lowest level since Aug. 31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
