A hammer chart pattern may drive
the  dollar  to its highest level in more than a month against its
Canadian counterpart if the greenback exceeds a key resistance
level, according to Royal Bank of  Canada .  A daily close for the Canadian currency above 97.28 cents
per  U.S. dollar  would confirm a hammer pattern set Sept. 14,
sending the loonie, as the currency is nicknamed, to resistance
at 98.01 to 98.57, then to C$1.0002, RBC said today in a note to
clients. The pattern was created after the U.S. dollar started
Friday at 96.85, and then dropped to 96.33 before appreciating
to 97.23. The formation is created on a candle chart when a
currency falls, then rebounds to close above its opening price.  “They moved down into oversold territory,”  George Davis ,
chief technical analyst for fixed income and currency strategy
in Toronto at RBC, said in a telephone interview. “People were
a little reluctant to aggressively push dollar-Canada below the
96.30s area. They weren’t really comfortable with short
positions below that level with dollar-Canada being down that
weak.”  A daily close for the dollar above $1.0083 may signal
further strength against the loonie, Davis wrote. The company’s
medium-term technical price target is for the Canadian dollar to
strengthen to 95.75 per U.S. dollar, he said.  “With the overall trend in dollar-Canada being down, we
think these shorter-term corrections are going to continue to
attract selling interest,” Davis said. “Once valuations move
to more neutral levels, we’ll see dollar-Canada push back
towards the bottom end of its range once again.”  The U.S. dollar gained 0.4 percent to 97.54 Canadian cents
at 3:12 p.m. in  New York . One Canadian dollar buys $1.0250.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to forecast changes in a
security, commodity, currency or index. Resistance and support
refer to areas on a graph where pre-established orders may be
clustered.  To contact the reporter on this story:
