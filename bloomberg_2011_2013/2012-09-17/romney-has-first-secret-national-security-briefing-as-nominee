Republican presidential nominee
Mitt Romney received his first classified national security
briefing today at a federal office building in Los Angeles.  The practice is customary for presidential nominees. Then-
Senator  Barack Obama  received his first such briefing at an FBI
office in Chicago on Sept. 2, 2008.  Romneyâ€™s session lasted about two-and-a-half hours, longer
than it will take most days because it was his first session,
said  Rick Gorka , his traveling press secretary.  Earlier today, Romney delivered a speech in Los Angeles to
the national convention of the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of
Commerce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
