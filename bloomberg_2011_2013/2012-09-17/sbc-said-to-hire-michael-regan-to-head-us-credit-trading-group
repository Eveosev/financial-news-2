HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA)  hired Michael Regan from  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS)  to head its U.S.
credit trading group.  Regan is based in  New York  and reports to Christophe Rivoire, head of North America rates trading, and Niall Cameron,
global head of credit trading, according to Juanita Gutierrez, a
New York-based spokeswoman for Europe’s largest bank. He was
hired as a managing director in credit trading by RBS in 2010,
and has also worked for Deutsche Bank AG and Merrill Lynch in
New York and London, the person said.  Adam Hoffman was also recruited from  Morgan Stanley (MS)  to run
the bank’s North American loan-trading business, reporting to
Regan and Catherine Yelverton, who runs that business globally.  HSBC has bolstered its credit-trading team in the past two
months as other European banks retrench from trading and lending
amid stricter capital regulations known as Basel III.  In July Dermot Murphy and Mahmoud Atalla were appointed
managing directors in charge of the bank’s new credit situations
group in London, reporting to Asif Godall, head of European
credit trading. Murphy joined from  UBS AG (UBSN)  and focuses on trading
in special situations, such as distressed debt, corporate
restructurings and bank deleveraging, HSBC said. Sam Terry, who
previously worked in distressed debt sourcing and sales for
Yorvik Partners LLP, also joined their team.  To contact the reporter on this story:
