The dollar fell for a fifth
straight day against the euro as the  Federal Reserve ’s asset-
purchase plan to bolster sluggish economic growth damped demand
for refuge.  The 17-member currency reached a fourth-month high versus
the greenback as Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy  considered whether
to request economic assistance for the indebted nation after the
European Central Bank said it would buy bonds to temper
borrowing costs. The yen weakened against most of its major
counterparts before the  Bank of Japan (8301)  meets Sept. 19. Taiwan’s
dollar and South Korea’s won rallied as international investors
increased holdings of Asian stocks.  “Spanish yields have moved higher, which is a reminder
that the ECB action is positive, but won’t translate in to
positive reduction in European risk unless Spanish sovereign
risks are allayed,” said  Aroop Chatterjee , a currency
strategist at Barclays Plc in New York. “We prefer to sell the
dollar versus riskier currencies rather than the euro.”  The dollar fell 0.2 percent to $1.3154 at 9:50 a.m. New
York time, touching the lowest level since May 4. The shared
currency added 0.6 percent to 103.57 yen. The dollar rose 0.5
percent to 78.76 yen.  To contact the reporters on this story:
