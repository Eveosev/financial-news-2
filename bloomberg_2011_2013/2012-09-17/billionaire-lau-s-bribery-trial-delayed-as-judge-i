Hong Kong  billionaire Joseph Lau’s
bribery and money-laundering trial in Macau was delayed until
January with the presiding judge having fallen ill.  Lau and seven other men were scheduled to go on trial today
in relation to a 2006 land purchase by his listed developer
 Chinese Estates Holdings Ltd. (127)  Lau has denied allegations he or
his company may have bribed Macau’s former secretary of
transportation and public works Ao Man-long to secure the land
purchase.  The adjournment was announced today by a court official who
declined to identify himself. He didn’t give any details of the
illness affecting Judge Alice Costa.  Macau, the only part of  China  where casinos are legal, last
month canceled the sale of the 5,204-square-meter (56,000 square
feet) land to Chinese Estates after Lau was charged. Ao was
sentenced to 29 years in prison for corruption in May.  Chinese Estates said Sept. 14 the company and a buyer of an
apartment at La Scala, the residential project being built on
the site, filed an appeal of the Macau government’s decision to
declare the land concession invalid.  Shares of Chinese Estates  are down  23 percent this year,
compared with the 12 percent gain in the benchmark  Hang Seng
Index . Lau controls almost 75 percent of the developer.  The case is CR1-12-0131-PCC in Macau’s Court of First
Instance.  To contact the reporter on this story:
