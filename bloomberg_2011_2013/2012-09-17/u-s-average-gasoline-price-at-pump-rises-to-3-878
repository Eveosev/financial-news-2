Retail gasoline prices climbed
above year-earlier levels for the sixth consecutive week,
tracking oil futures that rose above $100 a barrel on Sept. 14
for the first time since May.  The  national average  for regular gasoline climbed 3.1
cents, or 0.8 percent, to $3.878 a gallon from a week earlier,
the U.S. Energy Information Administration said in a report
posted on its website yesterday. Prices are up 7.7 percent from
$3.601 in 2011 and at a record-high for this time of year.  Retail  gasoline  has risen 52 cents a gallon since the
beginning of July on unplanned refinery outages and as crude
futures in  New York  climbed 14 percent over the same period.
Oil, which makes up about 66 percent of the costs of gasoline,
gained $2.58 last week as the  Federal Reserve ’s plan to buy
mortgage securities increased demand for commodities and stocks.  “Crude prices are the main driver of gasoline prices, and
oil was basically up six cents a gallon,”  David Hackett , the
president of independent fuel consultant Stillwater Associates
in Irvine,  California , said by telephone yesterday.  Oil for October delivery on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  was at $96.96 a barrel in electronic trading today.
Futures dropped $2.38, or 2.4 percent, to settle at $96.62 a
barrel yesterday after tumbling to as low as $94.65 in late
trading.  Crude stockpiles  gained 2 million barrels, or 0.6 percent,
to 359.1 million in the week ended Sept. 7, Energy Department
data show. They probably rose another 1 million barrels to 360.1
million last week, according to the median of seven analyst
estimates before an Energy Department report tomorrow.  Gasoline for October delivery on Nymex was trading at
$2.9604 a gallon today, up 1.71 cents. Futures dropped 2.4
percent yesterday to settle at $2.9433 a gallon.  Gasoline Inventories  Motor-gasoline inventories slipped 1.18 million barrels, or
0.6 percent, to 197.7 million in the week ended Sept. 7, the
Energy Department said. They probably climbed 1.5 million
barrels to 199.2 million last week, the Bloomberg survey shows.  Retail gasoline rose the most in the U.S. Rocky Mountain
region this week, increasing 7.4 cents to $3.772 a gallon, the
highest since April.  Suncor Energy Inc. (SU) ’s Commerce City refinery
in Colorado shut Aug. 27 after losing both of its boilers and
was working to restart units a day later.  HollyFrontier Corp. (HFC)  was also scheduled to shut a coker at
the  Cheyenne refinery  in Wyoming around Aug. 15 for about a
month of planned work, two people familiar with the schedule
said July 12.  The U.S. West Coast was the only region where prices fell,
slipping 0.9 cent to $4.074 a gallon, according to the Energy
Department.  Prices are “settling down” in California following an
Aug. 6 fire at  Chevron Corp. (CVX) ’s Richmond refinery, Hackett said.  The Energy Department conducts a telephone survey on
Mondays of 800 retail gasoline outlets across the U.S. to post
weekly prices.  To contact the reporter on this story:
