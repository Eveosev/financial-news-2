Norway’s Oil and Energy Minister
Ola Borten Moe won’t seek re-election next year after serving
for two consecutive parliaments.  “I wish over time to get further experience outside of
politics,” Borten Moe, 36, said today in a statement. “This is
not a farewell to Norwegian politics.” The minister said he had
no “concrete” plans other than to manage his farm.  Borten Moe, first elected in 2005 and named energy minister
in Jens Stoltenberg’s Labor-led government in March 2011, hasn’t
any plan to step down until the September 2013 election, Haakon
Smith-Isaksen, a ministry spokesman, said by phone.  “I have a strong wish that the Center Party should have a
successful election next fall and that the government should be
re-elected,” Borten Moe said in the party statement. “As a
deputy leader of the Center Party and as a minister, I will
spend all my time working to make sure we reach this goal.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
