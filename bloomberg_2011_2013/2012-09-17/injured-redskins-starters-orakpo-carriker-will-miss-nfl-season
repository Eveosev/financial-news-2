Defensive starters Brian Orakpo and
Adam Carriker of the  Washington Redskins  will miss the rest of
the National Football League season with injuries.  Orakpo, 26, a two-time Pro Bowl linebacker, tore his left
pectoral muscle in yesterdayâ€™s 31-28 loss to the St. Louis Rams
and is expected to miss the next four months, coach  Mike Shanahan  said today at a news conference.  Carriker, a 28-year-old defensive end, tore a tendon in his
right quadriceps against the Rams and will miss five months,
Shanahan said. Both players will have surgery within the next
week, according to the coach.  Orakpo was taken by Washington with the No. 13 pick in the
2009 NFL Draft. He has 29 1/2 sacks and six forced fumbles in
his four-year career.  Now in his fifth NFL season and third with the Redskins,
Carriker had 5 1/2 sacks last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
