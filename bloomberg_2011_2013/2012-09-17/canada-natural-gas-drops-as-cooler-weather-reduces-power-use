Canadian natural gas declined on
forecasts of cooler U.S. weather that may cut demand for the
power-plant fuel.  October gas in Alberta  slipped 1.8 percent as Commodity
Weather Group LLC in Bethesda,  Maryland , predicted mostly normal
or below-normal temperatures in the eastern half of the U.S.
from Sept. 17 through Sept. 26. Futures in New York rose to a
six-week settlement high of $3.063 per million Btu on Sept. 12.  “The inability to maintain above the $3 level points up
the market’s fundamental inherent weakness,”  Mike Fitzpatrick ,
an editor at the Energy OverView newsletter in New York, said in
a note to clients today. “Hardly surprising, with moderating
temperatures forecast for the next few weeks for the high-
consumption regions.”  Alberta  gas for October delivery dropped 4.25 cents to
C$2.31 per gigajoule ($2.24 per million British thermal units)
as of 3:40 p.m. New York time on NGX, a Canadian Internet
market. Gas traded on the exchange is shipped to users in  Canada 
and the U.S. and priced on  TransCanada Corp. (TRP) ’s Alberta system.  Natural gas for October delivery on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  fell 7.8 cents, or 2.7 percent, to settle at $2.865 per
million Btu. The futures have declined 4.1 percent this year.  The high in Chicago on Sept. 23 may be 61 degrees
Fahrenheit (16 Celsius), 12 below normal, according to
 AccuWeather Inc.  in  State College , Pennsylvania. The high in New
York may be 70 degrees, 3 lower than the usual reading.  Pipeline Flows  Electricity producers account for about 36 percent of U.S.
gas consumption, according to the Energy Department.  Volume on TransCanada’s  Alberta system , which collects the
output of most of the nation’s gas wells, was 15.8 billion cubic
feet at 2:30 p.m. New York time.  Gas was flowing at a daily rate of 1.92 billion cubic feet
at Empress, Alberta, where the fuel is transferred to
TransCanada’s main Line.  At McNeil, Saskatchewan, where gas is transferred to the
Northern Border Pipeline for shipment to the Chicago area, the
daily flow rate was 1.94 billion cubic feet.  Available capacity on TransCanada’s  British Columbia system 
at Kingsgate was 314 million cubic feet. The system was forecast
to carry 1.7 billion cubic feet today. Estimated capacity was
2.02 billion.  The volume on  Spectra Energy’s  British Columbia system,
which gathers the fuel in northeastern British Columbia for
delivery to Vancouver and the Pacific Northwest, totaled 2.68
billion cubic feet at 2:35 p.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
