Ukrainian meat and sausages producer
 APK-Invest  plans to raise its sales by more than 25 percent this
year as it increases production, the company’s President Denys
Omelyanovych said.  APK-Invest, based in the eastern Ukrainian city of Donetsk,
sees its sales at around 1.3 billion hryvnian in 2013, compared
with 1 billion in the previous year, Omelyanovych told
journalists today in Kiev.  APK-Invest, which produced 15 percent of the pork meat in
Ukraine last year, increased its net income fourfold to 89
million hryvnia in 2012 from a year ago, Omelyanovych said. It
increased pork meat and sausages production by 55 percent to
30,700 tons. The company plans to produce 42,000 tons this year.  The company will also increase its land bank to 50,000
hectares by 2015 from 32,000 it had in 2012, Omelyanovych said.
APK-Invest plans to reap as much as 70,000 metric tons of grains
this year 36,200 tons it harvested in 2012, he said.  “We plan that 65 percent of our grain needs will be
covered from our harvest,” Omelyanovych said.  The company, set up in 2006, invested around 500 million
hryvnia into its expansion last year and plans to keep the level
of investments at the same level in 2013, said APK-Invest’s
Chief Executive Officer Roman Raspopov, adding that half of the
proceeds were provided by the owner, while the rest was borrowed
from banks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
