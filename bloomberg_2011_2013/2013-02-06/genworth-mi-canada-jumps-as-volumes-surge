  Genworth MI Canada Inc. , a
residential mortgage insurance provider, jumped the most in four
months after reporting a surge in new business and a drop in its
loan loss ratio that led to better-than-expected earnings.  Genworth rose 4 percent to C$24.63 in Toronto, the most
since Sept. 14. The shares have risen 9.5 percent in the past 12
months.  The company, based in Oakville, Ontario, reported fourth-
quarter  profit  of C$226 million compared with C$79 million a
year ago, the company said in a statement. Adjusted earnings
were 90 Canadian cents a share, compared with the average
estimate of 78 cents according to 10 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg.  The loss ratio, which measures the difference between
premiums paid to and claims settled by the company, dropped 8
percentage points to 31 percent compared with the year before.  Total new insurance written in the fourth quarter rose 37
percent to C$8.5 billion from C$6.2 billion a year ago, driven
by higher volumes.  Genworth’s delinquency rate fell 6 basis points year-over-
year to 0.14 percent.  “The delinquency rate continues to be positively
influenced by improving economic conditions,” the company said
in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
