MetLife Inc. (MET) , the largest U.S. life
insurer, had the outlook on its long-term  credit rating  revised
to negative by Moody’s Investors Service because of a sluggish
economy and the low-interest-rate environment.  “The current weak economic environment has constrained
current and prospective profitability as well as earnings and
coverage metrics,” Moody’s Senior Credit Officer Neil Strauss
said today in a statement.  The ratings company affirmed the grade for New York-based
MetLife’s senior debt at A3. The insurer’s profitability “has
been below expectations” and its 2013 earnings forecast raises
uncertainty about whether earnings will improve, Moody’s said in
the report.  “It isn’t surprising that Moody’s decided to place MetLife
on negative outlook as the decision is consistent with its
previously expressed views of the outlook for both the U.S. and
global life insurance industries,”  John Calagna , a MetLife
spokesman, said in an e-mailed statement. “MetLife continues to
have financial-strength ratings that are among the highest the
rating agency provides.”  The Americas region, MetLife’s largest, has been challenged
by slow growth in the U.S., which was targeted for most of the
$600 million in cost reductions announced in May. The company,
led by Chief Executive Officer  Steven Kandarian , 60, said in
December it’s planning to cut variable-annuity sales by about 40
percent to as little as $10 billion this year.  The insurer announced Feb. 1 it will buy Santiago-based AFP
Provida SA from Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA, bolstering
MetLife’s presence in  Latin America  while trimming its reliance
on capital-intensive offerings.  MetLife rose 1 percent to $37.61 in New York. The shares
have climbed 14 percent this year, the second-best performance
in the 24-company  KBW Insurance Index (KIX) , after Genworth Financial
Inc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
