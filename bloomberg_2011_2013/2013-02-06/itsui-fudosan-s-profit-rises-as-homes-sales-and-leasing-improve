Mitsui Fudosan Co. , Japan’s largest
property developer by sales, said net income rose 69 percent
after selling more homes and new shopping malls and office
property boosted leasing revenue.  Net income  gained to 47 billion yen ($501 million) for the
nine months ended Dec. 31 from 27.8 billion yen a year ago, the
Tokyo-based company said in a statement to the stock exchange
today. Sales increased 6.1 percent to 944.8 billion yen.  Mitsui Fudosan  is expecting its full-year profit to rise
for the first time in four years as home sales improve and new
shopping malls such as Mitsui Outlet Park Kisarazu and DiverCity
opened during the nine-month period, contributing to leasing
revenue. The company sold 16 percent more apartments and houses
in the period, it said in the statement.  Mitsui Fudosan’s residential business had an operating
profit of 11.6 billion yen for the period, compared with a loss
of 267 million for the same period a year earlier. Operating
profit for the company’s  leasing business , which accounts for
more than half of its net income, rose 10 percent to 81.8
billion yen in the nine months.  For the full year, Mitsui Fudosan reiterated its  net income 
forecast of 55 billion yen on revenue of 1.46 trillion yen.  Mitsui Fudosan’s  shares  rose 3.8 percent to 2,034 yen at
the close of trading in Tokyo, completing its biggest gain since
Nov. 15. The company reported earnings after the market closed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
