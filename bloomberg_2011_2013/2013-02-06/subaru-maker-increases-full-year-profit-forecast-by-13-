Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd. , the maker
of Subaru cars, raised its full-year profit forecast by 13
percent on the weaker yen and increased auto sales.  Net income for the fiscal year ending March will probably
reach 76 billion yen ($811 million), compared with the
carmaker’s previous 67 billion yen projection, the Tokyo-based
company said in a  statement  today. That compares with the 83.3
billion yen average of 21 analyst estimates compiled by
Bloomberg.  Fuji Heavy joins  Toyota Motor Corp.  in raising its profit
projections as the weakening yen makes Japanese products more
profitable overseas. The maker of Subaru cars delivered a record
number of vehicles in the U.S. last year, led by the Impreza
hatchback.  The company said it expects to sell 722,000 vehicles for
the full year, an increase of 8,000 units from its previous
forecast. The automaker today also raised its projections for
operating income and revenue. The projections are based on
currency assumptions at 82 yen to the dollar and 105 yen to the
euro, according to the statement.  Fuji Heavy was the best performer on the Nikkei 225 Stock
Average last year, more than doubling as the automaker’s lack of
manufacturing plants in China gave it flexibility to ship more
cars to the U.S. and Japan. The shares climbed 4.2 percent at
1:24 p.m. in Tokyo, extending this year’s gain to 27 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
