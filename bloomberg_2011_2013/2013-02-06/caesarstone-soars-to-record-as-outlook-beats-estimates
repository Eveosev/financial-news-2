Caesarstone Sdot-Yam Ltd. , the
Israeli producer of quartz-based countertops, climbed to a
record high after posting better-than-expected fourth-quarter
sales and forecasting 2013 revenue that surpasses estimates.  Caesarstone jumped 9.1 percent to $20.71 in New York, the
highest since the company’s shares began trading on March 22.
The rally led gains in the  Bloomberg Israel-US Equity Index  of
the biggest Israeli companies traded in the U.S. The gauge rose
0.6 percent to 87.73, the highest closing level in a month.  The company, based in Sdot Yam, Israel, posted  revenue  of
$76.2 million during the last three months of 2012, above the
$73.2 million mean of three analysts’  estimates  compiled by
Bloomberg. Caesarstone said sales in 2013 could reach $330
million to $340 million, beating analysts’ projections for $327
million in revenue.  “The company, as a global leader in the rapidly expanding
quartz countertop market, is well positioned to benefit from the
category’s increased penetration over the next several years,”
 Michael Rehaut , an analyst at JPMorgan Chase & Co. in New York,
wrote in a note e-mailed today. “The stock is trading at a
compelling relative valuation and does not fully reflect our
outlook for solid earning-per-share growth over the next two to
three years.”  Caesarstone has  surged  88 percent since the stock’s debut
in New York, while the Israel-US gauge lost 0.8 percent during
the same period. The U.S. is the company’s fastest growing
market with sales in the region expanding 45 percent in 2012,
Chief Executive Officer  Yosef Shiran  said today on a conference
call.  To contact the reporter on this story:
