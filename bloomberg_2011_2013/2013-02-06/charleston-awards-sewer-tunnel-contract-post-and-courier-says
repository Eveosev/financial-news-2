Charlestonâ€™s water board awarded a
$50.8 million contract for the final phase of work on a sewer
tunnel 1.6 miles long (2.6 kilometers) to the Plum Island
wastewater treatment plant, The Post and Courier said.  The South Carolina newspaper said the water board approved
the 30-month contract that includes a new pump station and pipes
and that construction will begin shortly on the 120-foot-deep
(37 meters) West Ashley Tunnel with Southland Renda JV.  To contact the reporter on this story:
