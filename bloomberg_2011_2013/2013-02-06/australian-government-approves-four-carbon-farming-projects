The Australian government, which is
seeking to reduce the nation’s reliance on coal, approved four
new projects as part of its program that allows farmers and land
holders to earn carbon credits by reducing emissions.  Two of the carbon-farming initiatives set rules for the
growth, regeneration and maintenance of native forest areas,
while the others relate to piggeries and landfill operations,
according to an e-mailed statement today from the office of
Australian Climate Change Minister  Greg Combet .  The carbon-farming projects are part of Prime Minister
 Julia Gillard ’s program introduced last year to charge the
nation’s biggest polluters for their carbon emissions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
