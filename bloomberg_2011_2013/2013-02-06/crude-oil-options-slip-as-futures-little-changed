Crude oil options volatility slipped
as the underlying futures were little changed.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
March, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 20.50 percent at 4 p.m. on the New York
Mercantile Exchange, down from from 20.58 yesterday. Crude oil
for March delivery slipped 2 cents to settle at $96.62 a barrel
on the New York Mercantile Exchange.  An Energy Information Administration report today showed
that  crude inventories  retreated 315,000 barrels at Cushing,
Oklahoma, to 51.4 million last week, a one-month low.  Nationwide
supplies  gained 2.62 million barrels to 371.7 million.  The most active options in electronic trading today were
March $95 puts. They declined 11 cents to 58 cents a barrel on
volume of 1,975 contracts. The second-most active were March $93
puts, which dropped 6 cents to 28 cents a barrel, with 1,839
lots exchanged.  Bets that prices would fall, or puts, accounted for 56
percent of electronic trading volume.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on open-
outcry volume, where the bulk of options activity occurs.  In the previous session, puts accounted for 51 percent of
volume.  December $110 calls were the most active traded options
yesterday, with 8,100 contracts trading as they rose 6 cents to
$2.89 a barrel. April $110 calls were unchanged at 14 cents a
barrel on 5,703 lots.  Open interest was highest for March $110 calls with 41,621
