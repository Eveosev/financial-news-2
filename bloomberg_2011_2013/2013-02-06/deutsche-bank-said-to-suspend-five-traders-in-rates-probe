Deutsche Bank AG , Europe’s biggest
bank by assets, suspended five traders in Frankfurt amid an
internal probe into alleged attempts to rig interbank lending
rates, according to a person familiar with the matter.  The traders, who were suspended yesterday, counted rates
submissions among their responsibilities, said the person, who
asked not to be identified because the decision hasn’t been made
public.  Regulators from Canada to Switzerland are investigating
whether more than a dozen banks, including  Deutsche Bank ,
colluded to rig lending rates.  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc ,
Britain’s biggest publicly owned lender, was fined about $612
million by U.S. and U.K. authorities today.  Deutsche Bank declined to say whether it had suspended any
employees. It repeated in an e-mailed statement that it will
suspend or dismiss traders found to have acted inappropriately.  The company said in July that an internal investigation
found misconduct by individual employees of the bank related to
interbank rates, though no wrongdoing by any current or former
members of the board. Deutsche Bank dismissed two traders at the
end of 2011 for suspected manipulation of the rates.  The bank probably won’t resolve all issues pertaining to
alleged manipulation this year,  Stephan Leithner , the company’s
management board member for legal affairs, said last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
