BlackBerry said its new Z10
smartphone was selling almost three times better in the U.K.
than any of its previous models in the first week they hit store
shelves.  Sales in Canada, which kicked off yesterday, were up by
more than 50 percent from any previous introduction, Chief
Executive Officer  Thorsten Heins  said in an e-mailed statement.  BlackBerry, formerly known as  Research In Motion , debuted
the new Z10 and Q10 phones last week in the two countries. Heins
is seeking to capitalize on positive reviews to kickstart sales
in the U.K. and Canada ahead of the Z10’s U.S. release in March.  BlackBerry was little changed at $16.05 at the close in New
York trading. The stock has rallied more than 150 percent since
late September on optimism that the phones can make the company
competitive again with  Apple Inc. ’s iPhone and  Samsung
Electronics Co. ’s Galaxy lineup.  Canadian mobile-phone carrier  BCE Inc .’s Bell Mobility site
has been taking Z10 pre-registration since the beginning of
January, and the device topped all BlackBerry orders even before
the Jan. 30 unveiling,  Mark Langton , a Bell spokesman, has said.
 Rogers Communications Inc ., the country’s largest wireless
carrier, said it sold more BlackBerrys yesterday than any other
day in Rogers history. “Thousands” of touch-screen Z10s were
activated yesterday, the Toronto-based company said in an e-
mail.  The Z10 won’t go on sale in the U.S. until March because of
lengthier testing by AT&T Inc. and Verizon Wireless, Heins said
yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
