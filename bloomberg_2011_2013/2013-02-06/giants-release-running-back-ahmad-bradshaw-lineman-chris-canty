The New York Giants released running
back Ahmad Bradshaw, who won two Super Bowl titles during his
six seasons with the National Football League team, and
defensive tackle Chris Canty.  Bradshaw, 26, had a team-leading 1,015 rushing yards and
six touchdowns for the Giants last season.  Bradshaw, who had surgery this offseason to repair a
fractured bone in his right foot, had two years left on his
contract and was due to make $3.75 million next season. A
seventh-round draft pick in 2007, he ranks sixth in franchise
history with 4,232 rushing yards.  With Bradshaw’s exit, 2012 first-round pick David Wilson or
Andre Brown may get a chance at the starting job.  Canty, 30, spent the past four seasons with the Giants,
totaling nine sacks, after signing as a free agent in 2009. He
was set to have a base salary of $6.25 million next season.  The moves were announced on the team’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
