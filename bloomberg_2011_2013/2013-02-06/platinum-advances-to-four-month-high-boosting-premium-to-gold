Platinum rose to a 16-month high on
concern that supplies will fall from South Africa, which
accounts for about 73 percent of global output. Gold gained.  Holdings in exchange traded-products backed by platinum
expanded to a record 51.5 metric tons yesterday, data compiled
by Bloomberg show. The platinum-mining industry is in crisis
because of strikes and spiraling operating costs, Anglo American
Plc Chief Executive Officer Cynthia Carroll said yesterday.
China’s central bank said today growth momentum in the world’s
second-biggest economy is “relatively strong.”  “Supply issues and expectations of rising demand,
especially from China, are pushing prices higher,”  David Meger ,
the director of metal trading at Vision Financial Markets in
Chicago, said in a telephone interview.  On the New York Mercantile Exchange, platinum futures for
delivery in April rose 1.7 percent to settle at $1,736.50 an

prices jumped to $1,744.50, the highest for a most-active
contract since Sept. 22, 2011. Volume was about 49 percent
higher than the 100-day average for the time of day.  One ounce of platinum bought as many as 1.0337 ounces of

$764.80 an ounce on the Nymex, after reaching $772.90, the

alongside platinum and both are used mostly as catalysts in
pollution-control devices in cars.  Gold futures for April delivery added 0.3 percent to settle
at $1,678.80 an ounce on the Comex in New York, advancing for
the third time time in four sessions.  China Imports  Imports of gold into mainland China from Hong Kong rose 94
percent to a record last year. Mainland China imported 834,502
kilograms (834.5 metric tons), including scrap and coins, up
from about 431,215 kilograms in 2011, Bloomberg calculations
based on data yesterday from the Census and Statistics
Department of the Hong Kong government.  The import data, alongside “persistently strong” volumes
on the Shanghai Gold Exchange and elevated premiums in the past
couple of weeks, indicate a “robust demand story” in China,
UBS AG said in a report today.  Silver futures for March delivery rose less than 0.1
percent to $31.877 an ounce on the Comex.  To contact the reporter for this story:
