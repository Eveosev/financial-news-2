The U.S. embassy in Azerbaijan
expressed concern about the arrest of two opposition
politicians, urging the government of President  Ilham Aliyev  to
ensure a fair and transparent investigation.  Ilgar Mammadov, leader of the Republican Alternative
movement who plans to run for president in elections slated for
October, and Tofiq Yaqubli, deputy head of the main opposition
party Musavat, were arrested Feb. 4 on charges of inciting riots
in the northwestern town of Ismayilli last month. Both will
remain in police custody for two months awaiting trial.  “We urge the government of Azerbaijan to observe due
process of the law and ensure transparency and fairness of the
judicial process,” the U.S. embassy said in an e-mailed
statement today. “We encourage meaningful dialogue between the
Azerbaijani government and its citizens to address legitimate
grievances and also urge authorities to respect citizens’
freedom of assembly and expression.”  Dozens of people were detained after residents of
Ismayilli, 200 kilometers (124 miles) northwest of the capital,
Baku, torched a hotel and luxury cars owned by a son of one of
Aliyev’s ministers and damaged the local governor’s house in two
days of riots. Authorities accused “destructive forces,”
including Mammadov and Yaqubli, of provoking the unrest, charges
both men dismissed as politically motivated.  To contact the reporter on this story:
