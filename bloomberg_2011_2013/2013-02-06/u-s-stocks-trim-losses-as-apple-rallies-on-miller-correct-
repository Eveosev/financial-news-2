(Corrects to say trimmed losses in headline.)  U.S. stocks pared losses as shares of
Apple Inc. rallied following a report that Legg Mason Inc. fund
manager Bill Miller said the stock may be worth 50 percent more
than its current price.  The Standard & Poorâ€™s 500 Index was little changed at
1,510.59 at 11:03 a.m. in New York after falling as much as 0.4
percent. Apple rallied almost 2 percent after Miller told the
Financial Times the shares could be worth more if the company
were to keep all its cash on its balance sheet and put future
free cash flow into a dividend.  To contact the reporter on this story:
