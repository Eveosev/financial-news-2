Soybeans fell for the first time in
four sessions on speculation that Brazil, poised to become the
world’s biggest exporter this year, may harvest a larger crop
than forecast earlier.  INTL FCStone Inc. yesterday raised its projection for
output in Brazil to 83.05 million metric tons from an estimate
of 80.01 million tons in December, citing higher yield
potential. The average of 23 analyst estimates in a Bloomberg
News survey forecasted the country’s harvest to reach a record
82.7 million tons, more than the U.S. Department of
Agriculture’s December estimate at 82.5 million tons. The USDA
is scheduled to update its outlook on Feb. 8.  “The Brazilian soybean harvest is gathering steam,”  Luke Mathews , a commodity strategist at Commonwealth Bank of
Australia, said in a report e-mailed today. “Argentinean
weather is expected to improve later this month and prices are
facing technical resistance.”  Soybeans for March delivery fell 0.8 percent to $14.84 a
bushel by 6:51 a.m. on the Chicago Board of Trade. Futures
touched $14.98 a bushel on Feb. 4, the highest level for a most-
active contract since Dec. 17.  Corn for March delivery fell 0.6 percent to $7.2475 a
bushel, heading for a fourth straight loss. About 5.35 million
bushels of the grain were  inspected  for export in the week ended
Jan. 31, the lowest since July 2003, the USDA said Feb. 4. U.S.
stockpiles before the next harvest may be 616 million bushels,
larger than last month’s USDA forecast at 602 million bushels,
analysts said in the Bloomberg survey.  “Observers are expecting U.S. corn inventories to be
higher at the end of the season than the USDA has so far
assumed,” Carsten Fritsch, an analyst at Commerzbank AG in
Frankfurt, said in a report today. “This view is supported by
recent disappointing demand figures.”  Wheat for delivery in March fell 0.5 percent to $7.5375 a
bushel in Chicago. In Paris, milling wheat for May delivery
dropped 0.7 percent to 241 euros ($326) a ton on NYSE Liffe.
Rough rice for March delivery rose 0.1 percent to $16.16 per 100
pounds on the CBOT, after rallying to $16.29 yesterday, the
highest for a most-active contract since Nov. 7, 2011.  To contact the reporters on this story:
