Human Rights Foundation, headed by
Chairman  Garry Kasparov , demanded that  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. 
end a consulting agreement with the Russian government led by
President  Vladimir Putin .  “Goldman Sachs’s deal with Putin ranks among the worst
examples ever of a company seeking to bolster its profits by
laundering the financial reputation of a country led by a
corruptly elected despot,” Kasparov, the former chess champion
and leader of Russia’s Solidarity opposition group, said in a
 statement . “By doing business with Putin, Goldman Sachs is
acting as an enemy of free enterprise and economic freedom.”  Goldman Sachs, led by Chief Executive Officer  Lloyd C. Blankfein , signed a three-year agreement with Russia’s Economy
Ministry and the Russian Direct Investment Fund to help set up
meetings with investors and better communicate government
decisions, according to  Sergei Arsenyev , the company’s managing
director of investment banking in Moscow. Blankfein, 58, is also
a member of Prime Minister  Dmitry Medvedev ’s advisory committee
on turning Moscow into a financial center.  “It is in the long-term interest of Russia and its people
to attract foreign investment,”  Michael DuVally , a spokesman
for New York-based Goldman Sachs, said in an e-mail. “That is
why we are pleased to play a role helping to make Russia more
open to foreign investors.”  Asset Sales  The world’s largest energy exporter plans to raise a record
$10 billion from asset sales this year, First Deputy Prime
Minister  Igor Shuvalov  said in an interview with Bloomberg
Television last month. While corruption remains a concern, it’s
less so for foreign investors who have already committed to
Russia, Shuvalov said.  Led by Putin, 60, Russia ranked 133 out of 176 countries
and territories in Transparency International’s 2012 corruption
perceptions  index , tied with Iran, Kazakhstan and Honduras. The
U.S. Congress imposed a visa ban and asset freeze in December on
Russian officials allegedly linked to the death of lawyer  Sergei Magnitsky  and other human-rights abuses. Russia responded with a
law that bans U.S. adoptions of Russian children.  Goldman Sachs, the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets,
conducted a review of its  business standards  and practices and
released a set of recommendations in January 2011 to ensure the
standards treat clients fairly and “contribute to overall
financial stability and economic opportunity.”  Human Rights Foundation, based in New York, was founded in
2005 to raise awareness about “the vulnerability of freedom
around the world,” according to its  website .  “It’s appalling that Goldman Sachs sees nothing wrong with
defending a regime that has made a farce of the legal system,
ignored property rights and murdered and imprisoned brave men
and women who have sought to promote economic freedom,”
Kasparov said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
