Volvo AB , the world’s second-largest
truckmaker, said U.S. and European commercial-vehicle markets
will probably recover this year as global economic growth
rebounds. The shares rose the most in almost five months.  The manufacturer’s Renault Trucks brand will bring out new
models in mid-2013, building on the introduction of Volvo’s FH
lineup last year, amid a “gradually” improving industry, Chief
Executive Officer  Olof Persson  said today at a press conference.  Volvo, which ranks second to  Daimler AG  in global truck
sales, predicted that the European truck market will expand 4.1
percent this year to 230,000 vehicles. Industrywide sales in the
region fell in 2012 as the economy of the 17 nations sharing the
euro went into recession in the third quarter. The Gothenburg,
Sweden-based truckmaker  posted  an 84 percent drop in fourth-
quarter operating profit because of falling deliveries and
spending on a reorganization that included job cuts.  The quarter “marks the operational trough” after the
company “focused on clearing inventories,” Stefan Burgstaller,
an analyst at Goldman Sachs & Co., wrote in a report to
investors.  Volvo  jumped  as much as 4.3 percent to 96.9 kronor, the
biggest intraday gain since Sept. 14, and was trading up 4
percent at 10:22 a.m. in Stockholm. The shares have gained 8.9
percent this year, valuing the manufacturer at 205.8 billion
kronor ($32 billion).  Quarterly Plunge  Fourth-quarter earnings before interest and taxes plunged
to 1.12 billion kronor as sales declined 2.2 percent to 303.6
billion kronor. Net income dropped 83 percent to 793 million
kronor. Volvo plans an unchanged  dividend  of 3 kronor a share.  Persson predicted a “difficult” first quarter following
an order decline, “low” capacity utilization and spending on
research and model introductions. Volvo said it’s “investing
heavily” in new vehicles, including a range of cheaper trucks
for emerging markets.  The truckmaker eliminated about 2,000 jobs in the quarter,
with half of the cuts in Japan, and posted 990 million kronor in
costs as it reduced construction-equipment manufacturing and
ended busmaking in Sweden and closed a remanufacturing plant in
Japan. Volvo  employed  98,717 people globally at the end of 2012.  “The market believes in the long-term restructuring,”
analysts including David Arnold at Credit Suisse said in an e-
mail to clients.  Keeping Forecasts  Volvo , which also makes Mack trucks in North America,
reiterated a forecast that the region’s truck market this year
will about match the 250,000 deliveries estimated for 2012.
European industrywide sales last year probably totaled 221,000
trucks, Volvo said, a decline from an earlier estimate.  Demand in Brazil is expected to increase to 105,000 trucks,
compared to an earlier forecast of 95,000 vehicles.  Volvo’s fourth-quarter deliveries fell 15 percent to 58,626
trucks, while orders dropped 9.6 percent to 52,145 vehicles.
Europe accounted for 40 percent of deliveries and 36 percent of
orders.  Some production stoppages originally announced for March
and April at the Volvo brand were dropped, Persson said. Because
of strong order intake in South America, production levels will
be increased in March.  Volvo said Jan. 28 that a 5.6 billion-yuan ($899 million)
plan to buy a 45 percent stake in the truck unit of Chinese
manufacturer Dongfeng Motor Group Co. will help Volvo overtake
 Daimler  in worldwide commercial-vehicle sales. Volvo has a
target of completing the transaction, which will form a new
joint venture, within a year.  Russian Plant  Part of Volvo’s push outside its traditional markets
includes a plan outlined in September to invest almost 800
million kronor in a truck-cab factory in Kaluga, Russia, that
will start production in 2014.  Scania AB , the Swedish truckmaker controlled by  Volkswagen
AG , reported a 29 percent plunge in profit in 2012 because of
lower sales and production in Europe, which accounted for 45
percent of its deliveries. Volkswagen is pressing for closer
collaboration between Scania and MAN SE, the Munich-based
truckmaker that Volkswagen controls and is seeking to buy out.
Daimler is scheduled to release earnings figures tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
