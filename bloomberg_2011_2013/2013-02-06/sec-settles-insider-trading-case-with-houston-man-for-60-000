U.S. securities regulators settled an
insider-trading case with a Texas man who allegedly bought
National Semiconductor Corp. shares based on a tip about its
 acquisition  gleaned from his wife, a lawyer whose firm consulted
on the deal.  James Balchan of Houston agreed to pay almost $60,000 to
settle the lawsuit, the Securities and Exchange Commission said
in a statement today. Balchan bought National Semiconductor
shares in April 2011 after his wife told him in confidence about
the acquisition. The shares jumped more than 75 percent when
Dallas-based  Texas Instruments Inc.  announced that month it was
buying Santa Clara, California-based National Semiconductor for
about $6.5 billion.  Balchan sold the shares and made a $30,000 profit, the SEC
said. He agreed to disgorge the money and pay a civil fine of
about the same amount. Balchan didn’t admit or deny the
allegations. Stephanie McGuire, Balchan’s attorney, didn’t
immediately respond to an e-mail seeking comment about the
settlement.  “Spouses or other members of an attorney’s family may
learn highly confidential information about a company when
having a casual conversation,”  Marc Fagel , director of the
SEC’s San Francisco regional office, said in the statement.
“Using that confidential information to buy or sell stock as
Balchan did is not only a breach of trust, but also a violation
of the federal securities laws.”  The case is SEC v Balchan, 13-298, U.S. District Court,
Southern District of Texas (Houston).  To contact the reporter on this story:
