Japanese stocks  may extend their
rally by more than 10 percent in the next three months after
breaking through a key resistance level, according to a
technical analyst at Natixis.  The Nikkei 225 Stock Average broke the resistance area of
between 11,312 and 11,408 yesterday, a sign the gauge will
prolong its upward trend,  Ouri Mimran  said in a telephone
interview from Paris.  “We’ve seen a 38 percent retracement of the downtrend
since the 2007 top and April 2010 top,” Mimran said. “The
gauge is moving toward the next long-term resistance level of
12,646,” implying an advance of more than 10 percent from
current levels.  The  Nikkei 225  rose to 11,463.75 yesterday, its highest
level since September 2008. Bank of Japan Governor  Masaaki Shirakawa  said he will step down almost three weeks ahead of
schedule, accelerating a leadership transition that may aid
Prime Minister  Shinzo Abe ’s campaign to weaken the yen to defeat
deflation and lead the country out of recession.  “If the market continues to go higher in the next
sessions, the current intermediate resistance level of 12,200
may become the new support level,” Mimran said. “We think the
probability of a consolidation is low.”  The gauge has rallied 10 percent so far this year and
capped a 12-week advance on Feb. 1, the longest such winning
streak in 53 years, according to Nikkei Inc.  A pullback to below 10,255 would invalidate the bullish
scenario, Mimran said.  In technical analysis, investors study charts of trading
patterns and prices to predict changes in a stock, commodity,
currency or index. Analysts identify resistance levels, or
ceilings limiting further gains, and supports, which act as
floors in a declining market.  To contact the reporter on this story:
