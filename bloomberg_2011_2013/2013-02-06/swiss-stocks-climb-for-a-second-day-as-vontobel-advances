Swiss stocks  climbed for a second day
as Vontobel Holding AG reported earnings.  Vontobel climbed 2.8 percent after posting a 15 percent
increase in full-year profit as the bank attracted new client
funds. Syngenta AG slipped 2.1 percent after the world’s largest
agrochemical company reported full-year earnings that fell short
of analysts’ estimates.  The  Swiss Market Index  rose 0.3 percent to 7,425.66 at 9:34
a.m. in Zurich, rebounding from a decline of as much as 0.2
percent. The equity benchmark has rallied 8.9 percent this year
as the Swiss franc weakened against the euro and U.S. lawmakers
agreed on a compromise budget. The broader Swiss Performance
Index also advanced 0.3 percent today.  The volume of shares changing hands in SMI-listed companies
was 35 percent lower than the average of the last 30 days, data
compiled by Bloomberg showed.  Vontobel climbed 80 centimes to 29.40 francs as the Swiss
bank and brokerage that specializes in derivatives reported that
net income rose to 130.6 million Swiss francs ($143 million)
from 113.7 million francs a year earlier. That beat the 125
million-franc  estimate of five analysts  surveyed by Bloomberg.  Givaudan SA  added 1.5 percent to 1,086 francs. Deutsche
Bank AG upgraded the world’s biggest maker of flavorings and
fragrances to hold from sell.  Sulzer AG advanced 2 percent to 150.50 francs after
Citigroup Inc. initiated coverage with a buy rating.  Syngenta lost 8.10 francs to 387.40 francs after reporting
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization
of $3.15 billion in 2012. The  average analyst estimate  had
called for Ebitda of $3.19 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
