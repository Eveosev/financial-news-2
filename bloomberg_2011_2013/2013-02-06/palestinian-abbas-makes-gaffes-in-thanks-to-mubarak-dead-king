Once bitten, though apparently not
twice shy, Palestinian President  Mahmoud Abbas  referred to his
Egyptian host by using the name of ousted President  Hosni Mubarak  and then upped the ante by thanking Morocco’s  King Mohamed  V, who happens to be dead.  After a warm introduction by Egyptian President  Mohamed Mursi , Abbas expressed his thanks to “Mohamed Hosni” before
quickly correcting himself and saying “Mohamed Mursi.”  Hours later, in the second session of an Islamic summit in
Cairo, he expressed thanks to “King Mohamed V for your words”
before being corrected by a smiling Moroccan official who
reminded him that monarch had died and the current king was
Mohamed VI.  To contact the reporter on this story:
