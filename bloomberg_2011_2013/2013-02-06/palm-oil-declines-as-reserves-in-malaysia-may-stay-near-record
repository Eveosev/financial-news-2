Palm oil declined to a one-week low
on concern that inventories in Malaysia, the biggest supplier
after Indonesia, will stay near a record even as production
decreases because of the low-output season.  The contract for delivery in April ended at 2,547 ringgit
($822) a metric ton on the Malaysia Derivatives Exchange, the
lowest price at close for the most-active contract since Jan.
30. Futures have gained 4.5 percent this year.  Inventories  of the oil used in food and biofuels fell 3.8
percent to 2.53 million tons in January from the record a month
earlier, according to the median of estimates from four analysts
and two plantation companies in a Bloomberg survey published
today. Production slumped 15 percent, the most since December
2010, to 1.51 million tons, while  exports  dropped 7.9 percent to
1.52 million tons, the median of five estimates shows. The
Malaysian Palm Oil Board is due to release the data on Feb. 13.  Reserves at these levels are still high, said  Chandran Sinnasamy , head of trading at LT International Futures Sdn. in
Kuala Lumpur, referring to the survey figure. Output is
typically lowest in January and February each year.  The median estimate for  output  in the survey was 17 percent
higher than 1.29 million tons produced in January 2012, board
data show. That should keep the inventory above 2 million tons
throughout the first quarter,  Alan Lim Seong Chun , an analyst at
Kenanga Investment Bank Bhd., wrote in a report yesterday.  Malaysia will allow crude palm oil exports at zero duty for
a third month in March if prices remain below a threshold of
2,250 ringgit a ton, Plantation Industries and Commodities
Minister  Bernard Dompok  said Feb. 4. The country set the tariff
at zero in January and extended it to February to clear the
reserves.  Soybeans for March delivery declined 0.7 percent $14.845 a
bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, while soybean oil for
March delivery lost 0.8 percent to 52.54 cents a pound.  Refined palm oil for delivery in September declined 0.3
percent to close at 7,136 yuan ($1,145) a ton on the Dalian
Commodity Exchange. Soybean oil for delivery in the same month
ended little changed at 8,810 yuan a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
