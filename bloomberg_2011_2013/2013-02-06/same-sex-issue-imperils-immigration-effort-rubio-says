Insistence on equal treatment for
same-sex couples may scuttle bipartisan efforts to overhaul U.S.
immigration law if it becomes a central issue in the debate, a
Republican author of a Senate blueprint said.  Senator  Marco Rubio , a Florida Republican who is backing an
immigration-overhaul framework unveiled last week, said today
the “issue has so many land mines and pitfalls that it’s going
to be hard enough to do” without inserting marriage questions.  President  Barack Obama , who unveiled his own push for an
immigration overhaul in Nevada a day after the Senate plan was
released, supports equal treatment of same-sex couples when one
partner is from outside the U.S. That provision isn’t in the
Senate framework, and may draw opposition from Republicans.  “If that issue becomes a central issue in the debate, it’s
just going to make it harder to get done,” Rubio said at an
event in Washington sponsored by BuzzFeed Inc. “There’s going
to be a lot of strong feelings about it on both sides.”  The bipartisan Senate group hasn’t “really discussed the
pros and the cons of it,” Rubio said.  The freshman lawmaker, elected to the Senate in 2010, is
viewed as a potential 2016 presidential candidate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
