U.S. Defense Secretary  Leon Panetta 
decided to delay the deployment of an aircraft carrier to the
Persian Gulf region to save money as budget cuts loom, Pentagon
spokesman  George Little  said today.  The USS Harry S. Truman and the cruiser USS Gettysburg had
been scheduled to leave the East Coast later this week, Little
said in a statement. The Truman is based in Norfolk, Virginia,
and the Gettysburg is based in Mayport, Florida, according to
the Defense Department.  The decision will leave one carrier on duty in the region
instead of the two that have been maintained there much of the
time since the middle of last year.  The indefinite delay came in response to “budget
uncertainty” generated partly from automatic across-the-board
cuts that will begin next month unless Congress and President
 Barack Obama  agree on an alternative deficit-reduction plan,
Little said.  “This prudent decision enables the U.S. Navy to maintain
these ships to deploy on short notice in the event they are
needed to respond to national security contingencies,” Little
said.  The delayed deployment is the latest cost-saving move the
Pentagon has announced in response to the pending cuts that
would shave about $45 billion from the Pentagon’s budget by
Sept. 30.  The Pentagon has issued a memo authorizing the firing of
temporary defense workers and furloughs for civilian employees.  Panetta today called the automatic cuts known as
sequestration “the most serious readiness crisis in over a
decade.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
