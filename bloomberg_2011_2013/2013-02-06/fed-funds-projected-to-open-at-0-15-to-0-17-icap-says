Fed funds, the U.S. overnight inter-
bank lending  rate , is projected to open at 0.15 percent to 0.17
percent, within the Federal Reserve’s target of zero to 0.25
percent.  Fed funds closed at 0.07 percent yesterday after trading
from 0.07 percent to 0.15 percent and averaging 0.12 percent,
according to ICAP Plc, the world’s largest inter-dealer broker.  The central bank will acquire $3 billion to $3.75 billion
of Treasuries maturing from November 2018 to January 2020. The
purchases are part of the Fed’s latest round of debt purchases,
known as quantitative easing, aimed to keep long-term rates low
and support economic growth.  To contact the reporter on this story:
