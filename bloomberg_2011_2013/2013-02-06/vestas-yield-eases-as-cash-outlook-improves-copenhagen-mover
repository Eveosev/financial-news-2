The yield on  Vestas Wind Systems A/S ’
benchmark 2015 note fell the most in more than three months in
Copenhagen trading after the world’s largest maker of wind
turbines said its cash outlook improved.  The yield on Vestas’ 4.625 percent 600 million-euro ($785
million) bond maturing in 2015 fell 214 basis points, or 2.14
percentage points, to 16.42 percent, the biggest decline since
Nov. 26, according to Composite Bloomberg Bond Trader prices.
The company’s stock rose the most in a month after fourth-
quarter revenue exceeded analyst estimates.  Vestas said today its free cash flows rose to a five-year
high in the fourth quarter, enabling the Aarhus, Denmark-based
company to reduce its net debt by about 30 percent. The turbine
maker, which is struggling to make a profit as overcapacity in
the industry squeezes margins, said today its cash flow will be
positive this year after a 2012 outflow.  “The positive cash flows are particularly important as
they allow Vestas to substantially reduce its debt, which is one
of our priority areas,” Vestas said in the statement.  Vestas had free cash flow of 416 million euros ($563
million) in the fourth quarter, paring 2012’s outflow to 359
million euros. Net debt declined to 900 million euros from 1.29
billion euros over the quarter. Sales rose 25 percent from a
year earlier to 2.5 billion euros, exceeding the average
estimate of 2.3 billion euros in a survey of 14 analysts.  Vestas  shares  rose as much as 12 percent today, the most
since Jan. 2.  To contact the reporter on this story:
