Yields on Mexico’s peso bonds fell to
record lows before a government report forecast to show
inflation slowed to a 16-month low in January.  The yield on the government’s peso-denominated debt due in
December dropped four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to
4.3 percent at 4 p.m. in Mexico City, the lowest closing level
since the bonds were first issued in 2004, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The peso dropped 0.4 percent to 12.6819
per dollar, the worst performance among major Latin American
currencies.  Analysts estimate that a national statistics agency report
due tomorrow will show the annual inflation rate fell to 3.17
percent last month, the lowest since September 2011. Central
bank board members said in the minutes of last month’s policy
meeting, released Feb. 1, that slower inflation appears to be
gaining traction while risks to growth persist, fueling
speculation they’ll cut borrowing costs this year.  “If inflation continues to ease and the peso remains
stable, rate cut prospects are likely to strengthen and drive
yields lower,”  Aryam Vazquez , a New York-based economist at
Wells Fargo & Co., said in an e-mailed message. “Certainly
inflation and rate expectations are a driving force.”  The yield on Mexico’s peso-denominated bond due in 2024
fell one basis point to 5.06 percent, also a record low closing
level.  To contact the reporter on this story:
