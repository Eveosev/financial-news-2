Thailand’s baht snapped a three-day
rally on concern the central bank will intervene to slow an
appreciation that hurts exports. Government bonds were steady.  Finance Minister Kittiratt Na-Ranong said Jan. 31 there’s
concern a strong baht will hurt tourism and overseas sales. He
wrote to the central bank’s board last week requesting a cut in
the policy rate to help reduce inflows, the Bangkok Post
reported today. Global funds bought $4.8 billion more sovereign
debt than they sold this year through yesterday, official data
show. Thailand’s 10-year bonds yield 3.63 percent, compared with
2.01 percent in  the U.S.  and 0.78 percent in Japan.  “It’s the intervention concern that is limiting gains in
the baht,” said Hideki Hayashi, a researcher at the Japan
Center for Economic Research in Tokyo. “The trend of fund
inflows into Asia remains intact, and that will continue to put
appreciation pressure on the region’s currencies.”  The baht fell 0.1 percent to 29.76 per dollar as of 9:02
a.m. in Bangkok, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It
touched 29.66 on Jan. 21 and Jan. 31, the strongest level since
August 2011.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves
in the exchange rate used to price options, dropped 17 basis
points, or 0.17 percentage point, to 5.5 percent.  Finance Minister Kittiratt said last month that Thailand’s
relatively higher benchmark interest rate may also be a cause of
the baht’s appreciation. The Southeast Asian nation’s policy
rate is 2.75 percent, compared with a maximum of 0.25 percent in
the U.S. and 0.1 percent in Japan. The central bank will next
meet to review monetary policy on Feb. 20.  The yield on the government’s 3.625 percent bonds maturing
in June 2023 was unchanged at 3.63 percent, the lowest level in
a month, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
