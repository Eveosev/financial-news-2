Indonesia’s rupiah forwards gained
for a seventh day, the longest winning streak since July, after
data showed economic growth exceeded 6 percent for a third year,
bolstering demand for local assets.  Gross domestic product  increased 6.23 percent last year,
compared with 6.49 percent in 2011, the government reported
yesterday, with Finance Minister Agus Martowardojo predicting
expansion of as much as 6.8 percent this year. Global funds
added  2.41 trillion rupiah  ($248 million) to their local-
currency sovereign debt holdings last week, the most in almost
two months, government data show.  One-month non-deliverable forwards strengthened 0.1 percent
to 9,670 per dollar as of 8:50 a.m. in Jakarta, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. They have rebounded from a three-year low of
9,985 reached on Jan. 10 and Jan. 11. The contracts traded at a
0.1 percent premium to the spot rate, which fell 0.1 percent to
9,682, according to prices from local banks.  “Steady growth and a stable economy lends positive
sentiment for Indonesian notes,” said  Nurul Eti Nurbaeti , the
head of treasury research at PT Bank Negara Indonesia in Jakarta.
“The rupiah has found support near this level even as Bank
Indonesia reduces intervention, though it still closely monitors
the market.”  A daily  fixing  used to settle the derivatives was set at
9,695 yesterday by the Association of Banks in Singapore.
Today’s rate will be set at 11:30 a.m. in the city-state.  The rupiah’s one-month implied volatility, which measures
expected exchange-rate swings used to price options, was little
changed at 6.5 percent for a third day.  The yield on Indonesia’s 5.625 percent bonds due May 2023
was steady at 5.27 percent, prices from the Inter Dealer Market
Association show.  The government raised 1.5 trillion rupiah from its first
sale of Islamic notes in 2013 yesterday, with investor bids
exceeding the amount offered by 2.8 times, the debt management
office said in a statement on its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
