Japanese  shares  rose, with the Nikkei
225 Stock Average closing at the highest since September 2008,
as  Toyota Motor Corp.  raised its profit forecast and the yen
fell after Bank of Japan Governor Masaaki Shirakawa said he will
step down ahead of schedule.  Toyota rose 6.1 percent.  Mizuho Financial Group Inc.  jumped
5.2 percent to pace gains among banks on speculation Shirakawa’s
replacement will take further steps to end deflation.  Kawasaki
Kisen Kaisha Ltd.  led shippers higher as the currency’s weakness
boosted prospects for exports. Toyo Seikan Kaisha Ltd. soared 17
percent after raising its profit forecast.  The  Nikkei 225  gained 3.8 percent to close at 11,463.75 in
Tokyo, the highest since Sept. 29, 2008, two weeks Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc. filed for the biggest bankruptcy in U.S.
history. Volume today was 48 percent above the 30-day average.
The broader Topix Index advanced 3.1 percent to 968.82, with six
stocks rising for each that fell.  “Many market participants think Shirakawa lacked a
strategy to counter deflation and a strong yen,” said  Soichiro Monji , chief strategist at Tokyo-based Daiwa SB Investments
Ltd., which manages the equivalent of about 6 trillion yen ($64
billion). “That’s why stocks are rising with his departure
coming earlier than expected.”  The Topix has surged 34 percent since elections were
announced on Nov. 14 on optimism a new government will push for
aggressive stimulus. The gauge is trading at 1.14 times  book
value , compared with 2.1 for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and
1.45 for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  Earnings Analysis  Of the 182 companies on the Topix that have reported
earnings so far this quarter and for which Bloomberg has
estimates, 62 percent have exceeded profit expectations. Some 53
percent missed sales projections, the data show.  Toyota jumped 6.1 percent to 4,815 yen, the highest close
since Sept. 22, 2008. Japan’s biggest manufacturer raised its
forecast for net income in the year ending March by 10 percent
to 860 billion yen.  Toyo Seikan Kaisha, a maker of packaging products, soared
17 percent to 1,321 yen, capping the biggest daily advance since
1999, after raising its net income forecast by 60 percent.  Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. soared 10 percent to 533
yen, the highest since Sept. 3, 2008. Tatsuhiko Nojima, an
executive vice president for the Japanese heavy equipment maker,
said today it aims to turn a profit on Boeing Co.’s 787
Dreamliner production. Nojima said Mitsubishi Heavy sees no
impact on the manufacturing timetable after the planes were
grounded due to battery problems.  Shirakawa Departure  Shirakawa, 63, will step down two weeks early on March 19,
the same day as two deputy governors, he told reporters in Tokyo
yesterday. The transition is expected to help Abe’s campaign for
easing. The yen today touched the lowest level against the
dollar since May 2010 and the weakest since April 2010 versus
the euro.  “The market expects the next BOJ head and deputy governors
to be supportive of monetary easing,” said  Hiroichi Nishi , an
equities manager in Tokyo at SMBC Nikko Securities Inc. “An
earlier transition will keep up optimism for a weaker yen and an
end to deflation.”  Shippers gained as the yen dropped.  Nippon Yusen K.K. 
jumped 5.6 percent to 227 yen.  Mitsui O.S.K. Lines Ltd.  rose 5.9
percent to 324 yen.  Kawasaki Kisen  advanced 9.6 percent to 183
yen.  Mizuho advanced 5.2 percent to 202 yen and  Mitsubishi UFJ
Financial Group Inc. , Japan’s biggest lender, added 2.5 percent
to 533 yen.  Futures on the S&P 500 gained 0.1 percent today. The gauge
added 1 percent yesterday, as earnings topped forecasts and Dell
Inc. agreed to be taken private in the largest leveraged buyout
since the financial crisis.  Kao Corp., a maker of household products, jumped 7.8
percent to 2,782 yen after announcing a share buyback.  The Nikkei Stock Average Volatility Index added 4.2 percent
to 24.96, indicating traders expect a swing of about 7.2 percent
on the benchmark gauge over the next 30 days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
