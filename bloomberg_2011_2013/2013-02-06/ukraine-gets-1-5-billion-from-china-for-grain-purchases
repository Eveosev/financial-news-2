Ukraine received $1.5 billion from
the Export-Import Bank of China under a credit agreement to
finance grain purchases, the Eastern European country’s
Agriculture Minister  Mykola Prysyazhnyuk  said.  The money will be used by Ukraine’s state-managed Food and
Grain Corp. to forward-buy 2 million metric tons of barley,
wheat and corn from local producers, Prysyazhnyuk told reporters
today in the capital, Kiev. Another 2 million tons of grains
will be bought on spot markets, he said.  All grain will then be exported to China, the minister
said, without giving a timeframe.  To contact the reporter on this story:
