GameStop Corp. , the chain that gets
almost half its profit from used video games, fell the most in a
month after a website reported  Microsoft Corp. ’s next console
will block users from reselling titles.  GameStop fell 6 percent to $25.20 at the close in New York
trading, their biggest drop since Jan. 8. The shares have gained
7.6 percent in the past year.  Microsoft’s next console will include technology that
registers video games over the Internet and renders resold
titles useless, the gaming website  Edge.com  said today, without
saying where it got the information.  “We do not comment on rumors or speculation,” David
Dennis, a spokesman for Microsoft, said in an e-mail. “We are
always thinking about what is next for our platform, but we
don’t have anything further to share at this time.”  A spokesman for GameStop had no immediate comment.  Michael Olson , an analyst with Piper Jaffray Cos., disputed
the report in a research note and said the drop is a buying
opportunity.  “We are confident that both the new PlayStation and the
new Xbox will support used games,” Olson wrote.  GameStop, based in Grapevine, Texas, derived 27 percent of
its revenue from used video-games in the fiscal year that ended
in January 2012, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. About
46 percent of gross profit was derived from those products. In
its most recently reported quarter, used game sales were 28
percent of revenue and 43 percent of profit.  To contact the reporters on this story:
