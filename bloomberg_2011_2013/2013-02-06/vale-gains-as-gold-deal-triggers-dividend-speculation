Vale SA , the third-biggest mining
company by market value, rose for the first time in three days
after signing a $1.9 billion gold off-take agreement that
boosted speculation of a special dividend payment this year.  Vale, based in Rio de Janeiro,  rose  1.1 percent to 38.50
reais at the close in Sao Paulo, the third-best performer on the
the MSCI Brazil Materials  Index , which rose 0.6 percent.  Vale said in a  statement  yesterday that it agreed to sell
25 percent of its gold output at the Salobo copper mine in
Brazil and 70 percent from its Sudbury nickel mines in Canada to
Silver Wheaton Corp. for $1.9 billion in cash and 10 million
share warrants of the Vancouver-based precious metals finance
company. The deal removes project execution risk and gives Vale
more cash to consider boosting dividends or buying back stock,
said  Jonathan Brandt , an equity analyst at HSBC Holdings Plc.  “This was a great transaction,” he said in a note to
clients today. “Proceeds from this transaction, combined with
higher-than-expected iron-ore prices year to date, could imply a
special dividend or share buyback at some point this year.”  Vale is seeking to boost returns by trimming costs, cutting
investments and finding partners for projects as profits are
forecast to fall to a three-year low. The company’s agreement
with Silver Wheaton values its Salobo gold operations at $5.32
billion plus $400 per ounce delivered, it said in yesterday’s
statement. Silver Wheaton  rose  1.6 percent to C$36.80.  “The deal unlocks substantial value from our high-quality
base metals operations,” Vale said. “Vale is pursuing lower
costs and higher productivity.”  Vale produced 165,000 ounces of gold last year, 13 percent
less than in 2011, as by-product of its nickel and copper
operations in Sudbury, Sossego and Salobo, it  said  Feb. 1. The
company is ramping up production at Salobo after obtaining the
project’s operating license in November and output is expected
to reach an average of 286,000 ounces of gold in the next 10
years, peaking at 327,000 ounces in 2016, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
