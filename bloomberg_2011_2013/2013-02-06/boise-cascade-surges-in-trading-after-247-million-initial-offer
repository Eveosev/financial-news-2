Boise Cascade Co. , a U.S. producer of
wood products used in home construction, surged as much as 24
percent after raising $247 million in an initial public offering
that priced above an increased range.  The shares advanced 22 percent to $25.65 at 9:46 a.m. in
New York after earlier rising as high as $26. The Boise, Idaho-
based company yesterday sold 11.8 million shares, about a 28
percent stake, for $21 each, after offering them for $18 to $20.
Boise raised the range after originally setting it at $16 to
$18, regulatory filings show.  Boise completed its IPO after U.S.  new-home starts  in
December jumped 12 percent from the previous month to the
highest level since June 2008. The company benefited after U.S.
stocks rallied, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average marking
its best January since 1994 as U.S. lawmakers agreed on a budget
compromise and companies from  Mead Johnson Nutrition Co.  to
 Whirlpool Corp.  reported earnings that beat analysts’ estimates.  Madison Dearborn Partners LLC, the Chicago-based private
equity firm, continues to control Boise after the IPO, according
to regulatory filings. The company was formed in 2004 from
Madison Dearborn’s acquisition of OfficeMax Inc.’s forest
products and paper assets.  Boise plans to use $25 million from the sale to repay debt
under its revolving credit facility, according to its
prospectus. The remainder will be used for general corporate
purposes.  The company operates 18 wood-product factories and 31
distribution centers, making such products as plywood sheathing
and laminated-veneer lumber. Boise had earnings before interest,
taxes, depreciation and amortization of $80.1 million on sales
of $2.63 billion in the 12 months through Sept. 30, filings
show.  Bank of America Corp. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. led the
offering. The shares are listed on the New York Stock Exchange
under the symbol BCC.  To contact the reporter on this story:
