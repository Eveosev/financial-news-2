Philippine government bonds due 2032
fell after a rally that drove the yield to a record low last
week prompted some investors to judge the notes too expensive.
The peso was little changed.  The yield on the 5.875 percent securities due March 2032
rose two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 5.09 percent
as of 4:19 p.m. local time, according to prices from Tradition
Financial Services. The rate has fallen 52 basis points this
year and reached 5 percent on Feb. 1, the lowest level since the
securities were issued in February 2012.  The central bank reduced the interest paid on almost 1.7
trillion pesos ($42 billion) in special-deposit accounts on Jan.
24 to curb currency speculation. There are 215 billion pesos of
sovereign bonds and bills maturing this quarter, which should
support secondary-market prices, according to Bank of the
Philippine Islands.  “There’s still some upward bias on yields due to profit-
taking,” said  Jill Singian , a fixed-income portfolio manager at
Bank of the Philippine Islands in Manila. Bonds “continue to be
supported by portfolio re-balancing from the SDA cut and the
reinvestment requirements in the first quarter,” she said.  Philippine debt returned 3.2 percent in 2013, the most
among 10 Asian indexes compiled by HSBC Holdings Plc.  The peso was little changed at 40.655 per dollar in Manila,
according to Tullett Prebon Plc. It reached 40.550 on Jan. 14,
the strongest level since March 2008, and has advanced 1 percent
this year. One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected
moves in the exchange rate used to price options, dropped 25
basis points to 4.25 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
