C.H. Robinson Worldwide Inc. , an
arranger of freight shipments, led declines on the  Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index  after posting lower quarterly profit than
analysts estimated.  C.H. Robinson tumbled 9.9 percent to $60.41 at 11:41 a.m.
in New York. An earlier decline of 10.2 percent was the biggest
on an intraday basis since October 2011.  The logistics company’s fourth-quarter profit, excluding
purchases and divestitures, was 68 cents a share. That  missed 
the 70-cent average of estimates compiled by Bloomberg and
spurred at least two analysts to cut their  ratings  on the Eden
Prairie, Minnesota-based company.  C.H. Robinson is grappling with “increased competition
from rapidly expanding high-quality competitors,”  John Larkin ,
a Baltimore-based analyst at Stifel Financial Corp. with a sell
rating on the shares, wrote in a note today. “The company will
suffer from the law of large numbers and post unimpressive”
earnings growth.  To contact the reporter on this story:
