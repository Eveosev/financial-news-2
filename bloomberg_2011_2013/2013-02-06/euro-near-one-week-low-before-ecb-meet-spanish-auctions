The euro traded within 0.5 percent of
a one-week low versus the dollar before European Central Bank
policy makers meet today amid political turmoil that threatens
to renew the region’s sovereign-debt crisis.  The 17-nation currency weakened from its highest since
April 2010 against the yen before Spain prepares to auction
bonds today amid calls for Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy to
resign. ECB President Mario Draghi may indicate concern the
economy is weak even as the bank hold rates, according to
analysts. The New Zealand dollar fell after a government report
pointed to a weak employment trend.  “Given the euro’s strength, Draghi is likely to remind us
that the economy is still weak rather than giving some
optimistic comments,” said  Kikuko Takeda , a senior currency
economist in London at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd. “I see
the euro falling at a modest pace in the mid- to long-term.”  The  euro  was little changed at $1.3533 at 6:57 a.m. in
London from $1.3523 in New York. It reached $1.3459 on Feb. 5,
the least since Jan. 29. The shared currency was 126.73 yen from
126.63 after yesterday touching 127.71, the strongest since
April 2010. The yen traded little changed at 93.62 per dollar
after depreciating to 94.06 yesterday, the weakest since May
2010.  The ECB, which has held its main refinancing rate at 0.75
percent since July, will make no change today, according to all
60 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News. ECB President Mario
Draghi may make more dovish remarks, according to analysts.  Easing Options  “Our economists suggest that Mr. Draghi will probably
soften the overall tone at the press conference, signaling that
easing options are still available if needed,” New York-based
 Vassili Serebriakov , a currency strategist at BNP Paribas SA,
wrote in a note to clients dated yesterday. “There are plenty
of reasons to justify a more defensive euro tone.”  Spain will auction securities due in 2015, 2018 and 2029
today after the nation’s benchmark 10-year  bond yield  rose 24
basis points, or 0.24 percentage point, this week to 5.45
percent yesterday.  Prime Minister Rajoy faced calls to step down amid
contested reports of corruption in his party. He has imposed the
harshest austerity measures in Spain’s democratic history to
curb the budget deficit and lower borrowing costs.  Competitive Devaluation  Declines in the yen against the U.S. dollar may be over for
now as Japanese officials probably judge this year’s more than 7
percent drop to be sufficient, according to Royal Bank of
Scotland Plc. Finance Minister  Taro Aso  said today Japan’s
monetary easing was not aimed at competitive currency
devaluation. Instead, it was an effort to spur the nation out of
deflation.  “There is also a subtle shift in the rhetoric from the
government that suggests that it thinks it has done enough to
weaken the yen for now,” Singapore-based  Greg Gibbs , a currency
strategist at RBS, wrote in a note to clients dated today.
“Tactically it makes sense to tone down the currency rhetoric
for now.”  The yen has tumbled 8 percent this year, the biggest
decline among 10 developed-nation currencies tracked by
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The euro has risen 3
percent, the best performance, and the dollar has added 0.1
percent.  Kiwi Slumps  New Zealand’s currency fell 0.3 percent to 78.39 yen and
also slid 0.3 percent to 83.74 U.S. cents after employment
declined for a third quarter. Payrolls slumped 1 percent, or
23,000 jobs, in the final three months of 2012, the statistics
bureau said today. The workforce participation rate reached the
lowest in eight years.  “The fall in the currency was to be expected given the
drop in employment and the participation rate, but we look at
these levels as a chance to buy the dips, particularly against
the Aussie dollar,” said  Mike Jones , a currency strategist at
Bank of New Zealand in Wellington.  Australia’s currency maintained a drop against the yen from
yesterday after the statistics bureau said employers cut 9,800
 full-time positions  in January even as the jobless rate remained
unchanged at 5.4 percent. The so-called Aussie fetched 96.70
yen, following a 0.7 percent decline to 96.63 yesterday.  To contact the reporters on this story:
