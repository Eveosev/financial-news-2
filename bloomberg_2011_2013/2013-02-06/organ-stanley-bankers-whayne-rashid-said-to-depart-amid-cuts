Morgan Stanley  investment bankers
 Thomas Whayne , who worked with media and telecommunications
companies, and Karim Rashid, an energy banker, have left the
firm, two people briefed on the departures said yesterday.  Joseph Kasper , 49, a managing director in the company’s
trading division, and investment banker  Miguel Espinosa  also
left the New York-based bank, said the people, who asked not to
be identified because the exits aren’t public.  Mark Lake , a
Morgan Stanley spokesman, declined to comment.  The bank said it was eliminating 1,700 jobs last month as
Chief Executive Officer  James Gorman , 54, pursues $1.6 billion
of annual savings during the next two years. Morgan Stanley cut
about 4,500 jobs in 2012.  Whayne, 47, advised on deals including Time Warner Cable
Inc.’s 2009 spinoff from Time Warner Inc. He joined Morgan
Stanley in 2005 after working at Bank of America Corp. and
Credit Suisse First Boston, according to Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority records.  Rashid joined Morgan Stanley in 1998 and was named a
managing director in 2005. Kasper became a managing director the
same year after being hired in 2000. Espinosa has worked at the
bank since 2000, Finra records show. He was named a managing
director in 2008.  Whayne declined to comment. Rashid and Kasper didn’t return
calls seeking comment, while contact information for Espinosa
couldn’t immediately be obtained.  To contact the reporter on this story:
