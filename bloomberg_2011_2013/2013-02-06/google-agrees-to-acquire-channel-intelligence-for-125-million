Google Inc., operator of the world’s
largest search engine, has agreed to buy Channel Intelligence
Inc. for $125 million, adding online marketing tools that
retailers use to bolster Internet sales.  The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter,
according to a statement from Radnor, Pennsylvania-based ICG
Group Inc., which jointly owns Channel Intelligence with Aweida
Capital Management. Channel Intelligence helps retailers refine
online sales pitches and promote goods on Facebook Inc.’s social
network.  Google is stepping up efforts in e-commerce after
announcing plans last year to transition its product-
search feature to a paid commercial model in the U.S., requiring
retailers to purchase space on the new Google Shopping service.
In November, Google acquired BufferBox Inc., a service for
delivering e-commerce goods to physical kiosks.  “Our vision for CI started with the desire to simplify the
online shopping experience,” Rob Wight, founder and chief
executive of Channel Intelligence, said in the statement.  ICG’s shares advanced 4.3 percent to $12.56 at 10:22 a.m.
in New York, and earlier touched $12.81 for the biggest intraday
gain since November 2011. Google rose less than 1 percent to
$769.25.  To contact the reporter on this story:
