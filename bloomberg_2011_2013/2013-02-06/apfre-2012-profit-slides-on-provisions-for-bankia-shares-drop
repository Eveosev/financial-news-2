Mapfre SA , Spain’s biggest insurer,
said profit last year fell 31 percent, missing analysts’
estimates, as it booked provisions to cover assets including a
stake in nationalized lender  Bankia SA . The shares slumped.  Net income  slid to 665.7 million euros ($900.4 million)
from 963 million euros in 2011, the Madrid-based company said in
a filing to regulators today.  Earnings  compared with the average
897 million-euro estimate of 13 analysts who provided figures
within the last 28 days.  Mapfre is relying on growth in  markets  in Latin America
such as Brazil to help compensate for its business in Spain,
where premiums are shrinking due to a recession. The insurer
said it acted “prudently” to clean up its balance sheet by
setting aside the 404.8 million euros in provisions to cover
real estate and financial assets, along with stakes in Bankia
and Italy’s  Societa Cattolica di Assicurazioni SCRL .  The company dropped 2.6 percent to 2.17 euros at 12:58 p.m.
in Madrid, the biggest decline on the 33-member  Stoxx 600
Insurance Index , which lost 0.5 percent.  Mapfre increased premiums last year by 10 percent to 21.6
billion euros and revenue by 7.5 percent to 25.3 billion euros,
it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
