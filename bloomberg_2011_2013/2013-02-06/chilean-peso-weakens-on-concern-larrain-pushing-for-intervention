Chile’s peso closed little changed
for the fourth time in five days as concern that the central
bank or government would try to stem its gains offset data
showing the economy grew faster than forecast.  The peso rose less than 0.1 percent to 472.69 per U.S.
dollar from 472.88 per dollar yesterday. It has gained 1.4
percent in 2013.  Chile’s currency has held in a range between 470 and 475
per dollar for the last eight sessions. Faster-than-forecast
growth in December and the expectation that the central bank may
raise rates this year have prevented it from weakening, while
intervention concern has kept it from appreciating through 470
per dollar.  “We still believe the central bank won’t do anything,”
said  Felipe Hernandez , an economist at Royal Bank of Scotland
Plc in Stamford, Connecticut. “It doesn’t make any sense for
them to use their limited resources to intervene when the market
itself has built a strong resistance at 470 per dollar. Local
investors are convinced there’s a risk of intervention below
470, but they are happy to go long pesos at 473 or 474 per
dollar.”  Chilean economic activity expanded 4.7 percent in December
from a year earlier, the central bank said yesterday. The median
estimate of 16 economists surveyed by Bloomberg was 3.7 percent.  The peso climbed to its strongest level since March 2008 in
December, according to a trade-weighted index published by the
central bank. Chile’s central bank intervened in the currency by
buying dollars in April 2008 and again in January 2011.  International investors in the Chilean peso forwards market
increased bets against the peso to $914 million on Feb. 4 from a
16-month low of $671 million on Jan. 31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
