Shutterfly Inc.  soared the most in
more than three years after forecasting 2013 sales that were
higher than analysts estimated as marketing and mobile tools
help the online photo-sharing service expand its customer base.  The shares gained 20 percent to $40.40 at the close in New
York, the biggest one-day advance since April 2009. The Redwood
City, California-based company’s shares have increased 43
percent in the past 12 months,  while  the Russell 2000 Index has
gained 10 percent.  Shutterfly, which turns digital photos into products such
as photo books and greeting cards, said annual sales will rise
as much as 17 percent as marketing, including a ship-to-store
partnership with  Costco Wholesale Corp. , helps add customers.
Consolidation in the market for Web-based photo services will
help Shutterfly bolster revenue, said  Victor Anthony , an analyst
at Topeka Capital Markets.  “Shutterfly, with its innovative suite of product
offerings, is taking share from profitability-challenged
competitors,” Anthony, who is based in New York, said in a note
today. He increased his price target to $45 from $40 and
maintained his buy rating on the shares.  Annual sales for 2013 will increase to $739.7 million to
$746 million. Analysts projected $709.4 million, the average of
 estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  Fourth-quarter revenue rose 33 percent to $351.8 million,
beating the $310.1 million average of analysts’ estimates.  Corporate Business  Transacting customers last year rose 31 percent to 7.1
million, while orders gained 29 percent to 16.3 million,
according to a statement yesterday. The average order value fell
2 percent to $37.58, the company said.  “The vast majority of our new customer growth was organic,
driven by our integrated marketing campaigns,” Chief Executive
Officer  Jeffrey T. Housenbold  said on a conference call
yesterday.  Corporate sales, which accounted for 2.4 percent of total
revenue in the quarter, jumped 79 percent to $8.3 million, the
company said.  Shutterfly added new clients last year, including
UnitedHealth Group and expanded existing relationships with  AT&T
Inc.  and  Dell Inc. , Housenbold said on the call.  Corporate businesses should ease Shutterfly’s dependence on
December holiday sales, said  Brian Fitzgerald , a New York-based
analyst for Jefferies & Co., who has a hold rating on the stock.  “The enterprise business, which is small, is growing
rapidly,” he said in a telephone interview. “It will smooth
out their earnings over the year.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
