Honduras rallied for a 2-1 home win
against the U.S., Jamaica earned a goalless tie in Mexico and
Costa Rica got a 2-2 draw in Panama as the last stage of
qualifying for the 2014 soccer World Cup got under way in North
and Central America and the Caribbean.  Clint Dempsey  gave the U.S. the lead after 36 minutes at
the Estadio Olimpico in San Pedro Sula yesterday. Juan Carlos
Garcia tied it three minutes later and Jerry Bengtson got the
winning goal for Honduras in the 79th minute.  “There were too many mistakes done and too many players
today just didn’t reach their usual potential,” U.S. coach
 Jurgen Klinsmann  told reporters. “We didn’t find our passing
flow, we didn’t combine well enough, we didn’t hold the ball
well enough.”  The defeat is the first for the U.S. since 1989 in the
opening game of the final round of World Cup qualifying. After
failing to play in the World Cup from 1954 through 1986, the
U.S. has qualified for every edition since 1990, making the
quarterfinals in 2002 and the round of 16 in 1994 and 2010.  Dempsey got his 31st goal for the national team with a
volley over goalkeeper  Noel Valladares . Garcia tied it with an
overhead kick from about 10 yards (9 meters) and Bengtson tapped
into an empty net when U.S. goalkeeper  Tim Howard  failed to win
the ball after rushing out of his goal to thwart an attack.  Before yesterday, the U.S. had won nine of 10 meetings with
Honduras and all three of its prior games in San Pedro Sula.  The Americans next host Costa Rica on March 22 in Commerce
City, Colorado.  Jamaica Draws  Jamaica earned a 0-0 draw last night at the Azteca Stadium
in Mexico City, where Mexico has lost one World Cup qualifier
since the stadium opened in 1966. Mexico is the highest-ranked
Concacaf country, at No. 15 in FIFA’s rankings, 43 places ahead
of Jamaica.  In Panama City, the home team led 2-0 after 27 minutes
through goals by Luis Henriquez and Roman Torres. Alvaro Saborio
scored for Costa Rica five minutes before halftime and Brian
Ruiz tied it in the 84th minute.  The top three teams in the Concacaf region advance to the
World Cup, with the fourth-place finisher entering a two-game
playoff against the winner of the Oceania group.  Soccer’s global championship is scheduled from June 12 to
July 13, 2014, in Brazil.  To contact the reporter on this story:
