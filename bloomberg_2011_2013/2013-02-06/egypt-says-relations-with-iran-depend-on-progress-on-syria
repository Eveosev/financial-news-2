Egypt says “deepening” relations
with Iran depend on achieving progress on different issues
including the Syrian conflict, the state-run Ahram Gate website
said.  Egyptian President Mohamed Mursi said Iran is capable of
becoming part of a solution in Syria, Ahram Gate said, citing
presidential spokesman Yasser Ali.  Iran-Egypt convergence also depends on the public
acceptance of such relations, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
