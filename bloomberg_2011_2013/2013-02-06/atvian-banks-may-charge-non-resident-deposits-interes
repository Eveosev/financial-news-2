Latvian banks are considering
charging interest on non-resident deposits,  Dienas Bizness 
reported, citing Kristaps Zakulis, the head of the countryâ€™s
bank regulator.  Non-resident deposits made up 48.9 percent of system-wide
deposits in December, or about 6.1 billion lati ($11.8 billion),
the Riga-based newspaper said. About 80 percent of the non-
resident deposits are held on demand at Latvian banks,  the
newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
