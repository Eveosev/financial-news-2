OAO Lukoil ’s billionaire Chief
Executive Officer  Vagit Alekperov , who owns about a fifth of the
Russian oil producer, arranged for his son Yusuf to maintain his
holding beyond his death.  “I’ve already arranged for my stake, even if I leave this
life, to be indivisible to secure the company’s stability for
many years ahead,” Alekperov said in an  interview  on Ekho
Moskvy radio late yesterday. “My son won’t have the right to
split and sell it.”  Alekperov, 62, owns more than 20 percent of Lukoil,
Russia’s second-largest oil producer and the country’s biggest
non-state energy company. His son Yusuf, a graduate of Gubkin
Russian State University of Oil and Gas, works at oilfields in
western Siberia as a technologist, according to the CEO.  “He must follow that path and see how people work at
fields,” Alekperov said, adding that he isn’t preparing Yusuf
to replace him. “Let him choose his fate for himself.”  The billionaire said he “always buys shares” in Lukoil
and neither he nor other key holders offer them for sale on the
market. The company is trading at half its true value, he said.  Lukoil shares have risen 12 percent in the past year,
valuing the Moscow-based company at 1.7 trillion rubles ($57.2
billion). Alekperov’s net worth is estimated at $13.2 billion,
according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
