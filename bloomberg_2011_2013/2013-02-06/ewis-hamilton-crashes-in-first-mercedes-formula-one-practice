Lewis Hamilton , the 2008 Formula One
champion, crashed into a barrier on his first day of practice
with the Mercedes team.  The 28-year-old Englishman’s racing car had a loss of rear
brake pressure at the Circuito de Jerez in southern Spain and he
couldn’t stop it plowing into a tire wall, the team said on its
Twitter feed. He wasn’t hurt.  Mercedes said it had to cut short testing for the day
because of damage to the car’s nose cone. Hamilton’s teammate
 Nico Rosberg  was restricted to 14 laps of driving yesterday
because of an electrical fault.  Hamilton ended a 15-year association with McLaren after
last season to replace seven-time champion  Michael Schumacher  at
Mercedes. The Formula One season opens in Melbourne on March 17.  To contact the reporters on this story:
