Lebanon approved conditions for
companies to bid in the nation’s first offshore oil and natural
gas licensing round as it seeks to catch up with neighbors
Israel and Cyprus in developing fuel reserves.  The decision was made today at a weekly cabinet meeting,
Information Minister  Walid Daouk  told reporters after the
session in Beirut.  Royal Dutch Shell Plc ,  Cairn Energy Plc  and  Cove Energy Plc 
are among companies expressing interest in bidding for a
license. OAO Lukoil is interested and is holding talks on
possible Lebanese offshore projects, Interfax said Jan. 23,
citing CEO  Vagit Alekperov .  A list of qualified explorers is expected to be issued by
March 31 and they can place bids starting May 2 for six months,
Minister of Social Affairs  Wael Bou Faour  said Dec. 27.
Exploration will proceed in waters close to those of Israel and
Cyprus, where  Noble Energy Inc . found gas. The Leviathan field,
discovered in 2010 in Israel’s deep waters, was the world’s
largest find of its kind in a decade.  Lebanon, which passed an oil and gas law in 2010 and
appointed a six-member petroleum board in November, faced
political divisions that have delayed action on energy
exploration. Revenues from oil and gas reserves may help reduce
its debt burden, the largest in the Arab world. The country is
running a debt of $56 billion, equivalent to 135 percent of its
annual economic output.  To contact the reporter on this story:
