Cemex Latam Holdings SA , a cement
maker with operations in Central and South America, rose to a
record after the company said a measure of profit surged 38
percent in the fourth quarter as revenue climbed 23 percent.  Shares rose 0.9 percent to 13,400 pesos at 10:06 a.m. in
Bogota. Earlier they rose 1.7 percent to 13,500 pesos, the
highest on an intraday basis since they started trading in
November. The shares  have climbed  more than 9 percent since
then.  Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization, or Ebitda, from operations rose to $141 million in
the last three months of 2012 as net sales increased to $404
million, the Bogota-based company said today in a filing.  “A very positive surprise was their Ebitda margin, helped
by good results in Colombia as they kept costs under control,”
said  Esteban Polidura , a Deutsche Bank AG analyst in Mexico
City. “The only thing that could hold back the stock is if it’s
seen as too expensive after its gain.”  Net income was $88 million, the company said without giving
the amount for a year earlier.  The earnings report was Cemex Latam’s first as a publicly
traded company, after its Monterrey, Mexico-based parent Cemex
SAB sold shares in Cemex Latam in November.  To contact the reporter on this story:
