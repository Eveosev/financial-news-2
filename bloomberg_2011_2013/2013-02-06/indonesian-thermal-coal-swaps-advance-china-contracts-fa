Swaps prices gained for thermal coal
loading from Indonesia, the world’s largest exporter of the
fuel, according to Ginga Petroleum Singapore Pte.  The contract for Indonesian sub-bituminous coal with a
calorific value of 4,900 kilocalories a kilogram in the second
quarter rose 15 cents to $66.30 a metric ton on a net-as-
received yesterday, Ginga said in an e-mail today. The March
contract held at $65 a ton.  Contracts for coal with a heating value of 5,500
kilocalories a kilogram for shipment to South China in the
second quarter fell 10 cents to $87 a ton, the energy broker
said. The swap for March added 10 cents to $85.85 a ton.  China will continue to import Indonesia’s low calorific
value coal while India will marginally increases purchases of
the fuel,  Prama Chusnun , an analyst at BNP Paribas, wrote in a
note today. Exports to Japan, Korea and Taiwan will be stable
and domestic demand may grow with new power plants, according to
the report.  A commodity swap is a financial agreement whereby a
floating price is exchanged for a fixed rate over a specified
contract period. About 60 percent of Indonesia’s coal is
classified as sub-bituminous. Higher moisture levels and a lower
carbon content reduce the heating value compared with better-
quality stock. Sub-bit coal has fewer than 6,100 kilocalories
per kilogram, according to the Indonesian energy ministry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
