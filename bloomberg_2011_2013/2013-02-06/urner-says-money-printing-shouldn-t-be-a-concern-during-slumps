Central bankers should be less
fearful of printing money during an economic downturn to spur
demand,  Adair Turner , chairman of the U.K.’s Financial Services
Authority, said in London today.  In an economy where people are more concerned about paying
off debt rather than investing, central bankers “may need to be
a little bit more relaxed about the creation” of “irredeemable
fiat base money,” Turner said, according to prepared remarks.  “The potential benefits of paper money creation should not
be ignored” in their ability to stimulate a recovery, said
Turner, a former candidate for governor of the Bank of England.  Mark Carney , who beat out Turner for the BOE post, said
last month that there was room for more monetary stimulus around
the world if needed to “achieve escape velocity” from current
economic slumps. The Bank of England has left its key  interest
rate  at 0.5 percent for almost four years and bought 375 billion
pounds of bonds through quantitative easing even though
inflation has been above its target over the period.  Turner said that increasing money supply through
commercial bank lending “can be a major driver of financial
instability.” Bank leverage, a measure of a lender’s debt to
equity ratio, should be strictly controlled, he said.  “Banks are different,” Turner said. “The arguments for
free markets, strong in other sectors of the economy, do not
apply.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
