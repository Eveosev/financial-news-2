Metro AG  rose the most since November
in Frankfurt trading after Franz Haniel & Cie GmbH reduced its
stake in Germany’s biggest retailer, removing a burden that had
hung over the stock for more than two months.  Haniel, based in Duisburg, Germany, cut its stake to 30.01
percent from 34.24 percent, according to a statement today. The
investor said Nov. 28 that its supervisory board approved the
sale of 4.24 percent of Metro over the next 18 months.  “Investors were waiting for the sale to be completed to
buy the stock to avoid any overhang risk,”  Fabio Fazzari , an
analyst at Equita SIM SpA, said by phone. “The completion might
also have come a bit sooner than investors expected.”  Metro shares jumped as much as 4.8 percent to 23.59 euros,
the  steepest intraday advance  since Nov. 21. The stock traded up
3.6 percent as of 10:46 a.m. in Frankfurt.  Haniel said it generated about 300 million euros ($406.2
million) from the sale. The investor also cut its stake in drug
wholesaler Celesio AG in November to reduce debt.  Metro shares tumbled 26 percent last year, sliding after
the retailer cut its 2012 profit forecast in October because of
weakening economies in southern Europe and parts of eastern
Europe. It forecast 2012 earnings before interest, tax and other
items of about 2 billion euros.  To contact the reporters on this story:
