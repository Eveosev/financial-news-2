Cadbury Nigeria Plc , a manufacturer
of drinks and food products, said it plans to acquire the 2
percent of Stanmark Cocoa Processing Co. it doesn’t already own,
to reduce the cost of running the unit and bolster revenue.  “Cadbury proposes to exchange one share for 5.58 shares of
Stanmark” and then merge the companies, Kufre Ekanem, a
spokesman for Cadbury Nigeria, said today in a telephone
interview from Lagos, the commercial capital.  Stanmark  has a 12,500 ton capacity plant in the south-
western Nigeria city of Ondo and produces cocoa butter, liquor
and powder. It supplies the entire cocoa powder requirements for
Cadbury beverage products while the cocoa butter and liquor are
exported, Ekanem said.  Nigeria is the fourth-largest cocoa producer after Ivory
Coast, Ghana and Indonesia, according to the London-based
International Cocoa Organization’s  website .  The combination will make it easier for Cadbury Nigeria to
refinance the cocoa business and raise output, Ekanem said.
“The companies have applied to the court and the regulatory
authorities for approval and believe the deal will be completed
soon,” he said.  Cadbury Nigeria’s nine-month net income through September
advanced 34 percent to 2.08 billion naira ($13.2 million) from
1.56 billion naira a year earlier, it said in a statement on
Oct. 31. Revenue declined 2.4 percent to 24.1 billion naira.  The stock rose 3.5 percent to 37.27 naira in Lagos. It has
climbed 29 percent this year, compared with a 19 percent gain
for the Nigerian Stock Exchange  All-Share Index .  To contact the reporter on this story:
