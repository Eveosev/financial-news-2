Tim Participacoes SA , Brazil’s
second-biggest mobile-phone operator by market share, fell the
most in seven weeks after fourth-quarter earnings trailed
analysts’ estimates and its chief executive officer resigned.  Shares fell 2.3 percent to 8.55 reais in at 12:03 p.m. in
Sao Paulo, after earlier retreating as much as 2.6 percent for
the biggest intraday decline since Dec. 18. The stock
contributed the most to the drop in the MSCI
Brazil/Telecommunication Services Index, which sank 1.6 percent.  Tim’s fourth-quarter net income rose 16 percent from a year
earlier 462.6 million reais ($232.6 million), according to a
regulatory filing late yesterday. Banco Santander SA expected
net income of 499.2 million reais, while Bradesco BBI forecast
earnings of 465 million reais, according to research reports
dated today.  Tim also announced shareholders will vote on a dividend
increase in April, and that CEO  Andrea Mangoni  will resign
effective March 4. The company’s shares have declined 10 percent
in the past year, while the Bovespa fell 9.7 percent in the same
period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
