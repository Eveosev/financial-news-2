Orange-juice futures that are the
cheapest for this time of the year since 2004 may rise as much
as 15 percent after forming a descending wedge pattern, a
technical analysis by Hackett Financial Advisors Inc. shows.  Prices topped $1.15 a pound last week on ICE Futures U.S.
in New York, breaking the so-called support of the lower up-
trending line in the formation, “signaling further gains in
coming weeks,”  Shawn Hackett , the president of the Boynton
Beach, Florida-based company, said in a telephone interview.
“It’s time to test the upward boundary of the wedge of $1.35,
which would prompt funds to start piling in” and may send
prices toward $1.40, he said.  Futures for March delivery rose 1.1 percent to $1.232 at
11:51 a.m. on ICE, which would be the eighth advance in nine
sessions. The commodity has plunged 46 percent from a record
$2.2695 on Jan. 23, 2012, amid slow demand for the beverage in
the U.S..  While money managers and other speculators increased their
bets on lower prices last week and are the most bearish since
November, funds don’t tend to hold net-short positions for long,
Hackett said. That’s because of frost threats during winter, or
potentially crop-damaging hurricanes from June to November in
Florida, the world’s largest citrus grower after Brazil, he
said.  The net-short holdings, or bets on a price drop, increased
to 612 futures and options as of Jan. 29, up from 35 a week
earlier, according to government data compiled by Bloomberg. On
Dec. 12, they held 6,093 net-longs, or wagers on a price rally,
the most bullish since April, the figures show.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to forecast changes in a bond,
commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
