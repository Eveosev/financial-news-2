India’s rupee declined from the
highest level in more than three months on speculation importers
stepped up dollar purchases to benefit from the exchange rate.  The currency had strengthened earlier on optimism the
nation’s largest state asset sale in a year will attract foreign
capital. Ministers approved an offering of government shares
worth 120 billion rupees ($2.3 billion) in  NTPC Ltd. , India’s
biggest power producer, Disinvestment Secretary Ravi Mathur said
in New Delhi yesterday. The sale will open tomorrow, he said.
Global funds poured $4.7 billion into Indian stocks this year,
exchange data show.  “Inflows will continue,” said  Vikas Babu , a foreign-
exchange trader in Mumbai at the state-owned lender. “The
currency could strengthen more in the coming weeks, though we
will see importers coming in and buying dollars.”  The rupee declined 0.1 percent to 53.1650 per dollar in
Mumbai, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It touched
52.8900 earlier, the strongest level since Oct. 17. One-month
implied volatility, a gauge of expected exchange-rate swings
used to price options, rose 11 basis points, or 0.11 percentage
point, to 9.58 percent.  India plans to offer shares in four more state companies by
March 31, including Steel Authority of India Ltd. and National
Aluminium Co. The government raised 31.4 billion rupees last
week by selling 10 percent in the explorer Oil India Ltd.  Three-month onshore rupee forwards traded at 54.20 per
dollar, compared with 54.13 yesterday, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Offshore non-deliverable contracts were
at 54.05 versus 53.97. Forwards are agreements to buy or sell
assets at a set price and date. Non-deliverable contracts are
settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
