DreamWorks Animation SKG Inc ., the
independent studio behind the “Madagascar” films, dropped the
most in six months after the company pulled one movie from its
schedule and delayed the release of another.  DreamWorks Animation, based in Glendale, California,  fell 
3.7 percent to $16.78 at 2:14 p.m. New York time after  dropping 
as low as $16.26 for the biggest intraday dip since Aug. 1. The
shares had lost 7 percent in the 12 months through yesterday
while the Standard & Poor’s 500 Media Index advanced 34 percent.  “Me and My Shadow,” described by the company as a
“groundbreaking” combination of computer-generated and
traditional animation, was pulled from the schedule and put back
in development, DreamWorks Animation said late yesterday in a
statement. It was set for release in March 2014. “Mr. Peabody &
Sherman,” planned for theaters in November 2013, will now be
released on March 7, 2014.  The change reduces the company’s 2013 release slate to two
movies from three. The studio is “adjusting our operating
infrastructure costs accordingly,” Chief Executive Officer
 Jeffrey Katzenberg  said in the statement.  The Hollywood Reporter said the company planned an
unspecified workforce reduction, citing sources that it did not
identify.  Shannon Olivas , a company spokeswoman, declined to
comment. The company finished 2011 with about 2,100 employees,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The studio said it made the change at the recommendation of
 News Corp. ’s Twentieth Century Fox. In August, DreamWorks
Animation signed a five-year deal for Fox to distribute its
films, replacing  Viacom Inc .’s Paramount Pictures. Under the
accord, Fox will handle marketing and distribution of the
studio’s releases through 2017.  To contact the reporter on this story:
