Global health funding barely grew
last year as the U.S. and other nations cut their donations to
programs in developing nations, a study found.  Development assistance for health increased 2.5 percent to
$28.1 billion last year after expanding at an average pace of 11
percent a year from 2001 to 2010, according to a report today by
the  Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation , a research unit
at the University of Washington in Seattle.  Increased spending by the  GAVI Alliance , a funder of
vaccines backed by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and
the United Nations Children’s Fund, or Unicef, made up for lower
contributions from the U.S., France and Germany last year, the
institute said.  “There were predictions that the sky was going to fall on
global health funding, but that didn’t happen,” Christopher
Murray, the institute’s director, said in a statement. Still,
“projections for further cutbacks in development assistance do
not augur well for a return to the rapid growth that punctuated
the 2001 to 2010 era,” according to the report.  Donations from governments dropped 4.4 percent last year,
according to the report. The U.S., the largest funder of global
health, cut its contributions by 3.3 percent, while France and
Germany reduced donations by 13 percent and 9.1 percent
respectively, the report said. The U.K. and Australia were the
only two nations among the largest six bilateral donors to
increase funding.  Spending by GAVI jumped 42 percent to $1.8 billion last
year, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
