Serbia’s inflation rate will peak at
about 14 percent by April as policy makers struggle against
rising global commodity markets and the threat of increased
regulated prices to squeeze price growth back to its target.  The rate, at 12.2 percent in 2012, will begin to ease again
in the second quarter and head lower to the central bank’s
preferred range of 2.5 percent to 5.5 percent at the end of the
year after surging in the current quarter, central bank Deputy
Governor  Veselin Pjescic  said in Belgrade today.  The return depends on “jumping food and regulated prices”
at home and “primary food and oil prices in global commodity
markets” while tight monetary policy, weak aggregate demand and
fiscal consolidation will keep a lid on prices in the medium
term, Pjescic told reporters.  He spoke a day after the Belgrade-based Narodna Banka
Srbije unexpectedly boosted the one-week repurchase rate by a
quarter of a percentage point to 11.75 percent, its eighth
increase in nine meetings since June, as it battles to bring
down Europe’s second-highest inflation rate.  Pjescic said the economy probably will expand 2.5 percent,
or 0.5 percentage points above the government’s forecast of 2
percent, led by expanding car and crude oil product exports.  Net exports are helping the Balkan nation narrow its
current-account gap to 8.1 percent of economic output, or 2.7
billion euros ($3.65 billion), from 10.5 percent of gross
domestic product in 2012.  The central bank is counting on 1.1 billion euros in net
foreign-direct investments and 1.2 billion euros in net
government external borrowing to finance the gap, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
