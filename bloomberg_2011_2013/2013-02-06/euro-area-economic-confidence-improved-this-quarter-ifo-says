Confidence in the euro-area economy
improved this quarter amid signs the region is beginning to
emerge from recession, Germany’s  Ifo institute  said.  An index measuring economic sentiment in the 17-nation
currency bloc increased to 95.1 from 81.7 in the final three
months of 2012, Munich-based Ifo said in an e-mailed statement
today, citing its quarterly World Economic Survey. That’s the
first gain in three quarters. A measure of current conditions
fell to 95.1 from 97.9, while a gauge of expectations surged to
95.1 from 72.1, the highest level in almost two years.  “A silver lining is appearing on the horizon,” Ifo said.
“The economic situation in the euro area is expected to improve
within the next six months.”  Euro-area inflation expectations for 2013 average 2.1
percent, Ifo said. That’s above the European Central Bank’s 2
percent price-stability threshold. Survey respondents predict
short-term interest rates and the exchange rate versus the U.S.
dollar to remain broadly unchanged in the next six months.  The survey is based on responses from 281 economic experts
and conducted in cooperation with the International Chamber of
Commerce in Paris.  To contact the reporter on this story:
