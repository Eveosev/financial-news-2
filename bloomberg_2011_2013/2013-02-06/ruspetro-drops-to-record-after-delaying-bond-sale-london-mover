RusPetro Plc , an oil producer in
Siberia, slumped to a record low after saying it’s postponing a
bond sale designed to strengthen the company’s finances.  The  shares  plunged 16 percent to 43 pence, the biggest fall
in a month and the lowest since the company listed on the London
stock exchange in January last year. The volume of shares traded
was almost 16 times the three-month daily average.  RusPetro has lost more than 65 percent since raising $250
million in a share offering on Jan. 18, 2012. The average share
price target of seven analysts tracked by Bloomberg is 205
pence, almost five times the closing price.  “The company will consider recommencing the offering at a
later date,” RusPetro said in a statement today, without giving
a reason for the delay.  RusPetro hired Bank of America Corp., Credit Suisse Group
and Deutsche Bank AG to manage the sale, Bloomberg reported two
days ago. The company planned to sell as much as $350 million in
bonds, a person familiar with the sale who asked not to be named
said last month.  The debt issue was designed to repay an existing loan
facility from OAO Sberbank. An outstanding shareholder loan from
Limolines Transport Ltd. was to be converted into new ordinary
shares subject to the success of the note sale, RusPetro said in
a statement Jan. 25.  To contact the reporter on this story:
