Ethanol weakened against gasoline as
corn prices declined for a fourth day and production of the
biofuel rose.  The spread widened 1.63 cents a gallon to 61.07 cents based
on settlement prices, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
 Production  rose 0.5 percent to 774,000 barrels a day in the week
ended Feb. 1, the Energy Information Administration said today.
Corn futures declined for a fourth consecutive day.  “The big driver today was the corn market being off
again,” said Chris Wilson, an analyst at Atten Babler Risk
Management LLC in Galena, Illinois.  Denatured ethanol for March delivery fell 1.4 cents, or 0.6
percent, to $2.429 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Gasoline for March delivery rose 0.23 cent to $3.0397 a gallon
on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract covers
reformulated gasoline made to be blended with the biofuel.  Corn for March delivery fell 6.5 cents, or 0.9 percent, to
$7.225 a bushel in Chicago. One bushel makes at least 2.75
gallons of ethanol.  The corn crush spread, or the profit that can be made from
turning a bushel of corn into ethanol, was little changed at
minus 20 cents, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Supplies  Output of the biofuel rebounded last week from the lowest
level since the Energy Department’s analytical arm began
tracking weekly data in June 2010. U.S.  imports  of ethanol were
9,000 barrels a day for the second straight week, the EIA said.  Producers have had to contend with imports from Brazil,
where the additive is made from sugarcane.  Spot ethanol in Sao
Paulo  cost $2.21 a gallon in the week ended Feb. 1, data
compiled by Bloomberg show, or 9.2 percent less than today’s
U.S. futures price.  Ethanol fell in all spot market regions. The biofuel slid 3
cents to $2.41 in Chicago, 3 cents to $2.52 in New York, 3 cents
to $2.575 on the West Coast, and 3.5 cents to $2.455 in the U.S.
Gulf, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol-blended gasoline made up 89 percent of the total
U.S. gasoline pool last week, up from 87 percent the previous
week.  Stockpiles  of ethanol fell 2.2 percent to 20.1 million
barrels last week, the government report showed. The surplus was
4.6 percent lower than a year ago, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  “We’re still in an oversupply situation, but when you see
stocks fall, it’s a positive trend toward usage,” said  Jason Ward , an analyst at Northstar Commodity Investment Inc. in
Minneapolis. “It should show the marketplace that demand for
ethanol is improving.”  Under a 2007 energy law, U.S. refiners are to use 13.8
billion gallons of renewable fuels, such as ethanol, this year
and 15 billion by 2015.  To contact the reporter on this story:
