ICAP Plc  had its biggest two-day
rally in more than a year after the U.K.-based inter-dealer
broker said currency-trading volume on its EBS electronic
platform rose 22 percent in January from a year earlier.  The average daily foreign-exchange volume was $141.3
billion last month, up from $116 billion in the same month of
2012, ICAP said yesterday in a statement on its website. Average
daily fixed-income volume rose 16 percent to $626.7 billion. The
London-based company is scheduled to report its third-quarter
earnings tomorrow.  The  stock  rose 7.4 percent to 363.8 pence at 10:10 a.m. in
London trading, the highest since June 2012. The shares have
risen 14 percent in the past two days, the most since Feb. 1-2,
2012.  Interdealer brokers such as ICAP act as a go-between for
banks that trade bonds, stocks, currencies, energy and
derivatives. They profit when prices fluctuate because more
traders use the products they trade. ICAP said last month that
it’s being investigated by the U.K.’s Financial Services
Authority as part of its probe into Libor rigging.  To contact the reporter on this story:
