MetLife Inc. , the largest U.S. life
insurer, said it’s weighing whether to close some offices as the
company seeks to cut costs.  “We are currently undergoing a review of our real estate
footprint, which includes strategies around consolidating and
exiting certain locations,”  John Calagna , a MetLife spokesman,
said today in an e-mailed statement.  Chief Executive Officer  Steven Kandarian , 60, is seeking to
cut costs by $600 million at the New York-based insurer, mostly
in the U.S. The Charlotte Business Journal reported today that
MetLife is in negotiations to lease about 250,000 square feet of
office space in Charlotte, North Carolina, and may move some
jobs there from the Northeast. Calagna didn’t identify sites the
insurer may exit or lease.  “MetLife continually evaluates its real estate
footprint,” Calagna said. “We are in the process of conducting
due diligence on these locations and do not have any additional
information to provide.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
