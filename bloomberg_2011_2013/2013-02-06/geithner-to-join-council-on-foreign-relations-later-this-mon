Timothy F. Geithner , who ended his
term as U.S. Treasury Secretary in January, will join the
Council on Foreign Relations this month and plans to publish a
book.  Geithner, 51, will work for the council as a full-time
distinguished fellow in New York, where the organization is 
based, the group said today in two separate emails. He was 
previously a senior fellow there in 2001.  He’s also planning a book and will be meeting with
publishers, Robert Barnett, a partner at Williams & Connolly
LLP, said in an e-mail. Barnett is a lawyer who has represented
former Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, former
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan and country singer
Shania Twain.  As President  Barack Obama ’s Treasury secretary starting in
January 2009, Geithner oversaw bailouts of companies including
Citigroup Inc. and General Motors Co., steered the financial-
rules revamp and negotiated with congressional leaders on the
budget and debt limit.  The Council on Foreign Relations is a non-partisan
organization providing analysis on policy issues including
defense, the environment, economics and terrorism. It’s headed
by Robert Rubin, also a former Treasury secretary, and Carla
Hills, chairman and chief executive officer of Hills & Co.  To contact the reporter on this story:
