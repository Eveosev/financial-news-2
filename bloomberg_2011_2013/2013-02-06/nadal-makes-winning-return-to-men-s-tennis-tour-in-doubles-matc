Rafael Nadal  made a winning return to
the men’s tennis circuit after a seven-month layoff because of a
knee injury.  The 11-time Grand Slam singles champion paired with
Argentina’s  Juan Monaco  to beat  Frantisek Cermak  and Lukas
Dlouhy of the Czech Republic 6-3, 6-2 last night at the VTR Open
in Vina del Mar, Chile.  Nadal, 26, hadn’t played competitively since a second-round
upset loss to  Lukas Rosol  of the Czech Republic at Wimbledon on
June 28. He dropped to No. 5 in the ATP Rankings for the first
time in eight years while out of action and will make his
singles return today against Argentina’s Federico Delbonis at
the clay-court tournament, where he is the top seed.  Nadal, the most dominant clay-court player of his
generation with 36 titles including a men’s record seven French
Open championships, has been suffering from a partially torn
patella tendon and knee inflammation. Before making his comeback,
he told reporters he will have to be patient.  “I have to take it slowly and be humble to know that
things won’t be as good as they were before my injury,” Nadal
said three days ago. “This is the injury that has sidelined me
the longest, so maybe it will take me a bit longer to get back
my confidence, the good feeling on court.”  During his absence, the former world No. 1 missed the
London Olympics, the U.S. Open and the Australian Open. He’s
scheduled to play in Brazil next week and in Mexico the
following week as part of the buildup to his bid for an eighth
title at Roland Garros. The French Open starts May 26.  To contact the reporter on this story:
