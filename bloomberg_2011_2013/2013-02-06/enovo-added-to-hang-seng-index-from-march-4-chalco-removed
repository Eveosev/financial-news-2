  Lenovo Group Ltd. (992) , the world’s
second-biggest maker of personal computers, will be added to
 Hong Kong ’s benchmark  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  effective March 4,
compiler Hang Seng Indexes Co. said.  Aluminum Corp. of China Ltd. , the nation's biggest producer
of the metal, will be removed from the index, according to a
statement yesterday. The total number of index members will
remain at 50.  The changes may affect the share-price movements of the
added or removed companies, as Hang Seng Index-tracking funds
such as the  Hang Seng Index Exchange-Traded Fund (2833) , with a  total
asset value  of HK$36.4 billion ($4.7 billion) as of February,
adjust their holdings.  The Hang Seng Index has jumped 9.9 percent to 23,256.93
since its last quarterly review on Nov. 16, when the addition of
 Kunlun Energy Co. (135)  was announced.  Hang Seng Indexes announced the changes after Hong Kong’s
stock market closed yesterday. Lenovo, second to Hewlett-Packard
Co. in global PC market share, gained 4.7 percent to close at
HK$8.73, bringing its 12-month increase to 37 percent, compared 
with a 12 percent rise in the benchmark.  Aluminum Corp., also called Chalco, was unchanged at
HK$3.63 in Hong Kong trading yesterday. Its H shares have
dropped 7.4 percent in the past 12 months.  Haitong Securities Co. will be added to the Hang Seng China
Enterprises Index of Chinese companies’ so-called H shares, as
 ZTE Corp. (000063)  is removed, Hang Seng Indexes said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
