The  Merchant Commodity Fund , managed
by  Doug King  and  Michael Coleman , cut a third of its staff after
two consecutive years of losses during which assets under
management slumped almost 90 percent.  The hedge fund cut five jobs last month, including traders
and analysts in Singapore and London, Chief Operating Officer
Coleman said in an interview. Assets fell to $170 million in
January after investors withdrew money, according to Coleman,
who’s also chief risk officer. Merchant, set up with $10 million
in June 2004, had managed $1.56 billion at the end of 2010.  The struggle at Merchant, which bets on agriculture and
energy, reflects an industry trend. Combined assets at more than
400 commodity hedge funds fell 5 percent to $78.9 billion in
2012, the first drop since the 2008 financial crisis, according
to New York-based researcher eVestment|HFN. Raw-material hedge
funds lost 3.8 percent in 2011 and 2.6 percent in 2012,
according to the  Newedge Commodity Trading Index .  “It’s very hard for hedge funds that lost a lot of assets
to turn things around,” said  Richard Johnston , Hong Kong-based
Asia head of Albourne Partners Ltd., which advises investors on
hedge funds and other alternative investments. “We sometimes
respect the people that stay focused and try to win people back.
But that can take a long time.”  Performance Fee  Merchant declined 7.6 percent last year after a 29.9
percent slump in 2011, according to the December report to
investors. Still, the fund has returned 210 percent since June
2004, according to the report. The last 20 percent performance
fee was received in early 2011 for the results of the preceding
year, Singapore-based Coleman said. That year, the fund returned
27.6 percent.  “We decided to get the headcount to be in line with the
assets,” Chief Investment Officer King said from London
yesterday, without identifying those who were cut. “We are
committed to make it work.” The fund now has two traders left
that work with King, he said.  One of the employees affected has been shifted to Coleman
and King’s physical-trading unit, RCMA Commodities Asia Pte Ltd.,
according to Coleman. The number of staff at Merchant peaked at
16 in early 2010, he said. There are now 10 staff.  Commodities as tracked by Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot Index
rose 0.3 percent last year, climbing for a fourth year. Gains
were led by wheat and soybeans amid the worst U.S. drought since
the 1930s, while coffee, cotton and sugar declined the most.
West Texas Intermediate crude oil fell 7.1 percent in 2012,
snapping three years of advances.  Merchant’s 2012 losses were primarily from agriculture,
followed by energy, according to the December report.  ‘Ugly Year’  Merchant was reorganized last year after the decline in
2011, which was the first year of losses after  seven annual
gains . Coleman suspended his trading career to focus on risk,
leaving King to trade most of the assets. King described 2011 as
an “ugly, ugly year,” and said one goal was to reduce
volatility, according to an earlier interview with Bloomberg.  A total of 920 hedge funds of all kinds were closed last
year, the largest amount since 2008, according to Singapore-
based data provider Eurekahedge Pte. Among them were  Pierre Andurand ’s $1 billion BlueGold Capital Management LLP, which
lost as much as 34 percent in 2011, and Fortress Investment
Group LLC’s $500 million commodities fund.  Most of the asset slump at commodity funds last year came
from performance-related losses, with the rest from investors
taking money out, according to  Peter Laurelli , vice president of
the research group at eVestment|HFN.  To contact the reporter on this story:
