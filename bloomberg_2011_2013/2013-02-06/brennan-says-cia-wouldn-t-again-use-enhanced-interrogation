John Brennan  said the Central
Intelligence Agency wouldn’t again used so-called enhanced
interrogation techniques if he is confirmed as its director.  Brennan, President Barack Obama’s chief adviser on
counterterrorism, also said the CIA is “out of the detention
business” and that he is vigilant in not disclosing classified
information when speaking with journalists.  Brennan commented in written responses submitted to the
Senate intelligence committee in advance of his confirmation
hearing tomorrow.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
