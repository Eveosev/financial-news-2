Ralph Lauren Corp. , the retailer of
its namesake brand clothing, reported fiscal third-quarter
profit that topped analysts’ estimates, helped by lower-than-
expected expenses and cheaper cotton.  Net income in the three months ended Dec. 29 climbed 28
percent to $215.7 million, or $2.31 a share, from $169 million,
or $1.78, a year earlier, the New York-based company said today
in a statement. Excluding some items, profit totaled $2.40 a
share. Analysts projected $2.20 a share, the average of 14
 estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  Ralph Lauren’s profitability improved more than analysts
estimated as it benefited from lower product costs, including
cheaper cotton, said  Liz Dunn , an analyst at Macquarie Group in
New York. Expenses also were lower than she had projected as the
company invested in growing businesses such as Asia.  “It’s a really great result,” Dunn, who recommends
investors buy the shares, said in a phone interview today. “The
bottom-line beat is very high quality.”  Gross margin, or the fraction of revenue left after
subtracting the cost of goods sold, expanded 2.2 percentage
points to 59.3 percent. Analysts projected 59.1 percent.  Ralph Lauren  advanced  5.9 percent to $174.63 at the close
in New York. The shares climbed 8.6 percent last year compared
to a 22 percent gain for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Consumer
Discretionary Sector Index.  The quarter was helped by “continued momentum in the
Americas and improved trends in Europe,” President and Chief
Operating Officer  Roger Farah  said in the statement.  Revenue gained 2.2 percent to $1.85 billion in the quarter,
matching the average of analysts’ estimates.  Selling, general and administrative expenses rose 2.4
percent to $768.9 million.  Barbara Wyckoff , an analyst at Credit
Agricole in New York who rates the shares outperform, the
equivalent of a buy, estimated $790 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
