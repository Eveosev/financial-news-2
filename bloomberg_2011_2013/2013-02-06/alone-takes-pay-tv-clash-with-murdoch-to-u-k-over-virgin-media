John Malone, the chairman of  Liberty Global Inc. (LBYTA) , is rapidly becoming  News Corp. (NWSA)  Chief Executive Officer  Rupert Murdoch ’s biggest headache in  Europe  as the two billionaires chase pay-television growth.  Malone, 71, agreed to buy  Virgin Media Inc. (VMED)  for $47.87 a share in cash and stock, or $16 billion, to vie with  Comcast Corp. (CMCSA)  as the world’s largest cable operator. He is taking on  British Sky Broadcasting Group Plc (BSY)  in the U.K., the pay-TV company that Murdoch built into the country’s No. 1 by spending $3.6 billion on exclusive film and sports content annually.  A combination with Liberty Global would give Virgin Media resources to more directly challenge BSkyB, said Adrian Drury, a London-based media analyst at consultant Ovum. Malone is already using  Liberty Global  to expand in Europe, where he has 18.4 million pay-TV subscribers to Murdoch’s 19 million. The two compete in  Germany  where Murdoch’s  Sky Deutschland AG (SKYD)  is rolling out faster Web services to challenge Malone’s Unitymedia KabelBW.  “Liberty is an 800-pound gorilla and Murdoch is another 800-pound gorilla,” Drury said. “The reality is this will be a straight bloodbath because the U.K. is an incredibly competitive pay-TV market.”  Lucrative Market  It’s also a  lucrative  market. Average monthly pay-TV bills in the country is about $41, the highest of any European country, according to London-based researcher Informa Plc. Virgin Media has almost 5 million cable customers in the U.K., versus about 11 million for BSkyB.  The rivalry between the two men is longstanding. In 2008, Malone traded a 16 percent holding of  News Corp. (NWSA) ’s shares for a 41 percent stake in pay-TV provider DirecTV, cash and some regional sports networks. That deal ended a standoff that had led Murdoch to erect takeover defenses in 2004 to stop Malone from increasing his stake.  Murdoch, 81, attempted in 2010 to take control of the 61 percent of BSkyB that  News Corp. (NWSA)  didn’t already own with a 7.8 billion-pound offer, part of a plan to combine the British company with other European assets. He had to drop the plan a year later when employees at News Corp.’s print business were caught hacking into subjects’ phones for stories, making the acquisition politically impossible.  Murdoch weighs in as the 91st richest person in the world, with estimated net wealth of $11.4 billion, according to the  Bloomberg Billionaires Index . Malone is ranked 199th by Forbes.  ‘Game Changer’  The takeover of Virgin Media “can be seen as a game changer for pay-TV in the U.K. because Malone has very deep pockets,” said  Alex DeGroote , an analyst at Panmure Gordon in  London . “He’s a player with stronger resources than Virgin, and he’d definitely change the competitive dynamics for Sky.”  Shares of Virgin Media have tripled in  New York  trading since Neil Berkett took over as CEO in 2008. By focusing on high-speed Internet and avoiding bidding for the most expensive content, such as sports rights, Virgin Media reported its first annual profit in 2011.  Berkett said today he will step down when the deal closes because he’s “not a very good number two.” Liberty Global, led by CEO Mike Fries, said it hasn’t found a successor.  Virgin Media  today reported 2012 income of 261.4 million pounds ($409 million) from continuing operations before taxes. The company had a 920 million-pound net loss in 2008.  Average Premium  Virgin Media shares fell 1.6 percent to $44.89 at the close in New York. They jumped 18 percent yesterday after Virgin Media confirmed it was in talks with Englewood, Colorado-based Liberty Global about a deal. Liberty Global fell 2.7 percent to $66.06 today, the biggest one-day drop in almost three months.  Acquirers have paid an average premium of 22 percent for deals in cable satellite and TV industry in the past 12 months, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.   Most (LBTYA)  of Liberty Global’s operations are in Europe, including Germany,  Belgium ,  Austria , Ireland and  Switzerland . In addition to BSkyB and Sky Deutschland, News Corp. owns  Sky Italia  in  Italy . Liberty Global said it may seek a European listing following the Virgin Media deal, expected to be completed in the second quarter.  Malone may ultimately sell his European cable empire to  Vodafone Group Plc (VOD) , giving the region’s largest mobile-phone company access to land-line Internet and pay-TV services to bundle with wireless packages, said  Robin Bienenstock , a London-based analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein.  Vodafone Next?  “The out for  John Malone  is, ‘I build this big business, and then I sell it to Vodafone, who’s desperate because they don’t have any wire line,” Bienenstock said.  Liberty Global CEO Mike Fries said today on Bloomberg TV there was “no immediate intent” to sell the business to Vodafone or any other company.  “We’re going to grow it and run it as a stand-alone business,” Fries said. “We’ve got a lot of room to grow and a lot of opportunity in front of us as we are.”  Representatives at Newbury, England-based Vodafone and New York-based News Corp. declined to comment.  Malone has historically used his Liberty companies as a holding vehicle for media and telecommunications shares. Today, Liberty Media owns shares in  Time Warner Inc. (TWC) ,  Viacom Inc (VIAB) . and Sirius XM Radio Inc., while Liberty Interactive holds interests in video and online shopping businesses such as QVC Inc. and HSN Inc.  Malone was originally CEO of Liberty’s parent, Tele-Communications Inc., taking the role in 1973 and building it into the second-biggest U.S. cable operator. He sold the business to  AT&T Corp. (653707Q)  in 1999 and the telecommunications company spun off Liberty Media, the programming arm, in 2001.  German Deals  Liberty Global bought Germany’s Unitymedia in 2010 and Kabel Baden-Wuerttemberg the following year to create the country’s second-largest cable operator. In Belgium, however, Malone’s bid for full ownership of  Telenet Group Holding NV (TNET)  fell through last month after investors rejected a 2 billion-euro ($2.7 billion) offer, leaving Liberty Global with a 58 percent stake.  In 2002, Malone was blocked from buying cable systems from  Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE)  for $4.8 billion, which would have made Liberty the largest cable operator in Europe.  Attempts to take control of U.K. operators NTL Inc. and Telewest Communications Plc were then resisted by the companies’ bondholders. By November of that year, Malone ended a $751 million agreement to buy Dutch cable operator Casema after regulators delayed the purchase. NTL and Telewest merged in 2006, later becoming Virgin Media.  “If Malone is successful and winning customers from Sky then absolutely we’d see a power shift,” Ovum’s Drury said. “But there’s a lot for them to do to win customers from Sky.”  To contact the reporters on this story: Amy Thomson in London at  athomson6@bloomberg.net ; Kristen Schweizer in London at  kschweizer1@bloomberg.net ; Cornelius Rahn in Berlin at  crahn2@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story: Kenneth Wong at  kwong11@bloomberg.net
