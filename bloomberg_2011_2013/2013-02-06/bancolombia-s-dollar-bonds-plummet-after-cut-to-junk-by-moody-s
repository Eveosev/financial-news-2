Bancolombia SA’s subordinated dollar
bonds plunged after Moody’s Investors Service reduced its rating
on the debt to junk status, citing global banking regulations
that increase capital requirements.  The yield on Bancolombia’s dollar bonds due 2022 rose 27
basis points, or 0.27 percentage point, to 4.95 percent at 3:36
p.m. in Bogota. That’s its biggest increase since the securities
were issued in September.  Moody’s said in a statement yesterday it reduced the rating
on foreign currency subordinated debt issued by Colombia’s
biggest bank to Ba1, or one level below investment grade, from
Baa3 with a stable outlook. The cut comes as international
guidelines established by Basel Committee on Banking Supervision
expanded the range of easily sold assets banks must have on hand
to weather a month of market turmoil.  “The strong sell-off is a consequence of the bonds losing
the investment grade rating which means many institutional
investors need to get rid of them,” David Cohen, a strategist
at brokerage Corredores Asociados said in a phone interview in
Bogota.  Moody’s also cut subordinated bonds from Banco Davivienda
SA to Ba2, or two levels below investment grade, from Ba1 with a
negative outlook. It lowered Banco GNB Sudameris SA’s
subordinated foreign debt to B1 from Ba2 with a stable outlook.  To contact the reporter on this story:
