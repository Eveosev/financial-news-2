Volkswagen AG  workers boosted their
influence at Europe’s largest carmaker after receiving 2 percent
of VW’s voting rights from the Piech-Porsche family.  The family’s holding company in Austria is tranfering the
votes to a private foundation,  Joerg Koether , a spokesman for
VW’s works council, said in an e-mailed statement. Workers will
exercise the voting right by holding a majority of the seats on
the foundation’s board, he said.  The Piech-Porsche family will also have seats on the board
and the dividend from the shares will still be paid to the
family, Koether said in the statement.  As is customary in Germany, workers at VW already have half
of the 20 seats on the automaker’s supervisory board. VW
Chairman  Ferdinand Piech , whose family controls the automaker,
has been consolidating his influence over the automaker, adding
his wife Ursula to the supervisory board this year. The family
now has five of the 10 seats on the board reserved for
shareholders.  To contact the reporter on this story:
