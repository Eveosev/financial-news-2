Volvo AB , the world’s second-largest
truckmaker, said fourth-quarter profit dropped 84 percent
because of the cost of cutting jobs and reorganizing production
in response to shrinking economies in Europe and the U.S.  Earnings before interest and taxes fell to 1.12 billion
kronor ($177 million) from 6.96 billion kronor a year earlier,
Gothenburg, Sweden-based Volvo said in a statement today. Profit
missed the 2.47 billion-krona average of eight analyst estimates
compiled by Bloomberg. Sales declined 2.2 percent to 303.6
billion kronor.  Volvo, which ranks second to  Daimler AG  in global truck
sales, posted 990 million kronor in costs and eliminated 2,000
jobs for cutting back construction-equipment manufacturing in
Sweden, ending busmaking there and closing a truck plant in
Japan that served the U.S. market. The economy of the 17 nations
sharing the euro went into recession in the third quarter, and
U.S. gross domestic product shrank in the fourth.  “The first quarter of 2013 will also be difficult as a
result of the low order intake in many markets during the fourth
quarter of 2012,” Chief Executive Officer  Olof Persson  said in
the statement. “Profitability will be affected by low capacity
utilization, high spend levels in research and development and
costs associated with the launch of new products.”  Consolidating Production  Fourth-quarter charges included 600 million kronor for
reorganizing Volvo’s European truck-sales network, 280 million
kronor for consolidating production in Japan, including spending
on shutting a plant, and 110 million kronor for revamping bus
operations, the Swedish company said today. A gain of 254
million kronor was posted following the sale of Volvo’s
aerospace-engine unit to GKN Plc, it said.  “It’s tough for the company to cut costs so quickly,”
said  Mattias Eriksson , a Stockholm-based equity strategist at
Nordea Bank AB with a buy recommendation on the stock. “They’re
trying to get the costs down gradually, and hopefully demand is
improving as well.”  Volvo , which also makes Mack trucks in North America and
Renault-brand heavy vehicles in Europe, reiterated a forecast
that the North American truck market will about match the
250,000 deliveries estimated for 2012.  European industrywide sales last year probably totaled
221,000 trucks, Volvo said, a decline from an earlier estimate.
The company forecast industrywide sales in the region of 230,000
vehicles in 2013, sticking to an earlier prediction.  2013 Forecast  Globally, “we expect market conditions to gradually
improve during the course of 2013, when economic growth across
the world gains momentum,” Persson said.  Net income in the fourth quarter dropped 83 percent to 793
million kronor, Volvo said. The company plans an unchanged
 dividend  of 3 kronor a share.  The manufacturer’s deliveries fell 15 percent to 58,626
trucks in the quarter, while orders dropped 9.6 percent to
52,145 vehicles. Europe accounted for 40 percent of deliveries
and 36 percent of orders.  The region’s commercial-vehicle market in December
contracted to the lowest level since October 2009, according to
the Brussels-based regional industry group  ACEA . Full-year
registrations of heavy trucks in Europe declined 9.4 percent to
214,086 vehicles.  Top Target  Volvo said Jan. 28 that a 5.6 billion-yuan ($899 million)
plan to buy a 45 percent stake in the truck unit of Chinese
manufacturer Dongfeng Motor Group Co. will help Volvo overtake
 Daimler  in worldwide commercial-vehicle sales. Volvo has a
target of completing the transaction, which will form a new
joint venture, within a year.  Part of Volvo’s push outside its traditional markets
includes a plan outlined in September to invest almost 800
million kronor in a truck-cab factory in Kaluga, Russia, that
will start production in 2014.  Scania AB , the Swedish truckmaker controlled by  Volkswagen
AG , reported a 29 percent plunge in profit in 2012 because of
lower sales and production in Europe, which accounted for 45
percent of its deliveries. Volkswagen is pressing for closer
collaboration between Scania and MAN SE, the Munich-based
truckmaker that Volkswagen controls and is seeking to buy out.
Daimler is scheduled to release earnings figures tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
