Automatic spending cuts due to take
effect March 1 threaten “the most serious readiness crisis in
over a decade,” U.S. Defense Secretary  Leon Panetta  said today.  Panetta urged Congress to embrace President Barack Obama’s
call yesterday for a smaller package of cuts and tax-code
changes to avert the across-the-board reductions known as
sequestration that would reduce defense spending by $45 billion
through September.  “My fear is that there is a dangerous and callous attitude
developing among some Republicans and Democrats alike that these
dangerous cuts can be allowed to take place in order to blame
the other party for the consequences,” Panetta said in prepared
remarks for an address at Georgetown University in Washington.  To contact the reporter on this story:
