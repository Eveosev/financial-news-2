Vocus Inc. dropped the most in 11
months after projecting full-year sales that trailed analysts’
estimates as the maker of public-relations software works to
integrate a new business.  The shares  fell  14 percent to $15.32 at the close in New
York, the biggest one-day decline since Feb. 29. Vocus had
dropped 25 percent in the 12 months through yesterday compared
with a 1.6 percent gain for the Russell 3000 Technology Index.  Vocus has revamped its business model and acquired an e-
mail marketing business in the past year, leaving investors
unsure about how to gauge revenue growth, said  Steven Ashley , an
analyst with Robert W. Baird & Co. in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.  “You have two currents going on -- the old business being
weaker, and the new business being stronger,” Ashley, who
recommends investors hold the shares, said today in an
interview. “Business model transitions take a while. They’re
bumpy. We’re a good way through.”  Revenue for 2013 may increase as much as 17 percent to
$201.8 million, Beltsville, Maryland-based Vocus said in a
statement yesterday. Analysts projected $208 million, the
average of estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  On Feb. 28, 2012, Vocus announced it had acquired iContact,
a provider of e-mail and social-marketing software, for $169
million. The next day, the stock plunged 40 percent amid concern
over the company having spent more than 80 percent of its cash
for the purchase.  To contact the reporter on this story:
