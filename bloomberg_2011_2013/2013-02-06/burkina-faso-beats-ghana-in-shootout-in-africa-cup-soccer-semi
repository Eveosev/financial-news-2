Burkina Faso defeated Ghana 3-2 in a
penalty shootout to reach the Africa Cup of Nations soccer final
for the first time.  Ghana put two attempts wide in the shootout and Burkina
Faso goalkeeper Daouda Diakite stopped a third try in Nelspruit, 
South Africa. Burkina Faso will play Nigeria, which defeated Mali 
4-1 earlier today, in the Feb. 10 title match in Johannesburg.  The game went to the shootout after finishing tied 1-1.
Wakaso Mubarak scored with a penalty kick in the first half for
Ghana and Aristide Bance tied the game for Burkina Faso in the
second half. Burkina Faso finished the game with 10 men after
Jonathan Pitroipa received his second yellow card in extra time.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
