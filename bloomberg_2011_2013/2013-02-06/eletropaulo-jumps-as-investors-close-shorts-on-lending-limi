Eletropaulo Metropolitana
Eletricidade de Sao Paulo SA, Brazil’s largest electricity
distributor, surged after lending for short selling reached a
limit.  The AES Corp. unit jumped as much as 14 percent before
paring the gain to close up 1.3 percent at 14.03 reais. Trading
volume was more than triple the three-month average. The
benchmark Bovespa index slipped 0.8 percent.  Shares that have been sold short and not yet repurchased
rose to 28.33 percent of the stock’s free float, exceeding the
Brazilian exchange’s 20 percent limit,  data compiled by
Bloomberg show . The clearing house informed traders that the
lending ratio limit had been reached, said  Pedro Galdi , the
chief strategist at Sao Paulo-based brokerage SLW Corretora  “As a result investors who shorted the stock ran to buy it
back and cover their open positions,” Galdi said by phone.  Short sellers borrow shares and sell them into the market
on a bet they’ll be able to repay the loan later by buying back
the stock at a lower price. Eletropaulo has slumped 61 percent
in the past year, the biggest selloff among 15 global peers
tracked by Bloomberg.  BM&FBovespa SA, which operates the bourse, said in an e-
mailed statement that investors are required to cover their
positions when deemed necessary, without elaborating.  To contact the reporters on this story:
