third-largest wealth manager, hired three bankers as part of an
expansion of services for Russian clients.  Alexey Dolgikh  and equity trader  Rufat Askerov  joined from
 OAO Sberbank , Russia’s largest lender,  Jan Vonder Muehll , a
spokesman for the Geneva-based bank said today. Alexander
Muratov, who previously worked at Russian lender Alfa Bank, was
also hired.  “We have been expanding our Russian desks in Zurich,
Geneva, Vienna, Monaco and Singapore recently,” Vonder Muehll
said in reply to e-mailed questions.  Julius Baer’s total assets increased by 7 percent last
