European Central Bank policy makers
may want more time to weigh a proposal presented by Ireland
today to restructure the cost of bailing out former  Anglo Irish
Bank  Corp., according to a person with knowledge of the matter.  A decision is unlikely within the next 24 hours as some
members of the ECB’s governing council want to discuss the
blueprint with their own central banks first, said the person,
who asked not to be identified, as the matter is private.  Some policy makers are concerned that the Irish proposal
could set a precedent in the euro area and needs to be weighed
carefully, the person said.      A spokeswoman for the ECB in Frankfurt said that the talks
are ongoing, and declined to comment further. The plan, which
needs ECB approval, will see the state swap so-called promissory
notes used to rescue Anglo for long-term sovereign bonds, which
will be held by the nation’s central bank, according to people
with knowledge of the matter.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
