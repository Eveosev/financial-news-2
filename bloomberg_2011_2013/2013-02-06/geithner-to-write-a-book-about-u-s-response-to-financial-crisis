Timothy F. Geithner , who ended his
term as Treasury secretary in January, is planning to write a
book about the U.S. response to the 2008 financial crisis,
according to a person familiar with his plans.  Geithner, 51, will write about his decision-making role at
the Treasury the last four years and as president of the Federal
Reserve Bank of New York from 2003 to 2009, said the person, who
asked not to be identified because Geithner has yet to meet with
publishers.  Geithner also is joining the Council on Foreign Relations
this month as a full-time distinguished fellow in New York,
where the organization is based, the group said today. He plans
to participate in a conference for council members early next
month, the person said.  “There will be very strong demand for Geithner’s book,
probably surpassed only by an eventual Bernanke book,” said
 Tony Fratto , a White House and Treasury spokesman during the
Administration of  George W. Bush , referring to Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke . “Tim really was at the center of every important
debate and decision involving the financial crisis and economic
policy making in the Obama administration.”  Geithner “will have an opportunity to be an influential
voice on policy debates for a very long time,” said Fratto, a
partner at Hamilton Place Strategies, a policy and
communications consulting firm in Washington.  Oversaw Bailouts  As President  Barack Obama ’s Treasury secretary starting in
January 2009, Geithner oversaw bailouts of companies including
Citigroup Inc. and General Motors Co., steered the financial-
rules revamp and negotiated with congressional leaders on the
budget and debt limit. Obama has nominated  Jack Lew , his former
chief of staff, to replace Geithner.  In 2008, then-Treasury Secretary  Henry Paulson , Bernanke
and Geithner as New York Fed chief initiated the bailouts of
Wall Street banks and insurer American International Group Inc.
and allowed Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. to go into bankruptcy.
At the Treasury, Geithner was the administration’s point man on
the Dodd-Frank law aimed at preventing another financial
meltdown.  During the U.S. and the European debt crisis starting in
2009, Geithner pushed for measures aimed at preventing failing
banks from infecting other parts of the economy. That emphasis
on stopping contagion dates to his work as a Treasury
international affairs official during the Asian crisis that
spread from Thailand in 1997.  Paulson Memoir  Geithner’s book will follow Paulson’s 2010 crisis memoir,
“On the Brink.” Paulson is now the chairman of the Paulson
Institute, a non-partisan group at the University of Chicago
that promotes sustainable growth and focuses on the U.S. and
China.  Paul O’Neill , Treasury secretary in 2001-2002, cooperated
with the writing of a book about the Bush administration after
being ousted by the president.  Robert Rubin , Treasury secretary
under President  Bill Clinton , also wrote a book after leaving
office.  Geithner is being represented by  Robert Barnett , a partner
at Williams & Connolly LLP who has worked for  Clinton , former
Federal Reserve Chairman  Alan Greenspan  and country singer
 Shania Twain .  The Council on Foreign Relations is a non-partisan
organization providing analysis on policy issues including
defense, the environment, economics and terrorism. It’s headed
by  Rubin  and  Carla Hills , chairman and chief executive officer
of Hills & Co.  To contact the reporters on this story:
