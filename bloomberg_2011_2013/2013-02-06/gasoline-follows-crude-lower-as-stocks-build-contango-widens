Gasoline futures fell, following
crude lower after an industry report yesterday showed increases
in supplies. The March contract’s discount to April widened.  Gasoline for March delivery slipped as much as 0.7 percent.
The American Petroleum Institute said yesterday that U.S.
inventories of the fuel grew by 1.56 million barrels. Supplies
in the central Atlantic Coast region, including New York Harbor,
increased 2.28 million barrels. Crude sank 1.2 percent as the
API said stockpiles gained 3.63 million barrels.  “The market is off today, I think it’s looking for a build
of crude inventories, and motor gasoline could be up as well,”
said  Andrew Lebow , a senior vice president at Jefferies Bache
LLC in New York.  Gasoline futures were down 1.9 cents, or 0.6 percent, to
$3.018 a gallon at 9:50 a.m. on the New York Mercantile
Exchange.  The March-April spread increased 0.95 cent to 17.67 cents a
gallon, the biggest contango since Feb. 29, indicating near-term
supplies of fuel are adequate. The March contract represents
winter-grade fuel, which is easier to produce, while the April
contract is for summer-grade gasoline.  API collects stockpile information on a voluntary basis
from operators of refineries, bulk terminals and pipelines. The
government requires that reports be filed with the Energy
Department for its weekly survey.  Government Report  The Energy Information Administration report may show
supplies of oil increased 2.65 million barrels last week,
according to the median of eight responses in a Bloomberg survey
of analysts. Gasoline stockpiles gained 900,000 barrels and
distillate inventories declined 625,000 barrels in the survey.  Heating oil futures were down 1.34 cents, or 0.4 percent,
to $3.1779 a gallon on the Nymex. API said distillate
inventories fell 1.45 million barrels last week.  Gasoline at the  pump , averaged nationwide, rose 1.3 cents
to $3.546 a gallon, AAA said on its website today. Prices gained
for the 20th straight day and are 1.9 percent higher than a year
ago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
