Aflac Inc. , the largest seller of
supplemental health insurance, fell the most since 2011 after
forecasting profit that fell short of analysts’ estimates.  The insurer declined 3.6 percent to $51.59 at 11:22 a.m. in
New York, the fifth-worst performance in the Standard & Poor’s
500 Index. Earlier, the decline was 7.5 percent, the steepest
since August 2011. The Columbus, Georgia-based company gave 2013
earnings guidance yesterday after reporting fourth-quarter
profit climbed 8 percent to $581 million, or $1.24 a share.  A weaker yen is pressuring results at Aflac, which gets
most of its revenue in Japan. Operating profit may be $6.37 to
$6.57 a share this year if the yen averages 90 per dollar, Chief
Executive Officer  Dan Amos  said in a statement yesterday. That
falls short of the $6.61 average estimate of 21 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg.  “What seems to be going on is that the slowdown in growth
that has been under way for years in the U.S. for Aflac and the
deterioration in profit margins in Aflac’s flagship Japan
business may finally be showing up in lower profitability
overall,”  Eric Berg , an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said in
a note to clients today.  The yen weakened 10 percent in the fourth quarter to 86.75
per dollar and traded at 93.55 today in New York.  Berg cut his estimate for 2013 earnings per share to $6.45
from $7.04 “largely to reflect the negative impact from weaker
yen forecasts.”  Stock Price  Aflac’s operating return on equity has long outstripped
other life insurers, which has helped the company  command  a
higher stock price relative to book value, a measure of assets
minus liabilities, Berg said. The metric slipped to 21 percent
in the fourth quarter from 25 percent in the prior quarter and
23 percent a year earlier.  “It is only one quarter, but it is concerning,” Berg
wrote. “Should the ROE be headed down permanently and
profoundly, the stock could get hit.”  New annualized premium sales in Japan rose 1.5 percent in
the fourth quarter and 31 percent in 2012, Aflac said in the
statement. In the U.S., sales rose less than 1 percent in 2012,
and are projected to advance as much as 5 percent in 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
