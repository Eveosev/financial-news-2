The University of Arkansas toppled
the second-ranked University of Florida 80-69 in men’s college
basketball.  In the other top-five game last night, third-ranked
Michigan defeated No. 10 Ohio State 76-74 in overtime in a Big
Ten conference matchup.  B.J. Young scored 13 points at Bud Walton Arena in

1 SEC) and Scottie Wilbekin added 14.  At Crisler Center in Ann Arbor, Michigan, Trey Burke hit a
3-pointer 36 seconds into overtime for a 75-72 lead and Ohio
State never caught up. The Buckeyes were held to two points
during the five-minute overtime, scoring on Aaron Craft’s layup
with less than a minute left.  Ohio State’s Lenzelle Smith Jr., who had 10 points, hit a
jumper with 29 seconds left to tie the game at 72-72 and send it
