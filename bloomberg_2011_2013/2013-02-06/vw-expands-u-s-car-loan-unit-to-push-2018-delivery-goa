Volkswagen AG  expanded its U.S. auto-
loan unit’s central customer-service office to increase the
workforce 28 percent as part of a push by Europe’s biggest
carmaker to reach the top spot in global vehicle deliveries.  The company spent $10 million upgrading the main office of
VW Credit Inc. in Libertyville, Illinois, and plans to create
150 jobs there through 2018, Wolfsburg, Germany-based Volkswagen
said today in a statement.  The manufacturer has set 2018 as the deadline for
overtaking  Toyota Motor Corp.  and  General Motors Co.  as the
world’s biggest carmaker. It’s targeting annual U.S. sales by
then of 1 million VW and Audi vehicles, 72 percent more than
last year’s figure. Deliveries of those brands in the country
jumped 31 percent in 2012, propelled by the U.S.-made version of
VW’s Passat sedan.  The lending unit’s expansion, “coupled with increased U.S.
sales among all our brands in 2012, aligns with Volkswagen’s
ambitious growth strategy,” Tim Mahoney, head of marketing at
the Volkswagen of America unit, said in the statement.  Volkswagen said last month that it will build its best-
selling Golf hatchback in Mexico for sale in North and South
America. It opened the Passat plant in Chattanooga, Tennessee,
in 2011.  The current workforce at the Libertyville site totals about
530 people, VW said. The project, which added 30,000 square feet
(2,700 square meters) of space, began in April 2012.  VW Credit increased the number of new loan and contracts by
28 percent to 404,947 last year, the unit said. The number of
current contracts rose 13 percent to a record 950,873
agreements, with total assets jumping 18 percent to $23 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
