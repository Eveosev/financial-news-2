Genworth Financial Inc., the life
insurer and mortgage guarantor, said sustained low interest
rates could cut operating earnings by about 13 cents a share in
2015.  The reduction, which takes hedges into account, will
probably be about 7 cents this year and 11 cents in 2014,
according to a projection by the Richmond, Virginia-based
insurer today in a  presentation  on its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
