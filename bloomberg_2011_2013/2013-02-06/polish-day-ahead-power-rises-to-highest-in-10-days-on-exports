Day-ahead electricity in Poland
increased as exports jumped amid lower-than-expected wind output
in Germany and an unplanned outage.  Electricity  for the next day increased 4.1 percent to
169.47 zloty ($54.87) a megawatt-hour, exchange data compiled by
Bloomberg show. That’s the highest level since Jan. 28.  Poland was set to export 1,244 megawatts of electricity
from 12 a.m. to 1 a.m. tomorrow, compared with 804 megawatts at
the same time today, according to data from grid manager PSE SA.
PGE SA, Poland’s largest utility, halted a 370-megawatt power
unit at its Belchatow plant for an unplanned outage set to last
two days, the utility said on its website.  Output from wind turbines in Germany was below the forecast
of Meteologica SA, and expected to continue falling tomorrow,
according to the website of the Madrid-based weather forecaster.  Day-ahead electricity on the coupled markets of the  Czech
Republic  and Slovakia rose 12 percent to 48.88 euros ($66.11) a
megawatt-hour in a daily auction, according to the countries’
market operators. Hungarian day-ahead power settled 12 percent
higher at 48.90 euros a megawatt-hour.  Polish power for 2014 increased for a third day, gaining
0.2 percent to 164.50 zloty a megawatt-hour, broker data on
Bloomberg showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
