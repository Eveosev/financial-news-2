Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan are
discussing proposals for building a pipeline to deliver Turkmen
natural gas to Europe across the Caspian Sea.  The Caspian states are also working on a draft agreement
with the European Union on providing political support for the
pipeline, Azeri Industry and Energy Minister  Natiq Aliyev  told
reporters today in the capital, Baku.  “Turkmenistan is saying it’s ready to sell about 30
billion cubic meters of gas a year to the European Union on its
own shores of the Caspian Sea,” Aliyev said. “Azerbaijan wants
Turkmenistan to sell the fuel on the Azeri shores.”  EU nations are seeking to diversify their sources of gas to
curb dependence on Russian deliveries, which have been disrupted
several times en route through Ukraine. Russia has repeatedly
voiced opposition to the idea of building a pipeline across the
Caspian, citing environmental reasons.  The proposed Trans-Caspian gas link is an important element
of the EU’s planned Southern Gas Corridor, Aliyev said.  Aliyev said the pipeline project will cost more than the $3
billion estimated in the 1990s, with the section along the
seabed alone requiring $2 billion of investment, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
