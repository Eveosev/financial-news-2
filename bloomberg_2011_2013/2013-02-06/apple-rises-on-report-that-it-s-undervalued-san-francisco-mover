Apple Inc.  rallied in late-morning
trading in New York on a report that cited  Bill Miller , a fund
manager at Legg Mason Inc., as saying that the shares are
undervalued.  Apple rose as much as 1.9 percent to $466.50, reversing an
earlier decline. The shares had climbed 0.8 percent to $461.70
as of 12:12 p.m., and through yesterday, declined 14 percent so
far this year.  The maker of iPhones has lost about a third of its value
since reaching a record on Sept. 19 amid investor concerns about
slowing sales, narrowing profit margins and competition from
 Samsung Electronics Co.  in a saturated smartphone market. Miller
said Apple stock could be worth 50 percent more, according to
the Financial Times, while some traders are also speculating
that more cash will be returned to shareholders.  “The stock is undervalued, it’s ridiculous,”  Brian White ,
an analyst at Topeka Capital Markets Inc., said in an interview.  Apple needs to offer some cash to entice value investors,
White said.  “They need something that makes a statement to attract
value investors,” he said.  Last year, Cook reinstated the company’s  dividend , offering
a payout for the first time since 1995. Apple’s indicated
dividend yield has climbed to 2.3 percent as the stock has
fallen, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Peter Oppenheimer , Apple’s chief financial officer, said on
the company’s recent earnings conference call on Jan. 23 that
management was considering increasing cash returns to
shareholders.  To contact the reporter on this story:
