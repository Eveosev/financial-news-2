Workers building sites and
infrastructure for the 2014 Winter Olympics in Russia’s Black
Sea city of Sochi are being exploited and cheated out of their
wages, according to Human Rights Watch.  Employers have forced some workers to work 12-hour shifts
with few days off, withheld passports and work permits and
refused to pay promised salaries, the New York-based human
rights body said in a 67-page report released today.  President  Vladimir Putin  has sought to attract large
international events, which also include the 2018 soccer World
Cup and last year’s Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit.
Russia has spent $50 billion on the preparation for the Sochi
Olympics.  “Like the athletes competing in the 2014 Winter Olympics,
Russia has big hopes and dreams for its performance in Sochi as
the host,” Jane Buchanan, associate Europe and Central Asia
director at Human Rights Watch and author of the report, said in
an e-mailed statement. “But exploiting workers is a victory for
no one and Russia urgently needs to change course.”  Human Rights Watch, which documented the treatment of
migrant workers at key Olympic venues including the Central
Olympic Stadium and the Main Olympic Village and other
construction sites, said it had interviewed 66 laborers from
2009 to 2012.  12-Hour Shifts  The workers were from Armenia, Kyrgyzstan, Serbia,
Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and Ukraine and reported earning between
$1.80 to $2.60 an hour. One group of laborers employed in
building the media center, the hub for journalists covering the
Games, worked for months without wages hoping to be paid, the
rights group said. Many other workers reported that employers
withheld the first month’s pay, according to Human Rights Watch.  The migrants were housed in overcrowded accommodation and
fed insufficiently given the long hours they worked, Human
Rights Watch said. Shifts typically last 12 hours from 8 a.m to
8 p.m. and 8 p.m to 8 a.m for seven days a week with one day off
every two weeks, in violation of Russian law, it said.  Deputy Prime Minister  Dmitry Kozak , who is responsible for
the Olympics preparations, said while abuses of workers’ rights
may be occurring, they are not on a large scale.  With 96,000 workers employed by 500 companies on 800
construction sites, “it would be impossible not to have such
incidents,” he told reporters in Sochi yesterday.  To contact the reporters on this story:
