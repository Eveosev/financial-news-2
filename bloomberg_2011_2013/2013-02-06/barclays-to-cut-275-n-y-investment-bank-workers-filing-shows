Barclays Plc’s  investment-banking
business plans to eliminate 275 jobs at three New York City
locations in May, according to a filing with state regulators.  Reductions will occur May 15 and in the two weeks
thereafter, the London-based firm said today in a filing with
New York’s Department of Labor.  Kerrie Cohen , a spokeswoman for
Barclays, didn’t immediately respond to an e-mail seeking
comment on the filing.  Antony Jenkins , 51, who took over as chief executive 
officer last year after the bank agreed to pay a then-record 
fine for attempting to manipulate the London interbank offered 
rate and other benchmark interest rates, will update investors 
next week on the bank’s review of its strategy. The firm said 
this week it will cut its bonus pool as it sets aside an 
additional 1 billion pounds ($1.6 billion) to cover mis-selling 
of payment-protection insurance and other products.  Job cuts disclosed in today’s filing affect Barclays
offices at 200 Park Ave., 745 Seventh Ave. and 1301 Avenue of
the Americas, the document shows.  To contact the reporter on this story:
