GEA Group AG  dropped the most in more
than 16 months in Frankfurt trading as the 2013 profit forecast
of the German maker of food-processing equipment missed
analysts’ estimates.  The company predicts earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization to rise to about 700 million euros
($948 million) from 598 million euros in 2012, GEA said today.
The average estimate of 23 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg is for
727 million euros. The stock declined as much as 8.8 percent,
the biggest drop since Sept. 2011.  GEA, which was founded in 1881 as a metals trading company
and today makes milking machines and beer-brewing kit, is facing
declining sales in Europe, its biggest market, as clients cut
spending amid the region’s debt crisis. Sales in western Europe
slipped 1 percent in 2012, while increasing 22 percent in North
America and 11 percent in the Asia-Pacific region, according to
a  presentation  on the company’s website.  “The 700 million euros that they’re guiding for 2013 isn’t
bad at all, but consensus had crawled ahead of that,” said
 Eerik Budarz , a Frankfurt-based Westend Brokers analyst who
recommends buying GEA shares. The stock may also drop today
because it “performed well in recent weeks” and “2012
profitability was also a little bit below the consensus.”  The stock dropped as much as 2.36 euros to 24.61 euros  and
was down 4.5 percent as of 9:55 a.m., valuing the company at 5
billion euros. Before today, the stock of the Dusseldorf-based
company had risen 10 percent since the start of the year while
Germany’s DAX index gained 0.7 percent.  ‘Moderate Growth’  Ebitda declined 2 percent to 598 million euros last year,
missing the average analyst estimate for 646.7 million euros.
Operating profit excluding one-time effects climbed 7.1 percent
to 562 million euros.  Revenue grew 5.6 percent to 5.72 billion euros last year
while order intake rose 5.2 percent to 5.9 billion euros. The
company predicted “moderate” revenue growth this year.  Competitor  Alfa Laval AB  reported fourth-quarter net income
that beat analyst estimates yesterday. The Lund, Sweden-based
company said orders rose in western Europe even after the 17
countries that share the euro entered a recession in the third
quarter. Growth was static in the U.S.  GEA proposed a dividend to shareholders of 0.55 euros per
share. Net debt fell 62 million euros to 326 million euros as of
Dec. 31. The company will publish its full annual report on
March 11.  Sebastian Growe , a Frankfurt-based Commerzbank analyst,
said while GEA’s 2013 profit prediction is about 4 percent below
market expectations, the company could raise its forecast.  “As there is still some uncertainty in the macroeconomic
landscape despite the recent improvement in sentiment
indicators, GEA’s guidance should be regarded as a conservative
initial outlook that might be raised during the year,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
