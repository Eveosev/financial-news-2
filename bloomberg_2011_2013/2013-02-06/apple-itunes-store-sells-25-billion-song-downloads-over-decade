Apple Inc. said 25 billion songs have
been downloaded from its iTunes digital music store.  ITunes Store now offers more than over 26 million songs for
down load in 119 countries, Apple said in a statement today.  Since its debut 10 years ago, the iTunes Store has helped
propel Apple to the worldâ€™s most valuable technology company by
boosting sales of the iPod music players and paving the way for
the iPhone and iPad.  Apple was up 1.6 percent at $465.13 in New York. The shares
have declined 14 percent so far this year through yesterday.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
