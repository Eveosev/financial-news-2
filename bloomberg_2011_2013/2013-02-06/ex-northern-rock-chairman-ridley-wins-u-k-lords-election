Matthew Ridley , who quit as chairman
of  Northern Rock Plc  in 2007 after it became the first British
bank to experience a run in 140 years, won a rare election to
the upper chamber of Parliament, the House of Lords.  The Lords is usually described as an unelected chamber, as
most of its members are there by appointment. Even so, under a
deal negotiated with  Tony Blair ’s government, 90 of its members
come from Britain’s hereditary nobility and are selected by a
vote from among their number.  Parliament currently lists 183 nobles as eligible to vote.
In today’s election, 46 ballots were cast, with 27 candidates
standing. In second place behind Ridley was  Douglas Hogg , a
former Conservative minister who left the lower House of Commons
in the 2010 election. He had been revealed in a 2009 scandal as
having claimed expenses to clean the moat around his country
house.  To contact the reporter on this story:
