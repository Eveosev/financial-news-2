David Clarkson  scored two goals to
lead the New Jersey Devils to a 3-1 win against the New York
Rangers in the National Hockey League.  It was the first meeting between the teams since the Devils
defeated the Rangers in six games in May to reach the Stanley
Cup Final.  Adam Henrique , who scored the series-winning goal in last
yearâ€™s Eastern Conference finals, put the Devils ahead in the
first period last night at Prudential Center in Newark, New
Jersey.  Clarkson doubled the advantage with 53 seconds remaining in
the opening period and added another goal in the third period
for the Devils (5-1-3).  Chris Kreider  scored midway through the
third period for the Rangers (4-5-0).  Also last night in the Atlantic Division, the Pittsburgh
Penguins beat the New York Islanders 4-2.  James Neal ,  Simon Despres ,  Brandon Sutter  and  Pascal Dupuis 
scored for the Penguins (7-3-0), who won their fourth straight
game.  Michael Grabner  and  Brad Boyes  got goals for the Islanders
(4-4-1) in the final period at Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum
in Uniondale, New York.  The Penguins lead the five-team Atlantic Division with 14
points, followed by the Devils with 13, the Islanders with nine
points and the Rangers and Philadelphia Flyers with eight
points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
