Canaccord Financial Inc. , Canada’s
largest non-bank brokerage, said fiscal third-quarter profit
quadrupled as foreign acquisitions boosted revenue. Results fell
short of analysts’ estimates.  Profit for the period ended Dec. 31 was C$10.3 million
($10.3 million), or 8 cents a share, compared with C$2.5
million, or 1 cent, a year earlier, the Toronto-based firm said
today in a statement. Revenue rose 56 percent to C$230 million.  The company’s Canaccord Genuity unit had record advisory
revenue of C$69.3 million in the quarter, an 80 percent increase
and posted growth in its U.K. management business. The
investment bank said it led or co-led 33 transactions globally
in the quarter for proceeds of C$888 million.  “Over half of Canaccord’s revenue is now earned in markets
outside of Canada,” Paul Reynolds, president and chief
executive officer, said in a statement.  The company recorded “restructuring costs and other
significant items” of C$11.9 million. Excluding that, Canaccord
earned 17 cents a share, missing the 20-cent-a-share average of
four  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  Canaccord rose 0.7 percent to C$7.58 at 4 p.m. trading in
Toronto.  (Canaccord will hold a conference call to discuss quarterly
results at 5 p.m. Toronto time at +1-888-231-8191 in North
America or at
