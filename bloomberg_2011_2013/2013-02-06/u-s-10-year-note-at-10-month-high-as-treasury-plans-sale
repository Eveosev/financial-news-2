Treasury 10-year note yields fell
after  reaching  almost the highest level since April as the
government announced plans to sell $72 billion of notes and
bonds next week.  The Treasury called on Congress to pass a longer-term
increase to the U.S. debt limit as it said the government will
sell its first issue of floating-rate notes within the next
year. The 10-year note yield straddled 2 percent for a sixth
day. Federal Reserve bond purchases will reach $1.14 trillion
before the current stimulus program expires in the first quarter
of 2014, according to the median estimate of 44 economists in a
Bloomberg survey.  “Two percent is an important pivot point in the market
right now,” said  Jason Rogan , director of U.S. government
trading at Guggenheim Partners LLC, a New York-based brokerage
for institutional investors. “There is concern about the
sequester and what’s going on in D.C. We also have buybacks
almost every day this month, which continue to support
Treasuries.”  The 10-year  yield  fell four basis points, or 0.04
percentage point, to 1.96 percent at 5:17 p.m. New York time,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. It rose earlier to
2.01 percent. The yield reached 2.06 on Feb. 4, the most since
April 12. The 1.625 percent security maturing in November 2022
advanced 10/32, or $3.13 per $1,000 face value, to 97 1/32.  Yields on 30-year bonds decreased four basis points to 3.17
percent after rising earlier to 3.23 percent. They reached 3.25
percent on Feb. 4, the highest since April 5.  Price Swings  Treasury market volatility rose as measured by the Bank of
America Merrill Lynch  MOVE index  rose to 64.8 yesterday from
63.1. The measure has climbed from 53.6 on Jan. 23, and since
Jan. 25 has held above 59.7, the average since the Fed announced
its $40 billion a month mortgage purchase plan of Sept. 13.  The selloff that has driven Treasury  10-year notes  to their
worst yearly start since 2009 is poised to reverse, according to
Bank of America Corp., citing analysis of trading patterns.  The 10-year yield reached beyond 2.05 percent two days ago
while failing to move higher, instead falling on a 10-minute
chart, signaling the start of a so-called five-wave move,
according to  MacNeil Curry , chief rates and currencies technical
strategist in New York at the firm’s Bank of America Merrill
Lynch unit. In Elliott Wave analysis, that pattern signals price
direction may be about to change. A declined through 1.93
percent on the benchmark note yield would confirm the bullish
trend, Curry said.  Debt Issues  Treasury’s debt-limit-increase request follows President
Barack Obama on Feb. 4 signing legislation temporarily
suspending the $16.4 trillion debt limit until May 18.  “We plan to issue a final rule on floating-rate notes in
the coming months, with the first floating-rate-note auction
still expected to occur within the next year,” the Treasury
announced in a statement in Washington today. The statement also
said it expects to gradually increase the issuance of Treasury
Inflation Protected Securities in 2013.  “The only really surprising thing was the gradual”
increase in TIPS issuance, said  Aaron Kohli , an interest-rate
strategist BNP Paribas SA in New York, one of 21 primary dealers
that trade with the Fed. “I think a lot of the market was
expecting more significant increases.”  The U.S. will also sell $32 billion in  three-year notes  on
Feb. 12, $24 billion in 10-year notes on Feb. 13, and $16
billion in 30-year bonds on Feb. 14.  Refunding Plans  The Treasury has kept its so-called quarterly refunding
auctions unchanged at $72 billion since November 2010. Given the
government’s financing needs, it sells three-, 10- and 30-year
securities each month in addition to its historical quarterly
offerings.  Thirty-year Treasuries have handed investors a 5.2 percent
loss in 2013 through yesterday, according to Bank of America
Merrill Lynch indexes. January’s decline of 4.3 percent was the
biggest since March 2012, the data show. The securities gained
2.5 percent last year.  The Fed’s price indicator for the period from 2018 to 2023,
known as the  five-year five-year  forward break-even rate,
climbed to 2.93 percent last week, the most since August 2011.  The broad Treasury market is down 1.1 percent this year
through yesterday, according to Bank of America figures. The
 MSCI All-Country World Index  of shares jumped 4.6 percent
including reinvested dividends.  The Fed said Jan. 30 it’s committed to buying about $85
billion of government and mortgage securities a month as long as
the jobless rate stays above 6.5 percent and inflation is below
2.5 percent.  Unemployment  rose to 7.9 percent in January and
consumer-price gains remain below the central bank’s target. The
U.S. economy contracted 0.1 percent in the fourth quarter.  The central bank bought $3.65 billion of Treasuries
maturing from November 2018 to January 2020 today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
