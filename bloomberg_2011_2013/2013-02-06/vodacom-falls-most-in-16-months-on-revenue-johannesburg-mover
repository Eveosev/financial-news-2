Vodacom Group Ltd. , the largest
provider of mobile-phone services in South Africa, declined the
most in more than 16 months after third quarter domestic revenue
contracted.  The  stock  retreated 4.2 percent, the biggest daily drop
since September 2011, to 116.20 rand in Johannesburg. It fell to
its lowest level since Nov. 9, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Volume traded was three times the three-month daily
average. Today’s drop wiped 7.7 billion rand ($858 million) off
the company’s market value.  Revenue from mobile voice, accounting for about half of
domestic receipts, fell 2.3 percent to 7.6 billion rand ($850
million) for the three months through December, the company said
today. Contribution from mobile messaging contracted 5.6 percent
to 777 million rand.  “It’s a warning sign, a negative indicator, for mobile
pricing going forward because of competition and aggressive
promotion,” said  Kate Turner-Smith , sub-Saharan Africa research
analyst at Cape Town-based BPI Capital Africa, in a phone
interview today. “The results weren’t bad enough to warrant
such a decline.”  The number of active customers rose about 12 percent to
30.6 million in the quarter compared to a year earlier, the
company said. Total revenue grew 1.7 percent to 18.3 billion
rand. U.K-based Vodafone Group Plc owns 65 percent in Vodacom,
