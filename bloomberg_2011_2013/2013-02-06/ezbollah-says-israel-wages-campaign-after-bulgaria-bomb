Israel is behind a campaign of
accusation and incitement against Hezbollah, said  Naim Qassem ,
the group’s deputy secretary-general, a day after Bulgaria
linked his militant, Iranian-backed group to a bus bombing.  “Israel is leading a campaign at the global level to
confront the resistance in Lebanon and Palestine” after it
failed to crush it militarily, Qassem was cited as saying by
Lebanon’s official National News Agency.  He didn’t refer directly to yesterday’s statement from
Bulgarian Interior Minister  Tsvetan Tsvetanov  that his country
had found “evidence of links and financing” to Hezbollah after
the July bus bombing that killed five Israelis and their
Bulgarian driver in the Black Sea town of Burgas.  The resistance will increase its readiness and training,
said Qassem, whose group is designated a terrorist group by the
U.S. and Israel.  “All these accusations against Hezbollah won’t change
anything or change facts and realities,” Qassem said. “We will
not yield to these pressures or change our priorities.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
