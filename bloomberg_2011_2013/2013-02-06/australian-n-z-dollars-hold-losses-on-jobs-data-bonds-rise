Australia’s dollar touched the
weakest level since November after employment data failed to
signal improvement that would rule out further easing by the
central bank to support the economy.  The so-called Aussie swayed between gains and losses after
the figures showed a lower-than-expected unemployment rate and
an increase in payrolls. The number of full-time jobs declined
while part-time employment increased, according to the report.
The Reserve Bank of Australia said this week the inflation
outlook “would afford scope to ease policy further” after it
kept borrowing costs at a half-century low. New Zealand’s dollar
slid on data showing that employers cut jobs.  “The details in the jobs data are less impressive than the
headline number, and that will temper any gains in the Aussie
dollar,” said  Mitul Kotecha , Hong Kong-based head of currency
strategy at Credit Agricole SA. “It was slightly better than
expected, but it’s mostly driven by part-time jobs. I don’t
think this will change the RBA perspective.”  The Aussie touched $1.0297, matching the lowest since Nov.
16, before trading at $1.0332 at 6:12 p.m. in Sydney, little
changed from yesterday’s close. It fell 1.1 percent in the
previous two sessions. Australia’s currency fetched 96.73 yen
from 96.63 yesterday, when it lost 0.7 percent.  New Zealand’s dollar weakened 0.3 percent to 83.73 U.S.
cents and touched 83.52, the lowest since Jan. 31. The so-called
kiwi depreciated 0.3 percent to 78.40 yen.  Employment Data  The number of people employed in Australia increased by
10,400 last month from December, the statistics bureau said in
Sydney today. That compares with the 6,000 gain predicted by the
median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey of economists.  The number of full-time jobs declined by 9,800, and part-
time employment rose by 20,200, today’s report showed.
Australia’s participation rate, a measure of the labor force in
proportion to the population, fell to 65 percent from 65.1
percent a month earlier.  Data yesterday showed Australian  retail sales  fell 0.2
percent in December from the previous month, the longest stretch
of declines in 13 years.  RBA Governor  Glenn Stevens  and his board left the overnight
cash rate target at 3 percent on Feb. 5. Interest-rate swaps
data compiled by Bloomberg show traders see a 50 percent chance
the RBA will lower the rate on March 5.  The  yield  on Australia’s 10-year bonds fell six basis
points, or 0.06 percentage point, to 3.47 percent.  Demand for New Zealand’s currency was limited as data
signaled jobseekers gave up searching for work.  N.Z. Jobs  Employment slumped 1 percent, or 23,000 jobs, from the
third quarter, Statistics New Zealand said today in Wellington.
The median forecast in a Bloomberg survey was for a 0.4 percent
gain. The jobless rate fell to 6.9 percent from 7.3 percent as
the participation rate reached the lowest in eight years.  “The fall in the currency was to be expected given the
drop off in employment and the participation rate, but we look
at these levels as a chance to buy the dips, particularly
against the Aussie dollar,” said  Mike Jones , a currency
strategist at Bank of New Zealand in Wellington. “Labor market
figures are a lagging indicator and the broader picture is one
where the New Zealand economy appears to be accelerating.”  Australia’s dollar rose 0.4 percent to NZ$1.2343 from
yesterday, when it slid to NZ$1.222, the lowest since July 2010.  New Zealand’s two-year swap rate, a fixed payment made to
receive a floating rate, fell one basis point to 2.89 percent.  Demand for the so-called Aussie and kiwi was supported
before data tomorrow that may improve the South Pacific nations’
trade prospects. China’s imports probably increased 23.5 percent
in January from a year earlier and exports grew 17.5 percent,
according to the median estimates of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg before the customs administration releases its figures
tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
