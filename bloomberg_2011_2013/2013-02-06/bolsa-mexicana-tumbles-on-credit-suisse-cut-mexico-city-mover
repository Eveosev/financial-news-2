Bolsa Mexicana de Valores SAB , the
Mexican stock and derivatives exchange, plunged the most in six
months after Credit Suisse Group AG became the  fifth  brokerage
firm this year to cut its rating on the stock.  The stock fell 3.7 percent to 31.59 pesos at the close of
Mexico City trading in the biggest drop since July 18. It was
the steepest decline on the IPC index, which fell 0.3 percent.
The stock is down more than 8 percent from a Jan. 11 record of
34.54 pesos.  Derivatives volumes have been “soft” and the timing of a
rebound is unclear, according to a report dated yesterday from 
Credit Suisse , which cut its rating to the equivalent of hold
from buy. Banco Santander SA, Itau Unibanco Holding SA, HSBC
Holdings Plc and JPMorgan Chase & Co. also have cut their
recommendations on the stock in 2013.  Bolsa Mexicana’s “rally has lost some steam,” Credit
Suisse analysts led by  Victor Schabbel  said in the report.
“Still-modest performance on the derivatives side should offset
the compelling figures to be seen in the cash equities
segment.”  A rebound for Mexico City-based Bolsa Mexicana’s
derivatives revenue will rely on the start of new swap contracts
and the move of over-the-counter derivatives to an exchange
environment, the analysts wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
