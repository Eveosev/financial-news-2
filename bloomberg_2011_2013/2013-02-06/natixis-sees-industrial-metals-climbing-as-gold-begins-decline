Lead will have the biggest gains
among industrial metals this year and gold prices will start to
decline on mounting confidence the global economy is recovering,
Natixis Commodity Markets Ltd. said.  Lead will average $2,575 a metric ton this year, 24 percent
higher than in 2012, Natixis said in a report today. Copper’s
average price will rise 6.9 percent to $8,500 a ton, aluminum
will gain 3.6 percent to $2,125 a ton, nickel will increase 6.6
percent to $18,750 a ton and zinc will advance 9.4 percent to
$2,150 a ton, it predicts.  Global equities reached a 21-month high this week and
commodities climbed last week to the highest since September
after China’s expansion accelerated for the first time in two
years and the Federal Reserve signaled it will maintain its
stimulus program to sustain a recovery. The International
Monetary Fund predicts global growth will climb to 3.5 percent
this year from 3.2 percent in 2012, even as it sees a second
year of contraction in the euro area.  “Chinese growth is improving,” Natixis wrote in the
report. “Europe is expected to be past the worst in its fiscal
crisis, even if another year of economic contraction is likely.
The Fed is expected to be able to support growth in the U.S.”  Gold dropped the past four months, the worst run since May.
The Fed said Jan. 30 it will continue to buy securities at the
rate of $85 billion a month, even after minutes released Jan. 3
showed some policy makers favored ending $85 billion in monthly
bond purchases this year. Platinum and palladium prices rallied
this year on concern mine closures in South Africa, the biggest
platinum producer, will curb supplies.  Gold Price  “The potential removal of QE3 now represents a significant
downside risk for gold,” Natixis said, referring to the Fed’s
third round of quantitative easing. “South African platinum
producers are taking a very careful look at their continuing
participation in both the platinum industry and the South
African economy, and platinum prices are responding to an
anticipated reduction in output as a result.”  Gold averaged a record $1,669 an ounce last year. The
figure will fall to $1,625 this year and $1,500 next year,
Natixis said. It sees silver at $29.50 an ounce this year, after
averaging $31.17 in 2012. Platinum averaged $1,552 an ounce last
year and will rise to $1,720 this year. Palladium will climb to
an average of $750 an ounce this year, after averaging $644 in
2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
