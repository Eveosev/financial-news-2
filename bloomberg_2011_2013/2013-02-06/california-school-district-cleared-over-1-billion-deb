A California school district’s
decision to pay almost $1 billion in interest obligations for
borrowing $105 million to build and modernize schools was upheld
by a district-funded examination.  The Poway Unified School District in San Diego County kept
its promise to voters and taxpayers when it deferred all
payments on  bonds  sold to raise the money until 2033, according
to the review by ESI International Inc., released yesterday.
Subsequent debt service will rise from about $30.5 million in
2033 to more than $300 million in both 2046 and 2051, bond
documents show.  Publicity over the amount of interest drew complaints from
local taxpayers and led state Treasurer  Bill Lockyer  and schools
Superintendent  Tom Torlakson  to call for a moratorium on similar
sales of long-term capital-appreciation bonds.  Poway officials put off the largest payments from the 2011
debt issue to limit the short-term interest burden, thereby
abiding by a 2008 election authorizing them to borrow the money
without pushing property taxes higher, according the ESI report.  “The use of premium in this manner did increase the total
amount that taxpayers will repay, although the estimated tax
rate was unaffected and remained the same as represented to the
electors in the bond measures,” investigator Robert Price said
in the report. ESI is based in San Diego, according to its
 website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
