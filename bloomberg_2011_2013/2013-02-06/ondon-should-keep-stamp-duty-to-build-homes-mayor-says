Sales taxes on houses and apartments
in London should be retained by the U.K. capital’s local
government to pay for the building of new homes, Mayor  Boris Johnson  said.  Stamp-duty receipts amounting to 1.3 billion pounds ($2
billion) a year, could be used for a 25-year program to
construct 1 million homes in London, Johnson, who’s been mayor
since 2008, said in an e-mailed statement today.  “Since I was elected, London’s population has grown by
600,000 and is forecast to rise by a further million at least
over the next 25 years,” Johnson said. “If we do not come up
with a new plan to build the homes we need, this great city will
suffer and the whole country will feel the consequences.”  London home sellers pushed up asking prices by 3.6 percent
in January to an average 480,890 pounds, according to property
website operator Rightmove Plc. Prices rose 9.7 percent from a
year earlier, the biggest annual increase since February 2010,
compared with 2.4 percent nationwide.  To contact the reporter on this story:
