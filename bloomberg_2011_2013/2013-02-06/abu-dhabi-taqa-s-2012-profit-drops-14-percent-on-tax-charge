Abu Dhabi National Energy Co. , the
government-controlled utility and oil producer known as Taqa,
said full-year profit dropped 14 percent as one-time costs
offset gains in revenue.  Net income declined to 640 million dirhams ($174 million)
in 2012 from 744 million dirhams the previous year, Taqa said in
an e-mailed statement today. Sales rose 14 percent to 27.5
billion dirhams. A charge related to U.K. tax changes and lower
natural gas prices that hurt returns from its North American
business offset the higher revenue, the company said.  Taqa, owned 75 percent by the Abu Dhabi government, holds
stakes in businesses generating power or producing oil and
natural gas in the Middle East, the North Sea, India and North
America. The company expanded last year by taking over operation
of an oil field in northern Iraq and buying producing crude
deposits in the U.K. North Sea from BP Plc.  The company borrowed in June to expand Morocco’s Jorf
Lasfar power plant, the largest coal-fired facility in the
Middle East. It refinanced debt in December by raising $2
billion from the sale of bonds and arranging a $2.5 billion
revolving credit facility.  To contact the reporter on this story:
