OAO Gazprom , Russia’s gas monopoly,
will soon agree with Socar on Azeri gas deliveries for this
year, privately owned Trend news service said, citing Vladimir
Dorokhin, the Russian ambassador in Baku.  The agreement with State Oil Co. of Azerbaijan will be
signed this month, Dorokhin said today in the Azeri capital,
according to Trend. He didn’t say how much gas Gazprom is going
to buy from Azerbaijan this year.  Last year Gazprom imported 1.55 billion cubic meters of
Azeri gas, almost half of the volume it agreed to buy from
Azerbaijan under a 2012 take-or-pay agreement, a Socar official
said Jan. 31. He didn’t say whether the Russian company will be
fined for buying less fuel than it had agreed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
