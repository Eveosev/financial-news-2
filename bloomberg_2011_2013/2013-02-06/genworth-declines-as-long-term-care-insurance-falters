Genworth Financial Inc.  fell the most
in a month as Chief Executive Officer  Tom McInerney  said he was
disappointed by lower profit from long-term care coverage.  Genworth dropped 3.2 percent to $8.88 at 9:53 a.m. in New
York. The shares have advanced about 18 percent this year.  Profit at the long-term care business slid to $7 million in
the fourth quarter from $28 million a year earlier. Long-term
care policies have proven more costly than Genworth had
forecast, and the company is seeking premium increases on some
policies it’s sold as low interest rates weigh on results.  “McInerney and his team still have plenty of work ahead of
them in terms of improving the company’s core life insurance and
long-term care businesses,”  Mark Palmer , an analyst at BTIG
LLC., wrote in a research note.  To contact the reporter on this story:
