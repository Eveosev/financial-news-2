Spain’s ability to navigate its way
through the crisis is crucial to the future of the euro area as
the currency bloc’s fourth-largest economy has the potential to
weaken the whole region, Fitch Ratings said.  “Spain is a pivotal country with the potential to drag the
euro zone down again,” Fitch Managing Director Ed Parker  said
in Oslo today.  Yields on Spanish debt have started to rise again as
investors signal they want Europe’s governments to do more to
stem the crisis. While European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi ’s July pledge to do whatever it takes to protect the euro
helped eased the turmoil, concern is now growing that more is
needed to address Europe’s bleak economic prospects.  The yield on Spain’s benchmark 10-year bond eased two basis
points today to trade at 5.36 percent as of 10:05 a.m. in
London. That compares with 4.89 percent on Jan. 11.  Ireland will probably gain access to markets this year,
Parker also said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
