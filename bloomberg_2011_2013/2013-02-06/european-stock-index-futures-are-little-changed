European  stocks declined, reversing
earlier gains, as an opinion poll in Italy showed the anti-
austerity campaign of Silvio Berlusconi has boosted the former
premier’s popularity before this month’s elections.  UniCredit SpA and Intesa Sanpaolo SpA led a drop in Italian
shares. Vinci SA, Europe’s biggest builder, slid 3.3 percent
after posting a decline in 2012 profitability. ArcelorMittal
climbed 1.1 percent. Volvo AB jumped 4.2 percent even after
fourth-quarter profit fell as the company predicted its North
American and European markets will improve this year.  The  Stoxx 600  fell 0.4 percent to 284.52 at the close,
after earlier rising as much as 0.4 percent. The equity
benchmark has still gained 1.7 percent this year as U.S.
lawmakers agreed on a budget deal and data signaled the world’s
largest economy is recovering.  “Why is Berlusconi gaining in the polls? It is because he
has a populist campaign that goes completely against” Prime
Minister Mario Monti’s policies, said  Jacques Porta , who helps
manage $627 million at Ofi Patrimoine in Paris. “It’s a very,
very negative signal vis-a-vis Germany. It’s legitimate to see
the market falling.”  Berlusconi narrowed the lead of front-runner Pier Luigi
Bersani to 0.3 percentage points, the poll by Tecne institute
for SkyTG24 showed. That is lower than the survey’s margin of
error of 4 percentage points.  Berlusconi has gained in popularity before the Feb. 24-25
elections as he promised to cut taxes and end a levy on first
homes implemented by Monti’s government. Monti has accused
Berlusconi of trying to buy votes.  Earnings Scorecard  Stocks earlier rallied as companies from ArcelorMittal to
Hargreaves Lansdown Plc posted earnings that beat estimates.  About 52 percent of the 182 western European companies that
have posted earnings in the current reporting season beat
analysts’ projections for profit, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Of the 207 that have posted sales, 53 percent
exceeded sales forecasts.  In the euro area, Germany won’t stand in the way of aid for
Cyprus so long as the Mediterranean nation fulfills the criteria
to qualify for help from Europe’s bailout fund, Deputy Finance
Minister  Steffen Kampeter  said. Kampeter’s comments are the
strongest signal yet that Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government
won’t risk the market turmoil that could result from any
rejection of help for Cyprus.  National benchmark indexes slid in 14 of the 18 western
European markets. Germany’s DAX fell 1.1 percent. France’s CAC
40 lost 1.4 percent. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 gained 0.2 percent.  Italian Stocks  Italy’s benchmark  FTSE MIB Index  slipped 0.7 percent.
UniCredit declined 1.7 percent to 4.28 euros, while Intesa
Sanpaolo retreated 1.6 percent to 1.39 euros.  Vinci dropped 1.21 euros to 35.41 euros. The company
reported a drop in 2012 profitability and said business will
stagnate this year because of the economic slump. Net income as
a percentage of sales dropped to 5 percent from 5.2 percent a
year earlier, the company said. Vinci also said it  expects 
revenue to be “flat” in 2013.  ArcelorMittal rose 13 euro cents to 12.56 euros. The
world’s biggest steelmaker said earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization dropped to $1.32 billion in the
fourth quarter from $1.71 billion a year earlier. That surpassed
the median estimate of $1.25 billion in a survey of analysts.
The company expects Ebitda in 2013 to exceed last year’s $7.1
billion as it ships more steel.  Volvo Gains  Volvo  added 3.90 kronor to 96.85 kronor even after saying
fourth-quarter profit dropped 84 percent. The world’s second-
biggest truck manufacturer reported Ebit of 1.12 billion kronor
($177 million), lower than the average analyst estimate of 2.47
billion kronor.  Volvo said it expects the North American and European
markets to improve in 2013.  Hargreaves Lansdown jumped 11 percent to 817 pence, its
highest price ever. The retail stockbroker reported first-half
pretax profit of 93.7 million pounds ($147 million), beating
analysts’ projection for 91 million pounds.  Pohjola Bank Oyj, the publicly traded unit of co-operative
banking and insurance group OP-Pohjola, slid 5.7 percent to
11.67 euros after warning of possible loan losses. That was the
stock’s biggest decrease in 15 months. Pohjola said prospects
for growth in its loan portfolio are “dimmer” than last year.  Elisa Oyj tumbled 5.4 percent to 16.14 euros, the most
since Oct. 19. The Finnish wireless carrier posted fourth-
quarter sales of 396 million euros, missing the average analyst
estimate of 405.6 million euros. Ebitda in the first half of
2013 will be slightly less than last year, the company said in a
statement.  Eurasian Natural Resources Corp. jumped 9.1 percent to
375.6 pence. The Kazakh metal producer said ferro-alloy and
iron-ore production rose in the fourth quarter.  The number of shares changing hands in companies listed on
the Stoxx 600 was 16 percent higher than the average of the past
30 days, data compiled by Bloomberg showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
