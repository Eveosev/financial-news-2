OAO Sberbank  rallied for a second
day, helping lift Russia’s benchmark stock gauge as the
country’s largest lender hit its depositary receipt conversion
limit.  Sberbank surged as much as 2.2 percent in Moscow, trading
up 1.9 percent at 109.80 rubles by 1:11 p.m and poised for the
highest close since October 2007. The amount of shares traded
was 36 million, equivalent to 43 percent of the three-month
average. Sberbank  increased  2.2 percent to $14.74 in London. The
 extra amount  investors pay to hold the London-traded securities
jumped to 13 cents, the highest since Jan. 31.  Bank of New York Mellon Corp.  halted Sberbank’s depositary
receipt program under which investors convert local shares into
foreign-traded stock, according to a statement dated Feb. 5.
Depositary receipts can only account for 25 percent of a
company’s shares and 50 percent of its listed shares, under
Russian regulations. Sberbank’s  depositary receipts  are
equivalent to four ordinary shares.  “In the short term, this is bullish news for the shares,”
 Mark Rubinstein , head of research at IFC Metropol, said by e-
mail from Moscow. “London investors are forced to buy the stock
from the ones that have already been converted while Moscow
investors are hoping that the program will re-open soon.”  Sberbank has the  largest weighting  on the benchmark Micex
Index at 15 percent. Sberbank said on Jan. 31 its depositary
receipt program had “nearly reached the current overall limit
for creating DRs,” according to a website statement.  The lender has jumped 18 percent this year in Moscow, while
adding 20 percent in London. The  Micex Index  gained 0.7 percent
to 1,551.76. Sberbank led the gains on the  Russian Depositary
Index .  To contact the reporter on this story:
