Indian bonds fell on speculation the
central bank will scale back debt purchases after a cut to
lenders’ reserve requirements left them with more cash.  The government is due to sell 120 billion rupees ($2.3
billion) of notes on Feb. 8 and a further 240 billion rupees
later this month, as part of the scheduled borrowing program,
the Reserve Bank of India said in a statement. The RBI lowered
the amount of cash banks must set aside as reserves by a quarter
of a percentage point to 4 percent on Jan. 29 and said the
reduction would free up 180 billion rupees in funds at banks.  “The CRR cut has diminished the possibility of open-market
purchases,” said  Srinivasa Raghavan , a Mumbai-based executive
vice president of treasury at Dhanlaxmi Bank Ltd. “This is
damping investor sentiment, particularly with large borrowings
still ahead of us this month.”  The yield on the 8.15 percent bonds due June 2022 rose one
basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 7.93 percent as of
11:10 a.m. in Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading
system.  The one-year interest-rate swap, a derivative contract used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, was little
changed at 7.65 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
