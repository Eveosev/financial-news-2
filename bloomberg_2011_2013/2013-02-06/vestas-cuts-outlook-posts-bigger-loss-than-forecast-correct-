Vestas Wind Systems A/S  gained the
most in more than a month in Copenhagen after sales beat
estimates and the world’s biggest wind turbine maker generated
cash in the fourth quarter after three quarters of outflows.  Sales rose 25 percent to 2.5 billion euros ($3.4 billion)
from 2 billion euros in the fourth quarter of 2011, Vestas said
today in its annual report. Analysts had predicted 2.3 billion
euros of revenue, according to the average of 14  estimates  on
Bloomberg. Vestas generated 416 million euros of free cash in
the period, allowing it to cut net debt by 387 million euros.  The wind turbine maker is halfway through a two-year push
to cut its workforce by about 30 percent to 16,000 as it seeks
to return to profitability following two years of losses. It’s
reduced its cost base by more than 250 million euros of the
target for 400 million euros of cuts by the end of 2013.  “The cost initiatives we undertook are really starting to
take effect,” Vestas Chief Executive Officer  Ditlev Engel  said
today in a telephone interview. “In the fourth quarter, we made
a significant rebound in terms of both earnings and free cash-
flow.”  The shares, which have lost almost half their value over
the past year, rose as much as 12 percent in Copenhagen trading,
the most since Jan. 2. They were up 5.4 percent as of 12:28 p.m.
local time.  Shipment Forecast  The Aarhus, Denmark-based manufacturer also lowered its
shipments guidance for 2013 and posted a bigger full-year loss
than analysts estimated in 2012, saying it’s in the middle of
two “extremely difficult years.”  The net loss of 963 million euros for the year exceeded the
prediction of analysts for a shortfall of 228 million euros,
according to the average of 15 forecasts on Bloomberg. It had
701 million euros of special items, including more than 500
million euros of write-downs.  “This is, among other things, due to the fact that we have
chosen to put some factories up for sale as part of our new
business mode,”  Chairman  Bert Nordberg  said. “This is a long,
steady haul, and Vestas is still some distance away from the
finishing line.”  The company said it expects to get 131 million euros from
the sale of unspecified assets, after writing down their value
by 182 million euros and deducting the costs of the sales. Engel
declined to say where the plants for sale are.  ‘Fundamentally Challenged’  Additional cost reductions will come from reducing the
workforce to 16,000 “or lower” during 2013, from 17,778 at the
end of 2012, Chief Financial Officer  Dag Andresen  said today on
a conference call with analysts.  He said the company has “no current plans for a rights
issue,” after analysts at Sanford C. Bernstein Ltd., Sydbank
A/S and SEB AB said in November that the company’s struggle to
generate cash raised the risk of one.  “Vestas remains fundamentally challenged,”  Martin Prozesky , an analyst in London at Bernstein who rates the stock
underperform said today in a note to investors. “The company
faces a cash crisis as payables and orders (pre-payments) are
likely to squeeze cash requirements over the next 12 months.”  Vestas reduced its shipments forecast for 2013 to 4
gigawatts to 5 gigawatts of turbines from previous guidance of
about 5 gigawatts. Revenue for 2013 is likely to be at least 5.5
billion euros, the company said, and it forecast positive free
cash flow and a margin before interest, tax and special items of
“at least 1 percent.”  Government Subsidy  “It was prudent to say with the regulatory uncertainty we
need to be a little more cautious” on the outlook, Engel said,
citing “noise” in countries including Germany and Romania
suggesting government support for clean energy may drop.  Vestas gave no update in its annual report on the talks for
a “strategic cooperation” with  Mitsubishi Heavy Industries
Ltd ., which it announced in August. It said it’s “received
inquiries from potential partners” about the 8-megawatt V164
offshore wind turbine that it’s developing. Engel declined to
comment on both the  Mitsubishi Heavy  talks and the approaches
regarding the V164.  The annual loss compares with a 166 million-euro loss in
2011. Vestas posted a margin on earnings before interest and tax
of 0.1 percent, which was at the low end of its guidance for a
zero to 4-percent margin. It had free cash outflow of 359
million euros.  Revenue totaled 7.2 billion euros, around the middle of its
guidance for 6.5 billion euros to 8 billion euros.  Orders received in 2012 declined 49 percent to 3,738
megawatts totaling 3.8 billion euros. The company had an order
backlog at the end of the year of 7,156 megawatts. The year-end
backlog of turbine and service contract orders totaled 12.4
billion euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
