Universal Entertainment Corp.  fell
after the Japanese pachinko company postponed its earnings
report amid an internal investigation of transactions in its
Philippines business.  The stock  fell  as much 6.1 percent to 1,576 yen, before
closing 0.2 percent lower at 1,675 yen in Tokyo. Universal will
report on Feb. 14 instead of Feb. 8 after a third-party
committee found the “possibility of inappropriate accounting
procedures” related to the Philippines, according to a company
statement yesterday.  The company controlled by billionaire  Kazuo Okada  holds one
of four casino licenses the Philippines awarded in 2008 and 2009
to build and operate a Manila gambling and entertainment
complex. Universal on Jan. 7 said that it formed an independent
panel to look into reports by Reuters and Japan’s Asahi
newspaper that the company made illegal payments to benefit that
casino resort.  Universal filed a lawsuit Dec. 4 in Tokyo District Court
against Thomson Reuters Corp., calling the newswire’s article
about illegal payments a “fabrication” and seeking 200 million
yen ($2.1 million) in damages.  Consultations with its independent accountant will take
some time due to the suggestions from the committee, Universal
said in yesterday’s statement. Okada amassed a fortune making
machines for pachinko, an upright pinball game played as a form
of gambling in Japan.  Bloomberg LP, the parent of Bloomberg News, competes with
Thomson Reuters in selling financial and legal information and
trading systems.  To contact the reporter on this story:
