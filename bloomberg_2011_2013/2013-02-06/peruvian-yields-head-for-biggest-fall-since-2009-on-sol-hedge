Peruvian bond yields registered their
steepest two-day decline since 2009 as investors took advantage
of the world’s lowest hedging costs to boost returns.  The yield on the nation’s 9.91 percent sol-denominated bond
due May 2015 declined 38 basis points, or 0.38 percentage point,
in the past two days to 1.58 percent, according to prices
compiled by Bloomberg. The price rose 0.37 centimo today to
118.14 centimos per sol.  Implied yields on sol forwards, the cost to hedge against
currency fluctuations, dropped last month after Peru raised
banks’ dollar reserve requirements and stepped up purchases in
the currency market, creating a scarcity of greenbacks. Though
the sol has fallen 1.3 percent in the past month, investors
expect the currency to rebound and are drawn by the sol’s low
volatility, said  Alvaro Vivanco , a Latin American strategist in
New York for Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA.  “You have a currency that’s structurally very attractive
and there’s an arbitrage opportunity there so you have
foreigners coming in and buying at the front end,” Vivanco said
in a telephone interview. “Foreign participation in those bonds
will get very high.”  The central bank said on its website it bought $300 million
of U.S. currency today, the most in three weeks.  The sol was little changed at 2.5773 per dollar at today’s
close, according to prices compiled by Bloomberg. The one-month
implied yield on sol forwards is minus 1.47 percent, the lowest
in the world.  To contact the reporter on this story:
