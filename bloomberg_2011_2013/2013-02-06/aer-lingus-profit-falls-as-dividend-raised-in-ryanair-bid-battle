Aer Lingus Group Plc ’s annual profit
fell 52 percent, even as the Irish carrier boosted its dividend
amid a hostile takeover approach from discount rival and
minority investor  Ryanair Holdings Plc .  Pretax profit slumped to 40.6 million euros ($55 million)
from 84.4 million euros a year earlier, the Dublin-based carrier
said in a statement today.  Aer Lingus, locked in a protracted battle to remain
independent after Ryanair’s renewed takeover interest, will lift
its full-year dividend 25 percent to 4 cents a share. The
company said it cannot provide an earnings outlook for 2013
while takeover proceedings are outstanding.  Annual revenue rose 8.2 percent to 1.4 billion euros and
the passenger total increased 1.5 percent to 9.65 million, Aer
Lingus said.  Ryanair, Europe’s largest low-cost carrier, already owns
around 30 percent of Aer Lingus and is seeking approval from
European authorities to take majority control.  To contact the reporter on this story:
