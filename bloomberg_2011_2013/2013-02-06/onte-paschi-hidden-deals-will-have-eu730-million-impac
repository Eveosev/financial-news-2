Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena SpA ,
engulfed by criminal probes into the conduct of its former
management, said 2012 net assets will take a 730 million-euro
($987 million) hit after accounting for structured deals that
hid earlier losses.  Monte Paschi, the subject of investigations spanning from
allegations of market manipulation to false bookkeeping, said
the gross impact on net assets of the trade dubbed Santorini
will be 305.2 million euros, while Alexandria will lead to a
restatement of 272.5 million euros, according to a stock-
exchange statement.  Chief Executive Officer  Fabrizio Viola  and Chairman
 Alessandro Profumo  are trying to reassure investors that Italy’s
third-largest bank will succeed with a turnaround plan that is
central to a 3.9 billion-euro taxpayer bailout due this month.
Monte Paschi is seeking state funds to boost capital after
failing to meet European regulators’ minimum requirements in a
rescue that some lawmakers and consumer groups oppose.  To contact the reporter on this story:
