Steel reinforcement-bar futures in
Shanghai fell for a second day as liquidity waned ahead of the
week-long Lunar New Year holiday and as a gap between futures
and spot prices stoked concern demand will weaken.  Rebar for delivery in May fell by 0.8 percent to close at
4,109 yuan ($659) a metric ton on the Shanghai Futures Exchange.
It rose to 4,235 yuan on Feb. 4, the highest since May 7.  The average spot  price  for rebar was little changed today
at 3,790 yuan a ton, according to data from Beijing Antaike
Information Development Co. China’s markets will be closed all
of next week for the Lunar New Year holidays.  “The gap between futures and spot prices is an indication
that spot demand can’t catch up,”  Zhang Jizhou , a steel trader
at Shanghai Flow International Trade Co., said by phone from
Shanghai today. “Big institutional money has mostly left the
market ahead of the holiday.”  Aggregate open interest of rebar contracts traded on the
Shanghai bourse, fell for the third day today to 1.34 million
contracts, a sign that Chinese investors are pulling money out
of the market before the holiday, Zhang said.  Spot  iron ore  at Tianjin port was unchanged at $154.20 a
dry ton yesterday, according to The Steel Index Ltd.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
