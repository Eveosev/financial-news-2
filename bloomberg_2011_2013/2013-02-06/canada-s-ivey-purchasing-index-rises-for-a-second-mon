Canada’s Ivey purchasing managers’
 index  rose for a second month in January as a measure of
delivery times reached the highest in almost four years,
signaling a rebound in economic growth.  The index rose to 58.9 in January from 52.8 in December and
47.5 in November, exceeding all 12 forecasts in a Bloomberg
economist  survey  that had a 53.9 median estimate. Readings of
more than 50 in the survey by Western University’s business
school in London, Ontario indicate purchasing by governments and
companies advanced.  Canada’s annualized economic growth rate will quicken to
1.8 percent this quarter after slowing to 0.6 percent in the
third quarter as exports and investment slumped, according to a
separate Bloomberg survey last month. Recent reports have shown
the economy grew at the fastest pace in seven months in November
while the  jobless rate  fell to a four-year low in December.  “Recent trends have been positive, suggesting a pick-up in
growth in early 2013 after a disappointing second half last
year,” said  Krishen Rangasamy , senior economist at National
Bank Financial in Montreal.  All related indexes in today’s report were above the 50
level. The  supplier delivery  measure rose to 55.8 from 47.8, the
highest in Bloomberg figures dating to March 2009. The inventory
measure grew to 54.4 from 42.4 while the employment figure
increased to 53.8 from 49.2. The price index fell to 54 from
61.3.  To contact the reporter on this story:
