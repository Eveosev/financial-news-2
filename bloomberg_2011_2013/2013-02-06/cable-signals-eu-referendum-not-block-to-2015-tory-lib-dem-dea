U.K. Business Secretary  Vince Cable 
signaled that Prime Minister  David Cameron ’s plan for a
referendum on European Union membership wouldn’t be an obstacle
to another coalition between their parties in 2015 elections.  The comments show how Cable’s Liberal Democrats are seeking
to keep their options open. They initially criticized the
Conservative Cameron’s call last month for a vote by the end of
2017 after talks on repatriating some powers from the EU.  “I was one of the people who was out there warning about
the dangers of uncertainty,” Cable told Bloomberg Television
today. “We’ve actually probably come out in quite a sensible
place. As far as a referendum goes, all party leaders accept the
principle. The people should be trusted. The differences can be
exaggerated. There’s potentially a good way through this.”  On the day of Cameron’s announcement, Liberal Democrat
leader  Nick Clegg  said "years and years of uncertainty" would
hurt growth.  Cable said he thought Cameron would find allies within the
EU for his agenda. “He’s arguing certain things need reforming
-- we would agree with that,” he said. “A lot of people in the
EU want reform.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
