The presidents of Egypt, Iran and
Turkey have discussed “mechanisms to end the bloodshed” in
Syria, the state-run Middle East News agency said.  In the three-way summit held in Cairo today, Presidents
Mohamed Mursi, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and Abdullah Gul agreed on
the necessity of “empowering” Syrians to put an end to
bloodshed and the destruction of infrastructure, MENA said,
citing Egypt’s presidential spokesman, Yasser Ali.  To contact the reporter on this story:
