European Aeronautic, Defence & Space
Co.  said it’s looking to hire 5,000 people this year amid
surging output of its jetliners and helicopters.  Of the new hires planned, 3,000 will come at Airbus SAS,
which is increasing the build-rate for A330 wide-bodies to 10 a
month from nine, commencing production of the A350 model and
working to bring the A320neo into service by late 2015. Output
at Eurocopter is also gaining as rotor-craft orders increase.  “It’s not just engineers,”  Thierry Baril , human resources
head for both EADS and Airbus, said in an interview. “Given the
growth in production we’ll be hiring in all categories,
including shop-floor workers, technicians and people who work on
the supply chain and procurement.”  The hiring plan will increase the payroll at EADS to more
than 140,000 people and comes after the company added 7,000 new
workers last year, 5,000 of them at Airbus. The jetliner unit
enlisted 1,000 people more than originally envisaged to take
advantage of a positive recruitment drive, Baril said.  Airbus currently has 12,000 people working on the A350
program, a figure that will rise to 16,000 when maximum
production rates are reached. The final-assembly line for the
long-haul plane has 450 staff, which will increase to 1,500.  National Balance  EADS, which also supplies satellites, rockets, jet fighters
and defense electronics, will seek to narrow a gap between the
employment of French and German nationals to reflect its
ownership structure, according to Baril.  Some 39 percent of EADS workers are French, with 34 percent
from Germany, 10 percent the U.K. and 8.5 percent Spain, while
following a shareholder restructuring last year the French and
German governments each own 12 percent of stock, with Spain
controlling 4.4 percent.  BAE Systems Plc , which once held a 20
percent share in Airbus, sold that stake to EADS in 2006.  “It’s easier for us to find aeronautical engineers in
France than in Germany, so we’re redoubling our efforts in
Germany,” Baril said in the interview in Toulouse, France,
where both EADS and Airbus are based. “The goal is to keep the
French-German balance under control.”  Hiring women is also a priority, Baril said. One-quarter of
the engineers hired by EADS in 2012 were female, a positive
proportion given that only 17 or 18 percent of university
students studying aerospace engineering are women, he said.  The U.S. workforce of EADS amounts to 1.8 percent of the
total, though that may rise as Airbus prepares to open an A320
assembly plant in Mobile, Alabama. Ground is due to be broken at
the site before mid-2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
