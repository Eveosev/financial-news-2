Turkey’s parliament starts debating a
draft law to combat terrorist financing today as the country
seeks to avoid suspension by a key Organisation for Economic
Cooperation and Development group.  The OECD’s  Financial Action Task Force  has given Turkey
until  Feb. 22  to adopt the legislation. Turkey has been under
pressure to pass the measure over the past six years. Such a
move would rank it alongside Iran and North Korea.  Justice Minister  Sadullah Ergin  said last month that
suspension would cause serious difficulties for Turkish trade
and the economy.  “It could cause problems in money transfers; foreign
countries may increase scrutiny for transfers from Turkey and
delay the process,” Ergin said. Turkey may also face hurdles
with money transfers and loans that could increase interest
rates and inflation, he said, devastating the $800 billion
economy.  Turkey accuses European states of turning a blind eye to
requests to crack down on Turkish militants, including the
Kurdistan Workers’ Party or PKK, and failing to extradite
suspects. Government lawmakers like Hakki Koylu, deputy chairman
of the parliament’s Justice Commission, say that Turkey’s
definition of terrorism differs from that of Western countries.  Responding to international criticism that the draft law is
inadequate, Koylu said on Jan. 24 that the government would try
to defend the law. Turkey may not meet demands from other
countries to freeze terrorist assets unless they reciprocate,
Ergin said on Jan. 24.  To contact the reporter on this story:
