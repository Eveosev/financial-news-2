Telecom Italia SpA , the country’s
biggest phone carrier, is seeking to extend 3 billion euros ($4
billion) of a credit line a year early, according to three
people with knowledge of the deal.  The company wants the five-year loan to replace part of an
8 billion-euro credit line due August 2014, said the people, who
asked not to be identified because the terms are private.
Marketing of the deal will start this week, they said.  The Milan-based business joins Telefonica SA of Spain,
Italy’s Enel SpA and EDP-Energias de Portugal SA in seeking a
forward-start facility this year. Under a forward start,
borrowers lock in financing terms before existing debt matures.  Telecom Italia extended 4 billion euros of the same loan
last year in another forward-start deal, paying 250 basis points
more than the euro interbank offered rate, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The company paid interest of 22.5 basis
points more than Euribor in 2007 when it increased the facility
by 2 billion euros, the data show. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point.  A Telecom Italia spokesperson, who asked not to be named
citing company policy, declined to comment.  The company is  rated  Baa2 by Moody’s Investors Service and
BBB by Standard & Poor’s and Fitch Ratings, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
