Russian ruble bonds fell as investors
speculated gains are overdone after Euroclear Bank SA announced
it will start direct settlement of the so-called OFZ notes
tomorrow. The ruble fell as oil, Russia’s main export, declined
to a two-week low.  The yield on OFZ bonds maturing July 2022 rose one basis
point to 6.77 percent by 7 p.m. after dropping as low as 6.65
percent. The ruble initially erased losses against the dollar on
the Euroclear announcement before weakening 0.4 percent to
30.0800.  Euroclear, which operates the world’s biggest bond
settlement system, will start direct settlement of Russian
ruble-denominated government debt tomorrow, opening the $100
billion market to foreign investors. Over-the-counter
transactions in OFZs will be followed by exchange-traded
operations in March, it said. Crude oil declined 1.1 percent in
New York to $95.59 per barrel.  “Some players were waiting for the decision in order to
sell the fact,”  Vladimir Kolychev , head of research at  Societe
Generale SA ’s local subsidiary Rosbank, said by e-mail.  The ruble fell 0.2 percent to 34.8446 against Bank Rossii’s
dollar-euro currency basket.  The Finance Ministry sold all 10 billion rubles of January
2028 OFZs as well as 13.6 billion rubles of the 20 billion
rubles of 5-year bonds offered at an auction today.  “It’s clear that there is no immediate inflow” of foreign
money into OFZ bonds,  Alexander Kudrin , head of fixed income
research at Sberbank CIB, said by phone. It’s “a matter of
weeks” before growth resumes, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
