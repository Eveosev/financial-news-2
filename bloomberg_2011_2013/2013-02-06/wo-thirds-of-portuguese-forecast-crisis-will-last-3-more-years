More than two thirds of Portuguese
forecast the country’s economic crisis will last another three
years, according to a study by market researcher Kantar
Worldpanel.  The survey indicated 75.9 percent of Portuguese forecast
their country’s economic situation will remain the same for
another three years compared to 58.1 percent in a poll carried
out in 2009, Kantar said in an e-mailed presentation today.  Portugal’s economy is forecast to shrink 1.9 percent in
2013 after declining an estimated 3 percent in 2012, the Bank of
Portugal said on Jan. 15.  The survey was carried out by Kantar from Nov. 20 to Dec.
17 and 4,000 valid interviews were conducted via telephone or
online. The margin of error is 1.5 percent, according to Ana
Pereira, a spokeswoman for Kantar in Portugal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
