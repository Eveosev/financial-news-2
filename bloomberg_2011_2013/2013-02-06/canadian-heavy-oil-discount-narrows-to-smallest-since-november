Canadian heavy crude strengthened to
the highest level versus U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate
since November.  Western Canada Select  strengthened by 60 cents to $28.50 a
barrel below WTI at 2:10 p.m. New York time, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Syncrude, a synthetic light oil produced
from oil-sands bitumen,  gained  75 cents to trade at a $1 a
barrel premium.  The gains put the discount for WCS at the narrow end of a
$30- to $40-a-barrel range in the past two months, where it
should stay in the near future, said  Katherine Spector , New
York-based commodities strategist at CIBC World Markets.  Oil demand from refiners may decline as plants shut for
seasonal maintenance. The spread was $42.50 a barrel on Dec. 14.  “We have quite a heavy maintenance schedule through at
least May or June for the key refineries taking Canadian
crude,” Spector said. “There’s limited upside in the short
term based on the refinery schedule we know now.”  TransCanada Corp . Chief Executive Officer Russ Girling said
approval for the section of the Keystone XL oil pipeline
crossing the U.S.-Canada border could come within “a few weeks
to a couple of months.”  If approved, the cross-border pipeline will deliver 830,000
barrels a day from Canadian oil sands and North Dakota shale
fields to U.S. Gulf Coast refineries, narrowing the gap between
WCS other WTI.  Gulf Coast  West Texas Sour’s discount to WTI widened $1 to $6.25 a
barrel. WTI in Midland strengthened 10 cents to a $1.90 discount
to the same crude in Cushing.  Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium narrowed 5 cents to $20.20
a barrel, and Heavy Louisiana Sweet slipped the same amount to
$20.30 a barrel over WTI.  Poseidon oil’s premium to WTI shrank 30 cents to $14.55.
Mars Blend slipped 35 cents to $14.30 a barrel over WTI and
Southern Green Canyon’s premium narrowed 5 cents to $14.40.  The premium for Thunder Horse, a sour crude with lower
sulfur content than Mars, Poseidon and Southern Green Canyon,
narrowed 35 cents to $17.65 above WTI.  To contact the reporter on this story:
