Deutsche Bank AG said it may be too
early for the U.S. Department of Agriculture to lower its
estimate of corn used to make ethanol.  Corn for ethanol consumption is still in line with the
USDA’s forecast even after capacity was idled in the past three
weeks, Deutsche Bank said in a report e-mailed today. “Based on
our calculations, industry ethanol margins have moved slightly
above break-even as reduced capacity has allowed ethanol prices
to increase at a faster pace than corn,” it said. “However,
capacity will likely stay off line until margins firm to a
greater and more sustainable degree.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
