Trading in iron ore tripled last
month from a year earlier on speculation of increased demand
this month after China holidays, The Steel Index said.  Swaps and options trading in iron ore across all exchanges
and clearinghouses was 19.63 million tons, near the record of
20.3 million tons in September 2012 and up 215 percent from 6.24
million tons a year earlier, The Steel Index, which publishes
iron ore prices, said in an e-mailed report today. Prices of ore
with 62 percent iron ore content delivered to the Chinese port
of Tianjin climbed 5.3 percent in January.  Volatility increased in the second half of January as
“some traders cut short positions, further boosting
liquidity,” The Steel Index said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
