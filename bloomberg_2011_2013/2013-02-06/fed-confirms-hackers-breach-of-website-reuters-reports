A Federal Reserve website was
breached by hackers though no critical functions were
compromised, according to a report from Reuters.  “The Federal Reserve system is aware that information was
obtained by exploiting a temporary vulnerability in a website
vendor product,” Reuters quoted a Fed spokeswoman as saying.
“Exposure was fixed shortly after discovery and is no longer an
issue. This incident did not affect critical operations of the
Federal Reserve system,” the unnamed spokeswoman said.  Lisa Oliva, a spokeswoman for the Federal Reserve Bank of
Richmond didn’t immediately respond to an e-mail and phone call
placed after business hours in the U.S. The Richmond Fed runs
the system’s information-technology office.  The intrusion comes less than three months after U.S.
lawmakers failed to advance legislation aimed at safeguarding
computer networks considered vital to U.S. economic and national
security.  In October, President  Barack Obama  signed a separate
cybersecurity directive authorizing the National Security Agency
and other military units to take more aggressive action to
defeat attacks on government and private computer systems.  Many of the largest U.S. banks including Bank of America
Corp. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. were targeted by hackers in a
series of so-called denial-of-service attacks last year that
flooded the banks’ websites with traffic and caused disruptions
for online customers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
