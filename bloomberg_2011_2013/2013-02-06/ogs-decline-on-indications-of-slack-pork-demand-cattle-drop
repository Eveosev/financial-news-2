Hogs prices fell to the lowest in
almost four weeks on signs of slack U.S. pork demand. Cattle
futures also declined.  Wholesale pork  prices yesterday plunged 1.9 percent, the
most since Dec. 14, U.S. Department of Agriculture data show.
Tyson Foods Inc. said on Feb. 1 that pork sales fell 2.2 percent
in the quarter that ended on Dec. 29 from the same period a year
earlier.  “My concern is that it comes back to the demand side of
the equation here,”  Chad Henderson , the president of Prime
Agriculture Consulting Inc., said in a telephone interview from
Brookfield, Wisconsin. “That’s going to be the biggest question
mark for everyone, as demand for the product may slow.”  Hog futures for April settlement fell 1.2 percent to 86.65
cents a pound at 12:07 p.m. on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
Earlier, the price touched 86.25 cents, the lowest for the most-
active contract since Jan. 10.  Cattle futures for April delivery declined 0.6 percent to
$1.3155 a pound in Chicago. Earlier, the price touched $1.3135,
the lowest since Jan. 25.  Feeder-cattle futures for March settlement slid 0.5 percent
to $1.4775 a pound. A close at that price would be the fourth
straight decline, the longest slump since Jan. 17.  To contact the reporter on this story:
