Several Damascus suburbs came under
“very fierce” Syrian government shelling today, the opposition
Damascus Media Office said on its Facebook page.  Syrian President  Bashar al-Assad ’s troops closed all roads
leading to Abasiyeen Square in the capital as the sound of
explosions shook the area, the group said.  The state-run SANA news agency said government forces
inflicted casualties on “armed terrorist gangs” in several
areas of the capital, destroying their “dens” and arms depots.  At least 11 people have died so far today in the suburbs of
Damascus, the opposition Syrian Observatory for Human Rights
said on its Facebook page.  In Tadmur, the ancient city of Palmyra, a suicide bomber
blew up his car at a military intelligence complex, causing
casulaties, the Observatory said.  International and regional efforts have failed to end
almost two years of bloodshed in Syria. At least 60,000 people
have been killed since the anti-Assad uprising began March 2011,
according to estimates by the United Nations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
