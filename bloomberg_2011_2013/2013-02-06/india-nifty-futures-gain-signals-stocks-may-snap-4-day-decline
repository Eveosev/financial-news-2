India’s  benchmark stock index fell
for a fifth day, led by lenders and industrial companies.  The BSE India  Sensitive Index , or Sensex, lost 0.2 percent
to 19,627.95, according to preliminary closing prices.  ICICI
Bank Ltd ., the third-biggest lender by assets, dropped to the
lowest since Dec. 31.  Larsen & Toubro Ltd ., India’s biggest
engineering company, retreated to near a five-month low.  The Sensex has climbed 1.1 percent in 2013, after a 26
percent rally last year, as foreign funds bought shares amid
government efforts to reduce subsidies, allow higher foreign
investment in retailing and aviation, and hasten infrastructure
projects in a bid to revive  economic growth .  Overseas funds have bought a net $4.74 billion of domestic
shares this year, a record for the period, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. They  bought  a net $24.5 billion last year, the
most among 10 Asian markets tracked by Bloomberg, excluding
China, helping the Sensex to its biggest  annual gain  since 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
