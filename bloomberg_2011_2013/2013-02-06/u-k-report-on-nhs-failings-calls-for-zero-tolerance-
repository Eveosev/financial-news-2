A lawyer who conducted an independent
inquiry into why regulators and managers did not act on severe
failures at a U.K. state-run National Health Service hospital
called for a “zero tolerance” approach to poor care standards.  The public inquiry was the fifth probe into the operation
of Stafford Hospital in central England, between 2005 and 2008,
when hundreds of patients died from lack of care. Details of
neglect previously published included patients being forced to
drink from flower vases because they were denied water and
crying out for pain relief.  The chairman of the inquiry, Robert Francis, made 290
recommendations for health-care regulators, providers and the
government in his  report , published in London today, which
attacked local health authorities and the trust overseeing the
hospital. He did not attribute blame to any one individual or
organization.  Two previous reports found between 400 and 1,200 more
people died than would have been expected at Stafford between
2005 and 2008, amid “appalling” standards of care. The
inquiries criticized cost-cutting and a culture of target-
chasing at the Mid-Staffordshire Trust, the body that ran the
hospital.  Prime Minister  David Cameron  is due to make a statement to
lawmakers on Francis’s findings at 12.30 p.m. in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
