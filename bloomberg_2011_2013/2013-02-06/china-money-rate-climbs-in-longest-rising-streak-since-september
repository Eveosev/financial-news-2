China’s overnight money-market rate
climbed for a seventh day, the longest winning streak in four
months, as demand for cash increased before the weeklong Lunar
New Year holiday that begins Feb. 11.  The People’s Bank of China today gauged appetite for an
offering of 14-day reverse-repurchase agreements tomorrow,
according to a trader at a primary dealer required to bid at the
auctions. The monetary authority added a record 450 billion yuan
($72 billion) into the financial system yesterday to ensure
funds are enough to meet the holiday demand.  “Liquidity is tight but not as tight as last year,” said
 Pin Ru Tan , a Hong Kong-based strategist at HSBC Securities Asia
Ltd. “Money-market rates should be under control.”  The one-day repurchase  rate , a gauge of interbank funding
availability, rose 37 basis points, or 0.37 percentage point, to
3.63 percent in Shanghai, according to a weighted average
compiled by the National Interbank Funding Center. The rate
touched 3.66 percent earlier, the highest level since Jan. 9.  The one-year interest-rate swap contract, the fixed cost
needed to receive the floating seven-day repo rate, was little
changed at 3.17 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
