Honda Motor Co. , Japan’s third-
biggest carmaker, will build a new factory in Thailand after its
2012 vehicle sales reached a record in the Southeast Asian
country.  The Tokyo-based carmaker will invest about 44.6 billion yen
($476 million) to open a factory with an annual production
capacity of 120,000 units, it said in a  statement  today. Honda
plans to begin operations at the plant in 2015 and build models
such as the Civic compact and Accord sedan.  Honda’s move to add capacity in Thailand comes as the
automaker sold a record 171,208 units in the country last year,
after recovering from the record flooding in the country that
disrupted production in 2011.  Honda rose 3.3 percent, its biggest gain in more than a
month, to close at 3,580 yen today. The  benchmark  Nikkei 225
Stock Average added 3.8 percent and closed at its highest level
since September 2008.  Separately,  Suzuki Motor Corp.  said today it plans to begin
production of vehicles in Myanmar in May, after getting
permission from the nation to form a subsidiary in the country.  -- Editors: Aaron Clark, Chua Kong Ho  To contact the reporter on this story:
