Kobe Bryant  scored 21 points and had
eight rebounds as the shorthanded Los Angeles Lakers defeated
the Brooklyn Nets 92-83 in the National Basketball Association.  The Lakers (23-26) are third in the Western Conference’s
five-team Pacific Division, 10 1/2 games behind the Los Angeles
Clippers, after winning six of their past seven games.  Steve Nash  had 17 points and  Pau Gasol  scored 15 before
leaving the game at Barclays Center in Brooklyn four minutes
from the end. Gasol was diagnosed with a ligament strain in his
foot and will have a scan today in Boston.  The Lakers limited the Nets to 35 percent shooting even
though they were missing former NBA defensive players of the
year  Dwight Howard  and  Metta World Peace . Howard has missed
three games with a torn labrum in his right shoulder joint.
World Peace was suspended last night for punching a player in a
game three days ago in Detroit.  Brook Lopez had 30 points and 11 rebounds, and  Deron Williams  added 15 points, for the Nets (28-20), who are second
in the Eastern Conference’s five-team Atlantic Division, four
games behind the New York Knicks (31-15).  To contact the reporter on this story:
