Banco Espirito Santo SA  fell to the
lowest level in almost a month after its 2012 earnings were
below analysts’ estimates and Portugal’s biggest publicly traded
lender said it’s considering an acquisition in Spain.  Espirito Santo declined 3.7 percent to close at 99.7 euros
cents in Lisbon, the lowest since Jan. 8, giving the bank a
market value of 4 billion euros ($5.4 billion).  The bank yesterday posted a full-year 2012 net income of 96
million euros, compared with a loss of 108.8 million euros in
the previous year. Espirito Santo is studying an offer for Banco
Gallego SA in Spain, Chief Executive Officer  Ricardo Salgado 
said at a news conference in Lisbon yesterday.  Carlos Peixoto , an analyst at Oporto, Portugal-based Banco
BPI, said Espirito Santo’s results were “weaker than expected”
mostly because of lower net interest income, the difference
between what a bank makes on loans and pays for deposits, and
higher provisioning.  “The drop today is related to the bank’s results, which
were lower than some analysts had expected,” said  Pedro Oliveira , a trader at Go Bulling in Lisbon.  A downgrade by New York-based JPMorgan Chase & Co. is also
hurting the shares, Oliveira said. Lisbon-based Espirito Santo
was cut to neutral from overweight today at JPMorgan, whose 22-
month target price for the stock is 1.03 euros a share.  To contact the reporter on this story:
