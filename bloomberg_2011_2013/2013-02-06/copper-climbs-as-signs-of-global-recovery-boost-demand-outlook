Copper rose to near a four-month high
as signs of a recovery from China to the U.S., the world’s
biggest consumers of the metal, strengthen the outlook for
demand for industrial metals. Aluminum also advanced.  Copper for three-month delivery gained as much as 0.6
percent to $8,322 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange and
was at $8,308.75 at 11:28 a.m. in Seoul. The price touched
$8,346 on Feb. 4, the highest level since Oct. 5. Futures for
delivery in May rose 0.4 percent to 59,990 yuan ($9,625) a ton
on the Shanghai Futures Exchange.  China’s services industries expanded at the fastest pace in
four months in January, adding to signs that growth will
accelerate for a second quarter after an almost-two-year
slowdown. A manufacturing purchasing managers’ index released
Feb. 1 showed a fourth month of expansion. In the U.S., home
prices climbed the most in six years in November and service
industries sustained gain in January.  “U.S. home prices have increased and then China’s
manufacturing showed an improvement,” Park Jong Beom, a senior
trader at Seoul-based Tong Yang Securities Inc., said by phone
today. “Copper is rising along with other commodities, being
supported by those improving macro indicators.”  Copper, used in wires and pipes, has gained 4.8 percent
this year, and the Standard & Poor’s GSCI gauge of 24
commodities advanced 4.8 percent. China’s economy expanded 7.9
percent in the final three months of 2012 from a year earlier,
reversing a seven-quarter deceleration. The nation consumes 42
percent of the world’s copper, Barclays Plc estimates.  The metal for delivery in March increased 0.2 percent to
$3.7765 a pound on the Comex in New York. On the LME, nickel,
lead and tin were little changed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
