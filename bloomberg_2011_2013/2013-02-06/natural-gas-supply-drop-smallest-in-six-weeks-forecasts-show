week by the smallest amount in six weeks as mild weather in the
eastern U.S. reduced heating demand, analyst forecasts compiled
by Bloomberg show.  Inventories  fell 125 billion cubic feet to 2.677 trillion
cubic feet in the week ended Feb. 1, based on the median of 19
estimates. A withdrawal of that size would be the least since
Dec. 21, according to the Energy Department’s Energy Information
Administration, which is scheduled to release its weekly supply
report at 10:30 a.m. tomorrow in Washington.  The five-year average change for the period of is a decline
of 165 billion. Supplies the same week last year slid by 94
billion cubic feet. Stockpile estimates ranged from decreases of
120 billion to 151 billion cubic feet.  “Sendouts have dropped with moderating weather in the
Northeast” from storage,  Laurent Key , a natural gas analyst
with Societe Generale in New York, said in a note to clients
yesterday. “Fundamentals should lead to a range-bound market.”  Natural gas futures last week fell 14.3 cents, or 4.2
percent, to $3.301 per million British thermal units on the New
York Mercantile Exchange. March contracts today rose 0.6 percent
to $3.418. Prices are up 34 percent from a year ago.  Warmer Weather  Temperatures were above normal from most of the central
States to the East Coast last week, said MDA Weather Services in
Gaithersburg, Maryland.  Gas deliveries  to customers slid 8.8
percent to average 80.26 billion cubic feet a day for the same
period covered by the EIA report, compared with the previous
week, according to LCI Energy Insight, an analysis and
consulting firm in El Paso, Texas.  Storage withdrawals since end of October totaled 1.128
billion cubic feet from the end of October through Jan. 25, 16
percent below the five-year average for the period, Jose Villar,
an EIA analyst, said in an e-mail yesterday.  Gas inventories in the week ended Jan. 25 were 12.2 percent
