Colombia’s inflation rate excluding
food prices fell to its lowest level since at least 1999 in
January, the central bank said.  Inflation without food costs eased to 2.12 percent, while
the two other measures of so-called “core inflation” tracked
by the central bank slowed below 3 percent, according to data
published today on the central bank’s  website .  Colombia’s peso bond yields fell to a record low today as
traders increased bets on interest-rate cuts, after a report
yesterday showed consumer prices  rising  at their slowest pace in
almost three years in January. Banco de la Republica cited the
reduced inflation risk and below-potential economic growth in
its decision last month to cut borrowing costs for the fifth
time since June.  To contact the reporters on this story:
