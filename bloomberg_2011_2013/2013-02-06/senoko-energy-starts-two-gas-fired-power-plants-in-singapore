(Corrects fuel use in final paragraph.)  Senoko Energy, Singapore’s largest
power company, started up two natural gas-fired electric-
generation plants today in an attempt to lower carbon emissions.  The combined-cycle turbines will add 862 megawatts of
capacity and cut 1 million tons of carbon emissions annually,
the company said in a statement. Senoko spent S$1 billion ($808
million) converting three oil-fired plants with 750 megawatts of
output to the gas systems, according to the release.  Senoko will use liquefied natural gas from Singapore’s
Jurong Island receiving terminal for power generation when the
facility starts operations in the second quarter this year.  “We anticipate that LNG will eventually form about 20% of
our power generation,” Eveline How, a company spokeswoman, said
in an e-mailed statement.  Singapore currently uses piped natural gas from Malaysia
and Indonesia to generate 80 percent of its power, with fuel
oil, solid waste and solar energy providing the remaining 20
percent, according to the country’s energy regulator, the Energy
Market Authority.  To contact the reporter on this story:
