Union National Bank PJSC  declined the
most in more than three years after the lender, whose
shareholders include the Abu Dhabi and Dubai governments, cut
its full-year  cash dividend  by 33 percent.  The shares slumped 8.5 percent, the largest decrease since
December 2009, to 3.35 dirhams at the close in Abu Dhabi. About
3.7 million shares were traded, more than four times the three-
month daily average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The stock was the  biggest decliner  on the benchmark ADX General
Index, which fell 0.1 percent.  Union National, which today reported a 6 percent increase
in 2012  profit  to 1.6 billion dirhams ($436 million), lowered
its recommended cash dividend to 10 fils, from 15 fils last
year, in addition to offering 5 percent bonus shares. The lower
dividend comes after  Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank PJSC  boosted its
cash payout to 25 percent from 20 percent.  “We are still scratching our head on why UNB hasn’t
increased its dividend per share” given the company’s full-year
earnings growth,  Jaap Meijer , a director at Arqaam Capital Ltd.,
said in an e-mailed note today. “A hike in dividend per share
would have been a great catalyst to get the shares closer to the
fair value” of 4.7 dirhams, said Meijer, who has a buy rating
on the stock.  Union National has a 12-month dividend yield of 4.48
percent, compared with 4.2 percent for the  ADX Banks Index.  Its
shares jumped 24 percent in January, the biggest monthly gain
since September 2009, outpacing an advance of 9.5 percent for
the Abu Dhabi gauge.  Funding is at a “very comfortable level” as a 6 percent
increase in assets was driven by excess cash from higher deposit
growth, according to Meijer. Union National’s  capital adequacy
ratio,  which measures the financial strength of a bank, rose to
23.2 percent from 21.9 percent, it said today.  Seven analysts  have a buy rating on Union National, while
three recommend holding the shares, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
