TMX Group Ltd. , the owner of the
Toronto Stock Exchange, said fourth-quarter profit was C$32.8
million ($32.9 million), beating analysts’ estimates, on higher
revenue from acquisitions.  TMX Group had net income of 61 cents a share, the Toronto-
based company said today in a statement. Revenue rose 12 percent
to C$181.1 million. The numbers from a year ago aren’t strictly
comparable because a new company was formed after the sale of
the exchange owner to a group of banks and pension funds last
year.  The company benefited from an increase in revenue from its
trading, clearing and depository business, after adding
contributions from the Canadian Depository for Securities Ltd.
clearinghouse and Alpha Group. The businesses were acquired as
part of TMX’s C$3.73 billion takeover in September.  TMX said it had profit of 95 cents a share excluding some
items, beating the 73 cents a share average  estimate  of eight
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Trading on TMX’s equity markets, including the Toronto
Stock Exchange, TSX Venture and Alpha, fell 21 percent in the
quarter from a year earlier, according to company statistics.  Financings on the Toronto Stock Exchange and TSX Venture
jumped 32 percent to C$14.8 billion, as companies including
retailer Hudson’s Bay Co. and Vancouver miner Ivanplats Ltd.
completed initial public offerings in the period.  TMX  rose  3.1 percent to C$55.48 yesterday in Toronto. The
stock has gained 9.4 percent this year, nearly four times the
increase for the Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite  Index .  (TMX Group will hold a conference call at 8 a.m. to discuss
quarterly results at +1-888-231-8191 or +1-647-427-7450 or on
