Nikon Corp.  said camera price
declines that prompted it to cut its annual profit forecast will
probably continue this quarter amid slowing demand in Europe and
weaker than expected sales in China.  “Tough competition for entry-level single-lens-reflex
models has led to a large price decline since around mid-
November,”  Junichi Itoh , chief financial officer of the
Japanese manufacturer of cameras and chipmaking equipment, told
reporters in Tokyo today. “Demand in Europe is starting to
slow,” while business in China was “worse than expected” the
past quarter, he said.  Nikon and rivals including Canon Inc., the world’s largest
camera maker, are relying more on digital single-lens reflex and
so-called mirrorless cameras for growth as more consumers use
smartphones for snapshots, undermining demand for lower-end
digital cameras.  Nikon net income will probably be 38 billion yen ($405
million) for the year ending March 31, about 37 percent less
than the previous forecast for 60 billion yen, the company said
today in a statement. The projection compared with the 61
billion yen  average  of 20 analyst estimates compiled by
Bloomberg.  Nikon also cut its second-half dividend estimate to 12 yen
per share, down from 22 yen.  Canon last month forecast profit will rise 14 percent in
2013, helped by a weaker yen and rising sales of its more
expensive models.  To contact the reporters on this story:
