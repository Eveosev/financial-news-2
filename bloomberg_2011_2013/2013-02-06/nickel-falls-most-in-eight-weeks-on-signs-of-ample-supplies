Nickel prices fell the most in three
months amid signs that global supplies will be more than enough
to meet demand this year. Copper also dropped.  This week, nickel  inventories  reached the highest in almost
three years. Supplies will probably outpace consumption through
2014, analysts at Macquarie Group Ltd. said in a report last
month. China’s imports of the metal, used to make stainless
steel, will probably fall for a second year in 2013, the bank
said. Prices have climbed 7.4 this year, the most among six
major industrial metals.  “On the demand side, there’s nothing supporting the prices
we’ve seen,”  Nicholas Snowdon , an analyst at Barclays Plc in
New York, said in a telephone interview. “Some correction is
justified. The stainless-steel sector remains very quiet.”  Nickel for delivery in three months on the London Metal
Exchange declined 2 percent to settle at $18,325 a metric ton at
5:50 p.m. local time, the biggest decline since Oct. 22.  Inventories  monitored by the LME have climbed 7.7 percent
this year. Stockpiles reached 150,906 tons on Feb. 4, the
highest since April 2010.  Zinc, aluminum, tin, copper and lead also dropped in
London.  In New York, copper futures for March delivery fell 0.8
percent to close at $3.7405 a pound on the Comex.  To contact the reporters on this story:
