Take-Two Interactive Software Inc. ,
publisher of the “Grand Theft Auto” video games, rose the most
in almost five years after third-quarter results beat analysts’
estimates on sales of its latest basketball title.  Take-Two jumped 14 percent to $14.44 at the close in New
York, the biggest rise since Feb. 25, 2008, after the company
reported adjusted sales increased 71 percent to $405 million.
Analysts had projected $363.8 million on average, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Excluding some items, profit of 67
cents a share beat the 55-cent average estimate of 17 analysts,
New York-based Take-Two said in a statement yesterday.  Take-Two, which on Jan. 31 delayed the next version of its
best-selling “Grand Theft Auto,” cited sales of the shooter
game “Borderlands 2” and of “NBA 2K13,” which benefited
after  Electronic Arts Inc.  canceled a rival basketball title.
The publisher has shipped more than 15 million copies of “NBA
2K” in three releases. The latest version received its highest
overall rating ever, according to the statement.  “Our focus on quality really matters over time,” Chief
Executive Officer  Strauss Zelnick  said in an interview. “If you
give people what they want, they will come out for it.”  Revenue from digitally delivered content more than tripled
from a year earlier and accounted for 23 percent of net revenue,
driven by “Grand Theft Auto,” “Borderlands” and “NBA
2K13.” The first “Grand Theft Auto” game in five years will
start selling on Sept. 17.  Net Income  Third-quarter net income rose to $71.4 million, or 66 cents
a share, compared with $14.1 million, or 16 cents, a year
earlier, the company said. Net revenue rose 76 percent to $415.8
million.  For the fiscal year ending March 31, Take-Two forecasts
profit of 5 cents to 20 cents a share, excluding some items,
compared to the 14-cent average of 15 analysts. Its forecast for
sales of $1.15 billion to $1.20 billion compared with the
average estimate of 1.18 billion.  The company said yesterday it authorized a plan to
repurchase up to 7.5 million shares.  To contact the reporter on this story:
