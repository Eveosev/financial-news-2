U.S. nuclear-power production fell as
 PPL Corp.  reduced output at a reactor in Pennsylvania.  Nationwide generation  declined 0.2 percent to 93,101
megawatts, or 91 percent of capacity, erasing yesterday’s gain,
according to U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission data compiled by
Bloomberg. Output was 1.8 percent higher than  a year ago , with
eight of 104 reactors offline.  PPL’s 1,140-megawatt  Susquehanna 2  operated at 85 percent
of capacity, from 99 percent yesterday. The unit was slowed for
scheduled maintenance and is returning to full power, Joe
Scopelliti, a company spokesman based in Berwick,
Pennsylvania,said in an e-mail. The two-reactor plant is about
70 miles (112 kilometers) northeast of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.  The 685-megawatt  Pilgrim 1  reactor, 38 miles southeast of
Boston, slowed to 80 percent output from 87 percent yesterday.
The unit cut output Feb. 3 so technicians could reseat a pilot
valve, Carol Wightman, an Entergy Corp. spokeswoman based at the
plant, said in an e-mail yesterday.  Reactor maintenance shutdowns, usually undertaken in the
U.S. spring or fall when energy use is at its lowest, may
increase consumption of natural gas and coal to generate
electricity. The average refueling down time was 46 days in
2012, according to the Nuclear Energy Institute.  To contact the reporter on this story:
