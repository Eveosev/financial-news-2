MorphoSys AG , a German biotechnology
company, rose to the highest  since  March 2001 on speculation
that its  shareholder   Novartis AG  may make a bid for the company.  The shares  advanced  as much as 5.4 percent to 34.70 euros,
and were up 4.4 percent at 9:12 a.m. in electronic trading. That
extended the stock’s gain in the past 12 months to 77 percent.
Volume traded was 57 percent of the three month daily average,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  MorphoSys is becoming more attractive as a takeover target
due to management changes at Novartis,  Elmar Kraus , an analyst
at  DZ Bank  said in a note to clients today. Novartis’ incoming
chairman,  Joerg Reinhardt , was a member of MorphoSys’
supervisory board until 2004 and played a decisive role in
establishing corporate strategy, Kraus said.  “We see significantly increased chances of a takeover by
Novartis,” Kraus said. MorphoSys is now worth 40 euros a share,
according to the analyst.  Claudia Gutjahr-Loeser , a spokeswoman for MorphoSys,
declined to comment.  In November MorphoSys said it will expand an alliance with
Novartis, using new technologies to boost the discovery of
medicines with the Swiss drugmaker.  To contact the reporter on this story:
