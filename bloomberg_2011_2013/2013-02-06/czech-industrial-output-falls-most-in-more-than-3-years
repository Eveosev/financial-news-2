Czech industrial output fell at the
fastest pace in more than three years in December, curbed by
fewer working days, as the central bank decides whether to ease
monetary policy.  Production  decreased 12.5 percent from a year earlier,
compared with a 3.9 percent decline in November, the Czech
Statistics Office in Prague said in a statement on its website
today. The result was worse than the median forecast for an 11
percent drop in a Bloomberg  survey  of 11 analysts. Output fell
5.8 percent from a year earlier when adjusted for the impact of
working days, the statistics office said.  The central bank will probably leave the  benchmark  interest
rate at effectively zero at a meeting today as policy makers
discuss whether the countryâ€™s economic  recession  warrants more
monetary easing through koruna sales.  To contact the reporter on this story:
