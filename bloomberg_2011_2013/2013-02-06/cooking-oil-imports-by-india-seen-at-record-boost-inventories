India, the world’s largest cooking
oil consumer after China, probably imported a record quantity
last month as traders and refiners rushed to buy before a tax
increase, boosting domestic stockpiles to an all-time high. Palm
oil futures rose in Malaysia.  Purchases surged 74 percent to 1.15 million metric tons in
January from 659,979 tons a year earlier, according to the
median of estimates from five processors and brokers compiled by
Bloomberg.  Imports  of crude and refined palm oils jumped 76
percent to 900,000 tons, the survey showed. The  Solvent
Extractors’ Association of India  will publish data next week.  India, the world’s biggest palm oil buyer, imposed a 2.5
percent tax on overseas purchases of unprocessed cooking oils in
January and almost doubled the taxable value of imports to
shield domestic oilseed growers from cheap overseas supplies.
The taxes were announced after the extractors’ association
demanded steps to curb supplies for months and Malaysia set a
zero tax on crude palm oil exports from the start of the year.  “Imports were higher in anticipation of an increase in
import tax,” said  Sandeep Bajoria , chief executive officer of
Mumbai-based broker Sunvin Group. “Malaysia is also
aggressively marketing its palm oil by lowering export taxes.”  Malaysia, the second-largest palm oil producer, set the
export tariff at zero in January and extended it to February to
clear stockpiles, which were at a record 2.63 million tons in
December. Zero-duty exports may be allowed in March if prices
remain below the threshold of 2,250 ringgit ($727) a ton, said
Plantation Industries & Commodities Minister Bernard Dompok.  Malaysian Inventories  Futures have rallied 15 percent from a three-year low of
2,217 ringgit on Dec. 13 on speculation the Malaysian tax cut
will spur demand among importers and trim record inventories.
The contract for delivery in April climbed as much as 0.8
percent to 2,567 ringgit a ton on the Malaysia Derivatives
Exchange and closed at 2,551 ringgit.  Imports of all cooking oils may surge to a record 11.5
million tons in the year that started Nov. 1,  Vijay Data ,
president of the extractors’ association, said on Feb. 4.
Purchases jumped to an all-time high of 10.2 million tons last
year, according to data from the association.  Indian inventories, including those at ports and in the
pipeline, may rise to a record of 1.7 million tons as of Feb. 1,
a level last seen in May 2012, Bajoria said. India buys palm oil
from Indonesia and Malaysia, and soybean oil from Brazil and
Argentina.  “Imports will continue to be on the higher end in February
as local supplies are not adequate due to lower crushing of
soybeans,” said  Govindlal G. Patel , managing partner at GG
Patel & Nikhil Research Co. “February vegetable oil imports may
be 900,000 tons.”  Crude soybean oil  imports probably jumped to 110,000 tons
in January from 47,150 tons a year earlier, while sunflower oil
purchases may have risen to 120,000 tons from 89,500 tons, the
survey showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
