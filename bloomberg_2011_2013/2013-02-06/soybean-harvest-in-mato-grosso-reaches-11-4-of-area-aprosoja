The soybean harvest in Mato Grosso
state, the most important oilseed growing area in Brazil,
reached 11.4 percent of the planted area, the soybean growers
association of the state, known as Aprosoja, said.  Rain in the first months of the year is delaying the
harvest and causing losses in production, Aprosoja said in an e-
mailed report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
