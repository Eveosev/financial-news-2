The British government may need to
increase taxes after the next election or risk culling more than
a million public-sector jobs by 2018, a research group
said in a report today.  The Institute for Fiscal Studies said current spending
plans imply an average cut of one third in unprotected
government departments. If the squeeze on the wage bill
continues after the 2015 election, the total number of jobs lost
could reach 1.2 million by the 2017-2018 fiscal year, compared
with the Office for Budget Responsibility’s current forecast of
900,000. There is also more than a 50 percent chance that the
government will have to increase borrowing this year, it said.  Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne ’s deficit-
cutting plan has been attacked by the opposition Labour Party
for sapping economic growth as the U.K. teeters on the brink of
its first ever triple-dip recession. Osborne, who said in
December that austerity will continue until 2018, three years
later than planned when the Conservative-led government came to
power in 2010, will present his new budget to Parliament on
March 20.  “The effect of concentrating all those cuts on currently
unprotected areas of public services look hard to contemplate,”
the London-based group said in its “Green Budget” report
“Taxes could rise, hitherto protected elements of public
spending, like the National Health Service and pensions, could
be hit, or the date at which we reach fiscal balance will be
pushed further out.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
