Coffee futures slumped to the lowest
price in more than two years on signs that supply will outweigh
demand due to a bumper crop in Brazil, the world’s largest
grower and exporter.  In the year that started Oct. 1, world production is
estimated at 144.5 million bags, a 7.3 percent increase from a
year earlier,  according to  the London-based International Coffee
Organization. Brazil’s 2013 output may reach 50.2 million bags,
even as trees enter the lower-yielding half of a two-year cycle,
compared to the 2012 record of 50.8 million, the country’s
Agriculture Ministry said.  “This Brazil crop is going to be a monster,”  Joe Scaduto ,
a coffee broker at New York-based JPS Commodities LLC, said in a
telephone interview.  Arabica-coffee for March delivery tumbled 1.4 percent to
close at $1.421 a pound at 2 p.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in New
York, the lowest settlement for a most-active contract since
June 2010. Prices have fallen 35 percent from a year ago.  Production last month was up 64 percent from a year earlier
in Colombia, the second-largest grower of arabica beans,
President Juan Manuel Santos said today in a speech to growers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
