The supervisory board of HSH Nordbank
AG, the world’s largest shipping bank, has approved increasing
its guarantees as the lender strives to improve its core capital
ratio.  The guarantee facility will be raised to 10 billion euros
($13.5 billion) from 7 billion euros, the company said in a
statement today. HSH Nordbank expects a loss for fiscal 2013 and
a return to a profit in 2014, the bank said.  “By replenishing the guarantee, our core capital ratio
will be sustainably strengthened,’ ’HSH Chief Executive Officer
 Constantin von Oesterreich  said in the statement. ‘‘This will
allow the bank to meet the requirements of rating agencies and
investors.”  Hamburg and Schleswig-Holstein, which control more than 80
percent of HSH Nordbank, provided the German lender with 3
billion euros in capital and 10 billion euros in guarantees to
cover potential losses during the global financial crisis. The
lender has since repaid some of the guarantees it received from
the two states, which in October signaled they are willing to
bring the guarantees back up to the original 10 billion euros to
help the lender.  To contact the reporter on this story:
