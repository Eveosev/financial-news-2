Husky Energy Inc. , the Canadian oil
company controlled by Asia’s richest man,  Li Ka-Shing , reported
fourth-quarter profit and sales that missed analysts’ estimates
on lower-than-expected refining margins.  Excluding hedging contracts and stock-based compensation,
per-share profit was 50 Canadian cents, less than average of 12
estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Net income increased 16 percent
to C$474 million ($475.2 million), or 48 cents a share, from
C$408 million, or 42 cents, a year earlier, the Calgary-based
company said in a statement today. Revenue rose 3.6 percent to
C$5.67 billion, missing estimates.  “We expect Husky to trade in line with the broader energy
group this morning given a mixed quarter,” said  Greg Pardy , an
analyst at RBC Capital in Toronto. “Weak downstream and
operating netbacks were offset by higher production volumes and
lower cash taxes.”  The downstream unit, which refines and processes crude,
missed Pardy’s expected profit margins by 40 percent as
operating costs were higher than expected, he said in a note to
clients today. Revenue from the company’s upgrading unit, which
processes oil-sands output into synthetic crude, fell 8.6
percent to C$562 million.  Production rose 12 percent to the equivalent of 319,300
barrels a day as Husky started two heavy-oil thermal projects,
according to the statement.  Husky is 70 percent owned by Li, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. The company fell 1.5 percent to C$30.91 at 10:41
a.m. in Toronto. The shares have one buy, 16 hold and three sell
recommendations from analysts and have risen 5.1 percent this
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
