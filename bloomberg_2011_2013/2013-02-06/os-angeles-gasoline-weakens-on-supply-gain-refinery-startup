Spot gasoline in Los Angeles fell
against futures for the first time in three days after supplies
of the fuel on the U.S. West Coast rose and as  Tesoro Corp. ’s
Wilmington refinery was said to be preparing units for restart.  Motor-gasoline  stockpiles  on the West Coast, known as the
PADD 5 region, increased for the first time in three weeks,
adding 240,000 barrels to 35.2 million in the seven days ended
Feb. 1, the Energy Information Administration, an Energy
Department division, said today.  Tesoro’s 97,000-barrel-a-day  Wilmington  refinery in
Southern California was nearing the end of a maintenance
turnaround on units, including a fluid catalytic cracker and an
alkylation unit, two people with knowledge of the work said
today. Equipment was expected to begin restarting in about two
days, one of the people said.  The premium for California-blend gasoline, or Carbob, in
 Los Angeles  narrowed 4.5 cents to 29 cents a gallon versus
futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange at 3:52 p.m.
East Coast time, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Prompt
delivery in Los Angeles fell 4.27 cents to $3.3297 a gallon.  Carbob in  San Francisco  strengthened 1 cent to a premium of
11 cents a gallon against futures, the highest since Oct. 15.
Prompt delivery there rose 1.23 cents to $3.1497 a gallon.  Tesoro’s 170,000-barrel-a-day  Golden Eagle  refinery shut a
hydrocracker, which converts heavy hydrocarbons into lighter
fuels such as high-octane gasoline, over the weekend for about
three weeks of repairs, a person with direct knowledge of the
work said Feb. 4.  Company Comment  Tina Barbee , a spokeswoman at Tesoro’s headquarters in San
Antonio, said by e-mail today that both the Wilmington and
Golden Eagle refineries are performing maintenance. She declined
to specify the units involved.  San Francisco Carbob  strengthened  5.5 cents to a discount
of 18 cents a gallon against the fuel in Los Angeles, the
narrowest spread since Jan. 23. The gap grew to a record 32.5
cents a gallon on Jan. 14.  California-blend, or CARB, diesel in  Los Angeles  gained 2
cents to a 10-cent-a-gallon premium to Nymex heating oil
futures. The same fuel in  San Francisco  weakened 1 cent to a
premium of 12.5 cents a gallon.  In  Portland , low-sulfur diesel was unchanged at 6.5 cents a
gallon above heating oil futures.  Conventional , 84-octane
gasoline was also unchanged at a premium of 2 cents a gallon to
gasoline futures.  Portland 84-octane gasoline  strengthened  4.5 cents to 27
cents a gallon under Los Angeles Carbob. The spread reached a
record 75.5 cents a gallon on Oct. 4.  The  3-2-1 refinery crack spread  between Alaskan North Slope
crude, Carbob in Los Angeles and CARB diesel in Los Angeles,
narrowed 97.3 cents to $28.113 a barrel at 3:56 p.m. New York
time. The crack, a measure of refining profitability, fell to a
year-low of $3.858 a barrel on Dec. 5.  To contact the reporter on this story:
