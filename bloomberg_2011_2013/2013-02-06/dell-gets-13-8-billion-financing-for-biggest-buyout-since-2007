Dell Inc ., the personal computer
maker being acquired by Silver Lake Management LLC and Chief
Executive Officer Michael Dell, is seeking $13.8 billion in
loans to support the leveraged buyout.  Bank of America Corp., Barclays Plc, Credit Suisse Group
AG, and Royal Bank of Canada are arranging the financing, which
includes a $4 billion term B portion, a $1.5 billion C slice, a
$2 billion asset-backed piece, and $3.25 billion of bridge
facilities, the company said today in a regulatory filing.
Thereâ€™s also a $1.9 billion commercial receivables portion and a
$1.1 billion revolving consumer receivables facility.  Silver Lake, the technology-focused buyout firm based in
Menlo Park, California, is buying Dell for $24.4 billion the
biggest LBO since  Energy Future Holdings Corp.  was purchased by
KKR & Co. and Texas Pacific Group in 2007.  Dell has about $8.9 billion in  outstanding borrowings ,
including $5.9 billion of bonds and $3 billion in bank debt,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Bridge facilities are short-term loans that usually mature
in one year and are often used as backstops to bond offerings or
longer-dated bank debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
