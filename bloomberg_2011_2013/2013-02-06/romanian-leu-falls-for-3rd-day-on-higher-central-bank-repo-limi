Romania’s leu weakened for a third
day, still suffering from the central bank’s decision to raise a
cap on the size of its weekly repurchase agreement auctions
earlier this week.  The leu headed for its longest stretch of losses since Jan.
23 as the Bucharest-based Banca Nationala a Romaniei lifted the
limit on Feb. 4 as demand from commercial banks hit a record
high. It gained 1.3 percent this year on increased appetite for
government debt, which is eligible for entry in JPMorgan Chase &
Co. and Barclays Plc’s emerging-market bond indexes from March.  “The increase in leu liquidity has pushed the leu
marginally down as expected,” OTP Bank Romania SA economists
including Mihaela Neagu wrote in a note to clients today.  The leu weakened less than 0.1 percent to 4.3847 per euro
by 12:49 p.m. in Bucharest.  The central bank increased the auction limit to 10 billion
lei ($3.1 billion), from 9 billion lei a week earlier as demand
for the currency reached 38.5 billion lei.  Romania’s Finance Ministry raised 500 million lei in one-
year bills and 737 million lei in three-year bonds on Feb. 4.
The leu strengthened as much as 0.3 percent on the day, before
closing less than 0.1 percent weaker at 4.3726 per euro.  The decline in leu today is “despite the fact that we have
seen a marginal appreciation against the euro around the auction
date for government securities on Monday,” Neagu wrote in the
OTP note.  To contact the reporter on this story:
