  National Australia Bank Ltd. , the
worst performing stock among the country’s four major lenders in
2012, said first-quarter profit 3.6 climbed percent as it
expanded business lending margins and cut bad debts.  Unaudited cash earnings, which exclude some one-time costs,
rose to A$1.45 billion ($1.5 billion) for the three months ended
Dec. 31, the Melbourne-based bank said in a statement today.
That compares with A$1.4 billion cash profit reported a year
earlier. Unaudited net profit was about A$1.26 billion, the bank
said.  Chief Executive Officer  Cameron Clyne  is trying to revive
earnings growth after provisions at the bank’s U.K. unit led to
the first decline in annual profit since 2009 last fiscal year.
While Australia’s  fourth-biggest lender  by market value is
increasing its share of the home loan market, central bank
figures show mortgage demand is the weakest in four decades.  “We see fewer near-term risks for NAB and the potential
for positive responses to announcements on either asset sales or
expense initiatives,”  Citigroup  Inc. analysts led by  Craig Williams  said in a note on Jan.31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
