Colombia, South America’s largest
supplier of coal, suspended  Drummond Co. ’s loading license at
the port of Santa Marta after the company spilled coal in the
Caribbean last month.  Environmental licensing agency ANLA imposed the
“preventive measure” against Drummond’s Colombian unit after
the Jan. 13 spill, director Luz Helena Sarmiento said. Drummond
barge workers dumped about 870 metric tons into the water to
avoid sinking in heavy seas, according to the agency’s  ruling .  The suspension will last “until they update their
contingency plan,” Sarmiento said today in a telephone
interview from Santa Marta.  The move comes as workers at another Colombian coal
producer, the Cerrejon mine owned by  BHP Billiton Plc ,  Xstrata
Plc  and  Anglo American Plc , plan to strike this month. Drummond
didn’t immediately return a phone call requesting comment.  “International marine protocols emphasize saving human
lives first,” the company said in a Jan. 31 statement. Workers
’’proceeded to extract from the barge water that had mixed with
coal,’’ Drummond said.  The Birmingham, Alabama-based company has coal reserves for
more than two billion tons, of which about 90 percent is in
Colombia. Drummond shipped about 29 million tons of coal in
2011, according to the company’s website.  To contact the reporters on this story:
