Slovenia and Croatia may need more
meetings to find a solution to a decades-old bank dispute after
foreign ministers from both nations hold talks today, Foreign
Minister  Karl Erjavec  said in an interview on TV Slovenija.  Probably one or two more meetings will be needed to resolve
the issue after today’s talks with Croatian Foreign Minister
 Vesna Pusic  in Otocec, Slovenia, so that Slovenian lawmakers can
approve its neighbor’s European Union entry next month, Erjavec
told the public broadcaster late yesterday.  Slovenia wants Croatia to withdraw lawsuits at Croatian
courts over the savings of Nova Ljubljanska Banka d.d.’s
predecessor, he said.  The minister, whose party abandoned the government of Prime
Minister  Janez Jansa  yesterday, said he will step down Feb. 22.
A possible early vote in Slovenia, which plunged into a
political crisis over corruption allegations against Jansa,
could delay Croatia’s EU entry planned for July.  To contact the reporter on this story:
