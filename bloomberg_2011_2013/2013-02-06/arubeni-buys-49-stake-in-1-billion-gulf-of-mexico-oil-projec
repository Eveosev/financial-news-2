Marubeni Corp . bought a 49 percent
stake from  Williams Partners LP  in an oil and gas platform
project in the Gulf of Mexico that will cost $1 billion as it
seeks to participate in North America’s expanding energy output.  Japan’s biggest grain-trading company is investing in a
processing platform with a unit of Tulsa, Oklahoma-based
Williams Partners, it said in a statement today. The facility
will start operating in the first quarter of 2014. The two
companies also plan to partner in petrochemical projects, which
would use shale gas extracted in North America, according to the
statement, which didn’t give a value for the transaction.  The floating platform, which is part of the Tubular Bells
Field being developed by  Hess Corp . and  Chevron Corp ., will
process 60,000 barrels of oil and 135 million cubic feet of gas
a day.  Energy contributed almost 20 percent of Marubeni’s 47.1
billion yen ($502 million) profit in the three months ending
Dec. 31. The Tokyo-based trader will focus on industries related
to energy extraction, power utilities, and transportation to tap
the boom in U.S. shale oil and gas production, Chief Executive
Officer  Teruo Asada  said in December.  To contact the reporter on this story:
