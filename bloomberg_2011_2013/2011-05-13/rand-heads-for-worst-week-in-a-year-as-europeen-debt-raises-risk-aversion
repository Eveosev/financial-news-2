The rand headed for its worst weekly
decline in a year against the dollar as importers bought foreign
currency on concern the rand will weaken as  Europe ’s debt crisis
worsens, and as the central bank increased dollar purchases.  The rand depreciated as much as 1.3 percent to 6.9956 per
dollar, its weakest level since March 21. The South African
currency traded 1.2 percent down at 6.9913 at 3:26 p.m. in
Johannesburg, bringing its weekly decline to 4 percent, the
biggest since the five days through May 21, 2010. The rand is
worst performer against the dollar this week among more than 20
emerging-market currencies monitored by Bloomberg. The currency
slipped 1.2 percent to 9.9499 per euro for a weekly decline of
3.6 percent.  “There’s a bit of importer panic here; they don’t want to
be caught short before the weekend,” Ion de Vleeschauwer, chief
foreign-exchange dealer at Bidvest Bank in Johannesburg, said by
phone. “The central bank has also been quite active mopping up
dollars. They probably see the rand as relatively strong at
these levels.”  Euro-region finance ministers will meet next week to
discuss more support for  Greece , Luxembourg’s  Jean-Claude
Juncker , said yesterday. Eighty-five percent of international
investors surveyed by Bloomberg said Greece probably will
default, with a majority predicting the same fate for  Portugal 
and Ireland, which followed Greece in seeking European Union-led
bailouts.  Market Apprehension  The nation has already been granted a 110 billion-euro
($156 billion) bailout, while Ireland and Portugal have also
received financial aid from the European Union. Emerging-market
equity fund inflows slowed in the week ended May 11 as investors
turned more risk-averse amid a decline in commodity prices,
Citigroup Inc. said.  “Global markets remain exceptionally nervous, with
commodities swinging wildly and the dollar gaining as a safe-
haven play,”  John Cairns  and Nema Ramkhelawan, currency
strategists at Rand Merchant Bank in Johannesburg, said in a
research note.  The rand extended its decline when it breached a so-called
resistance level at 6.95 per dollar, the currency’s 200-day
moving average. Resistance and support levels are areas where
buy or sell orders, called stop-loss orders, are clustered.  “We saw some stop-losses triggered at 6.95 rand,” De
Vleeschauwer said. The currency could weaken to 7.10 per dollar,
he added.  Bonds fell as the rand weakened, eroding returns for
foreign investors. The 13.5 percent notes due 2015 dropped 34
cents to 120.94 rand, driving the yield eight basis points, or
0.08 percentage point, higher to 7.70 percent, the strongest on
a closing basis since April 18. The 6.75 percent securities due
2021 slipped 52 cents to 88.52 rand, boosting the yield nine
basis points to 8.49 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
