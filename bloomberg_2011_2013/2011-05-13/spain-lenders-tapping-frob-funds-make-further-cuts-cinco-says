Spanish savings banks groups that
plan to tap additional money from the governmentâ€™s bank rescue
fund, known as FROB, are working on new cost-cutting plans that
are more stringent than those originally presented to the Bank
of  Spain , Cinco Dias reported.  The regulator has told Novacaixagalicia, CatalunyaCaixa,
Unnim and  Caja de Ahorros del Mediterraneo (CAM)  that they should make
an extra effort to cut their workforces, branch networks and
salaries, the newspaper said, without saying where it got the
information.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
