HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA)  raised 143.4
billion yen ($1.8 billion) from the biggest sale of Samurai
bonds without a government guarantee since Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc. collapsed and the first since the earthquake.  HSBC’s unit  HSBC Bank  Plc sold 108.2 billion yen of five-
year, 0.91 percent bonds priced to yield 31 basis points more
than the yen swap rate, and 35.2 billion yen of floating-rate
notes that pay 46 basis points over the three-month London
interbank offered rate, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The bank had planned to sell at least 50 billion yen of notes,
according to a person familiar with the matter, who asked not to
be identified because the information is private.  “The deal confirmed Japanese investors’ expectation that
Samurai borrowers would return to the market,” Ryosuke Kaneko,
a credit analyst for Mizuho Securities Co., said in a telephone
interview from  Tokyo  today. “Although the demand for Samurai
bonds is strong, the pipeline doesn’t look clear yet.”  The offering is the first Samurai sale since a record 9-
magnitude earthquake and tsunami in March left more than 24,000
people dead or missing, causing radiation leaks in Tokyo
Electric Power Co.’s nuclear power plant in Fukushima, 138 miles
(220 kilometers) north of Tokyo. The market slammed shut as
overseas borrowers canceled meetings with Japanese investors and
delayed bond sales in the wake of the disaster.  Lehman Default  Lehman defaulted on 195 billion yen of Samurai bonds when
it filed for bankruptcy in September 2008, a collapse that froze
global credit markets and curbed investor demand for all but the
safest government debt. Today’s sale is the biggest without a
sovereign guarantee since Citigroup Inc. sold 186.5 billion yen
of three-year, 2.66 percent Samurai bonds to individual
investors in June 2008, Bloomberg data show.  HSBC paid a 40 basis-point spread when it sold five-year,
1.01 percent notes in September.  BNP Paribas (BNP)  SA paid 30 basis
points more than benchmark rates on its 47.8 billion yen of 1.06
percent notes on March 1, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Both HSBC Bank and BNP Paribas are ranked at Aa2 by
Moody’s Investors Service, the third-highest investment grade
rating.  Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities Co. helped HSBC
Securities  Japan  Ltd. sell the bonds. Samurai bonds are yen-
denominated debt sold by overseas borrowers in Japan. A basis
point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
