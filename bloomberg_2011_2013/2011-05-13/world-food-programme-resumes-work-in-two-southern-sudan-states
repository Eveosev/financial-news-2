The  World Food Programme  said it will
resume food aid to about 240,000 people in the Southern  Sudan 
states of Lakes and Jonglei, a month after government troops
confiscated a food shipment to Lakes and a WFP driver was killed
in Jonglei.  WFP took the decision after receiving assurances that the
army would no longer commandeer food or vehicles, the head of
WFPâ€™s office in the south, Leo Van der Velden, said in a
statement released yesterday.  The south is scheduled to become independent from the north
of the country on July 9. Preparations for independence have
been overshadowed by violence, with more than 1,000 people
killed in clashes in the south this year, according to the
 United Nations .  Rome-based WFP plans to provide food assistance to 1.5
million Southern Sudanese this year out of a population of about
8 million.  To contact the reporters on this story:
