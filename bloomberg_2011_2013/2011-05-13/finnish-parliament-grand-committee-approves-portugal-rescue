The Finnish parliament’s Grand
Committee agreed to approve  Portugal ’s bailout, after a vote in
Helsinki today.  The approval is conditional on Portugal negotiating with
private creditors to maintain their positions in the country and
also requires that Portugal ensure repayment of its debt to
other European Union countries by selling state assets, the
committee said.  “We won’t participate unless there are guarantees,” said
Erkki Tuomioja, the chairman of the committee. “It would be
good for everyone.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
