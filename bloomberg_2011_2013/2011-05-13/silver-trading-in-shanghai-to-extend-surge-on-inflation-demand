Silver trading in  Shanghai , which
jumped 65 percent in terms of volume last month, will continue
to increase on demand for a safe-haven investment, even as the
government moves to curb volatility and speculation.  “Chinese investors have piled into silver as one of the
investment choices to hedge against rising inflation,” Shi
Heqing, silver analyst at Beijing Antaike Information
Development Co., said today. The government’s move to increase
margins in an effort to curb volatility won’t affect buying
interest in physical material, Shi said.  Volume on the Shanghai Gold Exchange rose to 33,293 metric
tons in April, up from 20,206 tons the previous month, according
to  data from the exchange , the main bourse in  China  for trading
silver. The central bank raised  reserve requirements  a day after
reports showed inflation and lending exceeded economists’
estimates in April, with consumer prices rising more than 5
percent.  “China’s physical demand for silver may remain high as
industrial use from the electronics and solar energy sectors and
demand for silver coins and bars will rise,” Shi said. China
turned to a net importer of silver in 2010, a situation that has
not changed this year, according to Antaike.  Prices in Shanghai have tumbled about 30 percent this month
after the exchange adjusted daily trading limits and margins
four times in the past week to control speculation. Last week,
silver futures in  New York  plunged the most since at least 1983
after the Comex exchange boosted margin costs by 84 percent. On
April 25, the metal reached $49.845, the highest since the Hunt
Brothers tried to corner the market in 1980.  Individual Investors  Most of the silver trading in Shanghai is conducted by
individual investors, while institutions remained the most
active investors in gold and platinum trading, according to the
exchange’s data.  Silver for immediate delivery slipped as much as 8.1
percent yesterday to $32.3125 an ounce, the lowest level since
Feb. 25. It dropped 1.2 percent to $34.3225 at 1:00 p.m.
Singapore time. The Shanghai contract dropped 0.2 percent to
7,646 yuan a kilogram.  The Shanghai exchange widened the trading band for silver
contracts to 13 percent from 10 percent today and also raised
the margin requirement to 19 percent from 18 percent.  --Feiwen Rong. Editors:  Richard Dobson , Jake Lloyd-Smith  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
