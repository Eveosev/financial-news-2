Ghana’s  total exports increased 62
percent to $3 billion in the first quarter of 2011, boosted by
shipments of oil from its nascent  energy industry , Bank of Ghana
Governor Kwesi Amissah-Arthur said.  Oil exports were worth $484.2 million, he told reporters in
Accra, the capital, today.  Ghana, the world’s biggest cocoa grower, started production
of oil for export late last year. Daily output from the Jubilee
oil field currently stands at 70,000 barrels, according to
 Tullow Oil Plc. (TLW)   Earnings from cocoa in the first three months rose 26
percent to $859.4 million, while gold shipments reached $1.2
billion in the three months to March, from $787 million,
Amissah-Arthur said. Ghana is Africa’s second biggest gold
producer, after  South Africa .  Higher exports helped cut the West African nation’s current
account deficit to $220.2 million in the first quarter, compared
with $565.8 million a year earlier, he said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
