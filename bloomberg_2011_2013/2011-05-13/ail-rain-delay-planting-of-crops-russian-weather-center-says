Hail and rainfall delayed crop sowing
in some parts of  Russia ’s Stavropol, Krasnodar and Astrakhan
regions in May’s first 10 days, the Federal Hydrometeorological
Center said.  Planting conditions will be “satisfactory” for the
month’s second 10 days, the center said on its  website . Rainfall
exceeded the norm by two to three times in North Ossetia-Alania,
Dagestan and Kalmykia as well as Stavropol, Krasnodar and
Astrakhan, it said.  Sowing conditions outside of the so-called Black Earth
region in central Russia were favorable for only 20 percent to
30 percent of the month’s first 10 days, according to the
center. Within the region, conditions were favorable for 50
percent to 70 percent of the period, it said.  Heavy rainfall in the North Caucasus Federal District,
which includes the Stavropol region, would promote growth of
local grains, Roman Vilfand, the center’s chief, said yesterday.
Russian weather conditions and forecasts indicated a favorable
crop outlook, and delays in spring grain sowing were “not
critical or dangerous,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
