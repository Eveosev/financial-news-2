Canada ’s dollar fell to a six-week
low after North American equities fell, reducing demand for
higher-yielding assets.  The loonie dropped for second straight week for the first
time since January as crude oil fluctuated today after sliding
last week the most since December 2008. The Canadian dollar rose
against the euro, erasing losses on speculation  Greece  will need
to restructure its debt.  “The market seems to be going through this broader risk-
off stage, and the Canadian dollar is a victim,” said  Shane Enright , executive director at Canadian Imperial Bank of
Commerce’s CIBC World Markets unit in Toronto. “There’s
certainly the perception out there that commodities may have got
ahead of themselves.”  The loonie, as Canada’s currency is also known, depreciated
0.6 percent to 96.86 cents versus the  U.S. dollar  at 5 p.m. in
Toronto, the weakest on a closing basis since March 31, from
96.27 cents yesterday. One Canadian dollar buys $1.0324.  The Canadian dollar had a weekly drop of 0.2 percent after
falling 2.2 percent last week, the most since July. It touched
94.46 cents on April 29, the strongest since November 2007.  Government bonds  rose today, pushing 10-year yields down
four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 3.19 percent.
The price of the 3.25 percent security maturing in June 2021
increased 32 cents to C$100.48.  Drop in Crude Oil  Crude oil for June delivery in  New York  rose 0.4 percent
to $99.36 a barrel after earlier dropping as much as 1.9
percent. Futures gained 2.3 percent this week after tumbling 15
percent last week.  Raw materials  including crude account for
about half of Canada’s export revenue.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index decreased 0.8 percent,
erasing its weekly gain. The S&P/TSX Composite Index dropped 0.1
percent.  The Canadian currency appreciated 0.3 percent to C$1.3676
against the euro after touching C$1.3633 yesterday, the
strongest level since April 1.  The German government supports an extension of maturities
on Greek bonds because of the worsening deficit situation in
Greece, Die Welt reported, without saying where it got the
information.  Germany  is waiting for the conclusions of a European and
International Monetary Fund mission to Greece before making any
decision on whether further steps may need to be taken to help
the first victim of the debt crisis, a German government
spokesman said.  “There’s been a great deal of rhetorical turmoil in the
euro,” said Joseph Trevisani, chief market analyst at FX
Solutions Inc. in Saddle River,  New Jersey . “And it’s not just
rhetorical, it’s real.”  To contact the reporter for this story:
