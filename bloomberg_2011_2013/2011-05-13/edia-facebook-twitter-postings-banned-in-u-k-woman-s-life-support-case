A U.K. judge overseeing a mother’s
request to take her daughter off life-support barred media from
naming the patient on Facebook Inc. or Twitter Inc., four days
after such postings targeted celebrities in unrelated cases.  Although so-called reporting restrictions are common in
Britain, the May 12 order from a London court specified the
U.S.-based social-networking websites for the first time instead
of using general language about Internet postings. The case
involves a woman who suffered  brain damage  in 2003, and attempts
by U.K. journalists to cover the story.  A Twitter user posted messages on May 8 claiming a number
of British celebrities had won “super-injunctions” blocking
publications of information about their personal lives, and gave
details of the activities the user said the celebrities were
wanted to keep private. Media lawyers said the postings, if left
unchallenged, could undermine the usefulness of the injunctions.  Privacy rulings have been on the rise since Formula One
President Max Mosley won a ruling in 2008 that his  privacy
rights  were violated by a story in  News Corp. (NWSA) ’s News of the
World about a Nazi-themed sex party. The flurry of rulings
brought opposition from Prime Minister  David Cameron , who said
Parliament, and not the courts, should set U.K. privacy law. One
lawmaker estimated as many as 30 of the orders have been issued,
with at least four granted within the last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
