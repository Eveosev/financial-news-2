Ghana’s  central bank cut its
benchmark interest rate for the first time in 10 months after
inflation slowed in both March and April.  The key lending rate was lowered to 13 percent from 13.5
percent,  Bank of Ghana  Governor Kwesi Amissah-Arthur told
reporters today in the capital, Accra. Only one of seven
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg had forecast the reduction.  “Threats to inflation are dwindling due to the favorable
food harvest and weak second-round effect of oil price increases
at the beginning of the year,” Amissah-Arthur said.  Inflation slowed to 9 percent in April from 9.1 percent the
month before as the effects of a 30 percent increase in gasoline
prices in January eased and the cedi stabilized. The currency,
which weakened as much as 5.7 percent in the first five weeks of
2011, is now down 1.4 percent in the year and food-price
inflation eased to 4.2 percent in April from 4.7 percent a month
earlier.  “The magnitude of the move speaks much,”  Razia Khan , head
of Africa economic research at Standard Chartered Plc in  London ,
said in an e-mailed comment. “It appears somewhat tentative, as
though the Bank of  Ghana  is testing the water, waiting to see
how inflationary pressures develop.”  The central bank lowered its benchmark interest rate four
times between November 2009 and July last year as inflation
slowed from a five-year high of 20.7 percent in June 2009.  Inflation is expected to remain about 9 percent for the
rest of the year, Amissah-Arthur said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
