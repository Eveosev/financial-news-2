Indonesia ’s rupiah rebounded from its
biggest one-day drop in almost a year on speculation the central
bank will tolerate gains to curb inflation. Benchmark bonds
declined.  Bank Indonesia  said in a statement yesterday that the
nation’s exchange-rate movements are in line with efforts to
curb inflation. Bank Indonesia’s foreign exchange reserves rose
to $113.8 billion as of April 29 from $105.7 billion at the end
of March, it said in a statement posted on its  website .  “The central bank has continuously allowed the rupiah to
strengthen to manage inflation,” said Lindawati Susanto, head
of treasury at PT Bank Resona Perdania in Jakarta. “Although
inflation has eased, the central bank still has to monitor the
situation. With more foreign reserves, it has more room to do
so.”  The rupiah gained 0.6 percent to 8,549 per dollar as of
4:46 p.m. in Jakarta, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The currency weakened 0.9 percent yesterday, the most since May
25, 2010, on renewed concern that  Europe ’s debt crisis will
worsen. It advanced 0.4 percent this week.  The central bank left its key lending rate unchanged at
6.75 percent yesterday, a decision expected by all 10 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg.  Bank Indonesia will “continue to closely watch inflation
pressures, especially those that are derived from international
commodity prices, the rise in domestic demand and government
policy related to fuel subsidies, and the possibility of
disruptions to food supplies,” it said in the statement.  Consumer prices in  Southeast Asia ’s largest economy rose
6.16 percent last month from a year earlier, slower than the
6.65 percent pace in March.  Core inflation , which excludes food
and fuel prices, accelerated to 4.62 percent from 4.45 percent.  Ten-year  government bonds  fell. The yield on the 8.25
percent note due July 2021 climbed one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 7.66 percent, according to closing prices
from the Inter-Dealer Market Association. The rate fell seven
basis points this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
