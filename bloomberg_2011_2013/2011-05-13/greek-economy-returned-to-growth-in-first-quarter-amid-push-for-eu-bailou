The  Greek economy  returned to growth
in the first quarter as calls intensify for a new European
Union-led rescue to stave off a default.  Greek gross domestic product expanded 0.8 percent from the
previous quarter, when it shrank 2.8 percent, Eurostat, the EU’s
Luxembourg-based statistics office, said in an e-mailed
statement today. The economy contracted 4.8 percent from the
first quarter of 2010.  Euro-region finance chiefs meet in Brussels on May 16 to
discuss additional support for  Greece . The yield on Greece’s 10-
year bond has more than doubled since a first bailout last year,
complicating a return to markets to cover 27 billion euros of
financing needs next year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
