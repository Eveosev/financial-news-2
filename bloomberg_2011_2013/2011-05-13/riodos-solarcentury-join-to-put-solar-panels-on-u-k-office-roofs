Triodos Bank NV and Solarcentury
Holdings Ltd. formed a partnership to put solar panels on the
roofs of U.K. offices, schools and government buildings.  The Dutch bank will own photovoltaic panels placed on
buildings by the U.K. solar company, which will install,
maintain and manage the systems for 25 years, London-based
Solarcentury said in a statement e-mailed today.  The occupants of the building will pay either nothing or a
discounted price for the panels and benefit from free
electricity. Triodos will receive feed-in tariffs, or prices
guaranteed by the government for a quarter-century for
electricity from renewable sources, Solarcentury said.  Triodos will pay for the installations for its EIS Green
Fund, according to the statement.  The size of the fund is confidential. The two companies
will focus on projects of 50 kilowatts or less, because of a
government review of the tariffs paid for electricity from
largest projects, Charlotte Webster, a spokeswoman for
Solarcentury, said in an e-mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
