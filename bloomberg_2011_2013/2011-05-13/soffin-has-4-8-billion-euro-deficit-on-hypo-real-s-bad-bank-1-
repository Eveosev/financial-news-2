Soffin,  Germany ’s financial-rescue
fund, had a deficit of 4.8 billion euros ($6.9 billion) in 2010
after setting aside money to cover potential losses at Hypo Real
Estate Holding AG’s bad bank.  Risk provisions for FMS Wertmanagement, which is winding
down some assets of bailed-out Hypo Real Estate, totaled 3.87
billion euros, Frankfurt-based Soffin said in an  e-mailed
statement  today.  The rescue fund was created during the global financial
crisis to ensure the stability of Germany’s banking system,
providing aid to struggling lenders. Hypo Real Estate, which is
fully owned by Soffin, transferred about 173 billion euros of
assets to FMS Wertmanagement last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
