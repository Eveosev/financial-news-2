Singapore Airlines Ltd. (SIA) , the world’s
second-largest carrier by market value, rose the most in a month
on the city’s stock exchange after pledging to pay S$1.20 a
share in special and final dividends.  The airline climbed 2.8 percent to S$14.66, the biggest
gain since April 13. The benchmark Straits Times Index advanced
1.1 percent.  Singapore  Air announced the dividends yesterday after
rebounding  travel demand  following the end of the global
recession helped boost annual profit fivefold. Net income in the
fourth quarter declined a worse-than-expected 38 percent because
of higher fuel costs.  “The key positive surprise is the big special and final
dividend,” Credit Suisse Group AG analyst Sam Lee said in a
research note today. “SIA’s valuation is not excessive, but we
do not see short-term company-specific catalyst after the big
cash dividend.”  Credit Suisse has an “outperform” rating and S$18.50
target price for the carrier. Its forecasts are under review
pending an analyst briefing today, Lee said.  The carrier’s 40 cent final dividend compares with 12 cents
a year earlier. The special dividend totals 80 cents. The
carrier had net cash, including investments, of S$5.6 billion
($4.5 billion) or about S$4.70 a share, as of the end of March,
Citigroup Inc. analysts led by Robert P. Kong said in a May 12
note.  Profit Jump  The airline reported net income of S$1.1 billion for the
year ended March, compared with S$216 million a year earlier.
Fourth-quarter profit fell to S$171 million, missing the S$244
million average of four analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg
in the preceding 28 days.  The airline has hedged about 20 percent of this year’s fuel
need at about $130 per barrel, Chief Executive Officer Goh Choon Phong said at a press briefing in Singapore today.  In the three months ended March, the carrier filled 75.5
percent of total available seats, down from 80 percent a year
earlier as capacity expansion outpaced demand, it said in a
statement yesterday. Passenger numbers were little changed at
4.1 million. Yield, the average price a traveler pays to fly one
kilometer, was 12.1 Singapore cents, compared with 11.1 cents a
year earlier.  Airbus A380s  The airline intends to boost capacity 6 percent in the
fiscal year started April 1. It expects to add eight Airbus SAS
A380s, while retiring five  Boeing Co. (BA)  777s and all seven of its
747-400s.  Singapore Air’s fuel bill, its biggest expense, jumped 24
percent to S$1.24 billion in the quarter ended March 31. Jet-
fuel prices averaged $121.2 per barrel in the quarter in
Singapore trading, 42 percent higher than a year earlier.  “The twin challenges of near-term weakness in load factors
and high fuel prices will adversely affect operating
performance,” Singapore Air said. “While there has been some
respite in the past week, jet-fuel prices are likely to remain
high and volatile in the near term.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
