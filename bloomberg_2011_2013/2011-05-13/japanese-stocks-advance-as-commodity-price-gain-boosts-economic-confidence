Japanese stocks advanced for a third
day this week after commodity prices rebounded, easing concerns
that global economic growth may slow.  Inpex Corp. (1605) , the nation’s largest oil explorer, rose 0.7
percent.  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  gained 0.9 percent after the Asahi
newspaper reported production at the world’s largest automaker,
cut by the March 11 earthquake, will return to normal by
September. Nissan Motor Co., a carmaker that gets about 80
percent of its revenue overseas, soared 4.7 percent after saying
full-year profit jumped.  “Investors’ intention to avoid risks is easing due to a
rising commodity market,” said Juichi Wako, a senior strategist
at Tokyo-based Nomura Holdings Inc. “Confidence about company
earnings will likely support stocks.”  The  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average rose 0.1 percent to 9,728.96
as of 9:05 a.m. in Tokyo. The broader Topix increased 0.1
percent to 850.47, with about seven shares rising for every six
that fell.  To contact the reporters on this story:
