Novellus Systems Inc. (NVLS)  options pricing
reached the most bullish level in more than two years, driven by
speculation the chip-equipment maker may attract a takeover bid
following  Applied Materials Inc. (AMAT) ’s deal for  Varian Semiconductor
Equipment Associates Inc. (VSEA)   Novellus three-month calls cost 5.7 percent less than puts
with similar maturities, according to Bloomberg data using
contracts with strike prices 10 percent higher and lower than
the current level of the stock. That’s a skew last seen in
October 2008. As recently as February, the calls cost 16 percent
less. The shares rose 0.4 percent to $37.46 today.  “People are making near-term upside bets that the stock
will trade over $40 in the next week,” said Ophir Gottlieb,
head of client services at Livevol Inc., a San Francisco-based
provider of options market analytics. “It looks like people are
getting back on the takeover bandwagon after the Varian deal.”
Bob Climo, a spokesman for Novellus, didn’t respond to an e-mail
seeking comment.  Applied Materials, the world’s biggest maker of equipment
that creates semiconductors, said May 4 that it would pay a 55
percent premium for Varian to help regain ground in a business
where it had lost market share. Novellus, which is based in  San
Jose ,  California , has climbed 21 percent since that announcement
while a gauge of technology stocks in the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index has fallen 0.6 percent during the same period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
