The forint fell to the weakest in
more than three weeks as investors’ appetite for riskier assets
waned.  The Hungarian currency depreciated 0.6 percent to 268.08
per euro by 4:38 p.m. in Budapest, the weakest level since April
19 and extending the week’s losses to 1.3 percent. The benchmark
BUX index of shares slid 0.1 percent to 23,349.76.  “Risk aversion turned up a gear, the U.S. equities market
started to fall,” Peter Karsai, a trader at Commerzbank AG said
by phone from Budapest. “The whole region is being hit, the
forint a bit more than others.”  U.S. stocks retreated, erasing an early advance, as
declines in banking and technology shares overshadowed gains in
health-care companies after analysts advised investing in that
industry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
