The level of unemployment in the U.S.
is “a crisis” that may “worsen exponentially” unless tackled
by the government, Mohamed El-Erian, chief executive officer at
Pacific Investment Management Co., wrote in a guest commentary
in German newspaper  Handelsblatt .  The U.S. must develop long-term programs to fight
unemployment, including investing in its education system and
training unemployed people for new jobs, El-Erian wrote.  Pacific Investment Management runs the world’s biggest bond
fund.
