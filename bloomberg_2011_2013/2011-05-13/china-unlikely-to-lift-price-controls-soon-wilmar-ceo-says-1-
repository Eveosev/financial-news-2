China  is unlikely to lift price
controls on food products soon because inflationary pressure
continues to accelerate, said  Wilmar International Ltd. (WIL) , the
world’s biggest palm oil processor.  “I don’t think the government will lift price controls so
soon,” Chief Executive Officer Kuok Khoon Hong said today at a
briefing with analysts in Singapore. “Beyond June I also
doubt.” Singapore-based Wilmar gets about half its revenue from
China.  The People’s Bank of China yesterday raised banks’ reserve
requirement for the fifth time this year, after reports showed
inflation and lending exceeded economists’ estimates in April,
with consumer prices rising more than 5 percent.  Kuok told reporters he expected the control to stay after
China’s inflation reports.  Wilmar reported a less-than-expected 3.7 percent drop in
first-quarter profit today. The company’s profits are being
squeezed in China, where it accounts for about half of the
retail market for cooking oil.  The nation has asked suppliers since at least November to
refrain from raising prices, making the cost of buying the raw
materials to make the oil higher than that of the end product.  To contact the reporters on this story:
