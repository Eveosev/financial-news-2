CBS and Fox head into next week’s
negotiations with advertisers enjoying a widening lead in
audience ratings over NBC and ABC, giving the two networks an
edge in securing commitments for the coming TV season.  The CHART OF THE DAY shows  CBS Corp. (CBS)  and News Corp.’s Fox
pulling away from  Comcast Corp. (CMCSA) ’s NBC and  Walt Disney Co. (DIS) ’s ABC,
based on six years of Nielsen Co. audience data measuring prime-
time viewers ages 2 and up.  Marketers will reward CBS, the most-watched U.S. network,
with ad commitments rising 9 percent to $2.72 billion, Spencer Wang, an analyst at Credit Suisse in New York, estimated in a
May 8 report. Fox, with an hour less programming each night,
will command a 10 percent gain to $2.04 billion, aided by
“American Idol.” NBC will slip 2 percent to $1.57 billion and
ABC will increase 1 percent to $2.27 billion, he wrote.  “It’s a tale of two cities,”  David Bank , an analyst at
RBC Capital in New York, said in an interview. “ABC and NBC
have ratings and operational challenges that CBS and Fox just
don’t have.”  U.S. broadcast and cable networks announce new and
returning shows next week in a preview for marketers weighing TV
ad commitments for the season that starts in September. The
current television season ends May 25.  CBS hosts 13 of the 20 most-watched prime-time shows,
excluding sports. “Idol,” the most-watched program, has led
Fox to six years of leadership in 18-to-49-year-old viewers, the
group marketers target. ABC has two shows in the top 20 and NBC
has one.  To contact the reporter on this story:
