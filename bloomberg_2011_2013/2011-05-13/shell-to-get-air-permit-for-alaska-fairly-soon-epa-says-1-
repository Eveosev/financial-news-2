Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  is close to
getting an air permit for oil exploration off the  Alaska  shore,
said  Gina McCarthy , an assistant administrator of the
Environmental Protection Agency.  Shell, which acquired leases in the Beaufort and Chukchi
seas in 2005 and 2008, is waiting for approvals from the EPA and
the  Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and
Enforcement  to start exploration. Previous permits issued by the
EPA have been appealed, McCarthy said.  “I believe that we are very close to a strong permit,”
McCarthy told the House Energy and Commerce Committee today
during a hearing in Washington. “That will allow them to have
actually three drilling operations going on in the Arctic in a
way that is protective of public health and consistent with
current law.”  Shell, based in  The Hague , plans to drill as many as five
exploratory wells a year in the Arctic next year and in 2013.
The company filed an exploration plan for the Chukchi Sea with
the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management yesterday, Kelly op de
Weegh, a company spokeswoman, said today in an e-mail. The plan
for the Beaufort was filed earlier this month.  The House committee is considering legislation proposed by
Republicans to speed the permitting process for exploration in
Alaska. The EPA opposes such a measure, arguing that it may
expose the state’s population to significant air pollution,
McCarthy said today.  -- Editors: Judy Pasternak, Steve Geimann  To contact the reporter on this story:
