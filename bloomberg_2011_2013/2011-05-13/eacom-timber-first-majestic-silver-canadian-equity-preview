Canadian stocks rose for the first
time in five days as gold producers gained amid concern that
 Europe ’s debt woes will worsen and  TMX Group Inc. (X)  received a new
takeover offer.  Goldcorp Inc. (G) , the world’s second-biggest producer of the
metal by market value, gained 2.1 percent. TMX Group Inc., the
owner of the Toronto Stock Exchange, advanced 5.5 percent after
receiving a takeover bid from a group of Canadian banks and
pension funds.  Quadra FNX Mining Ltd. (QUX) , which produces base
metals in the U.S.,  Canada  and  Chile , soared 5.8 percent after
agreeing to form a joint venture with Sumitomo Metal Mining Co.
and Sumitomo Corp.  The Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index increased 14.19
points, or 0.1 percent, to 13,391.35 at 4:00 p.m. in Toronto.  “The Toronto market had been oversold,” said David
Baskin, president of Baskin Financial Services Inc. in Toronto,
which manages about C$8 billion ($8.2 billion). “You’re seeing
a bit of a bounce back today. People got so pessimistic on all
the commodities. When the commodities-futures guys increased the
margin requirements, especially on silver, it may have caused
some spillover to the other metals.”  The S&P/TSX index fell 2.2 percent from May 9 to May 13 on
drops in oil, gold and copper and concern inflation may lead to
higher  interest rates  in  China . Only the Athens Stock Exchange
General Index has dropped more than the S&P/TSX this quarter
among developed-market stock benchmarks.  Gold producers gained today as European finance ministers,
meeting in Brussels, pushed  Greece  to do more to address its
debt before receiving more aid. The country should sell assets
“before calling for more money,” Austrian Finance Minister
Maria Fekter told reporters before the meeting.  Mining Shares  Goldcorp advanced 2.1 percent to C$47.24.  Iamgold Corp. (IMG) ,

percent to C$18.65.  Yamana Gold Inc. (YRI) , Canada’s fifth-biggest
gold producer, climbed 1.2 percent to C$11.60.  TMX rallied 5.5 percent to C$44.05 after Maple Group
Acquisition Corp., which comprises four banks and five pension
funds, bid C$48 a share in cash and stock for the exchange
owner. TMX agreed in February to a C$39-a-share all-stock bid
from London Stock Exchange Group Plc.  Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD) , the largest lender among the Maple
investors, increased 0.7 percent to C$82.27.  Royal Bank of
Canada (RY) , the country’s biggest bank, climbed 0.6 percent to
C$58.82.  Base-metal and coal producers rose as copper gained for a
third day.  Teck Resources Ltd. (TCK/B) , Canada’s largest company in the
industry, advanced 0.8 percent from a six-month low to C$45.19.  SouthGobi’s Rebound  SouthGobi Resources Ltd. (SGQ) , which mines coal in  Mongolia ,

three months ending May 13. Last week, the company forecast
higher sales prices and volumes.  First Quantum Minerals Ltd. (FM) , Canada’s second-biggest
