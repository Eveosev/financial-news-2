European Central Bank Executive Board
member Gertrude Tumpel-Gugerell said it is to be seen whether
additional measures need to be taken on  Greece .  As part of its 110 billion-euro ($157 billion) bailout
Greece lowered spending, increased taxes and agreed to sell
state-owned companies, Tumpel-Gugerell told reporters in Vienna
today. “The question is how successful Greece is in levying
taxes” and “how Greece has progressed in privatizing state-
owned companies,” she said. “If the plan hasn’t quite been
reached, then corrections have to be made, then additional
measures have to be taken.”  Tumpel-Gugerell said one can “assume” that no new plans
would be made for Greece before the results from the current
evaluation were presented.  She declined to comment on whether the next tranche of
payments to Greece may be delayed on a potential new program,
saying “there are some weeks time” before the funds were due.
“We are waiting for the results and then one will see what the
conclusions are.”  The question whether Greece will be able to refinance
itself via the markets is “part of the evaluation that
currently is under way,” she said. “I think we should wait for
the analysis.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
