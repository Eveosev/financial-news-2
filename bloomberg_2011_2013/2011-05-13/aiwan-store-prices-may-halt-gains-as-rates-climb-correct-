(Corrects prices in second paragraph.)  Taiwan ’s street-side store property
prices may fall, halting three years of gains, because of higher
interest rates and a new tax, according to the island’s biggest
real estate brokerage.  Prices of stores in Taiwan’s metropolitan areas averaged
NT$25.3 million ($883,133) each in the first four months this
year, 1.6 percent lower than the NT$25.7 million average price
last year, according to data from  Sinyi Realty Co. (9940)  The island’s
store prices rose for three consecutive years to 2010.  Taiwan’s central bank raised borrowing costs for the fourth
straight quarter in March to prevent inflation. The cabinet said
this month a new property and luxury tax will take effect from
June 1. A 15 percent levy will apply to commercial and
residential investment properties sold within a year of purchase
and 10 percent for those sold within two years, according to the
Ministry of Finance.  “Rising interest rates are curbing store prices,” Stanley Su, Taipei-based chief analyst at Sinyi Realty, said in a
telephone interview yesterday. The rental yield for these
properties averages about 2.5 percent, and the return may lose
allure as  interest rates  increase, he said.  The central bank raised the discount rate on 10-day loans
to banks by 0.125 percentage point to 1.75 percent, the monetary
authority in Taipei said March 31.  The government last month raised its 2011 inflation
forecast to 2.18 percent from 2 percent and increased the gross
domestic product growth forecast for the year to 5.04 percent
from 4.92 percent.  To contact the reporter on the story:
