The European Union said  its proposal 
to make confidential the serial numbers of carbon dioxide
permits won’t hide other information attached to United Nations
emission offsets.  “The proposed changes are related to the unit serial
numbers and do not include other information related to
Certified Emission Reductions such as the unit type, the project
identifier or information regarding the commitment period,” the
Brussels-based 27-nation bloc’s regulator said yesterday in an
e-mailed statement.  “There will be no implications for the market or reduced
transparency” in relation to the type of Clean Development
Mechanism credits that can be traded or used for compliance in
the EU emissions-trading system, according to the statement.  To contact the reporters on this story:
