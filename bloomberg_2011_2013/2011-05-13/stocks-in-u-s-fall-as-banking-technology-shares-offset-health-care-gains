U.S. stocks retreated, erasing an
early advance, as declines in banking and technology shares
overshadowed gains in health-care companies after analysts
advised investing in that industry.  Zions Bancorporation and CA Inc. led losses that sent
financial and technology companies to the biggest declines among
10 groups. UnitedHealth Group Inc. and Aetna Inc. rallied after
JPMorgan Chase & Co. upgraded the health-care industry to
“overweight.”  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index lost 0.3 percent to
1,344.49 at 10:07 a.m. in  New York . The  Dow Jones Industrial
Average  retreated 38.49 points, or 0.3 percent, to 12,657.43.  “You’re seeing liquidity drain off -- people have had a
good year so far and rather than get tagged for staying too long
at the party, they’re exiting,” said  Peter Sorrentino , a senior
portfolio manager at Huntington Asset Advisors in Cincinnati,
which manages $14.8 billion. “With all the liquidity out there
needing a home, it’s a tug of war back and forth between
inflation fear and a need to keep that money invested.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
