Seed Co. (SEEDCO)  Ltd., a Zimbabwean crop-seed
company with operations in several African nations, will boost
production more than three-fold at its Malawian unit this year,
said Alec Kasaila, its spokesman in Malawi.  The Harare-based company will invest 700 million Malawian
kwacha ($4.6 million) to build a processing plant in the
capital, Lilongwe, Kasaila said in a phone interview today.
Production will probably increase to 15,000 metric tons of seed
a year from about 4,000 tons, he said.  “The plant will be completed this year and will process
primarily hybrid-corn seed, as well as soybean seed and
groundnut seed,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
