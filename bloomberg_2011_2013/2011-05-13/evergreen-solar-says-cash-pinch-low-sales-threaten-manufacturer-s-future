Evergreen Solar Inc. (ESLR) , a maker of thin
polysilicon wafers for the solar industry, said it’s unsure
whether the manufacturer will be able to continue in business
due to liquidity concerns.  “There is substantial doubt regarding our ability to
maintain liquidity sufficient to operate our business and our
ability to continue as a going concern,” the company said in a
filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission yesterday.  The company said its survival depends on obtaining
additional financing from third parties and a successful
restructuring of at least a substantial portion of its debt.  The Marlboro, Massachusetts-based company last week warned
it may need to raise cash to continue operations after first-
quarter sales fell short of expectations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
