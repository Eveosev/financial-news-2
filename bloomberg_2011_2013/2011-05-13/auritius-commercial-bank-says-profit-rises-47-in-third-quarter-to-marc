Mauritius Commercial Bank (MCB) , the
country’s largest lender by market value, reported a 47 percent
increase in profit for the third quarter through March as loan
books grew.  Net income advanced to 1.43 billion rupees ($51 million)
from 971.3 million rupees a year earlier, it said in a  statement 
published on the Port Louis-based Stock Exchange of Mauritius’s
website today. This includes a 250 million-rupee out-of-court
settlement with  Mauritius Union Assurance Co. (MUA)  and 160 million
rupees of profit from the exit of an equity investment. Net
interest income increased to 1.47 billion rupees from 1.25
billion rupees.  “Based on current trends, MCB’s performance is on course
to return to pre-crisis levels,” the company said. “Net
results are expected to exceed the 4 billion-rupee mark for the
full year to June” after taking into account “non-recurrent
items of revenue.”  Mauritius’s central bank started capping commercial banks’
holdings of Treasury bills last month to encourage lenders to
increase loans to the public and create a secondary market. The
limit started at 20 percent of a bank’s rupee deposits, Governor
Rundheersing Bheenick said on March 29.  MCB’s profit growth was driven by a 15 percent increase in
loans in the year through March to 115.3 billion rupees, with
the ratio of deposits to loans rising to around 90 percent.  For the nine-month period, profit jumped 27 percent to 3.4
billion rupees, while net interest income increased 14 percent
to 4.4 billion rupees.  To contact the reporter on this story:
