Japan  is seeking to buy 117,000
metric tons of food wheat in a tender on May 27, the Ministry of
Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries said.  The shipment must be made by Aug. 31, Masafumi Otsuka at
the ministryâ€™s grain-trade division said by phone today.  The tenders will be held under the so-called simultaneous
buy-and-sell system, in which food makers and trading companies
jointly bid for grains of any origin and quality.  To contact the reporter on this story:
