China  State Construction Engineering
Corp., a state-owned construction and property company, rose the
most in a month after it won almost twice as many contracts in
the first four months of this year as compared with 2010.  The company rose 2.6 percent to 3.98 yuan in Shanghai
trading, the biggest one-day increase since April 15. China’s
benchmark Shanghai Composite Index increased 1 percent.  China State Construction signed 249 billion yuan ($38
billion) of construction contracts in the first four months of
this year, an 89 percent increase from a year earlier, the
Beijing-based company said in a statement after markets closed
yesterday. Investments for property development in China, the
world’s fastest growing major economy, gained 34.3 percent in
the first four months, according to government data.  The company is on pace this year to exceed the 740 billion
yuan of contracts it signed in 2010. That contrasts with an
earlier estimate China State Construction made in its 2010
annual report that it’d sign 690 billion yuan of construction
contracts in 2011, 50 billion yuan less than last year.  --Penny Peng. Editor:  John Liu   To contact Bloomberg News Staff for this story:
