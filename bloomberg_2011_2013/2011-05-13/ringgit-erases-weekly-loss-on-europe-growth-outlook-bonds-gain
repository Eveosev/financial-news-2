Malaysia’s ringgit gained, erasing
losses during the week, as some commodity prices rebounded after
growth in  Europe ’s biggest economies eased concern about global
slowdown.  The currency strengthened the most this year as raw
materials including silver recovered and  China  raised banks’
reserve-requirement yesterday for a fifth time this year.
 Germany  and France’s economies grew 1.5 percent and 1 percent
respectively last quarter. Malaysia’s 10-year bonds gained after
the central bank governor said the country’s current inflation
rate was “manageable.”  “Germany and France reports are taking away the market
concerns about the recovery outlook, which helped price
recovery,” said Lam Chee Mun, a fund manager at TA Investment
Management Bhd. in Kuala Lumpur. “I’m optimistic about the
second-half market outlook.”  The ringgit rose 0.6 percent to 3.0004 per dollar as of
4:30 p.m. in  Kuala Lumpur , to complete a 0.1 percent gain for
the week, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It reached at
13-year high of 2.9598 on May 2.  The ringgit earlier fell as much as 0.5 percent for the
week amid concern about  Greece  debt crisis. Euro-region finance
ministers will meet in Brussels on May 16 to discuss more
support for Greece beyond the 110 billion-euro ($156 billion)
rescue granted a year ago, Luxembourg’s Jean-Claude Juncker, who
leads the group, said yesterday.  Bonds Rise  The Standard & Poor’s GCSI Index tracking 24 raw materials
including oil and silver has declined 28 percent from an all-
time high on April 29.  Government reports this month showed  Malaysia ’s exports
grew 7.8 percent in March from a year earlier, slowing from a
10.5 percent gain in February. Industrial production rose 2.4
percent that month versus 5.2 percent in February.  Ten-year notes gained this week, pushing yields to the
lowest level in almost two months. March’s inflation rate of 3
percent, the highest in 23 months, is “manageable,” central
bank Governor Zeti Akhtar Aziz told reporters in Luxembourg on
May 11.  The yield on the 4.16 percent note due July 2021 fell five
basis points to 3.99 percent from a week ago, according to Bursa
Malaysia, matching the lowest rate since March 18. The price
increased 0.45, or 4.5 ringgit per 1,000 ringgit face amount, to
101.40.  To contact the reporter on this story:
