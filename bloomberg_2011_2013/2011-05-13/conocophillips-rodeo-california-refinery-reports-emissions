ConocoPhillips (COP) , the third-largest
U.S. oil company, reported flaring at its Rodeo, California,
refinery that caused a release of sulfur dioxide.  Mark Hughes , a spokesman for the Rodeo refinery, said he
believed the emissions were related to scheduled maintenance at
the plant in northern California. According to a report  filed 
with state regulators, the flaring released 500 pounds of sulfur
dioxide at 4:41 a.m.  Maintenance is now under way at the refinery, said Bill Stephens, a company spokesman. Stephens and Hughes declined to
comment further on operations at the plant.  The Rodeo refinery can process 128,000 barrels of oil a
day, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
