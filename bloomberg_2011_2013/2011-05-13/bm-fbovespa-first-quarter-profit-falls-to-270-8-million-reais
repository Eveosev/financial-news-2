BM&FBovespa SA (BVMF3) , the operator of  Latin
America ’s biggest securities exchange, said first-quarter net
income fell 4.8 percent on weak equity trading volumes and lower
fees for derivatives.  Net income excluding minority interests fell to 270.8
million reais ($167.2 million) from 284.5 million reais a year
earlier, the Sao Paulo-based company said in a regulatory
filing. Net operating revenue climbed 2.5 percent to 472.2
million reais.  Equities trading volumes posted a “weak performance,”
Banco Bradesco SA said. Investors pulled 2.55 billion reais from
Latin America’s biggest stock market in the first quarter, data
from the  Sao Paulo  exchange show.  “Cash equities volumes are the current main driver for the
stock, and we do not anticipate any major improvement in the
short term,”  Banco Bradesco SA (BBDC4) ’s analysts including Carlos
Firetti wrote in a note to clients before the earnings were
released.  In the derivatives segment, an increase in trading volumes
was offset by lower fees, as interest rates contracts, which
have lower revenue per contract, accounted for a higher portion
of transactions, Bradesco said.  BM&FBovespa’s shares have fallen 11 percent this year,
compared with a 7.7 percent drop for the benchmark Bovespa
index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
