Muenze Oesterreich AG, the Austrian
mint that makes the best-selling gold coin in  Europe , expects
silver coin production to rise by up to 36 percent in 2011,
Chief Executive Officer Gerhard Starsich said.  The mint will produce up to 15 million 1-ounce silver coins
in 2011, up from 11 million last year, Starsich said in response
to Bloomberg questions today in Vienna. The mint sold a record
903,047 of its top-selling 1-ounce Philharmonic gold coins last
year, Starsich said, without giving a forecast for the current
year.  “Silver continues to boom while gold has retreated a
little bit because of the price,” Starsich said at a tour of
the former Hapsburg palace in downtown Vienna, where the 800-
year-old company makes its coins.  The mint makes all of the country’s coins, including the
Austrian National Bank unit’s hand-polished gold Philharmonics.
It has also made precious-metal coins for countries such as
Ireland, Latvia and  Oman .  The Austrian Mint stopped making silver coins for general
circulation in February after the price of the metal doubled in
a year and exceeded the 10-euro face value. Silver for immediate
delivery extended gains in  London , rising as much as 5 percent
to $36.4650 an ounce earlier today.  Austria is experimenting with new rare-Earth metals to
forge into coins, Starsich said. The mint’s limited edition
niobium coins have sold out four times since their inception in
2003. They have a 25-euro ($35) face value and retail for 47
euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
