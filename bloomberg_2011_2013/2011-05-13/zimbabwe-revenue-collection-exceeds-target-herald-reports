Zimbabwe â€™s revenue collection
exceeded its first-quarter target by 11 percent, the state-
controlled  Herald  newspaper reported, citing Sternford Moyo,
chairman of the Zimbabwe Revenue Authority, known as Zimra.  The revenue authority collected $618.9 million against a
target of $555.2 million, the Harare-based Herald said on its
website. Value-added tax was the single largest contributor to
state revenue, raising $242.4 million, the Herald said.  Zimra collected $411.5 million in the same period last
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
