The cost of insuring against default
on European corporate and sovereign bonds fell, according to
traders of credit-default swaps.  Contracts on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 40
companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings decreased 3
basis points to 354, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. at 8:30
a.m. in  London . The Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of
swaps on 15 governments fell 2 basis points to 181, the lowest
in a month.  The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings dropped 0.75 basis point to 96,
JPMorgan prices show. The Markit iTraxx Financial Index of 25
banks and insurers fell 2 to 134 and the subordinated index was
6 lower at 225. A decline signals improvement in perceptions of
 credit quality .  Swaps on Greece fell 14 basis points to 1,244, according to
CMA. Ireland declined 7 to 635.5, Italy fell 3 to 147.5,
Portugal dropped 9.5 to 619.5 and  Spain  was 3 lower at 239.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($14.3 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
