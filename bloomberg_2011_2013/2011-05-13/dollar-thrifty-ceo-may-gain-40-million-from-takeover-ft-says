Scott Thompson, the chief executive
officer of  Dollar Thrifty Automotive Group Inc. (DTG) , a U.S. car-
rental company for which  Hertz Global Holdings Inc. (HTZ)  has offered
$72 a share in cash and stock, stands to pocket more than $40
million if an agreement is struck at that price, the Financial
Times reported, citing its own calculations.  Thompson could receive about $31 million in unvested stock
options and performance-related grants, in addition to more than
$9 million in other payments, including a gross-up, which would
cover his tax liability, the newspaper said.  Those gains would be unusually large in relation to the
size of the Hertz offer, which values Dollar Thrifty at about
$2.2 billion, the FT said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
