Corn imports by  China , the world’s
second-largest consumer, may total 2 million metric tons in the
year to June 30, the United Nations Food & Agricultural
Organization said, without giving a comparative figure.  Since June 2010, shipments have totaled “just under” 1.5
million tons, Abdolreza Abbassian, a senior economist at the FAO,
wrote in an e-mail today. The agency’s full-year estimate is 33
percent higher than a forecast from the  U.S. Department of
Agriculture  for China’s imports for the 12 months from Oct. 1.  Rising import demand from China may sustain a rally that’s
pushed corn 84 percent higher in the past year. China’s corn
imports may jump to 10 million tons this year,  Michael Coleman ,
managing director at Aisling Analytics Pte, said on May 12.  The UN agency is scheduled to release its outlook for so-
called coarse grains on June 7.  To contact the reporter on this story:
