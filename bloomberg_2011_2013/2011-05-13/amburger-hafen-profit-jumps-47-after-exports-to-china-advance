Hamburger Hafen & Logistik AG, which
handles two-thirds of containers in the Port of Hamburg, said
first-quarter profit jumped 47 percent because of growth in
European exports to  China  and increasing traffic to  Russia .  Net income rose to 16.4 million euros ($23.4 million), the
Hamburg-based company said in a statement today. Revenue climbed
22 percent to 289.8 million euros, beating the 267.6 million-
euro average estimate of 13 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Hamburg,  Europe ’s third-largest container port, handles
about 25 percent of Germany’s sea-bound exports, and  Asia 
accounts for almost 60 percent of its cargo volumes. Container
throughput destined for Asia from Europe grew 41 percent in the
first quarter, Hamburger Hafen & Logistik said today. The
company forecast growth in container volumes, earnings and sales
of “well above” 10 percent for the full year, it said.  “Container throughput at HHLA’s terminals in Hamburg
increased substantially in the first three months of 2011,
especially involving the shipping regions which had been hardest
hit by the global economic crisis,” the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
