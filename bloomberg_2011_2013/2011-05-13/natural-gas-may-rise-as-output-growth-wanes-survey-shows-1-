Natural gas futures may climb on
speculation that production growth will decline, a Bloomberg
News survey showed.  Five of 12 analysts, or 42 percent, forecast that gas
futures will advance on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  through
May 20. Four, or 33 percent, said futures will fall and three
predicted that prices will stay the same. Last week, 59 percent
of participants said  gas prices  would decline.  The Energy Department lowered its forecast for natural gas
output in 2011 by 0.1 percent and raised its outlook for prices
in its  Short-Term Energy Outlook  on May 10. Marketed gas
production will average 63.23 billion cubic feet a day in 2011,
down from 63.32 billion estimated in April, the department said,
citing a drop in drilling and a forecast of higher consumption.  “Producers obviously are not happy with the price of
natural gas at $4,” said  Jay Levine , the president of Enerjay
LLC, a Portland, Maine-based energy brokerage. “It’s not
conducive for them to produce natural gas at these cheap
prices.”  Natural gas for June delivery climbed 1.1 cents, or 0.3
percent, to $4.246 per million British thermal units this week
on the New York exchange.  Injections into gas storage have been smaller-than-average
since the week ended April 22, according to the Energy
Department.  Gas inventories rose 70 billion cubic feet in the week
ended May 6 to 1.827 trillion cubic feet, the department said
yesterday. The five-year average increase for the week is 90
billion cubic feet.  The gas survey has correctly forecast the direction of
prices 48 percent of the time since its June 2004 introduction.  Bloomberg’s survey of natural-gas analysts and traders asks
for an assessment of whether Nymex natural-gas futures will
probably rise, fall or remain neutral in the coming week. This
week’s results were:  RISE   FALL   NEUTRAL  5      4        3  To contact the reporter on this story:
