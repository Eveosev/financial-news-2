MRV Engenharia & Participacoes SA,
 Brazil ’s fifth-biggest homebuilder by revenue, advanced to the
highest price in more than three months in Sao Paulo after
reporting first-quarter profit growth.  The shares climbed 2.8 percent to 15.08 reais at the close
of Sao Paulo trading at 4:15 p.m. New York time, the highest
since Jan. 24. MRV’s competitor Brookfield Incorporacoes SA
tumbled after first-quarter earnings trailed estimates.  MRV reported first-quarter net income rose 32 percent from
a year earlier to 152.6 million reais ($93.1 million).  “The main positive of MRV results in our view is the
sequential recovery in margins,” JPMorgan Chase & Co. analysts
Adrian Huerta and Marcelo Motta wrote in a note to clients. The
company said earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization were 25.1 percent of operating revenue, 3.4
percentage points above JPMorgan’s forecast.  Brookfield tumbled 5 percent to 8.50 reais after it
reported first-quarter adjusted net income of 65.8 million
reais, trailing the average estimate of 100.5 million reais by
four analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
