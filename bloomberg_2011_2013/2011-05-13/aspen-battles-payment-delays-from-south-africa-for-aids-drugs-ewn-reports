Aspen Pharmacare Holdings Ltd. (APN)  is
working with the Gauteng Health Department to resolve delays of
several months for payments for the supply of AIDS drugs,
Eyewitness News reported.  Aspen has continued to supply antiretroviral drugs to
clinics in the province on an uniterrupted basis even without
the payment, the Johannesburg-based news service said on its
website, citing Stavros Nicolau, Aspenâ€™s senior executive in
charge of strategic trade. Gauteng includes the cities of
Johannesburg and  Pretoria .  Several clinics in the province ran out of Stocrin, which
forms part of the cocktail mix needed to treat people living
with HIV, EWN said. The health department said clinics were to
blame for not placing their orders for the drugs in time, EWN
said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
