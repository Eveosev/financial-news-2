Incoming European Central Bank
Executive Board member Peter Praet said the bank must “stay on
alert” regarding inflation and that keeping  interest rates  low
for too long encourages risk-taking, L’Echo newspaper reported,
citing an interview.  “A long period of weak rates creates distortions in the
financial system,” Belgium’s Praet, who replaces Gertrude Tumpel-Gugerell on the ECB board next month, told L’Echo. “You
see it today. The rates being low, investors look for
investments with higher returns, sometimes taking on too much
risk,” the newspaper quoted Praet as saying.  Praet said he is “neither a hawk nor a dove,” and
described  Mario Draghi , the leading candidate to succeed Jean- Claude Trichet as ECB President, as “someone who is
respected,” according to L’Echo.  “It’s wrong to say that a debt restructuring will solve
most of  Greece ’s problems,” Praet said. “The problems are
going to remain. Greece must absolutely implement structural
reforms.” Belgium showed in the 1990s that it is possible to
reduce debt “without devaluation or restructuring,” he said.  Praet said while Belgium “remains vulnerable,” as long as
its  credit rating  stays high “there’s hardly any problem,”
according to L’Echo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
