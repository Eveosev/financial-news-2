The Australian and New Zealand
dollars weakened as declines in stocks and commodities sapped
demand for higher-yielding assets.  The so-called Aussie dropped 0.3 percent to $1.0642 as of
11:11 a.m. in Sydney from $1.0678 yesterday in  New York . The New
Zealand currency fell 0.3 percent to 79.35 U.S. cents.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
