Middle East crude oils for sale to
 Asia  rose against their benchmarks as higher-than-average
processing profits drove demand from refiners.  Murban for July loading, produced in  Abu Dhabi , climbed 10
cents to a premium of 73 cents a barrel to its official selling
price, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Lower Zakum,
also produced in the emirate, advanced to the same level. Qatar
Marine gained 5 cents to a premium of 28 cents a barrel.  Middle East crudes have been supported by a surge in
refining profits for middle distillates including gasoil and
kerosene. The profit from processing Qatar Marine in a plant
capable of upgrading  fuel oil  into gasoline and diesel was at
$2.74 a barrel today, according to netback calculations by
Bloomberg and EnSys Energy. Thatâ€™s up from the six-month average
of $1.72. It reached $5.50 on May 6.  Oman oil for immediate loading rose $1.81, or 1.7 percent,
to $107.89 a barrel, according to Bloomberg data. Dubai for
loading in July increased 1.7 percent to $107.29 and Murban
crude climbed 1.7 percent to $112.71 a barrel.  The Brent-Dubai exchange for swaps for June widened 2 cents
to $6.57 a barrel, PVM data showed. The exchange for swaps for
July fell 1 cent to $6.32 a barrel.  Oman futures for July delivery rose 83 cents to $108.36 a
barrel on the  Dubai Mercantile Exchange  at 5:44 p.m. Singapore
time, with 1,147 contracts traded. The settlement price was at
$108.73 at 12:30 p.m. in Dubai.  To contact the reporter on this story:
