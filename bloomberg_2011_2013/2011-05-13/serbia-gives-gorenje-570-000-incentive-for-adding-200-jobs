Serbia  will subsidize Slovenia’s
appliance maker Gorenje Group d.d. with 400,000 euros ($570,000)
as it expands production at its Valjevo plant and adds 200 jobs.  As part of Serbia’s efforts to boost employment, the
government will give the incentive to help Gorenje start
manufacturing refrigerators and freezers at the plant in western
Serbia, Economy Minister Nebojsa Ciric said today after signing
the agreement with local Gorenje manager Mirko Meza.  Serbia has provided as much as 5.05 million euros in
incentives to Gorenje since the Slovenian company began opening
production lines in the fellow former Yugoslav republic more
than six years ago and investing more than 50 million euros
since, Serbia’s Economy Ministry said in a statement.  The Valjevo facility was Gorenje’s first production venture
in Serbia, followed by a water heater plant near Belgrade and a
2.9 million-euro assembly line for washing machines and dryers
in Zajecar in eastern Serbia, Ciric said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
