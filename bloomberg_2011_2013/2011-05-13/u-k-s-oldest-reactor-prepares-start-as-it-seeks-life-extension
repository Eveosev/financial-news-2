The U.K.’s oldest working atomic
power station is preparing to start generating for the next year
even as it faces a deadline to shut next month.  Reactor 1 at the Magnox North Ltd. Oldbury nuclear power
station near Bristol,  England , will produce 200 megawatts from
July 10 until at least May 13, 2012, according to information
submitted to National Grid Plc.  The Oldbury station started in 1967 and is set to close at
the end of June. Magnox North Ltd. is seeking approval from
regulators to extend the life of reactor 1.  “The end of June date is still the end date, pending a
decision from the regulator,” Dan Gould, a Warrington, England-
based spokesman for Magnox North said today by telephone. No
extension has been sought for the other reactor, he said earlier
this week.  The power station, owned by the U.K.’s Nuclear
Decommissioning Authority, has two reactors. Reactor 1 was
halted May 10 for planned maintenance as part of a so-called
statutory outage. Britain can get about 20 percent of its power
from atomic sources. Nuclear plants usually operate around the
clock and so changes in output influence electricity prices.  To contact the reporter on this story:
