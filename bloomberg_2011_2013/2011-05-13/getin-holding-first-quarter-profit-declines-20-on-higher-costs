Getin Holding SA (GTN) , the Polish
financial-services group controlled by billionaire Leszek Czarnecki, said first-quarter profit fell 20 percent on higher
costs and after a tax gain wasn’t repeated.  Net income dropped to 88.7 million zloty ($32.2 million)
from 110.2 million zloty a year earlier, the Wroclaw-based
company said in a statement today. That’s less than the 112.4
million-zloty mean estimate of six analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg.  Costs increased 33 percent to 269 million zloty, while
Getin didn’t repeat a one-time tax gain reported a year earlier.
Net interest income climbed 25 percent to 360.2 million zloty
and fees and provisions rose 35 percent to 152.5 million zloty.  To contact the reporter on this story:
