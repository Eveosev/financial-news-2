Health insurers selling individual
policies in  New Hampshire  won’t get all of an exemption the
state requested from medical-spending rules in the U.S. health-
care law, the government said in a  letter  to the state today.  The largest plan is a subsidiary of Indianapolis, Indiana-
based  WellPoint Inc. (WLP) , which controls 72 percent of the market in
the state, according to New Hampshire’s application. Instead of
70 percent requested by the state, New Hampshire insurers will
have to spend 72 percent of premiums on care in 2011, 75 percent
in 2012 and 80 percent in 2013 and beyond, the U.S. Department
of Health and Human Services said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
