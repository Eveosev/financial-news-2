Carbon-emission credit prices in  New
Zealand  remained little changed this week on low trading volume,
Auckland-based broker OMFinancial Ltd. said in an e-mailed
statement.  Spot carbon credits traded at NZ$20.10 ($15.94) a metric
ton, compared with NZ$20.20 last week, the broker said today.
That compares with 12.82 euros ($18.21) or NZ$22.97 for United
Nations Certified Emission Reduction credits on the ICE Futures
Europe Exchange in  London  yesterday.  Trading volume was about 250,000 tons this week compared
with about 500,000 in March as large forest owners prefer high
logging prices to selling credits, the statement said. Other
holders are waited to see the market direction after a May 31
deadline for emitters to submit credits to the government for
compliance, the statement said.  “We maintain our view that New Zealand Units appear well
supported at NZ$20,” the statement said. “New Zealand Units
continue to be the cheapest unit in the local market.”  New Zealand companies that emit  greenhouse gases  have the
option to pay a tax of NZ$25 a ton of emissions or buy local
carbon credits or UN CERs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
