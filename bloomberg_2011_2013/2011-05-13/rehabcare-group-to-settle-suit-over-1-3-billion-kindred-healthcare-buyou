RehabCare Group Inc. agreed to pay
$2.5 million to settle a lawsuit filed by investors challenging
the fairness of its planned takeover by  Kindred Healthcare Inc. (KND)   The money will be placed “into a settlement pool for the
benefit” of shareholders after a judge approves the accord,
lawyers for RehabCare and the investors said in documents filed
today in  Delaware  Chancery Court in Wilmington.  Three pension funds sued RehabCare in February claiming the
St. Louis-based company was worth more than Kindred’s bid of
about $35 a share in cash and stock. The companies said today
they received all regulatory approvals for the $1.3 billion deal
and it may be completed by the end of June.  Each RehabCare shares will be exchanged for $26 in cash and
0.471 share of Kindred, which also would assume about
$400 million in debt, the companies said Feb. 8.  RehabCare fell 10 cents to $37.17 at 2:09 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. Kindred, based in Louisville,
 Kentucky , dropped 30 cents to $23.90.  Donna Lee, a spokeswoman for RehabCare, said by phone that
she couldn’t immediately comment on the settlement.  The companies have said the combination would create the
biggest post-acute health-care services company in the U.S.,
with operations in 46 states and $6 billion in annual revenue.  The case is Plumbers & Pipefitters National Pension Fund v.
 RehabCare Group Inc. (RHB) , CA6197, Delaware Chancery Court
(Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
