Indian shares swung between gains and
losses, with the benchmark index heading for third weekly loss.
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said it’s staying “underweight” on
the nation’s equities.  Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd. (MM) , the nation’s biggest maker of
sport-utility vehicles and tractors, fell for the fifth day.
Indian stocks may continue to “fair poorly” as the nation
faces faster inflation, slower growth and higher  interest rates ,
Goldman said in a report today.  Hindalco Industries Ltd. (HNDL) , the
largest aluminum producer, advanced 2 percent, paring the weekly
drop.  The Bombay Stock Exchange Sensitive Index, or Sensex, was
little changed at 18,351.01 at 9:50 a.m. in Mumbai. The gauge
swung between gains and losses at six times, and is set for the
third straight weekly decline. The S&P CNX Nifty Index on the
National Stock Exchange was little changed at 5,488.15. Its May
futures settled at 5,482.05. The BSE 200 Index rose 0.1 percent
to 2,270.55.  Mahindra sank 1.8 percent to 677.1 rupees.  State Bank of
India (SBIN) , the biggest lender, fell 0.5 percent to 2,629.4 rupees.  The Sensex has declined 10.7 percent this year on concern
higher borrowing costs will hurt corporate earnings. Sensex
stocks trade at an average 14.6 times estimated profit, down
from 21.5 times in March 2010. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index
is valued at 11.2 times.  ‘Underweight’  Goldman Sachs said it’s staying “underweight” on the
Indian market even after its recent underperformance, analysts
led by Timothy Moe wrote in a report. They maintained their 12-
month forecast of 6,200 for the Nifty Index, saying that returns
may be delayed until “the cycle improves.”  The central bank last week boosted interest rates for the
ninth time since March 2010 to damp price gains that are the
fastest among  Asia ’s major economies. The monetary tightening
will slow growth this year and help ease inflation to 6 percent
“with an upward bias” by March 31, 2012, Governor Duvvuri Subbarao said. The economy may grow about 8 percent in the year
to March, from 8.6 percent in the previous year, he estimated.  India ’s benchmark wholesale-price inflation accelerated to
8.98 percent in March, exceeding the central bank’s 8 percent
estimate. By comparison, consumer prices rose 5.3 percent in
 China  and 4.2 percent in  South Korea .  Hindalco rose 1.8 percent to 198.7 rupees.  DLF Ltd. (DLFU) ,
India’s biggest developer, gained 1.2 percent to 230.45 rupees.  Overseas investors bought a net 1.01 billion rupees ($22.6
million) of Indian stocks on May 10, taking total investments in
equities this year to 19.5 billion rupees, according to data on
the  website  of the  Securities and Exchange Board of India .  To contact the reporter on this story:
