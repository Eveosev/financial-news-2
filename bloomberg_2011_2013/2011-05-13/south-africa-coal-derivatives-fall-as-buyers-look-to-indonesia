Coal derivatives settled against
prices at  Richards Bay , South Africa, the continent’s biggest
facility for shipping the fuel, have fallen because Asian buyers
prefer Indonesian supplies,  Barclays Capital  said.  The contracts for June have declined 3.8 percent in the
week to yesterday to $118.55 a metric ton, according to a
composite figure compiled by Bloomberg. Prices are little
changed in the last 12 months and peaked at $125.20 during the
period. That was on April 4.  “Both Chinese and Indian buyers are favoring lower-cost
Indonesian and off-spec coals,”  Sudakshina Unnikrishnan , an
analyst with Barclays in London, wrote in a note today. “With a
lack of buying for the better South African coal, prices have
fallen throughout the week.”  India’s imports of coal from  South Africa  fell 18 percent
from the month before to 1.21 million tons, mjunction Services
Ltd., a Kolkata-based trader, said on May 11. South Africa is
boosting Asian exports as the Chinese and Indian economies
expand, firing demand for power.  The coal-derivative data are drawn from information
