European Commission President  Jose Barroso  raised doubts about the legality of a Danish proposal to
restart checks on goods and merchandise at its frontiers in
order to clamp down on the smuggling of drugs and weapons.  A “first legal assessment” of  Denmark ’s plan “raises
important doubts about whether the proposed measures, if
implemented in the ‘intensive and permanent’ way that has been
announced, would be in line with Denmark’s obligations under
European and international law,” Barroso said today in a letter
to Danish Prime Minister Lars Loekke Rasmussen.  Responding to an influx of refugees from the North African
uprisings, European Union interior ministers agreed this week to
grant governments greater leeway to reintroduce passport checks
temporarily in  Europe ’s 25-nation free-travel zone.  Italy was the first port of call for at least 30,000
refugees from the revolution in  Tunisia  and war in  Libya ,
leading to inner-EU tensions when it tried to offload some of
them to other countries in Europe.  Europe will work on “better guidelines” so that “under
very clearly defined conditions there can be a possibility to
temporarily reinstall border controls,” EU Home Affairs
Commissioner Cecilia Malmstroem said.  ‘Smooth Functioning’  Denmark’s plans may punch a hole in Europe’s border-free
system. The measures “appear to put into question the smooth
functioning of Europe’s single market,” and may violate EU law
on “the free movement of goods, persons, services and capital
and the provisions of the Schengen Borders Code,” Barroso said
in the letter, which was distributed by the commission.  Lars Barfoed, Denmark’s minister of justice and deputy
prime minister, has been in talks with EU Vice President  Viviane Reding  and assured her that the plan won’t break Schengen rules,
the Ritzau news agency reported, citing Barfoed.  Barroso called on Denmark to coordinate with the commission
on the border plan and told Rasmussen that “if necessary we
will take all necessary steps to ensure the full respect of the
relevant law.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
