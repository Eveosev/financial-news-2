Ukraine’s spring grain sowing,
excluding corn, declined by 5.8 percent as of April 29 compared
with a year earlier, the country’s State Statistics Office said.  Spring plantings slid to 3.2 million hectares (7.9 million
acres), the office said in a statement on its website today,
without giving reasons. Barley accounted for 2.3 million
hectares, a 6.1 percent decrease.  Corn plantings advanced by 42 percent to 1.25 million
hectares, the office said. Sunflower sowing declined by 8.1
percent to 1.5 million hectares.  Sugar-beet planting gained by 6.9 percent to 494,300
hectares, the Kiev-based office said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
