Astarta Holding NV (AST) , a Ukrainian
agricultural company and producer of refined sugar, said first-
quarter profit rose 1 percent as revenue increased.  Net profit increased to 20.2 million euros ($28.7 million),
or 81 cents per share, from 19.9 million euros, or 80 cents a
share, a year earlier, the Kiev, Ukraine-based company said in a
 statement  on its website yesterday. Revenue rose 13 percent to
50.8 million euros.  Revenue rose after a 36 percent increase in the volume of
milk sales. Sales of refined sugar and by-products fell to 63
percent of revenue from 72 percent a year earlier, while the
share of crop sales rose to 26 percent from 19 percent after
prices climbed and volumes increased in some segments, the
company said.  The company expects favorable prices for its products
through the end of the year, Chief Executive Office Viktor
Ivanchyk said on a conference call today.  Ivanchyk added that Astarta plans to increase its market
share by selling sugar to large food companies and by sugar
trading. Sugar sales should climb to about 55,000 tons in the
second quarter from about 38,000 in the first, he also said.  First-quarter cost of revenue rose 37 percent to 27.1
million euros, mostly as a result of “lower than expected
productivity per hectare of key crops including  sugar beet  and
rising prices for inputs,” the company said in its statement.  Astarta acquired two sugar plants in the Kharkiv region in
the east of Ukraine in the first quarter, according to the
statement. The company expanded its  land bank  to 225,000
hectares (556,000 acres) and plans to increase it to 250,000
hectares by the end of the year, the company said.  Astarta shares rose 1.5 percent to 69.05 zloty in Warsaw
trading as of 4:54 p.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
