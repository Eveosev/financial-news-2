Turkish stocks slumped the most in
two months, sending the  ISE National 100 Index (XU100)  to its biggest
weekly drop since February, on concern the current-account
deficit may worsen, forcing the central bank to tighten monetary
policy. The lira weakened and bond yields rose.  The ISE 100 fell 1,949.91, or 2.9 percent, to 64,585.22 at
the 5:30 p.m. close in Istanbul, bringing its drop in the past
five days to 5.4 percent. The lira weakened 1.2 percent to
1.5960 per dollar in late trading. Yields on benchmark two-year
bonds rose 12 basis points, or 0.12 percentage point, to 8.74
percent, the highest since April 14, according to a Royal Bank
of Scotland Group Plc index.  The central bank has raised lenders’ reserve requirements
four times since December to restrain a domestic credit boom
that’s helped drive the current-account deficit to a record $9.8
billion in March, according to a central bank report on May 11.
 Oil prices  rose as much as 1.8 percent today before Turkish
markets closed. The country imports 90 percent of its oi.  “Foreign accounts are staying away from  Turkey  because
uncertainty over what the central bank will do is weighing on
banking shares,” Isik Okte, a trader at Finans Invest in
Istanbul, said in a telephone interview.  Turkiye Garanti Bankasi AS (GARAN) , the country’s largest traded
bank by market value, fell 3.5 percent.  Koc Holding AS (KCHOL) , Turkey’s
biggest group of companies, declined 4.6 percent.  Haci Omer
Sabanci Holding AS (SAHOL) , Turkey’s second-largest group of companies,
lost the most since November 2009, dropping 46 kurus, or 6
percent, to 7.16 liras.  “Actors in the market are still refraining from increasing
their risk exposure,” said Nezihi Abay, head of trading at
Global Securities in Istanbul. “Once we see what’s happening
with energy and commodity prices, then we can tell which way the
market should go.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
