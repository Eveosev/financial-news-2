Vietnam ’s benchmark five-year bonds
dropped, with yields rising the most in more than two weeks, on
speculation banks don’t have surplus cash to invest in the
securities. The dong gained.  Deposits at lenders dropped 1.09 percent as of April 21
from the previous month, the country’s central bank said in a
May 11 statement on its website.  “Commercial banks are facing a big issue in terms of
liquidity and they don’t have cash to buy  government bonds ,”
said Nguyen Duy Phong, an analyst at ACB Securities Inc. in  Ho
Chi Minh City .  Yields rose 16 basis points to 12.76 percent, the most
since April 25, according to a daily fixing from banks compiled
by Bloomberg.  The dong gained 0.1 percent today and this week to 20,570
per dollar as of 1:58 p.m. in Hanoi, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  The  State Bank  of Vietnam fixed the currency’s reference
rate at 20,688, compared with 20,693 yesterday, its website
showed. The currency is allowed to trade up to 1 percent on
either side of the rate.  --Nguyen Kieu Giang in Hanoi. Editors: Ven Ram, James Regan  To contact the Bloomberg News Staff on this story:
