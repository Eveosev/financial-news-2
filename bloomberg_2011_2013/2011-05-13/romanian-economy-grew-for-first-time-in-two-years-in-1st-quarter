Romania ’s economy expanded in the
first quarter for the first time in more than two years as
exports and industrial output offset for weak domestic demand.  Gross domestic product grew a preliminary unadjusted 1.6
percent from a year earlier, compared with a 0.6 percent decline
in the fourth quarter, and rose an adjusted 0.3 percent, the
 National Statistics Institute  in Bucharest said today in an e-
mailed statement. GDP grew 0.6 percent from the previous three
months, the second quarterly growth in a row.  Romania, which took a two-year precautionary loan from the
 International Monetary Fund  and the European Union this year,
will probably see economic output grow 1.5 percent in 2011,
exiting a two-year recession, according to government and IMF
forecasts. Growing exports and industrial production will
probably help the economy recover this year, the IMF said.  The Balkan nation had relied on a 20 billion-euro ($28
billion) international bailout loan to stay afloat from 2009
until 2011, raised taxes and cut public wages and benefits to
narrow its  budget deficit  within IMF-agreed targets amid the
global and European sovereign-debt crisis.  “The main growth driver in the first quarter was probably
industrial output, as domestic demand grew only slightly and
raises questions on how sustainable its growth is,” ING Bank
Romania SA economist Nicolaie Alexandru-Chidesciuc said by phone
before the announcement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
