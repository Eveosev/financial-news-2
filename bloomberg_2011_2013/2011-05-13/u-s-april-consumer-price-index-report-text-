Following is the text of the
April consumer prices from the Labor Department.  The Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) increased
0.4 percent in April on a seasonally adjusted basis, the  U.S. Bureau
of Labor Statistics  reported today. Over the last 12 months, the all
items index increased 3.2 percent before seasonal adjustment.  The energy index posted another increase in April as the gasoline
index continued to rise, the latter accounting for almost half of the
seasonally adjusted all items increase. The household energy index
also rose, with all of its major components posting increases. The
food index increased as well in April, though the 0.5 percent rise in
the food at home index was the smallest increase this year. Within
the food at home component, the indexes for meats, poultry, fish, and
eggs, for dairy and related products, and for nonalcoholic beverages
all posted notable increases, though the fresh vegetables index did
decline following recent advances.  The index for all items less food and energy rose 0.2 percent in
April, the third increase of that size in the last four months.
Indexes making major contributions to that increase included those
for new vehicles, used cars and trucks, medical care, and shelter.  The 12-month increases of major indexes continue to climb. The all
items index rose 3.2 percent for the 12 months ending April 2011, the
highest figure since October 2008. The energy index has now risen
19.0 percent over the last 12 months, with the gasoline index up 33.1
percent. The food index has risen 3.2 percent while the index for all
items less food and energy has increased 1.3 percent; both figures
represent increases over recent months.  Table A. Percent changes in CPI for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U): U.S. city

March. The food at home index, up 1.1 percent in March, rose 0.5
percent in April. The deceleration was mainly due to the fresh
vegetables index, which turned down in April, falling 2.7 percent
after posting large increases in each of the previous two months.
This led to the fruits and vegetables index declining 1.1 percent,
the only major grocery store food group to decline in April. In
contrast to this decline, the index for dairy and related products
rose 1.7 percent, the index for nonalcoholic beverages advanced 1.2
percent, and the index for meats, poultry, fish, and eggs increased
1.1 percent. The indexes for cereals and bakery products and for
other food at home posted smaller increases. The food at home index
has risen 3.9 percent over the last 12 months, with all major grocery
store food groups increasing over the period. The index for food away
from home rose 0.3 percent in April, the same increase as in March.  Energy  The energy index rose 2.2 percent in April. This is the tenth
increase in a row and follows advances of 3.5 percent in March and
3.4 percent in February. The gasoline index rose 3.3 percent in April
after a 5.6 percent increase in March. (Before seasonal adjustment,
gasoline prices rose 7.5 percent in April.) The index for household
energy also increased in April, rising 0.7 percent. The fuel oil
index rose 3.2 percent, continuing a strong upward trend, while the
index for electricity increased 0.2 percent. The index for natural
gas, which declined in March, rose 1.9 percent in April. The
household energy index has risen 1.9 percent over the last 12 months,
with the fuel oil index up 35.1 percent and the electricity index up
0.6 percent but the index for natural gas down 1.5 percent.  All items less food and energy  The index for all items less food and energy rose 0.2 percent in
April after increasing 0.1 percent in March. The shelter index, and
its rent and owners' equivalent rent components, all repeated their
March increases of 0.1 percent. The new vehicles index rose 0.7
percent, also a repeat of its March increase, while the index for
used cars and trucks advanced 1.2 percent in April after a 0.8
percent increase in March. The index for medical care, which rose 0.2
percent in March, advanced 0.4 percent in April. The index for
medical care commodities increased 0.5 percent while the medical care
services index rose 0.3 percent. The indexes for apparel and for
household furnishings and operations both turned up in April, each
rising 0.2 percent after declining in March. The index for recreation
was unchanged in April, as it was in March. The tobacco index
declined in April, falling 0.4 percent, its largest decline since 2007.  The index for all items less food and energy increased 1.3 percent
over the last 12 months. Indexes that have increased over that time
include airline fares (up 12.1 percent), medical care (up 2.9
percent), new vehicles (up 2.4 percent), and shelter (up 1.0
percent). Indexes that have declined included household furnishings
and operations (down 0.9 percent) and recreation (down 0.4 percent).  Not seasonally adjusted CPI measures  The Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) increased
3.2 percent over the last 12 months to an index level of 224.906
(1982-84=100). For the month, the index increased 0.6 percent prior
to seasonal adjustment.  The Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers
(CPI-W) increased 3.6 percent over the last 12 months to an index
level of 221.743 (1982-84=100). For the month, the index rose 0.8
percent prior to seasonal adjustment.  The Chained Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (C-CPI-U)
increased 2.9 percent over the last 12 months. For the month, the
index increased 0.6 percent on a not seasonally adjusted basis.
Please note that the indexes for the post-2009 period are subject to
revision.  The Consumer Price Index for May 2011 is scheduled to be released on
