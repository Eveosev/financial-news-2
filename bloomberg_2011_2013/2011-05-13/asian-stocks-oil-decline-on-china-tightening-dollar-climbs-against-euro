Asian stocks, the Australian dollar
and crude oil declined as  China ’s efforts to curb bank lending
added to concerns global economic growth will slow. The dollar
strengthened toward a six-week high versus the euro.  The MSCI Asia Pacific sank 0.8 percent as of 12:50 p.m. in
Tokyo, set for the lowest close since April 19. Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index futures slid 0.3 percent. Oil lost 0.5 percent
in New York and silver futures dropped for a third day. China’s
yuan forwards and money-market rates climbed and  Australia ’s
currency fell 0.5 percent versus the  U.S. dollar . The won slid
as  South Korea ’s central bank unexpectedly kept  interest rates 
unchanged. The dollar gained to $1.4203 per euro from $1.4246.  The People’s Bank of China lifted bank reserve requirements
for a fifth time this year, prompting analysts from Credit
Suisse Group AG to Citic Securities Co. to predict further
tightening even as economic reports this week pointed to slowing
industrial output and retail sales in the world’s second-largest
economy. Separate reports today are forecast to show  consumer
confidence  and the cost of living climbed in the U.S., while
economic growth in the euro-region accelerated.  “Investors are worried inflation may slow a recovery in
the global economy,” said  Masaru Hamasaki , who helps oversee
about $17 billion as chief strategist at Toyota Asset Management
Co. in Tokyo. “That may cause a slump in global demand,
trimming companies’ earnings outlook”  Almost two shares declined for every one that gained on
MSCI’s  Asia  Pacific Index, taking the measure’s weekly loss to
1.6 percent.  Japan ’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average tumbled 1.2
percent, South Korea’s Kospi index fell 0.8 percent, and  Hong
Kong ’s Hang Seng Index slid 0.6 percent. China’s Shanghai
Composite Index was little changed after a two-day drop.  Hana, Yamada Denki  Hana Financial Group Inc. (086790)  plunged 15 percent after South
Korea’s financial regulator delayed a decision on whether to
approve a proposed takeover of Korea Exchange Bank. Japan Steel
Works Ltd. sank 6.1 percent after it predicted a 30 percent
profit drop for the year ending March 2012. Yamada Denki Co.
jumped 9.5 percent after the electronics retailer said full-year
net income will rise to a record.  Nikon Corp. (7731)  surged 7.2 percent
after the maker of cameras, lenses and scanners posted profit
that beat analyst estimates and forecast rising demand for chip-
making equipment.  Raw-material producers paced declines among Chinese stocks
traded in Hong Kong, with PetroChina Co. sliding 1.5 percent and
Zijin Mining Group Co. falling 2.5 percent. Credit Suisse said
the central bank may need to raise interest rates, as efforts to
increase bank reserve requirements “hit a ceiling.” The
central bank may raise the ratio again by 0.5 percentage points
in June and lift interest rates by 0.25 percentage points,
according to Citic Securities.  Yuan Forwards, Swaps  The 12-month non-deliverable yuan forward strengthened 0.2
percent to 6.36, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
two-year swap rate, the fixed cost to receive the seven-day
repurchase rate, climbed 1.25 basis points to 3.6325 percent.
The seven-day repo rate added 70 basis points to 3.46 percent.  Oil for June delivery fell 0.5 percent to $98.50 a barrel
in electronic trading on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange.
Futures fell to as low as $95.25 yesterday, before settling at
$98.97, after the  International Energy Agency  cut this year’s
global oil demand estimate by 190,000 barrels a day.  July-delivery silver slipped 0.5 percent to $34.635 an
ounce, extending a two-day, 9.6 percent slump. Futures have
retreated 1.9 percent this week, following a 27 percent slump
the previous five days.  Aussie, Won  The so-called Aussie dropped to $1.0624 from $1.0678
yesterday in New York while the  New Zealand dollar  fell 0.4
percent to 79.24 U.S. cents. South Korea’s won weakened 0.6
percent to 1,091.65 per dollar after the central bank kept the
benchmark seven-day repurchase rate unchanged at 3 percent, a
decision predicted by just two of 14 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News.  The U.S. currency strengthened against 14 of its 16 most-
active counterparts. InterContinentalExchange’s Dollar Index,
which tracks the currency against those of six trading partners,
rose 0.3 percent to 75.386, set for the highest level since
April 18.  The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan preliminary
index of consumer sentiment rose to 70 in May from 69.8 in April,
according to the Bloomberg survey median ahead of a report today.
Separately, Labor Department figures may show the cost of living
index rose 0.4 percent in April after a 0.5 percent gain the
prior month, and was up 3.1 percent from April 2010, according
to the Bloomberg survey median. Core prices, which exclude
volatile food and fuel, may have climbed 0.2 percent in April
from a month earlier.  Inflation ‘Alive’  Treasuries headed for a weekly loss before today’s reports,
with 10-year securities yielding 3.21 percent, according to
Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. Yields have climbed seven basis
points this week.  “Inflation is still alive,” said Hideo Shimomura, who
helps oversee the equivalent of $74.1 billion in  Tokyo  as chief
fund investor at Mitsubishi UFJ Asset Management Co., a unit of
Japan’s biggest bank.  The cost of protecting bonds in the Asia-Pacific region
from non-payment decreased, with the Markit iTraxx Japan index
falling two basis points to 118 basis points, according to
Deutsche Bank AG. That’s the lowest level since March 22,
according to data provider CMA. Indexes for Australia and Asia,
excluding Japan, also declined.  To contact the reporters on this story:
