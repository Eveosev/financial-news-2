Li Ning  Co., China’s largest
sportswear maker, will raise prices again in the fourth quarter
to counter higher costs and inflation,  Radio Television Hong
Kong  reported today, citing the company’s chief executive.  Li Ning raised prices for third-quarter orders by 10
percent and will lift them further, Chief Executive Officer
Zhang Zhiyong said, according to the broadcaster.  Orders for the fourth quarter will likely be flat from a
year earlier, Zhang said. The report didn’t say how much prices
would rise.  Three calls to Zhang Xiaoyan, spokesman for Beijing-based
Li Ning, went unanswered.  China’s consumer prices rose 5.3 percent in April,
according to government data released May 11, exceeding
economists’ estimates and the government’s full-year target of 4
percent. Yesterday,  China ’s central bank raised banks’ reserve
requirements for the fifth time this year in an effort to
control inflation.  China last week fined Unilever, the world’s second-largest
consumer-goods maker, 2 million yuan ($308,000) for telling the
media about plans to raise prices, which the government said led
to hoarding.  To contact the reporter on this story:
