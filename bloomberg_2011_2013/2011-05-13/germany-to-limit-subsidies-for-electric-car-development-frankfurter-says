Germany  will allocate less than
1 billion euros ($1.4 billion) to back electric-car development,
much less than the  auto industry  had hoped for,  Frankfurter
Allgemeine Zeitung  said, citing people familiar with the matter.  The government will eliminate some projects from a pool of
ideas as not fit for subsidization, and limit its stake in
others to 40 percent at most, the Frankfurt-based newspaper
cited the people as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
