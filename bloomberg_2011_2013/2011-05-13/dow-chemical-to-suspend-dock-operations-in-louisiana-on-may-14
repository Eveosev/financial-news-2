Dow Chemical Co. (DOW) , the largest U.S.
chemical maker, said it will suspend dock operations at two
factory sites in Louisiana tomorrow as a precaution against
potential flooding from the swollen Mississippi River.  While the company doesn’t expect floods at its Plaquemine
and St. Charles sites, it is suspending dock work based on
water-level projections, Gregory Baldwin, a Dow spokesman, said
today in an e-mailed statement. It’s too early to say how long
the suspensions will be or whether they will affect production
and sales, he said in response to questions from Bloomberg News.  “Dow logistics professionals continue to work diligently
to minimize the impact from this situation on our customers,”
Baldwin said in the statement.  The Mississippi and Ohio rivers, swollen by heavy rain and
melted snow, have been inundating cities and towns, flooding
cropland and disrupting shipping.  Dow has three ethylene plants, known as crackers, along the
 Mississippi River  in Louisiana. South of  Baton Rouge  are
Plaquemine 2, which can produce 499,000 tons of ethylene a year,
and Plaquemine 3 which can produce 758,000 tons, according to
Bloomberg data. West of  New Orleans  at the St. Charles site in
Hahnville is Taft 1, which can make 610,000 tons of ethylene a
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
