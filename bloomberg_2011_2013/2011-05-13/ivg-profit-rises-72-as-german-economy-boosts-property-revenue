IVG Immobilien AG (IVG) , Germany’s largest
commercial-property company, said first-quarter profit rose 72
percent as economic growth boosted revenue.  Net income climbed to 3.1 million euros ($4.4 million) from
1.8 million euros a year earlier, the Bonn-based company said
today in a statement. Revenue gained 44 percent to 213.8 million
euros, while operating profit fell 66 percent to 24.2 million
euros.  IVG said the results were lifted by an improvement in
Germany’s economy and real-estate market. The company reduced
its debt by about 450 million euros since mid-December. IVG
didn’t say in the statement how much debt is outstanding.  This year, net income will be “slightly” higher than in
2010 because of a lower  tax rate , IVG said in its  first-quarter
report , which was also published today.  IVG rose 0.5 percent to about 6 euros at 1:20 p.m. in
 Frankfurt . The shares have fallen 1 percent in the past six
months, reducing the company’s market value to 834 million
euros.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
