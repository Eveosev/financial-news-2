Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , the biggest
seller of gasoline-electric hybrid vehicles, introduced the
Prius alpha wagon in Japan today and aims to sell 3,000 units
of the model a month in the country.  The hybrid car is priced between 2.35 million yen
($29,000) and 3.3 million yen, the automaker said in a
statement today. The alpha wagon will be offered in 5- and 7-
seater versions, the Toyota City, Japan-based company said.  The model is called the Prius v in the U.S. and the
Prius + in  Europe . Toyota plans to sell 2,000 units a month
in each of those markets, said Hiroshi Kayukawa, head of a
Toyota engineering center. The car expands the Prius line,
which will also include a compact version.  Deliveries of the Prius alpha may take until April 2012,
after  Japan ’s record earthquake in March disrupted production,
Managing Officer Satoru Mouri said today in Tokyo. The
automaker has already received 25,000 orders for the model,
he said.  Toyota has sold more than 2 million Prius cars worldwide
since its introduction in Japan in 1997, making it the
world’s best-selling hybrid car. The Prius is a “pillar”
model for the automaker, President  Akio Toyoda  said at the
Detroit auto show in January.  Toyota has secured enough parts for hybrids so that
there isn’t “critical” parts shortage for gasoline-electric
hybrids, said Managing Officer Moritaka Yoshida.  Shares of Toyota gained 0.9 percent to 3,400 yen in
Tokyo at the 3 p.m. close of trading in  Tokyo . The stock has
dropped 6.9 percent since March 10, the day before the
earthquake.  To contact the reporter on this story:
