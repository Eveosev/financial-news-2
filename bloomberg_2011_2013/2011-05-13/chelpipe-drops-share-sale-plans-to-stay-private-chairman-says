ChelPipe,  Russia ’s third-largest
maker of steel pipes for oil and gas, dropped plans for an
initial public offering in  London  because the likely valuation
was below “fair value,” Chairman Sergei Moiseyev said.  “We chose to be a private company instead of doing an IPO
at a significant discount to our fair value,” Moiseyev said in
an interview in Moscow today, declining to value the company.
“We talked to 20 major investors in April and May. An IPO
doesn’t look like a viable option in the foreseeable future.”  ChelPipe, along with controlling owner Andrei Komarov, had
resumed talks with investors over the IPO plans in April after
saying on Feb. 10 it postponed the offer following “unusual
 market sentiment .” UralSib Capital estimated in April that the
sale may raise $630 million to $828 million for ChelPipe.  The pipemaker joins OAO Severstal unit Nord Gold NV, OAO
Koks, Euroset Holding NV and OAO Russian Helicopters among
Russian companies that delayed or scrapped IPOs in 2011 totaling
$4.5 billion amid weak demand. HMS Hydraulic Machines & Systems
Group Plc raised $360 million after lowering its IPO price.  While ChelPipe planned to use the sale proceeds to pay back
part of its 85.8 billion rubles ($3 billion) of debt, current
industry conditions mean the company is able to receive “good
 cash flow  and can handle the debt easily,” Moiseyev said.  ‘Big Discount’  The price range of $3.50 to $4.60 a share set in February
for the initial IPO plan, giving ChelPipe a value of $2 billion
to $2.7 billion, is now a “big discount” to the market as the
performance of the industry and company has improved, he said.  “This price reflected the risks, such as a delay in OAO
Gazprom’s South Stream pipeline project development,” Moiseyev
said. “If we chose to proceed with the IPO, we would sell half
the company at the price of one of its workshops.”  Russia’s total output of the kind of pipes made by ChelPipe
rose 24 percent in the first quarter, according to Metal
Courier, an independent data provider based in Dnepropetrovsk,
Ukraine. ChelPipe’s sales increased 45 percent in the period to
488,000 metric tons, the company said May 3.  “ChelPipe may return to an IPO in the future if they plan
acquisitions but for now the target is to pay debt,” Dmitry Smolin, an analyst at UralSib in Moscow, said by phone today.  The country’s output of large-diameter pipes, which account
for 45 percent of ChelPipe’s capacity, may expand by at least 15
percent this year,  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  wrote in an April 25 report.  “We forecast a renaissance in pipes,” Natalia Sheveleva,
an analyst at Gazprombank, which had managed the ChelPipe IPO,
wrote in a marketing report in January. Demand for large pipes
would rise an average 9.6 percent a year by 2013 on increased
use by Gazprom, the world’s largest gas producer, she said.  Russian companies including Nomos Bank, Etalon Group Ltd.
and Ros Agro Plc went ahead with IPOs this year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
