Lithuania ’s shale gas deposits may
become an alternative to supplies from Russia’s OAO Gazprom,
Energy Minister Arvydas Sekmokas said.  Lithuanian reserves of shale gas, located in the southwest
of the country, may cover the nation’s domestic consumption
needs for between 30 to 60 years, Sekmokas said in a statement,
citing estimates by the U.S.  Energy Information Administration .  Sekmokas said he discussed possible cooperation with the
U.S. authorities on shale gas production in Lithuania during his
visit to  Washington  this week.  “I’ll urge the government to take immediate steps to make
shale gas production a reality in Lithuania,” Sekmokas said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
