     June 1 (Bloomberg) -- Treasuries surged, pushing 10-year
note yields below 3 percent for the first time in 2011, as U.S.
companies added fewer jobs in May than economists forecast and
manufacturing expanded at the slowest pace in more than a year.  Yields dropped the most in more than two months after
falling last month the most since August. The yields fell today
below those of benchmark 10-year German bunds for the first time
in almost four weeks. The ADP Employer Services report on
company hiring came two days before the Labor Department’s
payrolls figures, which are forecast to show hiring slowed.  “Things have clearly changed,” said Larry Milstein,
managing director in  New York  of government and agency debt
trading at RW Pressprich & Co., a fixed-income broker and dealer
for institutional investors. “With the economy rolling over,
investors are getting concerned and flocking to the safety and
quality of Treasuries.”  Benchmark 10-year note yields dropped 12 basis points, or
0.12 percentage point, to 2.94 percent at 5:21 p.m. in New York,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 3.125 percent
security due in May 2021 increased 1 1/32, or $10.31 per $1,000
face amount, to 101 18/32.  Yields closed at the lowest level since Dec. 6 after the
biggest slide on a closing basis since March 16. The yields
dropped 23 basis points in May, the most since falling 44 basis
points in August.  A gain of more than one point in the 30-year bond today
pushed yields to 4.13 percent, the lowest since Dec. 1. Two-year
note yields touched 0.43 percent, the lowest since Dec. 7.  Investor Sentiment  Treasury note investors were more pessimistic than
optimistic on  U.S. debt  going into the week, according to a
sentiment index based on a poll of clients by JPMorgan Chase &
Co. The difference between the percentage of investors expecting
debt prices to increase and those expecting a decrease was
negative 14 percent.  “A lot of the real-money accounts who have not been
involved have been caught off guard,” said  Thomas Tucci , head
of U.S. government bond trading in New York at Royal Bank of
Canada’s RBC Capital Markets unit, one of 20 primary dealers
authorized to trade directly with the  Federal Reserve . “They
will have to purchase securities out at the longer end of the
yield curve to meet portfolio needs.”  Treasuries returned 1.6 percent in May, the most since
August, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes, as
 Europe ’s sovereign-debt crisis and a weakening U.S. economy
fueled demand for government debt.  Gross’s Assessment  Bill Gross , who runs the world’s biggest mutual fund at
Pacific Investment Management Co., said the returns have lulled
investors into a false sense of security because yields aren’t
high enough relative to inflation.  “Much of the Treasury yield curve now rests in negative
territory when compared with expected future inflation, and that
should send our bond investors into a hopping funk,” Gross
wrote in his monthly investment commentary today on  Newport
Beach , California-based Pimco’s website. “Prices are already
nearing the boiling point.”  With the  consumer price index  rising 3.2 percent on an
annual basis in April, the 10-year note yield offers investors a
so-called real yield of about negative 0.20 percent.  The difference between yields on 10-year notes and Treasury
Inflation Protected Securities, a gauge of trader expectations
for consumer prices over the life of the debt known as the
break-even rate, fell to 2.2 percentage points, the narrowest
spread since January.  Company Hiring  ADP reported that companies in the U.S. added only 38,000
workers in May compared with the addition of 177,000 in the
previous month. The median forecast of 37 economists in a
Bloomberg News survey was for an increase of 175,000.  Analysts cut their forecasts for growth in nonfarm
payrolls, with Goldman Sachs Group Inc., a primary dealer,
lowering its outlook to 100,000 from 150,000 after today’s data.  Employers added 170,000 positions last month after an
increase of 244,000 in April, the Labor Department is forecast
by economists to report June 3. The  unemployment rate  may have
fallen to 8.9 percent to 9 percent.  Bonds extended their gains after the  Institute for Supply
Management  reported that its factory index dropped to 53.5 last
month from 60.4 in April. The median forecast of 83 economists
in a Bloomberg News survey was for a decrease to 57.1. Figures
higher than 50 signal expansion.  Fed Rate Outlook  Futures contracts show the likelihood of a Fed rate
increase by March 2012 has dropped to 25 percent from 44 percent
a month ago. The central bank has kept its target rate for
overnight lending between banks in a range of zero to 0.25
percent since December 2008.  The Fed bought $7.37 billion of debt maturing from July
2017 to May 2018 today to support the economy under its $600
billion second round of quantitative easing, which expires this
month.  U.S. 10-year notes yielded five basis points less than
similar-maturity benchmark German debt, trailing for the first
time since May 6 on a closing basis. The 10-year bund yielded
2.99 percent.  Treasury gains will still give way to losses later this
year, according to economists’ estimates. Yields on 10-year
notes will advance to 3.82 percent by Dec. 31, according to the
average forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of banks and
securities companies, with the most recent forecasts given the
heaviest weightings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
