Heinrich Himmler read the
“Germania” of Tacitus in the fall of 1924, and got very
enthusiastic about the purity and nobility of the ancient
tribes. He wrote, “Thus shall we be again, or at least some
among us.”  (To listen to the podcast, click  here .)  Five years later, Hitler made Himmler head of the Waffen-
SS, which, by 1933, he’d expanded to 50,000 from 270 members.
Interested in racial purity, he wanted tall, blond, physically
fit men, and let it be known that attractive single women ready
to have Nazi babies would be set up with suitable fathers.  Just as the Germanic tribes described by Tacitus had
exempted elite men from monogamy, Himmler wanted to reward Nazi
heroes with several fair-haired, blue-eyed lovelies, ideally
trained in languages and chess.  The Reichsfuhrer himself had a blond but doughy wife, as
well as a sexier “little bunny” on the side, both of whom bore
his children.  Dark, near-sighted and lacking abs, Himmler fell far short
of his own genetic ideal. One provincial governor said, “If I
looked like Himmler, I wouldn’t even mention the word ‘race.’”  I spoke with Christopher Krebs, author of “A Most
Dangerous Book,” on the following topics:  1. German Tribes  2. Rediscovery of Tacitus  3. Ideological Readings  4. Nordic Warriors  5. Ethnic Cleansing  To buy this book in  North America , click  here .  ( Lewis Lapham  is the founder of  Lapham’s Quarterly  and the
