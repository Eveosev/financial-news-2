Former South African rugby captain
Joost van der Westhuizen has been diagnosed with motor neurone
disease, SuperSport reported, citing his physician, Henry
Kelbrick.  The disease slowly degenerates the muscles in the body and
Van Der Westhuizen will be affected from the waist down, the
Johannesburg-based broadcaster said in a report posted on
News24. There are few options available to him and Van Der
Westhuizen is resting in a Johannesburg hospital, SuperSport
cited Kelbrick as saying.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
