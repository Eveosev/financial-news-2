Naiade Resorts Ltd. (NRL) , Mauritius’s
third-largest hotel operator by market value, rose to the
highest in 15 months after Chief Executive Officer  Paul Jones 
said the group will return to profit in the year through June.  The stock rallied 0.8 rupee, or 2.4 percent, to 34 rupees
by the 1:30 p.m. close in Port Louis, its highest level since
January 2010, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The company expects to end the financial year in “positive
territory,” he told reporters in Port Louis yesterday. “Even
though the low season will be a big challenge.” Room occupancy
for April increased to 80 percent from 61 percent a year
earlier, Jones said.  Naiade returned to profit in the nine months through March,
with net income of 48.1 million rupees ($1.7 million) compared
with a loss of 275.5 million rupees, it said yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
