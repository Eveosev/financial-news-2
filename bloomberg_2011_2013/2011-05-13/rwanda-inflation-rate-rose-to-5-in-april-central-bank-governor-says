Inflation in  Rwanda  accelerated to 5
percent in April from 4.1 percent a month earlier, central bank

capital, today.  Food prices rose 6 percent in the month, compared with 8
percent in March, he said.  “We are not doing badly when compared with the region,”
Gatete said, citing a rate of 12 percent in  Kenya  and 14 percent
in  Uganda .  To contact the reporter on this story:
