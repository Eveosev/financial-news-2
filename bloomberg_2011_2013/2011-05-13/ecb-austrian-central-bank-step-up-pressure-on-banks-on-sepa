The  European Central Bank  and
 Austria ’s central bank stepped up pressure on banks to speed
full adoption of Europe’s common electronic payments system.  Policy makers from both central banks said that “given the
slower-than-expected” progress on use of the new platform they
want “concrete deadlines” on completion for credit transfers
by the end of January 2013 and direct debits by the end of
January 2014, according to an e-mailed statement by the
Frankfurt-based ECB.  “This regulation currently is in discussion in the
European parliament and in the Ecofin and it is very important
that we reach a conclusion here soon,” ECB Executive Board
member Gertrude Tumpel-Gugerell said at a payment system
conference in Vienna today. “We hope that there will be a
conclusion in the course of autumn.”  The Single European Payments Area, or SEPA, enables
customers to make euro payments across borders within  Europe 
using a single payment account and a single set of payment
instruments. Currently, 32 European countries are participating
in SEPA. More than 4,400 banks have joined the SEPA credit
transfer scheme, and more than 3,000 banks have signed up for
the direct debit scheme.  The ECB also said it wants payment cards across Europe to
be “issued with only a chip and not with a magnetic stripe,
since the latter is an easy target for fraudsters.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
