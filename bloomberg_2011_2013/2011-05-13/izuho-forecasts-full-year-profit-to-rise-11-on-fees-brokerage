Mizuho Financial Group Inc. (8411) ,  Japan â€™s
third-largest bank by market value, unexpectedly forecast profit
will rise 11 percent this fiscal year as higher fees and demand
for brokerage services help offset an increase in bad-loan costs.  Net income will jump to 460 billion yen ($5.7 billion) for
the year ending March 31 from 413 billion yen a year earlier,
the Tokyo-based lender said in a statement to the  Tokyo  Stock
Exchange today. That compares with the median 385 billion yen
profit estimate of 12 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
