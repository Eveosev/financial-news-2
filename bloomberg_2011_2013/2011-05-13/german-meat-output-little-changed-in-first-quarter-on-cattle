Meat production in  Germany , the
European Union’s largest pork consumer, was little changed in
the first quarter as an increase in hog butchering compensated
for a decline in cattle slaughtering.  Output of beef, pork and other meat rose 0.4 percent to
1.99 million metric tons, the Federal Statistics Office said in
a  report  on its website yesterday.  “The trend of continuous strong increases in meat
production, which had been observed since 2005, thus did not
continue,” the statistics office said. Production was held back
by “the marked decrease in cattle slaughtering,” it said.  The country is the EU’s second-largest meat producer behind
France and the biggest holder of pigs in the 27-nation bloc,
ahead of Spain and  France .  Germany processed 14.3 million hogs in the quarter, up 0.2
percent from a year earlier, lifting pork production 1.1 percent
to 1.36 million tons. Pork accounted for 68 percent of the
country’s meat output in the period.  Poultry-meat production advanced 1.8 percent to 344,500
tons, according to the report. Germany’s beef output fell 4.1
percent to 283,800 tons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
