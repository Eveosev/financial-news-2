Croatian refiner INA Industrija Nafte
d.d., controlled by Hungary’s Mol Nyrt., plans to pay a dividend
equal to half of its 2010 profit.  INA proposes to pay 480.5 million Croatian kuna ($93
million) in dividends, Mol said today in an e-mailed statement.
The remainder of 2010 earnings will be reinvested in INA,
according to the statement.  Mol and the Croatian government agreed on the dividend, Mol
said in the statement.  “INA has shown good results in facing challenges in the
industry,”  Croatia ’s  Finance Ministry  said in an e-mailed
statement. “Therefore a good foundation was provided to pay out
50 percent of the profit as dividends,” it said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
