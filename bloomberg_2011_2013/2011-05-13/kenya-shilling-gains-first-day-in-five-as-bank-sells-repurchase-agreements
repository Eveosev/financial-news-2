Kenya’s shilling strengthened for the
first day in five against the dollar after the  central bank  sold
repurchase agreements to curb supply of the currency and counter
depreciation caused by its purchase of euros this week.  The currency of East Africa’s biggest economy appreciated
as much as 0.3 percent to 85.83 per dollar and traded 0.2
percent stronger at 85.92 by 12:06 p.m. in the capital, Nairobi,
having closed yesterday at 86.10.  Kenya’s shilling slumped as much as 0.6 percent to 86.23
yesterday, the weakest on a closing basis since 1994, after the
central bank bought 14 million euros ($20 million) this week to
build up reserves. To counter the weakening effect of foreign-
currency purchases, the Central Bank of Kenya sold 2 billion
shillings ($23 million) of  repurchase agreements  this week and
plans another 1 billion-shilling sale today to “mop up”
shillings from the market, it said in a statement today.  “The shilling has gained ground against the dollar due to
the tight liquidity in the market following the ‘mop up’
exercise,” Jeremiah Kendagor, head of trading at Nairobi-based
Kenya Commercial Bank Ltd., said in a phone interview today.
“It’s likely to trade within the 85.80 to 86.10 range in the
coming days.”  In a repurchase agreement an investor agrees to sell a
security to another trader, while at the same time arranging to
buy it back at a future date and at a pre-determined price.  Kenya’s usable foreign-exchange reserves increased to $3.96
billion, or 3.84 months’ import cover, last week from $3.956
billion in the week to April 29, the Nairobi-based Central Bank
of  Kenya  said in an e-mailed statement on May 6.  The Central Bank of Kenya Act stipulates the country must
hold a minimum of four months of import cover in reserve.  To contact the reporter on this story:
