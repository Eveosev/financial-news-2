Wheat farmers began harvesting in
southern  Oklahoma  this week, about two weeks earlier than usual,
as “devastating” drought speeds up crop development, U.S.
Wheat Associates said.  Temperatures that reached 100 degrees Fahrenheit (38
Celsius) during the weekend and high winds “significantly
affected an already dismal crop,” the trade group said today in
a report on its website.  Harvesting started about three weeks ago in coastal regions
of  Texas , and crops in the southern part of the state were
showing “good test weights and very good protein,” according
to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
