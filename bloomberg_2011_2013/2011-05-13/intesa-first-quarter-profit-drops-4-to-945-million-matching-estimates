Intesa Sanpaolo SpA (ISP) ,  Italy ’s second-
biggest bank, said first-quarter profit declined 4 percent as
the company’s tax rate increased and higher trading income
failed to offset a slump in earnings from the insurance unit.  Net income fell to 661 million euros ($945 million) from
688 million euros a year earlier, the Turin, Italy-based lender
said in a statement today. That compared with the 658 million-
euro average estimate of 15 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  “The results are mainly trading driven, apparently lower
quality than other banks which reported so far,” Carlo Tommaselli, a Milan-based analyst at Societe Generale SA who has
a “hold” recommendation on the stock, wrote in a note to
clients today.  Intesa, led by Chief Executive Officer  Corrado Passera ,
plans to raise as much as 5 billion euros by selling new shares
to boost capital before the implementation of stricter capital
rules. The stock sale is part of a new business plan, which
targets net income of 4.2 billion euros by 2013 and 5.6 billion
euros in 2015.  The company’s tax rate in the first quarter rose to 39
percent from 31 percent a year earlier. Net trading income
climbed to 278 million euros from 218 million euros, while
earnings from its insurance business dropped by half to 120
million euros. Loan-loss provisions fell 9 percent to 680
million euros.  Intesa said recurring profit may increase this year as it
cuts operating expenses and the cost of credit. The core Tier 1
capital ratio, a key measure of financial strength, stood at 8.2
percent as of March 31, up from 7.9 percent in December. CEO
Passera expects the ratio to reach 10 percent by the end of 2011
after the bank has completed its share sale.  Intesa fell 1.6 percent at 2.07 euros as of 12:45 p.m.
local time, for a market value of about 26.2 billion euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
