U.S. Treasury Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner  reiterated that Congress should move “as quickly as
possible” to raise the federal debt limit.  “Because Congress has not yet acted, we have now set in
motion a series of extraordinary measures that will give
Congress some additional time to raise the debt limit,”
Geithner said in a statement today on the release of Social
Security and Medicare Trustee reports. “I want to again
encourage Congress to move as quickly as possible.”  The U.S. is scheduled to reach the $14.29 trillion debt
limit May 16 and can keep borrowing until about Aug. 2 by taking
steps that include declaring a “debt-issuance suspension
period” under the statute governing the Civil Service
Retirement and Disability Fund, Geithner said last week. That
will allow the U.S. to redeem existing Treasury securities held
by that fund as investments.  Democrats and Republicans are debating how much to trim the
deficit and whether to extend the debt ceiling. Senate Minority
Leader  Mitch McConnell , a Kentucky Republican, said yesterday he
wants “significant” near-term cuts in federal agency budgets
paired with longer-term reductions to programs like Medicare and
Medicaid in exchange for his support for an increase in the debt
limit.  To contact the reporters on this story:
