CPP Investment Board, Canada’s
second-biggest retirement  fund manager , bought 50 percent of a
shopping mall in Germany valued at 1.3 billion euros ($1.9
billion).  CPPIB purchased the stake in CentrO Oberhausen from Stadium
Group by making an equity investment of 270 million euros, the
Toronto-based fund manager said in a statement today. The mall,
near the city of Dusseldorf, has space of 1.6 million square
feet (150,000 square meters).  “We are very pleased to be acquiring a significant
interest in what is widely regarded as one of the top large-
scale regional shopping centers in Europe,” Graeme Eadie,
senior vice-president at CPPIB’s real estate investments unit,
said in the statement.  CPPIB said in a separate statement that it acquired a 36.9
percent stake in the Mayflower Partnership, which owns 13 U.S.
malls in  New England  valued at $2.03 billion. The Canadian
company invested $350 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
