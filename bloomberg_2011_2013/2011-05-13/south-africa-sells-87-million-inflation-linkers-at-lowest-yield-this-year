South Africa  sold inflation-linked
bonds at the lowest yields this year after the central bank said
it is concerned about price increases in Africa’s largest
economy.  The  Reserve Bank  auctioned 600 million rand ($87 million)
of linkers, as the bonds are known, maturing in 2022, 2028 and
2033 at its weekly auction, it said on its Bloomberg page.
Investors bid for 5.1 times the amount allocated. Returns on
linkers relative to fixed-interest bonds increase when inflation
accelerates.  The central bank yesterday said it expects inflation to
breach the upper range of its 3 percent to 6 percent target
range in the fourth quarter, peaking at 6.3 percent in the first
quarter of 2012. South  Africa ’s inflation rate, due to be
reported on May 17, probably advanced to 4.4 percent in April,
from 4.1 percent the month before and 3.7 percent in February,
according to the median estimate of 18 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg.  “We will be very vigilant and we will closely monitor”
price increases, Reserve Bank Governor Gill Marcus said in a
televised address after announcing the rate decision. “The
risks are to the upside” for inflation, she added.  The Reserve Bank allocated 165 million rand of 2.75 percent
linkers maturing in 2022 at an average yield of 2.53 percent,
the lowest since a Nov. 24 auction of similar-maturity debt. It
sold 225 million rand of 2.6 percent notes maturing in 2028 at
an average yield of 2.59, the lowest since Dec. 1, and 210
million rand of 3.45 percent securities due in 2033 at an
average yield of 2.55 percent, the lowest since Nov. 24.  To contact the reporter on this story:
