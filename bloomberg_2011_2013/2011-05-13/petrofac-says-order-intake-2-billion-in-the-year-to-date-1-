Petrofac Ltd. (PFC) , a U.K.-based oil and
gas engineer, said it has taken $2 billion in orders this year
after winning contracts in Algeria, Iraq and  Malaysia .  The company’s order backlog stood at $12.3 billion at the
end of the April, compared with a backlog of $11.7 billion
pounds a year earlier, Petrofac said in a statement today.
Engineering and construction work account for $9.4 billion of
total orders, the company said.  “We anticipate group backlog to remain relatively stable
over 2011,” Chief Executive Officer Ayman Asfari said in the
statement. Asfari said he is “increasingly confident,” London-
based Petrofac will achieve net income growth in 2011 excluding
demerger profits.  The company was awarded a $1.2 billion contract for further
development of the southern In Salah gas field in Algeria in
January. Petrofac won a $240 million contract earlier this year
to build production facilities on the Majnoon field for  Royal
Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  and is bidding for “a number of other projects
in the country over the coming months.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
