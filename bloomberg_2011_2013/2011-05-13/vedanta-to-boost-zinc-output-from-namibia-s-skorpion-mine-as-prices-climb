Vedanta Resources Plc (VED) , the metals
producer with assets from Africa to Australia, plans to boost
output from its Skorpion zinc mine in  Namibia  to take advantage
of rising prices for the stainless steel-making ingredient.  The company, based in London, aims to produce 155,000
metric tons of high-grade zinc from Skorpion this year, up from
151,688 tons in the previous 12 months, Chris Movirongo,
corporate affairs and sustainable development manager, said in
an e-mailed response to questions today.  Vedanta, which last year bought zinc assets from  Anglo
American Plc (AAL)  and is now awaiting approval to take a controlling
stake in oil company Cairn India Ltd., is boosting output to
take advantage of rising commodity prices. Zinc, used to protect
metals against corrosion, has climbed 18 percent on the  London 
Metal Exchange since the start of June last year.  Vedanta, controlled by Indian billionaire Anil Agarwal, is
searching for new zinc oxide deposits near Skorpion in an
attempt to extend the lifespan of the operation beyond 2015,
Movirongo said. The company’s Sterlite Industries unit paid
Anglo about $707 million for Skorpion, it said on Dec. 3.  To contact the reporter on this story:
