(Corrects first paragraph to say regulator working to
introduce program “as soon as possible.”)  China ’s securities regulator is
working to introduce a so-called mini-QFII program “as soon as
possible,” said Wang Lin, director-general of the department of
fund supervision at the China Securities Regulatory Commission.  “By now, the relevant systems have taken shape,” Wang
said at a conference in  Hong Kong  today. “We are working with
other agencies on refining them and introducing the service as
soon as possible.”  China has approved 13 domestic fund-management companies to
set up branches in Hong Kong, Wang said. Nine have won asset-
management licenses in Hong Kong, while three are already
managing publicly raised capital, he said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
