Asia gasoline declined this week by
the most in almost a year on concern that rising prices are
curbing motor fuel consumption. Gasoil and  fuel oil  gained for
the first week in three. Hin Leong Trading Pte bought gasoil and
Brightoil Petroleum Holdings Inc. purchased fuel oil.  Light Distillates  Benchmark 92-RON gasoline fell 8.1 percent this week, the
biggest drop since May 21, 2010, to $120.85 a barrel, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Open-specification naphtha for delivery to  Japan  gained
$44, or 4.7 percent, to $984.50 a metric ton this week,
Bloomberg data showed. The premium of Japan-delivered naphtha to
 Brent crude  traded in  London , or the crack spread, rose to
$127.43 a ton from $112.36 at the end of Asian trading May 6.  Gasoline’s premium to naphtha halved to $13.40 a barrel
from $29 on May 6, based on Bloomberg data. A narrower reforming
margin indicates it’s less profitable to turn naphtha into
gasoline compared with last week.  In  Singapore , Arcadia Petroleum Ltd. bought 50,000 barrels
of 92-RON gasoline for loading June 2 to June 6 from Morgan
Stanley at $121 a barrel, traders said. Arcadia bought 50,000
barrels of 92-RON for the same loading period from Trafigura
Beheer BV at $120.80 a barrel.  Glencore sold 25,000 tons of naphtha for first-half July
delivery to Royal Dutch Shell Plc at $990 a ton. Cargill Inc.
bought 25,000 tons of naphtha for first-half July from BP Plc at
$987 a ton.  Middle Distillates  Gasoil, or diesel, with 0.5 percent sulfur rose $4.10, or
3.4 percent, this week to $125.15 a barrel, according to
Bloomberg data. That’s the first weekly gain in three weeks. Jet
fuel climbed $5.70, or 4.7 percent, from last week to $126.80.  In Singapore, Hin Leong bought 150,000 barrels of 0.5
percent sulfur gasoil from Singapore Petroleum Co. at 10 cents a
barrel above benchmark quotes, traders said. That’s the same
premium as yesterday’s transaction, when Hin Leong was a seller.  Gasoil’s premium to Asian benchmark Dubai crude dropped 96
cents this week to $17.70 a barrel at 6:03 p.m. Singapore time,
based on data from PVM Oil Associates, a broker. This crack
spread, a measure of refining profit, declined for a fifth week,
the longest losing streak since December 2009.  Jet fuel’s premium to gasoil gained 5 cents today to $1.80
a barrel, the highest since March 1, PVM said. This regrade has
more than doubled from 85 cents last week, indicating it’s more
profitable to produce  aviation fuel  over diesel.  Fuel Oil  Benchmark 180-centistoke fuel oil climbed $28.50, or 4.6
percent, this week to $643.25 a ton, according to Bloomberg
data. That’s the first weekly gain in three weeks. The price of
380-centistoke fuel oil, mainly used as marine fuel, rose $27,
or 4.5 percent, from last week to $632 a ton.  In Singapore, Brightoil bought 20,000 tons of 180-
centistoke fuel oil from BP Plc, bringing its purchases this
month to 480,000 tons, traders said. The company paid $2 a ton
over benchmark quotes.  Fuel oil’s discount to Dubai crude narrowed 31 cents today
to $7.56 a barrel, based on Bloomberg data. The difference
narrowed for a second week, signaling reduced losses for
refiners turning oil into residual products.  The premium of 180-centistoke fuel oil to 380-centistoke
grade was unchanged after rising yesterday to $11.25 a ton,
Bloomberg data showed. This viscosity spread advanced 15 percent
this week, snapping a three-week losing streak.  To contact the reporters on this story:
