Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  reiterated that
its ethylene plant at Pulau Bukom, Singapore, may only start up
after the middle of this month.  The “earliest possible” restart isn’t expected before the
middle of May, the company said in an e-mailed statement today.
Shell shut the plant on March 18 because of technical problems,
according to the notice. The company said April 11 that the
facility isn’t expected to start up before mid-May.  “Our manufacturing and technology teams have been working
round the clock and continue to work hard to determine the cause
of the technical problems,” Shell said. “Repairs are being
carried out with the utmost urgency to fix these technical
problems.”  The European refiner declared force majeure on some
chemical contracts from the plant because of unplanned
operational issues, according to an e-mail from the company on
March 21. Force majeure is a legal clause allowing companies to
miss deliveries because of circumstances beyond their control.  The  Singapore  cracker complex has the ability to turn
naphtha, liquefied petroleum gas and heavy hydrocarbons into
chemicals. It has an annual capacity to produce 800,000 metric
tons of ethylene, 450,000 tons of propylene and 230,000 tons of
benzene, according to the company’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
