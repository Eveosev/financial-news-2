Ukraine’s economic growth will
probably accelerate next year on increasing investments, Finance
Minister Fedir Yaroshenko said.  Gross domestic product will grow 6.5 percent in 2012,
compared with this year’s forecast of 4.5 percent, Yaroshenko
told parliament today in Kiev while presenting budget policies
for next year.  Ukraine’s economy advanced 4.2 percent in 2010 after
shrinking almost 15 percent in 2009 as the global financial
crisis dried up investments. The former Soviet state’s GDP rose
about 5.3 percent last quarter, the central bank estimates,
compared with 2.4 percent in neighboring  Hungary  and 3.5 percent
in Slovakia.  The 2012 forecast “is based on the positive economic
development trend achieved last year and that strengthened this
year,” Yaroshenko told the legislature. “The main reasons for
economic growth will be a recovery in investment activity and
the modernization of industries.”  The government wants to cut the  budget deficit  to 2.5
percent of GDP from 3.1 percent in 2011, he said. A majority of
lawmakers in the 450-seat parliament backed the plan.  The inflation rate is expected to fall to 7.9 percent next
year, while producer prices will jump 9.7 percent, Yaroshenko
said. The hryvnia rate is seen at 7.9 to 8 per dollar in 2012,
he said.  Ukraine’s government wants to cut the state debt to 30
percent of GDP next year, Yaroshenko said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
