Manchester United manager  Alex
Ferguson  has been charged with improper conduct by  England ’s
Football Association for his comments about referee Howard Webb
prior to last weekend’s Premier League match against Chelsea.  Ferguson was cited for breaking the rule that prohibits
managers from speaking about officials before a game. United won
the match 2-1.  “We are getting the best referee, there is no doubt about
that,” Ferguson was quoted as saying by U.K. media two days
before the match. “But (getting a bad decision) is definitely
our big fear. We have the players to do it all right. We just
hope it’s our turn for a little bit of luck.”  Ferguson has until 4 p.m. London time on May 16 to respond
to the charge, the F.A. said on its website. He was suspended
five matches in March for critical comments about referee  Martin
Atkinson  following a 2-1 loss at Chelsea.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
