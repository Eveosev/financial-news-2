The baht gained after foreign
investors pumped funds into the country’s stock market and Fitch
Ratings raised its outlook on  Thailand ’s local-currency credit
rating yesterday.  The currency rebounded from its biggest one-day decline in
four months after Fitch lifted its outlook to stable from
negative, citing an earlier-than-expected stabilization in the
nation’s finances. Overseas investors bought $146 million more
local equities than they sold this week through yesterday,
exchange data show.  “The currency has benefited from the Fitch decision,”
said  Enrico Tanuwidjaja , an economist at OSK-DMG Group in
 Singapore . “For Asian currencies we generally see a
strengthening bias because of the economic growth story.”  The baht rose 0.1 percent to 30.30 per dollar as of 8:31
a.m. in Bangkok, after touching 30.26 earlier, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The currency headed for an 0.2 percent
weekly decline on renewed concern about  Europe ’s debt crisis.  Fitch affirmed its ‘A-’ rating on Thailand’s long-term
local-currency issuer default rating. Standard & Poor’s Ratings
Services raised the outlook on Thailand’s local-currency credit
rating to stable in December.  The yield on the 3.125 percent bond due December 2015 rose
two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, this week to 3.42
percent and was unchanged today. The onshore one-year interest-
rate swap, the fixed cost needed to receive a floating payment,
advanced two basis points to 3.18 percent. The rate fell four
basis points for the week.
