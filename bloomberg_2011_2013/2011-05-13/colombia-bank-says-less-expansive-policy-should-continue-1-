Colombia ’s central bank said
“exceptionally low”  interest rates  over a prolonged period
could generate risks to financial stability, sustainable
economic growth and future inflation.  “Considering all these factors and the time it takes
monetary policy to exert an impact on aggregate spending and
inflation, the board felt the move toward a less expansive
policy must continue,” the bank said in  minutes  of the April 29
meeting posted on its web site today. The “new rate still
supports short-term growth in output and employment.”  At the meeting, policy makers raised borrowing costs for a
third month in a bid to head off inflationary pressure while
also pledging to maintain efforts to restrain the peso’s rally.  The seven-member board increased the benchmark interest
rate by a quarter point to 3.75 percent. The bank cited a higher
2011 growth forecast, higher  home prices  and expanding loan
growth in raising the rate.  The yield on the nation’s 10 percent bonds due July 2024
was little changed at 8.20 percent, according to Colombia’s
stock exchange. The bond’s price rose 114.130 centavos per peso.  The peso slid 0.6 percent to 1,810.00 per  U.S. dollar  a
11:35 p.m. New York time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
