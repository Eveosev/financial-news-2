Crude oil rose for a second day and
was headed for a weekly gain in  New York  after stronger-than-
forecast economic growth figures for the euro zone fanned
speculation that fuel demand in  Europe  will increase.  Futures climbed as much as 1.7 percent to more than $100 a
barrel. Gross domestic product growth in the 17-nation euro
region accelerated to 0.8 percent from 0.3 percent, the European
Union’s statistics office said, beating the 0.6 percent median
forecast in a Bloomberg survey. The Bank of  Korea  unexpectedly
kept  interest rates  unchanged after two increases this year.  “Eurozone GDP figures helped the gains and the Bank of
Korea is holding rates, diminishing some concerns about monetary
tightening in Asia,” said  Michael Hewson , London-based market
analyst at CMC Markets.  Crude for June delivery gained as much as $1.73 to $100.70
a barrel in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  and traded at $100.40 at 1:40 p.m. London time. Prices
are up 3.3 percent this week, following last week’s 15 percent
plunge, and have risen 35 percent in the past year.  Brent oil for June settlement rose $1.72, or 1.5 percent,
to $114.70 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe
exchange. The contract is up 5.1 percent this week.  The oil market is “structurally bullish,”  Jeffrey Currie ,
the London-based head of commodity research at Goldman Sachs
Group Inc., said in an interview.  European Economic Growth  “Long-term and medium-term we’re still structurally
bullish,” Currie said today in London. Volatility in  oil prices 
will begin to stabilize next month and prices are likely to be
higher in 12 months, he said.  Germany and  France  powered economic growth in the euro area
in the first quarter as booming exports fueled domestic spending
in the bloc’s core, offsetting turmoil sparked by sovereign debt
woes in Greece, Ireland and Portugal.  German GDP jumped 1.5 percent from the fourth quarter and
the French GDP rose 1 percent, exceeding economists’ median
forecasts of 0.9 percent and 0.6 percent respectively. Austria’s
economy grew by 1 percent and the Netherlands’ by 0.9 percent.  Rising floodwaters on the  Mississippi River  may affect 10
percent of Louisiana’s onshore crude oil production. Opening the
state’s Morganza spillway to alleviate flooding may affect 2,264
 oil wells  that produce 19,278 barrels a day, said Matt Ross,
communications director for the Louisiana Oil & Gas Association.  Iraq Output  About 150 companies are preparing for an onslaught of water
should the spillway be opened, Ross said. The work includes
removing lease equipment and adding markers to wells.  Iraq may raise its oil production capacity to 7 million
barrels a day by 2020 “if all goes well,” thereby adding to
OPEC’s spare capacity, said Leo Drollas, London-based chief
economist at the Centre for Global Energy Studies.  “If all goes well, by 2015 there will be this spare
capacity problem,” he said today at the Platts Crude Oil
Markets conference in  London . He added that the 2020 forecast
for Iraq is “optimistic.”  Brent, the European benchmark, traded at a premium of
$14.38 a barrel to U.S. futures. The difference between front-
month contracts in London and New York surged to a record $19.54
on Feb. 21. It averaged 76 cents last year.  Crude may decline next week as U.S. inventories increase
and fuel consumption drops, a Bloomberg News survey showed.  Nineteen of 38 analysts, or 50 percent, forecast oil will
fall through May 20. Ten respondents, or 26 percent, predicted
prices will advance and nine projected little change. Last week,
50 percent of respondents said futures would decline.  To contact the reporters on this story:
