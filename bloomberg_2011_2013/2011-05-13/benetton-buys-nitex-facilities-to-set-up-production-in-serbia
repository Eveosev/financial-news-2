Benetton Group SpA (BEN) ,  Italy ’s largest
clothing retailer, bought production facilities of apparel maker
Nitex d.o.o. in  Serbia ’s southern city of Nis, the  Privatization
Agency  said.  The owner of Sisley and Playlife brands and the sole bidder
in an auction in Belgrade, Benetton paid 3 million euros ($4.3
million) for Nitex, the state-run agency said in an e-mailed
statement.  Earlier this year, Benetton said it would invest 43.2
million euros ($61.7 million) in a textile plant in southern
Serbia and offer employment to 2,700 people over the next four
years, backed by government subsidies of 9,000 euros for each
new job.  The arrival of Benetton is part of Serbia’s efforts to
clinch business partnerships with big international companies,
including  Fiat SpA (F) , Yura Corp.,  Panasonic Corp. (6752) , or Falke, the
agency said, citing Vladislav Cvetkovic, the head of the
Privatization Agency.  The aim is no longer to finance the budget “but to
activate as many production facilities in Serbia as possible and
create jobs to as many workers as possible, ensuring safe
investments and respectable partners,” with long-term goals, he
said.  Unemployment in Serbia was 20 percent at the end of 2010
and the government of Prime Minister  Mirko Cvetkovic  decided to
temporarily cut payroll taxes for employers who create jobs to
reduce the  unemployment rate  and crack down on illegal workers
less than a year before general elections.  To contact the reporter on this story:
