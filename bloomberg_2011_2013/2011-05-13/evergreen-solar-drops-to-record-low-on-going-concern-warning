Evergreen Solar Inc. (ESLR) , a maker of thin
polysilicon wafers, dropped to a record low after saying it’s
unsure whether it will be able to remain in business due to
liquidity concerns.  Evergreen sank as much as 28 percent and was down 36 cents,
or 26 percent, to $1.05 a share as of 10:24 a.m. in Nasdaq Stock
Market trading. That’s the lowest for the Marlboro,
Massachusetts-based company since it first sold shares at $14
more than 10 years ago.  “There is substantial doubt regarding our ability to
maintain liquidity sufficient to operate our business and our
ability to continue as a going concern,” the company said in a
filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission yesterday.  In March, Evergreen shut its factory in Devens,
 Massachusetts , and dismissed about 800 workers, and the state’s
economic assistance agency sought to rescind $58 million in
incentives the company was awarded in 2007.  The company said its survival depends on obtaining
additional financing from third parties and a successful
restructuring of at least a substantial portion of its debt.  The Marlboro, Massachusetts-based company last month warned
it may need to raise cash to continue operations after first-
quarter sales fell short of expectations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
