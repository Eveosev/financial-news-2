France denied suggestions it has
failed to apply European Union rules limiting banker bonuses,
saying payouts at the investment banks owned by major French
lenders fell in 2010.  Bonus payments were the equivalent of 30 percent of profit
at those units, down from 100 percent in 2009, a  Finance
Ministry  official told reporters today in Paris. Half of bonuses
are now being paid in shares and payouts are no longer
guaranteed, he said.  The Finance Ministry made the statement after a report by
lawmakers in the European Parliament suggested the country
hasn’t applied the bonus rules. France’s biggest banks,
including  BNP Paribas (BNP)  SA, Societe Generale SA, and Credit
Agricole SA, published earnings this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
