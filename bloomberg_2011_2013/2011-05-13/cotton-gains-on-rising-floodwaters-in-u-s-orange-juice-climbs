Cotton futures rose from a four-month
low on bets that floods along the  Mississippi  and Ohio rivers
may slash production in the U.S., the world’s leading exporter.  The rivers, swollen by heavy rain and melted snow, have
been inundating cities and towns for weeks, flooding cropland
and disrupting shipping. The rising Mississippi is now
threatening farms between Memphis,  Tennessee , and the  Gulf of
Mexico . Before today, the price slumped 34 percent since
reaching a record on March 2 on concern that demand will slow in
 China , the biggest importer.’  “There are still a lot of concerns for weather and a lot
of concerns for supply this year,” said Louis Barbera, a broker
at VIP Commodities in New York. “It shows how strong the market
really is, even with the recent downturn.”  Cotton futures for July delivery rose 0.85 cent, or 0.6
percent, to settle at $1.4515 at 2:30 p.m. on ICE Futures U.S.
in  New York . Earlier, the price touched $1.4206, the lowest for
a most-active contract since Jan. 14.  Dry weather in Texas, the biggest U.S. grower, may crimp
output, U.S. government data showed this week.  Planting in Texas was estimated at 6.12 million acres this
year, followed by Georgia at 1.45 million, U.S. Department of
Agriculture data showed. Mississippi was fifth at 530,000 acres,
followed by Tennessee at 470,000. Missouri was ninth at 360,000.  To contact the reporters on this story:
