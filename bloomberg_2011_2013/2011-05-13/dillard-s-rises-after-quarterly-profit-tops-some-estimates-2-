Dillard’s Inc. (DDS) , the Arkansas-based
department-store chain, rose the most in a year in New York
trading after first-quarter profit surpassed some analysts’
estimates.  Earnings excluding some items amounted to $1.27 a share,
Dillard’s said today in a statement. The average of two analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg was for a profit of 91 cents. Sales in the
period ended April 30 climbed 1.1 percent to $1.5 billion.  Revenue has risen in back-to-back quarters after 15
consecutive declines. The Little Rock-based chain, founded more
than 70 years ago by William T. Dillard, operates more than 300
locations across the U.S., as well as an online shop.  Nordstrom Inc., the Seattle-based retailer with more than
100 department stores, cut its annual profit forecast yesterday,
citing acquisition costs. The shares fell 3.1 percent.  Dillard’s jumped $7.41, or 15 percent, to $56 at 4:02 p.m.
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, the largest gain
since May 2010. The shares have risen 48 percent this year.  The chain announced plans in January to form a wholly owned
real estate investment trust, seeking greater access to debt and
equity markets to enhance liquidity. Dillard’s said it would
transfer to the REIT some of its interests in properties and
then lease them back.  To contact the reporter on this story:
