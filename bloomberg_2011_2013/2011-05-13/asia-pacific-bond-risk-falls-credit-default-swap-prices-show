The cost of protecting bonds in the
Asia-Pacific region from non-payment decreased, according to
traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx  Japan  index fell 2 basis points to 118
basis points as of 9:03 a.m. in Tokyo, according to Deutsche
Bank AG. The risk benchmark is headed for its lowest level since
March 22, prices from data provider CMA in New York show.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index declined 1.5 basis points
to 106.5 as of 10:07 a.m. in Sydney, Credit Agricole CIB prices
show.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 50 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan dropped 1.25 basis points to 106.25
basis points as of 8:07 a.m. in Singapore, according to Credit
Agricole.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
