Italy’s  Saras SpA (SRS)  started processing
units at its Sarroch refinery in Sardinia following maintenance
that began at the beginning of April.  The turnaround, which began on April 4 was “successfully
completed” and full production is expected on May 16, Dario
Scaffardi, general manager at Saras, said on a conference call
today, according to a transcript.  The company said earlier today in a statement two mild
hydrocracking units MHC1 and MHC2, visbreaking unit VSB, crude
distillation unit T1 and vacuum unit V1 would undergo
maintenance in the second quarter.  The refinery can process 300,000 barrels of crude a day,
according to the company’s  website . That represents about 15
percent of Italy’s refining capacity.  Hydrocrackers produce distillates such as diesel and jet
fuel. Visbreakers raise the amount of diesel and gasoil that can
be processed from heavy oil-products.  To contact the reporter on this story:
