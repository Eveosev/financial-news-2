Life Partners Holdings Inc. (LPHI) , the
company that purchases insurance policies, said U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission investigators plan to recommend the
agency file civil claims against the company and Chief Executive
Officer Brian Pardo.  The case focuses on the company’s disclosures tied to
projections of life expectancies, Waco, Texas-based Life
Partners said in a regulatory filing today. The company will
respond to the SEC’s so-called Wells notice to explain why it
believes claims aren’t warranted, according to the filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
