Positivo Informatica SA (POSI3) , Brazil’s
biggest computer maker, fell the most in almost six months after
its first-quarter loss exceeded analysts’ estimates.  The shares dropped 7.8 percent to 6.60 reais at the close
of  Sao Paulo  trading at 4:15 p.m. New York time, the most since
Nov. 16. The benchmark Bovespa stock index slid 1.2 percent to
63,235.30.  The company reported an adjusted net loss of 33.7 million
reais ($20.5 million). That compares with a loss of 12.8 million
reais, according to the average estimate of three analysts in a
Bloomberg survey.  “Positivo reported very weak results for the first
quarter, coming in at below our already poor estimates,
attributable to declining volumes, pressured prices and less
dilution of fixed costs,” Bradesco Corretora’s analysts Luis Azevedo and Tales Freire wrote in a note to clients. Bradesco
forecast a quarterly loss of 17.3 million.  Brazil ’s computer industry has seen its profitability slide
as tougher competition has eroded prices, Positivo said in the
filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
