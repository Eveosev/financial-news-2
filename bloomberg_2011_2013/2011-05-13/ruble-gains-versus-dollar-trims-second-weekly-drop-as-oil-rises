The ruble appreciated against the
dollar, trimming its second straight weekly decline, as oil
rebounded above $100 a barrel.  The Russian currency gained 0.3 percent to 27.94 per dollar
by the 5 p.m. close in Moscow, trimming this week’s drop to 0.8
percent. Against the euro, the ruble slumped 0.5 percent to
39.8949.  Crude oil,  Russia ’s chief export, climbed as much as 1.8
percent to $100.70 a barrel in  New York , recovering from a 1.1
percent retreat earlier today, after Germany’s economic growth
accelerated more than forecast in the first quarter, spurring
optimism fuel demand will recover in  Europe ’s largest economy.  Moves against the dollar and the euro left the ruble little
changed at 33.3197 versus the central bank’s target currency
basket, which it uses to manage swings that hurt Russian
exporters. The basket is calculated by multiplying the dollar’s
rate to the ruble by 0.55, the euro to ruble rate by 0.45, then
adding them together.  To contact the reporters on this story:
