Japanese stocks fell, dragged down by
banks after the government said public pressure may force
financial firms to write off loans to  Tokyo  Electric Power Co.,
operator of an earthquake-damaged nuclear reactor.  Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. (8306) ,  Japan ’s biggest
publicly traded bank, and its closest rival  Sumitomo Mitsui
Financial Group Inc. (8316)  fell at least 2.8 percent after Chief
Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano issued the warning on  Tokyo
Electric  as the government prepares to use tax money to aid the
power company. The utility, also known as Tepco, tumbled 5.4
percent after it said one of the reactor cores at its stricken
Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear plant is more seriously damaged than
previously thought.  “If banks write off loans to Tepco, that would cause an
adverse effect on the finance market overall,” said Yoshifumi Kikuchi, head of dealing at Nissan Century Securities Co. in
Tokyo.  The  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average fell 0.7 percent to 9,648.77
at the 3 p.m. close of trading in Tokyo. The broader Topix slid
1.1 percent to 839.94, with almost six times as many shares
declining as advancing.  “People won’t support” using public funds for Tepco
unless banks waive some loans made before the March 11
earthquake and tsunami crippled its Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear
plant, Edano said today in Tokyo. The utility will have to reach
agreement with financial institutions to give up some of their
loans, he said. “It’s not that we’ll intervene in the matter
between private companies, but we will have to decide our
government actions based on that,” Edano said.  Inflation Concerns  Stocks also fell amid concern that  China ’s decision
yesterday to raise reserve ratios for its largest lenders for a
fifth time this year as it fights inflation may slow global
economic growth, dragging down banks and electronics makers the
most in the Topix among its 33 industry groups.  Sony Corp. (6758) , Japan’s No. 1 electronics exporter, slipped 1
percent to 2,241 yen. Murata Manufacturing Co., a maker of
precision electronics that gets more than 80 percent of its
revenue outside of Japan, declined 1.1 percent to 5,430 yen.  “Investors are worried inflation may slow a recovery in
the global economy,” said  Masaru Hamasaki , who helps oversee
about $17 billion as chief strategist at Toyota Asset Management
Co. in Tokyo. “That may cause a slump in global demand,
trimming companies’ earnings outlook”  China’s Decision  China raised banks’ reserve ratios for its largest lenders
by 0.5 percentage point to a record 21 percent to restrain
prices, the People’s Bank of China said on its website yesterday.
The central bank moved after reports showed inflation and
lending exceeded economists’ estimates in April, with consumer
prices rising more than 5 percent for a second month.  Mitsubishi UFJ slumped 2.8 percent to 383 yen and its
closest rival  Sumitomo Mitsui  sank 3.8 percent to 2,452 yen.
They were the most active stocks by value.  Mizuho Financial
Group Inc. (8411) , Japan’s third-biggest publicly traded lender,
slipped 3 percent to 130 yen.  Tokyo Electric lost 5.4 percent to 453 after Junichi Matsumoto, a general manager at the utility, said fuel rods in
the core of the No. 1 reactor at its Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear
plant are fully exposed. Also, a government official yesterday
said Japan will ask Tepco to compensate farmers, foresters and
fishermen for damage incurred following the nuclear accident.  Oil Companies  Drop  The Topix has tumbled 9.8 percent since March 10, the day
before the magnitude-9 earthquake and tsunami devastated Japan’s
northeast coast.  Oil companies had the steepest decline among the Topix’s
industry groups after crude for June delivery dropped as much as
1.1 percent to $97.87 a barrel in electronic trading in New York
earlier today. Crude has since gained.  Inpex Corp. (1605) , the nation’s largest oil explorer, sank 3.9
percent to 541,000 yen and  Japan Petroleum Exploration Co. (1662) , the
No. 2, retreated 4.1 percent to 3,770 yen.  In Japan, this week is the peak for earnings results, with
more than 60 percent of the Topix index’s 1,673 companies
scheduled to report.  Mitsumi Electric Co., an electronic-parts maker, plunged
7.9 percent to 890 yen, the steepest drop in the Nikkei 225,
followed by Taiyo Yuden Co. Mitsumi yesterday said it swung to a
net loss of 3.54 billion yen ($44 million) in the year ended
March 31, from a year-earlier profit.  Taiyo Yuden, a maker of electronic components, slumped 6.8
percent to 1,023 yen after saying its full-year net loss totaled
5.51 billion yen, wider than its forecast for a 2.5 billion yen
loss.  To contact the reporter on this story:
