FedEx Corp. (FDX)  canceled several flights
and delayed deliveries of thousands of packages because hourly
unionized employees in Paris have been walking off the job in a
labor dispute.  “A fluctuating number of our hub employees have staged
work disruptions at our hub in Paris,”  Maury Lane , a spokesman
for  Memphis , Tennessee-based FedEx, said today.  Fewer than five flights were scrubbed and “thousands” of
parcels were slowed because of the walkout, which began May 11,
Lane said. FedEx, the operator of the world’s largest cargo
airline, has 1,800 employees at Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport,
he said, declining to say how many stopped working.  FedEx’s money-back guarantee for late deliveries remains in
place for the affected packages, and the company is tweaking
flight and delivery plans to blunt the effect of the walkouts,
Lane said. The Paris workers are represented by several unions,
and bargaining occurs each May.  “We continue to negotiate and will hopefully resolve the
situation as soon as possible,” Lane said. Most of FedEx’s U.S.
employees aren’t represented by unions.  Agence France-Presse reported the walkouts earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
