Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper will get to appoint new justices to the Supreme Court of
 Canada  with the announcement that two judges on the country’s
highest court are retiring this year.  Justice Ian Binnie and Justice Louise Charron plan to
retire from the nine-member court, Chief Justice Beverley McLachlin said today in a  statement  from Ottawa. Charron steps
down effective Aug. 30 and Binnie at the same time or as soon
after that as his replacement is named.  “The departure of Justices Binnie and Charron will leave an
important void on the Court,” McLachlin said.  The announcement follows the federal election of May 2,
which resulted in a majority government after seven years of
minority administrations.  Harper’s election pledges included a crackdown on drug
offenders, eliminating house arrest for violent criminals, and a
move to tougher and longer sentences.  Binnie, 72, who has a background in litigation and has been
on the  Supreme Court  since January 1998, said “the time has come
to return to Toronto to pick up some of the threads of an
earlier existence.”  Charron, 60, who began her legal career as a prosecuting
Crown attorney, said she has been a judge for 23 years, “and the
seventh anniversary of my appointment to the Court, August 30
next, seems like the perfect time to move on.”  Judges of the Supreme Court are appointed by the federal
cabinet from among superior court judges or lawyers with at
least 10 years of experience.  To contact the reporter for this story:
