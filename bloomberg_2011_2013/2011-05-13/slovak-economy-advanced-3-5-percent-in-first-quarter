The Slovak economy expanded an annual
3.5 percent in the first quarter, the same pace as in the
previous three months, as government’s austerity measures
depressed household spending.  On a quarterly basis, gross domestic product increased a
seasonally adjusted 1 percent from the fourth quarter, the
Bratislava-based Slovak Statistical Office said today. The
result exceeded a median estimate by four economists for a rate
of 3.3 percent.  Slovakia, which adopted the euro in 2009, is relying on
foreign demand for its products, including cars made by
Volkswagen AG’s local units, to drive economic growth. Still,
the expansion has so far failed to bring employment back to the
pre-crisis level. When combined with government austerity
measures aimed at trimming the  budget deficit , household demand
has remained subdued.  The  Finance Ministry  expects the economy to advance 3.4
percent for the whole of 2011, down from 4 percent last year.  The number of jobs in the 5.4 million country rose 2
percent from the first quarter of 2010, compared with a 0.5
percent increase in the previous three month, the office said
today.  The statistics office didn’t publish a breakdown of the GDP
data. It will release detailed figures on June 8.  To contact the reporter on this story:
