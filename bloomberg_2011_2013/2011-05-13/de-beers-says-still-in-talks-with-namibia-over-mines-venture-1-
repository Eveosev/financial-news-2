De Beers , the world’s largest diamond
producer, said talks with Namibia about its mining venture in
the country are yet to be completed, after a newspaper reported
that the African nation will increase its stake.  Namdeb Diamond Corp.  will be dissolved and replaced by a
new 50-50 venture between government and De Beers, the  Namibian
Sun  said, citing a Cabinet document. The state will make a
contribution of 375 million Namibian dollars ($54 million) to
buy 50 percent of De Beers Marine Namibia and receive 260
million Namibian dollars in backdated dividends, it said.  Namdeb is owned equally by De Beers and the government. De
Beers holds 70 percent of De Beers Marine  Namibia  and Namdeb the
balance. Namdeb and De Beers Marine Namibia extract diamonds
mainly from the Atlantic Ocean floor off the coast of the south-
west African country.  Namibia accounted for 5.5 percent of De Beers’ total  2010
output  of 33 million carats, producing 1.47 million carats last
year.  De Beers has held “a long series of negotiations around
the future of our diamond mining interests in Namibia,” it said
in an e-mailed response to questions today. “These are coming
to an end, but we’re not quite there yet.” De Beers may
announce details of the talks “in the very near future,” it
said, without indicating whether the Namibian Sun report was
accurate or not.  Anglo American Plc (AAL)  owns 45 percent of De Beers while the
Oppenheimer family holds 40 percent and Botswana’s government
the rest.  To contact the reporter on this story:
