Botswana’s state-worker strike will
continue for a fifth week after unions and the government failed
to agree a pay deal, said Masego Mogwera, president of the
Botswana Federation of Public Sector Unions.  “We have tried to climb down on our demands but
the government seems not prepared to negotiate,” Mogwera said
today by phone from Gaborone, the capital.  The government kept to its conditional offer of a 5 percent
wage increase while the unions reduced their demand to 13.8
percent from 16 percent, Festina Bakwena, director of the
government’s public service management, said in an e-mailed
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
