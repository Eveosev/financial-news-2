Coca-Cola Hellenic Bottling Co. SA,
the world’s second-biggest Coke drinks bottler, said it got a
500 million-euro ($715 million) revolving credit facility to
refinance debt.  The five-year multi-currency credit line replaces existing
financing for the same amount due to mature in 2012 at “lower
costs,” the Athens-based company said today in a statement.  ING Groep NV (INGA) ,  Societe Generale (GLE)  SA,  Citigroup Inc. (C) ,  Bank of
America Corp. (BAC) ,  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) ,  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) ,
 Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS) , Bank of Ireland Plc,
 Raiffeisen Bank International AG (RBI)  and  Intesa Sanpaolo SpA (ISP) 
arranged the financing.  The company this week posted a first-quarter loss of 8.9
million euros compared with a profit of 25.7 million euros in
the same period a year earlier as commodity prices increased.  To contact the reporter on this story:
