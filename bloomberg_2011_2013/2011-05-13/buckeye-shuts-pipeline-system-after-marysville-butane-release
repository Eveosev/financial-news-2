Buckeye Partners LP (BPL)  shut a pipeline
system after a release yesterday of butane in Marysville,
 Michigan , a  filing with the National Response Center  showed.  An unknown amount was released from a two-inch vent because
of operator error, according to the incident report made around
5 p.m. local time. The emission was secured.  U.S. refineries, producers and transmitters must notify the
response center if they release hazardous substances in excess
of reportable quantities, according to the Comprehensive
Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, commonly
known as Superfund.  Bloomberg News couldnâ€™t immediately verify that the
information in the NRC filing was accurate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
