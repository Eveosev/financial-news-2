Copper rose for the fourth time in
five days as  Europe ’s economy expanded faster than analysts
forecast, enhancing prospects for raw-material demand.  Gross domestic product in the 17-member euro area gained
0.8 percent in the first quarter from the fourth, the European
Union’s statistics office said today. That was the fastest pace
since the second quarter of 2010. Economists forecast 0.6
percent growth, according to a Bloomberg News survey.  “Copper is a global play,” said Walter “Bucky” Hellwig,
who helps manage $17 billion at BB&T Wealth Management in
Birmingham,  Alabama . “As long as there is global growth, demand
will be increasing.”  Copper futures for July delivery increased 1.3 cents, or
0.3 percent, to close at $3.9835 a pound at 1:10 p.m. on the
Comex in  New York . The price rose 0.2 percent this week. The
metal has dropped 14 percent from a record $4.6575 on Feb. 15 on
concern that  China , the world’s biggest user, would seek to damp
its economy to curb inflation.  The worldwide economic recovery “indicates sustainably
high copper demand that cannot even be harmed by China’s
restrictive interest-rate policy or the economic weakness of
certain countries,” Aurubis AG, Europe’s biggest smelter, said
today in a statement.  “The fundamental conditions that suggest a production
deficit, and thus represent the basis for a high price level in
2011, are intact,” Hamburg-based Aurubis said.  On the London Metal Exchange, copper for delivery in three
months climbed $58, or 0.7 percent, to $8,788 a metric ton
($3.99 a pound).  Zinc also rose in  London . Aluminum, lead, nickel and tin
fell.  To contact the reporters on this story:
