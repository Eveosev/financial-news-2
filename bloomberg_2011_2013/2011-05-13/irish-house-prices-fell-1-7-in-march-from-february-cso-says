Irish  home prices  fell 1.7 percent in
March from the previous month as a housing slump persisted, the
 Central Statistics Office  said.  Values declined 11.9 percent from a year earlier and have
dropped almost 40 percent since peaking in 2007, the Cork-based
office said on its website today.  Irish  house prices , which quadrupled in the decade through
2007, have plunged since then as the economy shrank, banks
restricted lending and unemployment soared. While they have
“completed their correction,” the market will still face
“continued sluggishness,”  Standard & Poor’s  said May 4.  Dublin house prices fell by 1.8 percent in March from the
previous month and were 13 percent lower than a year earlier,
the CSO said. In the rest of Ireland, values declined 1.5
percent on the month and 11 percent from the year before.  To contact the reporter on this story:
