South African banks won’t be able to
meet government’s demands that 600,000 homeloans be granted to
people earning between 3,500 rand and 9,000 rand a month over
the next 36 months, Fin24 said, citing the Banking Association
of  South Africa .  There are no houses available in that market segment and
the target has never been discussed with the Banking
Association, the Johannesburg-based website reported, citing
Pierre Venter, general manager for banking and financial
services at the industry body.  South African Human Settlements Minister  Tokyo Sexwale 
announced the directive at a property conference yesterday,
Fin24 said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
