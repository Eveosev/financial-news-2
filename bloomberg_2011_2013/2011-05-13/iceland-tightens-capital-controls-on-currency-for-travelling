Iceland’s government proposed a  bill 
with greater restrictions on its citizens’ access to foreign
currency, demanding proof the money will be used for travelling.  The monthly limit is proposed at 350,000 kronur ($3,049)
for foreign currency purchases, on the condition of presenting
travel documents, according to the bill posted on the Reykjavik-
based parliament’s website. The currency has to be meant for
usage abroad within four weeks and travelers will have to prove
that they are purchasing currency with their own money.  Iceland introduced  capital controls  following the collapse
of its largest lenders in 2008 to limit a sell-off in its
currency. The island has relied on a $4.6 billion bailout led by
the  International Monetary Fund  since then.  To contact the reporter on this story:
