Austria’s economy expanded for a
seventh consecutive quarter after companies exported more goods
and investment rose in the three months ending in March, the
Vienna-based Wifo economic research institute said today.  First-quarter gross domestic product, the value of all
goods and services, grew 1 percent after a 0.9 percent rise in
the previous quarter, according to Wifo. Compared with a year
earlier, the economy expanded 4.2 percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
