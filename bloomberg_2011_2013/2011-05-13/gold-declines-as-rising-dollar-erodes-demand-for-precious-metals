Gold fell in  New York , erasing an
earlier gain, as a stronger dollar eroded the appeal of precious
metals as alternative assets.  The dollar rose as much as 0.9 percent against a basket of
six major currencies, heading for the second straight weekly
gain. International investors view a sovereign default by a
euro-area nation as more likely than not, with more than four-
fifths surveyed by Bloomberg are betting  Greece  will eventually
fail to pay off its debt. Gold reached a record $1,577.40 an
ounce on May 2 and then fell 4.2 percent in the week ended May 6
as investors sold commodities.  “The dollar rallied, and you’re continuing to see
investors unwind that long-commodity, short-dollar trade,” said
Matt Zeman, a strategist at Kingsview Financial in  Chicago .
“Gold is not going to turn until the last trade is flushed
out.”  Gold futures for June delivery fell $15.50, or 1 percent,
to $1,491.30 at 12:47 p.m. on the Comex in New York. Earlier,
the precious metal gained as much as 0.6 percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
