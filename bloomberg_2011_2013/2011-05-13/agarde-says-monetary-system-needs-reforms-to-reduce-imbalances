The global monetary system needs
additional reforms to control capital flows and reduce
imbalances, said French Finance Minister  Christine Lagarde .  Exchange rates, capital movements and liquidity needs
should be addressed in an “at least agreed way and concerted
fashion,” Lagarde said in a pre-recorded message at a
conference in St.Gallen,  Switzerland , today. Measures should not
be taken “in a harsh and unpredictable way by countries that
are suddenly flooded with capital flows or that are suddenly
dried out of such flows simply because capital goes in and out
as a result of circumstances like changes in  interest rates .”  Lagarde added that “we also need to agree on those
financial safety nets that can be used by economies so that they
don’t feel the need to accumulate massive reserves which clearly
caused and participated in the creation of imbalances.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
