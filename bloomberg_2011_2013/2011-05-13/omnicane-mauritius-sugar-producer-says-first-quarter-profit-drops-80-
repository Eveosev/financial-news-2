Omnicane Ltd. (MTMD) , Mauritius’s third-
biggest producer of sugar, said profit fell 80 percent in the
first quarter through March, as net income last year was boosted
by proceeds from the sale of land.  Net income declined to 37.3 million rupees ($1 million)
from 190.4 million rupees, the company said in a  statement  on
the Port Louis-based Stock Exchange of Mauritius’s website
today. Last year, the company’s profit was boosted by 181.3
million rupees from the sale of land, it said. Revenue increased
to 833.3 million rupees from 625.4 million rupees.  “Sugar production will likely be 7 percent lower” in 2011
because of drought, the company said. Refined sugar exports are
expected to increase and the company will open an additional
silo in September.  Omnicane forecasts profit from its energy companies will be
at about the same level as last year.  “Discussions with all stakeholders for the ethanol project
have reached an advanced stage,” it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
