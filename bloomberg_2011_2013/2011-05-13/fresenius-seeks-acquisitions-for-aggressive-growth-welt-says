Fresenius SE (FRE)  will continue to look
for acquisitions to fuel “aggressive growth” and strengthen
all of its four units,  Die Welt  reported, citing an interview
with Chief Executive Officer Ulf Schneider.  There are opportunities for each division of the Bad
Homburg, Germany-based medical equipment and services company to
make smaller and medium-sized acquisitions, and financing isn’t
a problem, the newspaper cited the executive as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
