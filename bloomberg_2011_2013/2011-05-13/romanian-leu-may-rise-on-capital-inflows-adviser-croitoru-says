The Romanian leu will come under
pressure to appreciate as more foreign capital flows into the
country, said Lucian Croitoru, a monetary-policy adviser to
Governor Mugur Isarescu.  “We don’t yet see these high capital inflows but the
probability of them returning is pretty big,” Croitoru said at
a seminar in Bucharest late yesterday. “We’ll have the dilemma
of market interventions, because the more we intervene the
higher the costs.”  The leu has gained 4 percent against the euro this year,
the third-best performance in central and eastern  Europe  after
the Serbian dinar and the Hungarian Forint. It strengthened 0.2
percent to 4.1087 as of 9:30 a.m. in Bucharest. The central bank
is “reluctant” to use the leu as a tool to damp inflation,
Governor Mugur Isarescu said on May 5.  The  Banca Nationala a Romaniei  left the benchmark interest
rate unchanged for the 12th consecutive month on May 3 and
raised the inflation rate forecast for the end of the year to
5.1 percent from 3.6 percent. The inflation rate stood at 8.3
percent in April, the European Union’s highest. The rate will
remain above the central bank target range of 2 percent to 4
percent until next year, the bank said.  The key interest rate may become the main monetary policy
tool again as the bank, which adopted a managed float regime for
the currency in 2004, tries to tame consumer prices boosted by
higher global fuel and food costs, while stemming capital
inflows, Croitoru said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
