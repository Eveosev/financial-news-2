Sugar gained, capping the biggest
weekly gain since January, after output plunged in  Brazil , the
world’s biggest producer and exporter. Coffee and cocoa futures
fell in  New York .  From mid-March to the end of April, sugar output in
Brazil’s Center South fell 69 percent to 795,000 metric tons
from a year earlier, industry group Unica said yesterday.  “The numbers from Unica have raised supply concerns,”
said Bruno Lima, a risk-management consultant at FCStone Group
Inc. in Campinas, Brazil. “Prices will remain firm.”  Raw sugar for July delivery rose 0.12 cent, or 0.6 percent,
to settle at 21.45 cents a pound at 2 p.m. on ICE Futures U.S.
in New York. For the week, the price jumped 4.8 percent, paring
this year’s decline to 33 percent.  In  London , refined-sugar futures for August delivery
climbed 70 cents, or 0.1 percent, to $602.80 a ton on NYSE
Liffe.  Arabica-coffee futures for July delivery fell 5.55 cents,
or 2 percent, to $2.694 a pound in New York, down 6.3 percent in
five days, the biggest weekly slide since June 2009.  In London, robusta-coffee futures for July delivery gained
$16, or 0.6 percent, to $2,527 a ton.  Cocoa futures for July delivery fell $35, or 1.2 percent,
to $3,002 a ton. Cocoa also retreated in London.  To contact the reporters on this story:
