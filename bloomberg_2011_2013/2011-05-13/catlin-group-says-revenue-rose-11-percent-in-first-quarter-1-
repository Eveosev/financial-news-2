Catlin Group Ltd. (CGL) , the third-biggest
Lloyd’s of London insurer by market value, said first-quarter
sales rose 11 percent, helped by its U.S. and Bermuda units.  Gross written premiums climbed to $1.41 billion in the
first three months of the year from $1.27 billion in the same
period in 2010, the Hamilton, Bermuda-based firm said in a
statement today. The insurer’s estimate of $375 million in
losses from catastrophes remain unchanged in the period.  “Catlin is well-positioned to take advantage of
underwriting opportunities as they develop,” Chief Executive
Officer Stephen Catlin said in the statement. The insurer “is
in an excellent position, and we continue to look ahead with
confidence.”  Fellow Lloyd’s insurers  Amlin Plc (AML)  and  Hiscox Ltd. (HSX)  this week
forecast premium rate will increase later in the year after
earthquakes in Japan and New Zealand eroded firms’ natural
catastrophe budgets. Catlin said last month it expected to pay
about $200 million in claims related to the Japanese earthquake
in March. The firm’s pretax profit was $406 million in 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
