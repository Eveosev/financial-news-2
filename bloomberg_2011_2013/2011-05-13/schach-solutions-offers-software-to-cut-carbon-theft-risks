Tschach Solutions GmbH , a supplier of
carbon-market data in Karlsruhe,  Germany , offered software to
help traders cut the risk of buying European Union emission
allowances that have previously been stolen.  The so-called Allocation Identifier product allows the user
to request specific allowances that probably came directly to
the seller from a government, cutting the chance the permits
have been changing hands for a long time, said Ingo Tschach,
joint managing director. “It’s pretty near a guarantee.”  The software uses public data to determine what nations
were allocated certain blocks of allowances, Tschach said today
by telephone. Each allowance in the program, the world’s biggest
greenhouse gas market, has its own serial number.  The bloc is tightening security after computer hackers
improperly transferred about 4 million metric tons of allowances
in the past year valued at 67 million euros ($95 million) at
today’s price on the BlueNext exchange in Paris of 16.65 euros a
ton. Permits have jumped 21 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
