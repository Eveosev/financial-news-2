Rio Tinto Uranium Ltd.’s Managing
Director Clark Beyer comments on uranium prices.  He spoke at a conference in Beijing today.  On current uranium prices:  “Clearly, we need higher prices to stimulate the new
supply that we need to bring into the market. A lot of that
supply will be coming from higher cost and lower grade mines.
We’re $10 to $20 short of where we’re supposed to be; $55 simply
doesn’t get a whole lot of production going.”  On next-generation reactors’ impact on uranium demand:  “They are probably a good 20 to 30 years from any sort of
wider application. It’s just a very long 30 to 50 years to see
some of these major changes in tech. All the plants being built
today have improved safety standards and improved technical
features, but they’re not a dramatic change in the way they
consume uranium and they’re going to run for another 50 years.”  On buying uranium supplies versus mines:  “The market works very effectively in this commodity.
Signing a contract with a long-term reliable supplier is as good
or better than buying equity in a mining project. When you’re
buying an undeveloped resource, you’re buying all that risk that
mining companies are familiar with and maybe utilities or power
companies are not so familiar with.”  --Chua Baizhen and  Wang Ying . Editors: Ryan Woo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
