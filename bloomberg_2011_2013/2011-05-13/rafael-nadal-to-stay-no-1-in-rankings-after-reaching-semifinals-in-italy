Novak Djokovic extended his unbeaten
start to the tennis season to 35 matches, the second-longest
streak in ATP Tour history, with a win against Robin Soderling
in the quarterfinals of the Internazionali BNL d’Italia in Rome.  Djokovic, 23, of Serbia, overcame an early service break in
the first set and cruised to a 6-3, 6-0 victory, winning the
final nine games of the match, which lasted 76 minutes. Earlier
in the day, top-ranked  Rafael Nadal  defeated Marin Cilic of
Croatia 6-1, 6-3 in the quarterfinals to ensure his No. 1
ranking heading into the French Open, the season’s second grand
slam tournament that begins May 22.  Djokovic has won 35 consecutive matches and  six straight 
tournaments to open the 2011 season, second only to four-time
U.S. Open champion John McEnroe, who started 42-0 in 1984. In
this stretch, Djokovic has defeated Nadal three times, including
the Spaniard’s first clay-court loss in almost two years on May
9 in Madrid.  Djokovic has not lost since falling to  Roger Federer  in the
semifinals of the ATP World Tour Finals in November. The record
for consecutive victories is 46, set by Guillermo Vilas of
 Argentina  in 1977.  Nadal’s victory was the 24-year-old’s 30th win in 31 career
matches at the clay-court tournament in Rome, which he’s won
five times. Djokovic could have moved to No. 1 by winning the
tournament and having Nadal lose before the semifinals.  Nadal will play Richard Gasquet of France in the
semifinals, which take place tomorrow. Djokovic will face  Andy Murray  of Britain.  To contact the reporter on this story:
