Norway , the second-biggest exporter
of natural gas, said production of the fuel fell 13 percent in
April from a year earlier, while crude output dropped 5.3
percent.  The country pumped 1.786 million barrels a day of oil from
 1.886 million  while gas output fell to 7.4 billion cubic meters
from 8.5 billion, according to preliminary figures today from
the  Norwegian Petroleum Directorate . Norway produced 311,000
barrels a day of condensate and gas liquids.  The world’s seventh-biggest oil exporter discovered oil 40
years ago and many fields are being depleted. Output peaked in
2000 and is forecast to drop 6 percent this year to about 1.7
million barrels a day, according to a directorate estimate.  “Production from the Njord field was reduced due to
problems with the risers and production from the Alve, Urd and
Visund fields was closed periodically in April due to planned
maintenance,” the directorate said in the statement. “Lower
gas production in April was due to less demand.”  Oil and gas investments in Norway may reach a record 141
billion kroner ($26 billion) this year, up from 125.4 billion
kroner last year, as companies increase spending on platforms to
keep aging fields alive, Norway’s statistics agency said last
month.  Statoil ASA (STL)  expects to boost its investments about 14
percent to about 40 billion kroner this year, it has said.  Following is a table of final data for Norway’s production
in March. All figures are in standard cubic meters of oil
equivalent, where 1 standard cubic meter of oil equivalent
equals 1,000 standard cubic meters of gas. One cubic meter of
oil equals 6.29 barrels.
