The  Chicago Bulls  beat the Atlanta
Hawks 93-73 to advance to the Eastern Conference finals in the
National Basketball Association playoffs for the first time
since 1998.  The Bulls will play the Miami Heat for a place in the NBA
Finals after winning the best-of-seven series by four games to
two.  Michael Jordan , a 14-time All-Star and five-time NBA Most
Valuable Player, led Chicago to six NBA titles from 1990-1998.
Since then, the Bulls have made the playoffs six times,
advancing past the first round twice.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
