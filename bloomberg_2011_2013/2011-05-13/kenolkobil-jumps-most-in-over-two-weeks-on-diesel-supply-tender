KenolKobil Ltd., a Kenyan fuel
retailer with operations in nine African nations, headed for the
biggest gain in more than two weeks after it was awarded a
contract by the East African nation’s Energy Ministry.  The company’s stock jumped 10 cents, or 1.1 percent, to
9.40 shillings as of 11:04 a.m. in Nairobi. A close at that
level would be the largest advance since April 27,  KenolKobil, which has a 25 percent share of the oil market
of East Africa’s biggest economy, will supply  Kenya ’s Energy
Ministry with 36,355 metric tons of diesel, to be delivered
between July 1 and 3, the Nairobi-based company said in an e-
mailed statement yesterday after the close of trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
