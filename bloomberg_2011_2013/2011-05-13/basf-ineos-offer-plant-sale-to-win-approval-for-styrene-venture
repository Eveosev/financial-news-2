BASF SE (BAS) , the worldâ€™s biggest chemical
maker and Ineos AG, the fourth-biggest, offered to sell a plant
in a bid to win regulatory approval for a proposed styrene joint
venture.  The plant is equal to 3 percent or less of total assets of
the proposed venture, or 3 percent of pro forma earnings before
interest, depreciation, taxation or amortization, Ineos said in
an e-mail, without identifying the facility.  The European Commission extended until June 1 its review of
the planned venture, Styrolution Group GmbH, after the remedy
was offered, it said today.  Ineos, based in Rolle,  Switzerland , and Ludwigshafen-based
BASF agreed in November to merge their styrene operations, to
create a plastics company with sales of more than 5 billion
euros ($7.1 billion). Styrolution will incorporate assets making
materials such as polystyrene and styrene monomers, used in
 consumer goods .  To contact the reporter on this story:
