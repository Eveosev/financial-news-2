Ethanol futures advanced a second
day in  Chicago  on concern increased demand for corn will lead to
higher production costs.  The gasoline additive followed corn higher after an
Agriculture Department report showed U.S. corn exporters sold
271,200 metric tons for delivery in the year that starts Sept.
1. Corn prices have dipped 10 percent this month, making the
grain more attractive to exporters. Ethanol is made from corn in
the U.S.  “It’s been so choppy lately,” said Ronnie Virissimo, a
trader at SCB & Associates LLC in Chicago. “We really just
picked up some momentum early in the morning with corn being up.
As things have come down, corn exports have picked up.”  Denatured ethanol for June delivery rose 1.1 cents, or 0.4
percent, to $2.503 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Futures have gained 5.5 percent this year.  In cash market trading ethanol in Chicago decreased 2
cents, or 0.8 percent, to $2.495 a gallon and in the U.S. Gulf
the biofuel slid 1 cent, or 0.4 percent, to $2.75, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol on the West Coast dropped 0.5 cent to $2.70 a
gallon while the fuel was unchanged in  New York  at $2.605.  Corn futures for July delivery gained 1.5 cents to $6.82 a
bushel in Chicago. One bushel makes at least 2.75 gallons of
ethanol.  To contact the reporter on this story:
