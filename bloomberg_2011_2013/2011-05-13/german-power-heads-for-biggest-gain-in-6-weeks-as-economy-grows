German electricity for next-year
delivery headed for its biggest gain in six weeks as the
country’s economy grew more than analysts expected in the first
quarter, signaling higher demand for energy.  Baseload power for 2012 climbed 70 cents, or 1.2 percent,
to 59.10 euros ($83.74) this week, according to broker data
compiled by Bloomberg as of 5:35 p.m. Berlin time. That’s the
most since the week ended April 1. It slipped 10 cents today
after earlier rising as much as 40 cents. Baseload is delivered
around the clock.  Gross domestic product in  Europe ’s biggest economy,
adjusted for seasonal effects, jumped 1.5 percent from the
fourth quarter, the Federal Statistics Office in Wiesbaden said
today. Economists had forecast a growth of 0.9 percent,
according to the median of 30 estimates in a Bloomberg News
survey.  German electricity consumption rose 0.4 percent in the
first quarter, the BDEW utility industry lobby said today in an
e-mailed statement.  RWE AG,  Germany ’s second-biggest power utility, will
probably hedge about 30 percent of its 2013 power in the nine
months through Dec. 31 this year, which is more than last year,
said Tschach Solutions GmbH. The Essen-based utility hedged
about 20 percent of its 2012 power in the same period last year,
Jan Frommeyer, joint managing director of Tschach Solutions,
which supplies data on carbon markets, said yesterday.  Hard coal for next-year delivery to Amsterdam, Rotterdam or
Antwerp slid 0.4 percent $127.50 a metric ton. The fuel
accounted for about a fifth of Germany’s power last year.
Germany also produces electricity from lignite, or brown coal,
nuclear, natural gas, wind and solar plants.  Bloomberg tracks power prices from brokers including  GFI
