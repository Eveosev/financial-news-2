Japan Tobacco Inc. (2914) , the world’s
third-largest publicly traded cigarette maker, rose in Tokyo
trading after the company’s full-year profit beat analyst
estimates because of higher overseas prices.  Japan Tobacco gained 3.3 percent, the most since May 2, to
326,500 yen at the 3 p.m. close on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. The
benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock Average dropped 0.7 percent.  The company, which sells cigarette brands including Winston
and LD, raised prices in markets including Russia and  Turkey 
last fiscal year. Overseas sales of Japan Tobacco’s eight main
brands jumped 2.7 percent, it said yesterday.  Net income rose 4.7 percent to 145 billion yen ($1.8
billion) for the year ended March 31, the Tokyo-based company
said yesterday. That was more than the 128 billion yen average
of three analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg in the past
four weeks. Sales rose 1 percent to 6.19 trillion yen.  Japan ’s record 9-magnitude earthquake in March damaged the
cigarette maker’s factories, forcing it to suspend all domestic
shipments of cigarettes for 12 days through April 10. Japan
Tobacco has resumed deliveries of 25 items and plans to add 11
next month.  The company plans to scrap 23 of its 96 cigarette products,
including Cherry and Camel Mild Box, by early August, Japan
Tobacco said yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
