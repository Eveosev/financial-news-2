UBS AG (UBSN) ,  Switzerland â€™s biggest bank,
hired Gerard Aquilina as vice chairman of its wealth management
business in emerging markets.  Aquilina, 60, joins from  Barclays Plc (BARC) , where he most
recently was vice chairman at the wealth management division,
Zurich-based UBS said in an e-mailed statement today. He starts
on May 18 and will report to Paul Raphael, head of global
emerging markets at the wealth management unit.  UBS aims to attract more assets from clients in emerging
markets, where wealth is growing at higher rates than in
developed countries. The bank managed 139 billion Swiss francs
($157 billion) in assets for customers domiciled in  Latin
America , Middle East,  Africa , central and eastern  Europe  at the
end of March.  To contact the reporter on this story:
