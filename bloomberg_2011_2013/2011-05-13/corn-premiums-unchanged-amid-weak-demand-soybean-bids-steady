Cash premiums for corn shipped in May
to terminals near  New Orleans  were unchanged relative to Chicago
futures on signs of weak export demand and limited supply. The
soybean basis also was steady.  The spot-basis bid, or premium, for corn delivered this
month remained 55 cents to 58 cents a bushel above July futures
on the Chicago Board of Trade, the same as yesterday, U.S.
Department of Agriculture  data  show. The soybean basis was 60
cents to 70 cents a bushel.  “The Gulf basis is probably firm because supplies are
fairly restricted,” said  Dave Marshall , a farm-marketing
adviser for Toay Commodity Futures Group LLC in Nashville,
 Illinois . “Demand hasn’t been all that great lately either, in
terms of export shipments.”  Corn futures for July delivery rose 1.5 cents, or 0.2
percent, to settle at $6.82 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the CBOT.
The commodity has surged 83 percent in the past year.  Soybean futures for July delivery slid 13.25 cents, or 1
percent, to $13.295 a bushel in  Chicago . The oilseed has climbed
38 percent in the past year.  Corn futures fell 0.6 percent this week after losing 9.3
percent last week, the biggest weekly decline since October
2010.  The slump in prices has made producers “reluctant in
trying to sell the reminder of their relatively small amounts of
holdings” left over from last year’s harvest, Marshall said.  The amount of corn inspected for export in week ended May 5
declined 26 percent from a week earlier, the USDA said May 9. In
the four weeks ended May 5, export sales fell 64 percent from a
year earlier, government data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
