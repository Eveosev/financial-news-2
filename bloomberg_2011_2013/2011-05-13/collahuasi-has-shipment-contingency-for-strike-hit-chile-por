Iquique Terminal Internacional, an
operator at northern  Chile ’s Iquique port, and unionized workers
are holding talks to end a strike that started today at the
shipping facility, a government official said.  Forty-eight unionized workers started the strike today
after labor contract talks that started March 25 failed, said
Marcos Gomez, the labor ministry’s representative for the region
of Tarapaca, where the port operates.  Workers are seeking an increase in base salaries and other
benefits, Gomez said by telephone. The Collahuasi copper mine,
the world’s third largest, has a contingency plan for copper
shipments that normally go through the port, the mine’s
spokeswoman, Bernardita Fernandez, said today.  “Port operations are somewhat disrupted,” Gomez said from
the city of Iquique. “We’ve been in meetings with both sides
since yesterday trying to narrow their differences.
Conversations are progressing well.”  Collahuasi, which is owned by  Anglo American Plc (AAL)  and
 Xstrata Plc (XTA) , has agreements to ship through the ports of
Antofagasta, Iquique and Arica while its own port is being
repaired after an accident.  Iquique Terminal Internacional executives didn’t respond to
two telephone requests for comment. The operator’s external
public relations representative didn’t immediately respond to
telephone calls and  text messages  seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
