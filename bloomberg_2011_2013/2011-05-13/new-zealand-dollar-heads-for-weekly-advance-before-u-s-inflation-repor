The Australian dollar slid for a
third straight day against its U.S. counterpart and  New
Zealand ’s currency decreased as global stocks dropped, damping
demand for higher-yielding assets.  The Aussie had a second straight weekly decline against the
greenback as traders bet the nation’s Reserve Bank will delay
interest-rate increases following a report yesterday that showed
employers unexpectedly cut jobs in April.  “The stock market is trading in a heavy fashion, and that
is feeding across to the Aussie,” said  Tim Waterer , a currency
dealer at CMC Markets in Sydney. “While we have uncertainty
about when the RBA is going to move, there’s a tendency for the
Aussie to move to the downside.”  Australia’s dollar fell 1.3 percent to $1.0541 at 12:17
p.m. in  New York , from $1.0678 yesterday, extending its weekly
drop to 1.5 percent. New Zealand’s dollar depreciated 1.4
percent to 78.48 U.S. cents and lost 0.7 percent this week.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index of stocks lost 0.1 percent
today, extending this week’s decline to 1 percent. The Standard
& Poor’s 500 Index dropped 0.9 percent.  Benchmark rates are 4.75 percent in  Australia  and 2.5
percent in New Zealand, compared with as low as zero in the U.S.
and Japan, attracting investors to the South Pacific nations’
higher-yielding assets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
