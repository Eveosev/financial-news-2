Global Investment House of  Kuwait  has
allocated $350 million for additional investment in Turkey after
its private-equity unit acquired stakes in two Turkish
companies,  Sabah  reported, citing Ihsan Sancay, the fund’s
Turkish partner.  Global Investment, whose units bought 80 percent of
 Bicakcilar Tibbi Cihazlar AS , a medical equipment manufacturer,
and a stake in the women’s apparel maker Yargici Konfeksiyon
Ihracat & Ticaret AS this year, plans long-term investment in
Turkey, the Istanbul-based newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
