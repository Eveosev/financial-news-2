Chile ’s peso weakened for a third
straight day as signs that the  U.S. economy  is slowing eroded
demand for riskier, emerging-market assets.  The peso fell 0.5 percent to 473.97 per  U.S. dollar  from
471.44 yesterday. A 1.6 percent drop in the last three days is
the steepest among major Latin America currencies tracked by
Bloomberg.  U.S. housing starts declined unexpectedly in April. The
Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of 19 raw materials dropped
for the third straight session. U.S. stocks fell after Hewlett-
Packard Co. lowered its profit forecast.  “International markets falling explains the fall of the
peso and there is still a lot of demand from institutional
investors,” said Sebastian Momberg, a currency trader at the
brokerage unit of Banco de Credito e Inversiones.  U.S. stocks retreated after the Commerce Department
announced an 11 percent decline in April on new housing starts.
Building permits in the U.S. also decreased, and industrial
production remained unchanged.  Copper for delivery in three months declined 0.5 percent to
$8,799 per metric ton in  London . Chile is the world’s biggest
producer of the metal used in plumbing and wiring.  Chile’s central bank paid an average of 473.68 per dollar
for $50 million today as part of a $12 billion effort to limit
the peso’s gains. The monetary authority sold 39.6 billion pesos
($83.5 million) of five-year bonds at a yield of 6.19 percent
and 22 billion pesos of two-year notes at 6.02 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
