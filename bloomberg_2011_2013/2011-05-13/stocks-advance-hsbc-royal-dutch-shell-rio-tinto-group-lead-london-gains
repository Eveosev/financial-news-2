U.K. stocks retreated as losses in
financial services companies overshadowed gains in  Fresnillo Plc (FRES) 
and Petrofac Ltd.  Barclays Plc (BARC) , the third-biggest U.K. bank, and  Prudential
Plc (PRU) , the country’s biggest insurer by market value, declined.
Fresnillo, the world’s largest primary silver producer, climbed.  The benchmark  FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  dropped 0.3 percent to
5,925.87 at the 4:30 p.m. close in  London , extending this week’s
loss to 0.9 percent. The FTSE All-Share Index fell 0.2 percent
to 3,090.52 today, while Ireland’s ISEQ Index added 0.1 percent
to 3,005.04.  “Until volatility in commodity prices decreases, investors
are unlikely to commit more to equities or to sell defensive
stocks such as pharmaceutical companies,” said Vanni Vecchini,
a London-based sales trader at Louis Capital Markets.  Portugal’s economy shrank for a second quarter in the three
months through March, putting the country back into recession as
the government attempted to cut spending and raises taxes to
narrow its  budget deficit .  International investors view a sovereign default by a euro-
area nation as more likely than not with more than four-fifths
betting Greece will eventually fail to pay off its debt. Eighty-
five percent of those surveyed this week said Greece probably
will default, with majorities predicting the same fate for
Portugal and Ireland, which followed Greece in seeking European
Union-led bailouts, a new Bloomberg Global Poll shows.  Barclays, Prudential  Barclays fell 1.4 percent to 274.3 pence for its second
straight decline. Prudential slid 1.8 percent to 735 pence, its
lowest price since April 19.  Fresnillo rose 1.5 percent to 1,324 pence, after the stock
fell the most in almost two years yesterday.  Petrofac Ltd., the U.K.-based oil and gas engineer,
increased 2.1 percent to 1,479 pence. The company said it has
taken $2 billion in orders this year after winning contracts in
Algeria, Iraq and Malaysia.  GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK) , the drugmaker, added 1.3 percent to
1,348.5 pence, its highest price in more than three years.  London Stock Exchange Group Plc (LSE)  climbed 1 percent to 827.5
pence. The company said full-year profit soared 68 percent as
post-trade and information and technology services revenue
gained and costs declined.  Whitbread Plc (WTB)  surged 2.1 percent to 1,668 pence. “There
still seems to be some momentum left over from analyst comments
yesterday rating the company as a buy,” said  David Jones , chief
market strategist at IG Index in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
