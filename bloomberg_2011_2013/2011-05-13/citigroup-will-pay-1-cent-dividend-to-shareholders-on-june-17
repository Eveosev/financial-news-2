Citigroup Inc. (C) , the third-largest
U.S. bank, will pay a 1-cent per-share dividend on June 17, more
than two years after it canceled the quarterly payout to
conserve cash during the financial crisis.  Citigroup will pay stockholders of record as of May 27, the
New York-based company said today in a statement. Chief
Executive Officer  Vikram Pandit , who canceled the dividend in
February 2009, announced on March 21 that it would be
reinstated.  The bank earlier this month executed a reverse stock split
that was effective May 6, when Citigroup exchanged 1 share for
every 10 of common stock.  To contact the reporter on this story:
