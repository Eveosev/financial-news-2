Former  Dallas Cowboys  running back
Ron Springs died yesterday after a heart attack, the National
Football League team said on its website. He was 54.  Springs, who played for the Cowboys for six seasons, had
been in a coma since going into cardiac arrest during a 2007
operation to remove a cyst from his left elbow. He’s survived by
his wife, Adriane, and his son, Shawn Springs, a former
cornerback for the Seattle Seahawks,  Washington Redskins  and New
England Patriots.  Ron Springs grew up in Williamsburg, Virginia, and played
at Ohio State. After leaving the Cowboys in 1984, he spent two
seasons with the  Tampa Bay Buccaneers . He rushed for 2,519 yards
on 694 carries and scored 28 touchdowns in his career.  “Ron’s life will always be remembered by the joy and
laughter that he brought to others and the courage and toughness
he displayed until the end,” Cowboys owner  Jerry Jones  said on
the team’s website. “Regardless of the circumstances, he always
had a smile for everyone. The Dallas Cowboys have lost a
wonderful member of our family, and we share our thoughts and
prayers with his family.”  The 6-foot, 213-pound Springs had numerous health problems
after his retirement. He was diagnosed with diabetes shortly
after leaving the NFL, and got a kidney transplant from former
Cowboys teammate Everson Walls in 2007. The pair went on to
start the Ron Springs & Everson Walls Gift for Life Foundation
to publicize the need for transplant volunteers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
