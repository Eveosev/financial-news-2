Oil options volatility fell as the
underlying futures advanced after U.S. equities tumbled, making
commodities more attractive to investors.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
July, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 36.8 percent as of 2 p.m. in  New York ,
down from 38.6 percent yesterday.  Crude oil for June delivery rose 68 cents to settle at
$99.65 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , closing
below $100 for a third-straight session. Prices advanced 2.5
percent this week compared with a loss of 15 percent in the week
ended May 6.  The most active contracts in electronic trading today were
June $140 calls, with 3,855 lots changing hands. They fell 2
cent to 9 cents a barrel at 3:37 p.m. in New York. June $95
puts, the next-most active option, dropped 359 cents to 30 cents
a barrel with 3,249 lots trading. One contract covers 1,000
barrels of crude.  Nymex distributes real-time data for electronic trading and
releases information on floor trading, where the bulk of options
trading occurs, the next business day.  June $90 puts were the most active options traded in the
previous session, with 15,896 lots changing hands. They fell 23
cents to 18 cents a barrel. The next-most active option, June
$95 puts, fell 58 cents to 65 cents a barrel on 14,509 lots.  Open interest was highest for December 2012 $80 puts with
46,061 contracts. Next were June 2011 $150 calls with 44,097 and
December 2011 $120 calls with 41,332 contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
