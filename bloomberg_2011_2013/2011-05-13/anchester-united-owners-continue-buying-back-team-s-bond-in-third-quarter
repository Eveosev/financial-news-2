Manchester United  bought 5.5 million
pounds ($8.9 million) of its own bonds and reported a 1 percent
increase in sales for the third quarter, according to results
published today by the 18-time English champion.  United, which needs a point from its remaining two matches
to secure a record 19th league crown, is going for a fourth
Champions League title when it meets Barcelona in the May 28
final.  United had spent 25 million pounds on buying back the
dollar and sterling denominated notes in the second quarter. The
club’s owners, the Florida-based Glazer family, replaced a 500
million pound banking facility with the bond last year.  The team’s 250 million pounds of 8.75 percent bonds due
2017 were little changed at 108.1 pence in the pound, according
to Bloomberg Bond Trader. United, which also has $425 million of
8.37 percent notes, has 477.7 million pounds in gross debt and
retains 113 million pounds in cash.  Sales for the three months ended March 31 rose to 75.2
million pounds from 74.6 million pounds in the year-earlier
period. Much of the growth comes from the club’s commercial
operation, which has surged 29 percent in the past year. Match-
day income slipped 9 percent to 29.1 million in the past quarter
because of fewer games.  United has won three league titles and the 2008 Champions
League since the Glazers, who also own the NFL’s Tampa Bay
Buccaneers, bought the team for 790 million pounds in 2005.
Forbes Magazine estimated its market value at $1.8 billion.
