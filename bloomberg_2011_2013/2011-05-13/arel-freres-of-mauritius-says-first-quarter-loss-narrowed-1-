Harel Freres Ltd. (HFRERES) , Mauritius’s
largest producer of specialty sugars, said its first-quarter
loss narrowed from the year earlier on higher sugar prices.  The company posted a net loss of 52.1 million Mauritian
rupees ($1.9 million), compared with 72.5 million rupees a year
earlier, it said in a statement on the website of the Port
Louis-based Stock Exchange of Mauritius today. Revenue rose to
674.6 million rupees from 638.7 million rupees.  The after-tax loss in the sugar segment narrowed to 89
million rupees from 122 million rupees because of increased
prices for the 2011 crop, Harel Freres said.  Net income in the company’s electricity production unit
slid to 15 million rupees from 38.7 million rupees.  To contact the reporter on this story:
