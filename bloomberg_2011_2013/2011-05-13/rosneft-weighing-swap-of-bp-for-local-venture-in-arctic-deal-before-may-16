OAO Rosneft, Russia’s largest oil
producer, is still weighing a proposal to replace  BP Plc (BP/)  with
the U.K. company’s local venture in an Arctic exploration deal
as a May 16 deadline on a related share swap looms.  “The company will make a decision that best meets its
shareholders’ interests,” Rustam Kazharov, a spokesman for the
Moscow-based Rosneft, said by phone today. “The company wants
to take a very balanced approach to making a decision.”  He declined to give a timeframe on a decision.  BP’s billionaire partners in the TNK-BP oil producer won an
injunction in February on the Rosneft alliance, saying their
shareholder agreement gives the venture exclusive rights to
pursue opportunities for BP in Russia. BP and its partners each
own half of TNK-BP,  Russia ’s third-biggest producer, which
accounts for about a quarter of BP’s output and a fifth of
reserves.  According to a May 6 arbitration decision, BP gained the
right to swap 5 percent of its shares for about 9.5 percent of
Rosneft, Russia’s largest oil producer, as long as Rosneft
agrees to take on TNK-BP as its partner for Kara Sea
exploration.  To contact the reporter on this story:
