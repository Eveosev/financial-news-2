U.S. stock futures fell, signaling
the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index may extend its two-week retreat,
as Greece prepared to ask for an increased bailout amid renewed
sovereign debt concerns in  Europe .  Alcoa Inc. (AA) , the largest U.S. aluminum producer, and
ConocoPhillips, the nation’s third-biggest oil company, dropped
in German trading as crude and metal prices declined.  Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  and  Citigroup Inc. (C)  led a retreat in banks.  S&P 500  futures expiring in June lost 0.5 percent to
1,327.6 at 10:49 a.m. in  London . Dow Jones Industrial Average
futures fell 0.5 percent to 12,501 and Nasdaq-100 Index futures
slipped 0.2 percent 2,364.25.  “Markets are concerned by the loss of economic momentum
and the resurgence of risk in the euro zone,” said  Mike Lenhoff , chief strategist at Brewin Dolphin Securities Ltd. in
London. “It is a market that has good fundamental support in
the background, but what’s lacking right now is some stronger
lead that will take the market upward.”  Greece  will plead for a boost in its 110 billion-euro ($155
billion) bailout from European governments and the  International
Monetary Fund  today in talks clouded by the arrest of IMF
Managing Director Dominique Strauss-Kahn. Also on the agenda in
Brussels is the approval of 78 billion euros in Portuguese aid.  Strauss-Kahn Charges  Strauss-Kahn, 62, is awaiting his first court appearance on
attempted rape charges after an alleged attack on a 32-year-old
female maid at a Sofitel hotel in midtown  Manhattan  occurred May
14, according to the  New York  Police Department. He has denied
the charges and will plead not guilty, his lawyer Benjamin Brafman said.  The S&P 500 has lost 1.9 percent so far this month, led by
commodity producers, after inflation reports spurred speculation
global  interest rates  will rise. The gauge has still climbed 6.4
percent this year as government stimulus measures and corporate
earnings boosted confidence in the economic recovery.  Alcoa lost 1.5 percent to $16.85 in  Germany  while
 ConocoPhillips (COP)  slipped 0.5 percent to $71.07.  Copper fell as much as 0.8 percent in London and crude oil
dropped below $98 a barrel in New York as funds cut their bets
on higher commodity prices by 15 percent on mounting concern
that global growth is slowing.  The funds held a net 1.23 million contracts across 18 U.S.
commodity futures as of May 10, the lowest since July, data from
the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission show. The net-long
position in crude oil slumped 13 percent in a week, while for
copper it fell 59 percent and in silver 23 percent.  Goldman Sachs lost 0.7 percent to $140.49 in Germany, while
Citigroup fell 1.1 percent to $41.08.  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  slid
0.6 percent to $42.91.  To contact the reporter on this story:
