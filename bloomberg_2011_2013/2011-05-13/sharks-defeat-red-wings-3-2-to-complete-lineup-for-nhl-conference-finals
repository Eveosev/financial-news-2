The San Jose Sharks beat the Detroit
Red Wings 3-2 in a deciding seventh game to complete the lineup
of the National Hockey League conference finals.  The Sharks will play the  Vancouver Canucks  for a place in
the Stanley Cup finals against the Tampa Bay Lightning or the
Boston Bruins.  The Sharks have never reached the Stanley Cup finals,
having lost in the Western Conference finals twice, last year
and in 2004.  Detroit was seeking to become the fourth team in NHL
playoff history to rally from a 3-0 deficit and win a seven-game
series. The Philadelphia Flyers achieved the feat last year, 35
years after the New York Islanders and 68 years after the
 Toronto Maple Leafs .  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
