Auctioneers were “astonished” when
a pair of 19th century Chinese teapots owned by a Scottish
family for more than half-a-century sold for 1.3 million pounds
($2.1 million) in  London  yesterday, the Herald reported.  The rare set of famille rose “melon” teapots, marked with
the distinctive iron-red seal of the Imperial Qianlong dynasty,
were auctioned at the Bonhams Fine Chinese Art sale, said the
Glasgow-based newspaper.  Gordon McFarlan, Bonhams’ director in Glasgow, found the
teapots by chance when he was asked by his client to pick up
other items from her home in central  Scotland , the newspaper
reported.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
