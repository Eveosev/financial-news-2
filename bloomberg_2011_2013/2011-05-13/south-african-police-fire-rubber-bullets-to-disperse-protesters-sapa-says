South African police used rubber
bullets to disperse about 200 protesters in Ficksburg, in the
countryâ€™s central Free State province, after they burnt tires,
barricaded roads and threw stones at police, the South African
Press Association reported.  Police also used stun grenades and teargas against the
crowd, which is calling for the mayor to be suspended because of
alleged corruption, the  news agency  said. Eight police officers
are currently facing charges related to the death of a
protester, Andries Tatane, in Ficksburg last month, SAPA said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
