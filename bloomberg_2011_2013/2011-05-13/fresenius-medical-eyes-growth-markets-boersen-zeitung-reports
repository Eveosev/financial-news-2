Fresenius Medical Care AG, the
world’s biggest provider of  kidney dialysis , wants to expand in
eastern  Europe  and  Asia ,  Boersen-Zeitung  reported, citing an
interview with Chief Financial Officer Michael Brosnan.  While the company might acquire “packages of dialysis
centers” in eastern Europe, it would rather build its own
capacities in Asia, Brosnan told the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
