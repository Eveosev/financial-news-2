Asian currencies completed a weekly
loss, led by South  Korea ’s won and India’s rupee, as concern
Europe’s debt crisis will worsen bolstered demand for dollars.  The won dropped to a three-week low after Bank of Korea
unexpectedly left  interest rates  unchanged yesterday. The yuan
had its sharpest weekly decline in two months as China raised
lenders’ reserve-requirement ratios for the fifth time this year
and government data showed industrial output moderated in April.
The MSCI Asia Pacific Index of regional stocks dropped for the
week on concern global economic growth will slow.  “This week there was a commodity sell-off and concern on
Greece’s debt crisis,” said Joanna Tan, a Singapore-based
regional economist at Forecast Singapore Pte. “The underlying
sentiment in Asian currencies is caution with  Europe ’s problems
still ongoing and worries about commodities.”  The won declined 0.2 percent for the week to 1,086.45 per
dollar as of the 3 p.m. close in Seoul yesterday, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The rupee fell 0.2 percent to
44.8675, Singapore’s dollar dropped 0.4 percent to S$1.2399 and
the yuan retreated 0.08 percent to 6.4982.  Euro-region finance ministers will meet next week to
discuss more support for Greece, Luxembourg’s  Jean-Claude Juncker , who leads the group, said May 12. The nation has
already been granted a 110 billion-euro ($158 billion) bailout,
while Ireland and Portugal have also received financial aid from
the European Union.  Greek Risk Remains  “The  Greece  situation remains a big risk in the
background,” said Nik M. Khairul, a treasury dealer at Asian
Finance Bank Bhd. in  Kuala Lumpur . “Commodity prices and
China’s economic activity are pointing down, which creates
question marks on future rate increases in Asia.”  The Bank of Korea kept its seven-day repurchase rate at 3
percent, a move predicted by two of 14 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg. Twelve forecast a quarter of a percentage point rise
to curb inflation. Bank Indonesia kept its benchmark rate at
6.75 percent May 12, a decision predicted by all 10 economists
in a Bloomberg survey.  “Expectations for a rate increase had been limiting
declines in the won this week,” said Yun Se Min, a currency
dealer at Busan Bank in  Seoul . The currency closed 0.7 percent
stronger yesterday after earlier gaining as much as 10.5 percent.  Thailand’s baht rose 0.1 percent this week and 0.4 percent
yesterday. The currency rebounded from its biggest one-day
decline in four months on May 12 after Fitch Ratings raised the
outlook on Thailand’s local-currency credit rating to stable
from negative, citing an earlier-than-expected stabilization of
the nation’s finances.  Elsewhere, the  Philippine peso  declined 0.2 percent this
week to 43.22 per dollar. Taiwan’s dollar gained 0.5 percent to
NT$28.635 and Malaysia’s ringgit fell 0.2 percent to 3.0090.
Indonesia’s rupiah gained 0.3 percent to 8,553, while Vietnam’s
dong was little changed at 20,570.  To contact the reporter on this story:
