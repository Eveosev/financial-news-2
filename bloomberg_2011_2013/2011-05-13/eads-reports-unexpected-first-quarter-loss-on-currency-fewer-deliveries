European Aeronautic, Defence & Space
Co. reported a surprise first-quarter loss after its Airbus SAS
commercial plane unit delivered fewer jets, research costs rose,
and it suffered the impact of unfavorable currency hedges.  The net loss was 12 million euros ($17 million) compared
with a year-earlier profit of 103 million euros, the Paris-and
Munich-based company said today in a statement. Analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg had predicted net income of 28.8 million
euros. Sales rose 10 percent to 9.9 billion euros.  The company reiterated a goal to lift jet deliveries in
2011 to as many as 530 planes from 508 a year earlier, and
Airbus is considering to increase production of its A320 single-
aisle aircraft as airlines expand their fleets. EADS cautioned
that its new A350 program remains “challenging.”  “While advancing with the A350 XWB through achieving
several critical milestones, this decisive program continues to
require our closest attention,” EADS CEO Louis Gallois said in
the statement.  Earnings before interest and taxes and exceptional items
rose to 230 million euros from 150 million euros a year ago.
EADS confirmed is 2011 guidance for higher revenue than in 2010,
with Ebit before special items to remain in line with the 2010
level of 1.3 billion euros.  Falling Deliveries  First quarter deliveries fell to 119 planes from 122.
Company-financed research and development costs rose to 650
million euros from 572 million euros a year earlier as Airbus
began producing the first pieces of the twin-jet, long-range
A350 ahead of the final assembly of the first planes, slated for
the end of 2011.  The manufacturer has pushed back the planned first
delivery, to Qatar Airways Ltd., by several months to late 2013.  The A350 will compete with  Boeing Co. (BA) ’s 777, operating
since 1995, and the U.S. company’s smaller 787 model, which is
running 3 1/2 years behind schedule. Boeing is aiming for the
first deliveries in September of this year.  Earnings were hurt by foreign-exchange costs because of
less favorable hedges based on rates locked in before the recent
rebound in the dollar, the currency of passenger jet sales. The
stronger dollar will begin to benefit the company in 2012, EADS
has said.  EADS’s biggest shareholders include carmaker  Daimler AG (DAI) ,
the French state and  Lagardere SCA. (MMB)  Over the years, Lagardere
has whittled its holdings down to 7.5 percent, and Daimler has
placed a 7.5 percent EADS stake with a group of German banks and
states, while keeping voting control of those shares for a total
22.5 percent stake in EADS. The French state still owns 15
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
