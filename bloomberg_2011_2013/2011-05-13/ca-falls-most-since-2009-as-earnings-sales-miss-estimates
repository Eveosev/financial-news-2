CA Inc. (CA) , the second-largest maker of
software for  mainframe computers , fell the most in almost 19
months in New York trading after reporting fiscal fourth-quarter
earnings that missed analysts’ estimates.  Profit excluding some items for the quarter ended in March
rose to 48 cents a share from 37 cents a year earlier, the
Islandia, New York-based company said yesterday in a statement.
Analysts were looking for 50 cents, the average of nine
estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Sales climbed 5 percent to $1.13 billion, missing analysts’
average estimate of $1.17 billion, as demand for mainframe
products fell. The company said it agreed to sell its Internet
security business, which includes anti-malware and anti-virus
software, to Updata Partners.  CA fell $2.29, or 9.1 percent, to $22.77 at 10:31 a.m. in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading. Earlier, the shares
fell to $22.32 for the steepest intraday percentage drop since
October 2009. The shares had gained 2.5 percent this year before
today.  Nancy Cooper, who’s served as chief financial officer since
2006, will retire, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
