Airbus SAS is poised to further lift
production of its bestselling A320 jet series as airlines seek
more fuel-efficient planes to cope with rising oil prices,
helping the manufacturer fund construction of larger aircraft.  Airbus, the largest commercial aircraft maker, is moving
toward 40 single-aisle planes each month by next year from 36
now, and a decision on another hike will come within days, said
Hans Peter Ring, chief financial officer of Airbus parent
European Aeronautic, Defence & Space Co.  “Any production increases on the A320 would be good news,
as that brings in more cash,” said  Yan Derocles , an analyst at
Paris-based Oddo Securities, who has a ”buy” rating on EADS.  The A320 and  Boeing Co. (BA) ’s competing 737 are the workhorses
of the  airline industry . The A320 is the main generator of
revenue at Airbus, helping finance the new A350 widebody model.
Production could be ramped up to as many as 44 planes, Ring
said. A move to 44 would boost earnings by 300 million euros
($428 million), Derocles said.  “We need to move carefully,” Ring told reporters on a
call. “What makes it so difficult to take the decision is
clearly we need to deliver on this ramp-up, which is
challenging, and we’re depending on our supply chain.”  EADS rose as much as 1.18 euros, or 5.4 percent, to 22.99
euros in Paris, the most in four months. The stock traded at
22.81 euros as of 12:46 p.m. in Paris, the highest since the end
of 2007. The shares have gained 30 percent this year, compared
with a 22 percent increase in the price of Boeing stock.  Production Race  Both Airbus and Boeing have been ramping up production of
their twin-engine, single-aisle models as airlines and leasing
companies renew efforts to refresh fleets. Output at Boeing,
based in  Chicago , is now at 31.5 a month for its 737, rising in
two steps to 38 by 2013, and as high as 42 later on.  Airbus, at a monthly rate of 36 since December, will reach
38 by August before moving to 40 in the first quarter of 2012.  Putting more brand-new planes into the market could have a
knock-on effect on pricing, given that more relatively-new
planes might move into the used market, effectively competing
with new production, analysts said.  “It’s certainly is an area of risk,” said  Chris Tarry , an
independent analyst in  London  who has followed the industry for
almost 30 years. “What happens in the second market is going to
have an impact on the primary market.”  Cash Generation  For Airbus, more planes means more cash at a time when the
development costs of the A350 are draining profit. The Paris-
and Munich-based company today reported a surprise first-quarter
loss and cautioned that the A350 program remains challenging.
EADS plans to start assembling the jet by the end of 2011 and
have it in service two years later.  The net loss was 12 million euros compared with a year-
earlier profit of 103 million euros, with results weighed down
by Airbus delivering fewer jets and unfavorable currency hedges.
Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg had predicted net income of 28.8
million euros. Sales rose 10 percent to 9.9 billion euros.  First-quarter deliveries fell to 119 planes from 122.
Company-financed research and development costs rose to 650
million euros from 572 million euros a year earlier as Airbus
began producing the first pieces of the long-range A350.  “While advancing with the A350 XWB through achieving
several critical milestones, this decisive program continues to
require our closest attention,” EADS Chief Executive Officer
 Louis Gallois  said in the statement.  The manufacturer has pushed back the planned first
delivery, to Qatar Airways Ltd., by several months to late 2013.  A380 Target  The A350 will compete with Boeing’s 777, operating since
1995, and the U.S. company’s smaller 787 model, which is running
3 1/2 years behind schedule. Boeing is aiming for the first
deliveries in September of this year.  Airbus is still targeting A380 superjumbo deliveries “in
the mid-20s” and reaching 20 is a certainty, Ring said. New
aircraft delivered today are achieving a 98 percent dispatch
reliability rate, he said.  EADS’s biggest shareholders include carmaker  Daimler AG (DAI) ,
the French state and  Lagardere SCA. (MMB)  Over the years, Lagardere
has whittled its holdings down to 7.5 percent, and Daimler has
placed a 7.5 percent EADS stake with a group of German banks and
states, while keeping voting control of those shares for a total
22.5 percent stake in EADS. The French state still owns 15
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
