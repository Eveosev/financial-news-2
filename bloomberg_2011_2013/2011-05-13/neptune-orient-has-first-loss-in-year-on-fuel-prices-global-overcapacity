Neptune Orient Lines Ltd.,  Southeast
Asia ’s biggest container-shipping line, posted its first
quarterly loss in a year as rising fuel prices and global
overcapacity offset increasing demand.  The company made a $9.7 million loss in the three months
ended April 8 compared with a $98.5 million loss a year earlier,
it said in a statement to the Singapore stock exchange today.
Sales rose 16 percent to $2.44 billion.  Average revenue per box rose 3 percent in the period,
trailing a 28 percent jump in fuel prices, as the introduction
of more ships on Asia-Europe routes sapped rates. China Cosco
Holdings Co. also reported a loss in the first quarter, while
Evergreen Marine Corp. had its smallest profit in a year.  “Too much new capacity has entered the market this year,”
said Jee Heon Seok, an analyst at NH Investment & Securities Co.
in  Seoul . “It should get better as we go into the peak season
in the third quarter and fewer new ships enter service.”  APL Ltd. , Neptune Orient’s container-shipping unit, boosted
volumes 9 percent to 764,000 40-foot equivalent containers in
the reporting period, according to the statement. Average
revenue per box was $2,598. The unit’s sales rose 15 percent to
$2.1 billion. Sales at Singapore-based Neptune Orient’s
logistics business jumped 24 percent to $368 million.  “A softer than expected Lunar New Year period and rising
fuel costs have interrupted our momentum,” Chief Executive
Officer Ron Widdows said in the statement.  New CEO  Widdows will step down at the end of the year and be
succeeded by Ng Yat Chung, a former  Singapore  army chief and
manager at Temasek Holdings Pte., Neptune Orient’s controlling
shareholder. Widdows will stay at the company as a senior
adviser.  The shipping line closed unchanged at S$1.90 in Singapore
today before the earnings announcement. It has fallen 13 percent
this year, the third-worst performance amongst the 30 stocks in
the city-state’s benchmark Straits Times Index.  “Increased operating costs -- particularly related to fuel
cost increases -- and competitive pressure on rates are expected
to continue for the near term,” the company said. “Should
these conditions persist, our results will be negatively
impacted.”  The price of 380 Centistoke marine bunker fuel, used by
ships, averaged $600.02 per metric ton in the first quarter in
Singapore trading compared with $469.19 a year earlier,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It rose 2.4 percent to
$642.50 today.  Container rates will likely increase this quarter and into
the second half as some lines “definitely” need higher fees,
A.P. Moeller-Maersk A/S Chief Executive Officer Nils Smedegaard Andersen said this week. Maersk, owner of the world’s biggest
container shipping line, boosted first-quarter profit 85 percent.  APL operated 147 vessels with a combined capacity of
593,542 20-foot boxes as of March 6, according to Neptune
Orient’s  website . It is scheduled to receive 10 ships next year,
10 in 2013 and two in 2014. It placed orders for 12 ships able
to carry 105,400 20-foot containers last year. The vessels will
cost about $1.2 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
