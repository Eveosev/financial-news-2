Uganda journalists decided to boycott
press conferences held by the police and army after security
forces beat reporters who were covering the return of opposition
leader  Kizza Besigye  from Kenya.  The ban will be in force until the government apologizes
and returns confiscated cameras and pays the medical bills of
injured journalists, Kenneth Lukwago, secretary for the Uganda
Human Rights Network for journalists, told a press conference in
the capital, Kampala.  At least 39 people were injured in yesterdayâ€™s clashes
between demonstrators and police along a main road between
Entebbe airport and Kampala, said Catherine Ntabadde,
spokeswoman for the  Red Cross . Two of those injured were shot,
she said by phone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
