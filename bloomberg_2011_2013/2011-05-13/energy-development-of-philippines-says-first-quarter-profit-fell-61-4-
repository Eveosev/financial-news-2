Energy Development Corp. (EDC) , the
 Philippines ’ largest geothermal company, said first-quarter net
income fell 61.4 percent to 1.45 billion pesos ($34 million) due
to lower steam sales.  The income is “generally in line with our expectation for
revenues to decline in the interim mainly due to foregone steam
sales of our Bacman Project,” the company said in a statement
sent to the stock exchange today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
