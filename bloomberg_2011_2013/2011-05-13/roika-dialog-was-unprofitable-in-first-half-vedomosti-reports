Troika Dialog, a Russian investment
bank, was unprofitable in the six months to end-March,  Vedomosti 
reported today, citing an unidentified person close to the
matter.  Chairman Ruben Vardanian refrained from giving figures,
according to the report. Market volatility and Troikaâ€™s
forthcoming merger with Sberbank, which distracted employees,
were among the reasons for the poor performance, the newspaper
cited Vardanian as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
