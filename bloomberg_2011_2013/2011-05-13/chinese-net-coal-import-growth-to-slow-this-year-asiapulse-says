Chinaâ€™s net coal imports will grow
more slowly this year than in 2010 on rising international
costs, AsiaPulse News reported, citing Xu Xu, chairman of the
China Chamber of Commerce of Metals Minerals and Chemicals
Importers and Exporters.  The country imported a record 166 million metric tons of
coal in 2010, up 31.3 percent over the prior year, it said,
adding exports fell 15 percent to 19 million tons.  In the first quarter of 2011 imports fell 27 percent year-
on-year to 32.4 million tons and exports were up 1.4 percent at
5.8 million tons, it said. Average import prices have risen to
$113.70 a ton in the first quarter from $102.40 a ton last year,
the report said.  Tighter coal supplies due to the Australian flood and
demand from  Japan  and emerging countries may increase
international prices, slowing Chinese imports and boosting its
exports, AsiaPulse said, citing Xu.  To contact the reporter on this story:
