India  may sign an agreement with
 Senegal ’s Agricultural Ministry to develop 150,000 hectares
(370,658 acres) of farmland, the government said.  The land will be used to grow and process rice, corn,
peanuts, cotton and cereals, the Communications Ministry said in
an e-mailed statement yesterday in Dakar, the capital. The area
will be equipped with irrigation pumps and machinery including
tractors, the statement said, without providing further details.  Senegal, a food-importing country the size of  Nebraska , is
in its fourth year of President Abdoulaye Wade’s Grand National
Agricultural Offensive, a campaign to reduce its dependence on
food imports by boosting annual output of staple foods including
rice and millet.  The Agricultural Ministry also plans to raise production of
potatoes, wheat and hibiscus tea in 2011, according to the
statement. The West African nation is expected to produce 50
tons of tomatoes this year, a 43 percent increase from the
previous year, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
