United Co. Rusal declined in Moscow
trading after MSCI Inc. said yesterday the aluminum company’s
Russian Depositary Receipts are not eligible for inclusion in
its semi-annual index review.  The stock of the world’s biggest aluminum producer fell 1.5
percent to 408.75 rubles by the 6:45 p.m. close in Moscow, its
biggest drop in more than a week on the Micex Exchange. The
RDR’s, the first of their kind, slid 1.2 percent to $14.60 on
the dollar-denominated RTS Stock Exchange in the Russian
capital. The Hong Kong-listed shares lost 0.7 percent to
HK$11.52.  The RDRs will not be eligible for inclusion in the current
review of the MSCI Russia Index, expected to be announced on May
16, MSCI said. However, MSCI said it is seeking feedback from
the investment community on “potential eligibility,” according
to the e-mailed statement.  “There may be some disappointed at MSCI’s confirmation
that UC Rusal will not be included in the upcoming semi-annual
review,” UniCredit SpA wrote in a research report today.  The securities allow investors in Moscow to trade the
foreign shares of Rusal, which raised $2.24 billion from a Hong
Kong stock offering in January last year. Rusal wanted to get
the RDRs included in the MSCI Russia Index as listing of shares
in benchmark indexes often boosts their prices because some
investment funds are obliged by their own terms to purchase
certain types of stocks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
