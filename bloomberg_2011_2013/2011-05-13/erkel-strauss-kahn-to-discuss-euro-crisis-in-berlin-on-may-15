German  Chancellor Angela Merkel  will
discuss the Greek crisis and the situation in Ireland and
Portugal with the head of the  International Monetary Fund  on May
15, as officials aim to stem euro-region debt concerns.  IMF Managing Director Dominique Strauss-Kahn will be in
Berlin for talks on the euro region and the Group of Eight
summit in Deauville, France, on May 26-27, German government
spokesman Steffen Seibert told reporters today. Merkel is
awaiting a quarterly audit on Greece by the IMF and European
officials as the government in Athens struggles to adhere to a
savings plan.  The audit “will deliver the facts,” Seibert said, adding
that the talks will be an “exchange of views” on an informal
basis. “But of course it’s quite clear that Greece, Portugal
and Ireland will be among the topics in the talks with Mr.
Strauss-Kahn.”  The euro has lost 3.7 percent against the  U.S. dollar  this
month, buffeted by investor concern that Greece may not be able
to meet its debt obligations as European officials begin to
discuss possible additional measures.  Merkel also met this week with European Commission
President  Jose Barroso  and EU President Herman Van Rompuy. The
Greek audit is due in “early to mid-June,” German Finance
Ministry spokesman Martin Kotthaus said today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
