German stocks fell for a third day,
the longest downward slide in two months, as losses by

forecast increase in first-quarter economic growth.  Commerzbank,  Germany ’s second-biggest bank, fell 3.3
percent. Allianz,  Europe ’s largest insurer, lost 2 percent to
98.20 euros.  ThyssenKrupp AG (TKA) , the nation’s biggest steelmaker

7,403.31 at the 5:30 p.m. close in  Frankfurt , extending this
week’s decline to 1.2 percent. The broader  HDAX Index (HDAX)  lost 0.4
percent today.  Germany’s gross domestic product in the first quarter,
adjusted for seasonal effects, jumped 1.5 percent from the

biggest lender,  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) , fell 1.4 percent to 42.25
euros. Allianz declined 2 percent to 98.20 euros.  ThyssenKrupp rose 2.8 percent to 33.65 euros. Fiscal
second-quarter earnings before interest and taxes jumped 70

million euros ($708 million) in the three months through March,
the Essen-based company said. That beat the 467.8 million-euro
