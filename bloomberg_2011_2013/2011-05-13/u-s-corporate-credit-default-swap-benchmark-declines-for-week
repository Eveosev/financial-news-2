The cost of protecting U.S. corporate
bonds from default declined this week as volatility in stocks
and commodities bypassed debt markets.  The Markit CDX North America Investment Grade Index, which
investors use to hedge against losses on corporate debt or to
speculate on creditworthiness, rose one basis point to a mid-
price of 89.5 basis points as of 5:07 p.m. in New York,
according to index administrator Markit Group Ltd.  The default swaps benchmark, which typically falls as
investor confidence improves and rises as it deteriorates,
declined 0.9 basis point this week. The gauge moved less than a
basis point on three of the days, even as crude oil for June
delivery vacillated by $7.42 a barrel to a high of $104.60 on
May 11 in New York Mercantile Exchange trading.  “Credit remained steady through a second week of
heightened volatility in commodities and equities,” Barclays
Capital analysts Jeffrey Meli and Bradley Rogoff wrote in a note
titled “Unmoved.”  Credit swaps rose today as stocks fell and amid concern
that  Europe ’s debt crisis will worsen. The Standard & Poor’s 500
Index declined 0.8 percent to 1,337.77, down 0.2 percent for the
week, and crude oil climbed for a second day to $99.65 a barrel.  The credit swaps index has ranged this month from 88.5 on
May 2 to 90.5 on May 5.  “You need to have some big exogenous event to occur that’s
not already anticipated by the market for that to come out of
its range,” said Bonnie Baha, head of the global developed
credit group at DoubleLine Capital LP in  Los Angeles , which has
$11 billion under management.  Credit swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails
to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A
basis point equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10
million of debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
