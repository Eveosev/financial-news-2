Poland ’s WIG20 Index dropped 7.26, or
0.3 percent, to close at 2,822.57, bringing the week’s decline
to 1.6 percent.  The following are among the most active stocks on the
 Warsaw Stock Exchange  today. Stock symbols follow company names.  Agora SA (AGO)   declined 1.3 zloty, or 5.4 percent, to 23
zloty, the lowest close since July. Poland’s biggest publisher
said first-quarter net income fell to 6.13 million zloty ($2.2
million) from 21.7 million zloty. This compares with the average
estimate of 6.85 million zloty in a Bloomberg survey of four
analysts.  Globe Trade Centre SA (GTC)  , Poland’s biggest property
developer by market value, declined for a third day, retreating
0.7 zloty, or 3.5 percent, to 19.4 zloty, a two-year low, as
Deutsche Bank AG cut its recommendation to “sell” from
“hold.”  KGHM Polska Miedz SA (KGH)   gained 1.1 zloty, or 0.6
percent, to 181.3 zloty, rising for the first time in three
days. Poland’s sole copper producer said first-quarter
unconsolidated net income, which excludes earnings at certain
units such as phone company Telefonia Dialog SA, rose to 1.96
billion zloty from 725.4 million zloty a year earlier. That
compares with the 1.85 billion-zloty average estimate of six
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Polimex-Mostostal SA (PXM)   sank 0.03 zloty, or 1
percent, to 3.06 zloty, the lowest close in more than two years.
Poland’s second-largest construction company by revenue said
first-quarter net income fell to 12.5 million zloty from 16.8
million zloty a year earlier. That compares with the 16.4
million-zloty mean estimate of four analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg.  Zaklady Azotowe Pulawy SA (ZAP)   rose 1.7 zloty, or 1.4
percent, to 124.7 zloty, extending this week’s advance to 3.1
percent. Poland’s largest fertilizer maker said net income for
the quarter ended March 31 rose to 197.8 million zloty from 38.6
million zloty a year earlier. That compares with the 122.5
million-zloty average estimate of five analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
