U.S. policy makers should “shoulder
their responsibilities” for measures that promoted the
“excessive” pursuit of homeownership, distorted the housing
market and became a main cause of the financial crisis, Bank of
China Ltd. Chairman Xiao Gang wrote in a commentary published in
today’s  China Daily  newspaper.  Chasing this “American dream” encouraged financial
institutions to misallocate too much capital and credit to the
housing markets, Xiao wrote.  Income tax deductions for mortgage interest payments and
exemptions from capital gains taxes were among measures that
encouraged home ownership, Xiao wrote. The U.S. government also
set up  Fannie Mae  and  Freddie Mac  to guarantee home loans made
by banks, Xiao wrote. These agencies made “affordable housing”
their mission and aggressively grew their business, he wrote.  The measures spurred home loans and “pumped up” prices,
leading to “massive mortgage defaults,” Xiao wrote. Many
middle- and low-income families became heavily indebted and
defaulted on their loans, Xiao wrote.  To contact the Bloomberg News staff on this story:
