Oil dropped from a two-day high in
 New York  amid signs a surge in fuel prices in the last year is
slowing growth in economies including the U.S., the world’s
biggest crude-consuming nation.  Futures slid as much as 1.1 percent today.  South Korea  said
unstable  oil prices  are a “major downside risk” a day after
the  International Energy Agency  reduced its 2011 oil demand
estimate for the first time. U.S. consumer sentiment declined
and retail sales rose at the slowest pace in nine months as
households paid almost $4 a gallon at the pump.  “The high cost of gasoline is shutting the economy down,
and that’s prevalent in the numbers that are coming across,”
said  Jonathan Barratt , managing director of Commodity Broking
Services Pty in Sydney, who predicted oil will average $100 a
barrel this year. “The data doesn’t support oil.”  Crude for June delivery fell as much as $1.10 to $97.87 a
barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile
Exchange, and was at $98.47 at 12:21 p.m.  Singapore  time.
Yesterday, it rose 76 cents to $98.97, the highest settlement
since May 10. Prices are up 1.4 percent this week and 33 percent
in the past year.  Brent oil for June settlement slid 13 cents, or 0.1
percent, to $112.85 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe exchange.  IEA Forecast  South Korea’s central bank said unstable oil prices are a
“major downside risk” as it unexpectedly kept its benchmark
interest rate on hold.  The Paris-based IEA reduced its estimate for this year’s
worldwide fuel consumption by 190,000 barrels a day, or 0.2
percent, in its monthly market report yesterday. Demand will
still grow by 1.3 million barrels a day, or 1.5 percent, to
89.18 million a day compared with 2010.  “We’ve gotten crude prices to a point where we start to
think about demand destruction,” said  John Vautrain , a senior
vice-president at energy consultants Purvin & Gertz Inc. in
Singapore. “It’s getting up to a point where people are
starting to be hurt. In the U.S. in particular, gasoline demand
has gone wobbly.”  U.S. retail sales rose 0.5 percent, the smallest gain since
July, after a 0.9 percent March advance that was more than
double the previous estimate, Commerce Department figures showed
yesterday. The Bloomberg Consumer Comfort Index dropped to minus
46.9 in the period to May 8, the lowest reading since March.  Gasoline Demand  Gasoline fell for a third day after the IEA said fuel
demand in  North America  will decline this year by 190,000
barrels to 23.7 million a day and on speculation refineries
won’t be as affected by the swollen  Mississippi River  as
previously thought.  The IEA lowered its forecast for the region by 220,000
barrels a day from last month’s report, citing lower growth
projections from the  International Monetary Fund .  Gasoline for June delivery dropped 0.5 percent to $3.0482 a
gallon in New York. Futures have advanced 39 percent in the past
year. Regular retail gasoline in the U.S. rose 2.2 cents to
$3.984 a gallon on May 11, AAA said on its website, 38 percent
higher than a year earlier.  Gasoline demand in the U.S., in terms of products shipped
by refiners, fell to 8.83 million barrels a day in the week
ending May 6, the Energy Department said on May 11. That’s the
lowest since the week of Feb. 4  Floodwaters rolling south down the  Mississippi  drove the
crest in  Memphis  to 47.87 feet (14.6 meters), just under the
record 48.7 feet set in 1937. The deluge threatens to set more
high-water marks before the flow splits in  Louisiana , with 70
percent remaining in the channel and 30 percent running down the
Atchafalaya River.  Open Interest  Gasoline surged 6.1 percent on May 9, the most since July
2009, on concern production and distribution would be crippled
by the flood.  Open interest in crude futures on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  rose to a record 1.664 million contracts, exceeding the
1.662 million on May 9, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Volume was 867,272 contracts, after 1.02 million on May 11, 40
percent above the average of the past three months.  Brent, the European benchmark, traded at a premium of
$14.36 a barrel to U.S. futures. The difference between front-
month contracts in  London  and New York surged to a record $19.54
on Feb. 21. It averaged 76 cents last year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
