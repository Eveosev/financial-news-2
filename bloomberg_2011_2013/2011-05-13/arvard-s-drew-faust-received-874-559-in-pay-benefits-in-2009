Harvard University President Drew Faust received $874,559 in salary and benefits in 2009,
including travel expenses and the use of a residence.  Harvard, the oldest U.S. college, paid Faust $705,991 in
salary and provided benefits valued at $168,568, including use
of the president’s home, according to a report to the  Internal
Revenue Service . Faust’s compensation rose 6.4 percent from
2008, when she received $822,011.  Faust became president in 2007, succeeding  Lawrence Summers , who stepped down after the faculty passed a no-
confidence motion against him. Harvard’s endowment was battered
by the economic crisis that began in 2008, and Faust is now
preparing the university for a multiyear fundraising effort,
called a capital campaign, to help boost finances.  The value of Harvard’s endowment rose 11 percent to $27.4
billion in the year ending June 30, the university said in
September.  John Longbrake, a university spokesman, declined to comment
on the president’s salary.  To contact the reporter on this story:
