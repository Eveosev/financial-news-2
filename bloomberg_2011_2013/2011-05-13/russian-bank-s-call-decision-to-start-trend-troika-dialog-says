Russian Agricultural Bank’s decision
to redeem international debt yesterday will save the bank money
and may lead other Russian lenders to follow suit, meaning the
bonds are due to rally, according to Troika Dialog.  Russian Agricultural Bank’s 10-year Eurobonds maturing in
2016 climbed, pushing the yield down 63 basis points, or 0.63
percentage point, to a record-low level of 3.899 percent as of
4:11 p.m. in Moscow. The bank  announced  yesterday it will
exercise its September call option on $500 million of the 10-
year notes. Today’s drop is the biggest in two years.  The return on the bonds if not repaid until maturity would
be about 360 basis points, or 3.6 percentage points, at least 80
basis points wider than debt of the state-owned bank due in 2017
and 2018, Troika Dialog said. To save on borrowing costs,  Alfa
Bank  and Bank of Moscow may decide to redeem 2017 dollar debt,
Russian Standard to exercise a call option on 2016 notes and
Promsvyazbank to repay its Eurobonds due 2018 before maturity.  “The likely call execution” on the other banks’ bonds
“renders them somewhat underpriced,”  Stanislav Ponomarenko , a
fixed-income analyst at Moscow-based Troika, wrote in an e-
mailed research note today. The banks’ bonds “are currently
trading one to 1.5 percentage points below fair price.”  Callable bonds allow the issuer to redeem the notes before
the date of maturity at a previously fixed price. Announcing a
 call option  will be exercised reduces the risk of nonpayment for
the holders of the debt.  Russian Agricultural Bank’s 2016 bond yields have dropped
for the past five days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
