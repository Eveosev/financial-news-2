While the world wonders what is
happening to Ai Weiwei, the Chinese artist and activist who was
disappeared by Beijing police last month just as he was boarding
a plane in the capital, his “Zodiac Heads” hold vigil at the
fountain in front of  New York ’s legendary Plaza Hotel.  The 12 beasts (including one dragon) recall a picturesque
fountain that was once part of a retreat built outside of
Beijing by the fabled Qianlong emperor, an 18th-century aesthete
whose enclave in the Forbidden City was recently on view at the
 Metropolitan Museum  of Art.  Weiwei’s vivid creatures are attracting lots of
appreciative humans who stroll by, often continuing into Central
Park with their dogs. We saw only a few sporting fur as
splendidly textured as Weiwei’s Dog.  Attached is a portfolio of images by Paul Goguen,
photographer for Muse, Bloomberg’s arts and culture section.  (Lili Rosboch writes for Muse. Any opinions expressed are
