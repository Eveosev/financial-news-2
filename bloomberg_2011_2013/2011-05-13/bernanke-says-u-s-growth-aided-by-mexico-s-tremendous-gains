Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said an improvement in Mexico’s economic policies
during the past two decades has helped bolster U.S. growth.  “Mexico’s tremendous economic strides during the past two
decades” have included curbing inflation, improving fiscal
policy and avoiding financial crises, Bernanke said today in a
speech in Washington. “Because the prosperity of our countries
is so closely linked, we in the United States benefit from” the
“foresight and hard work” of Mexico’s policy makers.  Bernanke said last month he expects rising exports to
contribute to U.S. economic growth. The U.S. trade deficit
widened more than forecast in March as the highest  oil prices  in
more than two years eclipsed record exports, figures from the
Commerce Department showed May 11. Mexico is the second biggest
market for U.S. exports after  Canada , according to the agency.  “The growth of the Mexican and U.S. economies are strongly
related,” Bernanke said in prepared remarks while accepting an
award at an event hosted by the United States-Mexico Chamber of
Commerce. “Our countries are tightly linked through trade.”  Bernanke’s comments didn’t address the U.S. economic
outlook or monetary policy. The Federal Open Market Committee
next meets in Washington on June 21-22.  To contact the reporter on this story:
