Iraq ’s West Qurna Phase 2 oil field
will start production in 2013 at a rate of 150,000 barrels a
day, an OAO Lukoil executive said.  The company, which is developing the field, forecasts
production of 400,000 barrels a day by 2014, Gati al-Jebouri,
executive director and chief commercial officer for Lukoil Mid-
East, a unit of Russia’s second-largest oil producer Lukoil,
said at a Platts conference in London today.  The Middle Eastern country is unlikely to achieve its aim
of doubling refinery capacity by 2015, he said.  Iraq’s rising natural gas production won’t impact world
markets because “virtually all” will be used domestically, the
Lukoil executive said. Russia is the world’s biggest gas
exporter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
