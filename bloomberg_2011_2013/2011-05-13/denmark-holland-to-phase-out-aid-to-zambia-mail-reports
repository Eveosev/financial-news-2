Denmark will phase out aid to  Zambia 
over the next three years, while Holland follows suit over an
unspecified period, the  Daily Mail  said, citing Zambian Finance
Minister  Situmbeko Musokotwane .  Zambia expects foreign aid to decline because per capita
incomes in the country have risen from about $330 a year in 2001
to $1,200 last year, the Lusaka-based  Daily Mail  said on its
website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
