Credit-default swaps insuring the
subordinated debt of Bank of Ireland Plc surged on concern the
government will impose losses on bondholders as it has done with
Anglo Irish Bank Corp. and Allied Irish Banks Plc.  Allied Irish this week offered to buy back junior debt at
discounts of 75 percent to 90 percent prompting  Standard &
Poor’s  to downgrade the notes to the lowest D for default grade.
The “distressed exchange” is similar to that offered to Anglo
Irish bondholders last year as the government seeks to share the
costs of bailing out its lenders.  “The coerciveness of the Irish government has spread from
Anglo to Allied,” said Alexander Plenk, an analyst at UniCredit
SpA in Munich. “The offer they made was pretty much the same,
and the fear in the market is that they will do the same thing
with Bank of Ireland.”  Swaps on Bank of Ireland’s junior debt jumped 4.75
percentage points to 44.5 percent upfront and five percent a
year, according to CMA. That means it costs 4.45 million euros
($6.3 million) in advance and 500,000 euros annually to insure
10 million euros of debt for five years.  Bank of Ireland bondholders may lose more than 70 percent
in a future buyback of their junior debt, according to Glas
Securities, the Dublin-based fixed-income firm.  Contracts on the bank’s senior debt rose 0.75 percentage
point to 17 percent upfront and five percent a year. Credit-
default swaps pay the buyer face value in exchange for the
underlying securities or the cash equivalent should a borrower
fail to adhere to its debt agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
