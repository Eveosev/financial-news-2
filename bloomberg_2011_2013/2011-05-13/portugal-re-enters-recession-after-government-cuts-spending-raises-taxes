Portugal ’s economy shrank for a
second quarter in the three months through March, putting the
country back into recession as the government tries to cut
spending and raises taxes to narrow its  budget deficit .  Gross domestic product dropped 0.7 percent from the fourth
quarter, when it fell a revised 0.6 percent, the Lisbon-based
National Statistics Institute said in a preliminary report
today. Economists expected a decline of 0.3 percent, the median
of three estimates in a Bloomberg survey showed. GDP dropped 0.7
percent from a year earlier. Portugal exited its last recession
in the second quarter of 2009.  The contraction “reflects an accentuated negative
contribution of internal demand, resulting from a reduction in
consumer spending of households and public administration, and
to a lesser degree, from a reduction in investment,” the
institute said.  Finance Minister Fernando Teixeira dos Santos said May 5
the economy will shrink 2 percent this year, twice as much as
previously forecast. The government is implementing additional
austerity measures to qualify for an international aid package
of as much as 78 billion euros ($112 billion) from the European
Union and the  International Monetary Fund . GDP will also decline
2 percent in 2012, he said.  German Expansion  In the euro area as a whole, Germany and  France  led
economic growth in the first quarter as booming exports fueled
domestic spending in the bloc’s core, offsetting the turmoil
sparked by sovereign-debt woes in  Greece , Ireland and Portugal.
German GDP jumped 1.5 percent from the fourth quarter and French
GDP rose 1 percent.  Portugal’s aid package calls for the government to
implement some austerity measures that parliament rejected in
March. Spending reductions for 2012 and 2013, including cuts to
pensions, will amount to 3.4 percent of GDP, while revenue
increases will represent 1.7 percent of economic output. The
plan also earmarks 12 billion euros for Portugal’s banks.  The government will freeze public workers’ salaries and
pensions through 2013 and cut pensions of more than 1,500 euros
a month. Tax deductions will be limited, and the government is
aiming to sell its stakes in companies including EDP-Energias de
Portugal SA, the biggest electricity provider, and REN-Redes
Energeticas Nacionais SA, the operator of the national  power
grid , by the end of this year.  The aid program will allow the economy to start recovering
in 2013, according to Teixeira dos Santos. Portugal’s
unemployment rate will peak at 13 percent in 2013, he said.  The European Commission today forecast Portugal’s GDP will
drop 2.2 percent this year and 1.8 percent in 2012. The
country’s economic growth has averaged less than 1 percent a
year in the past decade, one of  Europe ’s weakest rates.  The three-year aid plan for Portugal set goals for a budget
deficit of 5.9 percent of GDP this year, 4.5 percent in 2012 and
3 percent in 2013. Portugal’s public debt swelled to 93 percent
of GDP in 2010 from 68 percent in 2007. The commission forecast
that debt will increase to 101.7 percent of GDP this year and
107.4 percent in 2012.  To contact the reporters on this story:
