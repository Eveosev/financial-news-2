Avocet Mining Plc (AVM) , a producer of gold
in  Burkina Faso , fell to the lowest in more than six months in
London trading after halting operations at its Inata mine as a
wage and benefits dispute led to “labor unrest.”  Avocet closed 2.3 percent lower after losing as much as 6.9
percent. The company shut the mine after discussions failed, the
London-based producer said in a statement today.  “The illegal unrest commenced as a result of a breakdown
in ongoing discussions involving wage reclassifications, general
salary increases and other benefits,” Avocet said in a
statement. “The company is confident that this work stoppage
will not be prolonged.”  Avocet is counting on output from Inata as the company is
selling its other producing mines in Malaysia and  Indonesia .
Inata, which yielded 47,963 ounces of gold in the first quarter,
is forecast to produce 165,000 ounces this year.  Avocet declined 4.5 pence to 192 pence by the 4:30 p.m.
close in London, the lowest since Nov. 4.  To contact the reporter on this story:
