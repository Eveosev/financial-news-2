Gujarat State Petronet Ltd. (GUJS) , an
Indian operator of natural gas pipelines, climbed the most in 18
months after  India ’s highest court yesterday allowed the
industry regulator to award gas-pipeline projects.  The shares rose 5.8 percent to 104.1 rupees at 2:55 p.m. in
Mumbai, set for their biggest gain since November 2009. The
stock has lost 12 percent of its value this year, compared with
a 8.9 percent drop in the Bombay Stock Exchange Sensitive Index.  The Supreme Court allowed the  Petroleum and Natural Gas
Regulatory Board  to process and authorize pipeline projects and
give licenses for sale of gas in cities, Press Trust of India
reported yesterday, citing Justice Dalveer Bhandari, Justice
V.S. Sirpurkar and Justice Deepak Verma.  “The Supreme Court order allows the regulator to award
pipeline projects now, which had been held up,” said Durgesh Poyekar, an analyst at ULJK Securities Pvt., which recommends
buying the stock. “Gujarat State Petronet is expected to win
three pipeline projects.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
