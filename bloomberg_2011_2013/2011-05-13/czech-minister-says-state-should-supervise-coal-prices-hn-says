Lignite coal prices and deliveries to
heating plants should be supervised by the government after

Czech Industry and Trade Minister Martin Kocourek.  The cheapest price on the market should set a benchmark for
the rest of the deliveries, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story: Lenka Ponikelska in
