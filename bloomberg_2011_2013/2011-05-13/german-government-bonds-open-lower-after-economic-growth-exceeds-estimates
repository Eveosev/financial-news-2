German  government bonds  opened lower,
sending the yield up two basis points to 3.13 percent as of 7:06
a.m. in London, as data showed the nation’s first-quarter
economic growth exceeded economists’ forecasts.  The two-year note yield rose three basis points to 1.80
percent.  Gross domestic product, adjusted for seasonal effects,
jumped 1.5 percent from the fourth quarter, when it rose 0.4
percent, the Federal Statistics Office in Wiesbaden said today.
Economists had forecast growth of 0.9 percent, according to the
median of 30 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey. From a year
earlier, GDP surged 5.2 percent, the biggest increase recorded
since German reunification two decades ago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
