Spain  is less likely to become
engulfed in the euro area’s sovereign-debt after the government
implemented policies to reassure investors it’s serious about
strengthening the economy, the  International Monetary Fund  said.  “A year ago you saw Spain moving very much in sync with
 Greece , Portugal or Ireland, with market concerns about Spain
very similar to that for the other countries,” IMF European
Director Antonio Borges told a news conference in Warsaw today.
“Today we see very strong decoupling on the part of Spain
relative to the other countries, because the Spaniards have put
in place a whole series of measures which have convinced the
markets they are in a much stronger position than before.”  Spanish economic growth accelerated to 0.3 percent in the
first quarter as increasing exports helped offset some of the
effects of the deepest austerity measures in three decades, the
National Statistics Institute in  Madrid  said today. The
government is overhauling labor and pension rules to help cut
unemployment and counting on higher foreign sales to counter a
drop in  consumer spending .  “Markets were quite skeptical of the whole of the  euro
zone  last year and thought that in fact what was happening in
Greece could signal problems throughout the euro zone,” Borges
said. “This is not what we see today. There is much less
concern that the crisis will be a euro-wide crisis, it is much
more contained.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
