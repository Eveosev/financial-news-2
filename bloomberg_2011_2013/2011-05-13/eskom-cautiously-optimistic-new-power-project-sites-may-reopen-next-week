Eskom Holdings Ltd. said it is
“cautiously optimistic” that its Medupi and Kusile power plant
construction sites may reopen “some time next week.”  Talks continue to resolve disputes, including over foreign
labor, that prompted violent protests at the two sites earlier
this month, Eskom spokeswoman Hilary Joffe said by mobile phone
today. Eskom shut the Kusile site May 6 and suspended work on
Medupi on May 10.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
