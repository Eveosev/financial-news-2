Natural gas futures rose in  New York 
as data showed the number of gas drilling rigs fell to the
lowest level in 15 months.  Prices erased earlier declines after Houston-based Baker
Hughes Inc. said the count declined 16 to 874 this week, the
lowest level since Jan. 29, 2010. Gas also rose as prices
reached a support level of $4.20, said Carl Neill, an energy
consultant at Risk Management Inc. in Atlanta.  “That’s a big drop for the rig count and it’s going to
support the market,” said Neill. “You are having summer heat
coming in a few weeks and the market isn’t ready to move
lower.”  Natural gas for June delivery gained 5.2 cents, or 1.2
percent, to settle at $4.246 per million British thermal units
on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . The futures rose 0.3
percent this week, the fourth increase in five weeks.  The gas rig count has declined 4.9 percent this year, the
Baker Hughes data showed. Falling rigs reduce future gas
production. The Energy Department lowered on May 10 its forecast
for gas output in 2011 and raised its outlook for prices.  Gas production will average 63.23 billion cubic feet a day
in 2011, down from 63.32 billion estimated in April, the
department said in its monthly  Short-Term Energy Outlook .  Gas prices at the benchmark  Henry Hub  in Erath,  Louisiana ,
will average $4.37 per thousand cubic feet, or $4.24 per million
British thermal units, up from the previous estimate of $4.10
per million Btu, according to the department.  Stockpile Deficit  Stockpiles were 2 percent below the five-year average and
12 percent below last year’s level, the widest year-on-year
deficit since the week ended Aug. 1, 2008, the Energy Department
reported yesterday.  “Tightness in the supply, demand balance reflects
temporary seasonal factors, such as high nuclear maintenance,”
said James R. Crandell, an analyst with  Barclays Capital  in New
York, said in a note to clients today.  Nuclear power production climbed for a seventh day today,
rebounding from the lowest level since 1999 as plants restarted
after maintenance and refueling shutdowns.  Atomic output rose 682 megawatts from yesterday to 77,210
megawatts, or 76 percent of capacity, according to a Nuclear
Regulatory Commission report and data compiled by Bloomberg.  Some reactors close for maintenance and refueling during
the spring and fall in the U.S., when demand for heating and
cooling is lowest. Nuclear plant shutdowns may boost the demand
for gas in the electric power sector.  Earlier Decline  Gas fell earlier on forecasts of moderating temperatures
that may reduce demand for the power-plant fuel.  Temperatures will be normal or below-normal across most of
the continental U.S. through May 22, according to Commodity
Weather Group LLC in Bethesda,  Maryland .  “The weather really isn’t doing much to cooperate at this
point,” said  Peter Beutel , the president of Cameron Hanover
Inc., an energy advisory company in  New Canaan ,  Connecticut .
“Traders are waiting for the magical leap when the southern
U.S. takes over cooling demand from the heating demand in the
north.  The high temperature in New York on May 18 may be 70
degrees Fahrenheit (21 Celsius), 2 below normal, according to
AccuWeather Inc. in  State College ,  Pennsylvania . The high in
Houston may be 83 degrees, 3 below normal.  Cooling demand in the U.S. may be 20 percent below normal
from May 19 through May 23, said  David Salmon , a meteorologist
with Weather Derivatives in Belton,  Missouri , in a note to
clients today.  Gas Shipments  Natural gas shipments to U.S. power plants dropped for a
second day as milder weather reduced demand.  A sample of scheduled gas shipments for U.S. electricity
generation fell 11 percent to 13.8 million dekatherms (13.5
billion cubic feet) from yesterday’s 15.6 million, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Power plants  use 30 percent of the nation’s gas supplies,
according to the Energy Department.  Gas futures volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was
169,622 as of 2:42 p.m., compared with the three-month average
of 309,000. Volume was 289,430 yesterday. Open interest was
966,158 contracts. The three-month average open interest is
945,000.  The exchange has a one-business-day delay in reporting open
interest and full volume data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
