Spain ’s anti-trust commission fined
the five biggest power companies and their trade group Unesa a
combined 61.2 million euros ($86.3 million) for what the agency
said was price collusion to keep from losing customers.  Endesa SA (ELE) , owned by  Italy ’s  Enel SpA (ENEL) , was ordered to pay
26.6 million euros, the most of the group, according to a
 statement  today by the Comision Nacional de la Competencia.  The utilities set obstacles for clients who wanted to
switch electricity suppliers after regulators liberalized the
market starting July 1, 2009, the commission said.  A spokesman for Endesa, who would only speak without being
identified, said the company disagreed with the ruling and would
appeal it in the National Court.  The fine is the second-largest handed out to an industry in
Spain by the regulator, after insurers were ordered to pay 120.7
million euros in 2009, the Efe newswire reported today.  Following is a table of today’s sanctions in euros:  To contact the reporter on this story:
