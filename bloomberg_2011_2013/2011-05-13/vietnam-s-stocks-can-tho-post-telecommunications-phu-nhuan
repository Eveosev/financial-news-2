Shares of the following companies had
unusual moves in  Vietnam  trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses, and prices are as of the 11 a.m. local-time close.  The VN Index, the benchmark measure of the Ho Chi Minh City
Stock Exchange, declined 0.5 percent to 479.67, paring its
weekly advance to 1.5 percent.  Can Tho Techno-Agricultural Supplies Joint-Stock Co. (TSC
VN), one of Vietnam’s biggest fertilizer importers, jumped 4.7
percent to 13,300 dong, gaining for the first time in more than
a week. First-quarter profit increased 18 percent to 5.2 billion
dong, according to the exchange’s website. It will also buy back
300,000 shares, the company said without giving a timeframe.  Post & Telecommunications Investment & Construction Joint-
Stock Co. (PTC VN), a builder of roads, ports and
telecommunications infrastructure, slid 4.4 percent, to 13,200
dong. The company had a net loss of 3.25 billion dong ($158,000)
in the first quarter, according to a company filing on the
exchange’s website. Sales dropped to 24.7 billion dong from 29.4
billion in a year earlier, according to the document.  Phu Nhuan Jewelry Joint-Stock Co. (PNJ VN), the only
jewelry manufacturer on the exchange, fell 4.1 percent, the
steepest loss since March 22, to 25,600 dong. Vietnam’s  gold
prices  fell 300,000 dong to 37.37 million dong per tael
yesterday as the value of the precious metal dropped globally,
Tuoi Tre newspaper reported, without saying where it got the
information. Stability in the foreign exchange market and
reports of a possible ban on bullion trading also contributed to
the decline in domestic gold prices, according to the report.  --Nguyen Dieu Tu Uyen. With assistance from Giang Nguyen.
