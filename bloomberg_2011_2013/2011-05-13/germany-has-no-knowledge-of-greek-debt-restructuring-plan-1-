The German government said it has
“no knowledge” of any plan for a Greek debt restructuring,
spokesman Christoph Steegmans said in an interview, denying a
report in Die Welt newspaper.  The government said today it is waiting for the conclusions
of a European and International Monetary Fund mission to  Greece 
before making any decision on whether further steps may need to
be taken.  German newspaper  Die Welt  reported earlier today that
Germany backed a “voluntary restructuring” of Greek debt.
Germany, the European Commission and the IMF support an
extension of maturities on Greek bonds because of the worsening
deficit situation in the nation, the newspaper said in an
advance copy of an article in tomorrow’s edition, without saying
where it got the information.  The  European Central Bank  and  France  still oppose any cut
of Greek debt, the newspaper said.  Earlier today at a regular press briefing, the German
government reiterated that it wouldn’t make any decisions on
Greece before the mission reported.  To contact the reporters on this story:
