U.K. economic growth will accelerate
this year as a weak pound fuels exports, the European Commission
said today.  Gross domestic product will grow 1.7 percent in 2011 after
expanding 1.3 percent last year, the European Union’s Brussels-
based executive said in a report. The economy is forecast to
expand 2.1 percent in 2012.  The pound’s drop of about 24 percent on a trade-weighted
basis since early 2007 will spur demand for British goods abroad
and U.K. exporters’ equipment needs will help support company
investment, the commission said. Falling incomes will weigh on
private consumption and “persistent” high inflation poses a
risk to household spending, it said.  “The prospects are positive” for exports and company
investment, the commission said. “While the need for new growth
drivers does increase the uncertainty around the 2011 forecast,
continued growth still appears probable.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
