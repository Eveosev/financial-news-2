Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV) ’s new
acquisition, AirTran, initially will retain practices such as
bag fees and seat assignments that have been shunned at the
largest discount carrier.  Southwest got an initial look at proprietary AirTran data
today when it closed the $1 billion purchase of the smaller
airline and is deferring any shift in operations pending a more-
thorough review, Chief Executive Officer  Gary Kelly  said.  “Today’s the beginning,” Kelly said on a flight to
Atlanta from Southwest’s Dallas headquarters for a celebration
with employees. “We have much we want to learn before we start
to make changes. For some months, there won’t be any changes.”  Buying AirTran gives Southwest access to Atlanta, the
world’s busiest airport. It also puts Southwest in the position
of owning an airline that charges to check luggage and rebook
flights, policies for which it has lampooned rivals in
television commercials.  “We’re literally on a different system for everything,”
said Bob Jordan, the Southwest executive vice president who has
been appointed president of Orlando, Florida-based AirTran. “At
some point, AirTran’s fees are going to go away.”  Southwest fell 14 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $11.61 at 4:02
p.m. in  New York  Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares
have declined 13 percent since Sept. 27, when Southwest agreed
to buy AirTran for $3.75 cash and 0.321 Southwest share for each
share of  AirTran Holdings Inc. (AAI)   Debt Ratings  Including AirTran debt and capitalized aircraft operating
leases, the transaction is valued at about $3.2 billion, the
airlines said. Standard & Poor’s cut Southwest’s  credit rating 
today to BBB-, the lowest investment grade, from BBB, citing the
assumption of AirTran debt and leases. S&P raised AirTran to
BBB- from B-.  Passengers won’t start to see many changes until late 2011
or early 2012, according to Southwest. The airlines expect to
receive regulatory approval to operate as one carrier early in
2012, and the most substantive changes will occur after that.  Southwest and AirTran will continue to operate separate
flight schedules, reservation systems and websites. AirTran’s
planes will retain a first-class section and their current paint
scheme.  ‘Support That Brand’  “AirTran continues to be a brand, and we will support that
brand, just as we support the Southwest brand,” Kelly said.  While Southwest and AirTran have both focused on low fares
as central to their appeal to travelers, their approaches
differ. Southwest jets have only one class of service, for
example, and AirTran has coach and business-class cabins.
AirTran also charges extra for seats on the aisle, next to a
window or with extra legroom.  Southwest will examine all of AirTran’s operations,
learning things such as how the airline operates a hub-and-spoke
flight system and its  Boeing Co. (BA)  717s. Southwest flies an all
Boeing 737 fleet, which it has long described as a pivotal move
in holding down maintenance expenses.  Southwest will compete directly in Atlanta with  Delta Air
Lines Inc. (DAL) , the world’s second-largest carrier. Delta controls
75 percent of passengers at Atlanta, now the biggest airport for
AirTran.  The acquisition also will give Southwest more gates at New
York’s LaGuardia and its first service at  Washington ’s  Reagan
National . Southwest is the fourth-largest U.S. airline by
traffic, after United Continental Holdings Inc., Delta and  AMR
Corp. (AMR) ’s  American Airlines .  Buying AirTran will allow Southwest to resume growth in
seating capacity for the first time since the end of 2008, and
will add about $3 billion a year in revenue.  To contact the reporters on this story:
