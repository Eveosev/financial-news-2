(Corrects to show monthly drop in April was the largest
since October 2008 in fourth paragraph.)  Cotton fell for the fifth time in six
sessions after an index of manufacturing declined in  China , the
world’s largest buyer. Orange juice gained.  The Purchasing Managers’ Index fell to 52.9 in April from
53.4 in March, China’s logistics federation and the statistics
bureau said yesterday. The country’s central bank has raised
 interest rates  four times since October to curb inflation.
Imports by the Asian country plummeted 15 percent in March from
a year earlier.  “This indicates that textile manufacturing is slowing down
in China, and demand for cotton continues to remain weak,” said
 Andy Ryan , a senior risk-management consultant at FCStone Fibers
& Textiles in Nashville, Tennessee.  Cotton for July delivery dropped 2.9 cents, or 1.8 percent,
to $1.5512 a pound at 10:47 a.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in New
York. The fiber plunged 21 percent last month, the most since
October 2008.  Orange-juice  futures for July delivery gained 2.55 cents,
or 1.5 percent, to $1.7125 a pound, rising for the fourth
straight session.  To contact the reporter on this story:
