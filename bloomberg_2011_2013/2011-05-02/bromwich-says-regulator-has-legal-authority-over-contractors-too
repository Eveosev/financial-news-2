The U.S. offshore drilling regulator
has authority to expand its role and oversee contractors such as
rig owners and cement-work providers, said the head of the
 Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement .  “We have broad legal authority over all activities
relating to offshore leases” by lessees, operators or
contractors, agency director  Michael Bromwich , said today at the
Offshore Technology Conference in Houston. “The reason for our
historical practice that has focused solely on regulating
operators was that it served to preserve clarity and the
singular responsibility of the operator.”  Bad decisions by  BP Plc (BP/) , owner of the Macondo well that
blew out in the Gulf of Mexico more than a year ago, and its
main contractors,  Transocean Ltd. (RIG)  and  Halliburton Co. (HAL) , caused
the worst U.S. offshore oil spill, the  National Commission on
the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill  said on Jan. 5.  Vernier, Switzerland-based Transocean supplied a rig, and
Houston-based Halliburton supplied cementing services for the
well.  To contact the reporters on this story:
