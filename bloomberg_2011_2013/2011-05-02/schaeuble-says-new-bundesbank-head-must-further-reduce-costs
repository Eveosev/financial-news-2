Germany ’s Bundesbank, the biggest
central bank in the 17-nation euro region, must continue to cut
costs under new president Jens Weidmann, Finance Minister
 Wolfgang Schaeuble  said today at the bank’s headquarters in
Frankfurt.  Former president Axel Weber, whose term ended at the end of
last month, was forced to expose the staff of the Bundesbank to
“many reorganizations,” Schaeuble said at Weidmann’s
inauguration ceremony. “There continues to be a need for action
in the coming years.”  The Bundesbank between 2002 and 2007 closed almost two
thirds of its branches and reduced staff by a third, helping it
to cut costs by 20 percent. The central bank has  said  it aims to
reduce administrative layers at its headquarters and cut more
costs in the 2008-2012 period.  The Bundesbank ceded control of interest rates to the
 European Central Bank  in 1999 with the introduction of the euro.  To contact the reporter on this story:
