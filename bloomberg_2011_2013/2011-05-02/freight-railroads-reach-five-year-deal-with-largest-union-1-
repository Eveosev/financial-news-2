The seven largest U.S. freight
railroads and the United Transportation Union, the largest
railroad workers union, said they reached a tentative five-year
agreement covering wages, benefits and working conditions.  The terms of the agreement weren’t disclosed because it has
yet to be ratified by the union’s 38,000 members, according to a
 statement  today on the UTU Web site.  The National Carriers Conference Committee acted as the
railroads’ bargaining agent. It represented Warren Buffett’s
Burlington Northern Santa Fe, based in  Fort Worth , Texas;
 Norfolk Southern Corp. (NSC) , based in Norfolk, Virginia;  CSX Corp. (CSX) ,
based in Jacksonville, Florida; and  Union Pacific Corp. (UNP) , based
in Omaha, Nebraska.  The union is expected to present the agreement to its
leadership later this month, Frank Wilner, a spokesman for the
group, said in an e-mail. Union leaders will then have 15 days
to submit questions, and the questions and answers will be
provided to all members prior to a ratification vote, according
to the statement.  Other rail labor organizations, bargaining as part of two
other coalitions, are in their second year of negotiations with
the railroads. They include the Brotherhood of Locomotive
Engineers and Trainmen, the Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way
Employes and the Brotherhood of Railroad Signalmen, according to
a statement on the latter group’s Web site.  To contact the reporter on this story:
