The judge in the trial of Galleon
Group LLC co-founder Raj Rajaratnam said there will be no jury
deliberations in the case tomorrow due to a juror’s medical
procedure. U.S. District Judge Richard Holwell said the jury may
continue its deliberations today.  “The jury will have all the time it needs to reach its
verdict,” Holwell said. The announcement was in response to a
note from a juror.  To contact the reporter on this story:
