Police presence at the site of the
World Trade Center in  New York City  has been increased following
yesterday’s announcement by President Barack Obama thatOsama Bin Laden had been killed by U.S. forces.  In a statement today, the Port Authority of New York and
 New Jersey  said that its police, who have jurisdiction over the
site of Ground Zero in lower  Manhattan , have been told to
increase their presence at all Port Authority facilities,
including those at the site of the twin towers destroyed in the
terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.  “In light of the events that are unfolding, the Port
Authority has directed its police to increase its presence at
all Port Authority facilities, including the World Trade Center
site, and to coordinate with local, state and federal law
enforcement as required,” Chris Ward, executive director of the
agency, said in an e-mailed statement. “This response is not
based on a current threat, but out of an abundance of caution
until we have the chance to learn more. In the meantime, all
Port Authority facilities remain fully operational and at normal
service levels.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
