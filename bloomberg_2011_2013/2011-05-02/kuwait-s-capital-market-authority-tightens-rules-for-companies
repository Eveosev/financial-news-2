Kuwait ’s  Capital Markets Authority  is
requiring companies to get approval before asking shareholders
to back measures such as capital increases and reductions or
sales of bonds and other securities, according to a statement to
the Kuwait Stock Exchange today.  The authority began operating after bylaws for Kuwait’s
capital markets legislation were published March 13 in the
official Gazette.  Parliament approved a bill to create the authority, the
country’s first stock-market regulator, in February 2010.
Lawmakers said at the time that the bill would bring more
transparency to the exchange, which has lacked regulation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
