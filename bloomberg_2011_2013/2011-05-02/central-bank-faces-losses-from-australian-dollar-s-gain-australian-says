Australia ’s central bank may face
losses of as much as A$6 billion as the country’s strengthening
currency erodes the value of the bank’s foreign-exchange
reserves, the Australian newspaper reported. The RBA, which had
A$43 billion of foreign-exchange reserves at the end of June,
may not be able to pay a dividend to the government for several
years, the newspaper reported, without saying where it got the
information.  To contact the reporter on this story:
