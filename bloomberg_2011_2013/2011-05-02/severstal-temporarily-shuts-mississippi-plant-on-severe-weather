OAO Severstal has temporarily closed
the Columbus plant in  Mississippi  after a severe storm
interrupted electrical power.  Timing for restarting the plant in full has yet to be
determined,  Russia â€™s largest steelmaker said in an e-mailed
statement. The plant is completing limited operations with a
minimal power supply, the statement said.  All employees are safe and the storm did not damage the
building or equipment, according to the statement.  The Severstal press service was not immediately available
for comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
