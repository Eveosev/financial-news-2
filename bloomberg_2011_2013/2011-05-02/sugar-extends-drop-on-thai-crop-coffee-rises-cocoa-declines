Sugar fell to the lowest in more than
seven months on forecasts for record production in  Thailand , the
world’s second-biggest exporter. Coffee gained, while cocoa
dropped.  Sugar output in the Asian nation will reach 9.47 million
metric tons, after rainfall increased yields, boosting exports
to an all-time high, the country’s  Office of the Cane & Sugar
Board  said last week. That compares with an earlier projection
for record production of 9.11 million tons. Last month, the
commodity retreated 18 percent, the third straight drop, as
supply concerns eased.  “The Thai news is very bearish,” said Ricardo Scaff, a
trader at Rabobank International in New York.  Raw sugar for July delivery declined 0.38 cent, or 1.7
percent, to settle at 21.87 cents a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in
 New York . Earlier, the price touched 21.45 cents, the lowest
since Sept. 10. Today’s decline is the sixth straight, the
longest slump since March 2009.  The commodity has slumped 32 percent this year, the worst
performer among 19 raw materials in the Thomson
Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index.  Arabica coffee rose on concern that supplies from  Colombia ,
the second-biggest producer, may be limited. The agricultural
ministry yesterday said a lack of sunshine will hurt the
nation’s crop.  Arabica-coffee futures for July for delivery rose 5.25
cents, or 1.8 percent, to $3.051 a pound on ICE, after touching
$3.072, the highest since May 1997. The commodity gained 14
percent last month.  Cocoa futures for July delivery fell $49, or 1.5 percent,
to $3,291 a metric ton.  The NYSE Liffe exchange in  London  is closed for a holiday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
