An  Abbott Laboratories (ABT)  unit accused
generic drugmaker Teva Pharmaceuticals USA in a lawsuit of
patent infringement with plans to market a copy of Abbott’s
 AndroGel  testosterone preparation.  Abbott is asking a judge to block U.S. sales of the drug by
Teva until the patent expires in 2021, according to an April 29
complaint filed in federal court in Wilmington, Delaware.  Without such an order, “plaintiffs will be substantially
and irreparably harmed by Teva’s infringement,” lawyers for
Abbott contend in court papers.  The Abbott Park, Illinois-based drugmaker said in a
statement April 29 it received approval from the U.S. Food &
Drug Administration to sell the 1.62 percent prescription gel
formulation, used to treat adult men with hypogonadism, or lack
of testosterone.  The condition, affecting nearly 14 million U.S. men, can
result in hair loss, erectile dysfunction, decreased sexual
desire and depression, according to the statement.  The case is Abbott Products Inc. v. Teva Pharmaceuticals
USA Inc., 11-cv-384, U.S. District Court, District of  Delaware 
(Wilmington).  To see the patent, click: 6,503,894.  To contact the reporter on this story:
