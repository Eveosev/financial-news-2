Most stocks on the Bovespa index fell
after economists covering the Brazilian economy raised their
forecasts for  interest rates  and metals prices declined, dimming
the outlook for producers.  Consumer-goods company  Hypermarcas SA (HYPE3)  led declines by
companies that depend on domestic demand. Miners  Vale SA (VALE3)  and MMX
Mineracao & Metalicos SA followed metal prices lower.  The Bovespa was little changed at 66,129.01 at 10:27 a.m.
New York time. Forty stocks fell on the index, while 29
advanced. The real strengthened 0.3 percent to 1.5703 per  U.S.
dollar .  “There’s still concern the central bank is taking too long
to increase interest rates,” said Dany Rappaport, who helps
manage about 160 million reais ($101.9 million) at Investport in
Sao Paulo. “As inflation keeps rising, policy makers may be
forced to lift rates more steeply in the future.”  The central bank’s benchmark Selic rate will end the year
at 12.5 percent, compared with a week earlier forecast of 12.25
percent, according to an April 29 survey of about 100 economists
published today. Economists expect the rate to be 12 percent at
the end of 2012, from a week earlier forecast of 11.75 percent,
the survey found.  Copper fell to the lowest price in almost seven weeks after
an index of manufacturing declined in  China , the world’s biggest
user.  Hypermarcas fell 2.3 percent to 20.49 reais. Vale declined
0.5 percent to 45.85 reais, and MMX dropped 0.2 percent to 10.10
reais.  The Bovespa slumped 4.6 percent this year through last week
after declines in  oil companies , homebuilders and banks
outweighed a rally in telecom shares. The index trades at 10.6
times analysts’ earnings estimates, according to weekly data
compiled by Bloomberg. That compares to a ratio of 13.6 for the
Shanghai Composite Index, 7.3 for Russia’s Micex, and 15.2 for
India’s Sensex.  Investors pulled 3.71 billion reais from Latin America’s
biggest equity market this year through April 18, data from the
Sao Paulo exchange show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
