Al-Qaeda leader Osama  bin Laden ,
killed in a shootout with U.S. forces in Pakistan, was buried
today in the North Arabian Sea in a process that followed
Islamic traditions, U.S. officials said.  His body was washed, wrapped in white sheet and placed in
weighted bag for burial at sea, the officials said at a briefing
in  Washington , speaking on the condition that they not be named.  A U.S. military officer gave scripted religious remarks
before the body slid into the sea, they said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
