TNT NV (TNT) , the Dutch mail carrier that’s
spinning off its express division, said first-quarter profit
fell 14 percent as the former monopoly lost market share.  Net income dropped to 123 million euros ($182 million) from
143 million euros a year earlier, the Hoofddorp, Netherlands-
based company said in a statement. TNT restated the year-earlier
figures to include only businesses it plans to retain. Sales
rose 4.3 percent to 1.11 billion euros on that basis.  The mail business “performed in line with expectations,”
Chief Executive Officer Peter Bakker said in the statement.
“The necessary steps towards the separation of the mail and
express businesses have now been completed.”  TNT, which had a legal monopoly on letter delivery in its
home country until 2009, aims to eliminate 11,000 jobs as
customers turn increasingly to domestic competitors or e-mail.
The company reiterated today that it was bracing for an 8
percent to 10 percent full-year decline of its Dutch addressed
mail volumes.  TNT fell to its lowest price since July 2009, dropping as
much as 1.21 euros, or 7.3 percent, to 15.42 euros. The stock,
which has declined 19 percent this year, was down 3.8 percent at
10:15 a.m. in Amsterdam, valuing the company at 6.1 billion
euros.  Operating profit from the mail unit dropped 35 percent to
125 million euros as the volume of addressed mail fell 8.6
percent in the quarter, TNT said.  Express Loss  TNT began separating its two main businesses last year. The
Dutch mail operations will be renamed PostNL after completion of
their split from TNT Express,  Europe ’s second-largest express-
delivery service after  Deutsche Post AG (DPW) ’s DHL division.  The express unit, presented as discontinued operations,
posted a loss of 79 million euros, compared with an operating
profit of 59 million euros a year earlier, burdened by a non-
cash charge of 120 million euros related to restructuring in
 Brazil . The unit’s sales rose 6.6 percent to 1.8 billion euros.  TNT installed new management at express operations in
Brazil in March to end losses after a drop in delivery volume.
The company aims to turn around the Brazilian unit by no later
than the second half of 2012, TNT said today.  The express business may be sold within six months if a
public offer for the the shares TNT doesn’t own wins boardroom
support, the company said in an April 11  prospectus . Otherwise,
TNT has pledged to keep its remaining 29.9 percent stake in the
spun-off unit for at least that period.  Shares in the express unit are due to start trading in
Amsterdam after TNT shareholders approve the separation. The
company’s investors will meet on May 25.  To contact the reporter on this story:
