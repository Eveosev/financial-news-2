Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero will meet with ministers tomorrow to analyze
additional measures to ensure security after the killing of al-
Qaeda leader Osama  bin Laden .  Zapatero will meet with the defense and foreign ministers
and with Deputy Prime Minister Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba to
examine  Spain ’s security and may impose new measures without
raising the anti-terror alert level, Rubalcaba said. Spain has a
level 2 anti-terror alert on a scale of 4 levels, he said.  “Spain has a high-level anti-terror alert and we think
it’s enough to ensure security for Spanish citizens,” Rubalcaba
said in a press briefing in Madrid today. Some additional
specific security steps “could be taken” after at the meeting
tomorrow, he said.  Bin Laden, the architect of a radical Islamist movement
that killed almost 3,000 people on Sept. 11, 2001, was killed in
Pakistan yesterday after a decade on the run in a firefight with
a team of U.S. operatives who raided the compound where he had
been hiding.  To contact the reporter on this story:
