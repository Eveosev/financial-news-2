Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. is
claiming $500 million from  Barclays Plc (BARC)  for allegedly failing to
pay all of the bonuses the U.K. bank agreed to when it bought
the defunct investment firm’s North American business.  Lehman wrote a letter to U.S. Bankruptcy Judge James Peck
saying an opinion he wrote in February showed that Barclays
“breached its bonus payment obligations.” The letter was filed
in  U.S. Bankruptcy Court  in Manhattan on April 29.  Barclays has said it paid the full $2 billion it promised,
including non-bonus compensation. Peck issued the February
opinion in a lawsuit that Lehman lost seeking $11 billion from
Barclays over the deal.  Peck’s ruling, which followed a trial with more than 30
days of testimony, exonerated Barclays from having contrived to
make a “windfall” on the purchase as Lehman alleged. The
ruling left the two sides still fighting over what is owed to
whom.  Separately, the trustee for Lehman’s brokerage is in a
dispute with Barclays over $3.5 billion in assets after Peck
failed to specify how much Barclays was entitled to when it
bought the North American business in September 2008.  Michael O’Looney, a spokesman for London-based Barclays,
declined to comment.  The case is In re  Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ) , 08-13555,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of  New York 
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
