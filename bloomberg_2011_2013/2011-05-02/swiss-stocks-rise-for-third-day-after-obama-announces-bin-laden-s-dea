Swiss stocks rose to a two-month high
after U.S. President Barack Obama said al-Qaeda leader Osama bin
Laden was killed in Pakistan in a U.S. raid yesterday.  Swiss Re, the world’s second-largest reinsurer, and  Holcim
Ltd (HOLN) , the world’s second-biggest cement maker, led gains in the
benchmark Swiss Market Index, both rising 1 percent.  Clariant AG (CLN) 
rallied as Bank Vontobel AG recommended buying the stock.
 Actelion Ltd. (ATLN)  sank after a U.S. court awarded Asahi Kasei Pharma
Corp. up to $547 million in an ongoing litigation.  The Swiss Market Index of the biggest and most actively
traded companies added 0.3 percent to 6,558.66 at 10:04 a.m. in
Zurich. The gauge rose 2.9 percent in April as companies from
Ericsson AB to Volkswagen AG reported better-than-estimated
earnings and the  Federal Reserve  maintained its pledge to keep
 interest rates  low for an “extended period.” The broader Swiss
Performance Index also increased 0.3 percent to 6,030.75.  Bin Laden was killed by a team of U.S. operatives early
yesterday morning after a firefight at a house where he had been
hiding, Obama said. The President delivered the news to the
nation almost 10 years after the Sept. 11 attacks that bin Laden
orchestrated.  Swiss Re climbed 1 percent to 52.05 francs while Holcim
added 1 percent to 76.05 francs. Shares of drugmaker  Roche
Holding AG (ROG)  gained 0.9 percent to 141.6 francs.  Clariant AG gained 2.4 percent to 18.38 francs after
Vontobel upgraded the Swiss chemical maker’s shares to “buy”
from “hold.”  Actelion slumped 5.2 percent to 48.32 francs, the biggest
retreat in more than six months. “The company is disappointed,
but respectful of the jury‘s verdict in this ongoing
litigation,’’ Actelion said following the jury’s ruling. One of
its major shareholders criticized the handling of the company’s
disclosure among other reporting requirements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
