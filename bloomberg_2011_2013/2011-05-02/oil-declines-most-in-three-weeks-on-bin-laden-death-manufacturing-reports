Crude oil dropped for the first time
in four days after al-Qaeda leader Osama  bin Laden  was killed in
 Pakistan  and a report showed manufacturing cooled in April.  Oil declined 0.4 percent after President Barack Obama said
U.S. forces shot bin Laden yesterday. The Institute for Supply
Management’s manufacturing index declined last month and a
Chinese manufacturing measure dropped more than forecast.  “The market is taking some of the risk premium out of
it,” said  Tom Bentz , a broker with BNP Paribas Commodity
Futures Inc. in New York. “The manufacturing data came out and
oil and gasoline have pulled back a little bit. Certainly the
uptrend is slowing.”  Oil for June delivery fell 41 cents to settle at $113.52 a
barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . The contract rose
6.8 percent last month and settled at $113.93 on April 29, the
highest level since Sept. 22, 2008.  Gasoline futures for June delivery slipped 5.05 cents, or
1.5 percent, to $3.3479 a gallon on the Nymex.  Oil has climbed 32 percent in London and 24 percent in  New
York  this year as revolts that overthrew the governments in
Tunisia and Egypt raised concern that supplies from the Middle
East would be disrupted as protests spread.  Fighting between rebels and forces loyal to Libyan leader
 Muammar Qaddafi  has shut 1.3 million barrels a day of output in
the country that was Africa’s third-largest producer.  Bullish Trend  “We’ve been straight up in this bullish trend, and we’re
seeing some traders take off some of this length,” Bentz said.  The  S&P 500  fell 2.39 points to 1,361.22 after rising to
1,370.58. The dollar dropped 0.3 percent to $1.4846 per euro. It
touched $1.4902, the lowest level since Dec. 7, 2009.  Brent crude  for June settlement slid 77 cents, or 0.6
percent, to $125.12 a barrel on  London ’s ICE Futures Europe
Exchange.  The ISM’s manufacturing index declined to 60.4 last month
from 61.2 in March, the Tempe, Arizona-based group said today.
The April reading exceeded the 59.5 median forecast in a
Bloomberg News survey.  China ’s Purchasing Managers’ Index slipped to 52.9 from
53.4, the logistics federation and statistics bureau said
yesterday. That was below the median forecast of 53.9 in a
Bloomberg News survey of 20 economists.  The two countries are the world’s largest energy consumers.
Slowing economic growth and manufacturing can cool fuel demand.  Attacks on Oil  Al-Qaeda and bin Laden encouraged attacks on oil production
and distribution facilities as a way to damage the economies of
the U.S. and  Europe . In February 2006, Saudi Arabian security
guards foiled the group’s assault on the Abqaiq oil-processing
center in  Saudi Arabia , preventing disruption to exports from
the facility which handles two-thirds of the supply of the
world’s biggest producer.  “Now we have to worry about who is going to be running the
show as far as al-Qaeda is concerned and how it’s going to
affect the markets,” said  Richard Ilczyszyn , a market
strategist at Lind-Waldock, a broker in  Chicago . “It’s probably
going to increase oil’s volatility.”  Oil rose as much as 0.8 percent earlier amid concern that
bin Laden’s death may spur retaliatory attacks and disrupt
supplies.  “Though bin Laden is dead, al-Qaeda is not,” CIA Director
Leon Panetta, who oversaw the overnight mission to kill bin
Laden, said today in a statement sent to agency employees. “The
terrorists almost certainly will attempt to avenge him, and we
must, and will, remain vigilant and resolute.”  Rising production in  Russia , the world’s biggest oil
producer, may also help keep prices from increasing.  Russian Production  Russia pumped 10.24 million barrels a day of crude oil last
month, according to statistics released today by the Energy
Ministry’s CDU-TEK data unit, up 1.6 percent from April 2010.
The country produced 10.2 million barrels a day in March,
according to revised figures from the data unit.  Hedge funds and other traders raised their bullish bets on
oil to the highest level in three weeks last week. Net-long
positions in oil increased by 11,202 futures and options
combined, or 3.9 percent, to 301,118, in the week ended April
26, according to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s
Commitments of Traders report. The level peaked at 311,632 in
the week ended March 8.  Oil volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was 465,088
contracts as of 4:59 p.m. in New York. Volume totaled 366,674
contracts on April 29, 51 percent below the average of the past
three months. Open interest was a record 1.608 million
contracts, surpassing the previous high of 1.606 million set
March 11, said Chris Grams, a Nymex spokesman, in an e-mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
