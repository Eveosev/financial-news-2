A unit of commodity trader Louis
Dreyfus Corp. took delivery of raw sugar to settle expiring New
York futures contracts with  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  and  BNP Paribas (BNP) 
Commodity Futures Inc., exchange data show  Term Commodities Inc., a Louis Dreyfus unit, accepted
delivery on 17,603 contracts, or about 894,232 metric tons of
sugar, ICE Futures U.S. said today in a statement on its
 website . The deliveries were from ports in Thailand and  Brazil .  Sugar futures have plunged 32 percent this year, the most
among 19 raw materials in the Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB
Index. Output in Thailand, the world’s biggest exporter after
Brazil, may rise to a record this year. In February, the
commodity jumped to a 30-year high of 36.08 cents a pound as
global production lagged behind demand.  “This shows that there is an abundance of Thai crop, and
there will be no supply issues even if there is a delay in the
Brazil harvest,” said  Michael McDougall , a senior vice
president at Newedge USA in New York. Most of the delivered
sugar usually comes from Brazil, McDougall said.  Raw-sugar futures for July delivery declined 0.36 cent, or
1.6 percent, to 21.89 cents at 1:46 p.m. on ICE. A decline today
would be the sixth straight, capping the longest slide since
March 2009.  Last month, Cargill Inc. took delivery of almost 1 million
tons of raw sugar, the most for the commodity since 2009,
exchange data show.  Jennifer Zuccarelli , a JPMorgan spokeswoman, declined to
comment. JPMorgan is the second-largest U.S. bank by assets.  Term Commodities also declined to comment. The BNP Paribas
London office is closed today for a holiday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
