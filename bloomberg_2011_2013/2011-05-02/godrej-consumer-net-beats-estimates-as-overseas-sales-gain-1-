Godrej Consumer Products Ltd. (GCPL) , an
Indian maker of soaps and detergents, reported a 55 percent
increase in fourth-quarter profit, beating analyst estimates,
after acquisitions boosted overseas sales.  Net income rose to 1.42 billion rupees ($32 million) in the
three months ended March 31, from 917.6 million rupees a year
earlier, the company said in a statement to the Bombay Stock
Exchange today. That exceeded the 1.24 billion-rupee average of
13 analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Sales almost
doubled to 10 billion rupees.  Godrej Consumer, controlled by billionaire Adi Godrej,
plans to buy more companies in  Asia , Africa and  Latin America ,
Managing Director A. Mahendran said on April 16. The share of
overseas sales increased to 35 percent in the year ended in
March after the acquisition of at least five companies,
including Indonesian insecticide maker PT Megasari Makmur.  Godrej climbed 4.3 percent to 392.45 rupees at the 3:30
p.m. close in Mumbai trading, the stock’s highest since Jan. 24.
The shares have gained 1.4 percent this year, compared with a
7.4 percent decline in the benchmark Sensitive Index of the
Bombay Stock Exchange.  “The macroeconomic environment is strong,” Chairman
Godrej said in the statement. “We continue to explore
opportunities to strengthen our presence and competitive
position in the home care, personal wash and hair care space.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
