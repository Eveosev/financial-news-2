Aareal Bank AG (ARL) , the German commercial-
property lender that tapped the Soffin bank-rescue fund, said it
raised 269.6 million euros ($400 million) in a rights offer to
help repay the bailout aid as well as finance new business.  Some 99.7 percent of the 17.1 million new common bearer
shares offered in the capital increase were bought by entitled
share holders, the Wiesbaden-based bank said today in an e-
mailed statement. The stake in the bank of investors linked to
the Aareal Holding Verwaltungsgesellschaft mbHâ€™s declined to
28.9 percent after the capital increase, the company added.  In announcing the capital increase on April 14, the bank
said it may use 75 million euros ($111.5 million) of the cash to
repay non-voting capital from the government bank rescue fund.
It also plans the early redemption of a 2 billion-euro bond that
is guaranteed by that fund.  Aareal started repaying the participations in June as
property markets recovered. Financial companies are boosting
capital as they prepare for a second round of European stress
tests this year. Aareal aims to use part of the cash raised to
finance growth at its structured property finance unit and
strengthen its equity base, it said on April 14.  To contact the reporters on this story:
