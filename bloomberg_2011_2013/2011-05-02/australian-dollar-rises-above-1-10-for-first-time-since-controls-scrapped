The Australian and  New Zealand  dollars
erased their declines against the greenback that came after U.S.
President  Barack Obama  said Osama bin Laden had been killed.  The South Pacific nations’ currencies fell earlier as the
 U.S. dollar  rallied on a gain in American stock-index futures
following Obama’s statement. The Aussie and kiwi later
fluctuated as U.S. equities reversed their gains.  The Australian dollar was little changed at $1.0967 at 1:43
p.m. in New York, compared with $1.0971 on April 29, after
earlier dropping 0.5 percent. The Aussie also touched $1.1012,
the highest level since it began trading freely in 1983. New
Zealand’s currency traded at 80.94 U.S. cents, compared with
80.99, after earlier reaching 81.22, the highest level since
March 2008.  Bin Laden  was killed by U.S. forces during a gun battle
outside Islamabad, the capital of Pakistan, Obama said
yesterday. The president said he authorized the attack after he
determined last week there was enough intelligence to act.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index was little changed after
rising as much as 0.5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
