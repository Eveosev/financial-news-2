U.S. taxpayers received $13.1 billion
in proceeds from the government’s wind-down of its mortgage-
backed securities last month, the Treasury Department said.  Through the end of April, taxpayers received a total of
$120.9 billion through sales and principal and interest
payments,  Mary Miller , the Treasury’s assistant secretary for
financial markets, said in a statement today. The Treasury’s
original investment in mortgage-backed securities was $225
billion.  Beginning June 1, the Treasury will publish a monthly
report on broker-dealer market share for the mortgage-backed
securities sales, Miller said in the statement.  “We believe that the publication of this scorecard will
help both maximize taxpayer returns and provide additional
transparency,” Miller said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
