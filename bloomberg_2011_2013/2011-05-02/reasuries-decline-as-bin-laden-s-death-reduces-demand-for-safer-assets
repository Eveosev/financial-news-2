Treasury yields traded at almost six-
week lows as a report showed U.S. manufacturing grew in April at
a slower pace than the previous month, reinforcing concern the
economic recovery will be gradual.  The U.S. 10-year note yield, which declined in April by the
most since August, touched lows as the  Federal Reserve   purchased 
$7.24 billion of Treasuries due from May 2018 to February 2021
today as part of its debt-buying program. Speculation about
terrorist attacks after  Osama bin Laden  died in a firefight in
 Pakistan  also boosted demand for Treasuries after yields rose
earlier on the news. The dollar dropped to a 16-month low
against the euro.  “The weak economy is helping the bid,” said  Michael Franzese , managing director and head of Treasury trading at
Wunderlich Securities Inc. in New York. “With so much money
sloshing around with the weak dollar, people are putting it in
Treasuries. If we took out the head of al-Qaeda, the assumption
is that there may be reprisals and you want to be prepared for
that.”  Yields on 10-year notes fell one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 3.28 percent at 5:11 p.m. in  New York ,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices, after rising as much
as three basis points. The 3.625 percent note due in February
2021 rose 3/32, or 94 cents per $1,000 face amount, to 102
28/32.  Bin Laden Report  President  Barack Obama  delivered the news of bin Laden’s
killing in a late-night televised address from the White House
almost 10 years after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks the al-Qaeda
leader orchestrated.  Ten-year note yields dropped 18 basis points in April and
earlier today touched 3.262 percent, the lowest since March 18.
Yields on two-year notes were little changed at 0.6 percent,
after falling 22 basis points last month, the most since a
decrease of 32 basis points in January 2010. The yield today
touched 0.59 percent, the lowest since March 21.  The  Institute for Supply Management ’s manufacturing index
fell to 60.4 in April from 61.2 a month earlier, the Tempe,
Arizona-based group said today. Figures greater than 50 signal
expansion. The median forecast of 78 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News was 59.5. Estimates ranged from 57.5 to 62.  “This economy still needs a lot of stimulus to continue
growing,”  Mohamed A. El-Erian , chief executive officer of
Pacific Investment Management Co, manager of the world’s biggest
bond fund, said in an interview on Bloomberg Television’s “Fast
Forward” with Willow Bay. “We now need high quality growth,
not borrowed growth.”  Fiscal Situation  News of bin Laden’s death comes as President Obama’s
Democrats struggle to find common ground with opposition
Republicans on how to reduce the fiscal deficit.  U.S. government debt  has more than doubled since those
attacks to $14.3 trillion, partly due to spending on military
actions in Afghanistan and  Iraq . Almost 3,000 people were killed
at the World Trade Center in New York, the Pentagon in suburban
Washington and a field in  Pennsylvania  where hijacked United
Airlines Flight 93 crashed.  The rate on six-month bills today dropped to a record low
of 0.895 percent. The Treasury cut the amount of Supplementary
Financing Program bills, or SFPs, it sells on behalf of the Fed
by $195 billion to help avoid exceeding the U.S. debt limit.
Congress is facing a vote as early as this month on raising the
$14.3 trillion debt ceiling.  Borrowing Estimate  The U.S. Treasury Department lowered its estimate for
 government borrowing  from April through June because of higher
revenue and reduced  government spending .  Borrowing will total a net $142 billion in the current
quarter, that is $156 billion less than estimated three months
ago, the department said in a statement today in  Washington . The
Treasury also projected borrowing of $405 billion in the three
months to Sept. 30. In the quarter that ended March 31, the
Treasury borrowed $265 billion, compared with a previous
estimate of $237 billion.  The Treasury’s quarterly debt sales announcement is
scheduled for May 4.  The Treasury will probably keep the total of next week’s
auctions of three-, 10- and 30-year securities at $72 billion as
the government approaches its debt limit, primary dealers
forecast.  Debt Auctions  The U.S. will sell $32 billion of three-year notes, $24
billion of 10-year debt and $16 billion of 30-year bonds next
week, according to 14 primary dealers, which are required to bid
in Treasury auctions. The amounts are the same as the grouping
of auctions of these maturities in February.  Treasuries have outperformed German  government bonds  this
year, returning 1.2 percent compared with a 1.5 percent loss
from German securities, according to indexes compiled by the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies and
Bloomberg.  Treasuries returned 1.15 percent in April, after producing
a loss of 0.1 percent during March, according to Bank of America
Merrill Lynch data.  The dollar depreciated 0.3 percent to $1.4846 in New York,
from $1.4807 on April 29, and touched $1.4902, the weakest level
since Dec. 7, 2009.  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  signaled on April 27 in his
first press conference following a policy decision that the
central bank will likely continue reinvesting maturing debt
after its $600 billion program of bond buying under quantitative
easing expires in June as scheduled.  To contact the reporter on this story:
