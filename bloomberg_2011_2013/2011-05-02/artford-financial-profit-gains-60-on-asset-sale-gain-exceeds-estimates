Hartford Financial Services Group
Inc. (HIG) , the insurer that counts  John Paulson ’s hedge fund as its
largest shareholder, said first-quarter profit increased 60
percent on the sale of a claims-administration business.  Hartford booked a $61 million gain tied to U.S. stock-
market advances and a weakened yen. Net income rose to $511
million from $319 million a year earlier, the Hartford,
Connecticut-based company said today in a statement. Operating
profit, which excludes some investment results, was $1.16 a
share, beating the 95-cent average estimate of 16 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg.  Hartford boosted its dividend this year after selling stock
and debt in 2010 to repay a $3.4 billion rescue from the
Troubled Asset Relief Program. The insurer had more than $4
billion in losses in the five quarters before Chief Executive
Officer  Liam McGee  joined the firm in October 2009.  “We are delivering more stable and consistent financial
and operating performance,” McGee said in the statement.  Hartford jumped as much as 4.7 percent to $30.18 after the
earnings announcement, then fell back to $28.78 at 6:40 p.m. in
extended New York trading. It had climbed about 8.8 percent this
year through today’s close, compared with a 5.3 percent gain for
the  KBW Insurance Index. (KIX)   The insurer booked a $150 million gain from the sale of
Specialty Risk Services LLC, a claims-administration business,
to Sedgwick Claims Management Services Inc. The sale was part of
a strategy to focus the company on “core protection and wealth-
management businesses,” McGee said in a statement announcing
the sale on Dec. 20.  Yen, Stocks  Hartford’s $61 million accounting gain reflected a
weakening yen and the advance of securities that back retirement
products the firm sold in previous quarters. The yen weakened
2.4 percent against the dollar as the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index rose 5.4 percent.  Net income per share was $1.01, compared with a loss of 42
cents a year earlier, when the insurer booked a $440 million
charge related to a repurchase of preferred shares the
government received in the firm’s bailout.  Book value, a measure of assets minus liabilities, rose to
$45.93 a share from $44.44 at year-end. The net realized loss
widened to $237 million from $225 million a year earlier.  The commercial markets segment, which provides property-
casualty coverage and benefit plans to businesses, added $200
million to profit, compared with $290 million a year earlier.
Profit at consumer markets, the business that provides auto and
homeowners coverage to individuals, rose to $113 million from
$63 million.  Wealth Management   Wealth management, the division that sells life insurance
and annuities, had a gain of $329 million compared with $295
million a year earlier.  Chief Investment Officer Gregory McGreevey said in February
he’s expanding direct whole-loan investments for commercial real
estate, after slashing the holdings during the market slump. The
firm is focusing on industrial properties and expects to find
opportunities in the U.S. Midwest, he said.  Paulson & Co. had a stake of about 9.9 percent in the
insurer as of Dec. 31, with most of the stock acquired last
year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  John Paulson’s estimated earnings of $4.9 billion in 2010
made him the highest paid hedge-fund manager for the year,
according to AR Magazine. His hedge fund made $15 billion during
the credit crisis by betting the U.S. housing market would
collapse because of losses tied to subprime mortgages.  To contact the reporter on this story:
