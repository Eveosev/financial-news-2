Cash premiums for corn shipped in May
to terminals near  New Orleans  fell relative to Chicago futures
as export demand slowed and high river waters slowed shipments.
The soybean basis was steady.  The spot-basis bid, or premium, for corn delivered this
month was at 55 cents to 59 cents a bushel above July futures,
down from 55 cents to 61 cents on April 29, U.S. Department of
Agriculture  data  show. Soybeans basis bids were unchanged 64
cents to 70 cents a bushel above May futures.  “It’s a combination of reduced export demand and river
flooding increasing uncertainty about barge shipment-
schedules,” said Tim Emslie, the research manager for Country
Hedging Inc. in Inver Grove Heights,  Minnesota . “The market
will be focused on weather and planting progress the next three
weeks.”  Corn futures for July delivery fell 22 cents, or 2.9
percent, to close at $7.345 a bushel on the Chicago Board of
Trade. Soybean futures for May delivery dropped 2.5 cents, or
0.2 percent, to close at $13.9025 a bushel on the CBOT.  To contact the reporter on this story:
