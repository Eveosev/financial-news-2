Finance ministers from the Association
of Southeast Asian Nations, plus Japan, China and  South Korea ,
plan to discuss ways to prevent a financial crisis when they
meet this week in Hanoi, Vietnam.  The policy makers, meeting on May 4 ahead of the Asia
Development Bank annual conference on May 5 and 6, will seek to
strengthen the region’s financial safety net through cooperation
between Asia’s foreign-currency reserve pool and the
 International Monetary Fund , South Korea’s finance ministry said
in an e-mailed statement today.  The ministers will also talk about ways to boost an
initiative to develop Asia’s bond markets, so that member
nations are less vulnerable to capital outflows that are
possible when short-term debt from overseas funding long-term
projects, it said.  Policy makers and heads of financial institutions from 67
nations will discuss inflation and other challenges facing the
region, when they meet for the ADB annual meeting in  Hanoi , the
