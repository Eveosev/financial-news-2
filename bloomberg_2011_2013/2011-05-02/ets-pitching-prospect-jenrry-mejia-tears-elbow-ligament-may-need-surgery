Jenrry Mejia, rated the top prospect
in the New York Mets organization by Baseball America, tore a
ligament in his throwing elbow and may take almost a year to
recover.  Mejia, 21, was diagnosed with a complete tear of the medial
collateral ligament in his right elbow after testing today at
the  Hospital for Special Surgery  in  Manhattan , the Major League
Baseball team said today in an e-mailed statement.  Mejia left his April 29 start with the Mets’ Triple-A
affiliate, the  Buffalo Bisons , after four innings with
discomfort in his throwing arm. He was 1-2 with a 2.86 earned
run average in five starts with the Bisons before the injury. He
was 0-4 with a 4.62 earned run average in 33 games for the Mets
last year, working mostly out of the bullpen.  The ligament can be reconstructed with Tommy John surgery,
when it is replaced by one from elsewhere in the body, according
to the hospital’s  website . Recovery from the surgery takes about
11 months. Mejia will seek a second opinion before committing to
surgery, the team said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
