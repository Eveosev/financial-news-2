German  Chancellor Angela Merkel  plans
to stop using nuclear power in  Germany  possibly before 2022,
 Handelsblatt  reported, citing unidentified people familiar with
government discussions.  Merkel, in talks with German Environment Minister Norbert Roettgen and Chief of Staff Ronald Pofalla, agreed to set a
fixed deadline for closing nuclear power plants, the newspaper
said.  Under the current system, power plants must be shut down
after they produced a certain amount of electricity, allowing
operators to delay closure until as long as 2022 or 2023, the
newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
