     May 2 (Bloomberg) --  E.ON AG (EOAN)  has raised power output from
coal- and natural-gas fired power plants and delayed planned
maintenance at its facilities to help avoid electricity
shortages in  Germany , WirtschaftsWoche said, citing Chief
Executive OfficerJohannes Teyssen.  The CEO declined to say which plants the countryâ€™s grid
operators have asked the utility to run irregularly because it
could put Dusseldorf, Germany-based E.ON at a disadvantage in
the power market, the news magazine reported, citing an
interview.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
