Chinese Premier  Wen Jiabao  reiterated
the nation’s plan to keep real estate prices stable during a
visit yesterday to low-income housing construction sites in
Beijing, the official Xinhua News Agency reported today.  “We are determined to bring down the high-flying housing
prices in some cities and make sure that the prices of housing
can return to a reasonable level,” Xinhua cited Wen as saying.
“Our determination is unswerving that special care is given to
needy and low-income families and to make sure they can afford
housing.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
