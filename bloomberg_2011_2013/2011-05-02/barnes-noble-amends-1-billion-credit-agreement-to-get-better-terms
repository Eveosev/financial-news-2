Barnes & Noble Inc. (BKS) , the largest U.S.
bookstore chain, lowered borrowing costs on an existing $1
billion credit line and extended the debt’s due date.  Barnes & Noble, based in New York, amended its revolving
credit agreement to reduce interest costs and push out the
maturity date to April 29, 2016, from Sept. 29, 2013, the
company said today in a statement distributed by  Business Wire .
The retailer also said it obtained “greater financial
flexibility” from lenders.  “The banking market is more favorable today than when we
did the facility over a year and a half ago,” Chief Financial
Officer Joseph Lombardi said in a telephone interview.  The amended revolver includes a $915 million portion that
pays lenders 2.25 percentage points to 2.75 percentage points
more than the London interbank offered rate; and an $85 million
piece that charges 3.75 percentage points to 4.25 percentage
points more than Libor, he said. Libor is a rate that banks
charge to lend to each other.  The asset-based  credit line  previously paid 375 basis
points more than Libor, Lombardi said. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point.  Bank of America Merrill Lynch, JPMorgan Chase & Co.,  Wells
Fargo & Co ., and SunTrust Robinson Humphrey Inc. led the
financing.  Beginning in fiscal 2012, Barnes & Noble expects to reduce
interest expense by $10.6 million annually because of the lower
borrowing costs and reduced amortization of deferred financing
fees, according to the statement.  As of April 30, the end of its fiscal 2011 calendar, Barnes
& Noble had $313 million of outstanding borrowings under the
revolver, the company said.  In a revolving credit facility, money can be borrowed again
once it’s repaid.  To contact the reporter on this story:
