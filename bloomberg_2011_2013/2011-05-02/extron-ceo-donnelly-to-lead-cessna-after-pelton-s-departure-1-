Textron Inc. (TXT)  said Chief Executive
Officer Scott Donnelly will run the company’s Cessna Aircraft
unit until a replacement is found for Jack Pelton, who has
retired as the planemaker’s president.  Pelton joined Wichita, Kansas-based Cessna in November 2000
and was named its president and CEO in 2003, Textron said today
in a statement. When orders collapsed amid the recession, he cut
production and slashed the workforce in half.  The planemaker “can do better in terms of driving
productivity,” Donnelly said on an April 20 conference call
after the unit reported a $38 million operating loss for the
first three months of the year and said its backlog had declined
over the quarter. “We have taken a number of actions over the
past couple years at Cessna, but clearly have more to do.”  Providence, Rhode Island-based Textron also builds Bell
helicopters, E-Z-GO golf carts, Greenlee tools and Kautex
plastic fuel systems.  To contact the reporters on this story:
