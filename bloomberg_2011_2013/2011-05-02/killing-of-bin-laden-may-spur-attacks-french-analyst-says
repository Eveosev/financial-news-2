Osama  bin Laden ’s death won’t bring an
end to terror attacks, even if the al-Qaeda movement has now
lost its “spiritual father,” said Anne Giudicelli, a former
French diplomat who runs  Terrorisc , a risk advisory company.  “It doesn’t change much on the ground, even if it has a
symbolic importance,” Giudicelli said in a telephone interview.
“There has been such a process of decentralization within the
movement that operations are now all local.”  “Osama bin Laden was at the head of an ideological
movement, but he no longer had the central role in planning
operations that he had until 2001. Groups like al-Qaeda in the
Maghreb and in Yemen have lost a spiritual father, but their
actions go on independently,” Giudicelli said. “This death may
even give them new impetus and new justifications to carry out
attacks.”  Bin Laden, the mastermind of the Sept. 11, 2001, terror
attacks on the U.S., was killed yesterday by U.S. special forces
in  Pakistan .  To contact the reporter on this story:
