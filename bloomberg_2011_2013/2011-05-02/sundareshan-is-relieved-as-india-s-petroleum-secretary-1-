S. Sundareshan,  India ’s oil secretary
for the last 15 months, said he is moving as the top bureaucrat
in the government’s heavy industries department.  Sundareshan, 58, received his transfer order today and has
been “relieved” of his duties at the  oil ministry , he said by
telephone in  New Delhi  today.  G.C. Chaturvedi, a special director general in India’s
Commonwealth Games organizing committee, may be appointed oil
secretary, the Business Standard reported today, without saying
where it got the information. Two calls to Oil Minister S. Jaipal Reddy’s office seeking comments were unanswered.  Sundareshan was appointed oil secretary in January 2010,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. In that capacity, he
was also the chairman of  Petronet LNG Ltd. (PLNG) , India’s biggest
importer of liquefied natural gas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
