Saudi Electricity Co. (SECO) , the kingdom’s
largest utility, selected  General Electric Co. (GE)  to help expand
four  power plants  in contracts valued at more than $500 million.  GE will supply gas-turbine technology and services for the
projects, which will meet half of Saudi Electricity’s targeted
increase in annual output, the U.S. company said in an e-mailed
statement today.  “These fast-tracked plant expansions are designed to meet
peak summer demands,” Saudi Electricity’s Chief Executive
Officer Ali al-Barrak said in the statement.  Saudi Arabia  will need to spend $100 billion in this decade
to boost power-generation capacity by 50 percent, the country’s
Deputy Minister for Electricity at the Ministry of Water Saleh
al-Awaji said on March 28. Domestic electricity demand has grown
at a rate of about 6 percent a year, according to the statement.  Plant expansions at Qurayyah, Qassim and near the cities of
Riyadh and Tabouk will add 1,680 megawatts of power to the
national grid, more than half of Saudi Electricity’s planned
annual increase of 3,000 megawatts, the statement said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
