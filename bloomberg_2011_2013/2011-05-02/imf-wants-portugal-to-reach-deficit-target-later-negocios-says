The  International Monetary Fund  wants
Portugal to reduce its budget deficit to 3 percent of gross
domestic product in 2015, later than the  Portuguese government 
had forecast, Jornal de Negocios reported, citing unidentified
people.  The European Union considers that reaching that deficit
target in 2013 or 2014 already gives Portugal enough time to
carry out the “necessary adjustment,” according to the
Portuguese newspaper. The Portuguese government had aimed to
narrow its deficit to 3 percent of GDP in 2012.      Officials of the IMF, European Commission and European
Central Bank are preparing an aid plan for Portugal following
the government’s April 6 request for financial assistance.  Click here for web link  To contact the reporter on this story:
