India ’s manufacturing grew at the
fastest pace in five months and exports climbed to a record,
increasing pressure on the central bank to raise  interest rates 
for the ninth time since the start of 2010.  The Purchasing Managers’ Index rose to 58 in April from
57.9 in March, HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics said in an
e-mail today. A number above 50 indicates expansion. India’s
merchandise exports surged 44 percent to a record $29 billion in
March from a year earlier, the commerce ministry said in an e-
mailed statement today.  The Reserve Bank of India may lift its benchmark repurchase
rate to 7 percent from 6.75 percent, according to 18 of 25
economists in a Bloomberg News survey ahead of the monetary
policy announcement tomorrow. The remaining seven including HSBC
Group Plc predict a half percentage-point move to curb India’s
inflation, which is the highest among the so-called BRICS
nations after  Russia .  “The main worry is the building up of demand side
pressures in the economy,”  Vishnu Varathan , an economist at
 Capital Economics  ( Asia ) Pte. in Singapore, said before the
report. “A rate hike tomorrow is a done deal.”  Overseas sales from India for the year through March 2011
rose 37.5 percent to $245.9 billion, the commerce ministry
statement showed. Imports in March rose 17.3 percent to $34.7
billion.  Stocks Fall  The Bombay Stock Exchange’s Sensitive Index fell 0.7
percent at 12:36 p.m. in Mumbai, while the yield on the 7.8
percent bond due in April 2021 gained one basis point to 8.14
percent. The rupee fell 0.2 percent to 44.28 per dollar.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Standard Chartered Plc and
Barclays Plc have raised their forecast for rate increases in
India this year after the nation’s benchmark wholesale-price
inflation quickened to 8.98 percent in March, more than the
 Reserve Bank ’s 8 percent estimate.  In  China , the Purchasing Managers’ Index fell to 52.9 in
April from 53.4 in March, according to China’s logistics
federation and the statistics bureau, after the government
boosted rates and lenders’ reserve requirements and allowed
gains in the yuan to pick up pace.  Inflation in China quickened to 5.4 percent in March.
Consumer prices rose 9.5 percent in Russia, 6.3 percent in
 Brazil  and 4.1 percent in  South Africa .  Eight Moves  The Reserve Bank has boosted rates by 200 basis points
since mid-March 2010 in eight moves.  “The strong manufacturing PMI numbers are testament to the
resilience of growth in the face of policy tightening and high
inflation,” Leif Eskesen, Singapore-based chief economist at
HSBC Holdings, said in today’s statement. “Growth is holding up
well but this is also pushing up inflation. RBI tightening will
have to continue.”  Manufactured products inflation in India accelerated to
6.21 percent in March, an 11-month high, according to government
data.  Rising demand for motorcycles and bank loans provides
evidence of growing consumption in the South Asian nation.  Sales at  Hero Honda Motors Ltd. (HH) , India’s largest motorcycle
maker, jumped 24.4 percent in March from the same month a year
earlier, the company said on April 1. Commercial loans rose 22
percent in the two weeks to April 8 from a year earlier, above
the 20 percent rate prescribed by the Reserve Bank.  Goldman Sachs estimates the Reserve Bank will probably
increase rates by another 1.25 percentage points in 2011, more
than the half-point increase predicted earlier. Standard
Chartered forecast on April 18 the repurchase rate will rise by
1 percentage point in six months, while Barclays predicted a 75-
basis point increase, compared with original calls of 50 basis
points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
