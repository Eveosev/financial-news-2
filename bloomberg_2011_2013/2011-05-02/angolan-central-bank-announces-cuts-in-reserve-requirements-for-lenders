Angola  reduced the amount of assets
commercial banks must keep at the central bank to boost
liquidity and lending, Banco Nacional de Angola said.  The amount of funds that must be kept at the central bank
was lowered to 20 percent of deposits from 25 percent
previously, the Luanda-based bank said on its website on April
29. The policy comes into effect tomorrow and bank compliance
will start on May 9, it said.  The reserves can be kept in kwanza or foreign currencies,
the bank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
