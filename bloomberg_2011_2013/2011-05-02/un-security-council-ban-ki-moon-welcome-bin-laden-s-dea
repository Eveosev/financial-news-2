The  United Nations   Security Council 
applauded the news of Osama bin Laden’s death, which Secretary-
General Ban Ki-moon called a  “watershed moment” in the fight
against global terrorism.  “The  Security Council  welcomes the news on May 1, 2011,
that Osama bin Laden will never again be able to perpetrate”
acts of terrorism, the statement by the UN’s principal policy-
making panel said today.  The statement, drafted by the U.S., was read in the
Security Council chamber by Ambassador  Gerard Araud  of France,
which holds the rotating presidency of the panel this month. The
statement said bin Laden’s demise was a “critical development”
in the fight against terrorism.  The council said that “terrorism will not be defeated by
military force, law enforcement measures and intelligence
operations alone,” citing the need to address the “conditions
conducive to the spread of terrorism.”  Ban, in a statement at UN headquarters in  New York , said
the “crimes of al-Qaeda touched most continents, bringing
tragedy and loss of life to thousands of men, women and
children. I am very much relieved by the news that justice has
been done to such a mastermind of international terrorism.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
