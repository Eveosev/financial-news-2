Swiss Life Holding AG (SLHN) ,  Switzerland â€™s
biggest life insurer, may say first-quarter premiums dropped 10
percent after selling fewer insurance wrappers.  Gross written premiums probably fell to 7.08 billion Swiss
francs ($8.16 billion) from 7.87 billion francs a year earlier,
according to the median estimate of five analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg. The Zurich-based insurer is due to release first-
quarter earnings tomorrow at 7 a.m. local time.  Swiss Life is more than three-quarters through a program to
reduce costs by as much as 400 million francs. The insurer plans
to cut its reliance on investment income by boosting earnings
from AWD Holding AG, the German financial-services broker
acquired in 2008, and from its business selling life products,
known as wrappers, to wealthy clients via units in Luxembourg,
Liechtenstein and  Singapore .  Premiums at the unit selling wrappers dropped 45 percent to
939 million francs after the Italian tax amnesty, which ended on
April 30, 2010, boosted sales in the year-earlier period.  The following is a table of the median analyst estimates
and year-earlier figures in millions of francs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
