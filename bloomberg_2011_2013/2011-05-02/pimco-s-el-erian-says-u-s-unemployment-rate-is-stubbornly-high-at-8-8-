Mohamed A. El-Erian, chief executive
officer of Pacific Investment Management Co., said U.S.
joblessness remains elevated, even after declining to a two-year
low in March.  “Unemployment is stubbornly high and has become much more
structural in nature,” El-Erian said today during a panel
discussion at the Milken Institute Global Conference in Beverly
Hills, California. The  unemployment rate  unexpectedly dropped to
8.8 percent in March from 8.9 percent in February, the fourth
straight decrease.  El-Erian, who helps oversee the world’s largest bond fund,
gave four reasons constraining an improvement in the global
economy.  Oil prices , which settled at the highest price since
2008 on April 29, are too elevated, and housing markets haven’t
sufficiently stabilized, he said.  Europe  hasn’t solved its debt
crisis, and world leaders are concerned that U.S. politicians
are “arguing too much,” he said.  “Different sections of the orchestra are playing a
different tune and it sounds confusing,” El-Erian said.  El-Erian, 52, who promulgated the term “the new normal”
to describe the post-financial crisis economy, used a
disorganized orchestra as a metaphor to describe the global
economic environment, with different regions, governments and
industries playing various styles of music at dissimilar speeds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
