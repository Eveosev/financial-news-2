Plains All American Pipeline LP (PAA)  is
operating a southbound portion of its Rainbow crude-oil pipeline
from Nipisi to  Edmonton  in Alberta, Canada, Roy Lamoreaux, a
spokesman for the company, said in an e-mail.  The segment typically has volumes of about 50 percent of
Rainbowâ€™s daily volume, he said. The Rainbow pipeline averaged
187,000 barrels in 2010, according to Lamoreaux.  Another portion of the line was shut April 29 after a leak
north of Peace River in Alberta, the Energy Resources
Conservation Board, said last week.  Oil collection at the site began late yesterday and
continued throughout the night, according to an update on the
Plains  website .  The 220,000-barrel-a-day Rainbow pipeline transports crude
oil from Rainbow Lake in northern Alberta to Edmonton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
