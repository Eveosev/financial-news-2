Ronny Paulino’s run-scoring double in
the 14th inning helped the  New York Mets  beat the Philadelphia
Phillies 2-1 and avoid a three-game series sweep.  Paulino had five hits in his first start of the Major
League Baseball season as the Mets snapped a three-game losing
streak. The game lasted 4 hours, 44 minutes and ended at 12:43
a.m. local time at Citizens Bank Park in Philadelphia.  At 14 innings, it matched the longest MLB game this season,
ESPN said during its broadcast.  Carlos Beltran  drove in the Mets’ other run and Taylor Buchholz pitched two scoreless innings for the victory.  Ryan Howard’s eighth-inning single drove in the lone run
for the Phillies (18-9), who had set a team-record by winning 18
games during the month of April.  To contact the reporter on this story:
