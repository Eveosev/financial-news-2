Carl Lewis, the Olympic gold medalist
seeking a  New Jersey  state senate seat, failed to persuade a
state appeals court panel to block the printing of primary
election ballots without his name.  The three-judge panel ruled today that Secretary of State
Kim Guadagno properly decided April 26 that Lewis, a 49-year-old
Democrat, was ineligible because he didn’t meet the state’s
four-year residency requirement. On April 29, a federal judge
ruled against Lewis, saying he would not second guess Guadagno.
The state panel today also upheld Guadagno.  “We will reverse an agency’s judgment, if we find that the
agency’s decision is ‘arbitrary, capricious, or unreasonable,”
ruled the panel. “We conclude that the secretary’s decision was
supported by adequate evidence in the record that appellant was
not domiciled in New Jersey for the past four years.”  Lewis, who grew up in New Jersey before moving to  Texas  and
then  California , sought the 8th District seat in the June 7
primary. He competed for the U.S. in four Olympics as a sprinter
and long jumper, winning nine gold medals.  He had argued that he bought a house in New Jersey in 2005,
which made him a state resident. Guadagno disagreed, saying the
record showed he didn’t buy his current home until Nov. 16,
2007, or eight days after the cutoff.  Lewis attorney William Tambussi didn’t immediately return a
call seeking comment.  The case is Layton and Costa v. Lewis, A-4047-10T1,
Superior Court of New Jersey, Appellate Division (Trenton).  To contact the reporter on this story:
