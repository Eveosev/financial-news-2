The number of Americans receiving  food
stamps  rose to a record 44.199 million in February, up from
44.188 million in the previous month, the government said.  Recipients of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program
subsidies for food purchases jumped 12 percent from a year
earlier, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said today in a
 statement  on its website. Participation has set records every
month since December 2008. Increases have slowed in recent
months as unemployment levels declined.  To contact the reporter on this story:
