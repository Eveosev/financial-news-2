Former Chicago Bears safety Dave Duerson, who killed himself in February, had traumatic  brain
damage , according to tests done by the Boston University School
of Medicine.  “When you look at the brain microscopically, it’s
indisputable,” Dr. Ann McKee of the university’s Center for the
Study of Traumatic Encephalopathy said at a news conference.
“He has the classic appearance of chronic traumatic
encephalopathy.”  Duerson, who at age 50 shot himself in the chest, had at
least 10 concussions in an 11-year National Football League
career and showed symptoms of brain injury such as worsening
short-term memory and problems with impulse control, doctors
said at the news conference. He left a note reading “Please see
that my brain is given to the NFL’s brain bank.”  The NFL last year gave $1 million to the center.
Commissioner Roger Goodell said the U.S.’s most-popular sports
league hopes that more research can help detect, prevent and
treat brain injuries.  More needs to be done to educate current players on the
risk of brain injury, to enact rule changes to make the game
safer and to help those affected by conditions related to head
trauma, said Bruce Laird, a former NFL defensive back with the
Baltimore Colts and  San Diego Chargers , and president of Fourth
and Goal, an organization dedicated to helping retired NFL
players in need.  “Research must continue and remedies must be enacted,”
Laird said in a news release.  Duerson, a four-time Pro Bowl selection, helped the Bears
and  New York Giants  to Super Bowl championships. He finished an
11-year career with 20 interceptions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
