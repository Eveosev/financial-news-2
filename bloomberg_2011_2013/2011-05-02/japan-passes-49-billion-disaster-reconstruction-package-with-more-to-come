Japan ’s parliament passed a 4-trillion
yen ($49 billion) budget for rebuilding after the March 11
earthquake, the first in a series of relief packages.  The Diet’s upper house unanimously approved the extra
spending after the lower house passed the measure on April 30.  Prime Minister  Naoto Kan  has said several extra budgets may
be needed to rebuild after the quake, tsunami and nuclear crisis,
with government estimates putting the damage at as much as 25
trillion yen. Higher taxes may be needed to limit any increases
in bond sales that would swell a debt burden already twice the
size of the economy.  Today’s package will be financed using 2.5 trillion yen
from pension funds as well as money originally intended to
increase payments to families with children. Bond sales will be
necessary for the next plan, officials have said.  Money will go toward the clean-up and more than 100,000
temporary houses after the temblor left more than 25,000 people
dead or missing. Economic and Fiscal Policy Minister  Kaoru Yosano  said on April 21 that reconstruction “must” be backed
by higher levies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
