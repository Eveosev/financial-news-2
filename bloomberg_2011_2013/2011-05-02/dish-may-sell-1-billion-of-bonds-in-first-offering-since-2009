Dish Network Corp. (DISH) , the second-largest
U.S. satellite-television provider, sold $2 billion of 10-year
notes in its first bond offering since 2009 after doubling the
size of the transaction.  Dish Network planned to sell about $1 billion of the
securities, the Englewood, Colorado-based company said today in
a statement distributed by PR Newswire. It was the largest junk
bond sale since CIT Group Inc. issued $2 billion of debt on
March 23, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The satellite provider tapped the corporate  bond market 
after borrowing costs on U.S. junk-rated debt plunged to the
lowest on record, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch
index data. The company’s shares climbed by the most since 2009
after settling all patent litigation with TiVo Inc., ending a
seven-year legal dispute over video-recording technology.  The 6.75 percent notes yield 6.875 percent, or 360 basis
points more than similar-maturity Treasuries, Bloomberg data
show. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  Moody’s Investors Service ranks  Dish Network  Ba3, three
steps below investment grade, while  Standard & Poor’s  rates the
company an equivalent BB-. High-yield, high-risk, or junk, bonds
are ranked below Baa3 by Moody’s and below BBB- by S&P.  Dish Network last sold debt in September 2009, issuing $400
million of 10-year, 7.875 percent notes, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Average yields on  junk bonds  fell to 7.28 percent on April
30, a day after reaching the lowest on record, compared with
10.24 percent when Dish Network last sold debt, Bank of America
Merrill Lynch index data show.  Dish Network rose $4.75, or 19 percent, to $29.79 at 4 p.m.
