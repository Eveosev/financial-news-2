U.S. companies, earning more from
investments in plants and labor than any time in the last
decade, have yet to reap the benefits in their stock valuations.  Return on equity at  International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) 
has risen to 68 percent this year from 24 percent in 2005 after
the Armonk, New York-based company sold its personal-computer
business and reorganized staff. Net income per employee rose to
$34,758 in 2010, the highest since at least 1987, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The stock, up 108 percent since the
end of 2005 through last week, trades 16 percent below its
average price-earnings ratio during the past decade.  IBM’s example mirrors the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index,
where return on equity has risen six quarters to 23 percent and
may reach 27 percent next year, the highest annual level since
2000, analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg show. That may
help stocks overcome economic growth that slowed to 1.8 percent
last quarter and extend the best bull market in 54 years.  “We’ve had a phenomenal recovery in corporate profits and
productivity on a very subpar economic recovery,” said Nick Sargen, chief investment officer at Fort Washington Investment
Advisors in Cincinnati, which oversees more than $36 billion.
“If you agree that’s sustainable, then you’re willing to pay
more for those companies’ future earnings than the guy who
thinks this is just temporary. There’s more legs to the rally.”  Earnings Multiple  When return on equity rose close to its level now in the
first quarters of 2003 and 2009, the earnings multiple for the
 S&P 500  increased 11 percent and 60 percent, respectively, in
the next six months, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The
indicator shows how much profit investment in workers, plants,
technology and raw materials yields, making it a benchmark
measure for corporate strategies.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s  David Kostin , tied with UBS AG’s
Thomas Doerflinger as the most-accurate U.S. strategist in
predicting where the S&P 500 would end last year, recommends
buying shares of companies whose return on equity is climbing
fastest. Those include Peoria, Illinois-based  Caterpillar Inc. (CAT) ,
the world’s largest maker of construction equipment, and  Biogen
Idec Inc. (BIIB) , the producer of multiple sclerosis medicines in
Weston, Massachusetts.  The S&P 500 reached the highest level since June 2008 last
week, gaining 2 percent to 1,363.61 and bringing the rally that
began in March 2009 to 102 percent. The gauge fell 0.2 percent
to 1,361.22 as of 4 p.m. in  New York  today.  Company Profits  Profits at companies from  3M Co. (MMM)  to  United Parcel Service
Inc. (UPS)  topped analysts’ estimates. Earnings have beaten forecasts
at 77 percent of 299 index companies that have reported results
since April 11, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  While the S&P 500 must rise 15 percent to reach its all-
time high of 1,565.15 from 2007, trailing 12-month profit of
$88.15 a share is 2 percent away from the record of $89.95 set
in September 2007, Bloomberg data show. The index trades for
15.5 times income from the past 12 months and 12.2 times
analysts’ estimate for next year. The average using reported
earnings is 16.4 since 1954 and 20.5 in the past two decades.  Return on equity for the S&P 500 has climbed since falling
to 16 percent in the third quarter of 2009, the lowest in
Bloomberg data going back to 1998. The measure has averaged 22
percent in the past 13 years, the data show.  ‘Strong Corporate Performance’  “The stock market is doing very well, but we haven’t yet
seen the multiple expansion we should have with this kind of
strong corporate performance and the improved returns on
equity,” said  Philip Orlando , the New York-based chief equity
market strategist at Federated Investors Inc., which manages
$358.2 billion. “It’s happening, albeit at a very slow pace.”  Stocks rose after Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke 
said on April 27 he will finish $600 billion of bond purchases
on schedule in June as the economy recovers at a “moderate
pace.” The central bank has signaled it will maintain record
stimulus until job growth accelerates before it starts to raise
borrowing costs and trim its $2.69 trillion balance sheet.  While gross domestic product expanded 1.8 percent in the
first quarter, it will rise 3.2 percent this quarter, and
accelerate through the end of the year, according to the median
of economists’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  The U.S. unemployment rate is double the five-year low of
4.4 percent from October 2006 after falling 1 percentage point
since November to 8.8 percent. New applications for jobless
benefits rose in the week ended April 22 to the highest level in
three months, the Labor Department said last week.  Labor Costs  Companies are getting more from investments in part because
labor costs are falling. U.S. productivity, or employee output
per hour, rose 3.9 percent last year, the most since 2002,
according to Labor Department statistics released in March.
Worker costs fell 1.5 percent following a 1.6 percent decrease
in 2009, the first back-to-back drop since 1962 and 1963.  Caterpillar has climbed 23 percent this year for the
biggest advance in the  Dow Jones Industrial Average . Return on
equity is forecast to reach 36 percent this year, the highest
annual level since 2008, compared with 28 percent last year and
12 percent in 2009.  Caterpillar’s incremental margin, or the profit made on new
sales, rose to 26 percent last year, the highest since at least
2003, as the company benefited from demand from mining and
construction companies in  China ,  India  and Brazil, according to
Jefferies Group Inc.’s  Stephen Volkmann .  Caterpillar Earnings  The company posted per-share profit last week that topped
analysts’ estimates by 41 percent and raised its full-year
earnings forecast as sales surged in developing countries.
Revenue increased 57 percent in the first quarter to $12.9
billion, according to a April 29 statement.  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s earnings almost doubled last quarter to $6.40
a share, beating the $5.39 average estimate of analysts, as
rising demand for Mac computers and the iPhone outweighed lower-
than-predicted sales of the iPad tablet at the Cupertino,
California-based company. Apple’s return on equity reached 39
percent as of March 26, the highest quarterly total since at
least 1990, the data show.  IBM, the world’s largest computer-services provider,
boosted its full-year profit forecast as companies buy more
software and equipment such as mainframe computers and server
systems. Operating earnings at the company will be at least
$13.15 a share this year, higher than a previous projection of
at least $13, and above the $13.08 average estimate of analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg.  Weaker Earnings Momentum  Even higher returns on equity won’t be enough to keep up
the pace of stock increases as profit gains slow in the bull
market’s third year, said Daniel Genter, who oversees about $3.7
billion as president of RNC Genter Capital Management. Weaker
earnings momentum means investors won’t be willing to pay higher
valuations for shares, he said.  S&P 500 profit growth has slowed. Companies that released
results between April 11 and April 29 reported a 23 percent
increase in income, compared with 39 percent in the previous
earnings season, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “A big multiple expansion is unlikely,” Genter said in an
interview from  Los Angeles . “We’re not going to have
accelerating earnings. We’re going to have slower growth as
costs go up and monetary policy can’t go lower than it is now.”  Rising commodity costs may reduce profitability. Oak Brook,
Illinois-based  McDonald’s Corp. (MCD)  said April 21 that food expenses
in the U.S. will increase as much as 4.5 percent, faster than
its February projection of up to 2.5 percent. Shares of the
world’s biggest restaurant chain have climbed 2 percent this
year, trailing the S&P 500’s 8.4 percent gain.  S&P 500 Revenue  Sales for S&P 500 companies is projected to climb 9.7
percent this year to $1,040.83 a share, the fastest pace since
2004, Bloomberg data show. A basket compiled by Goldman Sachs of
50 companies with increasing return on equity has risen 11
percent this year, beating the S&P 500’s gain.  Increased demand may boost hiring. Santa Clara, California-
based  Intel Corp. (INTC) , the biggest chipmaker, announced Feb. 18 it
plans to build a $5 billion microprocessor plant in Arizona and
hire 4,000 people in the U.S. this year.  General Electric Co. (GE)  in
Fairfield, Connecticut, whose chief executive officer, Jeffrey Immelt, leads President Barack Obama’s Council on Jobs and
Competitiveness, announced plans over the last two years to
create at least 6,300 jobs in the U.S., according to company
statements.  Productivity Rebound  “It’s typical that you get a huge rebound in productivity
in the first 18 to 24 months of a business cycle,” said Doug Ramsey, the Minneapolis-based director of research at Leuthold
Group, which oversees $4 billion. “We’re entering into a stage
where business has picked up enough that you’ve got to take on
some new hires that have been put off for the last several
months, start inventory rebuilding and capital spending
projects, and that will cut into margins.”  The S&P 500 is cheaper now than at the start of the third
year for the three previous bull markets in the past two
decades. The index’s multiple of 15.5 times reported earnings
compares with 17.8 in October 2004, 28.2 in August 2000 and 23.7
in October 1992, according to data compiled by Bloomberg and
Birinyi Associates, a Westport, Connecticut-based research firm.  “The market is still cheap,” David Kelly, who helps
oversee about $445 billion as chief market strategist for
JPMorgan Funds in New York, said in a Bloomberg Television
interview. “Even in a mild expansion, one where most Americans
feel really unsatisfied, the thing that matters most to
shareholders, which is profits, is going up very well.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
