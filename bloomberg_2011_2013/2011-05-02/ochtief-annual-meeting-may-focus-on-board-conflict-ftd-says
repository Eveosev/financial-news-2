Hochtief AG (HOT) ’s supervisory board seats
may be the focus of conflict at the annual shareholders meeting
after investor Actividades de Construccion & Servicios SA let a
deadline to name candidates lapse,  Financial Times Deutschland 
reported, without saying where it got the information.  ACS, which has said it will vote against candidates that
Hochtief’s current board is putting forward, will propose names
at the meeting on May 12, the newspaper said. The timing leaves
other shareholders no time to find out about the qualifications
of potential new nominees, the German newspaper said.  ACS wants Manfred Wennemer, a former chief executive
officer of  Continental AG (CON) , as supervisory board chairman and  TUI
AG (TUI1)  CEO Michael Frenzel as a board member, FTD reported.
Candidates on Hochtief’s list, including former CEO Hans-Peter Keitel, former CEOs Wilhelm Simson of  E.ON AG (EOAN)  and Heinrich von Pierer of  Siemens AG (SIE)  and former  Allianz SE (ALV)  executive Detlev Bremkamp, will be opposed by ACS, the newspaper said.
