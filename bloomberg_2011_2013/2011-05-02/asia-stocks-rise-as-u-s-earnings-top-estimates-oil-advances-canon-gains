Asia’s benchmark stock index rose to
the highest level in almost four months after U.S. companies
reported earnings that topped analysts’ estimates and President
Barack Obama said Osama bin Laden has been killed.  Komatsu Ltd. (6301) , the world’s No. 2 maker of construction
equipment, advanced 3 percent after  Caterpillar Inc. (CAT)  posted
better-than-estimated profit.  Seiko Epson Corp. (6724) , a Japanese
printer maker, rose 5.7 percent after forecasting net income
will jump 66 percent this fiscal year. Hyundai Development Co.
surged 12 percent in  Seoul  after the government announced
measures to aid builders and boost the  property market .  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index gained 0.7 percent to 140.42 at
7:38 p.m. in Tokyo, the highest level since Jan. 19. Three
stocks rose for each that fell on the gauge. The measure rose
0.5 percent last week after the  Federal Reserve  renewed its
pledge to stimulate growth in the U.S., the world’s biggest
economy, with low  interest rates .  “The death of bin Laden eases some concern, but it’s hard
to imagine it’ll lead to a reduction of risk in the Middle East,
and so the market’s reaction may be transitory,” said Koichiro Nishio, a market analyst in Tokyo at SMBC Nikko Securities Inc.
“The recovery of demand in the U.S. and other developed
countries means a better environment for earnings.”  Japan ’s  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average rose 1.6 percent to the
highest level since the March 11 earthquake and tsunami.
Japanese shares extended gains when the dollar strengthened
versus the yen after President Obama said bin Laden was killed
yesterday in a firefight with a team of U.S. operatives who
raided a compound in Pakistan where he had been hiding.  Nikkei, Kospi  Pakistan’s Karachi Stock Exchange 100 Index slipped 0.2
percent. Futures on the U.S. Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
advanced 0.3 percent today. The stock gauge rose 0.2 percent to
1,363.61 on April 29.  South Korea ’s Kospi Index added 1.7 percent.  Australia ’s
S&P/ASX 200 Index was little changed, recovering from a loss of
as much as 1.2 percent after the nation’s currency rose above
$1.10 for the first time since foreign-exchange controls were
scrapped in 1983. Australia’s manufacturing contracted in April
for the seventh time in eight months as the record-high currency
and consumer caution hurt textile and other producers, an
industry report showed today.  U.S. earnings boosted confidence in global corporate
profits. Caterpillar, the world’s largest maker of construction
equipment, raised its full-year earnings forecast as sales
surged in  developing countries .  Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. (GT) , the
biggest U.S. tiremaker, reported first-quarter adjusted earnings
of 51 cents a share, more than quadrupling the 11-cent average
estimate of analysts.  Consumer Spending   Also, a government report showed consumer spending in the
U.S. climbed in March as Americans spent more on food and fuel.
Purchases rose 0.6 percent after a revised 0.9 percent gain in
February that was higher than previously estimated, Commerce
Department figures showed on April 29.  Komatsu advanced 3 percent to 2,924 yen in Tokyo.  Canon
Inc. (7751) , the world’s No. 1 manufacturer of cameras, climbed 2.5
percent to 3,895 yen.  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , the world’s largest
carmaker, increased 1.9 percent to 3,290 yen.  Seiko Epson  jumped 5.7 percent to 1,492 yen, its highest
close since Jan. 19. The company forecast net income will jump
66 percent. Cosmo Oil Co., a refiner, advanced 3.4 percent to
274 yen. The company’s net income was 28 billion yen for the
year ended March 31, up 56 percent from its forecast, according
to a preliminary earnings statement.  ‘Worries Receding’  Electric Power Development Co., Japan’s biggest power
wholesaler, leapt 4 percent to 2,211 yen. The company projected
full-year net income will increase 33 percent.  “In addition to U.S. companies having good earnings,
Japanese companies’ earnings were not so bad. That’s improving
investors’ sentiment in the market,” said  Toshiyuki Kanayama , a
market analyst at Tokyo-based Monex Inc. “Excessive worries
about the future of the economy and companies’ earnings are
receding.”  The MSCI  Asia  Pacific Index increased 1.3 percent this year
through April 29, compared with gains of 8.4 percent by the
Standard and Poor’s 500 Index and 2.9 percent by the Stoxx
Europe 600 Index. Stocks in the Asian benchmark were valued at
13.5 times estimated earnings on average, compared with 13.8
times for the S&P 500 and 11.5 times for the Stoxx 600.  Tax Incentives  South Korean construction companies advanced on the
government’s support measures. The government said it will give
tax incentives to real-estate investment trusts that buy unsold
housing, and will establish a bank to purchase soured loans owed
by builders and developers.  Hyundai Development surged 12 percent to 32,700 won. Daewoo
Engineering & Construction Co. added 2.2 percent to 11,650 won.
Daelim Industrial Co. climbed 3.7 percent to 125,500 won. South
Korean shares also gained as data showed the nation’s exports
rose to a record in April.  “Investors are cheering supportive measures by the
government, especially given many builders had underperformed
other sectors this year,” said Im Jeong Jae, a Seoul-based  fund
manager  at Shinhan BNP Paribas Asset Management Co., which
oversees about $30 billion. “Still, we’ll have to see how
effective their measures are.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
