A cholera outbreak in Cameroon has
killed 135 people this year in six of the West African nationâ€™s
10 regions, a public health official said.  Almost three-quarters of the total 4,122 cases have
occurred in areas close to the capital, Yaounde, and the main
port, Douala, the secretary of state for public health, Alim
Hayatou, said in a statement handed to reporters today.  The government has created centers to control cholera, a
bacterial infection that spreads through contaminated water and
food, in Yaounde and Douala with the support of the French aid
group,  Medecins Sans Frontieres , he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
