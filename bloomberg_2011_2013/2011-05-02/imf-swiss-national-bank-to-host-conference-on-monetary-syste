The  International Monetary Fund  and
the  Swiss National Bank  will host a conference on the
international monetary system in Zurich on May 10, the IMF said
today in an e-mailed statement.  “The main topics include policy discipline and spillovers
in a global economy, global liquidity provision at times of
crisis, capital flows, and international reserve currencies,”
the IMF said in the statement.  SNB President Philipp Hildebrand and IMF Managing Director
Dominique Strauss-Kahn will co-host the conference, where French
Finance Minister Christine Lagarde will give the keynote
luncheon speech, the IMF said.  There are no plans to hold a press briefing at the
conference, Walter Meier, a spokesman for Swiss National Bank,
said in a telephone interview.  To contact the reporters on this story:
