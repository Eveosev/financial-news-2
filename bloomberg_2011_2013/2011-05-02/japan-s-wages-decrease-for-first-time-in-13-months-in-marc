Japan ’s wages slid for the first time
in 13 months in March after the record earthquake disrupted
production chains and crimped power supply to the capital.  Monthly pay including overtime and bonuses declined 0.4
percent from a year earlier to 274,886 yen ($3,383), the Labor
Ministry said today in  Tokyo .  To contact the reporter on this story:
