Kenyan President Mwai Kibaki welcomed
the killing of al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, whom he said was
suspected to have masterminded an attack 13 years ago on the
U.S. Embassy in Nairobi.  “His killing is an act of justice to those Kenyans who
lost their lives and the many more who suffered injuries,”
Kibaki said in an e-mailed statement today from the capital.  In August 1998, at least 213 people died in an attack on
the U.S. Embassy in downtown Nairobi. Al-Qaeda claimed
responsibility for the bombing.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
