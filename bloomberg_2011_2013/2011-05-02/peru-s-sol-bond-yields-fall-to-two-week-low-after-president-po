Peruvian sol bonds rose for a third
day, pushing yields to a two-week low, on bets that support for
ex-military rebel Ollanta Humala’s presidential bid is waning.  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-
denominated bond due August 2020 fell 6 basis points, or 0.06
percentage point, to 7.02 percent, the lowest since April 14,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The bond’s price rose
0.40 centimo to 105.64 centimos per sol.  A poll published April 29 by Lima-based researcher Datum
Internacional found Humala’s lead over Congresswoman Keiko Fujimori had fallen to 1.2 percentage points, the narrowest gap
of three surveys since Humala won the April 10 first-round vote
with an eight-point lead. Humala, leader of  Peru ’s Nationalist
Party, has pledged to increase state control over the economy
and revise contracts with foreign investors and trading
partners. A runoff vote will be held June 5.  “The market responded well to the Datum survey, which
showed the race isn’t over yet,” said Manuel Aldave, head of
investors at Banco Internacional del Peru, the nation’s fourth-
largest bank. “Bonds and stocks reacted positively, but there’s
still five weeks to go and anything could happen.”  The Lima General Index of stocks fell 0.4 percent to
19,554.80 at 12:44 p.m. New York time, after rising 4.5 percent
last week, the first weekly gain in five.  There is no interbank trading in Peru’s foreign exchange
market today as the central bank is closed for a government
holiday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
