Nasim Beg, who oversees the equivalent
of $154 million in Pakistani stocks and bonds at Arif Habib
Investments Ltd. in Karachi, comments on the impact of killing
of Osama  Bin Laden  by a team of U.S. operatives in  Pakistan . Beg
spoke in a phone interview.  The  Karachi Stock Exchange  100 index fell 0.4 percent to
12,007.77 at 2:09 p.m. local time.  On the impact on the share market:  “Pakistan will be the biggest beneficiary of the
development as the militancy will weaken all over the world. As
Pakistan has been a frontline state in the war against
terrorism, militants inside Pakistan will also weaken. That will
benefit businesses.”  On the impact on overseas investors:  “Over all, militancy will decline that will benefit
companies and their earnings. The improved law and order
situation will attract local and foreign investors.”  On intraday decline in shares:  “People are cautious and the market is down. People are
fearing retaliatory action by terrorists. There are few things
that need to be cleared such as questions of where he was found
and relations between Pakistan and the  United States .”  To contact the reporter on this story:
