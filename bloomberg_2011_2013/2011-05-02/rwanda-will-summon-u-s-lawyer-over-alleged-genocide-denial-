Rwandan authorities will summon U.S.
lawyer Peter Erlinder to court “very soon” to face charges of
alleged genocide denial, the East African nation’s prosecutor-
general said.  If Erlinder refuses to return to  Rwanda , the government
will ask Interpol, the international police force, to arrest
him, Martin Ngoga told reporters today in the capital, Kigali.
Erlinder was arrested in May 2010 on the same charges, though he
was released on bail three weeks later.  “It is not an option for this case to die anywhere outside
the courtroom,” Ngoga said today. There has been no previous
case in which an American national has been extradited to face
charges in Rwanda, Ngoga said.  Erlinder was dismissed from his post last month as a
defense attorney at the International Criminal Tribunal for
Rwanda, the court trying suspects in the 1994 genocide. That
year, about 800,000 people were slaughtered in 100 days of
ethnic violence.  Erlinder didn’t immediately respond to a request for
comment left on his voicemail when Bloomberg called him today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
