Angola ,  Africa ’s second-biggest oil
producer, may revise its budget this month ahead of elections
next year, President Jose Eduardo dos Santos said.  “We intend to assess the need to revise the 2011 budget and
identify resources” for other programs the government needs to
work on, Dos Santos told a congress of the ruling party, in
Futungo, south of the capital, Luanda, on April 30.  The government’s 4 trillion kwanza ($43 billion) budget,
approved in October, predicted the economy would grow 7.6
percent this year.  Angola will hold elections in the last quarter of 2012 and
before then, the ruling Popular Movement for the Liberation of
Angola party expects to carry out “large-scale” programs,  Dos
Santos  said.  The government will increase credit to farmers, establish
programs to boost entrepreneurship and help reintegrated
soldiers who fought in the country’s 27-year civil war that
ended in 2002.  To contact the reporter on this story:
