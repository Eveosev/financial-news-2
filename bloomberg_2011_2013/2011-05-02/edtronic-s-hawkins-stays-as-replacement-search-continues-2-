Medtronic Inc. (MDT)  Chief Executive Officer
William A. Hawkins said the search for his replacement is still
under way and he will remain with the device-maker until a new
leader is selected.  Hawkins, who announced his retirement as CEO and chairman
on Dec. 20, originally planned to leave at the end of the fiscal
year in April. The board of directors for Minneapolis-based
Medtronic, the world’s largest maker of heart devices, hasn’t
yet named a replacement, Hawkins wrote in a letter to employees
dated May 2 and posted on the company’s website.  “The Board is making excellent progress; however, this
process takes time and will extend into early FY12,” Hawkins
said. “As we said in December, to ensure a smooth leadership
transition, I will continue to serve as chairman and CEO until
my successor is named.”  Hawkins, 57, has served as Medtronic’s chief executive
since August 2007 and has been with the company since January
2002. He will get about $3.8 million in separation payments when
he retires.  Medtronic rose 62 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $42.37 at 4
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading and has
declined 3 percent in the past 12 months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
