CME Group Inc.’s Comex unit raised
margin requirements on silver trading for the second time in
less than a week.  The minimum amount of cash that must be deposited when
borrowing from brokers to trade silver futures will rise to
$16,200 per contract from $14,513, the exchange said today in a
an e-mailed  statement . Silver futures dropped as much as 13
percent today after Comex raised margins by 13 percent at the
close of business on April 29.  The new rates will be effective at the close of business
tomorrow. Margins were at $4,250 a year earlier.  Silver futures for July delivery plummeted $2.515, or 5.2
percent, to $46.084 an ounce, the biggest decline since Jan. 4.
Still, the metal has more than doubled in the past year. One
futures contract is for 5,000 ounces, valued at today’s closing
price at $230,420.  To contact the reporter on this story:
