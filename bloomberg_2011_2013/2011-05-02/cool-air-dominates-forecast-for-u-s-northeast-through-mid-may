The U.S. Northeast will probably
remain cool through the middle of May, said  Matt Rogers ,
president of  Commodity Weather Group  LLC in Bethesda,  Maryland .  Rogers’s forecast calls for  New York , eastern Pennsylvania
and New England to remain cooler than normal from May 7 to May
16. In his 11- to 15-day outlook, Rogers expands the area with a
change of being cold from the Great Plains, including most of
Texas, to the Atlantic Coast with the exception of the Deep
South.  “From an energy demand perspective, this keeps overnight
heating load higher for the populated Midwest and East Coast
areas,” Rogers wrote in a short note to clients.  Natural gas traders monitor weather forecasts to determine
whether temperatures may boost heating or cooling demand.
Predictions of below-normal or above-normal temperatures may
prompt traders to buy or sell gas futures. Commodity traders
watch precipitation forecasts for potential impact on planting
and yields.  Rogers also forecasts a cooling the center of the country
will persist through May 6. An area from  Texas  into the Ohio
River Valley will remain much colder than normal, he said.  Rogers predicts the cooling trend in Texas and parts of the
western U.S. will moderate during the 6- to 10-day timeframe. He
calls for warmer than normal weather from eastern  California  to
the southern half of the Mississippi Valley from May 7 to May
11.  To contact the reporter on this story:
