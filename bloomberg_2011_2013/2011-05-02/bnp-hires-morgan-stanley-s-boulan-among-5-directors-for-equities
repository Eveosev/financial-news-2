BNP Paribas (BNP)  SA, France’s largest bank,
appointed Sebastian Boulan, the former head of  Morgan Stanley (MS) ’s
special situations desk, to oversee event-driven sales at its
New York equities business.  Boulan, who spent eight years at Morgan Stanley, was among
five directors appointed to the equities desk, the Paris-based

2010, up 16 percent from 2009.  “We are seeing significant opportunity for growth and
increased interest in the event-driven space,” Matthew Moran,
who heads the bank’s North American cash and listed derivatives
sales-trading for equities group, said in the statement.  Abbatiello also joins the event-driven team, after
previously working at BGC Partners Inc., according to the
statement. Backman, who will be on the corporate access desk,
previously was at  HSBC Holdings Plc. (HSBA)  Kuhlmann, who will serve as
an international equity sales trader, comes from Morgan Stanley,
