Hedge funds  increased bullish bets on
natural gas to the highest level in three months on smaller-
than-expected stockpile gains and speculation that reduced
nuclear output will spur demand for the power-plant fuel.  The funds and other large investors increased wagers on
rising prices by 38 percent in the seven days ended April 26 to
the most since Jan. 25, according to the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission’s Commitments of Traders report.  Futures climbed 6.5 percent last week after government data
showed inventories increased 1.9 percent, less than the 2.3
percent estimated by analysts, in the week ended April 22.
Prices also advanced as seasonal maintenance and shutdowns after
the worst day of tornadoes in 37 years brought nuclear
generation to the lowest level since Oct. 26, 2000.  “Nuclear-power shutdowns and maintenance have boosted
physical demand for gas, and inventories are down year over
year,” said Jason Schenker, the president of Prestige Economics
LLC in Austin,  Texas . “That’s engendered some upward momentum
for the market.”  Natural gas rose 12.5 cents, or 2.9 percent, to $4.387 per
million British thermal units on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  during the week covered by the report. It has advanced
30.6 cents, or 7 percent, since then to settle at $4.693 today
in New York.  The Energy Department reported gas inventories rose 47
billion cubic feet in the week ended April 15, below the 52
billion analysts predicted in estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Supply Shortfall  Stockpiles increased 31 billion cubic feet in the week
ended April 22, less than the 38 billion analysts had estimated.
Inventories totaled 1.685 trillion, 0.6 percent below the five-
year average and 11 percent below levels a year earlier. The
year-on-year shortfall was the widest since Aug. 8, 2008.  Nuclear- power plants  generated 72,898 megawatts, or 72
percent of capacity, on April 26, almost the lowest level in
four and a half years, according to a Nuclear Regulatory
Commission report and data compiled by Bloomberg. Twenty-six of
the nation’s 104 reactors were offline. Nuclear plants typically
refuel in the spring and fall, when weather-driven demand for
power is lowest.  Atomic power generates 20 percent of U.S. electricity while
natural gas accounts for 20.4 percent, according to an April 14
report from the Energy Department.  Output fell to the lowest level in more than 10 years on
April 28 after storms spawning tornadoes knocked out power to
the  Tennessee Valley Authority ’s Browns Ferry plant in  Alabama .
The storms killed more than 300 people, according to the
 Associated Press .  Browns Ferry  The Tennessee Valley Authority declared an “unusual
event” at Browns Ferry after thunderstorms and high winds
damaged offsite power supplies, requiring the shutdown. The
plant is 84 miles (135 kilometers) north of Birmingham. An
unusual event is the lowest of four categories in the NRC’s
emergency classification system.  The 1,065-megawatt Unit 1, the 1,104-megawatt Unit 2 and
the 1,115-megawatt Unit 3 are in “hot” standby, meaning they
are at operating pressure and temperature. The reactors remained
shut as of April 29, according to an  NRC report .  “If a nuclear plant is shut down because of a tornado,
it’s an extraordinary event,” said  Jay Levine , president of
Enerjay LLC, a Portland, Maine-based brokerage. “In the natural
gas market, people tend to want to buy first and ask questions
later.”  Warm Weather  Cooling degree days in the U.S. were 33 percent above
normal for the week ended April 23, according to  David Salmon , a
meteorologist with Weather Derivatives in Belton,  Missouri , also
contributing to the price gains. Degree days are used as a
measure of demand for power and natural gas.  The high temperature in Houston on April 22 was 88 degrees
Fahrenheit (31 Celsius), 8 above normal, according to
AccuWeather Inc. in  State College ,  Pennsylvania . Above-normal
temperatures are likely in the southern U.S. from May 9 through
May 13, according to MDA EarthSat Weather in Rockville,
 Maryland .  Power plants use 30 percent of the nation’s gas supplies,
according to the Energy Department.  Net-long positions in natural gas held by managed money,
including hedge funds, commodity pools and commodity-trading
advisers, in futures and options combined in four natural-gas
contracts rose by 36,398 futures equivalents to 131,637 in the
week ended April 26.  Gas Contracts  The measure of net longs includes an index of four
contracts adjusted to futures equivalents: Nymex natural gas
futures, Nymex  Henry Hub  Swaps, Nymex Henry Hub Penultimate
Swaps and ICE Henry Hub Swaps. Henry Hub, in Erath,  Louisiana ,
is the delivery point for Nymex futures, a benchmark price for
the fuel.  In other markets, bullish, or long, bets on gasoline fell
1.1 percent to 62,279 futures and options combined, the CFTC
data showed. Bets on heating oil rose by 4,130, or 13 percent,
to 37,122, the largest gain since the week ended March 15.  Net-long positions in oil increased 11,202 futures and
options combined, or 3.9 percent, to 301,118, according to the
CFTC report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
