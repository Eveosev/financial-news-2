U.S. nuclear-power production fell to
the lowest level in almost 12 years as reactors shut in  New
Jersey , Minnesota and  California , the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission said.  Power generation nationwide decreased 2,611 megawatts, or
3.7 percent, from April 29 to 68,667 megawatts, or 68 percent of
capacity, the smallest amount since May 10, 1999, according to
an NRC report today and data compiled by Bloomberg.  Thirty of the nation’s 104 reactors were offline, including
the three at the Browns Ferry plant in Alabama that were knocked
out after tornadoes destroyed regional transmission lines on
April 27. Those reactors, located near the Tennessee line, were
undamaged and are expected to power up this week.  An oil leak in a diesel generator being used to cool the
Browns Ferry reactors while offsite power is restored caused a
“momentary” loss of cooling to Unit 2 on April 28, the NRC
said.  Xcel Energy Inc. (XEL)  shut the 551-megawatt Prairie Island 1
reactor in Minnesota for scheduled refueling and maintenance,
Mary Sandok, a spokeswoman for the company, said in an e-mailed
response to questions.  The unit was operating at 83 percent of capacity on April
29. The 545-megawatt Prairie Island 2, another reactor at the
site about 40 miles (64 kilometers) southeast of Minneapolis, is
operating at full power.  Oyster Creek Idled  Exelon Corp. (EXC)  idled the 619-megawatt Oyster Creek unit in
New Jersey, 33 miles north of Atlantic City.  PG&E Corp. (PCG)  shut the 1,151-megawatt  Diablo Canyon  Unit 2
reactor in California from full power on April 29. Another
reactor, the 1,149-megawatt Unit 1, is operating at full
capacity at the site, about 160 miles northwest of  Los Angeles .  Public Service Enterprise Group Inc. (PEG)  slowed the 1,174-
megawatt Salem 1 unit in New Jersey to 8 percent of capacity
from 75 percent on April 29. The reactor was shut April 21 after
water intake filters became clogged, and has fluctuated in
output since returning to service a few days later. Another unit
at the site, 1,130-megawatt Salem 2, is closed.  The plant is about 18 miles south of Wilmington,  Delaware .  Exelon lowered output at the 1,112-megawatt Peach Bottom 3
reactor in Pennsylvania to 89 percent of capacity from 100
percent on April 29. Peach Bottom 2, another 1,112-megawatt
reactor at the site near the Maryland line 47 miles southeast of
Harrisburg, was at full capacity.  Turkey Point Started  NextEra Energy Inc. (NEE)  started the 693-megawatt Turkey Point 4
reactor and is operating it at 2 percent of capacity. The 693-
megawatt Turkey Point 3, another reactor at the site 20 miles
south of Miami, is operating at full power.  Southern Co. (SO)  switched on the 883-megawatt Edwin I. Hatch 2
reactor in Georgia. It is operating at 3 percent of capacity.
The 876-megawatt Hatch 1 is operating at full power. The plant
is located about 74 miles west of Savannah.  Entergy Corp. (ETR)  boosted the 995-megawatt Arkansas Nuclear Two
reactor to 77 percent of capacity from 43 percent after a storm
knocked out a 500-kilovolt line on April 25 and the  Little Rock 
Transmission Operating Center asked for a reduction in power to
the grid during repairs.  The 843-megawatt Unit 1 remains at 43 percent. The plant is
65 miles northwest of Little Rock.  Exelon boosted the 1,164-megawatt  Byron 1 reactor  in
Illinois to 98 percent of capacity from 90 percent on April 29
after a refueling outage. Another unit at the site, the 1,136-
megawatt Byron 2, is operating at full power. The plant is
located 85 miles west of Chicago.  Some reactors close for maintenance and refueling during
the spring and fall in the U.S., when demand for heating and
cooling is lower. The outages can increase consumption of
natural gas and coal to generate electricity.  The average U.S. reactor  refueling outage  lasted 41 days in
2009, according to the  Nuclear Energy Institute .  To contact the reporter on this story:
