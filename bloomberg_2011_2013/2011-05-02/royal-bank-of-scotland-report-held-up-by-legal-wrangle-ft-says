A report by the U.K. Financial
Services Authority into the collapse of  Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc (RBS)  has been held up by tensions between the regulator,
politicians and the bank’s lawyers, the Financial Times
reported.  The lawyers are concerned that some passages in the report,
which was to have been published by the end of March, may expose
the bank to further litigation, particularly in the U.S., the
newspaper said.  Lawyers representing John Cameron, formerly the head of
RBS’s investment banking unit, have also raised objections, the
FT said, citing unidentified people familiar with the matter.  The House of Commons Treasury committee, on the other hand,
wants the published version of the report to be forthright about
what went wrong at RBS, which is now 83 percent owned by the
government, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
