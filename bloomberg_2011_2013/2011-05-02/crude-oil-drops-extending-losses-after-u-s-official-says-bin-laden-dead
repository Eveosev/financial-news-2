Oil dropped 1.5 percent in  New York ,
extending earlier losses, after an official in President Barack
Obamaâ€™s administration said that Al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden
 has been killed.  Crude for June delivery slipped as much as $1.72 to $112.21
a barrel in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange , and was at $112.34 at 11 a.m. Sydney time.  Obama will deliver the news in an address from the White
House this evening, nearly 10 years after the Sept. 11 attacks
that bin Laden orchestrated.  To contact the reporter on this story:
