(Corrects transaction value in third paragraph.)  PPR (PP)  SA, the French owner of Gucci and
Puma, plans to hire bankers in the coming weeks to sell at least
one of its retail assets, Chief Executive Officer Francois-Henri Pinault said.  “We haven’t hired anyone yet,” Pinault said today in a
phone interview from  New York . “We will choose an investment
bank to work with in the next few weeks.”  PPR, which is based in Paris, plans to dispose of online
retailer Redcats in addition to the Fnac electronics and media
chain to focus on  luxury goods  and sports as well as lifestyle
clothing and accessories. PPR, which agreed today to buy Costa
Mesa, California-based surf and skate brand  Volcom Inc. (VLCM)  for
$607.5 million, spun off African distributor CFAO in 2009 and
sold furniture retailer Conforama in March.  PPR has started the preliminary work for the divestitures
and will sell either Redcats or Fnac in the second half of 2011,
Pinault said.  “It’s not possible to do the two deals at the same time,”
as the units are too big, said Pinault, who is also the
company’s chairman.  “At some point I will have to make a
choice to go forward on one or the other but it’s not been made
yet.”  Redcats has an enterprise value of 1.35 billion euros ($2
billion) and is seen as an ideal target for private-equity
investors, according to Sanford C. Bernstein. Fnac, which is
worth 1.06 billion euros, could be sold to an industry acquirer
or listed on the stock exchange, Bernstein wrote in a February
report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
