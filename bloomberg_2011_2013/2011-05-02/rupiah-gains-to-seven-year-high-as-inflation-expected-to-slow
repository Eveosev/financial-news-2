Indonesia ’s rupiah advanced to a
seven-year high as inflation slowed for a third month, easing
concern that rising prices will derail the nation’s economy.
Benchmark bonds declined.  Consumer prices in  Southeast Asia ’s largest economy gained
6.16 percent in April, after increasing 6.65 percent in March,
the  Central Bureau of Statistics  said in Jakarta today. That’s
less than the 6.4 percent median estimate of 19 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg.  “Inflation is no longer a major concern for Indonesia,”
said Lindawati Susanto, head of treasury at PT Bank Resona
Perdania in Jakarta. “ Bank Indonesia  will probably hold back
from increasing interest rates until the second half of the
year.”  The rupiah strengthened 0.3 percent to 8,543 per dollar as
of 4:32 p.m. in Jakarta, the strongest level since March 2004,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The currency has gained
5.1 percent this year.  “A stronger rupiah significantly reduces import prices,
which is positive for inflation,” Rusman Heriawan, chairman of
the statistics bureau, told reporters at a press briefing in
Jakarta today.  Overseas investors bought $2 billion more local shares than
they sold last month. Foreign funds increased their holdings of
Indonesian government debt from 211.81 trillion rupiah ($24.8
billion) on April 1 to 218.79 trillion rupiah on April 27.  Policy makers will meet on May 12 to review the benchmark
lending rate. The central bank last raised the rate by 0.25
percentage point to 6.75 percent in February, the first increase
in more than two years.  Ten-year  government bonds  fell, snapping a two-day rally.
The yield on the 8.25 percent note due July 2021 climbed one
basis point to 7.67 percent, according to closing prices from
the Inter-Dealer Market Association.  To contact the reporters on this story:
