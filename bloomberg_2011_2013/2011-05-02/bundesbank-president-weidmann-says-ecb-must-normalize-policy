Bundesbank President and European
Central Bank council member Jens Weidmann said the ECB must
normalize its monetary policy.  One of the bank’s key challenges is to “formulate a return
to monetary policy normality,” Weidmann said in his first
speech after replacing  Axel Weber  at the Bundesbank’s helm.
“For the exit it is not a question of ‘if,’ rather ‘when’,” he
said in Frankfurt today. “Short-term crisis measures can, when
administered as a long-term medication, be associated with
considerable side effects.”  Weidmann signaled he intends to follow in Weber’s
inflation-fighting footsteps, saying he will ensure the
Bundesbank keeps its “culture of stability” under his
leadership. He said there should be a clear distinction between
monetary and fiscal policy, and  price stability  must remain the
ECB’s primary goal.  He also said Germany must use today’s “very favorable”
economic conditions to keep reducing its  budget deficit , and
that private investors should be made to share the
responsibility for any future euro-area bailouts.  Weidmann, 43, is the youngest president in the Bundesbank’s
54-year history and the youngest ECB council member. Fluent in
both English and French, he is a former student and protégé of
Weber, who made a name for himself as one of the most hawkish
ECB policy makers. He was previously  Chancellor Angela Merkel ’s
chief economic adviser.  To contact the reporter on this story:
