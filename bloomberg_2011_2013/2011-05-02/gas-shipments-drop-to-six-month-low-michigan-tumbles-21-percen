Natural gas shipments scheduled for
delivery to U.S. households dropped to the lowest level in more
than six months as warmer weather reduced heating demand.
Deliveries for  Michigan  tumbled 21 percent.  Scheduled shipments for residential use fell for a fourth
day, down 1.3 percent to 23.9 million dekatherms (23.3 billion
cubic feet), the lowest level since Oct. 21, based on a sampling
of gas pipeline nominations compiled by Bloomberg as of 3:30
p.m. in New York.  A total of 831,957 dekatherms were to be delivered to
Michigan homes, down from yesterday’s 1.05 million, Bloomberg
data show.  The low temperature in Detroit today was 50 degrees
Fahrenheit (19 Celsius), 6 degrees above normal, according to
 Weather Underground  in  Ann Arbor , Michigan.  Natural gas accounts for 78 percent of Michigan’s heating
demand, according to  the Energy Department .  Prices at the Michigan Consolidated Gas hub, which serves
 Detroit  as well as most of north and northeast Michigan, rose
2.2 percent to $4.8089 per million British thermal units on the
Intercontinental Exchange.  Gas at the Henry Hub in Erath, Louisiana, advanced 2.2
percent to $4.6034. The hub is the benchmark for gas futures
traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .  To contact the reporter on this story:
