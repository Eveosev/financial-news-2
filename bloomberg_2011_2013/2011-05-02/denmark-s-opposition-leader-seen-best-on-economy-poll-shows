Danish Social Democrat leader Helle
Thorning-Schmidt, who most polls indicate may become the
country’s next head of government after elections due to be held
by November, is better qualified to guide  Denmark  out of the
economic crisis than Prime Minister Lars Loekke Rasmussen, a
Megafon poll published in newspaper Politiken showed.  Thirty-five percent of voters see Thorning-Schmidt as a
better candidate for economic policy, compared with 33 percent
who favor Rasmussen, according to the poll published today by
the Copenhagen-based newspaper.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
