Canada ’s dollar slid from almost the
highest level in more than three years on speculation the  New
Democratic Party  will deny Conservatives a majority in today’s
election and as crude oil dropped.  The loonie has fallen since April 20 against most of its
major counterparts amid concern the NDP may end up with a share
of power or create gridlock for Prime Minister Stephen Harper’s
Conservative minority government. At stake are tax reductions
worth C$6 billion ($6.3 billion) annually for businesses such as
Toronto-based Bank of Nova Scotia, which both the NDP and the
Liberals have pledged to reverse.  “The Harper government has been remarkably responsible and
successful,” said Joseph Trevisani, chief market analyst at FX
Solutions in Saddle River,  New Jersey . “If you end up weakening
or removing a successful government, the success of the
replacement government is certainly unproved and perhaps could
be worrisome considering its particular political bent.”  The loonie, as the Canadian currency is known for the image
of the aquatic bird on the C$1 coin, depreciated 0.6 percent to
95.06 cents versus the greenback at 5:00 p.m. in Toronto, from
94.51 cents on April 29. One Canadian dollar buys $1.0520. It
was the biggest decline on an intraday basis since April 18. The
Canadian currency touched 94.46 cents on April 29, the strongest
level since November 2007.  Election Outlook  Polls indicate the likeliest outcome of the election is
that Harper, in power since 2006 and leader of his party since
2003, will win his third consecutive minority government. The
Conservatives had 37 percent support among decided voters,
according to a CTV/Globe/Nanos tracking poll published May 1.
That’s down from a campaign high of 42 percent on April 4.  The NDP had 32 percent support, a gain of 12 percentage
points from the first poll of the campaign. The Liberals had 21
percent, down from 29 percent. The  Bloc Quebecois , which
supports separation from Canada and only runs candidates in the
French-speaking province, fell to 5.7 percent from 9.1 percent.
The telephone poll, taken April 30 and May 1, surveyed 1,200
eligible voters and has a margin of error of 2.8 percent.  Harper has said the NDP’s platform, which promises C$68.9
billion of new spending, will create a “lot of destruction”
for the economy because it would increase corporate tax rates
and implement a cap-and-trade system for carbon that would boost
the price of gasoline.  ‘Increase in Concern’  “We’ve certainly seen an increase in concern in what a
strengthening base of the NDP would mean going forward,” said
 Camilla Sutton , chief currency strategist at the capital markets
unit of Bank of Nova Scotia in Toronto. “In terms of the
market, there are a few issues. One is certainly the fiscal
side, and the other side would be any potential impact on oil
production in Canada.”  Futures on crude oil, Canada’s biggest export, slid 0.8
percent to $112.99 a barrel after falling as much as 2.7 percent
to $110.82. Silver futures decreased 9.8 percent to $43.85 an
ounce after falling as much as 13 percent to $42.20 an ounce.
 Raw materials  including oil account for about half of Canada’s
export revenue.  Canadian  government bonds  were little changed, with the
yield on the 10-year security down less than one basis point, or
0.01 percentage point, to 3.20 percent. The price of the 3.5
percent security maturing in June 2020 rose 2 cents to C$102.34.  Canadian manufacturers’ costs for their raw-materials and
the prices of their finished goods rose in March faster than
economists forecast as crude oil rose.  The raw-materials price index increased 5.7 percent, the
fastest since June 2009,  Statistics Canada  reported today in
Ottawa. The gain exceeded all 11 forecasts in a Bloomberg News
survey of economists. The industrial-product price index climbed
0.9 percent, higher than the median forecast of 0.7 percent in a
survey of 14 economists.  To contact the reporter for this story:
