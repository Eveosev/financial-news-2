Banksâ€™ non-marketable assets, such as
loans, had the biggest increase among forms of collateral used
by lenders as guarantees for raising cash from the  European
Central Bank  last year.  Non-marketable assets accounted for 18 percent, or about
362 billion euros ($538.95 billion), of total collateral put
forward by banks, compared with 14 percent, or about 285 billion
euros in 2009, the ECB said in its  annual report  today.  The share of  government bonds  employed as collateral rose 2
percentage points to 13 percent. Asset-backed securities, the
most popular form of collateral used by financial institutions,
increased 1 percentage point to 24 percent, the ECB said.  The average value of assets deposited by banks declined to
2.01 trillion euros in 2010 from 2.03 trillion euros a year
earlier, according to the Frankfurt-based central bank.  To contact the reporters on this story:
