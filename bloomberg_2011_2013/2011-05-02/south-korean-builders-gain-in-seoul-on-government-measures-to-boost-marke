Daewoo Engineering & Construction Co.
paced gains among shares of South Korean builders after the
government announced measures to aid the industry.  Daewoo Engineering rose 3.1 percent to 11,750 won as of
11:18 a.m. on the Korea Exchange.  Hyundai Development Co. (012630)  jumped
7.3 percent, the best performer on the MSCI Asia Pacific Index,
while  Samsung C&T Corp. (000830)  added 4.1 percent.  South Korea ’s government announced policy measures
yesterday to aid troubled builders and the  property market ,
including tax incentives for real estate investment trusts that
buy unsold housing. In recent months, 29 of South Korea’s 100
largest builders applied for financial support due to a
prolonged construction and real estate slump.  “Investors are cheering supportive measures by the
government especially given many builders had underperformed
other sectors this year,” said Im Jeong Jae, a Seoul-based  fund
manager  at Shinhan BNP Paribas Asset Management Co., which
oversees about $30 billion. “Still, we’ll have to see how
effective their measures are.”  The 36-member Korea Construction Index climbed 2.7 percent
to the highest level since Feb. 10. The industry gauge has
advanced 1.6 percent this year, compared with a 8.2 percent gain
in the  Kospi Index. (KOSPI)   South Korea will establish a bank to purchase soured loans
owed by builders and developers, the nation’s financial
regulator said yesterday. The government will also encourage
financial institutions to actively extend debt maturities and
provide fresh loans to builders deemed viable.  In the three months through March, construction investment
declined 11.9 percent from a year earlier, even as gross
domestic product expanded 4.2 percent, according to a government
statement yesterday.  GS Engineering & Construction Corp. (006360)  rose 2.7 percent, while
Hyundai Engineering & Construction Co. gained 1.7 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
