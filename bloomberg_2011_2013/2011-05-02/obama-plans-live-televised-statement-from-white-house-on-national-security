President  Barack Obama  planned to make
a live statement from the White House, the administration
announced. A White House official said the topic dealt with
national security, refusing to give details.  The president was scheduled to appear as early as 10:30
p.m. Washington time.  A presidential statement late on a Sunday night is unusual
and the administration wouldnâ€™t say what Obama would be
addressing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
