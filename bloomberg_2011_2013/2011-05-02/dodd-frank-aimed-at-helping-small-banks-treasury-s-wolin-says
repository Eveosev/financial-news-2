Deputy Treasury Secretary Neal Wolin
said the Dodd-Frank financial overhaul law is aimed at
protecting U.S. small banks while limiting risk at large
institutions.  “Lawmakers who drafted the legislation took great care to
protect and strengthen the country’s rich network of community
banks,” Wolin said in text prepared for a speech before a group
of community bankers today in  Washington . “It’s critical that
we avoid the concentration that exists in the banking sectors of
so many other countries.”  Wolin said Dodd-Frank “focuses on constraining risk at the
largest institutions.” The law also “levels the playing field
between small banks and non-bank financial service providers,
such as payday lenders and independent mortgage brokers,” he
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
