     May 2 (Bloomberg) --  Panasonic Corp. (6752) , the world’s largest
maker of plasma televisions, rose the most in almost six weeks
in  Tokyo  trading after announcing plans to cut jobs and
restructure operations to restore profitability.  Panasonic gained as much as 3.3 percent, the biggest
intraday gain since March 22, and traded up 2.5 percent at 1,023
yen as of 10:24 a.m. The benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock Average rose
1 percent.  Japan ’s biggest maker of home appliances plans to eliminate
17,000 jobs over two years and to stop further investment in
both plasma and liquid-crystal display operations to revive
profitability at the TV unit, the Osaka-based company said April
28. Panasonic said it will seek overseas alliances to expand in
industrial-use solar systems.  “The market reacted to Panasonic’s 17,000 job cuts and
restructuring plans,” said  Nobuo Kurahashi , an analyst at
Mizuho Financial Group Inc. in Tokyo. “Ending investments in TV
display operations makes sense. Panasonic made it clear that it
will focus on units that will be more profitable in the future,
such as solar systems.”  The company delayed issuing an earnings forecast, citing
difficulties in making an estimate because of disruptions
following the March 11 earthquake in Japan.  To contact the reporters on this story:
