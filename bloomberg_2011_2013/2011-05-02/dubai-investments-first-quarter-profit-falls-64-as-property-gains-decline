Dubai Investments PJSC (DIC) , which owns
stakes in more than 40 companies, reported a 64 percent drop in
first-quarter profit as gains from property investments fell.  Net income declined to 101 million dirhams ($27 million)
from 277.7 million dirhams a year earlier, the company said in a
 statement  to the Dubai bourse today. Gains from investment
properties fell to 33 million dirhams from 168 million dirhams.  Real-estate prices in Dubai have slumped 62 percent from
their peak in mid-2008 after the global credit crisis caused
mortgage lending to dry up and speculation-driven demand to
wane, Deutsche Bank AG said in February.  House prices  in the
 United Arab Emirates  may drop another 30 percent as population
growth stagnates and more new properties are put onto the
market, Dubai Investment bank Rasmala said in March.  Dubai Investments, which operates in businesses including
glass production, real estate, financial services and
investments, plans to borrow about $300 million from banks,
Chairman Khalid bin Kalban said in February. The financing may
be used for the expansion of its glass factory in  Abu Dhabi  and
acquisitions by its unit Masharie LLC.  Total income for the first-quarter fell to 642.7 million
from 859.1 million dirhams in the year-ago period, according to
todayâ€™s statement.  The shares slid 2.8 percent to close at 87.8 fils
yesterday. The stock has gained 13 percent this year compared
with a 5.9 percent loss in the Dubai Financial Market Real
Estate Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
