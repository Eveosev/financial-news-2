Al-Qaeda leader Osama  bin Laden  has
been killed by U.S. assets in a mansion outside Islamabad, U.S.
officials said. President Barack Obama will announce the death
of the terrorist leader tonight.  Obama will deliver the news to the nation in an address
from the White House, almost 10 years after the Sept. 11 attacks
that bin Laden orchestrated. Bin Laden was killed, along with
other members of his family, an official said.  Almost 3,000 people were killed on Sept. 11, most at the
World Trade Center in  New York  and the Pentagon in Virginia just
outside of  Washington .  The administration has been briefing congressional
officials ahead of the president’s address.  Obama and his predecessor, former President  George W. Bush ,
made capturing Bin Laden a key national security priority. Obama
has called the border between Afghanistan and Pakistan the
“epicenter of violent extremism,” where he said al-Qaeda
leader bin Laden was hiding.  The news brought a cheering, chanting crowd outside the
White House fence before Obama was set to appear on television.  To contact the reporter on this story:
