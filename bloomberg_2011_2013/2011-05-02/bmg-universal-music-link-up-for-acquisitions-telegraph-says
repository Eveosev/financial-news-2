BMG Rights Management, jointly owned
by Bertelsmann AG and KKR & Co., and  Universal Music  Group may
make joint bids for EMI Group Ltd. and  Warner Music  Group, the
Daily Telegraph reported, without saying where it got the
information.  BMG Rights and Universal have agreed on plans to divide up
the catalogs of Warner and EMI so as to avoid regulatory
difficulties, the newspaper said.  Billionaire Len Blavatnik and a group of companies led by
the Gores Brothers will make binding offers for Warner Music
this week and are the likeliest buyers of the company; EMI will
probably be put up for sale by  Citigroup Inc. (C)  in the next two
months, the Telegraph said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
