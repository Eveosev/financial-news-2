A proposed renewable energy agency in
 Brazil  may lead to more government incentives in the industry, a
Bloomberg analyst said.  A bill that would create the new agency is being considered
by the Senate’s Comissao de Constituicao, Justica e Cidadania,
after it was approved April 28 by another committee, the Senate
 said on its website .  Creating a national agency to formulate clean energy
policies would mark a “change in mentality,” for Brazil’s
government, which seems to consider renewable energy “too
costly,” according to Maria Gabriela da Rocha Oliveira, an
analyst at Bloomberg New Energy Finance in Sao Paulo office.  “The creation of this agency will accelerate the flow of
funds and incentives to the sector,” she said today by phone.
“It’s a small step but could lead to bigger steps.”  The proposed Agencia Nacional de Energias Renovaveis would
be responsible for formulating policies for solar, biomass,
wind, marine and hydroelectric energy, according to the  draft
legislation .  If it is approved by the committee, the bill will be
considered by Brazil’s lower house. The Senate’s Comissao de
Servicos de Infra-Estrutura approved the bill April 28.  To contact the reporter on this story:
