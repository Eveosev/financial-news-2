The strength of the euro may prove to
be a greater concern for  Europe ’s so-called peripheral nations
than rising interest rates, said Jean-Michel Six, chief European
economist at rating agency Standard & Poor’s.  “The very strong currency that we are about to see in the
coming months in my opinion is likely to be a bigger problem for
Spain, Portugal, even Italy as far as their competitiveness is
concerned,” Six said today in an interview with Maryam Nemazee
on Bloomberg Television’s “The Pulse.”  “Interest rates in real terms corrected for inflation are
still very negative,” Six said.  The euro appreciated 0.3 percent to $1.4849 as of 12:15
