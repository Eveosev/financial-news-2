Ecuador  business confidence fell to a
two-year low on concern a conflict with the U.S., the South
American nation’s biggest trading partner, may hurt exports and
decrease foreign investment, Deloitte & Touche LLP said.  An index measuring company confidence in Ecuador fell to
76.2 last month out of a possible 250, its lowest since April
2009, the consulting firm’s  Quito office  said today in a report.  Ecuador on April 5 expelled the U.S. ambassador to  Quito ,
Heather Hodges, in protest over allegations she made in a
classified diplomatic cable, made public by the anti-secrecy
group WikiLeaks, that President  Rafael Correa  had knowingly
appointed a corrupt police chief. The U.S. retaliated by
expelling Ecuador’s ambassador to  Washington  and halting
bilateral talks.  “One of executives’ biggest concerns is the diplomatic
impasse with the U.S. caused by the filtration of WikiLeaks
reports,” Deloitte said in the survey. “Executives expressed
their doubts about the effects and consequences this could cause
to bilateral relations and trade.”  Deloitte said 79 percent of executives surveyed think
current economic conditions are scaring away foreign investment,
while 66 percent said their company’s sales were unchanged or
lower in April than in March, according to the survey.  Deloitte didn’t publish the number of survey participants
or report a margin of error.  To contact the reporter on this story:
