The Czech state budget deficit reached
50 percent of the full-year plan in the January-April period as
revenue rose from a year ago and spending declined, the  Finance
Ministry  said.  The central state budget, the biggest part of public
finances that serve as the fiscal yardstick for assessing a
European Union member’s readiness to adopt the euro, had a
shortfall of 67.5 billion koruna ($4.1 billion) in the first
four months of the year, down from 78.2 billion koruna in the
same period of 2010.  The budget revenue totaled 325.97 billion koruna, up from
321.52 billion koruna. Expenditure stood at 393.47 billion
koruna, compared with 399.75 billion koruna a year ago. The
government plans to narrow the public-finance deficit to less
than the EU’s limit of 3 percent of economic output by 2013,
from 4.7 percent in 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
