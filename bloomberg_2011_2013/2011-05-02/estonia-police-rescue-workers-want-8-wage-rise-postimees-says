Estonian police and rescue workers
will demand a wage increase of at least 8 percent from next
year,  Postimees  reported, citing the chairman of the public
workersâ€™ trade union association.  The increase would restore wages to the level earned before
budget cuts in 2009, Kalle Liivamagi was quoted by the Tallinn-
based newspaper as saying. Unions will also demand all public
workers would get their wages raised back to levels in 2008, the
paper said. The demands will be officially filed on May 18.  To contact the reporters on this story:
