Companies in the European Union’s
carbon trading system used a record 137 million offset credits
from the  United Nations ’ emission-reduction programs in 2010, up
from around 81 million in 2009, according to EU data.  Total emissions in the EU rose to 1.932 billion metric tons
in 2010 from 1.879 billion in 2009, the data published by the
 European Commission  showed today. The 2.8 percent increase in
discharges under the EU system, the world’s largest cap-and-
trade program, was smaller than a preliminary figure of a 3.5
percent rise released last month.  More than 12,000 facilities in the EU emissions system,
including  Italy ’s largest utility  Enel SpA (ENEL)  and the European
units of the Indian steel producer Tata Steel Ltd., are allowed
to use UN credits as a cheaper way to comply with pollution
quotas. One permit gives the right to discharge one ton of CO2.  The usage of Certified Emission Reductions, issued under
the UN Clean Development Mechanism for investment in projects
that cut  greenhouse gases  in developing countries, rose to 117
million tons from 78 million tons in 2009, the data published by
the European Commission showed today.  EU allowances for delivery in December fell 0.3 percent to
17.09 euros a metric ton as of 12:02 a.m. on  London ’s ICE
Futures Europe exchange. CERs for December eased 0.2 percent to
13.11 euro.  In 2010, EU emitters also surrendered 20 million Emission
Reduction Units, generated under the UN Joint Implementation
program, according to the commission data. In 2009, 3.2 million
ERUs were used for compliance with the EU quotas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
