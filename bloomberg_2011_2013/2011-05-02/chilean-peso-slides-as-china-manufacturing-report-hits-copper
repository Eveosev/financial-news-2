Chile ’s peso fell for the first time
in five days as copper reached a seven-week low after an index
of manufacturing declined in  China , the biggest buyer of Chilean
copper.  The peso lost 0.2 percent to 461.33 per  U.S. dollar  at
10:55 a.m. New York time from 460.45 on April 29, retreating
from the biggest weekly gain in three months last week.  “The peso started down despite the positive global mood as
copper prices hit a seven-week low on weak data from China,”
said Katia Diaz, an economist at 4Cast Inc. in New York. “The
market seems reluctant to go through the 460 support level,
which suggests there may be some fear of intervention.”  Copper reached the lowest since March 15 after the
Purchasing Managers’ Index fell to 52.9 in April from 53.4 in
March. The metal for July delivery, little changed at 10:43 a.m.
 New York  time, fell as much as 1.7 percent to $4.1075 a pound.
Copper accounts for about half of Chile’s exports.  Foreign investors in Chile’s forwards market increased bets
against the peso to $1.7 billion on April 28 from $1.6 billion
on April 27, central bank data show.  The peso rose 1.5 percent last week, surpassing the level
where the central bank announced a $12 billion dollar-buying
program in January. It’s the fastest-rising of seven regional
currencies tracked by Bloomberg in the last 12 months as the
central bank lifted  interest rates  more than any other.  To contact the reporter on this story:
