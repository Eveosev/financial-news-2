Syndicated loans to Brazilian
companies will exceed $30 billion this year as rising
infrastructure investment boosts demand for structured finance
in  Latin America ’s largest economy, according to a Banco
Santander Brasil SA executive.  Demand is rising as structured loans allow companies to
raise capital without increasing debt, Andre Fernandes
Berenguer, head of global banking and markets at Santander
Brasil said in an April 20 interview in Sao Paulo.  “This is the year of structured finance,” said the
executive. “For companies, it’s the instrument that has served
best for capital-intensive projects for infrastructure.”  The volume of syndicated loans may surpass the 2007 record
of $29.9 billion, Berenguer said. Loans last year totaled $5
billion, less than half of the $13.4 billion available in Latin
America, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. This year to
date, loans to Brazilian companies amounted to $8.8 billion.  Santander rose to fifth place in Brazilian syndicated loans
this year from sixth last year, with four deals worth $931.6
million. Santander arranged three loans last year totaling
$261.6 million to Banco Daycoval SA, Braskem SA and Embraer SA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
