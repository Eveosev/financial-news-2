Empresas ICA SAB,  Mexico ’s largest
construction company, said first-quarter net income rose 34
percent on higher sales from industrial construction.  Profit increased to 293 million pesos ($25.5 million) from
218 million pesos a year earlier, Mexico City-based ICA said
today in an e-mailed statement. Revenue rose 21 percent to 8.54
billion pesos.  A Mexican government push to build roads, bridges,
hospitals and other infrastructure projects has spurred ICA’s
sales. During the quarter, ICA won a 5.4 billion-peso contract
to build a second-level on a Mexico City highway and work
continued on clean-fuels projects at four government-owned oil
refineries.  Net income was higher than the 237 million pesos estimated
by Francisco Chavez, an analyst with the Mexican unit of  Spain ’s
Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA, in an April 27 report.
Chavez forecast sales at 8.19 billion pesos.  Sales at ICA’s civil construction unit rose 19 percent to
5.62 billion pesos and industrial construction sales jumped 42
percent to 1.05 billion, the company said. ICA’s backlog of
projects was 44.7 billion pesos at the end of March, up from
38.2 billion pesos a year earlier.  ICA rose 30 centavos, or 1.1 percent, to 28.72 pesos in
Mexico City trading at 4:10 p.m. New York time. The shares have
dropped 9.2 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
