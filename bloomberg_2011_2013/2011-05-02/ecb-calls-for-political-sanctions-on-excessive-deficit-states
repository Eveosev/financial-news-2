The  European Central Bank  called for
“political” sanctions to be imposed on euro-area states that
run excessive budget deficits.  In its 2010 annual report published today, the Frankfurt-
based ECB said it’s “particularly concerned about insufficient
automaticity” of financial penalties and “calls for the
introduction of political and reputational measures on top of
financial sanctions to foster early compliance with the
surveillance framework.”  ECB officials have repeatedly said that euro-area
governments are not doing enough to prevent a recurrence of the
debt crisis that’s hobbled  Greece , Ireland and  Portugal . The
central bank wants financial sanctions to automatically come
into play once a nation breaches deficit limits, rather than
allowing politicians to decide.  “The room for discretion left to” politicians when
assessing the existence of an excessive deficit “should be
reduced,” the ECB said.  Under the so-called Stability and Growth Pact, euro-area
states should not have an annual budget deficit of more than 3
percent of gross domestic product or outstanding debt of more
than 60 percent of GDP.  To contact the reporter on this story:
