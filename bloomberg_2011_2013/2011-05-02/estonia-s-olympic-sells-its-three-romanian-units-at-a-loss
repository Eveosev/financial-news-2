Olympic Entertainment Group AS (OEG1T) ,
eastern  Europe ’s only publicly traded casino operator, said it
sold its unprofitable Romanian subsidiaries to an Israeli
entrepreneur.  A loss of 2.5 million euros ($3.7 million) will be booked
in the first quarter from the sale of the three units, the
Tallinn-based company said in a regulatory statement today.  Olympic decided to withdraw from the Romanian market as no
profits have been made there and there’s no prospect in the near
future of reaching levels of profitability possible in other
areas, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
