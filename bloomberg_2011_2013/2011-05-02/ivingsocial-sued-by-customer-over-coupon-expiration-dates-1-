LivingSocial , the second-largest
Internet coupon site, was sued by a customer in  Minnesota  over
claims the company violates federal and state laws prohibiting
the sale of gift certificates with expiration dates.  LivingSocial misled “tens of millions of consumers
nationwide” by creating a sense of urgency with mass “Daily
Deal” e-mails promising bargains for buyers who acted fast,
customer Amy Schultz said in her complaint. Consumers were
rushed into buying gift certificates they wouldn’t have time to
use, she said.  “LivingSocial and its retail partners bank on the fact
that consumers often will not redeem ‘livingsocial’ gift
certificates before the limited expiration period,” her
attorneys said in the April 29 complaint. “Therefore, many
consumers are left with nothing, despite having already paid for
the particular service or product.”  Schultz filed the lawsuit on behalf of all LivingSocial
customers nationwide, asking the federal court in  Minneapolis  to
allow her to pursue the claim in a group, or class-action, suit.  Maire Griffin, spokeswoman for Washington-based
LivingSocial, didn’t immediately respond to an e-mail for
comment. LivingSocial is the second-largest online coupon site,
behind Groupon Inc.  The case is Schultz v. Hungry Machine Inc., 11-cv-01136,
U.S. District Court of Minnesota (Minneapolis).  To contact the reporters on this story:
