(Corrects percentage change in gas prices in third
paragraph of story published yesterday.)  Chesapeake Energy Corp. (CHK) , the most
active U.S. natural-gas driller, reported a first-quarter loss
after losing $725 million on energy hedging contracts.  Chesapeake had a net loss of $205 million, or 32 cents a
share, compared with net income of $732 million, or $1.14 a year
earlier, the Oklahoma City-based company said in a statement
issued today on  Business Wire .  The company lost $725 million in the quarter associated
with contracts used to lock in commodity prices, according to
the statement. The average price of gas during the quarter on
the  New York Mercantile Exchange  fell 16 percent to $4.197 per
million British thermal units from $4.989 in the first three
months of 2010.  After adjusting for the hedging losses and certain other
gains and expenses, Chesapeake earned $518 million, or 75 cents
a share. The company was expected to report adjusted earnings of
71 cents a share, based on the average of 32 analysts’ estimates
compiled by Bloomberg.  Chesapeake reported revenue of $1.61 billion in the
quarter, compared with $2.8 billion a year earlier.  The lower prices, “combined with higher operating costs,
really create the lower earnings impact,” Michael Bodino, head
of energy research for Global Hunter Securities LLC, said in an
e-mail. Bodino rates Chesapeake’s shares a “buy” and owns
none.  Oil Revenue  Chesapeake said its oil-and-gas production was 20 percent
higher than in the first quarter of 2010 at an average
equivalent of 3.1 billion cubic feet of gas a day. The
percentage of revenue from oil and gas liquids rose to 23
percent during the quarter from 17 percent in the first quarter
of 2010.  The company spent $5 billion last year buying new leases so
that a greater proportion of its output is oil, which gained 20
percent in  New York  compared with the first quarter of 2010.  Chesapeake Chief Executive Officer Aubrey McClendon said on
Jan. 6 the company would cut its debt 25 percent in two years
while increasing production 25 percent. Chesapeake is the most
active U.S. gas driller, according to data compiled by  Baker
Hughes Inc. (BHI)   Chesapeake announced in January the sale of a one-third
stake in its Niobrara shale field for $570 million to  Cnooc
Ltd. (883) ,  China ’s largest offshore energy producer. Chesapeake sold
its wells and pipelines in the Fayetteville Shale to  BHP
Billiton  in March for $4.75 billion.  Second-Quarter Gain  Chesapeake said it will gain $200 million in the second
quarter from a transaction involving its ownership in Frac Tech
Services LLC, an oilfield-services company.  The earnings were released after the close of regular
trading on U.S. markets. Chesapeake fell $1.05, or 3.26 percent,
to $32.18 at 5:11 p.m. in after-hours trading on the New York
Stock Exchange. The shares have 16 buy ratings from analysts, 16
holds and two sells.  Chesapeake joined other energy companies in reporting
hedging losses in the quarter. Energy Future Holdings Corp., the
Texas power company, reported losses of $203 million on
contracts tied to the price of natural gas.  Valero Energy Corp. (VLO) ,
the San Antonio-based refiner, reported a $352 million hedging
loss.  To contact the reporter on this story:
