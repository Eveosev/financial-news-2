The U.S. Treasury Department lowered
its estimate for  government borrowing  from April through June
because of higher revenue and reduced government spending.  Borrowing will total a net $142 billion in the current
quarter, that is $156 billion less than estimated three months
ago, the department said in a statement today in  Washington . The
Treasury also projected borrowing of $405 billion in the three
months to Sept. 30. In the quarter that ended March 31, the
Treasury borrowed $265 billion, compared with a previous
estimate of $237 billion.  The Treasuryâ€™s quarterly debt sales announcement is
scheduled for May 4.  The Treasury said its  forecasts  assume a cash balance of
$95 billion for June 30 and $115 billion for the end of
September.  The  U.S. economy  slowed more than forecast in the first
quarter as  government spending  declined by the most since 1983
and household purchases cooled. Gross domestic product rose at a
1.8 percent annual rate from January through March after a 3.1
percent pace in the final three months of 2010, the Commerce
Department said last week.  To contact the reporters on this story:
