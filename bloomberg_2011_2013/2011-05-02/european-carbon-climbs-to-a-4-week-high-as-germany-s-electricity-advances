European Union carbon-dioxide permits
jumped to an almost four-week high as German power prices rose,
increasing demand for pollution rights.  EU allowances for delivery in December gained as much as
1.3 percent to 17.37 euros a metric ton, the highest level since
April 5, and traded at 17.36 euros as of 3:13 p.m. on  London ’s
ICE Futures Europe exchange. Trading volume was 3.95 million
tons compared with a daily average of 11.9 million tons the past
30 days. The U.K. market closed today for a holiday.  German baseload power for next year, a European benchmark,
increased 1.1 percent to 59.85 euros a megawatt-hour in Berlin,
according to broker prices on Bloomberg, the highest intraday
level since April 11. Power markets can affect the price of
carbon as utilities buy emissions permits for future production.  United Nations carbon offsets also increased as the EU data
today showed companies in the European emissions trading system
used a record 137 million UN credits in 2010. More than 12,000
facilities in the EU cap-and-trade program are allowed to use UN
credits as a cheaper way to comply with pollution quotas. One
permit gives the right to discharge one ton of CO2.  UN Certified Emission Reductions for December rose 1.2
percent to 13.11 euros. The usage of CERs, issued under the UN
Clean Development Mechanism for investment in projects that cut
 greenhouse gases  in  developing countries , increased to 117
million tons last year from 78 million tons in 2009, the data
published by the European Commission showed.  In 2010, EU emitters also surrendered 20 million Emission
Reduction Units generated under the UN Joint Implementation
program, according to the commission’s figures. In 2009, 3.2
million ERUs were used for compliance with the EU quotas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
