Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh denounced
the U.S. killing of al-Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden, while a
 Palestinian Authority  spokesman said his death will be “good
for peace.”  “This is a continuance of the U.S. policy of atrocities,”
Haniyeh told reporters today in Gaza City.  Hamas, which is considered a terrorist group by the U.S.,
European Union, and Israel, is scheduled to sign a
reconciliation agreement with Palestinian Authority President
Mahmoud Abbas of the Fatah faction this week in Cairo.  Ghassan Khatib, a spokesman for the Ramallah, West Bank-
based Palestinian Authority, said the absence of bin Laden will
be “good for peace and stability” around the world. Khatib
spoke in a phone interview.  Hamas has ruled Gaza since 2007, when it ousted Abbas’s
forces from the territory a year after winning parliamentary
elections. Haniyeh was deposed as prime minister by Abbas after
the Gaza action, leaving the Palestinian Authority in charge of
only the  West Bank .  To contact the reporters on this story:
