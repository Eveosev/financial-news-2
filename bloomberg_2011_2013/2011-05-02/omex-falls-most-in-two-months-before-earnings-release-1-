Desarrolladora Homex SAB,  Mexico ’s
biggest homebuilder, fell the most in two months before its
first-quarter earnings report, scheduled to be released today.  The stock dropped 3.3 percent in Mexico City trading, the
largest one-day decline since March 1, to 52.42 pesos at 4 p.m.
in  New York . Urbi Desarrollos Urbanos SAB, Mexico’s third-
largest builder, sank 3.2 percent, its biggest drop in ten
months, to 26.69 pesos. Urbi is also scheduled to report
earnings after the close of the market.  Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg cut their average forecast
for Homex’s first-quarter profit excluding some items by 11
centavos over the past four weeks to 1.08 pesos per share. The
average estimate for sales declined by 154 million pesos ($13.4
million) in that period to 4.17 billion pesos, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  Homex’s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization will fall 3 percent in the first quarter from a
year earlier because of costs related to an expansion into

report published April 28.  To contact the reporter on this story:
