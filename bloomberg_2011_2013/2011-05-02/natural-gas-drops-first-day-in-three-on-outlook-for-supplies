Natural gas futures declined for the
first time in three days in  New York  on speculation that rising
supplies will exceed demand for the fuel.  Gas futures dropped as much as 1.3 percent on predictions
of higher output after Baker Hughes Inc. said April 29 that the
number of gas rigs drilling in the U.S. rose by four to 882 last
week, the first increase in four weeks.  “The gas rig count is growing at a very healthy pace,”
said  Cameron Horwitz , an analyst at Canaccord Genuity in
Houston. “Traders are hesitant to push prices higher without a
turnaround in the market’s fundamentals.”  Natural gas for June delivery fell 3.6 cents, or 0.8
percent, to $4.662 per million British thermal units at 9:07
a.m. on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . The futures have
gained 5.8 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
