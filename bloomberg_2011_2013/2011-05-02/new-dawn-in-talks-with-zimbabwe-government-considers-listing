New Dawn Mining Corp. (ND)  is in talks with
the  Zimbabwe  government about a law that requires it to sell or
cede 51 percent of its shares to black Zimbabweans, the company
said on its website.  Toronto-listed New Dawn also said it is seeking partners
among Zimbabweâ€™s black-owned investment companies and pension
funds and is considering a listing on the Harare-based  Zimbabwe
Stock Exchange . New Dawn owns three gold mining companies in
Zimbabwe.  Miners in Zimbabwe have until May 9 to show how they will
comply with the law, known as the Indigenization and Empowerment
Act. The law requires all foreign-owned companies and all
companies owned by white Zimbabweans with assets of more than
$500,000 to dispose of 51 percent of shares to black
Zimbabweans.  To contact the reporter on this story:
