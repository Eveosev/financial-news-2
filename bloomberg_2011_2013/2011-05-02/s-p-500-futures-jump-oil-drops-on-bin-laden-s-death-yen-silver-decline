U.S. stocks fell, pulling the Standard
& Poor’s 500 Index down from an almost three-year high, as
declines in commodity producers overshadowed the killing of
 Osama bin Laden . Silver sank the most since January as CME Group
Inc. raised the amount of cash needed for speculative positions.  The S&P 500 slipped 0.2 percent to 1,361.22 at 4 p.m. in
New York, reversing an early advance. The Stoxx Europe 600 Index
climbed for an eighth day. The Dollar Index rose 0.1 percent to
73.038 to snap a nine-day slump, its longest losing streak since
2007. Oil retreated from a 31-month high, while silver futures
plunged 5.2 percent to settle at $46.084 an ounce after touching
a 31-year high last week. Ten-year Treasury yields lost one
basis point to 3.28 percent, near an almost six-week low.  Producers of energy and raw materials led declines among
industry groups in the S&P 500.  Bin Laden , who used a family
inheritance to build the terrorist network that killed almost
3,000 people in the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks in New York and
 Washington , was killed in a U.S. operation in Pakistan,
President  Barack Obama  said in a televised address last night.  “The killing of Osama bin Laden is not a material event for
the stock market,” said  Andrew Ross , partner and global equity
trader at First New York Securities LLC, a New York-based
proprietary trading firm that bets on stocks, commodities and
derivatives. “It’s a great day for the country, but the market
impact should prove to be limited,” he said, adding that concern
may shift to “some sort of violent response by al-Qaeda.”  Earnings, Takeovers  The  S&P 500  fell for the first time in five days after last
week’s 2 percent rally, which was triggered after companies such
as Caterpillar Inc. and Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. reported
profit that topped analyst estimates.  Earnings-per-share beat analyst projections at three-
quarters of the 302 companies in the S&P 500 that reported
results since April 11, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Exxon Mobil Corp. and Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc.
lost 1.2 percent each to pace losses in commodity producers
today.  Takeovers and higher-than-estimated growth in manufacturing
helped propel the market’s early advance.  Shares of Cephalon Inc. rallied 4 percent after Teva
Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. announced plans to buy the
drugmaker for $6.8 billion, while International Coal Group Inc.
surged 31 percent after Arch Coal Inc. bid $3.4 billion in a
takeover offer. About $823 billion in takeover deals have been
announced globally so far in 2011, a 25 percent increase from
the same period in 2010, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Manufacturing Growth  The Institute for Supply Management’s manufacturing index
fell to 60.4 in April from 61.2 a month earlier. Figures greater
than 50 signal expansion. The median forecast of 78 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News was 59.5. Estimates ranged from 57.5
to 62.  Bin Laden was killed by U.S. operatives after a firefight
at a compound in  Pakistan , Obama said. The news comes almost 10
years after the Sept. 11 attacks on the World Trade Center in
New York and the Pentagon in  Virginia  just outside of
Washington. The KSE 100 Index, Pakistan’s benchmark stock gauge,
slipped 0.2 percent after rising 0.6 percent earlier.  “This is a victory for the U.S., just less of one that
might have been the case a few years ago,”  Bob Doll ,  New York- 
based chief equity strategist at BlackRock Inc., which oversees
$3.65 trillion as the world’s biggest money manager, said in an
e-mail to Bloomberg News. “Many bin Laden lieutenants have
risen in the ranks. So while more than a symbolic victory, this
does not kill al-Qaeda.”  2011 Rally  The S&P 500 has rallied about 8.2 percent in 2011 as
takeovers, higher-than-estimated earnings and economic reports
bolstered investors’ confidence. The S&P 500 Total Return Index,
which measures the gauge’s performance including reinvested
dividends, rallied for an eighth straight month in April to
match its longest streak of gains since 1995.  “My biggest concern about the stock market is the rising
optimism, which is usually indicative of a peak,” said  Byron Wien , the New York-based vice chairman of Blackstone Advisory
Partners, in an interview on April 28. “We’re not there yet, but
it’s brewing.”  The 0.1 percent gain in the Stoxx Europe 600 pushed it to a
two-month high as the regional benchmark rose for an eighth
straight day, its longest winning streak in 10 months.  Grifols
SA (GRF)  surged 5.3 percent as the Spanish maker of blood-plasma
products won tentative U.S. antitrust approval to buy Talecris
Biotherapeutics Holdings Corp. for $4 billion. Danisco A/S rose
4.3 percent after DuPont Co. raised its bid for the Danish maker
of ingredients and enzymes.  Asian, Emerging Market Shares  U.K. equity markets were closed for a holiday today, along
with those in  China ,  Hong Kong  and  Singapore . The MSCI  Asia 
Pacific Index added 1 percent to its highest closing level since
June 2008, while the  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average gained 1.6 percent
to close above 10,000 for the first time since March 11, the day
 Japan  was struck by its largest earthquake and subsequent
tsunami.  Warren Buffett  said Berkshire Hathaway Inc. would be
“delighted” to invest in Japan and elsewhere in Asia.  The MSCI Emerging Markets Index climbed 0.2 percent and
closed at the highest level since June 2008. South Korea’s Kospi
index jumped 1.7 percent to a record after government data
showed the nation’s exports rose almost 27 percent from a year
earlier to a record $49.77 billion, increasing pressure on the
central bank to boost borrowing costs next week  Dollar Index Rebounds  The Dollar Index, which tracks the currency against those
of six trading partners, rebounded from the lowest level since
July 2008. The South Korean won rose 0.2 percent against its
U.S. counterpart and touched the highest level since August
2008.  The euro rose 0.2 percent versus the dollar and yen after a
gauge of manufacturing in the 17-nation currency region climbed
to 58 from 57.5 in March, London-based Markit Economics said in
a report, fueled by higher German and French output. The reading
was above an initial estimate on April 19.  Silver for July delivery pared losses after dropping as
much as 13 percent to $42.20 an ounce. The CME increased the so-
called initial margin by 13 percent to $14,513 per contract from
$12,825 after the close of business on Friday. Margins were
$4,250 a year ago.  Oil for June delivery fell as much as 2.7 percent to
$110.82 a barrel before erasing losses and settling down 0.4
percent at $113.52 in  New York .  To contact the reporters on this story:
