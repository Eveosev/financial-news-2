Swiss manufacturing growth
unexpectedly slowed last month to the weakest in more than a
year as companies reported faltering output and orders.  The SVME Purchasing Managers’ Index fell to 58.4 from 59.3
in March when adjusted for seasonal swings, Zurich-based  Credit
Suisse Group AG (CSGN)  said in an e-mailed statement today. That’s the
lowest since February 2010. Economists forecast an increase to
59.8, the median of eight estimates in a Bloomberg News survey
showed. A reading above 50 indicates expansion.  “Given how the index fluctuates, we should not jump to
conclusions about its level in a single month,” Credit Suisse
said in its statement. “Industrial activity should remain sound
over the coming months as the PMI is still well above the 50-
point growth threshold and 4.1 points higher than its long-term
average.”  A gauge measuring output fell 2.0 points to 57.3 from the
previous month, while a sub-indicator measuring companies’ order
backlog slipped to 55.2, the statement said.  “The slide in the backlog of orders component points to a
further slowdown in the growth of output,” Credit Suisse said
in its statement. Still, “hiring momentum remains high, a sign
that companies are still optimistic about the future.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
