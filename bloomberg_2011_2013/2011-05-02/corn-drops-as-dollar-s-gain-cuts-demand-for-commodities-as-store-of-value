Corn dropped as the dollar gained for
the first time in 10 days, reducing the appeal of commodities as
a hedge against inflation and on speculation that yields in the
U.S., the largest exporter, may improve on favorable weather.  Corn for July delivery lost as much as 1.7 percent to $7.44
a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade and traded at $7.5025 by
12:11 p.m. London time.  “Commodities are being weighed down across the board today
mainly by the dollar,” said Lee Joon, a senior trader at Woori
Futures Co., in  Seoul .  Corn yields in the U.S. Midwest may be “well above trend”
by the time of the harvest because more favorable conditions are
expected in June and July, David Streit, a senior lead
forecaster at Commodity Weather Group LLC, said on April 29.  Soybeans for July delivery decreased as much as 0.9 percent
to $13.8125 a bushel, extending last month’s 1.2 percent
decline.  July-delivery wheat gained 0.1 percent to $8.02 a bushel
and milling wheat traded in Paris climbed 0.9 percent to 246.76
euros ($366.45) a metric tons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
