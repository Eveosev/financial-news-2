Elliott Advisors (UK) Ltd. said
 Actelion Ltd. (ATLN) ’s annual general meeting should be adjourned to
“later in May or June” because of a “potential legal defeat”
in Actelion’s U.S. court case with Asahi Kasei Pharma Corp. and
called for “a full disclosure of the findings” from the trial,
Elliott said in an e-mailed statement today.  An adjournment would give Actelion shareholders more time
to consider the future of the company, Elliott said in the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
