Turkish stocks advanced for a third
day as oil slumped and demand for riskier assets climbed after
al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden was killed.  The  ISE National 100 Index (XU100)  rose 272.28, or 0.4 percent, to
69,522.42 at the 5:30 p.m. close in Istanbul. The lira gained
for a second day and traded 0.2 percent stronger at 1.5175 per
dollar.  Oil dropped the most in almost seven weeks in  London  after
President  Barack Obama  said bin Laden had been killed, stoking
speculation that the risk of Middle East supply disruptions will
ease. Brent crude futures fell as much as 3.4 percent, the most
since March 15, and last traded up 0.1 percent.  Turkey  imports
almost all the oil it consumes, adding to a trade deficit that
in March nearly doubled to a record high from the same month a
year earlier.  “The fall in  oil prices  and commodity prices in general is
something that plays into Turkey’s hand,” Orhan Canli, a stock
trader at Is Investment, said by telephone. “It is certain if
the oil’s fall accelerates, we would be affected by this very
positively.”  Two-year benchmark bonds fell, sending yields up 3 basis
points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 8.37 percent, according to
the RBS Istanbul Benchmark Bond Index.  Inflation probably quickened to 4.4 percent in April, up
from 4 percent last month, according to the median estimate of
seven economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The state statistics
institute in Ankara will announce April inflation data tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
