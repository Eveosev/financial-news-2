Helvetia Holding AG (HELN) ,  Switzerland â€™s
fourth-biggest insurer, may cut as many as 50 jobs at its Alba
General Insurance Company Ltd., Phenix Insurance Co. and Phenix
Life Insurance Co. units.  Helvetia, which completed the purchase of the insurers in
November, said about 10 to 15 of these positions will be
eliminated through early retirement, spokesman Urban Henzirohs
said today in an e-mailed statement.  The St. Gallen-based insurer employs about 4,900 people
worldwide, 2,500 of which work in Switzerland, Henzirohs said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
