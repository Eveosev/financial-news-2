Silver futures plunged the most since
January as exchange owner CME Group Inc. raised the cash deposit
required for trading after prices reached a 31-year high last
week. Gold extended its rally to a record.  Margins for speculative positions on the CME’s Comex exchange
in  New York  rose 13 percent to $14,513 per silver contract after 
the close of business on April 29. Margins were $4,250 a year 
earlier. Prices gained 28 percent in April, the largest monthly 
gain since January 1983, as investors bought precious metals as an
alternative to a falling dollar. Gold reached a record $1,577.40
an ounce today on the Comex.  “Silver just got out of control on the upside, and it was
only a matter of time before it came down,” said Matt Zeman, a
strategist at Kingsview Financial in  Chicago . “The higher
margins are going to squeeze out the little guys. We’ll see the
spread between silver and gold close and a little more buying in
gold.”  Silver futures for July delivery plummeted $2.515, or 5.2
percent, to settle at $46.084 an ounce at 1:52 p.m. on the
Comex, the biggest decline since Jan. 4. Earlier, the price
slipped as much as 13 percent. Still, the metal has more than
doubled in the past year.  Gold futures for June delivery rose 70 cents to $1,557.10
and have gained 32 percent in the past year.  Speculators cut their net-long positions in New York silver
futures by 26 percent in the week ended April 26, according to
U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission data.  Speculative long positions, or bets prices will gain,
outnumbered short positions by 24,995 contracts on the Comex,
the CFTC said. As of April 29, the value of one silver contract
was $242,995.  Failed at $50  Silver also may have fallen after failing to top $50 last
week, Zeman said. The Comex record is $50.35 in January 1980.  “Silver takes three cracks at $50 and doesn’t make it,”
Zeman said. “That’s an excuse to take some profits.”  Silver may rebound as some traders buy back the metal to
cover short positions, said  Frank McGhee , the head dealer at
Integrated Brokerage Services said.  “The margins are catching a whole new crop of people the
wrong way,” McGhee said.  Silver has had the biggest gain this year on the Standard &
Poor’s GSCI Index of 24 commodities. The metal led the way in
April as commodities beat stocks, bonds and the dollar for a
fifth straight month, the longest stretch in at least 14 years.  Traders may be unwinding long-silver and short-gold
positions, according to McGhee, of Integrated Brokerage.  “Gold has done tremendously,” McGhee said. “People were
hedging into gold because silver was falling so much.”  Dollar Decline  The dollar fell for the 10th straight session against a
basket of six major currencies as investors sought higher-
yielding assets. The  Federal Reserve  last week said borrowing
costs would remain at a record low for an extended period.  “Gold is now a currency,” said  Dennis Gartman , an
economist and the editor of the Suffolk, Virginia-based Gartman
Letter. “It will supplant the yen as the third-most-important
reservable currency amongst the industrialized world’s central
banks.”  Platinum for July delivery rose $10.20, or 0.5 percent, to
$1,875.70 an ounce on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .
Palladium for June delivery dropped $8.05, or 1 percent, to
$784.10 an ounce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
