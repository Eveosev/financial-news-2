Geotermica del Norte SA, a Chilean
geothermal company, is seeking permission to build a 50-megawatt
project.  The Cerro Pabellon plant in northern  Chile ’s Antofagasta
region will be linked to the power grid by a 220-kilovolt
transmission line, the country’s environmental licensing agency
Comision Nacional del Medio Ambiente said on its  website  April
29.  Geotermica del Norte, based in Santiago, received
permission in 2009 to exploit the area’s geothermal resources,
according to the statement. It has filed for permits to build a
standard, 40-watt geothermal plant and a 10-megawatt binary
cycle power plant that uses a heat exchanger.  To contact the reporter on this story:
