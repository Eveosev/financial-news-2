Tokyo  Electric Power Co. is
considering installing an air-based system to cool water from
reactors at its crippled Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear station once
it is able to circulate fluids in the pressure vessels.  The proposed method may replace a heat exchanger that used
sea water as part of the cooling system that was knocked out
following the March 11 earthquake and tsunami, according to
Hikaru Kuroda, a nuclear facility management official at the
utility known as Tepco. A waterless mechanism would minimize the
risk of radiation leaking into the sea, he said at a media
briefing in Tokyo today.  Tepcoâ€™s inability to circulate fluids in the damaged
reactors and spent-fuel pools had forced the utility to use fire
engines and external pumps to pour millions of liters of water
to prevent them from overheating. Excess water has accumulated
in basements and trenches at the plant, preventing workers from
repairing cooling equipment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
