Gasoline was little changed as
President  Barack Obama  said that U.S. troops killed Osama bin Laden and on speculation that supplies fell last week after
refinery shutdowns.  Futures rebounded after sinking earlier as much as 2.6
percent. Obama said late yesterday that bin Laden, architect of
the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks in New York and  Washington , was
killed in Pakistan during a raid on the compound where he was
hiding. Power outages last week disrupted production at three
Texas refineries. U.S. inventories are at a 20-month low,
according to Energy Department data.  “I expect another draw in gasoline this week,” said  Andy Lipow , president of Lipow Oil Associates LLC in Houston. “The
market is being led up by gasoline, which is reflective of
refinery problems that are impacting supply.”  Gasoline for June delivery gained 0.1 cent to $3.3994 a
gallon at 10:45 a.m. on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange. Prices
earlier touched $3.31.  Oil and oil products have climbed this year as conflict in
North Africa and the Middle East intensified, threatening fuel
shipments. Gasoline has advanced 39 percent this year and was
the second-best-performing commodity in 2011 through April
behind silver, according to the Standard & Poor’s GSCI Total
Return Index.  Dollar Declines  Futures rose from today’s lows as the dollar sank for the
ninth day in 10 against the euro, losing 0.5 percent as of 10:46
a.m. in New York. A cheaper U.S. currency makes dollar-
denominated commodities more attractive to investors.  “The news about killing bin Laden may indicate that,
maybe, some of the problems in those volatile regions may
subside for a little while,” said  Gene McGillian , an analyst
and broker at Tradition Energy in  Stamford ,  Connecticut . “But
you still have the weak dollar, signs of economic improvement,
unrest in the Middle East, fighting in Libya.”  Gasoline stockpiles have dropped 35.5 million barrels from
Feb. 11 through April 22, according to Energy Department data.
The department is scheduled to report last week’s inventories on
May 4.  Regular retail gasoline rose 0.9 cent to $3.952 a gallon
yesterday, AAA said on its website. That’s the highest price
since July 27, 2008. The record was $4.114 on July 15 of that
year.  Heating oil for June delivery rose 0.57 cent to $3.2815 a
gallon on the exchange. The front-month contract has gained 29
percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
