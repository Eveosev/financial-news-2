Four groups of companies including PT
Adaro Energy and  Marubeni Corp. (8002)  have submitted final bids for a
$3.2-billion coal-fired power plant project in  Indonesia ’s Java
island, state utility PT Perusahaan Listrik Negara said.  Adaro, which is teaming up with Electric Power Development
Co. and  Itochu Corp. (8001) , and Marubeni will compete with China

its partner to build and operate the 2,000-megawatt power plant
in Pemalang, Central Java province, Listrik Negara said in a

will supply electricity to Java and Bali islands, is expected to
start production in 2017. Listrik Negara will decide the winner
