Yields on Brazilian interest-rate
futures contracts due after July 2012 fell as traders are
growing more confident in policy makers’ willingness to continue
to raise borrowing costs in the near term to curb inflation.  Yields on the futures contract due in January 2015 fell for
a fifth day, declining 2 basis points, or 0.02 percentage point,
to 12.62 percent at 3:19 p.m. in  New York . The yield on the
contract due in October increased 1 basis point to 12.21
percent.  Brazil ’s central bank said it will prolong its interest-
rate adjustment cycle at a slower pace even though a
“substantial” part of its fight against inflation has already
been carried out, according to the minutes of its April 19-20
monetary policy meeting released April 28. Yields on longer-term
contracts are falling today as investors remove some “inflation
premium,” said Vladimir Caramaschi, chief strategist at Credit
Agricole Brasil SA DTVM in  Sao Paulo .  “The market was concerned and worried that the central
bank would not hike as much as was necessary,” he said by
phone. Policy makers “were able, with the last minutes, to
regain part of their credibility.”  The central bank raised the benchmark Selic rate by 25
basis points to 12 percent on April 20 after 50 basis-point
increases at each of the two previous meetings this year. A
report to be released May 6 will show that inflation in the 12
months through April increased to 6.58 percent, according to the
median estimate of 27 economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  The central bank targets inflation of 4.5 percent plus or
minus two percentage points. Consumer price increases may exceed
6.5 percent between July and August, according to policy makers.  The real fell 0.2 percent to 1.5782 per  U.S. dollar , from
1.5754 on April 29.  To contact the reporter on this story:
