Bank of England Governor  Mervyn King 
said high debt levels pose “massive” economic challenges that
would be exacerbated by increased long-term interest rates.  “The economic consequences of high-level indebtedness now
would become more severe if rates were to rise,” King said
yesterday at a committee of the European Parliament in Brussels.
“It is the main reason why interest rates are so low.” King,
who is vice-chairman of the European Systemic Risk Board, was
commenting on challenges faced by the global economy.  Bank of England policy makers are split four ways over
monetary policy. The central bank probably will leave the key
interest rate at a record low of 0.5 percent at the next rate
meeting on May 5, according to the median of 43 forecasts in a
Bloomberg News survey of economists.  Last month, policy maker  Andrew Sentance  voted for an
increase to 1 percent,  Martin Weale  and  Spencer Dale  for a
quarter-percentage-point rise and  Adam Posen  for expansion of
the bond-purchase program. The rest of the nine-member Monetary
Policy Committee, including King, voted for no change.  The pound fell 1 percent to $1.6488 at 10:52 a.m. in
London. The yield on the 2-year government bond fell 14 basis
points to 1.038 percent.  “The problem of leverage, the sheer volume of debt in the
economy, is still very large and this poses massive macro-
economic challenges,” King said. “I think these macro-economic
challenges will last many years.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
