Massey Energy Co. (MEE) , the coal-mining
company that agreed in January to be acquired by  Alpha Natural
Resources Inc. (ANR) , tempered its production outlook after it
reported a first-quarter loss on surging costs.  The net loss of $7.7 million, or 7 cents a share, versus a
profit of $33.6 million, or 39 cents, a year earlier, Richmond,
Virginia-based Massey said today in a statement. The company was
expected to earn 39 cents, according to the median of six
analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Sales rose 38 percent,
to $949.8 million from $688.6 million.  Massey, owner of the Upper Big Branch mine near Montcoal,
 West Virginia , where 29 people died in April 2010, saw expenses
balloon to $934.3 million amid costs related to the deadliest
U.S. coal mine explosion in 40 years, its merger with Alpha and
losses on some of its coal contracts.  “We recognize that a lot of work remains to bring costs in
line to improve net profitability,” Chief Executive Officer
Baxter Phillips said in the statement. “We believe our
operations can achieve cost improvements as the year
progresses.”  Massey fell 53 cents, or 0.8 percent, to $67.71 in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading before the results were
released. The shares have gained 26 percent this year.  Higher Costs  Average cash costs for the first quarter increased 19
percent to $66.04 a ton. Revenue per ton swelled 20 percent to
$80.96.  “The increase was due largely to higher fixed cost
absorption on lower than planned production, higher sales-
related costs related to higher average sales prices and
increased costs for mining supplies and labor,” Massey said in
the statement.  The company plans to ship 41 million to 44 million tons of
coal this year, down from an earlier estimate of as much as 47
million tons, it said.  Massey said costs will average $64 to $67 a ton. The lower
end of its earlier projection was $59.  The company boosted its projected average price per ton to
$83 to $86 from the previous $81 to $86.  Alpha and Massey expect the merger to close after
shareholders vote on June 1. That will create the world’s third-
largest producer of metallurgical coal.  On a pro forma basis, the companies can produce 126 million
to 138.5 million tons of coal, with revenue of $8.5 billion and
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization
of $2.3 billion.  Alpha reports its first-quarter results tomorrow before the
stock market opens.  (Massey plans to hold a conference call tomorrow at 10 a.m.
