Indian stocks swung between gains and
losses.  Infosys Technologies Ltd. (INFO)  advanced as  State Bank of
India (SBIN)  dropped ahead of the central bank’s meeting tomorrow.  Infosys, India’s second-largest software exporter, advanced
after it promoted S.D. Shibulal to the post of chief executive
officer, picking the company veteran to boost earnings amid
rising competition for outsourcing deals.  State Bank  paced
declines among peers.  The Bombay Stock Exchange Sensitive Index, or Sensex, lost
25.72, or 0.1 percent, to 19,110.24 at 9:31 a.m. in Mumbai. The
S&P CNX Nifty Index on the National Stock Exchange dropped 0.3
percent to 5,730.40. The BSE 200 Index retreated 0.3 percent to
2,357.57.  Infosys gained 0.7 percent to 2927.15 rupees. State Bank
dropped 1.4 percent to 2,764.45 rupees.  Overseas funds sold a net 2.7 billion rupees ($61 million)
of Indian stocks on April 28, reducing their investments in
equities this year to 47.1 billion rupees, according to data on
the  website  of the Securities and Exchange Board of  India .  India’s economic growth and corporate earnings lured
foreign investors to buy a record $29.4 billion of local
equities last year and made the Sensex the best performer and
most expensive among the world’s 10 biggest markets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
