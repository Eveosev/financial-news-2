European stocks advanced for an eighth
day, the longest winning streak in 10 months, as U.S. President
 Barack Obama  said al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden was killed in
Pakistan yesterday.  Danisco A/S climbed to the highest since 1989 as the
world’s largest food-ingredients maker received an increased
takeover bid from DuPont Co.  Demag Cranes AG (D9C)  jumped 24 percent
after Terex Industrial Holding AG offered to buy the company.
 TNT NV (TNT)  lost 1.4 percent after the Dutch mail carrier that’s
spinning off its express unit said profit fell.  Actelion Ltd. (ATLN) 
plunged the most in 14 months.  The benchmark Stoxx  Europe  600 Index gained 0.1 percent to
283.93 at the 4:30 p.m. close in  London , a two-month high. The
gauge had the biggest monthly increase so far this year in April
as companies from Ericsson AB to Volkswagen AG reported better-
than-estimated earnings and the  Federal Reserve  maintained its
pledge to keep interest rates low for an “extended period.”  “Investors see bin Laden’s death as a very positive thing
for sentiment for now and as a reason to buy,” said Markus Huber, head of German sales trading at ETX Capital in London.
“Everyone is very positive at the moment as there is so much
liquidity around.”  Bin Laden  was killed by a team of U.S. operatives early
yesterday morning after a firefight at a house where he had been
hiding, Obama said. The President delivered the news to the
nation almost 10 years after the Sept. 11 attacks that bin Laden
orchestrated. Bin Laden was killed, along with other members of
his family in a compound in suburban Islamabad, an official
said. Almost 3,000 people were killed on Sept. 11, most at the
World Trade Center in  New York  and the Pentagon in  Virginia  just
outside of  Washington .  ‘Short Lived’ Reaction  The positive market reaction to bin Laden’s death will be
“short lived” as there are still concerns weighing on the
global economy, Christian Gattiker, Zurich-based head of
research at Bank Julius Baer & Co., said in an interview on
Bloomberg Television.  Of the 115 companies in the Stoxx 600 that have released
earnings since April 11, 67 have beaten analyst forecasts for
per-share profit, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That
compares with 76 percent of U.S. companies in the period.  European manufacturing growth accelerated more than
estimated in April, driven by higher output in  Germany  and
 France , suggesting the region’s economy is weathering surging
energy costs. A gauge of manufacturing in the 17-nation euro
area rose to 58 from 57.5 in March, London-based Markit
Economics said. That’s above an initial estimate of 57.7 on
April 19. A reading above 50 indicates growth.  U.S. Economy  A report today showed U.S. manufacturing cooled in April.
The Institute for Supply Management’s manufacturing index fell
to 60.4 in April from 61.2 a month earlier, the Tempe, Arizona-
based group said. The median forecast of 78 economists surveyed
by Bloomberg News was 59.5. Other data indicated construction
spending rose more than forecast in March.  In  China , a manufacturing index fell after the government
raised  interest rates  and lenders’ reserve requirements and
allowed gains in the yuan to pick up pace. The Purchasing
Managers’ Index was at 52.9 in April from 53.4 in March, China’s
logistics federation and the statistics bureau said. That missed
the 53.9 median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of 20 economists.  National benchmark indexes rose in 10 out of the 16 western
European markets trading today. Germany’s DAX climbed 0.2
percent and France’s CAC 40 added 0.1 percent. U.K. and Irish
equity markets are closed for a holiday.  Danisco, Demag  Danisco advanced 4.3 percent to 696.5 kroner as DuPont
raised its offer by 5.3 percent to 33.4 billion kroner ($6.6
billion) after the U.S. chemical maker failed to win enough
investor support for its initial takeover bid. The volume traded
today was more than five times the average over the past three
months, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Demag Cranes jumped 24 percent to 45 euros, the biggest
advance since its initial public offering in 2006, as Terex
Industrial offered 41.75 euros a share for the world’s largest
maker of harbor cranes.  Grifols SA (GRF)  rallied 5.3 percent to 14.08 euros, the highest
price in more than two years, after the Barcelona, Spain-based
maker of blood-plasma products said its purchase of Talecris
Biotherapeutics Holdings Corp. won tentative U.S. antitrust
approval.  Commerzbank AG (CBK)  rose 3.2 percent to 4.44 euros after
Germany’s second-biggest bank said profit in the first three
months of the year climbed 40 percent to a quarterly record as
it set aside less money to cover risky loans.  Auto Stocks  Carmakers posted the best performance among 19 industry
groups in the Stoxx 600 today as  Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW)  and
 Daimler AG (DAI)  led the advance. The two biggest makers of luxury
cars gained 1.2 percent to 64.44 euros and 0.6 percent to 52.51
euros, respectively.  Fiat SpA (F)  advanced 3.9 percent to 7.49 euros as its Chrysler
Group LLC unit reported its first quarterly profit since
emerging from bankruptcy reorganization in 2009.  K+S AG climbed 2.7 percent to 56.10 euros, an eight-week
high. Europe’s biggest potash producer said it’s more upbeat
about the remainder of this year after first-quarter profit
jumped 44 percent on higher demand for the crop nutrient and a
continued recovery in prices.  Clariant AG (CLN)  advanced 2.4 percent to 18.38 Swiss francs, the
highest level in four months, after Bank Vontobel AG upgraded
the Swiss chemical maker’s shares to “buy” from “hold.”  TNT limited gains in the Stoxx 600, sliding 1.4 percent to
16.40 euros, as the company said first-quarter net income
dropped to 123 million euros ($182 million) from 143 million
euros a year earlier. TNT restated the year-earlier figures to
include only businesses it plans to retain.
     Actelion sank 8.7 percent to 46.51 Swiss francs, the
largest decline since March 2010, after a U.S. jury decided the
Swiss biotechnology company should pay Asahi Kasei Pharma Corp.
