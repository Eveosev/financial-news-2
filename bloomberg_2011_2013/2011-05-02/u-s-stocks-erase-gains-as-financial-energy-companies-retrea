U.S. stocks erased gains as declines
in energy, technology and financial companies led a retreat that
wiped out an early rally triggered by the death of  Osama bin
Laden .  The Standard & Poorâ€™s 500 Index slipped less than 0.1
percent to 1,363.23 at 12:24 p.m. in  New York . The  Dow Jones
Industrial Average  rose 7.98 points, or 0.1 percent, to
12,818.52 after climbing as much as 65 points earlier.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
