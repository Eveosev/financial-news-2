Sony Online Entertainment, a unit that
makes role-play games, suspended service after discovering a
hacker gained access to 23,400 credit card and debit records
from non-U.S. customers.  The  Sony Corp. (6758)  division took its network down last night,
according to an e-mailed statement today. The San Diego-based
producer of multiplayer online games such as “EverQuest” and
“DC Universe Online” said engineers and security consultants
discovered “personal information from approximately 24.6
million SOE accounts may have been stolen.”  The breach also exposed information from an outdated 2007
database, including about 12,700 non-U.S. credit or debit card
numbers and expiration dates, and about 10,700 direct debit
records of customers in Austria,  Germany , the Netherlands and
Spain, the statement said.  The credit-card information that may have been stolen
didn’t include card security codes, or pins, that serve as a
second source of authentication, Sony said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
