Sudan  released Islamist leader Hassan al-Turabi today after he spent more than three months in
detention without charge, his daughter Salma al-Turabi said  by
telephone from Khartoum, the capital.  Turabi, who is the leader of the opposition Popular
Congress Party and helped Sudanese President Umar al-Bashir
seize power in a 1989 coup, was parliamentary speaker in the
1990s when Sudan hosted  Osama bin Laden . In December 1999,
Bashir dismissed Turabi after he backed legislation to curb
presidential powers, and Turabi has been in and out of jail
since then.  The Sudanese authorities “didn’t give an explanation on
the release, they didn’t say anything,” Turabi’s daughter said.
Turabi had been in a hospital since April 9, she said.  Turabi was arrested at his house on Jan. 17 after the
opposition said it was planning street protests similar to the
ones in  Tunisia  that ousted Tunisian President Zine El Abidine Ben Aliin January.  To contact the reporter on this story:
