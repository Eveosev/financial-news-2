Australian policies to encourage the
development of  renewable energy  projects will drive at least
A$36 billion ($39 billion) of investment by 2020, according to
Bloomberg New Energy Finance forecasts.  About A$28 billion will be spent to build large utility-
scale power projects such as wind farms, while a further A$8
billion will be invested by households and businesses in smaller
rooftop solar systems, according to a Bloomberg New Energy
Finance report issued today.  Australia  has set a target of generating 20 percent of its
electricity from renewable energy by 2020 and is proceeding with
a A$1.5 billion funding program to support solar projects. Prime
Minister  Julia Gillard  has said the government wants to set a
price on  carbon emissions  starting in July 2012 in preparation
for a trading system to begin as early as 2015.  “Strong levels of investment will continue, thanks to the
national targets and the rapidly falling costs of clean
energy,” Seb Henbest, who leads Bloomberg New Energy Finance’s
Sydney-based research team, said in a statement.  Australia trailed 10 nations in attracting funding for
“large-scale” renewable energy projects last year, matching
the U.K. with about $2.2 billion in financing, according to
statistics the group released last month. That compares with
$47.3 billion for China and $20.7 billion for the U.S.  BP Plc,  AGL Energy Ltd. (AGK)  and  CLP Holdings Ltd. (2) ’s unit
TRUenergy Holdings Pty are vying for government solar grants to
develop projects using photovoltaic panels to turn sunlight into
power, while a joint proposal from Suntech Power Holdings Co.
and  Infigen Energy (IFN)  is another of the shortlisted ventures.  While renewable energy investment in Australia is expected
to fall to A$3 billion in 2011 from more than A$4 billion in
2010, it will rise to A$4 billion in 2012 and stay higher than
that for most of the decade, Bloomberg New Energy Finance said.  The projected investment is equal to the A$36 billion
needed to build Australia’s national broadband network, intended
to extend fiber-optic cable to 93 percent of the country’s homes,
it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
