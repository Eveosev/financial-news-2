Overseas investors sold a net 1.95
billion rupees ($43.9 million) of Indian stocks on April 29,
reducing their investments in equities this year to 45.2 billion
rupees, the nation’s market regulator said.  Foreigners purchased 32.4 billion rupees of shares and sold
34.3 billion rupees, the  Securities and Exchange Board of India 
said  today . They sold 4.41 billion rupees of bonds, paring their
debt purchases this year to 110.2 billion rupees.  Overseas funds returned in March, after withdrawing 94
billion rupees in January and February on concern accelerating
inflation will prompt further interest rate gains. They bought a
record 1.33 trillion rupees of shares in 2010, helping fuel a 17
percent rally in the Bombay Stock Exchange Sensitive Index, the
best performer among the world’s 10 biggest equity markets last
year. The Sensex has fallen about 7.4 percent this year.  The previous record was in 2009 when flows reached 834.2
billion rupees, sparking the biggest advance in 18 years. Funds
withdrew a record 530 billion rupees from stocks in 2008,
setting off the worst annual slump. Foreign funds have placed
4.516 trillion rupees in equities and 897 billion rupees in
bonds since they were allowed into the country in 1993.  The regulator provides data on shares bought and sold by
large investors, including trades in the primary and secondary
markets, with a delay of at least a day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
