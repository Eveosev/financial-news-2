Following is the text of U.S. online help wanted
advertising from the Conference Board.  Online Labor Demand Dips 123,800 in April, The Conference Board Reports  With gains in Q1, labor demand in April is in line with levels last seen four
years ago before the start of the recession  The number of advertised vacancies for architecture and engineering jobs now
exceeds the number of unemployed in this field  Note: Several updates to the HWOL historical series were implemented with this
release  Online advertised vacancies slipped by 123,800 in April to 4,322,300 according
to The Conference Board Help Wanted OnLine (HWOL) Data Series released today. The
April decline follows a strong gain of 763,100 in the first quarter of 2011.  “Labor demand has risen to levels we last saw just before the official start of
the recession four years ago,” said June Shelp, Vice President at The Conference
Board. “At the same time, the number of unemployed has doubled and now stands at
13.5 million (March unemployment data), and some professions have clearly fared
better than others in job opportunities. At this stage, there are occupations where
the supply/demand rate has fallen significantly and there are two or less unemployed
for every advertised vacancy. However, other occupations are still experiencing
relatively high supply/demand rates above 4.0, reflecting the fact that there are
over four unemployed for every advertised vacancy.”  REGIONAL AND STATE HIGHLIGHTS  The April dip in labor demand reflects declines in slightly less than half of
the States (23) which more than offset gains in the other 27 States  The trend in labor demand turned up in 2011 in all of the 20 largest states  Among the regions, the South declined 57,700 in April. In addition to Maryland
(-23,200),  Texas ,  Florida  and Georgia were down 9,300, 8,500, and 7,300,
respectively and Virginia was down 4,300. Partially offsetting these losses was a
gain in  North Carolina , up 3,500. In the first four months of 2011, labor demand in
North Carolina has risen 25 percent. Among the less populous States in the South,
Tennessee gained 800 and Oklahoma rose 1,200 to 46,100 online advertised vacancies
in April. Alabama was up by 500, while  South Carolina  lost 1,700.  In April, the Midwest held steady, with a slight dip of 700.  Indiana , one of
the smaller states in the region, posted the largest gain, up 3,400 to 70,300. Among
the larger states,  Wisconsin  rose 2,000 and  Missouri  was up 1,200. States posting
declines in April included  Illinois , down 3,300 to 165,800 and  Michigan , down 3,600.
Ohio rose by 900 and has gained 36,500 (29 percent) in labor demand thus far in 2011.
Among the States with smaller populations, Kansas increased by 1,400 and Iowa and
Nebraska added 900 and 600, respectively.  The West declined 47,400 this month with losses in some states offsetting gains
in others. California had the largest loss with a decline of 36,700; Arizona posted
the largest gain (up 1,500) in the region. Colorado and  Washington  declined 8,400
and 4,200, respectively, while Oregon was down 1,400 to 53,200. Utah declined by
1,600 but its overall increase this year is 6,200 (23 percent). Some of the less
populous States posting increases are New Mexico and Idaho which rose 700 and 1,000,
respectively.  The Northeast was down by 36,000 in April. In addition to  Massachusetts  (down
11,500),  Pennsylvania  declined 8,200 and New York fell by 7,100.  New Jersey  posted
the largest gain in the region with an increase of 3,900 to 144,100. Among the
smaller States in  New England ,  Connecticut  fell by 11,300 while  New Hampshire  and
Vermont were up by 1,600 and 800, respectively. Maine and Rhode Island remained
virtually unchanged with slight gains of 200 each.  The Supply/Demand rate for the U.S. in March (the latest month for which
unemployment numbers are available) stands at 3.05, indicating that there are just
over three unemployed workers for every online advertised vacancy. Nationally, there
are 9.1 million more unemployed workers than advertised vacancies. In March, there
were eight States where there were fewer than two unemployed for every advertised
vacancy including North Dakota and Nebraska (Supply/Demand rates of 1.08 and 1.44
respectively) as well as Alaska and  Maryland  (both at 1.60), New Hampshire (1.68),
South Dakota (1.75), Vermont (1.76) and Virginia (1.85) (Table 4). The State with
the highest Supply/Demand rate is Mississippi (7.30), where there are more than 7
unemployed workers for every online advertised vacancy. There are a number of States
in which there are over four unemployed for every advertised vacancy including
Kentucky (5.45), Alabama (4.45), California (4.26), South Carolina (4.20), Florida
(4.15), and Michigan (4.00).  It should be noted that the Supply/Demand rate only provides a measure of
relative tightness of the individual State labor markets and does not suggest that
the occupations of the unemployed directly align with the occupations of the
advertised vacancies (see Occupational Highlights section).  Supply/Demand for Selected Occupations  The recession and the current recovery have not treated all occupations equally.
How hard, or easy, it is to find job opportunities vary by occupation. Supply/demand
rates provide a measure of how many advertised vacancies there are relative to the
number of unemployed workers seeking employment in these occupations. In other words,
they are an indication of the relative tightness of the labor market for various
professions. Some high wage, high-tech occupations that faired best during the
recession (computer and mathematical science, and healthcare practitioners and
technical workers, for example) are still proving to have the most favorable
supply/demand rates.  “While the number of ads relative to the number of unemployed in all of the
major occupational categories deteriorated during the recession, for some relatively
high-wage, high-tech categories there were always more advertised vacancies than
unemployed looking for jobs,” said Shelp. For computer and math occupations, the
number of vacancies for unemployed job seekers deteriorated from around nine
openings to under two openings as the recession deepened. By last month (March’11)
the number of advertised openings was back up to five for every unemployed.  In contrast, in office and administrative work, and food preparation and
service, the number of unemployed continues to exceed than the number of vacancies.
In food prep and service, for example, there were almost eight unemployed for every
advertised vacancy in March’11. “That is a significant improvement from the worst
month (May’09) when there were 14 unemployed for every advertised vacancy,” said
Shelp, “but not a great comfort to those workers still seeking jobs in this field.”  Nationally, the supply/demand rate for all occupationsin March’11 was 3.05, or
three unemployed for every advertised opening. Job categories where there are
relatively good opportunities (i.e., not more than two unemployed for every
advertised vacancy) in addition to computer and math jobs, include occupations
typically called high-tech --life, physical, and social sciences (1.0), architecture
and engineering (0.8) -- as well as business and financial operations (1.4),
management (1.5), and healthcare practitioners and technical (0.37) and healthcare
support occupations (1.7).  Occupations where there continue to be a large number of unemployed for every
online advertised opening include construction and extraction (22 unemployed for
every opening), production jobs (7.9), building and grounds work (11.1), food
preparation and service related jobs (7.8), and personal care and service
occupations (7.4). “There has been significant improvement in these occupations
since the worst months of the recession, but we still have a long way to go to put
all of these workers back into jobs,” Shelp noted.  Changes for the Month of April  Among the top 10 occupation groups with the largest numbers of online
advertised vacancies, categories posting increases included transportation and
material moving, up 3,500 to 204,800 and installation, maintenance and repair, up
2,800. Construction and extraction jobs rose 1,200.  Occupation that posted fewer vacancies in April included healthcare
practitioners and technical occupations, down 28,600 to 568,500. This drop was led
by declines in advertised vacancies for speech-language pathologists, occupational
therapists, and physical therapists. At the same time, healthcare support
occupations fell by 11,400 to 129,100. Similar to the decline in healthcare
practitioners and technical positions, there were declines in openings for physical
therapist assistants and occupational therapist assistants.  In April, office and administrative support vacancies decreased by 14,000 to
459,800. General office clerks, receptionists and information clerks were among the
occupations which saw a decrease in advertised vacancies. In the first four months
of 2011, office support occupations have gained 59,800. In spite of this increase,
job opportunities still remain challenging in this occupational category with 3.45
unemployed workers for every advertised vacancy (March 2011 data, the latest
available for unemployment).  Food preparation and serving related positions slipped by 14,400 to 135,300
with a drop in demand for a variety of jobs including dishwashers, cooks for
institutions and cafeterias, and food preparation workers. There are still almost
eight unemployed workers (7.79) for every advertised vacancy (March data). The
overall gain in this occupational category since the end of last year has been
25,900 (24 percent).  In April, all of the 52 metropolitan areas for which data are reported
separately posted over-the-year increases in the number of online advertised
vacancies. Among the three metro areas with the largest numbers of advertised
vacancies, the New York metro area was 15.2 percent above its April 2010 level, the
 Los Angeles  metro area was 13.8 percent above last year’s level, and the Washington,
D.C. metro area was 5.2 percent above its April 2010 level.  The number of unemployed exceeded the number of advertised vacancies in all of
the 52 metro areas for which information is reported separately. Washington, DC
continues to have the most favorable Supply/Demand rate (1.17) with about one
advertised vacancy for every unemployed worker.  Oklahoma  City, Honolulu, Boston,
Baltimore and Minneapolis were metropolitan locations where there were just under
two unemployed looking for work for every advertised vacancy (Table C). On the other
hand, metro areas in which the respective number of unemployed is substantially
above the number of online advertised vacancies include Riverside, CA -- where there
are over nine unemployed people for every advertised vacancy (9.07) -- Sacramento
(5.73), Miami (4.96), and Los Angeles (4.42). Supply/Demand rate data are for March
2011, the latest month for which unemployment data for local areas are available.  PROGRAM NOTES  Note: The full HWOL time series from May 2005 forward is now available; the
initial release of the HWOL annual series revision in January 2011 had been limited
to time series data from January 2007 forward. The current April release also
includes updated seasonally adjusted data along with a correction for a processing
error affecting the November 2009 through January 2011 levels, but the trends for
this time period have remained essentially unchanged.  The Conference Board Help Wanted OnLine Data Series measures the number of new,
first-time online jobs and jobs reposted from the previous month on more than 1,200
major Internet job sites and smaller job sites that serve niche markets and smaller
geographic areas.  Like The Conference Board’s long-running Help Wanted Advertising Index of print
ads (which was published for over 55 years and discontinued in October 2008 but
continues to be available for research), the new online series is not a direct
measure of job vacancies. The level of ads in print and online can change for
reasons not related to overall job demand.  With the December 1, 2008 release, HWOL began providing seasonally adjusted
data for the U.S., the nine Census regions and the 50 States. Seasonally adjusted
data for occupations were provided beginning with the December 2009 release. This
data series, for which the earliest data are for May 2005, continues to publish not
seasonally adjusted data for 52 large metropolitan areas.  People using this data are urged to review the information on the database and
methodology available on The Conference Board website and contact us with questions
and comments. Background information and technical notes and discussion of revisions
to the series are available at:  http://www.conference -
