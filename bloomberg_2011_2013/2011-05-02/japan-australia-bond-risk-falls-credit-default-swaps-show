The cost of protecting bonds in  Japan 
and Australia from non-payment dropped, according to traders of
credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index declined 3 basis points to
120.5 basis points as of 9:37 a.m. in Tokyo, according to
Deutsche Bank AG prices.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index decreased 1 basis point
to 102 basis points as of 10:51 a.m. in Sydney, Westpac Banking
Corp. prices show. Markets in Asia outside Japan were closed for
a public holiday.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
credit quality. A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
