Israel ’s 10-year bond fell, pushing
the yield to the highest level in three weeks, as rising food
and energy prices spurred bets the central bank will step up the
pace of rate increases to curb inflation. The shekel gained.  The  Bank of Israel , which left its benchmark lending rate
at 3 percent on April 24, has increased rates by 2.5 percentage
points since August 2009, in an attempt to tame inflation that
accelerated to 4.3 percent in March.  Strauss Group Ltd. (STRS)  the
country’s biggest maker of coffee and confectioneries will lift
prices in the coming weeks to reflect higher costs, it said
today.  Gas prices  rose 3.1 percent May 1.  “Yields are in an upward direction as the rising cost of
raw materials, increase in food prices and expansion of economic
activity are fueling higher inflation expectations,”  Rafael Gozlan , chief economist at Leader Capital Markets Ltd. in Tel
Aviv, said by telephone. “The Bank of Israel will have to raise
interest rates at a faster pace than the market is pricing in to
contain inflation risk, which is giving further support for
shekel strength as the rate differential with the U.S. widens.”  The yield on the benchmark Mimshal Shiklit bond due January
2020 advanced 2 basis points to 5.35 percent at the 4:30 p.m.
close in Tel Aviv, the highest since April 11. The shekel rose
for a fourth day, strengthening 0.3 percent to 3.3771 against
the dollar as of 5:17 p.m.  Inflation Expectations  Inflation expectations, as derived from the  bond market ,
have increased since the last rate decision with the spread
between inflation-linked bonds due October 2014 and fixed-rate
notes of similar maturity widening 25 basis points to 338 points
today from 313 points on April 21. That implies expected
inflation of about 3.4 percent, up from 3.1 percent.  The Bank of Israel will raise its main lending rate by 25
basis points to 3.25 percent at the end of the month and to 4.25
percent by year end, Gozlan said. The  Federal Reserve  last week
left its benchmark interest rate in a range of zero to 0.25
percent and held its pledge since March 2009 to keep it
“exceptionally low” for an “extended period.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
