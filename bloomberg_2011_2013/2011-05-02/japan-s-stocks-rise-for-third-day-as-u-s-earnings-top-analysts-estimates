Japanese stocks rose for a third day
after U.S. companies reported better-than-expected earnings and
President Barack Obama said Osama bin Laden is dead.  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , the world’s largest carmaker, and  Sony
Corp. (6758) , Japan’s biggest electronics exporter, both advanced at
least 1.9 percent.  Komatsu Ltd. (6301) , the world’s No. 2 manufacturer
of construction equipment, jumped 3 percent after rival
 Caterpillar Inc. (CAT)  posted earnings that beat estimates. Oil
driller  Inpex Corp. (1605)  and other energy-related companies fell
after crude prices dropped by the most in two weeks.  “The death of bin Laden eases some concern, but it’s hard
to imagine it’ll lead to a reduction of risk in the Middle East,
and so the market’s reaction may be transitory,” said Koichiro Nishio, a market analyst in Tokyo at SMBC Nikko Securities Inc.
“The recovery of demand in the U.S. and other developed
countries means a better environment for earnings.”  The  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average rose 1.6 percent to 10,004.20
at the 3 p.m. end of trading Tokyo, its highest closing level
since March 11, when a record earthquake and tsunami struck the
nation. The broader Topix gained 1.6 percent to 865.55, with
about six times as many shares gaining as falling.  Obama confirmed the al-Qaeda leader was dead in an address
from the White House, almost 10 years after the Sept. 11 attacks
on  New York  and Washington that bin Laden orchestrated. Bin
Laden was killed in a U.S. military operation, along with other
members of his family, in a compound in Pakistan. He was 54.  In New York, futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
expiring in June climbed as much as 1 percent to 1,372.70 today.  Oil Prices Drop  Oil dropped the most in two weeks in New York after news
broke that bin Laden had been killed. Only the mining index,
which includes Inpex and  Japan Petroleum Exploration Co. (1662) ,
declined among the Topix’s 33 industry groups.  Inpex, Japan’s largest oil and gas explorer, slumped 2.6
percent to 600,000 yen and Japan Petroleum Exploration, the No.
2, slid 1.3 percent to 3,900 yen. Crude for June delivery
slipped as much as 1.6 percent to $112.11 a barrel in electronic
trading on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .  “In addition to U.S. companies having good earnings,
Japanese companies’ earnings were not so bad. That’s improving
investor sentiment,” said  Toshiyuki Kanayama , a market analyst
at Tokyo-based Monex Inc. “Excessive worries about the future
of the economy and companies’ earnings are receding.”  Better Earnings  Komatsu climbed 3 percent to 2,924 yen after Caterpillar,
the world’s largest maker of construction equipment, posted
first-quarter profit that topped analysts’ estimates and raised
its full-year earnings forecast, citing demand from developing
countries. Hitachi Construction Machinery Co. advanced 2.1
percent to 2,007 yen and  Kubota Corp. (6326) , a maker of farming
equipment, rose 1.4 percent to 781 yen.  Shares also rose after Japanese companies posted better
earnings.  Seiko Epson Corp. (6724)  jumped 5.7 percent to 1,492 yen
after forecasting net income will soar by 66 percent this fiscal
year, buoyed by demand from  China , India and other Asian
countries.  Ebara Corp. (6361)  surged 5.9 percent to 482 yen after reporting
full-year net income that more than doubled its own forecast.
Profit at the pump maker rose to 28.5 billion yen ($350 million)
in the 12 months ended March 31, according to a preliminary
earnings statement on April 28.  Panasonic Corp. (6752) , the world’s largest maker of plasma
televisions, increased 2.8 percent to 1,026 yen after it
announced plans to cut almost 17,000 jobs over two years as part
of an overhaul to restore profitability.  Sony, the maker of PlayStation game consoles that gets
about 70 percent of its revenue overseas, gained 2.5 percent to
2,316 yen. Toyota, which gets a similar percentage of sales
overseas, advanced 1.9 percent to 3,290 yen.  To contact the reporters on this story:
