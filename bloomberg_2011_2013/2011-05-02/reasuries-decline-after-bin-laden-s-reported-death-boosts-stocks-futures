 Treasuries fell, after completing the
biggest monthly advance since August, before reports that
economists said will show manufacturing maintained an expansion
and spending on construction rose.  Ten-year note yields also advanced as U.S. stock futures
climbed following a report from the New York Times, citing an
unidentified source, that Osama Bin Laden has died.  Ten-year yields rose two basis points to 3.31 percent as of
11:53 a.m. in  Tokyo , according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices,
after dropping 18 basis points to 3.29 percent last month. They
reached 3.28 percent on April 29, the least since March 23. The
3.625 percent note due in February 2021 fell to 102 21/32 from
102 25/32 last week. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
