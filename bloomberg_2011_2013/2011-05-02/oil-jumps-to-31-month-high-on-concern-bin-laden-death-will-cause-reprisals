Crude oil jumped to the highest price
since September 2008 amid concern that the death of al-Qaeda
leader Osama  bin Laden  will spur retaliatory attacks and disrupt
supplies.  Oil climbed as much as 0.8 percent after dropping the most
in almost three weeks in New York after President Barack Obama
said U.S. forces killed bin Laden in a firefight yesterday in
Pakistan. Stocks rose, pushing up the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index for a fifth day.  “The market realizes that with bin Laden out of the
picture, the risk of a reprisal is high, so you don’t want to
celebrate too soon,” said Phil Flynn, vice president of
research at PFGBest in  Chicago . “The stock market seems to be
rallying, which could boost demand.”  Oil for June delivery rose 63 cents, or 0.6 percent, to
$114.56 a barrel at 11:31 a.m. on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . Earlier, it touched $114.83, the highest level since
Sept. 22, 2008. The contract gained 6.8 percent last month and
has risen 33 percent in the past year.  Brent crude  for June settlement gained 25 cents to $126.14
a barrel on  London ’s ICE Futures Europe Exchange.  The  S&P 500  rose 0.4 percent to 1,369.63. The  Dow Jones
Industrial Average  gained 57.82 points, or 0.5 percent, to
12,868.36.  The dollar fell 0.5 percent to $1.4886 per euro, boosting
the appeal of commodities as an alternative investment. It
touched $1.4897, the lowest level since Dec. 7, 2009.  Risk Increase  Earlier, oil tumbled as much as 2.7 percent on the
announcement that bin Laden was dead almost 10 years after the
Sept. 11, 2001, attacks that he orchestrated.  “It is unlikely that the oil industry will see his death
as marking a seminal shift in oil-market security, and arguably
there has been an incremental increase in security risks in the
short term,” said  Lawrence Eagles , global head of commodities
research at JPMorgan Chase & Co. in  New York , in a client note.
Bin Laden’s death “is arguably less of a blow” to al-Qaeda
than protests in the Middle East and North Africa, he said.  Oil has climbed 33 percent in London and 25 percent in New
York this year as revolts that overthrew the governments in
Tunisia and Egypt raised concern that supplies from the Middle
East would be disrupted as protests spread. Fighting between
rebels and forces loyal to Libyan leader  Muammar Qaddafi  has
shut 1.3 million barrels a day of output in the country that was
Africa’s third-largest producer.  The Saudi-born bin Laden, who helped found al-Qaeda in 1988
after fighting Soviet troops in Afghanistan, was 54.  For the U.S. public, bin Laden was the face of terrorism.
He appeared in videotapes threatening strikes against the West,
including a message praising the Sept. 11 attacks  as “divine
blows” against America.  Oil Attacks  Al-Qaeda and bin Laden encouraged attacks on oil production
and distribution facilities as a way to damage the economies of
the U.S. and  Europe . In February 2006, Saudi Arabian security
guards foiled the group’s attack on the Abqaiq oil processing
center in Saudi Arabia, preventing disruption to exports from
the facility which handles two-thirds of the supply of the
world’s biggest producer.  “To the extent that bin Laden was a symbolic rallying
point for the wider forces of terrorism, there may in fact be
some increased risk of retaliation in the near future,” said
Ric Spooner, chief market analyst at  CMC Markets  in Sydney.  Helping to restrain prices were reports showing that U.S.
manufacturing cooled in April and a Chinese manufacturing index
declined more than forecast last month. The two countries are
the world’s largest energy consumers. Slowing economic growth
and manufacturing can cool fuel demand.  Manufacturing  The  Institute for Supply Management ’s manufacturing index
for the U.S. fell to 60.4 last month from 61.2 in March, the
Tempe, Arizona-based group said today. The April reading
exceeded the 59.5 median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey.  China ’s Purchasing Managers’ Index slipped to 52.9 from
53.4, the logistics federation and statistics bureau said
yesterday. That was below the median forecast of 53.9 in a
Bloomberg News survey of 20 economists.  Hedge funds  and other traders raised their bullish bets on
oil for a second week to the highest level in three weeks. Net-
long positions in oil increased by 11,202 futures and options
combined, or 3.9 percent, to 301,118, in the week ended April
26, according to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s
Commitments of Traders report. The level peaked at 311,632 in
the week ended March 8.  To contact the reporter on this story:
