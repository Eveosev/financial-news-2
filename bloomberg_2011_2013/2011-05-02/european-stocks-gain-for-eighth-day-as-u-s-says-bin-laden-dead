European stocks advanced for an eighht
day after President Barack Obama said al-Qaeda leader Osama  bin
Laden  was killed in Pakistan yesterday.  The benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 Index climbed 0.4 percent to
284.9 at 8:01 a.m. in  London . Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
futures advanced 0.7 percent and the MSCI Asia Pacific Index
gained 0.7 percent. U.K. and Irish equity markets are closed
today for a holiday.  “Investors see Bin Laden’s death as a very positive thing
for sentiment for now and as a reason to buy,” said Markus
Huber, head of German sales trading at ETX Capital in London.
“Everyone is very positive at the moment as there is so much
liquidity around.”  Bin Laden was killed by a team of U.S. operatives early
yesterday morning after a firefight at a house where he had been
hiding, Obama said. The President delivered the news to the
nation almost 10 years after the Sept. 11 attacks that bin Laden
orchestrated. Bin Laden was killed, along with other members of
his family in a compound in suburban Islamabad, an official
said. Almost 3,000 people were killed on Sept. 11, most at the
World Trade Center in  New York  and the Pentagon in Virginia just
outside of  Washington .  To contact the reporter on this story:
