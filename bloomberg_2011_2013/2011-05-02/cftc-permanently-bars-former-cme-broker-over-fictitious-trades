The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading
Commission permanently barred a former CME Group broker accused
of misappropriating fraudulent profits from hundreds of
fictitious, noncompetitive and unauthorized trades from October
2008 through February 2010.  The broker, Thorbjorn Haveman of Elmhurst,  Illinois , will
also pay a $140,000 fine, the CFTC said today in an e-mail
statement. CME Group, which terminated Havemanâ€™s registration in
April 2010, required him to pay more than $218,000 to three
other brokers who were harmed by his actions, the CFTC said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
