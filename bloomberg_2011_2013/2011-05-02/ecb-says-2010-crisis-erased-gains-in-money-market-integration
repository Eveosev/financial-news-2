The  European Central Bank  said that
last year’s sovereign debt crisis set back the return to normal
of the continent’s money markets after the worst recession since
World War II.  “The euro area money market departed again from a
satisfactory degree of integration, especially for instruments
with lower maturities,” the ECB said today in its annual
financial integration report. “For these, much of the
integration gains registered in 2009 have been erased.”  The Frankfurt-based central bank embarked on a program of
buying sovereign bonds in May 2010, as soaring bond yields amid
unsustainable debt loads forced first  Greece  and then Ireland to
apply for European aid. ECB President  Jean-Claude Trichet  has
said that these and other emergency measures are “temporary”
and will be removed as soon as conditions permit.  The ECB said that confidence in the banking sector has been
“strongly affected” by the sovereign debt crisis, and that
progress in restoring normal lending conditions present before
the financial crisis began “is still relatively slow.”  “While the measured integration of the euro area money
market has somewhat improved since the peak of the sovereign
debt crisis in the second quarter of 2010, this progress remains
fragile and the prospects are uncertain,” the report said.  The ECB said that conditions imposed by the European
Commission on ailing banks in return for state aid had caused
some institutions “to retrench within national borders,”
hurting financial integration.  At the same time, the ECB said that the “underlying trend
movement in  Europe  towards financial development and integration
has continued in spite of the financial crisis.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
