Textiles Fabricato Tejicondor SA (FABRI) ,
Colombia’s biggest textile maker, advanced to the highest in
almost four years on speculation the company will benefit from a
free-trade agreement with the U.S. and Venezuelan payments of
overdue debt.  Fabricato rose 3.2 percent to 45.4 pesos in Bogota trading
at 4 p.m. New York time, the highest closing price since
September 2007.  Venezuelan Ambassador Ivan Rincon Urdaneta said his country
has paid most of the $950 million in overdue debts to Colombian
exporters, according to an interview today in El Nuevo Siglo.
Fabricato’s Venezuelan subsidiary is owed $8.3 million, the
company said in an earnings report last week.  “Above all, it’s speculation about the free-trade
agreement with the U.S.,” Carlos Esteban Santiago, an analyst
at Alianza Valores SA in Medellin, said in telephone interview.
“But Fabricato is also very vulnerable to the Venezuela
payments, and those payments are being normalized.”  Colombia ’s government will increase the number of
investigators of crimes against union leaders and hold dialogues
with union officials, President  Juan Manuel Santos  said
yesterday. The Obama administration has said it wants Colombia
to offer better protections for union organizers before a trade
pact between the countries can be sent to Congress.  To contact the reporter on this story:
