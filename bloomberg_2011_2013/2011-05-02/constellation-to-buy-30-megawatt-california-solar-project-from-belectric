Constellation Energy Group Inc. (CEG) , owner
of Baltimoreâ€™s utility, agreed to buy a 30-megawatt solar plant
from closely held Belectric Inc. for an undisclosed price.  The plant will use about 381,000  First Solar Inc. (FSLR)  thin-film
panels mounted on the ground at various sites around  Sacramento ,
 California , and is expected to be completed by the end of the
year, Baltimore-based Constellation said today in a statement.  Constellation will own and operate the plant, and sell the
output to the Sacramento Municipal Utility District under a 20-
year power purchase agreement. Belectric is a solar developer
based in  Newark , California.  Constellation said April 28 that it had agreed to be
acquired by Exelon Corp.  To contact the reporter on this story:
