Anhanguera Educacional Participacoes
SA (AEDU3) ,  Brazil ’s largest education company by market value, gained
the most in three weeks in Sao Paulo after an acquisition
boosted its growth prospects.  The stock rose 3.7 percent to 36.30 reais at the 4:15 p.m.
New York time close, the most on a closing basis since April 12.  Anhanguera bought Guarulhos-based Faculdades Integradas
Torricelli for 39 million reais ($24.8 million), according to an
April 29 regulatory filing. The purchase “strengthens
Anhanguera’s position in this fast-growing market,” Alexandre Pizano, a Sao Paulo-based analyst at Bank of America Corp.,
wrote in a note to clients.  “The company has reached 35 percent of our acquisitions
estimate for the full year, showing that M&A is on track and
that assets valuation is under control and in line with
management guidance,” Natalia Lacava, an analyst at Credit
Suisse Group AG in  Sao Paulo , said in a separate note.  To contact the reporter on this story:
