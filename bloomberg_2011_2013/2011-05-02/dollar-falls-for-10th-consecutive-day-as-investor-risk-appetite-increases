The dollar touched the weakest level
in 16 months versus the euro after slower manufacturing growth
reinforced speculation the  Federal Reserve  will keep interest
rates low as the  European Central Bank  raises its benchmark.  IntercontinentalExchange Inc.’s Dollar Index earlier
dropped for a 10th straight day in its longest slump in 17
years. The euro gained before the ECB meets this week after the
Fed kept its rates on hold last week. The yen fell earlier
versus the greenback as the U.S. said al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden had been killed.  “It is inevitable that the dollar will weaken as the U.S.
runs a loose monetary policy relative to the rest of the
world,”  Mohamed A. El-Erian , chief executive officer of Pacific
Investment Management Co., said during an interview with Willow
Bay and Lisa Murphy on Bloomberg Television’s “Fast Forward.”
The  Newport Beach , California-based firm runs the world’s
biggest bond fund.  The dollar depreciated 0.2 percent to $1.4830 at 5 p.m. in
New York, from $1.4807 on April 29, after touching $1.4902, the
weakest level since Dec. 7, 2009. The euro gained 0.2 percent to
120.45 yen, from 120.22 yen.  Japan ’s currency was little changed
at 81.22 per dollar, after weakening earlier to 81.69 yen.  The euro pared gains as U.S. stocks reversed an advance.
The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 0.2 percent after rising
earlier as much as 0.5 percent.  Dollar Index  The Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against the
currencies of six trading partners including the yen and euro,
rose 0.1 percent to 73.028, from 72.933 on April 29. Earlier it
fell as much as 0.3 percent to 72.722 in the longest losing
stretch since the 11 days ended May 3, 1994.  The dollar extended losses against the euro after the
 Institute for Supply Management  said its factory index was at
60.4 for April, slipping from 61.2 the previous month.
Manufacturing expanded for a 21st straight month, the Tempe,
Arizona-based group said. Readings above 50 signal expansion.  “Even though we’re still seeing fairly stronger growth in
the U.S., it’s not as strong as it has been,” said  David Mann ,
regional head of research for the Americas at Standard Chartered
Plc in New York.  A widening difference in interest rates between the U.S.
and the rest of the world may mean no rebound this year for the
dollar, the world’s worst-performing major currency in the past
three months.  Outlook for Fed  The Fed is expected to hold its benchmark interest rate at
zero to 0.25 percent, where it’s been since December 2008, until
the first quarter of 2012, according to the weighted average
forecast in a Bloomberg survey.  While a weaker dollar may signal waning confidence in the
U.S., it also may help President  Barack Obama  reach his goal of
doubling exports by 2015 and reducing unemployment.  The yen snapped two days of gains versus the euro after
Obama said bin Laden was killed by a team of U.S. operatives
after a firefight at a house in  Pakistan . Bin Laden, the
architect of a radical Islamist movement, orchestrated the
terror attacks that killed almost 3,000 people in the U.S. on
Sept. 11, 2001, and recast global security and politics.  Brent crude oil for June settlement slid as much as 3.4
percent to $121.67 a barrel, the biggest intraday drop since
March 15, on speculation that bin Laden’s death may ease the
risk of Middle East supply disruptions.  The Dollar Index rose as much as 0.5 percent after the bin
Laden report. The gain came after the measure had its biggest
monthly decrease since September in April as a slowing U.S.
economy encouraged the Fed to maintain stimulus.  ‘Kneejerk’ Buying  “There was some initial kneejerk dollar buying with the
euphoria of it all,” said  Richard Franulovich , a senior
currency strategist at Westpac Banking Corp. in  New York . “The
basic story for the dollar is that it’s paralyzed by low
interest rates and bad fiscal health. Whether Osama Bin Laden is
dead or alive is not going to change that story at all.”  The Canadian dollar dropped 0.7 percent to 95.15 U.S.
cents, after touching 94.46 cents on April 29, the strongest
level since November 2007. Oil is  Canada ’s biggest export.  Canadians are voting today in a federal election. While
Prime Minister Stephen Harper’s governing Conservatives were
leading in recent polls, they may lack enough support to convert
their minority government into a majority of parliamentary
seats.  Sweden’s krona rose the most today against nine developed-
nation counterparts, according to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted
Currency Indexes. It added 0.5 percent, followed by the euro,
which rose 0.3 percent.  Krona Strengthens  The krona appreciated 0.2 percent to 8.9300 per euro and
strengthened 0.3 percent to 6.0228 against the dollar. An index
based on responses from around 200 manufacturers’ purchasing
managers was 59.8 for April, according to Stockholm-based
Swedbank AB, up from 58.6 in March.  The ECB, which meets May 5, raised its benchmark interest
rate to 1.25 percent on April 7 from a record-low 1 percent.
Some economists expect it to signal another move will come as
soon as June. Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said after a policy
meeting last week he was unsure when the U.S. central bank’s
monetary stimulus will unwind.  To contact the reporter on this story:
