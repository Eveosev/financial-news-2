A French woman filed a crimes-against-
humanity complaint in a Paris court against  Ivory Coast 
President  Alassane Ouattara , claiming his armed forces murdered
her father, Agence-France Presse reported, citing her lawyer.  Guenael Lupu, who lives near Paris, brought the suit today
saying the Republican Forces of  Ivory Coast , loyal to Ouattara,
killed her father, Jean-Gabriel Bouana, in the western town of
Duekoue, AFP said citing lawyer Jacques Verges. Verges also
advises  Laurent Gbagbo , the former Ivory Coast president who
sought to keep power after Ouattara won the presidential
elections last year, AFP said.  The UN put the death toll from post-election violence at
494 before the fight for Abidjan began. At least 800 more were
also killed in Duekoue, according to the International Committee
of the Red Cross.  To contact the reporter on this story:
