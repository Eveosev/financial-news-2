Silver futures plunged as much as 13
percent as CME Group Inc. raised the amount of cash that 
traders must deposit for speculative positions.  The metal for July delivery dropped to $42.2 an ounce
before trading at $44.225 an ounce at 10:09 a.m. in  Singapore .
The CME increased the so-called initial margin by 13 percent to
$14,513 per contract from $12,825, to take effect after the
Friday close. Margins were $4,250 a year ago.  Silver more than doubled in the past year as investors
sought precious metals to protect their wealth against a weaker
dollar and inflation. Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke 
signaled last week he will keep pumping record amounts of money
into the world’s largest economy and reiterated a pledge first
made two years ago to keep  interest rates  “exceptionally low.”  “We got massive sell orders in the  spot market ,”  Jonathan Barratt , managing director at Commodity Broking Services Pty,
said in a phone interview from Sydney today. “Those sorts of
moves may be an indicator of a key reversal, but it will often
take one or two weeks to unfold.”  Silver for immediate delivery slumped as much as 11 percent
to $42.6775 an ounce and traded at $44.2962. Gold for immediate
delivery gained as much as 0.9 percent to a record $1,577.57 an
ounce before reversing to drop 1.1 percent to $1,546.73.  Fewer Bullish Bets  Gold has increased 8.9 percent this year and is set for its
11th annual gain, while silver jumped 43 percent as investors
increased their holdings in exchange-traded products to a record
15,518 metric tons on April 26.  Hedge-fund managers and other large speculators cut their
net-long positions in New York silver futures by 26 percent in
the week ended April 26, according to U.S. Commodity Futures
Trading Commission data. Speculative long positions, or bets
prices will gain, outnumbered short positions by 24,995
contracts on the Comex division of the  New York Mercantile
Exchange , according to the CFTC.  Gold bought 34.8 ounces of silver today, 6.7 percent more
than the 32.64 ounces on Friday.  “The gold-silver ratio has come down to levels about 30
recently after silver’s run-up, which means silver had become
expensive in relative terms,” said Lee Joon, a senior trader at
Woori Futures Co. in  Seoul .  Silver has surged after investment demand jumped 40 percent
in 2010 as inflation gained, currencies lost value and  Europe ’s
debt crisis escalated, according to London-based researcher GFMS
Ltd. Industrial use gained 21 percent last year, it said.  “Profit-taking seems to be the most likely cause of
today’s sell-off,” said Park Jong Beom, a Seoul-based trader at
Tong Yang Futures Trading Co. “Silver has risen very fast, even
outpacing gains in gold.”  Palladium for immediate delivery fell 2.2 percent to
$776.25 an ounce while platinum declined 1.8 percent to
$1,838.75 an ounce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
