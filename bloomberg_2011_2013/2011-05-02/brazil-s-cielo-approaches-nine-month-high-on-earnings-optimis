Cielo SA (CIEL3) ,  Brazil ’s biggest card-
payment processor, rose to a nine-month high in Sao Paulo on
speculation earnings will improve as the industry prioritizes
margins over market share.  Cielo gained 2.3 percent to 12.40 reais at the 4:15 p.m.
New York time close, the highest price since July 15.  Redecard
SA (RDCD3) , its next largest rival, rose 2.3 percent to 23.28 reais.  Redecard, in its earnings statement last week, reported
collecting higher-than-expected fees, diminishing concern that
tighter competition will hurt profitability, said Daniel Malheiros, an analyst at Sao Paulo-based brokerage Spinelli
Corretora. Cielo is scheduled to report first-quarter results
May 4, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “I’m optimistic,” Malheiros said in a telephone
interview. “They’re not going to seek growth at any cost.”  Cielo had slipped 14 percent in the 12 months through April
29, while Redecard had lost 23 percent. The benchmark Bovespa
index declined 2.7 percent in that period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
