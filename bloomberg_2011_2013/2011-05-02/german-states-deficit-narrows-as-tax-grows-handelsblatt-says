The combined deficit of German states
declined in the first quarter compared with a year ago as
revenue expanded, the  Handelsblatt newspaper  reported.  The total spending gap to the end of March added up to 6.1
billion euros ($9 billion) compared with about 10 billion euros
in the first three months of 2010, the newspaper said in a
preview of an article to appear in tomorrow’s edition, citing
the federal  Finance Ministry .  Germany ’s 16 states, the federal government and the
municipalities make up the country’s overall deficit account. In
2009, a constitutional “debt brake” was enacted that requires
the country to run a cumulative balanced budget by 2015.  To contact the reporter on this story:
