Treasuries were little changed, after
completing the biggest monthly advance since August, before
reports that economists said will show manufacturing maintained
an expansion and spending on construction rose.  Ten-year note yields held at one basis point above the
lowest level in a month after Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis
President  James Bullard  told the Wall Street Journal that it’s
“reasonable” to expect the central bank will begin tightening
by the end of 2011. Demand for bonds was bolstered before the
Fed is scheduled to  purchase  $6 billion to $8 billion of debt
under its so-called quantitative easing program.  “We’re expecting a gradual turnaround,” said Skye Masters,
a rates strategist at Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc in Sydney.
“There’s been a lot of downgrading of growth numbers, and with
Treasuries where they are now that’s largely priced in, so you
have to get more weak data for the market to extend the rally
further.”  Ten-year yields were at 3.29 percent as of 11:15 a.m. in
 Tokyo , according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices, after dropping
18 basis points to 3.29 percent last month. They reached 3.28
percent on April 29, the least since March 23. The 3.625 percent
note due in February 2021 traded at 102 24/32 from 102 25/32
last week. Yields on two-year notes were at 0.61 percent. A
basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  A report from the  Institute for Supply Management  today may
show that the purchasers’ factory index fell to 59.5 last month
from 61.2 in March, according to the median estimate in a
Bloomberg News survey. Readings above 50 signal factory
expansion, and the measure in February rose to 61.4, the highest
level since May 2004.  U.S. Construction  Spending on construction may increase for the first time
since November, rising 0.4 percent in March, economists said
ahead of today’s report from the Commerce Department.
Expenditures on structures, both commercial and residential,
fell 1.4 percent in February.  “We’ve got to start taking some steps to start to tighten
monetary policy as we continue on through 2011 to make sure we
don’t allow inflation to get away from us,” Bullard said in an
interview with the Wall Street Journal that appeared on its Web
site on April 29. He added that rising prices and inflation
expectations are “making me a little bit nervous.”  Kansas City Fed President  Thomas Hoenig  is scheduled to
speak in  Washington  tomorrow.  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said last week the central
bank will finish buying $600 billion of debt in June, as planned,
while holding  interest rates  at almost zero, where they’ve been
since December 2008. Bernanke will address a conference in
 Chicago  on May 5.  The central bank plans today to buy debt maturing from May
2018 to February 2021 under the program.  To contact the reporter on this story:
