What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Corn futures are called to open 3 cents to 5 cents a bushel
lower on the  Chicago  Board of Trade on speculation that drier
weather this week in the U.S. Midwest will allow farmers to use
planting equipment in fields after rain and muddy conditions
caused two weeks of delays, said Greg Grow, the director of
agribusiness for Archer Financial Services Inc. in Chicago.  -- Soybean futures may open 3 cents to 5 cents a bushel lower in
Chicago on speculation that investors will slow purchases
because of increased market volatility and prospects for drier
weather in the Midwest, Grow said. Soybean-oil futures are
expected to open 0.2 cent to 0.3 cent a pound lower, and
soybean-meal futures may open down $1 to $2 for 2,000 pounds.  -- Wheat futures may open 2 cents to 4 cents a bushel higher on
the CBOT, the Kansas City Board of Trade and the  Minneapolis
Grain Exchange  on speculation that dry weather will damage
winter crops in the U.S. Great Plains and western  Europe , while
wet, cold conditions delay planting of spring varieties in
 Canada  and the northern U.S. Plains, Grow said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
