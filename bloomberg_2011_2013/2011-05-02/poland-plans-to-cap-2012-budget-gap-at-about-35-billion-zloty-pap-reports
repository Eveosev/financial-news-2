Poland’s government will cap next
year’s central government budget deficit at about 35 billion
zloty ($13.2 billion), PAP newswire reported today, citing a
government official it didn’t identify.  “The deficit in the 2012 budget bill will be at about 35
billion zloty, perhaps a little higher or a little lower,” PAP
quoted the official as saying. The cabinet will hold a working
session on the evening of May 4 to discuss the budget bill
before approving a preliminary version on May 5, the person
said, according to PAP.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
