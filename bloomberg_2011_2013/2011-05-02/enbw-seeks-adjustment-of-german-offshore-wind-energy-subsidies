EnBW Energie Baden-Wuerttemberg AG (EBK) ,
 Germany ’s third-largest utility, wants the government to adjust
subsidies for offshore wind energy generation to encourage
development of the technology.  “We should discuss whether the planned level of the
renewable energy tariffs is sufficient,” Hans-Peter Villis,
EnBW’s chief executive officer, said today in the northern
German town of Zingst. “I hope the aid system and its schedule
for offshore wind parks is adjusted as part of the new version
of the renewable energy law so that offshore wind remains
financeable.”  Villis, commenting in an e-mailed copy of a speech he
delivered at the start of a wind park off the German coast
today, said he would welcome shortening the periods over which
subsidies are paid out.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
