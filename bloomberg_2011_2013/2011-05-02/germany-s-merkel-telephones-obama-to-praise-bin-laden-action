German Chancellor  Angela Merkel 
telephoned U.S. President Barack Obama today to “praise” the
successful mission against al Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden, the
Berlin-based chancellery press office said.  Merkel and Obama affirmed their resolve to continue to work
together in combating terror, the press office said in an e-
mailed statement. Merkel, in comments elsewhere today, called
the death of bin Laden a success for the “forces of peace.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
