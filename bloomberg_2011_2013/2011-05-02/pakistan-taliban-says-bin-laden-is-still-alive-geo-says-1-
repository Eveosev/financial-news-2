Pakistan’s Taliban said al-Qaeda
leader Osama  bin Laden  is still alive and reports of his death
are baseless, Karachi-based GEO Television reported, citing a
statement from the group.  Bin Laden, founder of the terrorist network responsible for
the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center and the
Pentagon, was killed in Pakistan by U.S. forces early yesterday
at a house where he had been hiding, President  Barack Obama  said
in Washington. The strike came after years of “painstaking” work
by the American intelligence community, he said.  The U.S. determined that bin Laden was living in a home in
a compound in the town of Abbottabad, Obama said. The compound
had been under surveillance since at least last September,
according to administration officials who briefed reporters
after Obama spoke.  One of bin Laden’s sons was killed in the operation,
 Pakistan ’s Dunya television reported, without saying where it
obtained the information. Two of his wives and six of his
children were taken into custody by security forces, Dunya said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
