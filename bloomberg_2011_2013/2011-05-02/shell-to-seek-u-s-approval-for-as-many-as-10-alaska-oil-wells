Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) , which has been
blocked from developing leases it holds off Alaska’s Arctic
coast, this week will ask the U.S. to approve drilling as many
as 10 oil exploration wells by the end of 2013.  The Hague-based company will submit an Alaska Plan of
Exploration for 2012 through 2013 to the  Bureau of Ocean Energy
Management, Regulation and Enforcement , Kelly op de Weegh, a
spokeswoman for Shell, said today in an e-mail.  “After five years of not being permitted to drill in its
10-year lease blocks, we are now forced to plan on increased
activity each year,” she said.  Shell plans for as many as two wells a year in Camden Bay
in the  Beaufort Sea , and as many as three per year in the
 Chukchi Sea , she said. A delay in issuing an air permit last
year forced the company to postpone exploratory drilling in the
Beaufort Sea initially planned for 2011. Shell’s Beaufort Sea
leases expire in 2015.  The Beaufort Sea and Chukchi Sea are among “the most
unique places of the planet” and oil exploration might pose a
threat to polar bears and walruses, the  Natural Resources
Defense Council  said.  “The Arctic is ice pack for half the year,” Chuck Clusen,
director of National Parks and Alaska Projects at council, said
in an e-mail. “The ice pack could freeze over before a well
shut-in.”  The New York Times reported Shell’s plans for  Alaska 
yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
