U.S. stocks retreated, pulling the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index down from the highest level since
June 2008, as a slump in commodity producers overshadowed
optimism spurred by the death of  Osama bin Laden .  Energy shares had the biggest decline in the S&P 500 within
10 industries as crude  oil prices  fell.  Applied Materials Inc. (AMAT) 
slumped 3.4 percent after JPMorgan Chase & Co. cut its rating
for the world’s largest producer of chip-making equipment.
 Cephalon Inc. (CEPH)  climbed 4 percent after  Teva Pharmaceutical
Industries Ltd. (TEVA)  agreed to buy the company for $6.8 billion.
 International Coal Group Inc. (ICO)  soared 31 percent after  Arch Coal
Inc. (ACI)  agreed to purchase it for $3.4 billion.  The S&P 500 slipped 0.2 percent to 1,361.22 at 4 p.m. in
New York, erasing an earlier 0.5 percent advance. The  Dow Jones
Industrial Average  lost 3.18 points, or less than 0.1 percent,
to 12,807.36 after climbing as much as 65 points.  “Bin Laden’s death eliminates a specific terrorist threat
and, as such, serves to lower overall security risks over
time,” said Mohamed El-Erian, chief executive officer at
Newport Beach, California-based Pacific Investment Management
Co., the world’s biggest manager of bond funds. “In the
immediate, there could also be isolated disturbances in some
parts of the world. While all this could impact the economy and
markets, the big question is whether the American political
reaction, centered on unity and common purpose, can act as a
catalyst for meaningful progress on key economic and financial
policy challenges.”  Earnings Scorecard  The  S&P 500  rallied 8.2 percent in 2011 as higher-than-
estimated profit and economic reports bolstered investors’
confidence. Earnings-per-share beat estimates at more than
three-quarters of the 302 companies in the S&P 500 that reported
results since April 11, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The gains pushed the S&P 500’s valuation last week to about
15.5 times the reported operating earnings of its companies,
near the 2011 high of 15.8 reached in February. The S&P 500
Total Return Index, which measures the gauge’s performance
including reinvested dividends, rallied for an eighth straight
month in April to match its longest streak of gains since 1995.  “There’s a question of momentum,” said  Alan Gayle , senior
investment strategist at RidgeWorth Capital Management in
Richmond,  Virginia , which oversees $48 billion. “People are
asking -- how high can this market go? I personally don’t think
the market is overvalued. We’ll maybe see some consolidation at
these levels.”  Global Terrorist Network  Stocks started today’s session higher after  bin Laden , 54,
was killed by the U.S. military in a mansion outside Islamabad,
President  Barack Obama  said. Bin Laden used a family inheritance
to build the global terrorist network that killed almost 3,000
people in the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks targeting New York and
 Washington . The Saudi-born bin Laden helped found al-Qaeda in
1988 after fighting Soviet troops in Afghanistan.  He appeared in videotapes threatening strikes against the
West, including a message praising the Sept. 11 attacks as
“divine blows” against America. The attacks with hijacked
airliners prompted a national security initiative for commercial
aviation that altered  air travel . Al-Qaeda has dispersed in the
past decade. Still, bin Laden’s demise may hamper the
coordination of terrorist organizations and reduce recruitment
by his network and other groups.  The S&P 500 sank 12 percent in the first five trading
sessions following the destruction of the World Trade Center.
The  New York  Stock Exchange didn’t reopen until Sept. 17, 2001.  ‘Complex Situation’  “You have a very complex situation” in the Middle East,
said  Russ Koesterich , the San Francisco-based head of investment
strategy for scientific active equities at BlackRock Inc., which
oversees $3.65 trillion as the world’s largest asset manager.
“It’s also not clear that bin Laden’s death is going to change
the ongoing events” in that region. “We got a psychological
lift, but it doesn’t change anything.”  A report showed that U.S. manufacturing cooled in April to
a pace consistent with steady growth in the industry that’s
leading the expansion. The Institute for Supply Management’s
manufacturing index fell to 60.4 last month from 61.2 in March.
Figures greater than 50 signal expansion, and the April reading
exceeded the 59.5 median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey.  In  China , a manufacturing index fell after the government
raised  interest rates  and lenders’ reserve requirements and
allowed gains in the yuan to pick up pace. The Purchasing
Managers’ Index was at 52.9 in April from 53.4 in March, China’s
logistics federation and the statistics bureau said. That was
below a median forecast of 53.9 in a Bloomberg News survey of 20
economists.  Energy Shares Slump  Energy shares slumped 1.3 percent as a group, the biggest
decline in the S&P 500 among 10 industries.  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) 
lost 1.2 percent to $86.97. Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc.
decreased 1.2 percent to $54.34 to pace losses in mining
companies as gold retreated and silver plunged 5.2 percent, the
most since January, as exchange owner CME Group Inc. raised the
cash deposit required for trading.  Applied Materials fell 3.4 percent to $15.15 after the
shares were downgraded to “neutral” from “overweight” at
JPMorgan.  A gauge of health-care companies had the biggest gain in
the S&P 500 within 10 industries, rising 1 percent as a group.  Cephalon climbed 4 percent to $80.11. Israel-based Teva
will pay $81.50 a share in cash for the company, or a total
enterprise value of about $6.8 billion. Buying Cephalon would
help Teva offset the revenue it may lose as its top-selling
product, the multiple sclerosis drug Copaxone, faces competition
from generic versions and new branded products.  Takeover Speculation  Forest Laboratories Inc. (FRX)  rallied 4.8 percent, the biggest
gain in the S&P 500, to $34.74. Seeking Alpha contributor Bret
Jensen said the New York-based drugmaker and  Gilead Sciences
Inc. (GILD)  may be likely takeover targets. Gilead added 4.7 percent to
$40.67.  Frank Murdolo, vice president of  investor relations  for
Forest, and Amy Flood, a spokeswoman for Gilead, declined to
comment.  International Coal Group soared 31 percent to $14.43. Arch
Coal agreed to buy the coal miner for $14.60 a share in an all-
cash transaction to become the second-largest U.S. metallurgical
coal producer. Arch expects pro forma metallurgical sales to
reach 11 million tons in 2011 and 14 million tons over the next
three years from the combined operations.  About $823 billion in global deals have been announced so
far this year, a 25 percent increase from the $657.4 billion in
the same period in 2010, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
