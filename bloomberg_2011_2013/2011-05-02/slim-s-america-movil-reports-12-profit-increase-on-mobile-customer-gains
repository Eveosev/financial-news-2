America Movil  SAB, the largest
wireless carrier in the Americas, said first-quarter profit
climbed 12 percent as more customers signed up for mobile voice
and Internet plans.  Net income rose to 23.5 billion pesos ($2.04 billion) from
21 billion pesos a year earlier, Mexico City-based America Movil
said today in a statement. Sales rose 6.3 percent to 156.2
billion pesos.  Ebitda, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation
and amortization, was 62.1 billion pesos. Analysts had estimated
ebitda of 59 billion pesos and revenue of 146.1 billion pesos on
average, according to a Bloomberg survey.  America Movil, controlled by billionaire  Carlos Slim , is
offering free smartphones in  Mexico  and  Brazil , its two largest
markets, to encourage users to get online and spend more for
wireless data service. Total wireless subscribers reached 231
million with the addition of about 6 million in the quarter,
compared with the 4.4 million estimate of Gregorio Tomassi, an
analyst at Banco Santander SA in Mexico City.  America Movil fell 42 centavos, or 1.3 percent, to 32.57
pesos today in Mexico City trading, before the results were
posted. The shares have fallen 8.2 percent this year.  (The company plans to hold a conference call at 10 a.m. New
