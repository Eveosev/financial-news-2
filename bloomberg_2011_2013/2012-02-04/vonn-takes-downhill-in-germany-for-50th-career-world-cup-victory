Lindsey Vonn  of the U.S. captured
today’s women’s downhill skiing race in  Germany  for her 50th
career  World Cup  victory.  Vonn finished in 1 minute, 44.86 seconds in Garmisch-
Partenkirchen to beat Switzerland’s Nadja Kamer by 0.41 seconds.
Tina Weirather of Liechtenstein was third.  “I am at a loss for words,” Vonn, 27, said on the U.S.
Ski Team’s website. “Fifty World Cup wins is a huge mark for me
in my career and more than I even thought possible.”  Vonn is the third woman to win 50 World Cup races after
Austria’s Annemarie Moser-Proell (62) and Switzerland’s Vreni
Schneider (55). It was her 25th career downhill win, second to
Moser-Proell’s 36.  Among men’s skiers,  Sweden ’s Ingemar Stenmark won 86 World
Cup races, Austria’s Hermann Maier won 54 and Italy’s Alberto Tomba won 50.  “Every win is special, but 50 is a huge mark,” Vonn said.
“I feel like today will be a day when I look back at my career
and see what I have achieved.”  The victory moves her 482 points ahead of Slovenia’s Tina Maze, who finished 26th today, in the overall World Cup
standings. Vonn also leads Weirather by 230 points in the
 downhill  standings.  Canada’s Jan Hudec took the men’s downhill in Chamonix,
France, for his second World Cup victory.  Hudec finished in a time of 2:03.25, 0.53 seconds faster
than  Austria ’s Romed Baumann. Canada’s Erik Guay was a further
0.10 seconds back in third.  Switzerland’s Didier Cuche was seventh and saw his lead in
the downhill season standings trimmed to 36 points by Austrian
Klaus Kroell, who finished sixth. Kroell won yesterday’s
downhill, which replaced the race canceled in Val Gardena-
Groeden, Italy, in December, by 0.01 seconds over American Bode Miller.  To contact the reporter on this story:
