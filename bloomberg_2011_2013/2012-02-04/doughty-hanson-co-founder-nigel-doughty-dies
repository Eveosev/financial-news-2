Nigel Doughty, co-founder of private
equity firm  Doughty Hanson  & Co. and owner of English soccer
team Nottingham Forest, died today in his home at age 54.  “It is with enormous sadness that Nottingham Forest
announce the death of the club’s owner,” the team said on its
website today. Doughty was found dead in his gym at his home in
northeast  England , the team said.  Doughty founded  his private equity firm  with Richard Hanson
in 1995. They had worked together since 1985, when they started
a buyout unit at Standard Chartered Plc. Between 1987 and 2002,
they generated $1.94 billion of cash from investments that cost
$733 million.  Doughty had a net worth of about 130 million pounds ($205
million), according to the 2011 Sunday Times Rich List. Among
Doughty Hanson’s investments are luggage-maker Tumi, British
cinema operator Vue and Norit, a Texas-based maker of activated-
carbon purification systems, according to the firm’s website.  “On behalf of Dick Hanson, and all the management and
staff of Doughty Hanson, we are tremendously sorry to learn of
the death of Nigel Doughty,” London-based Doughty Hanson said
in an e-mailed statement today. “Our thoughts are very much
with his family at this time.”  Among causes he supported, Doughty was a donor to the U.K.
Labour party. In 2009, he contributed 1 million pounds ($1.6
million) to Labour, led at the time by then Prime Minister
 Gordon Brown , as it prepared for a general election it lost in
2010 to current Prime Minister  David Cameron .  Nottingham Forest  Doughty bought  Nottingham Forest  for 11 million pounds in
1999, saving it from bankruptcy, according to the U.K. Press
Association. He invested almost 100 million pounds of his own
money in the team, the Press Association said.  He stepped down as chairman on Oct. 13, 2011, the same day
as  Steve McClaren , a former manager of the English national
soccer team, quit as Nottingham Forest’s manager.  Nottingham Forest had a “very poor start” to the current
season, the team said in announcing Doughty’s resignation.
Doughty had been responsible for hiring McClaren.  The team currently stands 23rd in the 24 team Championship,
the second-tier league in English soccer. It had reached the
playoffs for promotion to the Premier League in the past two
seasons.  Doughty was born on June 10, 1957.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
