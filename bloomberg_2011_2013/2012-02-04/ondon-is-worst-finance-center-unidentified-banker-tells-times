The U.K. government is adding to
anti-business sentiment by pandering to public opinion, the
London-based  Times newspaper  said, citing unidentified banking
executives.  London is the world’s worst large financial center for
banking services, the Times reported, quoting an unnamed person
at a Wall Street-based bank. HSBC Holdings Plc and  Standard
Chartered Plc (STAN)  are concerned that the negative reaction to bonus
payments could extend to their executives, the newspaper
reported, without saying where it got the information.  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc  Chief Executive Officer
Stephen Hester waived his 963,000-pound ($1.5 million) bonus
earlier this week after the U.K.’s opposition Labour Party said
it would ask Parliament to vote on the award.  Investors in other financial centers such as Hong Kong are
confused by the coalition government’s handling of reactions to
remuneration packages, the Times said, citing another unnamed
person.  To contact the reporter on this story:
