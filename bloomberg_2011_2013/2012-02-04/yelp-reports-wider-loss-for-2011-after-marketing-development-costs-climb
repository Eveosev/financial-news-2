Yelp Inc. (YELP) , the user-generated review
site that’s planning an initial public offering, reported a
wider loss in 2011 after increasing spending to attract
reviewers and make the service easier to use.  Yelp had a $16.9 million loss last year, compared with a
loss of $9.74 million in 2010, according to a regulatory filing.
Marketing and product-development spending both increased more
than 50 percent.  The company filed to raise as much as $100 million in an
IPO last November, with plans to trade on the New York Stock
Exchange under the ticker YELP. Co-founded by former PayPal Inc.
executive Jeremy Stoppelman in 2004, San Francisco-based Yelp is
part of a resurgence in Internet offerings. Facebook Inc. filed
for an IPO this week, following stock-market debuts last year by
 Groupon Inc. (GRPN) , Zynga Inc. and LinkedIn Corp.  Yelp’s sales and marketing expenses increased 61 percent to
$54.5 million, while product development costs rose 77 percent
to $11.6 million, according to the filing. The loss attributable
to shareholders was $1.10 a share, compared with 71 cents a year
earlier.  The company’s revenue surged 74 percent to $83.3 million,
with local advertising accounting for the largest portion.
Unique visitors to the site increased 67 percent to 65.8 million
in 2011, while reviews rose 64 percent to 24.8 million. Yelp
lets users post reviews on everything from dentists to
restaurants to public parks.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is leading the IPO, with Citigroup
Inc. and Jefferies & Co. helping manage the deal. Allen & Co.
and Oppenheimer & Co. also are working on the offering. Yelp’s
venture backers include  Bessemer Venture Partners (PEF2883) , Elevation
Partners and Benchmark Capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
