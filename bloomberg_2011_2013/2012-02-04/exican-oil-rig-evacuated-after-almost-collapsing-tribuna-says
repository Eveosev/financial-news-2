An oil drilling rig in the  Gulf of
Mexico  was evacuated yesterday after a support leg failed,
causing it to almost collapse,  Tribuna  reported.  Workers stabilized the Ocean Yorktown rig, which was
performing drilling and maintenance work in the Abkatum Pol Chuc
production area, the newspaper reported on its website.  None of
the 95 people on the rig was injured, the newspaper reported.  A spokesman for  Petroleos Mexicanos , Mexico’s state oil
company, didn’t answer phone calls placed by Bloomberg News
seeing comment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
