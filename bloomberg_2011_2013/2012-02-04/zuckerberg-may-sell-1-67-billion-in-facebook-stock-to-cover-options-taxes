Mark Zuckerberg  may sell about $1.67
billion of Facebook Inc. stock in the company’s initial public
offering to pay off taxes he will owe when he exercises options
to buy 120 million shares.  The social network’s chief executive officer will owe taxes
on gains related to the award of options, the  Menlo Park ,
California-based company said this week in its IPO  prospectus .
The options were granted to Zuckerberg in 2005 and expire in
2015, and he’ll sell stock to cover liabilities, Facebook said.  “We expect that substantially all of the net proceeds Mr.
Zuckerberg will receive upon such sale will be used to satisfy
taxes that he will incur upon his exercise of an outstanding
stock option to purchase 120,000,000 shares” of common stock,
according to the filing.  Zuckerberg, 27, stands to become one of richest people in
the world with a stake in  Facebook  that could be worth as much
as $28.4 billion. His company, which filed on Feb. 1 to raise as
much as $5 billion in an IPO, is discussing a valuation of $75
billion to $100 billion, two people familiar with the matter
said last week.  At the high end of that range, assuming roughly 2.51
billion Facebook shares outstanding, each share may be worth
about $39.79. The awarded shares carry an exercise price of 6
cents. Assuming Zuckerberg buys all 120 million shares at that
price, his gains would total about $4.77 billion.  Zuckerberg’s tax rate will be 35 percent, said Victor Fleischer,  associate professor  of law at the  University of
Colorado . That means his bill would be about $1.67 billion.  Larry Yu, a spokesman for Facebook, declined to comment.  The social network had a valuation of at least $94 billion,
or about $40 a share, in an auction of its shares on the private
market earlier this week.  To contact the reporters on this story:
