Chile raised its forecast for average
copper prices in 2012 to $3.85 a pound because of higher demand
from  China ,  El Mercurio  reported.  Mining Minister Hernan de Solminihac, said the Chilean
governmentâ€™s copper commission, known as Cochilco, raised the
forecast from $3.50 a pound after prices rose in January, the
