Paccar Inc. (PCAR)  recalled certain 2012-
2013 model year Kenworth and Peterbilt trucks equipped with
Bendix brake components that may leak, a U.S. regulator said.  The 15,932 trucks affected were built between January 2011
and Jan. 19 of this year, the U.S. National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration said in a statement.  The agency said the trucks are equipped with Bendix ATR-6
antilock traction relay valves that may leak fluid in extremely
cold conditions and cause the brakes to engage, overheat and
possibly lead to a fire or loss of control of the truck.  Last month, Bendix Commercial Vehicle Systems LLC notified
NHTSA of the defect in a valve that helps with traction and
stability control. It may leak when temperatures drop below 0
degrees Fahrenheit (-18 degrees Celsius), the Elyria, Ohio-based
company said in a  statement .  Navistar International Corp., based in Lisle,  Illinois ,
said this week that it expects to post a loss for the quarter
ended Jan. 31, in part because of the brake issue. Navistar
sells trucks under the International brand name.  Volvo postponed deliveries of vehicles affected by the
Bendix defect as of Jan. 19, and was working on a “design
solution” to enable them to continue building trucks at a
Virginia plant, Reuters reported yesterday. Volvo sells vehicles
under the Volvo and Mack brand names in  North America .  Bendix Commercial is a unit of closely held Munich-based
Knorr-Bremse Group AG.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
