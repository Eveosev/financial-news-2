Fiat SpA (F)  should remain an Italian
company and keep its production in the country, Labor Minister
Elsa Fornero said in an interview with television network Sky

country, Fornero said that Italian firms should pay a “little
bit more, instead of less” for flexibility in the labor market.  To contact the reporter on this story:
