French President  Nicolas Sarkozy 
promised more and speedier compensation for people exposed to
radiation during atomic tests conducted in French Polynesia.  A larger number of victims will be recognized as eligible
for payments under a decree that will be published soon, Sarkozy
said in a statement on the Elyseeâ€™s  website .  A 2010 French law recognized for the first time a link
between exposure to nuclear tests and damage to health, opening
the door for compensation. About 150,000 civilians and soldiers
were exposed to radiation between 1960 and 1996 in  Algeria  and
on the Polynesian atolls of Mururoa and Fangataufa, the state
has said. About 10 million euros ($13 million) was set aside for
initial payments, former defense minister Herve Morin said in
2009.  The last French tests, all underground in the Pacific, were
conducted under President  Jacques Chirac  just after his election
in 1995 amid international protests. Chirac halted the tests in
January 1996.  To contact the reporter on this story:
