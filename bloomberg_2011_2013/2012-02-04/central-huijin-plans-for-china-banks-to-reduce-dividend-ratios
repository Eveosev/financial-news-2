Central Huijin Investment Ltd. (CEHOIZ) , the
state-backed shareholder in  China ’s biggest banks, said the
lenders will lower their dividend payouts to shore up capital.  Dividends will be cut by 5 percentage points to 35 percent
of 2011 profit at  Industrial & Commercial Bank of China (601398)  Ltd.,
 China Construction Bank Corp. (939)  and  Bank of China Ltd. (3988) , Central
Huijin said in a  statement  yesterday on its website. The ratio
for  Agricultural Bank of China Ltd. (601288)  will be unchanged at 35
percent, according to the statement.  ICBC, Construction Bank,  Bank of China  and AgriBank are
China’s four biggest lenders. Central Huijin is a unit of China
Investment Corp., which operates the nation’s sovereign wealth
fund that totaled $409.6 billion at the end of 2010.  The 21st Century Business Herald first reported the news on
Feb. 2. The reduction may add a combined 20 billion yuan ($3.17
billion) to the capital of ICBC and Construction Bank, according
to the newspaper.  Central Huijin, set up to hold the government’s stakes in
the lenders, owned 35.43 percent of ICBC and 67.6 percent of
Bank of China, according to statements from the two banks on Jan.
5. Central Huijin owns 44.22 percent of AgriBank, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg, and 57 percent of Construction Bank,
according to that lender’s third-quarter report.  --Zhang Shidong. Editors: Jake Lloyd-Smith,  Jim McDonald   To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
