Russia and  China  vetoed a United
Nations Security Council draft resolution that backed an Arab
League plan to “facilitate” a political transition in  Syria .  The UN’s decision-making body voted today in  New York  on a
proposal by Western and Arab countries to end the bloodshed in
Syria. Russia and China are among five countries in the 15-
member council to have veto powers.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
