Greek Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos said talks with international creditors had made
progress with two major issues still to be resolved.  Fiscal measures for this year and labor reforms are the two
main problems at the talks still underway with the so-called
troika, Venizelos told reporters in  Athens  today. He said talks
were at a very delicate stage and that everything needed to be
completed by tomorrow evening.  He said a discussion of the status of talks with his euro
area counterparts was “very difficult.” His comments were
televised live on Athens-based Mega TV.  To contact the reporter on this story:
