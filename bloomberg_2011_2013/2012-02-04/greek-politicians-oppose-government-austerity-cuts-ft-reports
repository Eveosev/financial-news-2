Greece ’s coalition government has
opposed proposals that seek to cut state-funded jobs and reduce
salaries, the Financial Times reported, without saying where it
got the information.  Representatives from the Pasok, New Democracy and Laos
parties won’t support the measures sought by the members of the
so-called troika: the European Commission, the  European Central
Bank  and the  International Monetary Fund , the FT said without
citation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
