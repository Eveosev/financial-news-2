Greeceâ€™s international creditors
insist the country cut its  minimum wage  as a condition of the
second financing package for it being discussed in Athens,  Mega
TV  reported, citing unidentified ministers who met with Finance
Minister Evangelos Venizelos earlier today.  Officials from the European Commission, European Central
Bank and  International Monetary Fund , the so-called troika,
demanded the minimum wage be cut to less than 600 euros ($790) a
month and that at least one holiday allowance, the so-called
13th and 14th wages, be abolished, Mega TV said. Pensions paid
by supplementary funds should be cut by 35 percent, the Athens-
based channel said.  Of 4.4 billion euros of measures needed to meet targets for
2011 and 2012, 1.5 billion euros will come from cuts in health-
care and defense spending, Mega said. None of the measures
should be from tax increases or new levies, it reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
