European Aeronautic, Defence & Space
Co.  will increase earnings and airplane deliveries in 2012, Die
Welt reported, citing an interview with Chief Financial Officer
Hans Peter Ring.  Ring confirmed the forecast of a 4 percent sales gain and
said earnings before interest and taxes excluding some items
will exceed 1.45 billion euros ($1.9 billion), the German
newspaper said. EADS needs to increase its profit margin to
reach the levels of U.S. competitors who have margins of more
than 10 percent, Die Welt cited Ring as saying.  Some European banks are struggling to raise enough in
dollars to finance aircraft purchases, the CFO told the
newspaper. Banks from China and  Japan  have stepped in so that
purchases have been secured for the coming months, Ring said,
according to Die Welt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
