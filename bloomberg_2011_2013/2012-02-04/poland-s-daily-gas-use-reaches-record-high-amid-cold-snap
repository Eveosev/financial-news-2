record yesterday as freezing weather boosted demand, Malgorzata Polkowska, a spokeswoman at Gaz-System SA, Poland’s state-owned
natural gas pipeline operator said in a text message.  The country used 72.3 million cubic meters of the fuel on
Feb. 3, up 2.8 percent from a day earlier, Polkowska said. The
previous record was 68.1 million cubic meters a day set in
January 2010, according to the economy ministry,  Temperatures in Warsaw were as low as minus 22 degrees

minus 18 degrees tomorrow and minus 14 degrees on Feb. 6,
