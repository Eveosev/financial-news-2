China ’s economy may be headed for a
“rough landing,” Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong
said.  “They’ve built a lot of infrastructure. They have built a
lot of capacity in many industries, autos, some of the
electronics industries,” Lee said, according to a transcript of
an interview airing today on CNN’s“ Fareed Zakaria GPS”
program. “There may be a rough landing, but they will get
through it.”  A Chinese government report on Feb. 1 showed that export
orders fell last month even as manufacturing expanded. The
stronger manufacturing boosted concern that that the world’s
second-largest economy will decelerate further as the government
refrains from loosening monetary policy to tame inflation and
curb property prices.  China’s economy  expanded 10.4 percent annually in the past
10 years, five times the pace of the U.S., as the government
boosted spending on roads and bridges and manufacturers exported
everything from toys to socks.  China’s economy grew at a 9.2 percent rate in 2011 while
expansion will slow to 8.5 percent this year, according to
economists’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Asked about China’s role in  Asia , Lee said “every
superpower or big country has to be looked on with a certain
careful respect by others not quite so huge.”  He said the U.S presence in the Pacific that followed World
War II is “still welcomed and is still considered benign. And
that’s really a good example for the Chinese to seek to
emulate.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
