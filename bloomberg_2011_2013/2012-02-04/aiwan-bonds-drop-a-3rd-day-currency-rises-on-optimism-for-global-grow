Taiwan’s  government bonds  dropped for
a third day and the local dollar strengthened after reports that
showed better-than-forecast growth in U.S. jobs, fueling
optimism the global economy is recovering.  The  Taiex (TWSE)  index of shares rallied 0.9 percent after
overseas investors bought $1.1 billion more Taiwanese stocks
than they sold in the last five days, taking net purchases for
the year to $2.1 billion, according to exchange data. The
243,000 increase in American payrolls was the most since April
and exceeded all forecasts in a Bloomberg News survey. The
unemployment rate of the world’s biggest economy dropped to 8.3
percent, the lowest since February 2009. The island’s financial
markets were open today to make up for an extended Lunar New
Year holiday last week.  “The U.S. job data was a huge boost to equities, and
encouraged risk-taking sentiments today,” said  James Wang , a
fixed-income trader at Yuanta Securities Co. in Taipei. “The
recent rallies in Taiwan stocks have put pressure on government
bonds to decline.”  The yield on the government’s 1.25 percent notes due
September 2021 rose to 1.283 percent from 1.279 percent
yesterday, prices from Gretai Securities Market show.  The  Taiwan dollar  strengthened 0.1 percent to NT$29.525
against its U.S. counterpart, according to Taipei Forex Inc. The
currency touched NT$29.415 earlier, the strongest level since
Sept. 13.  The  overnight money-market rate , which measures interbank
funding availability, slipped one basis point to 0.396 percent,
according to a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan Interbank
Money Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
