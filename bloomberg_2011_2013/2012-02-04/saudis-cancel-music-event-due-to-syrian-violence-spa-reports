Saudi Arabia  canceled the music
portion of a cultural festival because of violence in Syria, the
Saudi Press Agency said, citing a royal decree.  The decree cited the “bloodshed and terror happening
against innocent” people in Syria for canceling the
performance, the news agency said. The decree also referred to
events in Egypt, Libya, Tunisia and Yemen, according to SPA.  The Janadriyah culture and folklore festival is held each
year outside of  Riyadh . King Abdullah will inaugurate the
festival on Feb. 8, according to its  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
