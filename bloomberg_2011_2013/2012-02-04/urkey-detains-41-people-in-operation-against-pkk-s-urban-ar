Turkey  detained 41 people in
operations against an organization prosecutors say is the urban
arm of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, or PKK, which has been
fighting for autonomy in the southeast for three decades.  Authorities started raids at 5:30 a.m. in seven cities,
targeting illegal activities and public violence in Batman, the
southeastern province’s governorship said in a  statement  on its
website. The Batman offices of the pro-Kurdish Peace and
Democracy Party, or BDP, and Dicle news agency were searched
during today’s operation, according to state-run Anatolia news
agency.  Turkey detained thousands of journalists and politicians as
part of an investigation into the Union of Communities in
Kurdistan, or KCK. The government says KCK is the the urban arm
of the PKK, which is listed as a terrorist organization by
Turkey, the U.S. and the European Union. BDP lawmakers say the
probe is a crackdown on the Kurdish political movement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
