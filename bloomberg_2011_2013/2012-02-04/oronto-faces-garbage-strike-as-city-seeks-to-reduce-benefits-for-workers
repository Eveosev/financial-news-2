Toronto municipal workers are
threatening to strike as soon as tomorrow if they can’t reach an
agreement with the city on  job security , seniority and benefits.  A strike would affect garbage collection, snow plowing, and
some paramedic services, said Wynna Brown, a spokeswoman for the
city. Some city-run swimming pools and hockey arenas may also be
closed by a strike. Police, fire and emergency services would
run normally.  The city can legally lock out workers of the  Toronto Civic
Employees Local 416 , representing more than 6,000 people, or
about 16 percent of Toronto’s total public workforce of 37,000.  At the center of the dispute is the jobs-for-life provision
for municipal workers. The city is proposing to increase the
eligibility to workers with 22 years of service, rather than
those who have served 10 years, according to CTV News.  “The citizens of Toronto, they want the city of Toronto
and CUPE 416 to come up with an agreement,” said Paul Moist,
Canadian Union of Public Employees president, during a news
conference in Toronto broadcast by CP24 news channel today.
Moist has requested a meeting with Toronto Deputy Mayor Doug Holyday to help resolve the dispute, he said.  Toronto is  Canada ’s business capital and  North America ’s
third-largest financial-services center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
