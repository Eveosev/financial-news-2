U.S. Secretary of State  Hillary Clinton  renewed calls for the Syrian regime to end violence in
the country, referring to President Bashar al-Assad as a
“tyrant” and calling on the United Nations to act today.  “As a tyrant in Damascus brutalizes his own people,
America and Europe stand shoulder to shoulder,” Clinton said
today at the Munich Security Conference. “We are united,
alongside the  Arab League , in demanding an end to the bloodshed
and a democratic future for Syria.”  Clinton said she was “hopeful” that a 10 a.m. vote today
in the UN Security Council in New York “will express the will
of the international community.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
