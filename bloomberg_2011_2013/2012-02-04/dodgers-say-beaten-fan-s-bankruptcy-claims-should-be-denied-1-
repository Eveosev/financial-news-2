The  Los Angeles Dodgers  asked the
judge overseeing the team’s bankruptcy to dismiss injury claims
by a San Francisco Giants fan who was beaten in a Dodgers
parking lot after a home game in March.  The Dodgers and team owner  Frank McCourt  were sued in May
on behalf of the man who was beaten, Bryan Stow. The attack drew
widespread media coverage and was one reason Major League
Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig appointed a monitor to oversee
the team before McCourt put it in bankruptcy.  “The Stow claim is, when stripped to its core, based on
the faulty premise that a landowner is an insurer of the safety
of persons on its property,” the team said in its motion.
“That is not the law in  California .”  California law only protects people from “foreseeable
injury,” the Dodgers said.  Stow, from  Santa Cruz , California, was left in a medically
induced coma with a fractured skull after being attacked
following the home team’s 2-1 win over the Giants on March 31.  Christopher Aumais, a Los Angeles-based lawyer for Stow,
didn’t immediately return a phone seeking comment on the filing
by the Dodgers.  The bankruptcy case is In re Los Angeles Dodgers LLC,
11-12010, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, District of Delaware
(Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
