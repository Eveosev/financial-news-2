International Petroleum Investment
Co.,  Abu Dhabi ’s sovereign wealth fund that owns Spanish oil
company Cepsa, is available to supply the oil to the European
country if there is an embargo on Iran,  Expansion  reported
citing unidentified people familiar with the matter.  IPIC Managing Director Khadem Al Qubaisi made the offer
during a meeting this week with Spanish government officials,
according to Expansion. Iran supplies about 11 percent of
 Spain ’s oil, Expansion said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
