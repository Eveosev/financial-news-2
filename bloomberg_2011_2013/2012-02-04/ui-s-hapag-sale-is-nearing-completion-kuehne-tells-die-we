TUI AG (TUI1) ’S sale of a one-third stake in
Hapag-Lloyd AG is nearing completion, Die Welt reported, citing
an interview with German billionaire Klaus Michael Kuehne, a
member of the Albert Ballin investment group seeking to buy the
stake.  “The process isn’t yet totally complete, but the die has
been cast,” the newspaper quoted Kuehne as saying in an e-
mailed preview of an article to be published today.  Kuehne and Hamburg’s state government, also a member of the
investment group, want to take complete ownership of the
container-shipping line, the newspaper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
