U.S. sales of cars and light trucks
are expected to rise by about 10 percent this year to 13.9
million, reflecting improved consumer demand and more stable
credit availability, a dealer group said.  Paul Taylor , chief economist of the National  Automobile
Dealers Association (0052259D) , said better credit, improved incentives and
low  interest rates  are spurring vehicle sales, according to a
statement. He spoke at a press briefing during the NADA
Convention and Expo in  Las Vegas , reiterating a forecast the
group gave last month.  Automakers sold new cars and trucks in January at the
fastest pace since the 2009 “cash for clunkers” program
without resorting to profit-sapping discounts, signaling demand
returned to pre-recession levels.  “Recent sales are what we would expect from a normal
growing economy coming back from recession,” Taylor said in the
statement.  Taylor said one- to five-year-old used vehicles are in
short supply and selling at higher-than-usual prices. He said 5
million vehicles weren’t traded in during the recession, which
has bumped up the average age of cars and light trucks.  A rise in gasoline prices could be a factor that may affect
sales this year, the group also said. Analysts forecast the
prices may rise to $4.13 per gallon, up from an average of $3.51
last year.  NADA also said it expects used vehicle prices to gain 1.8
percent on a seasonally adjusted basis this year, peaking in
April and May. Used vehicle prices gained 3 percent in 2011,
NADA said.
