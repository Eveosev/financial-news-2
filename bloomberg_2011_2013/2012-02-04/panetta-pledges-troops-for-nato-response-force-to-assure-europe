Defense Secretary  Leon Panetta 
pledged to contribute a U.S.-based Army brigade to a quick-
reaction NATO force, as he sought to reassure European allies
amid cuts in American troops on the continent.  Panetta, speaking at the  Munich Security Conference  today,
announced the offer for the NATO Response Force as consolation
for a U.S. plan to withdraw two of four combat brigades from
 Europe  in a bid to save almost $500 billion over the next
decade. He also reconfirmed plans to rotate a task force of 300
to 1,000 troops to the continent for training and exercises.  The U.S. defense chief came to Munich from two days of
meetings in Brussels at the headquarters of the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization. In both cities, he aimed to reassure
European allies that the U.S. military shift to  Asia  won’t leave
Europe adrift.  “Our military footprint in Europe will remain larger than
in any other region in the world,” Panetta said in Munich
today. “That’s not only because the peace and prosperity of
Europe is critically important to the U.S., but because Europe
remains our security partner of choice.”  He cited the joint diplomacy and military operations
conducted for the Libya campaign last year, and the war in
Afghanistan. The planned slicing of two brigades from 43,000
American Army personnel in Europe will still leave 37,000
behind. The total number of U.S. military personnel on the
continent is about 80,000.  ‘Vote of Confidence’  “The steps Europe can expect from the United States amount
to a vote of confidence from  Washington  in the future of the
Alliance, especially in a period of fiscal austerity,” Panetta
said. “Let me now suggest the steps Europe must take in order
to cast a similar vote of confidence.”  He went on to renew his and his predecessor  Robert Gates ’s
appeal for European allies in NATO to refrain from injudicious
defense budget cuts.  He urged more pooling and sharing of resources within NATO,
touting the milestone this week that ended 19 years of debate in
the alliance with an agreement for all members to pay toward
operations and support for their first joint intelligence,
surveillance and reconnaissance system.  Panetta also pressed European nations to continue
supporting  Afghanistan ’s security forces after the 50-nation
U.S.-led coalition completes the transition of full security
responsibility to the Afghans at the end of 2014. Panetta said
this week he thinks the Afghans can take a lead role nationwide
by the end of 2013, with advising and combat backup from the
coalition.  Saudi Aid Sought  The U.S. is asking other nations in the coalition to
provide a combined total of $1 billion a year after that point,
and is prodding countries that don’t currently fight in
Afghanistan and would benefit from security there, such as  Saudi
Arabia , to contribute as well.  In the meantime, the coalition, known as the  International
Security Assistance Force , or ISAF, is looking for ways to
reduce the number of Afghan forces that might be needed in the
long-term from the 350,000-strong goal planned currently, to
save money.  “I know we face intense pressure to reduce that support
given the budget constraints all ISAF nations are facing,”
Panetta said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
