UniCredit SpA (UCG)  may cut the size of its
board to 15 members from 23 when it expires in April,  La Stampa 
reported, without saying where it obtained the information.  Chairman Dieter Rampl, who presented the plan to the Bank
of  Italy  earlier this week, aims to reduce the seats assigned to
the Italian bankâ€™s foundations, which include Fondazione CRT and
Cariverona, to three from nine, the newspaper said. One seat may
be assigned to Aabar Investments PJSC while Libyan investors
should keep the one they already have, La Stampa said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
