William Baer of  Arnold & Porter LLP 
is President Barack Obama’s intended nominee to lead the Justice
Department’s antitrust division, according to a statement from
the White House.  Baer, 61, whose firm championed  AT&T Inc. (T) ’s failed bid to
acquire  T-Mobile USA Inc. (DTE) , leads the antitrust group at Arnold &
Porter in Washington. Sharis Pozen, acting chief of the
division, said Jan. 23 she will leave her position on April 30.  Baer, named one of the “Decade’s Most Influential
Lawyers” by the National Law Journal in 2010, is a former
director of the Federal Trade Commission’s competition bureau
and has represented corporate clients including  General Electric
Co. (GE) ,  Intel Corp. (INTC)  and  Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO)  in private practice.  Arnold & Porter was lead outside counsel advising AT&T in
its proposed $39 billion buyout of Deutsche Telekom AG’s T-
Mobile USA unit. Baer’s colleagues Richard Rosen and Donna
Patterson handled the transaction, which the  Justice Department 
sued to block Aug. 31. AT&T abandoned the deal Dec. 19 after
meeting opposition from regulators.  Baer declined to comment on any nomination.  To contact the reporter on this story:
