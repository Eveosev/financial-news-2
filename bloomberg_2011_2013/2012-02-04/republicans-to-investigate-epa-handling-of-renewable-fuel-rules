The House Energy and Commerce
Committee said it will investigate the actions of the
Environmental Protection Agency in combating fraud in the
renewable-fuels program.  The EPA discovered that fuel credits, which can be traded,
are being fraudulently sold, the committee said in a statement.
The EPA’s handling of the fraud -- telling buyers of the credits
to replace the certificates -- has made the situation worse,
according to panel chairman  Fred Upton , a Michigan Republican.  “The renewable-fuels marketplace is in turmoil,” Upton
and Kentucky Republican Ed Whitfield said in a letter to the EPA
today which was released by the committee via e-mail. “The
costs of this turmoil ultimately will be borne by consumers.”  Congress  established  standards under the Energy Policy Act
of 2005 to encourage the blending of renewable fuels into the
motor vehicle fuel supply. The EPA sets levels for mandatory
purchases of certain renewable fuels.  To contact the reporter on this story:
