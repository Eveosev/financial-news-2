Italian Prime Minister  Mario Monti 
said the country “is now a safe place” when it comes to
withstanding contagion from the debt crisis within the euro
zone,  Sueddeutsche Zeitung   reported , citing an interview.  Reforms of the nation’s labor market as well as spurring
growth are the key tasks to tackle for his government, the
newspaper cited the prime minister as saying. The euro has
become much safer thanks to the fiscal-discipline treaty, he
said, according to Sueddeutsche.  To contact the reporter on this story:
