A Petroleos de Venezuela SA oil
pipeline at Monagas state’s Jusepin complex suffered an
explosion and leak, which reached a dam and forced the shut-down
of a water plant and power station, reducing the electricity
supply, the Monagas governor’s office said.  The “crude oil leak” reached the San Vicente dam and
forced the indefinite stoppage of the Bajo Guarapiche water
plant, the Monagas governor’s office said on its  Twitter 
account. The leak also forced the stoppage of the Jusepin power
station.  PDVSA, as the state oil company is known, earlier said it
controlled a “crack in a crude oil pipeline” at Jusepin that
occurred this morning. PDVSA, which said authorities had closed
a road in the area, didn’t give further details.  To contact the reporter on this story:
