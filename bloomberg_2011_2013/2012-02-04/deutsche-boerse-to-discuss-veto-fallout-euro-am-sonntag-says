Deutsche Boerse AG (DB1) ’s supervisory
board will discuss the role of management, including that of
Chief Executive Officer Reto Francioni, in the failed merger
with  NYSE Euronext (NYX) ,  Euro am Sonntag  reported.  The panel will review the issue at its Feb. 13 meeting and
discuss potential consequences, the newspaper said, citing an
interview with supervisory board member Johannes Witt, one of
the six labor representatives at the board. The panel also has
12 investor representatives, according to Euro am Sonntag.  Ruediger Assion, a spokesman for Deutsche Boerse, declined
to comment. Witt didn’t immediately respond to a call from
