The German government is looking at
three academics as potential replacements for Beatrice Weder di Mauro at the nation’s council of economic experts,  Bild-Zeitung 
reported.  The most likely candidate is Claudia Buch, an economics
professor at Tuebingen University, the newspaper said. Frankfurt
University’s Nicola Fuchs-Schuendeln and Munich’s Dalia Marin
are also on the list, according to Bild.  Di Mauro will no longer be available to serve at the
council after she joins  UBS AG (UBSN) ’s board of directors.  To contact the reporter on this story:
