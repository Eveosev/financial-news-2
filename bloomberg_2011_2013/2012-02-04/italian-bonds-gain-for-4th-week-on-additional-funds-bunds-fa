Italian 10-year bonds rose for a
fourth week, the longest run in two years, as optimism that
extra funds provided by the  European Central Bank  are helping
contain the debt crisis spurred demand for the region’s assets.  French bonds advanced for a second week, narrowing the
 extra yield  over similar-maturity German bunds to less than 100
basis points after borrowing costs fell at an auction on Feb. 2.
 Greece ’s bonds declined as the nation struggled to reach accords
with European officials and its creditors needed to win a second
rescue package. German  bunds  fell as signs global economic
growth is improving damped demand for safer assets.  “There’s been an improvement in risk appetite, clearly
supporting peripherals, and I expect that improved sentiment
will continue near term,” said  Nick Stamenkovic , a fixed-income
strategist at RIA Capital Markets Ltd. in Edinburgh. “The ECB-
induced improvement in liquidity definitely helps, and that has
encouraged some banks to use that funding to buy some peripheral
bonds. We had auctions in  France , which saw particularly good
demand.”  Italy’s  10-year yield  declined 20 basis points in the week
to 5.7 percent at 4:19 p.m. London time yesterday when it fell
5.54 percent, the lowest since Oct. 10. The 5 percent bond
maturing in March 2022 rose 1.43, or 14.30 euros per 1,000-euro
($1,311) face amount, to 95.285. Two-year yields fell 53 basis
points to 3.03 percent.  ECB Funds  Spanish and Italian bonds have rallied since the European
Central Bank provided unlimited three-year cash to the region’s
financial institutions in December to avoid a credit crunch.  Spain ’s 10-year yields have fallen about 1.8 percentage
points from a euro-era high in November amid speculation banks
are buying the securities to use as collateral with the ECB
under the program, known as the longer-term refinancing
operation. The central bank will offer another set of the loans
this month.  French borrowing costs fell at a sale of benchmark 10-year
debt on Feb. 2. The nation sold 5.698 billion euros of bonds at
an average yield of 3.13 percent, compared with 3.29 percent at
the previous auction of the maturity on Jan. 5.  The spread between French and German 10-year yields shrank
to as little as 94 basis points yesterday, dropping below 100
basis points for the first time since Dec. 6. French  10-year
bond yields  dropped 13 basis points this week to 2.91 percent.  Final Stretch  Greece’s two-year yields jumped 6.12 percentage points over
the week to 177.4 percent, pushing the price down to 22.28
percent of face value.  Greek Prime Minister  Lucas Papademos  said the country is in
the final stretch of negotiations for a second financing program
that will place the economy on a sounder footing.  Germany  is next week scheduled to sell 4 billion euros of
0.75 percent bonds maturing in 2017. Belgium also plans to
auction bonds, while France, the Netherlands and Greece will
sell bills.  Italian bonds have handed investors a gain of 8.1 percent
this year, according to indexes compiled by the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies and Bloomberg. German
bunds have returned 0.1 percent, French debt has risen 1.4
percent and Greece’s gained 0.8 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
