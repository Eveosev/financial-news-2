(Corrects RIA report to show Kruglov’s first name is
Andrey.)  OAO Gazprom (GAZP) , Russia’s gas export
monopoly, isn’t currently able to provide additional gas sought
by countries in western  Europe , RIA Novosti reported, citing
Deputy Chief Executive Officer Andrey Kruglov.  “Gazprom isn’t currently able to meet the additional gas
volumes requested by our partners in western Europe,” Kruglov
was cited as saying by the state-run news service.  The state-run company reduced deliveries to Europe by 10
percent for several days because of cold weather and is now
fully delivering contracted volumes, RIA reported, citing
Kruglov.  To contact the reporter on this story:
