Asian  stocks  rose for a seventh week,
with the regional benchmark matching its longest winning streak
since 2005, as improved manufacturing reports in the U.S.,  China ,
 India  and Europe overshadowed a stalemate over Greek debt
negotiations.  LG Electronics Inc. (066570) , the world’s No. 3 maker of mobile
phones that gets 30 percent of its revenue in North America,
gained 11 percent in Seoul.  Nomura Holdings Inc. (8604) ,  Japan ’s
biggest brokerage by market value, paced gains among financial
firms after reporting an unexpected quarterly profit increase.
Glencore International Plc, the world’s No. 1 listed commodity
supplier, rose 6.5 percent after entering merger talks with
Xstrata Plc.  “We got more confirmation that business confidence in the
U.S. and Europe is improving,” said  Mitsushige Akino , who
oversees about $600 million at Ichiyoshi Investment Management
Co. in Tokyo. “The European debt crisis is in a temporary lull,
so stocks sensitive to the economy will have a chance to gain.”  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  advanced 1.1 percent to 124.32,
matching a seven-week rally that ended Oct. 15, 2010, the
longest since its nine-week win through Dec. 23, 2005 according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. In January, the measure posted
its biggest monthly advance since September 2010 amid bets China
will ease lending curbs and the  U.S. economy  is improving.  Japan Production  Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average  declined 0.1 percent even
after the government reported Jan. 31 that the nation’s
industrial production in December rose the most in seven months.
 South Korea ’s Kospi Index added 0.4 percent, while  Australia ’s
S&P/ASX 200 Index lost 0.9 percent.  China’s Shanghai Composite Index climbed 0.5 percent after
the country’s manufacturing indexes gained in January,
withstanding falling exports driven by  Europe ’s debt crisis and
a government-led property slowdown.  Hong Kong ’s Hang Seng Index
added 1.3 percent.  Asian manufacturers gained this week after reports showed
manufacturing in the U.S. grew in January at the fastest pace in
seven months, while manufacturing contracted less than initially
estimated in the euro region. German output grew for the first
time since September.  LG Electronics jumped 11 percent to 90,700 won in Seoul.
 Quanta Computer Inc. (2382) , the world’s largest maker of notebook
computers, advanced 6.2 percent to NT$67.10 in Taipei. Foxconn
International Holdings Ltd., a contract maker of mobile phones,
climbed 2.5 percent in Hong Kong.  Carmakers Rise  Carmakers rallied after a report from Autodata Corp. showed
sales of cars and light trucks in the U.S. climbed 11 percent in
January from a year earlier as consumers replaced aging vehicles.
Separately, Daiwa Securities Group Inc. predicted a “double-
digit” gain in the China’s vehicle sales.  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , the world’s No. 1 carmaker by market
value, increased 2.2 percent to 2,899 yen in Tokyo.  Geely
Automobile Holdings Ltd. (175) , whose Chinese parent owns Swedish
automaker Volvo AB, added 3 percent to HK$2.41. BYD Co., the
Chinese carmaker partly owned by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire
Hathaway Inc., climbed 3.8 percent to HK$24.65.  Nomura Holdings jumped 9.6 percent to 298 yen after saying
on Feb. 1 that its net income climbed 33 percent to 17.8 billion
yen ($234 million) for the three months ended Dec. 31 from a
year earlier, citing cost cuts and the sale of private-equity
investments. The average estimate of seven analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg was for a 2 billion yen loss.  ‘Good Position’  Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc. (8316) , Japan’s second-
biggest lender by market value, rose 3.9 percent to 2,477 yen
after saying Jan. 30 it maintained its full-year earnings
forecast of 500 billion yen and said it will buy back as much as
80 billion yen of stock.  “The bank is in a relatively good position now where it
can selectively offer loans to companies and projects outside of
Japan to improve lending profitability,” said Yoshinobu Yamada,
a Tokyo-based analyst at Deutsche Bank AG.  Glencore, whose shares rose 6.5 percent to HK$55.65 in Hong
Kong, is in talks with Xstrata Plc to merge in a deal that would
create an $82 billion rival to BHP Billiton Ltd. Glencore, which
already holds 34 percent of the Zug, Switzerland-based mining
company, made an approach regarding an all-share “merger of
equals,” Xstrata said Feb. 3. Glencore said there’s no
certainty of an offer.  Gains in stocks were limited as  Greece  and its creditors
have yet to come to an agreement about a week since discussions
with bondholders started.  A Greek debt deal could be reached “in the coming weeks,
maybe days,” said Josef Ackermann, chairman of the Institute of
International Finance. Ackermann, also chief executive officer
of Deutsche Bank AG, may travel to  Athens  this weekend for talks
over a swap involving Greek debt with a face value of 200
billion euros.  ‘Biggest Headwind’  “There’s still a lot of headwinds out there in terms of
global growth, particularly in Europe,” said Belinda Allen, a
senior investment analyst at Colonial First State Global Asset
Management in Sydney, which oversees about $145 billion. “The
biggest headwind is the implementation risk surrounding the
fiscal compact in Europe and negotiations on a Greek debt
deal.”  Singapore Airlines Ltd., the world’s No. 2 carrier by
market value, slid 4.4 percent to S$10.61. Net income fell 53
percent to S$135 million ($108 million) in the quarter ended
December, from S$288 million a year earlier, the airline said in
a statement on Feb. 2. The drop was due to rising fuel costs,
greater competition and waning demand for premium travel,
according to the airline.  More than half of the 254 companies on the Asia-Pacific
index that reported earnings from Jan. 9 through 6 p.m. in  Tokyo 
on Feb. 3 missed estimates, according to  data  compiled by
Bloomberg News.  To contact the reporter on this story:
