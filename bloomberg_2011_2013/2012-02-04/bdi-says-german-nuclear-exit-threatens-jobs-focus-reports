Hans-Peter Keitel, head of the BDI
federation of German industry, warned that the decision to drop
nuclear power threatens thousands of jobs because of rising
energy costs, Focus  reported , citing an interview.  German energy costs are among the highest in  Europe , the
magazine cited Keitel as saying in preview of an article for its
next edition.  ThyssenKrupp AG (TKA)  pays 80 euros ($105) per megawatt
hour at its Krefeld, Germany plant while spending 60 euros at
its Italian unit and 40 euros in the U.S. for the same amount,
Keitel said, according to Focus.  To contact the reporter on this story:
