Paul Pierce  scored 30 points for the
 Boston Celtics  who battled back from a 12-point second-half
deficit to beat the New York Knicks 91-89 in a National
Basketball Association contest.  Kevin Garnett added 15 points and  Ray Allen  scored 14 for
the Celtics (12-10), who were down 55-49 at halftime last night
at TD Garden in Boston.  Allen hit a 25-foot 3-pointer followed by a technical free
throw to break a tie and give the Celtics an 83-79 lead with
four minutes 24 seconds left in the game. Boston stayed atop the
Knicks who narrowed the gap to one at 90-89 on Landry Fields’s
layup three minutes later. Pierce added a free throw to seal to
the victory with five seconds remaining.  Carmelo Anthony  scored 26 points for the Knicks (8-15),
Tyson Chandler had 20 points and 11 rebounds and Fields had 11.  The Celtics hit 10 of 20 3-point attempts, while the Knicks
connected on three of 15.  Boston is second, 3 1/2 games behind the Philadelphia 76ers
in the Eastern Conference’s five-team Atlantic Division. The
Knicks are third, eight games back from the leader.  To contact the reporter on this story:
