A Saudi woman has filed a lawsuit
against the General Directorate of Traffic for refusing to grant
her a driver’s license, according an e-mail from the Women 2
Drive campaign.  Manal al-Sharif, who is behind the initiative in the only
country in the world that bans women from driving, said by phone
today she filed the suit on Nov. 15 at the Grievances Board in
the Eastern province.  The board allows citizens to object to government decisions
judicially by filling lawsuits against state institutions.  Al-Sharif’s move stems from a “belief that positive change
is enforced through legitimate channels and via our national
judicial institutions and also in accordance with laws and
regulations,” according to the statement. She applied for the
license last May.  To contact the reporter on this story:
