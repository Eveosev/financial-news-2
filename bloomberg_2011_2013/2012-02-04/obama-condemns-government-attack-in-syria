President  Barack Obama  condemned the
attacks by Syrian government forces on civilians in Homs that
“murdered hundreds of Syrian citizens, including women and
children,” the U.S. leader said in a statement.  “Thirty years after his father massacred tens of thousands
of innocent Syrian men, women, and children in Hama, Bashar al-
Assad has demonstrated a similar disdain for human life and
dignity,” Obama said in a statement. “Assad must halt his
campaign of killing and crimes against his own people now. He
must step aside and allow a democratic transition to proceed
immediately.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
