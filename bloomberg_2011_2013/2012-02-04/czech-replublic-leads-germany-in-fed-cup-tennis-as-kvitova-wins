Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova
helped  Czech Republic  take a 2-0 lead over Germany in the first
round of tennis’s Fed Cup.  Kvitova defeated Julia Goerges 3-6, 6-3, 10-8 in Stuttgart,
Germany, to leave the defending champion Czechs needing one win
from tomorrow’s three matches to advance to the semifinals of
women’s tennis’s top team competition.  Maria Sharapova and  Svetlana Kuznetsova  both won in
straight sets to give Russia 2-0 lead over Spain in Moscow.
Yanina Wickmayer won her match to leave host Belgium tied 1-1
with Serbia, while Lesia Tsurenko’s win over Francesca Schiavone
left visiting Ukrain tied 1-1 with Italy.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
