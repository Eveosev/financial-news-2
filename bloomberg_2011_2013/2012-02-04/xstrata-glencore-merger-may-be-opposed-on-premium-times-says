An  Xstrata Plc (XTA)  shareholder may block
a merger with  Glencore International Plc (GLEN)  if the Swiss
commodities trader doesn’t offer a “substantial” premium to
take control,  The Times  reported.  Xstrata’s growth prospects in the next 10 years are higher
than Glencore’s, the newspaper said, citing Richard Buxton, head
of U.K. equities at  Schroders Plc. (SDR)   To contact the reporter on this story:
