London’s Heathrow,  Europe ’s busiest
airport, is cutting flights tomorrow because of “adverse
weather conditions,” according to International Consolidated
Airlines Group SA’s British Airways unit.  “BAA, Heathrow airlines, and air traffic control have
agreed to introduce a reduced flight schedule,” BA said today
on its  website . BAA Ltd. is the airport operator.  Severe weather warnings have been issued for London and the
southeast, according to the  Met Office , the U.K.’s national
weather service. As much as 10 centimeters (4 inches) of snow is
expected to fall in some parts, it said in a notice on its
 website .  Gatwick, the U.K.’s second-biggest airport, is currently
operating normally ahead of expected heavy snow later today, it
said in an e-mailed statement.  The latest weather forecasts show snow expected to start
falling at the airport later today, “with intense snowfall
starting at around midnight and lasting into the early hours of
Sunday morning,” according to Gatwick’s statement.  Passengers should be prepared to expect some disruption,
delays and potentially some cancellations to their flights, it
said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
