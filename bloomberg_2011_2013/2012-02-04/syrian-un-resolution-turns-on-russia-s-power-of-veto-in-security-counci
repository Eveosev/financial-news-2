Russia  and  China  vetoed a United
Nations Security Council resolution that backed an Arab League
plan to “facilitate” a political transition in  Syria .  Thirteen of the council’s 15 members voted in favor today
of a proposal by Western and Arab countries to end the bloodshed
in Syria. Russia and China, two of the five permanent council
members with veto power, blocked its passage.  Almost a year after the uprising against Syrian President
Bashar al-Assad began, Russia has now blocked two attempts to
take action against its top Mideast ally. The vote came a day
after reports that Assad’s security forces in the city of Homs
killed at least 200 people in one of the bloodiest days of
protest in the 11-month uprising.  U.S. Ambassador Susan Rice said she was “disgusted” by
the vetoes that “prop up desperate dictators,” and French
Ambassador  Gerard Araud  said “history will judge harshly”
those who protected the Assad regime.  “To block this resolution is to bear the responsibility
for the horrors on the ground in Syria,” U.S. Secretary of
State  Hillary Clinton  said in Munich today after meeting with
her Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov.  The UN says Assad’s regime has killed more than 5,400
people and that the uprising is evolving into a civil war.  Russia and China blocked a Security Council resolution in
October, when Western powers sought to hold the Syrian president
responsible for violence. Russia’s only military base outside
the former  Soviet Union  is in Syria, and it sells weapons to
Assad’s government.  Homs Deaths  Philippe Bolopion, UN director at  Human Rights Watch  in  New
York , said the vetoes by Moscow and Beijing four months ago were
“irresponsible”, but today “after weeks of Russian diplomatic
game-playing and in the middle of a bloodbath in Homs, they are
simply incendiary.”  “For Russia and China to double veto after the regime’s
brutal assault on Homs last eve, after the West diluted the
resolution language to suit Russia’s demands, effectively means
they were helping Assad play for time and ensure his rule,”
said Andrew J. Tabler, a fellow at the Washington Institute for
Near East Policy and an expert on Syria.  In a final effort to win Russian acceptance, Arab and
European Union negotiators made concessions in response to
objections that the proposal endorsed regime change.  The draft that was voted on by the council said there
should be no “prejudging the outcome” of the political process
and that “nothing in this resolution authorizes” military
action, responding to Russian concern that last March’s UN
authorization of all necessary measures to protect civilians was
used to bring down Muammar Qaddafi’s regime.  Arab and EU diplomats refused to barter on the degree of
support to give for the Arab League plan, a sticking point in
week-long negotiations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
