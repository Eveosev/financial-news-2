Peter Altmaier , the chief whip for
Chancellor Angela Merkel’s Christian Democrats, opposes a
 Marshall Plan  for Greece,  Tagesspiegel  reported, citing an
interview.  The idea of buying growth with government money was adopted
in the 2008 financial crises and accelerated the outbreak of the
debt crisis, the newspaper cited him saying in a preview of an
article for tomorrow’s edition. Such a stimulus plan isn’t
possible now because there is no money left to spend, Altmaier
said, according to Tagesspiegel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
