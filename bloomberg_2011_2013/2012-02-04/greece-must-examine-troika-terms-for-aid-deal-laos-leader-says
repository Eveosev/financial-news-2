Greece  must carefully examine the
terms being demanded by international creditors for a second
financing package before agreeing to it, said George Karatzaferis, leader of the Laos party.  “I won’t accept ultimatums, of ‘you accept it, or you
don’t get the money,’” Karatzaferis said in Thessaloniki today,
according to an e-mailed transcript of his speech. “I will
examine every detail and footnote. If we don’t agree with
something and the Troika insists, we won’t take the package.”  Karatzaferis, whose party is one of three backing Prime
Minister Lucas Papademos’s interim government, said a meeting of
political party leaders scheduled for Sunday, Feb. 5, isn’t just
about deciding on a debt swap or a 130 billion-euro ($171
billion) financing package. “That’s a shallow reading,” he
said.  Officials from the European Commission,  European Central
Bank  and  International Monetary Fund  make up the so-called
Troika.  To contact the reporter on this story:
