A winter storm battered much of
 Italy , bringing arctic temperatures to the north and snow as far
south as Naples, disrupting transport and commerce across the
country.  Rome got between six and eight inches of snow, the most in
more than a quarter century, downing trees, snarling traffic and
leaving shops shuttered. Some vehicles were trapped for 10 hours
on the ring road that surrounds the capital and trucks were
forced to pull off highways in much of the center and north of
the country, SKYTG24 reported.  Temperatures at Malpensa Airport outside Milan dropped to
minus 18 Celsius (0.4 degree Fahrenheit). The average low for
February is 2 Celsius with a high of 8 degrees, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  “Grab a shovel and let’s liberate the city together,”
Rome’s Mayor Gianni Alemanno said. Civil protection authorities
distributed 2,000 shovels in piazzas in the city center to
Romans willing to help with the cleanup.  Alemanno had ordered schools closed yesterday in
anticipation of the snow, which began falling heavily by midday
and continued through the night.  The storm also brought some rail lines to a halt with one
train trapped with more than 100 passengers on board near the
town of Carsoli, SKYTG24 reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
