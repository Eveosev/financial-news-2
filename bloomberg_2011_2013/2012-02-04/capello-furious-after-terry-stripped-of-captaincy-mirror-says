England manager  Fabio Capello  is
furious with the Football Association’s decision to strip  John Terry  of the national team captaincy, the Daily Mirror said.  The F.A. yesterday dropped Terry from the role until
allegations of racial abuse against him are resolved.  Capello fought for the Chelsea defender to remain as
captain and only accepted the F.A.’s decision with extreme
reluctance, the Mirror said. He even reviewed his contract to
see if he had the right to veto the move, the newspaper said.  Terry stands trial July 9 on a charge of racially abusing
QPR defender Anton Ferdinand in an October match. He has denied
the allegation and his lawyers pleaded not guilty on his behalf
three days ago in London criminal court.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
