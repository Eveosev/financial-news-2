A United Nations Security Council
resolution condemning violence in  Syria  may still have a chance,
said Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, who will discuss
the issue later today with U.S. Secretary of State  Hillary Clinton .  “We are not saying this resolution is hopeless,” Lavrov
said today at a conference in Munich. The resolution has to be
changed in order to address violence of armed groups and remove
ambiguities concerning a timeline for peace.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
