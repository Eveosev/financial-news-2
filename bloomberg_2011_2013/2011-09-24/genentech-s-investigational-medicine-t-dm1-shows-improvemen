Genentech Inc. said its Phase II
study TDM4450g in people with previously untreated HER2-positive
metastatic breast cancer compared trastuzumab emtansine to
standard treatment with Herceptin® plus docetaxel chemotherapy.
The results showed people who received trastuzumab emtansine had
a 41 percent reduction in the risk of their disease worsening or
death and lived a median of five months longer without their
disease worsening.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
