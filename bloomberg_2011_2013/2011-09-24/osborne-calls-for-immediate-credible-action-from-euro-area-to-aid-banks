U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer
 George Osborne  called for immediate, “credible” action from
euro area countries to support their banks and indebted nations,
saying policy makers are facing a “loss of confidence” in
financial markets.  “Credible political commitments will be required in the
immediate period ahead,” Osborne said in a statement to the
 International Monetary Fund  in Washington today. “Further
action will be needed.”  Osborne said policy makers face a greater challenge now in
drafting a response than they did in 2008, when losses from sub-
prime home loans in the U.S. triggered a recession in developed
economies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
