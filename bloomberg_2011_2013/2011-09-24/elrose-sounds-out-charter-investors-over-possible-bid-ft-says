Melrose Plc (MRO)  has approached  Charter
International Plc (CHTR)  shareholders about scuppering  Colfax Corp. (CFX) ’s
1.5 billion-pound ($2.4 billion) bid, the Financial Times said,
citing an unidentified person familiar with the matter.  While Charter’s board backs the Colfax offer, its two
biggest shareholders, Aviva Plc and  Schroders Plc (SDR) , see Melrose
as the best manager for the company’s assets, the newspaper
reported.  The board of Charter, Europe’s biggest welding-equipment
maker, may provide informal support for an improved Melrose
offer at 5 pence to 10 pence less per share than Colfax’s,
according to the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
