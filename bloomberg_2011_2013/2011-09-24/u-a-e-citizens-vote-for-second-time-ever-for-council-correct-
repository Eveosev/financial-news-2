(Corrects to citizens in second paragraph.)  The  United Arab Emirates  is today
holding the second election for its government advisory board in
the federation’s 40-year history  About 15 percent of citizens are eligible to vote for 450
candidates vying for 20 seats on the Federal National Council.
Another 20 seats are selected by the rulers of the federation’s
seven emirates.  While the U.A.E. hasn’t experienced the level of political
protest that swept across other Arab countries, activists
circulated an online petition in April demanding that balloting
for seats on the council be held through universal elections.
The petition, signed by about 140 people including academics and
journalists, also called for amending the constitution to give
the body full legislative and regulatory authority.  Five of the activists, including a professor at the  Abu
Dhabi  branch of Sorbonne University, are were arrested and are
on trial for insulting President Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed al Nahyan and his brother, Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al Nahyan.  The U.A.E. includes Abu Dhabi, the capital, Dubai, Sharjah,
Ajman, Umm-al-Quain, Fujeirah and Ras Al-Khaimah. About 130,000
U.A.E. nationals can vote under the country’s electoral college
system. That number is 20 times higher than the first election
in 2006. The winners of today’s election will be announced on
Sept. 28.  To contact the reporter on this story:
