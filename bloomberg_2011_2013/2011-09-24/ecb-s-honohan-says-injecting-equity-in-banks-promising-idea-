European Central Bank Governing
Council member  Patrick Honohan  said a proposal to allow  Europe ’s
rescue fund to inject equity into distressed banks is a
“promising idea,” which “lowers the risk for the borrowing
country.”  He also said the idea of leveraging the rescue fund should
not be “seen as free lunch.” Honohan was speaking at a panel
discussion in  Washington .  To contact the reporter on this story:
