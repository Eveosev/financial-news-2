Cocoa exports from Cameroon,
 Africa ’s fourth-biggest producer of the crop, fell by 13 percent
in August, the first month of the new season, according to the
country’s Cocoa and Coffee Board.  Exports for the period dropped to 9,777 metric tons from
11,179 metric tons during the same period last year, the board
said in an e-mailed report from the port city of Douala today.  Fourteen companies were involved in the trade with TELCAR
Cocoa Ltd., the highest cocoa marketing company in the west
African nation, exporting 3,110 metric tons, followed by OLAM
CAM, with 2,709 tons, and CAMACO, with 1,169 tons.  Rains have been exceptionally heavy and prolonged this year
in the cocoa producing zone of the south west region, James
Mosima, vice president of the National Cocoa and Coffee
Producers’ Association said by phone from Muyuka, 400 kilometers
(250 miles) southwest of Yaounde. Not only have the rains
rendered the drying of beans difficult, they have degraded the
roads through which the beans are transported, he said.  Cameroon’s cocoa season runs from Aug. 1 to July 31.  Ivory
Coast , Ghana,  Indonesia  and  Nigeria  are the world’s biggest
cocoa producers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
