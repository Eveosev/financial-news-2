Canada would be able to handle a
shock eminating from  Europe  as it has limited “exposure” to
that region’s banks, Finance Minister  Jim Flaherty  said.  Speaking in an interview with the CTV Television Network,
Flaherty said there is no evidence that the country’s economy is
in recession and it remains in “relatively” good shape.  Flaherty also told CTV that European policy makers must use
‘overwhelming’ fiscal force to contain its sovereign debt
crisis. In a subsequent interview with CBC Television, Flaherty
said Canada is encouraging Europe to act quickly in this regard.  Flaherty told CBC the country has the flexibility to
respond to an economic shock. He also said the Canadian dollar,
which fell the most since 2008 last week against the  U.S.
dollar , was being affected by investors buying assets perceived
to be the safest.  To contact the reporter on this story:
