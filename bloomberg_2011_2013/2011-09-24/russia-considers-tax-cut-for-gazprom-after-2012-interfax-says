Russia  will consider cutting the
rate of natural-gas extraction tax paid by OAO Gazprom when
planning the 2013 budget, Interfax said, citing Finance Minister
Alexei Kudrin.  The change would come at the same time as a cancellation of
export-tax exemptions for gas shipped via the Blue Stream
pipeline to  Turkey , Kudrin said, according to the news service.  Russia failed to reach an agreement with Turkey on rolling
back the Blue Stream exemptions in time for next yearâ€™s budget
planning, Interfax cited him as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
