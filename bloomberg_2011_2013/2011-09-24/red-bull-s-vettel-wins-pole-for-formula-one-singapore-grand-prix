Red Bull’s Sebastian Vettel topped
qualifying for tomorrow’s Singapore Grand Prix, the defending
world champion’s 11th pole in 14 races this season.  Vettel posted a time of 1 minute, 44.381 seconds around the
Marina Bay Street circuit to beat out teammate Mark Webber.
McLaren teammates Jenson Button and  Lewis Hamilton  will start on
the second row, in front of Ferrari’s Fernando Alonso and  Felipe
Massa .  Vettel has won eight times this season to lead Alonso by
112 points in the season standings with six races left.  There are three finishing scenarios tomorrow which would
give Vettel his second consecutive championship. The German can
not claim the crown if Alonso finishes among the top three.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
