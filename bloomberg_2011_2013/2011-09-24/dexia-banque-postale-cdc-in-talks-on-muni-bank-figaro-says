Dexia SA (DEXB) , La Banque Postale and
state-owned Caisse des Depots et Consignations are working to
form a new bank for municipalities, Le Figaro said today, citing
unnamed sources.  The new bank, which would be held by Banque Postale and
Caisse des Depots with Dexia as an investor, would take on the
role of Credit Local de  France , a predecessor to French-Belgian
bank Dexia, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
