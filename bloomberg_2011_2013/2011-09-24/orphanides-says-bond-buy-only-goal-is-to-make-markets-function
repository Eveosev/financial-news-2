European Central Bank Governing
Council member Athanasios Orphanides said the central bank’s
government bond purchase program is “a monetary policy tool”
only devised to “facilitate the transmission of monetary
policy” in the euro area.  He also said that monetary policy cannot solve the euro
region’s sovereign debt crisis. Orphanides was speaking in
 Washington .  To contact the reporter on this story:
