Dexia SA (DEXB)  Chief Executive Officer
Pierre Mariani said there are no plans to split the French-
Belgian lender or change its ownership,  De Tijd  reported on its
website, citing an interview.  Mariani declined to comment on a report in Le Figaro that
France’s Caisse des Depots et Consignations, Dexia’s biggest
shareholder, and La Banque Postale SA plan to set up a new
lender to French municipalities together with Dexia’s French
unit Dexia Credit Local, the newspaper said.  Mariani added that Dexia won’t accept a project that
separates the “good parts” and the “bad parts” of the bank,
 De Tijd  reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
