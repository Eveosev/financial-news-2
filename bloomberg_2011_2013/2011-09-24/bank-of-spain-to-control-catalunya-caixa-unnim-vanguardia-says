The Bank of  Spain â€™s rescue fund,
known as FROB, will take over 90 percent of Catalunya Caixa bank
and almost the whole of lender Unnim starting the first week of
October,  La Vanguardia  reported, without citing anyone.  Both Catalunya Caixa and Unnim will be controlled by the
FROB after they failed to get investors or partners to
recapitalize them, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
