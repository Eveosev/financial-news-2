Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin  plans
to impose higher taxes on  Russia ’s billionaires and other
wealthy citizens if elected to a third term as president next
year.  “Taxes for people with high incomes, for the rich -- and
we have more and more of these people -- should be higher than
for the average class, the majority of citizens,” Putin told
the congress of Russia’s ruling United Russia party in Moscow
today. Higher taxes for the wealthy should fall “primarily on
consumption, real estate and property,” he said.  Russia should keep its flat 13-percent income tax rate
because it makes collection more efficient, Putin added.  The number of Russian billionaires jumped to 114 in 2010,
according to an annual list by Finans magazine in February,
surpassing the 101 reached in 2008. The combined wealth of
Russia’s 10 richest people rose 31 percent to $182 billion, the
Moscow-based weekly said.  Russia’s economy expanded 4 percent last year, while the
 Micex index (INDEXCF)  of stocks gained 22 percent.  On Sept. 19, U.S. President  Barack Obama  targeted the rich
for $1.5 trillion of tax increases over the next decade, and
threatened to veto any cut to benefits under the Medicare
health-insurance plan for the elderly unless wealthy Americans
pay higher taxes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
