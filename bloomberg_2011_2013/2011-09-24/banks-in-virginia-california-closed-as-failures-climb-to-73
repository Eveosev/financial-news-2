U.S. state banking regulators
shuttered lenders in Virginia and  California , pushing this
year’s tally of failures to 73.  Officials closed Norfolk, Virginia-based Bank of the
Commonwealth and Nevada City, California’s Citizens Bank of
Northern California, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. said
today on its  website . The two failures drained the deposit-
insurance fund of $305.5 million.  Banks are closing under stress from commercial real estate
loans, tied to property values that fell about 49 percent from
the October 2007 peak through April, according to Moody’s
Investors Service. Regulators have shuttered more than 390
lenders since the start of 2008, FDIC data show.  Southern Bank & Trust Co. of Mount Olive,  North Carolina ,
picked up the Virginia lender’s almost $902 million in deposits
and about $924 million in assets, the FDIC said. Southern Bank
added 21 branches in what was state’s second failure this year.  Chico, California-based Tri Counties Bank added seven
branches, almost $290 million in assets and about $253 million
in deposits from Citizens Bank, the FDIC said. Four banks have
been closed in California this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
