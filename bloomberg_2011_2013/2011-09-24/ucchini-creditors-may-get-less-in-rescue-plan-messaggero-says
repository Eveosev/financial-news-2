Lucchini SpAâ€™s creditors may be
refunded 100 million euros ($135 million) under a revised plan
to rescue the steelmaker controlled by OAO Severstal, Il
Messaggero reported, without saying how it got the information.  The amount is less than the 180 million euros that lenders,
including  BNP Paribas (BNP) ,  Intesa Sanpaolo SpA (ISP)  and  UniCredit SpA (UCG) ,
expected to get back under a previous plan, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
