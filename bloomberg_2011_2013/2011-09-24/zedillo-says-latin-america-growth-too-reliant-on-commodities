Latin American nations need to
diversify and develop their economies after relying too much on
surging commodity prices for growth, said  Ernesto Zedillo , the
former president of Mexico.  “We have been riding on this commodity boom, and that put
us to sleep about all the structural problems that we haven’t
addressed,” Zedillo, a professor at Yale University, said today
on a panel at the  International Monetary Fund  and World Bank
meetings in Washington. “Even if the worst disaster doesn’t
happen I fear we will have in front of us a difficult decade,
sooner or later.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
