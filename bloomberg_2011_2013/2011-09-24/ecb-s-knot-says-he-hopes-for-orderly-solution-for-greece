European Central Bank Governing
Council member Klaas Knot said he hopes for an “orderly”
solution for  Greece , while preparing for all possible risks.  “We all aim for an orderly way out for Greece,” Knot, who
also heads the Netherlands’ central bank, told Dutch broadcaster
NOS in a radio interview released today. “What I’ve said is
just that it is not certain and that there are risks attached to
that process. As a central banker I have to prepare for all
risks.”  In an interview published yesterday, Knot said he no longer
excluded a Greek default.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
