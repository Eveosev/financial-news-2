ThyssenKrupp AG (TKA)  hasn’t experienced
a decline in orders, Westdeutsche Allgemeine reported, citing an
interview with Chief Executive Officer Heinrich Hiesinger.  Current share prices reflect “pure hysteria” that has
nothing to do with reality, the media group cited Hiesinger as
saying.  While the debt crisis will cause the economy to slow down,
Hiesinger said he doesn’t expect a recession, WAZ reported.  -- Editors: James Kraus, Digby Lidstone  To contact the reporter on this story:
