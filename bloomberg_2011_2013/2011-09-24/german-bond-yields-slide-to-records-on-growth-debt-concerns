German government bond yields
dropped to record lows this week as stocks tumbled and  Europe 
struggled to reach a solution to its debt crisis amid concern
the world is on the brink of another recession.  Thirty-year yields slumped the most since the week ending
Dec. 5, 2008, as Group of 20 finance chiefs meeting in
 Washington  pledged to address rising risks to the global economy
and pushed Europe to contain its sovereign-debt woes. The
 International Monetary Fund  cut its forecast for global growth
as a gauge of European manufacturing fell.  “Clearly bund yields are at pretty low levels on historic
grounds, but this is a market where investors are keen on
holding safe-haven assets,” said  Elisabeth Afseth , a fixed-
income analyst at Evolution Securities Ltd. in  London . “The
widening of spreads is worrying.”  German 10-year yields slipped 13 basis points to 1.74
percent at 4:46 p.m. in London yesterday after falling to a
record low 1.636 percent. Two-year rates fell 12 basis points to
0.39 percent, after dropping to 0.324 percent. The 30-year bund
yield slid to 2.42 percent, the least ever according to
Bloomberg data.  Investors sought the security of German debt, considered
Europe’s safest, as a Federal Reserve plan to buy longer-term
Treasuries failed to strengthen growth expectations. The IMF
projects the world economy will expand 4 percent this year and
next, according to a Sept. 20 report, compared with June
forecasts of 4.3 percent in 2011 and 4.5 percent in 2012.  Greek Yield Record  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index dropped to a two-year low as
data showed euro-area services and manufacturing output shrank
for the first time in more than two years in September,
according to Markit Economics.  Greek two-year note yields posted their biggest weekly gain
since it joined the euro region as credit-default swaps signaled
a 94 percent probability the government will renege on its
obligations within five years. The debt-saddled nation this week
promised cuts in pensions and public workers’ wages in an effort
to persuade European governments and the IMF to release an 8
billion-euro ($11 billion) loan installment to save it from
default next month.  Greek two-year note yields surged 1,476 basis points to
69.76 percent. The 10-year yield rose 250 basis points to 23.69
percent.  Italian and Spanish borrowing costs were curbed as the
 European Central Bank  were said to buy the nations’ securities.
 Spain ’s 10-year yield fell seven basis points to 5.22 percent,
while Italian debt of a similar maturity rose 13 basis points to
5.65 percent. Italy plans to auction securities due between 2013
and 2022 next week, while  Germany  is scheduled to sell five-year
notes.  To contact the reporters on this story:
