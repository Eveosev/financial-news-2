Bank of Greece (TELL)  Governor  George Provopoulos  said structural reforms in  Greece  have to be pursued
immediately and achieving a primary surplus would change  market
sentiment  toward Greece, Real News newspaper said, citing an
interview.  Provopoulos, who is also a member of the European Central
Bank’s Governing Council, said Greece’s delays in cutting state
spending has forced the country to adopt tax measures that
deepen the recession, Athens-based Real News said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
