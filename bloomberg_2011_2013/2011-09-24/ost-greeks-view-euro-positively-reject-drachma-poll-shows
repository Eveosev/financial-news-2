Most Greeks support their country’s
use of the euro as its currency and say a return to the drachma
would likely make things worse for the country, according to a
poll by Public Issue for Kathimerini newspaper.  Sixty-three percent of 1,010 Greeks had a positive view of
the euro compared with 34 percent who said they had a negative
opinion of it, according to the poll, which was conducted
between Sept. 14 and Sept. 19 and published in the Athens- based
newspaper today.  Sixty percent said they think  Greece  may default while 59
percent said a departure from the euro area is unlikely,
according to the poll. Two-thirds said a return to the drachma
would “probably” be worse for Greece, the same percentage as
in a survey in April. The poll had a 3.2 percentage point margin
of error.  To contact the reporter on this story:
