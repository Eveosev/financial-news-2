     Sept. 24 (Bloomberg) --A universal, single-tariff trading
system should be pursued to eventually replace regional and
bilateral trade accords, including the North America Free Trade
Agreement, said  Ernesto Zedillo , the former president of Mexico.  “In my ideal world, all these regional agreements, sooner
rather than later, would disappear,” Zedillo said, speaking on
a panel at the  International Monetary Fund  and World Bank
meetings in Washington.  Zedillo, a professor at Yale University, said that while
the World Trade Organization’s Doha Round may not be completed
successfully, nations need to continue pursuing the agenda.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
