JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  chief
Economist Bruce Kasman said  Greece  is insolvent and headed
toward a depression that will cause catastrophic damage across
Europe.  “We have a social contract that’s been broken between
Greece and the rest of the region,” Kasman said today during a
panel discussion at the Institute of International Finance
annual meeting in Washington. “Greece is insolvent and the
European Union needs to deal with that. It hasn’t yet come to
terms with that.”  Kasman said the uncoordinated and sporadic response from
the region’s political leaders has “fed fears” in the markets
that they don’t have the wherewithal to deal with the region’s
fiscal problems. The lack of clarity in solving Greece’s credit
problems has exacerbated the problem.  “Damage is done,” Kasman said. “ Europe  in our mind is
entering recession.” Greece is heading toward a depression, he
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
