Belle Corp. is “confident”
yesterday’s market slump won’t derail its stock rights offer to
raise funds for a casino project in  Manila , Vice Chairman Willy
Ocier said.  “Market bumps come and go but the prospects for gaming
tourism and entertainment remain bright and exciting,” Ocier
said in a mobile phone text message today. “I am confident the
Belle rights issue will be fully taken up by existing
shareholders.”  Belle plunged 11 percent, its sharpest loss since February
2007, to close at 3.50 pesos in Manila yesterday. The company is
offering one share at 3 pesos for every six held by investors.  The stock sank on concern a sell-off in equities will damp
investor demand for the rights offer, according to Peter Lee,
senior investment officer at IGC Securities Inc. The Philippine
Stock Exchange Index slumped 5.1 percent yesterday, its biggest
decline since October 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
