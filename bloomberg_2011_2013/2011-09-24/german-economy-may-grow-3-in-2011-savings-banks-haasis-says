The German economy may grow 3
percent in 2011 and about 1 percent in 2012, said Heinrich Haasis, president of the German association of savings banks.  While the worldwide outlook is cloudy, German companies are
prepared for a possible decline, Haasis said in an e-mailed
statement today.  A review of 47,000 corporate balance sheets for fiscal year
2010 showed that German companies on average have an equity
ratio of 18 percent. The number is a 4-percentage point increase
from 2009 and double the amount in 2005, he said.  European governments need to signal strong backing of the
euro and the euro rescue funds, Haasis said in a separate
statement. Because they don’t speak with one voice, national
leaders undermine trust in the rescue efforts that could help
tackle the crisis, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
