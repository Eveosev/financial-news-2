German Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  said policy makers can make the European Financial
Stability Facility more efficient by leveraging it without
involving the  European Central Bank .  “I’m not just saying what can’t be done, I’m also saying
what can be done” in terms of leveraging the EFSF, Schaeuble
told reporters after the meeting of the  International Monetary
Fund  in  Washington . “We want to use it in a most efficient way.
There are other forms of applying leverage than taking recourse
to the ECB.”  Public debate increased this week over how to allow the
EFSF to buy bonds in markets and aid banks once it is revamped
about mid-October. Implicating the ECB in leveraging the EFSF
would violate EU treaties, Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann
said today.  Senior finance officials will examine next week the cost
advantages of accelerating the start of a permanent rescue
program, the European Stability Mechanism, a year earlier than
its currently planned July 2013 start, according to a document
prepared for the meetings and obtained by Bloomberg News.  “Maybe we can manage it a bit earlier,” Schaeuble said,
referring to the introduction of the ESM. The EFSF is a
“preliminary solution and we want a permanent solution as
quickly as possible.”  Schaeuble said the ESM will have a “quite different
lasting, stabilizing, confidence-creating function” and  Germany 
“would not oppose” bringing it forward.  To contact the reporter on this story:
