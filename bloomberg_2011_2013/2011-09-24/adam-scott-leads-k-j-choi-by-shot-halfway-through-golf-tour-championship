Australian Aaron Baddeley and
 Hunter Mahan  of the U.S. share the lead going into the final
round of golf’s Tour Championship, the final event on the U.S.
PGA Tour’s FedEx Cup schedule.  Baddeley and Mahan are 9 under par at East Lake Golf Club
in Atlanta. Baddeley finished with four consecutive birdies on
the back nine for a 6-under 64, while Mahan finished with a 66.  “Overall, I think it was a very good day,” Baddeley told
reporters. “I did a lot of work this week on my putting, so I
feel like it’s definitely paying dividends right now.”  Australian Jason Day and  South Korea ’s K.J. Choi are two
strokes behind at 7-under, with  Luke Donald , the world’s top-
ranked golfer, and Bill Haas one stroke further back.  The winner of the Tour Championship, which features the top
30 players on the FedEx Cup points list, gets a $1.4 million
check. The winner of the season-long FedEx Cup receives $10
million.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
