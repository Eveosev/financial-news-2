The pound fell for a fifth
consecutive week versus the dollar, its longest losing streak in
more than a year, amid speculation the  Bank of England  will
respond to slowing global economic growth.  Sterling slumped to its lowest level against the dollar in
more than a year as central bank policy makers said on Sept. 21
they may need to buy more bonds to keep borrowing costs capped
as the economic recovery falters. The British currency fell to
an all-time low versus the yen. The  International Monetary Fund 
cut its 2011 and 2012 U.K. economic growth forecasts this week
to 1.1 percent and 1.6 percent. The Washington-based IMF
previously projected expansion of 1.5 percent and 2.3 percent
respectively.  Sterling’s weakness “is all about dollar demand,” said
Jane Foley, a senior foreign-exchange strategist at Rabobank
International in London. “When the market feels this tense,
people want liquidity, and the dollar is still the most liquid
currency. The Bank of England minutes and the IMF downgrade
added an extra layer of negative pressure on the pound.”  The pound weakened 2.1 percent this week to $1.5458 at 4:51
p.m. in  London  yesterday. That’s its steepest weekly drop since
November 2010. The U.K. currency depreciated 2.7 percent to
117.96 yen, after falling to a record low 116.84 yen on Sept.
22. Sterling was little changed versus the euro at 87.42 pence,
from 87.41 pence on Sept. 16.  The pound has gained 1.1 percent in the past three months,
paring a 12-month decline to 4.4 percent, the worst performer
among 10 developed-market currencies tracked by Bloomberg
Correlation-Weighted Currency Indexes.  ‘Increasingly Probable’  Most of the Bank of England’s nine-member Monetary Policy
Committee said an expansion of the 200 billion-pound bond-
purchase program was “increasingly probable,” minutes of their
September meeting showed. The committee voted 8-1 to maintain
the current size of the plan and was unanimous in keeping the
benchmark  interest rate  at a record low 0.5 percent.  The  Federal Reserve  signaled “significant downside risks”
in the  U.S. economy . The U.S. central bank said Sept. 21 it will
extend the average maturities of bonds in its portfolio by
purchasing $400 billion of long-term debt and selling an equal
amount of shorter-term securities to push down yields on longer-
dated Treasuries.  Gilts advanced, pushing 10-year yields down 11 basis points
this week to 2.37 percent. The two-year yield was little changed
at 0.53 percent. The rate dropped to a record 0.477 percent on
Sept. 22, the lowest since Bloomberg began collecting data on
the securities in 1992. The 30-year gilt yield fell to a record
low 3.449 percent yesterday.  “The market was surprised by the Fed’s downbeat assessment
of the economy,” said  Marc Ostwald , a fixed-income strategist
at Monument Securities Ltd. in London. “The move in the yield
curve is led by the Fed, because of the relationship between
long-dated gilt yields and Treasury yields.”  The U.K. Debt Management Office said on Sept. 21 it plans
to sell 3.75 percent bonds maturing in July 2052 through banks
next week, subject to market conditions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
