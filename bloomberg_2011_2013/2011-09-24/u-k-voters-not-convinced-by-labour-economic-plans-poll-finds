Most U.K. voters don’t think the
opposition  Labour Party  has the right policies in place to
rescue the economy, according an ICM Research poll commissioned
by the  Guardian  newspaper.  Of 1,003 people surveyed Sept. 20-21, 34 percent said
Labour had the right economic plans. Broader support for Labour
policies was about evenly divided, with 41 percent saying the
party “has the right policies to appeal to someone like me”
while 40 percent disagreed.  Among committed Labour voters, 49 percent said opposition
party leader  Ed Miliband  is the right person to head the party,
while 33 percent disagreed. Overall, 30 percent said Miliband
was the right leader for the party. The Labour leader’s approval
rating is lower than those of Prime Minister  David Cameron ,
Deputy Prime Minister  Nick Clegg  and Chancellor of the Exchequer
George Osbourne.  Support for Labour among those surveyed was strongest in
Wales, northern England and Scotland, while only 43 percent in
southern England said the party deserved another spell in power.
The survey didn’t provide any margin of error.  Labour’s annual conference opens tomorrow in Liverpool.  To contact the reporter on this story:
