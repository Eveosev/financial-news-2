Arsenal midfielder  Jack Wilshere 
will have surgery on his right ankle and be out for a “period
of months,” the Premier League club said on its website.  Wilshere, 19, sustained a stress fracture in preseason and
has been wearing a protective boot to help it heal. Scans this
week revealed the injury has not responded properly and surgery
will be performed in two days.  “Wilshere is now expected to be out for a period of
months,” Arsenal said. “Following surgery, these timescales
will become more specific.”  Arsenal has lost three of its first five Premier League
games this season. The Gunners sold captain Cesc Fabregas and
Samir Nasri last month and have been withouth midfielders
including Abou Diaby because of injury.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
