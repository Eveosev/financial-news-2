Greece may be unable to avoid
defaulting on its sovereign debts and Europe should prepare for
that event, billionaire investor  George Soros  said.  ‘Greece needs to do everything it can to avoid default, but
it may not be able to,’’ Soros said on a panel today at the
 International Monetary Fund  and World Bank meetings in
Washington. “It’s very important from a point of view of
reassuring the markets” to prepare for a potential Greek
default, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
