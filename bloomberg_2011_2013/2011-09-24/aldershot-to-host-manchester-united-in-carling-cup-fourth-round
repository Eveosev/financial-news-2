Aldershot, the lowest-ranked team
remaining in the competition, will host  Manchester United  in the
fourth round of English soccer’s Carling Cup.  Aldershot is 11th in fourth-tier League Two, 78 places
below Premier League leader United. The Shots have beaten West
Ham, Carlisle and Rochdale, all from higher leagues, on their
way to the last 16.  Five matchups of Premier League clubs were determined by
today’s draw as Wolverhampton is home for Manchester City,
Blackburn hosts Newcastle, Bolton is at Arsenal, Liverpool
visits Stoke and Everton hosts Chelsea.  Fourth-round games in  England ’s second-tier club
competition will be played the week beginning Oct. 24.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
