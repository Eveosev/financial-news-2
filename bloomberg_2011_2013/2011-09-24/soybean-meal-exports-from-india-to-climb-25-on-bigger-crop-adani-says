Soybean meal exports from  India ,
Asia’s largest supplier of  animal feed , may climb 25 percent
next year as domestic oilseed output surges, according to Adani
Wilmar Ltd., a processor and exporter.  Shipments may surge to 5 million metric tons in the year
beginning Nov. 1, from an estimated 4 million tons this year,
 Atul Chaturvedi , chief executive officer, told reporters in
Mumbai today. Traders likely sold 250,000 tons to 300,000 tons
of soybean meal from the new crop, less than the 700,000 tons
contracted to export a year earlier, he said.  Crude palm oil imports by India have “dried up” in recent
days after Indonesia announced a cut in tax on exports of
refined palm oil products, Chaturvedi said. The country may
import 8.5 million tons to 8.8 million tons of edible oils in
the year beginning Nov. 1, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
