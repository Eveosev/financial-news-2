The Bank of  Spain  will ask Spanish
banks and savings institutions for a report explaining their
current situation and business plans for next year,  El
Economista  reported, citing unidentified people in the industry.  The data will help the central bank determine banksâ€™
capital needs and assess whether lenders may need further public
funds or may pursue new mergers next year, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
