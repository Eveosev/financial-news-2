Hurricane Hilary, the eighth named
storm of the Eastern Pacific hurricane season, is moving away
from the Mexican coast as it retains its strength, the U.S.
National Hurricane Center said in its latest advisory.  Hilary, a Category 4 storm on the five-step Saffir-Simpson
scale with top winds of 140 miles (225 kilometers) per hour, is
about 210 miles southwest of Manzanillo,  Mexico . The Miami-based
center posted an advisory just before 11 a.m. New York time.  The storm is moving west at about 12 mph, and is expected
to remain a “major hurricane” for the next two days, the
center said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
