Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has
opened contract talks with captain Robin  van Persie  and four
other top players, the  Daily Mail  said.  Wenger has also spoken to defender Thomas Vermaelen,
strikers Andrey Arshavin and Theo Walcott and midfielder Alex
Song about new deals, the Mail said.  Wenger wants to secure the future of the players, who have
less than two years left on their current contracts, to avoid
them leaving like Samir Nasri and Gael Clichy did this summer.
Arsenal sold the French internationals because neither would
sign a new agreement and could leave for free when their current
deals expired after this season.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
