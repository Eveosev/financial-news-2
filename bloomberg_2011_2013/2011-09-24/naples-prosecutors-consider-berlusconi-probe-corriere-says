Prosecutors in Naples want to
investigate Italian Prime Minister  Silvio Berlusconi  for
allegedly encouraging a businessman charged with extortion to
lie about details of the case on his behalf, daily  Corriere
della Sera  reported, citing the prosecutors.  A decision may come on Sept. 26, according to the Italian
newspaper. Berlusconi’s lawyer, Piero Longo, was cited by the
newspaper as saying the prosecutors don’t have jurisdiction
because the alleged offense would have taken place in Rome and
not in Naples.  To contact the reporter on this story:
