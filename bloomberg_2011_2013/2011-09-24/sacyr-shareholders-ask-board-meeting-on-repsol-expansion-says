Sacyr Vallehermoso SA (SYV)  shareholders
called for an urgent board meeting to obtain details of an
agreement between Sacyr and Petroleos Mexicanos to control
almost 30 percent of  Repsol YPF SA (REP) ,  Expansion  reported.  The shareholders, which include Demetrio Carceller, Grupo
Satocan and businessman Juan Abello’s investment company
Torreal, want to hold a meeting before Spain’s biggest oil
company holds its ordinary monthly board meeting on Sept. 28,
the newspaper said, without citing anyone.  Among the shareholders that may back Carceller, Satocan and
Torreal are several savings banks that hold 12 percent of the
syndicated capital, Expansion said. The lenders, which may exit
Sacyr, include Novacaixagalicia, Unicaja, Caja Murcia and Caja
Avila, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
