Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY)  Chairman
Win Bischoff may retire next year, the London-based  Times 
reported, without citing anyone.  The bank has discussed Bischoff’s possible retirement with
investors and U.K. Financial Investments, the body that manages
the government’s bank holdings, the newspaper said.  A Lloyds spokesman said Bischoff has no intention of
standing down at “this stage,” the Times reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
