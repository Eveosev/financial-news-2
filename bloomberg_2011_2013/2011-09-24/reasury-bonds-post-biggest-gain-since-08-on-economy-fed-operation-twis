Treasury 30-year bonds had their
biggest gains in almost three years as investors sought refuge
in  U.S. government debt  amid concern the global economy is on
the brink of another recession.  Ten-year note yields dropped to a record yesterday as
policy makers worked to contain contagion from the European
sovereign debt crisis. Yields on 30-year bonds dropped 41 basis
points on the week after the  Federal Reserve  said on Sept. 21
that it would buy longer-term debt to lower borrowing costs in
an initiative known as Operation Twist. The central bank on
Sept. 30 will announce its purchase schedule for October.  “Twist will take out as many 30-year bonds as are
auctioned each month, so that’s putting downward pressure on
yields,” said  Ray Remy , head of fixed income in  New York  at
Daiwa Capital Markets America Inc., one of 20 primary dealers
that trade directly with the Fed. “The European situation is
not going away.”  Thirty-year yields fell to 2.90 percent yesterday in New
York, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices, the biggest
decline since December 2008. The 3.75 percent bond due August
2041 rose 8 21/32 to 116 29/32.  The 10-year yield dropped to a record low of 1.6714
percent. Treasury 10-year yields have fallen more than 1
percentage point during the past three months.  Treasury Returns  Treasuries have returned 9.8 percent this year compared
with 5.9 percent in 2010, according to Bank of America Merrill
Lynch Indexes. Ten-year notes have returned 18 percent, while
30-year bonds have returned 36 percent.  The U.S. will sell $99 billion in notes next week,
including $35 billion in two-year notes, an equal amount in
five-year debt and $29 billion in seven-year securities on three
consecutive days starting Sept. 27.  “There are significant downside risks to the economic
outlook,” the Fed said in a statement on Sept. 21. The central
bank said it will extend the maturities of its Treasury holdings
by purchasing $400 billion of long-term debt and selling an
equal amount of shorter-term securities.  The operation drew three dissents as Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  struggled to find consensus to help an economy plagued
by 9.1 percent unemployment.  ‘Shock and Awe’  “The Fed gave us a surprise -- a shock and awe that they
needed,” said  David Ader , head of government bond strategy at
 Stamford , Connecticut-based CRT Capital Group LLC on Sept. 22.  Operation Twist follows two previous attempts by policy
makers to jumpstart the economy by purchasing securities to
reduce borrowing costs. In a program known as quantitative
easing, the Fed purchased $300 billion in Treasuries in 2009.
Fed policy makers said on Nov. 3 the central bank would expand
asset purchases through its so-called QE2 program to $600
billion until June.  The central bank also announced a measure to support the
mortgage market by reinvesting maturing housing debt into
mortgage-backed securities instead of U.S. government debt.  The difference between two- and 10-year Treasury yields
narrowed to 1.48 percentage points on an intraday basis Sept.
22, the least since January 2009. The extra yield 30-year bonds
offer compared with two-year notes narrowed to 2.54 percentage
points, the least since March 2009.  Inflation Measure  The difference in yield between 10-year Treasuries and
inflation-protected debt, a measure of the outlook for consumer
prices known as the break-even rate, touched 1.67 percentage
points Sept. 22, the lowest since September 2010.  Treasuries were also buoyed this week by a flight to safety
stemming from concern the European debt crisis may push the
continent into a recession. Senior finance officials next week
will examine the cost advantages of setting up a permanent
rescue fund, known as the European Stability Mechanism, in July
2012, a year ahead of schedule, according to a staff paper
prepared for the meetings and obtained by Bloomberg News.  Greece  committed to additional measures this week to secure
the next payment in its 110 billion-euro ($149 billion) bailout
and convince European lawmakers to pass its second bailout worth
159 billion euros. Eight Greek lenders had their credit ratings
lowered yesterday by Moody’s Investors Service on concern over
their holdings of the nation’s government bonds.  “The market is beginning to ignore the short-term band-
aid,” said  Charles Comiskey , head of Treasury trading at Bank
of Nova Scotia in New York. “It wants real reform. People feel
there’s going to be a contagion effect spreading from  Europe  to
the U.S. and the world.”  The  International Monetary Fund  on Sept. 20 lowered its
global growth forecast, citing European turmoil and the
potential for an American fiscal impasse.  The world economy will expand 4 percent this year and next,
the IMF said, compared with June forecasts of 4.3 percent in
2011 and 4.5 percent in 2012. The U.S. growth projection for
2011 was lowered to 1.5 percent from 2.5 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
