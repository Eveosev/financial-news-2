Allianz SE (ALV)  chief economist Michael Heise opposes a Greek debt cut now that would cause “tremendous
problems” for  Greece  and a crisis that might spread to other
countries,  Deutschlandradio  reported.  While European banks, including those from France, would
survive a Greek insolvency, a writedown must be avoided by all
means, the radio station cited Heise as saying.  The economic situation now is more stable than before the
Lehman Brothers Holdings, Inc. bankruptcy in 2008 and
governments are on alert to assist banks if necessary, Heise
also said, according to Deutschlandradio.  To contact the reporter on this story:
