An 11,023-pound research satellite
used in the study of Earth’s ozone layer came down today off the
West Coast of the U.S., the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration said on its website.  The Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite, which weighed five
metric tons, entered Earth’s atmosphere between 11:23 p.m.
yesterday and 1:09 a.m. New York time this morning, NASA said.
The  Joint Space Operations Center  at Vandenberg Air Force Base
in  California  said the satellite came down over the northern
 Pacific Ocean , off the coast.  Nicholas Johnson , an orbital decay scientist for NASA at
 Johnson Space Center  in Houston, said the agency doesn’t know
the precise point where the satellite entered the atmosphere.
Earlier, the agency said it anticipated 26 objects from the
satellite’s breakup to survive and land in an area more than 500
miles (804 kilometers) long.  “The vast majority of that track was over water,” said
Johnson in a conference call. He said there hadn’t been any
sightings of the satellite or debris.  UARS was released by the space shuttle Discovery in 1991 to
study chemicals in the atmosphere, including chlorine monoxide,
which destroys ozone, and methane. It was decommissioned in
2005, with six of its 10 instruments still functioning, and
moved into a lower orbit.  The last time a large  NASA  satellite made an uncontrolled
landing was in 1979, when  Skylab , a space station weighing 75
metric tons and Pegasus 2, a satellite, both fell to Earth.  To contact the reporter on this story:
