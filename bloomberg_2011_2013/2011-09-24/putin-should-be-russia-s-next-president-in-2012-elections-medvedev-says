Russian President  Dmitry Medvedev 
asked the  United Russia  party to support Prime Minister Vladimir Putin’s run in next year’s presidential election and signaled he
is ready to replace Putin as prime minister. He spoke at the
party’s congress in Moscow today.  Medvedev, who was asked by Putin to lead United Russia into
December parliamentary elections, said he was prepared to carry
out “practical work” in the Russian government. Putin, who led
United Russia in the 2007 legislative vote, went on to serve as
prime minister.  “Taking into account the proposals to lead the party list,
to carry out party work and my willingness to engage in
practical work in the government, I believe it would be right if
the congress supported the candidacy of  Vladimir Putin  for the
post of president of the country,” Medvedev said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
