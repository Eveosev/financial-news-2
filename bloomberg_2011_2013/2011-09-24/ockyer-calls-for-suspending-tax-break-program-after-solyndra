California Treasurer Bill Lockyer
said he will ask state officials to freeze new applications for
a program that gave Solyndra LLC a $25.1 million tax break.  Lockyer said he’ll call for suspending the state’s review
and approval of further exemptions at a Sept. 27 meeting of the
California Alternative Energy and Advanced Transportation
Financing Authority, which he chairs.  “In light of recent events, we owe it to taxpayers to see
if there is more we can do to make sure we don’t give their
money to companies headed for a fall,” Lockyer said in an e-
mailed statement.  Fremont, California-based Solyndra, a solar-panel
manufacturer, filed for bankruptcy protection on Sept. 6 after
getting $535 million in loan guarantees from the federal
government.  Its collapse has prompted inquiries by the FBI and
watchdogs at the Treasury and Energy departments. Its financing
was the focus of a congressional investigation that began
earlier this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
