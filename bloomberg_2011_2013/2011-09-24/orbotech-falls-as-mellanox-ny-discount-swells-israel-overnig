The biggest weekly drop in a year
for  Orbotech Ltd. (ORBK) , the Israeli maker of quality-control
equipment used for iPhones and iPads, is prompting Oppenheimer &
Co. to advise buying the shares.  Orbotech dropped 7.8 percent last week to $9.20 in New
York, the biggest decline since the five-day period ending Sept.
10, 2010, pushing its shares to 6.9 estimated earnings, less
than half the average multiple of 15 for companies on the  Nasdaq
Composite Index (CCMP)  and below the 8.9 level for the Bloomberg
Israel-US 25 Index. The benchmark for the largest New York-
traded Israeli companies lost 7.6 percent last week, led by a 14
percent plunge in  Mellanox Technologies Ltd. (MLNX)   The Bloomberg Israel-US 25 Index followed global stocks
lower as concern deepened that the economic slowdown will
overwhelm government efforts to support growth. Shares of Yavne,
Israel-based Orbotech can outperform peers as the company
benefits from mounting demand for tablets and smartphones,
Oppenheimer said.  “Orbotech is very much undervalued,” Srinivasan Sundararajan, an analyst at Oppenheimer in New York, wrote in an
e-mailed report on Sept. 22 after the market closed. “If there
is one company that indeed inspects each of Apple’s products, it
may be Orbotech.”  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  said iPhone sales rose 142 percent from a year
earlier in the quarter ended June 25, while the number of iPads
sold climbed 183 percent.  Statehood  The shekel dropped 1.1 percent versus the dollar last week
and closed at 3.7032 per dollar. The currency is down 4.8
percent this year, which would be the worst annual performance
since 2005 when it lost 6.1 percent.  The Israeli benchmark TA-25 Index fell 1.7 percent to
1,038.91 last week.  Israeli Prime Minister  Benjamin Netanyahu  called on
Palestinian Authority President  Mahmoud Abbas  to meet at the
 United Nations , while reaffirming positions the Palestinians
have rejected as unacceptable for any peace deal.  Israel needs “iron-clad” security guarantees ahead of any
declaration of Palestinian statehood, Netanyahu told the UN
General Assembly on Sept. 23, shortly after Abbas, speaking from
the same podium, asked the UN to recognize a Palestinian state.  The Bank of  Israel  cut on Sept. 22 its forecasts for
economic growth this year and next, citing increased uncertainty
about the global economy.  Israel’s economy will expand 4.7 percent in 2011 and 3.2
percent in 2012, the central bank said, compared with its Aug. 2
predictions of 4.8 percent and 3.9 percent.  Outperform  Orbotech, the maker of optical inspection and repair tools,
derives as much as 60 percent of its sales from printed circuit
boards that can be found in laptops, smartphones and tablets,
according to Oppenheimer.  Shares of the company will rise 74 percent to $16 in the
next 12 to 18 months, said Sundararajan, who initiated coverage
of the company with an “outperform” rating.  Orbotech said on Aug. 1 that it expects earnings of as much
as $1.80 per share this year, above the $1.69 average estimate
of three analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Israeli technology companies raised $569 million in capital
during the second quarter of 2011, the most in two years and up
from $343 million in the same period last year, according to the
Israel Venture Capital-KPMG Quarterly Survey released July 13.  Israel’s stock market was upgraded to developed market
status by MSCI Inc. in May 2010, the same month the 63-year-old
country was accepted to the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development.  Israel, whose population of 7.7 million is similar to
 Switzerland ’s, has about 60 companies listed on  Nasdaq , the most
of any country outside  North America  after  China .  Mellanox, Teva  Mellanox fell 14 percent to $30.26 in the past five days,
the biggest weekly drop since July 2010. The decline pushed the
discount over the Tel Aviv shares to $1.20, the largest spread
among the biggest Israeli companies traded in the U.S.  The adapter maker that’s part owned by Oracle Corp. said on
Sept. 20 that it plans an offering of 3 million ordinary shares.  Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (TEVA) , the world’s largest
maker of generic drugs, lost 8.6 percent to $35.26 last week,
the lowest level since March 2007. The Tel Aviv shares dropped 5
percent to 134.40 shekels, or the equivalent of $36.14.  Alon Holdings Blue Square Israel Ltd., the country’s
second-largest food retailer, increased for the first week in
four, rising 11 percent to $5.86. The Tel Aviv shares added 16
percent to 20.96 shekels, or the equivalent of $5.64.  The U.S. shares retreated 24 percent in the first three
weeks of September as protests in Israel fueled speculation the
government will take measures that will hurt the company’s
profits.  To contact the reporter on this story:
