United, which visits Stoke later, at the top of the standings.  Balotelli put City in front in the 68th minute when he
scored off a pass from  Sergio Aguero . Milner then clinched the
victory in the final minute when he ran onto a pass from David
Silva and put the ball past Tim Howard.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
