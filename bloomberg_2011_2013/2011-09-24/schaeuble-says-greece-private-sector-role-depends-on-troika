German Finance Minister  Wolfgang
Schaeuble  said the role of the private sector in restoring
sustainable finances in Greece depends on the report of the so-
called Troika of the International Monetary Fund,  European
Central Bank  and European Commission.  Delays in reporting on progress in Greece by the Troika
suggest that the assessment of the situation in Greece has
changed since July, Schaeuble said, speaking to reporters today
after the IMF meeting in Washington.  To contact the reporter on this story:
