Two people were killed in car
accidents in Zambia during celebrations of the election of
 Michael Sata  as president, police said.  The deaths weren’t the result of electoral violence and the
elections were peaceful, Ndandula Siamana, a police spokeswoman,
said by phone from the capital, Lusaka.  Sata, 73, known to his supporters as “King Cobra” for his
aggressive campaigning style, was sworn in yesterday as the
country’s new president after beating incumbent Rupiah Banda.  To contact the reporters on this story:
