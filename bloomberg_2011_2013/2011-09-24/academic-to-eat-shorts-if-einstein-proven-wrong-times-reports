The University of Surrey’s Jim al-
Khalili will eat his boxer shorts on television if scientists
from CERN prove  Albert Einstein  wrong, the professor of physics
wrote in the London-based  Times .  CERN, the European Council for Nuclear Research, this week
revealed research that casts doubt on Einstein’s Special Theory
of Relativity and its central tenet that nothing exceeds the
speed of light, the newspaper reported.  Al-Khalili said it is more likely that there is an error in
the data from CERN’s experiment which is said to show that
neutrinos, ghostly subatomic particles, have broken the speed of
light.  “I would be so excited that the humiliation of eating my
shorts in public would be a small price to pay,” al-Khalili
wrote in the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
