Cotton farmers who sell their
produce to Faso Coton,  Burkina Faso ’s third-biggest cotton
company, are facing delays in planting seeds for the 2011-12
harvest amid late seasonal rains, said Marc Leynaert, the
company’s operations director.  “At the moment there isn’t enough rain to allow the
producer to normally plant their cotton,” he said by phone
today. “It is very disturbing.”  The company, which buys from cotton farmers in 11 provinces
in central  Burkina Faso , projected a 61 percent increase in
output for the 2011-12 harvest to 22,000 metric tons, he said.
That target may be reduced if the rains needed to plant and then
grow seeds are further delayed, Leynaert said. The planting
season takes place from June 15 to July 15 and harvesting the
crop will start in November.  More people in Burkina Faso,  Africa ’s largest grower of
cotton, planned to plant the fiber this year after the West
African nation fixed the price for a kilogram (2.2 pounds) of
cotton at 245  CFA francs  ($0.53), Leynaert said. The rate is 35
percent higher than the previous season’s payment.  Faso Coton  farmers didn’t take part in protests against the
price that saw growers in the country’s west who sell to the
biggest cotton company, Societe Burkinabe des Fibres Textiles,
threatened to refuse to plant before backing down on June 14.  Cotton for December delivery rose 0.1 percent to $1.2211
per pound on ICE Futures U.S. in  New York  today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
