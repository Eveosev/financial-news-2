Italy ’s 10-year borrowing costs rose
to the highest in almost three years at a second day of bond
sales in the midst of concern about contagion from the
sovereign-debt crisis.  Italy sold 7.9 billion euros ($11.3 billion) of debt today,
including 3 billion euros of 2021 bonds that yielded 4.94
percent. That’s the highest yield since a sale in October 2008,
and compares with 4.73 percent when similar securities were last
auctioned on May 30. Investors demanded 1.33 times the amount of
10-year bonds sold, compared with 1.50 at the last sale.  Italy’s borrowing costs jumped yesterday at a sale of six-
month securities, the first offering since Moody’s Investors
Service said it may downgrade some of the nation’s banks and as
Greek politicians began a debate on austerity measures needed to
avoid a default. Italian bank stocks fell today, with Banca
Monte dei Paschi di Siena SpA dropping as much as 5.5 percent.  “Yields have risen, but so far it’s not the same kind of
dynamic that we’ve seen in Portugal,  Greece  or Ireland,” said
 Glenn Marci , a strategist at DZ Bank AG in  Frankfurt . “We’ll
see spreads widening for some time until the Greek topic is
really resolved. It’s more a contagion topic, because
fundamentally Italy hasn’t changed. They’re not doing great but
they’re also not doing really badly.”  Italy’s 10-year debt yield trails the 5.67 percent yield
for its Spanish equivalents as of 11:30 a.m. London time today.
The Portuguese 10-year yield was 11.07 percent, Ireland’s was
11.58 percent and Greece’s was 15.86 percent.  Greek Vote  Greek Prime Minister  George Papandreou  faces his second
survival test in a week tomorrow when lawmakers vote on the
package that’s needed before the cash-strapped nation can tap a
fifth loan payment from last year’s 110 billion-euro rescue.
Failure to pass the government’s 78 billion-euro plan may lead
to the euro area’s first sovereign default.  The extra yield that investors demand to hold Italian 10-
year bonds instead of similar-maturity German bunds, the
region’s benchmark government securities, was at 212 basis
points today after rising to a euro-era record of 223 basis
points yesterday. Moody’s placed Italy’s Aa2 local and foreign-
currency government bonds under review for a possible downgrade
on June 17, before putting the banks on review six days later.  Italy also sold 2.6 billion euros of 2014 bonds today to
yield 3.68 percent, compared with 3.43 percent when similar debt
was last sold on May 30. Investors demanded 1.39 times the
amount of bonds sold, compared with 1.34 at the last sale.  The Rome-based Treasury also auctioned 2 billion euros in
2018 bonds to yield 3.38 percent and 991 million euros of 2015
floating rate bonds with a yield of 3.17 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
