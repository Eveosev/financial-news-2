WestLB AG’s owners injected about 19
billion euros ($27.3 billion) into the German lender from 2002
to 2010, of which 14 billion euros consisted of guarantees,
 Handelsblatt  reported, citing a document compiled by savings
banks.  The state of North-Rhine Westphalia and two savings bank
associations plan to give WestLB another 2 billion euros in aid,
according to the newspaper. It’s not yet clear to what extent
the guarantees will be called upon, Handelsblatt said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
