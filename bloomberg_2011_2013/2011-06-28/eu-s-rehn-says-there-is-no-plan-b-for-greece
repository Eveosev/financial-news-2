There is “no plan B” for  Greece  to
avoid default, European Union Economic and Monetary Commissioner
Olli Rehn said.  “This week Greece faces a critical juncture,” Rehn said
in a statement issued today in Brussels. “Both the future of
the country and financial stability in Europe are at stake. I
fully respect the prerogatives and the sovereignty of the Greek
Parliament in the ongoing debate. And I trust that the Greek
political leaders are fully aware of the responsibility that
lies on their shoulders to avoid default.”  ``The only way to avoid immediate default'' is for the Greek
Parliament to endorse the revised economic program, Rehn said.
That ``includes both the medium-term fiscal strategy and the
privatization program. They must be approved if the next tranche
of financial assistance is to be released,'' Rehn said.  “To those who speculate about other options, let me say
this clearly: there is no Plan B to avoid default,” Rehn said.
“The European Union continues to be ready to support Greece.
But  Europe  can only help Greece if Greece helps itself.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
