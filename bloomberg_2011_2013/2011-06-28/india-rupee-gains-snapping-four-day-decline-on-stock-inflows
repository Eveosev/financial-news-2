India ’s rupee halted a four-day
decline after overseas investors boosted their holdings of the
nation’s stocks.  Funds based abroad bought $227 million more shares than
they sold on June 24, the most this month, according to
Securities & Exchange Board of India data. The Dollar Index,
which tracks the U.S. currency against those of six major
trading partners, has dropped 0.3 percent this week, signaling
demand for the perceived safety of the dollar has weakened.  “The rupee is moderately higher because stock inflows have
improved and the dollar has retreated,” said Sudarshan Bhatt,
chief currency trader at  Corporation Bank  in Mumbai. “It may
remain in a narrow range in the short term.”  The rupee was little changed at 45.0350 per dollar as of
the 5 p.m. close in Mumbai, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It has lost 1 percent this quarter, the worst
performance among  Asia ’s 10 most-traded currencies after the
 Thai baht .  Offshore forwards indicate the rupee will trade at 45.61 to
the dollar in three months, compared with expectations of 45.63
yesterday. Forwards are agreements to buy or sell assets at a
set price and date. Non-deliverable contracts are settled in
dollars.  To contact the reporters on this story:
