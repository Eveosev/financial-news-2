Taiwan ’s dollar snapped a three-day
decline on speculation the central bank will raise borrowing
costs this week to tame the fastest inflation in 15 months.
 Government bonds  were little changed.  The currency rebounded from a one-month low before the
central bank meets on June 30 to review its benchmark rate. The
rate will be lifted 12.5 basis points to 1.875 percent,
according to all 17 economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  “ Interest rates  in developed markets are so low, the rate
differentials will encourage more fund inflows in Taiwan,” said
Eric Hsing, a fixed-income trader at First Securities Inc. in
Taipei.  The  Taiwan dollar  strengthened 0.2 percent to NT$28.962
against its U.S. counterpart as of the 4 p.m. local time close,
according to Taipei Forex Inc. The currency touched NT$29.020
yesterday, the weakest level since May 24.  The consumer-price index rose 1.66 percent in May from a
year earlier, compared with 1.32 percent the previous month, the
government reported on June 7. Prices will advance 1.64 percent
in June, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey
before data due July 5.  The yield on the 1.375 percent bonds due March 2021, the
most-traded  government securities , was little changed at 1.49
percent, according to Gretai Securities Market. The rate will
rise to 1.52 percent by the end of the week, Hsing forecast.  The overnight money-market rate, which measures interbank
funding availability, advanced one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 0.36 percent, according to a weighted
average compiled by the Taiwan Interbank Money Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
