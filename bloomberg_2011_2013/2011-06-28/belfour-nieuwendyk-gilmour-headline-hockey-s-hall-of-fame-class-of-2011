Ed Belfour and Joe Nieuwendyk, who
helped lead the  Dallas Stars  to the  Stanley Cup  title in 1999,
have been voted into the Hockey Hall of Fame.  They will be joined by Doug Gilmour and Mark Howe, the Hall
of Fame said in an e-mailed statement. The selection committee
voted today on the Class of 2011, which will be formally
inducted in the Toronto-based Hall on Nov. 14, according to the
statement.  Belfour, 46, played on five teams in his 17-year career,
twice leading the league in save percentage and winning the
Vezina Trophy as best goaltender in 1991 and 1993. The Manitoba
native won his only Stanley Cup title in 1999. This was his
first year on the ballot.  Nieuwendyk, 44, played three seasons at  Cornell University 
before winning the NHL’s Rookie of the Year award in 1988 with
the Calgary Flames. The current general manager of the Stars won
Stanley Cup titles with the Flames in 1989,  Dallas  in 1999 and
the  New Jersey Devils  in 2003.  “Every player does their best year after year and strives
to play at a very high level,” Nieuwendyk said in the
statement. “I truly love the game and love to compete, and I’m
pleased to be honored by the Hockey Hall of Fame.”  Gilmour won a Stanley Cup with Nieuwendyk and the Flames in
1989. In a 20-year career with seven teams, the 48-year-old
center scored 450 goals and added 964 assists. Howe, a four-time
All-Star defenseman, played professional hockey for 22 years in
the World Hockey Association and the NHL. He is the son of
another Hall of Fame member, Gordie Howe.  To contact the reporter on this story:
