Square Enix Holdings Co., a
computer-game  software developer , is set for its biggest advance
in more than three month after JPMorgan Chase & Co. raised the
investment rating on the shares to “overweight,” citing an
improved earnings outlook on upcoming title releases.  Tokyo-based Square Enix gained 3.9 percent to 1,397 yen at
the 11 a.m. trading break on the  Tokyo  Stock Exchange, set for
the biggest gain since March 22. JPMorgan increased its rating
on Square Enix to “overweight” from “neutral” and raised the
share-price estimate for May 2012 to 1,750 yen from 1,230 yen.  “We believe the intrinsic value of the company is higher
than denoted by the current share price, given the depth of
intellectual property available,” analysts  Hiroshi Kamide  and
Yusuke Maeda wrote in a report dated June 27. “We expect the
outlook for earnings to improve into fiscal 2012, with a solid
title release schedule overseas.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
