Ivory Coast may reduce export taxes
on  cocoa beans  to boost the income of farmers as part of a
planned reform of the cocoa industry, Nord-Sud reported, citing
Agriculture MinisterMamadou Sangafowa Coulibaly.  Under the plans, farmers will receive at least 50 percent
of the price paid at export, the Abidjan-based newspaper said,
citing Coulibaly.  The Ivory Coastâ€™s government plans to set up a task force
to restructure the cocoa industry following talks with the  World
Bank , Coulibaly said, according to Nord-Sud.  To contact the reporter on this story:
