Chile ’s peso swung between gains and
losses versus the  U.S. dollar  and ended the trading session
little changed as a fluctuating euro countered an increase in
the price of copper, Chile’s main export.  The peso rose less than 0.1 percent to 472.93 per dollar at
1:29 p.m.  New York  time, from 473.02 yesterday. The peso earlier
fell as much as 0.1 percent.  “The peso is waiting for some sort of definition regarding
the situation in Greece, which is putting some pressure on
demand for emerging-market assets,” Raul Lopez, the head
currency trader at Banco Penta, said today in a phone interview
from Santiago.  The euro rose as much as 0.8 percent, after earlier falling
0.4 percent, as Greek lawmakers prepare to vote on austerity
measures needed to prevent a default on the country’s sovereign
debt. It erased losses after the European Central bank’s
President  Jean-Claude Trichet  said policy makers are on a
“strong vigilance mode,” signaling they intend to raise
 interest rates  next week.  Copper, which accounts for half of Chile’s exports, rose as
much as 1.4 percent in New York on speculation that a fall in
crude-oil prices will support growth and boost demand for
industrial metals.  Chile’s central bank paid an average of 473.47 pesos per
U.S. dollar for $50 million as part of a $12 billion effort to
limit the peso’s gains, according to data posted on the bank’s
website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
