The Wimbledon women’s quarterfinal
between Petra Kvitova of the  Czech Republic  and Tsvetana Pironkova of Bulgaria has been delayed by rain.  The match on Court 1 at the All England Club in southwest
 London  was to start at 1 p.m. local time. Rain started falling
about that time, forcing all courts to be covered.  The retractable roof over Centre Court was closed and the
match between Sabine Lisicki of Germany and Marion Bartoli of
France began about 40 minutes later.  “Heavy showers are likely to continue possibly for a
couple of hours,” organizers said in an announcement.  The women’s draw was shaken up yesterday with defending
champion Serena Williams, her sister, Venus -- a five-time
winner -- and top seed  Caroline Wozniacki  of Denmark all losing
in the fourth round.  Dominika Cibulkova of Slovakia meets former champion Maria Sharapova of Russia in the second quarterfinal on Centre Court,
while Tamira Paszek of Austria and  Victoria Azarenka  of Belarus
are scheduled to play the second match on Court 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
