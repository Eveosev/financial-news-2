The  International Criminal Court  has
no jurisdiction in  Libya  as the country never signed or ratified
the treaty that created the body, said Themba Langa, a South
African lawyer representing Libyan leader  Muammar Qaddafi  and
his government.  Qaddafi has immunity as head of state based on
international customary law, Langa said in an e-mailed statement
from Johannesburg today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
