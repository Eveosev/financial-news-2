OAO Inter RAO UES, the Russian
state-controlled electricity exporter, plans to shut off power
supplies to  Belarus  at midnight after the country failed to pay
a debt for previous deliveries by a deadline this morning.  Inter RAO remains in contact with Belarus’s Belenergo
utility and will resume supplies after payment is received, a
press officer for the Moscow-based power company said, declining
to be identified because of corporate policy.  Belenergo was due to pay about 600 million rubles ($21.2
million) under a previous agreement on settling its debt, Inter
RAO Chief Executive Officer Boris Kovalchuk said on June 24.  Inter RAO threatened on June 21 to halt deliveries to
Belarus over non-payment, which was averted when Belarusian
Prime Minister Mikhail Myasnikovich promised to pay the debt.
Belarus, struggling to meet its financing needs, received the
first $800 million tranche on June 21 of a three-year, $3
billion bailout package from the Russian-led Eurasian Economic
Community.  A request for the power cut-off was sent to  Russia ’s OAO
System Operator, the Inter RAO press officer said today by
phone. Belenergo’s press service didn’t immediately answer when
called for comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
