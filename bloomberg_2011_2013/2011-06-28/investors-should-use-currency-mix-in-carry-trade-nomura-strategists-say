Investors should use a mix from
among the dollar, euro, franc and yen to achieve the least
expensive leverage when funding longer-term purchases of assets,
according to Nomura Holdings Inc.  An analysis of carry trades based on based on deposit rates,
economic growth and  interest rates  suggests a portfolio
comprising 50 percent francs, 25 percent dollars, 17 percent yen
and 8 percent euros, Nomura said in a report yesterday. That mix
has had annualized returns of 3.85 percent since 1990 on the
funding side of the trade, the firm said.  Nomura suggested a funding portfolio made up of 50 percent
dollars, 34 percent yen and 16 percent euros because the firm is
“constructive” on the franc, London-based strategists Jennifer Hau, Saeed Amen and Geoffrey Kendrick wrote in the report.  “Using a combination of deposit rates, shift in rate
differentials and macro-based factors can be an effective way of
picking various funding currencies,” the Nomura strategists
wrote. “Even the relatively simple strategy of picking a
funding currency based on the lowest deposit rates outperforms
funding purely in dollars and yen historically.”  The euro gained 0.5 percent today to $1.4362, while the yen
fell 0.4 percent versus the dollar to 81.19. The Swiss franc
touched a record high against the greenback, 82.76 centimes,
before trading at 83.21, up 0.4 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
