U.S. banks are likely to reduce
assets to meet planned  capital requirements  that are akin to an
“antitrust action,” said Richard X. Bove, an analyst at
Rochdale Securities LLC.  “The central bankers want to limit the growth or break up
the western world’s largest banks,” Bove, who is based in Lutz,
 Florida , wrote today in a note to clients. “Once the new
regulations are out, the big banks will shrink.”  Banks deemed too big to fail may be required to hold 2.5
percentage points in additional capital as part of efforts to
prevent another financial crisis, the  Basel Committee on Banking
Supervision  said June 25. That buffer would rise to 3.5
percentage points for lenders that grow even larger, it said.  Banks won’t sell stock to raise capital because they
currently trade below their book value, Bove wrote. The idea
that lenders will retain profits and wait to meet capital
requirements that take full effect in 2019 also “makes no
sense,” in part because other regulations may impede earnings,  “The central bankers have claimed that these targeted
institutions are undercapitalized,” Bove wrote. “This should
impact their cost of borrowing. They cannot wait eight years to
address the problem.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
