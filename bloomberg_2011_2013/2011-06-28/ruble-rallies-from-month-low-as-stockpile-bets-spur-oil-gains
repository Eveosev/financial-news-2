The ruble strengthened against the
dollar, rebounding from a one-month low, as the rally in oil
from the lowest price since February spurred investor confidence
in the world’s biggest energy exporter.  Russia’s currency appreciated 0.5 percent to 28.1925 per
dollar as of 12:06 p.m. in Moscow, after dropping to the weakest
closing level since May 25 yesterday. The ruble was 0.4 percent
weaker at 40.3648 per euro, leaving it little changed at 33.6824
versus the central bank’s target dollar-euro basket. A close at
that level would be the weakest in two months.  Crude prices rose in  New York  on expectations a report
today will show U.S. stockpiles dropped to the lowest in two
months, based on a Bloomberg News survey. Crude for August
delivery gained as much as 80 cents a barrel, and last traded up
0.4 percent at $90.94 per barrel.  Russian  government bonds  advanced, lowering the yield on
dollar debt due in 2015 by 10 basis points to 2.953 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The country’s ruble
Eurobond yielded two basis points less at 9.998 percent.  Non-deliverable forwards, which allow companies to hedge
against currency movements, show the ruble at 28.4825 per dollar
in three months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
