Johnson & Johnson (JNJ)  said it is
recalling more than 60,000 bottles of Tylenol Extra Strength
caplets because of a musty odor that has led the company to
withdraw dozens of other products since last year.  The voluntary recall was prompted by “a small number of
odor reports,”  New Brunswick , New Jersey-based J&J’s McNeil
Consumer Healthcare unit said today in a  statement . While the
risk of serious medical problems is remote, the odor has been
linked to a chemical that can cause “temporary and non-serious
gastrointestinal symptoms,” the company said.  J&J, the world’s second-largest maker of health-care
products, has pulled millions of packages of over-the-counter
drugs since last year because of the chemical known as 2,4,6
tribromoanisole, used to treat wooden shipping and storage
pallets. The company pulled 40,000 bottles of Risperdal, a
schizophrenia drug, on June 17 because of the chemical’s musty
odor, which also led the company to recall shipments of the HIV
drug Prezista and the seizure medicine Topamax this year.  The 60,912 bottles of Tylenol recalled today make up one
lot of the product and were manufactured in February 2009, J&J
said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
