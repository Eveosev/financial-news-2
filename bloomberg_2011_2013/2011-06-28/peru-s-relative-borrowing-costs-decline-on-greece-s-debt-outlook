Peru’s benchmark borrowing costs in
dollars fell to a one-month low as U.S. Treasuries declined on
speculation  Greece ’s lawmakers will approve austerity measures
to assure a financial bailout and avoid a default.  The extra yield investors demand to own Peruvian  government
bonds  instead of U.S. Treasuries fell 10 basis points, or 0.1
percentage point, to 181 at 4:36 p.m. New York time, according
to JPMorgan Chase & Co.  Greek lawmakers vote tomorrow on a five-year plan of budget
cuts and asset sales that’s needed before the nation can tap a
fifth loan payment from last year’s 110 billion euro ($158
billion) rescue. Failure to pass the government’s 78 billion
euro plan may lead to the euro area’s first sovereign default.  “The market is 100 percent pricing in the passage of the
austerity package,” said Kathryn Rooney Vera, an emerging
markets analyst at Bulltick Capital Markets in Miami. “The
global picture is slightly more positive so there’s less  risk
aversion .”  The sol strengthened 0.1 percent to 2.7535 per  U.S. dollar ,
from 2.7571 yesterday.  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-
denominated bond due August 2020 was little changed at 6.36
percent, according to prices compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
