Treasury notes declined before
today’s $35 billion auction of five-year securities on
speculation  Greece ’s lawmakers will approve austerity measures
to assure a financial bailout.  Benchmark 10-year debt pared a monthly gain on reduced
concern  Europe ’s sovereign-debt crisis will undermine the global
economic recovery. A record low yield at yesterday’s auction of
two-year notes drew the lowest demand in more than three years
from an investor class that includes foreign central banks.  “The market is hanging on every statement for the next
couple of days until this vote takes place,” said James Combias, head of Treasury trading in New York at Mizuho
Securities USA Inc., one of 20 primary dealers that trade with
the  Federal Reserve . “We expect the market to be volatile until
we get clear direction stemming from Greece. The market will
have to make room for the supply coming. It would make sense
that they would have to cheapen up the market.”  Yields on current five-year notes increased seven basis
points, or 0.07 percentage point, to 1.52 percent at 11:25 a.m.
in  New York , according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 1.75
percent securities maturing in May 2016 dropped 10/32, or $3.13
per $1,000 face amount, to 101 3/32.  The 10-year note yields increased five basis points to 2.98
percent after falling yesterday to 2.84 percent, the lowest
level since Dec. 1. The yields have fallen nine basis points in
June in what would be a third monthly decrease. Two-year note
yields gained three basis points to 0.45 percent today, while
30-year bond yields were little changed at 4.29 percent.  Long Bonds  Thirty-year bonds were the worst-performing Treasuries
yesterday, increasing 11 basis points, the most since Jan. 5.
The difference, or spread, between two- and 30-year yields
widened yesterday to 3.91 percentage points, the most in three
months, before narrowing to 3.86 percentage points today.  Two-year notes have returned 0.2 percent this month,
compared with 1.3 percent for five-year debt, 1.3 percent for
10-year securities and a 0.8 percent loss for 30-year bonds,
according to indexes compiled by Bank of America Merrill Lynch.  The five-year Treasury notes being auctioned today yielded
1.535 percent in pre-auction trading, versus 1.813 percent at
the prior sale on May 25. Investors bid for 3.20 times the
amount offered last month, more than the average of 2.83 for the
past 10 auctions.  “Fives have gotten really rich,” said  David Ader , head of
government bond strategy at CRT Capital Group LLC in  Stamford ,
 Connecticut . “We can get an auction concession.”  Indirect Bidders  Indirect bidders, the investor class that includes foreign
central banks, bought 47.1 percent of the notes in May, versus
the 10-sale average of 41.6 percent. Direct bidders, non-primary
dealer investors that place their bids directly with the
Treasury, purchased 8.9 percent, the lowest in three months.  At yesterday’s $35 billion two-year note auction, indirect
bidders purchased 22 percent of the securities, the lowest since
February 2008. The government will conclude this week’s note
sales with tomorrow’s $29 billion offering of seven-year debt.  Traders are betting the Fed will postpone raising borrowing
costs from record lows to support the economy. The odds of a
rate increase by April 2012 dropped to 28 percent, from 34
percent a month ago, futures contracts indicate. The central
bank cut the target to a range of zero to 0.25 percent in 2008
and has promised to keep it low for an “extended period.”  Home Prices  Drop  Home prices decreased in the year ended April by the most
in 17 months, showing the housing market remains an obstacle for
the U.S. recovery.  The S&P/Case-Shiller index of property values in 20 cities
fell 4 percent from April 2010, the biggest drop since November
2009, the group said today in New York.  Confidence among U.S. consumers unexpectedly fell in June
to a seven-month low, the Conference Board reported. The New
York research group’s index decreased to 58.5 from a revised
61.7 reading in May that was higher than previously estimated.
The percentage of respondents expecting an increase in job
availability fell to the lowest in 11 months.  The Fed bought $4.62 billion of Treasuries due from August
2018 to May 2021 today as part of its $600 billion program of
debt buying expiring this week.  In Greece, unions began their fourth general strike of the
year, protesting Prime Minister  George Papandreou ’s five-year
plan of budget cuts and asset sales. Police estimated about
12,000 people joined rallies and marches to Parliament in  Athens 
on the first day of the 48-hour walkout.  Lawmakers vote tomorrow on the package that’s needed before
the cash-strapped nation can tap a fifth loan payment from last
year’s 110 billion-euro ($157 billion) rescue. Failure to pass
the government’s 78 billion-euro plan may lead to the euro
area’s first sovereign default.  To contact the reporter on this story:
