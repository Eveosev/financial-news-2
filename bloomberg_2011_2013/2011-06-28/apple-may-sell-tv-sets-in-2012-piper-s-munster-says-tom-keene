Apple Inc. (AAPL) , whose top-selling
product is the iPhone, may sell television sets in 2012,
according to  Gene Munster  of Piper Jaffray Cos.  Chief Executive Officer  Steve Jobs  has had limited success
selling Apple TV, a set-top box introduced in 2007 that attaches
to an existing TV set and enables consumers to rent movies.
As recently as September, Jobs called the product a hobby.  “What Apple does really well is put everything into one
box,” Munster, an analyst at Piper Jaffray in  Minneapolis , said
in a radio interview on “Bloomberg Surveillance” with Tom Keene and Ken Prewitt. “People are much more willing to pay
$1,200 for something Apple puts together that’s all nice and
neat than go try and tie it all together themselves.”  The Cupertino, California, company has many patents related
to TV technology and believes a 25- by 50-inch TV would be well
received, according to Munster. Patents signaled the coming of
the iPad tablet PC, he said.  Apple increased 1 percent to $335.33 at 12:27 p.m. in
Nasdaq Stock Market trading. The shares have risen 3.9 percent
this year.  The iPhone 5 will likely be released in September, the new
iPod portable media player will be released in time for the
back-to-school season, and a new MacBook Air laptop will be
available in the next few weeks, according to Munster.  To contact the reporters on this story:
