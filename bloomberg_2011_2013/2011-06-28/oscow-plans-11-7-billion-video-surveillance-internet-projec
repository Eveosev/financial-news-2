The Moscow city government plans to
expand video surveillance and offer residents more services
through the Internet in the next five years in a project worth
329.5 billion rubles ($11.7 billion).  Video cameras will be installed in 95 percent of apartment
buildings and 75 percent of infrastructure in the Russian
capital by 2016,  City Hall  said today in e-mailed materials
before its weekly meeting. It also plans to provide all
government services electronically.  President  Dmitry Medvedev  is keen to develop an
“innovative” economy and has urged governments at all levels to
switch to paperless services. Russia ranked 59th in a 2010
United Nations  survey  of world e-government readiness, one place
below  Saudi Arabia  and one above Montenegro.  Moscow will finance 60 percent of the project, City Hall
said, without specifying the source of the remaining funds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
