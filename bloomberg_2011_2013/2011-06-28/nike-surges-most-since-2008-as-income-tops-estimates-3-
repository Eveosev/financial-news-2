Nike Inc. (NKE) , the world’s largest
sporting-goods company, rose the most in more than two years
after posting fourth-quarter profit that surpassed analysts’
estimates and increasing its long-term sales forecast.  Nike jumped $8.28, or 10 percent, to $89.90 at 4 p.m. in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading for the largest
advance since October 2008.  Net income rose 14 percent to $594 million, or $1.24 a
share, in the quarter ended May 31, from about $522 million, or
$1.06, a year earlier, Beaverton, Oregon-based Nike said
yesterday in a statement. Analysts projected $1.17 a share, the
average of 15 estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Nike has boosted sales and cut marketing costs from a year
earlier, when the company promoted around the  World Cup . Chief
Executive Officer Mark Parker has raised prices to combat rising
costs for cotton, labor and transportation.  Sales will grow to as much as $30 billion by the end of
fiscal year 2015, Parker said today on a webcast presentation to
analysts. The company in May 2010 projected revenue of $27
billion in the same period. As much as $2 billion of the
increased forecast may come from the Nike brand, the company
said. Nike’s sales in fiscal 2011 gained 9.7 percent to $20.9
billion.  Orders for the Nike brand from June to November increased
12 percent, excluding currency fluctuations. That topped the
average estimate of five analysts for a gain of 9.4 percent.  Total revenue in the fourth quarter rose 14 percent to
$5.77 billion. Analysts projected $5.54 billion, the average of
13 estimates. Sales in  North America , Nike’s largest market,
advanced 22 percent to $2.1 billion, led by the running
category.  To contact the reporter on this story:
