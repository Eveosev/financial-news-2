Transnet SOC Ltd., the state-owned
South African ports and rail operator, is in talks with the
Public Investment Corp. about buying back its most expensive
bond, Business Day said, citing Chief Executive Officer Brian
Molefe.  Transnet could save interest payments of 20 million rand a
month on the 6 billion rand bond, which was placed with the PIC
in 2007, the Johannesburg-based newspaper said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
