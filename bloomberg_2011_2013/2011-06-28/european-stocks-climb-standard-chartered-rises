Most European stocks gained as Greek
Prime Minister  George Papandreou  called on his country’s
lawmakers to back tougher austerity measures. Asian shares
advanced and U.S. futures were little changed.  Standard Chartered Plc rose 1.4 percent after the U.K.’s
third-largest bank by market value said first-half profit before
taxes may post “double-digit” growth from a year earlier.
Prudential Plc climbed 1.9 percent after Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. upgraded the U.K.’s largest insurer to “buy.” TomTom NV
plunged 27 percent after cutting full-year profit and sales
forecasts as U.S. demand for its devices declined.  The benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 Index advanced 0.2 percent
to 264.42 at 9:57 a.m. in  London  as more than three stocks rose
for every two that fell. Since its peak this year on Feb. 17,
the gauge has still tumbled 9.2 percent as investors speculated
that  Greece  will fail to repay all its debt. The retreat has
left the measure trading at the cheapest valuation compared with
reported profits since 2008, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
