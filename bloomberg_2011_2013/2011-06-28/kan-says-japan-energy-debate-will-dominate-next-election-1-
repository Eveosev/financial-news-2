Japan’s Prime Minister  Naoto Kan 
said the debate over  energy policy  following the Fukushima
nuclear crisis will be the focus of the nation’s next
parliamentary election.  “We’ve started debating a sweeping review of our basic
energy policy,” Kan told fellow lawmakers from the ruling
 Democratic Party of Japan  today in Tokyo. “The direction of our
energy policy will probably be the biggest agenda item in the
next national election.”  Kan reiterated today his intention to seek parliamentary
approval for a second disaster recovery package, authorizing the
sale of deficit-covering bonds and enacting a renewable energy
bill, as he faces pressure from both the opposition and his own
party to step down over his handling of the March 11 earthquake
and tsunami. The current term for the lower house of parliament
is scheduled to last until the second half of 2013.  Ben Hashimoto, a first-term lower house lawmaker, said he
was concerned Kan may dissolve the lower chamber and call an
election, and asked  Democratic Party  leaders not to take such a
step.  “Holding an election at this time would be unthinkable
under normal circumstances, but unusual things have been
happening lately,” said  Yasunori Sone , a political science
professor at Keio University in Tokyo. “Dissolution could
happen.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
