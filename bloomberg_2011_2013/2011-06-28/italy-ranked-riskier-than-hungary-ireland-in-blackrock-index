Italy  ranked worse than Hungary and
Ireland in a new index from New York-based money manager
 BlackRock Inc. (BLK)  that gauges the risk of sovereign defaults.  Greece and Portugal, whose debt levels were called
“unsustainable” by BlackRock, came in last among 44 countries,
the company said in a study published yesterday. The BlackRock
Sovereign Risk Index ranks debt issuers on the likelihood of
default, devaluation or above-trend inflation.  Greek lawmakers approved today the first part of an
austerity package crucial for securing international aid and
avoiding the euro-area’s first sovereign default. The vote came
amid a 48-hour strike and scuffles outside parliament that saw
police fire tear gas at crowds of protesters that swelled to
more than 20,000.  Italy’s net debt is higher than that of Ireland and  Hungary 
as a percentage of gross domestic product, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Italy’s debt, which exceeds GDP, “is
extremely high for a country with its fundamentals and term
structure,” BlackRock said in the report. The government must
roll over debt equal to 43 percent of GDP in the next two years,
it said.  The U.S. ranked 15th in the BlackRock index, just below
 China . Norway, Sweden and Switzerland were judged the safest
issuers. Rated lowest after Greece and Portugal were Venezuela,
Egypt, Italy, Hungary, Ireland, Argentina,  Spain  and Turkey.  BlackRock, which manages $3.65 trillion in assets, is the
world’s largest money manager.  To contact the reporter on this story:
