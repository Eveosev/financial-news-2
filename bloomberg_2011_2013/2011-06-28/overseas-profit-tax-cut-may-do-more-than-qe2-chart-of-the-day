Giving companies a tax break on
transfers of overseas profits may pack a bigger economic punch
than bond buying by the  Federal Reserve , according to Thomas J. Lee, JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s chief U.S. equity strategist.  Earnings that U.S. companies retain outside their home
country total at least $1.4 trillion and are rising by more than
10 percent a year, Lee wrote yesterday in a report. The data
were compiled by JPMorgan from annual filings by 883 companies.  As the CHART OF THE DAY illustrates, domestic companies
count on business outside the U.S. for a growing percentage of
their profits as well. The first-quarter figure was 25 percent,
up from 16 percent five years earlier.  Companies may bring home as much as $1 trillion for stock
buybacks, dividends, hiring and other reasons if a plan to cut
the  tax rate  on overseas earnings temporarily becomes law, Lee
wrote. The Fed’s second round of quantitative easing, due for
completion this week, totaled $600 billion.  Senator Charles Schumer of New York signaled last week that
Democrats might back a proposal to trim the levy to 5.25 percent
from 35 percent. A similar move in 2004 produced $362 billion of
inflows, Lee’s report said.  Technology companies are among those with the most money
available to transfer back home. Overseas cash balances of the
industry’s largest companies may double in the next two years,
according to Moody’s Investors Service. The estimate was made
yesterday and covers  Google Inc. (GOOG) ,  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)  and others
with investment-grade credit ratings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
