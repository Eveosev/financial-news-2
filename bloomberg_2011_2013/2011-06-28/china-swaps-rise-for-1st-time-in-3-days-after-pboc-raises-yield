China ’s interest-rate swaps rose for
the first time in three days after the central bank lifted the
yield on one-year bills for a second week, spurring speculation
policy makers will raise borrowing costs.  The People’s Bank of China sold one-year bills at a yield
of 3.4982 percent today, compared with 3.4019 percent at the
last sale on June 21, according to a statement on its website.
The monetary authority issued 2 billion yuan ($309 million) of
the securities and didn’t offer any  repurchase agreements  in the
auction today.  “Investors have been worried the central bank will raise
 interest rates  in the near term, and the increase in bill yields
worsened such expectations,” said Guo Caomin, a bond analyst at
Industrial Bank Co. in  Shanghai . The benchmark one-year lending
rate may be lifted next month, he said.  The one-year swap contract, the fixed cost needed to
receive the floating seven-day repurchase rate, gained three
basis points to 3.77 percent as of 5:08 p.m. in Shanghai,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It has risen 30 basis
points in June, set for the biggest monthly increase since
January.  Consumer prices climbed 5.5 percent in May from a year
earlier, the most since July 2008, the statistics bureau said on
June 14. China will find it difficult to meet its official
inflation target of 4 percent this year, Chinese Premier  Wen Jiabao  said, according to a Radio Television Hong Kong report
yesterday.  The seven-day repurchase rate, which measures interbank
funding availability, declined 61 basis points to 6.63 percent,
according to a weighted average rate compiled by the National
Interbank Funding Center.  The yield on the 2.77 percent government bond due May 2012
rose four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 3.45
percent, according to the Interbank Funding Center.  -- Judy Chen . Editors: Andrew Janes, Simon Harvey  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
