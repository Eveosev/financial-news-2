LinkedIn Corp., the biggest
professional-networking website, jumped 11 percent in New York
trading after Bank of America Corp., JPMorgan Chase & Co.,
Morgan Stanley and UBS AG began coverage of the stock.  LinkedIn rose $8.31 to $84.69 at 2:27 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. The stock climbed as high as
$86.50 earlier in the session.  The company’s initial public offering last month helped
open the floodgates to a wave of technology IPOs, making for the
biggest year in new Internet stocks since the dot-com bubble
burst in 2000. LinkedIn’s large membership and fast growth make
it an attractive company, Brian Pitz, a New York-based analyst
at UBS, said today in a research note.  “LinkedIn could transform the hiring industry through
viral growth of its already massive, socially connected
platform,” Pitz wrote. “The size and attractive demographics
of the users are a primary, fundamental competitive advantage
for the company and it represents a significant barrier to entry
for the competition.”  LinkedIn’s top underwriters -- Bank of America, JPMorgan
and Morgan Stanley -- all initiated coverage of the stock with
positive ratings today.  JPMorgan predicts that the shares will climb to $85 in the
next 18 months, while Bank of America has a price target of $92.
Morgan Stanley projects $88. UBS, which also assigned a “buy”
rating, expects the stock to increase to $90.  Today’s gains add to the stock’s 9.2 percent jump
yesterday, marking the biggest two-day increase since the week
of its debut.  To contact the reporter on this story:
