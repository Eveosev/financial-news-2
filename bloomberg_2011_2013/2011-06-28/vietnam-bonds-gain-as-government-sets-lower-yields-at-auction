Vietnam ’s bonds advanced for a
second day as demand increased in the secondary market after the
government offered lower yields at a 2 trillion dong ($97
million) auction of five-year notes.  The debt was sold at 12.1 percent on June 23 down from 12.3
percent and 12.65 percent at the previous sales on June 16 and
June 9, according to the  Hanoi Stock Exchange . The yield on the
benchmark five-year note dropped four basis points, or 0.04
percentage point, to a one-week low of 12.50 percent today,
according to a daily fixing from banks compiled by Bloomberg.  “Lower  interest rates  the government offered at bond
auctions have dragged yields down,” said Do Hoang Quynh Trang,
a fixed-income trader at Hanoi-based Ocean Commercial Joint-
Stock Bank.  The dong weakened 0.1 percent to 20,610 per dollar as of 4
p.m. in Hanoi, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
central bank fixed the reference rate at 20,623, compared with
20,618 yesterday, according to its website. The currency is
allowed to trade up to 1 percent on either side of the rate.  --Nguyen Dieu Tu Uyen. Editors: Simon Harvey  To contact the reporter on this story:
