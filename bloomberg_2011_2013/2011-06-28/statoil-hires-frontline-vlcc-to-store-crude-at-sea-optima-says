Statoil ASA (STL) ,  Norway ’s biggest oil
and gas producer, booked a supertanker to store crude at sea,
Optima Shipbrokers Ltd. said.  Statoil hired a very large crude carrier owned by Frontline
Ltd., the world’s largest supertanker operator, at a daily cost
of $32,000 for a period of 30 to 40 days, Optima said in a
report e-mailed today. Jannik Lindbaek, vice president of media
relations for Stavanger, Norway-based Statoil, declined to
comment when telephoned by Bloomberg.  Crude fell for a fourth week last week in New York trading,
increasing the incentive to store cargoes at sea, after the
 International Energy Agency  announced it was adding 60 million
barrels to global supplies. A VLCC can hold 2 million barrels of
oil.  To contact the reporter on this story:
