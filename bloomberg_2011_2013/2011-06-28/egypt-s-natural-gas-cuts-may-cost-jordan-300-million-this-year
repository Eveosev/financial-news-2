The cuts in Egyptian natural-gas
deliveries twice this year because of sabotage attacks will cost
 Jordan  a total of $300 million, or 1 percent of gross domestic
product, analysts at Citigroup said.  Power plants  in Jordan were forced to switch to more
expensive fuels after the attacks in February and again on April
27 disrupted gas exports from Egypt.  More than 75 percent of Jordanian electricity is generated
from Egyptian gas, which is subsidized by the government through
a fixed tariff schedule for domestic consumption, it said in an
e-mailed statement.  The Jordanian government’s electricity subsidy is likely to
double in 2011, “given the disruption in supplies of Egyptian
gas earlier in the year, and the need for Jordan to switch to
higher-cost alternatives for generation, mainly oil and
diesel,” it said.  Egypt’s gas deliveries decreased from 310 million cubic
feet a day in 2009 to 210 million cubic feet a day before
dropping further after the sabotage attacks this year.  Egypt  and Jordan agreed to raise the price of natural-gas
shipments to $4 per million thermal units from $1.50, Cairo-
based  Al Masry Al Youm  newspaper reported June 21, citing
unidentified Egyptian Oil Ministry officials.  “This represents a gain of almost $200 million per year to
Egypt,” according to the Citigroup report. “The flip-side,
naturally, is that this represents an equal loss to Jordan.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
