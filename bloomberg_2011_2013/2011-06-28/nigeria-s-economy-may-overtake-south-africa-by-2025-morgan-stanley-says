Nigeria ’s economy may overtake South
Africa’s by 2025 to become the biggest on the continent as oil
prices climb and  consumer spending  in Africa’s most populous
nation expands, Morgan Stanley said.  Gross domestic product, which will probably reach $400
billion by the end of the decade, is forecast to increase 8.4
percent in 2011 and 8.5 percent in 2012, Andrea Masia and
Michael Kafe, economists at Morgan Stanley in Johannesburg,
wrote in an e-mailed report today.  Crude output in Africa’s biggest oil producer is estimated
to climb 9.5 percent to 2.3 million barrels a day by 2012 from
last year, while oil prices may average $113 a barrel over the
next year,  Morgan Stanley (MS)  said. Rising wages and an increase in
borrowing is also helping to boost consumer spending in a
country of 150 million people, the bank said.  “The sources of output growth are broadening and
accelerating, retail trade is vibrant and its financial markets
are deepening,” Masia and Kafe wrote. “The economy is on a
growth charge.”  Nigeria’s economy is forecast to climb to about $400
billion by 2016 from $268 billion this year, while South
Africa’s is expected to reach more than $500 billion from $383
billion in the same period, according to the International
Monetary Fund.  Economic Boom  South Africa’s central bank expects economic growth of 3.6
percent in 2011 and 3.9 percent in 2012.  Nigeria’s economic boom may push the market value of the
equity index to $1 trillion in five years time from $74 billion
currently, Oscar Onyema, chief executive officer of the Nigerian
Stock Exchange, said today.  South Africa ’s bourse has a market
value of $494 billion.  Minimum wages in Nigeria more than doubled to 18,000 naira
($114.69) a month before elections in April after remaining
unchanged at about 7,500 naira since 2000, Morgan Stanley said.
Public-sector wages are budgeted to rise 20 percent in 2011 and
10 percent in 2012, helping to spur consumer spending, it said.  The naira, which may strengthen to 153 against the dollar
by year-end and 150 by the end of 2012, “should help to lift
consumer confidence and support the retail sector,” Morgan
Stanley said. The wholesale and retail trade industry accounted
for 19 percent of GDP in 2010, higher than oil, which makes up
15 percent, the bank said.  Morgan Stanley recommends investors buy shares in  Guinness
Nigeria Plc (GUINNESS) ,  Nestle Foods Nigeria Plc (NESTLE) ,  Diamond Bank Plc (DIAMONDB)  and
 Guaranty Trust Bank Plc. (GUARANTY)   To contact the reporter on this story:
