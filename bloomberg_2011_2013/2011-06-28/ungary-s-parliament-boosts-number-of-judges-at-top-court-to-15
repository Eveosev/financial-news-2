Hungary’s Parliament voted to boost
the number of  Constitutional Court  judges to 15 from 11 as of
Sept. 1, according to vote results posted on the parliament’s
 website  yesterday.  Currently, there are 10 sitting judges, with one vacancy.
The five new judges confirmed by the legislative body were all
nominees of Prime Minister  Viktor Orban ’s coalition.  Orban’s lawmakers last year stripped the Constitutional
Court of its authority to rule on most tax and budget matters
after it voided a retroactive tax on severance payment for
government workers. Judges retained the right to invalidate tax
and budget measures if they violate human dignity.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
