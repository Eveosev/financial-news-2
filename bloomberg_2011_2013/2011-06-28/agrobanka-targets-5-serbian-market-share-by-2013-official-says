Agrobanka AD Beograd (AGBN)  aims to boost
its market share in  Serbia  to 5 percent by 2013 as part of a
five-year plan to grow its business, executive board member
Bojan Zaric said.  The bank ended 2010 with a market share of 2.9 percent
measured by total assets and grew to 3.1 percent in the first
five months of this year.  “We have two more years to achieve the 5 percent goal,”
Zaric said in an interview at a conference organized today by
the Belgrade Stock Exchange.  The bank, which ranked 12 among 33 banks operating in the
Balkan country in 2010, wants to expand its reach outside Serbia
and offer services to Serbian expatriates, including offices of
the Serbian Chamber of Commerce, the Serbian Orthodox Church and
businesses operating outside the country, Zaric said.  The bank’s market capitalization stood at 54.9 million
euros ($78.3 million) as of June 24 and aims to increase net
income this year to 15 million euros from 11.3 million euros in
2010.  Non-performing loans accounted for 15 percent of its
portfolio compared with an average of 17.1 percent for the
entire banking industry, while its capital adequacy ratio was
19.85 percent, less than the average of 22.1 percent.  “Our results for the first half of 2011 are not yet
available, but for January-May the results are already better
than our semi-annual plan,” Zaric said.  Agrobanka, which is 20.1 percent owned by the state, may
see a further increase in the state’s share “in a month or so”
after it settles old debts with the state, he said.  The bank in August 2007 turned debt of 43.5 million euros
owed to the  World Bank  into state-owned equity and agreed with
the government to buy back the stake if the government fails to
sell its shares at a price of 40,600 dinars ($567) per share
within three years. The hoped-for price is almost four times its
present market value.  “Talks are under way with the government,” Zaric said,
adding that as a result, the state-owned stake could expand by
“between 6 and 10 percent.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
