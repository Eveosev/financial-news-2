Christine Lagarde  was named the new
head of the International Monetary Fund, the organization said
in an e-mailed statement in Washington today.  Lagarde, 55, is currently the finance minister of France.
She will replace  Dominique Strauss-Kahn , who resigned last month
after his arrest in New York on charges that included attempted
rape.  The five-year term for Lagarde will begin on July 5, the
IMF said. She will become the first woman to serve as managing
director of the Washington-based lender.  “I would like to thank the Fund’s global membership warmly
for the broad-based support I have received,” Lagarde said in
an e-mailed statement. “I will make it my overriding goal that
our institution continues to serve its entire membership with
the same focus and the same spirit” as it did during the global
economic crisis, she said.  The IMF board said in its statement that it “looks forward
to Ms. Lagarde effectively leading” the organization.  To contact the reporter on this story:
