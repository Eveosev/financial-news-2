India ’s 10-year bonds declined a
second day on concern inflation will accelerate after fuel
prices were raised.  Refiners including Indian Oil Corp., the nation’s biggest,
increased diesel prices by 3 rupees (7 cents) a liter, kerosene
by 2 rupees a liter and cooking gas by 50 rupees for every 14.2
kilogram bottle on June 24. The government borrowed 60 billion
rupees selling 35-day cash management bills today, the central
bank said in a statement.  “The fuel price increase will definitely push up inflation
and that’s damping appetite for debt,” said  Paresh Nayar , the
Mumbai-based head of money markets and currency at FirstRand Ltd.
“The bill sale is also a temporary negative from the point of
view of liquidity.”  The yield on the 7.8 percent bond due April 2021 rose two
basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 8.28 percent as of
the 5 p.m. close in Mumbai, according to the central bank’s
trading system.  The wholesale-price index, the main inflation gauge, rose
9.06 percent in May from a year earlier, compared with 8.66
percent in April, according to data published June 14. Wholesale
prices will increase by more than 10 percent in July from a year
earlier due to the fuel-price rise, Nomura Holdings Inc. Mumbai-
based economists Sonal Varma and Aman Mohunta wrote in a note to
clients yesterday.  The cost of one-year interest-rate swaps, or derivative
contracts used to guard against fluctuations in borrowing costs,
rose six basis points to 8.03 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
