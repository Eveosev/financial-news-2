PlayCore Inc., the designer and
maker of playground equipment, has increased the size of its
first-lien  term loan  to $105 million and eliminated a second-
lien loan, according to a person with knowledge of the request.  The company owned by Irving Place Capital hasn’t changed
the size of a $20 million revolving line of credit, said the
person, who declined to be identified because the terms haven’t
been announced publicly.  The interest rate Chattanooga, Tennessee-based PlayCore
will pay lenders remains at 4.5 percentage points more than the
London interbank offered rate with a 1.5 percent floor on the
benchmark, the person said. The loan will be sold at 99 cents on
the dollar.  Lenders had to recommit yesterday to BNP Paribas SA, the
bank arranging the financing, which will close June 30, the
person said.  The financing initially consisted of a $95 million first-
lien term loan and a $35 million second-lien term loan, the
person said.  In a revolving credit facility, money can be borrowed again
once it’s repaid; in a term loan, it can’t.  Patricia Grad, head of  investor relations  at Irving Place,
didn’t immediately return a telephone call seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
