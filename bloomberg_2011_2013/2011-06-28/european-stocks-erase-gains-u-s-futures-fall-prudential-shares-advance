European stocks erased gains as
Greek Prime Minister  George Papandreou  called on his country’s
lawmakers to back tougher austerity measures. Asian shares
advanced and U.S. futures dropped.  TomTom NV plunged 29 percent after cutting full-year profit
and sales forecasts as U.S. demand for its devices declined.
Standard Chartered Plc rose 1.6 percent after the U.K.’s third-
largest bank by market value said first-half profit before taxes
may post “double-digit” growth from a year earlier. Prudential
Plc climbed 1.8 percent after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. upgraded
the U.K.’s largest insurer to “buy.”  The benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 Index slid 0.1 percent to
263.67 at 10:17 a.m. in  London . Since its peak this year on Feb.
17, the gauge has still tumbled 9.4 percent as investors
speculated that  Greece  will fail to repay all its debt. The
retreat has left the measure trading at the cheapest valuation
compared with reported profits since 2008, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
