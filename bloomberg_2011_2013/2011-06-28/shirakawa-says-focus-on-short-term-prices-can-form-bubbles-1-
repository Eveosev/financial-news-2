Bank of Japan  Governor Masaaki Shirakawa said monetary policy conducted to address immediate
inflation trends can cause bubbles and central banks need to
make decisions bearing in mind their long-term effects.  “If a central bank maintains a low interest rate
environment with too much focus on the near-term inflation
outlook, this could consequently encourage the formation of
financial bubbles,” Shirakawa said in Holland yesterday,
according to remarks  published  on the BOJ’s website today.
Policy makers “should pursue  price stability  through the
conduct of monetary policy with a sufficiently long time
horizon,” he said.  The  Bank for International Settlements  warned on June 26
that central banks may have to raise rates to control inflation
at a faster pace than in the past. Borrowing costs in the
world’s largest developed nations are near record lows as
central banks in the U.S. and  Japan  have pledged to keep
accommodative policies to support their economies.  Imbalances created during credit bubbles ranging from
asset-price inflation to increased leveraging are in part driven
by expectations that  interest rates  will remain low for a long
time, Shirakawa said.  The governor has repeatedly highlighted the side-effects of
accommodative policy, drawing from lessons of the collapse of
Japan’s asset bubble in the 1990s that triggered more than a
decade of economic stagnation. The BOJ has kept rates near zero
and is buying assets ranging from corporate debt to real-estate
investment trusts to beat deflation and spur growth in the
world’s third-largest economy.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
