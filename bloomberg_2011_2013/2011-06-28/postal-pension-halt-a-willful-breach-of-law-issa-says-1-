The U.S. Postal Service’s suspension
of contributions to an employee pension plan is a “willful
violation of the law,” the chairman of the U.S. House committee
overseeing the service said.  The Postal Service’s decision last week to halt payments to
the Federal Employees Retirement System, which covers about 85
percent of career postal workers, “sets a dangerous
precedent,” Representative  Darrell Issa , the California
Republican who is chairman of the House Oversight and Government
Reform Committee, said in a letter yesterday to the U.S. Office
of Personnel Management.  “It is troubling that OPM would allow the lapse in
payments pending further review by the executive branch,” Issa
said in the letter to OPM Director John Berry. “Attempting to
preserve cash by missing required payments” violates the law,
he said.  The Postal Service has said it will reach its $15 billion
statutory borrowing limit by the end of its fiscal year on Sept.
30, following a fiscal 2010 loss of $8.5 billion. It has said it
needed to suspend the pension contributions to save $800 million
this year.  A  Postal Service  spokesman had no immediate comment. A OPM
spokeswoman didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
