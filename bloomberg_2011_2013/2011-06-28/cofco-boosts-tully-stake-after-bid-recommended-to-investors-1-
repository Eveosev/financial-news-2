Cofco Ltd.,  China ’s largest grain
trader, increased its stake in Tully Sugar Ltd. after the
Australian company recommended shareholders accept the Chinese
company’s A$136 million ($142 million) takeover bid.  Cofco, which owns 26.58 percent of Tully, doesn’t intend to
increase its offer or extend the July 5 acceptance deadline, the
Beijing-based company said today in a statement. Cofco received
strong interest from shareholders seeking to accept the offer
after July 1, according to the statement.  The company is seeking to purchase the Tully sugar mill in
Queensland to meet demand in the world’s most populous nation.
Tully recommended shareholders accept Cofco’s A$44 a share offer
over bids from  Bunge Ltd. (BG) , the world’s second-largest sugar
trader, and Mackay Sugar Ltd., an Australian agricultural co-
operative backed by Louis Dreyfus Commodities.  “We are offering financial security as well as a
commitment to keep the head office in the region and ensure that
the decision-making stays local,” Pan Honghuan, deputy general
manager of Cofco’s Top Glory ( Australia ) Pty Ltd. unit, said in
the statement.  Closely-held Tully handles more than 90 percent of raw-
sugar exports through agreements with mills in Australia, the
world’s third-biggest shipper of the sweetener.  To contact the reporter for this story:
