Wai Ho Leong, senior regional
economist at  Barclays Capital  in Singapore, writes on the
outlook for the South Korean won in a research note released
today after the nation’s current-account surplus widened to a
seven-month high. He forecasts the won will strengthen 5.4
percent to 1,025 per dollar in 12 months.  The current-account surplus is “providing support for the
won. At the same time, we expect increased tolerance for a
stronger won to rein in imported price pressures, which are
likely to remain elevated in Asia.  “The emergence of a dry spell across Asia and Europe,
coupled with the closure of nuclear  power plants  in Japan, could
stoke the rise in food and energy prices in the second half of
the year. The  Bank of Korea  has explicitly indicated that
currency strength has helped offset the rising cost of imported
goods in recent months.”  The won is “one of the most fundamentally undervalued in
currencies in Asia,” Leong wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
