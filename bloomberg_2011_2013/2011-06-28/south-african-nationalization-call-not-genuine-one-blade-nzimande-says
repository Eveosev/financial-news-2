A call to nationalize South African
mines made by the African National Congress Youth League isn’t a
“genuine” one, Blade Nzimande, head of the  South African
Communist Party , said.  The league, led by Julius Malema, wants the state to buy
indebted mining companies owned by black investors, Nzimande
said in a speech to labor union officials in Johannesburg today.
Some league members are benefiting from state contracts,
Nzimande, who is also Minister of Higher Education, said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
