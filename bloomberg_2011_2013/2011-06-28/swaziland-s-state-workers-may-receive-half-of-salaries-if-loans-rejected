Swaziland may need to cut state
workers wages by half if requests for loans are rejected, Times
of Swaziland reported, citing Finance Minister Majozi Sithole.  Sithole told lawmakers Swazis need to come to terms with
the fact that the government didn’t have enough money for pay
employees, the Mbabane-based newspaper cited Sithole as saying.  The  African Development Bank  had rejected a loan request
because the country’s hasn’t met conditions including reducing
state worker pay, and the  International Monetary Fund  had
demanded that wages be cut, the Times said. The government has
also asked South Africa a loan and will consider approaching
Asian countries for help, it said, citing Sithole.  To contact the reporter on this story:
