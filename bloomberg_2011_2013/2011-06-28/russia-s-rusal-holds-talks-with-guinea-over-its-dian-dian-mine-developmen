United Co. Rusal, the world’s
largest aluminum producer, said it’s in talks with the
government of  Guinea  on terms to develop the Dian Dian bauxite
deposit.  The African nation’s government plans to introduce new
rules on mining concessions, Vladislav Soloviev, first deputy
chief executive officer of Moscow-based Rusal, told reporters
today. Rusal expects the policy change won’t affect the Dian
Dian venture because it isn’t a new project, Soloviev said.  “We are ready to start to develop the deposit, but we need
to solve the problems with infrastructure and agree on railroad
use with the government,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
