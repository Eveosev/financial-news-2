Ford Motor Co. (F)  plans to invest 1.5
billion pounds ($2.4 billion) in U.K. operations over the next
five years, Stephen Odell, the head of the carmakerâ€™s European
division, said at an industry conference in  London  today. More
than half of the funds will come from Ford, with European Union
grants and a 340 million-pound guarantee from the U.K. making up
the balance, Odell said, adding that Ford plans to create
several hundred jobs in Europe this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
