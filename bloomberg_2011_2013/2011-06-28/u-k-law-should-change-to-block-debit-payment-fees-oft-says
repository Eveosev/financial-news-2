British law should be changed to
prevent customers being made to pay additional charges when they
use debit cards to buy airline tickets and other goods and
services online, the U.K.’s antitrust regulator said.  A three-month investigation found evidence of “drip
pricing” surcharges that cost U.K. consumers 300 million pounds
($479.1 million) in 2009 in the  airline industry  alone, the
 Office of Fair Trading  said today in a statement.  “You can’t buy online with cash and people are frustrated
about being asked to pay for paying,” Cavendish Elithorn, an
OFT director, said in the statement. “Consumers find it harder
to shop around and find the best deal if they have to invest
time and effort in discovering surcharges.”  The probe followed a so-called supercomplaint filed with
the OFT in March by  Which? , a U.K. consumer-rights group. Which?
argued that many surcharges exceed the true cost of processing
credit and debit transactions. The group singled out retailers,
taxi services and low-cost airlines including  Ryanair Holdings
Plc. (RYA)   Ryanair today said the OFT’s findings won’t affect it
because it doesn’t use surcharges.  U.K. charter carrier Monarch Airlines said it welcomed the
OFT stance on fees.  “There is no justification for charging excessive fees on
credit and debit cards,” said Monarch’s Chief Executive Officer
Conrad Clifford. “We had already taken the decision to cancel
debit card fees some time ago following an intensive six-month
review.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
