Colruyt NV,  Belgium ’s biggest
discount food retailer, fell to the lowest in more than 1 1/2
years in Brussels trading after reporting an annual profit that
missed analysts’ estimates.  Colruyt slid as much as 14 percent to 32.40 euros, the
lowest since November 2009 and the biggest drop in at least two
decades. Net income per share in the fiscal year ended march 31
was 2.14 euros, missing the 2.25-euro average of 15 analyst
estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Sales increased 7.8 percent to
7.28 billion euros ($10.4 billion).  Payroll expenses rose at a faster pace than sales and
higher purchasing costs weren’t fully passed on to shoppers.
Colruyt expanded its workforce by 6.8 percent during the period
and payroll expenses jumped 9.5 percent. Adverse winter weather
also led to additional expenses, Colruyt said.  “It seems that the Belgian market will remain challenging
short term,” John David Roeg, an analyst at ING Groep NV in
Amsterdam, wrote in an investor note. “Colruyt is a great
company and we don’t believe that it will go ex-growth after
just one major miss. On the other hand, short term we see a lack
of potential catalysts.”  The shares were down 4.43 euros, or 12 percent, at 33.17
euros at 11:03 a.m. local time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
