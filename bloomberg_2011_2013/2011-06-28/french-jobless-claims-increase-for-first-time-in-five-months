The number of jobseekers in  France 
climbed for the first time in five months on signs that growth
may be slowing along with global economic output.  The total of unemployed people actively looking for work
climbed by 17,700, or 0.7 percent, from May, the Labor Ministry
said in a statement in Paris today. The total number of
jobseekers was 2.69 million.  The increase wipes out a third of the improvement in
jobless claims shown so far this year, highlighting the
difficulty President  Nicolas Sarkozy  is having in generating
employment two years after France emerged from its worst
recession in 60 years. Confidence among manufacturers has
dropped for two straight months, according to a Bank of France
survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
