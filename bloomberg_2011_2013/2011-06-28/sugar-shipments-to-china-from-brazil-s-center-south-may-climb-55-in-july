Brazil ’s Center South, the country’s
biggest sugar-producing region, may ship more than 500,000
metric tons of raw-sweetener to China in July, a 55 percent
increase from a year earlier, C. Czarnikow Sugar Futures Ltd.
said.  Chinese buyers want to meet demand before the start of the
next crop in the East Asian nation, the broker said. Brazil is
the world’s largest producer of sugar and China the second-
largest consumer after India.  “Chinese imports will need to arrive in August and
September in order to meet demand prior to the start of the
2011-12 crop,” Czarnikow analyst Peter de Klerk said today by
phone from  London .  China will produce 12 million tons of the sweetener in the
2011-12 marketing season, up from 11.3 million tons in the
current crop year, data on the  website  of the U.S. Department of
Agriculture showed.  Sugar imports by China may advance to 2.3 million tons in
the year ending Sept. 30, commodities trader  Olam International
Ltd. (OLAM)  said last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
