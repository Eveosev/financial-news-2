The Environmental Protection
Agency’s plan to wait until 2014 to finish studying the effects
of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water is “a little bit
goofy,” the head of a U.S. shale-gas committee said.  The seven-member Energy Department panel, led by former CIA
Director John Deutch, has a 90-day deadline to identify
immediate steps to improve the safety of hydraulic fracturing,
known as fracking, a technology that injects chemicals and water
into rock formations to free trapped natural gas.  “I am concerned about the time schedule” for the EPA’s
final report, Deutch said today during a meeting of his natural-
gas subcommittee in  Washington . To let three years pass “seems
to me a little bit goofy from the point of view of industry
interest or public interest,” he said.  Environmental groups are concerned that fracking to aid
natural gas drilling, particularly in the Marcellus Shale
formation in the eastern U.S., is tainting drinking water.  The initial report of the Energy Department advisory board
subcommittee is due about Aug. 18, Tiffany Edwards, an agency
spokeswoman, said in an e-mail.  The Environmental Protection Agency will provide periodic
updates on its study, Paul Anastas, the agency’s assistant
administrator for research and development, told the Energy
Department’s panel today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
