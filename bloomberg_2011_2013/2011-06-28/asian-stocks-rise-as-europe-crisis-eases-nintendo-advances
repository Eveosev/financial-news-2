Asian stocks rose, with the regional
benchmark index paring its loss for the month, on speculation
Greece may be allowed to roll over some of its bonds, easing
concern the nation’s sovereign debt crisis will spread across
Europe, one of  Asia ’s biggest export markets.  Esprit Holdings Ltd. (330) , the Hong Kong-based clothier that
gets most of its revenue from Europe, rose 1.7 percent.  Standard
Chartered Plc (STAN) , the U.K.’s third-largest bank by market value,
gained 2.1 percent in Hong Kong after the London-based lender
said it may post a “double-digit” growth in pretax profit in
the second half. J. Front Retailing Co. led a rally in Japanese
department store operators after a report showed the nation’s
retail sales fell at a slower pace than economists estimated in
May.  “Investors are becoming more optimistic,” said  Fumiyuki Nakanishi , a strategist at Tokyo-based SMBC Friend Securities
“There’s a sense that Europe is cooperating to avoid a worst
case scenario.”  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index rose 0.3 percent to 131.16 as
of 7:22 p.m. in  Tokyo , with three stocks rising for every two

2 high through yesterday amid mounting concern that a slowing
U.S. economy,  Europe ’s sovereign debt crisis and  China ’s steps
to curb inflation will crimp earnings.  Recent stock declines were arrested amid signs that Greek
policymakers and creditors may be headed toward a rollover
agreement involving 70 percent of their maturing bonds to
prevent a default. Lawmakers in Greece are due to vote on a
five-year austerity plan this week that must pass for the
country to secure aid from Europe and the International Monetary
fund to cover 6.6 billion euros ($9.4 billion) of debt in August.  ‘Extended Window’  “This gives Greece an extended window of opportunity to
push the through meaningful structural change,” said  Angus Gluskie , who manages about $350 million at White Funds
Management Pty. in Sydney. “What may have been viewed as
impossible within a short time frame, may be viewed as possible
over a sequence of years.”  Japan ’s  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average rose 0.7 percent, while
Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index added 0.3 percent. Hong Kong’s
Hang Seng Index gained 0.1 percent and China’s Shanghai
Composite Index was little changed. South Korea’s Kospi Index
decreased 0.4 percent.  Esprit climbed 1.7 percent to HK$23.45 in Hong Kong.
Nintendo Co., the maker of Wii gaming consoles that gets 33
percent of sales from Europe, increased 2.9 percent to 14,940
yen in Tokyo.  Mazda Motor Corp. (7261) , the Japanese carmaker that gets
18 percent of sales from Europe, added 0.5 percent to 205 yen.  Standard Chartered, the U.K. bank that gets more than half
of net revenue in the Asia Pacific, gained 2.1 percent to
HK$194.50 in  Hong Kong . The London-based lender said in a
statement today it may post “double-digit” growth in first-
half pretax profit after curbing expenses and income from
markets including Hong Kong,  Singapore  and China increased.  Microsoft-led Rally  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index retreated 0.2
percent today. The index advanced 0.9 percent yesterday in  New
York  after regulators issued capital rules to safeguard the
global financial system and Microsoft Corp. led a rally among
technology companies.  Spending on information technology by companies and
governments in the U.S. will grow 5.6 percent in 2011, according
to a survey by International Data Corp., about double the
estimated increase for gross domestic product. Of the executives
surveyed by the research firm, 31 percent said spending on
security initiatives was a top initiative this year, while 19
percent chose business analytics.  Powerchip Technology Corp. (5346) , Taiwan’s biggest maker of

Taipei. Smaller rival  Nanya Technology Corp. (2408)  gained 3.7 percent

sales, rose 2.1 percent to 547 yen. Smaller rival Isetan

Pacific Index advanced, led by healthcare, telecommunications
services companies and industrial stocks such as robot-maker
Fanuc Corp., which gets 75 percent of sales outside Japan and
climbed 2.6 percent to 12,960 yen in Tokyo today.  Tokyo Steel Manufacturing Co. jumped 4 percent to 828 yen.

and ensuing nuclear disaster.  MSM Debut  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index lost 5 percent this year
