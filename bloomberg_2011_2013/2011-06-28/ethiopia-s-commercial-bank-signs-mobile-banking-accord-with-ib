Commercial Bank of Ethiopia , the
country’s largest lender by revenue, has signed a deal for
 International Business Machines Corp. (IBM)  to build a platform to
deliver electronic banking services, as it aims to employ new
technology to expand its business.  The state-owned lender plans to increase the number of its
branches by 500, from 372 at present, over five years and to
boost account holders by 25 percent a year, from 2 million now,
the Addis Ababa-based bank said in an e-mailed statement today.
The statement was released jointly with New York-based IBM.  There’s growing demand for banking services in Ethiopia,
whose annual economic growth rate of 8 percent last year was the
fifth fastest in sub-Saharan  Africa , after the Democratic
Republic of Congo, Zimbabwe, Botswana and Nigeria, according to
an  International Monetary Fund  report in April.  The $3 million agreement aims to develop a platform,
operational by August, that will enable the bank to introduce
new mobile and Internet banking programs, the companies said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
