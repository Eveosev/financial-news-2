The U.S. supports French Finance
Minister  Christine Lagarde  to become the next head of the
 International Monetary Fund , the Treasury Department said today.  “Minister Lagarde’s exceptional talent and broad
experience will provide invaluable leadership for this
indispensable institution at a critical time for the global
economy,” Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner said in a
statement released in Washington.  Geithner also congratulated Lagarde’s rival, Mexican
central bank chief Agustin Carstens, for a “strong and very
credible candidacy.”  The IMF board meets today to discuss the choice of a new
managing director.  To contact the reporter on this story:
