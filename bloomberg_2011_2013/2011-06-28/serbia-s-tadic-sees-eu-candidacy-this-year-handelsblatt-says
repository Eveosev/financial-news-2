Serbia’s President Boris Tadic
expects his country to attain candidate status for European
Union membership by the end of this year and to start accession
negotiations early next year,  Handelsblatt  reported, citing an
interview.  Serbia’s sovereign debt is “much lower” than that of
 Greece  and the country is in control of its deficit, Tadic was
cited as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
