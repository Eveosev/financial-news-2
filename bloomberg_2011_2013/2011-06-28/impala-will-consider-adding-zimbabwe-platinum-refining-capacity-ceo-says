Impala Platinum Holdings Ltd. (IMP)  will
consider adding refining capacity in Zimbabwe once output of the
metal gets to about 400,000 or 500,000 ounces and if the
investment climate is “stable,” Chief Executive Officer  David
Brown  said.  A law in Zimbabwe that mining companies must sell 51
percent of their local assets to black Zimbabweans “doesn’t
really work for us,” he said in a speech in Johannesburg today.
Selling a 25 percent or 26 percent stake is “probably
reasonable,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
