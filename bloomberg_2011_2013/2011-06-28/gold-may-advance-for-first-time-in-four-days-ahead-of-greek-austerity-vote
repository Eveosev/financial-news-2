Gold gained for the first time in
four sessions in  New York  as a weaker dollar spurred demand for
the metal as an alternative investment.  The dollar declined versus the euro after ECB President
 Jean-Claude Trichet  said policy makers are in “strong vigilance
mode,” signaling they intend to raise interest rates next week.  “Today, it’s definitely the U.S. dollar that helps the
gold price,” said  Daniel Briesemann , an analyst at Commerzbank
AG in Frankfurt.  Gold futures for August delivery gained $3.80, or 0.3
percent, to settle at $1,500.20 an ounce at 1:38 p.m. on the
Comex in New York.  Prices are up 5.5 percent in 2011 after climbing the past
10 years. Europe’s debt crisis pushed gold to a record $1,577.40
on May 2. The metal is unlikely to top $2,000 without another
round of so-called quantitative easing from the  Federal Reserve ,
 Francisco Blanch , the head of global commodities research at
Bank of America Merrill Lynch, said today at a conference in New
York.  “At current prices, there is an expectation that physical
demand should help support the market,”  Edel Tully , a London-
based analyst at UBS AG, said in a report. “Indian buying has
picked up since late on Friday, but a move down to $1,485, where
many orders are sitting, is likely required to bring this market
out in force.” India is the world’s largest buyer of bullion.  Holdings in exchange-traded products backed by gold rose
for a third day yesterday, gaining 2.7 metric tons to 2,065.7
tons. That’s the highest level since May 4, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Silver futures for September delivery rose 5.5 cents, 0.2
percent, to $33.652 an ounce in New York.  Palladium futures for September delivery gained $10.55, or
1.5 percent, to $735.15 an ounce on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . Platinum futures for October delivery were up $18.90,
or 1.1 percent, at $1,693.50 an ounce on the Nymex.  To contact the reporter on this story:
