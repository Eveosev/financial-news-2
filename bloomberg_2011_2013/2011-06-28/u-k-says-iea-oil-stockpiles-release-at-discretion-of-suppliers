The release of U.K. oil stockpiles
under an International Energy Agency plan is at the discretion
of the companies holding the fuels, according to the Department
of Energy and Climate Change.  Having lowered companies’ reserves obligation by 3 million
barrels, the U.K. government takes no further action, a DECC
spokesman said from  London , declining to be identified in line
with department policy. It’s up to suppliers to sell the fuels
depending on demand, the spokesman said.  The IEA is coordinating the release of 60 million barrels
of oil over 30 days from the end of this week. The U.K.’s share
of that is made up of 600,000 barrels of crude oil and 2.4
million barrels in oil products, the Paris-based agency said
yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
