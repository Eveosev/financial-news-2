Top lawyers for  Barclays Plc (BARC)  and
 Citigroup Inc. (C)  said the U.K. regulator taking over for the
Financial Services Authority could stifle innovation by using
its power to ban risky financial products.  Brad Gans, Citigroup’s chief legal officer for  Europe ,
 Middle East  and Africa, said it is how financial products such
as collateralized debt obligations were used and sold, rather
than how they were designed, that contributed to the global
credit crunch. The products themselves weren’t bad, Gans said at
a Financial Services Authority conference today.  The FSA, the U.K.’s financial regulator, will be abolished
by the end of 2012 and replaced by at least two new authorities
as part of an overhaul of financial supervision. One of the
replacement agencies, the Financial Conduct Authority, has been
given powers to ban risky financial products or limit how they
are marketed, as well as publish information about its
disciplinary investigations while they are in progress.  “I don’t think the FSA should outlaw products, that’s too
far,” Gans said. “We do want consumers to have choice.”  Mark Harding, the general counsel for Barclays, said “we
just kill innovation” if we ban products.  “I think we should collectively regard it as a failure on
the part of the regulator if we have to ban products on anything
but an occasional basis,” Harding said. The more complex
products “were never devised in the first place to be sold to
consumers.”  To contact the reporter for this story:
