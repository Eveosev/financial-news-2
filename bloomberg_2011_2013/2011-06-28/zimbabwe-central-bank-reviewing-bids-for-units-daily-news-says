Zimbabwe ’s central bank is reviewing
offers made for eight of its companies that were put up for
sale, the  Daily News  said, citing Kumbirai Nhongo, the bank’s
spokesman.  Offers worth about $55 million have been made for two
companies, the Tuli coal mine in southern Zimbabwe and Cairns
Ltd., a canning and agricultural business, the Harare-based
