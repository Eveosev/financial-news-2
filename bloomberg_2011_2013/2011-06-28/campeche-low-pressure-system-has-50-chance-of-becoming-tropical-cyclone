A low-pressure system in the eastern
Bay of Campeche has a 50 percent chance of developing into the
Atlantic’s first named storm of 2011, according to the  National
Hurricane Center  in Miami.  The system, which has changed little in organization the
past several hours, is moving west-northwestward at 5 to 10
miles (8 to 16 kilometers) per hour, according to an NHC
 bulletin  at 2 a.m. New York time. It could bring heavy rain to
the Yucatan Peninsula and southeastern  Mexico  today even if it
doesn’t become better organized, the agency said.  “Upper-level winds are not currently conducive for
significant development,” the NHC said. “These winds are
forecast to gradually become more favorable during the next day
or so.”  Petroleos Mexicanos , the state-owned  oil company  that is
Latin America’s largest crude producer, has wells in the Bay of
Campeche. Rain from the system could cause mudslides and flash
floods in Mexico as well, according to the commercial forecaster
AccuWeather Inc. in  State College , Pennsylvania.  A U.S. Air Force Reserve aircraft is scheduled to fly into
the storm this afternoon to investigate its development if
necessary, the hurricane center said.  While two hurricanes have developed this year in the
eastern Pacific, no storms have emerged in the Atlantic, where
the hurricane season runs from June 1 to Nov. 30.  A system receives a name when sustained winds reach 39 mph.
The first Atlantic storm of 2011 will be named Arlene.  To contact the reporter on this story:
