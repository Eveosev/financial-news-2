Petroleos de  Venezuela  SA’s annual
profit plunged 27 percent last year as the South American
nation’s state oil company boosted transfers to the government.  Net income fell to $3.2 billion from $4.39 billion in 2009,
Oil Minister  Rafael Ramirez  announced today at a ceremony in
Caracas. Revenue rose 27 percent to $94.9 billion in 2010, while
total debt climbed 35 percent to $24.95 billion.  “When we compare our numbers with similar or larger
companies worldwide, we have very comfortable numbers,” Ramirez
said.  PDVSA, as the Caracas-based company is known, increased
spending on education, food-aid and health programs mandated by
President  Hugo Chavez  to $20.55 billion last year, Ramirez said.
The price that Venezuela received for its oil exports increased
to $72.69 a barrel in 2010 from $57.01 in 2009, according to the
 Oil Ministry .  To contact the reporter on this story:
