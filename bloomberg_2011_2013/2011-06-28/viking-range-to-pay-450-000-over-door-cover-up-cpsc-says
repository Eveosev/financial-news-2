Viking Range Corp. , a closely held
kitchen-equipment maker, will pay $450,000 to settle allegations
it failed to notify the government of a refrigerator safety
defect, the  U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission  said.  It’s the largest penalty issued by the agency since March
2010, according to the CPSC website. The CPSC penalizes
companies when they don’t report a safety defect.  The appliance maker, based in Greenwood,  Mississippi ,
learned in 2001 about a defect that allowed doors to fall off
refrigerators, the CPSC said in a Federal Register notice today.
The company didn’t notify the safety regulator until April 2009,
the agency said.  There were at least 10 reports of injuries due to falling
doors, and the refrigerators were recalled in June 2009, the
CPSC said. The agency’s 2009  recall notice  said injuries
included broken fingers or toes, bruises and strains.  The CPSC said 45,000 refrigerators were at risk for the
problem. The appliances were sold from 1999 to 2006 for between
$4,700 and $6,400.  Viking Range denies the refrigerators contained a safety
defect or that it violated U.S. consumer-protection laws,
according to the Federal Register notice. Cary New, a company
spokeswoman, didn’t immediately return a telephone message
seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
