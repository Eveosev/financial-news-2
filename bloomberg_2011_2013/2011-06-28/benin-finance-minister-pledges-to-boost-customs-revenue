     June 28 (Bloomberg) --- Benin Finance Minister Adidjatou
Mathys pledged to boost customs revenue, which makes up about 60
percent of government receipts, after income from tariffs
tumbled in the first half of the year.  Customs revenue will exceed the 618 billion CFA-franc
($1.35 billion) target by 10 percent this year, Mathys told
reporters today in the commercial capital, Cotonou.  Receipts tumbled 19 billion  CFA francs  in the first half of
the year from the same period of 2010, Mathys said, without
giving a figure for total customs revenue.  To contact the reporter on this story:
