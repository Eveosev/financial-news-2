Philip Morris CR AS (TABAK) â€™s costs will
rise when the Czech unit of the U.S. tobacco company starts
making cigarettes with so-called lower ignition propensity,
 Pravo  reported, citing company board member Andrea Gontkovicova.  The company does not plan to increase prices as a result of
the switch, Pravo quoted Gontkovicova as saying. The European
Union has banned the existing type of cigarettes as of Nov. 17,
2011, for fire-safety reasons, the Prague-based newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
