Mozambique’s economy will probably
expand 7.25 percent this year and inflation may slow to less
than 10 percent, the International Monetary Fund said.  The southern African nation’s economic growth could
accelerate from about 6.5 percent in 2010 and remain at an
average 8 percent in the “medium term,” the Washington-based
institution said in an e-mailed statement late yesterday.  The IMF supported the government’s intention to tighten
fiscal and monetary policy as needed to ease inflation, it said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
