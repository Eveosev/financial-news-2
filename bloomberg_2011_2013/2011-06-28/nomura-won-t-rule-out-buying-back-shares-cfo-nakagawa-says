Nomura Holdings Inc. (8604) , the Japanese
securities firm whose shares touched a 30-year low this month,
may consider repurchasing its stock, Chief Financial Officer
Junko Nakagawa said.  The nation’s biggest brokerage will review market
conditions and the business environment in making a decision on
a buyback, Nakagawa told shareholders at a meeting in Tokyo
today, according to Takanori Kaneko, a company spokesman. The
gathering was closed to media.  Nomura has slumped 72 percent since it acquired Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc.’s Asian and European operations in 2008.
The investment bank has never been riskier in credit markets,
according to CMA data going back three years, with a record
earthquake hampering business at home while  Europe ’s debt crisis
and a weakening global economy weigh on overseas markets.  “I am worried about Nomura’s future,” Takehisa Matsumura,
a 73-year-old investor who purchased 10,000 shares in October
2009, said in an interview outside the meeting venue. The stock
has lost almost a third of its value since its 568 yen price in
a public offering then. “They’ve been doing very aggressive
things to expand globally like suddenly adding 8,000 Lehman
staff.”  No Excuse  Nomura rose 0.8 percent to 387 yen at the 3 p.m. close of
trading in  Tokyo  today. The stock fell to 371 yen on June 17,
the lowest closing price since March 1981. Nakagawa’s comments
on the potential buyback were in response to an investor who
asked if Nomura plans to reduce outstanding shares.  Profit at  Japan ’s biggest brokerage fell 58 percent in the
year ended March as it posted losses in  Asia  and Europe. The
cost of insuring against default on Nomura’s bonds for five
years climbed to 222 basis points yesterday, the highest since
CMA began collecting data on the contracts in June 2008.  “Nomura shouldn’t use the economic slump as an excuse for
the stock decline,” Yoshihisa Katayama, a 51-year-old investor
who bought 2,000 shares two years ago and attended the meeting
today, said in an interview. “I want the bank to make further
efforts to improve its profitability.”  Some 1,554 shareholders attended the two-hour meeting today,
Nomura said. The brokerage didn’t disclose compensation for
executives including Chief Executive Officer Kenichi Watanabe at
the gathering. It cut total pay for the top 10 executives by 38
percent to 899 million yen ($11 million) for the year ended
March, according to documents posted on its website this month.  Nomura said in January 2008 it will buy back as much as 40
billion yen worth of shares from Feb. 8 to March 14 to improve
 shareholder value .  To contact the reporters on this story:
