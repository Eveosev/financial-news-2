The cost of insuring Asia-Pacific
corporate and sovereign bonds against non-payment decreased,
according to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 50 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  fell 2.5 basis points to 119 basis
points as of 8:28 a.m. in Singapore, according to Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc. prices. The Markit iTraxx Australia index
also dropped 2.5 basis points to 120.5 as of 10:14 a.m. in
Sydney, Westpac Banking Corp. prices show.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index decreased 0.5 basis point to
132.5 basis points as of 9:12 a.m. in Tokyo, Deutsche Bank AG
prices show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
credit quality. A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 of a percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
