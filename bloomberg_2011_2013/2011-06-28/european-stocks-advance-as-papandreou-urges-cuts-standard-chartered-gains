European stocks climbed as Greek
Prime Minister George Papandreou called on his country’s
lawmakers to back tougher austerity measures. Asian shares
advanced and U.S. futures were little changed.  Standard Chartered Plc (STAN)  rose 1.4 percent after the U.K.’s
third-largest bank by market value said first-half profit before
taxes may post “double-digit” growth from a year earlier.
 Prudential Plc (PRU)  climbed 2 percent after  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) 
upgraded the U.K.’s largest insurer to “buy.”  The benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 Index advanced 0.2 percent
to 264.61 at 8:04 a.m. in London. Since its peak this year on
Feb. 17, the gauge has still tumbled 9.1 percent as U.S.
economic data trailed forecasts, adding to concern that Greece
will fail to repay all its debt. Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
futures expiring in September slid 0.1 percent today, while the
MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed 0.3 percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
