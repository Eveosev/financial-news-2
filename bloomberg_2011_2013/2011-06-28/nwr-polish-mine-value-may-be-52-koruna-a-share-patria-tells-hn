New World Resources Plc’s project to
start coal production at the Debiensko mine in  Poland  in 2017
may be worth 52 koruna per share, Patria Finance analyst Tomas Sykora wrote in a commentary for  Hospodarske Noviny .  The project may generate a “net  cash flow ” of 150 million
euros ($214 million) a year starting in 2018, Sykora said.  Some analysts covering the stock, including those at
Citigroup Inc. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc., haven’t yet
reflected the project in their valuations of NWR and are likely
to increase share-price estimates, Sykora added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
