Defending Wimbledon champion  Rafael Nadal  said he’ll play in tomorrow’s quarterfinal after tests on
his foot showed no injury.  Nadal hurt his left foot in the first set of yesterday’s
four-set victory over Juan Martin del Potro of  Argentina  and had
an MRI at a London hospital last night, he said in a statement
e-mailed by his agent today.  “During the match I thought I had something serious but as
the match went through the pain got better and thankfully the
tests don’t show an injury,” top-ranked Nadal said. “Today I
will practice at 4:30 p.m. and I’ll play tomorrow.”  Nadal faces Mardy Fish of the U.S. in the quarterfinals.
The Spaniard needs to retain his title at the All England Club
to stay No. 1 in the ATP World Tour ranking. He told reporters
yesterday after beating Del Potro he initially thought he’d
broken his foot and may have to retire from the match.  The 25-year-old Nadal has struggled with injuries
throughout his career. He was unable to defend his 2008
Wimbledon title because of tendinitis in his knee.  Nadal started the season with a shot at becoming the first
man since  Rod Laver  in 1969 to hold all four Grand Slam titles
at the same time. Instead, he limped out of the Australian Open
with a ruptured thigh muscle after a quarterfinal loss to
 Spain ’s  David Ferrer .  To contact the reporter on this story:
