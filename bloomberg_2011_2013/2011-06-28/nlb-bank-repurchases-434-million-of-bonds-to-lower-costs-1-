Nova Ljubljanska Banka d.d.
repurchased 296 million euros ($424 million) worth of state-
backed bonds as Slovenia’s biggest bank seeks to lower costs and
improve its capital ahead of European Union stress tests.  The bank had sought to repurchase 500 million euros of the
1.5 billion euros in three-year securities maturing in July
2012, it said today in a statement to the stock market.  The Ljubljana-based lender repurchased the securities “to
adjust operative and structural liquidity and lower the bank’s
financing costs,” NLB, as the lender is known, said in a
separate e-mailed statement today. “Current liquidity and
market conditions enable us to lower and diversify our funding
under favorable circumstances.”  Nova Ljubljanska, in which the government holds an indirect
majority, must improve its capital ratio, the central bank has
said, after the 2009 recession caused a surge in bad loan
provisions. The lender, which is undergoing EU stress tests that
will show its resistance to further economic shocks, had its
debt and deposit rating cut three levels by Moody’s Investors
Service to Baa3 on concern bad loans will continue to weaken its
capital base.  The central bank demanded NLB improve its capital ratio by
getting additional funds even after it raised 250 million euros
in March with a share sale. The bank’s supervisory board will by
the end of the month prepare “an action plan to raise the
demanded capital adequacy ratios,” it said.  -- Editors: Douglas Lytle, Douglas Lytle  To contact the reporter on this story:
