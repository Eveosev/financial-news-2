A “voluntary rollover” of Greek
bonds, as they mature, into bonds with similar terms would
“very likely” be viewed by Fitch Ratings Ltd. as a sovereign
default, according to  David Riley , Fitch’s group managing
director with responsibility for sovereign ratings and
international public finance.  In a letter to the Financial Times, published today, Riley
disputed a statement in a June 24 FT article that Fitch has
“signaled” that it wouldn’t downgrade Greek bonds to default
in the event of such a rollover, which wouldn’t amount to “a
failure to pay coupons or principal.”  In fact, the Greek sovereign rating would probably be
placed in “restricted default,” Riley wrote.  Fitch is “guided by the spirit as well as the letter” of
its yardsticks and “if it looks like a default, we will rate it
as a default,” Riley said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
