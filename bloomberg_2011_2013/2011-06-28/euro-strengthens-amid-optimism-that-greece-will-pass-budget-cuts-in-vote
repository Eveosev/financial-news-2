The euro gained against the dollar
before Greek lawmakers vote on budget cuts needed to prevent the
currency union’s first default.  The 17-nation currency advanced versus against the majority
of its most-traded counterparts after Greek Prime Minister
 George Papandreou  called on lawmakers to obey their “patriotic
conscience” and back tougher austerity measures, as they began
to debate a five-year budget plan yesterday.  “I don’t imagine that we’re going to see any momentum that
would take the euro out of this range, given that this vote is
so crucial and so imminent,” said Jane Foley, a senior currency
strategist at Rabobank International in London. “ If the votes
aren’t successful, it could be Armageddon day for the  euro zone .
Therefore there is this underlying assumption that the votes
will get passed.”  The euro advanced 0.2 percent to $1.4317 as of 8:46 a.m. in
London, after earlier slipping as much as 0.2 percent. The
common currency was little changed at 115.64. The dollar bought
80.78 yen from 80.89 yesterday, when it reached 80.98, the
highest level since June 16.  To contact the reporter on this story:
