(Corrects date on letter in second paragraph.)  Southern Union Co. (SUG) ’s board isn’t
permitted to hold negotiations with Williams Cos. about a
competing bid to buy the pipeline company,  Energy Transfer
Equity LP (ETE)  said.  “Any attempt by Southern Union to engage in discussions or
furnish non-public information to Williams in the current
circumstances will constitute a willful and intentional breach”
of its merger agreement with Energy Transfer, the company said
in a letter dated yesterday.  Williams unveiled a $39-a-share bid for Southern Union last
week, trumping a $33-a-share offer from Energy Transfer.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
