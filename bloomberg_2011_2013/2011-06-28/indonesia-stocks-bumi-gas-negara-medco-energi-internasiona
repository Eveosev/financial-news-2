Shares of the following companies
had unusual moves in Indonesian trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses, and prices are as of break at noon Jakarta time.  The  Jakarta Composite index (JCI)  gained 13.34 points, or 0.4
percent, to 3,826.76. The market will be closed tomorrow for a
public holiday.  PT Aneka Tambang (ANTM IJ), the state-owned nickel
producer, advanced 1.2 percent to 2,100 rupiah. Nickel futures
rose for a third straight day, gaining as much as 0.9 percent to
$22,390 a metric ton in  London  today.  PT Bumi Resources (BUMI IJ), Indonesia’s largest coal
producer, fell 1.7 percent to 2,975 rupiah, the biggest drag on
the Jakarta Mining Index, which tracks 28 companies.  Vallar Plc said it entered into agreements with Bumi
shareholders to increase its stake to about 28.9 percent. The
transaction price may be lower than Bumi’s last closing price,
which makes the deal look less attractive to existing Bumi
shareholders, Herman Koeswanto, an analyst at PT Mandiri
Sekuritas said in a note today.  Bumi Director Dileep Srivastava couldn’t immediately be
reached when called on his mobile phone.  PT Perusahaan Gas Negara (PGAS IJ),  Indonesia ’s biggest gas
distributor, advanced 1.3 percent to 4,025 rupiah. Shareholders
approved a final dividend of 144.24 rupiah a share, amounting to
60 percent of last year’s net income, President Director Hendi
Prio Santoso said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
