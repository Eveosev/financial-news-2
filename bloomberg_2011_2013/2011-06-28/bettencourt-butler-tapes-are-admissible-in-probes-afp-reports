The tapes made secretly by  L’Oreal
SA (OR)  heiress Liliane Bettencourt’s then-butler can be used by
investigators as evidence in related inquiries, the appeals
court in Bordeaux, France, ruled today, Agence France-Presse
reported, citing Bettencourt’s lawyer Bertrand Favreau.  The recordings, made between late 2009 and early 2010, were
turned over to Bettencourt’s daughter to use in her case against
a friend of her mother’s whom she suspected was manipulating
her, AFP said. Mother and daughter settled their differences and
dropped legal procedures last year, AFP said.  Lawyers for the women said they would appeal the decision.
Favreau will take the case to the  European Court  of Human
Rights, arguing that the tapes are a violation of privacy, and
the daughter’s lawyer,  Olivier Metzner , will appeal to France’s
highest appeals court arguing that while the tapes should be
admissible, some of the investigations spawned by them should be
voided, AFP said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
