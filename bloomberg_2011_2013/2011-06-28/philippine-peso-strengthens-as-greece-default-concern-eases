The Philippine peso rebounded from a
one-week low as European nations moved closer to an agreement
that will help  Greece  avoid a default, boosting demand for
emerging-market assets.  Most Asian currencies and stocks advanced as Greek Prime
Minister  George Papandreou  seeks approval from lawmakers for
budget cuts and state asset sales in order to get further
financial assistance. The Philippine government reported today
that imports climbed 20.3 percent in April from a year earlier,
slowing from a 21.8 percent increase in March.  “The developments in  Europe  would be the main driver of
Asian currencies and also the movement in fund flows,” said
Lito Biacora, vice president for treasury at Bank of the
Philippine Islands in Manila. “We might be seeing a tight range
for the peso with a bias toward appreciation.”  The peso advanced as much as 0.2 percent before closing
little changed at 43.575 per dollar at 4 p.m. in  Manila ,
compared with 43.593 yesterday, according to prices from inter-
dealer broker Tullett Prebon Plc. The currency reached 43.615
yesterday, the weakest level since June 20.  The government delayed releasing the budget balance for May
from today until July 1. The surplus was 26.3 billion pesos
($603 million) in April as revenue rose and spending fell. State
expenditure was within target in May, Budget Undersecretary
Laura Pascua said in a mobile-phone message yesterday.  The yield on the 9.125 percent bond due September 2016 fell
one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 5.13 percent,
according to Tradition Financial Services.  To contact the reporter for this story:
