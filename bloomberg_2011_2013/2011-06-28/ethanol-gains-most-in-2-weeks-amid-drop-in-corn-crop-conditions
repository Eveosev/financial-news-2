Ethanol futures gained the most in
two weeks after a government report showed a decline in corn
crop conditions.  The biofuel rose with corn after the U.S. Agriculture
Department said 68 percent of the crop was in good or excellent
condition on June 26, down from 70 percent a week earlier. The
grain is the primary feedstock for ethanol made in the U.S.  “Small deterioration,” said Mike Blackford, a consultant
at INTL FCStone in  Des Moines ,  Iowa . “We’ve had too much wet
weather. Ethanol still remains decent.”  Denatured ethanol for July delivery rose 6 cents, or 2.3
percent, to settle at $2.67 a gallon on the Chicago Board of
Trade, the steepest one-day gain since June 8.  In cash market trading, ethanol in Chicago jumped 7.5
cents, or 2.9 percent, to $2.675 a gallon and in  New York  the
additive advanced 7 cents, or 2.6 percent, to $2.77, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in the U.S. Gulf increased 2 cents, or 0.7 percent,
to $2.745 a gallon and on the West Coast the biofuel gained 1.5
cents, or 0.5 percent, to $2.80.  Corn futures for December delivery soared 26.25 cents, or
4.2 percent, to $6.53 a bushel in  Chicago . One bushel can make
at least 2.75 gallons of ethanol.  To contact the reporter on this story:
