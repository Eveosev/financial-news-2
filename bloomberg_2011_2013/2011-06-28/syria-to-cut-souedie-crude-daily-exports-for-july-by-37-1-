Sytrol,  Syria ’s state-run oil
company, will cut daily exports of Souedie crude for loading in
July from its Mediterranean port Tartous by 37 percent,
according to a shipping schedule seen by Bloomberg News.  The July program for Souedie, also known as Syrian Heavy,
comprises four 80,000-metric-ton cargoes and two shipments of
35,000 tons. That’s equivalent to 2.7 million barrels, or 87,058
barrels a day, compared with 137,247 barrels a day in June.  The company will also ship one 80,000-ton consignment of
Syrian Light in July from Banias terminal in the Mediterranean,
one less than June. July’s volume amounts to 601,600 barrels, or
19,406 barrels a day.  Souedie has a density of 24.1 degrees on the American
Petroleum Institute scale and a sulfur content of 3.9 percent,
while Syrian Light has 37.7 degrees of API density and is 0.74
percent sulfur, according to Energy Intelligence Group.  The conversion factor from a ton to a barrel is 6.92 for
Souedie, and 7.52 for Syrian Light.  To contact the reporter on this story:
