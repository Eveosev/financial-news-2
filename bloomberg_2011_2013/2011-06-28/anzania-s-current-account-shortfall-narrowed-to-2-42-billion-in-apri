Tanzania ’s current-account deficit
narrowed to $2.42 billion in the 12 months through April from
$2.44 billion in the same period a year earlier, the Bank of
Tanzania said.  The decline came after exports increased more than imports,
the Dar es Salaam-based central bank said in an e-mailed
statement today. Gold exports from Tanzania, which vies with
 Mali  to be  Africa ’s third-biggest producer of the metal, climbed
14 percent to $1.62 billion.  Foreign currency reserves amounted to $3.7 billion by the
end of April, enough to cover imports in East Africa’s second-
biggest economy for 4.6 months.  The national debt rose $176.3 million to $11.4 billion in
April from the month before.  To contact the reporter on this story:
