Centrica Plc (CNA) , the U.K.’s largest
energy supplier, said first-half earnings will be lower than a
year ago because of higher commodity costs and lower demand.  U.K. residential energy operating profit is expected to be
around half the level seen in the first six months of 2010, the
Windsor, England-based company said today in a statement.  The decline will be partially offset by the utility’s North
Sea fields and North American business, even though production
earnings in the U.K. are now more highly taxed and gas storage
profit will be “significantly” lower, Centrica said.  Wholesale gas and power prices were 25 percent higher while
average residential gas consumption was down 19 percent in the
first four months of the year compared with the same period of
2010, Centrica said last month. Warmer temperatures and energy
efficiency measures trimmed electricity consumption.  “Full-year earnings are expected to show year-on-year
growth, subject to the usual variables, particularly retail
margin recovery and weather,” the company said in today’s
statement. Centrica will release first-half results on July 28.  To contact the reporter on this story:
