Tourist arrivals in Mauritius fell 4
percent in May from a year earlier, as the number of visitors
from the country’s main European markets declined, the Tourism
Promotion Authority said.  Arrivals fell to 68,214, the Port Louis-based agency said
on its  website  today. The decline was led by  France , the Indian
Ocean island nation’s main market, whose visitors fell by 13
percent to 18,997. Arrivals from the U.K dropped by 13.5 percent
to 6,670 tourists, it said. Visitors from Reunion Island,
Mauritius’s largest regional market, fell by 16 percent to
9,480.  Tourism and textiles are the country’s main sources of
foreign currency. For 2011, the tourism agency has set a target
of 1 million visitors, or a 7.1 percent increase compared with
934,827 last year, it said on Jan. 26. Revenue is expected to
grow by 7.7 percent to 42.5 billion rupees ($1.5 billion),
according to forecasts from the Central Statistics Office
released on Feb. 25.  To contact the reporter on this story:
