An Ethiopian rebel group, the Ogaden
National Liberation Front, released two workers with the  United
Nations ’ World Food Programme who were abducted last month in
the Ogaden area of Ethiopia’s Somali region.  They were taken during an ambush on May 13 that killed one
worker and injured another. The missing workers were handed over
to WFP representatives near the Somalia border yesterday, the
ONLF said in an e-mailed statement.  The government and the ONLF, which has been fighting for
self-determination of the Ogaden area of the region since 1984,
accused each other of carrying out the ambush.  Judith Schuler, the WFP’s spokeswoman in Ethiopia, declined
to comment when contacted today and a call to the mobile phone
of State Minister of Communications Shimeles Kemal was not
answered.  To contact the reporter on this story:
