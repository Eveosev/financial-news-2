The U.S. Supreme Court refused to
reinstate  Roger Clemens ’s defamation suit against his onetime
trainer,  Brian McNamee , who has said he injected the former all-
star pitcher with performance-enhancing drugs.  A federal appeals court ruled that Clemens couldn’t press
the suit in his home state of Texas because McNamee didn’t have
sufficient connections to that state. The justices today
rejected Clemens’s appeal of that ruling, which leaves open the
possibility that he could file his complaint elsewhere.  The suit centers on statements McNamee gave first to
federal investigators in 2007 and then to former Senator George Mitchell, to whom Major League Baseball gave the job of
investigating the use of performance-enhancing drugs. McNamee
repeated the allegations in an  interview  with a reporter at
SI.com.  McNamee said he injected Clemens, a seven-time Cy Young
Award winner, in 1998, 2000 and 2001. Clemens, 48, retired in
2007 after playing for four teams including the  New York Yankees 
and the  Boston Red Sox .  Clemens is separately under indictment for allegedly
obstructing a congressional investigation into steroid use,
making false statements and committing perjury. His trial is set
for July.  The case is Clemens v. McNamee, 10-966.  To contact the reporter on this story:
