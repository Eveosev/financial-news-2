Standard Chartered Plc (STAN) , the U.K.’s
third-largest bank by market value, said it no longer holds
government debt in troubled euro-area countries.  “We have no sovereign exposure to those eurozone countries
that are clearly in trouble,” Finance Director Richard Meddings
said on a call with journalists today. He didn’t name the
countries. “Over the last 18 months we’ve been reducing our
eurozone exposures to the financial institutions and we’ve been
shifting away predominantly into Asian governments and
supranationals.”  The eurozone may suffer its first sovereign default
tomorrow if the Greek parliament votes against an austerity
package. Bond yields of the euro area’s highly indebted nations,
including Portugal, Italy and Ireland, jumped to records
relative to German bunds amid concern about a Greek default.  Standard Chartered  earns three quarters of its profit in
 Asia , where it traces its roots to 19th century British colonial
banks. The lender is 15.5 percent-owned by Temasek Holdings Pte,
Singapore’s state investment company, according to Bloomberg
data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
