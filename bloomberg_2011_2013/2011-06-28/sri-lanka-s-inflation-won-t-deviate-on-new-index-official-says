Sri Lanka’s inflation rate in June
“won’t deviate much” on the new  consumer price index  to be
released this month, said D.C.A. Gunawardena, a director at the
nation’s Department of Census and Statistics.  “Upward pressure” on the index could build in future with
more weight on non-food items such as transport, housing and
energy, he said in a telephone interview today.  The new gauge is based on spending patterns of households
in the capital  Colombo  in 2006 and 2007, compared with the
current index that tracks 2002 consumption. The department will
release June inflation figures Thursday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
