Mozambique’s national airline
canceled some domestic flights because a jet fuel shortage at
the Maputo International Airport.  A shortage of jet A1 fuel will affect flights on July 10
and July 11, Linha Aereas de Mocambique said in a  statement 
posted yesterday on its website. The carrier didn’t say if
international flights would be affected.  Airline spokesman Adam Yussof couldn’t immediately be
reached on his mobile phone for a comment. The company said it
would keep customers informed of developments through its
website or its page on the Facebook social networking website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
