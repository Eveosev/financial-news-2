Mayor of London  Boris Johnson  said
he will decide whether the redevelopment of  Saatchi & Saatchi ’s
London office building will proceed after the borough of Camden
refused planning permission.  Johnson invoked his right to review plans to rejuvenate the
New York-based advertising agency’s site in London following
Camden Council’s decision to block the proposal, the mayor’s
office said in an e-mailed statement today.  “Redeveloping this prime location will contribute to the
competitiveness of London’s wider economy, bringing with it new
jobs and business,” Johnson said.  The site is in an important commercial hub and would create
40,000 square meters (431,000 square feet) of office and
commercial real estate in the city, the mayor said. The
development would trigger a 1.6 million-pound ($2.6 million)
contribution toward building London’s Crossrail train project.  Derwent London Plc (DLN)  owns the 1.4 acre (0.6 hectares) site at
80 Charlotte Street and plans to expand the building to 320,000
square feet of offices and 16,000 square feet of residences from
200,000 square feet of offices, according to the London-based
company’s annual report.  Derwent “are pleased that the Greater London Authority has
recognized the important of the Charlotte Street to the district
and the wider London economy,” said external spokeswoman
Elizabeth Adams by e-mail today.  The project was scheduled to be completed in 2015 and has
annual rental income of 4.3 million pounds ($6.9 million) from
Saatchi & Saatchi.  Saatchi & Saatchi was founded in London in 1970 and is now
part of Paris-based  Publicis Groupe SA (PUB) , the world’s third-
largest communications group, according to Saatchi’s  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
