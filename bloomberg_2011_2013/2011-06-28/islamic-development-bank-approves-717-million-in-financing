The  Islamic Development Bank 
approved $717 million in financing, including $198 million for
power generation and primary education projects in Bangladesh.  The approvals also included $191 million for water
transmission and storage facilities in Bahrain, $95 million for
power production in Senegal and a $75 million credit for an
Islamic bank in Turkey, the lender, based in Jeddah,  Saudi
Arabia , said in an e-mailed statement today. A $66 million
package for power production in Syria and $25 million for
Indonesiaâ€™s Bank Syariah Mandiri was also approved.  Islamic Development Bank said June 15 it will give Egypt a
$2.5 billion financing package over three years as the country
seeks to bridge its budget deficit after a popular revolt. In
early June, the bank said it will lend $291 million for
electricity projects in Tunisia, which also witnessed protests
that toppled its president.  The bank also approved grants under its Waqf Fund for
projects in Muslim communities in non-member countries including
Brazil, Burundi, Ethiopia,  China , India and Slovenia along with
donations for the development of four hospitals in Somalia, it
said today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
