Copper and nickel advanced as
optimism that  Greece  won’t default helped increase confidence in
the economy, potentially boosting demand for raw materials.  Three-month copper on the  London  Metal Exchange climbed as
much as 0.6 percent to $9,020 a metric ton, and was at $8,984 at
2:54 p.m. in Singapore, while nickel gained as much as 0.9
percent to $22,390 a ton. Aluminum rose as Greek creditors may
agree to roll over the nation’s debt to prevent a default before
lawmakers in the country vote tomorrow on budget cuts and asset
sales needed to secure an aid payment.  “We’re not going to see a strong rebound as long as this
Greece issue hangs over investors’ heads,” said Yang Jun, an
analyst at Hongyuan Futures Co. “The macroeconomic environment
will continue to drive direction.”  Copper on the Comex in  New York  rose as much as 0.7 percent
to $4.097 a pound, while metal for September delivery on the
Shanghai Futures Exchange climbed as much as 0.9 percent to
67,450 yuan ($10,419) a ton.  The dollar was little changed against a six-currency basket
including the euro after losing 0.3 percent as  Germany  welcomed
a proposal from French lenders on a rollover agreement involving
70 percent of Greek bonds, sending Asian equities higher.  The regional benchmark MSCI Asia Pacific Index rose today
as concern that Greece’s sovereign debt crisis will spread
across  Europe , one of Asia’s biggest export markets, eased.  Nickel Pig Iron  Nickel, the worst-performer on the London Metal Exchange
this year, may extend a decline as  China  leads a switch among
users to a low-cost substitute, hurting refined metal prices,
according to Morgan Stanley.  Prices are at risk of reaching a “bear-case scenario” of
$10.42 per pound ($22,976 a ton) this year on “greater than
anticipated levels of substitution from nickel pig-iron
production in China,” analysts Peter Richardson and Joel Crane,
wrote in a report today. Three-month nickel, trading at $22,345
a ton, has averaged $25,628 this year.  Aluminum in London climbed 0.3 percent to $2,516.50 a ton
and zinc rose 0.3 percent to $2,260 a ton. Lead gained 0.4
percent to $2,577 a ton, while tin lost 0.3 percent to $25,000.  To contact the reporter on this story:
