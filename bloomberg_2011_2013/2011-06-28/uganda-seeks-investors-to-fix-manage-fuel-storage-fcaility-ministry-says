Uganda  is seeking private partners
to help fix and manage a 30 million-liter gasoline and diesel
storage facility, the country’s energy ministry said.  The tanks at Jinja, 80 kilometers (50 miles) east of the
capital Kampala, will be jointly operated by the government and
contractors for 10 years, the ministry said in a statement
published in the Kampala-based Daily Monitor today.  The East African nation’s political opposition led protests
in April and May over rising food and fuel prices. They blamed
the rising fuel prices on the government’s failure to maintain
reserves.  To contact the reporter on this story:
