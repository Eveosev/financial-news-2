Asia gasoil swaps fell to the lowest
in four months while  fuel oil  was little changed after the
International Energy Agency said last week it plans to release
emergency stockpiles. Naphtha swaps rose for the first day in
three.  Middle Distillates  July swaps for gasoil slid 60 cents, or 0.5 percent, to
$117.20 a barrel at 11:28 a.m. Singapore time, according to PVM
Oil Associates Ltd., a London-based crude and refined-products
broker. Front-month swap prices are at the lowest since Feb. 18.  Jet fuel’s premium to gasoil, or the regrade, gained 5
cents to 95 cents a barrel today. Jet-fuel swaps were at $118.15
a barrel, the lowest since Feb. 16.  Gasoil’s premium to Dubai crude, a measure of processing
profit for the fuel, fell $2.19, or 12 percent, to $15.39 a
barrel, PVM data showed. Refining margins dropped by the most
since Dec. 28, 2009.  The U.S. and 27 allies will release emergency oil
stockpiles through the  International Energy Agency  for the third
time in more than three decades as the war in  Libya  chokes
global supplies.  Countries including  Japan ,  Germany  and  France  may release
oil products like diesel, fuel oil and gasoline, according to
numerical data posted yesterday on the IEA’s website.  Fuel Oil  Fuel oil’s discount to Dubai crude widened $1.59, or 36
percent, to $6 a barrel, PVM data showed.  High-sulfur fuel-oil swaps were unchanged at $622.75 a
metric ton. The premium of 180-centistoke fuel oil to 380-
centistoke grade increased 25 cents to $10 a ton today.  Light Distillates  July swaps for naphtha rose $18.50, or 2.1 percent, to $885
a ton, PVM data showed.  The crack spread, a measure of the refining margin for
processing  Brent crude  into the petrochemical feedstock, rose to
$86.70 a ton from $80.23 at the end of Asian trading yesterday,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
