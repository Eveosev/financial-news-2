Tourist arrivals in  Kenya , East
Africa’s biggest economy, grew 16 percent in the first four
months of the year as the country stepped up its marketing
campaign, Tourism Minister Najib Balala said.  The number of visitors who landed at Kenya’s main airports
in Nairobi and Mombasa between January and April rose to 390,148
from 336,179 a year earlier, Balala told reporters today in the
capital.  Tourist arrivals hit a record 1.1 million last year, while
revenue from the industry jumped 18 percent to 73.7 billion
shillings ($820 million).  Tourism , Kenya’s second-largest
foreign-exchange earner after tea, accounts for 11 percent of
the nation’s gross domestic product.  In the four months through April, income from tourism grew
18 percent, Balala said, without providing the exact amount. The
government is targeting a 20 percent increase in tourist
arrivals this year, he said on June 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
