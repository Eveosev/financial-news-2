China  may increase thermal power
generation capacity at a lower rate in the next two years than
the average over the previous five years, China Electricity
Council said in a statement on its website today.  The nation may add 25 million kilowatts less than the five-
year average, based on the current pace of expansion, according
to the statement.  Without faster construction of thermal power plants, the
electricity supply situation will be tougher in the next two
years, it said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
