Vallares Plc, an investment vehicle
that plans to invest in oil and gas assets, raised 1.3 billion
pounds ($2 billion) in a share sale this month, about the same
amount as was raised in the whole of last year by U.K. companies
in new equity, net of buybacks and acquisitions,  Richard Lambert 
wrote in the Financial Times.  Lambert, who headed the CBI employers confederation until
the start of the year, said that’s remarkable, given that
Vallares, set up by Tony Hayward, BP Plc’s former chief
executive officer, and financier  Nathaniel Rothschild , has no
operating history, no revenue and no basis on which to assess
its ability to meet its objectives.  John Kay, who was appointed by the government last week to
review how the British equity market functions, should focus on
why it’s so easy to raise money for a vehicle such as Vallares
and so difficult to find equity capital for the long-term
investment on which the country’s economic wellbeing depends,
Lambert said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
