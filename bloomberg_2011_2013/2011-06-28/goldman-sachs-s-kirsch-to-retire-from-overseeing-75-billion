Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) ’s Eric Kirsch plans to retire as global head of insurance asset
management, a position that involved overseeing $75 billion for
clients, according to a company spokesman.  Kirsch plans to leave the New York-based Goldman Sachs in
September after four years on the job,  Ed Canaday , a spokesman,
said in a telephone interview. John Melvin, global head of
insurance fixed-income portfolio management, and Ellen Cooper,
global head of insurance strategy, are among executives who will
take over Kirsch’s responsibilities.  Goldman Sachs tripled insurance general account client
assets under management while Kirsch was at the firm, according
to Canaday. The bank said this month that Mark Oldcorn and
Etienne Comon will be joining its asset-management group in
 London  as it looks to expand services in  Europe  overseeing funds
for insurers.  “We are fully committed to the insurance asset-management
business and have a strong leadership team in place,” said
Canaday. “We will continue to invest in additional resources
and infrastructure to serve this very important client
segment.”  Kirsch joined Goldman Sachs in 2007 after overseeing about
$140 billion at Deutsche Bank AG’s insurance asset-management
business. His retirement was reported by Insurance Asset Manager
yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
