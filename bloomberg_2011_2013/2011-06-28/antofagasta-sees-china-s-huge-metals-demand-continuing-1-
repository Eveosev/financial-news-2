Antofagasta Plc (ANTO) , the operator of
four copper mines in  Chile , expects to benefit from “huge
demand” for metals as China and other emerging economies
develop, said Chief Executive Officer Jean Paul Luksic.  "There’s a tremendous demand push by the industrialization
and urbanization of China,’’ Luksic, whose billionaire family
controls Antofagasta, said today in an interview in London.
“You see huge demand for all these metals.”  The company will continue to invest in new mines in Chile
and overseas to meet demand from the so-called BRIC economies of
Brazil, Russia, India and China, Luksic said. Mine projects will
“take time” to meet rising demand, he said.  Antofagasta, which is developing new mines in Pakistan and
Zambia, has fallen 19 percent this year in  London  trading as
investors sold producers of commodities on concern the European
debt crisis will slow global economic growth.  To contact the reporters on this story:
