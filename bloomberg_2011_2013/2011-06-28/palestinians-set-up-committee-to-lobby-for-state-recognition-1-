The  Palestinian Authority  set up a
committee to lobby for recognition of its state before the vote
it will seek at the United Nations in September, said  Nabil Shaath , a senior official.  “We will approach each state that hasn’t recognized us and
ask them to do so,” he told journalists in the West Bank city
of Ramallah today. The team will also “make sure those who have
already recognized us will continue to do so” amid Israeli and
U.S. pressure to backtrack.  Shaath, an official in Palestinian Authority President
Mahmoud Abbas’s Fatah party, said he held “no hope for a
constructive peace process at the moment before the coming U.S.
presidential elections” in November 2012.  Israeli-Palestinian peace talks stalled in September after
 Israel ’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, refused to extend a
nine-month construction freeze in West Bank settlements and
Abbas said he wouldn’t resume negotiations without a full
building halt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
