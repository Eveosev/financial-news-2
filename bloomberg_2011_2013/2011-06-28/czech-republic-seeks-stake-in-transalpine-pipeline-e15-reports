Mero CR AS, the state-owned operator
of oil pipelines in the  Czech Republic , is increasingly
optimistic that it will be able to buy a share in the
Transalpine Pipeline,  E15  reported, citing Mero chief Jaroslav
Pantucek.  Buying into the pipeline that brings oil from Italyâ€™s
seaport of Trieste via  Germany  would help the Czech Republic to
improve its energy security as it seeks an alternative to
Russian oil from the Druzhba pipeline, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
