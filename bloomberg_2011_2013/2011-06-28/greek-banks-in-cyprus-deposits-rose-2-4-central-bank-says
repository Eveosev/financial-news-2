Deposits at Greek banks in Cyprus
rose 2.4 percent to 8.2 billion euros ($11.7 billion) in May
from April and fell 4.1 percent compared with May last year, the
 Central Bank of Cyprus  said.  The month-on-month increase was mainly a result of a 17
percent rise in deposits at Piraeus Bank (Cyprus) Ltd. to 1.2
billion euros and an 11 percent increase at National Bank of
Greece (Cyprus) Ltd., a unit of Greece’s largest lender, to 1.1
billion euros, the east Mediterranean island’s central bank said
in a  statement  on its website today. Overall deposits in the
Cypriot banking system rose 2.9 percent last month compared with
April and an annual 14 percent.  Deposits at Alpha Bank Cyprus Ltd. fell 0.3 percent in May
to 3.3 billion euros compared with April, while Eurobank EFG
Cyprus Ltd. and Emporiki Bank - Cyprus Ltd. saw their respective
deposits decline 2.8 percent and 3.1 percent to 2.3 billion
euros and 306 million euros, the statement said.  Deposits at Greek banks on the island last year rose 30
percent as Greek depositors transferred money to Cyprus on
concerns  Greece  may default on its debt or abandon the euro and
impose restrictions on capital flows.  To contact the reporter on this story:
