The women’s quarterfinals at
Wimbledon have been delayed because of heavy rain.  All courts were covered after rain started about 1 p.m.
local time at the All England Club in southwest  London . The
retractable roof over Centre Court has been closed and it will
take about 40 minutes for the indoor conditions to settle before
play starts.  “Heavy showers are likely to continue possibly for a
couple of hours,” organizers said in an announcement.  After a shake-up in the women’s draw yesterday, with
defending champion Serena Williams, her sister, Venus -- a five-
time winner -- and top seed Caroline Wozniacki of Denmark all
losing in the fourth round, Sabine Lisicki of Germany is
scheduled to meet Marion Bartoli of France on Centre Court,
followed by Dominika Cibulkova of Slovakia against former
champion Maria Sharapova of Russia.  On Court 1, Petra Kvitova of the  Czech Republic  faces
Tsvetana Pironkova of Bulgaria, followed by Tamira Paszek of
Austria against  Victoria Azarenka  of Belarus.  To contact the reporter on this story:
