The  U.S. Senate  confirmed James M. Cole, the No. 2 Justice Department official appointed by
President  Barack Obama  during a congressional recess.  Cole’s confirmation as deputy attorney general, by a 55-42
vote, was a victory for the Obama administration more than a
year after the president nominated him. After Republicans
objected to his nomination, Obama appointed Cole during
Congress’s December recess, allowing him to serve without
confirmation for up to a year. Senate Republicans also blocked a
vote on his confirmation last month.  Obama chose Cole for the position in May 2010. Republicans
had complained that Cole favored treating terrorism suspects as
criminals and trying them in criminal courts instead of holding
them as enemy combatants and using the military justice system.  Cole, 59, was a Justice Department official for 13 years
before entering private practice in 1992. He served as deputy
chief of the department’s  public integrity section , which
handles corruption cases involving public officials. Cole’s law
practice at  Bryan Cave LLP  in  Washington  included advising
companies on securities, regulatory and criminal law matters.  To contact the reporter on this story:
