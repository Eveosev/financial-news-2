Job uncertainty has pushed down
fertility rates in the U.S. and  Europe , where young people
postponed having babies in the midst of a recession, according
to demographic research published today.  The 18-month U.S. recession that ended in June 2009
reversed a decade-long increase in fertility rates in developed
economies, demographer Tomas Sobotka said by telephone from
Vienna. Youth unemployment and government austerity measures
hitting family-support services mean no return to growth is in
sight, said Sobotka, whose research was published in the current
Population and Development Review journal.  “The economic recovery may not be visible for the youngest
generation,” he said. “Budget cuts to family-related
government programs can prolong the effect well beyond the
recession’s end.”  The study shows how the lingering effects of the financial
meltdown, which resulted in the worst economic slump since the
Great Depression, have changed populations. Young and highly
educated women will be more inclined to forgo having children
while unemployed men will have a harder time finding a partner,
according to the study.  Some European countries including Germany, Sweden and
Slovakia bucked the trend by increasing fertility during the
recession. The U.S. was hit harder than most countries.  “The U.S. fertility rate reacted stronger than it did
across most countries in Europe,” said Sobotka, who works with
the Austrian Academy of Sciences and co-directs the  Human
Fertility Database . “The recession there hit earlier and
harder.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
