The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index may
extend its gains from a three-month low to as much as 4.1
percent after a trend measure sent out its first buy signal
since April, according to Craig W. Johnson of Piper Jaffray Cos.  The Moving Average Convergence/Divergence line, calculated
by subtracting the  S&P 500 ’s average level during the past 26
days from the average over the past 12 days, crossed last week
above the “signal line” that plots the 9-day average
difference between the two. That suggests the gain is likely to
continue and help drive the S&P 500 to its 50-day moving
average, or 1,317, said Johnson, a technical market strategist
with Piper Jaffray in  Minneapolis .  “People know the summer doldrums probably won’t carry
through into the fall,” Johnson said in an interview. “They’re
trying to use pullbacks toward the 200-day average as the
opportunity buying stocks.”  The benchmark gauge of U.S. equities posted losses in six
out of the previous seven weeks and had rebounded twice at its
average price during the previous 200 days.  The S&P 500 advanced 0.9 percent to 1,280.10 yesterday,
ending three-day decline and extending its gain to 1.2 percent
from the three-month low on June 15, as regulators issued
capital rules to safeguard the financial system and technology
companies rallied.  Worse-than-expected economic reports and concern about the
debt crisis in  Europe  spurred losses in six consecutive weeks
from April 29 to June 10, the longest streak since July 2008.  Previous Rebounds  Since 1926, there had been 68 occasions when the market
suffered losses for six weeks in a row. Stocks were higher 81
percent of the time in the next four weeks, with gains averaging
1.3 percent, Johnson said.  Following the most recent slump, the S&P 500 rebounded at
its 200-day moving average first on June 16, and again on June
23, a sign that the market found a “major support” at this
threshold, he said.  “This is a good spot to find a relief rally to emerge,”
he said. “Every time the market comes down to this major
support level, investors want to try to be long equities.”  Johnson said he expects the S&P 500 to finish the year at
1,440, with most of the gains coming later this year, in a
“backend-loaded matter.” Wall Street stategists expect the
gauge to end 2011 at 1,400, based on the median of 13 forecasts
in a Bloomberg survey.  Technical analysts study charts of trading patterns and
prices to predict changes in a security, commodity, currency or
index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
