OAO  Uralkali (URKA) , the Russian potash
producer that created a monopoly in the country by merging with
competitor OAO Silvinit, rose the most in more than four months
after Chief Executive Officer Vladislav Baumgertner said spot-
market potash prices may reach $600 a ton by the end of the
year.  The shares jumped 5 percent to 248.06 rubles by the 6:45
p.m. close in Moscow, their strongest gain since Feb. 25.  To contact the reporter on this story:
