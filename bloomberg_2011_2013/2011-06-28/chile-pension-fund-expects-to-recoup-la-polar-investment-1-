AFP Habitat (HABITAT)  SA,  Chile ’s second-
largest pension fund manager, said it expects to recoup its
investment in  Empresas La Polar SA (LAPOLAR) , the retailer under
investigation for consumer-credit irregularities.  Habitat, which manages about $39 billion of assets, has
maintained its minority stake in La Polar even as the stock
tumbled as much as 80 percent after the department-store chain
revealed on June 9 additional loan-loss provisions, Chairman
Jose Antonio Guzman said today in an interview in  London .  La Polar surged as much as a record 38 percent in Santiago
trading today after entrepreneur Alvaro Saieh bought a 10
percent stake and said he may buy more shares pending the
outcome of talks with lenders.  “It’s very good that a controlling shareholder enters the
company to put an extra eye on the administration,” Guzman
said. “We trust that the investment we have will be recovered -
- not immediately, but in the medium term.”  La Polar said this month executives restructured 475
billion pesos ($1 billion) of overdue credit without the consent
of the more than 400,000 customers involved, triggering
regulatory and criminal probes.  La Polar will meet with bondholders tomorrow to discuss
waiving covenants that would accelerate prepayments. That
probably will enable La Polar to avoid defaulting on its debt
payments, Guzman said.  “The company has potential and we are doing all we can as
investors so that the company can be re-established,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
