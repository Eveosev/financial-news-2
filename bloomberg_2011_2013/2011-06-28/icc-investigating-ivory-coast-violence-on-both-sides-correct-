(Corrects spelling of name in first paragraph.)  The  International Criminal Court 
will “focus on crimes of both sides” as it investigates post-
election violence in  Ivory Coast , said Fatou Bensouda, a court
prosecutor.  “The president and the government of Ivory Coast assured
us” of full cooperation, she told reporters after a meeting
with President Alassane Ouattara in Abidjan, the commercial
capital, today.  The court should “investigate in all directions,” said
Gnenema Coulibaly, Ivory Coast’s minister of human rights and
public liberties. “There is nothing to hide.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
