Serbia’s defense exports will be
lower than estimated this year and may total 200 million euros
($285 million) “at best,” Defense Minister Dragan Sutanovac
said.  Exports have been hurt by the situation in  Libya  as it
eliminated plans for a military hospital and technology
transfers there, Sutanovac told reporters in Belgrade today,
without elaborating. Serbia expected defense exports of some 250
million euros this year.  Arms shipments to the North African nation are banned by a
resolution the UN Security Council passed in February, the month
that the insurgency against Muammar Qaddafi’s four-decade rule
began. North Atlantic Treaty Organization-led forces began
attacking Qaddafi loyalists in March.  To contact the reporter on this story:
