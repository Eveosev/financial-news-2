Pope Benedict XVI , who at 84 still
handwrites his speeches rather than use a computer, today used
an  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  iPad to send his first post on Twitter.  The pontiff  tapped in  English on the tablet device: “Dear
Friends, I just launched News.va. Praised be our Lord Jesus
Christ! With my prayers and blessings, Benedictus XVI.”  Within three hours, the pope had more than 15,000
followers, yet was not following anyone.  This is not the first time Benedict has reached out to
cyberspace. The octogenarian pope is already a user of YouTube,
MySpace and Facebook in an effort by the Roman Catholic Church
to lure disenchanted youth into the Church’s fold. Catholics
were overtaken for the first time last year by the world’s 1.1
billion Muslims, according to the Vatican Statistical Yearbook.  The Vatican, the world’s smallest state and home to the
Pope, has flip-flopped between embracing new technologies and
standing by traditions, seeking to reach out to younger
generations without estranging older, more traditional
churchgoers.  Catholics who are more comfortable with technology than
with church sacraments can use a  $1.99 iPhone application , not
endorsed by the Vatican, to help get through the process of
confession. Vatican spokesman  Federico Lombardi  said in February
2009, when the application drew attention, that an iPhone is no
substitute for a priest.  The application, available on Apple Inc.’s iTunes store,
walks users through an examination of their conscience,
including a review of past actions and identification of sins.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
