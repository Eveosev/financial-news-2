Mumias Sugar Co.,  Kenya ’s biggest
maker of the sweetener, fell for the fourth day on concern its
production may be below target due to drought.  The stock declined 3.5 percent to 7 shillings as of 11:43
a.m. in Nairobi, the capital. A close at this level would be the
weakest since January 2010.  “We all know there has been drought and maybe they won’t
received the expected crop yield and sugar production,” Victor
Odendo, an investment manager at Nairobi-based CIC Asset
Management Ltd., said in a phone interview today.  Kenyan President Mwai Kibaki declared a drought affecting
various parts of the East African country a national disaster on
May 30 and ordered immediate steps be taken to help affected
people and livestock.  To contact the reporter on this story:
