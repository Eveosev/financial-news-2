CEZ AS (CEZ) , the Czech Republic’s biggest
power utility, may improve its finances as a plan in neighboring
 Germany  to give up nuclear energy will likely boost electricity
prices, according to Moody’s Investors Service.  A permanent shutdown of the oldest atomic power stations in
Germany is “credit positive” for CEZ’s senior unsecured rating
of A2, Moody’s wrote in an e-mailed report dated yesterday.  CEZ shares rose 20 percent in the two months after Germany
closed seven reactors for a safety review on March 15 following
 Japan ’s Fukushima nuclear disaster, sending European electricity
prices soaring. Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government last month
said the plants will stay offline and the country will shut down
all nuclear reactors by 2022.  “Germany would have to become a net importer, electricity
prices would increase and the opportunity for higher export
sales and increased margins would arise for electricity
generators with a long-generation position, such as CEZ,”
Moody’s wrote in the report.  CEZ shares increased 0.2 percent to 854 koruna as of 4 p.m.
in  Prague  after falling 2.7 percent yesterday to its lowest
close in more than three months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
