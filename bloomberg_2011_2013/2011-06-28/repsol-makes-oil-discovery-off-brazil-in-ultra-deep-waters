Repsol YPF SA (REP) , Spain’s largest oil
driller, said it discovered two levels of “good quality” oil
in the Gavea exploration well off  Brazil .  A venture between Repsol and China’s Sinopec is the
operator of the project in Brazil’s Campos Basin with a 35
percent stake, Madrid-based Repsol said today in an e-mailed
statement.  Statoil ASA (STL)  of Norway holds a 35 percent stake and
Brazil’s  Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4)  owns 30 percent.  The well was drilled at a water depth of 2,708 meters
(8,885 feet) and reached a final depth of 6,851 meters, the
statement said.  Repsol is investing in exploration in  Brazil ’s Santos and
Espirito Santo basins as well as in other countries as it tries
to increase output while seeking to reduce stakes in mature
fields in  Argentina .  Sinopec, as  China  Petrochemical Corp. in known, last year
agreed to invest $7.1 billion in Repsol’s Brazilian unit as the
Spanish company raises funds for offshore projects. Sinopec
Group holds 40 percent of the venture.  Repsol forecasts annual production growth of as much as 4
percent through 2014 as projects in Brazil and Peru start
production. Repsol plans to invest 28 billion euros ($40
billion) in the period 2010 to 2014, developing fields in
Venezuela, Bolivia and Algeria. It will invest about 6 billion
euros this year and its drilling plan for 2011 includes 25 to 30
exploration and evaluation wells, Repsol said in a Feb. 24
presentation.  The Spanish company’s reserve replacement ratio rose to 131
percent last year from 94 percent in 2009. Repsol has estimated
a ratio of more than 110 percent in the next five years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
