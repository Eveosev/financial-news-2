Roche Holding AG (ROG) ’s Tarceva was
rejected by U.K. health-spending regulators as a treatment for
keeping the most common form of  lung cancer  at bay because the
drug didn’t extend patients’ lives enough to justify the cost.  Roche didn’t prove that the drug, also known as erlotinib,
could prolong a life by at least three months, researchers at
the  National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence  said
in an article published online today in  The Lancet Oncology .  Estimates of the medicine’s cost ranged from 47,000 pounds
($75,200) per additional year of life to more than 50,000
pounds, exceeding the institute’s usual upper annual limit of
30,000 pounds, according to the report by Fiona Rinaldi, a
technical adviser at the London-based regulator; NICE Associate
Director Elizabeth George; and Peter Clark, chairman of the
independent appraisal committee.  To contact the reporter on this story:
