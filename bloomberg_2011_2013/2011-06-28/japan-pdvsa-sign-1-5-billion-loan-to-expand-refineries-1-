Petroleos de  Venezuela  SA, the state
oil company known as PDVSA, received a $1.5 billion loan to
expand two refineries from a group of banks led by the Japan
Bank for International Cooperation.  The 15-year loan, with an interest of 3.8 percent above
Libor, is repayable in cash or oil, Energy Minister  Rafael Ramirez  said today at a ceremony in Caracas. Should PDVSA opt to
repay the loan in oil,  Mitsubishi Corp. (8058)  and  Itochu Corp. (8001)  will
handle the sales, he said.  Venezuela, where refinery output has been hurt by outages
this year, will use the funds to expand processing at the El
Palito refinery to 280,000 barrels a day from 140,000 barrels,
Ramirez said. The Puerto La Cruz refinery will be upgraded to
process 210,000 barrels a day from its current capacity of
180,000 barrels.  “Both refineries are being upgraded to process heavy crude
from the Orinoco heavy crude belt," Ramirez said. ‘‘We’re
adapting to our production reality for the next 100 years.’’  PDVSA has been sending about 2 million barrels of oil a
year to  Japan  to repay a 2007 loan for $3.5 billion, according
to the Asian nation’s embassy in Caracas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
