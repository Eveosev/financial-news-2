CJ Group, owner of  South Korea ’s
biggest foodmaker, was named preferred bidder for a $936 million
controlling stake in the nation’s biggest logistics company,
beating a rival Posco-Samsung Group offer.  Korea Express Co.’s two largest shareholders, Asiana
Airlines Inc. and Daewoo Engineering & Construction Co., will
next month sign a preliminary agreement to sell a stake of about
40 percent, sale arranger  Korea Development Bank  said in an e-
mailed statement today. It didn’t say how much was bid.  The Seoul-based transport company slid 15 percent on the
city’s stock exchange on concerns it would get less business
from CJ Group than it would have gained from Posco, South
Korea’s biggest steelmaker. The bidders were vying for control
of a company with terminals in South Korea’s biggest ports,
10,000 express-delivery outlets and more than 5,000 trucks.  “This is definitely a huge surprise,” said Kim Min Jeong,
an analyst at KTB Securities Co. in  Seoul . “It was very obvious
that the best synergy would come with  Posco (005490)  being the owner.”  CJ Group offered about 2 trillion won ($1.85 billion),
Korea Economic Daily reported, without saying how it got the
information. Korea Express closed at 111,000 won, giving it a
market value of $2.34 billion, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  CJ Cheiljedang Corp. (097950) , the maker of Cheiljedang sugar, and a
unit of CJ Corp. will each pay for half the Korea Express stake,
the group said in a regulatory filing, without giving a value
for the deal.  CJ Cheiljedang fell 7.6 percent, the biggest decline since
March 2009, to close at 250,000 won in Seoul trading. CJ Corp.
tumbled 9.9 percent to 73,000 won.  CJ Group will use Samsung Life Insurance Co. shares and
non-core assets to help fund the acquisition, it said in an e-
mailed statement today, without elaboration. CJ Cheiljedang and
 CJ Corp. (001040)  own a combined 5.5 percent in Samsung Life, South
Korea’s biggest life insurer.  The group’s other investments include a TV shopping
network, an animal-feed maker, a cinema chain and Korean outlets
for ice-cream seller Cold Stone Creamery.  To contact the reporters on this story:
