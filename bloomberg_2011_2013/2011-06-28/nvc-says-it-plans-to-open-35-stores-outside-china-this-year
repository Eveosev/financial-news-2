NVC Lighting Holdings Ltd. (2222)  plans to
open 30 retail outlets and five franchised stores in  Asia  this
year as it expands outside its home market, the chief executive
officer said.  The company will set up franchise outlets in  Cambodia ,  India ,
Myanmar and Saudi Arabia, founder and CEO Wu Changjiang said in
an interview with Bloomberg on June 24. NVC, based in Huizhou,
Guangdong, will also look for acquisitions in markets including
Australia, Italy and the U.S., he said.  “We will move China’s successful model to emerging markets
like India and Brazil by franchising and own-brand selling,” Wu
said, “But for the developed areas, I prefer to acquire local
companies with market value of about 500 million yuan.”  The company’s overseas business may contribute 50 percent
of total revenue in the long term compared with about 20 percent
now, as it increases the number of franchise stores in  China  to
3,000 from 2,810, Wu said.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  has a “buy” rating on the company,
which it says is China’s largest lighting-product maker, and a
12-month share-price estimate of HK$5, according to a  report 
published June 7.  NVC was unchanged at HK$3.91 as of 2:58 p.m. in Hong Kong
trading. The shares have lost 3.9 percent this year, compared
with a 4.4 percent decline in the benchmark Hang Seng Index.  The Goldman report said the company’s gross profit margin
may rise 40 percent a year to 2013 because of the popularity of
the company’s brand and increasing revenue from light emitting
diode products.  For Related News and Information:  ---Editors: Stan James, Hwee-ann Tan  To contact the reporter on this story
