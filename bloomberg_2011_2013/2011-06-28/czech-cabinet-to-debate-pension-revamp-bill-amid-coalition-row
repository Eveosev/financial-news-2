The Czech government will debate
tomorrow a draft law overhauling the pension system and boosting
private savings for retirement as the three ruling parties argue
over Cabinet posts and budget spending.  The bill, allowing people to redirect part of compulsory
pension payments into personal accounts managed by pension
funds, is one of the main goals for Prime Minister Petr Necas’s
Cabinet. Plans including an overhaul of the deficit-making pay-
as-you-go pension system and a reduction of the budget gap
helped Czech bonds outperform German debt in the past year.  “Although the deficits of the pension system wouldn’t
exceed 1 percent of gross domestic product in the next 20 years
without substantial changes, they would later reach about 4
percent without reform measures,” according to the draft posted
on the website of the Prague-based government today.  Tensions inside the coalition increased this week after
Necas’s Civic Democrats and the TOP09 party rejected a demand by
the smallest coalition member, Public Affairs, to guarantee
money for teachers’ salaries and transportation infrastructure
in the 2012 budget. The coalition is nearing a June 30 deadline
Public Affairs gave Necas to meet its demands or the party will
leave the Cabinet and strip it of its parliamentary majority.  Necas, who last year assembled the largest majority in
parliament since independence in 1993, pledged to cut the
public-finance shortfall to less than the European Union limit
of 3 percent of economic output, calling the overhaul of the
pension and health-care systems the key goals for his Cabinet.
The government plans to narrow the gap to 3.5 percent of GDP in
2012 from the planned 4.2 percent in 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
