Temperatures may reach into the
upper 90s Fahrenheit (30s Celsius) across the U.S. East and
Midwest over the weekend and into the July Fourth holiday, said
 Matt Rogers , president of Commodity Weather Group LLC.  The U.S. South and West will also experience warmer-than-
normal weather for the July 3 to July 7 period, he said. The
heat in those areas will moderate from July 8 to July 12,
according to Rogers.  Natural-gas traders monitor weather forecasts to determine
whether temperatures may boost heating or cooling demand.
Futures gained for a second day in  New York  yesterday on
forecasts of hot weather in the South and Midwest.  Heat gripping Texas, the southern Plains and Southwest will
continue through the rest of the week, according to Rogers.  Amarillo, Texas, set an all-time temperature record of 111
degrees on June 26, breaking the mark of 109 set two days
earlier, according to the  National Weather Service  in Lubbock,
 Texas . After a high today of 99, temperatures are expected to
reach past 100 again starting tomorrow and through the weekend,
the weather service said.  Highs in the 100s throughout the week are also forecast for
 Fort Worth , Texas; Tulsa, Oklahoma; and  Oklahoma City .  Rogers said an area of disturbed weather in the Bay of
Campeche off the eastern Mexican coast doesnâ€™t pose a threat to
U.S. energy interests. The National Hurricane Center said the
system has a 50 percent chance of becoming a tropical system in
the next two days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
