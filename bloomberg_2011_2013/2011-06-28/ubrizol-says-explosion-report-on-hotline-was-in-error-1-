Lubrizol Corp. (LZ) , the chemical maker
being acquired by  Warren Buffett ’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc., said
it was in error in reporting on a community hotline that there
had been an explosion at its plant in Bayport, Texas.  There was no blast at the site, Mark Sutherland, a
spokesman for Wickliffe, Ohio-based Lubrizol, said today in a
telephone interview. The erroneous message at 2 p.m. local time
was posted today to the Community Awareness Emergency Response
hotline serving east Harris County. The message was intended as
an internal company test, Sutherland said.  “It was a test with an inadvertent disclosure,”
Sutherland said. “How it got outside, I don’t know.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
