Trafigura Beheer BV failed to sell
North Sea Forties crude for a second day. Royal Dutch Shell Plc
sought to buy Russian Urals in northwest  Europe  without success.  Sytrol,  Syria ’s state-run oil company, will cut daily
exports of Souedie crude for loading in July from its
Mediterranean port Tartous by 37 percent, according to a
shipping schedule seen by Bloomberg News.  North Sea  Trafigura was unable to sell Forties at 40 cents a barrel
below Dated Brent for loading July 9 to July 11 or July 13 to
July 15, according to a survey of traders and brokers monitoring
the Platts trading window. Trafigura made the same offer
yesterday.  Statoil ASA didn’t manage to sell a consignment of Forties
for July 11 to July 13 at 30 cents below Dated Brent, and Shell
failed to sell a shipment at the same price for July 10 to July
12, the survey showed.  Reported  North Sea  market activity typically occurs during
the Platts window, which ends at 4:30 p.m. London time. Before
the window, Forties loading in 10 to 21 days was 39 cents below
Dated Brent, compared with a discount of 28 cents yesterday,
according to Bloomberg data.  Brent for August settlement traded at $107.86 a barrel on
the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange at the close of the
window, up from $104.97 yesterday. The September contract was at
$107.79, 7 cents less than August.  Mediterranean/Urals  Shell didn’t manage to buy 100,000 metric tons of Urals for
July 8 to July 12 delivery to Rotterdam at $2.20 a barrel below
Dated Brent. No bids or offers were made in the Mediterranean.  The July program for Souedie, also known as Syrian Heavy,
comprises four 80,000-ton cargoes and two shipments of 35,000
tons. That’s equivalent to 2.7 million barrels, or 87,058
barrels a day, compared with 137,247 barrels a day in June.  The company will also ship one 80,000-ton consignment of
Syrian Light in July from Banias terminal in the Mediterranean,
one less than June.  OAO Rosneft awarded its Urals crude tenders for seven
cargoes of 100,000 tons each loading in July from the Baltic Sea
port of Primorsk to Total SA and Shell, according to three
traders who participate in the market. Total was awarded four
cargoes and Shell three, they said.  West Africa  Nigeria benchmark Qua Iboe was offered at around $2.20 a
barrel over Dated Brent without attracting any buying interest,
said traders involved in the transactions of the region’s oil.  Ghana will ship three cargoes of Jubilee crude in August,
unchanged from July, according to a loading program. All
shipments are for 950,000 barrels each.  To contact the reporter on this story:
