Germany ’s Bundesbank placed
conditions on involving German banks in a Greek rescue,
 Sueddeutsche Zeitung  reported, citing the institute’s board
member Joachim Nagel.  In no way must “the participation of private creditors
lead to a higher burden for public budgets,” the newspaper
cited Nagel as saying. The banks’ involvement must be completely
voluntary and shouldn’t be viewed as a payment shortfall by the
 ratings agencies , according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
