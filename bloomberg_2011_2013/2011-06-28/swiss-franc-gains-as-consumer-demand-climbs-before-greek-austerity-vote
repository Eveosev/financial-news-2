The Swiss franc rose against the
euro as investors sought a haven before Greek lawmakers vote on
more austerity and consumer demand in Switzerland increased in
May, fueling bets the economy can withstand currency gains.  Switzerland’s currency climbed to a record versus the
dollar. A gauge of consumption rose to 1.91, the highest since
August 2010, from a revised 1.57 in April, Zurich-based UBS AG
said in an e-mailed statement today. Greek Prime Minister  George Papandreou  called on lawmakers to obey their “patriotic
conscience” as they began yesterday to debate a five-year
budget plan that’s needed to access more financial aid.  “It seems that the Swiss economy continued to do well,”
said  Daragh Maher , deputy head of global foreign exchange
strategy at Credit Agricole CIB in  London . “When you are
getting good Swiss numbers and nervousness about  Greece , it adds
to the case for buying the franc.”  The Swiss currency strengthened 0.1 percent to 1.1924
francs per euro as of 5:17 p.m. in London, leaving it 3 percent
stronger this month. It advanced to 1.18064 on June 24, the
strongest level since the euro’s 1999 debut. The franc gained
0.6 percent to 83.02 centimes per dollar.  Switzerland ’s legal tender has surged 16 percent in the
past year, the best performer among 10 developed-market
currencies tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Currency
Indexes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
