Korea Express Co. fell in  Seoul 
trading after Lotte Group dropped its bid for a controlling
stake in the country’s largest logistics company.  Korea Express lost 1.2 percent to 129,000 won as of 10:19
a.m. in Seoul, the lowest intraday level since June 23, after
declining as much as 4.2 percent. The nation’s benchmark Kospi
index advanced 1.3 percent.  Asiana Airlines Inc. and Daewoo Engineering & Construction
Co., the biggest shareholders of Korea Express, plan to sell
about 40 percent of the Seoul-based company. Posco,  South
Korea ’s largest steelmaker, and  Samsung SDS Co. , a unit of the
nation’s biggest industrial group, submitted a bid yesterday, as
did foodmaker CJ Group.  “More buyers would have meant higher bidding prices for
Korea Express,” said Jung Yun Jin, an analyst at Kyobo
Securities Co. in Seoul, said by telephone. “Finding a buyer
will help Korea Express grow its businesses.”  The Posco-Samsung Group offered to pay more than 170,000
won a share for about 40 percent of Korea Express, Maeil
Business Newspaper said, citing a senior  Posco (005490)  official it
didn’t identify. That’s 30 percent more than yesterday’s closing
price of 130,500 won. CJ Group didn’t reveal its offer.  Korea Express has terminals in South Korea’s busiest ports,
a nationwide network of about 10,000 express-delivery outlets
and a fleet of more than 5,000 trucks, according to its  website .
The company also operates small bulk carriers and barges.  Korea Development Bank  and Nomura Holdings Inc. are
arranging the sale.  To contact the reporters on this story:
