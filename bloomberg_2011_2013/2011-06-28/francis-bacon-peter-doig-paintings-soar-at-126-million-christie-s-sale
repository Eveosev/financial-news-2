Works by  Francis Bacon , Peter Doig
and  Lucian Freud  helped Christie’s International raise 78.8
million pounds ($126 million) at an auction in London last
night. It was the company’s highest total for a sale of
contemporary works in the U.K. capital since June 2008.  The top seller was Bacon’s “Study for a Portrait,” a
precursor of the Irish-born artist’s “Pope” paintings, offered
by the Swiss entrepreneur and collector Donald M. Hess. The
painting sold to a telephone bidder represented by Christie’s
specialist Sandra Nedvetskaia, who deals with Russian clients,
for 18 million pounds, against two other telephone bidders. The
1953 work was estimated at about 11 million pounds.  The above-estimate price contrasted with the failure of
Bacon’s similar 1954 painting, “Man in Blue VI,” estimated at
4 million pounds to 5 million pounds, at Christie’s in February
2009 during the financial crisis.  “Bacon is back,”  Offer Waterman , a London-based dealer,
said. “The market is strong, though with problems like  Greece ,
it could fall out of bed in two minutes. At the moment, there
are people with plenty of cash who are investing in art as an
asset class.”  Christie’s 65-lot offering had carried an estimate of 55.3
million pounds to 76.8 million pounds and was part of a series
of evening sales in London that is estimated to raise as much as
195 million pounds, reflecting renewed confidence among sellers
of high-value contemporary works.  While the mood in the market was lifted by dealers
reporting plentiful sales in the $200,000 to $2 million-range
earlier this month at the Art Basel fair in  Switzerland ,
auctions remain the arena where international collectors are
most prepared to spend multimillion sums.  Doig’s Surprise  The surprise of the evening was the 6.2 million pounds paid
by another telephone bidder, represented by Christie’s U.K.
chairman David Linley, for Doig’s 2003 to 2004 West Indian
landscape, “Red Boat” (Imaginary Boys),” estimated at 1.4
million pounds to 1.8 million pounds.  The subject of a recently-resolved dispute between Carnegie
Museum trustee James H. Rich and the  New York  and  Germany  based
Michael Werner Gallery, it had been bought by Rich for $162,000 
seven years ago. The painting was underbid in the room by London 
dealer Jay Jopling.  Another telephone bidder, competing against a third-party
guarantor, gave 7 million pounds for  Andy Warhol ’s 1973
silkscreen painting, “Mao,” a work estimated at 6 million
pounds to 8 million pounds.  A 1958-1959 Freud portrait of his lover Suzy Boyt sold for
4.7 million pounds against an estimate of 3.5 million pounds to
4.5 million pounds. Entered by a descendant of the late Simon
Sainsbury, “Woman Smiling” was bought by a telephone bidder.  Saatchi’s Rabbit  The same buyer paid 1 million pounds -- more than double
the 400,000-pound upper estimate -- for a 1944 Freud colored
drawing of dead rabbit on a chair. The work was one of seven
from the collection of Kay Saatchi, the ex-wife of the collector
 Charles Saatchi , that raised 4 million pounds.  “Freud drawings are rare,” said London-based dealer 
 Stephen Ongpin , who paid 193,250 pounds for an ex-Saatchi 1944
sketch by the artist of a cat. “They've been undervalued in the
past simply because you don't see them.”  Saatchi’s “Big Baby,” a 3-foot-high 1996 sculpture by the
Australian-born artist Ron Mueck, was one of the night’s five
artist records. It sold on the telephone for 825,250 pounds
against an estimate of 600,000 pounds to 800,000 pounds.  Academy's Sensation  The piece was one of seven hyper-realist sculptures by 
Mueck owned by the Saatchis, who co-curated the “Sensation” show 
of young artists at the  Royal Academy  of Arts in 1997.  Christie’s total with fees exceeded the sale’s high
estimate of 76.8 million pounds, based on hammer prices.
Eighteen percent of the lots were rejected, usually because 
they'd recently been seen in dealers' galleries.   Two canvases by Chris Ofili failed against low estimates of 
900,000 pounds and 500,000 pounds respectively. The more 
expensive of the two, the 2002 work ``Afro Red Web,'' had been 
guaranteed by Christie's itself.  ``There were some works that had recently been with 
dealers, and people knew this,'' the Dusseldorf gallerist  Paul 
Schoenewald  said. ``The fresh material did well.''  The equivalent event last year raised 45.6 million pounds 
from 52 lots with a selling rate of 84 percent.  Earlier, buyers also cherry-picked the private lots when
Christie’s offered 99 works of art from the personal collection
of the author Jeffrey Archer, as well as pieces from the
recently closed Neffe Degandt Gallery, Mayfair, with whom the
author had a business partnership. Half the material sold,
raising a total of 5.1 million pounds.  The most successful lot was Archer’s 1878 Claude Monet
painting, “La Seine pres de Vetheuil, temps orageux,” which
reached 3.1 million pounds against an estimate of as much as 1.7
million pounds.  (Scott Reyburn writes about the art market for Muse, the
