Polskie Gornictwo Naftowe i
Gazownictwo SA (PGN) , Poland’s dominant gas company, and  FX Energy
Inc. (FXEN)  will start drilling an exploration well in August on the
Polish Kutno license,  Parkiet  reported, without citing anyone.  The deposit’s structure is similar to those in the
Netherlands and the North Sea near the U.K., countries which are
Western Europe’s main gas producers after Norway, the newspaper
said, citing Piotr Gliniak, head of PGNiG’s exploration
department.  PGNiG and FX Energy last year signed a joint operating
agreement under which the Polish company has a 50 interest in
the block, for which the Salt Lake City-based company is the
operator.  To contact the reporter on this story:
