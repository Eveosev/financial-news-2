Max Property Group Plc (MAX) , the property
investment company set up by entrepreneur Nick Leslau, and a
family trust agreed to buy St. Katharine Docks near London’s
Tower Bridge for 156.3 million pounds ($250 million).  The  10-acre site , which has a 160-berth marina and 500,000
square feet (46,000 square meters) of offices, shops and
restaurants, generates an annual rental income of 12.6 million
pounds, according to a statement from Jersey-registered Max
Property. The purchase is scheduled to complete before Aug. 8.  Leslau plans to refurbish the properties, which have a
vacancy rate of 12 percent, to boost rental income as occupiers
look for cheaper  office space . St. Katharine Docks is on the
edge of the City of  London  financial district, adjacent to the
Tower of London.  “People are prepared to go elsewhere and not just stay in
the Square Mile,” Leslau said in a telephone interview,
referring to  City of London . “It’s difficult to imagine a more
beautiful place to work and live in central London.”  Max Property will manage St. Katharine Docks for
investment partner Newmarket Property Holdings Ltd., which is
owned by an unidentified South African family’s trust. Their
venture, in which Max Property will have a 60 percent stake, is
funding 55 percent of the purchase with a loan from Eurohypo AG.  The property was sold following a default on a 170 million-
pound loan by the owners, AREA Property Partners LLP
and F&C REIT Asset Management Plc. The securitized loan was
placed in special servicing in May 2010 after the value of the
property fell to 116 million pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
