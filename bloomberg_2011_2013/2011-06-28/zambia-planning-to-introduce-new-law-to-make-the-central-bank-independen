Zambia’s central bank is planning a
new law to make it independent from the government, Mathew
Chisunka, the bank’s secretary, said.  The move will probably make the Bank of Zambia “more
efficient” as it won’t have to seek advice from the government,
Chisunka said in an interview published in the Lusaka-based Post
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
