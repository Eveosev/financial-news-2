Relief pitcher Ryan Madson was
placed on the 15-day disabled list by the  Philadelphia Phillies 
because of a bruised right hand.  Madson has a 3-1 record with a 2.03 earned run average this
Major League Baseball season, converting 15 of 16 save
opportunites.  The Phillies, who announced the move in a news release,
open a series with the  Boston Red Sox  tonight in Philadelphia.
The team said the assignment of the right-hander to the disabled
list was retroactive to June 19.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
