Major banks in Asia Pacific are in
“good health” by global standards even as a property market
correction and inflation pressure threaten their  credit quality ,
according to  Standard & Poor’s .  Lenders in China and India can better manage potential
risks at their current credit-rating levels, while those in
Japan are most susceptible to negative pressure, S&P said in a
report today. None of the 40 largest banks in the region has a
“negative” ratings outlook, according to the report.  “Asia-Pacific’s major banks generally demonstrated
resilience during the global financial crisis, with the sector
performing satisfactory overall,” S&P analysts led by Gavin Gunning wrote. “That said, the balance remains delicately poised
for some of Asia-Pacific’s major banks in terms of defending
credit standings at the current rating levels.”  Soaring food and oil prices have prompted Asian policy
makers to increase borrowing costs and allow currency gains to
contain inflation, even as a slowing regional expansion and
budget woes in the U.S. and  Europe  threaten global growth.  The People’s Bank of China this month ordered banks to set
aside more deposits as reserves, while India raised  interest
rates  for the 10th time since the start of 2010 and signaled it
will continue to tighten policy.  --Luo Jun. Editors: Russell Ward, James Gunsalus  To contact Bloomberg News staff of this story:
