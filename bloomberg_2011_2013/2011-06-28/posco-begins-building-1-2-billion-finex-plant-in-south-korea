Posco (005490) , the world’s third-largest
steelmaker, said it began building a 1.3 trillion won ($1.2
billion) plant at its Pohang works, southeast of capital Seoul.  The plant, to be completed by June 2013, will use Finex
technology to produce as much as 2 million metric tons of crude
steel annually, the Pohang, South Korea-based company said in an
e-mailed statement today. Finex technology allows the use of
cheaper and lower quality iron ore and coal.  The plant will be Posco’s third based on Finex technology
and enable the company to save manufacturing costs of 177.2
billion won a year, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
