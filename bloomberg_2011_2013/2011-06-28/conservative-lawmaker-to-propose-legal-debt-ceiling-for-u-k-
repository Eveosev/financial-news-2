A lawmaker from Prime Minister  David Cameron ’s  Conservative Party  will propose introducing a U.S.-
style legal cap on U.K. government debt to prevent a repeat of
the buildup since the financial crisis.  Sajid Javid, a former managing director at Deutsche Bank
AG, will say today that the net debt ceiling should be set at 40
percent of gross domestic product. He will make the call in
Parliament, according to a statement released by his office.  “There are too many temptations on politicians to buy now,
pay later,” Jahid said. “Done in excess, this isn’t just
economically wrong but morally wrong too.”  The proposal would introduce a straitjacket on the
government’s ability to borrow similar to that in the U.S. The
 House of Representatives  this month voted down proposals to
extend the debt limit by $2.4 trillion.  Javid said the Treasury in the U.K. should set the ceiling
and spell out plans to bring down the debt level. Net debt is
forecast to rise to 60 percent of GDP in the current fiscal year
and reach 71 percent by 2014, according to the U.K. budget
watchdog.  To contact the reporters on this story:
