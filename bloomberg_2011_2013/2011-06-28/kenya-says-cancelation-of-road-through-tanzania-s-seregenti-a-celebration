Kenyan Tourism Minister Najib Balala
welcomed neighboring  Tanzania ’s decision to cancel construction
of a road through the Serengeti National Park, after
environmentalists said it would devastate animal migrations.  “I think this is the biggest celebration we have had in the
conservation world,” Balala told reporters in Kenya’s capital,
Nairobi, today.  Tanzanian Natural Resources and Tourism Minister Ezekiel
Maige signaled the planned tarmac highway would not be built at
a Unesco World Heritage committee meeting in Paris, according to
an e-mailed statement from the U.K.-based  Royal Society for the
Protection of Birds  dated June 24.  The proposed asphalt highway would have disrupted the
annual migration of 2 million zebras and wildebeest, also known
as gnus, between Tanzania and  Kenya , environmentalists including
the  Wildlife Conservation Society , based in  New York , and the
 Zoological Society of London , said. The movement of the
herbivores results from herds following rainfall in search of
grazing, according to conservationists.  The Serengeti is designated a  United Nations Educational,
Scientific and Cultural Organization’s World Heritage Site  and
attracts as many as 90,000 tourists every year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
