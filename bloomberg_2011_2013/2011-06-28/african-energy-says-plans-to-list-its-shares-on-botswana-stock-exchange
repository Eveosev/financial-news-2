African Energy Resources Ltd. (AFR)  plans
to sell shares on Botswana’s stock exchange within the next
three weeks, Charles Frazer Tabeart, the Perth-based company’s
managing director, said.  The application for the dual listing has already been
submitted, Tabeart said at a minerals conference today in
Gaborone, Botswana’s capital.  The company expects to start producing coal at its Sese
project in 2014, he said. It plans to mine about 600,000 metric
tons of coal a year, Tabeart said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
