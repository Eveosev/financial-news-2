Cash premiums for corn shipped in
June to terminals near  New Orleans  rose relative to Chicago
futures as farmers withheld inventories because wet weather is
threatening this year’s crop. Soybean premiums were unchanged.  The spot-basis bid, or premium, for corn delivered this
month was 63 cents a bushel above July futures, up from 62 cents
to 63 cents yesterday, U.S. Department of Agriculture  data  show.
The average spot basis is 42 percent higher than a year earlier.
The soybean basis was unchanged at 72 cents to 76 cents a bushel
above the July contract.  “Farmers are waiting to see how the rest of the growing
season fares for this year’s crop before selling any more corn”
from inventories left from the 2010 harvest, said Hugh Whalen, a
risk consultant at  Mid-Co Commodities Inc.  in Bloomington,
 Illinois . “Soybean demand is pretty quiet.”  Corn futures for July delivery jumped 22.25 cents, or 3.4
percent, to $6.83 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, on
concerns that adverse weather has reduced the yield potential of
this year’s crop. Soybean futures for July delivery gained 1
cent, or 0.1 percent, to $13.3075 a bushel on the CBOT.  To contact the reporter on this story:
