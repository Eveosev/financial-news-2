The  Mumbai  Police announced June 27 that they had finally  cracked the case  of the murder of the crime journalist Jyotirmoy Dey, who was  gunned down  in a Mumbai suburb in broad daylight on June 11. Dey (who wrote under the byline “ J Dey ”) was the intrepid, muckraking crime and investigations editor for the Mumbai tabloid  Mid Day  and widely admired and loved in journalistic circles. The police arrested seven men from across the country. The chief suspect in the brazen assassination, which rattled the city’s press corps, was said to be a notorious gangster,  Chhota Rajan  (“Little Rajan”). Rajan is one of several figures who ran criminal rackets in the city before they were driven out of the country by police crackdowns. Many of them, including Rajan, now run their operations from bases abroad. The motive behind the killing was still unclear, especially since no members of the press were targeted by the underworld during its heyday in the nineties, when shootouts between gangs, assassinations of businessmen who refused the demands of extortionists, and “encounter killings” of gangsters by cops were almost an everyday occurrence. The details of Dey’s murder were reported by his colleagues on the crime beat, many of them his protégés. Sagnik Chowdhury reported in The  Indian Express : That Dey was thought to be so dangerous to vested interests that he had to be bumped off was a tribute to the quality and persistence of his reporting, as well as a sign of the continuing influence of the underworld and the size and strength of the parallel economy in India’s financial capital. Dey had himself done a great deal to document the character, methods and strongholds of these forces. In a report from 2009 describing how the underworld had infiltrated the city’s economy,  he wrote : In recent months Dey had published an  exhaustive report , chockfull of names, showing the presence of a sizeable trade in smuggled  diesel fuel  on the seas off Mumbai. For this reason, the oil-smuggling mafia had initially been suspected in his death. In May, after the killing of  Osama bin Laden  by U.S. forces in  Pakistan , Dey published a provocative report on the underworld don Dawood Ibrahim, wanted in India for his role in the  Mumbai bomb blasts of 1993 , and for many years a resident of Karachi. The report was titled “ Osama’s Death Means Dawood Lives Longer ,” and suggested: In the days that followed Dey’s assassination there was widespread scepticism in the press about the Mumbai Police’s ability to crack the case. Journalists pressed instead for an inquiry by the  Central Bureau of Investigation  (CBI), an indication of the city’s dwindling faith in the keepers of law and order and in the Maharashtra government. Writing in the Hindustan Times, a paper where Dey once worked, the journalist  Ayaz Memon  explained: And in a piece in The Hindu called “ Now, An Endangered Press ,” Sevanti Ninan wrote: One of the most restrained and reasoned responses to Dey’s murder came from Mid Day’s editor Sachin Kalbag. In a piece titled “ Who Killed Our J. Dey ?”, published the day after his death, Kalbag went against the tide of popular opinion by giving a clean chit to the police: The vivid and affectionate tributes to Dey published by journalists who knew him ( here ,  here , and  here ) indicate that he knew more about the city and its secret vortexes of power than almost anybody else. It seemed fair to conclude that in losing Dey, India’s most storied city had lost something of itself. (Chandrahas Choudhury is the New Delhi correspondent for the World View blog.
