The U.S. defeated  North Korea  2-0 in
their opening game at soccer’s women’s World Cup in Germany, as
Sweden defeated Colombia 1-0.  Lauren Cheney and Rachel Buehler scored in the second half
for the U.S. in Dresden. Jessica Landstrom’s goal in the 57th
minute gave Sweden the win in Leverkusen.  The U.S. and Sweden have three points in Group C, while
Colombia and North Korea have none. The two-time champion
Americans play Colombia and North Korea meets Sweden in the next
Group C games on July 2.  Governing body FIFA said today that Yineth Varon, a
goalkeeper for Colombia, had been provisionally suspended after
a positive dope test. The “out-of-competition” doping control
was carried out in Leverkusen on June 25, FIFA said, without
identifying the substance.  Play opens in Group D tomorrow as  Brazil  plays Australia in
Moenchengladbach and 1995 champion Norway meets Equatorial
Guinea in Augsburg.  The 16 teams are split into four groups with the top two in
each progressing to the quarterfinals. The final of the four-
yearly  soccer tournament  is on July 17.  To contact the reporter on this story:
