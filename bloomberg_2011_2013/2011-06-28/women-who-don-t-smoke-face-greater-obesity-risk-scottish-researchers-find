Women who have never smoked face a
higher risk of being overweight or obese than those who light
up, according to a  study  by Scottish researchers in today’s
British Medical Journal.  The findings from the study of 3,613 Scottish women who
were followed for 28 years suggest that higher smoking rates
decades ago masked the true extent of obesity, the researchers
wrote.  Declines  in tobacco use in industrialized countries since
the early 1970s may help explain the increase in the number of
people who are overweight or obese, they said.  The study also concluded that obesity was more prevalent in
poorer women, who had higher death rates from related
conditions, than in wealthier ones. Women in the study who
avoided smoking and kept their weight in check had the lowest
death rates, regardless of whether they were rich or poor.  “There is a general sense that if you live on the wrong
side of the tracks, you are bound to be less healthy,” Laurence
Gruer, the lead researcher and  director  of public health science
for NHS Health Scotland in Glasgow, said in a telephone
interview. “This shows that’s not necessarily the case.”  Nicotine, a stimulant found in tobacco, may eventually
explain more about the relationship between smoking and obesity
rates, Gruer said. Nicotine appears to suppress the appetite of
some smokers and may play a role in why some people who quit
smoking go on to gain weight, he said.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
