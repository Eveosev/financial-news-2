The United Association of  South
Africa , a labor union, said a strike is “looming” in the
country’s metals and engineering industries after worker and
employer groups failed to reach agreement over wages.  While UASA has reduced its demand for salary increases to
10 percent from 13 percent, most employer organizations have
only raised their offers to 7 percent, the labor union said in
an e-mailed statement today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
