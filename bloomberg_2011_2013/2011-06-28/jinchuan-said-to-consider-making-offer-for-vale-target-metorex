Jinchuan Group Co., the biggest
Chinese nickel producer, is considering bidding for  Metorex
Ltd. (MTX) , the target of a $1.1 billion offer from  Vale SA (VALE) , two
people familiar with the deal said.  Nothing has been decided, one person said, asking not to be
identified as it’s too early in the process. Johannesburg-based
Metorex, which said June 17 it received an unsolicited approach
from another party, declined to comment. Wang Wanshou, a
Jinchuan official, said he had no information on the deal.  Vale, seeking to boost copper output almost fivefold to 1
million metric tons by 2015, bid 7.35 rand ($1.07) a share for
Metorex on April 8 in a transaction that would give the Rio de
Janeiro-based company the Ruashi open-pit mine in the Democratic
Republic of Congo and the Chibuluma copper development in
Zambia. Metorex shareholders are scheduled to vote on Vale’s
offer on July 22.  Jinchuan Chairman Yang Zhiqiang said in a March 7 interview
that the company is looking to buy stakes in overseas copper
mines. Jinchuan, based in Gansu Province, took over  Wesizwe (WEZ) 
Platinum Ltd., a Johannesburg-based platinum explorer listed on
the city’s stock exchange, this year.  “It is diversifying businesses to hedge price risks on one
single metal,” said Zhang Fang, an analyst with China
Securities Co. Jinchuan accounts for 90 percent of China’s
nickel output, according to its website.  Mining Deals  Metorex has gained 10 percent in Johannesburg trading since
April 7, the day prior to Vale’s offer announcement, giving the
company a value of 7.83 billion rand. The shares gained 0.7
percent to 7.80 rand by the 5 p.m. close in Johannesburg.  There have been 1,548 deals done this year in mining and
energy, worth $202.5 billion, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. That’s the biggest first half since 2007. Barrick
Gold Corp. offered C$7.32 billion ($7.4 billion) for Zambia-
focused copper producer Equinox Minerals Ltd. in April, beating
a C$6.04 billion bid from  China ’s Minmetals Resources Ltd.  Metorex has an estimated 4.74 million tons of copper
resources, including 1.8 million tons at the Lubembe project in
Congo, the company said in April. Copper for delivery in three
months traded at $9,010 a ton in  London , having gained 31
percent over the past year.  Closely held Jinchuan is looking to buy stakes in mines
with resources greater than 1 million tons to boost its holdings
to 20 million tons in five years, Yang said in March. The
company produced about 400,000 tons of copper, 130,000 tons of
nickel and 6,000 tons of cobalt last year.  Last year it bought Vancouver-based Continental Minerals
Corp. for C$432 million and Toronto-based nickel producer
Crowflight Minerals Inc. for $140 million.  To contact the reporters on this story:
