Kenya ’s shilling headed for the
biggest increase in more than three months against the dollar as
companies’ demand for the U.S. currency declined after they met
their end-of-month payments.  The currency of East Africa’s biggest economy appreciated
as much as 1.2 percent to 89.88 per dollar, headed for the
biggest gain since March 18, and was trading 1.1 percent
stronger at 89.95 by 4:47 p.m. in the capital, Nairobi. A close
at this level will be the strongest since June 17. It closed at
90.93 yesterday.  “The shilling has gained on the back of low demand for the
dollar as most businesses have managed to meet their monthly
needs,” Duncan Kinuthia, a dealer at Nairobi-based Commercial
Bank of Africa Ltd., said in a phone interview today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
