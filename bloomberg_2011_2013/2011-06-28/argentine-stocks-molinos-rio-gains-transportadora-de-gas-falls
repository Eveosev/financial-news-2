The following companies had unusual
price changes in Argentine trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and share prices are as of 5 p.m. New York time.  The Merval Index rose 0.4 percent to 3,326.94.        Molinos Rio de la Plata (MOLI)  SA, the Argentine food
company and soy processor that gets most of its revenue from
outside of  Argentina , climbed 3.3 percent to 30 pesos, its
highest price in a month, as a U.S. government report showed
that dry weather has eroded crop conditions in the country, the
world’s biggest exporter. Exports of soy oil and other food
products account for two-thirds of Molinos’ revenue. Soybean
futures for November delivery rose 4 cents, or 0.3 percent, to
$13.19 a bushel.  Tenaris SA (TEN)  , the world’s biggest maker of seamless
Steel pipes, advanced 0.9 percent to 95.15 pesos as commodity
prices rallied on optimism that  Greece  will receive loans
sufficient to prevent a default. The Thomson Reuters/Jefferies
CRB Index of 19 raw materials advanced 1.7 percent, its biggest
gain since May 18.  Transportadora de Gas del Sur SA (TGSU2)  (TGSU2 AF), a Buenos
Aires-based natural gas transporter, dropped 2.7 percent to 3.25
pesos as the government ordered rationing because cold weather
conditions in the Southern Hemisphere winter boosted demand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
