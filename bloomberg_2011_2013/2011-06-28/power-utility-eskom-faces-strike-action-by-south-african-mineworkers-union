South Africa’s National Union of
Mineworkers said it’s asked its members to prepare themselves
for  strike action  against power utility Eskom Holdings SOC Ltd.  The labor union wants improved consultation, a minimum
service level agreement and is also opposed to the more than
doubling of executive pay at the state-owned company, the NUM
said in an e-mailed statement today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
