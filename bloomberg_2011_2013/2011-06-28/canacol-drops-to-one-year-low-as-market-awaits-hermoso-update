Canacol Energy Ltd. (CNEC) , the Calgary-
based  oil company  that operates fields in  South America , dropped
to the lowest price in almost a year in Bogota as investors
waited for an update on exploration at the company’s main
production field, Rancho Hermoso.  “It’s common that every month or two companies give an
update on their exploration,” said Maria Adelaida Velasquez, an
oil industry analyst at Interbolsa SA,  Colombia ’s biggest
brokerage. “Canacol hasn’t given information on the Rancho
Hermoso exploration in recent months, and the market wants news
on it because it’s the company’s main field.”  The stock fell 3.5 percent to 1,925 pesos at 4 p.m. New
York time, the lowest level since July 2010.  In Canacol’s most recent update on Hermoso, which was
published Feb. 8, the company said it plans to develop as many
as 8 wells in the field’s drilling program in the late second
quarter of 2011. Velasquez said Canacol’s share price fell today
on the lack of an update on Hermoso, combined with last week’s
drop in  oil prices .  Canacol spokeswoman Carolina Orozco didn’t immediately
respond to a phone message seeking comment.  Crude rose 2.5 percent today amid speculation that Greek
lawmakers will approve austerity measures to prevent a debt
default, after prices settled yesterday at the lowest level
since Feb. 18.  To contact the reporter on this story:
