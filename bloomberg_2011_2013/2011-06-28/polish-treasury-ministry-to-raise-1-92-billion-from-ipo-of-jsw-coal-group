Poland  will  raise  5.37 billion zloty
($1.92 billion) in the initial public offering of Jastrzebska
Spolka Weglowa SA, the European Union’s largest coking coal
producer, after pricing the shares above the middle of the
marketed range.  Poland plans to sell 39.5 million shares, or a 33 percent
stake, for 136 zloty apiece, according to a statement on the
company’s website. JSW, as the company is known, originally
offered the stock at 114 zloty to 146 zloty each.  The IPO, part of a government plan to gain cash for
financing the  budget deficit  and curbing debt, is the country’s
largest this year. The sale will allow the Treasury Ministry to
reach 77 percent of the 15 billion zloty it aims to get from
asset sales this year.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co., Citigroup
Inc. and UniCredit SpA were joint global coordinators and joint
bookrunners for the sale. PKO Bank Polski SA, Ipopema Securities
SA, Societe Generale SA, BRE Bank SA and Wood & Co. also helped
to manage the IPO.  To contact the reporters on this story:
