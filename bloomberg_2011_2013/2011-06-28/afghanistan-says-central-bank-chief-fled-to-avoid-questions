Afghanistan ’s central bank governor
Abdul Qadir Fitrat fled to the  United States  after investigators
summoned him for questioning over the collapse of the biggest
Afghan commercial bank, a government spokesman said.  “Fitrat left the country after the attorney general’s
office sent him a letter asking him to answer questions about
his handling of the Kabul Bank scandal,” said Siamak Herawy, a
spokesman for President  Hamid Karzai .  The government took over Kabul Bank in September as
thousands of depositors rushed to withdraw their money after
learning that the bank’s owners had lost funds that a U.S.
government report said may total $850 million, or 94 percent of
its loans. Some lending paid for luxury homes in Dubai for bank
shareholders, including Mahmoud Karzai, the president’s brother,
the  Washington  Post cited him as saying.  Fitrat said in an interview that he had resigned and flown
to Washington because he received threats from officials he had
named as profiting from the insider lending at Kabul Bank,
Afghanistan’s Ariana Television reported. He left a week ago,
the Financial Times cited him as saying in an interview.  Last month, an investigator appointed by Karzai criticized
Fitrat and the central bank for failing to closely enough
supervise Kabul Bank. Fitrat rejected the report then, saying at
a press conference that it was “completely biased and
completely imbalanced.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
