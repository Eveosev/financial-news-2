Argentina,  South America ’s second-
largest economy, is rationing natural gas as winter in the
Southern Hemisphere boosts demand amid a seven-year shortage of
the fuel.  Supplies to industries, which were cut yesterday, “will
return to normal once the current cold wave is over,” Planning
Minister Julio De Vido was quoted as saying in a  statement  on
the presidential website. Companies can avoid being subject to
rationing by agreeing to pay higher prices, he said.  The government is allowed to restrict gas deliveries under
supply contracts with industrial users, which it “does every
year when the cold starts,” Planning Ministry spokesman Horacio
Mizrahi said today in a telephone interview from  Saudi Arabia ,
where he is on a government energy trip.  Argentina  has faced energy shortages since 2004 as price
caps curtailed investments and demand surged as the economy grew
an average 8.5 percent between 2003 and 2008.  YPF SA (YPFD)  operates
two re-gasification ships in Argentina, one of which started
this year, to process imported gas in a bid to help meet demand.  More than 300 companies, including Dow Chemical Co. and
Siderar SAIC, were affected last year by gas shortages in the
winter, which runs from June to September in the Southern
Hemisphere. Some 300 companies were affected yesterday by gas
rationing, newspaper Cronista reported today, citing
unidentified people in the industry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
