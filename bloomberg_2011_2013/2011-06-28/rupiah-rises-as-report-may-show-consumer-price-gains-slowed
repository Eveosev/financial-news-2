Indonesia’s rupiah erased gains
after a government official indicated the  budget deficit  may
widen this year as energy prices rise.  The currency traded near a two-month low after Vice Finance
Minister Anny Ratnawati told reporters today the shortfall may
climb to 2.1 percent of gross domestic product due to increased
fuel and electricity subsidies, higher than the government’s
assumption of 1.8 percent. The rupiah earlier climbed as much as
0.2 percent as economists predict data this week will show
inflation eased for a fifth month in June.  “Concern about the budget deficit caused some negative
sentiment in the market,” said Mika Martumpal, a currency
analyst at PT Bank Commonwealth in Jakarta. “Earlier,
expectations that inflation will be slower this month supported
the rupiah.”  The rupiah was little changed at 8,629 per dollar as of
3:57 p.m. in Jakarta, compared with 8,628 yesterday, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. It earlier fell to 8,633, the
weakest level since April 27.  Indonesia ’s consumer prices increased 5.60 percent this
month from a year earlier, after climbing 5.98 percent in May,
according to the median estimate of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg before the data on July 1.  Overseas investors increased  holdings  of Indonesian
 government bonds  on June 24 after selling the debt in the
previous four days, according to  data  from the  finance ministry .
Foreign ownership of the securities climbed 20 percent this year
to 234.24 trillion rupiah ($27.2 billion).  Indonesia’s 10-year government bonds dropped for a second
day. The yield on the 8.25 percent note maturing in July 2021
climbed one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 7.57
percent, according to prices from the Inter-Dealer Market
Association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
