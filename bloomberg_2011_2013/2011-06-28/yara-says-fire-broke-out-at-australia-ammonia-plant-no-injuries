Yara International ASA (YAR)  said a fire
broke out at Burrup Fertilisers Pty. Ltd.’s ammonia plant in
 Western Australia .  “I can confirm that we have learned that there was a fire
at the plant today,” Asle Skredderberget, a Yara spokesman,
said in an e-mailed response to questions. “It has been stopped
and there are no reports of anyone being injured. It’s too early
to say anything about what led to the fire and the potential
consequences.”  TDN Finans earlier reported that the fire occurred at the
ammonia plant as it was about to resume production after a
maintenance shutdown.  Oslo-based Yara owns 35 percent of Burrup.  For Related News and Information:  To contact the reporter on this story:
