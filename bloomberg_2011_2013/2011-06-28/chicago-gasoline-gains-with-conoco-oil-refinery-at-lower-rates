Chicago gasoline rose to its
strongest level in more than three weeks after  ConocoPhillips (COP) ’s
Wood River, Illinois, plant experienced a power outage and  Exxon
Mobil Corp. (XOM)  shut a furnace at its refinery in Joliet.  Conoco’s 380,900-barrel-a-day plant is operating at reduced
rates for several days while units are restarted after the June
25 power disruption,  Rich Johnson , a company spokesman, said in
an e-mail yesterday. He didn’t immediately respond to an e-mail
seeking comment today.  The discount for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in
Chicago narrowed 3.88 cents to 2.5 cents versus futures traded
on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 12:42 p.m., according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. It’s the highest level since June 3.
Prompt delivery rose 9.39 cents to $2.7746 a gallon.  Exxon Mobil’s 238,000-barrel-a-day Joliet plant released
emissions June 26 when the incinerator unit failed, the company
said in a filing with the  Illinois  Emergency Management Agency.  The same fuel in the Midwest, or Group 3, strengthened 0.13
cent to narrow its discount to 12 cents a gallon.  Regular gasoline in the Gulf Coast strengthened 0.5 cent to
a discount of 11.5 cents a gallon.  Citgo Petroleum Corp.’s Corpus Christi West refinery in
Texas has returned to normal production rates following third-
party mechanical problems.  The company reported flaring after the third party had to
stop receiving gases produced through the refining process from
the East and West plants, resulting in a fuel gas system
imbalance yesterday, according to a  filing  with the Texas
Commission on Environmental Quality.  To contact the reporter on this story:
