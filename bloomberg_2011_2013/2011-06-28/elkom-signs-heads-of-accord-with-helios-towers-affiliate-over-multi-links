Telkom South  Africa  Ltd., Africa’s
largest fixed-line phone company, signed a preliminary agreement
to sell its Nigerian unit to an affiliate of Helios Towers
 Nigeria , following a legal battle between the companies.  Telkom will sell Multi-Links for $10 million, it said today
in a stock-exchange filing. The  Pretoria , South Africa-based
company said it will continue to provide interim operational
funding to Multi-Links until the transaction’s expected
completion in August.  The South African company said on June 13 that it had
ceased all funding to Multi-Links, which has been sued for $252
million by Helios Towers Nigeria, a unit of London-based Helios
Investment Partners LLP, for a breach of a lease contract.
Multi-Links contested the validity of a 10-year contract to
lease phone towers built for it by Helios. It had walked away
from the deal in its third year. A judge at the  High Court  in
Lagos ruled on June 7 that the contract was valid.  A deal to sell the CDMA-technology unit of Multi-Links to
Visafone Communications Ltd. for $52 million in April fell
through after Multi-Links failed to resolve the $252 million
Helios claim.  Helios Towers Nigeria “will acquire full ownership and
control” of Multi-Links when the deal is completed, Telkom said
in an e-mailed statement. The price may increase depending on
achievements of certain conditions, it said, without giving
details.  -- Editors: Jim Silver, Niamh Ring,  Emily Bowers .  To contact the reporter on this story:
