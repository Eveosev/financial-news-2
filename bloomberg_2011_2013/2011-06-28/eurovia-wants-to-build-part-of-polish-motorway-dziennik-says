Eurovia SA wants to build a 30
kilometer-long (19 miles) stretch of a motorway from Warsaw to
Lodz, taking over one of two sections that were to be build by a
group of companies led by China Overseas Engineering Group Co.
Ltd.,  Dziennik Gazeta Prawna  said, citing no one.  No company has so far agreed to build the second section,
the newspaper said, without saying where it got the information.  Poland on June 13 canceled a contract with the China
Overseas-led group and began to seek companies that would ensure
that the motorway is ready before the European soccer
championships begin in June of next year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
