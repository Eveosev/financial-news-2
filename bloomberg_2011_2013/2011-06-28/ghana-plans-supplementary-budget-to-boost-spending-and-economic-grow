Ghana , the world’s second-biggest
cocoa producer, is planning a supplementary budget in August to
increase  government spending , said Fifi Kwetey, deputy minister
of finance and economic planning.  “We want to increase allocation to some specific areas of
the economy,” Kwetey said by phone today, declining to say how
much expenditure will rise. “The intention is to engineer more
growth into the economy.”  Africa’s newest oil exporter expanded 23 percent in the
first quarter of the year, the  Ghana  Statistical Service said
June 22 after production at the offshore Jubilee oil field began
in December. With the inflation rate below 10 percent and the
yield on the benchmark 91-day Treasury bill at 10.57 percent,
the Ghanaian economy is “stable” enough to handle the extra
spending, Kwetey said.  In its 2011 budget issued in November, Ghanaian expenditure
was  projected  to be 12.7 billion cedis ($8.4 billion). Kwetey
said the government is aiming to reduce its  budget deficit  to
between 5 percent and 5.5 percent of gross domestic product this
year from 6.8 percent last year.  Ghana’s inflation rate declined for the third consecutive
month to 8.9 percent in May, from 9 percent in April, the
statistical agency said June 15. Daily output from the Jubilee
field will increase to 120,000 barrels from next month from
70,000 barrels currently, according to  Tullow Oil Plc (TLW) , the
field’s operator.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
