The rand gained for a second day
against the dollar as investor appetite for riskier emerging-
market assets rose on optimism  Greece ’s creditors will agree to
roll over the nation’s debt.  The rand advanced as much as 0.5 percent to 6.8393 per
dollar and traded 0.4 percent stronger at 6.8482 as of 3:17 p.m.
in Johannesburg. It traded at 9.8033 per euro, little changed
from yesterday’s close.  Commodity prices gained the most in a month, with gold and
platinum, which account for 20 percent of  South Africa ’s
exports, rising. Emerging-market stocks followed U.S. equity
markets higher, and the FTSE/JSE All Share Index climbed for a
third day, adding as much as 0.7 percent as mining companies
including  Impala Platinum Holdings Ltd. (IMP)  and  Anglo American Plc (AAL) 
advanced.  “Emerging-market currencies, the rand included, will enjoy
some respite” as stock prices rise, Tradition Analytics
researchers led by Johannesburg-based Quinten Bertenshaw wrote
in a research note. “The news flow has been positive enough to
squeeze investors out of the risk-off trade.”  Foreign investors bought 1.85 billion rand ($269.6 million)
of South African bonds yesterday, bringing foreign investor
purchases of the country’s debt this quarter to 43.9 billion
rand, according to  JSE Ltd. (JSE)  data.  The rand will probably trade in a range between 6.82 and
6.92 per dollar today, Tradition said.  ‘Patriotic Conscience’  The euro advanced versus against the majority of its most-
traded counterparts after French President Nicolas Sarkozy said
 France  is working on a plan to roll over 70 percent of Greece’s
debt. Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou called on lawmakers
to obey their “patriotic conscience” and back tougher
austerity measures, as they began to debate a five-year budget
plan yesterday.  The rand often tracks the euro, which accounts for 45
percent of South Africa’s exports and 34 percent of its imports.
The correlation between the two currencies has been 0.854 over
the past month. A value of 1 would mean they moved in lock step.  Bonds declined for the first day in three after yields rose
at a central bank auction of notes maturing in 2020 on
speculation government debt has become expensive relative to the
outlook for inflation and  interest rates .  The Pretoria-based  Reserve Bank  sold 1.3 billion rand of
7.25 percent bonds due 2020 at an average yield of 8.29 percent,
10 basis points, or 0.1 percentage point, higher than the
previous auction on June 1. It also auctioned 800 million rand
of 7 percent securities due 2031 at a yield of 8.81 percent.  ‘Very Weak’  “Today’s auction was very weak,”  Leon Myburgh  and Coura Fall, analysts at Citibank NA in Johannesburg, said in an e-
mailed comment. “The bid-to-cover ratio was quite low for both
bonds compared with recent auctions, showing demand was poor.”  The benchmark 6.75 percent securities due 2021 dropped 27
cents to 89.22 rand, driving the yield up four basis points to
8.39 percent. The 13.5 percent notes due 2015 slipped 15 cents
to 121.42 rand, boosting the yield three basis points to 7.46
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
