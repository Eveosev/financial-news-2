Apax Partners LLP, a British
leveraged buyout firm, said it reaped 3.3 billion euros ($4.7
billion) last year from selling holdings in companies from
Danish phone operator TDC A/S to clothes designer  Tommy
Hilfiger .  Apax received an average of three times its original
investment from the asset sales, the London-based private equity
firm said in its annual report today. The firm spent 3.1 billion
euros in 2010.  Leveraged-buyout fund managers such as Apax pool money from
investors to buy companies, financing purchases mostly with
debt, with the intention of selling them later. The firms are
resuming takeovers after the 2008 financial crisis almost halted
buyouts for two years, and have announced $214 billion of
takeovers this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “We continue to see a strong pipeline of proprietary
investment opportunities,” said Chief Executive Officer Martin Halusa, 56, in the report. “The actions taken during the
recession have positioned the portfolio for growth as the
economy recovers and the budgetary outlook for 2011 remains
positive.”  Apax oversees an 11.2 billion-euro fund raised in 2007. The
firm is seeking to raise 9 billion euros for a new fund, people
with knowledge of the plans said in March.  To contact the reporter on this story:
