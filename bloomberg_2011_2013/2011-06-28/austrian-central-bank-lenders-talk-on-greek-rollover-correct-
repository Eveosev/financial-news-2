Austria ’s central bank is discussing
a possible voluntary rollover of Greek debt with the country’s
lenders, according to Chancellor Werner Faymann.  The talks are being held privately and outside of the
public eye, Faymann told reporters in Vienna today.  A solution on Greece may be found at a European finance
minister meeting on July 3, Faymann also said.  The talks are between the central bank and the lenders and
the government is not involved, Faymann’s spokesman Nedeljko
Bilalic said by phone today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
