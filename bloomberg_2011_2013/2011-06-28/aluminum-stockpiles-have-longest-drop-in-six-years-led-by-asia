Aluminum inventories extended their
longest decline to six years led by removals in  Asia .  Aluminum inventories in warehouses monitored by the London
Metal Exchange fell 10,000 metric tons, or 0.2 percent, to 4.52
million tons, the lowest since Jan. 31. That was the 24th
consecutive drop, the longest streak since March 14, 2005.
Inventories had climbed to a record on May 18.  “The current reshuffling of aluminum stocks between LME
warehouses, particularly in the U.S., could interfere slightly
with readings of the state of ‘apparent’ demand over the coming
months,” Citigroup Inc. analyst  David Thurtell  said in a report
today.  Annual growth in “apparent” aluminum demand jumped to
almost 11 percent last month from 7 percent in April, Thurtell
wrote in the report.  Alcoa Inc. (AA)  said three days ago it won a
multiyear agreement valued at $1 billion to supply aluminum to
Airbus SAS.  Stockpiles have dropped 3.9 percent since May 24, with
inventories down 6.1 percent in Asia over the same period,
according to exchange figures. Stockpiles in the U.S. are down
3.7 percent.  Aluminum inventories had climbed to a record 4.71 million
tons on May 18. Bottlenecks in the U.S. warehousing system
prompted the LME to consider a proposal to increase the amount
of metal that has to be delivered from the biggest stockpiles.  To contact the reporter on this story:
