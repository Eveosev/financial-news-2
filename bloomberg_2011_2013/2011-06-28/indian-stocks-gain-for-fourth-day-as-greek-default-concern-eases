India’s benchmark index advanced for
a fourth day as easing concern over a possible debt default by
Greece outweighed the finance minister’s comments on rising
consumer and food prices.  Hindalco Industries Ltd. (HNDL) , the aluminum maker which also
controls the Atlanta-based Novelis Inc., surged 4 percent, as
metal prices rose in  London . Greek creditors may be headed
toward a rollover accord involving 70 percent of their bonds to
prevent a default, two people familiar with the plan said.
“Inflation is an important constraint that we have to tackle,”
India’s Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee said in  Washington 
yesterday.  Housing Development Finance Corp. (HDFC) , the largest
mortgage-lender, climbed 2.1 percent.  The Bombay Stock Exchange Sensitive Index, or Sensex, rose
71.86, or 0.4 percent, to 18,484.27 according to preliminary
closing prices as of 3:30 p.m. in Mumbai time, after swinging
between gains and losses at least 12 times. The gauge gained 4.9
percent in the past three sessions. The S&P CNX Nifty Index on
the National Stock Exchange of  India  Ltd. added 0.3 percent to
5,542.35. The BSE 200 Index gained 0.3 percent to 2,279.89.  To contact the reporter on this story:
