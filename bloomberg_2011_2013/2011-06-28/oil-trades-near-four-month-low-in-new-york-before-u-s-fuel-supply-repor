Crude oil traded near a four-month
low before an Energy Department report that may show gasoline
stockpiles in the U.S. climbed to the highest in 12 weeks.  Futures retraced their 0.9 percent gain today on concern
that gasoline supplies may rise 775,000 barrels to 215.4 million
barrels in the week ended June 24, according to a survey of
analysts before tomorrow’s release. Distillate stockpiles
probably gained 1.05 million barrels. Average U.S. motor-fuel
demand in the past four weeks was 0.4 percent below the same
period a year earlier, MasterCard Inc. said June 21.  “There is a bit of concern about the buildup in
products,” said Serene Lim, a commodity and energy strategist
at  Australia  and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. in  Singapore .
“This is normally the time of year when you see a build in
distillates, and gasoline inventories will decline but what
we’re seeing is that demand has been lackluster. So there are
concerns inventories will increase.”  Crude for August delivery was at $90.58 a barrel, down 3
cents, in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile Exchange 
at 2:32 p.m. Singapore time. Yesterday, the contract fell 0.6
percent to $90.61, the lowest settlement since Feb. 18. Futures
have gained 16 percent in the past year.  Brent oil for August settlement on the London-based ICE
Futures Europe exchange fell as much as 64 cents, or 0.6
percent, to $105.35 a barrel. The European benchmark contract
was at a premium of $15.22 to U.S. futures. On June 15, the
difference between front-month prices reached a record $22.29.  U.S. crude oil inventories probably fell 1.5 million
barrels to the lowest level in two months, according to the
median of 10 analyst estimates before the government report. The
industry-funded  American Petroleum Institute  will publish its
own stockpile data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
