Electricity Generating Authority of
Thailand, the nation’s power supply monopoly, increased power
production using  fuel oil  and hydro-electricity after a pipeline
leak reduced supplies of natural gas.  The state-owned company will also buy more electricity from
Laos to offset the drop in supply from local plants, Sutat
Patmasiriwat, EGAT’s governor, said at a press briefing in
Nonthaburi province today.  PTT Pcl (PTT) , the country’s largest energy company, said on June
27 that a leak in a natural  gas pipeline  off Thailand’s coast
reduced natural gas supply by 660 million cubic feet per day,
from a total of 4.4 billion cubic feet per day. Customers
including EGAT and PTT’s own gas-separation plants will be
“partially affected” by the incident, it said.  Thailand generates about 70 percent of its power from
natural gas, said Sutat. The gas leak may take about two weeks
to be repaired, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
