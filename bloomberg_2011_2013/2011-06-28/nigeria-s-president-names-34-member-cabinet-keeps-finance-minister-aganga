Nigerian President  Goodluck Jonathan 
proposed a 34-member Cabinet that includes former Petroleum
Minister Diezani Alison-Madueke and ex-Finance Minister Olusegun Aganga, according to a list released by parliament today.  The nominations don’t include the previous foreign affairs
minister, Odein Ajumogobia. Senate President David Mark had
earlier said the new Cabinet would have 35 members.  The Senate may start the process of approving the nominees
tomorrow, “as soon as their documents are complete,” Victor
Ndoma-Egba, the majority leader of the chamber, told reporters
at the close of proceedings.  Jonathan, who is forming a new government after winning
April elections, has pledged to invest in power, roads and
railways and reform the  petroleum industry , the mainstay of the
country’s economy, in order to boost growth.  The government also faces the challenge of dealing with
growing insecurity. While an armed insurgency in the oil-
producing Niger River delta remains subdued, parts of the north
have been hit in a campaign of violence by the radical Islamic
sect, Boko Haram, inspired by  Afghanistan ’s Taliban movement.  Nigeria’s economy, the third-largest on the continent after
 South Africa  and Egypt, is projected to grow 8 percent this
year, compared with 7.8 percent in 2010, according to the
National Bureau of Statistics.  To contact the reporter on this story:
