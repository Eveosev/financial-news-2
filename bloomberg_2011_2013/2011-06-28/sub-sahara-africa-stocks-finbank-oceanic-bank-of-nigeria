the central bank in 2009, gained 2 kobo, or 3.5 percent, to 59
kobo, the highest close since June 2, after a court dismissed a
bid to halt the sale of the bank to First City Monument Bank
Plc, spurring expectations that bailed-out banks would be sold
in time to meet a Sept. 30 recapitalization deadline.  “This is positive news for the Finbank-FCMB merger,”
Matthew Pearson, the head of African equity products at Standard
Bank Plc, wrote in an e-mailed note to clients today. “We
expect these rulings to facilitate at least half of the rescued
banks to meet the deadline, a positive development for the
banking sector overall, curbing the potential contagion effect
of liquidation.”  Bank PHB Plc (PLATINUM)  , rallied for a seventh day, the
longest streak since Nov. 5, adding 2 kobo, or 2.3 percent, to
90 kobo. Union Bank of Nigeria Plc (UBN NL), advanced for a

sweetener, declined 20 cents, or 2.8 percent, to 7.05 shillings,
the lowest price since March 29, on concern its production may
be below target.  “We all know there has been drought and maybe they won’t
receive the expected crop yield and sugar production,” Victor
Odendo, an investment manager at Nairobi-based CIC Asset
Management Ltd., said in a phone interview today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
