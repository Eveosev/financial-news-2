The  Belgrade Stock Exchange  is
looking into offering markets a new index based on bank shares
as it tries to attract more investors, an official said.  “BelexBank is an index that would be sold to investors as
another instrument to help them better diversify and increase
exposure to our market,” Miroljub Ristic, the bourse’s chief
analyst, told a forum in Belgrade today.  Foreign investors accounted for 48.8 percent of trades in
May, the highest since January. Banks account for six out of 15
shares included in the BELEX15 index. The BELEX15 is traded as
an index certificate on Scoach Europa AG, Boerse Stuttgart AG
and the  Warsaw Stock Exchange .  To contact the reporter on this story:
