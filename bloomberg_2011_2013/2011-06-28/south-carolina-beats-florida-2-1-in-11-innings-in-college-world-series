The  University of South Carolina 
pulled out a 2-1, 11-inning victory over the University of
 Florida  in the opening game of the  College World Series  finals.  It was the record-extending 15th straight victory in the
National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament for the
defending champion Gamecocks, who have won six of their last
nine College  World Series  games by a lone run.  Christian Walker scored the  winning run  for South Carolina
on a pair of throwing errors in the top of the 11th inning last
night at TD Ameritrade Park in Omaha,  Nebraska .  Walker, playing with a fractured bone in his left wrist,
had a one-out single and stole second base. When the throw from
the catcher sailed into centerfield, Walker advanced to third
and then came home when the throw from the outfield went into
the stands.  Game 2 of the  best-of-three series  between the Southeastern
Conference rivals is scheduled for tonight in Omaha. A decider,
if necessary, would be tomorrow.  South Carolina (54-14) reached the championship series by
beating top-seeded Virginia 3-2 after a Cavaliers reliever
botched two throws while fielding bunts in the 13th inning.  Florida, which won the SEC tournament this season, missed
scoring chances last night in the ninth, 10th and 11th innings.
The Gators (53-18) failed to score after loading the bases with
no outs in the ninth and had a runner thrown out at home plate
from the outfield to end the 10th.  In the bottom of the 11th inning, Florida had the tying run
on second base with one out before  South Carolina  reliever Matt
Price got a strikeout and groundout to end the game.
