problem,” said Saktiandi Supaat, head of foreign-exchange
research at Malayan Banking Bhd. in Singapore “If there’s no
contagion in the region’s banking system, there’s room for Asian
currencies to regain their appreciation path.”  The ringgit strengthened 0.4 percent to 3.0468 per dollar
as of 4:13 p.m. in  Kuala Lumpur , according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It touched 3.0640 earlier, the weakest since May 25.
The currency may reach 2.95 by year end, Saktiandi said.  France  is working on a proposed target of rolling over 70
percent of Greece’s debt after talks last week with banks,

finance ministers will meet on July 3 to decide on an aid
package for the cash-strapped nation.  Five-year bonds declined for a third day, pushing yields to
a one-week high. The treasury will auction 2 billion ringgit
($656 million) of 20-year debt tomorrow.  The yield on the 4.262 percent note due September 2016
