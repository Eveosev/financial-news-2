The rand may tumble as much as 30
percent, boosting exporter profits and shares of miners,
according to  Coronation Fund Managers Ltd. (CML) , whose Equity Fund
was South Africa’s top performer over the past three years.  Coronation, which manages 231 billion rand ($33.6 billion)
is buying  Anglo American Plc (AAL) , the diversified miner whose shares
have slid 20 percent from a 2 ½-year peak on Feb. 24, said Chief
Investment Officer Karl Leinberger in an interview in Cape Town.  To contact the reporter on this story:
