Poland, seeking as much as 5.77
billion zloty ($2.1 billion) from the initial public offering of
Jastrzebska Spolka Weglowa SA, may price the shares at 135 zloty
to 136 zloty each, three people with knowledge of the
transaction said today.  A final price will be decided later tonight, said the
people, who declined to be named because the information is
private. At 136 zloty a share, the IPO will raise about $2
billion.  Maciej Wewior, a spokesman for the Treasury Ministry,
declined to comment on the pricing when contacted by phone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
