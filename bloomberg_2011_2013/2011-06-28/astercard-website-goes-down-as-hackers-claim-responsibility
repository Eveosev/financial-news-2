MasterCard Inc. (MA) , the world’s second-
biggest consumer-payments network, said it lost  service  on its
website today because of a failure at an Internet service
provider.  The  site  was restored after a “telecommunications/Internet
Service Provider outage that impacted multiple companies,
including ours,” James Issokson, a spokesman for MasterCard,
said in an e-mail after he was asked whether hackers were
responsible. “It is important to note that no cardholder data
has been impacted and that cardholders can continue to use their
cards securely.”  A post on Twitter from Ibom Hacktivist said “thats what
you get when you mess with @wikileaks @Anon_Central and the
enter [sic] community of lulz loving individuals.” A hacker
group called Lulz Security, or LulzSec, has said it broke into
sites at Sony Corp. and the  U.S. Senate .  MasterCard’s website was knocked offline in December after
the Purchase, New York-based company blocked WikiLeaks from
using its network to collect payments from donors.  WikiLeaks ,
led by Julian Assange, publishes secret documents on the Web,
including confidential U.S. diplomatic documents. The previous
attack on MasterCard was orchestrated by Anonymous, an
“internet vigilante group,” TechCrunch reported at the time.  WikiLeaks released a  statement  today on its website to mark
the six-month anniversary of MasterCard’s decision to block it
from using the payments network.  “Censorship, like everything else in the West, has been
privatized,” WikiLeaks wrote, also blaming companies including
 Visa Inc. (V) ,  Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  and PayPal Inc., a unit of  EBay
Inc. (EBAY)  “The attack has blocked over 90 percent of the nonprofit
organization’s donations, costing some $15 million in lost
revenue. The attack is entirely outside of any due process or
rule of law.”  The Wall Street Journal reported on the disruption to
MasterCard’s website and Twitter posts earlier today.  MasterCard climbed $5.21, or 1.9 percent, to $277.81 at
1:12 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The
stock has gained 24 percent this year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
