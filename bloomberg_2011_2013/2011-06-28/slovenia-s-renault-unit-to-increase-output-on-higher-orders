The Slovenian unit of  Renault SA (RNO) 
will increase output from the end of August after it lowered
production last month due to a lack of electronic parts that
were produced in a tsunami-hit area of  Japan .  Revoz, as Slovenia’s largest exporter is known, “has
sufficient information to raise output from August 29 and will
rehire some 300 workers for the night shift,” the Novo mesto-
based company said in an e-mailed statement today.  Revoz produces the Twingo, Clio II and Wind Coupe Roadster
and demand for the models has improved as consumers switch to
more fuel-efficient vehicles on advancing oil costs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
