Severn Trent Plc (SVT)  and United
Utilities Plc, two U.K. water providers, led gains in the FTSE
100 Index after  Northumbrian Water Group Plc (NWG)  became the target
of possible takeover bid.  Severn Trent rose as much as 4.1 percent and traded at
1,463 pence as of 9:40 a.m. in  London . United Utilities climbed
as much as 3.8 percent and was last at 603 pence. The U.K.’s
benchmark stock index advanced 0.8 percent.  Cheung Kong Infrastructure Holdings Ltd. (1038) , controlled by
Hong Kong billionaire  Li Ka-shing , said yesterday it’s
considering a cash offer for Northumbrian, sending shares of the
Durham, England-based utility up 8 percent.  CKI led a group that bought Electricite de France SA’s U.K.
power networks for 5.8 billion pounds ($9 billion) in July 2010,
as part of a drive to snap up power, water and road assets in
 Australia , Canada and the U.K. to counter price curbs in Hong
Kong’s power market.  Lakis Athanasiou, an analyst at Evolution Securities Ltd.,
upgraded his recommendation on Severn Trent to “Add” with a
target price of 1,634 pence. Athanasiou’s target price for
United Utilities is 663 pence, according to a note published
today.  Northumbrian said yesterday it hasn’t received a proposal
that could lead to an offer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
