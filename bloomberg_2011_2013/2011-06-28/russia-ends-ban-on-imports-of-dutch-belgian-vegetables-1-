Russia  ended a ban on imports of
Dutch and Belgian vegetables imposed amid a deadly outbreak of
E. coli.  A measure barring vegetables from Poland, Denmark, Spain,
Lithuania and the  Czech Republic  is under review, Gennady Onishchenko, Russia’s chief sanitary official, told reporters in
Moscow today. The Netherlands and Belgium can export to Russia
again after studies of the countries’ guarantees of veterinary
control over produce, he said.  Russia prohibited all fresh-vegetable imports from the 27-
nation European Union on June 2 after the outbreak began in
 Germany . At least 4,023 people across Europe have been infected
and 48 have died, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and
Control  said  today.  “The main thing is safety of the produce,” First Deputy
Prime Minister Viktor Zubkov said at a meeting of a government
agriculture commission. “We will issue relevant permissions
only in cases of guaranteed, safe produce.”  The Netherlands accounts for about 30 percent of total
Russian vegetable imports from  Europe , Onishchenko said,
estimating the value of overall annual shipments at 2.5 billion
euros ($3.6 billion).  To contact the reporter on this story:
