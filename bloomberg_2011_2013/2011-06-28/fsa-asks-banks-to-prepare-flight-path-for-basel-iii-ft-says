The U.K.’s Financial Services
Authority has asked banks to prepare a “flight path” to put
them in compliance with the new global Basel III capital rules,
taking into account dividends, bonuses and the possibility of
another economic recession, the Financial Times reported,
without attribution.  Bank of England Deputy Governor  Paul Tucker  will tomorrow
reiterate calls for banks to build up capital ahead of the Basel
III requirements, rather than using strong earnings to make
payouts to staff and investors, the FT also said, citing a
speech Tucker is due to make to the British Bankers’
Association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
