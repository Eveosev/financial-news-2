(Corrects name of town in final paragraph of story
originally published June 28.)  First Quantum Minerals Ltd. (FM)  is
studying $2 billion of investment in Zambia, on top of the $1.9
billion it’s already considering for two mines,  Radio Phoenix 
reported, citing the company’s Operations Director Matt Pascall.  The Canadian miner is looking at exploration prospects that
may “generate another Trident and another Kansanshi,” Pascall
said in an interview with the radio station, referring to the
company’s two copper projects. Zambia has favorable legislation
and is economically and politically stable, he said.  First Quantum previously said it may spend $1 billion to
dig its Trident mine and $900 million to expand the Kansanshi
operation. The company is now studying a gold investment in
Mkushi, 290 kilometers (180 miles) north of the capital Lusaka,
and is seeking to team up with a “major investor,” Pascall
told the Zambian radio station.  To contact the reporter on this story:
