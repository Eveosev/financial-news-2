Chad’s economic growth rate may
decline to 3.5 percent this year from 13 percent in 2010 because
of lower agriculture production, Economy and Planning Minister
Mahamat Hassan said.  The North African country’s economy was helped by “good
rains” last year, Hassan said in an interview today in  Jeddah ,
 Saudi Arabia . Oil production may start to increase from current
levels at the end of this year, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
