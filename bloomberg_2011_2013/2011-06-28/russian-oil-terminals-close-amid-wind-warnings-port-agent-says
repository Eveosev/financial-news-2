The Sheskharis and  Caspian Pipeline
Consortium  oil terminals at the Russian port of Novorossiysk
were closed to approaching tankers amid warnings of gale-force
winds, a port agent said.  The terminals may remain closed until midnight local time,
said GAC Russia Agency Operations Manager Sergey Dolzhikov.
Winds of up to 15 meters a second (34 miles an hour) and a sea
swell as high as 2 meters (6.5 feet) barred the terminals from
reopening after the warnings were first declared late on June
26, he said.  Tankers moor at the terminals to collect cargoes of up to 1
million barrels of oil. Sheskharis is an outlet for Urals crude,
and CPC Blend is exported from the Caspian Pipeline Consortium
terminal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
