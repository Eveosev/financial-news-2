The  International Energy Agency  is
confident that Saudi Arabia will continue to boost its crude
production in the wake of the agency’s decision to release oil
stockpiles, IEA Executive Director  Nobuo Tanaka  said.  “Saudis have ample capacity,” Tanaka said today at a
conference in London. “We think it may take some time so we are
filling the gap in the meantime.”  The agency may extend its release of emergency inventories
beyond an initial 30-day period, he said. The group announced on
June 23 that its members would make available 60 million barrels
of oil to offset the loss of Libyan supplies.  “This was a preemptive action,” Tanaka said. “We are
mandated to act in case of a serious threat of disruption.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
