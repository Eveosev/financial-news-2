England ’s James Anderson took four
wickets to lead the home side to a 110-run victory over  Sri
Lanka  in their first one-day cricket international at the Oval
in London.  Jade Dernbach, appearing in his first one-day international
for England, took two wickets and spin bowler Graeme Swann took
three. Craig Kieswetter high-scored with 61 runs in the match,
which had been shortened because of rain. England reached 229-8
in its 32 overs.  Sri Lanka’s fight back was led by Lasith Malinga, who was
caught off Swann on 26. Only three other visitors reached double
figures as Sri Lanka was all out for 121 runs in 27 overs.  England was playing today under new one-day captain
 Alastair Cook , who has taken over the role from Andrew Strauss.
The hosts bounced back from a nine-wicket defeat to Sri Lanka in
a Twenty20 match three days ago. England already won a three-
Test series 1-0.  England begins a four-Test series against India on July 21.  To contact the reporter on this story:
