Commerzbank AG (CBK)  aims to gain 1
billion euros ($1.43 billion) in new credit business with
smaller companies in the renewable-energy sector this year,
 Handelsblatt  reported, citing Markus Beumer, who is responsible
for the bank’s business with the so-called Mittelstand, or small
to medium-size businesses.  The loan volume to the sector will grow to about 5.5
billion euros by the end of the year, and Commerzbank plans to
double the size of the business “in coming years,” Beumer was
cited as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
