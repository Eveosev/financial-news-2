Crude oil inventories declined 2.7
million barrels last week to 360.3 million, the  American
Petroleum Institute  said today.  Gasoline stockpiles dropped 91,000 barrels to 211.8
million, the report showed.  The Energy Department is scheduled to release its inventory
report tomorrow at 10:30 a.m. in  Washington .  The government report may show stockpiles of crude oil
declined 1.5 million barrels, according to the median of 12
responses in a Bloomberg News survey. Gasoline inventories
probably rose 775,000 barrels, the survey showed.  Oil-supply totals from the API and DOE have moved in the
same direction 71 percent of the time over the past 52 weeks.  API collects stockpile information on a voluntary basis
from operators of refineries, bulk terminals and pipelines. The
government requires that reports be filed with the Energy
Department for its weekly survey.  Crude oil for August delivery rose $2.54, or 2.8 percent,
to $93.15 a barrel at 4:32 p.m. in electronic trading on the  New
York Mercantile Exchange . The contract traded at $92.80 before
release of the report at 4:30 p.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
