Sony Corp. (6758)  Chairman  Howard Stringer 
took a 15 percent pay cut as the company slashed compensation
for executives who oversaw a third straight year of losses.  Stringer earned 345 million yen ($4.3 million) in salary
and bonuses for the 12 months ended March 31, a decrease from
408 million yen a year earlier, Sony’s filings to the government
show. He also received 500,000 shares as stock options,
unchanged from the prior period, according to the documents.  Stringer, 69, addressed shareholders at their annual
meeting today, vowing to focus on networked services, 3-D
products, new technologies and emerging markets to boost growth
and competitiveness. The Tokyo-based electronics maker,
recovering from the March 11 earthquake and hacker attacks on
its entertainment network, has lost 30 percent of its market
value this year. That compares with a 5.7 percent drop for the
benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock Average.  Vice Chairman Ryoji Chubachi was paid 123 million yen
excluding  stock options , down from 148 million yen in the
previous year, according to the filings. Executive Deputy
President Kazuo Hirai earned 101 million yen, excluding stock
options, a decrease from 110 million yen in the prior period.  Sony,  Japan ’s biggest exporter of consumer electronics,
will probably return to net income of 80 billion yen in the year
ending March 31, the company forecast May 26. The net loss was
260 billion yen in the year ended March 31, the widest annual
loss in 16 years.  Sony rose 0.3 percent to 2,038 yen at the 3 p.m. close of
trading in Tokyo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
