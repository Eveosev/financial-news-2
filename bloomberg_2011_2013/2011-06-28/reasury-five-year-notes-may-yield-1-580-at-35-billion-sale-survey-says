The Treasury’s $35 billion sale of
five-year notes may draw a yield of 1.580 percent, according to
the average forecast of nine of the  Federal Reserve ’s 20 primary
dealers surveyed by Bloomberg News.  The securities, which mature in June 2016, yielded 1.575
percent in pre-auction trading. Bids are due by 1 p.m. New York
time.  Today’s offering is the same size as the past nine monthly
five-year debt auctions. The last sale of the maturity, on May
25, drew a yield of 1.813 percent, down from 2.124 percent the
month before.  The May sale’s bid-to-cover ratio, which gauges demand by
comparing the amount bid with the amount offered, was 3.20, the
highest since September 1994. The average for the past 10
offerings is 2.83.  Indirect bidders, an investor class that includes foreign
central banks, purchased 47.1 percent of the notes at the May
sale and an average of 41.6 percent at the past 10 auctions.  Direct bidders, non-primary dealers that place their bids
directly with the Treasury, bought 8.9 percent of the securities
at the May offering. That compared with an average of 10 percent
at the past 10 sales.  Five-year notes have returned 4.6 percent this year, after
gaining 6.8 percent in 2010, according to Bank of America
Merrill Lynch indexes. Treasuries overall have advanced 3.3
percent this year after rising 5.9 percent last year.  The Fed’s primary dealers trade  government securities  with
the central bank and are obligated to participate in U.S. debt
auctions.  At yesterday’s $35 billion two-year note auction, indirect
bidders purchased 22 percent of the securities, the lowest since
February 2008. The government will conclude this week’s note
sales with tomorrow’s $29 billion offering of seven-year debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
