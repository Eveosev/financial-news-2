Sugar rose the most in more than two
months after an industry group said the cane harvest will be
smaller than forecast in the Center South region of  Brazil , the
world’s biggest producer and exporter. Cocoa also climbed.  Unica, a sugar trade organization, said today that it will
revise its estimate next month for cane production in Center
South, the country’s largest growing region. In March, the group
forecast 568.5 million metric tons. Sugar production in the
region fell 14 percent in the first half of June from a year
earlier, figures from the group showed.  “Brazil output could be lower than earlier estimated,”
said Jeff Bauml, a senior vice president at R.J. O’Brien &
Associates, a broker in New York. “Also, we are seeing an
increase in demand.”  Raw sugar for October delivery gained 1.1 cents, or 4.2
percent, to settle at 27.01 cents a pound at 2 p.m. on ICE
Futures U.S. in  New York , after touching 27.23 cents, the
highest since April 6.  Tunisia is seeking to buy 18,000 tons of refined sugar in a
tender today, according to two people with direct knowledge of
the process. The sugar is for delivery in August and offers are
due by 1 p.m. local time, said the people, who declined to be
identified because the information isn’t public.  Refined-sugar futures for August delivery climbed $38.80 or
5.3 percent, to $764.80 a ton on NYSE Liffe in London.  Cocoa for September delivery advanced $23, or 0.8 percent,
to $3,023 a ton on ICE.  In London, cocoa rose on NYSE Liffe.  To contact the reporters on this story:
