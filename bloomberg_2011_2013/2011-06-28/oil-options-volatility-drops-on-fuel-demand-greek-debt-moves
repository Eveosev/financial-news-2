Oil options volatility declined as
the underlying futures rose on speculation U.S. fuel demand will
rise before the July Fourth holiday and amid speculation that
Greek lawmakers will take steps to avoid debt default.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in

gauge of option prices, was 30 percent as of 2 p.m. in  New York ,
down from 31.3 percent yesterday.  Crude for August delivery advanced $2.28, or 2.5 percent,
