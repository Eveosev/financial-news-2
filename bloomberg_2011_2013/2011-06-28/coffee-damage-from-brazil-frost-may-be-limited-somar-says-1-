Coffee damage from a frost that
reached the Brazilian southern state of Parana yesterday and
today may have been limited to 50,000 bags, according to weather
forecaster Somar Meteorologia.  Temperatures overnight were 2 degrees Celsius (35.6 degrees
Fahrenheit) in the city of Londrina, in the northern region of
Parana, producing frost in some coffee growing areas, agronomist
Marco Antonio dos Santos said by phone from  Sao Paulo  today.  “Damage won’t exceed 50,000 bags,” he said, adding that
the amount corresponded to no more than 5 percent of the state’s
total coffee production.  Parana will produce 1.7 million bags of coffee in the
2011-12 marketing season, data from the  Agriculture Ministry ’s
crop forecasting agency, known as Conab, showed. That
corresponds to 4 percent of  Brazil ’s estimated production of
43.5 million bags, according to  Conab’s figures .  Temperatures also fell in the main coffee growing regions
of Sao Paulo and  Minas Gerais , Santos said. Frost was produced
only in “specific areas of small relevance for the national
production.”  The Guaxupe municipality experienced temperatures as low as
3 degrees Celsius, Santos said. Any crop losses in the region
would be “insignificant” compared to the country’s total
output, he added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
