China ’s hydropower generation rose
in June after the eastern and central regions received rainfall,
easing an electricity supply shortage, the nation’s top economic
planner said.  Daily hydropower generation gained 12 percent from two
weeks earlier to 2.31 billion kilowatt-hours in mid-June, the
National Development and Reform Commission said on its  website 
today. Rainfall that has increased hydropower production also
reduced the use of air-conditioners, easing electricity
shortages “noticeably” in Chongqing municipality and the
provinces of Zhejiang, Hunan and Anhui, the agency said.  About 20 provinces started rationing electricity this year,
the official Xinhua News Agency said May 3. Regions served by
the State Grid Corp. of China may face a shortfall of 40
gigawatts this summer, surpassing China’s worst in 2004, as
demand rises, the nation’s dominant power distributor said on
May 24.  Only Shanxi and Hebei provinces, among the 26 provinces
served by State Grid, have limited electricity use since June
10, according to today’s statement.  Power supply remains tight in southern China because of
high temperatures and insufficient coal supply, it said. Power
shortages in six provinces managed by Southern Power Grid Co.
reached 8.38 gigawatts on June 10, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
