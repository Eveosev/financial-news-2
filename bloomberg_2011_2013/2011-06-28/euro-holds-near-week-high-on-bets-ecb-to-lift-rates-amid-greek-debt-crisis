The euro was 0.3 percent from a one-
week high against the dollar on speculation the  European Central
Bank  will raise  interest rates  next week even as Greece
struggles to avoid a default.  The 17-nation currency traded near a two-week high against
the yen after ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet yesterday said
policy makers are in "strong vigilance mode," boosting rate-
increase expectations. Greece’s parliament today will vote on an
austerity package needed to secure more financial aid. The
dollar reached the strongest level against the yen in three
weeks yesterday as Treasury yields jumped, enhancing the allure
of U.S. assets.  “The euro’s got a bit more upside from here," said  Joseph Capurso , a currency strategist in Sydney at Commonwealth Bank of
 Australia , the nation’s biggest lender. "While we hear a lot
about  Greece , it’s really a lot of noise because the bottom line
is that the European economy is strong enough to get the ECB
raising rates.  The euro was at $1.4355 at 8:17 a.m. in  Tokyo  from $1.4371
in  New York  yesterday, when it reached $1.4397, the highest
since June 22. It’s down 0.3 percent against the greenback this
month and up 1.4 percent this quarter. The euro may reach $1.44
in the next day and will head toward $1.50 by the end of
September, Capurso said.  The euro was at 116.41 yen from 116.58, after reaching
116.67 yen yesterday, the highest since June 14. The dollar
fetched 81.10 yen from 81.12. It reached 81.27 yen yesterday,
the strongest since June 2.  ‘Anchor Inflation’  The ECB raised its benchmark rate in April for the first
time in almost three years, lifting it by a quarter point to
1.25 percent. The central bank will meet on July 7.  ‘‘We’re taking the decision progressively to anchor
inflation expectations,” Trichet said at a press conference in
Amsterdam following a seminar with central bankers from the
Asia-Pacific region. “As far as we’re concerned, we’re in
strong vigilance mode,” he said, repeating a phrase the ECB
uses to indicate a rate increase is imminent.  Greek lawmakers will vote on the austerity package and
again later on a measure to implement it. Prime Minister  George Papandreou  won a confidence vote in parliament last week by a
vote of 155-143.  Treasury 10-year yields gained 10 basis points to 3.03
percent yesterday, increasing the appeal of U.S. bonds to
international investors. The difference between 10-year yields
in the U.S. and  Japan  widened to 1.94 percentage points, the
most since June 14, according Bloomberg data.  To contact the reporters on this story:
