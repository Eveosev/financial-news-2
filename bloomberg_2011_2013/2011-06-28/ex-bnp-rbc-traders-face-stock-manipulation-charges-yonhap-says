South Korean prosecutors charged
four former employees of  BNP Paribas (BNP)  SA,  Royal Bank of Canada (RY) 
and two local brokerages with manipulating prices of stocks
linked to derivatives, Yonhap News reported.  The traders intentionally sold stocks to push down prices
in order to avoid paying returns to investors who bought
derivatives products tied to the equities, the Korean-language
news agency said, citing the  Seoul Central District Prosecutors’
Office . Calls by Bloomberg to the prosecutors’ office were
unanswered.  BNP Paribas said in an e-mail that the company can’t
comment on any ongoing proceedings by South Korean authorities.
An e-mail sent to Katherine Gay, a spokeswoman for RBC, wasn’t
immediately answered outside of business hours.  The two other traders worked for South Korean brokerages
Mirae Asset Securities Co. and Daewoo Securities Co., the Yonhap
report said. Spokespeople at Daewoo Securities and Mirae Asset
declined to comment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
