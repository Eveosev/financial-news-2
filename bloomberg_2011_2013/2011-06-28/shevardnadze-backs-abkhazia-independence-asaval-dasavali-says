Former Georgian President Eduard Shevardnadze said it would be “wise” for  Georgia  to recognize
the breakaway region of Abkhazia as an independent country.  “It’s clear Abkhazia can’t be a normal region of Georgia
any longer,” Shevardnadze said in an interview published today
in the  Asaval-Dasavali newspaper . Recognizing the region would
improve relations between Georgians and Abkhazians, he added,
the newspaper said.  Shevardnadze was responding to comments by Mamuka
Areshidze, an analyst at the Caucasus Strategic Research Center,
who said two weeks ago that Georgia should consider recognizing
Akhazia’s independence, Asaval-Dasavali reported.  Abkhazia and South Ossetia, another separatist region,
declared independence after a five-day war between Russia and
Georgia in August 2008. Only Russia, Nicaragua,  Venezuela  and
the South Pacific nation of Nauru recognize their independence.
Georgia maintains  Russia  occupied the two regions after the
conflict.  To contact the reporter on this story:
