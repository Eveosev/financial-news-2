(Corrects vote in second paragraph.)  The Senate Foreign Relations
Committee approved a resolution supporting President Barack Obama’s deployment of U.S. warplanes to support allied
bombardment of  Libya .  The bipartisan resolution was adopted on a 14-5 vote the
same day that lawmakers grilled an Obama administration lawyer
about the president’s assertion that U.S. warplanes aren’t
directly engaged in hostilities. The resolution now goes to the
full Senate for a vote.  Last week, the  House of Representatives  refused to
authorize Obama to continue support of the NATO mission. Members
also defeated legislation intended to bar U.S. forces from
engaging in hostilities. The House will likely revisit the issue
next month when it resumes debate, after a week-long recess, on
defense appropriations.  To contact the reporters on this story:
