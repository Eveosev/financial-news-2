     June 28 (Bloomberg) -- Treasuries fell, pushing five-year
note yields up the most since January, as speculation  Greece ’s
lawmakers will approve austerity measures cut demand at the $35
billion sale of the maturity to the lowest in a year.  Benchmark 10-year debt pared a monthly gain, pushing the
yields above 3 percent on reduced concern  Europe ’s debt crisis
will undermine the global economic recovery. The five-year note
auction’s bid-to-cover ratio, which gauges demand by comparing
total bids with amount of securities offered, was 2.59, the
lowest since June 2010.  “It was a weak auction,” said Sergey Bondarchuk, an
interest-rate strategist in New York at BNP Paribas SA, one of
the 20 primary dealers obligated to participate in U.S. debt
offerings. “People are not really bullish at these rates
because if there are hints of improvement out of Greece, that
could take yields higher.”  Yields on current five-year notes increased 13 basis
points, or 0.13 percentage point, to 1.58 percent at 5:14 p.m.
in  New York , according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 1.75
percent securities maturing in May 2016 dropped 5/8, or $6.25
per $1,000 face amount, to 100 26/32.  The five-year note yields earlier climbed 16 basis points,
the most on an intraday basis since Jan. 5, to 1.61 percent, the
highest level since June 15. The yields fell yesterday to 1.35
percent, the lowest since Nov. 23.  “We may have reached levels that were just a little bit
too rich for people,” said  Scott Sherman , an interest-rate
strategist in New York at the primary dealer Credit Suisse Group
AG. “The market just balked.”  Ten-Year Yields  A drop of almost a point in the 10-year note pushed yields
up 10 basis points to 3.03 percent after they dropped yesterday
to 2.84 percent, the lowest level since Dec. 1. The yields have
fallen three basis points in June.  At today’s five-year auction, the securities drew a yield
of 1.615 percent, compared with the average forecast of 1.580
percent in a Bloomberg News survey of nine primary dealers.  Indirect bidders, an investor class that includes foreign
central banks, purchased 37.6 percent of the notes, the lowest
level since February. Direct bidders, non-primary dealers that
place their bids directly with the Treasury, purchased 10.2
percent of the securities.  The offering is the second of three note auctions this week
totaling $99 billion. A record low yield of 0.395 percent at
yesterday’s $35 billion auction of two-year notes drew the
lowest demand in more than three years from indirect bidders.
The government is scheduled to sell $29 billion of seven-year
notes tomorrow.  ‘All-Time Low’  “Two-years were at an all-time low yesterday,” said John Fath, a principal at the investment firm BTG Pactual in New
York. “Five-years are not at an all-time low but certainly are
a lot less attractive than they were a couple of months ago with
inflation ticking up.” Five-year notes drew a record low yield
of 1.260 percent at the September offering.  The annual inflation rate accelerated in May to 3.6
percent, the fastest pace since October 2008, the Labor
Department reported June 15.  The difference between yields on 10-year notes and Treasury
Inflation Protected Securities, a gauge of trader expectations
for consumer prices over the life of the debt known as the
break-even rate, increased today to 2.30 percentage points, the
highest level since May.  In Greece, lawmakers vote tomorrow on the package that’s
needed before the cash-strapped nation can tap a fifth loan
payment from last year’s 110 billion-euro ($157 billion) rescue.
Failure to pass the government’s 78 billion-euro plan may lead
to the euro area’s first sovereign default.  Strike in Greece  Unions began their fourth general strike of the year today,
protesting Prime Minister  George Papandreou ’s five-year plan of
budget cuts and asset sales. Police estimated about 12,000
people joined rallies and marches to Parliament in  Athens  on the
first day of the 48-hour walkout.  Traders are betting the  Federal Reserve  will postpone
raising borrowing costs from record lows to support the  U.S.
economy . The odds of a rate increase by April 2012 dropped to 28
percent, from 34 percent a month ago, futures contracts
indicate. The central bank has held the target rate for
overnight lending at zero to 0.25 percent since December 2008.  The Fed bought $4.62 billion of Treasuries due from August
2018 to May 2021 today as part of its $600 billion program of
debt buying expiring this week.  Confidence among U.S. consumers unexpectedly fell in June
to a seven-month low, the Conference Board reported. The New
York research group’s index decreased to 58.5 from a revised
61.7 reading in May that was higher than previously estimated.
The percentage of respondents expecting an increase in job
availability fell to the lowest in 11 months.  Home values in 20 cities declined 4 percent in the 12
months to April, according to the S&P/Case-Shiller index. From
March to April, values fell 0.1 percent on a seasonally adjusted
basis, the smallest decline since July 2010.  To contact the reporters on this story:
