  Stocks in Switzerland  advanced,
paring weekly losses, as  China’s economy  slowed down for a sixth
quarter, fueling speculation policy makers will add to stimulus
measures.  Cie. Financiere Richemont SA led gains, adding 3.7 percent.
 Adecco SA (ADEN)  rose 2.6 percent after Morgan Stanley predicted a
short-term price increase.  Ems-Chemie (EMSN)  Holding AG climbed 1.2
percent after the Swiss supplier of resins to General Motors Co.
raised its 2012 sales and profit forecast.  The  Swiss Market Index (SMI)  climbed 0.6 percent to 6,181.81 in
Zurich, and closed little changed for the week. The benchmark
gauge has rallied 8.2 percent since its 2012 low on June 4 as
Greek leaders formed a government and global central banks added
stimulus to boost growth. The broader Swiss Performance Index
added 0.5 percent today.  “They’ve got a lot of scope for just conventional measures
intended to stimulate demand,”  Mike Lenhoff , chief strategist
at Brewin Dolphin Securities Ltd. in  London , said in a Bloomberg
Television interview with Caroline Hyde. “I think with the
determination of the Chinese to do that we are going to see some
modest pickup in momentum in the second-half of the year.”  Chinese Economy  China’s growth slowed for a sixth quarter to the weakest
pace since the global financial crisis, putting pressure on
Premier  Wen Jiabao  to boost stimulus to secure a second-half
economic rebound.  Gross domestic product  expanded 7.6 percent last quarter
from a year earlier, the National Bureau of Statistics said
today. The pace, a three-year low, compares with an 8.1 percent
gain in the previous period and the 7.7 percent median forecast
of economists. Industrial production increased at a slower pace
in June while retail sales growth decelerated.  Italian borrowing costs fell at an auction today. The
nation sold 3.5 billion euros ($4.3 billion) of new three-year
bonds, matching a maximum target, and auctioned 1.75 billion
euros of three longer-dated securities. The Rome-based Treasury
sold the 2015 bond at 4.65 percent, down from the 5.3 percent
paid on a similar-maturity bond on June 14.  Richemont gained 3.7 percent to 50.20 Swiss francs.  Swatch
Group AG (UHR) ,  the world’s largest watchmaker,  rose 1.3 percent to
351.10 francs.  Adecco SA, the world’s largest supplier of temporary
workers, advanced 2.6 percent to 41.41 francs. Morgan Stanley
said the stock has the potential to “move materially” over the
next 15 to 60 days on financial results or news flow.  Ems-Chemie Forecast  Ems-Chemie climbed 1.2 percent to 180 francs. The company
said this year’s net sales and operating profit will be
“slightly above” the figures for 2011. That compares with a
forecast in April that revenue and earnings wouldn’t grow.  The company also posted first-half earnings before interest
and taxes that rose 6.9 percent from a year earlier to 167
million Swiss francs ($169.7 million), beating the 158 million-
franc average in a Bloomberg survey.  Swisscom AG (SCMN) , Switzlerland’s  biggest telephone company ,
gained 1.5 percent to 383.40 francs while Transocean Ltd., the
owner of deepwater oil rigs, gained 2.9 percent to 44.92 francs.  Temenos Group AG (TEMN)  surged 5.9 percent to 10.85 francs,
rebounding from a 28 percent slump yesterday. The banking-
software maker had fallen the most in 3 1/2 years after cutting
its revenue-growth forecast and saying its chief executive
officer will step down.  BB Biotech AG (BION)  gained 7.4 percent to 88 francs, the highest
since September 2008. The company rejected an offer from
Vontobel Holding AG to restructure the Swiss biotechnology
investor from its current status as a listed-investment company
into an unlisted investment fund, according to a statement from
BB Biotech.  Sika AG (SIK) , Europe’s  biggest maker of chemicals  used in
construction, slid 4.1 percent to 1,770 francs. The stock was
cut to hold from buy at  Vontobel Holding AG. (VONN)   The volume of shares changing hands in SMI-listed companies
