At least 20 people died after a
freight train hit a truck carrying farmworkers in  South Africa ’s
Mpumalanga province, Joseph Mabuza, a spokesman for the
province’s Department of Community Safety, Security and Liaison,
said.  Nineteen people died at the scene near Hectorspruit, about
40km from the Mozambique border, and another died on the way to
hospital, Mabuza said by mobile-phone at the site. Emergency
workers took about 24 of the injured to hospital, he said.  The accident took place around 6 a.m. when “it seems the
truck was crossing the railway line. It’s a very gruesome
scene,” Mabuza said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
