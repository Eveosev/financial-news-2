Chief executive officers should do
five things “to put pressure on Washington” concerning the
ballooning national debt,  David Cote , chief executive officer of
 Honeywell International Inc. (HON)  wrote in the Financial Times.  Those five things, Cote said, are: bring up the issue on
every talk with a politician; mention it in every speech;
educate employees on the matter and urge them to raise it with
their Congressional representatives; push for a presidential
candidates’ debate on debt and support the Campaign to Fix the
Debt.  If the debt is not properly dealt with, it will become “an
unconscionable $21 trillion (about 85 percent of GDP) in 10
years,” Cote wrote. “It will doom us to five years of 1
percent real GDP growth and 8 percent unemployment,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
