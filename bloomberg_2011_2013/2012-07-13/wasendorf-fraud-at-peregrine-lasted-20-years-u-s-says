Peregrine Financial Group Inc. Chief
Executive Officer Russell Wasendorf said in a signed statement
linked to his suicide attempt that he perpetrated a fraud at his
 Cedar Falls , Iowa-based company that stretched back two decades,
according to a federal complaint.  Wasendorf was charged by U.S. prosecutors with making false
statements to federal regulators and is to appear in court later
today in Cedar Rapids.  Peregrine filed for bankruptcy a day after the National
Futures Association said it identified a shortfall of about $200
million in customer funds on deposit.  Its bankruptcy petition lists more than $500 million in
assets and more than $100 million in liabilities. The broker
estimates it has more than 10,000 creditors, according to the
filing.  The bankruptcy case is Peregrine Financial Group Inc., 12-
27488,  U.S. Bankruptcy Court , Northern District of Illinois
(Chicago). The regulatory case is U.S. Commodity Futures Trading
Commission v. Peregrine Financial Group Inc., 12-cv-5383, U.S.
District Court, Northern District of  Illinois  (Chicago).  To contact the reporter on this story:
