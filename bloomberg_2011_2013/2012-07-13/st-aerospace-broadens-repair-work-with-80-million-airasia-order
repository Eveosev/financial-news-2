Singapore Technologies Aerospace
Ltd. extended a component repair contract with AirAsia, adding
$80 million in work as it bolsters its services division serving
airlines.  ST Aerospace will maintain an additional 75 of AirAsia’s
fleet of Airbus A320s, extending an existing contract covering
100 planes, said Chang Cheow Teck, president of ST Aerospace, in
an interview at the Farnborough Air Show. The agreement spans 10
years, with ST Aerospace getting monthly fees to cover any
maintenance needed.  ST Aerospace’s strategy is to offer a range of services
including maintenance and repair of engines and landing gear,
as well as pilot training,and engineering, including conversion
of passenger planes to freighters.  “Our ambition is to be an international total aviation
support player,” said Chang. “On the  Airbus A320  and  Boeing Co. (BA) 
737NG we can support engines, airframes, and components. And now
we’re looking at asset management, even providing pilots.”  ST Aerospace is already the world’s largest commercial
airframe maintenance and repair provider, with customers
including airlines, air freight companies and military plane
operators. It started out in military work and introduced
services for civil aircraft in 1990. It now derives three
quarters of revenue from the civil area.  Chang expects revenue for 2012 to be ’’comparable within 5
percent’’ to that of 2011, while profit will be better, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
