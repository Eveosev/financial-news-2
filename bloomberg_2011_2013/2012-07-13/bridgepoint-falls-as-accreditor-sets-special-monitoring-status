Bridgepoint Education Inc. (BPI) , the for-
profit college that owns Ashford University, plunged to a record
low in  New York  trading after an accreditor put the school on
“special monitoring” status.  Bridgepoint fell 25 percent to $9.77, the lowest since the
stock began trading in April 2009. Ashford received a letter
yesterday from the  Higher Learning Commission  of the North
Central Association of Schools and Colleges saying that the
college must produce a report by Aug. 10, Bridgepoint said today
in a statement.  The Western Association of Schools and Colleges, a regional
accreditor, denied Ashford’s application for accreditation, the 
school said on July 9. The school is appealing the decision. The 
Higher Learning Commission told Ashford to host an advisory 
visit in the next 60 days, and the commission will review 
information on Ashford at its meeting in February, according to 
the statement.  “We are accredited and will continue our critical service
to our non-traditional students, largely comprised of working
adults and underserved populations,” said Elizabeth Tice,
Ashford’s president and chief executive officer, in the
statement.  Bridgepoint, based in  San Diego , has lost more than half
its value this week.  To contact the reporters on this story:
