Northeast Utilities (NU) , New England’s
largest utility owner, rose to a record as investors sought a
safe investment in the face of the European crisis and U.S.
economic slowdown.  Northeast, based in Boston and Hartford, Connecticut,
 surged  2.1 percent to $39.88 at the close in New York, the
highest since shares began trading publicly in 1980.  “Utilities in general are doing well recently,” Andrew Weisel, a New York-based analyst at Macquarie Capital USA Inc.,
said in a phone interview today. “The treasury yield is below
1.5 percent for the 10-year note whereas utility stocks yield
over 4 percent on average. This is definitely a flock to
safety.”  The  Bloomberg Americas Utilities Index (BUSUTIL) , which has gained
3.5 percent this year, today reached its highest level since
September 2008. Northeast completed its $5.04 billion takeover
of Nstar in April, creating the region’s largest utility owner.  To contact the reporter on this story:
