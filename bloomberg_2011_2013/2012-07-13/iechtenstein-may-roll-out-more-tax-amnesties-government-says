Liechtenstein, the Alpine
principality of 36,000 wedged between Switzerland and Austria,
may announce further tax amnesties along the lines of its
disclosure treaty with the U.K.  “We are in discussion with a number of countries on such
an approach,” Katja Gey, the director of the office of
 international financial affairs  of the government of
Liechtenstein, said in a telephone interview. “There has been
interest, but so far we have not come close to a possible
conclusion of a similar treaty.”  The Liechtenstein Disclosure Facility with the U.K. was
implemented in 2010, offering wealthy Britons the chance to
“come clean” on unpaid taxes. About 2,400 people with bank
accounts in Liechtenstein have agreed to disclose unpaid tax
owed to the U.K., the revenue and customs office said last
month.  The disclosure facility aims to raise as much as 3 billion
pounds ($4.6 billion) by 2016, according to the revenue office.
The principality and the U.K. formally signed a new double
taxation treaty on June 11, setting out provisions on
administrative assistance in tax matters in line with the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development’s Model
Tax Convention.  To contact the reporter on this story:
