Corn futures extended a fourth
weekly gain in Chicago, the best run since November, as drought
in the U.S. worsens yield losses in a crop already in the
 poorest  condition since 1988. Wheat and soybeans also rose.  December-delivery corn rose 2 percent to $7.47 a bushel on
the Chicago Board of Trade by 2:01 p.m. London time. That took
this week’s advance to 7.8 percent. The last time the most-
active contract advanced four straight weeks or more was in the
period to Nov. 4. Prices have rallied 18 percent this month and
48 percent since mid-June.  Areas in the U.S. Midwest  suffering  from moderate to
extreme drought expanded to about 63 percent as of July 10 from
53 percent a week earlier, the National Drought Mitigation
Center said yesterday. The U.S. government cut its outlook for
the domestic corn crop, the world’s largest, by 12 percent on
July 11, just a month after predicting a record harvest.  “The operators remain riveted to the  weather forecasts ,
knowing that in the short term the models don’t forecast rain
for the most vulnerable areas,” Paris-based farm adviser
Agritel wrote on its website today. “The yield outlook
inevitably remains penalized by the current conditions in this
critical development phase.”  The  U.S. Department of Agriculture  cut its outlook for the
corn harvest to 12.97 billion bushels (329.45 million metric
tons) this year from a June prediction of 14.79 billion bushels.
The forecast for global output was cut to 905.2 million tons
from 949.9 million tons last month. Futures rose to $7.48 a
bushel on July 11, which at that point was the highest price
since Sept. 13.  ‘Irreversible Damage’  “The drought condition is not expected to change,”
Lynette Tan, an analyst at Phillip Futures Pte, said in a report
e-mailed today. “Traders realized rains forecast in parts of
the Midwest were too little to be of significant relief to the
irreversible damage caused to the crop.”  China , the world’s second-largest corn user after the U.S.,
may  import  at least 8 million tons in 2012-13 from about 5
million tons in 2011-12, Jean Yves Chow, senior industry analyst
at Rabobank International, said in an interview.  Japan  may
import 16 million tons, up from 15.5 million tons, he said.  Wheat for September delivery rose 1.9 percent to $8.6325 a
bushel, headed for a fourth weekly increase. Milling wheat for
November delivery traded on NYSE Liffe in Paris advanced 2.3
percent to 260 euros ($316.58) a ton, the highest since the
contract started trading in March 2011.  Soybeans for November delivery gained 1.5 percent to $15.52
a bushel in  Chicago , also set for a fourth weekly gain.  To contact the reporters on this story:
