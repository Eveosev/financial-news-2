Ethiopia’s government plans to open a
$45 million information-technology park next year to try and
establish computer-related industries by advertising its low-
wage advantage, the project manager said.  ZTE Corp. (000063) ,  China ’s second-largest maker of phone equipment,
is building the telecommunication infrastructure for the 200-
hectare (494-acre) facility on outskirts of Addis Ababa, project
manager Berhanu Keleta said yesterday.  “The objective is to develop an information communication
technology industry by providing a conducive environment,” he
said in an interview in the Ethiopian capital yesterday.  The government, which has a state monopoly on
telecommunications, says it wants to attract businesses
including call-centers and computer hardware assembly plants to
the park, which will have Internet speeds of as much as 40
gigabytes a second, he said.  The government of Africa’s second-most populous nation is
trying to attract service and manufacturing industries as it
diversifies the economy away from reliance on agriculture.  To contact the reporter on this story:
