Colombia ’s peso bonds rose, posting
the biggest weekly gain since April, as waning inflation
expectations and speculation the central bank will lower
interest rates boosted the appeal of the fixed-rate securities.  Yields on Colombia’s 11.25 percent peso-denominated debt
due October 2018 fell three basis points, or 0.03 percentage
point, to 6.27 percent today, according to the central bank. The
yield fell 14 basis points this week, the most since the week
ended April 13. The bond’s price rose 0.174 centavo today to
125.138 centavos per peso.  “Inflation is low and the economy is decelerating,
indicating we might see a rate cut,” said Eduardo Bolanos, an
analyst at Asesores en Valores brokerage in Bogota. Bonds with
longer maturities, including debt maturing in July 2024 and
August 2026, have room for further gains, he said.  Banco de la Republica held the  overnight lending rate  at
5.25 percent for a fourth straight month on June 29 as growth
cooled and prices of the country’s commodity exports dropped.
Since the start of 2011, the bank has raised the key rate nine
times even as other  emerging markets  cut borrowing costs in
response to  Europe ’s debt crisis.  More than one member of the central bank’s seven-member
board voted for a quarter-point  interest rate  cut last month and
wanted the bank to begin a “relaxation phase,” according to
the  minutes  of the policy meeting published today.  Reports in June showed industrial output and retail sales
unexpectedly fell in April and the economy expanded 4.7 percent
in the first quarter, the slowest pace since 2010.  Inflation Outlook  Colombia’s inflation will end this year at 3.08 percent,
according to the median forecast in a  central bank survey 
published July 11. Annual inflation slowed to 3.20 percent in
June, within the central bank’s 2 percent to 4 percent target.  The peso climbed 0.6 percent to 1,775.97 per dollar. It
rose 0.5 percent this week and has jumped 9.2 percent this year,
the best performance among all currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  Increased portfolio investment flows, attracted by higher
interest rates in Colombia, are helping gains in the peso, said
Bolanos.  To contact the reporter on this story:
