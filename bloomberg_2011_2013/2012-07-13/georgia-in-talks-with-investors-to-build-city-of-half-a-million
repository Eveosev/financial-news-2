Georgia  began talks with potential
investors to build a city of half a million people on its Black
Sea coast after lawmakers backed a decision to grant the site
“special constitutional status.”  “We are in talks with large Chinese corporations, Iranian,
Azeri, Ukrainian investors to develop this project,” Iva
Davitaia, director of the Strategic Development Agency, said by
phone today from the capital, Tbilisi, declining to name the
companies because the talks aren’t yet complete. A selected
investor will “develop and manage the area,” he said.  The city, to be called Lazica, will be located near the
breakaway republic of Abkhazia and will include a commercial
center as well as a port. The project may take 10 years to
complete and require as much as $10 billion in investment,
Davitaia said.  While being under Georgian administration, the area’s
special status means that a separate form of governance and
jurisdiction will apply over its civil courts to lure capital,
Davitaia said.  If completed, the new city will be the country’s second-
biggest. Tbilisi is the nation’s largest city with a population
of more than 1 million.  A poll conducted by the National Democratic Institute
showed Lazica’s construction was supported by 54 percent of
those aware of the initiative and 42 percent of respondents said
most of the money should come from foreign investors.  Abkhazia declared independence from Georgia after a war in
the early 1990s that left hundreds of thousands displaced.
Georgia considers it part of its territory.  To contact the reporter on this story:
