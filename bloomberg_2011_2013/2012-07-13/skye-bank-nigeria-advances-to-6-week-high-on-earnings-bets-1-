rose to its strongest level in more than six weeks as investors
speculated it will post improved first-half earnings.  The stock rose 1 percent to 3.02 naira by the close in
Lagos, the commercial capital, its highest since May 30.  “The stock fell when it was trading at 4 naira about two
months ago, but it’s gradually rising,” Raheem Mohammed, chief
operating officer of Lagos-based Kundila Finance Ltd.
said. “The prediction is that it will soon get back to 4 naira,
especially if it’s half-year result is good.”  Skye is expected to release its results within weeks.

head office in Lagos.  Profit after tax for the three months through March rose to
3.48 billion naira ($21.5 million) from 3.4 billion naira a year
