A Touareg rebel movement in  Mali 
called on the international community to help drive out
“terrorist groups” from the north where it declared
independence.  The  National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad  said
it’s been forced to “involuntarily cohabitate with terrorist
groups” since its unilateral secession in April, according to a
statement on its website yesterday from neighboring Burkina
Faso. The group is “constantly aware of impending clashes with
these destabilizing groups,” it said.  Islamist rebels seeking to impose Shariah law in the
impoverished West African nation took control of key towns in
the north after clashes with Touareg insurgents last month.  The Islamists, including a group linked to al-Qaeda and the
Ansar ud-Din, “Defenders of the Faith,” initially collaborated
with the Touareg rebels after the March 22 coup that ousted
President Amadou Toure in the capital, Bamako.  No country has recognized the Touaregs’ declaration of
independence.  The Economic Community of West African States has asked the
 United Nations Security Council  for a mandate backing military
intervention in the country.  French Foreign Affairs Minister Laurent Fabius said today
that intervention led by Africans is likely “at one moment or
another,”  Agence France-Presse  reported yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
