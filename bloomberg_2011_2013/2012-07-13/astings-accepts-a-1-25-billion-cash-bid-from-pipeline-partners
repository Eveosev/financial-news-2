Hastings Diversified Utilities Fund (HDF) ,
an Australian natural-gas pipeline owner, accepted a A$1.25
billion ($1.27 billion) cash offer from Pipeline Partners
Australia Pty.  Hastings Diversified recommended the offer of A$2.35 a
share from Pipeline Partners, a group that includes Caisse de
Depot et Placement du Quebec and another Hastings fund, the
Melbourne-based company said today in a statement. The bid, made
in May, trumped a December cash and share offer from  APA Group (APA) 
worth A$1.12 billion today.  The offer, which includes a 2.5 cent cash distribution,
compares with Hastings share price of A$2.36 today. It remains
conditional on independent analysis concluding that it’s “fair
and reasonable” and there being no higher bid, Hastings said.  Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC) , which holds about 8.1 percent of
Hastings Diversified, agreed to accept the offer, Pipeline
Partners said today. Caisse de Depot, which oversees $159
billion of assets, and Utilities Trust of  Australia , an
infrastructure fund managed by Hastings Funds Management, are
the main backers of the offer, Pipeline Partners said.  The earlier bid from APA, whose pipelines carry more than
half of Australia’s natural gas, was an offer of 0.326 APA
shares and 50 cents in cash.  To contact the reporter on this story:
