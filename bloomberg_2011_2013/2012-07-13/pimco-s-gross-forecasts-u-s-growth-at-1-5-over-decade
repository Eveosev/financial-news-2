Bill Gross , who runs the world’s
biggest bond  fund  at Pacific Investment Management Co.,
forecasts real growth in the U.S. will be about 1.5 percent a
year for at least the next 10 years.  Slower labor-force expansion, overextended credit and
potential geopolitical or environmental shocks will limit growth
as the economy struggles to duplicate previous productivity
gains, Gross said in a July 11 telephone interview.  “Slower growth means lower returns on capital,” Gross
said. “If real GDP grows at 1.5 percent, then a diversified
portfolio of stocks and bonds would probably grow at 1.5
percent, as well.”  Gross’s prediction contrasts with those of 72 economists in
a Bloomberg survey, who estimate median real gross domestic
product will expand more than 2 percent a year through 2014, the
last year for which forecast data is available. The economists
estimate 2.1 percent growth this year, 2.2 percent in 2013 and
2.9 percent the following year.  Gross kept holdings of Treasuries in his $263 billion
flagship Total Return Fund steady in June at 35 percent, the
highest since February, after saying that U.S. securities are
still the safest bet.  Treasuries returned 2.65 percent as of July 12, according
to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes, while the  Standard &
Poor’s  500 index of  stocks  returned 7.37 percent with reinvested
dividends.  Federal Reserve policy makers now see 1.9 percent to 2.4
percent growth in 2012, down from their April forecast of 2.4
percent to 2.9 percent, according to a statement on June 20. The
 International Monetary Fund  cut its projections on July 3 for
U.S. growth to 2 percent this year and about 2.25 percent in
2013 amid a “tepid” recovery and the  European debt crisis .  To contact the reporters on this story:
