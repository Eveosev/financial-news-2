Canadian stocks advanced, paring a
weekly decline, as  oil prices  rose on speculation that  China ’s
government will boost stimulus measures and gold gained for the
first time in four days.  Goldcorp Inc. (G)  and China Gold International Resources Corp.
added at least 2.1 percent.  Suncor Energy (SU)  Inc., the nation’s
largest oil company, climbed 1.9 percent. Energy, raw-materials
and financial shares contributed most to the advance in the
 Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index (SPTSX) , with nine of 10 groups
advancing.  The S&P/TSX gained 89.06 points, or 0.8 percent, to
11,514.53, with almost three stocks rising for each that fell in
the gauge. For the week, the Canadian equity benchmark lost 1.3
percent, the biggest decline in six weeks.  “The China GDP number was certainly weaker than a lot of
people expected,” Andrew Hamlin, who manages C$80 million for
Toronto-based  Aston Hill Financial Inc. (AHF) , said in a phone
interview. “What we have is bad news that maybe is not so bad
news, because it could potentially open the door to new stimulus
in China.”  China’s growth slowed for a sixth quarter to the weakest
pace since the global financial crisis, raising speculation that
Premier  Wen Jiabao  will boost stimulus to secure a second-half
economic rebound. Gross domestic product expanded 7.6 percent
last quarter, the National Bureau of Statistics said today in
Beijing. The number was in line with China’s 2012 target, which
was lowered to 7.5 percent in early March.  Commodities Rise                Goldcorp gained 2.5 percent to C$34.53 as the metal rallied
1.5 percent on the Comex in New York. China Gold International
rose 2.2 percent to C$2.81.  Oil advanced for a third day, its longest winning streak in
a month. Suncor Energy climbed 1.9 percent to C$29.41.  Cenovus
Energy Inc. (CVE)  increased 2.1 percent to C$33.28.  Canadian Natural
Resources Ltd. (CNQ) , the nation’s third-largest energy company,
gained 1.2 percent to C$26.41.  Baja Mining Corp., which is building a  copper mine  in
 Mexico , fell 13 percent to 14 cents, the lowest since 2003. The
company said it has not yet found new sources of funding and may
not have enough cash to continue operations by next month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
