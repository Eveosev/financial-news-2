Munich Re , the world’s biggest
reinsurer, agreed to buy six wind parks in  Germany  from
developer Wpd AG as part of a plan to invest 2.5 billion euros
($3 billion) in renewable energy and new technologies.  Munich Re made the “double-digit millions” investment via
its MEAG Munich Ergo AssetManagement GmbH unit, the company said
today in a statement, without giving a specific figure.  The reinsurer has bought solar and onshore wind operations
in  Europe  since starting its investment program in 2010. Munich
Re and Germany’s largest insurer Allianz SE have picked up
renewable energy assets to benefit from their long-term returns
as equities continue to suffer from volatility.  The wind parks in North-Rhine Westphalia, Saxony Anhalt,
Brandenburg and Mecklenburg Vorpommern have a total capacity of
48 megawatts, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
