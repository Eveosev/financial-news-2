PDG Realty SA Empreendimentos e
Participacoes ,  Brazil ’s biggest homebuilder, is poised for its
highest closing price in a week after shareholders approved an
800 million-real ($392.6 million) capital injection to bolster
its finances.  Shares gained 3.7 percent to 3.33 reais at 2 p.m. in Sao
Paulo. A close at that level would be the highest since July 6.
The BM&FBovespa Real Estate Index rose 0.6 percent.  PDG’s shareholders approved a capitalization from the
investment fund Vinci Partners Investimentos Ltda. at a meeting
yesterday, according to a regulatory filing. Earlier this week,
PDG cut its new-project target for 2012 to a range of 4 billion
reais to 5 billion reais, from 8 billion reais to 9 billion
reais, citing a slowdown in demand.  “The capitalization, coupled with the material reduction
in 2012 launches guidance, seem to be important moves toward a
more comfortable financial position,” Alexandre Amson, an
analyst at Banco Santander Brasil SA, said in a note to clients
dated today. “The capitalization optimizes PDG’s capital
structure, reducing net debt-to-equity from approximately 80
percent to approximately 60 percent.”  PDG has retreated 46 percent this year through yesterday
while the Bovespa slid 5.9 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
