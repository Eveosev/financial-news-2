Brazil  will set fuel-efficiency and
emission standards on all cars sold in the country, Valor
Economico SA reported, without saying where it got the
information.  Carmakers will need to lower their vehiclesâ€™ emissions to
135 grams (4.8 ounces) of carbon dioxide a kilometer by 2017 to
avoid higher taxes, down from an average of about 170 grams now,
the Sao Paulo-based newspaper said today in an  article . A decree
calling for the new standards is expected to be issued next
week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
