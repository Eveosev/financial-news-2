Nigeria ,  Africa ’s most populous
nation with at least 164 million people, is planning to boost
the supply of water in cities and rural areas across the
country, the government said.  Providing “sufficient potable water and adequate
sanitation to all Nigerians in an affordable and sustainable
way” is the government’s target, Minister of Water Resources
Sarah Reng Ochekpe said from Abuja in a statement.  Urban water supply coverage in Africa’s largest oil
producer is targeted to rise from 65 percent to 70 percent this
year and to 85 percent by 2015 with improved sanitation coverage
doubling to 65 percent by 2015, the minister said.  The government with the aid of the private sector also
plans to raise rural water supply coverage from 44 percent to 60
percent this year and to 75 percent by 2015, she said. Boosting
Niberia’s water infrastructure would aid in crop irrigation and
the agriculture industry, she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
