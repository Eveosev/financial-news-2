Andritz AG (ANDR)  rose for a second day
after UBS AG said that its acquisition of German metal-forming
machine-maker  Schuler AG (SCUN)  may be a “bargain.”  Shares  climbed  2.3 percent to 41.6 euros at the 5:30 p.m.
close of trading in Vienna. Andritz stock has advanced 30
percent this year, valuing the world’s second-biggest maker of
hydro-power turbines at 4.3 billion euros ($5.3 billion).  “The Schuler acquisition will, in our view, add a high-
quality machinery company to Andritz,” Sven Weier, an analyst
at UBS in  Frankfurt , wrote in a note to customers. “The
purchase price could turn out to be a bargain if auto capital
expenditure does not collapse as it did after Lehman, and if
Andritz succeeds on obvious synergies such as cross-selling and
execution.”  Schuler’s supervisory and management board yesterday said
Andritz’s offer price of 20 euros a share was “financially
adequate” and recommended shareholder accept the offer.  “We may sound like a broken record but Andritz remains our
key pick,” Weier said. He rates Andritz at buy and raised its
share price estimate to 49 euros from 45 euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
