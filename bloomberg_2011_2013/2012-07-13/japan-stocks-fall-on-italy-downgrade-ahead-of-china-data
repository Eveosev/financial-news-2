     July 13 (Bloomberg) --　Most Japanese  stocks  rose on reports
China’s growth slowed, boosting urgency for stimulus to shore up
the world’s second-biggest economy. Gains in shares were limited
after Italy’s debt rating was cut by Moody’s Investors Service.  Fanuc Corp. (6954) , which supplies robots for Chinese factories,
added 2.5 percent.  Canon Inc. (7751) , a camera maker that gets 31
percent of its revenue in  Europe , fell 1.1 percent. Dentsu Inc.,
 Japan ’s biggest advertising agency, fell 7 percent after
agreeing to buy Britain’s Aegis Group Plc in a 3.16 billion-
pound ($4.9 billion) deal.  The  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  rose less than 0.1 percent to
8,724.12 at the 3 p.m. trading close in  Tokyo , snapping a six-
day loss. The gauge slid 3.3 percent this week, the first weekly
loss in six weeks. The broader Topix Index dropped 0.2 percent
to 746.34 after swinging between gains and losses 25 times.  “The market is asking for more policy measures out of
 China , and I’m concerned investors’ hopes may be too high,”
said Akihiro Tsunoda, a senior investment manager at Sompo Japan
Nipponkoa Asset Management Co., which oversees about 5 trillion
yen ($63 billion). “It was about time for a rebound because
there haven’t been convincing factors to justify a six-day
loss.”  The Topix rebounded about 7.3 percent since June 4, when it
closed at its lowest since 1983, as concern eased about Europe’s
debt crisis after bailout terms were eased for lenders and on
optimism central banks around the world will ease policy.  The gain has lifted the average price of shares on the
Japanese gauge to 0.9 times book value, compared with 2.1 times
for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 1.4 times for the Europe
Stoxx 600 Index. A number below one means investors can buy
companies for less than the value of their assets.  China Slowdown  China’s economy  expanded 7.6 percent last quarter from a
year earlier, the government said today. It was the slowest
growth in three years, missing economists’ estimates of a 7.7
percent expansion. Industrial production and retail sales also
increased at a slower pace in June. Separately, Singapore’s
economy unexpectedly shrank and South Korea’s central bank cut
the nation’s outlook.  China’s new loans beat estimates in June, boosting odds the
government will secure an economic rebound. Banks extended 919.8
billion  yuan  ($144.2 billion) of local-currency loans, the
People’s Bank of China said yesterday. That compares with the
880 billion yuan median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey.  Exporters to China rose. Fanuc added 2.5 percent to 12,410
yen.  Hitachi Construction Machinery Co (6305) , a machinery maker that
depends on China for 17 percent of its sales, gained 1.3 percent
1,346 yen.  Italy Downgrade  Futures on the  S&P 500 (SPXL1)  rose 0.2 percent today. The gauge
fell 0.5 percent in  New York  yesterday, dropping for a sixth day,
the longest losing streak since May 18, on concern that the
global slowdown is hurting earnings.  Companies that do business in Europe fell after Italy’s
sovereign debt rating was cut by Moody’s, which maintained its
negative outlook. The euro area’s third-biggest economy faces
higher funding costs, slower growth and contagion risk from
Greece and Spain.  Canon lost 1.1 percent to 2,971 yen.  Konica Minolta
Holdings Inc. (4902) , a maker of photo films that gets 28 percent of
its sales in Europe, fell 1 percent to 580 yen.  The  Nikkei 225 Volatility Index (VNKY)  fell 3.8 percent to 18.97,
indicating traders expect a swing of about 5.4 percent on the
benchmark gauge over the next 30 days. Trading volume on the
Nikkei 225 was 4.7 percent above the 30-day average after
traders settled on the price of options on the equity benchmark
for July.  Dentsu Drops  Dentsu fell the most on the Nikkei 225 after agreeing to
buy Aegis Group. The transaction, the biggest in Dentsu’s
history, will probably boost its goodwill assets to just under
340 billion yen ($4.3 billion), Bank of America Merrill Lynch
said in a report dated July 12. The advertising company’s stock
slumped 7 percent to 2,145 yen, the biggest decline since March
2011.  “There need to be good business synergies to justify the
price,” Masamitsu Ohki, a  fund manager  at Tokyo-based Stats
Investment Management Co., said by phone today. “Taking all
those into consideration, the deal may be negative for Dentsu
stock.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
