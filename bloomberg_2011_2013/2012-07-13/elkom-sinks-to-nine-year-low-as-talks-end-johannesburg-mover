Telkom South Africa Ltd. (TKG) , Africa’s
largest fixed-line phone operator, fell to the lowest in more
than nine years after it officially terminated talks with South
Korea’s  KT Corp. (030200)   “Shareholders are advised caution is no longer required to
be exercised by shareholders when trading in the company’s
securities,” the Pretoria-based company said in a statement
today.  Telkom shares declined 1 percent to 18.01 rand at the 5
p.m. close in Johannesburg, the weakest price since June 2003.  Telkom said on June 1 that the South African  government 
decided not to support the proposed sale of a 20 percent stake
to KT Corp., South Korea’s largest phone and Internet company.
The government is Telkom’s biggest investor with 39.8 percent of
its shares and state-pensions manager the Public Investment
Corp. owns an additional 9.7 percent, according to  data  compiled
by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story: Sikonathi Mantshantsha in
