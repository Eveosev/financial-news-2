India ’s 10-year bonds completed a
second weekly advance on speculation the central bank will ease
monetary policy to arrest an economic slowdown.  Industrial  output  rose 2.4 percent in May from a year
earlier, compared with an average gain of 5.1 percent in the
previous two years, the  Central Statistical Office  said in a
statement yesterday. The  economy  expanded 5.3 percent in the
three months through March, the slowest pace in nine years.  “There is cyclical downward pressure on growth,” said J.
Moses Harding, executive vice president at  IndusInd Bank Ltd. (IIB)  in
Mumbai. “It’s a matter of time before the central bank
initiates some monetary-easing measures.”  The yield on the 8.15 percent notes due June 2022 declined
six basis points, or 0.06 percentage point, this week to 8.10
percent in Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading
system. The rate was little changed today.  The  Reserve Bank  of India, which cut its repurchase rate
last quarter for the first time since 2009, will review its
policy on July 31. The monetary authority reduced its  repurchase
rate  by 50 basis points to 8 percent in April, after raising it
by a record 375 basis points through 2010 and 2011. Governor
Duvvuri Subbarao held the repo  rate  at 8 percent at a meeting on
June 18.  Lenders’ cash reserve  requirements  has been cut by 125
basis points this year to 4.75 percent.  The government sold 160 billion rupees ($2.9 billion) of
notes due in 2017, 2022, 2030 and 2036 today.  One-year  interest-rate swaps , or derivative contracts used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, fell 12 basis
points this week to 7.62 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. They rose four basis points today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
