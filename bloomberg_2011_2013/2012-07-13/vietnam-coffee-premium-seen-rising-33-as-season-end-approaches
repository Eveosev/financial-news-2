The premium buyers have to pay to
obtain coffee from Vietnam, the biggest robusta producer, rose
33 percent over the past week as the 2011-12 season there nears
its end, according to Volcafe Ltd.  Vietnamese coffee for July and August shipment was at a
premium of $80 a metric ton to the price on the NYSE Liffe
exchange in  London , the unit of commodities trader ED&F Man
Holdings Ltd. said in a report e-mailed today. That compares
with $60 a ton last week, data from the trader show.  “Differentials are still very firm, as expected for the
time of year,” Volcafe, based in Winterthur,  Switzerland , said
in the report. “In general, everything has quieted down a
little bit for the summer holidays.” A differential is a
discount or a premium paid to obtain physical coffee in relation
to the price on the futures market.  Rains in growing regions are “consistent” and will help
the development of the 2012-13 crop that starts there in
October, according to the report.  Vietnam  will produce 22.4
million bags of coffee in 2012-13, the  U.S. Department of
Agriculture  estimates. A bag weighs 60 kilograms (132 pounds).  Buyers of coffee from Indonesia, the third-biggest robusta
producer, are paying a premium of $70 a ton to the exchange
price for shipment in July and August, Volcafe data showed. That
compares with $50 a ton last week.  “Local exporters are paying up to cover their nearby
commitments,” the trader said, adding that there was also
“strong demand” from the industry.  Bean arrivals at ports this week were 12,750 tons to 13,500
tons, the trader said. That compares with 11,500 tons to 12,500
tons last week, data from the trader show.  Indonesia ’s 2012-13
crop is already under way. Harvesting usually starts in April.  “The coffee flow is likely to peak in early August, ahead
of the Ramadan festivity,” the trader said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
