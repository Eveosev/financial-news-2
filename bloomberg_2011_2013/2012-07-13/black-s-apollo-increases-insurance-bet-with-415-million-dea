Athene Holding Ltd., the reinsurer
backed by  Apollo Global Management LLC (APO) , agreed to buy
 Presidential Life Corp. (PLFE)  for about $415 million.  Athene Annuity & Life Insurance Company, a subsidiary of
Bermuda-based Athene Holding, will pay $14 a share for Nyack,
New York-based Presidential Life, the companies said today in a
statement. The price is 38 percent higher than Presidential
Life’s closing share price of $10.14 yesterday.  Leon Black , who built Apollo into an $86 billion asset
manager by investing in distressed debt and bank loans, has used
Athene to tap a new source of capital, by reinsuring fixed
annuities and investing the proceeds for a profit. Athene agreed
in 2010 to buy Royal Bank of Canada’s U.S. life insurance
business for $628.1 million and last year acquired Scor SE’s
Investors Insurance Corp. subsidiary for $55 million.  “The purchase of Presidential Life will create significant
opportunities for growth in our retail sales and reinsurance
operations,” James Belardi, chief executive officer of Athene
Holding, said in the statement.  Presidential Life  rose  $3.75, or 37 percent, to $13.89 at
10:37 a.m. in Nasdaq trading. The stock had gained 1.5 percent
so far this year. Apollo rose less than one percent to $12.86 at
10:27 a.m.  Sandler O’Neill & Partners LP and Proskauer Rose LLP
advised Presidential Life on the transaction, and Sidley Austin
LLP advised Athene. The deal is expected to close late this
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
