Italy ’s 10-year bonds fell for a
second day, pushing the yield above 6 percent, after Moody’s
Investors Service cut the nation’s credit rating by two steps
and reiterated its negative outlook.  Italian two-year  notes  reversed an earlier decline after
borrowing costs fell at an auction of 3.5 billion euros ($4.3
billion) of securities maturing in 2015. Austrian, Belgian,
French and German  two-year yields  declined to records and the
rate on similar-maturity Dutch debt dropped below zero for the
first time as investors sought the safest assets.  “The downgrade overnight pushed the selloff on Italian
bonds,” said  Nick Stamenkovic , a fixed-income strategist at
broker RIA Capital Markets Ltd. in Edinburgh. “It should
intensify the pressure on overseas investors to move out of
Italian bonds.”  The yield on 10-year  Italian debt  jumped 15 basis points,
or 0.15 percentage point, to 6.06 percent at 4:35 p.m. London
time after climbing as high as 6.08 percent. The 5.5 percent
security due in September 2022 fell 1.065, or 10.65 euros per
1,000-euro face amount, to 96.45.  Moody’s lowered the country’s bond rating to Baa2 from A3
and said further cuts were possible because the economic outlook
has “deteriorated.” That’s two levels above junk and one
higher than  Spain , according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Index-Linked  Barclays Capital  removed Italian securities from its World
Government Inflation-Linked and Euro Government Inflation-Linked
indexes, citing the rating downgrade. The change will be
effective from month end, according to an e-mailed note.  The yield on Italy’s index-linked bond due in September
2021 climbed 46 basis points to 5.29 percent.  Italian notes rallied after the nation sold three-year debt
at an average yield of 4.65 percent, versus 5.3 percent at a
previous auction on June 14. Investors bid for 1.73 times the
amount allotted, up from a bid-to-cover ratio of 1.59 last
month. The nation also sold debt due in 2019, 2022 and 2023.  The two-year yield declined 19 basis points to 3.62
percent, after rising as much as 28 basis points.  Italy is  Europe ’s largest bond market with 1.64 trillion
euros of bonds outstanding, according to the website of the
nation’s debt agency.  Yield on Europe’s higher-rated  bonds  have plunged this
month as investors sought a haven from the financial turmoil and
the  European Central Bank  cut borrowing costs. Policy makers
reduced the  main refinancing rate  to a record 0.75 percent on
July 5 and cut the deposit rate to zero to stimulate lending.  German Notes  Germany ’s two-year yield fell one basis point to minus 0.05
percent after declining to minus 0.052 percent, the lowest since
Bloomberg began tracking the data in 1990. The  five-year  yield
declined as much as two basis points to 0.285 percent, also an
all-time low.  The yield on  Austrian two-year  notes dropped to a record-
low 0.019 percent, while the Dutch two-year rate fell to minus
0.008 percent. Similar-maturity Belgian yields dropped as low as
0.265 percent and French yields reached 0.1 percent.  The average rate on European  government bonds  due in three
to five years dropped to an all-time low of 1.95 percent,
according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts.  Incentive ‘Eliminated’  “Because the ECB’s rate cut eliminated an incentive for
banks to deposit funds at the central bank and Germany’s two-
year yields are near zero, money is flowing into AA rated
notes,” said Shinji Kunibe, chief portfolio manager for fixed-
income investment in  Tokyo  at Nissay Asset Management Corp.,
which manages the equivalent of $69 billion. “ France  and
 Belgium  are among the nations that benefit from the trend.”  Spanish 10-year bonds declined, with the yield rising three
basis points to 6.65 percent.  Volatility on Italian government debt was the highest in
euro-area markets today, followed by Germany and France,
according to measures of 10-year bonds, the spread between two-
and 10-year securities, and credit-default swaps.  Germany’s debt has returned 4 percent this year, according
to the EFFAS indexes. Italian securities have earned 8.4
percent, while Spanish bonds lost 4.4 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
