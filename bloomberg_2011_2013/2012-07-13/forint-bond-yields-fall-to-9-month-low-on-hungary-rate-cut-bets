Hungary ’s bond yields fell to the
lowest in nine months on bets talks on a bailout by the
 International Monetary Fund  will allow the central bank to cut
interest rates.  The rally in benchmark forint-denominated  notes  due in 2022
reduced yields 17 basis points, or 0.17 percentage point, to
7.783 percent, the lowest since October. The forint strengthened
0.2 percent to 289.4 per euro by 2:10 p.m. in Budapest, leaving
it little changed this week.  The planned start on aid talks with the IMF and European
Commission next week creates room to begin monetary easing,
central bankers Ferenc Gerhardt and Gyorgy Kocziszky said on
July 11 in a joint interview in Budapest.  “This is a very strong hint at the stance of the monetary
policy, rare in its kind in recent monetary history of
Hungary,”  Janos Samu , a Budapest-based economist at broker
Concorde Ertekpapir Zrt., wrote in a research report today on
the two rate setters’ comments.  Hungary yesterday raised 61 billion forint ($257 million)
in bonds, 17 billion forint more than planned, at an auction,
according to results from the Debt Management Agency on
Bloomberg. The sale included 30 billion forint in 2015 debt at
an average yield of 7.44 percent, the lowest for that maturity
since October.  The Magyar Nemzeti Bank on June 26 left its benchmark
 interest rate  unchanged at 7 percent for a sixth month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
