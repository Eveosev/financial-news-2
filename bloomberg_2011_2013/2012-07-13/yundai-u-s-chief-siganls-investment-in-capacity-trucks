Hyundai Motor Co. (005380) , headed for its
first annual decline in U.S. market share since 1998, plans to
address production constraints and invest in trucks and
crossovers, the automaker’s sales chief for the country said.  The Hyundai brand passed  Ford Motor Co. (F) ’s namesake brand in
car sales to retail buyers during the first six months of the
year,  John Krafcik , chief executive officer of the South Korean
company’s U.S. sales unit, told reporters yesterday at an event
in  Brooklyn ,  Michigan . The company just started production of
the new 2013 Santa Fe sport-utility vehicle.  “If you look forward a few years, and you say, ‘Gosh, if
Hyundai can figure out their capacity constraints, and if
Hyundai could invest on the truck and crossover side as they
have on the car side of the business,’” Krafcik said, then
“the brand could have a pretty good future going forward.”  Hyundai,  South Korea ’s biggest carmaker, accounted for 4.9
percent of U.S. car and light-truck sales in this year’s first
half, down from 5.1 percent a year earlier, according to
researcher Autodata Corp. Tight production capacity and Chairman
 Chung Mong Koo ’s push to improve quality may slow Hyundai’s U.S.
sales gains this year, Krafcik said in February.  “It’s possible” that Hyundai will make up its share loss
in the year’s second half, Krafcik said. The company is on track
to sell more than 700,00 vehicles this year. “Depending on how
far north of 700, we’d be able to hold total share.”  The Seoul-based company’s U.S. market share fell as its
first-half sales increase of 10 percent trailed the industry’s
15 percent gain. Hyundai posted record sales of 356,669 vehicles
for the six months and is boosting output later this year at its
 Alabama  assembly plant.  Alabama Shift  The Montgomery, Alabama, factory will add a third shift in
September, increasing capacity there by 20,000 units this year
and by about 60,000 on an annual basis, Krafcik said yesterday.
The plant currently can build at least 300,000 Sonata sedans and
Elantra small cars a year.  Hyundai increased passenger-car sales to retail buyers in
the first six months by 17 percent from a year earlier to
267,743, Krafcik said. The brand ranked No. 4 in the industry,
passing Ford, whose namesake brand’s retail car deliveries rose
by 8.1 percent to 250,718.  The Hyundai brand’s car retail sales trailed  Toyota Motor
Corp. (7203)  and  Honda Motor Co. (7267) ’s namesake brands at 446,459 and
350,827, respectively, as well as  General Motor Co. (GM) ’s Chevrolet
brand at 290,107. Sales to retail buyers tend to be more
profitable than deliveries to government or corporate fleets,
including rental-car companies.  Sales Gains  Hyundai’s total first-half U.S. sales growth trailed gains
at Chrysler Group LLC and  Volkswagen AG (VOW) , which each increased
deliveries by 30 percent. In addition, Toyota’s sales rose 29
percent and Honda and Nissan Motor Co. reported larger gains
than Hyundai.  Hyundai will likely have its first retail sales of the new
Santa Fe in August, Krafcik said. The company is selling the
model in five- and seven-passenger versions.  “While they have made huge strides on the car side, they
still need to become more competitive in the crossover
segments,” Joe Langley, an analyst at LMC Automotive in Troy,
Michigan, said in an e-mail. “The tide should begin to turn for
them with the launch of the redesigned  Santa Fe .”  South Korean union workers at Hyundai and affiliate  Kia
Motors Corp. (000270)  this week voted to authorize what would be
Hyundai’s first strike since 2008. South Korean plants accounted
for 46 percent of Hyundai’s production capacity in 2011, a
decrease from 60 percent in 2008 and 93 percent in 2000.  Talks Resume  Hyundai Motor’s union, which ended discussions with
management June 28, has agreed to resume negotiations with the
company on July 18, according to Kim Gi Hyuk, a union spokesman,
and an e-mailed response from the company yesterday.  More than 60 percent of Hyundai’s product sold in the U.S.
is sourced there, which provides the company some buffer if
production is lost in South Korea, Krafcik said.  “We certainly hope it gets resolved well,” he said.  The workers’ authorization vote was a blow to Hyundai and
Kia, whose improvement in labor relations helped them increase
sales faster than any other major global auto group the past
four years. Hyundai estimates strikes from 1987 to 2008 led to
lost sales of more than 1 million vehicles valued at 11.6
trillion won ($10 billion).  To contact the reporter on this story:
