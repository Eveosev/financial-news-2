TriWest Healthcare Alliance Corp., a
closely held company created to provide medical services to the
military, said today it won’t challenge the loss of a $20.5
billion contract to  UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH)   The Government Accountability Office, which arbitrates
contract disputes, last week rejected the company’s protest of
the Defense Department’s decision to give the work to the
nation’s largest health insurer.  TriWest, based in Phoenix, had the option of filing a
lawsuit in U.S. Court of Federal Claims. It has 1,700 employees.  “It is with mixed emotions that we make this decision,”
the company said in a statement. “However, continuing to
challenge the government’s decision will not bring an end to the
uncertainty that has plagued this program for the last three
years and will only drive up the costs for all involved.”  David McIntyre Jr., TriWest’s chief executive officer, has
said “it is likely” the Phoenix-based company would shut down
without the contract.  TriWest’s decision may have a ripple effect. One of its
subcontractors, Madison, Wisconsin-based WPS Health Insurance,
notified some workers in its Wausau, Wisconsin, office this week
that TriWest’s contract loss may result in some job losses. WPS
handles claims processing on the military contract.  “If we don’t have the contract, we won’t have the work to
sustain that workforce,” Brian Brugger, a senior vice president
for the company, said in a telephone interview today.  TriWest Contracts  WPS has 3,500 employees. Brugger wouldn’t say how many jobs
were at stake.  TriWest owes its existence to Tricare, the Pentagon’s
health program. Founded in 1996 by McIntyre, a former aide to
Republican Senator  John McCain , it has helped manage military
medical services for 16 years. TriWest is owned by a holding
company made up of a group of nonprofit Blue Cross Blue Shield
plans and university hospital systems.  The military work has generated more than $20 billion in
contracts for TriWest since fiscal 2000, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  The Defense Department in March awarded the new five-year
contract to Minnetonka, Minnesota-based UnitedHealth. The
company will take over coordinating medical services for active
duty military, retirees and their families in 21 states, mostly
in the West, in April 2013.  UnitedHealth Settlement  TriWest accused the Pentagon of failing to consider the
costs of moving to a new provider. It also has pointed to
UnitedHealth’s legal woes, including a $350 million settlement
that the insurer paid after the  American Medical Association 
claimed it had manipulated payments to doctors. The agreement
was announced in January 2009.  TriWest lobbied members of Congress to send letters to
Defense Secretary  Leon Panetta  asking for an explanation of the
contract decision. It also has blanketed the Washington area
with ads attacking UnitedHealth.  The GAO’s July 2 decision found that the Pentagon’s
evaluation of the competing bids “was reasonable,” Ralph O. White, the GAO’s managing associate general counsel for
procurement law, said in an e-mailed statement that day.  The decision, which hasn’t been released to the public,
denied TriWest’s protest “on all counts,” White said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
