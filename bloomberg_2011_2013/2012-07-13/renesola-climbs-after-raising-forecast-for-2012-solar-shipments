ReneSola Ltd. (SOL) , a Chinese maker of
solar products, gained the most in more than a week after
raising its forecast for 2012 shipments.  ReneSolaâ€™s American depositary receipts increased 4.4
percent to $1.42 at the close in  New York , the biggest gain
since July 3. The Jiashan, China-based company has decreased 68
percent over the past year. Each ADR is worth two ordinary
shares.  Shipments of solar panels and wafers will be in the range
of 2,200 megawatts to 2,400 megawatts, up from a March forecast
of 1,800 megawatts to 2,000 megawatts, the company said today in
a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
