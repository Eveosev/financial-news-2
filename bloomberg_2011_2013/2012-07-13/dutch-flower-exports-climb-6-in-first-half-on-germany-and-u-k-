The Netherlands’  flower  and plant
exports, the world’s biggest, rose 6 percent in the first half
as increased shipments to  Germany  and the U.K. more than made up
for falling sales to France,  Italy  and Spain.  Exports climbed to 3.1 billion euros ($3.79 billion) from
2.92 billion euros in the first half of 2011, the Aalsmeer,
Netherlands-based Dutch Agricultural Wholesale Board for Flowers
and Plants wrote in a  report  on its website today.  Flower sales to southern  Europe  are sliding on the back of
falling  consumer confidence  there, with shoppers cutting the
budget for blooms at weddings, funerals and birthdays, the board
said. Consumers in Germany, the U.K. and the Nordic countries
all bought more greenery and flowers.  “Flowers and plants are products with a large emotional
value and that could also be an advantage in this time of
economic headwind,” the board wrote. In southern Europe,
“there is no sign of improving confidence for the time being,”
it said.  Germany, Europe’s largest economy, is the biggest market
for flowers from the Netherlands. Flower and plant exports to
the country rose 7.1 percent in the first half to 995 million
euros. Shipments to the U.K., the second-biggest customer for
Dutch flora, increased 12 percent to 437 million euros.  Flower and plant sales to  France  slipped 2.1 percent to 361
million euros in the first six months, while exports to Italy
declined 6.3 percent to 148 million euros, according to the
wholesale board’s data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
