Daily rates for the largest
commodity carriers fell for a fourth session amid a surplus of
available ships to haul cargoes.  Returns for Capesizes, the largest ships hauling the steel-
making ingredient, lost 6.2 percent to $6,070 a day, according
to the  Baltic Exchange , the London-based publisher of freight
rates. That’s the lowest rate since July 3, exchange data show.  Capesize vessels slumped 78 percent so far this year,
according to exchange data. The Capesize fleet expanded to a
record 1,467 of the ships in service, according to data from  IHS
Inc. (IHS) , a research group based in Englewood,  Colorado . The global
dry-bulk fleet stands at almost 571 million deadweight tons, a
record high and compares with 504.8 million tons 12 months
earlier, the data showed.  “The oversupply in this sector remains very high,” Oslo-
based Fearnley Securities said in an e-mailed report today.  Rates for Panamaxes, which carry about half as much as
Capesizes, added 1.2 percent to $9,584 a day, the exchange said.
Earnings for Supramaxes declined 0.5 percent to $13,454 and
Handysizes decreased 0.6 percent to $10,005 a day.  The  Baltic Dry Index (BDIY) , a broader measure of raw-materials
shipping costs, fell for an fourth day, sliding 1 percent to
1,110 points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
