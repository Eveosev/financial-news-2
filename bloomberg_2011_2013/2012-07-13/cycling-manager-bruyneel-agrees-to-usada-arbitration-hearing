Johan Bruyneel , the RadioShack
Nissan Trek cycling team manager accused of participating in a
doping conspiracy with  Lance Armstrong , has decided to have his
case heard by an independent panel of arbitrators.  During the hearing, which Bruyneel chose rather than accept
a lifetime ban from the sport, all evidence will be presented
and witness testimony will be under oath and subject to cross
examination, the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency said in a statement.  Bruyneel, two doctors and a trainer who were a part of the
U.S. Postal Service’s pro cycling team are accused by  Colorado
Springs , Colorado-based USADA of planning the use of banned
drugs and doping methods by their team, while Armstrong is
accused by the agency of using banned drugs and plotting the use
of such substances by his teammates.  The two doctors, Luis Garcia del Moral and Michele Ferrari,
and trainer Jose “Pepe” Marti were given lifetime bans from
the sport on July 10. Armstrong, the seven-time Tour de France
winner who could be stripped of his titles, filed a lawsuit
seeking to block USADA’s actions.  Armstrong two days ago was granted a 30-day extension by
USADA to decide whether he will continue to contest the
accusations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
