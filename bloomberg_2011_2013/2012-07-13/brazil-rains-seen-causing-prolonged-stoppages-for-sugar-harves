Areas in  Brazil  where sugar cane is
grown will get high amounts of rains next week, disrupting the
harvest, according to Somar Meteorologia.  After sunny days projected for today through July 15, a
cold front will bring rain starting at the beginning of next
week to areas near Santos and Paranagua, the Sao Paulo-based
weather forecaster said.  “It is expected that a cold-front system, similar to the
one recorded in June,” will bring “high cumulative rainfall
and prolonged stoppage in harvesting activities,” Somar said in
an e-mailed report today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
