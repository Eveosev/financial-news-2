India’s rupee strengthened the most
in almost two weeks on speculation the central bank will join
policy makers worldwide in taking steps to spur growth.  The  Reserve Bank  of India may lower  interest rates  by 50
basis points at a review on July 31, according to Citigroup Inc.
The RBI kept borrowing costs unchanged last month after reducing
them in April for the first time since 2009. A government report
yesterday showed  industrial output  rose 2.4 percent in May, less
than an average 5.1 percent in the previous two years.  China’s
economy  expanded 7.6 percent last quarter, the least in three
years, official data showed today.  “We believe the rupee has overshot and that positive
changes are starting to occur,” said Gaurav Garg, a strategist
at Citigroup in Singapore. In the short term, the rupee is “our
most-favored currency in  Asia ,” he said.  The rupee advanced 1.4 percent to 55.1450 per dollar in
Mumbai, the biggest gain since July 3, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. That led to a gain of 0.6 percent this
week, erasing earlier losses. The currency will rise to 54 in
the coming weeks, Garg predicted. One-month implied volatility,
a measure of exchange-rate swings used to price options, fell 15
basis points, or 0.15 percentage point, to 11.85 percent.  The  Asian Development Bank  cut its growth forecast for the
region yesterday and South Korea unexpectedly reduced interest
rates as it joined countries from Brazil to China in easing
monetary policy in July. Asia excluding Japan will expand 6.6
percent this year, compared with an April estimate of 6.9
percent, ADB President  Haruhiko Kuroda  said in Bangkok
yesterday.  Three-month onshore rupee forwards traded at 56.12 per
dollar, compared with 56.82 yesterday, and offshore non-
deliverable contracts were at 56.06 from 56.82. Forwards are
agreements to buy or sell assets at a set price and date. Non-
deliverable contracts are settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
