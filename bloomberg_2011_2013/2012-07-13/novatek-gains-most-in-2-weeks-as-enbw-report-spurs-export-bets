OAO Novatek jumped the most in two
weeks on speculation the Russian natural-gas producer may breach
OAO Gazprom’s monopoly on exports.  The shares led gains on the Micex Index, adding 6 percent
to 346.22 rubles by the close in Moscow, the most since June 29.
The stock rose 5.3 percent to $112 in  London .  EnBW Energie Baden-Wuerttemberg AG (EBK) ,  Germany ’s third-largest
power supplier, signed a 600 million-euro ($732 million) gas
contract with Novatek, Financial Times Deutschland  reported .
EnBW said on July 12 it signed a 10-year gas contract with an
unidentified foreign gas producer with a value of 600 million
euros a year. The contract will start in October, EnBW said.  “We view it as positive that Novatek has started this
process, which has a good chance of turning into exports of its
own gas,” Troika Dialog analysts led by Oleg Maximov said in an
e-mailed report today.  The yield on Novatek’s $600 million of Eurobonds due
February 2016 dropped 19 basis points, or 0.19 percentage point,
to 3.614 percent, the lowest closing level on record, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
