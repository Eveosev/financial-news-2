American businessman Zack Shahin,
the former chief executive officer of Dubai’s  Deyaar Development (DEYAAR) 
PJSC, was released on bail after more than four years in jail,
according to his lawyers.  Shahin, jailed since March 2008 on charges of corruption
and embezzlement at the property company, has been on a hunger
strike protesting his detention while defending against five
separate cases. He’s spent four years, three months and 19 days
in Dubai awaiting trial, his lawyers said today in an e-mailed
statement.  “Following a seven-week hunger strike and thanks in part
to the U.S. government publicly urging the U.A.E. government to
grant bail, Shahin was released on bond after meeting bail
conditions including posting a $1.4 million guarantee and
surrendering his passport as surety,” his attorneys said.  Shahin said in the statement that “all I have asked for is
the same treatment under the law as other Emirati defendants
standing accused of similar charges. Now that Dubai authorities
have taken the first step for equal due process for all
defendants by granting my bail, I look forward to the
opportunity to prove my innocence during a fair, transparent and
open trial.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
