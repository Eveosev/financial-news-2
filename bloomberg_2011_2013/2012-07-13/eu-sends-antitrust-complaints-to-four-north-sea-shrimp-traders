The European Commission said it sent
antitrust complaints to four traders of North Sea shrimp over a
suspected cartel to fix prices and allocate markets in the
Netherlands,  Germany , France and Belgium.  It didn’t identify the companies in an e-mailed statement.
 Heiploeg BV , the Netherlands’ largest North Sea shrimp producer,
said in 2009 that it was raided by European Union inspectors.  To contact the reporter on this story:
