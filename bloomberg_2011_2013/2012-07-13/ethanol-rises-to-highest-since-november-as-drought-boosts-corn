Ethanol increased to the highest
price in more than seven months as drought in the U.S. worsens
yield losses on corn, boosting costs for distillers.  Areas in the U.S. Midwest suffering from moderate to
extreme drought expanded to about 63 percent as of July 10 from
53 percent a week earlier, the National Drought Mitigation
Center said yesterday. Corn is the primary feedstock for making
ethanol.  Denatured ethanol for August delivery rose 3.9 cents, or
1.6 percent, to $2.556 a gallon on the  Chicago  Board of Trade,
the highest settlement since Nov. 22. Futures have gained 6.3
percent this week, and are up 29 percent since dropping to the
lowest level this year on June 1.  In cash market trading, ethanol in New York rose 3.5 cents
to $2.65 a gallon and in Chicago the additive added 3.5 cents to
$2.52, according to data compiled by Bloomberg as of 2:04 p.m.
New York time.  Ethanol in the U.S. Gulf increased 4 cents to $2.58 a
gallon and on the West Coast the biofuel climbed 3 cents to
$2.745.  Corn for December delivery rose 8 cents, or 1.1 percent, to
$7.4025 a bushel in Chicago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
