Veolia Environnement SA (VIE) , the world’s
biggest water company, jumped in Paris trading after the
infrastructure fund Highstar Capital was reported to be in
advanced talks to buy the company’s U.S. waste management unit.  Veolia climbed 3.2 percent, the most since June 27, to
close at 9.03 euros after the Reuters report. The stock has
fallen 50 percent the past 12 months, valuing the utility at
4.71 billion euros ($5.76 billion).  Chief Executive Officer Antoine Frerot is aiming to cut
debt by 3 billion euros by the end of next year to make the
company more profitable. Frerot said in May he wants to focus on
“promising” countries and will pursue asset sales in the U.S.
and U.K. Veolia sold its British unit to Morgan Stanley-backed
Infracapital Partners for 1.2 billion pounds in June.  The utility’s U.S. waste management unit may be worth as
much as $2 billion, unidentified people familiar with the matter
told Reuters. Highstar, a private equity firm based in  New York ,
has financing for the deal and has made a final offer, the
newswire reported.  “This is much better than what the market would have
expected,” Bryan Garnier and Co. analyst Julien Desmaretz said
in a note to investors today. “If this deal closes at this
price, Veolia would have already sold 3.2 billion euros out of
its asset disposal target of 5 billion in 2012-13.”  Sandrine Guendoul, a spokeswoman for Veolia in Paris,
declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
