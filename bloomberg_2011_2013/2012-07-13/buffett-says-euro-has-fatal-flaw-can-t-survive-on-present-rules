Billionaire  Warren Buffett  said the
euro is destined for failure and must be reworked if the 17
countries that share the currency are to keep their monetary
union.  “The system that they put in place had a fundamental fatal
flaw,” Buffett said today on Bloomberg Television’s “In the
Loop With  Betty Liu ” in an interview from the Allen & Co. media
conference in Sun Valley, Idaho. “It can’t survive with the
present rules. That’s what they’re learning. The question is,
can 17 countries get together in a way to essentially re-do
something.”  European leaders are deepening their ties in response to
the sovereign debt crisis by collaborating on bailouts and
insisting on budget-deficit curbs. The euro was started by 11
countries, led by  Germany , in January 1999. Buffett said repairs
to the system will be difficult considering the number of
countries that must find agreement.  “It’s kind of hard to patch something with so many people
consulting on the patch,” Buffett said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
