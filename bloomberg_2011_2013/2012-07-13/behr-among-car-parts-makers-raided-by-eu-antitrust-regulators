Behr GmbH was among makers of
heating and cooling systems for cars raided by European Union
antitrust regulators in May over a possible cartel.  The European Commission said the inspection was part of a
wider ongoing investigation into alleged cartels in the auto-
parts industry. It has previously raided producers of wire
harnesses, car safety systems and bearings.  Behr said it faced probes by the EU and the U.S. Justice
Department and would fully cooperate with both authorities.  “The investigation proceedings concern possible events
that took place well in advance” of Mahle GmbH’s acquisition of
a stake in Behr, the Stuttgart-based car-parts producer said in
a statement on its website today.  Mahle, which has a 36.8 percent stake in Behr, won’t be
affected by the EU probe, Behr said. Mahle first bought an
interest in Behr in 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
