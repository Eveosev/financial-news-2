Axius Inc. (AXIU)  Chief Executive Officer
Roland Kaufmann pleaded not guilty in federal court in Brooklyn,
New York, to charges that he participated in a scheme to
manipulate the share price of his Dubai-based company.  Jean-Pierre Neuhaus, a financial professional also charged
in the alleged scheme, pleaded not guilty along with Kaufmann at
a hearing today before U.S. District Judge John Gleeson. The two
men, who are Swiss citizens, were named in an indictment filed
last week. They are charged with conspiracy to commit securities
fraud,  wire fraud ,  money laundering  and other crimes.  The men are accused of trying to artificially inflate the
value of Axius stock by enlisting a person they believed would
direct corrupt stock brokers to buy shares in exchange for
kickbacks of as much as 28 percent. That individual was an
undercover enforcement agent, the government said.  “I’m very confident in this judge and we’ll see how this
is going to play out,” said Johanna S. Zapp, a lawyer for
Neuhaus, after the hearing. A lawyer for Kaufmann, Eric J.
Snyder, declined to comment.  Neuhaus is being held in federal custody. Kaufmann is free
on a $2.5 million bond.  The case is U.S. v. Neuhaus, 12-cr-00439, U.S. District
Court, Eastern District of  New York  (Brooklyn).  To contact the reporter on this story:
