Tropical Storm Fabio is expected to
strengthen further and may become a hurricane by tomorrow, as it
churns in the Pacific Ocean 485 miles (775 kilometers) southwest
of Manzanillo,  Mexico , the U.S. National Hurricane Center said.  Fabio has sustained maximum winds of 65 miles per hour,
with higher gusts, the center said in a bulletin at 2 a.m.
Pacific time. A storm becomes a hurricane when winds reach 74
mph.  Another tropical storm, Emilia, is further out to sea in
the Pacific, also posing no immediate danger to land.  To contact the reporter on this story:
