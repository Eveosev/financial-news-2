Russia plans to sell a unit of OAO
MRSK Holding to help fund a revamp of the power industry as it
merges the largest distributor with national network operator
Federal Grid Co., Energy Minister Alexander Novak said.  The sale of the unit, which hasn’t been determined yet,
will be “a pilot project” for privatization and may happen as
early as the first quarter of 2013, Novak told reporters in
Yalta,  Ukraine , late yesterday.  “A consultant will be hired to evaluate a MRSK unit that
will be privatized,” Novak said. “We propose keeping the money
within this MRSK subsidiary to help fund modernization.”  A government commission headed by Deputy Prime Minister
 Arkady Dvorkovich  is due to present proposals for completing the
merger of MRSK and Federal Grid by October, Novak said.
