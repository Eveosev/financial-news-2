Morgan Stanley (MS)  and  Bank of America
Corp. (BAC)  reduced relative yields on part of a $1.2 billion
commercial-mortgage bond offering, a boon for banks stockpiling
loans for future sales.  The lenders are issuing top-ranked debt maturing in about
10 years to pay a spread of 135 basis points more than the
benchmark swap rate, according to a person familiar with the
offering who asked not to be identified because terms aren’t
set. The banks initially marketed the securities to yield as
much as 150 basis points more than the benchmark. UBS AG and
Barclays Plc sold such debt paying a spread of 160 basis points
on June 28, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The transaction may signal a turnaround in investor
appetite as Wall Street dealers had been struggling to find
enough buyers for securities linked to shopping malls, hotels
and skyscrapers with longer durations. Lower spreads allow
lenders to offer borrowers better terms, potentially boosting
issuance.  Wells Fargo & Co . raised its 2012 forecast to $35
billion from $25 billion yesterday.  “We anticipate issuance to be robust” in the third
quarter, Wells Fargo analysts led by Marielle Jan de Beur in  New
York  said in a report yesterday. “Pipelines appear to be
active.”  Relative yields on commercial-mortgage bonds have been
whipsawed by the  European debt crisis . The spread on newly
issued 10-year bonds carrying top grades was as narrow as 105
basis points more than swaps in March. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point.  The deal from Morgan Stanley and Bank of America is linked
to 72 loans on 98 properties across the U.S., said the person.
The largest loan in the pool is a $180 million mortgage on an
 office tower  in Baltimore.  Dealers have arranged about $15.8 billion of the debt this
year, compared with $28 billion in all of 2011, Bloomberg data
show. Forecasts for 2012 issuance range from Wells Fargo’s $35
billion to Credit Suisse Group AG’s projection of as much as $45
billion. Sales are down from a record $232 billion in 2007.
