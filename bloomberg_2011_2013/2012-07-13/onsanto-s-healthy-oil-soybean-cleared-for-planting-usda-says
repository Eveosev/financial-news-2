Monsanto Co. (MON) , the world’s biggest
seed company, received clearance from the  U.S. Department of
Agriculture  to begin selling a genetically modified soybean that
the company says produces healthier cooking oil.  The seed was deregulated because it’s unlikely to pose a
plant-pest risk, the USDA said today on its  website . The oilseed
contains 20 percent to 30 percent stearidonic acid, an alternate
source of omega-3 fatty acids found in fish and leafy
vegetables, according to the agency’s  assessment .  To contact the reporter on this story:
