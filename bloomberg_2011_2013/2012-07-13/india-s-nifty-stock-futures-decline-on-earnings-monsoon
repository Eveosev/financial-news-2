Indian stocks fell for a third day
ahead of data that may show inflation accelerated in June.  Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. (TCS) , the country’s largest
software exporter, climbed 1.1 percent after reporting profit of
32.8 billion rupees, exceeding the median estimate of 31.8
billion rupees in a Bloomberg survey of 40 analysts. Rival
 Infosys Ltd. (INFO)  dropped for a second day after earnings fell short
of estimates and the company cut its sales outlook.  The BSE India  Sensitive Index (SENSEX) , or Sensex, slid 0.2 percent
to 17,196.36, according to preliminary closing prices at 3:30
p.m. in Mumbai, after changing direction at least nine times.
The gauge slumped 1.5 percent yesterday, the most since June 1,
as Infosys plunged 8.4 percent following its results.  “Results so far have been mixed and with key inflation
data due to be released next week, investors aren’t committing a
lot,” Sunil Pachisia, vice-president at brokerage Pratibhuti
Viniyog Ltd. in Mumbai, said by phone.  Wholesale prices  in  India  probably rose 7.61 percent in
June after gaining 7.55 percent in May, according to a median of
36 economists’ estimates in a Bloomberg survey. The government
will release the data on July 16. Monsoon, the main source of
irrigation for its 235 million farmers, was 23 percent below a
50-year average since June 1, the weather bureau said yesterday.  One out of four, or 25 percent, Sensex companies that have
reported results for the June quarter have missed analysts’
estimates, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Profit at 30
percent of the companies in the measure trailed forecasts in the
March quarter, compared with 47 percent in the period ended
December, data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
