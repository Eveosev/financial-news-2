The Australian dollar may fall to
the weakest level in six weeks, according to Bank of America
Corp., citing trading patterns.  The so-called Aussie is “confirming a top and turn in
trend for the 0.9850 area, potentially the 0.9663/0.9613 zone”
against the  U.S. dollar ,  MacNeil Curry , the bank’s New York-
based head of foreign-exchange and interest-rates technical
strategy, wrote in a report yesterday.  Australia’s dollar may extend losses after it slid below
trendline support of $1.0192, according to Curry. Support is an
area on a price graph where orders to buy may be clustered. He
recommended in the note investors sell the Aussie at $1.0113.  The Australian dollar fell 0.1 percent $1.0129 at 10:49
a.m. in Sydney from the close in  New York  yesterday, when it
touched $1.0101, the weakest level since June 29. It has gained
2 percent over the past month. The last time the Aussie was at
96.13 U.S. cents was on June 1.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
