Galp Energia SGPS SA (GALP)  rose to a one-
week high in Lisbon trading after  Portugal ’s biggest oil company
increased output in the second quarter and processed more crude
at its refineries.  Galp shares climbed 2.5 percent to close at 10.89 euros,
the highest since July 4, giving the company a market value of 9
billion euros ($11 billion).  “The rise has to do with the fact that the company
announced an increase in oil production in the second quarter,”
said  Pedro Oliveira , a trader at Go Bulling in Lisbon.  Galp’s oil output increased in the second quarter and the
company processed 2.7 percent more crude at its refineries, the
Lisbon-based company said today in a  regulatory filing .  Average working-interest production rose 18 percent from a
year earlier to 25,800 barrels a day and average net entitlement
output climbed 37 percent to 18,800 barrels a day, Galp said.
Galp in April said it was targeting working-interest production
of about 25,000 barrels a day in the second quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
