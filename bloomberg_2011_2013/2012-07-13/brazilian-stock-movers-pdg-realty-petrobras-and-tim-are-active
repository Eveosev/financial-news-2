The following companies had  unusual 
price changes in  Sao Paulo  trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses, and prices are as of the market close. Preferred
shares are usually the most-traded class of stock.  The  Bovespa (IBOV)  Index rose 1.7 percent to 54,330.51.  PDG Realty SA (PDGR3 BZ), Brazil’s biggest homebuilder,
rose 4.4 percent to 3.35 reais, the highest in a week. The real
estate company said in a regulatory filing yesterday that its
shareholders approved a proposal by Vinci Partners Investimentos
Ltda. to inject 800 million reais ($393 million) into the
company.  Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4)  (PETR4 BZ), the state-controlled oil
company, rallied 5.2 percent to 19.55 reais, the most since May
21. It said in a regulatory filing yesterday that it will
increase refinery diesel prices by 6 percent.  Tim Participacoes SA (TIMP3)  (TIMP3 BZ), Brazil’s second-biggest
cell-phone operator, rose 2 percent to 10 reais, rebounding from
yesterday’s 7.5 percent drop. The stock plunged yesterday after
newspaper O Estado S. Paulo reported that the company may suffer
sanctions if service doesn’t improve. The reaction was
“exaggerated,” Jacqueline Lison and Rodrigo Faria, analysts at
Banco Fator, wrote in a note to clients dated today. Tim may
face fines and the suspension of sales across Brazil next week
because of network failures, a government official familiar with
the plan told Bloomberg today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
