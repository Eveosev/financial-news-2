X5 Retail Group NV (FIVE) , Russia’s largest
food retailer by revenue, headed for a five-month low after
Chief Executive Officer Andrei Gusev quit, effective
immediately.  X5’s global depositary receipts lost 4.4 percent to $21.32
by 9:11 a.m. in  London . A close at that level would be the
weakest since Jan. 30.  Stephan DuCharme, a member of X5’s board, will take over on
a temporary basis as the company starts a search for a new CEO,
X5 said in a statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
