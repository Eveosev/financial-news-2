Most  Chinese stocks  fell after a
government report today showed the nation’s economy grew at the
slowest pace in three years in the second quarter.  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  changed directions at least 10
times before closing up less than 0.1 percent to 2,185.90, as
five stocks dropped for every two that rose. The measure slid
1.7 percent this week, a fourth week of losses, as a statistics
bureau report showed gross domestic product expanded 7.6
percent, compared with analysts’ estimate for 7.7 percent.
Industrial production also increased at a slower pace in June
while retail sales growth decelerated.  “The GDP figure might not be good, but most of the
economic weakness has been priced into stocks,” said  Zhang Ling , general manager at Shanghai River Fund Management Co.
“The stock market’s performance may be better in the second
half as it’ll reflect a slew of government easing policies such
as interest-rate cuts.”  China  Shenhua Energy Co., the biggest coal producer, slid
0.8 percent after Sanford C. Bernstein cut its 2012 and 2013
price forecast for thermal coal.  China Merchants Bank Co. (600036)  and
China Minsheng Banking Corp. paced gains by financial companies
after new lending exceeded estimates last month.  The  CSI 300 Index (SHSZ300)  gained 0.1 percent to 2,450.63 today.
The Shanghai Composite has fallen 0.6 percent this year on
concern  Europe ’s debt crisis and China’s property curbs are
hurting economic growth. The index is  valued  at 9.7 times
estimated profit, compared with a record low of 8.9 times
recorded in January, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The
 Bloomberg China-US 55 Index (CH55BN) , the measure of the most-traded
U.S.-listed Chinese companies, slid 1.6 percent yesterday.  Growth Concerns  China’s growth slowed for a sixth quarter as trade and
manufacturing decelerated, putting pressure on Premier  Wen Jiabao  to boost stimulus to secure a second-half economic
rebound. Import and export growth slowed in June and consumer
prices rose the least in more than two years, according to data
released by the statistics bureau this week.  Jiangxi Copper Co., China’s biggest producer of the metal,
lost 1.4 percent to 23.26 yuan. Yunnan Copper Industry Co., the
fourth largest, fell 1.7 percent to 18.81 yuan.  Copper traders are the most bearish in six weeks on concern
demand will slow in China, Europe and the U.S. at a time when
 hedge funds  are betting on lower prices. Thirteen analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg said they expect prices to drop next week
and nine were bullish. A further six were neutral, making the
proportion of bears the highest since June 1.  ‘Stay Low’  “The question is not how deep the economy falls, but how
long it will stay low,” said Dong Tao, Credit Suisse Group AG’s
Hong Kong-based chief China economist. “China needs structural
reforms, not just monetary or fiscal expansion.”  Shenhua Energy fell 0.8 percent to 22.63  yuan . China Coal
Energy Co., the second biggest, dropped 0.8 percent to 7.77
yuan.  Datong Coal Industry Co. (601001) , the third largest, lost 1
percent to 10.69 yuan.  Bernstein lowered its China coal price forecast for this
year by 4.8 percent to 700 yuan ($109.8) a metric ton and the
projection for 2013 by 2.3 percent to 650 yuan. It’s the third
time that Bernstein has cut its forecast for the China prices in
two months.  Merchants Bank  gained 0.8 percent to 10.17 yuan. Minsheng
Banking, the nation’s first privately owned bank, added 1.4
percent to 5.97 yuan.  Chinese banks extended 919.8 billion yuan of new loans in
June, the People’s Bank of China said yesterday after the market
closed. That compares with the 880 billion yuan median forecast
in a Bloomberg News survey and 793.2 billion yuan in May. M2, a
measure of  money supply , rose 13.6 percent from 13.2 percent a
month earlier, it said.  Cement Stocks  The monetary data “shows the initial effects of the
monetary easing undertaken in recent months,”  Michael Shaoul ,
chairman of Marketfield Asset Management in New York, wrote in a
note yesterday. “We very much doubt that liquidity conditions
have improved further down the food chain.”  Anhui Conch Cement Co. led a rally among building-material
makers after China’s home sales rose the most this year last
month, boosting speculation construction activities will
accelerate. The stock gained 1.2 percent to 14.87 yuan.  Huaxin Cement Co. (600801) , the Chinese affiliate of Holcim Ltd.,
rose 1.5 percent to 11.84 yuan. Gansu Qilianshan Cement Group
Co. climbed 2.1 percent to 10.72 yuan.  The value of homes sold climbed to 531.3 billion yuan from
375.7 billion yuan in May, based on the difference between the
National Statistics Bureau’s data for the first half of the year
and the first five months.  The central bank may cut  interest rates  one or two more
times this year and reduce the reserve-requirement ratio two or
three more times in 2012, the  China Daily  reported today, citing
Zhu Baoliang, chief economist at the State Information Center.
The government cut rates on July 5 for a second time in a month
and has lowered the reserve ratio three times since November to
bolster growth.  --Zhang Shidong. With assistance from Belinda Cao in New York.
