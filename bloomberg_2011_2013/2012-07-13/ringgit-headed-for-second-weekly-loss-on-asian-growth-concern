Malaysia ’s ringgit was headed for a
second weekly loss as data showed Asian economies are slowing,
damping the nation’s export outlook.  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  of shares was poised for its
biggest weekly loss since the five days ended May 18 as official
data showed China’s economy expanded 7.6 percent in the second
quarter from a year earlier, the slowest pace in three years.
Singapore’s gross domestic product decreased 1.1 percent in the
three months through June, a report showed today, while the Bank
of Korea said that nation’s economy will expand 3 percent this
year, from a previous estimate of 3.5 percent. China and
Singapore are Malaysia’s top two export markets.  “Growth is now the key concern,” said  Philip Wee , a
Singapore-based senior currency economist at DBS Group Holdings
Ltd. “ Korea is basically looking for below-trend growth
because of the uncertain external environment particularly
pertaining to the U.S., Europe and China.”  The ringgit dropped 0.2 percent this week to 3.1854 per
dollar as of 4:55 p.m. in Kuala Lumpur, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. It gained 0.2 percent today. The
currency’s one-month implied volatility, a measure of exchange-
rate swings used to price options, rose 15 basis points to 6.55
percent. It increased five basis points, or 0.05 percentage
point, this week.  Ten-year government bonds were little changed today. The
yield on the 3.418 percent notes due August 2022 was 3.44
percent, according to Bursa Malaysia. It declined three basis
points for the week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
