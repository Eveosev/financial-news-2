European stocks rose for a sixth
week as China’s slowest expansion in three years fueled
speculation policy makers will add to stimulus measures and
 Italy ’s borrowing costs fell at an auction.  Storebrand ASA (STB) ,  Norway’s second-largest publicly traded
insurer , rallied 8.2 percent after saying it will meet  capital
requirements  without selling shares.  Temenos Group AG (TEMN)  rebounded
5.9 percent.  PSA Peugeot Citroen (UG)  slumped to the lowest price
since at least 1989 over concerns that the French government may
step in after  Europe ’s second-largest carmaker announced plans
to close a factory and cut jobs.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index added 1.3 percent to 256.26 at
the close of trading. The measure rose 0.7 percent this week,
its sixth straight week of gains and the longest streak of
advances since April 2010 as Greek leaders formed a government,
global central banks added stimulus and euro-area leaders
announced on June 29 they will work on addressing flaws in their
bailout programs.  “A China slowdown is already priced into the markets and
didn’t come as a surprise, and investors see additional stimulus
coming in the near future,” said Trung-Tin Nguyen, a hedge-fund
manager at TTN AG in Zurich. “Market participants also seem to
be interpreting the bond auctions in Europe positively, even
Spanish and Italian ones.”  National benchmark indexes gained in all of the 18 western-
 European (SXXP)  markets except Iceland.  France ’s CAC 40 advanced 1.5
percent and the U.K.’s FTSE 100 climbed 1 percent. Germany’s DAX
rose 2.2 percent.  Chinese Economy  China’s growth slowed for a sixth quarter to the weakest
pace since the global financial crisis, putting pressure on
Premier  Wen Jiabao  to boost stimulus to secure a second-half
economic rebound.  Gross domestic product  expanded 7.6 percent last quarter
from a year earlier, the National Bureau of Statistics said
today. The pace, a three-year low, compares with an 8.1 percent
gain in the previous period and the 7.7 percent median forecast
of economists. Industrial production increased at a slower pace
in June while retail sales growth decelerated.  The Chinese numbers “are probably the best-case scenario
for risk assets, as the print was just weak enough to keep the
markets’ anticipation of aggressive easing alive, while it was
not too hot to take this notion away from the equation,”  Chris Weston , an institutional trader at IG Markets in  Melbourne ,
wrote in an e-mail.  Italian Bonds  Italian borrowing costs fell at an auction today, hours
after Moody’s Investors Service downgraded the country’s bond
rating by two levels to Baa2 from A3 and reiterated its negative
outlook, citing the worsening political and economic situation.  Italy sold 3.5 billion euros ($4.3 billion) of new three-
year bonds, matching a maximum target, and later sold 1.75
billion euros of three longer-dated securities. The Rome-based
Treasury sold the 2015 bond at 4.65 percent, down from the 5.3
percent paid on a similar-maturity bond on June 14. Investors
bid for 1.73 times the amount of 3-year debt offered, up from
1.59 times last month.  Still, Italy’s 10-year bonds fell for a second day, pushing
the yield to about 6 percent.  The Stoxx 600 Index has gained 4.7 percent since euro-area
leaders announced on June 29 plans to ease repayment rules for
Spanish banks, relax conditions for possible aid to Italy and
unveiled a $149 billion economic growth plan.  European Forecasts  European stock strategists are backing away from their
most-pessimistic forecasts as policy makers agree on measures to
tackle the region’s debt crisis.  While sticking to predictions for losses of as much as 16
percent, Morgan Stanley’s Ronan Carr raised his recommendation
on European equities to neutral on July 2 and  Alain Bokobza  of
Societe Generale SA said he has started to reduce the
underweight call he’s had for at least two years. Exane BNP
Paribas said investors can find bargains among companies most
reliant on economic growth.  Storebrand, Norway’s second-largest publicly traded
insurer, rallied 8.2 percent to 24.01 kroner. The company said
it will cut costs by at least 400 million kroner ($66 million)
by 2014 and meet stricter European capital requirements without
selling new shares.  Temenos Group AG gained 5.9 percent to 10.85 francs. The
banking-software maker plunged the most in 3 1/2 years yesterday
as it cut its revenue-growth forecast and said its chief
executive officer will step down.  Ems-Chemie Holding AG (EMSN)  climbed 1.2 percent to 180 Swiss
francs after the maker of engineering plastics for cars and
electronics reported first-half sales of 904 million francs
($918 million), topping the average analyst estimate of 894
million francs. First-half earnings before interest and tax were
167 million francs, more than the 157.8 million francs estimated
by analysts.  Deutsche Telekom  Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE)  gained 5.7 percent to 9.18 euros after
Credit Suisse Group AG raised its rating on the company’s shares
to neutral from underperform.  Neopost SA (NEO)  rose 4.8 percent to 42.93 euros after saying it
bought customer communication management company GMC Software
Technology. GMC posted 2011 sales of 42 million francs, the
company said. Separately, Natixis SA raised the manufacturer of
mailing and shipping equipment to buy from neutral.  Elisa Oyj (ELI1V) , Finland’s largest wireless carrier by
subscribers, jumped 5.7 percent to 16.80 euros as second-quarter
sales of 389 million euros beat the average 384.2 million-euro
analyst estimate.  Peugeot Slumps  Peugeot dropped 7.7 percent to 6.48 euros, for the worst
performance on the Stoxx 600 and the lowest price since at least
October 1989. The company announced plans yesterday to close the
first auto factory in France in 20 years and cut a total of
14,000 jobs, or 6.7 percent of its workforce, to stem mounting
losses. Industry Minister  Arnaud Montebourg  said the government
doesn’t “accept the plan as it is.”  Nokia Oyj (NOK1V)  fell 2.5 percent to 1.51 euros after the mobile-
phone maker struggling to recover lost market share said it will
close two of its four regional distribution centers in China as
part of a restructuring plan it announced last month to halt
mounting losses from plunging smartphone sales. Nokia on June 14
said it would cut as many as 10,000 jobs globally and close
facilities.  A gauge of European lenders performed the worst of the 19
industry groups on the Stoxx 600. Deutsche Bank AG slipped 1.9
percent to 25.60 euros and Bankia SA declined 7 percent to 65.1
euro cents.  Booker Group Plc (BOK) , the largest U.K. food wholesaler, slumped
2.6 percent to 88.95 pence after Shore Capital Group Ltd. cut
the stock to sell from hold.  Sika AG (SIK) , Europe’s biggest maker of chemicals used in
construction, lost 4.1 percent to 1,770 francs after Serge Rotzer, an analyst at Vontobel Holding AG, downgraded the
company’s shares to hold from buy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
