SMA Solar Technology,  Germany ’s
biggest solar company by market value, fell to a record, its
third day of losses since Centrotherm Photovoltaic AG filed for
 bankruptcy protection .  SMA skidded as much as 8 percent to 21 euros a share, its
lowest intraday value since the stock started trading four years
ago. The shares have lost 50 percent this year. Centrotherm
filed for Chapter 11-type protection on July 10.  “Centrotherm may have pulled SMA down,” Daniel Seidenspinner, an analyst at Bankhaus Metzler, said in a phone
interview. “While SMA has a relatively strong balance sheet and
is in a better position than Centrotherm, the fundamental
problem is that the market is shifting to  Asia  and the U.S. For
SMA, it would be difficult to gain a foothold in  China .”  SMA, based in Niestetal, sells inverters, devices that
convert electricity from photovoltaic panels for use in the
grid. Centrotherm sells machinery to solar manufacturers that
have delayed or cancelled investment after panel prices plunged
45 percent the past year, slashing manufacturers’ margins.  SMA’s drop “may tie back to the news about Centrotherm,”
said Christopher Rodler, an analyst at MM Warburg Investment
Research. “The environment for solar companies is bad at the
moment because companies are not investing.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
