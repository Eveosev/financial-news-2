Starbucks Corp. (SBUX) , the world’s largest
coffee-shop operator, said it will open a new plant in Augusta,
Georgia, creating more than 140 manufacturing jobs.  The factory will cost $172 million and open in early 2014,
the company said today in a statement.  Once complete, the facility will produce products currently
manufactured abroad, including Starbucks VIA Ready Brew, as well
as the coffee base for Frappuccino blended beverages and many of
Starbucks ready-to-drink products.  The plant will be Seattle-based Starbucks’s fifth
manufacturing facility in the U.S. The company’s existing
network of four roasting facilities employ more than 830 people
in Kent, Washington; York, Pennsylvania; Sandy Run,  South
Carolina ; and Carson Valley, Nevada.  “During such challenging economic times, I am thrilled
that we are creating jobs and building something special right
here in Georgia,” said Peter Gibbons, executive vice president,
Starbucks Global Supply Chain Operations.  Starbucks advanced 1.8 percent to $53.61 at the close in
 New York , extending its gain this year to 17 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
