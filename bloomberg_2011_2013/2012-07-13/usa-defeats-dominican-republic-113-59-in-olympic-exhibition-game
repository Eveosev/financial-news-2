Kevin Durant  had 24 points and 10
rebounds to lead the U.S. to a 113-59 win against the Dominican
Republic in a pre-Olympic exhibition basketball game.  The U.S. played last night without Blake Griffin of the Los
Angeles Clippers, who will have knee surgery and miss the
Olympics. Griffin should recover in time for National Basketball
Association training camp, Clippers coach Vinny Del Negro said
in a statement released by the team.  “Missing out on the Olympic experience will be tough for
him to take,” Del Negro said. “We’re glad we can get this
fixed now and take advantage of the available time for him to
fully recover.”  Anthony Davis , the top pick in last month’s NBA draft,
substituted for Griffin, scoring nine points in the game in Las
Vegas.  Andre Iguodala  had 18 points and Carmelo Anthony added 13
for the U.S.  The U.S. begins defense of its Olympic title on July 29
against France in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
