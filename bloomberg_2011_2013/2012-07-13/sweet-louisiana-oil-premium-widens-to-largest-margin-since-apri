Light Louisiana Sweet oil’s premium
to West Texas Intermediate increased to the largest since April
as  Brent crude  strengthened versus the U.S. benchmark.  The gap between WTI and Brent increased 66 cents to $15.65
a barrel at 3:03 p.m. in  New York . When Brent rises versus WTI,
it typically boosts the value of U.S. grades that compete
foreign oils priced against the European benchmark.  Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium to WTI widened $1.20 to
$17.20 a barrel at 2:01 p.m. in New York, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the most expensive the grade has
traded relative to WTI since April 25.  Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium was unchanged at $17 a
barrel. Yesterday the grade jumped to the largest premium since
May 9.  Poseidon’s premium increased 50 cents to $11.90 a barrel,

Mars Blend increased 50 cents to $12.75 a barrel over.  Thunder Horse , a sour crude with lower sulfur content than
Mars, Poseidon and Southern Green Canyon, increased 10 cents to
an $15.60 a barrel premium.  Western Canada Select’s discount to WTI was steady at $20 a
barrel. Syncrude’s discount was unchanged at $1.15. Syncrude is
