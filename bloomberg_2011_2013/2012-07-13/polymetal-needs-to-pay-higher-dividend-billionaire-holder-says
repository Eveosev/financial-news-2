Russian billionaire  Alexander Mamut ,
owner of 10 percent of  Polymetal International Plc (POLY) , told  RBC
Daily  he wants the gold producer to pay higher dividends.  Polymetal should offer at least $1 a share more as the 20
cents for 2011 wasnâ€™t enough to compensate for a market lacking
share price gains, Mamut told the Moscow newspaper.  The company may study paying higher dividends in October,
management said in June at an investor day in London according
to Deutsche Bank AG. Polymetal is down 23 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
