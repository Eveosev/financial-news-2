Fabio Capello may sign a two-year
contract next week to become coach of the Russian national
soccer team,  Sport-Express  newspaper said.  Former England manager Capello, 66, agreed to a salary of
at least 5 million euros ($6 million) to replace Dick Advocaat,
Sport-Express said today citing unidentified sport officials.  Advocaat quit as national coach after  Russia  won only one
game and failed to progress out of the group stage at the 2012
European Championship. He made about 7 million euros a year,
according to Sport-Express.  To contact the reporter on this story:
