The  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  employee
known as the ‘London Whale’ and two of his supervisors from the
chief investment office have left the bank, the Wall Street
Journal reported, citing people it didn’t identify.  Bruno Iksil, who got the nickname because of his market-
moving trades, isn’t listed in an employee database as of July
12, the newspaper said. Javier Martin-Artajo, his direct boss,
and Martin-Artajo’s manager Achilles Macris, have also been
removed, according to the Journal.  The three employees made bets on corporate credit indexes
that led to slightly more than $5 billion in losses for the
second quarter, the newspaper said. They had been stopped from
trading, continuing as employees while New York-based JPMorgan
conducted an internal review and sought to unwind those trades,
the Journal said.  Joseph Evangelisti , a spokesman for the  U.S. bank , declined
to comment on the Wall Street Journal report. Iksil couldn’t be
reached and a lawyer for Martin-Artajo and Macris didn’t reply
to e-mails, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
