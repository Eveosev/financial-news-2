Bank of England Governor Mervyn King
discussed Libor issues with other central bankers at Basel in
May 2008, the central bank said today as it released
correspondence on the matter.  The central bank said a letter from then-New York Federal
Reserve President  Timothy Geithner  on recommendations relating
to Libor was forwarded to the British Bankers Association. The
correspondence released included e-mails between  Paul Tucker  and
 Angela Knight  of the BBA.  “Both the Bank and the Federal Reserve were assured by the
BBA that it would take on board the recommendations, either
through actions or through questions on which it would
consult,” the central bank said in a statement accompanying the
correspondence.  The Bank of England also said that “concerns about
difficulties in setting Libor in the stressed market conditions
of late 2007 and 2008 were widely expressed, including in the
media, although no evidence of deliberate wrongdoing had been
cited.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
