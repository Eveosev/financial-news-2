President  Barack Obama  said that if
 Mitt Romney ’s basic premise for his presidential candidacy is
“I’m Mister Fix-It on the economy,” then he would scrutinize
Romney’s record at the private-equity firm Bain Capital LLC.  Asked on “CBS This Morning” about the presumptive
Republican nominee’s work at Bain, Obama said, “I think it’s
entirely appropriate to look at the record and see whether in
fact, his focus was creating jobs and he successfully did that.
And when you look at the record, there are questions there that
have to be asked.”  Romney’s record at Bain is being examined anew as a result
of disclosure of Securities and Exchange Commission documents
showing him as the firm’s head and sole shareholder for several
years after he said he left the company to run the 2002 Winter
Olympics. Obama said that Romney’s experience running Bain
required a different set of skills and priorities than serving
as president.  “That doesn’t necessarily make you qualified to think
about the economy as a whole, because as president my jobs is to
think about the workers,” he said. “My job is to think about
communities where jobs have been outsourced.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
