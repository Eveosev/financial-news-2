A Madrid-bound  Delta Air Lines Inc. (DAL) 
flight was evacuated at New York’s John F. Kennedy International
Airport after wires were found in the bathroom, police said.  Delta Flight 126, with more than 200 passengers, returned
to the airport after wires were found protruding from straws
found on the toilet and sink, said  Paul Browne , a spokesman for
the  New York City Police Department , in an e-mail.  The NYPD bomb squad responded and searched the plane,
Browne said. The search, which included the use of dogs, didn’t
detect an explosive device, Browne said. No arrests have been
made, he said.  A woman who complained of difficulty breathing when the
wires were discovered was questioned and “ruled out as having
made the complaint as a diversion,” Browne said. A man thought
to have last used the bathroom before the wires were found
denied knowledge of them, Browne said.  Ron Marsico, a spokesman for the  Port Authority  of New York
and New Jersey, which operates the airport, declined to comment
on the incident. A representative of Atlanta-based Delta didn’t
immediately return a phone message seeking comment after regular
business hours.  To contact the reporter on this story:
