KKR & Co. edged up its offer for the
preference shares of  WMF Wuerttembergische Metallwarenfabrik AG (WMF) 
on the instruction of a financial regulator as it seeks to buy
the German maker of hotel coffee machines and kitchen utensils.  The private-equity firm will offer 31.80 euros in cash per
preferred share, which the German Federal Financial Supervisory
Authority deemed to be the volume-weighted average domestic
price of the stock in the three months prior to last week’s
announcement of the takeover proposal, KKR said in a statement
today. It had previously said it would offer at least 31.70
euros per preferred share and 47 euros for each ordinary share.
KKR didn’t change its offer for the ordinary shares.  WMF, which is being sold by Swiss private-equity firm
CapVis Equity Partners AG, is expanding its coffee-machine
business and pushing into  China . Private-equity firms CVC
Capital Partners Ltd. and Bain Capital LLC were also interested
in the Geislingen, Germany-based company, people familiar with
the negotiations said in April.  KKR bought Crystal Capital GmbH’s 52 percent stake in WMF
and Crystal Capital, an investment vehicle of CapVis, committed
to tender 256,489 WMF preferred shares, KKR said last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
