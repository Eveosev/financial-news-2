DirecTV (DTV) ’s 20 million customers,
following the loss of Nickelodeon kids’ programming because of
the satellite-TV provider’s dispute with  Viacom Inc. (VIAB) , will begin
receiving the 24-hour Disney Junior channel tomorrow.  Disney Junior, created by  Walt Disney Co. (DIS)  to target viewers
ages 2 to 7, will be permanently added to DirecTV’s lineup as a
basic channel, according to a statement today from the
companies. Disney Junior began last year as a daytime
programming block within the Disney Channel, before becoming its
own 24-hour station this year.  The move lets DirecTV bolster its children’s programming
after blacking out Viacom’s 26 channels, including Nickelodeon
kids’ shows such as “Dora the Explorer” and “SpongeBob
SquarePants.” DirecTV dropped the programs just before midnight
on July 10 following stalled negotiations over the fees that the
satellite company pays for the shows.  Disney Junior’s programs include cartoons and live-action
shows, including “Jake and the Never Land Pirates” and “Handy
Manny.” The channel also airs movies from  Walt Disney Studios 
and its Pixar division.  The plan to add the channel was already in the works before
the Viacom impasse, said  Robert Mercer , a spokesman for El
Segundo, California-based DirecTV, the largest U.S. satellite-TV
provider. Even so, the deal mitigates the need for other kids’
channels, he said.  “Given the unsurpassed quality of Disney Junior’s family-
friendly programming, there’s no reason to watch anything
else,” he said in an e-mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
