Czech Finance Minister Miroslav
Kalousek prefers to raise the tax on cheaper tobacco products
rather than on pricier brands, so that  Philip Morris  would keep
its production facility in the country,  Mlada Fronta Dnes  said
citing the minister.  Philip Morris may start reducing its global production
facilities including the one in the  Czech Republic  and raising
tax on expensive brands may contribute to its closing, the
newspaper added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
