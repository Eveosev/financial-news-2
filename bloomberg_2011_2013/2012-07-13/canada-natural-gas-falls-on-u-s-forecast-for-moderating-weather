Canadian natural gas fell for a
second day after forecasters predicted heat in the Northeast
will ease toward month’s end, which may signal less demand for
the fuel.  August gas  in Alberta declined 2.2 percent as MDA EarthSat
Weather of Gaithersburg, Maryland, said temperatures July 18-22
would fall to normal in Boston and New York.  “It’s a little bit weather-related and heading into the
weekend,”  Peter Linder , president of the DeltaOne Energy Fund
in Calgary, said in a telephone interview. “It’s a little bit
of a pause before we’re testing $3 next week” on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange .  Alberta gas for August delivery dropped 5 cents to C$2.22
per gigajoule ($2.07 per million British thermal units) as of
2:55 p.m. New York time on NGX, a Canadian Internet market. Gas
traded on the exchange is shipped to users in  Canada  and the
U.S. and priced on  TransCanada Corp. (TRP) ’s Alberta system.  Alberta gas has fallen 14 percent this year, from C$2.58 on
Dec. 31, and risen 37 percent from C$1.625 at the end of March.  Natural gas for August delivery on Nymex settled unchanged
at $2.874 per million Btu.  The high in New York and Boston on July 22 may be 83
degrees Fahrenheit (28 Celsius), which is 1 above normal in the
home of the Yankees and one below usual where the Red Sox play,
according to AccuWeather Inc. in  State College , Pennsylvania.  Spot Prices  Spot gas at the Alliance delivery point near  Chicago  rose
0.48 cent to $2.9297 per million Btu on the  Intercontinental
Exchange . Alliance is an express line that can carry 1.5 billion
cubic feet a day from western Canada.  At the Kingsgate point on the border of  Idaho  and British
Columbia, gas fell 4.14 cents, or 1.6 percent, to $2.5156 per
million Btu. At Malin,  Oregon , where Canadian gas is traded for
California markets, prices declined 4.01 cents, or 1.5 percent,
to $2.7176.  Volume on TransCanada’s  Alberta system , which collects the
output of most of the nation’s gas wells, was 16.5 billion cubic
feet at 3 p.m. New York time.  Gas was flowing at a daily rate of 1.96 billion cubic feet
at Empress,  Alberta , where the fuel is transferred to
TransCanada’s main Line.  At McNeil, Saskatchewan, where gas is transferred to the
Northern Border Pipeline for shipment to the Chicago area, the
daily flow rate was 2.02 billion cubic feet.  The available capacity on TransCanada’s British Columbia
system at Kingsgate was 725 million cubic feet. The system was
forecast to carry 1.89 billion cubic feet today, or 72 percent
of normal capacity of 2.62 billion.  The volume on  Spectra Energy ’s British Columbia system,
which gathers the fuel in northeastern British Columbia for
delivery to Vancouver and the Pacific Northwest, totaled 2.78
billion cubic feet at 1:50 p.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
