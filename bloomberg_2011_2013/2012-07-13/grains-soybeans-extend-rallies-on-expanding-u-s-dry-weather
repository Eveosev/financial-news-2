Corn futures rallied to a 10-month
high, wheat reached the highest since February 2011, and
soybeans gained on signs that a drought is expanding in the main
growing region of the U.S., the world’s biggest exporter.  A “large-scale, intense heat wave” will affect most of
the central U.S. during the next 10 days, increasing stress on
crops after the seventh driest May-to-June period since 1895,  T-
Storm Weather LLC  said in a report. At least 50 percent of the
growing region was pressured by temperatures above 90 degrees
Fahrenheit (32 degrees Celsius) in 10 of the last 14 days. This
month may be the warmest July in 117 years, the forecaster said.  “There is no relief in sight, and most crops are running
out of soil moisture to stay alive,” Gregg Hunt, a market
analyst at Archer Financial Services Inc. in Chicago, said in a
telephone interview. “This is setting up to be an international
disaster.”  Corn futures for December delivery climbed 1.1 percent to
close at $7.4025 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the Chicago Board of
Trade, after reaching $7.49, the highest for the most-active
contract since Sept. 13. Prices gained 6.8 percent for the week,
the fourth straight advance and the longest since November.  Wheat futures for September delivery rose 0.1 percent to
$8.4775 a bushel on the CBOT, after touching $8.6575, the
highest since Feb. 22, 2011. The grain jumped 5.1 percent this
week, the fourth straight.  Soybean futures for November delivery advanced 1.5 percent
to $15.525 a bushel in  Chicago , capping a 3.1 percent gain this
week that was the fourth straight gain. On July 11, the price
touched $15.75, the highest since July 2008.  Outlook Reduced  Corn and soybean conditions as of July 8 were the worst for
that date since the drought of 1988, and areas of moderate to
extreme drought have expanded to 63 percent of the Midwest,
government data show. About 66 percent of spring wheat was rated
good or excellent, down from 71 percent the prior week and 73
percent a year earlier, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said
this week.  On July 11, the USDA cut its outlook for domestic corn
output by 12 percent, a month after predicting a record harvest.
The U.S. soybean crop will be the smallest in four years, and
global wheat production will be 1 percent less than forecast in
June, the agency said.  The U.S. is the biggest producer of corn and soybeans and
the largest shipper of grain. Corn is the biggest U.S. crop,
valued at $76.5 billion in 2011, followed by soybeans at $35.8
billion, government figures show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
