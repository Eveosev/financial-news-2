Brazil ’s central bank considers the
country’s banking system well provisioned and isn’t requiring
lenders to set aside additional funds to cover bad loans, said a
member of the government’s economic team with knowledge of the
situation.  The increase of provisions by banks isn’t a concern for the
central bank as it reflects a rise in loan delinquencies, said
the person, who asked not to be identified because the
discussions aren’t public.  O Estado de S. Paulo reported today that the central bank
is demanding additional provisions from mid-sized banks, a
measure that reduced lending and led to losses in the second
quarter. The newspaper didn’t name banks or sources.  To contact the reporters on this story:
