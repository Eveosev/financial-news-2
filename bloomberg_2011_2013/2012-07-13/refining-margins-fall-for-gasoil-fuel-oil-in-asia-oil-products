Refiners’ profits from gasoil fell,
paring the second weekly increase in margins. Losses from making
 fuel oil  were at the widest in five weeks.  Middle Distillates  The  premium  of gasoil to Dubai crude fell 5 cents, or 0.3
percent, to $17.50 a barrel at 10:15 a.m. Singapore time,
according to data from PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a broker. The
spread has widened 1.2 percent so far this week, the second
weekly increase.  Singapore  gasoil  swaps for August rose $1.65, or 1.5
percent, to $115.35 a barrel. Prices gained 1 percent this week,
the least since the five days to June 22, when they dropped 5
percent.  Jet fuel traded at a premium of 75 cents a barrel to gasoil,
unchanged from yesterday. This spread, also known as the  regrade ,
has decreased 25 percent from a week earlier, signaling it is
less profitable to make  aviation fuel .  Fuel Oil  Singapore fuel oil’s  discount  to Dubai crude widened by 40
cents, or 24 percent, to $2.10 a barrel, PVM data showed. The
discount is the biggest since June 5, signaling growing losses
from making the fuel.  High-sulfur fuel-oil  swaps for August jumped $8.25, or 1.4
percent, to $608 a metric ton. Prices have increased 0.5 percent
this week.  The  premium  of 180-centistoke fuel oil to the 380-
centistoke grade was at $11.75 a ton. The premium has dropped $1
from a week earlier, signaling that prices of bunker fuel for
ships rose faster than power-station fuel oil.  Light Distillates  Japan naphtha’s premium to London-traded Brent crude
futures rose to $51.62 a ton from $49.29 yesterday, according to
Bloomberg calculations based on PVM data. The spread has
