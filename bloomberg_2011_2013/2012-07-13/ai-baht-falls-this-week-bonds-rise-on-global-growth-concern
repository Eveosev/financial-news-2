Thailand’s baht dropped this week
and  government bonds  rose as concern global growth is cooling
clouded the outlook for the nation’s exports, which account for
about two-thirds of the economy.  The baht had its first weekly slide since the period ended
June 22 after the  Asian Development Bank  said yesterday the
region will expand less than previously forecast in 2012 amid
 Europe ’s debt crisis.  China  said today its economy grew 7.6
percent last quarter, the slowest pace in more than three years,
after import numbers reported this week missed estimates.  “China’s import data is negative for countries that export
goods to the country as it indicates demand is weakening,” said
Kozo Hasegawa, a Bangkok-based trader at Sumitomo Mitsui Banking
Corp. “There’s been growing concern over the global economic
slowdown and that makes it hard for investors to take riskier
positions. Sentiment is rather weak.”  The baht dropped 0.4 percent from a week ago to 31.75 per
dollar as of 3:06 p.m. in Bangkok, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The currency, which rose 0.2 percent today, touched
31.87 on July 9, the weakest level since June 29. It may trade
between 31.60 and 31.90 next week, Hasegawa said.  The currency’s one-month implied volatility, a measure of
exchange-rate swings used to price options, climbed 50 basis
points, or 0.5 percentage point, today and this week to 5.02
percent.  The yield on the 3.25 percent bonds due June 2017 dropped
one basis point to 3.32 percent this week, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The rate was unchanged today.  Asia  excluding  Japan  will expand 6.6 percent this year
compared with an April estimate of 6.9 percent, ADB President
Haruhiko Kuroda said yesterday in Bangkok. Growth will be 7.1
percent in 2013, compared with a previous forecast of 7.3
percent, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
