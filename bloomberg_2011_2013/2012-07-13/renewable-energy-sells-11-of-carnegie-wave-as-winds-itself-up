Renewable Energy  Holdings Plc sold
11 percent of  Carnegie Wave Energy Ltd. (CWE) , an Australian developer
of technology to generate power from the sea, as the British
company winds itself up after posting losses.  Renewable Energy sold the share for A$1.14 million ($1.1
million) to a group of Australian investors led by 88 Green
Ventures, a Melbourne-based  investment company , according to a
statement from the developer, based in the Isle of Man.  Renewable Energy announced in April a plan to de-list and
wind itself up after selling assets and distributing cash. It
blamed weak financial markets hampering new developments and
reported a 16 million-pound ($25 million) loss in 2011,
including a 12.1 million-pound charge for a decline in Carnegie
Wave’s shares, following a 6.2 million-pound loss in 2010.  Renewable Energy sold the Carnegie Wave share at 1
Australian cent a share, a discount of 2.5 Australian cents to
the current market price. The proceeds will be used to meet the
company’s working capital needs, according to Renewable Energy.  Renewable Energy still holds 10 percent of Carnegie Wave,
backed by  Electricite de France SA , and it will distribute the
stake to shareholders before the end of the year, according to
the statement.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
