Asset Management (Asia) Ltd., which oversees about $8 billion.
“We’ve been selling this week. Given it’s the end of the week
and you don’t know what the policy makers will do over the
weekend, you might as well square up a little bit. Asia is
slowing and it’s not leading by example.”  Europe Debt  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  fell 11 percent from this
year’s high on Feb. 29 through yesterday as Europe’s debt crisis
