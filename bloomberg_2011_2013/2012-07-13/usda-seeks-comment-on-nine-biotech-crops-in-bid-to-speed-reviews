The U.S. Department of Agriculture
is seeking public input on nine new genetically modified crops
developed by companies such as  Monsanto Co. (MON)  and  BASF SE (BAS)  as it
begins a new process aimed at speeding safety reviews.  The public has 60 days to comment on potential
environmental and economic issues related to the companies’
requests to allow unregulated planting and sales of the biotech
seeds, the USDA said today on its  website .  The crops are the first to be considered under a new policy
aimed at deciding whether to approve biotech crops in 13 to 16
months, down from a current average of 3 years. To achieve that
goal, the department is taking public comment at the start of
the review process so concerns can be addressed early.  Applications opened for comment today include four crops
from Monsanto: a glyphosate-tolerant canola, high-yielding soy,
dicamba-tolerant soy and easier breeding corn. Also in the queue
are a BASF soybean that tolerates imidazolinone and a
glyphosate-tolerant soybean from DuPont Co.’s Pioneer unit.  Glyphosate, dicamba and imidazolinone are herbicides.  Others entering the comment period are a  Dow Chemical Co. (DOW) 
soybean that tolerates three herbicides, including 2,4-D, an
Organagan Specialty Fruits apple modified to reduce browning,
and glyphosate-tolerant corn from Genective SA and  Bayer AG. (BAYN)   To contact the reporter on this story:
