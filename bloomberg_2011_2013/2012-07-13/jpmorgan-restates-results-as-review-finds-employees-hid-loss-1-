JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) , the largest
U.S. bank by assets, restated first-quarter results to reduce
net income by $459 million after a review of the firm’s chief
investment office found that employees may have hid losses.  Net income was $4.92 billion, rather than the $5.38 billion
previously reported, the New York-based bank said today in a
regulatory filing. The CIO was responsible for trading losses
that the bank estimated at $2 billion in May.  “Recently discovered information raises questions about
the integrity of the trader marks, and suggests that certain
individuals may have been seeking to avoid showing the full
amount of the losses being incurred in the portfolio during the
first quarter,” the bank said.  Chief Executive Officer  Jamie Dimon  is seeking to restore
confidence in the bank after initially calling reports on the
CIO’s trades a “complete tempest in a teapot” as the bank
released first-quarter earnings in April. The bank today said it
found a material weakness in internal controls for that period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
