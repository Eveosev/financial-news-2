Delta Real Estate , a member of
closely held  Delta Holding , is launching a 25 million-euro ($30
million) renovation of its biggest  hotel  to reopen it under the
Crown Plaza brand.  In cooperation with  InterContinental Hotels Group Plc (IHG) , the
world’s largest provider of hotel rooms that owns the brand,
Belgrade-based Delta will turn the 420-room  Continental  in the
Serbian capital into a five-star hotel and reopen it in
September 2013, said Delta director Zivorad Vasic.  “We made a management agreement with IHG, which will
provide know-how and make sure that the new hotel operates under
Crown Plaza standards,” Vasic said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
