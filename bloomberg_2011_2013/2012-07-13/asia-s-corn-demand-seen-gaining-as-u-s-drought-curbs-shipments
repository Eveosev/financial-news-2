Increased demand for corn imports by
Asian nations including  China  is set to strain global supplies
just as drought in the U.S. reduces shipments from the world’s
largest grower, according to Rabobank International.  China may import at least 8 million metric tons in 2012-
2013 from about 5 million tons in 2011-2012, Jean Yves Chow,
senior industry analyst, said in an interview yesterday.  Japan 
may import 16 million tons, up from 15.5 million tons, he said.  Corn rallied to the highest level since September this week
as hot weather across the Midwest hurt yields, prompting the  U.S.
Department of Agriculture  to cut its projection for this year’s
harvest by 12 percent. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. joined Citigroup
Inc. and Credit Suisse Group AG in boosting price forecasts.  “We will see less exports from the U.S., and it comes to a
question where supplies will be from amid strong demand from
 Asia ,” Chow said. “China, which used to export corn to South
Korea, will be importing almost as much as South Korea.”  December-delivery corn advanced to $7.48 a bushel on July
11, the highest level since Sept. 13. The most-active contract,
which traded at $7.4475 at 4:46 p.m. in Bangkok, is poised for a
fourth weekly gain as U.S. crop conditions deteriorate.  Chow’s forecast for China’s imports is more bullish than
that from the USDA, which projects shipments to the country at 5
million tons in 2012-2013, unchanged from last year.  South Korea 
may import 8 million tons of corn in 2012-2013, while Japan may
take 15.5 million tons, according to the USDA.  Commercial Farms  China’s increased demand is driven by the rising need for
feed grain as the country’s backyard farms are replaced by
commercial farms that use about 50 percent to 55 percent of corn
in their feed formula, Chow said.  China will harvest a record 197.5 million tons of corn this
year from 191.75 million tons in 2011, according to the Food &
Agriculture Organization. Still, even with the rising output,
imports of cereals will increase, the Rome-based United Nations
agency said in an e-mailed report yesterday. China’s corn
imports will climb 1 million tons to 6 million tons, it said.  World grain output will be lower than expected a month ago
as the worsening conditions in the U.S. hurt the outlook for the
corn harvest, the FAO said on July 5. Farmers across the world
will harvest 2.4 billion tons of all grains this year, less than
the amount forecast on June 7, the FAO said.  ‘Before the Drought’  “Global supply-demand was tight even before the drought,”
said Chow, who joined Rabobank in 2007 and covers grains,
animal-protein and food-processing markets. “We started the
year with a low inventory base.”  The USDA reduced its outlook for the U.S. corn harvest to
12.97 billion bushels (329.45 million tons) this year, from a
June prediction of 14.79 billion bushels. The forecast for
global output was cut to 905.2 million tons, from 949.9 million
tons last month, the USDA said. U.S. exports may total 40.6
million tons in 2012-2013, unchanged from 2011-2012.  Dry weather in parts of China increases “the risk of high
corn imports,” Goldman Sachs said in a report on July 11,
without giving a forecast for volumes that may be bought from
overseas. The bank raised its prediction for corn prices to
$6.90 a bushel from $6.30 in three to 12 months.  China’s imports may total 20 million tons by 2015,
according to a forecast from  Olam International Ltd. (OLAM) , the
Singapore-based commodity supplier, last October. Cofco Agri-
Trading & Logistics Co., a unit of China’s biggest grain trader,
said the same month that shipments by 2020 may be as much as 20
million tons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
