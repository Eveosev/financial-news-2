The cost for European banks to
borrow in dollars dropped to a four-week low, according to a
money-markets indicator.  The three-month cross-currency  basis swap , the rate banks
pay to convert euro interest payments into dollars, was 50 basis
points below the euro interbank offered rate at 8:30 a.m. in
London from minus 51 yesterday, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The cost has fallen from a three-month high of 69
basis points on July 5.  The one-year basis swap was little changed at 54 basis
points, or 0.54 percentage point, below Euribor. Euribor is the
rate  banks  say they see each other lending in euros and is
derived from a survey by the European Banking Federation. Three-
month Euribor fell to a record at 0.497 percent yesterday from
0.512 percent.  The Euribor/OIS spread was little changed at 39 basis
points. The Eonia OIS swap, an estimate of average overnight
borrowing costs in euros over the next three months, was little
changed at 11 basis points.  The euro overnight indexed average, or Eonia, dropped to a
record low at 12.8 basis points yesterday from 13 basis points
on July 11.  Lenders increased  overnight deposits  at the Frankfurt-based
ECB yesterday from the lowest level in seven months. Banks in
the 17-nation euro region placed 366 billion euros ($446
billion) from 325 billion euros the day before.  To contact the reporter on this story:
