Kenya ’s shilling weakened for a
third day as oil importers increased demand for dollars.  The currency of  East Africa ’s largest economy depreciated
as much as 0.5 percent to 84.22 per dollar and was trading 0.3
weaker at 84.10 by 2:37 p.m., in the capital Nairobi. The
shilling has gained 3.2 percent since May 30, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  “Kenya’s shilling slipped against the U.S dollar,
primarily because of energy sector importers’ need for the U.S
currency,” Nairobi-based  NIC Bank Ltd. (NICB)  said in an e-mailed note
to clients. Trading levels are expected to range from 83.50 to
84.30 today, the bank said.  The bank today sold 2 billion shillings ($23.8 million) of
seven-day repurchase agreements at a weighted average rate of
14.4 percent, said an official, who asked not to be identified
in line with policy. The bank received bids totalling 8.89
billion shillings after offering 2 billion shillings for repos
and term auction deposits, the official said by telephone from
Nairobi, the capital. The central bank refused all bids for
term-auction deposits, he said.  The longer-tenure term auction deposits introduced as
“additional instruments in liquidity management have enhanced
the open market operations and stabilised the  interbank rate ,”
the bank’s monetary policy committee said July 5.  The bank cut its  benchmark lending rate  for the first time
in 18 months last week, reducing the key rate by 1.5 percentage
points to 16.5 percent. The bank raised borrowing costs by a
record 12.25 percentage points in 2011 to help bolster the
shilling and curb price pressures following drought.  Inflation declined for the seventh straight month to 10.1
percent from 12.2 percent in May, the Kenya National Bureau of
Statistics said June 29.  The Tanzanian shilling gained 0.3 percent to 1,586.50 per
dollar, while  Uganda ’s shilling also added 0.3 percent to
2,466.50 per dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
