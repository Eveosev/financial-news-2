Spain’s underlying consumer prices
were unchanged in June as the economy slumped further into its
second  recession  since 2009.  Core consumer prices , which exclude energy and fresh food,
were unchanged from the prior month, when they rose 0.2 percent,
the National Statistics Institute in Madrid said today. From a
year ago,  core inflation  was 1.3 percent. Prices were forecast
to fall 0.1 percent in the month and increase 1.1 percent from a
year earlier, according to a Bloomberg survey of four
economists.  Spain’s recession probably intensified in the second
quarter as the sovereign debt crisis worsened, the Bank of Spain
estimates, and Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy  said this week the
slump will continue next year. As part of his efforts to fight
the crisis, he announced 65 billion euros ($79 billion) of
additional budget cuts on July 11, including an increase in
value-added tax.  Some retailers may absorb the increase in  sales tax  rather
than passing it on to consumers, who are already suffering from
an unemployment rate of 25 percent and income tax hikes.  Inditex
SA (ITX) , the owner of fashion brand Zara, won’t raise prices to
reflect the increase in the main rate to 21 percent from 18
percent, the Arteixo, Spain-based company said on June 11.  Spanish inflation, which was  higher  than the euro-region
average for a decade, is now below that of other European
economies. Spain’s headline inflation rate was 1.8 percent in
June, based on European Union calculations, compared with 2.4
percent in the 17-nation euro area.  To contact the reporter on this story:
