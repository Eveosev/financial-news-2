Asian  stocks  fell, with the regional
benchmark posting its largest weekly retreat since May, amid
concern a slowdown in economies from China and Korea to
Australia will hurt corporate profits.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the world’s largest mining company, and
 Samsung Electronics Co. (005930) , the biggest maker of televisions and
mobile phones, were the main drags on the  MSCI Asia Pacific
Index (MXAP)  as investors sold shares with earnings closely tied to
economic growth.  Whitehaven Coal Ltd. (WHC)  slumped 20 percent as
takeover optimism for the Australia coal producer dissipated.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index slid 2.8 percent, the largest
weekly decline since the third week in May, to 115.28. Data this
week showed  China’s economy  expanded at the slowest rate in
three years and Singapore’s gross domestic product shrank last
quarter as South Korea and Taiwan cut full-year forecasts,
adding to concern that global growth is faltering.  “The global economy is deteriorating faster than central
banks can ease policy,” said  Tomomi Yamashita , a senior  fund
manager  in Tokyo at Shinkin Asset Management Co., which oversees
about $6.3 billion. “Your best bet is to hold on to cash right
now.”  Central banks in China, Europe, Taiwan, South Korea and
Brazil have cut  interest rates  in the past fortnight to bolster
economies against the impacts of Europe’s debt crisis and the
faltering recovery in the U.S.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index fell almost 11 percent from
this year’s high on Feb. 29 through July 13, as the deepening
crisis in Europe weighed on growth and corporate earnings.
Shares in the measure are valued at 11.75 times estimated
earnings on average, compared with 13.06 times for the Standard
& Poor’s 500 Index and 10.73 times for the Stoxx Europe 600
Index.  Nikkei 225  Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average lost 3.3 percent, snapping
five weeks of gains, as the  Bank of Japan  altered its stimulus
program without adding extra money. The bank expanded its asset-
purchase fund to 45 trillion yen ($564 billion) from 40 trillion
yen, while paring a loan program by 5 trillion yen.  South Korea’s Kospi Index fell 2.4 percent as an unexpected
interest rate cut from the Bank of Korea failed to alleviate
investors’ concern that the central bank can spur growth. The
 MSCI Emerging Markets Index (MXEF)  slid 2.1 percent this week.  Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index slid 1.8 percent after
employers in the Pacific nation unexpectedly reduced payrolls in
June and the jobless rate rose.  Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index dropped 3.6 percent, the most
since May, and China’s Shanghai Composite Index lost 1.7 percent
as China’s growth slowed for a sixth quarter, putting pressure
on Premier Wen Jiabao to boost stimulus to secure a second-half
rebound.  Materials Slide  Raw-material shares and information technology stocks
posted the  largest declines  on the regional Asian benchmark this
past week.  BHP Billiton fell 5 percent to A$30.48. Rio Tinto Group,
the world’s third largest mining company, slid 6.4 percent to
A$54.08. Cnooc Ltd., China’s largest offshore oil producer,
declined 3.1 percent to HK$15.02.  Samsung Electronics slid 1.9 percent to 1.139 million won.
 ZTE Corp. (763) , China’s second-biggest maker of telecommunications
equipment, fell 16 percent to HK$12.50 amid concerns slower
economic growth and a possible probe into European Union
subsidies may threaten exports.  Whitehaven, Dentsu  Whitehaven tumbled 20 percent to A$3.45 in Sydney amid
speculation an improved takeover bid by Tinkler Group Pty.,
controlled by billionaire  Nathan Tinkler , won’t materialize.
Whitehaven said on June 13 it rejected a “conditional and
incomplete” proposal from the mining magnate.  Tinkler led a group that made a conditional A$5.3 billion
($5.4 billion) offer to buy the company for A$5.20 a share,
Whitehaven said in a statement after markets closed July 13.
That’s a 51 percent premium to this week’s closing price.  Dentsu Inc. (4324)  fell 9 percent to 2,145 yen after agreeing to
buy Britain’s Aegis Group Plc for 3.16 billion pounds ($4.9
billion), a record acquisition by the 111-year-old Japanese
advertising company and one of the biggest in the industry’s
history, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Sun Hung Kai Properties Ltd. (16)  dropped 0.1 percent to
HK$95.45 this week before the shares were suspended. The
billionaire co-chairmen of Sun Hung Kai,  Hong Kong ’s biggest
developer, and the city’s former No.2 government official were
charged with bribery and public misconduct by the municipal
anti-graft agency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
