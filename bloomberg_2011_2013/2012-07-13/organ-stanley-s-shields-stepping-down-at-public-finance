Morgan Stanley (MS)  named Brian Wynne and
Charlie Visconsi to replace Stratford Shields when he steps down
Sept. 1 as head of public-finance, according to Michael Heaney,
global head of credit.  Wynne, the unit’s second-in-command, and Visconsi will take
over as co-heads, Heaney said yesterday in a memo. With the New
York-based company for 23 years, Wynne has been Shields’s deputy
since 2008 while Visconsi, a 14-year employee, has been co-head
of the bank’s Infrastructure East Group since 2007.  Shields, who has run the department for five years, will
remain with the firm working with municipal issuers as a senior
banker in the  Chicago  office, Heaney said. Shields has split his
time between that city and  New York . While putting Morgan
Stanley in the top four rankings of muni underwriters for
several years, Shields also helped the bank land as much as 10
percent of the negotiated new-issue market, Heaney said.  “These rankings and market share are a testament to both
his leadership as well as the tremendous talent within the
public-finance department,” Heaney said in the memo. “Brian
and Charlie have complementary skills and together will lead the
business to continued success.”  Shields sought a change that would let him reside full-time
in Chicago, Heaney said. The department at the sixth-largest
U.S. bank by assets provides financial services for municipal-
debt issuers. The company also controls Morgan Stanley Smith
Barney, the world’s largest brokerage.  To contact the reporter on this story:
