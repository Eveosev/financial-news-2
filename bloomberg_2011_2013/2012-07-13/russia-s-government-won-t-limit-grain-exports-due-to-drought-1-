Russia won’t impose restrictions on
grain exports because of drought, Deputy Prime Minister  Arkady Dvorkovich  told reporters in Moscow today.  The grains and legumes crop estimate is seen at about 85
million metric tons, Nikolai Fedorov, agriculture minister, said
on June 25. That’s below the ministry’s previous estimate of 94
million tons.  -- With assistance from Marina Sysoyeva in Moscow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
