Arizona State University  linebacker
 Brandon Magee  signed a contract with the  Boston Red Sox  that
will allow him to play his final college football season before
joining the Major League Baseball organization.  Magee, 21, a three-time letter-winner on the school’s
baseball team, will play this fall with the Sun Devils and have
the opportunity to enter the National Football League draft next
year, according to Arizona State’s athletics  website . The 6-
foot, 225-pound outfielder was selected by Boston in the 23rd
round of the major-league draft last month.  Red Sox spokeswoman Leah Tobin confirmed the contract in a
telephone interview.  Magee missed the 2011 season after tearing his Achilles
tendon during preseason football camp and is entering his fifth
season. He started 11 games in 2010 and had 73 tackles, second-
most on the team.  Magee was a member of the  Arizona  State baseball team from
2009 to 2011, when it won two Pac-10 conference titles and made
two trips to the College World Series. He was previously drafted
by MLB’s Tampa Bay Rays and  Oakland Athletics .  To contact the reporter on this story:
