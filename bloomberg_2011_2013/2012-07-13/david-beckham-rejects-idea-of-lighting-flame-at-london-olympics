David Beckham  dismissed the idea of
lighting the flame to open the  London  Games, saying the role
should go to an Olympian.  The former England soccer team captain who was left off the
British Olympic squad said the honor at the July 27 opening
ceremony should go to a gold medal winner.  “I’ve always said lighting the torch in the stadium is
something that should be done by an Olympian, an Olympian who
has done incredible things for our country and won gold
medals,” Beckham told reporters in  Los Angeles  in comments
broadcast by Sky Sports News. “I’m sure whoever decides that,
it will be an Olympian, but we’ll have to wait and see.”  Sky Sports News said five-time rowing gold medalist Steve Redgrave or two-time decathlon champion Daley Thompson are the
probable choices to light the torch.  Beckham, 37, had an ambassadorial role in London’s bid to
win the 2012 Games and said he’s disappointed in being left out
of Team GB by coach  Stuart Pearce .  “Everyone knows how proud I am of representing my country,
and to do it in my hometown on such a big stage would have been
incredible,” said the Los Angeles Galaxy midfielder, whose 115
appearances for England are a record for an outfield player.  For now, Beckham said, he’s just looking forward to
enjoying the event as a spectator.  “I’m going to be just proud to be there as a fan, more
than anything, in a part of London where I grew up,” Beckham
said. “I used to play soccer over the fields that have been
changed now. As a fan and as an Englishman, I’m going to be very
proud.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
