OAO Mobile TeleSystems (MBT) , Russia’s
biggest cellphone company by subscribers, rose the most in two
weeks after it demanded Uzbekistan stop an investigation into a
local subsidiary and release its detained employees.  American depositary receipts of MTS, as the company is
known, advanced 2.6 percent to $17.53 at 12:09 p.m. in New York,
poised for the biggest increase since June 26.  MTS will defend its business in Uzbekistan, including by
using “international investment protection norms” after the
country’s government arrested and detained managers of local
subsidiary Uzdunrobita, the company said in a statement today.  The office of Uzbek President Islam Karimov did not
immediately return an e-mailed request for comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
