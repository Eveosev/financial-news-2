Turkish debt  yields  advanced for a
second day, rebounding from the lowest in 10 months and pushing
bonds toward an exit from overbought territory.  Yields on two-year benchmark debt rose three basis points,
or 0.03 percentage point, to 7.95 percent, paring this month’s
fall to 52 basis points. The Relative Strength Index for
benchmark bonds advanced to 15.6, remaining in an overbought
territory for a 14th day. An RSI reading above 70 indicates a
security may be poised to fall and below 30 it may be set for a
rise.  Yields sank 88 basis points between June 26 and July 11 to
the lowest level since September on speculation of interest rate
cuts after Governor Erdem Basci said he may trim the inflation
estimate toward 5 percent from 6.5 percent. The monetary policy
committee will convene July 19. Yields have dropped 306 basis
points this year, the biggest slide among 17  emerging markets 
tracked by Bloomberg.  “We are seeing that 7.85 percent level is resistance level
for benchmark bonds and it will not be easy to break this
resistance before the monetary policy is clarified in the
committee meeting,” Bora Tamer Yilmaz, a vice president at
Istanbul-based Halk Securities, said in e-mailed comments.  The central bank today lent 4 billion liras ($2.2 billion)
at the lowest 5.75 percent funding rate in its daily repurchase
agreements auction. The liquidity provided equals the amount
lenders have to repay from last week’s auctions. The money
loaned today in one-month repo auction was cut to 2 billion
liras from 4 billion liras last week.  The  average cost of borrowing  in  Turkey  increased to 8.3
percent yesterday, up for a second day, reflecting Basci’s
tightening stance. The lira gained 0.3 percent to 1.8160 per
dollar, extending its appreciation this week to 0.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
