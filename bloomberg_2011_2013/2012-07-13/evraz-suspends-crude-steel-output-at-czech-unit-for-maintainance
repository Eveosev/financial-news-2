Evraz Plc (EVR) , Russiaâ€™s largest
steelmaker, said it will suspend crude steel production at its
Vitkovice unit in the Czech Republic from July 17 for almost a
month due to regular maintenance.  The temporary shutdown is caused by the disruption of
liquid pig-iron supplies from  ArcelorMittal (MT)  Ostrava due to
repairs on a railway bridge in the region, Evraz said in an e-
mailed statement. It will use the break for mild repairs of
technological equipment at Vitkovice Steel, Evraz said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
