The Standard & Poor’s GSCI  gauge  of
24 commodities rose 1 percent to 621.19 at 4 p.m. New York time.
The UBS Bloomberg CMCI  index  of 26 raw materials advanced 1.2
percent to 1,532.991.  BASE METALS  Copper rose the most in two weeks on speculation that
policy makers will roll out additional stimulus measures after
economic growth slowed to a three-year low in  China , the world’s
biggest consumer of industrial metals.  Copper futures for September delivery gained 2.6 percent to
settle at $3.504 a pound on the Comex in New York, the biggest
gain for a most-active contract since June 29. The metal rose

months climbed 1.9 percent to $7,700 a metric ton ($3.49 a
pound).  Nickel, zinc, aluminum, lead and tin also rose in London.  LIVESTOCK  Hog futures dropped to an 18-month low as climbing
temperatures across the U.S. reduced outdoor grilling, curbing
meat demand. Cattle prices rose.  Temperatures in the central and western Midwest will stay
above normal with “spikes in heat” into the mid-90s to low
100s Fahrenheit starting early next week, Commodity Weather
Group LLC in Bethesda,  Maryland , said in a report. The price of
wholesale pork, a gauge of demand, headed for the third straight
weekly decline.  On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, hog futures for October
settlement fell 2.3 percent to settle at 79.475 cents a pound.
Hog futures for August settlement, the contract with the highest
volume, fell 2 percent to 90.4 cents a pound.  Cattle futures for August delivery rose 0.1 percent to
$1.172 a pound. Earlier, the price touched $1.163, the lowest
since June 27.  GRAINS  Corn futures rallied to a 10-month high, wheat reached the
highest since February 2011, and soybeans gained on signs that a
drought is expanding in the main growing region of the U.S., the
world’s biggest exporter.  Corn futures for December delivery climbed 1.1 percent to
close at $7.4025 a bushel on the  Chicago  Board of Trade, after

Sept. 13.  Wheat futures for September delivery rose 0.1 percent to
$8.4775 a bushel on the CBOT, after touching $8.6575, the
highest since Feb. 22, 2011. The grain jumped 5.1 percent this
week, the fourth straight increase.  Soybean futures for November delivery advanced 1.5 percent
to $15.525 a bushel in Chicago, capping a 3.1 percent rise this
week that was the fourth straight gain.  SOFT COMMODITIES  Cotton futures rose the most in five weeks on speculation
that China, the world’s top consumer, may step up efforts to
accelerate economic expansion. Coffee, sugar and cocoa also
advanced.  Orange juice  declined.  Cotton for December delivery jumped 3.9 percent to settle
at 72.66 cents a pound on ICE in  New York , the biggest increase

percent to $1.2255 a pound in New York. That was the fourth
straight decline, the longest slide since mid-June.  CRUDE OIL  Oil rose for a third day, the longest winning streak in a
month, as slowing growth in China fueled stimulus speculation
and U.S. equities advanced.  Crude for August delivery rose $1.02 to settle at $87.10 a
barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , capping a weekly
gain of 3.1 percent. Prices are down 12 percent this year.  Brent oil for August settlement gained $1.33, or 1.3
percent, to $102.40 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe exchange.  OIL PRODUCTS  Heating oil surged to a six-week high on speculation
China’s slowest expansion in three years may prompt policy
makers to add economic stimulus.  Heating oil for August delivery rose 1.49 cents, or 0.5
percent, to $2.7882 a gallon on the Nymex, the highest
settlement since May 29. Futures gained 2.9 percent this week,
marking the first three-week string of gains since Feb. 24.  August-delivery gasoline gained 0.99 cent, or 0.4 percent,
to $2.8161 a gallon on the exchange, the highest settlement
since May 31. Prices rose 3.7 percent this week.  NATURAL GAS  Natural gas futures settled unchanged in New York as milder
weather at the end of July may reduce demand from power plants
after a heat wave in the eastern U.S. next week.  Natural gas for August delivery settled at $2.874 per
million British thermal units for a second day on the Nymex. The
futures, which reached a six-month high of $3.06 on July 6, are
down 3.8 percent this year after gaining 3.5 percent this week.  PRECIOUS METALS  Gold climbed for the first time in four days on speculation
that slowing growth in China will spur policy makers to add to
stimulus measures, and on increased demand in  India , the world’s
biggest precious metals consumer.  Gold futures for August delivery rose 1.7 percent to settle
at $1,592 an ounce on the Comex in New York. Prices climbed 0.8
percent this week.  Silver futures for September delivery advanced 0.8 percent
