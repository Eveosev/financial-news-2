Kazakhstan is suffering from growing
extremism, with the authorities struggling to stop such crimes,
President  Nursultan Nazarbayev  said.  “Radical extremist elements are exerting severe pressure
on the state and society as a whole,” Nazarbayev said today in
the capital, Astana, according to his  website . “People are
angry at law enforcement’s inability to prevent these crimes.”  The president of the former Soviet Union’s biggest oil
producer after Russia said he’s “unhappy” with the work of
law-enforcement agencies, particularly the National Security
Committee. There have been more than 100 crimes linked to
terrorism and extremism since the start of 2011, causing the
deaths of tens of civilians and law-enforcement officers, he
said.  Kazakhstan is predominantly Muslim and borders Russia and
China.  To contact the reporter on this story:
