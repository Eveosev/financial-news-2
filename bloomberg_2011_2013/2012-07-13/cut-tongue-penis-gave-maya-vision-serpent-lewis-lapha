In A.D. 681, when Shield Jaguar
ascended the throne in Yaxchilan, now near the Guatemala-Mexico
border, his principal wife, Lady Xoc, knelt, perforated her
tongue and drew a thorn-studded rope through the wound.  (To listen to the podcast, click  here .)  Accompanied by music and dance, such pain-filled Mayan
rituals date back at least to A.D. 199. They were watched by the
assembled people, who’d fasted and washed in preparation.  At the climactic point, the new ruler would lacerate his
penis, agitating the wound to make the blood flow more
copiously.  Burning the strips of paper that caught the blood created
great clouds of black smoke from which the Vision Serpent
appeared.  I spoke with Peter Watson, author of “The Great Divide:
Nature and Human Nature in the Old World and the New,” on the
following topics:  1. Great Experiment  2. Reaction to Nature  3. No Horse, No Wheel  4. Propitiation vs. Supplication  5. Alcohol Vs. Hallucinogens  To buy this book in  North America , click  here .  ( Lewis Lapham  is the founder of  Lapham’s Quarterly  and the
