JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) ’s investment
bank cut the amount earmarked for compensation by 22 percent to
$2.01 billion in the second quarter as the division generated 7
percent less revenue.  The unit set aside $4.91 billion for pay in the first six
months of the year, enough to compensate each of the 26,553
employees an average of $184,989 for the period, according to a
 figures posted  today on the New York-based company’s website.
That’s down from the first half of 2011, when the firm set aside
$211,358 for each of the unit’s 27,716 employees.  Pay at the world’s biggest lenders has drawn extra scrutiny
since the 2008 credit crisis, with regulators and lawmakers
saying compensation plans encouraged bankers to take too much
risk. JPMorgan said today it intends to claw back two years of
compensation from three employees in the firm’s chief investment
office after a $5.8 billion trading loss. The lender accepted an
offer from Ina Drew, 55, the former head of the CIO, to forfeit
her pay for the same period.  The investment bank’s compensation costs equaled 33 percent
of revenue excluding accounting gains for the second quarter,
down from 36 percent a year earlier. The  unit  allocated $2.6
billion to pay traders, dealmakers and other personnel in the
same period of 2011.  Net income for the investment bank, run by Jes Staley, 55,
fell to $1.91 billion in the quarter from $2.06 billion the
previous year. The unit generated 39 percent of JPMorgan’s $4.96
billion in profit, up from 38 percent in the same period last
year.  The unit had 846 more people than at the end of the first
quarter and 1,163 fewer than a year earlier, according to
today’s disclosure. Companywide, the staff expanded to 262,882
as of June 30 from 261,453 at the end of the first quarter and
250,095 at the middle of 2011.  To contact the reporters on this story:
