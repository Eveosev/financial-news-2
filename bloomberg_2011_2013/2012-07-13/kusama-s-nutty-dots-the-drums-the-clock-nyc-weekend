The hit of the 2011 Venice Biennale
is back in  Manhattan : Christian Marclay’s “The Clock.”  It’s a 24-hour compilation of movie scenes in which people
look at watches or clocks as they rush to an assignation or a
train.  Thanks to a sophisticated computer program, no matter what
time it is in the movie, it is also your time as you are
watching. And that’s magical and enchanting.  Part of the Lincoln Center Festival, it’s free at the David
Rubenstein Atrium, 61 W. 62nd St.  Information: +1-212-875-5350;

in a nut house to appear at the opening of her retrospective at
the Whitney Museum.  As you will see, she fancies brightly hued polka dots and
infinity nets in her paintings, drawings, sculpture, film,
performance art and installations.  She used to live in New York in the 1960s, devoted to
happenings and missives. Once she wrote an open letter to
 Richard Nixon , offering to have sex with him in exchange for
stopping the  Vietnam War .  “Yayoi Kusama” runs through Sept. 30 at the Whitney
Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Ave. Information: +1-212-
570-3600;  http://whitney.org .  Saturday Afternoon  The Village Voice’s free 4Knots Festival is crowding two
piers at the South Street Seaport.  Featuring the sassy surf pop of The Drums and shaggy indie
rock of Archers of Loaf, the day is packed with a rollicking
lineup sure to please everyone.  Buzzy Brooklyn breakouts Fast Years open at 12:30 p.m., so
get to Pier 17 early.  Stay for the after-party with Black Lips and DJ Jonathan
Toubin at the Beekman Beer Garden Beach Club, 89 South St.

Ballet presents “Giselle” with Isabelle Ciaravola in the title

faithless lover from raging female Wilis.  Performances of all shows run through July 22 at the David
H. Koch Theatre. Information: +1-212-870-5570;

does the honors at the opening of the Well in Bushwick. He’s
joined by the Flatbush Zombies, among others.  It promises to be the biggest beer garden in the city, with
an 11,000-square-foot outdoor space geared for performance.  There’s champagne and lots of liquor but the place is all
about beer, with suds available from every brewery in the state.  At 272 Meserole St. Brooklyn. Information: +1-347-599-1759;

verdant forests and an abundance of farms.  Then came surveyors and developers armed with dynamite, who
created our neatly numbered streets and avenues.  It’s your last chance to see how it happened: “The
Greatest Grid: The Master Plan of Manhattan, 1811-2011” has
rare topographical maps, historic photos and prints, plus
interactive displays, and it’s closing today.  Don’t miss the monumental contemporary urban paintings of
Stone Roberts at the Museum of the City of  New York  until Sept.
16.  At 1220 Fifth Ave. Information: +1-212-534-1672;

from Beaujolais and delicacies from Rouge Tomate, Payard
Patisserie & Bistro and Macaron Cafe.  There will be a band, can-can dancers, a show of classic
Citroen cars, and, of course, an accordionist and mime.  Organized by the French Institute Alliance Francaise, the
fete starts at noon and runs through 5 p.m. on 60th St. between
Fifth and Lexington Avenues. Information: +1-212-355-6100;
