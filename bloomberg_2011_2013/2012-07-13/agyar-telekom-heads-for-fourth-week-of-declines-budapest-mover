Magyar Telekom Nyrt.,  Hungary ’s
former phone monopoly, headed for a fourth week of declines
after announcing yesterday that it will increase prices as a
result of “unfavorable economic and market processes.”  The shares of the company, controlled by  Deutsche Telekom
AG (DTE)  declined as much as 0.5 percent and traded 0.2 percent lower
at 430 forint by 10:47 a.m. in Budapest. The stock has weakened
0.7 percent this week, extending the longest streak of weekly
declines since August 2011.  Hungarian telecommunications companies, which also include
units of  Vodafone Group Plc (VOD)  and  Telenor ASA (TEL) , have to pay a new
tax on phonecalls from this month. The price increase announced
by Magyar Telekom yesterday doesn’t compensate for the tax,
which will cut the company’s earnings, Gergely Palffy, a
Budapest-based analyst at  KBC Groep NV (KBC) ’s broker unit, wrote in a
research report today. He has a hold rating on the stock.  Vodafone and Telenor indicated they would pass on the costs
at least for this year to customers, Palffy wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
