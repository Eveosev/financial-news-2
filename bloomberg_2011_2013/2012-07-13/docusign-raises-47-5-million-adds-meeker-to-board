DocuSign Inc. , a provider of
electronic-signature services, raised $47.5 million in a
financing round led by Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers and
added  Mary Meeker , a partner at the venture firm, to its board.  Accel Partners and a large institutional investor joined in
the funding round, San Francisco-based DocuSign said today in a
statement. Comcast Ventures and SAP Ventures provided additional
investment, joined by  Salesforce.com Inc. (CRM)  and the National
Association of Realtors.  Founded in 2004, DocuSign enables customers to gather
legally binding, secure signatures over the Internet using
cloud-based computing. DocuSign has 20 million users who have
signed more than 150 million documents in 188 countries, and it
adds 60,000 new customers each day.  “DocuSign’s easy-to-use e-signature platform is
transforming the way documents are processed and delivered, with
record speed and efficiency,” Meeker said in the statement.
“This financing highlights the appeal of the e-signature
transaction management market and the value of DocuSign’s
global, viral network.”  LendingClub, a peer-to-peer Internet lender, added Meeker
to its board last month as part of a $15 million investment from
Kleiner Perkins. Meeker was previously a technology analyst at
 Morgan Stanley. (MS)   To contact the reporter on this story:
