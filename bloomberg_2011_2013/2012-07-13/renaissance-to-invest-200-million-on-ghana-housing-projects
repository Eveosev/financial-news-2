Renaissance Group will invest $200
million over the next 10 to 12 years on residential projects in
 Ghana , said Dela Wosornu, the company’s vice president for West
 Africa .  The company plans to build two complexes in the West
African nation to accommodate 166,000 people, Wosornu said in an
interview yesterday in Accra, the capital.  Renaissance is seeking to take advantage of growth in the
economy and an expanding urban middle class in the region.
Ghana’s economy grew 14.4 percent last year, the fastest in
Africa, and will expand an estimated 9.4 percent this year,
after it started producing oil in December 2010. The company is
also building similar projects in  Kenya ,  Democratic Republic  of
Congo, Zambia, and Zimbabwe, according to Wosornu.  “Ghana is characterized by stable democratic dispensation,
rule of law and robust economic growth,” Wosornu said. “The
population is young and is growing; it’s a very aspirational
society.”  A complex 30 kilometers (19 miles) east of Accra will
provide 22,000 residential units and 24,000 units will be built
in the country’s Western Region.  Ghanaians are able to more-easily get mortgages, creating
opportunities for developers, Wosornu said. “It is possible now
to obtain a 15-year mortgage for 18,000 cedis ($9,245),” he
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
