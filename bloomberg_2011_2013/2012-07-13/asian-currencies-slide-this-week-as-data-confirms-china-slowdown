Asian currencies fell for a second
week as Chinese data added to signs the global economy is
slowing, helping drive the worst five-day performance in
regional stocks in almost two months.  South  Korea ’s won snapped a six-week winning streak after
the central bank cut  interest rates  and trimmed its 2012 growth
forecast to 3 percent from 3.5 percent.  China ’s gross domestic
product increased by the slowest rate in more than three years
in the second quarter, while imports missed economists’
estimates, damping the outlook for Asian exports.  “There has been growing concern over the global economic
slowdown and that makes it hard for investors to take riskier
positions,” said Kozo Hasegawa, a Bangkok-based currency trader
at Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp. “Sentiment is rather weak.”  The won weakened 1.1 percent since July 6 to 1,150.20 per
dollar in  Seoul , according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
Philippine peso fell 0.5 percent to 41.98,  Indonesia ’s rupiah
lost 0.5 percent to 9,448 and Thailand’s baht declined 0.1
percent to 31.66.  The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia Dollar Index, which tracks the
region’s 10 most-traded currencies excluding the yen, was near
the lowest this month, following a 0.5 percent loss in the
previous week. The gauge’s 60-day historical volatility climbed
to 3.67 percent from 3.64 percent on July 6.  Korea, China  The  Bank of Korea  lowered its growth assessment after
unexpectedly cutting its benchmark seven-day repurchase rate by
25 basis points to 3 percent July 12, the first reduction since
February 2009.  Bank Indonesia  kept borrowing costs unchanged at
5.75 percent on the same day.  China, the world’s second-largest economy, grew 7.6 percent
in the second quarter from a year earlier, compared with the 8.1
percent pace in the first three months and the median estimate
in a Bloomberg survey for a 7.7 percent expansion, the
statistics bureau said in Beijing yesterday.  Europe ’s escalating debt crisis prompted Moody’s investors
Service to lower  Italy ’s credit rating July 12 as investors
pushed up the nation’s cost of borrowing on concern it may fail
to meet fiscal targets.  “China holds the key to the economic recovery and if
China’s rebound kicks off in the second half, the outlook for
many nations including  South Korea  could improve,” said Oh Suk
Tae, an economist at SC First Bank Korea Ltd. in Seoul.  The  yuan  fell 0.23 percent to 6.3789 per dollar, the most
since the five days ended June 1, according to the China Foreign
Exchange Trade System. The central bank lowered the currency’s
daily reference rate for a third day, by 0.05 percent to 6.3247.  Singapore GDP Contracts  Singapore  data yesterday added to signs China’s slowing
growth is having an impact on other regional nations. The city-
state’s GDP fell an annualized 1.1 percent in the three months
through June from the previous quarter, when it climbed a
revised 9.4 percent, the Trade Ministry said in an e-mailed
statement. The median estimate of 14 economists in a Bloomberg
News survey was for a 0.6 percent expansion.  China’s exports grew 11.3 percent last month, slowing from
15.3 percent in May, while imports increased 6.3 percent
compared with 12.7 percent. Foreign-exchange reserves fell $65
billion to $3.24 trillion at the end of June, the People’s Bank
of China said July 12. Policy makers cut the one-year lending
rate in June and July.  “The decline in reserves probably reflects capital
outflows as growth slows,” said Tommy Ong, senior vice-
president of treasury and markets at DBS Bank ( Hong Kong ) Ltd.
“We expect China’s growth to rebound in the third quarter as
government stimulus should come into effect.”  Rupee Advances  India ’s rupee strengthened the most since July 3 yesterday,
erasing the weekly loss, on speculation the central bank will
join policy makers worldwide in taking steps to spur growth.  The  Reserve Bank  of India may lower interest rates by 50
basis points at a review on July 31, according to Citigroup Inc.
The monetary authority had kept borrowing costs unchanged last
month after lowering them in April for the first time since
2009. A government report July 12 showed industrial output rose
2.4 percent in May, less than an average 5.1 percent in the
previous two years.  “We believe the rupee has overshot and that positive
changes are starting to occur,” said Gaurav Garg, a strategist
at Citigroup in Singapore. In the short term, the rupee is “our
most-favored currency in  Asia ,” he said.  The rupee climbed 0.6 percent this week to 55.1450 per
dollar, buoyed by a 1.4 percent rally yesterday. Elsewhere,
Taiwan’s dollar depreciated 0.3 percent to NT$30.015 against its
U.S. counterpart and Malaysia’s ringgit lost 0.2 percent to
3.1858. The Vietnamese dong was little changed at 20,865.  To contact the reporters on this story:
