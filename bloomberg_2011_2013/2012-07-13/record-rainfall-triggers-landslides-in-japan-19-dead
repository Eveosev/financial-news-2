Record rainfall in southwestern
 Japan  left at least 19 people dead as landslides destroyed
houses and rivers burst their banks.  A record 50 centimeters (20 inches) of rain fell in parts
of the island of Kyushu within 24 hours through yesterday, with
some areas lashed by as much as 10 centimeters per hour early
this morning, the  Japan Meteorological Agency   said . The agency
issued advisories for severe thunderstorms and further flooding
as the weather front moves northeast across the rest of Japan.  Eighteen people died in landslides and flooding in Kumamoto
prefecture, central Kyushu, national broadcaster NHK reported,
while a 74 year-old man died in eastern Oita prefecture. Eight
people are missing and about 28,000 people were evacuated to
shelters in Kumamoto, with the heavy rainfall expected to
continue throughout today, the broadcaster said on its  website .  Kyushu Railway Co. said it suspended some train services,
including on the coastal line linking Kagoshima in the south and
