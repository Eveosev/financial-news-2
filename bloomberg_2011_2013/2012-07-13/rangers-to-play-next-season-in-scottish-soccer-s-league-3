The reformed Rangers soccer club
will play next season in  Scotland ’s League 3, the Scottish
Football League said.  Rangers was rejected July 4 by the Scottish Premier League
to stay in the top division after being reformed. The 30 SFL
clubs voted today to drop the club to the fourth division.  The 54-time Scottish champion went into liquidation last
month after the U.K. tax authorities rejected a proposal to
repay creditors only a fraction of the club’s debts as part of a
plan to exit administration.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
