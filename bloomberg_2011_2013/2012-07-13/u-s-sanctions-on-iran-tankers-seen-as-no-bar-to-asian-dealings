Following are comments on the
freezing of U.S. assets of Iranian oil-tanker operator NITC Co.
from Joe Corless, operations director at Gray Page, which tracks
vessels and investigates corporate structures.  The U.S. Treasury Department said yesterday it would block
transactions through the country’s financial system involving
NITC and 27 affiliated entities as the West tightens sanctions
on the Persian Gulf country over its disputed nuclear program.
Corless commented by e-mail today.  “This will make it harder for NITC to operate in the open
market as that last door on sanctions is closed, although given
the situation is already very difficult, this may have only
marginal impact. All this achieves is to prevent U.S. entities
from dealing with them (who were already indirectly restricted
in many ways) and to some extent the EU.  “It still does not stop  India ,  Japan  and  China  and their
respective shipowners and importers from dealing with Iran or
NITC, especially where there remains a political will to do so.
What these three countries do will really make the difference.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
