Komercni Banka  AS, the Czech unit of
Societe Generale SA, rebounded from its lowest in a month as
speculation that China will add to stimulus for the worldâ€™s
second-largest economy boosted demand for riskier assets.  The stock rose 1.4 percent to 3,399 koruna by 10:06 a.m. in
Prague, after losing 7.7 percent in the previous four sessions.
The 14-member  PX (PX)  equity index, in which Komercni Banka has a 17
percent weighting, increased 0.3 percent to 899.40.  To contact the reporter on this story:
