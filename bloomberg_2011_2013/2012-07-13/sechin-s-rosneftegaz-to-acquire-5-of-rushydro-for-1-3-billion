OAO Rosneftegaz, the energy holding
run by President  Vladimir Putin ’s ally  Igor Sechin , plans to
acquire about 5 percent of hydropower producer OAO RusHydro for
cash and stock, Energy Minister Alexander Novak said.  Rosneftegaz plans to buy about 40 percent of regional
utility OAO Irkutskenergo from state-run power exporter OAO
Inter RAO UES and then transfer that stake plus cash to RusHydro
in exchange for about 5 percent of RusHydro’s shares, Novak told
reporters in Yalta, Ukraine, late yesterday. It will also pay
about 16 billion rubles in cash, he said.  “The total sum of funds that will be transferred is
estimated at 41 billion rubles” ($1.3 billion), Novak said.
“Forty-one billion rubles is about 5 percent.”  Sechin was deputy prime minister until May, when Putin put
him in charge of Rosneftegaz, which was created to hold the
state’s 75.2 percent stake in oil producer OAO Rosneft and 10.7
percent of natural-gas exporter OAO Gazprom. He is also
Rosneft’s chief executive officer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
