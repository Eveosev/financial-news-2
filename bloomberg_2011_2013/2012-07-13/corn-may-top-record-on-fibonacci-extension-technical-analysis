The rally in corn prices fueled by
the worst U.S. Midwest drought since 1988 may climb to a record
$8.41 a bushel in the next two months, according to a  technical
analysis  by Stewart-Peterson Group Inc.  Corn futures for December delivery, after the harvest, may
jump 15 percent to $8.41 a bushel on the  Chicago  Board of trade,
based on a Fibonacci extension of a four-week rally that saw the
contract surge 45 percent, said Jacquie Voeks, a senior market
analyst at the West Bend, Wisconsin-based agricultural advisory
firm.  Prices advanced about $2.42 from a low on June 15 to
today’s 10-month high of $7.49. The contract was at $7.3525 as
of 1:09 p.m. in Chicago. A 38 percent Fibonacci extension from
today’s high would imply about a 92-cent increase and may
trigger new buying, Voeks said. The government on July 11 cut
its corn-production forecast by 12 percent to 12.97 billion
bushels and reduced its harvest-area forecast to 88.9 million
acres, or 92.2 percent of what was planted.  “If harvested acreage falls to 89.5 percent of planted
acres, that would cut the crop by an additional 400 to 500
million bushels,” Voeks said. “The charts point higher until
it rains.”  About 40 percent of the crop in the U.S., the world’s
largest grower and exporter, was in good or excellent condition
as of July 8, the lowest for that date in 24 years and down from
77 percent on May 18, Department of Agriculture data show. In
the drought of 1988, prices rose almost 67 percent from May 12
to July 5. A similar percentage move this year would project
prices at $8.50, Voeks said.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in commodity
prices.  Fibonacci analysis is based on the theory that prices tend
to drop or climb by certain percentages after reaching a high or
low. A break above resistance or below support indicates a
commodity may move to the next level. The difference between
high and low points on charts is divided into retracement levels
based on ratios that were described by 13th century
mathematician Leonardo of Pisa, known as Fibonacci, and
correspond to proportions found in nature.  To contact the reporter on this story:
