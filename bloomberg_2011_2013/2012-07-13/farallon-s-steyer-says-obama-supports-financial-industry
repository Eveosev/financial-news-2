Thomas Steyer, founder of Farallon
Capital Management LLC in San Francisco, said U.S. President
Barack Obama has been supportive of the financial industry even
as his rhetoric toward  Wall Street  is “harsh.”  “Obama has got some of his messaging wrong but it is a
political campaign,” Steyer said today in a Bloomberg
Television interview with Deirdre Bolton. “He didn’t break up
the banks, which some people thought was a good idea, he pushed
financial regulation that everyone thought there had to be. By
and large, he has been supportive of the financial community.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
