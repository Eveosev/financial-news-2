The ruble appreciated against the
dollar and yields on  Russia ’s international debt declined as
oil, the nation’s main export, advanced.  The Russian currency gained 0.5 percent to 32.627 per
dollar by the close in Moscow, the strongest since July 5. That
gave it a 0.6 percent increase in the week. The government’s $3
billion of Eurobonds due 2042 rose, cutting the yield 16 basis
points, or 0.16 percentage point, to 4.771 percent.  Brent crude  jumped 1.1 percent to $102.22 per barrel amid
speculation China will boost stimulus to spur a recovery. Oil
and gas together contribute about 50 percent of Russia’s state
revenue, according to the government’s estimates.  “Key Chinese economic data lent a positive background to
the morning session,” Vladimir Kolychev, chief economist at
Societe Generale SA’s OAO  Rosbank (ROSB)  unit in Moscow, wrote in a
research note to clients. “The rise in  oil prices  is raising
interest in the ruble.”  The ruble was little changed at 39.95 per euro and rallied
0.2 percent to 35.9224 against the central bank’s dollar-euro
basket. Investors pared bets on the currency weakening, with
non-deliverable forwards showing the ruble at 33.156 per dollar
in three months, compared with expectations of 33.2825 per
dollar yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
