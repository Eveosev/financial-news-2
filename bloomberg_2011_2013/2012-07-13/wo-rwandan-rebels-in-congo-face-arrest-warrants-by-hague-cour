The  International Criminal Court 
issued arrest warrants for two Rwandan-born rebel leaders for
their actions during a series of wars in eastern  Democratic
Republic  of Congo’s Kivu region.  The Hague-based court said it found “reasonable grounds”
to charge Bosco Ntaganda with four counts of  war crimes  and
three of crimes against humanity committed in 2002 and 2003.
Sylvestre Mudacumura faces nine counts of war crimes committed
in 2009 and 2010, the court said.  Ntaganda stands accused of “murder, attacks against
civilians, rape and sexual slavery, and pillage,” the court
said in an e-mailed statement. The ethnic-Tutsi rebel was
already facing charges for using child soldiers in a separate
conflict in eastern Congo’s Ituri region.  In total, 11 people with links to killings in Congo have
been indicted by the court. Ntaganda’s commander in Ituri,
Thomas Lubanga, was convicted in March of using child soldiers
in the court’s first ruling since it was created a decade ago.
He was sentenced July 10 to 14 years in prison.  Fighting in eastern Congo began more than 15 years ago in
the aftermath of the 1994 genocide in neighboring Rwanda that
killed more than 800,000 people, mostly Tutsi and some moderate
ethnic-Hutu.  At least 3.1 million people died as a result of the
conflict in Congo from 1998 to 2007, according to the
International Rescue Committee, mainly due to starvation or
easily preventable disease.  Ntaganda is presently leading a rebellion in the Kivus that
has displaced more than 220,000 people, according to the  United
Nations .  To contact the reporter on this story:
