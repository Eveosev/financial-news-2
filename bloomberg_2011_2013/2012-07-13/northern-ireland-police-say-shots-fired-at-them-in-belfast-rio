Northern Ireland police said at
least 10 gunshots were fired at officers during rioting in north
 Belfast  early today. No one was injured.  The shots were fired during riots in the Ardoyne area of
the city, in which petrol bombs and other missiles were thrown
by nationalists after a Protestant parade passed by the Catholic
area, a police spokesman said in a recorded phone message. The
shots were fired at about 12:30 a.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
