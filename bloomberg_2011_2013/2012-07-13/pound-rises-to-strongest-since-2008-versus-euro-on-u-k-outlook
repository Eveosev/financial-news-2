The pound advanced to the strongest
since November 2008 against the euro as investors bet an attempt
to ease U.K. credit conditions will help spur Britain’s economy.  Sterling snapped a two-day decline against the 17-nation
currency after Moody’s Investors Service cut  Italy ’s credit
rating, adding to signs the region’s debt crisis is deepening.
The  Bank of England  today released details of a new lending
program, which it said may boost credit to companies and
households by at least 80 billion pounds ($124 billion). U.K.
government bonds rose for a second week.  “The announcement of the lending program could be having a
positive impact on the pound by improving the outlook for the
U.K. economy,” said  Valentin Marinov , head of European group of
10 foreign-exchange strategy at Citigroup Inc. in  London .  The pound appreciated 0.5 percent to 78.69 pence per euro
at 4:04 p.m. London time after climbing to 78.63 pence, the
strongest since Nov. 3, 2008. The U.K. currency rose 0.8 percent
to $1.5545, poised for a weekly gain of 0.3 percent.  Sterling has appreciated 4.2 percent in the past year, the
third best performer after the dollar and yen out of the 10
developed-nation currencies tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-
Weighted Indexes. The euro slid 7.1 percent.  The pound may extend gains to 76.95 per euro, near its high
of October 2008, Barclays Plc technical analysts including  Phil Roberts  in London, wrote today in a note to clients.  Lending Plan  U.K. banks will be able to borrow treasury bills from the
Bank of England from Aug. 1 to use as collateral to fund lending
into the economy, according to details of the central bank’s
Funding for Lending plan published in London. The program is the
latest in a series of measures introduced to help the economy
fend off contagion from the euro-area debt crisis.  Gilts were boosted today as Moody’s cut Italy’s debt rating
by two steps and a Chinese report showed growth in  Asia ’s
largest economy slowed for a sixth quarter.  “There’s an underlying interest in core products including
gilts today and that is a function of the risk backdrop,” said
Eric Wand, a fixed-income strategist at Lloyds TSB Bank Plc in
London. “We may see some profit-taking into the weekend but any
dips in gilts will be well supported,” he said.  The 10-year yield was little changed today at 1.54 percent,
having declined five basis points this week. The 4 percent bond
due in March 2022 traded at 121.965. The yield dropped to 1.505
percent yesterday, the lowest level since June 1.  U.K. gilts have returned 3.6 percent this year, according
to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of
Financial Analysts Societies. They handed investors a gain of 17
percent last year as the  European debt crisis  worsened.  To contact the reporter on this story:
