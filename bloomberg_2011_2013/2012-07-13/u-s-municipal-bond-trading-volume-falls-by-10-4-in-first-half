U.S. municipal-bond trading volume
fell 10.4 percent in the first half of 2012 compared with a year
earlier as yields rose from four-decade lows in January.  The  number of trades  totaled 4.91 million, compared with
5.48 million in the first six months of 2011, the Municipal
Securities Rulemaking Board said in a report today. Dollar
volume fell 1.4 percent to $1.42 trillion from $1.44 trillion in
the same period of 2011.  New  municipal bond sales  are on pace to beat 2011,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Yields on 20-year general obligation  bonds yielded  3.83
percent yesterday, up from as low as 3.6 percent in January, a
level not seen since the 1960s, according to a Bond Buyer index
of yields.  To contact the reporter on this story:
