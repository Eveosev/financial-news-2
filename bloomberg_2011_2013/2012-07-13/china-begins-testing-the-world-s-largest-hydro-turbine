China began testing an 800-megawatt
hydro turbine that has the biggest unit capacity in the world
after completing its installation, Xinhua reported, citing an
unidentified spokesman of China Three Gorges Corp.  The first batch of turbines at the Xiangjiaba hydropower
plant are expected to come on line as early as October, the  news
agency  said.  Alstom SA (ALO) , the third-largest power-equipment maker,
said July 11 that it supplied four 800-megawatt turbines to the
plant.  The dam in the lower reaches of the Jinsha River is the
nation’s largest after the Three Gorges Dam and the Xiluodu
hydro plant, the report said. A call to China Three Gorges Corp.
wasn’t answered.  To contact the reporter on this story:
