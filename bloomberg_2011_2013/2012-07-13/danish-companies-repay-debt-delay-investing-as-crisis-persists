Danish companies are repaying debt
and shoring up capital instead of investing in new equipment and
jobs as access to credit tightens amid the economic crisis, the
Confederation of Danish Industry said.  Companies have reduced short-term bank debt by about 160
billion kroner ($26 billion) since a 2008 peak, the Copenhagen-
based industry organization said today in an analysis on its
website. Companies have cut long-term debt by 50 billion kroner
to about 2008 levels, DI said.  Bank loans have become more expensive and difficult to get,
according to the association. Some companies with collateral
have turned to  mortgage loans  yet that market can’t compensate
for the drop in bank lending, since not all businesses have
assets that can be tapped, DI said.  “Financing and access to capital are critical for a
businesses to develop and create new jobs,” Maria Pedersen,
economic consultant at DI, said in a statement. “Many companies
have had - and still have - difficulties getting funding to
operate and to develop their businesses.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
