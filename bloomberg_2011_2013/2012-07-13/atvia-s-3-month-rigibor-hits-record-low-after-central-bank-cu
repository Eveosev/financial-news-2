Latvian three-month borrowing costs
in lati fell to a record low after the central bank cut the
refinance, deposit and marginal lending rates.  Asking rates for three-month loans at the Riga interbank
offered rate, or Rigibor, fell to 0.67 percent from 0.87 percent
yesterday, the lowest level on record.  Central bank Governor Ilmars Rimsevics yesterday cut the
 interest rate  on overnight deposits to 0.1 percent and the 7-day
rate to 0.125 percent and the benchmark refinancing rate to 3
percent after the  European Central Bank  lowered borrowing costs
last week.  The Baltic country pegs its currency, the lats, to the euro
in a quasi-currency board where money in circulation is backed
by foreign-currency reserves.  To contact the reporter on this story:
