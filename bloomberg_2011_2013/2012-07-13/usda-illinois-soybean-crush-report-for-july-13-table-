protein supplement, and contains 48% protein. It is produced using a solvent,
or chemical process that separates the oil from the soybean. Domestic animal 
feed accounts for about 75% of meal consumption and the rest is exported.  Soybean oil is used in products including cooking oil, solvents for grease   
removal and metal cleaning, and hydrolic oil. It is also used in soy diesel 
products as a replacement for petroleum-based  diesel fuel .  Yellow soybeans have yellow or green seed coats which in cross section
are yellow or have a yellow tinge. According to the Federal Grain Inspection 
Service, No.1 yellow soybeans must test weigh at least 56 pounds a bushel, have 
less than 2 percent damaged kernels, and contain less than 1 percent of soybeans
of other colors.  Figures used in the table are based on crushings and production of soybeans
for   and are verified by the Bureau of the Census. Data is presented
for statistical comparison and is not intended to indicate operating margins.
