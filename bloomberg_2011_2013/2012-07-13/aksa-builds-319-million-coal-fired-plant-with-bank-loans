  Aksa Enerji Uretim AS (AKSEN) , Turkey’s
biggest non-government power producer, started construction of a
270-megawatt coal-fired power plant at a cost of 580 million
liras ($319 million) in the northwestern province of Bolu.  Istanbul-based Aksa Enerji, part-owned by  Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. (GS) , got a loan of $240 million from  Turkiye Is Bankasi (ISATR) 
AS and  Turkiye Garanti Bankasi AS (GARAN)  to finance the project, chief
executive Serdar Nisli told reporters before the ground breaking
ceremony in Bolu’s Goynuk district today, attended by Energy
Minister  Taner Yildiz . The remainder will be financed from
Aksa’s own resources, he said.  Turkey’s energy industry is luring international companies
such as  Verbund AG (VER)  and Austria’s OMV AG as electricity demand is
set to grow by an average 6.3 percent over the next 20 years,
according to data published by the energy market regulator.
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. bought 13.3 percent of Aksa Enerji in
April for $240 million.  Aksa rose 2.8 percent to 3.64 liras at 1:56 p.m. in
Istanbul, the biggest increase in more than two weeks.  The loan will be repaid over 12 years with a three-year
grace period, Aksa Enerji Chief Financial Officer Cuneyt Uzun
told reporters in Bolu. The loan will be signed within a month,
he said, declining to provide details about interest costs.  The first 135-megawatt unit of the plant will be completed
in October 2014 and the second one in March 2015, he said.  The power plant is part of a plan by Aksa to raise its
capacity to 4,500 megawatts in five years from 2,500 megawatts
currently, chairman Cemil Kazanci told reports in Bolu. Aksa has
a target of 2 billion liras ($1.1 billion) of revenue this year,
he said.  Aksa Enerji has acquired rights to extract an estimated 39
million metric tons of brown coal, or lignite, in the area for
35 years, Nisli said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
