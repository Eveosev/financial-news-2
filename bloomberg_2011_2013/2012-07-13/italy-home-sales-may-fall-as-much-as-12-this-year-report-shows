Italy ’s home sales may fall as much
as 12 percent this year amid an economic recession and as prices
fall for a fourth year, research institute  Nomisma  said.  Transactions may decrease this year to as low as 529,306,
the lowest in at least 12 years, after dropping 20 percent in
the first quarter, the Bologna-based institute said in a report
today. Prices of new homes fell 1.8 percent in the first half
and they are 11 percent lower than a 2008 peak, according to the
study based on a survey of the 13 biggest cities in Italy.  “The deteriorating economic context, coupled with more
selective borrowing conditions and the widespread expectations
of a wider depreciation than already recorded are the main
reasons for the new halt to the real estate market,” Nomisma
said.  Recession-hit Italy may contract 2.4 percent this year amid
rising unemployment and Prime Minister  Mario Monti ’s austerity
measures weighing on consumer demand, employers’ lobby
Confindustria forecasts. Home sales posted the biggest drop
since data collection began in 2004 in the first quarter, a
Finance Ministry agency said on June 19. A new property levy,
marking the return of taxation on primary residences after four
years, “won’t be an incentive for the market” in coming
months, the Agenzia del Territorio said in that report.  Lending for homeowners in Italy plummeted 47 percent in the
first quarter as banks raised rates and tightened credit
standards, according to a July 9 study by credit bureau CRIF
SpA, research group Prometeia and Assofin, a lenders’
association.  To contact the reporters on this story:
