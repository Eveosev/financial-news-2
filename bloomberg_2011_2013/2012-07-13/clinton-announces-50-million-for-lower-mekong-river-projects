Secretary of State  Hillary Clinton 
announced that the U.S. will provide $50 million over three
years in new assistance programs for countries along the
lower Mekong River.  The so-called Lower Mekong Initiative is designed to foster
collaboration between Laos, Cambodia and  Thailand , and address
transnational challenges, many related to the environment.  The funds will pay for programs including an impact study
of efforts to dam the river, a womenâ€™s leadership network,
malaria programs, and new funding for environmental and
connectivity programs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
