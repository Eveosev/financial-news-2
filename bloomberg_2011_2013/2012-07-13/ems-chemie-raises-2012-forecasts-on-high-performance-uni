EMS-Chemie Holding AG (EMSN) , the Swiss
supplier of resins to  General Motors Co. (GM) , raised its earnings
forecast for 2012 because of U.S. and Asian growth at its high-
performance polymers unit.  Net sales and operating profit will be “slightly above”
the figures for 2011, the Herrliberg-based company said in a
 statement . That compares with a forecast in April that revenue
and earnings wouldn’t grow this year. The company’s shares
climbed as much as 2.3 percent in Zurich trading.  The improved outlook was “not expected by us or the
consensus,”  Martin Schreiber , an analyst at Zuercher
Kantonalbank, said in an e-mail. Results were boosted by niche
products such as those of the polyamide product line, he said,
which provides plastics to replace metal car-parts.  EMS-Chemie’s raised forecast contrasts with competitors’
predictions of a slowdown. Harlow, England-based specialty-
chemical maker Yule Catto & Co. dropped 22 percent on June 27,
the most in almost 23 years, after saying demand weakened in
 North America  and Europe.  EMS-Chemie shares were 1.7 percent higher at 180.9 Swiss
francs as of 10:41 a.m.  First-half earnings before interest and taxes rose 6.9
percent from a year earlier to 167 million francs ($169.7
million), beating the 158 million-franc average of four analyst
estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Net sales increased 4 percent
to 904 million francs.  New business initiatives and better sales in the U.S. and
 Asia  “more than compensated for the effect of the declining
economy in Europe,” EMS-Chemie said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
