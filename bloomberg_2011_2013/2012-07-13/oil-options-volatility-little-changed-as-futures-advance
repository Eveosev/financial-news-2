Crude-oil options volatility was
little changed as underlying futures rose on speculation that
central banks would boost economic stimulus measures to counter
slowing growth.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
September, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a
gauge of options prices, was 31.9 percent at 3:30 p.m. on the
 New York Mercantile Exchange , up from 31.8 percent yesterday.
September options are now more active than August.  “It was offered most of the day and then it came up a
little,” said Fred Rigolini, vice president of Paramount
Options Inc. in  New York . “Volatility was oversold most of the
week.” Volatility was as high as 35.76 on July 10.  Crude oil for September delivery gained $1.02, or 1.2
percent, to $87.10 a barrel on the Nymex, the highest settlement
in six days.  Oil rose as Chinese  gross domestic product  expanded at a
three-year-low 7.6 percent last quarter from a year earlier, the
 National Bureau of Statistics  said. Medley Global Advisors
predicted the  European Central Bank  will ease monetary policy
further, boosting the euro from to a two-year low against the
dollar, to an 0.3 percent gain, increasing the investment appeal
of commodities.  The most active options in electronic trading today were
August $85 puts, which fell 45 cents to 26 cents a barrel at
3:38 p.m. with 2,751 lots trading. August $84 puts were the
second-most active options, with 2,677 lots changing hands as
they dropped 31 cents to 12 cents a barrel.  Bullish Bets  Calls accounted for 54 percent of total electronic trading
