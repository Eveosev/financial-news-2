Erste Stiftung, the foundation that
owns 24.8 percent of  Erste Group Bank AG (EBS) , may sell 150 million
euros ($183 million) of shares this year to pay off debt, Erste
Stiftung said in its annual report.  The foundation has to repay 250 million euros of debt in
December, according to the report  published on its website . It
plans to raise 100 million euros through a privately placed bond
and cover the rest with a sale of shares. At yesterday’s closing
 share price , that would equal a 2.6 percent stake in Erste Bank.  “The board has decided in principle not to roll over the
remaining liabilities of 150 million euros, but rather to raise
an appropriate amount to pay it back by selling stock in Erste
Group Bank,” according to the report. Erste Bank Chief
Executive Officer Andreas Treichl is Erste Stiftung’s chairman.  The foundation’s annual report was published mid-May, Erste
Bank spokesman  Michael Mauritz  said by telephone today. He
declined to say whether Erste Stiftung had already sold shares.
Austrian weekly Format first reported the foundation report in
today’s edition.  Erste Stiftung was created in 1993 and has been the biggest
shareholder of Erste Bank since. Among the foundation’s aims is
“to secure Erste Group Bank’s independent future as its
principal shareholder,” according to its  most recent bond
prospectus . The charitable foundation also funds social and art
projects in  Austria  and eastern  Europe .  Erste Stiftung had debts of about 1.18 billion euros at the
end of 2011, according to the report. Its main revenue source is
dividend payments from Erste Bank, which last year amounted to
67 million euros. That will be lacking from the foundation’s
cash flow and revenue in 2012 because Erste Bank skipped the
dividend for the 2011 business year. It expects to resume
dividend payments for this current year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
