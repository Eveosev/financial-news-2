The Philippine peso completed its
first weekly loss in three as the central bank took steps
against speculative inflows amid a global slowdown. Bonds gained.  Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas said on July 7 that it has
tightened rules on capital inflows by limiting where foreign
funds can put their money and today cut the rate on one-month
special deposit accounts to 4.15625 percent from 4.1875 percent.
 China  said today its economy expanded 7.6 percent in the second
quarter, the slowest pace in three years. The peso is still the
biggest gainer among the 11 most active currencies in  Asia  this
year, rising 4.4 percent.  “The peso has strengthened a bit too far already,” said
Tohru Nishihama, an economist at Dai-ichi Life Research
Institute Inc. in  Tokyo . “In addition, China shows signs of
slowing and external demand is weakening, which is also negative
for the  Philippines . The scope for further sharp appreciation
for the peso from here is quite limited.”  The peso dropped 0.4 percent this week to 41.98 per dollar
in  Manila , according to Tullett Prebon Plc. The currency reached
42.162 earlier, the weakest level since June 29. It gained 0.2
percent today. One-month implied volatility, a measure of
exchange-rate swings used to price options, climbed 20 basis
points, or 0.20 percentage point, to 6.40 percent and rose 50
basis points this week.  The monetary authority also lowered the one-week rate on
its special deposit accounts to 4.03125 percent and the two-week
rate to 4.09375 percent.  Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp., the most accurate forecaster
of the peso over the past six quarters, according to data
compiled Bloomberg, expects a 1.5 percent decline to 42.6 per
dollar by the end of December, saying the currency may have
strengthened too much.  The yield on the government’s 5.875 percent bonds due March
2032 declined five basis points to 5.74 percent this week,
according to prices from Tradition Financial Services. The rate
slumped nine basis points, or 0.09 percentage point, today.  To contact the reporter for this story:
