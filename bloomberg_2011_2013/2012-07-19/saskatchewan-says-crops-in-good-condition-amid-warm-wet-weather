Saskatchewan crops, including wheat
and hay, were in “good condition” as warm weather speeds
development and thunderstorms provide moisture, the Canadian 
province's Ministry of Agriculture said in an e-mailed  report  
today.  About 18 percent of cropland had surplus soil moisture and
74 percent was adequate, the ministry said. About 65 percent of
the province’s hay is cut, up from 59 percent a year earlier,
according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
