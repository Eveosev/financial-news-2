Indonesia’s rupiah halted a three-
day decline and bonds gained on speculation the  Federal Reserve 
will take more measures to support the  U.S. economy , spurring
fund flows into  emerging markets .  Global funds bought $34 million more Indonesian equities
than they sold yesterday, the biggest purchases in two weeks,
according to exchange data. The  MSCI Asia-Pacific Index (MXAP)  of
regional shares advanced the most in almost three weeks after
Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said yesterday the central bank is
ready to take further action to boost the recovery if necessary.  “Bernanke signaled that the option of adding stimulus is
open, which creates positive global sentiment and drives the
rupiah higher,” said Klara Pramesti, a Jakarta-based research
analyst in the treasury division at PT Bank Negara Indonesia.
“The rupiah will tend to be stable at 9,450 to 9,500.”  The currency strengthened 0.4 percent to 9,448 per dollar
as of 4:03 p.m. in Jakarta, the biggest gain in a week,
according to prices from local banks compiled by Bloomberg. One-
month implied volatility, which measures exchange-rate swings
used to price options, held at 8 percent.  The yield on the government’s 7 percent bonds due May 2022
fell five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 5.78
percent, the lowest level since March 6, according to closing
prices from the Inter Dealer Market Association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
