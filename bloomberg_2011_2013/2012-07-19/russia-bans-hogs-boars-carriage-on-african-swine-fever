Russia’s food-safety authority
banned the transportation of hogs, wild boars and their meat in
the Tver region because of African swine fever outbreaks.  The ban began yesterday, according to the agency, known as
 Rosselkhoznadzor . The region, northwest of Moscow, is expected
to ban hunting for boars starting Aug. 1, the agency said in an
e-mailed statement.  Outbreaks of the disease were first registered in the
region in May 2011. This year 21 new outbreaks have been
registered in private households, farms and hunting areas in
wild forests in Tver, according to Rosselkhoznadzor data. The
last six outbreaks were detected in the 10 days through today.  The regional government adopted a five-year program through
2017 that requires spending of 370 million rubles ($11.6
million) to eliminate the virus, Rosselkhoznadzor said July 13.  The fever is a viral disease that’s lethal for pigs and
harmless for humans, according to the  United Nations ’ Food &
Agriculture Organization.  To contact the reporter on this story:
