The dollar dropped versus most major
counterparts as sales of existing U.S. homes unexpectedly fell
and Philadelphia-area manufacturing shrank, spurring bets the
 Federal Reserve  will add stimulus that may debase the currency.  Higher-yielding currencies, including the Australian
dollar, climbed as risk appetite increased.  South Africa ’s rand
fell against most major peers after the nation unexpectedly cut
its benchmark  interest rate  to bolster its economy. Fed Chairman
Ben S. Bernanke yesterday kept open the possibility of more
stimulus, including debt purchases under a third round of
quantitative easing.  “Foreign currencies are benefiting against the  U.S.
dollar , particularly because soft U.S. data is driving stronger
views of QE3,”  Mark McCormick , a New York-based currency
strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman & Co., said in a telephone
interview. “The recent moderation we’ve seen in U.S. data has
lifted the market’s expectations that it’s something that could
be coming down the road.”  The dollar fell 0.3 percent to 78.59 yen at 5 p.m. New York
time. It touched 78.43 yen, the weakest level since June 5. The
greenback was little changed against the euro at $1.2281 after
declining earlier to $1.2324, the weakest level since July 10,
and appreciating to $1.2229. The 17-nation currency declined 0.3
percent to 96.51 yen.  Purchases of previously owned U.S. homes slid 5.4 percent
in June to a 4.37 million annual rate, an eight-month low,
figures from the National Association of Realtors showed today.
The Fed Bank of Philadelphia’s general economic index was minus
12.9 in July, after falling to minus 16.6 the month before.
Readings of less than zero signal contraction.  Aussie Gains  The Australian dollar rose to an 11-week high against the
greenback, appreciating as much as 0.8 percent to $1.0444 before
trading at $1.0427, up 0.6 percent. The Aussie touched a record
high against the euro, gaining as much as 0.9 percent to
A$1.1743.  New Zealand ’s dollar strengthened 0.4 percent to 80.33
U.S. cents.  Norway’s krone rallied 0.7 percent to 6.0567 versus the
dollar and gained 0.7 percent to 7.4387 per euro, and  Canada ’s
dollar advanced 0.3 percent to C$1.0074 to the greenback.  Crude oil for August delivery reached $92.94 a barrel in
New York, the highest since May 22. Norway and Canada are oil
exporters. The  MSCI World Index (MXWO)  of stocks advanced 0.7 percent,
and the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  touched 1,380.39, the
highest level since May 4.  Volatility Drops  The  implied volatility  of three-month options on Group of
Seven currencies touched 8.63 percent, according to a JPMorgan
Chase & Co. measure, the lowest level since November 2007. Lower
volatility makes investments in currencies with higher benchmark
lending rates more attractive because the risk in such trades is
that market moves will erase profits. The average over the past
five years is 12.4 percent.  Australia ’s  cash rate  target is 3.5 percent, and New
Zealand’s official cash rate is 2.5 percent. The U.S. benchmark
is zero to 0.25 percent.  Bernanke said yesterday the U.S. central bank is “prepared
to take further action as appropriate to promote a stronger
economic recovery.” The Fed purchased $2.3 trillion of
securities from 2008 to 2011 in two rounds of quantitative
easing. It also has kept its benchmark  interest rate  at
virtually zero since December 2008.  ‘Do Something’  “The markets are inching toward expectations that the Fed
will have to do something in terms of a policy initiative,
whether that’s QE3 or something else,” Robert Sinche, global
head of currency strategy at Royal Bank of Scotland Plc, said
today in a telephone interview. “They’re moving in that
direction, which is more broadly dollar-negative.”  South Africa’s rand weakened as much as 0.7 percent to
8.2177 per dollar before trading up 0.1 percent at 8.1686. It
dropped after the nation’s central bank lowered its benchmark
interest rate by half a percentage point, to 5 percent, citing
lower inflation and risks to economic growth.  “Any time you see a central bank take action in a
loosening direction, that’s only consistent with concerns about
global growth,”  Joe Manimbo , a market analyst in  Washington  at
Western Union Business Solutions, a unit of  Western Union Co. (WU) ,
said in a telephone interview.  The  dollar  erased early losses against the euro after Labor
Department data showed more Americans than forecast filed first-
time claims for unemployment-insurance  benefits  last week.
Applications climbed by 34,000 to 386,000 in the week ended July
14, the figures showed, versus a Bloomberg survey forecast for
365,000 claims. The volatility in the numbers was due to a
change in the timing of annual automobile-plant layoffs, a Labor
Department spokesman said.  Dollar Index  The  Dollar Index (DXY)  will probably rise to 86.20 to 86.40, its
highest point since 2010, in the coming months before it begins
to “tire” and declines to the 81.44 level during the fourth
quarter, according to a July 17 client note by William Moore, a
London-based technical strategist at Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc.  The 86.20 to 86.40 level “would equate to a move to about
$1.1881 in euro-dollar,” Moore said via e-mail. “It’s huge
resistance, given that a trend line has already uniformly picked
the highs from three previous years.”  The index, which Intercontinental Exchange Inc. uses to
track the greenback against the currencies of six major U.S.
trade partners, breached the resistance level of 81.31 to 81.78
May 16 before rising to 83.54 on June 1, Moore said. Resistance
is an area on a chart where sell orders may be clustered. The
 index  fell 0.2 percent to 82.891 today in  New York .  Sterling Strengthens  The euro weakened for a second day against sterling,
falling to the lowest in more than three years as  Spain  ’s 10-
year government bond yield climbed above 7 percent following a
debt sale today. That was the level that spurred  Greece , Ireland
and  Portugal  to seek bailouts.  Spain sold 2.98 billion euros ($3.7 billion) of two-, five-
and seven-year notes, in line with its maximum target. The Bank
of Spain said demand dropped to 1.9 times the amount of
securities offered, compared with 4.26 times the amount at the
previous auction last month.  The pound appreciated 0.5 percent to 78.10 pence per euro
and reached 77.92 pence, the strongest level since October 2008.
The U.K. currency gained 0.5 percent to $1.5725.  The euro dropped 4.5 percent over the past three months,
the worst performance among the 10 developed-nation currencies
tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The dollar
strengthened 3 percent, and the yen climbed 7.4 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
