Guaranty Trust Bank Plc (GUARANTY) , Nigeria’s
biggest lender by market value, rose to the highest in more than
four years on speculation of increased first-half earnings,
according to Vetiva Capital Management Ltd.  The stock rose gained as much as 3.5 percent to 18 naira
and closed 0.6 percent up at 17.50 naira in Lagos, the
commercial capital, gaining for a fifth day. That’s the
strongest price since April 2008 and gives the company a market
value of 510.1 billion naira ($3.2 billion).  “The rally in Guaranty is justified because we believe
there will be a significant upside to our 37.5 billion naira
forecast for after-tax profit in the first half,” Abiola Rasaq,
a Lagos-based analyst at Vetiva said by phone today. “I see the
possibility of the numbers running to 42 billion naira.”  Guaranty posted net income of 25.3 billion naira for the
first half of 2011. First-quarter net income rose 35 percent to
19.3 billion naira, from 14.3 billion naira a year earlier,
Guaranty said on April 19.  Company officials didn’t reply to an e-mail message
requesting the release date for their results.  Guaranty’s shares have risen 23 percent this year, compared
with an 11 percent increase in the Nigerian Stock Exchange All-
Share Index over the same period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
