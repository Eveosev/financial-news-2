The Senate blocked a Democratic tax
proposal designed to make it more difficult for companies to
move jobs out of the country and easier to bring jobs to the
U.S.  The 56-42 vote today, with 60 needed to advance the
measure, was largely along party lines as most Republicans voted
not to allow Senate consideration.  The bill would have prevented companies from deducting the
cost of moving operations out of the U.S. It offered a 20
percent tax credit for companies’ expenses in moving investments
from another country to the U.S.  The current policy is “the height of insanity,” said
Senator  Richard Blumenthal , a Connecticut Democrat.  Compared with the $15.5 trillion U.S. gross domestic
product or the $2.5 trillion the government is collecting this
year in tax revenue, the bill would have a relatively small
budgetary effect.  Eliminating the tax deduction would raise revenue by $168
million over 10 years and the tax break would cost $255 million,
according to the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation, said
Cullen Schwarz, a spokesman for Senator  Debbie Stabenow , a
Michigan Democrat who sponsored the proposal.  Democrats scheduled the vote on the bill as President
 Barack Obama  and Republican presidential candidate  Mitt Romney 
are trading accusations about outsourcing and the effects of
their proposals on job creation.  The outsourcing bill is S. 3364.  To contact the reporter on this story:
