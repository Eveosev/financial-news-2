Empresa de Energia de Bogota SA , a
Colombian electricity distributor, rose to the highest price in
four months after saying second-quarter profit doubled.  EEB advanced 1.5 percent to 1,050 pesos at 11:26 a.m. in
Bogota and earlier climbed 3.4 percent to its highest intraday
level since March 1. The benchmark IGBC Index rose 0.3 percent.  Net income in the three months through June rose 115
percent from a year earlier to 605 billion pesos ($340.7
million), EEB said in a statement released yesterday after the
close of trading.  “If you compare the growth from year-to-year, yes, it’s
huge,” Juan Camilo Martinez, an analyst at Medellin-based
brokerage Bolsa y Renta, said in a telephone interview. Profits
for the quarter were 1.7 percent higher than estimated at Bolsa
y Renta, Martinez said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
