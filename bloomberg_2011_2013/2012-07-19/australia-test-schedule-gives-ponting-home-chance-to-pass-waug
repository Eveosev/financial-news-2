Australia  will host  South Africa  in
 Brisbane  for the first time in 49 years to open its 2012-13
international season, while  Ricky Ponting  could become his
country’s most-experienced player at his home ground.  The Australian summer schedule released today features 43
days of international cricket, which includes three-Test series
against South Africa and  Sri Lanka , two best-of-five one-day
contests and three Twenty20 internationals.  Ponting would tie Steve Waugh’s record of  168 Tests  for
Australia if he plays in all three matches against South Africa
starting Nov. 9. That would give him the chance to take the
record outright in the series-opening Test against Sri Lanka in
Hobart, the capital of his home state of Tasmania.  Melbourne and Sydney retain their traditional slots as
hosts of the Boxing Day and New Year Tests.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
