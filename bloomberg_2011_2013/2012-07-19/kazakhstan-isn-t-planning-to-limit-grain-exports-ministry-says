Kazakhstan, the biggest wheat
producer in Central Asia, won’t curb grain exports this year
even as drought persists in the main grain-growing regions, the
 Agriculture Ministry  said in a statement distributed today.  The country plans to ship about 10 million metric tons of
grain in the season that started July 1, according to the
statement. Kazakhstan cut this year’s crop forecast to 14
million tons because of dry weather.  Kazakhstan faces an “alarming” drought in its grain
growing regions, Kaztag reported July 17, citing Deputy
Agriculture Minister Muslim Umiryayev.  To contact the reporter on this story:
