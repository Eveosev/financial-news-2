OAO Gazprom Neft, the majority owner
of  Serbia ’s dominant oil company  Naftna Industrija Srbije AD (NIIS) ,
will start building the Serbian section of its South Stream gas
pipeline by December.  The construction of the 411-kilometer (255 miles) pipeline
will cost 1.9 billion euros ($2.32 billion), Serbian President
 Tomislav Nikolic ’s press office said in an e-mail today after a
meeting with a Russian business delegation led by Dmitry
Malyshev, an adviser to GazpromNeft’s general manager.  Serbia is seeking to diversify its gas imports which
currently come from Russia through Hungary and Ukraine to be
less vulnerable to delivery disruptions.  Last October, state-owned gas company Srbijagas said the
cost to build the Serbian section would be 1.38 billion euros,
with an annual transit capacity of 34 billion square meters.  To contact the reporter on this story:
