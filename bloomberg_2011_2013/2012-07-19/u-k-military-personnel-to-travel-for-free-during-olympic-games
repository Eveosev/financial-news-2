London will give free transportation
to all U.K. military personnel working jobs at the Olympics for
the duration of the games, Mayor  Boris Johnson  said.  Access to London buses, rail, underground and overground
services will be free when a person is in uniform, Johnson said
in a statement today released by Transport for London.  “We offer a thank you from London for their outstanding
contribution to a great London 2012 Games,” Johnson said in the
press release from the capital’s official transport office.  The government drafted 3,500 personnel from the armed
forces to fill Olympic-related jobs after security company  G4S
Plc (GFS) , which was awarded a contract to protect the games, said it
didn’t have enough staff available to cover its
responsibilities. The  Olympic Games  begin on July 27.  To contact the reporter on this story:
