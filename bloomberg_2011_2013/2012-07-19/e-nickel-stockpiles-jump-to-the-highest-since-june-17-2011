Nickel stockpiles in  London  Metal
Exchange-monitored warehouses climbed to the highest level since
June 17, 2011.  Stockpiles rose 1.7 percent to 111,174 metric tons today
and have increased 8.1 percent this month, according to LME data
on Bloomberg. The warehouse in Vlissingen,  Netherlands , added
2,514 tons, according to the bourse.  Lower demand and higher supply are adding to the build-up.
In May, global refined nickel production rose to 143,000 tons
while demand fell to 135,700 tons, according to an e-mailed
report from the Lisbon-based International Nickel Study Group
yesterday. Output has exceeded consumption for the past three
months according to INSG data.  “We are still yet to see a hint of any demand
improvement,” London-based  Leon Westgate , an analyst at
 Standard Bank , said in an e-mailed report on July 16. “Ample
stocks of ore and metal in China, together with overcapacity
outside China, means that the nickel market is unlikely to get
particularly tight for the foreseeable future.”  On the London Metal Exchange nickel prices are down 13
percent this year making it the worst performer among the six
industrial metals on the bourse. It rose 0.9 percent to $16,241
a ton by 12:02 p.m. in London.  Copper, lead, aluminum, zinc and tin stockpiles monitored
by the LME all fell today, according to bourse data.  To contact the reporters on this story:
