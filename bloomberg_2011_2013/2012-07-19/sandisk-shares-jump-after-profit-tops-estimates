SanDisk Corp. (SNDK) , a maker of  flash
memory  for mobile devices, rose the most in more than two years
after second-quarter profit topped analysts’ estimates.  Excluding some items, profit was 21 cents a share, the
Milpitas, California-based company said in a statement
yesterday. Analysts had predicted 18 cents, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  SanDisk had warned in April that flash-chip production was
outpacing demand, causing prices to fall. The company said
yesterday that demand for memory from corporate customers and
international markets is helping the industry rebound.  “We believe that strengthening industry fundamentals and
our expanding portfolio of solutions will contribute to
improving financial results in the second half of 2012,” Chief
Executive Officer Sanjay Mehrotra said in the statement.  SanDisk climbed 10 percent to $38.70 at the close in  New
York , for the biggest gain since May 2010. The shares have
declined 21 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
