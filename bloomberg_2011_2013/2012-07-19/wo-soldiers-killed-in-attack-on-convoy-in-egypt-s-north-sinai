Two soldiers were killed by unknown
assailants in Egypt’s northern Sinai, the head of the province’s
criminal investigative division said today.  Brigadier General Mohamed Saeed said by phone that
eyewitnesses reported that the attackers escaped without injury
after opening fire with machine guns at the entrance of a town
near Egypt’s border with the  Gaza Strip .  The  Sinai Peninsula  has grown increasingly lawless since
 Hosni Mubarak ’s ouster last year. Militants inspired by al-Qaida
are said to be operating in the region and bedouins have
kidnapped foreign tourists as leverage in securing the release
of family members detained by authorities.  Egyptian security forces have also intercepted several
shipments of weapons, including rockets that were reportedly
smuggled in from Libya and destined for Sinai and possibly the
Hamas-ruled Gaza Strip.  To contact the reporter on this story:
