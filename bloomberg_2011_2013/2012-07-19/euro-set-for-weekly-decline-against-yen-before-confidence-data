The euro weakened to the least
versus the yen since November 2000 and to a two-year low against
the dollar on concern European policy makers aren’t doing enough
to resolve the region’s financial crisis.  The 17-nation shared currency added to its three-week loss
versus the greenback as  Spain  said its recession will extend
into next year as the region of Valencia prepared to seek a
rescue from the central government. Spanish borrowing costs
approached a euro-era record even after European finance
ministers gave full approval to an aid package of as much as 100
billion euros ($122 billion) for the nation’s banks.  “The headlines that are coming out of Spain and  Europe 
have been adding to pressure on the euro,” Eric Viloria, senior
currency strategist at Gain Capital Group LLC in New York, said
in a telephone interview. “Growth is a major concern, and that
could be the next thing that puts more pressure on the euro.”  The shared currency dropped as much as 1.2 percent to 95.35
yen, the lowest level since November 2000, before trading at
95.43 yen at 5 p.m.  New York  time. It declined 1.6 percent on
the week.  The euro fell as much as 1.1 percent to $1.2144, the
weakest since June 2010, before trading at $1.2157, down 1
percent. It lost 0.8 percent on the week.  Japan ’s currency rose
0.1 percent to 78.49 to the greenback, which depreciated 0.9
percent over the past five days in its fourth weekly loss.  Major Peers  The yen and dollar rose against most major currencies as
investors sought safety, while the euro fell against most.  The euro sank 5.2 percent over the past three months, the
worst performer with the Swiss franc among 10 developed-nation
currencies tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes.
The yen was the biggest winner, climbing 8.6 percent. The U.S.
and Australian dollars each gained 4.1 percent.  The shared currency will probably decline to the “mid
$1.15s over the next few weeks,”  Shaun Osborne , chief currency
strategist at  Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD) ’s TD Securities unit in
Toronto, wrote today in a note to clients. The currency is in a
“deeply-entrenched bear trend,” Osborne wrote.  The euro slumped to the lowest in more than three years
versus the pound before data from the single-currency region
next week that economists said will show  consumer confidence  was
close to a three-year low and manufacturing contracted for a
12th month.  Pound Climbs  The pound appreciated 0.3 percent to 77.83 pence per euro
and reached 77.71 pence, the strongest level since October 2008.
The U.K. currency fell 0.7 percent to $1.5623.  Spain’s benchmark 10-year bond yield climbed to as high as
7.284 percent, almost matching the 7.285 percent it touched a
month ago. The 7 percent level was the threshold for global
bailouts of  Greece , Ireland and  Portugal . Debt due in 2020
issued by Catalonia, the biggest Spanish regional economy,
yielded 13.24 percent.  The difference between Spanish and German 10-year bond
yields widened to a record 613 basis points today, or 6.13
percentage points.  A plan by Spain to offer emergency loans to its regions
leaves the Treasury with 12 billion euros of additional funding
needs. The Cabinet approved creating the 18 billion-euro fund
last week to help regions that have lost access to markets meet
debt redemptions and finance deficits. The state-owned lottery
will provide 6 billion euros. Economy Minister Luis de Guindos
said yesterday the plan won’t affect Spain’s borrowing program.  ‘Same Route’  “The market is more concerned about Spain going down the
same route as Greece, looking for a sovereign bailout,”  Dean
Popplewell , an analyst in Toronto at the online currency-trading
firm Oanda Corp., said in a telephone interview. “It doesn’t
paint a rosy picture for  capital markets .”  Greece was the first euro member to get a bailout.  An index of consumer sentiment in the euro bloc fell to
minus 20 in July, a Bloomberg News survey forecast before the
European Commission reports the data July 23. It reached minus
21.3 in December, the lowest since August 2009. A factory gauge
is estimated to be at 45.2 this month, a separate survey showed
before the July 24 report. A reading of 50 divides expansion
from contraction.  The biggest loser among major currencies today was  South
Africa ’s rand, which weakened as investors speculated the
country’s central bank may reduce  interest rates  again after a
surprise cut yesterday. The South African Reserve Bank’s
Monetary Policy Committee lowered its repurchase rate to 5
percent from 5.5 percent, the first cut since November 2010.  The rand dropped 1.5 percent to 8.2868 per dollar.  Canada’s Dollar  The Canadian dollar fell the most in two weeks versus the
greenback as  Canada ’s annual inflation rate rose less than
forecast in June, 1.5 percent, dimming the outlook for higher
interest rates. The currency declined as much as 0.6 percent,
the biggest intraday drop since July 6, to C$1.0131 to the
greenback before trading at C$1.0125.  Australia ’s dollar fell versus its U.S. counterpart for the
first time in six days as investor risk appetite sank. Data due
next week also is forecast to show the nation’s consumer prices
grew at the slowest year-over-year pace since June 1999,
increasing scope for the  Reserve Bank  of Australia to lower
interest rates.  The South Pacific currency depreciated 0.5 percent to
$1.0378 and declined 0.6 percent to 81.46 yen.  The Aussie’s risk-adjusted loss of 0.16 percent against the
dollar this year is the fourth-largest among major currencies,
the Bloomberg Riskless Ranking showed. The euro was the worst
performer, losing 0.69 percent versus the greenback.  The risk-adjusted return, which isn’t annualized, is
calculated by dividing total return by volatility, or the degree
of daily price variation, giving a measure of income per unit of
risk. A higher volatility means the price of an asset can swing
dramatically in a short period, increasing the potential for
unexpected losses.  To contact the reporter on this story:
