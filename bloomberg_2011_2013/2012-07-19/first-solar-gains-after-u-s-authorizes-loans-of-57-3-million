First Solar Inc. (FSLR) , the worldâ€™s
largest maker of thin-film solar panels, rose to the highest in
two weeks after two Mumbai-based companies secured U.S. loans to
buy panels.  First Solar  climbed  4.6 percent to $15.13 at the close in
 New York , the highest since July 5. Shares of the Tempe,
Arizona-based company fell 55 percent this year.  The U.S. Export-Import Bank approved $57.3 million to Solar
Field Energy Two Private Ltd. and Mahindra Surya Prakash Private
Ltd. to help finance the purchase of First Solar panels,
according to a  statement  yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
