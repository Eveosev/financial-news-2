 U.K. Border Agency staff and other
Home Office workers plan to strike July 26, a day before the
start of the  London  Olympics, as part of a dispute over job
cuts, pay and the privatization of services, the Public and
Commercial Services Union said.  U.K. Border Agency employees as well as identity and
passport service and criminal record bureau workers, will
participate in the walkout, causing disruptions at airports and
ports.  “Ministers have known about these issues for a very long
time and need to act now to sort out the chaos they have
caused,” PCS General Secretary  Mark Serwotka  said in an e-
mailed statement today.  Union members also plan actions short of a strike,
including an overtime ban and working to rule July 27 to Aug.
20, if the government refuses to negotiate an agreement.  “They’re acting recklessly in cutting so many jobs and
privatizing services, and are provocatively refusing to talk to
us with a genuine desire to reach an agreement,” Serwotka said  Home Secretary Theresa May described the strike as
“shameful” on the eve of what will be one of the key days for
tourists arriving to London for the games.  To contact the reporter on this story:
