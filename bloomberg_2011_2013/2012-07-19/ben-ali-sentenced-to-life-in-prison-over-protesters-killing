A Tunisian military court sentenced
ex-president Zine El Abidine Ben Ali in absentia to life in
prison today for complicity in the deaths of protesters
during the popular uprising which led to his ouster last year,
the country’s official news agency reported.  Ben Ali’s Interior Minister Rafik Belhaj Kacem was
sentenced to 15 years in prison while his head of presidential
security, Ali Seriati, got 20 years in jail, according to the
news service, known as TAP.  On July 14, a military court sentenced Ben Ali to life in
prison for his role in the deaths of protesters in several towns
during the revolt. He received a sentence of 20 years from
another military court the same day for inciting violence.  Ben Ali and his wife fled the country in January 2011 and
are living in  Saudi Arabia . He has also been convicted in
civilian courts on other charges.  To contact the reporter on this story:
