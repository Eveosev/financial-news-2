Tottenham’s captain and former
 England  defender  Ledley King  retired from professional soccer
and will stay at the north London team in an “ambassadorial”
role.  King, 31, has been plagued by knee and groin injuries that
have restricted his appearances for club and country. He’s spent
his entire career at the Premier League team, making more than
300 appearances, including the 2008 victory over Chelsea in the
League Cup final. His 21 international caps for England included
appearances at Euro 2004 and the 2010  World Cup .  “I would like to say thank you to everyone at the club and
to the fans. I have missed a lot of football over the years, but
the Spurs fans have always been patient and incredibly supportive
with me during difficult periods,” King told the  club’s website .
“Sadly my injuries and inability to train have now finally brought
an end to my career.”  Chairman  Daniel Levy  said King had made a “magnificent
contribution” to Spurs.  “It is in an ambassadorial capacity that Ledley will
continue, playing a crucial role in supporting the club’s work
in the community and the ongoing regeneration of the Tottenham
area, whilst also being a hugely positive role model for our
younger players,” Levy said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
