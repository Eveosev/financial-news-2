The following companies had unusual

 Merval (MERVAL)  index rose 0.2 percent to 2,502.54.  Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4)   rose 2.2 percent to 69.10
pesos after  oil prices  climbed to the highest in eight weeks on
concern that instability in the Middle East will disrupt
supplies from a region responsible for about 30 percent of world
production.  YPF SA (YPFD)   fell 2.4 percent to 88.10 pesos. U.S. oil
producers are interested in investing in Argentina if the
country passes a bill that allows them to transfer profit out of
the country, Ambito Financiero reported yesterday. The Argentine
government wonâ€™t be able to pass a bill allowing the companies
to transfer profit before year-end, Ambito said.  Pampa Energia SA (PAMP)   was unchanged at 1.21 pesos at
the close of trading, after rising 1.7 percent earlier in the
