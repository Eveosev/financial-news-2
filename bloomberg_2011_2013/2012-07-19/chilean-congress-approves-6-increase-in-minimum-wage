Chile’s Congress approved a
government bill late yesterday that will raise the monthly
minimum wage to 193,000 pesos ($396), an increase of 6 percent
without taking  inflation  into account, the Senate press office
said in a  statement  posted on its website.  The  legislation  takes effect retroactively from July 1,
according to the text of the bill. Chile’s Congress generally
raises the minimum wage every year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
