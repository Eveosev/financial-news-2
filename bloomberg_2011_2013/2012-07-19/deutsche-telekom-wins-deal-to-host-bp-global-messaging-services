Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE) ’s T-Systems unit
said it signed a five-year agreement with  BP Plc (BP/)  to host
messaging services for more than 83,000 employees.  T-Systems will upgrade and migrate BP’s e-mail software to
its Munich data center, from where employees of the  oil company 
can access it via desktop and mobile devices, the division’s
Managing Director in the U.K., Sam Kingston, said in a phone
interview. He declined to comment on a realistic volume for the
deal, which is billed according to data volume.  Providers are advertising cloud services as a more flexible
and secure way for clients to access programs or stored files
via the Web rather than installing them own their own servers.
T-Systems, Europe’s largest provider of such services, is also
handling standardized on-demand collaboration services for
automotive companies  Daimler AG (DAI)  and  Georg Fischer AG. (FI/N)   “The development and provision of cloud services is a key
component of Deutsche Telekom’s strategy,” T-Systems Chief
Executive Officer Reinhard Clemens said in a statement today.
“Over the last seven years, T-Systems has become a recognized
cloud leader.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
