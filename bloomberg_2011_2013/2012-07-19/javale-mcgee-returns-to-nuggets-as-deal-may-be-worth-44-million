The Denver Nuggets re-signed free
agent center JaVale McGee to a multiyear contract, retaining a
7-footer who led the National Basketball Association in blocked
shots per game during the 2010-11 season.  McGee, 24, agreed to a four-year deal thatâ€™s worth $44
million,  Yahoo Sports reported , citing an unidentified person
familiar with the negotiations.  The Nuggets acquired McGee from the  Washington Wizards  on
March 15 as part of a three-team trade. He averaged 11.3 points,
7.8 rebounds and 2.16 blocked shots in 61 games, including 45
starts, for Denver and Washington last season.  After becoming a full-time starter in 2010-11, McGee
averaged career-highs in points (10.1) and rebounds (8.0) while
leading the NBA with 2.44 blocks per game.  To contact the reporter on this story:
