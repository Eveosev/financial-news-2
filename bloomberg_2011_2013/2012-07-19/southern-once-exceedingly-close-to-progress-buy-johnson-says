Southern Co. (NSC)  came “exceedingly
close” to buying Progress Energy Inc. before the North Carolina
utility owner agreed to a takeover by  Duke Energy Corp. (DUK) , former
Progress Chief Executive Officer  Bill Johnson  said.  “At the end, the price wasn’t right,” Johnson said in
testimony to the North Carolina Utilities Commission today in
Raleigh. He didn’t say when the talks took place.  The North Carolina commission is investigating Johnson’s
ouster as Duke’s CEO hours after the takeover closed July 2.  To contact the reporter on this story:
