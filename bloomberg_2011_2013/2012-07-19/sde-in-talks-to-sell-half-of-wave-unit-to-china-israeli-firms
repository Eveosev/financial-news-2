SDE Energy Ltd., a Tel Aviv-based
maker of technology that uses the power of the waves to generate
electricity, is talking about selling half of its business to a
Chinese car maker and an Israeli medical company.  SDE expects to conclude talks with the two “major”
companies in about two months, said Shmuel Ovadia, its chief
executive officer and owner. The Chinese car manufacturer wants
to use SDE’s technology to power its factory and the medical
company has “excess money” and wants to invest in clean
energy, he said without naming the companies.  “We believe the bigger companies than ours will do a
better job dealing with all the projects,” Ovadia said by e-
mail. “We would like to sell 50 percent of the company and to
continue to give our consultation and management skills,
although are open for different suggestions.”  SDE is worth about $10 million, Ovadia said. If an
acquisition doesn’t happen, SDE plans to raise more money and
would like to secure as much as $100 million, Ovadia said. SDE
has 11 working models of its device, one in  China  and the
remainder in  Israel , he said.  Wave energy has the potential to meet as much as 13 percent
of current world electricity consumption, according to the
 website  of the European Ocean Energy Association. No utility-
scale projects are working now because the technology remains
experimental.  Energy from the waves currently costs about $445 a
megawatt-hour, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance data.
This compares to about $78 a megawatt-hour for coal-fired power.  To contact the reporter on this story:
