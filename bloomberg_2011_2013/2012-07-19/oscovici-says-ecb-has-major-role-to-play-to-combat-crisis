French Finance Minister  Pierre Moscovici  said the  European Central Bank  has a “major role to
play” in fighting Europe’s debt crisis.  The Frankfurt-based ECB is fulfilling its role by providing
liquidity to banks and helping promote financial stability in
the region, Moscovici said to reporters today in Washington.
European policy makers “made huge progress in the last months,
we did that with the support of the ECB.”  Decisions at the European summit last month must be
implemented, he said. “The role of the ECB is certainly
pivotal.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
