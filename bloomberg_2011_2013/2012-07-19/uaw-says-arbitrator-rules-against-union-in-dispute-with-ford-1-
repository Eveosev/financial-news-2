The  United Auto Workers  said an
arbitrator ruled against it on a grievance against  Ford Motor
Co. (F)  in which the union contended that salaried employees didn’t
give up as much as its members in pay and benefits.  The  ruling  was announced by the union’s Ford department in
a posting on its Facebook page. The arbitrator issued it today,
the UAW said.  The decision resolves a conflict between the Detroit-based
union and Dearborn, Michigan-based Ford that had lasted more
than two years. UAW President  Bob King  has said he protested
directly to the automaker over the matter.  The union filed the equality-of-sacrifice grievance in
early 2010. More than 35,000 Ford workers, who gave up pay
increases and bonuses, signed the grievance after the company
reinstated raises, tuition assistance and 401(k) matches for
salaried staff members.  Ford fell 0.3 percent to $9.35 at the close in New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
