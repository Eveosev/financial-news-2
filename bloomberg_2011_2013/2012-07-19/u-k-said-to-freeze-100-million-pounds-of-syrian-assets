The British government has frozen
about 100 million pounds ($157 million) of assets owned by
members of the Syrian regime, said an official familiar with
the matter.  Russia and  China  vetoed a Western-drafted United Nations
resolution today threatening non-military sanctions on the
regime after 18 months of escalating violence.  The resolution called for measures such as an embargo on
supplying arms to the Syrian military and asset freezes unless
President Bashar al-Assad complied in 10 days with a UN peace
plan he has flouted until now.  A bomb attack in Damascus that killed key members of
Syria’s military establishment yesterday has left Assad
scrambling to stop his family’s four-decade grip on power
unravelling. U.K. Prime Minister  David Cameron  called on Assad
today to leave power.  The government’s asset freeze was reported earlier by the
 BBC . The official declined to be identified because he wasn’t
authorized to speak publicly.  To contact the reporter on this story:
